How did Coinbase manage to make the Coinbase “pro” UI even worse than Gdax?  
I feel like that while we have a lot of bears, most of those bears are longterm bulls who are shorting to increase their profit/quantity of held BTC.   The number of true longterm bears who feel that BTC will never break $20k is much, much smaller.
Some lines:

I'm building a long position starting here, and adding until we get to my pink line around 7050-7100, stop loss below 7k. Pretty meh about it. Will hedge short on a convincing breakdown, but I don't think it happens this weekend (for really no reason, other than the volume is lacking).

The much more convincing long for me is Eth right now:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/7TKeYXRk/

Especially with quarterlies still trading at a 12 dollar negative premium. Something to keep an eye on, as both pairs feed off one another.
[I just made this chart](https://i.imgur.com/s80kb83.jpg). The lines don't all match up neatly, but I think it's clear we can all see where bitcoin is heading.
We need to work out the average time frame for the downward leg of the Bart. 

Get the feeling it's approaching. This is all just no mans land for me trade wise. Quite literally no idea where we are heading in the short term. 
moved down my sl from 7650 to 7350. Getting closer to the triangle support. Things are getting serious with the weekly close tomorrow. A little lower and we'll have a hidden bullish divergence on the weekly. I will put alarms between 7400 and 7200. I sincerely hope that a lot of longs will close if we approach 7k, it would make a BGD more probable 
i think polo is dying. the volume is non-existent

24 hour volume for their top 10 coins(and frankly I believe most of this volume is just arbitrage bots and not actual traders):

* ETH: 451 BTC
* MAID: 289 BTC
* Ripple: 184 BTC
* Monero: 160 BTC
* Dash: 158 BTC
* Primecoin: 152 BTC
* LTC: 117 BTC
* BCH: 112 BTC
* Stellar: 90 BTC
* ARDR: 73 BTC

this is frankly pathetic. By comparison, Binance did 7000 BTC volume for ETH. In fact, for ETH, Poloniex is the 90th exchange by volume.

this is such a sad sight to see considering Polo was one of the great ones just a few years back. Frankly they need to switch to 0% market maker fees just to stay competitive. 
Looking at the long term (Daily/weekly).
I still believe everything between 7k and 9k (eventually more narrow), is just noise.

I'm prepared for a month of sideways until a direction is chosen.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/b8Vo3lgh/

We are maybe at previous resistance turned support line(s), so I'm betting on a bounce here with a very small long.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/5AGzfWVx/
I’m scaling into a short here. We have some slight momentum on the 4hr MACD that may take us to $7.8. I’ll add to this position if we move up.  But it’s also possible this falls over right here and moves towards the resistance line around $7100. 

The most bullish thing I can say is that buyers are not letting price drop precipitously. Any move up however is still incredibly weak. Feels like buyers are pushing a heavy boulder up a hill.  

I’ll close at the resistance line on the daily pennant if we get there and wait. In my mind, this is the last chance bulls have for a reversal. All the oscillators are bearish. 3D MACD has crossed down which is implying a larger move to lower lows.  Of course it’s a lagging indicator and will read as a bounce if buyers show up to keep us in the continuation cycle (still a possibility).  

Overall we’re several months from ATH and retail buyers are continuing to lose interest.  Opportunistic sideline traders may arrive for another leg up ... but the media cycle that would feed the next bull phase seems to be retreating into the rear view mirror. 

Safe trades
And then, like a secret society or something, they all went long, and lived happily ever after.
Heard somewhere that smart money doesnt trade on weekends. It's probably bollocks, and im amongst the most retarded money there is, but im still using this excuse to sit on me arse, feet up high with a spliff in me mouth. Enjoy your Saturday.

That means im not currently in a trade, partially lazy as fuck but partially i just dont think this a good place to be in a position.

If i was a bear, id be slowly closing shorts and looking to reshort if 6500 breaks and then even more if 5900 breaks. Although, in bear favour, look at what happened when we had a little pump last weekend. I didn't trust it then and i dont trust the one today either but shorting now to scale out by 7200-6800 to the re-enter is more work and risk than its worth imo. id rather just wait.

That's what i'd do if i was a bear but im a bull so got buys set in green box (~7200-6800) with a stop at pink line. if pink line breaks then ill exit and re-evaluate. If my buys fill, then im taking profit just before 10k and 11.4k.

Chart for reference: https://www.tradingview.com/x/i1W46fZD/

Good luck

longs timebomb
15 min RSI is below 14. This is insane. Trying a scalp long now @7288. It's a historical low.

Edit: You guys scare me. Exited for a 0.9% gain (can't math) @7342
I'm so tempted to enter a scalp long here. RSI oversold on 15m-4hr timeframe, volume is low and ripe for manipulation which leads me to think this drop will be barted back up
Shout out to my drunk self for opening that short, love ya buddy.

But I’ll be closing it here for a nice profit. Don’t have time to babysit position, at work all night.

Also this low volume is summoning Bart’s from all directions. 


Cheers mates  enjoy the holiday weekend

Keep an eye one the weekly close tomorrow..if it closes below 50MA..that's very bearish.. Last time that happened it took a year to get above it..

I'm waiting it out..
The Trend finally changed.  We are now in a negative trend.  This is the end of the bull market cycle that started months ago.  We are now in a new cycle.  While I am not calling a bottom yet, we are in a new place in our journey.

As I am sure is true with almost everyone, I hate waking up to prices a couple hundred dollars less with a 50 coin order sitting on the offer.  Its been a depressing few weeks.

So, yesterday we broke a trend that had been in place for 192 columns.  That trend took us from about $1,100 to where we are today, around $7,500.

We are now sitting on the old trend line—which is now the last support line.  If we break below this line, there is nothing supporting us on the way down.  It could be dire if the sellers still wish to keep pressing.  I am confident we won’t go down to the $1,800 target the Fed set the other day—but it could go lower.  Get your heads wrapped around that.

When I draw some lines on the last support our to meet the resistance it comes to the point of a triangle that is still several columns to the right.  The last time we were this close to a convergence was at the end of the last major bear market.  Once we hit the points, we started a new cycle which took us from $1,000 to near $20,000.  

The last bear cycle was pretty short.  Most trend changes to negative are short in life—but they can be pretty viscous.  A Trend change requires you to put on “bear glasses” and see everything half empty.  It means that we need cautious (not downright depressed!) and be careful.

That target lines for these convergence points (#1—the trend line down to last support (labeled “trend” and the red line coming up from the lower right.) AND the ATH line down from the upper left (blue dashed) down to the red support line are at $8,450 and $8,700.  We should see some decent movement if we approach those two price points.

So, not to be dramatic, but we are at a dawn of a new cycle.  Which way it goes depends on the big boys.  I am prepared to see some significant decline (probably into the $5,000 range) followed by some decent growth that should carry on for a while.

So, we're back to the weekend pump.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/Tan8zPUW/

Conversely, I'm looking at the bollinger bands, and maybe there is no weekend pump. That's just bouncing back from the overselling on thurs/friday


maybe we should make the position bot subscriptions private.... I don’t want to make the next demagogue/Ver, do you? 
**Position Bot**

Notifications/Subscriptions:

The Notifications service is working fine with the Pushed app but the free account has limitations that will make it impossible to use.

There are other services that are free to use, but require the users to pay for the app (5$ per device type. Android, iOS, etc)

This could be solved by creating a specific app for android and iOS just for the Position Bot, but that would take more time than i have available now. Is someone is used to creating apps and is willing to give me a hand let me know. The app should be pretty straightforward, connect to the notifications service and once a message arrives just show the notification.

Another option is changing the system used. The more common options that crossed my mind is something like Twitter or Telegram. The problem is that these apps are more for general use and the notifications could get lost between your regular messages / tweets.

The ideal service would be one that allows users to select which users they want to follow. In telegram these would be private channels per user and the bot would be in charge of delivering access codes. 
Twitter 

Any other ideas?

So we're closing in to the fourth and last downtrend in my charts.

The decision will be made before the next 6-8 hours, probably much sooner.

This price action is intense.
When did we last see a bear flag/wedge like this on the 1d ? The range is super tight
To trade anything less than 4h candles those days just feel like pure gambling...
I'm starting to think this is a set up for another leg down. Volume, stoch rsi, macd up to 4h seem ready. 6h not so much yet. Entered a short 3x at 7555, will reevaluate if we stay above 7800. 
This is the most constipated dump I've ever seen.  Who has the ex-lax?
Don't let bears get to your head. Stay agnostic to your charts:

Does anyone here besides me follow the strategy of doing the exact opposite of the sentiment in this thread? I mean, almost every time I read this thread the following strategy comes to mind: "Be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy."
I love when the chart looks like a square wave
I'm not much of a formation guy, but those the different color of the candle has any importance if they will play out or not ? Looking at this bull flag like formation here on 1h currently https://www.tradingview.com/x/BUPWKmdV   
Tin foil hat: What if this is just a litte short squeeze and a little bulltrap before the real dump begins

Also volume seems to have be building up on the 3h (just 2 candles with increasing volume) and soon it shifts to red just as it often does.
Apparently when I was blacked out drunk last night I opened a short at $7561. 0 recollection of it. This is why we can’t have nice things. 

I’ll just hold the short because we are flirting with the top of our new symmetrical triangle. This also looks like a bart 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/P5X7PPBE/




Bollinger bands on the 3h is getting thight, maybe a quick walk to the store to buy some coke and popcorn to enjoy when this breaksout. And judging by the amount of comments here were due for some volatility, it either that or everyone is reading before their exams

Sorry for shitposting.
This is it. Heads or tails

I have my SL at 7320

EDIT: RIGHT SIDE OF COIN, JEEEEYEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
"Open for trading 24 hours," they say. Sheesh.
!long xbusd close 7580

[Closed scalp long](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8lywrt/daily_discussion_friday_may_25_2018/dzjvsxo/) using limit order as planned while asleep, target reached. The price did actually make my original target but I had already reduced it slightly.

Still looking good for a W4 ABCDE which would be the penultimate formation in this wave down. [The bigger picture is more useful now](https://www.tradingview.com/x/pvJbdkPj/), since we are getting near longer-term decision time.

As normal [TD is useless in triangle consolidations](https://www.tradingview.com/x/9Aah48KZ/) despite the daily still being bearish I would advise against heavy shorting until the next wave plays out. I am expecting a pivot in either the 7100 areas or the 6900 area. The longer this plays out the higher the 6900 number gets, but I am expecting our situation to resolve in a day or two.

One outsider case involves a reversal in the 6700 on the 1:1.618, that would wrongfoot everyone.

[This would be the next big trade](https://www.tradingview.com/x/YmCVDUYU/) for those not already long, have to take a bit of pain with the nearly 4% stop but the payoff if correct would be 28% with a RR of nearly 8.

Good luck and don't forget to enjoy your weekend!
!short XBTUSD 7525 25x 100%
IH&S very close to confirming (i'd say about 605-610 to reach the neckline) on ETH and BTC is leaning bullish on this coil pattern.

ETH: https://www.tradingview.com/x/zkl7Rc4i/
BTC: https://www.tradingview.com/x/q58ynfRX/

Expecting a daily lower high to be set here over the weekend before further downside to hit the support line on BTC's weekly equilibrium pattern.  If this breaks up my targets would be 7800 resistance on the low side up to daily EMA12 rejection at ~7980 (and dropping) on the high side.

If we see further downside... Either the bottom will just flat drop out on us here or we'll just break 7k, trigger a few stops and bounce to the upside for a little bit.  Do we make it all of the way to the resistance line on the weekly pattern though? I don't think so but its possible.  ETH is lagging behind on this equilibrium pattern and make ask that BTC continues tightening a little longer so it can set a few more lower highs and higher lows before breaking.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/5T5eQCPq/

I'm leaning bearish on this pattern breaking.  Already developing a longer term plan to slowly start DCAing a cold storage stack if it does.  I've reduced my trading stack by 50% and moved to Kraken, something tells me i'll need to be able to short to make any money trading for the next while.
Every failed pump at the end of stagnation deserves a good dump.  (inverse true too)

Sold 70% of my BTC this week.

The clarity you regain upon selling a large portion is a beautiful thing.

I need a knife dip. Any conceivable catalysts this week?
Anyone trade OKEX futures here, that has noticed the unnecessary "My wallet" intermediary between futures and spot accounts?

In other words, you cannot transfer between future and spot accounts directly. You have to go spot --> MyWalllet --> Futures, and the same backwards.

On a similar note, you cannot trade crypto pairs. If you want to go from Eth --> BTC, you must go Eth-->USDT-->BTC

I can only assume this is regulatory nonsense, but odd.

On a trading note, futures premium is extremely low (ETH futures trading negative).

Charts:

Finex: https://www.tradingview.com/x/UwrxufeN/

Stamp: https://www.tradingview.com/x/3Jq9AKQh/

I dont have a large position here. This is not a good place to have any sort of clarity. I did hedge short on the breakdown of 7800 as planned, but have closed. I took a small Eth futures long at the -$20 premium at $565, but not getting excited about it at all. I'd love to see some charts for patterns that I am not seeing.

Frustrated of using  kraken because the margin pool for longs is always empty

Wary of using bitmex because the servers shit the bed so much

Don't want to put 10k to use bfx and 3.3 leverage is not enough 

What are the alternatives? I was thinking of trading with € on kraken since the margin pool is probably bigger than USD
[How long until it breaks down?](https://imgur.com/a/9KwxnHY) Edit: What I wanted to ask is simply: What *is* this? 
WTF is that?  The BGDs are running out of rocket fuel.
6930 to 6960 shall not break today right ? But if then rekt I guess ? What's the next support then ? 
People are really out for the weekend huh? Gdax volume usually spikes when there are huge drops. Not today.
Lucked out. Had a large stop market buy at 7450 and a large sell at 7600.  Also had a large sell at 7350 with a buy at 7200.  Glad that's over. Finally going to sleep.
Buyers need to push a new convincing higher high above 7650 or so to invalidate the hidden bear divs (bearish continuation) that’s been forming on 1-6H charts.

Unless a new local high happens in the next couple of hours it feels like the R/R for a short is improving again.

Edit: Breaking the descending channel seems like a tall order here: https://www.tradingview.com/x/I8Hx8VTD/
Sloppy started with some polls here and because I like them, I also have one poll for you:  [https://strawpoll.com/czx9fky4](https://strawpoll.com/czx9fky4) 

I want to know if you think the Bitcoin price is a fair price for what Bitcoin is at the moment, or if the price is too high or too low. This poll is not about if you believe the price goes up or down, with this poll I only want to know if you believe the Bitcoin price is in line with what Bitcoin is \(regarding aspects as technology, adoption, solid investment, etc.\) or if it is way too high or too low. 

Thanks for participating. 
Anyone else see a potential fractal forming?

We had a dip to sub 7400 yesterday, recovered, then green dildo to 7500

Then bull flag, dip to 7400 and another dildo to 7650. Currently in the bull flag, just got a fip to 7485
At a point like this, it will usually break in the most profitable direction for a margin position.

“Most profitable” can be defined in a couple of different ways:

1. Get as many people as possible following your position so that you can close in profit (regardless of long or short)

2. If you’re a big player and have decided a price range to buy in, then you’ll seek a move within that range that sucks up as much liquidity as possible with minimal slippage.

For option 1 the more profitable direction is obviously down. But the market stopped
at a very strange range just $200-$300 above the ascending trend line from 6-6.4k. That might be a signal that sellers are at least temporarily content?

For option 2 there’s obviously more liquidity on the sell side, which is ideal for big players that wanna buy.

All things considered, I think there’s a decent chance that this flag/pennant/triangle breaks up to test 7.8k

Buyers struggled all day. Seemed like mostly pre-existing limit buy orders at resistance points. Closed my 7,400 [long](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8lywrt/daily_discussion_friday_may_25_2018/dzjzt19/?context=0) at 7,480 for small (or non-existent) 80 point profit. Now short. 
closed my long positions at 7540; hidden bearish divergence on the 30 min and 1 h

https://www.tradingview.com/x/axCXV0s9/

So I'm thinking we're forming an ascending triangle bottom reversal here..
Have a short open from 7610 earlier on swaps, wondering if I should open another one for a scalp. I told myself I'd wait till 7.2 breaks with conviction but at this rate I just don't see how it'll hold a second time. On the one hand there could be a bounce at 7, which I believe is the bottom of a triangle formation, but I have a hard time believing anyone will rush to defend that if 7.2 goes down. Then again, I've been seeing weirder things all week.
Human psychology is funny.

People get excited about a 1&#37; pump...forgetting recent events.
Nice and quick, cooking dinner but

Edit 23:55:48 GMT+0100 (GMT Summer Time)

That happened fast, it would appear my triangle count is wrong in this case and could be this instead if we break down here.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/4lXaIH3n/

or we form a descending triangle instead like this

There's that Saturday morning \(Europe\) BGD again....
If this is THE dump, where will you exit your short?
bull trap to $7600 reminiscent of the bear trap to $6700 before the BGD? perhaps too early to call, but this bear pennant looks poised to break down

for what it's worth, the target of the bear pennant/flag is about $1k down. So ~$6.3k
i mean this is bitcoin so it could go anywhere, but looking at the 4hr it looks like a bear flag of a bear flag, and the 12 hr looks like the most bearish bear flag eu   
going long here is probably a bad idea by any objective means. Trade the trend
There doesn't seem to be much selling after this move up, volume is very low, which makes me think we'll have another move up soon. I think we'll go 7700 max before a real sell off and from there probably more sideways in this range. This really is starting to feel like a bottom though.

Edit: Seems to really want to break down, actually. Buyers just aren't showing up which is nothing too surprising given current sentiment. 

Edit 2: And now there seems to be a huge fight happening. At least Bitcoin never ceases to entertain!
I'm as indecisive as the market. Got out of my long for BE and back to thinking I want to make sure I'm in a short for when this bear flag breaks one way or another in the next couple hours--can quickly bail on it if it doesn't pan out.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/eWtnLUKt/

there is no momentum because all momentum traders have been barted out of the market.   
Can anyone elaborate on divergence of Jun and Sept future prices from swaps/spot?

u/SloppySynapses ?

i.e. just how far below spot could futures prices possibly go? I'm basically new to futures trading so I'm not sure of precedent. 

$100? 

At what point would you look at those prices and say "this is low enough, we've probably bottomed out"?

And is that even a reliable indicator?

Is it me or have sellers dried out their funds? Most btc circulating is due to bears selling and buying from each other. Interesting to see how the bears are beginning to implode in on themselves as time progresses. The majority of btc is either lost or kept by stubborn hodlers so it is only a matter of time before price skyrockets back up. Poor bears but this is the reality of the markets. No emotion, no loyalty and all greed
btc just broke the resistance

Somebody got sued because he used he word Bitcoin on a T\-Shirt. 
I'd be shocked if 7k held tbh, volume is pathetic.
I've closed 50% of my small long from ~7.5 at ~7.35 for a 2% loss, I feel like the price will keep going down from here in the short term and am looking for opportunities to add to this long at 6.9/7 (trendline from feb and april lows) with stops around and below 6.8. I'm curious as to whether others would suggest fully closing the long position at these levels (for 3% loss) and looking for entry opportunities lower OR leaving the long open and adding to it to average out around 7100. I'm strongly of the view that the market bounces around the 7k mark, though think it will happen over the course of several days per April rather than a quicker bounce like Feb. If price finds support at these levels and 1D MACD flips i think a move of 20%+ is in order. Comments/criticism welcome.
Everyone pretending like this isn’t just another bart. Cmon people. 
So where's THE dump some were mentioning earlier? Weak.  I'm going long 7280 3x. See you in a couple days when it's time to gloat about my gain!

Good morning guys, I just added 19% to my long at $7,538.  
Was feeling a bit nervous holding my underwater $7400 short for a week. Glad it seems to be turning out good. Hopefully we take a nice downturn here into the mid-6k's. 
Fractal

The next nice swing trade target now if longing is probably going to be at 6k where there would be potential for a double bottom from early February.  But getting there would already confirm a triple bottom that we're working on now -- the price ceiling/long profit potential from 6k would be 6.8-7.2k assuming the trend from ATH continues.

If it's any consolation right now is that since ATH, each month has oscillated from green candle to red candle.  If pattern holds up we're due for a green June?
Again, per the weekly chart we are testing a triple bottom this week in which there is no support until 3.2 - not saying it will get there in a week/a single candle but the chart suggests this is now a plausible target at some point this year.

8.5 is going to be a very tough resistance for the rest of the year.
Have to say interest rates are the strangest thing ever. On the way up, they were flat until after 8.6. Now interest rates are flat even though the price is down almost 25% from the top.

That said, since interest rates are flat, it's still worth holding short cause there are still people out there that believe in a bull run.
Does anyone base their buys or sells off the books? Like if there’s a huge order or huge sell placed? How much fiat would be considered a large buy? I see a 300k on the books which seems big to me but I know there’s a lot of millionaires here. 
If this is the breakout of the symm. triangle we are in... than we are basically out of steam and more bearish and weaker than i thought we would be.  This will be consolidation, Algorithmic trading  barts all the way untill we break down.

Gotta be a damn fool to be longing under $7000 as everyone else is bailing. Price has been falling for 3 weeks now. Hit $10,000 and hasn't been bullish since May 4th

Best case short term bounce still in play. https://i.imgur.com/zgum7Ss.png
I do love a good Bart. 
recently you'd get a nice bounce up from the 7.2x range.  not happening right now.  This does not look good.
Damn, I hate taking heat on my short.  I'm not sure where to put a stop.  I guess would start scaling out of it at $7650.  I'm way too confident that it's coming back down, but not going to lose 10% before it does if it's a mega bounce.
Test 
Looks like a bit of a shooting star there, twice rejected hard today at 7600
Not that much has happened since the half bullish try to breakout this morning but the bulls doesnt seem to be giving up just yet. But if we brea down under the trendline of the bear pennant then there might be no going back for the bulls atleast until mid 6Ks or lower because I think then the pennant will breakdown and judging by the pole the target is 6.5K ish so. and by then we might have broken the last months bullish trend, which would be bearish AF. Judging by the decreasing volume it seems like a classic bear pennant or else we go up to retest 7.8K

Also I think that a short play here with stops 1-2% above the trendline has some pretty good R/R

Oh boy, it's the BGD. Prepare for dump
What are the odds of $7000 holding for the next two weeks.  I would have to put it at about 12%.
What are the chances there's a bunch of drunk American trust fund douche bags (it's a holiday weekend) sitting around with their douche bag friends saying "watch me fuck with the value of Bitcoin" who then market buy /sell a metric shit-ton just for shits and giggles? Because I'd Totally do that if I was a trust fund douche bag. Is it that easy?

Edit. In drunk and American. Absolutely love the downvotes. Sorry for saying metric because I know how hard it is to convert
very "natural" price action

Edit: my SL at 7470 got triggered though. Going short again from 7572. Stops above 7650.
Game Over
Bart up, bart down, not done dropping. Droppin bombs ova Baghdad.
Still have my short from 14k. We will have a ways to go on the downside. 
Market ups and downs dried off after us investigation news came out. Market makers cashed out and not interfering anymore?

Forming a W shape on the daily RSI, short term reversal is on the cards. Last time we had one was in april.

Well i saw that from a mile away, too bad i can't short using binance. Anyone know a good exchange for U.S. residents that allows short selling as well?
I'm seeing a potential inverse cup and handle forming on the weekly.  Too early to tell yet, but if it plays out, we're headed for ~6.8k before we hit a bounce and reverse.  Then we start heading up to test 10k again in a couple weeks.

The introduction of futures has effectively put a lid on any future Bitcoin bull runs. The powers that be will use the futures to suppress price. This is all the chatter on wall street by people actually involved in the industry and why the CME and CBOE received such quick approvals for the product. Anyone "HODLING" and not seeing this is in for many years of pain I hate to say. 
As expected... Stop trying, bulls, it's hopeless.

Are you sure about that? Because honestly, I genuinely think that the run to $20k was an anomaly. I'm shorting, but not because I'm optimistic about BTC's future. I just see it as a way to profit from BTC dropping. 
I'm of that camp. It pains me to be a bear, but you gotta make that Bitcoin somehow.
Maybe projecting your own bias here.  I thought the rise to $20K was mostly manipulated bullsh*t the entire way, and I see no reason why BTC should be above $10K again, much less $20K.   The bubble continues to deflate.
I would advise putting a stop loss below 6850. Stop hunters will try to squeeze as much as possible. Below 6800, we definitely will have broken down.

now make one starting at the BGD from $6800
TA mastery right there.
YASSSS someone with a sense of humor 
BMXs very own TA PICCASSO right here
We also had hidden bullish divergence on some higher time frames (1D, 12Hr) a few weeks ago above $9k. It turned out to be an ending of our little rally. Showed me not to trust it. Could be just a trend change on the weekly timescale to Bearish. We *are* seeing a Bearish cloud developing on the weekly.
What about a BRD though?
Adapt or die, that's just how it goes. I'm actually surprised with complete lack of any progress there since the Circle acquisition, it's going to be a very expensive and a very useless purchase for them if they don't act quickly -- heck, it might already be too late.
1 year ago polo was THE exchange 
The closer we get to the end of the triangle the less coiled the move will be. it loses all its power if it meanders sideways out of it. 

The move will happen soon; we won't reach  the end of the triangle. 
Username does not check out.
I don't know shit about TA other than reading this sub occasionally, but I was looking at your graph thought it's funny how much early April to now looks almost exactly, peak for peak, as early February to the end of March. So if recent history repeats itself then we are right around April 1st and have about 2 weeks of 7000-8000 before a nice BGD.
You should let the bot know.
Tough to place a stop on a short with these contrary barts. Do you just accept that as a risk or try and set a wide stop? 
Do you not think bulls would be willing to defend 7200-6800?

EDIT: and if so, how eager?
Going long wont help anything man in the longterm. We need people who actually buy bitcoin ;-D.
Look at this date in 2016.
Can confirm. I used to work at a hedge fund. Most traders value their weekends.
Hey, dont tell me Im not smart!!!!!
Smart money trades 24/7/365, or as close to that as possible.

Not saying that's a smart way to live your life all the time, but smartest way to trade.
That's a good plan (probably because it's a plan, first and foremost) however nothing guarantees we'll break out of the giant triangle so 10k is a bit prematurate.
Why do you feel so sure the bottom will fall out in the months to come? 
From a personal perspective, I cashed out of cold storage earlier this year, and plan to keep it that way until I see several months of price stability, with price swings of no more than 200-300 dollars each way. I think the market needs that stability to allow people to start to reinvest with confidence. Why would people invest today when the price has dropped consistently over the past five months, and with the number of fakeouts that we have had?

In the meantime, I’ll be accumulating with my trading stack instead waiting patiently for the next run.
I'm pretty much following a similar plan myself,  lol. I'm not trying to FOMO these couple of % swings. Anyway, if your limit buys hit, I'm sure you'd have plenty of time to bail if shit hit the fan.  If you don't mind, can you share or PM your target?
Yeah there is good r/r for a long in my opinion but keep in mind that RSI can stay oversold for quite a while especially in a bear market and especially on lower timeframes.
What is RSI ..can someone explain it to me please
I’d wait. You may be able to scalp bounces. The pennant line around $7100 would be your best bet in the short term. Trend is still very much down until market proves otherwise. 
Why? Do you hate your money?

Just followed you on TradingView. Really clean, straightforward analysis.
Always appreciate your pnf analysis Merlin. Most of these degenerate gamblers have 0 idea wtf your talking about. As a student of Wyckoff, I've grown to appreciate a solid pnf write up. 

You sticking around a while?

Thanks Merlin. I'm taken aback by the number of idiots commenting under this and the number of upvotes they got. Too many amateurs in here. 

Question, what are the settings in your PnF? I can't seem to replicate on TV with $50/3box, tried all timeframes. TIA and many kisses
$1800 Target?
So based on this will you move your sell order to a lower number before it drops further?
Missed your posts dude, they are very insightful. Hope you continue posting again.
Lol here you dropped a /s
Due to limitations of the free notifications services i'll probably change how the notifications are sent and that might influence the subscription system.
I'll create a post about that in a bit. 
I'd be happy to build a Cordova app for both iOS and Android. Might be a bit of trouble getting the app on the iOS app store if it's not something that is gonna be useful for many people.

Another way of doing it would be creating a PWA out of the current position bot website and using service workers to deliver push notifications through the browser. 

Edit: actually the second option is a no go on iOS as Apple still haven't added push notifications. Shitcunts. 
RSS + IFTTT should work
I’m using the app Inoreader on iOS to send me push notifications on my iPhone any time the RSS feed updates.  

It works OK.  I don’t know why, but occasionally it will miss an update.

I also set up blogtrottr to send me an email every time the RSS feed has a new post.  This is reliable but with variable delays.  (I think this thing runs a query every 30 minutes or hour maybe, which might explain the delay).

No perfect solution yet, but these two are viable options to take advantage of the RSS feeds.  

(Both are free)
Or you can just send PM through Reddit. That would be easy.
People are way too careless with leverage. If they'd bet on 5x or less they'd probably end up with a decent profit from the same opening price longer-term. But hey, maybe they have enough money that this is no big loss to them.
I fomo shorted 7370 last night. Was chilling with my gf and diddn't check the charts. Instant regrets. But a buy order at break and god I'm happy that it hit.

I am thankful for the break.
[deleted]
what do you mean?
It certainly seems to me that adjusting stops based on fractals on the 4hr is the way to go unless you're just looking to scalp. So far on this drop from 8.5K your wouldn't have been hit once if you'd moved them down each time a new fractal was formed. There were a couple of close calls but nothing that would've stopped you out prematurely. 

edit: You can see this [here](https://www.tradingview.com/x/r1Nph9uo). On any higher time frame you would've been stopped out prematurely.

Looking at the charts comparing ETH and BTC vs fiat i see that ETH is making a more clearer bearflag. After looking at investopedia on their bearflag example this at 3-6h charts look text book like. Squeeze then dump. Also there seems to be a lack of selling just random buys slowly pushing us up.

well just my opinion but that flag is starting to get pretty low without any action, plus there's a bit too much bearish divergence for my liking. i got out of my long with a small profit, i will wait this out for now.

Head and shoulders is like a meme now.

We had a INVS H&S in the 8k range that broke up and was supposed to bring us to 9k and look where we are now. After trading many breakouts of heAd and shoulders, it’s safe to say now a-days they are more BS than anything 
DCA is the plan , agreed 
If that's the same iH&S macicpoopcannon pulled out of his ass for btc we'll see a failed rally on low volume to 800$ and back to 400$. 
Hmmm. Yeah, you are correct. There is also a H&S on ETH on the 1D. I can't pop any charts up right now but it's a pretty solid H&S.

bulls shoul be looking at this chart. going long thanks
I think the old one is still valid as we dropped below the line afer the peak. 
3.3x is plenty mate, they have a 10k limit and lev limits for a reason.

It aint casino mex
If you plan your trades ahead bitmex is just fine. The problem is if you don't plan ahead and panic close you're gonna meet a lot of slippage due to lag. Other than that Euro kraken is good, but a bit too illiquid for my taste.   
Also dude 3.3x is plenty enough to get yourself rekt
> Frustrated of using kraken because the margin pool for longs is always empty

assuming you have X>0 bitcoin now, you can [adjust risk/leverage as you like] always send 1/3X bitcoin to bitmex and go margin long on bitmex futures by buying 2/3X BTC/USD worth, sell the remaining 2/3X for EUR on kraken... now you have extra euros on kraken to actively trade (which u don't need to borrow from the margin pool) + u don't need to struggle with bitmex servvers

I think the requirement for finex was reduced to 1k, but i am not sure. 
I recommend (as you mentioned) to use the BTC/EUR pair for long margin.

It’s sometimes hard to find the equivalent support/resistance levels compared to USD as the EUR/USD value also shifts.

But if you rely on a system that draws the chart and lines for you like moving averages or the Ichimoku cloud system(instead of drawing lines yourself) you’ll be mostly ok.
I use bitflyer. You're limited to 3x leverage without a japanese bank account. Can easily move between btc and fiat. Registration is simple and support is very very responsive. Get onto them quickly during registration, provide your docs and they'll organise ur account quickly. Reasonable trading engine and very good liquidity. Zero trading fees for fx market.

Bullshit [http://bitcoinsperperson.com/](http://bitcoinsperperson.com/)

Its only physiology, low time preferences, lack of knowledge and money funneling into shitcoins, keeping the price down
the fair price for 1 btc is always the marketprice. if marketprice is 10k und you pay 10k then it is fair. if marketprice is 10k and you buy from your friend for 11k then the price you paid was too high. marketprice is always the fair price.
The only problem I have with your poll is that you need to define what "is" is. I think there will be a vast number of opinions on what bitcoin "is."
Chart it
I see so many similar fractals and I don't know which one is going to work out. I bet we can find tens of candidates 
Sellers don't have to do anything rn. Price stagnates = people cash out one by one, miners continue to sell, longs continue to pile in on hope of a divine intervention etc. 

It's up to the buyers to prove themselves, not the other way around. 

You can try to play against the trend by pre-positioning yourself in a long position instead of waiting for a possible breakout but what's the benefit other than satisfying your impatience?
Good call!
Follow the liquidity and they will come. 
yep, clear break of 7475 and we go up to at least 7.8
Those aren’t three rising valleys. Those are three dropping valleys. 

The link also states the pattern works in a bull market, which we are not in, as well as rising volume which we also don’t have.  

Looks more like a symmetrical triangle to me. 

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/symmetricaltriangle.asp
For the sake of my cold storage I hope you’re right.  But buyers will have to show they don’t simply give up after every small pump
Why would you long now just as we broke down from the bear pennant with volume ??

EDIT: currently trading mid/longterm not scalping but I can see the scalp long although its better to trade with the trend on a breakout not against as you can quickly find yourself underwater
Are you still alive
Yes this could BGD or BRD here, but just got to go with the general trend, and I'm short as well.
It's almost like they are afraid of the 7k test???
I think we may still be inside the bigger triangle (formed via a line from the previous two highs on the hourly). If it breaks above 7580  we could step up again to 7.7/8, otherwise back down to test lower end at 7400. Im looking for one more move up.
There are only a couple of cases where triangles function as trend reversal patterns. They normally operate as continuation patterns. 

Don't confuse cause and effect here, the reason it is observed that ascending triangles are bullish and descending triangles bearish is because a bear trend is more likely to produce a descending triangle than an ascending one, and vice versa of course. In the end, the result is almost always the same, they continue the trend.

It is worth noting and I've said it before, a triangle often marks the beginning of the end of a trend, it is often the penultimate pattern before a reversal.

Also not sure you can just ignore those wicks, especially the first one, the market spent a good 3 hours above the top line, it was not a flash wick and rejection.
isn't this more reliable as a continuation pattern than a reversal? I don't know much about patterns though so would be curious to hear more.
People are excited about $7500.  They will very possibly be excited about $3000 soon, when it is a bounce up from $2900.
You still short, bro?
What's your real entry?
Retarded, but I like it.
Last few weeks have pumped on a Saturday enough to make you think it is turning around and then Rekt on Sunday / Monday.
Taking a few percent of profits every *50, starting at the bottom of the triangle.  Not gonna even try to call a bottom.  Will just let these fill, and reshort/scalp on small bounces. 

Where I finally close out the position as a whole depends heavily on where my CA is at at that point, and if it feels like we'll approach it without still going back down.  But I have a feeling I'm just going to scalp it to death until there is little left and I just say fuck it.

I've already done over 50 trades on this one position since 8.3 without fully closing it out...  (why I've given up trying to share diligently, particularly with the bot)
If its THE dump id exit perps at 5k and sept on expiration or 2k. Whatever comes first
People have been throwing around 7.2, 7 and 6.8 and 5 - 6 range - I think where it stops might surprise all of us and won't necessarily be supported by TA.
Not here.  And it's impossible to accurately predict where going to cover.  It depends on market action. If the price falls off a cliff and goes straight down to $5000 in minutes, I'm sure not going to cover at $6800.

That is extremely unlikely scenario, but you should get the point.
What's this about THE dump? Why would that happen? I hadn't checked the price today until a few minutes ago, and it looks pretty stable. What intelligence do you have of a coming dump? The last one was pretty unimpressive and burned a lot of coins.
At the bottom, of course!
$5-6k
I was just thinking about how this bart was exactly what happened at 6400 before the slow and steady recoup and BGD
A bull's eye for a bear's eye.
Yes exactly.  They are playing games and difficult to defend against them. I almost covered some of my short above $7600 but held off and $7315 felt much better.  But I will reshort on a bounce or more weakness.  It's just dangerous to hold a long position in this market for more than a few minutes.

I strongly believe that bad news will pound the price below $6000 at some point, sooner or later.
Taking bullshit advice from this subreddit is probably a bad idea as well. Don’t let anyone tell you how to trade your own capital.

So many of y’all are trading at 8.5. Can I get an invite to this secret exchange? ;)
!short XBTUSD close 8521
I can’t say much about a precedent, since it’s hard to say exactly when a bottom has been found. However, I will say the futures were trading $100-$200 below spot in April on the dip down to $6500, so there is definitely still room to go down if you’re using this as an indicator.
On our last trip to 6400, I had an add on September futures fill at 61xx. I think June hit 62xx. 
I mean theoretically they could go as low as futures traders wanted to take them. 

as far as historical lows? I have no idea. I believe bitmex was founded in 2015(?) and had futures back then so perhaps someone who traded on there back then could give us insight into how low backwardation can go.

There's really no saying futures couldn't be $100-200 below spot or even more (more useful to say a 3-5% discount since the lower we go the more value $100 is in terms of %)- it just depends on the sentiment of the market. 

I personally believe that we are on the cusp of a market sentiment reversal in which people stop believing the asset will go up for a while and futures will begin to normally trade at or below spot and a premium will be rare to see, but again, I have no experience with bitmex futures during a "true" bear market (second half of 2014 to most of 2015) so I don't know how low futures usually go.

I don't know if there will be a reliable indication of when a reversal would be based on futures. But if you ever see futures go to a drastic discount, I'd keep an eye on things to see if we're bottoming out
> Is it me 

It's you
Sellers will never dry out their funds because miners have to constantly sell their btc to fund their operations. For the price to go sideways there has to constantly be new money entering the market. 
Say what you want but this bear is in the green on all of his entries. 
Its just you sorry.
> The majority of btc is either lost or kept by stubborn hodlers so it is only a matter of time before price skyrockets back up

I too believe this phenomenon is true. No hodler thinks this is bitcoin's "final price" so they're stubborn to sell at this prices and some will even accumulate if possible. Bear whales try to drop the market based on "technicals" but gets harder and harder over time.
True specially when price dips below 7k.
"The majority of btc is either lost or kept by stubborn hodlers so it is only a matter of time before price skyrockets back up"

This is the most retarded logic I think I've ever heard. I'd say the majority of BTC is held by people looking for gains exceeding the stock market. When that stops happening, ie now, you witness the result.... 
Poor you 
yep pretty clear break
wow
Le resistance 
He didn't get sued, just a threat.
I have no stake in either side at the moment, and I agree that volume is pathetic, but at the same time, couldn't a case be made that there would be similar indifference on the sell side?
If volume is low that doesn't mean the market is much going down. It means it's not much going  in either direction. 
Further thoughts..I think there is a strong bullish case to be made at these levels. If the trendline from Feb to now ignores the wick down to 6425, we have more points of contact in april and would indicate potential support now at 7.15/7.2. Combine this with oversold 6HR-1D and decreasing volume and given we're already down 25%+ from 10k without any significant bounce since lower high of 8.6.

everything tbh
7650, 7800, 10k downtrend up at ~8200 at the moment.
I think the major resistance point is the complete lack of follow through from buyers after these pumps. It’s either going to take a bigger pump or several in a row to awake interest again and push us through the aforementioned levels
7.8/8, 8.4, 8.8
Genuine question, what’s the reason why you think we go higher from here?
Hopefully you grow a brain and realize that shorting Bitcoin is something only losers do. Long with low leverage and be patient. That's how you win.
It isn't a triple bottom until we close above the highest peak at 11,700. But let's hope for the best.
What's more delusional, believing that Bitcoin might go on a bull run again or believing that the price will go down below $1000 and stay there permanently, as you've said many times?
What "interest rates" are you talking about?
Wow what made you correlate the two? Such a great mind. Wish I could think with such inspiration 
No, the buy/sell walls just get moved constantly. I.e they arent trustworthy
For short term trades I will calculate approximately where I want a limit order to go then look at the books and usually try to get in front of a large order.  For stops I go the other way, try to hide behind a larger order.


If your intention is to get your order filled and not to spoof then keeping it off the books is often the most logical way to go.
I should be a millionaire, but managed to screw it up somehow.  Well I was for a little while in Dec/Jan.

Yeah everyone is like I will buy 6.9 because it's guaranteed to hold but when the time will come to pull the trigger we'll see the true HEROES.
This volume is horrible, whatever happens is almost meaningless at this point.

Was just a little stop hunt. Look how quickly the price came back down.
Sorry, I don't see that. Please try again...

Right now, there aren't many buyers actually interested in pushing the price up. Day traders don't care up or down, you can make money trading in either direction; long\-term hodlers who genuinely believe in 50k\+ per BTC at next halving or whatever are happy to see prices go south as they continually add to their positions or look to rebuy after selling somewhere higher \(but it's not like they're committing millions at a time during times like this\). The questionmark is the supposed 'big money' \-\- the most likely theory \(if you believe in big money actually buying into crypto at all, which is not something I am going to argue here one way or the other\) is that this 'big money' would need to keep prices suppressed and in a boring sideways / bleed state such as this for as long as possible to accumulate without driving prices up or pushing it down too much. It's either that, or there really isn't much of 'big money' interested in crypto. 
> There are so many new customers

That's a weird way to say greedy gamblers.
Nothing says that this market should be going up if you look at the year chart. Look at where the price was one year ago.
What new customers? What numbers have you been researching? And what do you mean by “everything says that this market should be going up”?

Is this comment intentionally cryptic? Because I don’t even understand what you’re basing your argument on.
Would you care to share the research? All I hear is that people are getting out of the space. But I do not or do not want to belive it.
Huh we had a 200 green dildo today? if you posted this on the 22nd sure, but today, nah fam nah

Yes because that would involve really, really bad news that would sink the market for a long time.

Did you know that 60% of statistics are made up on the spot?
if it was, would you really want to invest in bitcoin?

but no, I don't think that's what's happening.
Even better is when they sell a shit ton of Bitcoin to themselves with a wash sale.  And profit from their high leverage futures short at the same time.
It's only natural if it's going in the direction you want it to.
Yea when we it drops 2.5k for no reason its natural but when it pumps 100$ OMG ITS MANIPULATION!!!!
like the dumps were so naturally organic!
I dunno, man.  We were nearing a break so one way or another it was going to be a big move. I know I had orders set for either direction of the break.
get used to it, the pumps are random and come in spurts, the selling seems to give you a chance to get out
If your SL got hit then you can imagine all the other people whose SL got hit. It is natural.

Gotta say, seeing June futures trading 40-50 below spot is a scary sight.

Your after the fact positions are uncanny! 
I'm curious (as someone who doesn't short) how much does it cost to hold a short from 14k? Aka... how much does it cost to hold a short for ~4 months?

Great trade, btw!
I find it so amusing the way people on this sub pull predictions out of their asses for the sole purpose of suiting their positions. 
The news had no impact imo
I've been wondering about that myself.  Seems to have quieted down after that news.

Their tactics only work if everyone is trading on exchanges, if you take physical possession of your bitcoin into your own wallet it cannot be manipulated.
You grossly underestimate the volume of btc not trading on exchanges
This is a meme/myth.
Evidence?
other than the price as evidence (the price has dropped since the day they opened) can you point to any articles that explain this?  I recall the camp was pretty much torn on this last year with a lot of folks saying that it couldn't happend cuz of cash settlement or whatever.  In cash now and I've invested way too much time reading and watching charts the past 9 months to hang around much longer if this is the case.  Sure, one could trade but i am not a trader.  Just want to buy and hold, but i can do that at vanguard if they have a lid on this thing now.  just like gold i suppose.
This is what people said about the ability to short bitcoin on Finex, and then the price went to 20k anyway.

Maybe there will never be another moonshot, but it’s not because of the existence of bitmex and other futures markets. 


Well, it doesn't look like they're trying really. The bid side has completely retreated.
yes, because this forum of a few thousand active users has any bearing on market movement. grr bulls, le stop buying bitcorn >:||

Crypto is no place to be cryptic. 
what's your position binary?
tldr
I doubt that's a real transcript of a bilderberg meeting. You should not believe everything you read on the internet.

Anyway this is out of place, stop flooding this page and open another thread.
Kinda silly that this is downvoted, this is a totally legitimate opinion to have. 

Do people really think everyone shorting stocks *secretly* believes in the company's potential future earnings? 
That's because you're clueless as to the reasons why something like Bitcoin would have value to begin with. I'd recommend you read John Pfeffer's [take on crypto](https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/john-pfeffer/An+Investor%27s+Take+on+Cryptoassets+v6.pdf).
Totally with you on the stop hunting, I am watching this tonight as it is (wont put a stop loss until about 5 hours from now, when I go to sleep).

Take a look at the previous bounces though, there are bounces anywhere from 6400 to 7100, and nothing too reliable. This purple line is 7000, and it isn't particularly meaningful from a support perspective:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/kiyRyHTL/

It does have my pink short term trendline going for it though:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/MH5YUOFv/

Support isn't really at 6850 either though, as you suggested should be a confirmation of a breakdown (I disagree with you, I don't think it is confirmation at all). So the more I am thinking about it, the less likely it is that I enter a hedge short anywhere above 6400. There's just not a lot to go on. I will still be setting a stop loss below 7k, simply because this isn't a hill I want to die on if it's moving downward (risk/reward mentality, coupled with the pink trendline are the only things I have to trade on here). I just simply wouldn't know if I was wrong until deep into losses.

Cheers mate.
> If the market is dropping, eth will eventually come to heel.

Yeah, of course. My support line for BTC is 7050-7100, and I'd close everything on a breakdown of that.

Eth has already overcorrected IMO (the same way it overshot the pump), the chart looks good for a R/R long, and the futures are trading at a negative premium. There is lots to like about an Eth long entry right now (especially since I primarily trade OKEX quarterlies). That's my trade reasoning here.

That in no way implies that Eth will remain "up" or even stable on a BTC breakdown, and I never implied that.
It's just the problem with being US based. They likely aren't allowed to be adding new coins because they are getting fucked over by regulation.
nah a year ago Bitfinex already took the crown away. Thats why I used 2 years, because back then it was exactly how you say, it was THE exchange, the one that drove the entire market
Username doesn't check out :/ used a meme
Liberal stops right now.. if you wanted to play it safe you could put [stops above the current down](https://www.tradingview.com/x/zDNV0euB/) trend line \(only two points so not much of a line\). 

If buyers decide they want to push above $7800 and move with authority towards $8k I'll close at a loss... but it's difficult to see this turn around considering how weak buying has been at such distressed RSI

I suspect we'll see a more enthusiastic bounce at \~$7k where many have buys positioned.  Both $7k and $6.5k will be a fight if we get down that low.  Below $6.5k, I have very little faith in a $6k double bottom.
I think we’ll get a strong bounce in the $7000-$7100 range. Less at $6800. Below and it’ll begin to freefall.  This will be a progressive dump ... with each stage feeling like it’s the last stop until capitulation. This is my bear scenario.  It’s still possible we recover and reverse at $7k but won’t really know for several days. 
Go long here (7000-8000). You'll tell your grandchildren someday about the time you trusted an Internet stranger and made a lot of money.
That's because those aren't 24 hr markets.
I never gave odds on that outcome. But if the market changes upward, I can always buy in when we see that signal. 

So its a matter of preemptively buying as it drops (catching the falling knife), waiting for a buy signal if we see a bottom, or buying it on the way up.

Then its a matter of if you think this is a short term bear (a few more months) or long term (another year). Buying at any price now is OK if this is short term. Long term means you'll have plenty of chance to buy in again and likely at much lower prices.

I believe in long term crypto, but buying too soon could mean cutting gains in half or more.

I got downvoted in another post on this point, but on 2/5 dip, you had almost a full 24 hours to buy at sub 6k prices.

On the 3/29 dip, you had almost 2 weeks to buy at discounted prices. 

Our next pass may be even longer.... look at the 2013 bubble and you had about 10 months months at ~$200 price range before it went up.
> I'm sure you'd have plenty of time to bail if shit hit the fan.

???  How do you figure that?   You must be trading a different market than am, becaue I've seen many times when the bottom drops out on really bad news and there is no time for a graceful exit, especially on BitMEX.
Yah I know but at least I can exit during sideways if I am wrong. We are defying BTC's history here

It is generally considered overbought at values above 70 and oversold at values below 30.
relative strength index, it is basically a measurement of how "intensely" the price is moving in a certain direction over a certain period of time.

It's a momentum indicator- it tells you how strong a move is in comparison to the last ~14 candles on a given timeframe

Yes the trend is down but scalping a 100$ bounce is possible nonetheless. This is a historical low man.
Do you enjoy being emotional and ignoring data?
Its not my chart..I follow him tho..
Agreed, great to see your level\-headed analysis once again. How's life been?
Do you even know what you are looking at?  Or are you still losing with your 100;1 leverage on $50. 
In PnF charts the trend starts from the previous low and moves upwards and to the right.  
The price turned at 20k, that is obvious.

But the trend was still up and to the right.  Now that cycle is over because the price dropped through the trend line.

It is not like looking at a standard candlestick chart.  The change in trend is as much a signal of a new cycle as it is an ominous price change.

The Pnf Charts are just a different way of looking at things.


Before you make wise ass comments at least make an attempt to learn what you are commenting on.  But, I am sure you appear cool to the other lifeguards are the community pool. Oh look—some kid just puked in the wading pool. 
I think we are $50 a box here, but that goes over $100 a box at $10K and 250 at $15k.

$50 still might be a little light, but at this stage I am not going to go back and re-create the chart.
The FED put out a notice yesterday that the "cost" of a bitcoin, and therefore the price based on eletricity prices puts the current value at about $1,800.

No volume late at night so it just moves mostly sideways.
I will calm a bit down after this one.
I know. It's my saturday lottery ticket. I will lower my leverages if this one fails. SL @ 7552 for now.
Perhaps, I don't disagree that its a bit of a retrospective formation and it doesn't always confirm, nothing does.

Mostly referring to the bulls showing up and forming a higher low in the 560s vs the previous low in the 540s.  It doesn't mean we're guaranteed to reverse here short term, but its a data point worth watching... in combination with BTC knocking on the top of its trendline for the last 11 hours.
I see what you’re referring to, I do believe longer term we have more downside, I am more trying to predict if we have a short term bounce to the upside or just continuation from the equilibrium pattern we’re in now.

I think there might be a better short opportunity up at $7800 in the short term vs now at 7550.

Agree.

This seems to be a consolidation, as longer term traders/holders lose patience/nerves before the next rapid new entrant wave.

this is honestly kinda pathetic. I really thought we'd test $7800 and it'd be uncomfortable holding a short from $7600

but I'm probably speaking too soon. 

maybe we're entering the land of "yes, it's really this easy to make money!" by shorting though
6600ish is really the bottom of the support.

Amazing how he could see that as three rising valleys. There is nothing stoic about that guy's FOMO
lower TF RSIs are completely shot, it's good for a tiny bounce. Hopefully he's ready to cut it quick in case it doesn't bounce high

longing a bounce on oversold TFs is almost *always* a sure +0.5%, it's just fees and engine lag that will screw you over. 

Oversold TFs are more reliable than overbought because assets in general do not stay oversold nearly as long as they can stay overbought 
Ya, I guess, all things being equal, I'll go with the trend, which is down. But I'll switch long for a bounce at about 7,200, then re-assess.
hidden bearish divergence is very clear now, don't think we will go up; I might be wrong though 
It’s a trend reversal pattern. We had one break up at our first attempt at $7800 the other day 
If I’m not mistaken, we broke down from an ascending triangle earlier in the week. It would conceptually make sense for an ascending triangle to signal a reversal, but I believe it’s supposed to be more reliable as a continuation pattern.
From what I read it usually is a continuation pattern but can also be part of a reversal. Either way, it's meant to be bullish.
Most definitely. 
lol theres no way he caught that wick 
I've been shouting about this triangle for the last 2 days, simple extrapolation from a and c, Finex wicked it perfectly. Mex overran it but oh well.
lol

OP pics or it didnt happen
this guy fucks. 
I will certainly look more at oscillators than random lines
Yes, thanks. I’m trying to figure out what to look for before setting a stop. I hope there will be some time if the bottom is around 7000.
It was just a question of if. I wanted to be prepared if it where to happen. I am not sure of it going down under 6,9, and i most certainly don't know when. But I won't ~~colse~~ close my eyes for any of the scenarios.
So no stops around 6,9-7,1?
What panic do your foresee that would send it that low? Or is there some TA formation that you see? It's possible that it will go that "low" again, of course, but not likely. Too many dip buyers and the only fear is missing out.

What do you mean by "complete?" I thought flags are just ranges that an asset bounces in until it breaks one way or the other. 
Not many indicators to believe it's about to go up IMO, just flagging

Thanks for the info. I opened a short on swaps earlier, sort of wish I had opened it on futures though, so now I'm thinking of opening one (as soon as it's clear we're not bouncing back up) and just wanted to know how much lower the premium could go/if it would be worth it given it's already $20-50 below spot.
Feeling better about your short today? :)
Thanks for the reply :)
I get that we're in a downtrend, but this sub is getting more and more homogenized into a death spiral schadenfreude echo chamber. I think we all know that BTC has a floor and while we don't know where that floor is, it almost certainly isn't 0.

So yes, we're going down. Hopefully $6\-$7k holds, but if it doesn't, we'll just drift down for a while. We're sitting 65&#37; down from ATH; the majority of the downside is already gone. Do you really think your fam won't survive if BTC drops to $2k? If so, selling now is reasonable. Otherwise, just fucking chill out and let the cycle do its thing. I know it's depressing if you're holding BTC, but blindly shorting and trying to convince others to join you probably won't do anything; the market is so much bigger than this sub now.  


Edit: not directed at the person I replied to; I've just been seeing a lot of fear mongering lately of which this is a relatively mild example.
I thought you closed it, still open?
I'm not sure where either of you are getting your information, but it's seems like you're both telling a conveniently small story.
We got a grim troll here. Complements the more colorful usernameiforget nicely. Everything is delusional, retarded or grimdark according to this one.
It’s la. You suck at french.
There doesn't seem to be indifference on the sell side - at least not by someone who has a shitload of BTC.  Actually this highlights it is someone working very aggressively to drive down the price.  What better time to start dumping then Sat. night on a holiday weekend?  Clearly has been an attack for a week or so but this confirms it in my view.
Thinking from R/R perspective. Big entry at these levels and down to 7k with stops around 6850 would have downside risk of 4% and very significant upside potential. Given i'm moved a significant chunk of cryptos into fiat earlier during this move, I think opening a large long with that fiat would hedge against the opportunity cost of an upside move whilst in fiat; and a downside move is partially hedged by that fiat...
"I think there is a strong bullish case to be made at these levels"

How anyone can put forward a bullish case is frankly beyond me, trend consistently down since Jan, interest down, hype pretty much gone entirely. We're going back to pre hype levels of May and June 2017.
What if we're all Satoshi?
Ah ... nice catch!

I think there is a lot of buying power in the market right now.However, traders seem hesitant to buy. The green candle we saw this morning gave me some confidence. 
Cool story bro. I made six figures shorting this year. If that makes me a loser, then I'll take it. 
I never stated my timeline for the latter and it could go on another bullrun and bubble. Just not this year. Probably not next year either.

Thanks. Is there any way to correct my input on the bot?
"long-term hodlers who genuinely believe in 50k+ per BTC at next halving or whatever are happy to see prices go south as they continually add to their positions or look to rebuy after selling somewhere higher (but it's not like they're committing millions at a time during times like this"

- complete unfounded speculation

"this 'big money' would need to keep prices suppressed and in a boring sideways / bleed state such as this for as long as possible to accumulate without driving prices up or pushing it down too much"

- the price had dropped >50% since January. But most importantly, if institutions intend on entering they will have been buying for many many months prior to any kind of rumour appearing in the news, through subsidiaries, connected funds, whatever. You do not announce to the world your potential intentions to buy an asset wholesale prior to doing so. 
2 cups 1 bear?
All the news for Bitcoin has been actually very positive. With that being said, I still think we'll end the year below 1,000. When I tell people that, they think I'm nuts kind of like how they thought I was nuts when I said early last year the bubble will take Bitcoin over 10,000.

I did not say dumps were natural. I never even compared pumps and dumps. I was speaking about this particular candle.

Those dumps had relatively better volume before they happened. But I agree with you, we are dolls in this game of big fish.
Yeah, just look at the volume at 15m and 5m though. That skyscraper surrounded by dead candles.
Yeah, my loss was not that bad. And I am in a good plus after this week. Will see where the price goes now. 
I was checking the number of shorts before this green candle and it does not look like many got closed or liquidated.Is there a way to properly check how many shorts got liquidated in the last hour?
I didn't even notice that and yes it is scary.
can you explain the ramifications of this?
Honestly I believe it’s possible it able to enter positions that good through bitmex, I can’t wait till I’m able to pull that off, gonna go 75% in 50x around 5-6 k area.
If it's a short on Bitmex, futures are free funding\-wise and if its on swaps he likely made money on funding, as it tends to be paid by longs more often than shorts. On Bitfinex, it would have costed him roughly 6\-8&#37; of the position's value.
Already priced in. The public announcement caused a dip to mid 7200. Since then no more large price movement. Selling and buying pressure has all but evaporated.
Yes, it seems that these last pump to 10k and subsequent dump  was one last cash out before going under the radar. Market then left to its own devices.
Same amount of money, but potentially less bitcoin 
I did put some money where my mouth is. But, nevertheless, it took me a while to give a hope and realize that after two attempt to bring back the bull, the fail of the third time, got me convinced 6.4 k is not the bottom.
kraken leverage trading is shit, its complicated as fuck and the UI is total garbage
You actually don't think we'll ever test 10k again?
Tell that to people holding gold and silver..They'll disagree...
I don't but the volume of stored BTC really has no bearing on price manipulation through derivatives. 
why?
Keep believing that. Funny how an ETF for retail investors keeps getting denied over and over but a highly leveraged "cash settled" futures contract gets the thumbs up no problem...but you keep believing it's a myth....
My brother in law manages a large futures firm. His firm puts on complicated trades for customers who have various hedging needs (airliners, manufacturers, banks hedging interest rate risk, ect). They are experts in the futures markets.  The second Bitcoin futures was even mentioned in the news, he said to me "Watch how fast this product gets approved and watch how fast the price takes a dump". That's exactly what happened. He's pretty sure price will be suppressed for years to come since it's a cash settled contract. 
While his post is just noise, I don't think he thinks he is manipulating the market, just having some fun and talking shit.  Lately I've also been tempted to just shitpost about how pathetic the buying pressure is too.
How's your long ?
doesnt look like its headed for the moon, something happen? ive been away from watching the market for a minute. not sure whats going on
And then make the T-shirts :)
It's very possible actually, supply and demand nothing else is moving the price.
I don't know if possible. Just curious to know if others think it's possible
Edited, it's way past my bedtime. Just the whole.. BCH inside job thing got some gears turning
Long every dip

(Serious) 
Super long. I accumulate BTC during corrections with fiat earned from other revenue/investment streams.
Interesting read, thank you for posting this!
Afaik on my chart there is not ANY kind of support after 7k. The best one could hope for a is a supportive downtrend ala 2014 log resistance turned support. I did mention below 6850-6800 because a lot of volume was traded in that price range. Not really indicative of horizontal support levels but something to consider. The purple support line also is not really reliable with its 2 (if we are generous 3) touches

I am not agreeing with your trade at all since we just broke down on the 4h out of this bear flag.  But ultimately it's the bulls last hope except for a wild horizontal support appearing around 6.5k or 6k. The target for the flag is also AFAIK pole length (8600-7250) - breakdown price (IIRC we broke down @7400.) Would put the potential target @6050.  RSI doesn't really have room to go down there in one go if it doesn't want to set unseen lows though.

I wish you the best and I hope this doesn't read as biased since I'm not in position anyways.

Look at alexa.com rankings of exchanges. Bitfinex is a minor exchange. It does have volume, but no one knows how much is fake. Actual users hitting the site is way less than other exchanges, including poloniex
Nah, in June last year, polo did 181k BTC volume on the ETH/BTC pair
It was THE shitcoin exchange 
👍
I believe you meant stranger, but this seems to check out
>On the 3/29 dip, you had almost 2 weeks to buy at discounted prices.

The only problem I have with this way of thinking is back then, everyone was sure there'll be plenty of time to buy at even better prices, then we randomly moved up 10&#37;\+ in like 15 minutes. Not saying that's likely to happen again; the market definitely rewards patience more than anything lately, but yeah. It's definitely possible to take the whole, 'there'll be a better time to buy later' thing too far, too. 
But each time the "discounted price" has been higher. We are making higher lows on the weekly charts. If we crash through 7000 again into low 6000 or below this pattern changes but so far it is true. 
Just set a reasonable stop under a horizontal support or trend line?
Yup, in my opinion I would definetly have a long from here, (I don't have any money right now though).
RSI went out the window only a few days ago when we fell below 8k. But I'm sure you know that. Trade safely. 
I get ya. There will be good scalping ops between here and whenever/if the bottom falls out. 
I have noticed that ALOT of the resident bears are becoming married to their positions
*If you can't handle me while I'm emotional and ignoring data then you don't deserve me at my best.*
Wth are you talking about?
Ah I see, thanks for the explanation.
Thanks for the lecture bro
That is absurdly low against every other calculation I've seen 
Completely irrelevant since the supply rate is fixed.

Nice post as usual though.
Interesting. I'll have to keep my eye in that in the future.
I got that part but taking a look and maybe updating your expectations versus changing your actions can be different things, right? 
Wondering if there was enough conviction in the updated trend to cause a change in his prior action of setting the ask price higher. 
Haha, I think he changed his comment a bit.
Yeah you're right, could just install an APK or IPA downloaded direct from the server. Might be a good idea to see if people would be happy to do it like that though. 

There's a few services that can be used, I've been using GCM lately in an app (Google Cloud Messaging), it's easy to set up and can be triggered server side with simple GET requests. 


Cool.

Hey I never figured out how to get the pushed app to work with your site.  Is this easy to set up?  I’m willing to use the paid app if it works instantaneously for position updates.  
Right... It limits Max users and you have delay after each message.
It's a Bartman
WOW

From my understand, all that happens when volume drops off is more volatility either up or down depending on larger players wanting an entry or exit... or yes, manipulation attempts too.

We basically have no serious precedent for these price ranges other than a couple times in the past *year.* I honestly don't understand why you're super confident.

I'm a holder. I'd love it to go up and this be the "bottom", but try to keep your mind open to other possibilities and play out what you'd do in those scenarios, should those things happen. Let's just try to be intelligent about it.
!RemindMe 9 Months "Was it a bear market or was it a bull market?"
May want to work on your reading comprehension or sleep a bit; the word "not" generally reverses meaning of a sentence
i'm gona be patient here, long stops
Why does that make you sad?
It's always day somewhere.
There is resistance right below and ETH is holding ground. It's a tricky position to be in.
lol wut?
Sorry, functions would’ve been more accurate, haha. Nonetheless I love them so thank you for your effort! 
Awesome man! Thank you.
Might take two or three... Markets have calmed down a lot, shaken the hype buyers out, but not enough to really stabilize.
Rude m8.

Not my best trade. But I've already bought a little back, lower.

And after this, I may not trade any holdings until post-halvening.


I think it means: "I'm sensible and have taken action before we roll all the way back to may and June 2017 pre hype prices"

Still there will always be people like yourself who feel it's honourable to be bagholders. 
Don't think you need to be verified to transfer btc to them and trade. I've been there for over a year and I'm not verified 
> maybe we're entering the land of "yes, it's really this easy to make money!" by shorting though

Until that happens on a large scale, I don't see another bull run happening.

oh yes! I've been watching that channel too. My bad 
I believe the Cyber punk revolution is happening, so how it does matter 20 ish years from now, and I can delay gratification for years.
Is it a currency? Store of value? A hedge against current economies? Technologically is it the protocol? Because right now it would be a risky investment, and therefore overpriced, for anything other than the protocol. People invest large amounts of money because of the technology. 

Maybe overpriced is the wrong word. It wouldn't make sense to buy bitcoin as a currency or store of value quite yet, so it's not overpriced, per se, but wrong product. Go buy gold instead. 

However, technologically, is BTC overpriced? That would be an extremely hard question to answer. That's like asking someone in the 80's if the internet is overpriced, or worth it. Maybe? But my guess is probably not. Technologically it is probably underpriced.
My man
Lol yeah, according to that link we would need a break over 13k for the pattern to be confirmed anyways. 
Looks like we might just go sideways for awhile until the RSI resets
we'll know in the next hour :)
Would you be so kind as to provide a chart for this?
what's your read on this, CG? Seems like it broke out, but volume is doo doo. We going up?
Mex swaps did get to 7640 so maybe it's a legit number.

I'd give him the benefit of the doubt if it's a quick thing like that while he multitasking, and he just eyeballed and approximated all the reporting.  I am curious though what he managed to snag in that context since clearly it wasn't a limit order.
Beautiful man!

Yeah this triangle has been real kind on managing the R/R.  Have never been more confident in SL placement, even able to sleep on it.
A major crash is not likely unless Bitfinex/Tether gets taken out or the USA/EU makes a bad ruling about crypto...both are very possible though.
You mean a limit buy? 

And no, I'll be watching to see what happens with the bottom of the symmetrical triangle but I've been of the opinion that we will break down below $6k since like March 
I could give you all sorts of reasons, but in general I believe the rejection from the tops of our range has been much more intense than the bounces off the bottom. and the symmetrical triangle breakdown would actually suggest a longer term target of somewhere around $3-4k, but there will always be bounces.

I've been saying since about feb-march that this is how these bear markets happen- longs/buys from sub $6k have never had their hands tested. They have only ever been in the green. As the price nears their entries, they will sell, despite having been up 100-400% at some point. 

How will it get there in the first place? Lack of new money, interest fading, boom-bust cycle, etc 
Lol, you must've not been around for 2014. Dip buying doesn't mean shit if it's not sustained. It would be a miracle at this point if we didn't *at least* go down to $5K. I'm thinking we'll bounce there but proceed down to $2K-3K over the next few months.
Eye gouging begets eye gouging begets eye gouging.
Big part of the few big miners last few years. Bitcoin is a centralized mining, decentralized currency. 
I have some problems with shorting when everyone thinks it a no brainer to short 
maybe I should have said "for the bear flag to form / be valid"
What do you mean by "other"
i warned you you it was feelin like a 7 coin now.

Deal. Just need to arb all day between our exchange and the normal plebs exchange ;)
thanks for the tip
Depends on how confident you are this will continue dropping. If I remember correctly, Sept futures were at $10.2k when we were pushing for $10k, so it can go the wrong way fast if this reverses. However, you can avoid funding fees by trading futures, which is why I typically trade there on reversals.
The spread should be measured in percentages, not fixed dollar amounts. A $50 discount at $5000 is a lot different than at 20K.
I got stopped out of the one from 7460 at a small loss (7510), but I re-shorted this afternoon at 7560. Pretty pleased with that entry. 
A drop from $7k to $2k would be a 72.5% drop... honestly, if you bought now and held down to $2k that would hurt your investment more than buying at $20k and holding to $7k.
"the majority of the downside is already gone"

You know this how exactly? Remind me of the price last April/May before the hype really began.
There's no fear mongering, and the sub is very evenly balanced. Sentiment is almost perfectly split. That's just  in the daily, too.. Go check crypto Twitter and other crypto subs like bitcoin and cryptocurrency and you'll see they're very bullish still  
>  I think we all know that BTC has a floor and while we don't know where that floor is, it almost certainly isn't 0.

We also know moon isn't $10,000,000.  And we also know that the floor for BTC could be well under $1000, depending on your time frame.
Still open and yes, I do have a target to close it. 
Oh yeah, I forgot of most are in it 'for the tech', 'because it's revolutionary', it'll 'change our world'. 

Well I hate to break it to you, but the vast majority are in it for a quick buck. As evidenced from January onwards, when the gains stopped and the gift stopped giving, the relentless sell off commenced and continues.

You might call it convenient, I call it reality.
I could *never* remember those at school. Seemed so random.
I think a bullish or bearish case can be made irrespective of the trend. The 1D chart since January indicates there is a chance we make another higher low here and we could then make a lower high around the 9.1 level as we bounce within the broad triangle before deciding on an up or down longer trend. I don't share your certain view we head down to may, june 17 levels. 
I have grown weary of Saturday morning green candles, as they are often followed by an equal red candle on Monday morning.
You said that Bitcoin is overvalued above $1000 and is destined to go below that number permanently (but stay above $100). When pressed for details about *how* you arrived at this range, you vaguely cited "regulations" and "use cases". In other words, you didn't actually have a valid set of reasons or calculations, much like the rest of the conjecture you throw into the wind. 


Yeah no kidding.  I got on a sugar daddy site for awhile and never knew how popular I could be with the young ladies.
Do you mean in the next 24 hrs or the next 24 months?   I look at the 1D chart and 1W chart and makes me very bearish.

Sign of a turnaround would be slow, steady increase in price that eventually takes out $11.7K.
I think it'll go down to the price of a tuna sub. Turnaround for me would be signalled by it rising back up to the value of two tuna subs.
I fixed it in the database, should be ok now
I'm confused. What exactly are you trying to say, that people with multi\-year investment horizons would blow all of their fiat right here and now to try and make sure the price goes to $7600 before it falls to $7200? Or that there isn't anyone left in the world who actually does weekly / monthly buys into crypto and puts everything into a ledger and is happy to forget about it for the next few years?

Which part of my comment was 'complete unfounded speculation', exactly?

edit: and regarding institutions, a fund managing someone else's money *can't* legally put any significant part of it into crypto without announcing that. Of course there's been crypto\-specific funds for a while now, but it's not like JP Morgan or something can just start buying BTC for their customers on the downlow. Either way, I don't really see which part of my comment are you disagreeing with. I'm not saying there are definitely billions of Buffet's and Soros's dollars looking to pour into crypto right here and now, I'm saying that *even if they were*, that money wouldn't come in shape of market buys on Bitfinex, it'd come in little bites with plenty of downwards pressure to offset it and make everyone sad and willing to sell their coins for a while. 
Are you trolling or actually that stupid?
So market dumping 2k coins and then announcing the FUD news 10 minutes later looks natural to you?
Edit : all I'm saying is both buying and selling is unnatural 
Not really. But I would also like to point out that most shorts are massively in the green right now - we are after all in the middle of a week-long downtrend. You are far more likely to see people closing their shorts in profit than getting liquidated from a ~2% pump after a 25% dump.
Yes, you can chart shorts and long changes from one bar to the next, and plot the difference. Then any swings become apparent. 
essentially what it should mean is that people expect the price to be lower in June. 

When futures prices are in backwardation (futures below spot) it means the general sentiment of the market is bearish. 

bitmex's perpetual swaps are encouraged (and almost severely financially restricted, up to paying 1% a day on their position size) to stick very close to spot price. so if people want to speculate on price going lower/higher in the future they trade futures. 

when futures are below spot it simply means everyone expects the price to go lower before the contract settlement date (June 29th)

it doesn't have any potential ramifications other than the fact that a long on futures could be potentially very profitable if we do bounce hard up from here (or at any point in which the market sentiment turns bullish). June was +$400 at $10k. that's a 4% premium compared to a ~0.5% discount right now. 

if you long june futures instead of spot and the premium goes up, you get a free +4.5%. 
Ok I suppose if you sold it all, you are correct.  I don't know how many holders and traders have the discipline to totally stay out of the market for several months, but of course some have.
I mean I don't disagree at all, I just think it's silly to point to old predictions. 

Although I get why you do it- it's satisfying. If you're not telling people where to short it's kind of useless though. For all we know you made two comments saying price will go up and price will go down and you just deleted the one that was wrong. 
well I guess that's why everyone uses mex then...
I can't speak for the other parts since I don't use leverage, but the UI is OK when accessed via trade.kraken.com.  But yeah, the regular site feels like what it must have been like to trade online in like, 1999.
It's straight to the buttcoin Target of $4 for him.
Not the same due to it being much easier to take possession of along with its use as a currency. As the amount of transactions continue to go up that puts more and more pressure on price due to transactional demand.
Could you ask him to point to any text that explains how futures suppress price? I'd like to understand the mechanics
Volume on futures in the legacy markets is insignificant compared to crypto exchanges.
I POST; therefore I AM.  
Lacklustre. Selling and bying, both.
thanks for confirming the only commonality between bears and bulls is their cockiness 
What moon ?

Of course. The S&P500 can also double overnight based on demand. Will it ever happen? No
It’s not possible. The biggest bubble in the history of asset bubbles got us only to 20k. 
He doesn't think markets are suppose to go down, one way binary,  all 11111111's no 000000's lol.
yeh i share that LT view. what about short term?
Yeah this is a gem that anyone investing in crypto should familiarize themselves with, imo.

Cheers!
> wish you the best and I hope this doesn't read as biased

No man, well thought out comment/discussion. I can certainly appreciate that.

Truth be told, the larger trade I am making here is Eth futures, as it has not broken down from that flag yet:

Eth: https://www.tradingview.com/x/x026Ow2J/

BTC analogue: https://www.tradingview.com/x/GtymmPvJ/

> But ultimately it's the bulls last hope except for a wild horizontal support appearing around 6.5k or 6k.

I'm not going to disagree with you on the horizontal support targets there (6400 and 6000 is what I am seeing), but I do think it can find support anywhere from $7100-$6000, as there is at least short term precedent at many places in that range. I just wouldn't count out any price for a bounce in that range, although it would be impossible to predict/trade it.

The more we talk about it, the more I am realizing I am putting faith into that hodge podged pink trendline, that is objectively not too reliable (I am recognizing my bias, because it supports my trade. I like the 7k intersection, and it looks nice to support my position. I can see it's not very compelling evidence) :

https://www.tradingview.com/x/kstUX6RG/

Thanks for the contribution/discussion. Don't be afraid to come off as biased if you're backing it up like you did. Quality stuff right here.



wat
Indeed, fixed!
Really striking how large the BGD looms in everyone's memory. There will be chapters in books written about it someday.
Yes, always possible to miss it, but you could also buy it once its on the rise. You don't need to hit the best price in order to make money off it. You can also average your buys as you see major drops.

It's a meme at this point, but there is truth in buying when you really think its a bad idea. When the market looks rekted, is usually when you get the best deals. I don't think anyone even remotely feels pain right now, we've hit worse this year. 
That can help, but if a black swan event or even just really bad news, the bottom can drop out and major slippage, even with a stop order.
Exited for 0.9% gain. The bigger picture is that we broke down a bear flag on the 4h. Higher timeframes>lower timeframes.
Yes but it wasn't historical. This is worse than anything in 2013 if you only look at the 15 min.
It's like the bull frenzy of december in reverse.
nah people always chide others when they long the bottom/short the top. people at $9.9k were like *WHY* would you SHORT this

I read it as a question: "is this not a shitpost?"
You're right! :D I should be assured

This is a tough place to make money :(
You're not wrong but I've noticed that the markets are usually pretty consistently slow by around 4-5am UTC. 
I closed @ 7511.5 now. Thanks for the advice. I see it going lower now. But it was probably the correct thing to do.
was talking about bfx
yea. I feel like when the norm is for futures to be at a discount instead of a slight premium is when things will have a shot at turning around. the price needs to really correct downwards and bottom out with a few V bottoms to show people that btc can sustain these exorbitant prices
In fact, I got it off your charts LOL
LOL, we're still in a long-term bullmarket. Monthly is still in consolidation. It's about 3 higher valleys. If we confirm this low, anywhere above 6.4. Then we got a good set-up for more. Ofcourse it will get confirmed later on. That's besides the point.
yes which is why I don't fuck with scalps, I just open positions when there is a confluence of oversold/overbought indicators on lower to higher time frames
https://www.tradingview.com/x/PP8ox1gc/

The “ Trend reversal Ascending wedge “ , this is from 2 days ago. I’ll add my post from it in the edit here in a second 

Edit: My post about it 

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8lggj8/comment/dzh82za?st=JHNNUVGQ&sh=3e5eca4c

It broke up to $7900 on Kraken lol 
I’m kinda confused by all this movement. It looks like it wants to break up with the bull flag forming, yet on the charts it looks like it’s setting up for a perfect bart.

We are sitting at the top of the symmetrical trend line so a short here wouldn’t be bad with stops over $7650 where we have been hitting resistance the last 4 days. 

I’m not going to trade this, but i expect some more consolidation here before a 200-300$ dildo in either direction. I want to open a long because my gut is telling me up, but the resistance ahead is heavy AF
It was a limit order set in advance, I've been moving it down slowly as the line descends and yes it was swaps I shorted here.
On mobile: where’s the bottom of triangle starting from the 11.7 top?  7200ish now?
I have a perfect solution for you; Don't! :)  
You can just stay in fiat and buy in when reversal is confirmed instead of risking your money.  
Or buy bottoms and sell the bounce. 
>one way or the author

upwards or downwards
it really does rn. $8k gonna start looking kinda expensive...just like 5 digit started to look expensive


I remember going from 5 digits to 4 digits and thinking it looked so odd. It's weird that I'm so used to it now.. can't believe we were at 5 digits for months 
Sept futures got to like $10450 or something stupid. Shit was redonkulouz
isn't it nice when stops actually work out?
Nice. I got chopped up a few times past two days opening some sketchy shorts and closed them very quickly for minor losses - but those add up. Got lucky today on that last pump to 76xx and opened a big one. Figured that the previous wicks up were a sign we weren't gonna make it through. Turned into a good position pretty quickly so I'm pleased and breathing easier again :)

Edit: Just opened up a little hedge long on June fut at 7295, will flip it short as soon as it seems like any relief bounce is over.
Indeed and fair, but that drop isn't guaranteed. The nebulous fear mongering is just bothering me lately.
I know this because 65% is more than 51%, which indicates a majority.
Looking at the 1D or 1W chart makes me more bearish than anything...just shows how much room there is to fall and still be up 100% in the last year or so.
Just out of curiosity, if it's gonna go straight up from here you have any stops before be to take profits, or you're gonna ride it again on red?
given the risks involved, and excluding those who buy for philosophical reasons, I'd say that gains that exceed the stock market/other traditional investments is a prerequisite for wanting to buy crypto.  A stock or an ETF can't be stolen from your brokerage account, and the NYSE or NASDAQ isn't at risk of being shut down by legislation.
I got into Bitcoin for the tech. Now I make seven figures doing something I love.

How’s that for reality

Edit: six figures... my bad
Oh there are use cases now?
Don’t give up on your sugar daddy dreams just yet. 
Ok let me ask you this, why do a lot of people feel the bottom is $6500?
¿pq no los 2?
Are you that dumb that you don't know what statistics are
Indeed.There's a reason the US has a new manipulation investigation open for a reason. 
Yeah, you are right :\)
Thanks!
I didn't even know this sub-page existed lol,
Kraken doesn't seem to even link it in their main menu
Sure. Here is a good article on some manipulation that went on with a cancer drug company. Although not similar to BTC and futures, it's a good read to show you the extent of how far Wall St will go to suppress price.

Search future contract gold price suppression, you should be able to find few interesting article on the subject! 
I wouldn't say the selling has been lackluster 
Well as all indicators are pointing towards a drop... I guess it would be better to just let it drop. Not hoping anybody to be rekt here.
The S&P and DOW Industrial Average are both higher than they were in 2007-2008.

100k is deff not impossible, especially if Bitcoin reaches global currency status
Biggest bubble in history? Bitcoin is just a minor footnote in a world full of asset bubbles. Did you look at the debt markets? Can't get more insane than the situation the world is in right now. Shit like what's happening in Argentine and Turkey is only the beginning of a much bigger deflationary period and yes, Bitcoin is going to undergo the same fate. The tech sector is fucking ridiculous and I'll short it to the ground once it starts showing weakness. But as I said, debt markets are the worst: individual, corporate and government. Once interest rates rise, the dollar strengthens more and zombie corporations start defaulting it's going to be a liquidation waterfall. 
I would argue that the shitcoins were in a significantly bigger bubble
You must be new to Bitcoin.
Not really. I remember in November he was selling everything at 12k or 13k or something like that and then when we continued to go up he said we were all batshit crazy. 
Ranging above 200 ema, capitulation left and right. If I was playing short term, I would scale in from 7,4 -> 6,8.
Thanks for being nice about someone disagreeing. Most people get crazy,

I wanted to post a chart of my own but since our charts are almost the same I won't do that and instead argue based on yours. 

> but I do think it can find support anywhere from $7100\-$6000, as there  is at least short term precedent at many places in that range. 

Correct. But there is a big but incoming. Volume in that area is low, price was being pushed that low by a significant amount of open shorts. We have the inverse of that situation. Not only that zooming out to the weekly reveals a descending triangle with horizontal support \(or let's call it diagonal = the purple line you are referring too.\) around the 6k\-6.5k area. Any other kind of support including the log line might be invalidated until we find horizontal support around the 3k\-4k range during a selling climax \(note: I am comparing to the 2014 bubble fallout here.\) As we've seen bears jump out the window in this market. Now we could label that selling climax the 20k to 10.4k drop or the 12k to 6k drop. But in the 2014 bubble cycle we saw a lot of these climaxes. And as you know the biggest drops happen during a short amount of time. Dropping below the weekly descending triangle is the perfect catalyst.

Now onto ETH:

I am always trading spot so I won't comment on Futures. What I will comment on is the ratio. We see that the daily RSI is pretty normal and that if we draw a trendline the upwards trajectory is still happening at a steep angle. Not only that, but we are still pretty close to the local top of the current rally, 0.085. Compare this to where we were 1 month ago 0.055. That is an extreme trajectory and we're still @75&#37; of the december high. What I am saying is, unless there are significant news releases, expect the ratio to go down and form a sustainable trendline.  Taking a quick peek at the chart 0.067 seems to be a good support level for the ratio. What you are doing right now is basically betting on a flippening again. Correlation between BTC and ETH has weakened significantly ratio wise. As it was in January when we saw ETH/XBT go on a small rally. Correlation strengthens the stronger the move in either direction is. You are either as you put it gonna die on the hill twice or come back from hell instead of purgatory.

That's all for now. Sorry for the huge write\-up.
> this isn't a hill I want to die on 

> I want to die

it thinks you're committing suicide mate
I mean, it's just the most obvious example. But there's been plenty of times when people sit on their hands thinking prices surely will go down, then it starts pumping and they're still convinced it'll go back down soon, surely any time now, and end up missing rather significant moves. 

Again, not saying that's gonna happen today or tomorrow, but that sort of complacency can be just as bad as mad FOMO sometimes.
It's just one of many. It wasn't unique. You can bet there will be another at some point.
I didn't down vote you earlier and I'm not now.

Reasonable discussions are appreciated.  I'm short right now anyway but even when I was long I liked your charts and reasoning.

We need differing perspectives or we will end up in an echo chamber, so thank you.

I agree with 2 parts of what you're saying that bear markets are actually bad not just for how fast the price falls but how long it stays at the bottom & that buying when market seems rekt is good as long as the asset isn't dead weight, like the buy when there's blood in the streets saying.
At least you made a profit, and that's really the most important thing! Good trade.
you mean 2014? 

how can you see the 15m in 2013/14? I want to compare lower TFs to 2014 all the time since the price action we're potentially going to start seeing will be much more like that than 2017, which is all we can really see anymore
Yes exactly.  There are big profits to be made if you catch a trend reversal at 
a local top or bottom, but it involves trying to catch a falling knife or fighting a bull market.
I never insulted anyone, I can't disagree without a lecture? I mean I've read many "predictions" and "calls" but I've yet to hear anyone claim the bear trend "just started" and frankly, this is an art not a science nobody's opinions are any more valid than the next.
None taken 
Sure
Nice
It probaly does is proper old english, but this is the internet if I meant that I would have used a ? in the middle of the sentence.
Don’t get emotional, buy your dips little by little.
Shorters don’t want to kill it, there more experienced in trading and making a profit while going down. 

Turn the negative into a positive. Isn’t the dip buying season for a hodler ;).

Would be nice to reach 4K 
Fair point, those times do tend to be sideways more often than not.
The problem is that it just takes a wick to liquidate you. That king of leverages should only be used on large movements to give you some room to breathe. The market is just to indecisive to be worth the risk

LOL my bad dude!  I thought it looked familiar but was like hmm doesnt look like a channel like that...
just curious, have you ever considered that the price may continue to go down?
Oh you are talking about this clear trend reversal ;)

Come on man, let's not kid ourselves here it won't help anyone make any money by doing so.
Nice.

I've been afraid to add to the short with a stale limit just in case it breaks up.  But every time I've had the good timing to notice the charts in a situation like this I've scalped some adds or profit taking.  Added this time at 7540, not great considering the better missed opportunity that you snagged, but I'm happy with the timing, and anyway I wouldn't have added while it was outside of the triangle.
~$6900
Thanks for advice ;)
I was joking cuz he kept doing that to others.
fundamentals have changed.. bitcoin used to have 5 digit tech now its got 7coin tech..  gotta do the research.  technology field moves fast.



Oh wow, didn’t see it get that high, though I did hear it reached as high as a $400 premium. It’s amazing that haserfauld could have held a long from 61xx to $104xx. Trader sentiment can get so out hand on these swings.
Hah, it's rare, but yes. I wish I'd just set them breakeven though. It was dumb not to. Either breakeven or above resistance. I think MEX wicked high enough that it would have hit anyway, though. Re-entering 1% higher was a decent outcome though 
My initial open was 7540 but I got an add in at 7595 to improve my average. Still holding the short from 8310 and loving the premium flipping discount. 
You're assuming most people bought over 15k which is false. Most probably bought from 8k to 13k. It's not even halfway down from 13.
I'll ride it out. Until my target hits, I'm not closing. 
> now I make seven figures doing something I love.

who pays you a yearly net salary of >1million if you are all day on reddit? ;)
Yes, you definitely make 7 figures from BTC don't you, you the confirmed gambler who openly stated only days ago that you 'just kinda wing it', whilst berating other users of the sub for 'being gamblers'. 

The delusions and hilarity are unreal, especially as those making significant sums do not shout about it, another user full of hot air.

But even better than that, going off your trade history and comments, you are pretty much universally incorrect in your predictions!
You don't think hard, digital money is a use case?
What do u think happens to your money if banks go bust? Boom usecase 
I had some fun with several of the women, but it lost it's luster after awhile. I'm old though and that is the main issue i'm not more into it now.   5-10 years ago, I would be getting into way too much trouble on there.  

I would definitely encourage younger crypto enthusiasts to check it out if you banked some solid gains and want to enjoy the fruits of your labor.
>  why do a lot of people feel the bottom is $6500?

because this asset has gone parabolic over the past 9 years. It largely goes straight up. People who entered in the past 2 years have never had to deal with an actual downtrend. Those that have believe that "this time it's different", which, if you ever find yourself thinking, you should probably take a step back and ask yourself if you're seeing things objectively 

in short: hopium and naivete
Look at the chart and that should be obvious.  It is mostly holders and bulls though who hope that last bounce was a higher low and not going to go back down there.

Even the thought that it will is laughably delusional. 
The rate of default in debt markets is actually quite small. Junk bonds will probably go through another wave of defaults but they also have a lot more covenants than before. I don’t think you know what you’re talking about comparing debt markets to Bitcoin.
Yes everyone that doesn’t believe in the pie in the sky fantasy prices is new to Bitcoin.

>That's all for now. Sorry for the huge write-up.

Don't apologize for the length; we aren't writing corporate emails here. This is complicated and takes some discussion. On to your points:

> Volume in that area is low, price was being pushed that low by a significant amount of open shorts

I guess due diligence makes me ask how you came to that conclusion. Let's get some evidence in here. Volume is one thing, but you're implying the breakdown wasn't organic because of open shorts? I guess your point is that it was different than other "support finding" breakdowns, and I have to see some compelling evidence for that.

> (note: I am comparing to the 2014 bubble fallout here.)

It's funny you mention that, because those are the horizontal blue lines in my chart (from a previous discussion with another redditor). Obviously I assumed we found the analogue *first* bottom already (at 6400) for the sake of discussion, and I put the bounce target (based on percentages) at 10.5k:

2014: https://www.tradingview.com/x/QftUVC7X/


Analogue now: https://www.tradingview.com/x/pAbkNMPR/

So in other words, if the breakdown followed 2014, **and** 6400 was the first low, 10500 would have been the top of the bounce. If it continues to play out in the same way, I can see $3k-$4k as you mention. Just recognize that so much is different now, and this is more of a thought exercise for me than trade reasoning. It would be foolish to confuse the two.

>I am always trading spot so I won't comment on Futures. What I will comment on is the ratio.

You're going to lose me there, we'll be speaking different languages. I only trade futures, and almost 100% of my trade reasoning is based on the spot chart/futures premium. I never trade the ratio, nor use it for trade entries. That's probably an area for improvement for me, so I'll look into it.

>What I am saying is, unless there are significant news releases, expect the ratio to go down and form a sustainable trendline

"News" here is relative (aka, what you think is significant VS what I may find significant VS what the market finds significant (the only important one)). Casper progress, Amazon blockchain partnership with Eth cofounder, OMG sharding tech progress, etc.). I personally think Eth **should** be on a trajectory to eat into Bitcoins market share. So the whole premise of your argument seems to be "If it were a "one to one" percentage movement, Eth is overshooting it". And I just see the space evolving as it should based on fundamental analysis and news. That's more investing long term VS trading talk, though.

Nice comments, man. I appreciate this sort of discussion.

Sure, but 4/12 was particularly well-timed to counter a prevailing bearish sentiment, and the orders that caused it seemed particularly manipulated and inorganic. Then again, you're correct that it's all coming out in the wash now...
Thanks! God be with us all if this gets more volatile.
I am actually only able to tell from memory. The lowest I've ever seen since I followed BTC was 14.08 or so. You can zoom out to 2016 and nothing gets below 14. This did however and was a clear buy that way. If you find anything to zoom out much more than please send me a pm.

Edit: I know I've said I haven't done this for long but I am referring to actual trading. This is a throwaway for a reason.

Stop using the word "fam", people automatically dismiss the content of anything you say as low quality when you speak like that. 
Or, enter your lottery ticket once the move is confirmed. Catch a dildo half way and ride it for a couple of seconds.
What about the stop loss. Doesn't that cancel the trade, and you only lose what you calculated as the risk?
I see no reason for it on the timeframes that matter.
I mean it broke up, which it was supposed to do. By the books it’s called a Trend Reversal, but we hit the bitch of a resistance in the $7800 area. 

It didn’t reverse the trend, but If you longed it and played it like it was supposed to, you would have made some money 
I had an emergency stop already in place at around 7680 just to make sure I didn't get rekt straight away. TBH I didn't think it was going to get filled but was betting on another fomo spike before death, I knew if there was one I could potentially get filled higher on Mex.

Bad habit of mine sorry. Oops... I did it again!

>Breakdown wasn't organic due to shorts.

That wasn't what I am getting at. What I was getting is that brute forcing a clear trend reversal will be much harder this time due to the low amount of shorts. I think we both agree that the BGD happened due to a short squeeze. What happens if there are not enough shorts to squeeze? What I am getting @is that the market had fundamentals in place back then, that would have made a short-term bottom likely. This isn't the case this time. 

>Just recognize that so much is different now.

Agreed but isn't it eerie how similar both charts look? I do not think that if we reverse trend here again we'll see a lower high again. The symmetrical triangle/descending triangle is make it or break it.

>News "here" is relative.

It's funny that you say that, after listing all the big events I am looking out for especially OMG's plasma implementation. I think the whole market looks for something to scale above and beyond. 

The problem here is that we are arguing about fundamentals. I was talking about 
TA here. My point was that ETH/XBT hasn't quiet retraced enough to keep the 
trend going up. There are three scenarios here.

-Ratio goes up and pulls BTC up or sideways 

-Ratio goes down and will go down even harder together with BTC.

-Ratio goes sideways and will follow a significant movement of BTC causing ETH to plummet or skyrocket.

I am not convinced that ETH is leading at the moment. That's why option 2 and 1 are somewhat vague. Option 3 is proven though by looking at a chart. 

Given the fact that ETH/XBT is going sideways during all of this I think option two is out of the picture.

Now it all depends on who is leading. My money here is still on Bitcoin. Which is looking rather bearish.






Yea i mean I believe you and a buy under $7300 was a free scalp basically. The scary part is hoping that RSI doesn't reset while going sideways $20 above your entry. 

I really wish there was more historical data. idk why they delete it, it can't be that much data to store...
Got the test notifications working, nice one. I think you need to add instructions how to subscribe to a user channel. 
Why fam why?
Yes, that is the best way.
Enter, wait the price to move a bit and set a stop loss on profit right away.

That way if you get stopped at least should be in profit or near breakeven.


If its a slow movement yes, but if it gets hit with a large market order, the slippage can be bigger. 

30$ or 40$ on 25X is a lot.
Wait for a juncture like the last BGD we had at 7400. Using that example, set limit buys at 7475, limit sell at 7510. On the other end, set limit sell at 7360 and buy at 7320. In that instance you've got quite a high liklihood of hitting one of them successfully - market was ready for a violent move one way or the other and it was bouncing within an ever reducing range
No, you should not have made any money on this break. The price didn't even make the resistance line, let alone the technical target. The best you do here is getting out at breakeven. If you don't let your trades run to at least your first targets you break your risk-reward system.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/xfFK4cbi/

Any money made here was luck more than judgement. To say this is a "Trend Reversal" by the book is simply not justified, the trend has clearly continued in the downward direction. You should look up "Fakeouts" in the same book. That is what the move up was nothing more.
My stop was 7670 :)

My existing CA actually got wicked.  Almost not regret having an order bear the ca to increase it, but I already had the position size and stop with the right balance of RR for not babysitting.

Thanks for sharing the nice charts.
there is like a billion more tethers in existence than there was back then

jokes aside, to be fair the has been a significant expansion of bitcoin awareness (but not adoption). surely that has to be worth something? I came in during the 4-5k region as did many
its more vulnerable to a 51% attack now like bitcoin gold.  Should have stuck to satoshi's true vision.

> It's not digital money, it's digital gold.

How so? It certainly acts like money from my perspective.
You think Paypal is money? lol
Not all of them at the same time. I mean if his bank goes bankrupt from gambling on speculation ala 2008 for example hes only insured for 200k or so, depending on country. Yes its the store of value meme but its valid i think
> Agreed but isn't it eerie how similar both charts look? 

Totally, that's why i was also charting those comparisons ( I spent a lot of time looking at both "bubbles"). I'm just recognizing that although it looks uncanny, it's really hard to justify a position based on it.

> I am not convinced that ETH is leading at the moment.

Neither am I...... Erm, I guess we have to define "lead" here, so we don't misunderstand one another. If by lead, are we talking about price? Ratio? Tech improvements?

I think ratio increases long term, but the Eth market does **not** usually lead the crypto market price in any reliable way that we (as traders) can take advantage of. So sure, we can adjust our portfolios based on this sort of discussion, but I find it hard to day trade on anything related to the ratio.
Since I upgraded my PC to a high end Coffee Lake & Pascal combo, I'm able to zoom out way more in tradingview. Also Firefox seems to crash and lag really hard in tradingview.

If you want to zoom out as far as possible I'd use chrome or any chromium build tbh coupled with only having one tab open. 

For me they don't seem to have been deleting data. It's just that I have to wait a long ass time for them to load more until my browser eventually crashes.

> its more vulnerable to a 51% attack now like bitcoin gold. Should have stuck to satoshi's true vision.

*HOW*, you dope? Explain *WHY* this is the case, FFS. 

(i hope you realize that BCash is far more susceptible to 51% attacks because it's hashing power is so much less) 
So is gold from a certain perspective, but no one accepts gold in modern commerce, because it's too much of a pain in the ass.
Well if I order a meal for my boss who owns bitcoin he doesn't reimburse me in satoshis, genius. Nobody does that. If I order something on fasttech I don't bother using bitcoin either. And if it goes back to 1000$, will you still repeat "store of value" like a mantra?

Zealots gonna zeal...
I do have to agree with his point though, people don't give a shit about centralization and will keep using PayPal and similar services as long as it's easy enough
> If by lead, are we talking about price? Ratio? Tech improvements?

In my example I was talking about price to justify a short term position. Leading in tech improvements at the moment seems to be a given. ETH seems to be much closer to a functional Plasma than BTC to a functional LN. 

I also think that ratio increases long-term. That doesn't justify the current upward trajectory though, **unless** we are on the verge of a flippening. 

> I find it hard to day trade on anything related to the ratio

I found that to be rather easy. The Key is exploiting bigger BTC movements to maximize profits. As I said correlation between ratio and BTC grows the more significant a movement is. Upwards and downwards that is. It's basically like trading BTC, but only the really volatile moves.

You seem to be someone that would hold alts. I guess OMG is one of those. If so great job picking the only actual model of working token economics.  I always wanted to buy into it too but I want BTC to establish a bottom first.

Nice talking to you. I'd like to continue but I really gotta sleep now. It's really freaking late already (UTC). But having an actual long discussion about TA/Fundamentals provides great insight.


Really? I have pretty decent specs, like 32gb of ram and an i7700k and I can't seem to get tradingview to zoom out without lagging significantly. and I'm using chrome

The percent of ***bitcoin*** miners supporting Bitcoin Cash ideologically is at an all time high.   Do you know what that means for Bitcoins "consensus" and hash power dominance?

I'll give you one guess...
bitcoin cash caters to its miners so they have no incentive to attack it.  bcore legacy lost most of its big miners due to its failure to stick with its constitution, the true vision of satoshi.

What makes Bitcoin a pain in the ass other than relatively low rate of acceptance compared with fiat? Are you really comparing gold with Bitcoin? Gold needs to be melted into appropriate units, verified, physically transferred and secured. I'm not seeing how this comparison holds up with Bitcoin.
How am I a zealot? I'm simply pointing out that it's laughable that you're making a comparison between what is ostensibly a currency and a payment processor. 

Also, I re-reimburse and get reimbursed with Bitcoin all the time. I can either open up the wallet on my phone or open up Venmo. With Venmo I have to detail the nature of the transaction to Venmo, with Bitcoin I don't -- one less step and additional privacy. Anyone I know who is a Bitcoiner either prefers this or doesn't mind. 

Also, *store of value* is not a mantra, you dunce, it's a fundamental property of money.

Stupid gonna stupid...
maybe it doesnt matter to retail users, but businesses and companies sure as shit care about the absurd charges that PayPal has that eats at their bottom line.. 
Is that his point? He seems to think means of exchange is the only property at play here. Unlike BCash proponents, I don't subscribe to the primacy of this use case. Store of value, immutability and censorship resistance (and fungiblity) are the bedrock properties that get the project off the ground. Buying coffee with your crypto is the icing on the cake but there is no pressing need or desire for people to switch from plastic or their current preferred choice of payment. Hence why the BCash narrative is doing nothing for the project. People simply don't care because the possible benefits are not worth the cost. 
Hey, I just wanted to send a personal appreciation for your comments. Detail. Quality. Reasoning.

Lmao, yeah I guess we should just blindly believe things Jihan says. Right?

> The percent of bitcoin miners supporting Bitcoin Cash ideologically is at an all time high.

Source?

>Do you know what that means for Bitcoins "consensus" and hash power dominance?

Uh, nothing? The proof is in the pudding, bro. Like always, your arguments are pure conjecture and not based in reality.

> bcash caters to its miners so they have no incentive to attack it. 

This makes no sense. There's less incentive to attack a larger network (which is Bitcoin, just in case you're wondering) because the monetary risk to reward profile is worse. 

>bcore legacy lost most of its big miners due to its failure to stick with its constitution, the true vision of satoshi.

i hope you realize that constantly saying "true vision of satoshi" makes you sound like a cult member. 

Also, Bitcoin *didn't* lose most of its miners. That's the whole fucking point. Bitcoin has the vast majority hashing power and BCash doesn't. That's why BCash is the alt and Bitcoin is Bitcoin.

Not sure why this is so hard for you to understand. Perhaps you're just a troll? I can't really tell at this point. 
and bitcoin doesn't have exorbitant fees..? o_O

businesses are paying paypal for customer service, support, a way to facilitate chargebacks, general payment processing etc. 

they'd be paying fees to miners just to keep bitcoin alive. there are no chargebacks, customer support, etc. They would have to do that all themselves on top of the already exorbitant fees
Which companies do commercial transactions between each other with Paypal?

If, as you say, consumers don't care to use BTC because Paypal is safer, faster and cheaper (I agree), 'businesses and companies' have no choice but to use Paypal.

And IMO, said businesses are more worried about the unpredictability that comes with the volatility of BTC. They can't give money back in BTC because consumers can game the exchange rate. They can't reliably budget. Businesses are just going to convert the BTC back to useful fiat anyway, which comes with associated fees and counterparty risk.

While I acknowledge /u/gypsytoy 's point that there are other considerations than transactional capacity, I just don't think I'm buying it!

 The whole decentralised trustless thing does nothing for me, I feel more confident with my money in an Australian bank than I do having my life savings in digital funny-money controlled by Chinese mining cartels. I don't want to be my own bank any more than I want to be my own dentist.

Not to say I'm not having fun juicing fiat out of daytrading it... 24/7 easy margin trading with no tax concerns, it is great. But I agree with /u/citral23 -- where are the use cases?

I think people are quick to shit on people who are just here to make a buck, pushing the maximalist agenda as though it will lighten their bag-load.
No what got the project off the ground was its utility in online criminal enterprises and dark markets where trust was impossible. 
> Hey, I just wanted to send a personal appreciation for your comments. Detail. Quality. Reasoning

Right back at ya buddy. I enjoyed in particular your 2014 chart.

> I am certainly guilty of being a dick, or making some low effort comments

As if you need to be a saint to comment here. Your stuff seems to be well thought out. That more than justifies the occasional "yo mama".

> You are doing all of the right things. You're making this a better place. Keep doing it. Comment often

That would have made my day if I weren't going to sleep now haha.

> Send me a BTC  or ETH address, I'd like to buy ya beer.

That's very kind of you and I appreciate the gesture very much. However I am doing very well trading and it would feel wrong accepting anything. Go buy yourself a tuna sub for being a great analyst!


what you're saying is true but only because when you're the 800 lbs gorilla you can bully people into taking your terms unfairly however that doesn't mean they're happy.  

I don't consider the current bitcoin network size relevant when their plan is to centralize to a few lightning nodes and bypass that network.  Bitcoin gold was fine too.. until it wasn't.



who says bitcoin has to be what businesses use as p2p currencies? BCH and LTC have sub penny fees, nano has none and plenty others that are based on DPoS architecture have none as well. and bitcoin having exorbitant fees is pretty much dramatic. fees right now are entirely reasonable, i think its something 10-20 cents to get into the next block. and no its not because commerce on the BTC blockchain has grinded to a halt relative to december, segwit and batching have been getting mass adoption which have cleared up a ton of block space. next time we go back to 20k+ we wont have the fees that we saw back in december. it'll probably still be under 1 dollar. 
Bitcoin fees for any moderately substantial transaction are much less than what Paypal takes. Also, businesses are constantly screwed by chargebacks, I can assure you that they'd rather have the ball in their court instead of being robbed by malicious consumers. 

>they'd be paying fees to miners just to keep bitcoin alive. there are no chargebacks, customer support, etc. They would have to do that all themselves on top of the already exorbitant fees

What exorbitant fees? Why do businesses *like* chargebacks? None of what you're saying makes any sense. Businesses don't want to sign away their control over payments to third parties. That's ridiculous, they want more control, not less.
There are only a handful of maximalists and they're entirely irrational over their value gain.

Only sell when I need money to live on or pay taxes but that's because I use swaps and futures to maintain and grow the fiat valuation of my pile. If those weren't available, I'd have sold out back in December.

And I'm one of the few who *does* wish it would replace fiat. Then again I wish I could fly like superman but know that's not ever going to be realistic. 
im sure theres plenty of small businesses that have to rely on paypal to do banking and transactions. im sure theres other companies that do so as well, obviously i cant give you a list but thats not the point. paypal didnt just get to be as massive at is just because of mom and pop users. 

the thing is that you dont need to even touch BTC to use it as a payment method. theres services out there that automatically transact BTC into fiat through decentralized exchanges with much smaller fees than traditional payment mediums. 

thats fine if you cant see the value proposition of decentralized currency, clearly a TON of people disagree with you but i dont feel like writing up an essay to shitpost on reddit to convince someone its value proposition. you should read up on what happened to cyprus back in 2013 and how banks went insolvent and nobody could withdraw more than ~50 USD a day and how most people lost their savings. 

edit: you should also read about civil forfeiture cases where people lose all of their assets without due diligance but instead could protect their assets by storing it on the blockchain. you should read about cases of refugees and immigrants that cant move their assets past borders and get their money and belongings seized by corrupt government officials, instead they could liquidate their belongings put it on the blockchain and keep all of their wealth in a tiny little device like a trezor or usb. not even that they could just memorize their seed phrase if you dont want to carry something physical on you. what about cases of hyperinflation like in zimbabwe? the whole value proposition of decentralized currency is that you have complete control of your money without going through a 3rd party banking infrastructure. you can move that currency anywhere in the world for essentially nothing and almost instantly. i digress though.
> Which companies do commercial transactions between each other with Paypal?

That was not his point.

>If, as you say, consumers don't care to use BTC because Paypal is safer, faster and cheaper (I agree), 'businesses and companies' have no choice but to use Paypal.

Actually it's often *not* cheaper because merchants pass along processing savings to customers. I just saved 20% the other day by using Bitcoin over Visa or Paypal.

>And IMO, said businesses are more worried about the unpredictability that comes with the volatility of BTC. 

That's a concern that can be mostly mitigated. 

> They can't give money back in BTC because consumers can game the exchange rate. 

Except that they *do*.

>Businesses are just going to convert the BTC back to useful fiat anyway, which comes with associated fees and counterparty risk.

Not all businesses do that but when they do, fees are still lower and counterparty risk is decreased compared with something like Paypal. Everyone has heard the paypal horror stories. 

>While I acknowledge /u/gypsytoy 's point that there are other considerations than transactional capacity, I just don't think I'm buying it!

Not buying *what* exactly? 

>The whole decentralised trustless thing does nothing for me, I feel more confident with my money in an Australian bank than I do having my life savings in digital funny-money controlled by Chinese mining cartels. I don't want to be my own bank any more than I want to be my own dentist.

Because you live in Australia and haven't experienced the direct ramifications of central banking fuckery and failure of fractional reserves. Try arguing this point with someone living in Venezuela.

>Not to say I'm not having fun juicing fiat out of daytrading it... 24/7 easy margin trading with no tax concerns, it is great. But I agree with /u/citral23
 -- where are the use cases?

It's just amazing to me that you guys think digital, decentralized money is not itself a use case. Instant and basically-feeless transactional throughput is being solved for with LN, but the fundamental properties that make Bitcoin valuable are on layer 1. Being able to spend efficiently on low-value TXs is derivative of store of value, you can't separate this aspect, otherwise it's not money, it's just a payment processing system. 

>I think people are quick to shit on people who are just here to make a buck, pushing the maximalist agenda as though it will lighten their bag-load.

That's not what I'm doing. If you're just trading to increase fiat, that's fine. I'm just amazed at how short sighted and uninformed some people are in this sub. There's a giant group of people here (not saying you) that are suffering from immense Dunning Krueger effect and think that they have this whole thing figured out one way or the other. When you press them for details, they either stonewall or provide the most hand wavy answers ever. This is true of a large subset of buttcoiners, alt shills *and* maximalists. So many people are just talking out of their ass and not willing to admit it.
Got the project off the ground? You realize that DNM use case didn't come into the picture until years after the genesis block, right? 

Why do you constantly say the dumbest shit? Yes, a portion of the Bitcoin economy is centered around DNM's but this is proportionally decreasing and being ceded to the likes of Monero. Meanwhile there are much more prevalent value propositions that you can't seem to wrap your head around.

I just don't get why you're always writing in such arrogant terms about how you're sure of *this* and *that*. Most people here seem to think you're a moron who's lying about having a gigantic fortune tied up in successful margin trades. You're a blowhard, dude.
> That's very kind of you and I appreciate the gesture very much. However I am doing very well trading and it would feel wrong accepting anything.

Ya know, in some cultures it is extremely rude to not accept a gift. I don't happen to identify with one of those cultures, but let's pretend like I do for a second. If you're worried about anonymity, make a new metamask address, give me an exchange address, or be really crazy and give me an XMR address. I'd like to buy ya a drink, man. 

Let's pretend I'll be very offended if you don't let me send ya 4 bucks.
> what you're saying is true but only because when you're the 800 lbs gorilla you can bully people into taking your terms unfairly however that doesn't mean they're happy.

That makes no sense. Bitcoin is open source and freely forkable. There's no bullying when it comes to open source protocols. Users, developers and miners are free to move to whichever project they want. Did they move to BCash? No, not at all. BCash block sizes and TX volumes are unbelievably bad.

But go ahead and disregard the facts in favor of your fantasy. 
Cause businesses don't need p2p currencies for each other. They use credit (cards) most of the time due to dynamic cash flow and checks+wires for the rest.

The hardest part in business isn't the mechanics of transferring the funds, it's getting the counterparty to pay at all. The mechanics of transfer are actually a non-issue.

Effectively, crypto works for small scale p2p and international applications, of which, there aren't many outside of business and the wealthy. Well the wealthy may have a lot in assets but very little in cash. 
> There are only a handful of maximalists and they're entirely irrational over their value gain.

Lol, again, you are so incredibly arrogant to think that you know better *just because* and that you have ultimate insight into why someone is a maximalist.

Do you ever question yourself? 

I imagine any reasonable company would use traditional banking methods for their orders, and not get stung with ludicrous 5%? fees. I assumed Paypal was for people sending money to family and for retail users to buy stuff with their credit card online without having to offer the details, and with bonus protection.

To be clear, in theory I see a value proposition for a decentralised currency, and BTC was great for me back in the day when I would spend it on the dark web or dubious Asian pharmacy sites. In hindsight, illegal commerce should not be conducted on a public, immutable ledger. I bought it and instantly spent it so a change in exchange rate didn't screw me--it never occurred to me to hoard it and GET RICH QUICK. And yes if I had hoarded it, it turns out it would have been profitable, but that isn't the point, and trying to make that the point shows that people here are more interested in making money than they are in the currency of the future^TM

I see BTC as overvalued (although the price will go up before it goes to shit). I don't see value in 'digital gold', or deflationary currency, or PoW mining polluting the environment so lazy libertarians can get rich without adding anything of value to society. Well I guess I'm complicit in the latter.

>clearly a TON of people disagree with you

I disagree with the mass delusion shared by greedy gamblers, only time will tell. Exceptional cases of banking failure must be contrasted with the hilariously fraught history of BTC institutions. I don't see how BTC dominance will be any less plutocratic and corrupt than the current system--quite the opposite in fact.
Venezuelas problems are due to socialism not central banking. 
> Let's pretend I'll be very offended if you don't let me send ya 4 bucks.

We wouldn't want that now would we? Alright then Mr.Ozone check your PMs :).
bcore-legacy will become obsolete as they sell out to blockstream and other centralized solutions.  

Bitcoin Cash uses the model that worked for 9 years and made bcore-legacy the success it used to be.  

Bitcoin Cash is up 50% since the NYA consensus was violated, while bcore-legacy has declined in value.  They also have a lot of angry miners waiting for the chance to strike for a coordinated attack.






You have no clue what you're talking about, as usual. Socialism is a political ideology, not a policy. The petro itself is a form of central banking and you'd have to be completely devoid of intelligence to not see the issues with petro or other monetary policies of the Venezuelan government... then again, we're talking about *you* here. The same person who thinks lost coins damages liquidity. 

(You're a moron, dude. A living, breathing poster child for Dunning Krueger effect.)
>bcore-legacy will become obsolete as they sell out to blockstream and other centralized solutions.

How is Blockstream a "centralized solution"? That really makes absolutely no sense. Bitcoin is open source and consensus-based, Blockstream doesn't control Bitcoin, the miners and users do.

>Bitcoin Cash uses the model that worked for 9 years and made bcore-legacy the success it used to be.

BCash is not closer to "satoshi's vision" than Bitcoin is. It's just an arbitrary standard that Roger wants to impose on the term "Bitcoin". In a lot of ways Bitcoin is closer to the original Bitcoin then BCash. Not that it should matter. Both are substantially different then the original protocol and that's not a problem. Worshiping Satoshi is just about one of the dumbest things to do and doesn't advance the debate at all. It just makes you look like a cult worshiper.

>Bitcoin Cash is up 50% since the NYA consensus was violated, while bcore-legacy has declined in value. They also have a lot of angry miners waiting for the chance to strike for a coordinated attack.

Again, this is such a dumb thing to say. BCash is worth about 10% of Bitcoin, if it were the successful fork that you're making it out to be it would be worth *more*, not less, than Bitcoin but it isn't. The NYA was bullshit strong-armed manipulation and didn't have the support necessary to carry the network. End of story. BCash doesn't either but it was propped up by Jihan and crew and now people trade it as a pump and dump. Big whoop! 

You're out of your mind if you think BCash is somehow better then Bitcoin. It's just another shitty alt with almost 0 use. 

Believe whatever helps you sleep at night though.
I'd rather be dumb and winning than smart and losing. 
Why do you keep talking about "bcash"? That is the node.js implementation of BitcoinCASH developed by purse.io. 

This seems to be a conversation about BitcoinCash or BCH, the p2p cash version of Bitcoin. 

Vitalkik: "Finally, you’re using the term “BCash” wrong; it’s an implementation, not a blockchain/cryptocurrency.

So please learn about the tech before you criticize next time."
OoOooOoo, a false dichotomy! 

Nice, keep digging the intellectual disability hole deep. 
> Why do you keep talking about "bcash"? That is the node.js implementation of BitcoinCASH developed by purse.io.

Bcash is what it's most widely known as. It's also short for Bitcoin Cash. I'll continue to call it this because this is the most common name *and* it avoids confusion relating to Bitcoin. Not sure what the issue is with this name.

>This seems to be a conversation about BitcoinCash or BCH, the p2p cash version of Bitcoin.

Uh, no it's not. It's a contentious Bitcoin *hard fork chain split*, meaning that it's an alt, not 'some other version of Bitcoin'. That makes absolutely no sense. 


>Vitalkik: "Finally, you’re using the term “BCash” wrong; it’s an implementation, not a blockchain/cryptocurrency. So please learn about the tech before you criticize next time."

Firstly, I don't care what Vitalik has to say. Secondly, it's both, it's the name of the chain as well as the name of a client. The vast majority of the crypto community knows it as BCash. It's a better name anyway.


Haha you are still roaming about on here making an absolute fool of yourself. Take a break and get a life champ.
(Spoiler: no matter how much you try and say you are smart you clearly come across as a lunatic)
Oh, well, if you want to have an honest conversation you should at least call the version of Bitcoin, BCH, by its name. 

Being a contentious hard fork detracts from nothing. It is still a version of Bitcoin that goes back to the genesis block and has more attributes of Bitcoin than the segwit, ico-for-LN version, BTC, that cannot scale to be useful as money without relying on 2nd layers and other centralized solutions.

What the majority think it not a useful metric for proving anything other than what the majority think. Bitcoin is defined by adhering to objective criteria. Bitcoin is p2p electronic cash, uses PoW, SHA256 etc. It doesn't matter what this or that person think. Definitions are not subjective. 

The name of the Bitcoin Cash chain is "Bitcoin Cash". Anyone calling it "bcash" is both disingenuous and un-objective since "bcash" refers to something real and something separate from the cryptocurrency BCH, namely a javascript implementation of BitcoinCash. 
How exactly am I making a fool of myself here? I never said I was smart, I'm simply pointing out the appeal of Bitcoin to victims of governments with manipulative monetary policy. There's nothing "smart" about that. It's just well known. Look back to what happened with Cyprus.

Get a clue, dude.
> Oh, well, if you want to have an honest conversation you should at least call the version of Bitcoin, BCH, by its name.

It's not a version of Bitcoin and it's most commonly referred to as BCash. What about this do you not understand?

>Being a contentious hard fork detracts from nothing. It is still a version of Bitcoin that goes back to the genesis block and has more attributes of Bitcoin than the segwit, ico-for-LN version, BTC, that cannot scale to be useful as money without relying on 2nd layers and other centralized solutions.

Lol, you can spread this lie all you want but Bitcoin is Bitcoin and BCash is an alt. Bitcoin refers to the *chain and the network* not the protocol. Hell, you mind as well call Litecoin and Dogecoin Bitcoin Lite and Bitcoin Doge by your logic. This of course is silly because people aren't referring to the protocol, they're referring to a specific chain.

>What the majority think it not a useful metric for proving anything other than what the majority think. Bitcoin is defined by adhering to objective criteria. Bitcoin is p2p electronic cash, uses PoW, SHA256 etc. It doesn't matter what this or that person think. Definitions are not subjective.

Firstly, BTC uses PoW, SHA256, etc. The limit was never in the whitepaper and yet Satoshi imposed it.... and both chains still have it... So I guess *neither* are Bitcoin? Your argument here is just so silly. BCashers always want to claim the name and say that BCash is somehow Bitcoin but literally nobody other than BCash shills actually buy into this logic. That doesn't stop you guys from rambling off this absurdity every day. As if it even matters, improve the tech if you want the project to survive and stop worrying what people call it.

>The name of the Bitcoin Cash chain is "Bitcoin Cash". Anyone calling it "bcash" is both disingenuous and un-objective since "bcash" refers to something real and something separate from the cryptocurrency BCH, namely a javascript implementation of BitcoinCash.

How many times do I have to explain the same thing. BCash is what most people call BCH. There's no disingenuity about it. That's just its colloquial name. I don't understand why you think you have the authority to tell people to stop calling it that. If tomorrow spin up an implementation of BCash called "BitcoinCash" does that mean that people have to stop calling the chain *BitcoinCash*? By your logic, yes.

This parade nonsense arguments is so counterproductive to your cause but you don't even seem to realize it. You should be focused on improving the tech an onboarding holders instead of freaking out about the name BCash. BCash is processing barely the same number of transactions as Bitcoin was in 2012. That's pathetic and should be extremely worrying for anyone holding BCash. It's not a coin that's viable long term. Most aren't, but certainly not BCash, which is inferior in every way to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. There's not a single category BCash is a leader in. Everything from fees to speed to security is handled far better by another project. BCash is just a joke that was essentially air dropped to Bitcoin holders and propped up by Jihan. People only trade it because it was free. Eventually it'll peter out and be worth next to nothing. Like I said, from the perspective of everyone who isn't shilling BCash, it's a complete joke and scam.

Believe whatever you want though. I don't really care what types of bags you want to hold. Just don't expect anyone to listen to your ridiculous arguments and take them seriously. 
Appeals to authority and the crowd are not arguments. Most people in r/bitcoin as well as tokenbois that are new to the scene call it "bcash" because it is part of an attempt to other Bitcoin Cash as an "alt" which you seem to have bought. 

I really don't mind the term, BCASH, and I don't want to tell anyone what to say or not say. Just as long as you understand the name was coined as part of a PR campaign and is not organic. The term is actually very useful in determining who is objective and who is an ideologue. 

Also you are clearly non-objective as you use the common Blockstream talking point that "bcash is a scam". When there is no evidence of an "scam". Far from it. The evidence is that a large portion of Bitcoin early adopters, myself included, left the Core chain and continued supporting Bitcoin as p2p electronic cash with a roadmap to scale on-chain. Please outline the "scam" charge you bleat like a common Blockstream sheep. 

BCH remains the version of Bitcoin useful as money. BTC remains an ICO for LN (that will require a HF to increase blocksize to scale) that has lost 70% of marketshare by abandoning it's original mission and which relies on technocracy and authoritarian governance.  I am sorry this triggers you so. 

P.S. Hard-forks are how blockchains upgrade, see latest BCH upgrade. Curious what you think about coercive soft-forks like Segwit since you seem to be so against forking. 
> Appeals to authority and the crowd are not arguments. 

You're the one appealing to authority by saying that a minority choice term is the correct term and BCash, the much more common term, is wrong. *That's* appeal from authority, bro. This is open source software not your pet project. 

>I really don't mind the term, BCASH, and I don't want to tell anyone what to say or not say. Just as long as you understand the name was coined as part of a PR campaign and is not organic.

Disagree.

>The term is actually very useful in determining who is objective and who is an ideologue.

Lol, the person pushing a false narrative is the ideologue here and that person is *you*. You don't even understand the nomenclature and think that it's acceptable to confuse people that BCash is a 'version' of Bitcoin. It's not. It's an alt. 

>Also you are clearly non-objective as you use the common Blockstream talking point that "bcash is a scam". When there is no evidence of an "scam". Far from it.

Please outline the "scam" charge you bleat like a common Blockstream sheep.

I'm not saying that the coin itself is a scam. I'm saying that marketing it as Bitcoin or a "version" of Bitcoin is fraud. You (Roger, rather) are misrepresenting what BCH is. Plain and simple. You're confusing (or attempting to confuse) investors that are new to the space. It's wrong and borderline illegal.  


>BCH remains the version of Bitcoin useful as money.

Just stop. No matter how many times you say it it's not a "version" of Bitcoin. This idea is entirely absurd and you're embarrassing yourself.


>BTC remains an ICO for LN that has lost 70% of marketshare by abandoning it's original mission and which relies on technocracy and authoritarian governance. I am sorry this triggers you so.

Lol, none of this triggers me, it's just fascinating how self-deluded BCash shills are. BCash has lost almost 100% of it's market share but I don't see you making the same argument.

By the way, let's take a brief tour of you're history to see if you're a hypocrite. Ok?

Countless examples of you calling Bitcoin, Bitcoin Core or BCore. So you're just a hypocrite anyhow. Good luck shilling!
/u/tippr gild
Bcore
It's amazing that you'd gild this, given how [I provided examples below](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8m7np4/daily_discussion_saturday_may_26_2018/dznf4uu/) of  /u/roguesarecool referring to Bitcoin as Bitcoin Core. Notice that he hasn't answered to the hypocrisy? This guy is making a scene about people calling BCash, BCash, which he claims is just a client, even though the vast majority of people know it refers tot he chain as well. But then he turns around and does the same exact thing. 

This moron obviously lacks integrity but what does it say about yours that you would give this guy gold for shilling the BCash narrative? He can't even be bothered to respond to the contradictory examples and you're awarding him? You people are just too much at times :p Practice what you preach FFS. 
Bcore
but you said x is just what people call it? BTC is called bitcoin core because there is only one implementation, core, and one dev team, core. 
> but you said x is just what people call it? 

The vast majority of the community refers to BTC as Bitcoin and has for almost ten years.

>BTC is called bitcoin core because there is only one implementation, core, and one dev team, core.

You should educate yourself because you are 100% incorrect. 

Don't try to excuse your shilly behavior. A cursory glance through your history reveals nothing but shilling, trolling and the occasional temper tantrum. 

Hypocrite.
Oh? Sorry. Only 94% of BTC blocks are mined with Core. 
https://coin.dance/nodes

Also, who are the other notable BTC dev teams apart from Core?
Huh, you apparently don't understand the difference between nodes and hashing power. Interesting.

I don't need to list other implementations as the information is easily available to you. 

You should also know that Core is comprised of more devs and has way more pull requests than Unlimited and ABC combined.

Tell me, what are the other notable BCash implementations? Oh right, there aren't any. ABC and Unlimited comprise 98% of the network. 

Also, please tell me why these BCash implementations are using so much Core and Blockstream code? Maybe they should be called Unlimited Core and ABC Core, since they've hijacked so much code from Core devs.

So, just to be clear... There are 10+ active Bitcoin implementations and only 2 or 3 active BCash implementations. And your argument is *what* exactly?
I understand the difference. Vast majority of hash power used to mine blocks runs Bitcoin Core. And mining nodes are all that matters (something core supporters fail to grasp, still). 

Also, thank you for confirming that Bitcoin Core is the only dev team for BTC. 

And again, there is only one "Bcash" implementation, its called Bcash. 

Core and Blockstream code is used in Bitcoin Cash implementations because BTC and BCH are almost identical in the codebase. BCH removed replace-by-fee (cancer) and has a larger maximum blocksize, notably. This make BCH the version of Bitcoin useable as money since no RBF means 0-conf or instant-clearing is possible and big blocks mean capacity is always greater than network demand, so txs with fees of 1 sat/byte will always make it into next block. 


> Also, thank you for confirming that Bitcoin Core is the only dev team for BTC.

It's not, that makes absolutely no sense given your 94% figure. Do you not understand how percentages work? 

Also, the 94% figure you cited is for **nodes**, not hashing power, you ditz. Before you start lecturing people about BCash, how about learning the basics?
Yes, the nodes are vast majority bitcoin core. And mining nodes are also vast majority bitcoin core, can you show me otherwise?

I am not lecturing anyone on bcash, the purse.io implementation of bitcoin cash,. I don't even think it's out yet. 
You are right. I cited 94% of nodes. I actually think the mining nodes running bcore is even higher. Looking for those stats now. Standby. 
> Yes, the nodes are vast majority bitcoin core. And mining nodes are also vast majority bitcoin core, can you show me otherwise?

What? You're the one that made the claim. *You show me*, duh! Or are you just pulling shit out of your ass and calling it "facts"? Also, to think node # = hashing power is completely retarded. So you've got even more learning to do! How exciting!

>I am not lecturing anyone on bcash, the purse.io implementation of bitcoin cash,. I don't even think it's out yet.

I think you're confused. BCash refers to the BCH chain. The implementation you're referring to was named *after* the chain was. BCash is the alt blockchain that you're attempting to shill.
Standing by (as if this figure matters at all because **it's still an implementation, you dope**. By **your logic** that means that it's the incorrect name for the chain. The chain is called Bitcoin and yet you're using a name of a client to refer to it. That **goes against *your* rules, buddy**! Regardless of what percentage of nodes or mining pools are running Core)

Also, don't forget that ABC and Unlimited run **vast amounts of Core code**. Therefore they should be called ABC Core and Unlimited Core. Don't forget this.
I am not shilling anything. 

I do not think node = hashpower. I am looking for the stats that will show you that almost all BTC blocks are minded using bcore. coin.dance used to have it. 

"bcash" is what some beta followers of blockstream/samson mow call Bitcoin Cash, yes. That is not it's name, however. It's name is Bitcoin Cash as you can see on every wallet and exchange (to use your "it's whatever the majority call it" argument). 
I don’t see any shilling. I see people responding to your crazy-ass, psychotic ranting about how much you hate Bitcoin Cash. 
> I am not shilling anything.

Yeah you are. Look at your post history. It's nothing but trolling, shilling and arguing with crypto folks across various subs about how BCash is not supposed to be called BCash and how it's actually the real Bitcoin because "Satoshi's Vision". How is *that* not shilling? You're not fooling anyone.

>I do not think node = hashpower. I am looking for the stats that will show you that almost all BTC blocks are minded using bcore. coin.dance used to have it.

You said 94% of blocks are mined with Core. You cited node count. That's retarded and you should just admit as much but I don't suspect you're that humble.

>"bcash" is what some beta followers of blockstream/samson mow call Bitcoin Cash, yes. 

**This is what the vast majority of the crypto community calls it and has called it since Aug 1st.** Don't pretend that this is Samson's fault. This is what **the entire community calls it*, except for a handful of shills such as yourself. 

>It's name is Bitcoin Cash as you can see on every wallet and exchange (to use your "it's whatever the majority call it" argument).

Lol, Bitfinex originally had it listed as BCash but shills threw a fit. They only changed it because of the outrage (and probably bribe from Roger). Don't fool yourself, **virtually everyone calls it BCash and that's what it's name is**. If you don't like it, then maybe you shouldn't call Bitcoin by other names. Two can play that game.
You and roguesarecool are shills. Both of your post histories reveal this. All you do is visit various crypto subs and try to convince people of the narrative that BCash is actually way better and its real name is Bitcoin. Nobody takes you seriously and I have a hunch that bans are inbound for the both of you. You're both clearly repeatedly violating rule #5.


I don't think I have talked much about "Satoshi's vision". 

Can you demonstrate what "the vast majority call it"? 
Because we can demonstrate that all wallets, exchanges, newscasters, and media calls it Bitcoin Cash or BCH. 

 I talk about Bitcoin and the white paper, yes. I am a bitcoin maximalist, have been since 2013, This and other subs i frequent are bitcoin-related. Astute observation. I avoid saying "real bitcoin" because they are all real. So you haven't read anything I wrote. BCH is a version of Bitcoin but like BTC and BTG and many other versions. BCH has meets more objective criteria (as defined by whitepaper, satoshi's writings, early bitcointalk posts, early r/bitcoin threads, bitcoin.org, bitcoin.it wiki before it was white-washed by theymos) for "what is bitcoin" than any other version. 
> I don't think I have talked much about "Satoshi's vision".

You talk about the white paper and how BCH is closest to the white paper or some other such nonsense. 

>Can you demonstrate what "the vast majority call it"? Because we can demonstrate that all wallets, exchanges, newscasters, and media calls it Bitcoin Cash or BCH.

Compare "BCash" with "Bitcoin Cash" on Twitter. The vast majority of the crypto space seems to refer to it as BCash, which is obviously just short for the other name anyway, so I don't get why you're harping on this point incessantly.

>https://coin.dance/blocks/historical here we can see that virtually all BTC mining nodes are running Bitcoin Core.

Lol, are you a moron? Do you not see how the chart says Bitcoin Core / **Emergent Consensus**? This means that the blocks represented by the yellow line are signaling a block limit increase anymore, obviously (because 2X failed). That doesn't mean that those blocks are all mined by Core, it means that it's either Core or another non-signaling implementation. Jesus Christ, dude. You're really outdoing yourself in each of these comments. Do you really not know how to read a simple chart like that? Show me a real source that charts Bitcoin Core blocks exclusively.
> I am a bitcoin maximalist, have been since 2013,

Same.

>This and other subs i frequent are bitcoin-related. 

Well this sub is *Bitcoin* related, but not BCash related. This has been discussed and litigated many times. The mods created the daily Alt Discussion thread for BCash and other alt discussion.

>I also never say "real bitcoin". So you haven't read anything I wrote. 

Sorry, you say it's a "version" of Bitcoin. It's not though. Bitcoin is a singular, unified, consensus network and its associated blockchain. There are not two or more Bitcoin. There are contentious *forks*, but those are alts that share a partial history with Bitcoin, nothing more. They are not *also* Bitcoin. That argument makes absolutely no sense. *If* the network and userbase had followed BCH, then *it* would be Bitcoin but it didn't so it's not.

>BCH is a version of Bitcoin but like BTC and BTG and many other versions.

Completely incorrect, as explained above. One consensus network, not multiple. What you're describing is the opposite of consensus.

>BCH has meets more objective criteria (as defined by whitepaper, satoshi's writings, early bitcointalk posts, early r/bitcoin threads, bitcoin.org, bitcoin.it wiki before it was white-washed by theymos) for "what is bitcoin" than any other version.

No, it really doesn't. That's arbitrary at best and completely impossible to quantify at worst. I'm not even going to get into this debate. I already have hundreds of times and it never goes anywhere. Believe what you want but don't expect people to come around to the stupid argument. It makes no sense because it mistakenly refers to the protocol instead of the network. Bitcoin is both the protocol (the consensus rules) as well as the network (the blockchain and nodes). Only noobs and shills don't understand this basic **fact**. You even said it yourself, above, that the names refer to the chains so I don't understand why you're changing your mind now on the nomenclature. Again, only noobs think in these terms. I'm surprised you've been around for 5 years and still bought into such an absurd narrative.

Here we can see that 99% of BTC blocks are mined using Bitcoin Core implementation. Any comments?
sorry, i pasted the wrong link in my haste to show that its actually 99% bcore that mines BTC blocks. 
So now, we look to twitter to name things? Twitter accounts are bought and paid for. It's not a place for objective infomation about the name of things. I prefer exchanges, wallets, websites, media sites, news media etc. They all refer to Bitcoin Cash as "Bitcoin Cash" because that it what it is called by objective people who are free from agenda and brainwashing.

We can see here that actually, according to Google, "bcash" ranks lower than "Bitcoin Cash" and "BCH".

Go to bed gypsy. 
Do you honestly not see the "/ Non-EC" next to Core? That means that 99% of blocks are not signaling a block limit increase, Core or otherwise. I don't understand why you keep posting the same stat when it doesn't even say what you're proclaiming it says. 

**AND**, the bottom line is you said don't call BCash "BCash" because that's the name of a software implementation (it's not, but okay). By that logic, you wouldn't call Bitcoin "Bitcoin Core" because *that's* the name of an implementation, not the chain itself. The only reason you're playing these games is because you're a shill, it's plainly obvious. I don't know who you think you're fooling but it's not me. Again, a *quick* glance at your post history reveals you having the same argument over and over, trying to push your BCash agenda on other crypto folks. Doesn't seem to be working, but carry on. You should know that it's against the rules here though and I'm going to report all these comments shortly.
Well I don't think I need to explain why search data doesn't necessarily correlate with term usage in the population. Anyway, you already said you don't care if people call it BCash, so I don't even know why you're still trying to litigate this. It's short for the name you call it anyway. It sounds better and it's catchier, so what are you complaining about? It's not like Basketball fans throw a fit when someone calls it "BBall", it's just a fucking shorthand nickname. Who cares?

Furthermore, I notice you're stonewalling me on the other comments, about LN and the names of the *chains*. Are you just going to ignore the need to defend your ridiculous claims or are you going to respond? 
Which "agenda" is that? p2p electronic cash for the entire world? guilty as charged. Same message Bitcoiners have been spreading since 2009. 

Call it whatever you want. The point was that your claim that "everyone calls it bcash" is false...unless you can demonstrate otherwise. All the data seems to suggest that Bitcoin Cash or BCH is what people on google, exchanges, wallets, website, media personality, journalists, call it.  Using the term 'Bcash' identifies you as hostile to BCH. In this way, it is a great term and I hope you and others continue to use it to make it easier to detect who is serious and who is an ideologue. 
Bitcoin *isn't* p2p electronic cash? Seems like it is to me. I just paid for lunch *today* with Bitcoin and it seemed to function just like cash. Meanwhile it's doing 20x the transaction throughput that BCash is. BCash blocks are currently about 50 kb on average. 
> The point was that your claim that "everyone calls it bcash" is false...unless you can demonstrate otherwise.

How come you wrote this same comment from your alt, /u/---Mike---- , and then deleted it immediately? Is it because you forgot to log out and back into *this* account?

I don't have the hard data and either do you. I traded my BCash away on Bitfinex and that's what they called it. I think it's catchy and everyone knows what it means, so that's what I call it.

> Using the term 'Bcash' identifies you as hostile to BCH. 

Uh, no it doesn't actually. I hold BCH, so how can I be hostile towards it? The only thing I'm critical of is the way Roger so many others promote it as if it's somehow related to Bitcoin, beyond sharing a partial history. It's fraud, plain and simple.

> In this way, it is a great term and I hope you and others continue to use it to make it easier to detect who is serious and who is an ideologue.

How does that make me or anyone an *ideologue*? I'm simply explaining to you why BCash is not Bitcoin and why this name is catchier and avoids confusion when distinguishing between the two coins.

Stop being clueless. You said LN was centralized and trust base, which is factually wrong on both accounts. You have absolutely no idea what you're talking about but you're shilling your nonsense nonetheless. It's pretty stale at this point and nobody cares. I only engage because it's interesting. You can't even argue without contradicting yourself, which is pretty hilarious. Then you log into an alt and comment by mistake. This is certainly a hilarious exchange and one I won't forget! :)

I think BTC fees are lower now that usage is down to 2016 levels. Blocks/mempool aren't full, fees are lower (much to GMAX's chagrin) but not 1 sat/byte like BCH. If blocks ever get full again on BTC, that is usage increases, the fees will skyrocket again because no solution was created on the BTC chain to handle high tx volumes. Instead BTC lost 70% of marketshare as people fled to tokens and the scalable version of Bitcoin, BCH. 

BTC roadmap involves 2nd layers and side-chains and all sorts of other Rube Goldberg contraptions. Feel free to use that chain if you want, I prefer to use BCH because fees are lower and clearance is instant. Also, BCH community is uncensored and free from the tyranny of Bitcoin Core/Blockstream and their centralized, trust-based bank settlement layer plan that is LN. 
Lol, how is LN centralized and/or trust based?
Go night night gypsy Bitcoin Core shill. 
Uh, didn't you say this already a few hours ago? 

How about you stop stalking me? You realize several people are already banned for doing the same? I'm not a shill, bro. You're on the wrong sub. Take this circlejerk back to /r/btc.
