[Daily Discussion] Friday, April 06, 2018 -- TITLE
#New post: [\[Daily Discussion\] Saturday, April 07, 2018 →](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8afnvv/daily_discussion_saturday_april_07_2018/)
Current price action feels kind of weird, clearly market is undecided about what needs to happen next.

**Reasons to stay bearish:**

* Death cross.
* Price is still ~6x higher than it was just a year ago. 
* General public interest is at the same level when BTC price was in 4-5k range (Google Trends).
* Merchant adoption is decreasing (maybe even negative).
* With lower price miner profit is reduced and they're forced to sell more BTC to cover their expenses.
* Altcoin miners are taking losses and selling their GPU's which can negatively affect the interest and purchasing power for bitcoin.
* ICO's are getting stifled by regulations, which can indirectly affect Bitcoin.

**Reasons for a short-medium term bull run:** 

* Bitfinex shorts are at an ATH, with most (2/3) of them opened under 10k and people continue to open them, thus bears are prone for a cascading margin liquidation more than ever.
* We're consolidating near 6k support which previously resulted in a massive bounce and another major support around 5k. 
* LocalBitcoins volume is picking up once again.
* Friends of mine that missed the boat last year are DCA'ing and thinking that price is 'cheap'.
* LN is up and running on mainnet, which proves that it works at a small scale.
* (Far-fetched reasons) Schnorr, MAST, halving 2 years away.

Personally I think it's foolish to open medium-term short here as the risk/reward ratio just isn't there unless there's something major that I'm missing. Sure Bitcoin could continue bleeding indefinitely, but those shorts will have to close at some point. My gut says that there's a lot more upside potential here, so I'm gambling here with a medium sized long position and plenty of cash to add a lot more if it dips lower (though obviously I have my limits and will not baghold if things turn ugly).


Only the very worst market crashes will crash by 80%. Assuming the *realistic worst case* scenario for BTC, it could fall a bit further, down to $4k. 

An important fact to consider though, is that the NASDAQ took almost *three entire years to bottom out* (80% drop) in the 2001 market crash. By comparison, just three months into BTC's crash and we've already fallen by 68%.

The NASDAQ had only dropped by 25% after the first three months. 

We literally appear to be replicating a bubble cycle in months as opposed to years. Much faster moving. With this in mind, we are very likely to recover much faster too.

So, realistic worst case: If we go further down and have a full 80% crash, then the timeframe things have unfolded thus far strongly indicate that the bottom will be in at around $4000 in approx one month's time. At this point there will be a gigantic bounce, some levelling off, and a solid foundation from which to start the next bull run later in the year.
It's over, guys, our job is finally done!

All of us traders combined on all markets have spilled blood, sweat and tears to finally come up with the REAL value of Bitcoin!

And that is $6600.

We can all go to sleep now, I fell proud for us all, it's official, people!
Sun is shining, heading for a 2 day party. Glad to leave this market behind for some time and just have fun. Happy weekend guys, cheers!
After reducing my short position (CA @ 6760) yesterday at 6740 ahead of the (laughable) Coinbase news, I added it all back at 6725 (CA 6750) just after it turned out to be a steamy pile of nothing.

Overnight, I set profit-taking stops at 6460, which I missed on this morning's wick by $20. I did have the clarity to add to my short on that ridiculous profit-taking/knife catching bounce, and was able to add at 6645. CA now at 6720.

This does feel like the inevitable slog downwards is continuing. 6400-6800 is playing out very similarly to 7400-7800 two weeks ago. For bears with short entries above 6700, patience is probably your best option. For those looking to short, odds are you'll get a better entry than 66xx in the coming hours. Because....

Of particular concern to me is what may be a falling wedge forming: https://www.tradingview.com/x/ifuFxAq2/  

As such, I have a target to close 80% of my short just over 6500. I'll re-add if the wedge breaks up, or on a bounce if 6500 falls. 

edit: reduced 33% at 6575. Layered 33% at 6555 and 33% 6525. Final sell actually flips position to 33% long with a stop at 6460. We'll see if I catch the knife or this breaks hard one way or the other. 

Good luck all. 
This thread makes me chuckle sometimes. Some people seem to think there is a covert war going on between a big team of permabears and a big team of permabulls, fighting each other to move the price up/down.

This was like the  fun sex you waited for a long date night then it was over in 3 min and you fall asleep because you are drunk
I've seen a lot of posts recently from people complaining about trolls, low effort/meme posters, etc. Guys, just hit that handy dandy report button, choose block user, and you'll never see those people again. You might miss out on some sick burns, but that's probably not what you're here for. Control what you can control, easy peasy.
Shorts are still piling in on top of one another. We are at 34k shorts now. There are more shorts now than longs (34k to 33.7k) and funding for shorts is higher at .015%. That recent dip was bought up because they know where this is going to go if enough time passes. Bears need to push it down soon otherwise those shorts are just not going to be profitable. 
When's the last time BTC was this tight on it's movements? Must have been 6+ months ago? We are going between like 6590 and 6620 for hours 
Amazingly enough, [not only are the ema9/sma20 overlapping, but there is a TRIPLE NECK on Bollinger bands on the 30m TF.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZqbkQIOF) Still short from 6610, but SL tighter than ever since when it moves, it will move FAST I believe.

Anyone else thinks that this lack of commitment to sell could mark the beginning of a reversal on this bear trend? clearly, noone wants to buy but also noone is willing to sell anything, and that's news. Sellers wxhausted might be what the market needs to start buying in for a long term long or even a hold.
Is this the power of George Soros? lol
It sounds like the majority of people here who think the price will continue to drop fully intend to buy BTC *at some point.* 

sounds like a pretty bullish long term indicator to me... thoughts?
longing here since around 6450$ 2kBTC wall is still on kraken EURBTC and since the sell pressure is kinda low (ATH shorts etc) I doubt that we will even test it.
George Soros: Whale Hunter.
I exited the remainder of my short from 6750 at 6585. Average exit was 6560. I still have my small Sept futs long (CA 6410) with layered adds down to 6040. Without holding a short position, this concerned me a little bit, but I would be very surprised if all those executed between now and tomorrow morning. We've got a bear pennant inside a falling wedge, which is weird: https://www.tradingview.com/x/lfYMavol/  

We somehow can't break 6500, yet we also can't really break over 6650 either. I haven't checked the bbands, but they have to be tightening like crazy on shorter time frames. I probably would have left my short position open, but I'm getting ready to travel for a bit here and won't be looking the charts for the next 24 hours or so.

I'm leaning towards putting in a few laddered limit sells from 6800-7400, although I somewhat expect it to move the other direction if it breaks hard. The falling wedge is throwing me for a bit of a loop, though.

Good luck all. 
Closed my short now too. WTF mate?
For those that might have missed it (he posted them late), /u/ozone63 had some great charts in yesterday's Daily ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/89wnoa/daily_discussion_thursday_april_05_2018/dww6j9x/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/89wnoa/daily_discussion_thursday_april_05_2018/dww8wcm/)).

Dear Diary,

I checked the charts, and still did not buy 

Anyone having a guess at how long the downtrend/leveling will go? I’m daft throwing 3-9 months
Surprised at the sudden energy of that bounce.  Even more surprised at the rejection of that bounce.
I just noticed this is the 2nd weekly candle that has (so far) found support exactly at the 52-week SMA (unless my app distorts the chart -> correct me)

I think this is an important level to look for - on one hand, I'd expect most bullwhales and big fishes alike to find the 1-year average a good buying price

On the other hand, this seems like a great opportunity for the bears to wreck most of the remaining confidence which is putting even more pressure on the bulls 

Personally, I doubt it will hold: every move up keeps getting rejected and the big-ass bear flag from 9k (12h chart) started breaking downwards, but all guessing aside - this should be a bloody battle
The mega descending triangle of doom has me rustling in my jimmies...
This kind of action is prime territory for whales to throw out some tests to see how the market responds. That's what this looks like to me now.
Recently people are fearful to long and trigger happy to short. That may mean the downward pressure is mostly due to margin short rather than organic sell. If despite the excessive margin short the price still doesn't go down, there could a reversal once the short euphoria is exhausted.
SEC Quietly Puts Bitcoin ETF Proposals Back on the Table .

I rember, a year ago ppl where predicting the price would go up to 3500$ if the bitcoin ETF would be accepted...
Not sure how to interpret it either way but this is easily the most time we've spent hanging out in the 6500 range. Our previous trips were short lived, for an hourish. So while sellers may "seem tired", so are buyers

https://www.tradingview.com/x/QkaUSak7/

So we've got this small falling wedge we could be in (dotted purple), or a larger version of it (solid blue) that could have a ways to go before we find support...right at...6k.
[removed]
Just bought a little. Now have 25% of what i want to hold long term.
BTC now has the price action of a low volume altcoin.  Except it doesn't know who to follow.
The daily is showing divergence [again](https://snag.gy/UFVf6e.jpg), last time we had a jump from 7.6 to 9.1 but to be fair divergence can go on for a good amount of time and it's only 1 indicator.    I haven't seen the [stoch on the 4hr](https://snag.gy/Ywz3bn.jpg) this flat and the MACD lead is flattening with BBands tightening.  Like I was saying before shorts at an ATH is a recipe for a target.   I feel the overall market sentiment leaning more and more to this being accumulation even with consistent bears, but until we move up it's not confirmed and it would make sense to ride the bear trend. 
why do we need stable coins again?
It's going to be really disappointing to everyone when we move, but stop right at 6550 or 6650 and flatline again at that level for days.
Going to sleep with 50$ separating my high and low alarms. Odds are they won't trigger... Have fun guys 
Looking at the graph of shorts, there must be literally thousands of shorts underwater even just at this price, if this goes above $7k this wont be pretty for bears.
This pump mirrors almost exactly the dump from 6850 2 days ago.

Not only this puts us in an inverted bart which is just some tumblr shit, but also makes me confident in that what awaits us is sideways with bulltraps. 
Market stays flat with little to no volume until a whale comes along and pushes it $200 in either direction.  Then it sits flat for another while, until a whale comes along...

All this makes TA's value in this market highly questionable.  TA is meant to predict the psychology of a large aggregate group of investors.  But when you reach a state where the only thing really moving the market is a handful of individuals...

Edit: posted this before I saw this comment from /u/DaFlyingGriffin saying basically the same thing:

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8a6k3w/daily_discussion_friday_april_06_2018/dwws8v6/
Due to the ridiculously tight 15m BBands and the fact that I have absolutely no notion under god which way this is going to break, I just did something a bit out of character.

I took a 50% long position and a 50% short position (1 on the June futures and 1 on the September futures).

Will close the short above $6,800 and the long below $6,400.
Cascade of breakouts from falling wedges - over 7k, then over 9k, then over _[insert your favorite moon number]_ - a potential (albeit wishful-thinking) scenario:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/BNBQQh98/

- a breakout from the current falling wedge could trigger:
- a breakout from the falling channel since 11.7k, which could trigger:
- a breakout from the falling channel since 20k, which could trigger:
- ...

Hey, after so much stagnation today, might as well indulge in some daydreaming!
Can't help but feel this is the prelude to the weekend dip. A test of 6400/6500 sure. But the carnage could happen tomorrow / Sunday.
held short throught 6500 and 6400, didnt close, didnt take profits, thinking "lets not be too hasty". price does not go down any more, instead starts slowly recoverying.

close some of the same short (originally from 7500) @7300 "it could go up more, need more bullets". price indeed goes to 7500, but then falls sharply to 6600, im left emptyhanded (my add was @7800, which we never made).

ok, oversold now, goes to 6800-6900, Coinbase news coming. must be a good time to close some of the short again @6760, "lets not be too greedy this time, take profits when  we can"'? nope, price falls straight to 6500.

TLDR sell low, buy high, bitcorn does whatever it wants.
Tom Lee on suicide watch 
https://www.tradingview.com/chart/YDnHyC4O/

Posted this chart here yesterday. Wondering if it will play out.
Closing half my short from 8.4K here and locking in profit, don't want to regret it later if this bounces up off the triple bottom plus estimated funding at >-.1% is getting heavy with no relief next round. This 6.4-5 level has proven to be a local bottom, and even though I'm sure half of it is spoofing there is still more buy orders down to 6400 than there are up to 7000. BTW looking at the combined order book its absolutely insane how much Bitmex has completely taken over the market.


Nobody asked for my opinion but I'll bite. I'm out of a position right now because I think that's the only safe play. Two screenshots. First if 4h, 2nd is daily.

https://gyazo.com/f31d629a38dfa8ad13d9e884be81b378

So here what I see is a wedge in a downtrend. Not confirmed yet and these generally I don't trade these until they're confirmed because they fuck up all the time normally, and even more when acting as a reversal pattern. I love my triangles most of the time. 

Low volume also and we're closing below support but not really moving downwards which leads me to believe this isn't a very strong hold. (Some market guru once told me that was a sign of a reversal) Also if you look to the left it's at the same area as the pop we had last time. Granted, I don't trade off demand/supply areas, but I know people that do.

https://gyazo.com/3397436274a58f2bb1ff416fb18d8e91

On the higher timeframe is something I'm a little more wary of, which is a large falling wedge, but even thought it's confirmed many times over, I don't really feel comfortable trading it because it's sitting at such heavy support which I think if it breaks, this thing is just going to crumble.

Just my opinion though. Not in a position, just wanna see where this is taking us and I'll look for a nice higher timeframe pattern that I'm more comfortable playing.
Been on sidelines since mid March. Just bought in at 6616 with stops at 6380. Target 6800. Not leveraged but bought a few. I have a good feeling about this in the short term. The range has been way too tight and its bound to break up or down and the last small bounce gave me some confidence that we can break upwards a bit. I just stopped listening to all the noise in here because nobody including myself knows whats going to happen. Either or I'm playing with all profits so it's worth the gamble.
never change Bitcoin, never change
I've got a feeling it's going to be like this for a whale longer.
Finally chickened out and initiated a large (for me) wire transfer to my favorite exchange to get my cost average down. My thoughts are that it's looking really shitty at the moment. Bearish sentiment, charts painted with blood - and when I'm in doubt, I usually buy. We're a few months out from the big crash, may go a bit lower but I'm not expecting much drama. As usually happens when I decide to buy, the price will likely pump a bit, at least temporarily, before leaving me sitting on my bags.
We are currently in the downtrend channel from ATH, and if we stay in it until June the 1st, the best case scenario for BTC would be 3,5k. At this moment I do not see us breaking that resistance, not even in the near future. Been using this downtrend for a longer time, but I have never actually checked where do we go if BTC stays in this channel. 3,5k in less then two months, scary... [Blue lines channel](https://www.tradingview.com/x/CEcnAsWO/)

In that channel, we have even steeper downtrend channel, breaking that would be the first bullish sign for me [Purple line](https://www.tradingview.com/x/v6z6vKQO/)

My thoughts on this range, we have found very strong support [green dotted line](https://www.tradingview.com/x/B3PfQL5a/), this support so far seems incredibly strong, rejecting further fall three times already and still rejecting crash in this strong downtrend. 

While support is keeping BTC alive, there is lack of buyers at this moment, BTC stopped bouncing and none wants to risk their fiat for the small percentage of a profit in this manipulated market.

Soros information from today can be of a crucial importance, that made me even more insecure about market movement. Although he publicly told in January that BTC is in a bubble and a lot of people are expecting that he will short BTC to the ground, something fishy is going on. Why not start trading and shorting BTC on ATH or at higer prices, why start shorting it now? Especially if you are one of the top investors ever.

Today I am withdrawing all my crypto assets into FIAT and waiting for a stronger signals. I learned valuable lessons in this 4 months, invested in ATH as a complete noob, lost 20% of my portfolio, and managed to get it all back shorting on Kraken and buying the dips. I thank you all for your inputs here, if it wasn't for this subreddit I would be stuck with huge losses probably for couple of years. Thank you all and good luck with trading.
Long from 6530, target at 6900 with stops at 6450. I will exit early if time drags (24 hours) and the month-long downtrend becomes a threat. If we spike hard I'll move up target to 7000.

Looks like pretty much a nothing burger, but for the lazy:

>"George Soros called cryptocurrencies a bubble in January. Now his $26 billion family office is planning to trade digital assets, Bloomberg News’ Alastair Marsh, Saijel Kishan and Katherine Burton report.

>Adam Fisher, who oversees macro investing at New York-based Soros Fund Management, got internal approval to trade the virtual coins in the last few months, though he has yet to make a wager, according to people familiar with the matter. A spokesman declined to comment."
Last week when the price dropped to 6500 [for the first time after the big February drop] i used all my fiat to buy alts that i had kept to reinvest since January. 

Still not sure if it was a good or bad move, although I've been pretty lucky with my trades, most of which are based on my gut feeling + reading news + reading TA that are published by traders + [of course] reading this sub. 

Eh. It's getting harder and harder for me to believe that we are going to see a bull run anytime soon though.

EDIT: by no means I want anyone else to follow my steps, just wanted to share!
jesus christ,

the no of shorts atm.

i cant go short with the entire herd.


i cant figure this market out.\

have a very strong feeling we will retest 7.8 k since we didtn in the most recent fakeout.

think liquidating a bunch of nooby shorts right now would be perfect for liquidity when we really drop down .

have a supertiny short locked in at 6,6 k just t oget a foot in.

am going out now and fully expect to see a random ass green candle 
Charted some divergences I've been noticing.

A) 4 HR Chart: https://imgur.com/a/C2OT8

Could have already played out, could be still playing out. Indicates continuance of the bear though.

B) 1 HR Chart - Zoomed out: https://imgur.com/a/e4aHW

This looks pretty bearish, but also may have already played out.

C) 1 HR Chart - Zoomed in: https://imgur.com/a/s4EA1

This is starting to look both bearish and bullish. On the bearish side, we have very slight hidden bearish divs that may have already played out.

On the bullish side, we're starting to see some bull divs here as well. Would look to start seeing them on longer time scales before I make any calls though.

As far as chart patterns go, we've approximately met the "target" for this ascending wedge (4 Hr chart): https://imgur.com/a/jQi4M

You can maybe draw some not well formed bear flags as a result of that breakdown - a large one on the 4 hr that may be trying to break down (with that breakdown now forming a baby bear flag on the hourly). Not super confident in those formations though - the wicks make it a bit ugly.

I zoomed all the way in to the 15 min to look for divergences indicating maybe the direction this current consolidation breaks but I'm not seeing much of anything significant. You could maybe call it a slight bull flag but those 15 min bull flags haven't been breaking up very consistently lately.
The 15min BBands are getting _so_ tight:

Incoming price action, at last?
[This is taking longer than anticipated](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/7qh6ad/daily_discussion_monday_january_15_2018/dsqr8id/)

At the time of that comment, dentacoin had just crashed from its over $2 billion peak to under $600 million. Currently it's sitting at around $90 million. Close, but no cigar.
First time commenting here with my own TA, be gentle :) 

It's looking like we are going to set a higher low again on the daily i.e. above 6425 on bitfinex.  There is still hope for the bulls to turn this around.  I would love to see a bounce play out for a day or two, followed by setting another higher low.  Don't give up bulls, it's not over yet!
#Takeoff
Oh c'mon! I saw the price was up and got happy only to log in to Binance and see that I got stopped out at 6530 on a huge red candle right before the pump. I can't even believe this right now. Really thought I had set my stops wide enough to go long based on how tight it was all day. 
[deleted]
All right lads. I'll take one for the team.

Long at 6605.
SL at 6545.

Pray for me
Typical Inverted Bart Simpson pattern
*sigh*

The direction is down. UGH. This sucks.
Does anyone else start writing a really bullish/bearish comment, see the price move like $30-50 contrary to the sentiment of the comment you're currently writing, and then slowly backspace with your eyes on the price? lmao

It's really dumb because such small movements are complete noise but you're always like "damn, what if I look like an idiot 30 seconds after this is posted."
Today, /r/ethtrader has the most positive sentiment I've ever recorded for that sub.

Also, /r/CryptoCurrency has the most negative sentiment I've ever recorded for that sub.

Google Search trends seem to be flattening out after their huge drop-off.

/r/BitcoinBeginners has the closest positive [correlation](http://distributed.love:8081/correlation) of sentiment with the price, at 0.57. 

/r/Technology has the closest negative correlation, at -0.52.

[¿What is this?](https://www.reddit.com/user/samjhill/comments/85lycx/what_is_distributedlove/)
Seeing some pretty odd market behavior here:

https://imgur.com/a/MNvF1

The market broke down pretty undeniably from a consolidation pattern, but stopped well short of its target. 

I'd have expected to see fairly rapid decline down below $6,000 following the breakdown of that formation, but the market is choosing to hover just above $6,600 instead. 

The ultimate direction should be down once support-turned-resistance is tested at around $6,800 (give or take). Or possibly sooner if the market continues to dilly dally in the $6,600s for much longer.
So we've spent the last week or so wicking down to 6.6 or just below it, yet been unable to actually break through this 6.5-6.6 support range. Especially after the move we just saw about an hour ago, a long rn seems like kinda a no-brainer in terms of R/R - w/ tight stops right below support here. 

Also, not to go full-out hopium mode, but Adam & Eve definitely not not in play.. 
Here's some light reading for you all to enjoy: https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a2cb/196ba168829265145ede10ed42bd13efa848.pdf
Hit some of my limit buys last at around 8500 CAD. Increased my position for the summer boom! 
I've been experimenting with different types of volume manipulation and created my own OBV. Volume is indexed from BFX, GDAX, Bitstamp, and Kraken. I'm not trying to call a bottom, but with the available data I have, I don't see any reason to not start scaling into a LT position (albeit slowly). I think it's unlikely we'll reach sub-5k levels.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/93ihvUMn/
Wow, this is insanely boring today. I don't think I remember day with lesser volatility since morning dump than today. Not even 100$ movement
Today I am operating the same way I've been doing for the past week: open short just above 30 minute ema9 when it breaks upward with little volume.

[This is what I am seeing.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/3GP0z14s) Opened my short an hour ago at 6610.

Last night I opened a short and went to sleep and my SL triggered by 12 USD, so I couldnt profit from the big red candle, fuck me for sleeping right?

Today I am getting that money back. SL is really close, very little risk here.
The volume is anemic. Scary stuff.
Did GDAX update their fees? Taker fee now seems to be 0,30% instead of 0,25% previously (on BTC/EUR). 

https://www.gdax.com/fees

They did not make any announcement (previously 0,3% only applied to LTC and ETH). When did they do this? They added the new 'fee calculation' in the UI a couple days ago, though. 

0,3% is way too high, imo. They probably want to earn extra money in this low-volume bear market, but this will backfire. You can do on kraken and bitstamp 2 market orders for 0,3% (if you have around 250k trading volume, which is pretty low). On gdax you have one limit (0%) + market order (0,3%) for the same price (discount on gdax fees only apply if you trade more than 10 million volume, which is pretty high).
Shorts going parabolic, almost 10% more of them now than previous ATH.
Fake out?!?! 

 Haha I hate stop-loss triggers 
Look at the size of those 1 min candles!
[Shorts continuing to plummet, just under 1k closed since jump.](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/8O21NRkr/)
Still many underwater.
stop loss put me long at 6712.  Not sure about this bounce.  Looks like it stopped at the perfect spot to be another bart.  Will sell if it hangs for too long or drops below 6705.
these Barts are going to kill the market.  Maybe I'm just terrible at reading charts, but the only things I ever see now are gradual or extreme drops, sideways, and "oops, you missed it."

Since we’re all bored and are all familiar with the topic of Dutch Tulip Mania, I thought I’d share an article I referenced in a comment below. 

“For decades, economists have pointed to 17th-century tulipmania as a warning about the perils of the free market. Writers and historians have reveled in the absurdity of the event. The incident even provides the backdrop for the new film Tulip Fever, based on a novel of the same name by Deborah Moggach.

The only problem: none of these stories are true.”

“All the outlandish stories of economic ruin, of an innocent sailor thrown in prison for eating a tulip bulb, of chimney sweeps wading into the market in hopes of striking it rich—those come from propaganda pamphlets published by Dutch Calvinists worried that the tulip-propelled consumerism boom would lead to societal decay. “

https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/there-never-was-real-tulip-fever-180964915/


Closed my first ever leveraged trade ( long ) for a nice little profit. Feels pretty good but didn’t want to get greedy. Opened at 6575 and close at 6785. 
 I don't buy the idea it's going to $3K anymore than I did the run to $20K. The overly bearish sentiment in here in the belief that it's absolutely going much, much lower, is a sign to counter trade. Bull div on the 4hr and tons of shorts on the books can provide the fuel to move higher. 
The Equilibrium pattern may have just started a bear break. Entering short now. Hope to ride it until support @ 6400.
Closed my long. Figured it was better to pick a side. 
Who cares if Tether collapses, we have Bitcoin as a stablecoin now.
In my personal experience, whenever a cryptocurrency gets predictable, and you've played the market very well, and you feel like you're on top of the world... It's a good moment to close your positions, take a step back and consider that a reversal is coming. It happened to the bulls at $20k, it happened to the bears when it bounced from $6k to $11k.

Be craeful, everyone. Best if luck trading :) 
anytime we don't move up for a long period of time we tend to go down 200 dollars in a minute. I'm still long from 6500 but getting nervous.
This is getting nowhere fast. Setting alerts for ≤6.5k and ≥6.7k and walking away. GL to anyone trying to trade this/waiting for a breakout.
Bitfinex has a schizophrenic bot with a 200 coin wall bouncing from sell to buy. Even the bots are going crazy :)
Theoretically this stalemate should be forced to make a decision in 8 hours when it meets the resistance of the falling wedge (dotted pink line)

https://www.tradingview.com/x/cCEE2ZEP/
It didn't drop 200 dollars in 5 minutes... not sure if speaking preemptively here, but that seems like a good thing if youre long. 
really dont get it why shorts are pilling up here so much. its really not a good entry to open a short

bears seem to get weaker with every hour passing so far. 
This is always the fun part, when you see all of the other coins follow King Bitcoin upwards. 
Long from 6550 from way back and I am not sure if I close this or not. The support at 6600 and then held like a champion with a a quick sell off into the low 500s. 
Soros is coming.
Bull trap; liquidate the greedy shorts, reset indicators, and dump. Just like all the other times. 
so now you know where this thing will bounce to when we hit 5k's 

6.7k should be the new 7.8k resistance.

plan accordingly

Bloomberg : Selling pressure in cryptocurrencies could ease after tax day
Soros is going to long crypto mark my words.


His recent big buys: Overstock, Caesars, Dave and Busters.

4 hour stoch rsi has been bottomed for over a day now, think a buy here is decently 'safe' but the lack of buy pressure is scary.. think we most likely will get one more capitulation wick before we bounce hard
sure is taking it's time to drop more
Somewhat expected support at 6.5 here and more to come at 6.4 as people take profits and open some longs but I think this will be The One^^^TM that pushes us through 6.4 based on volume, our coolest long term RSI levels in the low 6's yet, and the giant 4hr bear flag we are currently breaking down out of
Bulls over at BFX try to cover their longs.

https://datamish.com/dashboard/db/btcusd?refresh=10s&orgId=1

Looks like it doenst work out for them.
Long $7m @ $6580. Expecting to close during a 5-10% spike, stops set at 5%.
1100+btc wall at 6500 is slowly being eaten. Down to ~~500~~ 48 now.
Added to my short at 6.65k. Thought we were going to get bart'd again but its holding up okay for now. Not sure how long we can keep testing 6.5k for but my money on us atleast touching it again soon.
So Geroge Soros is going to start trading cryptocurrencies. Normies always follow the big boys. Fomo? 
I bet Soros bought at $20k and that's why his eyes are so droopy 
On average, how many times a month do you trade? Also, what amount of profit do you consider a good trade? Few hundred? Few thousand? I know there are some big players out there that risk thousands at a time, but being a new trader I’m only risking extremely small amounts of fiat ( 100-300$ ) per trade. 
If I'm looking at it correctly, we need to pump all the way to 7500 to avoid bearish RSI divergence on the 1hr, and likely on the 4hr as well.
I'm not sure how everyone is bearish here... we are failing to make a newer low of any kind. The idiotic market sellers have been dumping the market brutally. whales have been shadow buying it. I think we are pretty close to marking the bottom.
Old support turned resistance?
Guys, do I get paid 5x the funding if I go 5x Long when shorts are supposed to pay longs? I'm assuming that since the amount we pay when we are supposed to pay fees goes up when we use higher leverages, the same applies to us receiving funding. Then is there anything stopping us from basically just opening positions 10 seconds before funding, then closing the position to profit easily? 

Edit: also, if I wanted to avoid paying fees could I theoretically close my position right before funding and re open afterwards? 
ascending triangle on the 30m
A lot of posturing on Finex... Bulls and bears both puffing up their coffer chests, then backing down, neither one willing to take the first swing.  It's funny to watch the depth charts, almost like a Nat Geo standoff.
Snorefest on GDAX right now. There's hardly any volume to speak of. 
Looks like market makers are just trading against each other now.  Margin longs and shorts are bored.  Every move that looks like momentum up or down, gets rejected.   It's pretty much flip a coin time. 
6hr chart had a red TD9 completion 3 candles ago.   That's a reversal signal right?

Same candle is forming the pole of a bear flag. 

Edit: note the previous 6hr red TD9 completion was the first breakdown from the previous 11.7 high, also ending in bear flag, and it kept going after that. 

Edit edit, oops, there was another after 9.1 breakdown and then it retraced all the way back up for a day after, then continued on its plummet down.  That one didn't end in a bear flag. 

Edit again, for those curious you can see TD on the drakdoo app. I think most charting services otherwise require paid accounts to see it. 
This perfect balance is becoming quite impressive.


Anyone pinging bitmexico servers for a cue on when it'll break up/down?
Flatline. Have all the weak hands been shaken out and all we have left are the holders that are supporting $6,600? What happens now? 
Bbands on the 15m are tight as a virgin bride. I'm betting it breaks up. Longing here, tight stop. 
Is 6k soon to be a long lost price level? Just like 9k was? And 8k? And 7k? 
Up it is then. k
sorry for the double post: but it is very obvious, some whales painted the charts. this action exactly 1 minute before the 1h closes again...
Exited [my long](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8a6k3w/daily_discussion_friday_april_06_2018/dwwo0oo/?context=3) from 6530 at 6900 (6899 technically). If we hit 6800 with the macd 5minute  bouncing off bottom without the 15minute breaking 0 I will scalp 6800->6900 again.
At this point I think the only fork necessary for bitcoin belongs in this subreddit. I feel like I can’t even scroll for 1 min without reading some preposterous claim about where the price of BTC is going, and some of these claims are made as if it WILL be 100% true. Btw thanks for those that have actually provided good info. Much appreciated.
WTF is going on. Looking at this chart the first thing that comes to my mind is a heart attack.
I'm no expert, but its starting to feel like we hit the bottom. If this keeps holding like it has been the past few days, I think a reversal is upon us.
"BTC price will range from 6k - 50k in 2018" - Ari Paul

Pretty well on the money prediction thus far.
Now that the stock market is declining I’d like to take a poll to see if the investment community really does view BTC as a proxy for gold / a store of value. I’m also interested in seeing how the broader market sentiment relates to crypto. 

UP VOTE IF:

1. You would be inclined to reallocate liquidity to BTC to hedge a traditional securities portfolio against a downturn 
2. You would only sell BTC to meet a margin call on a traditional securities portfolio as a last resort

DOWN VOTE IF:

1. You do not view BTC as a store of value or a hedge against broader market declines
2. You are actively looking to reduce BTC exposure as a result of the recent downturn in equities 

Thank you! 
this is genuinely starting to look like accumulation. Buyers are just being patient af and setting up huge buy walls and not letting it fall through

e: I don't mean A C C U M U L A T I O N with wall street bonuses and chinese new year, I mean it just really looks like buyers are willing to put up massive walls at $6k so it doesn't fall through. Like...ya know, accumulation, lol. 

Didn't think this would be so controversial. I just am surprised it hasn't fallen through yet. 

I wouldn't be surprised if it fell through still, but this is probably the most "unsure" I have been in it falling through $6k. I am probably overthinking/getting anxious due to a lack of follow through from sellers. 
[removed]
My original buy in was at 400 my last buy-in was 1k; and I did make money off the mania even if it wasnt much; why the fuck is 6.5 still getting to me
i dunno man, i can totally see a bounce to 7.5

before that we will dump to 6k or thereabouts to get some fomo shorts in and then bounce i feel,

maybe 5.8k even but i can totally see a bounce with the big money invovled in this game. 

traps everywhere.

25x tiny sized 15 min scalps is the best way to make money in this market i think lol 
I think BTC wants to break upwards but the overall bearishness sentiment exacerbated by the global economy looking shittier and shittier is keeping it down.  The amount of short positions is fucking insane - I'd be surprised if we don't see some kind of short squeeze push us up a little higher before it falls more.  This is a no-trade zone for me. 
Yesss.  Took profit from short *and* added to long at the bottom of that ridiculousness.

Edit: And by bottom I mean $0.5 from the bottom on the TP.
Way too obvious, whales. You guys really have no style. 

Not touching this. The elevator is back in service.
This dump feels like horseshit, until we get a new local low i'm fully expecting this to start pumping back up to 6800
Nearing a new '18 crypto market cap low.

Let's get down.
4hr stoch rsi on the bitmex chart, not other charting sites as it shows different values

is very bullish for a bottom and a imminent reversal, its been way oversold for 3 days almost, and historically its right where we should see a pump in the price.

Longer that remains oversold and we go sideways the chance of seeing much lower in the short term is greatly reduced

Narrowing BB, thin volume. A move is coming soon.

With shorts at an ATH, and the price not moving, a lev long up to 5x is "safe" easy money imo
Seems there is a big FUD\-story in the making: [https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8ad509/polish\_authorities\_has\_seized\_almost\_400\_mln\_eur/](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8ad509/polish_authorities_has_seized_almost_400_mln_eur/)

some highlights, its actually fun to read. 

" Everything began with the construction of the Belgian embassy in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  "

" The employees of the Lidl warehouse in Zgierz handed out policemen, discovering in a load of bananas from Colombia, nearly 387 kg of pure cocaine.  "
When I woke up the price was at 6610, when I had dinner the price was at 6610 and now the price is at 6610 when I go to bed. This is the most sideways I have ever seen this market, and exactly the reason why I exited for the time being.
This will probably break 7k overnight again, just because of the absolute fucking hysteria im seeing due to a 200 dollar pump makes me think every randomer is waiting for any sign to be bullish and fomo in - anecdotal at best but call it a 'gut' feeling
[removed]
Interesting. Seems like someone is in the initial stages of learning a very expensive lesson about the difference between moving the price and moving the market.

You can move the price of, say, Enron up very easily with enough money and BS. But eventually the market calls your bluff.

You can move the price of Bitcoin down the same way... for a while. But the market is another thing.
I don't know about you guys, but I'm buying. We're going to have some kind of return to normal phase sooner than later.

Off course I don't know if this is the exact bottom, so I keep a little ammo in my pocket to buy even lower, but I'm 70% in.
[removed]
Just when the USA goes to sleep and Europe are barely awake.
had closed my short from yesterday at 6.6

tempted to open one, but wont.

considering the shorts being at an ath. will see a bounce in the 6k range. 

will short then.

somethings off in this market, and when something is off, better to stay out.

Just noticed we seem to be riding and flirting with breaking a long term log support line I hadn't noticed before (dark gold)

What a fakeout.
Well that was fun. Welcome back to the 6.6k swamplands.

Now we can stop complaining that the 15min BBands are too tight!
[deleted]
Is it true that all the large down and up candles are painted by whale orders? The market is totally played by whales?
dump is imminent imo
I told you so. I noticed some really genuine buying for once in the 6.6 area so I don't think this is over, be careful with your "same bart shit 100% guaranteed". Never be 100% sure.
What makes anyone think this time is different? These sudden pumps have been the best short opportunities for the past month 
Bears still cannot break 6500.  After the Kraken whale defended it for 7 million or so, it just won't fall (been opening longs whenever we hit it, as every time we bounce).  
Making my first ever leveraged trade. Looking to go long around 6550 with 2x leverage. Stops at 6475. Just have a gut feeling we will breakout upwards and hopefully break the 6,800 resistance. Not sure if this is a smart first trade. But scared money don’t make money. 
Lol wtf is happening 
Question to the US folks: is the tax pay day that big of a deal and are people selling their crypto stacks to pay them?

All we need is simple $500 dump which was all common the past weeks to find the bottom  and somehow seems difficult...no idea why. 
Opened a small short mostly just so I can say "I CALLED IT" in case I win this coin flip 

(and also because trend is friend, since 11.7 we've rarely had this much flat action and it not resulted in a breakdown or only a brief break up, I feel confident about being underwater in this to 7k without breaking a sweat, if this breaks it could be a great entry, and it's a small position)
$1000 a second volume change on Binance for BTC / USDT - Not used to seeing it so slow and flat.
Do you need special permissions to post links in here?
Is there any news coming out that could have an effect on the next few days?
Seems like bulls have been playing rope-a-dope all day. Maybe bears getting tired.

By the way, does anybody know why GBTC paid another dividend? Are they loaning coins and collecting interest? Sure hope so! 
IT MOVED?!

hey I'll take down over flat, at least it's more interesting
Well that was fun to watch but this makes no sense to me so I'm gonna stay on the sidelines. "The game is rigged, but you cannot lose if you do not play."
10 minutes for the daily close (probably at 6600 :)), hopefully that will trigger some action.
Did a market buy at 6642 when I noticed volume spiking and was able to scalp a profit at 6795. Feels like this could go higher though.

Ok, now i believe it, it will go more down.pwaah..

Isn’t this the usual Friday night pump.. Get the drunk Americans buying.. then they buy more when it’s still up Saturday morning.. Sell off Saturday afternoon?
Don't cover your shorts.
Is it just my hopium that is seeing the bull divergence on the 1 hour chart? Any thoughts on its validity?

https://www.tradingview.com/x/N4UkMOvt/

At the end of the day I don't see too many reasons why we would turn around right here when we dropped through 7.2k twice now...

But I'm still looking at that bull div ;)
So is there a TA formation name for flags that break in the opposite direction? Or is it part of the larger Bart formation. Asking for myself and not my friend (fuck him).
I'm betting on a squeeze with tight stops
Seriously..... Right back at 6600.... Just when I thought things were getting interesting. 
After 9 years of price discovery, $6600 turned out to be the most agreeable price for a bitcoin. I think that's kind of fascinating.
Anyone else think we’re likely headed to new highs with this nice pump? Happening VERY fast this pump.

#bullish


Edit: this was a joke people... a joke meant to mock how fast attitudes tend to change in this thread.. sorta comical sometimes.
8th Januar: Bitcoin price @ 17k Bitcoin shorts @ 12k

6th April: Bitcoin price @ 6.6k Bitcoin shorts make new ATH @ 33.2k
Its offical: BTC shorts \> BTC longs
My current plan is to buy all the things at 6k and then turn off the computer for a week.

What could go wrong.
My psychological bottom is about $4800, I'm not worried about falling to $5k right now. Just my 2¢ of sentiment.
If you're a bull what's the best case scenario here? We break out of the ascending triangle on the 30 min and make it to, what, $7K at absolute best before being smacked down again?

Seems like the R:R just isn't there compared to the explosive down move that will happen if this ascending triangle doesn't break up soon. Even bulls may as well just join the herd and short @ ~$6.6K with liqui above $7.2K and be done with it.




[deleted]
Massive buy/sell walls between $6500-$6600. Whales are battling, and some massive bullwhale clearly is accumulating below $6500. I seriously doubt we drop below that point today.
[removed]
Shorts at [ATH](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/1ZDhvvrT/#) boys, you know what to do. 
The day I get upvotes for a bearish comment is the day I will start considering buying back in.
So who is in fiat, who’s short, who’s long, who’s holding BTC

I’m holding, every last UTXO I can call my own is in the ice box. got a couple k on Dax for some knife juggling
The 15m bollinger bands are only $30 apart!
When you are start to get a bit less tired and hope for action when BTC of all assets move 10$, you know the market is in zombie mode...
Can gemini please come back online. Is there any information on the eta on completion of maintenance?
Well ETH is avoiding an anti-ASIC hard fork because their devs are thankfully smarter than their Reddit community. That's probably good for Bitcoin and just crypto as a whole when the second largest coin isn't going through contention.

bääm 6.9k, here we go! george soros bought ze dip!
good to see "the Oldies " posting here....

good sign..

Soon reversal.
Happy weekend... and keep smiling all.

Surely people can't be surprised by this? Next stop will be 6k as I said yesterday before getting shot down. It's a bear market and a harsh one.

It ain't over till it's over. It will end but not for a good while yet. All about 5.8k now.. If that doesn't hold expect the flood 
Okay, sentiment in here is becoming a caricature of itself. Where does this fit in that bubble chart?
Looking like a potential break upwards? BBands so tight it’s about to spring one way or the other real soon
if the price would be 6666 we would at least know the devil is behind that.

what a non\-event,  I expected a fakeout after this coma ... but not a return to coma.

Wall lifted as I thought + bullsih div on the 15min + too many shorts; going long
HOLD strong 6600. Much love

I'm buying a bit here. I look at the classic bubble chart and even if we go lower I see this as pretty much 'the mean' part of it.

Many think this is the guy giving us the bart patterns, and he got rekt in the last few hours. Lost 80 coins since yesterday. Maybe even more...

Pretty entertaining analysis of BTC here thought I'd share with the community. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AiPkHzfhg
Someone else mentioned earlier, but look at this classic A&E chart vs. the 4 hour (Currently at the beginning of Eve upswing, no confirmation).  Thoughts?

[EMC A&E Example](https://imgur.com/a/7AY3s) 
Trying to find this confluence zone of resistance at 6605 - 6610 (GDAX) and noticed that on the 15 min chart, EMA 12 and 26 are coinciding and currently sit right in this zone. Easiest TA ever?

Either way this baby range is no trade zone for me.

Edit: Short contracts are ATH now
two big 49btc bitfinex bites and we are off
Just woke up to this line. Does this mean we’ve bottomed out or are close to it?
How long do y'all usually hold your positions for? I've been holding my short position for about 2 days now, fees are slowly chipping away at my profit, and I'm only using 2x leverage. 
Now the question will be where do we stop? 6800? 7000?

Edit: All that movement and how many shorts have closed? 300. Only 300 have closed. I think we'll be testing that 7.2k resistance again.
Got stopped at 6840 but exceeded my original target of 6800. Not sure if I should be happy or not. Hard to buy back in now. On GDAX alone lots of resistance to 7K
The fact that this pump started exactly at 18:00 shows how genuine is that.
Gotta say that 6600 is an odd looking trough on the 1hr
Shorts at an ATH...

The trees can't keep growing forever. There may still be room - until there isn't.
Don't buy here. Trap.

Don't close your short.
Tempted to reopen my short here, buyers want 6.5 but not 6.6? Sounds like a bluff and soon enough they will run for the exits if one of them doesn't pump it big time. 
[removed]
We are forming a default base around 6600.
Price is pretty stable and shorts keeping increasing and longs keep decreasing on finex. Funding is also twice that of longs at .015%. I wouldn't be surprised if we make another move up here and test 7k. I'll be opening a small long here and if we make a move down I'll add to it.

Edit: We broke down from the triangle so as I stated I will add to my long to average my entry down. 

Edit 2: Shorts shot up another 1k on this drop. I'm surprised people are adding to shorts now and also when rates are high and we are about to make another low. It'll be interesting to see what happens from here. I'll be adding longs all the way down to 6k and keep my liquidation below 5k. I could easily see a whale here buying a lot right now just to make the shorts hurt so I feel the risk of shorting now is just too high. 
Anyone else getting pumped when looking at all the charts?? Think there are going to be alot of opportunities to make some big gains this year.

bigger picture: [https://imgur.com/a/7DV9L](https://imgur.com/a/7DV9L)

next resistance line from the wedge and the downtrend beartrend line, 1 time linear scale, 1 time log scale.

the support line could be seen as a long term support line. before we broke it it was our resistance in the Sept. bull run.
My first short sell was filled at 6890 but apparently we went up all the way to 6920 tonight. 

My hunch about the low volume bulltrap of doom was correct.

[removed]
shorted last night at 6754, stop loss was 6933, moved it to 6666.

hoping this bounce is RSI cooling off on short time frames and dump commences but what the fuck do i know. rather move my stop loss and get chopped than go underwater.

learnt that lesson the hard way

edit: 15 mintue getting tight, expecting a jump

edit2: closed at 6609. tiny profit but that drop wasnt convincing enough for me. thinking bears are running out of steam
Did GDAX change their fee structure in the last few days?

Surely it's something they'd notify their customers of in advance, but I can't find any correspondence from them recently about it.  (we've been trading at a loss on some markets because of it, not sure for how long)
I’m pretty shite at spotting divs but looks like hidden bear div on the 1hr for the past day? Is that right or does it even matter given these wacky movements?
Now this is the 2017 model btc I was starting to forget. You blink, you are 10k usd richer.

Side note: ETH:BTC 12h Bbands have not been that tight since at least August 2017.

With a static BTC price of $6600 a guy like Jeff Bezos could buy up every single Bitcoin with his own net worth, that is how cheap bitcoin is right now.
So many people expect this V\-Shaped bottom in the 5k region here. It really seems BTC cannot really reverse without such a V\-pattern. I just doubt it will happen cause everybody expects that.

Bitfinex shorts seem to be at an all time high: [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BITFINEX:BTCUSDSHORTS](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BITFINEX:BTCUSDSHORTS)
not sure if it has been mentioned before or not (I'm guessing it probably has, and I just missed it), but it looks like volume on Kraken has been at all time highs recently.  Probably a bearish sign that Americans who don't want to risk VPNing on BitMEX or Bitfinex are going short.
Love how all the equities folks are freaking out over a 3% swing.
I'm feeling a flash-crash down to $5000 and then head back towards the falling log resistance line. Based on number of shorts outstanding and maximum pain
Does anyone with available fiat sitting on the sidelines have a magic number in mind for when they might buy btc?

The number $3500 sticks out at me. I feel like I’d buy a lot for $3500. I’m not sure why... it just sorta feels appealing.

Maybe a question like this could help give us an indication of the true bottom.
[removed]
https://blockchain.info/charts/n-unique-addresses

Number of unique addresses used in transactions is at July 2017 levels when BTC was sub 2k.  Not the only indicator of where we SHOULD be in terms of price but bitcoin is now less used and more expensive than anytime in recent history.

Bullish

EDIT: this is better than i first thought, the levels are comparable to mid 2016 at the trough of the last bear market. Amazing.

Closed the last of my short at 6.6. 

Time for delusional bulls to pump it so I can drop the hammer on their heads.

maybe some whale really wanna rekt this shorters large scale. just imagine we break throught the resistance of the small wedge bringing us through the resistance of the big wedge and that finally brings us through the resistance of the 19k bearmarket trend line...

we are not done ...this is going higher.. Stoch RSI has more room to rise and MACD is about to bullish cross on 4HR
hey bears,

again, dont over levg ur positions.

have atleast 50% of ur stack in reserve.

dont go beyond 10x (considering ur 10x from 7k that is ) \

i would love to see a short squeeze but lets just hit 6k and bounce please.

6600 long triggered last night as I slept, and I must say it took longer than I expected to break my way.

Gonna put a stop in at 6700, but it probably won't hit.  Friday party time, then sleep like a baby again. This looks like it could ride up a looong way.

PS - if we don't see another "Kobayashi" dump this weekend, this chump is done and you might want to add to your hodl stacks.
Did you miss me? CHAD IS BACK IN TOWN. Bend over bears, time for a spanking!

The real double bottom is that 5840 haha that silly market fakeout. 

edit: Why is this getting downvoted? It's a valid point I've been advocating the past couple days (that the pump could be a fakeout) that seems more reasonable than half the comments in the same period. Not my problem y'all are salty for taking the market's bait.

http://money.cnn.com/data/markets/dow/ has more action than BTC today

what about stocks and bitcoin moving together, regardless up or down ? is that also over
I would add to the bullish case that the CME and CBOE futures volumes are growing steadily and the Coinbase just began its first custodial accounts yesterday.  The necessary infrastructure is just beginning to be in place for onramping institutional money.  That interest is there and it is similar to your friends who want to DCA to build a position, but they haven't had a proper way to do that.
> Reasons to stay bearish in short term:

* US, tax day 16th of april.

> Reasons to stay bullish in mid term:

* consensus 2018 in may. 
Last death cross was followed by a rally afaik, should actually be under mid term bullish. 
Death criss is a lagging indicator, IMO.
>Merchant adoption is decreasing (maybe even negative) 

What are you basing this on?
I havet been keeping a log or anything but still keep seeing plenty of “this site now accepts [insert crypto] as payment” threads pop up. 
Seems an odd point to make so soon after coinbase release their merchant processing, that if anything seems to me to be a consolidation of adoption. 

My main issue is that I’m finding it hard to justify spending mining profits right now with btc so low. 
I agree with this.

Overall sentiment seems to be we're either at the bottom, or Bitcoin could go another leg down to ~4800-5000 and level off with that as our new bottom. Either way sub 3K is looking unrealistic right now. We're discovering our new price, the bear market can only last so long.
It has been a while, but bitcoin has had two corrections of 94%, plus corrections of 85%, 76% and 72%, according to this chart. Not saying it will happen again, but btc does have a history - https://contrarianinvestor.net/posts/2017/12/22/major-bitcoin-corrections-2010-2017
BTC likes crashing 90%. Check the history. 
Lol at $4000 being worst case, try best case for the bagholders. Worst case is $0 and yes that’s quite realistic long term, but probably not in this bear. I think bottom of this bear is 1-2k, 1 last bullrun to 20k double top in a few years and then long slow decline towards worthless
who was that guy here that was going to be on a plane and/or asleep for 24 hours straight?  It was nice of the crypto market to take the day off for him.
This is what the half year ETH was stuck at 300$ felt like :P
it took us 9 years to reach this equilibrium.
Meanwhile, trading bots are having a circle jerk blowing each other off in a $60 range. So dull...
Still $66 off....
I"m gonna put my bitcoin on tha table. 
Hey man I was thinking more like $6609
If anyone is willing to sell their bitcoin at $6599.99, please pm me. 
See you tomorrow.
Enjoy it man! Rainy and cold here, just like my crypto soul.
Interesting. Thank you!
My 6820 short with 20% hit my profit target, small profit to be honest. I'm waiting for another bounce and see if I go heavier for the weekend, anything above 6800 would be golden. Might try to scalp a small long right now as well.
Nice catch. We've been mirroring this move from january and you can also see the falling wedge there : https://www.tradingview.com/x/zsibIOLZ/ 
I also missed the same TP this morning.  I've adjusted my plan nearly exactly the same as you.

But I still have most of my profit taking around 6480, with just a small amount at 6510.  Maybe I should move some of my lower 6000 takes up to that 6510...

A difference on the upward direction, I'm also closing out nearly 50% of the position if we get back up to 6700, to lock in some profits below the CA (which is now 6760).
At 6760 I close out another 50% of what's left of that, and the rest of it closes at 6860.  Because at that point of upward movement I can make a new better entrypoint if I still feel like shorting.  (I'm still debating on perhaps just closing out all of it at break even, but I think the extra layering there will be nice in case of wick catching, and there is very little loss locked in with the rate at which I scale it out on the upward.)
people used to think that gods had a soap opera going on up above the clouds, too.
There *are* big guys pushing it up and down... they just don't really give a big shit about which way it ultimately goes, change sides all the time, and make money in either case.

The cheerleading is ridiculous.
Leave us kids alone, life is simpler when you can take a side.
We're all bored waiting on the price to move.  Its a lot more exciting when you can pretend theres an ongoing epic battle being waged in the meantime.
And yet there is a "war" going on between bulls and bears, or shorters and longers if you prefer, and the war is motivated by financial interests (which war isn't?).
So mad I canceled my limit buy 
Jebaited 
This ^
Yes, some saw it as a fakeout but imo it's more bullwhales defending every $ and trying to exhaust bear whales, playing the clock rather than spending too much in a pump that will be sold into.
Dunno but we're looking at the same chart, I'm not a TA expert, does that mean we should see the next move soon ? up or don, but I guess it's not gonna flatten like that for a day..
Eh, honestly volume isn't awful. It's not too far off of other temporary consolidation zones we've had in this bear market. You still see a 100 BTC market buy on BFX every now and then and some large sells too. Difference is that it just hasn't been moving the price today and there's been zero follow through on both sides. There'll be a couple minutes with 200 BTC market bought moving the price $20 then 10 minutes later we've retraced $15. Same with market sells.

The insane part is usually when there's this volume we're at least oscillating in a $60-$100 dollar range, not $30. Definitely think when it does move it'll be quick and on very high volume.
this is the power of more shorts than longs currently open.
I think it is long term for a sizable bounce off a low, I have fiat sitting in Gemini waiting for reentry. 

But the problem won't be getting people like me back in once we get closer to 2-3x where we were last year, it will be getting the retail investors back in. Far too many got burned last year buying in at >10K and this whole crypto thing is becoming more and more synonymous with "ponzi" among my nocoiner friends. To them the 19K moon and subsequent crash didn't confirm that its the future, but that it was a bubble.
People need to realize that there is a time and place for being a bull and being a bear. Prices going up forever is unsustainable  (permabulls) and nobody wants to just sell an asset into oblivion (permabears). We need a balance of both for a healthy long-term market 
Well, the passing of time has always been bullish for bitcoin. It would take a piece of news that kills bitcoin to ensure it doesn't ever bubble again.
I think the majority of BTC shorters (at least here) are simply doing so to acquire more BTC or to hedge cold storage stacks. People savvy enough to trade BTC (and not get instarekt) are probably at least cautiously long-term bullish. 
Speaking for myself who held through the 2014-2016 bear market, the longer this current one draws out the less urgency I feel in buying whatever price we hit whether it be $6000, $5800, etc, if it goes that low. My optimistic opinion is that we will probably range sideways between $5K-$8K for months before we see any significant price action. While trying to catch the bottom based on TA is what a lot of people are trying to do, I'm looking for a change in market sentiment as I am looking for entry for a long term hold. Hearing that price should go up because of a short squeeze screams bearish to me. Even bearish than 2014-2016 because in hindsight there was so much to look forward to in terms of adoption and technological advances (segwit, LN). Well now that we've made leaps and bounds in that aspect, what's next? What's the next growth driver? We've clearly hit a serious bottleneck and I don't believe TA is going to get us back anywhere near ATH or even half that.



> sounds like a pretty bullish long term indicator to me... thoughts?

I would take it with a huge pinch of salt as an indicator, the people posting here are not the average jonny come lately who stores all his BTC on his Coinbase App and goes to youtube shills for his trading advice.
>It sounds like the majority of people here who think the price will continue to drop fully intend to buy BTC *at some point.* 
>
>sounds like a pretty bullish long term indicator to me... thoughts?

Bullish from a lower entry point, perhaps. 
Completely agree.  I believe much of the money that exited the market between 20k and now has not left for good.  It is sitting on the sidelines waiting for the market to turn around.  My opinion is that once it happens, it’s going to happen quick. 
Nice, no airplane wifi for you!

I don't think that a short here has anything left than a few hundred scalp if anything.  Anyway you're making a good risk management decision imo. 
6600 Chad just has that charm BTC can't resist. 
5 million in longs were liquidated, i guess the uptrend was caused by longs trusting 6500 won't fall 
Closed half at 6550. What do you think is the target of this dump/fall ?
I wouldn't be surprised if the price action works out being mostly sideways at this point, just with bigger swings.
That's good news. The bottom is going to be where fud and bad news don't push the price down. I'm not sure if this is it, but it's a data point
I'm thinking something along the same lines, 6-ish months of stagnation followed by a very slow grind up 

Before that though, one more major leg down to truly reach despair
My Buy orders or now between 2k and 3k at random numbers, hoping for a Mega Panic after the Next Support Level Breaks Down.
2 or 3 more months bottom around 5k I reckon
I think at least 6 months of downward movement
i am betting on the 3k region around june 2019
We are already in accumulation fase
this market feels so.. degenerate. During that bounce, all the major coins moved in coordination and sync. Just like every movement in January, February, and March. Across all exchanges.. I probably counted 15 separate times across the last 3 months that all the coins moved exactly the same way, down to the second, across all exchanges. Ugh. NEO, LTC, BTC, every up and down is identical. For months. On all exchanges. Everything seems completely scripted. This is no natural market.
Could be in for another sequel of yesterday's rangebound choppy stalemate
M-m-m-m-m-m-maximum pain
Use the 60 week EMA and it becomes even clearer what's going on ;)
Ah yes. The bloody battle is finally coming I heard so much about at 17k......and at 14k....and at 12k.....and at 9k...and.....shit. 
This one? https://imgur.com/a/mAC58
The test have bee running the past few weeks. Have not seen it in a few days, but there was some really odd behavior that look indicitive of market testing. I have long suspected once crypto passed 100 billion it would attract bigger, smater players with their mega dollars and better bots. Crypto has moved to the high stakes tables.
I wouldn't get my hopes up at this stage but you might be right. There doesn't seem to be much 'organic' selling (or buying, tbh) going on. **If** this continues for a week or more, or even ranges between 6.4k-8k, I'd be comfortable thinking about a potential reversal.
ehh it's about even 
> SEC Quietly Puts Bitcoin ETF Proposals Back on the Table .

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sec-quietly-puts-bitcoin-etf-005046446.html

in my opinion, it's just a matter of time before they approve

For the lazy:

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has quietly begun considering two Bitcoin ETF proposals, public documents show.

According to SEC documents dated March 23, the agency has instituted formal proceedings to determine whether to approve a rule change that would allow NYSE Arca to list two exchange-traded funds (ETFs) proposed by fund provider ProShares.

ProShares Bitcoin ETF and ProShares Short Bitcoin ETF would each hold Bitcoin futures contracts, providing retail investors with the ability to indirectly invest in the flagship cryptocurrency — or bet against it — through a familiar investment product.

“The Commission is instituting proceedings pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)(B) of the Act to determine whether the proposed rule change should be approved or disapproved. Institution of such proceedings is appropriate at this time in view of the legal and policy issues raised by the proposed rule change,” the order says.

ProShares had first proposed these two funds in September — before CBOE and CME had launched their Bitcoin futures products — and NYSE Arca began seeking SEC approval to list these funds in December.

However, as CCN reported, the SEC requested that fund providers withdraw their Bitcoin ETF applications and issued a statement expressing reluctance to approve these products until more investor protections are put in place.

Last month, Chris Concannon, president of CBOE, penned a letter to the SEC asking them to consider Bitcoin ETF proposals on a case-by-case basis rather than as a product class. He noted that CBOE has successfully cleared several rounds of Bitcoin futures expirations without incident and said that the Bitcoin markets are rapidly maturing and could soon warrant a regulated ETF.

Per SEC guidelines, the proposed rule change will be published in the Federal Register, after which the public will have 21 days to comment and an additional 14 days to submit rebuttals to other comments.

Comments can be submitted through email or the SEC website, and commenters should reference file number SR-NYSEArca-2017-139 on the subject line.



And it still might reach that price!
[deleted]
If ETF is accepted, I think $3500 would be reasonable as a price.
They are on track for a series of delays for nearly a year, just like Winklevii and SolidX.

As we learned from those aforementioned ETF processes, the SEC rarely outright disapproves proposals until the very end. They basically just don't approve and leave it to the submitter to pull out. 
we have found the final price of Bitcoin apparently
weekend dip inbound though?
Nice, congratulations.   Good timing on the buy IMO. 
Got targets for the other 75%, or going by feel?
I don't think it makes sense to take a short position here for anything more than a scalp. It looks like we're somewhere near the end of both a corrective fifth wave and/or a corrective C wave. When the bottom is firmly established we're probably going to find ourselves in a slow rise that doesn't show clear signs of having escaped the bear market. It will be gradually harder to be a bear and it wont make a lot of sense why.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/RJ3YKgEd/
You can't really call it divergence until the daily turns back up again. We're in the middle (maybe) of a downward movement on the daily so RSI could still continue lower. I see you said something like that at the end, but just wanted to clarify it's not showing divergence at all until the market turns.
> make sense to ride the bear

The 5 minute candles on Finex show the push for breakout with consistently being denied - like a raging animal that has been kept in captivity for years and is now seeing the bright light; but as you said still in captivity (bear trend)
To scam people.
So is anyone trading the $10 swings?  Still more than 100x volatile than a normal forex day ;)
Or they might both trigger and by the time you view the price it's back at 6610
>  which is just some tumblr shit

lmao what
You might be right. I think we're going to follow the same [sideways trend that happened in 2013](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BLX/D77ZTaQb-Bitcoin-macro-view-non-linear-regression/).
Thanks for the shout-out! I just wanted to warn people to be careful about shorting the bottom right now. This could swing either way over the next few hours, and you don't want to be caught holding the bags.
Agreed, but the whales seem to be using TA as well. Most movements happen at key points. Majority of whales are pushing every chance of recovery down though. They want cheaper coins.
It's gonna go to 6801 then 6399.  You know how this works.
If this nerve-wrecking stagnation continues for several more hours, it might break up from the larger falling wedge - which would probably mean WAY UP!

https://www.tradingview.com/x/MDuZuej3/
That's equivalent of a stop-buy at 6800 or a stop-sell at 6400 but with less fees.

lol,

i usually do this when the market is confused and iam confused.

the same,

i went long on the sept futs and short on the jun futs. 

took ur advice from last time. 

both at the exact same price ~6.5

no auto stops though, will reevaluate once this breaks eitehr way 
nice hopium sir.
Or a breakout under $6.5k, triggering a breakout under $5k, triggering more record lows for the year.
4-11 will be most informative as to which direction the market really wants to go, and it seems to be north.
I think you've put the cart before the horse here.....but if any asset could do it, it be Bitcoin.
I've been thinking the same, waiting for these cascading scenarios to play out, hoping for an ascending triangle to be the butterfly that flapped it's wings....but it broke down last night.
So optimistic. I suspect many underwater longs will use every little bounce to cut their losses.
Decrease position size and implement stop losses to cut away the emotion.

Tom Lee told me 9000 was the bottom

I literally turned my head for 5 minutes to look at some code on my other screen... it's always impressive
that was a killer whale pun
But what about the 2k doom Bois?

I’m a permabull mostly holding xmr, but it’s starting to feel like super painful.

You have been here since $200. Why are you DCA'ing at these prices?

Not sure about that downtrend channel from ATH. Many have it here: https://www.tradingview.com/x/qqe7nHmG/
> invested in ATH as a complete noob, lost 20% of my portfolio, and managed to get it all back

Impressive. Really.
> Why not start trading and shorting BTC on ATH or at higer prices, why start shorting it now? Especially if you are one of the top investors ever.

Because shorting isn't the only way to trade, perhaps. 
Nice entry
You Sir have balls. I longed 6515 and closed @6630 for quick profit 
Good plan.

Been building a long with a similar plan.  Have buys going all the way down to 5000 on sept futs.  I'm being more flexible on the potential sell target, but first TP would probably be 7k-ish, and I could even see holding onto this for months (though I could let it go within days).
Wasn't George Soros the guy that made his fortune from crashing the British Pound? 
that's good news, we can finally blame Soros if BTC goes down Kappa
Do alts hit usually their bottom the same time
As ETH and BTC or is there usually a lag?
[deleted]
Candles are out of stock. Would you be interested in a long multi-color horizontal channel? But has to be a narrow one, we're also out of wide channels.
Don’t take this the wrong way. Based on your post, I think it’d be prudent to work on your trade hygiene as well as develop a bit more mental stability in this admittedly volatile markets. It’s tough but you have to be a cold hard killer in this racket to succeed. 
After 12 hours of stagnation, it's official: we have finally discovered the real price of Bitcoin - 6600 - nobody wants to sell it for less, nobody wants to buy it for more. /s
Can't even break the BBands :)
Just pierce then and back inside.
also quite low comment count here, another action might come soon indicator :D
Yeah, I can't remember the last time I saw the 15 min BBands this tight.

Edit: maybe some movement in the close of this 4 hr candle / beginning of the next?
I’ve been using Dentacoin as my canary in a coal mine as well. I look at AntShares roughly a year ago with a market cap close to $7m and say Dentacoin’s valuation should be closer to that than to $90m. When that happens, it means the real purpose altcoins will have discovered a true price.
Lol dentacoin is your indicator.

I prefer ETH, the flagship of all shitcoin, when this will be back to 35$ I would say that the shitcoin madness is over and can peacefully go long on BTC.
Well I'm bearish and holding a short position so here's to setting a lower Low :) 
Your stops can never be wide enough to be safe from Bogdanoffs hunting them down.
I always set my stops 100 over what I think it'll be just for this reason. 
Yes, I realized that as I played. Now I limit myself to one or two trades per day, and it's been pretty successful so far. Low risk moves, tight stop loss, a little bit of TA (and fractals, those sweet fractals) and a lot of self restraint and you can make a good amount of money.
I just stopped paying attention tbh

it's a lot easier and nicer when you only look every few hours 
Yep just like any other investment 
I like to think of it as Jedi Master time. Lock in entry an exits and wait....just....*wait*.

Then fight the existential dread when the market does something completely different.
I agree with you. Although most of the traders have been loosing now awaydays if they have the patience maybe...
I’m going monk. I gotta go monk. Pray to the great spirit. 
That's a tight stop, I don't think you need prayers.  
I’m long from this area as well. Jesus take the wheel. 
You planning on taking profits at 6612? /s
Tells how meaningless those cocksure predictions of future prices are.
Every damn time. 
Our brains are funny. Or you're reading some really bullish/bearish conspiracy, and then you look at the price and its starting to move that direction, and you're like "whoa....could it be"
>what if I look like an idiot 30 seconds after this is posted.

Just post it. Most posts here look idiotic instantly. At least you got 30 seconds.
you can add /opposite to each bearish/bullish keyword
A big number of people on /r/ethtrader bought in somewhere between $40 and $200, held through the peak to $400 that dumped to low $100s, then sat through half a year of sideways grind around $300 all the while basically every other crypto posted x10 gains. The subsequent peak to $1000+ dumping back to high $300s is familiar territory to many, I'd imagine.

Also, a lot of people that are heavily into ETH genuinely believe it's the best crypto project there is; I'd imagine they have as much if not more 'brand loyalty' as the most hardcore BTC fanboys 5 years ago did. 
/r/ethtrader is deluded basically all the time. the degree just varies
guessing because ethtrader thinks they've found their bottom
Are you still out of position? I'm going to be traveling and then sleeping for 18 of the next 24 hours, over a fri/sat no less, and I think fully exiting my short (6750) here and sitting on the sidelines might be the best place for me.

A weird bear pennant type formation with two fakeouts inside a falling wedge...I mean...I still think the path of least resistance is down, but odd market behavior indeed: https://www.tradingview.com/x/fFAHprX6/
Chew, this could just be recency bias, but do you feel like you've been describing market movements as "odd" more and more recently?
this is why i closed my short. opened at 6750, the consolidation made me think we would see a pretty big jump and i put a bet that it will be down. got the direction right but not the momentum so i closed at 6609.

Considering longing but im not really in a hurry to take a position
[deleted]
The only thing is you can say that about resistance too 
It's nice to have your wife and child co-authoring papers with you. Brings new meaning to collaborative relationships... 
This makes for some great bedtime reading...I'm halfway through the abstract and my eyelids already feel droopy.
quad?
If you're not incorporating Bitmex, you're missing perhaps the most meaningful volume data.
Yet why did I spend almost all day with an eye on the charts. I swear to god I watch the charts more when they're stagnant. 
I like low volatility periods. Something about stable market prices makes me think that bitcoin is more likely to gain legitimacy. 
we are being hypnotized.
I find it quite rude that they didn't send any notification in the UI about this. It's as if they're trying to sneak in a fee increase and hoping for as little resistance as possible. 

 I found [this post on their blog on March 30](https://blog.gdax.com/improving-our-fee-schedule-fdd66dc84a58), announcing that they are 'excited to introduce an improved fee schedule on GDAX that will go into effect on April 5'. 

This new structure is beneficial for traders with a 30-day volume over $10m (0.2% fee) and over $100m (0.1% fee). Mere mortals with <$10m volume end up with an increased fee of 0.3%. 
And price is barely reacting
Oh boy I wonder what will happen, everybody wins?
I opened up a long a couple of days ago based on this. Bears are straight up euphoric because right now seems like 17k for bulls on the way up, shorting feels like sure money right now and has been with the exception of April 2nd. 

I trade contrarian in general, but at some point the fun will stop, btc is not going to 0. I don't know when but i'm buying all the way down from 6.5 if we drop below it unless something drastic changes. I'm not even arguing we are going to shoot to 10k, but there are going to be solid bounces along the way. 
I reckon there's a decent chance that that's what's happening here. Someone's trying to trigger stop losses, before moving the price whichever way it's going to go. Which way will it go? I haven't the slightest clue. It's both entertaining and quite frankly terrifying.
seems like it was very clearly a stop hunt
People said that at $11,000
pretty sure it's just bear flagging before the dump resumes
ofcourse it will pump.

because the most important use case for btc right now is to squeeze the shorts. 

or atleast thats what iam told here. 
At 4k, I’m all-in 0.5x long
around -20% (around 5200$) from here ETH has a very solid 300$ support too, since BTC and ETH are highly correlated I think we could pause there for a bit too
Tulipmania is used often as a example of a bubble in the cryptosphere (mainly by skeptics) but it is complete and utter horseshit. I find it hilarious when people pull up the charts and start drawing analogies between tulips and bitcoin.

[Thompson published a paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11127-006-9074-4) about it in 2007, which was later summarized in [an article by the Economist](https://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/10/economic-history).

TLDR: 

> Thompson argued that popular interpretations of tulipmania have failed to distinguish between options and futures. Tulipmania was only a contractual artifact. There was no “mania” at all. 

>It is easy to claim that bubbles are irrational. They seem to represent a deviation of prices from fundamental values—and they contradict basic economic theory. But there has been little attempt to understand how speculation actually works. The example of tulipmania shows the importance of doing that—rather than relying on lazy quips about “animal spirits” or irrationality. 
This doesn't detract from the fact that Bitcoin was in a bubble up until 19k. The only question is where the mean price lies. Whether the Dutch sat on tulips and span has no bearing on bitcoins current price movements. 
Congrats! 
Remember, never be afraid to take profit, no matter how small.

Pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered.
you will regret it that you closed it.
Being a contrarian to the market is all well and good, except sometimes the market is right.

I've seen supposed trading gurus parrot this in different mediums for weeks now and it's borderline moronic "Everyone and their dog is bearish im bullish" - Price falls another 1000 dollars "I just think everyone is too bearish the market isn't going to just fall while everyone is short" - Price falls another 1000 dollars "I think market sentiment is too bearish we are going up"  etc etc.
Please give me a reason why BTC will exit the 4-month downtrend that doesn't involve two indicators that a lot of people are selling and shorting. I'd love to hear one. Also, in order to exit the downtrend, we'd have to pass and hold above $9500 currently. Climbing to $8K is not a reversal of the market, it's a reversal of the short-term trend.

Also, I'm not sure what there is to "buy" on the run to 20K. That happened.
How can you think we will just exit this downtrend because of a bit of bull div and open shorts... We aren't dropping very hard but you know what's even more absent? The price going up... We are at 6500, in february this price had has us bouncing up immediately. Now? Nothing lol
Good luck, maybe this time it will work. People are trying this for weeks now and get absolutely rekt.
I am looking at the stars
Dropping under $200 was also basically unthinkable after breaking $1k. Yet I bought coins below that. My fiat cannons are ready.
Where do you see bullish divergence lol
3k would be a 50% drop, 20k...3.5x run.  One seems more reasonable than the other.
What is your entry? Im hesitant to short from here, the past two times its dipped its gone straight back up a few hours later. 

What indicates that we just started a bear break?

Edit: theres my answer
You un-picked a side
Holding short. Trend is friend.
Nice timing.
Alarms/stops still set at 6800?
[removed]
Is it a hedge? 
Where's the fork? Where are my free coins?
all I see are bulls positive shorts are about to get rekt so idk 
True
I think that's a pretty safe long in the ultra-short timeframe.  Unfortunately for you, the price action over the past few days has been very tight with a sudden $200 +/-.


[deleted]
what just happened is a show of strength to me at least for now. 
Honestly I could see this just going sideways for another day at this rate. Not enough strength to push the price up and way too much resistance for it to drop meaningfully with current volume. 
At this point you may aswell, then re-open it if 7k falls. 
>from way back

4 hours ago?
People that see this as a good thing have no fucking clue as to how he operates.  I find it very hard to believe he'd do anything but short this shit to the ground.  Unsettling stuff.

Let's speculate what his options are.

1 Short it, create fud with the help of your billionair buddy's to let the market tank and then buy or cashout at the bottom.

2Pump it only to short it after.

3 Pump it and let the pump ride to create another bullrun.

I think it's 2 first a big ass pump and a lot of fomo to then short it to the ground.
whatever happens, we're all basically at his mercy after this. If the dude can crash entire countries' economies, we're fucked 

this is what he had to say about bitcoin before the bubble truly popped:

> Normally when you have a parabolic curve, eventually it has a very sharp break,” Soros said. “But in this case, as long as you have dictatorships on the rise you will have a different ending, because the rulers in those countries will turn to Bitcoin to build a nest egg abroad.

However, this was around like $13-16k I think, after the crash. He was definitely wrong that there wouldn't be a sharp break.

He also said:

>Cryptocurrency is a misnomer and it’s a typical bubble which is always based on some kind of misunderstanding. Bitcoin is not a currency, because a currency is supposed to be a stable store of value, and a currency that can fluctuate 25% in a day can’t be used, for instance, to pay wages, because the wages could drop by 25% in a day.



Keep in mind the Soros Fund Management is infamous:

>The fund, which started in 1969, is perhaps most famous for its massive bets against the British pound just before the Black Wednesday crisis in 1992 — when the UK dropped out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. The bets, which helped crash the currency, earned Soros the nickname "The Man Who Broke the Bank of England."
To dump this thing on its ass!
Way to early to call that... but I do think it is wise to be cautious here. Personally I'm watching the 7250 level carefully and just beyond that (depending when/if we get there) the resistance of the falling wedge we are in. The flat price action and consistent volume over the past week or so resembles accumulation. 
Could actually be the beginning of a rally. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/VWmuWbyC/
Are you sure or do you want to believe? 

it exactly mirrors the previous dump. And has had a lot of time to build pressure. 
Yep, party may be over for the bulls. At least until the RSI cools down a bit.
and after the chinese new year, wall street bonuses and LN network ?
Shouldn't most people have paid taxes by now? Is anybody really waiting 9 more days in a bear market to cash out to pay taxes? 

Also didn't a huge chunk of the market just buy and hold last year and therefore not have to pay any taxes in 2017?

This feels like a Tom Lee talking point to explain away a bubble burst.
when is it tax day ??
"..or not, fuck why are you asking us?"
My school of thought he is too cool to play by the book. Shorting the coin at this stage won't call for the best story 10 years later. However, what would become an epic story is to take this thing to new ATH and drop it from there.
I am thinking the same, whatever he decides it's gonna be influential on market
now that is interesting... three different industries that all stand to benefit from incorporating aspects of crypto, can't draw any conclusions yet personally but this is good stuff
> His recent big buys: Overstock, Caesars, Dave and Busters.

where can you see that?
I think if you're going long you may as well wait for the actual 4hr RSI to become oversold at this point. Personally, I don't see real buying pressure returning until the daily becomes oversold.
Stoch rsi is not an indicator of price action, it's an oscillator applied to the rsi. I would wait for rsi to be in oversold as another person said. Good luck!
Scalp longs quickly, hodl shorts a bit more and rub ur hands lmao
yep a capitualtion to 5k should be perfect. 
~~The [lack of significant] volume is suspicious. Could just be settlement shenanigans (OKEx in less than ~2 hrs: http://getjumbucks.com/settlement/)~~

Edit: OK, here's the volume. We're going fuckin' down.
I think the next support is at 6K from the Feb 5 low!
Can you explain how to read that that? It looks like only around 70 positions closed on 30k positions overall.
Good luck.
What you're opening a 7M Long? Lol
What price are you adding up to? Leverage? 
Is this your average / lower / higher position size? Good luck on the trade
May i ask for your reasons here? Also thinking about DCAing into a low leveraged long but still fearful. My simple motivation here is a potential short squeeze tbh. Thanks in advance. 
Which exchange do you use? Don't see any liquidity to sell into on Bitmex lol
and not on kraken this time
This doesn't sound like good news to me. Soros destroys every market he touches .
he probably already has been
That guy needs to go ahead and enter the veil. Low of the low, IMO.
Tons of billionaires are already doing it. He's late to the game. Non-news I'd say.
Talk about bagholding. 
First of all, any amount of profit is a good trade.  Second, you should think in terms of percentage, not value.  A huge win for you may be very different from a huge win for me, or anybody else.
I'm new and on a similar level to you, which I think is a sensible level to begin with. Ultimately I'd like to be able to slowly increase my stack with lower risk trades and organically increase my position sizes. That way I think I'll be less likely to think about how much I am laying down and more just about the percentages. 

I'm trading maybe once a day and aiming for at least a 5% profit with each trade. I've learnt pretty quickly that mimising loss is the most important discipline to have.
I *try* to enter a trade everyday, barring i haven't closed my previous 
 positions... However there are many days where I'm not confident enough in opening a position or don't have the time to chart watch to a degree that I'm comfortable with. I'm not very experienced so I aim for $200-$500 profit per trade but will often close lower as long as it's in the green if I'm too stressed out lol. Funnily enough if I'm in the red I tend to wait things out longer than I otherwise would be comfortable with, at least lately when it seems like anything can happen in the market. I've opened shorts this week that have been a (at times) 60-80% loss. Irresponsible I know, but I managed to close all of them at a healthy profit so far. It seems pretty hard *not* to close shorts in the green lately as long as you're not overleveraged. 
Remember to set targets based on where you think the price will go, not where it would be a nice profit. 
3 to maybe 4 a month, kudos to the people who long and short $50-100 swings, you have a higher risk appetite than I do.

Trading longer time frames is much less stressful imo
Not everyone is. But we ARE in a bear market that is trending down to a likely figure of at least 6k. There's more reason to go down than up at the moment and sentiment mirrors that.
I'm not sure how everyone is bullish here... we are failing to make a newer high of any kind. The idiotic market buyers have been propping the market brutally. whales have been shadow selling it.  I think we are pretty close to marking the bottom.
I don't see proof of this, much as I would like this to be a bottom. Whales shadow buying? We are also lower today than we were say, 2 days ago and lower than 2 days before that. 
You get funding depending on your positions size, regardless of leverage. The reason why opening positions 10 seconds before funding doesn't consistently work is because there are bots daytrading the swap vs futures funding (yes, futures do have implied funding, depending on whether it trades at a premium or discount). Check what happens on the 1 min candles after funding periods, especially if the funding is above roughly 0.1%.
Pretty sure the funding is on the amount of contracts and leverage has nothing to do with it. Don't often use perps though so might be wrong.
Yes
yeah, you can open/close the position to get the fees.
Sort of, but it's inside a falling wedge on the 1h/4h and both patterns break up, so I'll allow it lol
Same thing on GDAX. Bears and Bulls playing hide and seek with 20-30 coin stacks up and down the price range only to pull them once there's any movement. It's annoying.
[Bears vs bulls in the current market](https://steamusercontent-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/102851052191595601/19D400B3D741252688B3345907D73745649322AB/) 
What is this, volatility for ants?
Went in at 6600, feels like buyers are getting the upperhand
if you throw 1000btc buy/sell in there, it's gonna be fireworks
Reversal as in up or down? What's a TD9 anyway
Not a reversal signal necessarily. 6 hr chart definitely has a TD9 Buy Setup completed, but it's not a perfected setup so not ideal. You can use that as a buy indicator now, but another possibility is to do the TD13 Countdown before you actually do the buy. We're only on count 2 of that.
Never mind, I see your edits.
i see double-edged saw formation ready to chop
If you think that weak hands are shaken out after three bear months younare wrong

They have been doing this for weeks... It is nothing new.
Good call mate. What factors motivated you to start long at 6530?
do what I do and just block the people who consistently don't add any value, much easier that way.
When I finally started ignoring/blocking the bad actors it really made interacting in here a lot more productive. 
It's a bit ironic to say all that in a post that only adds noise.

this ari paul must know it. wtf. 
Personally I would put more money into cryptos but I think for most people they would take money out of cryptos before stocks (if the stock market were to crash). 

I think it depends on risk tolerance, age, emergency fund, diversification, etc. It's a tough question to answer. Maybe if Bitcoin was a bit more prevalent we'd expect an inverse relationship with stocks, but as of right now people see it as a novelty (I'm referring to the layman here). 
There’s a reason why your research is flawed.. I am neither 1,2 in the UP VOTE section or 1,2 in the DOWN VOTE section but still I voted..Reddit, I love it😂
I think you're going to get a little biased view in here lol, of course most will probably say yes.   I'm 99% sure it will happen eventually, will people want to hedge with gold bars to buy goods if the economy or fiat go down or something digital? It's still too early for most investors so it's probably not ready yet, although some of the more savy progressive investors might.  But I went to an accountant in a fairly big city and her firm has only handled one other Bitcoin account, we're still so early most have no idea about it so it probably won't happen immediately but we will get there, still too volatile for gram and gramps to feel comfortable, but fucking Chad the young investor might hedge. 
Do you think this is the biggest exchange of value from weak hands to smart money that the world has ever seen? I’ve heard it is...
Did you forget the "/s"? I thought you were always bearish.
I would feel extremely uncomfortable shorting here because I notice some genuine buying for once, too. If anything the buy orders will have to be thinned out to resume the dump, and the best way to do this is to go up, and get those people with buy orders to market buy with maximum fomo.

Too pussy to long tho :P
[deleted]
I'm impressed dude, didn't think I would hear this from you. Regardless of if it is true or not, I'm glad to see that you're taking a rational approach to this. NOW CLOSE THAT DAMN SHORT so that we can start the bull run :P
The fakeout pumps are what gives it away to me tbh. Every now and then someone bought just a little too much and causes a fakeout pump.

They then sell their coins to bring us back down and keep buying
I'm sure it's true, but what makes it *look* like accumulation to you?
[deleted]
I've said it before and I'll say it again. That spike on February 6th was something else, and I still think it was the bottom, at least barring some hugely jarring macro news.
They always say its smart money.
I agree , we are already down 70% and it's been 3 months of pain ,it has to end soon but of course perma bears with their shorting the bottom tactic will downvote me.
Bulls trapped in this bear market is starting to show Stockholms syndrom
Capitulation is still far away judging by this sub.
I think you're too optimistic lately. This wont go to 7.5 before closing the daily sub 6k
BTC does not have desires. It's moved by market sentiment. That's bearish, as you stated. It's not some free spirit that bears are pinning down. The further down it goes, the more people will flip their sentiment--but it's a moving target. Lots of people in fiat right now swore they'd mortgage the house if it went under $8K. Suddenly, $8K becomes the dream target to exit. 

But eventually, more people will want to buy than to sell. Is that at $6K? $4K? $2K? I said earlier today I'd start buying up what I could afford at $4K. What if we hit $4K on Sunday though...would I then? Probably not. 
well played lol
Great Job. Might start thinking of closing that short also :) 
But...whale or not....better than the any other time today, you can actually trade
they don't need style or subtlety when people seem to have a memory span of about 24 hours -_-

seriously, the amount of times people here have said "this is it! this is the one!" over the past few weeks...it's amazing. you'd think these people would be *completely* broken and insane right now

I mean, this really goes both ways, too. Not just for bulls, but I feel like bears are going to start sounding ridiculous too
Seems like solid analysis, and I agree. Someone does seem to have an awful lot of coins that they enjoy dumping in a weird, reckless way, though. 
God damnit.

This must be what those Ethtrader people were on about all Q3/Q4 last year...
I doubt there is that much long fomo remaining after so much beat down. More like short squeeze.
If your time horizon is further out than a fruit flys life expectancy, then it probably makes very little difference if you buy back in at 6k or 7k. When the bear market breaks, you don’t want to be on the sidelines. I don’t recall the exact statistics on how much of the gains in a bitcoin year you miss if you’re not in the market for the 5 biggest up days, but its most of it.
yea, it just makes you wonder where the other buying pressure will come in from. We need to bottom out for a *long* time at very *low* prices to create some real serious, lasting FOMO.

Personally I wouldn't mind buying/longing here, but anything past $7.5k? No, thank you. Don't want to be holding bags. 

I suspect most people feel the same way. They want to get the bottom but have no desire to buy at the local top on the way up again. So it makes you wonder who will carry this past $8k? Possibly no one, which is why every pump ends relatively quickly

The only way this is resolved is if we spend a very long time at low prices and *everything* feels like low prices. 

Bottom out at $3k? Sure I'll buy at $4k. What are the chances we go to $2k? buy at $5k? Why not. Seems a bit pricey, but I don't mind, this could have been the bottom. $6k? Alright I'd normally be worried but we have some serious momentum from $3k

$7.5k? Hell yea, we came all the way from $3k. I don't mind buying a bit here. etc etc all the way up
Idk, I think anyone who's _seriously_ watching the market now knows not to trust these little pumps. But to say that would likely be understestimating the stupidity of investors in this space.
Someone that is bearish and posts about not buying has no intention on saving any else money. Let's be honest their only goal is to make money. They only reason they are posting is because they are looking for reassurance. If you're bearish for the foreseeable future and you know its going to be a while until we hit the bottom and you buy/sell or trade why visit reddit sub everyday to post about how much further the price has fallen or to guess how low it will go? It all human nature in my opinion, but when it comes to money it shows how manipulative people really are. 
Not sure why your being downvoted, bears getting Rekt?
Enron? Longers got rekt there! :-)
Hasn’t the last 4 months been the “return to normal phase”? Wouldn’t normal be well under $6k?
did you mean to post this is r/bitcoin? Look around you 
People havent screamed moon in forever. 
I've been watching that line for a possible bounce that might get us up and out of the big falling wedge, but not feeling so confident about that actually playing out right about now.
that line means nothing. When people say TA is BS, this is the shit they're talking about. 
I like the look of a potential tipple bottom on Monero: https://www.tradingview.com/x/hdoIDvsV/

Just need some confirmation, which is a tall order at this point...
They're still tight as fuck.
I agree with you. I think this will be a short term movement. I think we won't even notice when this will change back into a bull. We'll just go sideways through every resistance line and then one day we'll just start moving up assuming it will come back down and it won't.

I definitely feel more comfortable now, though, buying in the 6k range for the long term. If we do continue to move down I don't think we'll move down by much. Maybe 5k minimum.
that was a 1k market buy. Someone bought ~1000 coins in one buy, basically. That wasn't 50 people buying 20 btc, it was 1 person buying 1000. 

It's not true that all of them are, but that one was 
Not true.  Sometimes they are kicked off by a big order, but sometimes you just sort of run out of buyers or sellers at a given price and so even smallish orders create some price action.  Most of the time the accelerated action is from a combination of stop orders, margin calls, bots, FOMO traders, etc.  There are a lot of market dynamics that create these situations where everyone seems to want to buy at once or everyone wants to sell at once.  You see this in many markets and it's oversimplification to call it all whale orders.
Does the market look organic to you?
Yes, (((someone))) told me
nailed it
Here it comes...

Edit: Nevermind. Bounced pretty well
you spelt pump wrong
How can you tell it's genuine vs fake buying?
You sure told us.
More money to be made up than down because bears wil now stay in denial forever
Lame volume. Probably means your safe shorting.
this time is different ^tm is a trademark i trust.
> What makes anyone think this time is different? 

Desperation.
Unfortunately no one is buying so this pump is built on sand. 
Every good thing comes to an end. 
It will fall before the weekend is over.
The more times 6500 is defended the more margin trading helps defend it via more people seeing it as an opp for new longs and closing shorts (it's also cutting off rebounds at the knees)
With billions in daily trading volume, I doubt a puny $7 mln wall is going to halt the train. Ask the bullwhale who defended $8k with millions of dollars how well that went for him!
You're going about it the wrong way my friend.
You shouldn't decide, "today is the day I'm going to margin trade!".  Instead, you should be planning and watching for a pattern or anticipating a market catalyst to push price up or down and utilizing margin to take maximum advantage of the opportunity.  The way you're going about it is how you gamble and over-trade away your money.  

edit: read this short article for some additional perspective.  I believe it will be very beneficial to you. 
https://www.forexschoolonline.com/trade-forex-like-a-sniper-and-start-trading-from-kill-zones/

Dead center of the no-trade zone. At least you've got the right idea on stop placement.

Good luck.
Guy feeling ey? Sure it isn't an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of underdone potato?
You might get stopped out before the real move occurs. Would lower the stop to around 6380 USD. 
Split that entry up into a few limits between the current price and your target price then. 

But I personally wouldn't open a position here. 
An entry closer to 6500 would be safer. Don't be greedy and start taking profits along the way, closing part @6600, another part @6700 and so on. The range is pretty thin and it looks like its staying that way
gut feeling, hopefully, not sure. Scared money protects money.
Price wants to go down but there's still huge resistance. Hitting the resistance causes a bounce up, but no buy volume makes it come back down. Rinse and repeat.
someone really wants BTC price at 6600$ lol
Reversal™
If you think about the US volume and how it compares to other countries push and pull on crypto i dont think itll be catastrophic or anything
the smart us tax payer makes estimated quarterly payments. i make monthly estimated payments.
It's not like it's one grand holiday. It's lame but people don't make a big deal out of it, it's just a regular occurrence that people obviously don't look forward to. I feel a decent number of people will try to avoid reporting anything related to crypto, the big players that started out really small, or at least skirt around it. I don't feel it will affect the market much at all but who knows, this kind of thing is hard to make a prediction on.
Cos at the moment we need around 9,000 coins to be sold to do that. Thats a shitload. (Finex)
Its being manipulated to keep smart money out

Nope you’re good my fried 
"BTC is forking into a stablecoin"
I’m watching the China/US matter pretty closely. One thing I’m looking for has to do with actions by China that would allow or encourage the Yuan to devalue. I think this would cause a sudden and somewhat unforeseen increase in demand for capital flight vehicles like bitcoin. 
Them bear-hyenas got the bulls by the balls

Well, we're back. D:
it moved in the last minute of the 1h candle. somebody starts to paint here. 
Yes but *huge* resistance going down any further. Be very, very careful.
Can’t win if you don’t play either.  Can always play for fun on gdax with no fee limit orders and small stakes.  Makes you feel like you are doing something.  It’s all I’m doing these days.
That's not how the saying goes. Canada Bill Jones said: "I know it's crooked, but it's the only game in town!"

You're supposed to play BECAUSE it's crooked, not DESPITE it being crooked.

It's like when the pro gambler in the Western plays Faro. Everyone knows the deck is stacked, but then the challenge just becomes figuring out the dealer's system.


also the 3d will close.
Only 33000  to go and then we can continue going down
More like a litemare
its great. can add more
It's an abominathion!

That little rascal left a pot hole in the road.
You could say the writing is on the wall.

Could be a spoof wall, unless it holds while being chewed on, just ignore it.
One hit and the wall vanished. 
pussy-ass wall.
Which also means places like Bitmex probably will get even more traffic since people do not want regulation and taxes and so on
Not sure this is news. Their CEO mentioned the brokerage stuff on Fast Money yesterday.
narrator: this was not big news
Ooh, I get it. Because drunk Americans have lots of money to spend on crypto. HA HA HA HA 
that’s a good one :D
why
You can only really confirm divergence like this  when you break up above the previous high. Then a continuation up is likely. Until that happens it it meaningless.
A bear flag that breaks up is still a bear flag.

A falling wedge that breaks down is still a falling wedge.

Some formations carry an inherent bearish or bullish bias, but that doesn't mean it's a given they'll break out in the expected direction.
There's gonna have to be a pretty serious short squeeze at this rate. Keeps piling on but the price won't budge.
Nice repost
Nope it's 6750 already! 
There are enough real-life moonbois that sarcastic posts like this are really unnecessary. Just sayin'.
23k +/-100% by 23:00UTC+/-60minutes

>the absolute fucking hysteria im seeing due to a 200 dollar pump makes me think every randomer is waiting for any sign to be bullish and fomo in

...

> Anyone else think we’re likely headed to new highs with this nice pump? 

New highs? Fucking hell.

To be fair the bears were traumatized by then 
FYI, if you do the math that's only a ~$15MM USD difference in notional.

17000×12000 = 204000000

6600×33200 = 219120000

considering 17k is almost 3x that of 6.6k I'd say it's not a big difference 
It's actually funny that the more shorts open the higher the chance for price to rise and vice versa. It's actually been a real good, buy and sell signal 
How do you figure?
Buy all the btc and check in a year.

Chasing stops all the way up to 7.2-7.5 and breaking the 11.7 -> 9k resistance is the best case scenario.

The move down will be explosive only if 6.4k breaks and that's far from guaranteed. To me 6.5 is already a failed attempt at a lower low.
My question if you're a bull, what is your reasoning for a reversal based on fundementals and not from a TA perspective?
No clear reversal patterns for the bulls yet. Perhaps breaking up from the 30m triangle starts a longer term upwards move, or not. Regardless of what happens short term, as long as we stay above ~$6k (the low of the February dump), we can form a higher low on the 3d chart, which could be the first step to a reversal. I think that's kind of the only hope for the bulls right now.
> and make it to, what, $7K at absolute best before being smacked down again

Yeah, 6800-7k is best case scenario from what I see. After that, probably back to 6600 once more before the market decides if it's really done dropping or not.
I am just waiting to move above 6800 so I can lock in some profit, I have been busy the last two days and sitting in quite a bad position I did not have the time to manage... then we will see. Maybe big low leverage positions and try to practice the swings 
I honestly cant see people coming to bitcoin as a safehaven. Yeah the stock markets fucked but bitcoin still seems more risky.
yeah I don't see this happening. "Oh shit my stocks are dropping, let me put it into an even more volatile, unproven asset class that's down over 65% in 4 months with no signs of letting up that both the gov't and media hate."

Unless the stock market is going to crash, the time to sell, ironically like crypto, was in Feb. I personally feel like both crypto and stock market have one last pump in it before the big drop.
This is the opposite of Technical Analysis.
yep
How the hell could you seriously doubt we drop below that point? Just look at the charts. At this rate you'll be lucky if we don't drop under 6300 by eod. Those buy walls are clearly fake and have been getting assblasted through since last week.
Plot twist - these are targeted ads
That's just a general Reddit ad, rather than one for /r/ethtrader.  
Nothing?

Waiting on the sideline here. Buy order book thick as hell, but trend is down, risky.
bulls had their bounce to 7500 and it is now very clearly broken. we already have the precedent of 6400 low, I see no reason why we would not test it again. if not today, then over the weekend surely. no real signs of the overall trend changing.

reloading my short @6750-6900 if given the opportunity.
where can cou lookup such things? thanks!
Don't cover.
Mostly in fiat, holding some alts (wasn't the best decision financially).
Holding, though i'm down about 11% atm.

25% fiat left for that sub 6k bleed if we even get there
everyday I´m hoddeling hoddeling hoddeling

too dumb to trade, 
too invested to buy more, 
too long term to sell. 
Next havling is only 785 days away
inflation at next halving goes from 3.95 to 1.8 % 

to each his own
hodling; if it Really goes down and Drops under my buy in i start lowering that, if i ever get that Chance. 
have buy orders staggered down from 6000 all the way to 5000 in the june futs.


way too many shorts open here, there will be a bounce for sure in that range.

if it gets back to 7k, will short. 
Short at the moment. Have my cover orders ladderd down to 6 and buy orders below that
>So who is in fiat, who’s short, who’s long, who’s holding BTC

>I’m holding, every last UTXO I can call my own is in the ice box. got a couple k on Dax for some knife juggling

Heavy long. 
I've been in fiat since mid-March.  Currently have no confidence in my ability to read the market (especially since I don't short), and I can't think of a compelling reason to buy and hold.
Mainly in fiat, but scaling into BTC, ETH, EOS positions.
50% fiat, 25% BTC, 25% alts, let's see where this roller coaster goes to next! 
I have a few limit orders set up to catch knives, too. Nothing huge.

The past few months of BTC dips have screwed up my balancing, but it actually looks more smart and conservative now. I miss my internet money, though.


December | Now | description
---|---|----
20% | 50% | traditional investments
79% | 40% | btc + gbtc
1% | 10% | cash

Buying in on the way down. Bought some litecoin and BNB this morning. Litecoin because it is following my policy of buying whatever is in the CMC top 10 that's fallen the most recently (as a bounce is usally equal or greater to it). Except Eth, screw that.

And BNB because it's part of the engine room of the whole market.

Neo when it's cheap enough too, but not yet as well as Cardano because they don't seem to be the type to joke about with hype and care about releasing something substantial.

Why buy at all? Because it's a risk regardless. I don't think in the short term it's going to go down a huge silly amount without some form of bounce and you can never time the bottom. I also stopped cashing out my mined zcash and am holding that due to Overwinter.

1 downvote = 1 drop in BTC
95% holding, 2.5% unallocated trading stack, 1.25% long on the way of being built, 1.25% short on the way of taking profits.
The 30m are less than $50 apart.

The 6h candle has a range \< $100
Haha yeah look at that straight line.  Has to be one of the longer sideways I’ve seen in a while.  Someone needs to go dump or buy up some bitcoin.
its kinda random.  Sometimes it can take 12 hours.
Couple more hours per their maintenance window.  I closed out my position before maintenance, which would have been good with the pump, but was afraid of getting locked out.

Vitalik proposed to get ready in case it get messy, not a priority it should be done in parallel of the current agenda. One of his point was we don't kbow if the asic is programmable. It sounds like, let's see what they really have and be ready to act in case there's a danger of 51% attack.. 
Canada stopped credit card transactions or something along those lines.
>  It appears that the Bitcoin craze has just arrived in Canada because there was no large increase in December there like most other places.

Methinks there is another explanation for this anomaly.... That doesn't make sense to you, does it......?
Is this satire?
A lot of traders would disagree. This is a perfect platform for experienced crypto traders. All you have to do is have a 12+ hours outlook on any trade and get in / out at the right levels. 
you domt know that

this is crap.

Jesús. $480,000. That's about three times what my house is worth. 
He had a $20m long up in the 6800s yesterday he posted in the troll box. So....
if so, good
pls no jinx
We're being lulled with boredom. It'll dump once more after our eyes have glazed over. 
Nope.
Going on 5 years now.
I held an underwater short for 3 damn days and paid fees while down 700% until I finally closed in profit. 

Unless you shorted the bottom with high leverage I'd say there's no reason to close a moderately underwater short given current price actions. 
We go back to 6600 lol.
who knows, this looks like a bart. 1k btc bought in 10 seconds...someone's just trying to get this to move, we'll see if the market wants to follow
Sea of tranquility?

Nobody fucking knows man.
This is a good time to sit back and watch what happens. RSI is overbought up to the 1H. It could go higher, but it's unlikely at this point. More likely we go sideways for a bit until the RSI cools down then possibly up further. 

More likely, we see a steady move downward overnight with a possible sharp dump in the morning(Just my feeling). I've set up limit sells every $100 or so up to 7500 should we make it that far. If we do dump, I think it will be significant (sub-6000), so I have buys set up accordingly in that range. 
Shorting here is like longing 18k$, but I guess those traders know best :)
I dont think its gonna people buying right now, its going to be panicking underwater shorts closing.
I feel that the idea of 6500 holding is fueling longs from around 6500. That shields the actual walls supporting it. The more this happens the harder will be to break 6500. 
HA. 

This Guy. 
I'm not sure how users type this kind of misplaced confidence without laughing.

Not a fucking chance. 3K is the absolute lowest it will ever go. 
Just give it a rest

remember when we stabilized at 200?

Napkin math time:

Even without counting Asian exchanges with their premiums, Bitcoin was trading for over $10,000 a piece for over 3 months. If we look at post-bubble peak only, there was over a month and a half of prices over $10,000 with average daily volumes around 5-10 billion USD. Even if we assume that *all* altcoin (ETH, LTC included) trades are purely wash, and 90% of BTC trading volume is also wash traded, we're still looking at *at least* ~50 billion worth of 'legit' BTC trades taking place since the bubble pop, not even counting OTC trades, Localbitcoins, Bitmex / Bitflyer margin stuff, and so on. 

I ain't saying this is the bottom (or that it isn't), but claiming with such certainty that we gotta go to $1k because whales have to cash out is... questionable. There's been plenty of time to do so already, at much better prices than this. 
[removed]
I disagree.  BTC is still slowly bleeding in price over the long run and will continue.  Money can be made trading the swings, but the trend is down and will continue.
Aren't you worried at all worried that we just keep dropping? 
About 20 minutes after I wrote this the price just shot up 70 dollars, but was quickly rejected. The increase in price was from someone who longed 200 btc and the rejection was a short of 70 btc. The big question now is if there will be more follow through on the long side or if people want to keep stacking up the shorts when they are already at 31k and at a pretty high funding.
All I see when I look at the charts is coins getting pumped. 
[deleted]
It looks slightly more irregular than that. Curious to see, though.
Zoom out, we were at 6530 just 2 hours ago and now 6545. Slow and steady rises are sustainable and healthy. 

This is good for Bitcoin. 
Set alarms to 6600 and 6800. Flip coin and enter position accordingly. 
Good timing
I have withdrawn coins. Will trade again when shit gets interesting 
looks like flaggy the bear with an overzealous pop that got shut down
Yes, as of a day or two ago, there is a new fee structure:

https://blog.gdax.com/improving-our-fee-schedule-fdd66dc84a58

TL;DR:

    | 30-day USD Volume | Maker Fee | Taker Fee |
    |-------------------|-----------|-----------|
    | $0 - $10M         | 0%        | 0.30%     |
    | $10M - $100M      | 0%        | 0.20%     |
    | $100M+            | 0%        | 0.10%     |

It's a little worse for Joe Crypto and a *lot* better for the more active / higher volume participants. I'm glad they finally changed it, because it was a racket...the gamification of the fee structure was annoying as hell, ie. if the market volume went up, you had to trade more to keep your discount. Plus it's a little silly for someone who trades dozens or hundreds of millions worth a month to be paying 0.2X%, that translates to hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in fees for more or less the same service (and burden to Coinbase) as Joe Crypto who trades $100 a month.
[deleted]
They did update their fee brackets on the fee page to indicate trades in USD volume instead of as a percentage of the trades taking place. But I am not at all sure when that change happened.

Edit: Now that you mention it, wasn't it 0.0025 for BTC earlier? 
A hidden bear div would require he price to make higher highs, while the RSI makes lower highs. Seeing as we haven't made any higher highs recently, there can't be a hidden bear div.
I mean, a $100 pump is hardly that significant.

To be honest with you, it's actually leaving me feeling a fair bit more bearish than I was.
> sounds pretentious and logic free.

Its TA and the opposite of what you are telling.

If bulls can't defend a support line, it means that more people are willing to sell at this price then people willing to buy.

We reffer to support and resistance because its a price that have been tested to either hold  or reject the price.

I'm a noob but thats the comprehension of the concept
By your logic there should be have people buying loads below every single even big number, 10000, 9000, 8000, 7000. That's not how it works. 

Do some reading on support and TA and you'll see why certain supports are more important than others. Right now breaking under 6k is something we simply don't want to do.

If we do it will likely fall with some serious pace. 
> So in what universe does it make sense that if 6K is broken the price is going even lower?

So in your view of the market, the price would just...never go lower?
Things we don't understand often annoy us. Read up on what support means and you'll know why people feel more comfortable buying above support rather than below it.
For exactly the reason that you said. People only buy now because they feel others are buying with them and there is "support," so the returns should be higher. However, if support fails then your risk/reward drops and it would be best to wait until support shows up. Why would you buy when it could drop lower? As you yourself said, the lower it drops the more I can buy.

There's actually a lot of logic to it.
relax. ...
12K+ end year.. so why bother
You can also view support & resistance as liquidity pools and it's prime places for whales to either dump a lot of coins or buy a lot of coins, that's why the price often get attracted to those levels. 
You would only want to buy lower if you think that it is going much higher, and in the case of BTC it is not.  Of course, there could be some announcement that some retailer is going to start accepting bitcoin and there would be a massive FOMO rally, but long term BTC will end up just like any other currency which is assigned a value based on its rarity.
Quite a spectacle. Impending bounce. Long with tight stop. 
God damnit, the article doesn't even mention bitfinex.

## Colombian cartels washed hundreds of millions through the companies from Pruszków and the surrounding area

A billion PLN 270 million taken over in March by the CBŚP prosecutor's office is most likely money belonging to Colombian drug cartels - according to informer tvp.info. It is known that the money was in the accounts of two companies from the vicinity of Pruszków, owned by a Canadian-born Panamanian descent and a Colombian with the citizenship of Panama. One of these companies was a shareholder of an online cryptocurrency exchange office. Millions of such operations were to flow through a small cooperative bank in Lodz.

The tvp.info portal reached the details of the investigation, which enabled record-breaking security of the mafia property. Everything began with the construction of the Belgian embassy in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs elected the contractor and had to transfer money to the company's account. Then the scammers appeared in the game, who impersonated the company and sent the Belgians the account number of the company they controlled. Oblivious to fraud, employees of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have shed over 400,000 criminals. euro.

When the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs realized that he had been the victim of a scam, local services and Interpol took care of it. It was shown that the account used by the fraudsters belongs to the company M. registered in the vicinity of Pruszków. According to tvp.info, its president is a Canadian Panamanian descent.

While checking the connections of this company, investigators came across another company - C. At its head stood a man with citizenship of Colombia and Panama. This company was associated with a large online cantor exchange of cryptocurrencies. Both companies had over PLN 270 million deposited on their accounts.

### A river of money from drug dealing

From the findings of the tvp.info portal it appears that both foreigners, who managed the company-pillars for "dirty money", avoided detention. The portal's insiders say they have links to Colombian drug cartels.

> We will now carefully examine the financial flows between these entities. We already know that they created a much larger chain of related companies. The scale of financial operations indicates that these bills were to hide money from smuggling cocaine to Europe. The companies were also used for large scale scams. Criminals have hidden their operations, also exchanging money for cryptocurrencies, obliterating traces - says the TVp.info interlocutor.

Investigators also reached other companies cooperating with the companies M. and C. As a result, at the beginning of March, the prosecutor's office secured the equivalent of over 9.5 million zlotys in euros and pounds and an additional 20 million dollars as evidence.

###Record protection

On Friday, the National Public Prosecutor's Office announced a record-breaking security for the money probably coming from the crime. Investigators from the Lower Silesian Branch Office of the Department for Organized Crime and Corruption of the National Public Prosecutor's Office and the Central Police Investigative Office have discovered two companies that have accumulated PLN 270 billion on their accounts, including in US dollars and British pounds.

> Money probably comes from international drug trafficking, as well as giant deception. They were deposited at a branch of one of the banks, on the accounts of two companies registered in Poland - the National Public Prosecutor's Office informed.

Investigators determined that both companies did not actually carry out any economic activity. They were created solely to share your bank accounts with international criminal financial operations. - The taking of money from these accounts was possible thanks to the amendment of the March 22, 2017 amendment to the Act on Counteracting Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing - explained Deputy Prosecutor General Beata Marczak.

Stock market still has a huge drop to come. BTC has (mostly) already had its drop.
I’m trying to figure out the same thing. I think crypto is a leading indicator for investor sentiment. I think the decline after December’s blow off top was exhaustion of animal spirits. This reflected in the stock market weeks later. 

Maybe a recovery in crypto will precede a recovery in the stock market?
A Guy Like Jeff Bezos will never buy into Bitcoin, at maximum he creates his own ICO and sell it to you cheap ;P
Extended bear markets don't end in V-bottoms. No reason to think this one will, either. 
bc it could take weeks, months to recover that 3%
The ESF and PPT will continue to prop it up while allowing small moves like this.  Still up over 20% from an already lofty valuation in Jan 2017.
maybe. but not before liquidating the greediest 100x, 50 x shorts
for me that number is 1000$, but that's because I'm already invested enough. I think most people will say around 4000$ since that would be about the same drop (-80%) comparing it to the last bubble.
About tree fiddy.
I am currently sitting in fiat most of the day and trying to scrape a couple hundred through price fluctuations. Once I hit that, I remain in fiat until the next day. Once the bear market looks like it's completely bust, I'm going to take all those dollars and hodl, whatever that price may be.
3k as well but I don't think it'll ever get that low. Demand would be too high for that price. The thing is though, you won't buy a lot when that price comes because this slow bleed will make it feel like it can keep dropping (just as it feels right now (hint hint)). I already feel like I may start DCA'ing with my remaining fiat over the next 3 months as I think we are starting to bottom out. Going sideways for a long time is usually a sign that the bottom is in.
I can,t see it dropping below $6k. I have around 90k lying in waiting so below $6k im buying the crap out of it.
The second it pop 200+ in 30 second I'm all in. Probably somewhere around the 1 h parabolic SAR turning over.
Already bought this month near 6k.  Will buy again next month at whatever price it's at.

DCA.
I sat out from February until last week. Started buying teeny amounts every day. I'm not going to try and find the absolute bottom, but I've been pretty good at finding the local lows and buying those. I'm happy to DCA anywhere in the range of $5500-$6500.  
I'm a bag holder, so MUST buy for low to average the top buy...but waiting for it to fall below the last low of 5800 and see how far it goes before I buy again
It's not so much a price that I'm waiting for, but the complete loss of hope from going sideways for months. When nobody can make money in the market, both bulls and bears, that is when the bottom is in.
I'm 50% Fiat (entered 50% at 6.7k). I'm waiting for 5.8k to enter with another 25%, will reevaluaate then for the remaining 25%.

The magic number where I would add a large amount of fiat would be around 3.5k, if the drop doesn't scare me away. The price doesn't matter as much as how we actually get there.
$9,99 sounds pretty appealing to me.
$2550
I might throw a few grand for shits and giggles at $5 a piece. Not sure why, it just sorta feels appealing. 
When my available fiat can get me 2.7 BTC :)
I have buys scaled from $5000 down to $500. I don’t expect anything under $2800 to execute. Unsure if that helps
This.  Is.  A.  Trading.  Sub.

"bullish" 
for the uninformed among us, can you elucidate where this is going? 
No one "knows" where this is going. At this point it's all conjecture. 
Beware of assuming anything especially in this market
No way. Really?

I did just add to my long position. It's still smaller than my short though, which will be closed in profit soon no matter which direction we go. 
because I'm sure that you're a big enough player that you'll impact the price if/when they try.

This isn't a competition, calm down.
You've come to take my Bitcoin again.. 
Why not just stay out of position?
Try it. You can get liquidated on both short and long 
If you go long and short at the same time, you scale into shorts climbing a peak, and scale into longs into a drop.  Then any time in between those two position's CAs in the middle of that spread you are green on both.  If you go past the CA of either position then you have your insurance policy of one covering the other.  You can scale in and out of these two positions as needed with good risk management and profit taking.

But you **do not** *open* a long and short at the *same* exact time.  Doing that is no mathematically different, and no timingly different, than just setting a moment to go one way or the other.
Short resistance, long support. Btc is in a scalper’s heaven lately. Tight stops

Could we keep it on trading topic please.

And just fyi ppl holding since 2013/14/15 are rich without trying to time the market. For all we know this could reverse right here, just like that.

Why would someone who made 10x, 100x on eth or BTC be terrified at the idea of the price being divided by 3.
> Your press has turned negative, theres no more moon 

I'm not denying the (tiny) chance that this *was* the absolute peak of Bitcoin, but after what we saw last year, I consider this just a normal part of the cycle - we raved hard and now have to handle the hangover
hello despair!
blah blah blah
This is more fun.
So if you feel this way, why don't you take out a short?
It’s generally not looking too rosy for the corn
>  Stoch RSI has more room to rise 

You guys are really using RSI/indicators wrong when you say stuff like this.

Indicators and charts in general are not telling you what's going to happen or what's possible, they tell you what has already happened.

Markets are not nearly as predictable as some relatively simple mathematical formula modeling how quickly we're going up or down
Breaking through 6800 convincingly will be the big test. Then we should be looking at 7500 in a day or two.
Night mode ain't dark enough, it's light version of dark. :)

Also, I like the sidebars and heatmaps. Add derivative exchanges.

This might come as a shock to you, so I hope you're sitting down for this....

It *might* be possible that the price swings are due to general market psychology and cycles of greed and fear...and furthermore, that the bots are deployed not by the exchanges themselves in some sort of conspiracy scheme, but by self-interested traders with a profit motive. The bots could be turned off during periods of high volatility so they don't get rekt, and turned back on when the market is calmer and price action more predictable.

Crazy, I know, but worth considering.

Why is this bearish? If anything, it means most of this sell pressure is already over. People aren't gonna risk missing the tax deadline due to withdrawal delays by keeping coins in cold storage until last minute. 
What is consensus other than the term means? Is it a conference that you're talking about?
The 90%+ drops were back in 2010 and 2011, back when Bitcoin was a penny stock essentially, and just one or two wales could tank an illiquid market. I think the chances of that happening this time are very small. 

I feel like the market has come quite a long way since the MTGOX 85% crash - so I don't expect it to fall that low either. 80% seems like a reasonable worst case to me. 
no.
It's not impossible, but that isn't as realistic imo, as the market has matured considerably since then. I wouldn't rule it out though.
I didn't say "worst case", I said "realistic worst case". There's a subtle difference. In either case though, your 'LOL' response shows inexperience imo.
Down to 1-2k with confidence means a lot of profit from a short.
... You are shorting, right? 
Bogdanov is putting us all to sleep. Careful.
Risk/reward on a long under 6600 is pretty good with this wedge forming and the solid 6500 support. If you can snag <6600 with stops at 6475, you've got a solid entry. 
Part of me feels like I should just take the close here under 6600. If it's a falling wedge and it breaks like they have been, a 30 second green candle could push me to break even. Better to lock in some profits, perhaps. 
I've gotten tired of watching double-digit ROE positions reverse and close at breakeven. I realize now that I'm locking in profits, this will be the time 6400 falls, but I closed 66% of the position (6580 and 6560) and the remaining sell is down at 6615. Actually flips long with a stop at 6450ish. Still, feels good to have some locked in.
And the small traders are the speculators. Assuming who will win this war
If that is true that would explain the elder scrolls flower collecting & cooking quests. A game for the most concussed of minds where a bit of root can be the most interesting thing in a couple hours.
That would be a great strategy, especially if you're one of the guys who lent a large amount of the coins that have been so stupidly dumped. You'd know they have to cover and when.
My thought exactly.
I honestly believe it’s a coin flip and whichever way it goes it won’t move far. But I’m not a TA expert and a huge believer in it to begin with. 
True, but the no followups to sell part is something new. Every single nudge in the down direction has been followed dilligently by the market for the past 3 months. I should know, I've been profiting from those shorts like the degenerate I am for a couple of weeks now.

Now, when someone makes a small dump, noone follows along.
Give your information, i also believe there is no point in paying fees and open new shorts or keep shorts from under 7k open atm. Shorts are at ATH and it will take one bear whale to take some profits any moment from now to start triggering some huge green candles.  
"Didnt matter shorts were at ATH" they told me.
The growth and crash from 6k to 20k and back down was caused by the normies and never meant to be. If we just cut out this period and stablizes somewhere around here we can argue that crypto is still in organic growth.
I agree that it will be tough to restore the faith of those who feel they were burned. In terms of Ponzi, I think with the advent of more funds, potential ETF's, patents, regulations, etc, it will become clearer and clearer to detractors that bitcoin is not a ponzi, and they will stop calling it one because they will sound dumb.
Hey. What do you think the low will be for BTC?
couldn't agree more. what do you think about my comment though?

(most who expect lower prices intend to buy, which I think it bullish long term)
I think you're right. I do wonder though if the concept of hold & hedge short is lost on a lot of the newer money who sees the shorts making profits, and wants to tag along (but doesn't own the underlying asset)
Hmmm, sorry but since the mainstream rise, this sub definitely sounds like that. not all, but a lot...
I understand that it's anecdotal, and I wouldn't ever use just one indicator. It's one of many inputs, but it skews bullish to me for sure.
are you saying you think we'll drop much lower and then not recover to our current level?
I agree, this is part of why I think the months of sideways action that most are predicting may not happen. we shall see
At least bigger swings are tradeable... 
Exactly, I really don't believe in news hype, but it does affect it short-term.   I think it's a useful tool to see how sensitive the market is, during the bull run even a China ban had a big drop but it kept resuming pretty quick.   If a China ban happened during our massive fall that would have really hurt.   So interesting to see how news affects the price in the short-term, tells you something about how the markets feel. 
You got it!!
This. I have them spread out every hundred from 3 to 2. If it goes lower ohthefuckwell
Probably only because bots are trading all the coins
Lowest market cap in a whillllle
That's what it looks like to me too.   My short CA is now in the center of the previous range at 6770, after adding to it down here. Going to reduce the position by 50% in a profit zone if we go above 6700 or below 6500.  And nearly clear it out just above break even, because surely at that point I'll be able to build a new better CA (or stay on sidelines) if it comes to that.

keep shorting...
that's the one

in this case, they are proposing a rules change that would allow the consideration of individual ETF's as opposed to having to consider the concept of crypto ETF's as a whole.

So, there should be some resolution one way or another before anyone pulls out.

"According to SEC documents dated March 23, the agency has instituted formal proceedings to determine whether to approve a rule change that would allow NYSE Arca to list two exchange-traded funds (ETFs) proposed by fund provider ProShares."

“The Commission is instituting proceedings pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)(B) of the Act to determine whether the proposed rule change should be approved or disapproved. Institution of such proceedings is appropriate at this time in view of the legal and policy issues raised by the proposed rule change,” the order says.
oh sweetie
everything pointing to 6k breaking this weekend...so it will probably pump to 8k
I hope so. I got fiat ready.
I would like to pick them up as close to 5k as possible. 

in my mind there's a 50/50 chance of sub 5k and a 10% of sub 2k.

Overall I expect this year to be mostly dull consolidation.


Ya I personally don't think it makes much sense but until we start going higher it makes sense to ride the trend even though I wouldn't do it. 
That proves my point even more, if you go from yesterdays daily close that's a divergence and if it goes lower today that's even more of a divergence, not sure I follow?
5 minute, lol.  If you watch, there is somebody accumulating a LOT of contracts on Mex.  It's likely that he's suppressing the price until he's built his position.
It's only been just over a year since the last bear market though ;). The last 3~4 years has been mostly bear. 
If you did literally that, you'd lose money.

Let's assume your current maker fee is 0.14% and you don't use margin. In this case you need a price difference of $18-19 to break even.

($6600 * 0.0014 * 2 = $18.48, that's what the fees for the two trades will be for one full bitcoin. If you give it a little thought, you'll find that the amount traded makes no difference in the "break even gap".)
This is the bottom? Why?
And they are faking everyone out on to breakouts thats does not happen until they move the price to the opposite direction, hunt the SL and than go back to where it should go.
I used to say this too, but I realized that bitmex will shit the bed and he won't be able to open a position when it blows up. 

Closing is prioritized so this is really the way to go. He just closes the opposite of the position he wants open. 

Worth the fees unless it sits here for a very long time. 
Stops can be triggered with wicks, this way he has more control. But even so, everytime i tried this approach i ended losing money for panicking with pumps/dumps and trying to manage both positions on my phone... 
That too...
> So optimistic. I suspect many underwater longs will use every little bounce to cut their losses.

Na, I'm totally neutral and think it'll go down. Just I've been watching the charts for months now and you don't usually get three days of downtrend without some bounce. Meaning this could well settle down, consolidate then the bottom could fall out from under it Saturday evening through to Sunday.
I feel like I mostly made the correct decisions and the overall strategy to rely on the bear trend is correct. Have to work on my timing tho, missing the first 6500 dip to take profits was an obvious mistake, conditions were so clearly oversold. Selling some @7300 was debatable, as I still had ammo left anyway. Selling before the news yesterday was probably overdoing it, the uptrend was clearly broken and was false to presume it would recover quickly.

Ive actually completely given up on using any stop losses and so far that has been a very good decision for me. Stack management - to have more bullets when going seems risky - and taking profits at the correct time is a way better method. With this chop up and down, stops just mean you aim to sell or buy at unfavorable prices. 

That said, I dont use any leverage at all, so my approach probably differs from the others here.
Did you have to tail him that?
The whole thing is looking eerily similar to Apr 2013 play out. Replace 20k with $200, replace 6k with $60.

What happens now is anyone's guess, but back then people were saying $20 or $10 was imminent. Obviously everything is different now - except it isn't.
It's over John, there wont be 2k BTC because someone on reddit bought bitcoin. Pack it up bears. 
The lower the price, the greater the "multiplier" I'm buying with the same amount of fiat. The lower my cost average, the bigger my potential gain. If I were using leverage I'd agree with you, you could buy at $20k and short and be massively in profit, but that's not my game at the moment.

Since before then.
I made no mention of my cold storage :-)

* EDIT: I was one of the first 20 people subbed to this channel, personally invited by /u/wtf_yoda in 2013
Quite possible that 6k was a false breakout, thanks for the picture
Thats why I said that something fishy here is going on. I won't roll the dice and let the fate decide about my investment, which at this moment is nothing but a gamble
[The very same](https://www.thebalance.com/black-wednesday-george-soros-bet-against-britain-1978944)
Soros is a great boogeyman.
i've noticed that alts are being hit much harder than btc but they often recover much faster as well.

When we went up to 7500 I've had pretty good gains (in both usd and btc) that i wouldn't have had if i kept btc only. Yet i didn't sell anything, most of the time I'm just a hodler due to the lack of trading knowledge. 

EDIT: i think i misinterpreted your question for some reason, sorry about that, too much caffeine today! i can see other people already replied to your actual question
Same time as far as I can see, at least alts I am following
same time, bots are fast :(
Hard to tell about calling their bottom.  They were much better off on Feb 6th than they are now, though BTC is basically the same price.
nope.  btc will find it's bottom first, then the rest will find their bottom weeks/months later.


The early investors who are smart enough to have made hundreds of millions and were planning to cash out had already done so. 

Anyone who has made millions nvm *hundreds* of millions in cryptos and didn't cash out a significant chunk (if not all of it) already be it by straight up selling or hedge shorting is either content with holding much, much longer than this or is absolutely, pants over head idiotic, and there really aren't *that* many idiots who get *that* lucky. 
Yeah you might be right, we will see.

it's probably time to learn more about trading indeed!
well been on a short since 8.4k

dont wanna thorw it all away now.

closed most of my postion at 7,3 in the recent fakeout.

and i dont like shorting in this 6k range as it just doesnt feel right
Haha eth might be a shitcoin, but you have to know it absolutely was the catalyst that caused the spectacular rise in bitcoin over the past few years.  Shitcoin props bitcoin up and helps bring it back down.
ETH has too much hype going for it, that will take years to dissipate. Dentacoin has got nothing going for it, it was solely driven by the bubble mania. That's why it's the perfect indicator.
Not sure why you were downvoted, I upvoted.  I hope you are wrong tho :)
Oh my god it's Jason Bourne
That's a lot easier when your short position is $4000 above spot, my friend lol
cos i want to keep my bumhole tight. dont want market makers fucking me too hard
wheres your stops?
That’s enough profit for 2 Big Mac meals and a monster energy drink 
Someone needs to make a gif of it. Would be absolutely hilarious
LOL yes exactly
I normally do post it anyway, I just figured people could relate, haha
Pretty accurate read of the situation IMO as someone who was an early 2017 adopter of ETH and was on ethtrader regularly back then
This is true, try telling them after they 100x in a year that maybe its a bit frothy and you are downvoted to oblivion while everyone remarks about being entitled to 1000x in a year.
Honestly we just keep it more light there than here. I go to ethtrader for entertainment and to bitcoinmarkets to know how fucked my investment is
ETH has gotten wrecked, even compared to BTC. down 75% from ATH is lower than BTC has gone, and if BTC goes there, they'll pass 80% I'm sure. I'm pretty happy I sold all my ETH over $800
Out of position. There's very little sense in shorting between $6,000 and $7,000, and even less sense in longing within that range.

I didn't know my dog was on reddit
Well, movements have been "odd" more and more lately, so yes. 

Every single pump and dump, for example, has been absolutely bananas. 

It's pretty strange to dump through a critical support zone, consolidate for awhile, pump back above that support zone, and then dump back below it again less than 24 hours later. 

I don't want to cry "manipulation," but I certainly wouldn't classify that sort of behavior as "normal."

markets shall only move per chewy neurons
Fib at 6657 has turned from support to resistance, looking to me like its just another pause/consolidation before finally breaking that trendline that held at 6k and 6.4k 
$6590, strong support. $6610, strong resistance.
I guesssss. Idk the way I see it is the market has spit back anything that has gone in this range, going long right above such substantial support (thus far) seems worth it. 

Honestly I'm just surprised how well it's holding and that last dip and quick return has me riding the bull. 
Yeah
Bitmex actually accounts for almost 90% of the volume, but I left it out since you're not actually buying or selling bitcoin on that exchange.

I can pull up a chart of Bitmex XBTUSD OBV later, if you're interested in seeing the result.
You know why - the more stagnant it apears, the more jarring the breakout will be. A quick finger on the button can save percentages.
Thank you for finding the blog post. I was checking their twitter and my mailbox and didn't find any announcement.

I agree that it is pretty sneaky how they increased the fee. Doesn't do much good to their reputation, imo.
Someones buying big it seems 
Yup i'm in the exact same boat as you. All in long at a really nice entry right now imo. 

After seeing the reaction to these two comments i made it just solidified my position. [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/89wnoa/daily_discussion_thursday_april_05_2018/dwuj7f4/) [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/89wnoa/daily_discussion_thursday_april_05_2018/dwuoga6/)
Would it not be dropping now if that was the case?
It matters if your working on a BTC-Tulip fork...
I regret a lot of things I’ve done in life.. but i definitely won’t regret making money 
That could be the stupidest answer I've ever read, but I've read on Tron subs, so you're far away from it.

Never regret a positive trade. You won $100 but could have won $1k? tough shit, still in profits. If this goes south, he won't have second thought.
He can always re open
Yeah I think that's something that people miss when they say something like this is that they compare the current bear market to the bull run of last year as if being contrarian in that market was always the right move from the get go. People were insanely bullish calling for 20,30,50,100k for *months* before we got to ATH, just because a bunch of people are bearish and are calling for 1k now doesn't mean that the bear market is going to suddenly reverse only a few months in. It didn't when it was the other way around...It took more time.
Well technically 5800 was when the bounce happened in Feb.
A&E double bottom in his making?
Such big (2-3k) pumps/drops will become more and more difficult. 
Just realized I was looking at the ETHUSD. Doesn't chance my stance on the overly bearish sentiment. No way I'd yolo here, but I think a dip to 6300 is about as low as we go before a nice bounce. Just going on my past experiences where everyone says lower lower lower and it goes higher.
volume just picked way up and buyers are not pushing back
Entered at 6650 when I noticed the triangle pattern broke to the downside.
RSI isn't oversold yet. There's some more room to the downside before that happens. Bear flags during the descent will only delay RSI from getting oversold.
just think, if this thing were to randomly pump now to 7.1k

what do you reckon will happen.

will you buy there?

or will you sell there?

and will more shorts get opened or more longs get closed?

the answer should pretty much determine your position.

way too many ppl waiting for 7k now t oshort or sell and therefor i dont think it will happen.

same as the magical 8.5k short entry or the 9.8k short entry that never happened.

Apparently not, lol
F
It is now, yes. 
We didn’t even reach 7k I was sure I’d wake
Up to 7k at least lmao the bullshit is real imo 
the stalemate at $6.6-6.6k...cmon...you know this. 

Of course bears are "winning" lately but like you said, it doesn't drop in a straight line. This could get real retarded and climb to 5 digits again even if it is still going to $3k
downvote
it could, but it could also make a move now with the 1h Bbands tightend!

He would drive every cent of real fiat out of the markets, like he did with the Bank of England.
I agree. It may not go much lower than this, but I could see a major pump and then right back to these levels
To be fair, the story about him 'crashing' the pound is grossly exaggerated. It was going to crash either way, he just sped the process along a little with his shorts -- he was hardly the only one shorting it, just the most famous one. British fiscal policy at that time was an absolute mess. 
I find it hard to believe that their interest would be to short down here after being so late to such a precipitous drop, but I guess it’s possible. 

To me, the more people get involved, the better it is for overall long term stability since competing actors will have different agendas, timelines, methodologies, etc. 
Supposedly his day to day involvement is minimal, but I imagine he does drive strategy some extent. 
You think a billionaire would come in to short this late to the party? I find that hard to believe 
I never claimed the trap to be over :) I just don't see this market as being ready for another proper bull run.
I think the tax pressure happened a while ago and now the market is largely being driven by TA downtrend momentum.
what people should do and what people actually do are very different. the estimate for the total tax burden for cryptos in 2017 in the us alone is $25B. that money has to come from somewhere, and there are most certainly many people who still haven't paid
cashed out awhile ago. I know I'm not the only person that procrastinates lol

Well he likely won't be alive in 10 years but yes, he fudded at ATH and now he is going to trade it all of a sudden. Sounds coincidental.
Yeah, if he goes long even without announcing it, he could start a bullrun if he invests enough cash. If he announces he's going long, all hell will break loose. Soros is a famously rich man.

i think thats too far down without a major bounce first. would be typical bitcoin to break 6k and bounce $1500 from 5.9k.
look at the volume dude:

>Is this your average / lower / higher position size? Good luck on the trade

Much higher than usual. I manage an 8 figure hedge, but my trades are usually 250k-2m. Thanks
>May i ask for your reasons here? Also thinking about DCAing into a low leveraged long but still fearful. My simple motivation here is a potential short squeeze tbh. Thanks in advance. 

News regarding India wasn't used by manipulators to smash the price. Expecting a short squeeze. 
>Which exchange do you use? Don't see any liquidity to sell into on Bitmex lol

Bitmex. I'll probably end up creating a series of smaller walls to close. Or make one giant hidden sell in front of a giant buy wall. This should be an exciting trade.

> First of all, any amount of profit is a good trade

Not true to a lot of people. Just because you happened to make money doesn't mean it was a good or a smart trade- and conversely, just because you happened to lose money doesn't mean it was a bad/dumb trade. This is how people get rekt with beginner's luck
I lose money day trading. I make money swing trading. 3-4 trades a month as well.
Tbf, considering the price was $19k it’s more likely whales are buying here than selling.

Not sure why they would “shadow sell” now.
that doesn't make sense. you can't mark a new higher when you are reversing a pattern. you are starting from a bottom.
Oh so why it wouldn't work is because bots doing the exact same thing could cause price to go in the opposite direction of my newly open position, resulting in funding to not be worth the loses I incurred from opening the position? 
it's enough to make me close out my shorts for a small profit and wait. I'm starting to get the feeling that we may need a substantial bounce to 8k or so for before 6.5k can be taken down. Too heavily defended on this run that I think support is pretty solid until there's another faith-breaking failed bull run. Thinking about opening a long here but stayin OOP for now
9 candles in a row closed below the close of 4 candles before it. Then to get the additional "completion" theres an another requirement I can't remember. 

There's a lot of other signals to read from the TD counters. Supposedly very reliable. But Im not well studied in it and have a hard time finding easy to digest info. Ive heard that it's not well applied to crypto yet and could use tweaking. 

Edit, and a reversal in this case would mean up. Red TD9 means a downward splurge. 
Tom DeMark sequential, you can find some PDFs if you want to know more about the indicator. Basically, when a candle closes lower than the previous 4th candle you start the count, so on with every new candle. Once you hit nine straight you have TD buy setup. And the opposite for a TD sell setup. Obviously, you should wait for confirmation that there is in fact a reversal happening. 

Tradingview has scripts you can use to better visualize it and do the count for you.
its a google away. trend down 9 candles
Maybe that's why people say this indicator  is not adapted for crypto, because we'll never sit around long enough for that to trigger. (If I understand correctly what you are saying)

Though I think that additional point you make is for "certainty" right?  What I understand is that TD signals are not often but when they are there are highly reliable signals. 

Edit, ah a buy signal not necessarily a reversal. Thanks for clarifying. 
Need to redefine what I think of as "weak" if thats the case lol. 
Yep still in a bear and I just got stopped out
I thought it extremely unlikely 8500 would be broken on volume going down, and set my entry at this point 

edit: fixed link https://www.tradingview.com/x/DvI3nmzX/
Hey now, I've seen satans butthole. I know pain. I was up by a factor of 4 and now im 66% down. I've been doing this for about a 8 months now. I'm just sayin, before the bullrun started last time it was like this....for like 1.5 months. But maybe it will be 1 week this time around
I feel like you are being sarcastic, but either method has always been hit or miss to me haha.

Most say that which is probably true but if you see the stock market tumbling and Bitcoin has already hit bottom of it's market cycle and even slowly going up you might be tempted to hedge but that's a big ***if*** it can go up. 
and you can't tell how many upvotes vs downvotes so you can't know percentage and you have about as non-random sampling as you can get
lmao yall memein 
I'm offended you think I can't change my mind! :O

I've been bearish since $10k up the first time around after $6k, but I know that shit doesn't always go down.

I'm just getting antsy because

1. this is where 2014 bear market turned around and bounced up to $11.7k
2. they also consolidated for like 10 days straight around this price level
3. the volume has been slightly lower (indicating a wyckoff double bottom)
4. we're also in a descending wedge (which has a volume profile that gets lower towards the end of the wedge)
5. a bounce up to $8-10k or so would truly crush people's spirits and allow for a sweet drop through $6k with little to no support on the way down. I'm not sure people are "broken" enough to allow for a drop through $6k yet

I haven't really worried about my short too much but here I'm beginning to get antsy. 
oh just a passing thought, I didn't think people would take it so seriously haha. I just am surprised it hasn't fallen through yet. 

We've been here for like what, a week now? And the buy walls are massive on finex. 

Maybe I'm just getting too antsy :)
Lmao i guess everyone thought I was just retardedly bearish?? I always had a price target of $6k and it changed recently when shit got even more bearish.. Now that we can't fall through $6k I'm reconsidering 


The soros news has got me wondering too 
There's just been so many damn coins bought here. Someone is accumulating the fuck out of $6k coins. If it doesn't fall through within like a day or two I'm just gonna close my short and wait until $6k breaks or something. We'll just have to see I guess
> They then sell their coins to bring us back down and keep buying

I wouldn't know how a hedge funds works, but I doubt they would do something that reckless while in accumulation phase.
Massive buy walls that pop up *immediately* after they're broken. 4.5k btc to $6.2k...

think about how many people have bought btc at $6.4-6.8k by now. The buy walls have been fucking massive.

We've just been sitting here for days now. It's been like a week in this range and we can't fall through. I'm thinking there may be an explosive move, and whoever accumulated here might have it in their interests to run up the price very quickly and then sell back on the way down

it just needs to fall through soon or it's not going to look like it's worth selling/shorting here because it never falls through. I guess you could say the same of longing at $7k tho
yes probably. or they'd hold til a bounce back from $5k
no idea who it is but these mofuckas really want their $6k btc
married to their position? /s
If bears are so strong why haven't they plunged the market? These volumes are pitiful . 
The sub of a few do not hold the same views of many
There's an irony in that the people who repeatedly post "capitulation is still far away judging by this sub" are likely to be the ones who, if the price does crash to $1000, will get super angry if anyone suggests BTC isn't actually for real this time dead at that point.

If the price goes super crazy scary low, you can bet these guys will be in here saying BTC is worthless at any price, that being involved with it at all is stupidity etc etc.

The irony, in short, is that the ones who mock the sub for not capitulating, will be the first to capitulate.

Though not you of course /u/ChrisMrShowbiz, because Exceptionalism.
You're funny. For someone who throws out such a volume of predictions, one would expect, simply on the balance of probability, that you'd be right occasionally... and yet... At least the comments of yours that I've read - you've been wrong every single time.
lol thats exactly what i meant.

we will dump to 6k, a bit below that possibly, 5.8 to 5.7 even ?

but then there will be a bounce, just the no of shorts leads me to believe that a tonne load of bitcoin will need to be bought back.

a bounce to 6.7k minimum is on the cards.

unless there is a pump now?
See, I subscribe more to the idea that market makers in this space help move the price with the trend intentionally.  In other words, if there's more bearish sentiment, they'll specifically take advantage and try to move the btc price downwards (knowing that factors they CANNOT control - e.g., retail demand, will work in conjunction with their efforts).  There's a war between retail buyers and sellers right now.  Unfortunately on days like today, after Trump is declaring that he'd like an additional $100billion in Tariffs against China, the retail buyers become more cautious and those who are holding with weak hands re-consider their position.
I'll buy more for the hold stack at 5k *and* 4k.
Yeah, I agree with you. if it dips below $6k ill put in 5%, then increase my position at $5500 to 15%. Beyond that, who knows. If it goes to 4k, i will buy, but only fractionally larger.
Indeed... I just took more back here at 6.6 too.   It fully stops out at above 6700, which is still within profit.
Ah yes, this is the one upside. Today has been... frustrating to say the least.
I dunno, isn’t the definition of insanity doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results?
Good old times where you could make thousands out of a $10 move.
Yeah, try doing this for 4 months. And now they're almost back to the same price point again 😂
We did bottom out at $6600 for a long time.

And this rally will be PANIC BUYING by dumbass shorts who need to cover a billion dollars worth of bitcoin combined with panic buying by people who are starting to realize what a massive bubble traditional securities are in, not FOMO.

It's basic farking math.  Don't borrow a globally demanded commodity whose supply shrinks every day.  Did these guys not learn about supply and demand over the course of their expensive educations?
You don’t need many buyers the local top
You just need one huge whale buying. The market cap is low in the grand scheme of things. Of course it could go (much) lower.

But it is a mistake to think retail buyers will flip the market. The buyers are here. They are not many of them but they are much bigger than you or me. Too many noobs shorting the bottom will learn the hard way. Risk reward for longs is good and getting better
You are going to Egypt
Someone that is bullish and posts about buying has no intention on making any else money. Let's be honest their only goal is to make money. They only reason they are posting is because they are looking for reassurance. If you're bullish for the foreseeable future and you know its going to be a while until we hit the top and you buy/sell or trade why visit reddit sub everyday to post about how much further the price has risen or to guess how high it will go? It all human nature in my opinion, but when it comes to money it shows how manipulative people really are.


I know bud I was being disingenuous. To be clear though, I have nothing against bears who contribute well reasoned arguments about price predictions. 
I can't imagine many bears are getting rekt by such a small increase. 

Hell, turn what he's saying the other way - why should bitcoin have value?
> Hasn’t the last 4 months been the “return to normal phase”? 

Nope. But the bubble chart is kinda bullshit TBH.
I don't think there is **the** return to normal phase. We're probably in a bear market and now and then, in a bear market, the market moves above one or more of the declining trendlines.

I think we're getting closer to a high probability that this will happen.

I wouldn't be surprised if we see $10,000 or $11,000 before heading lower again and bottoming out somewhere in 2018 or 2019 around the $2,000 to $3,000 level.
Bulls are in hiding, that's why it's so quiet in here. Watch the bulls jump around like crazy after the next $250 bounce.
Not since the push to 7.5 a few days ago anyway...
Yeah it's 8 hours away but if the daily closes below it, yet another very bearish sign. Honestly if it closes on it, it's bearish, seeing as the others usually wicked down and bounced off it on the 1d
Want to elaborate?
The USD pair depends mostly on the actions of Bitcoin, which is looking decidedly bearish for the moment. Although, a decoupling of XMRUSD to BTCUSD would be very strong for the ratio and isn't impossible.
no such thing as a triple bottom.
[deleted]
But I get the impression by reading this thread that most large candles are caused by large orders.
I assume you're talking about Bitfinex. How does a 1000 coin buy on Bitfinex equate to a jump in the price on say GDAX? I didnt' see any particularly high market buys on GDAX on the way up. Shouldn't there be a gap in the BTC value between the two markets if one had a huge purchase?
Sad state of affairs when its impossible to know if you are joking or not.
Ah yes, that $50 dump.
Every attempt to dump since 6.4 has been bought decently, shorts have been raising a lot without the price moving down, real buy numbers vs usual bots 0.02 buys. Been reading about wyckoff while bored at 6.6k and it looked like accumulation for once. Market (pros) testing patiently a support, convincing? Up. 

Don't get me wrong I'm still bearish but when everyone screams 3k end of the weekend and there's no money left to make it happen because everything is stuck in shorts it doesn't happen, same pb when longs were at ATH at 11.7k.

Yes, could be another Bart, but do you have a plan if it's not? Is my advice.

Personally I'm leaving my long open, think 7.2 is in the books.
You sure told him 
See how so I told you? (Wasn't serious btw if that wasn't clear)
Exactly, majority of that volume was stops and liquidations 
you are probably right
You're right. It's safe to short here. 
bulls are looking at each other, in discomfort, in front of the elevator. 
You don’t need many buyers. Just a big one with huge pockets 
Very true. I think right now the reason we've had no movement is because both bulls and bears are finding it's safest just to stay out of position. 
Very possible but r/r says to short here with a stop over the falling wedge trendline 
I’m cool either way as I only short to hedge cold storage 
that is not what is happening. Shorts are increasing and longs are decreasing.

Wow awesome article. Just skimmed through I’ll take the time to read it when I’m off work later. 
Slowly learning. Playing it smart and a little on the safer side. Thanks 
That's what you are! You're and old potato!
It’s ass eating szn. Maybe that’s it 
Begone with you spirit, and trouble me no more.
This is what I have targeted as well.
Being my first leveraged trade, little nervous to put it that low. But I also said scared money don’t make money. 
Greed has killed me to a point of death and despair along the way. I’m not scared to take profits anymore. Profit is profit even if it’s 100$ or 500$. I’m not looking for the 1000% gains I was when I first started crypto
Support. Resistance to downward movement is support.
It's hard to paint a more obvious double bottom without actually confirming it.

Good lord this is either a lesson about waiting for confirmation or a clear market signal.
Its true.  But lets be honest, the majority of alt traders didnt think they needed to pay taxes on coin transitions for the majority of the year.  They are all likely underwater for their assumptions.
Until the walls all get pulled and you suddenly only need a couple of hundred coins to cause a big move.
You're making too much sense now stop so we can fantasize about mythical institutional investors donating lambos to us hodlers 😊
Weird, anytime I make a post that has a link in it I can't see it from my other account 
Ah the good old 2017. 20 forks a year, half of them with fake free coin scam and the other with actual free coins flowing all the dumb money into Bitcoin.

Miss that..
I'm not fully up on all the terminology. I know what forking is. What specifically are they saying is going to happen to BTC? Is this expected in the next few days? I couldn't find anything specific.
You'd better be watching the USA/NK matter. If there is no war threat, Japanese mainstream money is going out. Just look at the Japanese market BTC charts every time a north korean missile flew near their country. Was actually really a thing.
It looks like it's the other way around at this point, frankly. But you might be right. Maybe they have another 100,000 coins to dump. We shall see.
All you'd be doing where I'm from is raking up a high tax bill with very little to show for it.  Feels bad man.

Your comments are really pathetic right now. 
10 days ago you claimed to be "a buyer ( adding ) significant at these levels". The price was about $8000 back then.

I used to really like your funny comments when we were in the uptrend. Now you seem desperate.

Drunk American checking in, I spend ~10% of my check on health insurance. 
Thanks, I didn't know that! That confirms I'm high on hopium then :)
Very true, guess I took the bias as a given. Well that's probably why they have been breaking in opposite directions lately to throw more traders like me off lol
Lol of course it had to happen right after hitting submit on that comment.
Lots of bag holders trying to create fomo to sell their coins. This is nothing more than a weekend pump done while the news cycle is dead (as governments generallly don't announce bans on the weekend).
To be fair the bulls are traumatized now.
which is a ~7% difference for anyone wondering 
I made a bot that bought/sold based on the Trading view buy/sell indicators, 15min didn't work so I went to 1 hour, 1 hour didn't work so I tried 1 day.  After that didn't work I gave up that strategy.  I also tried a strategy using only the Oscillators and that didnt work either.
That and tradingview telling me it's a strong sell have been amazing for me lol. 
i think we drop a bit more before it gets ugly for shorters. This is actually super crazy.

Everybody says that until we actually get there. 
The sunk cost fallacy isn't quite so straight forward when cost basis and short-term/long-term capital gains come into play. 
What? I don't even hold any btc. I just feel that fall to $4800 is normal, while lower prices would generate more uncertainty about the future of Bitcoin. 
I agree, and to be honest I also don't see none of them happening. I guess the most likely scenario is to reach 7-7.2k and going down again to this level.
>Chasing stop losses all the way up to 7.2 and breaking the 11.7 -> 9k resistance is the best case scenario.

I just can't see this happening right now (people would simply re-short higher up each time) and $6.4K level will only withstand so many attempts at it. $5.5K to $6K is such a juicy confluence zone I can't see the market not heading there.
Ya tough to see, but if the stock market is going down and Bit is going up it will be undeniable at least for some.   Not getting my hopes up but the headlines would definitely show that meme like crazy, question is would money start flowing in if the stock market is losing, maybe if the dollar is losing value too but we're probably too early for that, looks like we might find out the way the markets are acting and the trade war fears.  
i have the sentiment of a the one last pump will happen too
I hate to say it, but TA has been mostly out for me for the past few days, with stop-loss hunting and whales (such as aabtc from the other day) pushing the price one way or another, it's been hard to trust which direction the market is going in the short term based simply on TA. Too many people have quit trading in the short-term, emptying the order books and making it much easier for big players to exert their will on the price. Things like BBands, horizontal resistance/support lines, triangles, wedges, and head/shoulders have been mostly reliable, but I wouldn't bet your house on them right now.
We could absolutely drop below $6500 over the next few days, but it seems we may have another DCB in the books. We're looking at a solid rejection of $6500 so far.
lol
Yup, that is the best safe play right now.  
Possibly, I have also noticed when either side is out of whack BTC tends to, whack it and we're at ATH wack it time. 
 I linked to it, did it not work? If not just search shorts on tradingview.com where it says ticker and it should be the first one. 
> CMC top 10 that's fallen the most recently

I think that that strategy is better in the bull market.  Have been wondering if it's worth doing in a bear market, seems risky.
what if everyone in this thread did a market buy of 1 btc each at the same time :O
Oh no.
There is no danger of a 51% attack. The ASICs are as efficient as the most efficient GPU rigs (eg. GTX 1060s). The ASICs just cost less. 

As such the ASICs are in no way a threat of a 51% attack as all GPU hardware currently deployed won't be become obsolete. It's also worth noting that CNBC (which confirmed Bitmain had ASICs prior to them announcing it) that they've learned of at least 3 other competitors making ASICs for Ethereum.
Yeah, there has been issues with our banks and fiat on ramps. Our biggest exchange, quadriga, has been having all sorts of issues.
Touche, I suppose it depends on your style of trading. I prefer bigger moves (swing trader) rather than sideways action between resistance and support.
watch it rise like a phoenix
One does not simply walk away from crypto 
heh, yeah, about that...

https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/there-never-was-real-tulip-fever-180964915/

Edit: My favourite quote from the article:

“All the outlandish stories of economic ruin, of an innocent sailor thrown in prison for eating a tulip bulb, of chimney sweeps wading into the market in hopes of striking it rich—those come from propaganda pamphlets published by Dutch Calvinists worried that the tulip-propelled consumerism boom would lead to societal decay. Their insistence that such great wealth was ungodly has even stayed with us to this day.

tldr: haters gonna hate
Nearly everyone's a bear, shorts at an ATH not sure about that.
He has several big accounts. 480k seems like peanuts to him. Dont know what he is about, found him yesterday on twitter...
That is my usual stake too ;)
Isn't the max position size 1100 BTC (worth of contracts)?
Great advice /s

Don't marry your position, tight stops.
How on earth could you be down 700% though? Oh and I'm not underwater btw, I'm still well into profit I suppose since I shorted from 7002 CA, but it seems the fees have eaten like $100 already? For reference my open position is 2 BTC, I'm not really sure how much fees I'm paying but it seems to be a lot 
I wouldn't be surprised in the least but I would laugh so hard if it did.
But what if you really wanted to buy 1k btc? Honestly it might just be someone antsy and just giving in, but who knows.
Is it weird that I'm more nervous now because of the calm than when things are volatile? Some kind of bitcoin syndrome developing here
I feel like if 6800 doesn’t hold for a few hours, the drop is gonna be ugly. Please surprise us BTC. It’s too obvious. 
These Shorts are funded by these "get rich quick kiddies" who brought bitcoin at 16k+ and now Panic leaving i think we need at least one big washout before we can think about the end of the bear market.
Longing at 18K was okay wasn't it? As long as you closed at 19.2 or whatever.
nah,

more like longing at 13k

was very profitable too
only about 360 have closed so far.

No. Actually I'm not. Any drop here and the 31k shorts will start to close and slow our descent giving me plenty of time to get out if I feel I need to or just average down my long.

You need to zoom out further.
See you on the weekend
aye, but 6570 is holding decently so im being pretty careful

It'd be interesting to know just how many of their customers trade >$10M/month.  I'd wager it's a very small number.

We don't currently (they're a low-volume exchange for us, mostly b/c of withdrawal limits), but we *were* >1% on some of their markets (and hence paying lower fees), so we're not insignificant either.

Also worth noting: their BTC/FIAT markets (i.e. the largest ones) previously had a 25bps taker fee at the lowest tier.  That's now 30bps.

(agreed about simplifying things though, at least they've taken away that silly rebate system they had)
Yes, they also pushed a UI update, but the fee structure *did* change (see above).
It definitely changed, and for the worse (across the board) for us.

It was previously a per-market fee, and your fee was based on your volume (as a percentage of their total volume on that market) over the last 30 days.  Basically if you traded more than 1% of their volume on that market (which we did), your fees were lower.  Now it's a flat fee for all markets based on your total usd volume.  For us at least, it has gone up on all markets.

tbh, I can understand them changing their fees, it's just the fact that it was done without notifying their customers that pisses me off.  I'm not sure yet how much it cost us, but it did cost us.  And we won't be the only ones.
that's a regular bear div. A hidden one is when the RSI makes higher highs and price makes lower highs 
Hidden bear div is lower high for price and higher high for oscillator no? https://www.babypips.com/learn/forex/divergence-cheat-sheet
You guys should learn to use percentage. A $100 pump is not really important at 11k . at 6k its 2% which is something you dont usually see. Besides the fact taht it was actually 200-170.
Pretty serious fizzle when it hit 6800. 
[deleted]
Why do so many bears here think 6800 - 6600 = 100?? 6750 - 6600 if you want to be conservative.

People ONLY buy now because they think others will support them eh? 
How did gold end up again? I forgot
but long term BTC will end up just like any other currency which is assigned a value based on its rarity.

What’s your expectation? 6 more months?
true but there could still be a huge bounce up to 8 or 9k at some point.
2014 ended exactly in a V\-shape at this point \(both charts show about 4 months time\-span\):

Same strategy. This has been the best strategy since  20k overall.
Kind of like how it will never go below 10k because demand would be to high?
[deleted]
This is because of transaction batching, employers around the globe are paying their employees in bitcoin and they use batching to do this. 
It means everyone is using LN, there's almost 10 whole BTC being used on the entire LN which is huge. 

This is great for bitcoin.
$6000 > $3000 > bounce to $4800 > $1200 > bounce to $1500 > $250 > bounce to $320 > $60 > 0.

We all know. 
Next stop: Goblintown
Down. My guess is a bottom in a few months between 2 and 4K.
You have to be blind to not see where this is going, and has been going for weeks.
Not really. 

The charts are in a very steady and predictable  decline. They've actually been that way for weeks now.
Didn't you get the memo?
I caught the daily high yesterday for my short so it's a pretty healthy profit closing here. 

Low volume is never fun for shorts because it means that some bulls might delusionaly throw money at the price thinking it's the bottom even if we've only been consolidating there for half a day. 
You don't know me bro. My 100 contracts had a butterfly effect that ignited the bear apocalypse from 19k. 
the bigger wedge resistance line is at around 7.1k now, this is only 300 USD more to go.

never said we will go back to 19k. maybe 9k, maybe 11k if this is a reversal... who knows...

Lol you can check my history. I've been posting this for months now.
Or the bottom already happened. I'm confident that $6000 is it. 
The secret to getting rich is locking in your profits. I refuse to think any early hodlers would be dumb enough to keep it this long, that's too depressing.
Try stock options like a gentleman. Daily high percentage swings, cheap or even free trades, tons of platforms, and it's pretty easy. 
you can extrapolate what it does historically to what it should do, and what that would mean for the price.

4hr has been very good so far
Thats a bit too optimistic.. but if we keep getting more volume and strength than i believe we can sustain this. 
Why would bulls be extinct when we're in a minor correction of what is a MASSIVE bull market going on since 2009? If anything, this is the time to open huge long positions.

Yes, which is why the descending triangle carries bearish implications. Support is tested over and over, diminishing the buy volume each time.

shut up stupid bear!
this happens everywhere and has been happening for 100s of years in traditional markets, it would be weird if everyone was united 
Now if only the whales would start showing that same competitive edge
So when are you going to quote my many false predictions? Still waiting. 
No, it is not a shock.  I understand that there is also a functioning market in conjunction with what I mentioned.  I also understand that there are individuals running bots.  If you think that the exchanges are also not also running bots (and more), you are wrong.
Bulls, bears, just nice to see it doing something
[removed]
>implying i said it was a thing and not referencing previous discussions


Correct, but it definitely influences spot markets through arbitration.  More importantly it provides credibility to Bitcoin as a "legitimate" asset class with long term staying power.  The CME is the biggest futures market in the world.
I do think $2K is unrealistic. I actually am tracking about where you are it...80% is where I'd be comfortable throwing all the discretionary money at it. 80% to 90% is an additional 50% drop, and that just doesn't seem plausible. Falling from $4K to $2K is like falling from $20K to $10K, percentage-wise. It can certainly happen, and greed knows no bounds, but I truly hope it doesn't. 
If we break up, I'll set take profits on 50 percent of our september long, spread out between 7k and 7.5k, and decide the other 50 percent later.  Going to go set those limits now.
I'm sitting on a 5x long at 6525 with a market stop at 6469, took 25% out at 6618 earlier, taking another 50% out at 6649 and gonna leave the rest to see what happens.

Still very much learning as I go but last 5 trades have been at least 5% profits, nothing big but profit is profit I guess. 
I agree. I wanted to close my 6700 short at 6501 but i missed it by a few dollars on kraken, might as well close it around 6550 for peace of mind (and maybe open a long with a tight stop).
> I've gotten tired of watching double-digit ROE positions reverse and close at breakeven.

Put it that way.  Yeah, that's a wake up call, thanks.  Even looking at my position where it currently is, I have not claimed an equal amount to what I have already claimed, and it's in double digits.

Going to adjust things to not have any loss at all on any stop, and move up my takes aggressivly, only leaving a small percentage to ride later.

Gotta reverse the greed balance.
To the contrary, I think whichever way it moves SHOULD be far.  The trend is down, so that's the smart bet.  However, the fact that our huge bearflag from yesterday broke down and only dropped $100 is reason enough for pause.
Usually I think it is said if it is not going up it will eventually go down. Taking in consideration that we're in bear market we're expecting to have wave down to complete formations. It just interesting why it is not falling yet.
I disagree. When we're consolidating for a move (usually in a larger range than this) there's been plenty of microdumps that move the needle $50 or so and then get bought up very fast, and vice versa for pumps. It's just this range is strangely liquid right now and the little dumps/pumps aren't changing the price drastically, the volume on them is still pretty par for the course. 
Well, that's what SL is for. You take risks, but you always control those risks.

No pain, no gain.
[Whats that word.... schadenfreude?](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/89wnoa/daily_discussion_thursday_april_05_2018/dwuj7f4/)
That's the thing, to many it seems people are jumping ship and leaving crypto, in reality people are just trying to hedge their losses and buy back in when the r/r is right.

The end of a bear market/bottom is when people should be very bullish like you said
Ironically, I don't actually hold the underlying asset anymore either, outside my trading stack. That was a decision I had to make for personal reasons, not because I don't think it'll go up eventually. Funds I didn't need became funds I did need. I was fortunate to sell over $11K though. My whole goal of my trading stack is to rebuild cold storage, and if I can do that with a CA under $6K I'd be thrilled. 
I also don't think the mainstream/non-redditor previously invested person has lost faith in blockchain altogether, based on ancedotal sentiment. But it's maybe still too risky for their blood. And it's tough to know how that attitude may shift if we see a prolonged bear market. But they will return if they think money is to be made
>are you saying you think we'll drop much lower and then not recover to our current level?

I'm saying that your indicator of people wanting to buy bitcoin at some point after dropping further is a bullish indicator from a lower entry point. It does not seem to indicate bullishness from our current price. 
They are though I wouldn't dare try with how the market is right now. This is absolute madness.
Similar thoughts here, also scaling down my short position from a similar CA. Was really expecting 6500 to not hold up this time, and it still may not, but it's gonna take a bearwhale push that I can't count on
Agreed. Experienced scalpers might be able to squeeze out profit, but it's a dangerous medium-term position.
Maybe I'm not looking at the same divergence you are - I was looking at the daily RSI before the 7.5k bounce to now. Snaggy is blocked at work so I can't see your images.

The point is that until the daily turns around the daily RSI will keep dropping more with every red candle. If the daily doesn't turn around before the RSI goes below ~30.5 (where it was when it bounced to 7.5k) it's no longer divergence.

It's also important to keep in mind all the hidden bear divs we've been getting (will make a chart when I get the time).
Yeah good point.  You'd have to use tons of margin, it's the only thing that makes it worth it in forex, that was what I was joking around with.

But you can loose that spread on those fees if you trade somewhere that pays you to be a maker like bitmex.
Short-term bottom. Nobody knows where the true bottom is yet if we're being honest with ourselves here.
The short interest on Bitfinex is incredibly high right now. Something to be mindful of if you're short. We could get a hell of a squeeze if shorts start blinking.

But I also mean short-term bottom.
how bout you moby on dick outta here...
Yeah haha, this bear market will never end!
You're going to sell the potential bottom or close to that? I don't see the point unless you either don't see Bitcoin and the markets to comeback in the near future, you need the money or you see it going way lower.   Non of them (except needing the money for you) make much sense, but if it helps you sleep at night that's good.

>"Markets are constantly in a state of uncertainty and flux and money is made by discounting the obvious and betting on the unexpected." - George Soros

everybody is expecting a crash...
Watch his interviews if you haven't. He has no sense of personal responsibility when it comes to manipulating markets because "someone else would have done it anyways". That's all I needed to hear to figure out what kind of person he is.
Not necessarily, compare now to Feb 6th.  That was BTC's bottom of recent history, but now April 6th is ALTs bottom of recent history.

The micro movements are bot controlled, but not necessarily the longer term trends and short term diversions from that.
Yep mad props to ETH from bringing awerness to BTC in  2017.

Now shitcoin can die and let the king trade with less bad players.

Actually BTC had 2 bubbles in 2017, first ETH/shitcoins and CME. I think the CME bursted and now its the shitcoin bubble that is bursting on BTC.

Either way I'm a short term bear(out of position) and long term bull.
I use shitcoins as indicators too. Right now my shitcoin indicator is UET because there is absolutely no reason why it should have value at all other than the fact that it's on an exchange. Zero roadmap, no devs, no hope. Sitting at $40,000 marketcap right now. In January during all the hype it was $1,000,000. 
A year ago ETH was at 45$. It's way overhyped, bad tech and bad players (ico) in it. Its still at an insane valuation
Lmao i earned this okay! 
6340
I held way too long but still got out in the low 6's/high 5's when BTC was crashing. Timing sucked in the short term but ended up working out okay.

If BTC does end up going to 5k, ETH could glance 300, at which point I will have to start buying again for my hodl stack
woof! woof woof!
Retail investor here. This is looking like a bottom. Looking forward to getting back on the bitcoin train after four months waiting at the station.
my only worry is everyone has this natural inclination to assume we're going to go up when the charts have been suggesting down for a very long time. the bull seems unbroken in many of us still 
That's a reasonable point, and I'd certainly appreciate that if you have time.
Yeah, that's basically it. It's a special kind of torture. The less exciting the charts the more important it is to watch them. I spent 2 months watching charts everyday of ETH consolidating at $300. Thinking everday that *this* will be the day. Well eventually that day came.
Have you not seen all the other bart formations? Did you miss all the action at $7.8k to $8.2k? It did this for like 4 days, the price will get pumped, sit at the artificially inflated price for a few hours, then dump right back down

Everyone holds their breath for a pump that never comes.

Sure, it could happen here (which is why the price isn't immediately tanking) but this looks quite literally exactly like every other bart so far
[deleted]
And just cause we never reach 1k....well even 'only' 5k is still a 25% drop from 6.5k, which I would like to profit on both ways. In the same way that 15k->20k was "just" a 33% increase instead of 4x +
True but we really blasted through the 6000 range and we had a short lived bounce at 6500. What I mean is that the price could not remain so low for so long. It either bounced or dropped, people were panic selling and catching knives. It was chaos, not this sideways apathy and uncertainty we have now. 
You are going to concert
I see. Is it different to the two previous dips though? I got rekt shorting the last one :|
That was instantaneous, I jinxed it!
That would be beyond fucked up

There were a few others though, right? Didn't he crash a small countries economy. I forgot which it was. 


Me too, but who knows how the Soros Fund works. 

It seems bullish to me for sure (I've been waiting for someone like Soros or Buffet or something) to touch crypto and see what they do/say.

But he's probably not directly involved and it's not like the fund management is going to be 100% correct. My statement was a dramatic reaction that's probably completely overexaggerated.

I also actually didn't mean to imply he was going to short/crash it. Just meant that we'd be at his mercy 
ya that's why I'm not taking it as huge news. I expect him not to be particularly involved
I was half kidding. But, billionaires have intel that a lot don’t. Honestly, I don’t think we’re far from finding the bottom. 
Does anybody know how this 25 billion is estimated?
I have a Hungarian friend who is always talking about how Soros wants to break up traditional hierarchies / Instituions.

Always surprised me he was against crypto - would make sense he just wanted to buy in cheaper. Hopefully that’s the case as would be great to have him on the crypto train.

It's already coming out today that his fund is going to trade it. CNBC and business insider.

Agreed. Not saying 5k won't happen, but expectations from most are an expectation of 6k to test the bottom. It'll become self fulfilling.
>  and bounce $1500 from 5.9k.

you're expecting a 25% bounce? idk 
i meant the 5k range.

i have staggered buy orders from 5.9k to 5k in the june futs 
Haha... I'm an idiot.

Right as I clicked submit on comment, a bearwhale appears and follows up with the slam. :(
Lol maybe I deserved that smart ass response for my lack of specifics. I meant it only looks like long 70 positions closed out of like 33k. Doesn’t seem significant. If you mean the top graph, still only a few hundred positions, only 1% of outstanding positions, again, doesn’t seem significant. I feel like I’m missing something.
What do you think about a Bitmex-esque platform for stocks? So it would allow users to collect fees by setting limit orders; those who utilise market orders will pay the fees.
Thank you kind sir. I'm still new to this and will try with a small long aswell.
Would you push it further up from here? :)

I'm beleive he was asking more of "what would you consider a successful trade", as opposed to "what would you consider a smart trade". You can have the former without the latter.
That's because it's not reversing. Do I really have to draw every lower high on the chart since the 20k top? 
Yes, simply said: you won't beat the bots.
$8K isn't really too likely without breaking 6400. That's a higher high on a higher low, which would surprise me and also shift the paradigm. 7100 is likely, 7400 is possible. If it goes over that I'd be concerned to be holding any shorts below. 
There is also the countdown that occurs after the setup before actually buying. On setup completion you start comparing the close to the close of the candle two candles before it and wait until (for a buy countdown) the count of candles that close below the low two candles before is up to 13. This count doesn't reset if a candle doesn't follow.

Edit: close below the low two candles before, not close.
Writing it here means 100 people don't have to Google it 
Yeah we'd need a count of 13 candles closing below the the low two bars earlier for the countdown to finish. We're at two right now.

A perfect TD setup would be if the 8th and 9th close below both the 6th and 7th (I think). Candle 9 did so but candle 8 didn't.

And yeah this is the first time I've really read a bunch about TD sequentials, no idea how reliable it is for crypto.
Stops too tight perhaps? There's a huge amount of resistance so honestly as bearish as I am feeling (and I am feeling bearish) there's far less resistance to it going up than down.
I know, and please don't take it personally. I sometimes say this whenever it feels like everyone is getting a little too optimistic. I don't think there was nearly enough suffering for us to call the bottom yet is all.
Thank you Sir!
I can’t help but make fun of you perma-bulls ;)
By what measure are we where the 2014 bear market was?
I mean, let’s be honest 

Do we really expect it to fall below 5.5k

I mean, there was next to no hype when SegWit2X was cancelled. No one would get their free coins etc.

We were at 7k a few days later.

I cant see it falling through, and Im sure the ones buying don’t either
[deleted]
Maybe not a hedge fund, but what about the guy who sold a couple million in shitcoins in Jan?
Making a lot of good points overall here. On the other hand I think you may just need to be patient if this ends up being a slow bleed long bear run. On the other other hand, if this is a REALLY long slow bleed, a rise up, it could immediately have a stupid pump to high heavens to 9.3k and still be under long term log resistance. So maybe our short term bottom is in.

Leaving my freshly opened shorts in for now though
$6K accumulators, we here ;)
[deleted]
Isn't 11k last month to where we are now not a plunge? Or should we call it a "slight dip"
I didn't understand a word you were saying.
Just post my predictions fool. You really must be fantasizing about me since you keep referencing predictions I'm not making. I've made like 2 in the past week and one came to fruition. 
that's also the definition of "practice" and a few other things. it's a silly little saying lol
it’s actually not, that’s a pretty common saying though 


Rode it and sold just shy of ATH and buying back my stack again is so awesome.
Oh this post is super clever, I see what you did, you like Ctrl+C Ctrl+V his post and then you changed just the tiniest things to make it like the opposite. So clever, that's really clever.
I've heard that argument since 2010
>I can't imagine many bears are getting rekt by such a small increase. 

Considering the high leverage and tight stops being utilized by many, I'm not surprised by this : https://mobile.twitter.com/bitmexrekt
That would mean Bitcoin behaves differently than every other market in history. Highly unlikely.
Bulls are quiet because they get down voted and yelled at. Typical bear market stuff. Bulls sure seem antsy to get back into this, though.
Okay... How can an arbitrary sell off at $4900 indicate a level of support 7 months later to any degree of accuracy? It doesn't make sense. Your lower blue line is an important support line, but you need to go closer to see where exactly it is. 

The section of brownline that goes from $6000 to the recent lows is relevant, but going below that line means going below the current support levels anyway which again makes it arbitrary and there's no point going further left than the $6k point. Any other point on that line to the left is both arbitrary and coincidental. 

So basically-Brownline adds nothing to the conversation and shouldn't really be considered. I'm sorry, I'm very picky about TA. 
I hear you. But if the XMR/BTC ratio is shifting in a big way, so will the XMR/USD price at the end of the day. And vise versa.
If you say based on downtrend it will keep dropping, then why stops at 5k? It may as well keep dropping to 1k or less. The thing is the trend must reversal at some point and no one know where is the fair point.
By singular large orders? Lately? Yes. Before a few weeks ago? No.

All the time lately? No, not necessarily. 

And it depends on what timeframe you're talking about. Large candles on the 4h? Likely not a single market buy. On the 10m? Yes, probably one guy who decided he wanted 1000 btc RIGHT NOW.
Arbitrage bots and people seeing the jump on bfx and fomoing.
Pretty much every exchange follows bitfinex. GDAX is a shadow of what it used to be- there's virtually no price discovery coming out of that exchange anymore. They just follow bitfinex. I suspect most of the orders on there are conducted by bots
was $100 from when he posted to the bottom and shooting down. obv not anymore
Alright I’ll take your advice. Part of me wants to close here and open a short, but maybe 7200 is a better place to do that. SL set for small profit regardless. Biggest lose would be an ok short entry. So I can live with that R/R. 
My thoughts exactly.. then a dump to around 5790 as a final shakeout
You sure? 
Good. We need lots of shorts to end the bear run. 


Actually longs just started increasing right as we hit 6500 based on that 
You have to be careful, though - if you don't let your winners run at least a bit, your losers will bury you. Many smart traders have more losing trades than winning ones but come out ahead because they know to let the leash out on their winners.
I was going to post this earlier but then I realised to a sub increasingly full of shorters, a price that won't fall IS resistance. To them.
I'm seeing more volume on the first than the second though. 
true, I also think Tom Lee is spouting shilly BS though because nobody wants to call it a bubble
Cant see many huge single walls. lots of little ones which fills me with a little more hope. 
Could be your account. can you post links to other subs?

Do you mainly only post links to one website? Of content you created?
It's a joke, a stable coin like tether is designed to have static value
Fyi USMC sent a lot of equipment over to our base in SK (just in case). 
I hope so.
Yeah that is horseshit.  If you can increase a stack of bitcoin and cash over a year it should be taxed as income on the plus side.  Irs won’t come after small stakes though.  I’m not too concerned.  They will no doubt go after big winners not declaring.
And maybe I'm Funny... But that's me . I enjoy live... Investing is just a hobby.
with success

Nope. 
When 500$ down I buy..from 8K. Down.
Even when it goes to 4K or lower.

Reversal will come... any day / days.
Not desperate.... Just making money. Which I did already when I bought at 600$ and a bit more.
No worries. I have time and $$


better then have it on the bank with 0.2 interest rate

Same here.. but I finally learned to buy the crypto on Friday before the six pack lol
To be fair the fair is fairer than fair 
Good bot.
TV has been at strong sell for a while actually. It's just a lagging indicator. Remember half of the formula for strong buy or sell is literally technical indicators like MAs and stuff
whens the last time theirs been a true short squeeze? seems like its been ages, i think we're due
Not a problem if you don't have any gains.
You asked for best case scenario, if you already have your opinion I don't see the point asking :)
A more reliable indicator for me lately has been selling pumps and taking profits early, especially when traders are massively over-leveraged. Stop-loss hunting has been a source of easy profits for whales, and I don't want myself getting caught in the crossfire.

[Here's a great source for determining short/long health](https://datamish.com/dashboard/db/btcusd?refresh=20s&orgId=1).
I doubt we will only test it once though. Im thinking of closing my short with a smaller profit close to 6.5 soon and sleeping peacefully.
Your link gave me a Cardano/Bitcoin pair chart.
Would probably move about tree fiddy
I'm up, willing to buy five, if others participate :D
It's like every chinese jumping at the same time changing earth's orbit 
1200 people here supposedly.  We'd move the price like *140 dollars on finex.

Edit, *if* we could beat the arb bots which would level it out with the other exchanges before we even noticed a difference.
No. 7 4h dojis is terrible for trading. 
More like Icarus?
lol I told myself I would like 8 times already 
Great link. Thanks!
So sub-$2k coins are pretty unlikely in your opinion? 
Unless there's a way to cheat the troll box I don't know about..it was 19.3m IIRC.
Have to completely disagree with you about tight stops. In this volatile market you should never let yourself get hunted, especially if short. 
Cross margin always. 
well sure but that just means this market is illiquid and the general market sentiment may not feel the same way.

I'm not denying the price is $6800, I'm saying I don't know if everyone agrees that should be the price. The only reason we're at $6800 is because *one person* didn't mind buying there. 
No, i mean, the sea of tranquility is in the moon, is where apollo landed. 
Check again, shorts on suicide watch.
Many people did. You were probs still up 20x then, no?
Fuck, didn't realize I had to browse user comments to figure out if their posts were sarcastic!

;)
Don't need a crystal ball, just need to look at the daily charts and have moderate eyesight.

Seriously though, that feeling(mania) that many had back in December was unnatural and unsustainable and it will take several months/years to unwind the rise.
And you need to zoom out even further.
In two hours 
Yeah, not letting all their clients know via email was a pretty major oversight and yet another botched rollout of a new change/feature. Also consolidating across all markets, while great for simplifying things, does suck for traders like you who were more active on some markets than others.

The 0.25% to 0.30% hike does suck for Joe Crypto, but it's more fair to their clients overall. Before, you had two people paying the same price in fees for the same service/overhead per person, and one person might pay $10 a month while the other pays $100K. That didn't make any sense, especially given that the latter person is generally providing a lot of liquidity while the former is more or less inconsequential.

Also, I would have rather seen more tiers ($100K, $500K, $1M, etc.) with a more gradual step-down in fees. Right now very few people can take advantage of those discounts (by my rough estimation, probably only a couple dozen folks in the highest tier, and maybe 100-200 in the second tier).
You're right. We'll considering we've been flat, I just think the lower highs/higher highs thing is kind of a moot point considering we've been flat all day.
Well if you can do it 35 times you double your money
6k is the low of the year, that's why right now it's important. Do you actually know anything?

We also bounced mega hard of 6k last time, so of course it's important if it breaks. If you can't wrap you head around that then you shouldn't be trading 
He is choosing a dvd for tonight
at 600$ there was almost nobody support
Frankly, yes. Supply and demand. If demand is equal to supply then the price won't decrease (or increase for that matter).
Yes, rarity was a poor choice of words in describing how currency that is backed by nothing has value.
That company is never mentioned in the article. This is fake news.
No, this is wrong.

No mention of "Crypto sp. z.o.o"

C. != "Crypto sp. z.o.o"
I don't have confidence in a single scenario I'm looking out for. I think there's a number of equally likely ways this could develop, but really a sharp dump into a big bounce is one of the more improbable scenarios here, imo. 
At some point in the distant future.
I kind of think this market looks more like 2015 here, but what do I know. 
Unfortunately, I just started doing this recently. :(
or 8k?
That's a fair point but we should also take into percentages. If the price went down to 3k then everyone currently in the scene could buy twice as many bitcoins as they can right now. So, you're right in that it is only a guess, but my guess is that the buying pressure for the number of people in the scene is greater than 3k. Many people have indeed left the bitcoin scene but many more people have remained from last year.
Had tagged you a while back as "only trolly shitposting".

Checks out, good one! :)
I missed the sarcasm in the first post but now i get it. Whoosh
Nah we’re going to -$20,000 at least, most here don’t know that BTC can go negative if you spork the blockchain 
Do I make infinitely less or infinitely more money shorting when the price ticks from $1 to $0?
yeah that’s a meme bud
Just because something has been going on for weeks doesn't mean it will indefinitely. 

My point is not that it's unlikely to drop any further but rather anyone claiming it's a dead cert is talking rubbish
Enlighten your audience.
If we follow the tebsion pattern of our last stay at 8k, we'll break sometime on the next daily candle.  That one went down. 
Also, anyone who can't Google for online savings accounts that yield 1.5%should be taken with the utmost level of respect in maximizing capital gains. 
Cool story.  I’ll just post moon memes over at EthTrader and then when the next bull market comes I’ll get to say “I told you so.”
Ya, like predicting 2k 5 days before the eventual bottom? What a call.
I have no idea, just soon. A brief drop below 6k would provide the most fuel for a bounce and seems in line with how market makers have been operating for months now. It would trap bears and flip some of the remaining bulls. I have a hard time being bear now, when everyone i usually countertrade is bear and Tradingview is filled with retarded TA claiming 3xxx is imminent. 3k is probably happening at some point, but not before 10k+.
It really hasn't. There have been plenty of times where the 4h bottomed (and topped) out way longer than anyone expected. Trading on RSI alone will give you some really, really terrible entries if you trade on a strict overbought/oversold formula
I mean, the tard ones culled. For example. Now its time to open a short with tight stops, not fomoing in. When it gets a small pullback such at this one is when you open a long. 
[removed]
I think there's some serious accumulation happening by a small number of players at the moment. These players want people to fill up the order books with more sell liquidity so that they can scoop up coins at these "low" prices. They instantly reject anything to go below 6.4-6.5 area in the setup for the next FOMO pump.

/end of conspiracy theory
or “To the core”
You have TA to back up your rationale, or are you just parroting what other bears are saying..? 

I mean, you are a highly intelligent person whose taken the red pill. You must have all the right answers.

> I would estimate probably 105-112.   It takes a some degree of above average intelligence to reject the scietal programming and propaganda... and take that red pill to see things the way they are.  Of course it's not a pill that changes your thinking, but a long process of thought and reflection and analysis.


Nice post. Your post history is embarrassing. Not like you’re delusional or anything.. I’m delusional, but at least I can accept that lol. 
Didn't your post say "knocking" before? 
haha
Click on your own history, I'm not your mom.
> but it definitely influences spot markets through arbitration.

How? Sorry I'm a bit of a layman with futures and options contracts.
Not enough of my Sept long orders executed yet to make it worth it for me. I'm CA down at 6460 though lol. 
I'd add a stop loss at 6475 personally, but that sounds like a good trade and a good exit plan. Well done. 
Sold 33% at 6575 and layered the other two sells down to 6500. 
I'm pretty much at break even for the month of April so far, despite having 3 separate >40% stack positions at >20% ROE (on 5x leverage). That right there is a kick in the ass from our favorite deadly sin. 
I’m bias and long from 6500 but shorts being pretty much even with longs gives pause as well. This will be an interesting movement regardless. Regardless of the trend i think opening up a short here is more risky than a long. But in reality I truly believe it's a coinflip. 
[Word!](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8a6k3w/daily_discussion_friday_april_06_2018/dwwhd20/)
you be sure to send me a message when the end of the bear market/bottom is in! :P
I'll never forgive you for selling.

In all seriousness, I'm sorry you had to do that, but you are not alone. Another bullish indicator is that I believe much of the recent sell pressure likely has come from "need to sell" (your situation, taxes, etc) as opposed to "want to sell" (I think it's going lower, lost faith, etc)
I personally don't know a single casual investor that is in the red right now who intends to sell, even if we drop to $3K, $4K. also anecdotal, but an input.
I understand, so you're saying that people who intend to buy lower aren't necessarily expecting us to ever pass $6,600 again, they could just as easily be targeting, for example, an entry of $1K and an exit at $4K.
tbf he did say long term bullish
Yeah that last push down missed my next TP by like $15 :/

Since I was watching and at the controls, normally I would just hit market buy in the case that it looks like the price is about to fall short of my limit, but on MEX that could have caused huge upward slippage.
Check the OBV, it's been pretty solid for divergences that play out, I have liked using that more than RSI recently. 
Right, I admit to having never used a trading platform like that, just plain ol' exchanges. That is, tried margin trading a bit on Kraken the way you try pot in high school hiding behind the building, and eventually decided that I'd just get burnt if I got into it.

Anyway, TIL about negative maker fees.
This market manipulation is definitely orca-strated.
cant wait for Enron to boom again :')
No, I am out until the situation becomes clearer, I had some alts from the drop couple of days ago, and that profit almost melted. Now it's unclear where do we go, and I'll rather catch a bounce later and miss some profits than risk a wrong move now
Because he made the bulk of his fortune pummeling the pound sterling into the ground.  If he was able to do that with the national currency of a former global empire...I’m guessing he can do it to BTC.  
Oh, I agree. I don't mean to be flippant or dismissive. People are definitely manipulating the crypto mark8ets and I'm sure he sees an opportunity to do the the same. I just mean we already have boogeymen in the market when the price drops, so now we have another. And he has a history of being a tip tier boogeyman. I guess "boogeyman" is a bad term when he could actually be guilty of crypto market manipulation. Dude is rich, and it doesn't take much money to really screw with the cryptomarkets. 
Totally. It seems that the alt/ETH markets were a month delayed from BTC's....BTC December = Alt January, BTC January = Alt February (hence the ETH ratio doubling in January)....BTC February (local low) = Alt March (local low)

No way to know if this holds up, though, as a lot of alt holders are not true believers in BTC. I do think it will take a BTC recovery for them to recover at all, but I don't necessarily think there will be a delay when they do, and they could rise faster.
thanks for pointing that out
I don't disagree. I'm just saying it will take much longer in the case of ETH because there's so much stupid hype surrounding it. It won't go away within one bubble cycle. Just look at all the downvotes we're getting for even saying it's overvalued. What more proof do you need? :)
I suppose you did lol
Agreed, LTC under $100 and ETH under $300 feel like necessary adds, even though I'm not a big believer in alts. 
Hey, sacred planet. Watch the language.
What tells you this is a bottom?
The bull will always be unbroken in me :) ... until my long-term outlook changes

The world needs BTC imo, sooner or later people will realize it
I guess I'm just confused by the fact that there isn't much selling pressure here either though. Natural inclination as of late has been to short the shit out of btc.  It's not like there's huge volume and an epic battle going on here. Just, wait and see all around, I guess.

Edit: the bull is not broken in me either, I just expected a drop today
Doesnt make this a stop hunt, i think it was pretty clear the price was going to pop a decent bit after that flatline.

Edit: Doesnt look like "every other bart" now.
Sucks that I already wasted my trade for the year
Well it will go sideways until it doesn't, so we are trying to figure out what will happen when it doesn't.

As a general bull I am watching 6500 like a hawk. 30 day low thats been tested twice to no avail, the sell pressure really seems to have wained.

If you remember 11700 - 12300 ish the past months it was a very similar story (except were testing going up vs down). I do believe there was some news that propelled that reversal (Korea FUD I forget) but point being there is recent precedence for unexpected reversals. So don't dismiss the idea of it actually not falling bellow 5800 again (for now).

My intuition is also telling me this is a buy here. Of course proper FUD would prob shatter the support also.
that sucks bro but nobody can ever guarantee you it won't go back up
You may have shorted at oversold RSI while often lead to bounce.
yeah, it would. it would also be the dumb "maximum pain" meme everyone talks about. But like...legit maximum pain. 

and it would provide the despair fuel necessary to break through $6k with ease

ironic
Bad bot
downvote
I actually have no idea. He's a scumbag through and through though, so wouldn't be too surprised if he did!
> Honestly, I don’t think we’re far from finding the bottom.

I agree. We are no more than $7000 or so away from the worst possible bottom.
a percentage of the total amount traded by US citizens? considering every trade is a profit for somebody.
Ya he is not a big fan of nation states either. Look what he did to the Pound after Brexit.  So it seems taking the control of money away from the state is one way to facilitate their decline.
looking at the inverse chart I don't see how we're _not_ going sub 5k. 3k is a decent target imo
people have been calling for 3-5k for weeks now, tbh i dont think itll happen but the first quarter has definitely been bearish to say the least XD
if we bounce from 5.8-5.9, maybe we can get to 6.5-6.8. i think too many people will be looking to reshort
Sorry, i really dont know how to explain the obvious, it is really not complicated.
>What do you think about a Bitmex-esque platform for stocks? So it would allow users to collect fees by setting limit orders; those who utilise market orders will pay the fees.

Bitmex is a futures platform. We already have that for indexes, but wouldn't make much sense for something that's only traded 35 hours per week. 
>Would you push it further up from here? :)

LOL, I usually suppress the price more than move it. Large limit orders, rarely market. You'll want to ask aabtc. 
Got it thanks. So usually if funding is shorts paying longs immediately after the funding will the price go up or downwards? I'm assuming downwards because bots will immediately start closing those Long positions after receiving the funding. I just don't want to lose more profit on my open short by paying for funding again. I believe I've already lost quite the amount to funding on open positions 
True I pulled that number out of my ass without looking at a chart

edit: I'd put upper likely limit on ~7800, where a reliable log resistance line would approximately be

Ah thanks for explaining!
**U t i l i t a r i a n i s m** 
And discussing it is why we are here after all.  
Exactly, i don't see us moving down drastically before going up
Yup too tight but I'm skittish about this price action
You might be right, but I really hope you are not. I dont know how much more suffering i can take. Only reason im still holding on is I almost sold all my ETH when it was stuck at $300 from Sept to Nov and felt like I have for the past month or so, and a couple days later it jumps to $450.
lolo I hope you're joking because I am anything but!
Sloppy is a perma bull? Lmao
% ath, around this time they were at our $7.5k
I really don't know anymore. If we get rejected from another large pump again then yes, it will definitely fall through. Right now? Idk tbh. these doomboiz really need to put the sell pressure on or it aint gone fall through
I mean that's mainly what I'm "worried" about. I think someone's accumulating and planning on pumping it a la 2014 style back to $8-10k or something. 

The charts are also suggesting a possible double bottom/wyckoff style accumulation phase.

Idk, I need to look into it more. I'm just surprised it hasn't fallen through already, really.

I have overthought things before, just want to make sure I'm checkin myself before wreckin myself is all
Why is that amazing? Its a valid question why has the dumping stopped here? 
So you're saying this is the bottom? What are you saying here? That the market has already fallen a lot therefore the question "why isn't it dumping" is dumb because you have reframed the question in your head to be "why hasn't the market dumped since December 2017?" which is obviously a dumb question.

The question being asked is: "Why isn't the market now dumping heavily, right now, even further, etc?"

Answers to this question could be "Oh, it will!" or "We have found long term support" or "It's an optical illusion" or "wait five minutes" or "Because muh triangles."

Saying something like *I can't believe you think the market hasn't plunged* isn't a useful answer.
Maybe we are saying the same thing, I was suggesting bear position looks weak here because the selling certainly has tapered off significantly as of late.
anyone who practiced an instrument in 6th grade is literally insane
Charlie?
His post, my post, and your post have equal levels of insight.
I mean, there's a reason I'm bearish rather than a skeptic as far as flair is concerned - I am optimistic for Bitcoin's future, but its value won't just increase because we think it should do.
Well then. People need to stop shorting the bottom.
Then it does, because I'm looking at 2014, where it behaved exactly this way.
The massive downvoting of everything one disagrees with is pretty annoying. Shows most people on this sub are immature and not open to discussion.
It's true that without the recent 6k touching it wouldn't be notable (because, well, it wouldn't exist) and is what makes it compelling to me, and that last week also bounced along the same line. So it does inherently work as a medium-term support line as well.

But I would argue that these older touches are still very relevant. These indicate the lowest buy-in levels of people within the last 6 months and where v-shaped drops ended. And these were all within a 6 month period--I know it's BTC but that's not eons. The same time frame that encompasses a 200 day moving average. Many TA folks would say the length of time this support line covers gives it more credence, not less, insofar that it has the potential to affect our trades on shorter timeframes.
XMR/BTC has actually had a pretty low correlation to BTC/USD and XMR/USD recently, which is a pretty strong sign. Historically we'd expect the ratio to fall as BTC/USD dips.
How do arbitrage bots work?  Doesn't it take time to transfer BTC from one exchange to another?
I'm thinking that's how we know we're in full bulltard mode again...when the noob-friendly onramp has good volume again, or even a premium (in the West anyway)
Do you think the volume moved away from GDAX for tax purposes? Seems like it would be easier to hide that stuff on Finex with a VPN, etc.
yea the attempt to break 6,5 failed for now i wonder if there will be a second one
we hope it will do in reverse. this market is getting boring right now
I usually start moving my stop loss to lock profits instead of taking profits along the way if i have time to check the charts, but not always is possible. Depends on the market also, if there is a chance of a longer run i might let it run, but for scalping i don't risk it
Which exchange?
Yeah, staggered orders make me think people actually want to buy at those levels rather than just trying to prop the market up.
I haven't really tried, I only really use this account for crypto stuff, trying to remain somewhat anonymous. Its tradingview links I created 
Just in case what? A delirious orange bi-polar guy decides to fuck up a possible peace agreement? 

No way that can happen!

Oh wait... 
Are you sure about that? Because I am 99.81277% sure that SloppySynapses is not a bot.

Oh I know it's indicators and it's been sell but not strong sell until yesterday, I love using it as an extra contrarian indicator. 
It is if you're long-term bullish. You have to actually do the math on it though, and determine your timeline for expected market exit.
Haha fair point! I guess I see that best case but don't find it compelling enough to trade it.
because he really just wanted to talk more about his side
Ah weird.
Count to 3, I'll go on 2, you all go on 3
00:00 utc
you mean like $120?
We wouldnt because a lot of it is spoofing, and a lot of it is hidden walls or market sells if above X . Plus all the arbitrage bots. 


Possibly :)
I went to sleep...
Actually I'm still into profit since my short was opened at 7002 CA, but it seems with my position of 2 BTC the last 2 days has incurred me fees of about $100 or more? Is that possible? 
Either you are a troll or a very bad trader.
Gotcha. Swooshed right over me
Mined a few for fun when at 7 bucks. Bought some at 80. Cashed out a bit at thousand. When it got back to 200 I thought it would never go back up lol. 6K or 7K still a lot to me.
well, it's mentioned as "C." on:

While checking the connections of this company, investigators came across another company - C. At its head stood a man with citizenship of Colombia and Panama. This company was associated with a large online cantor exchange of cryptocurrencies.


But yeah, I'd wait for a confirmation, and anyway they most likely just seized the cartels money, it shouldn't affect bitfinex at all.

New ATH months or years away? In your opinion..?
It's the ultimate "maximum pain" move of Bitcoin, where your 100x leverage short with a cost average of $5900 goes from being worth $389,000,000 to $0. 

Pigs get slaughtered, mon. Greedy, greedy piggies. 
No one is saying indefinitely. But there is absolutely no sign of a reversal anytime soon, whichever time frame you're looking at.
Down. My guess is a bottom in a few months between 2 and 4K.
Oh, those are gone I think. Or will be soon.

If the price on futures is significantly higher than on the spot markets, someone can sell the future and buy on spot and lock in the difference as guaranteed profit.  Because of this you can be sure that one will affect the other.  Also, some of the major market makers for the futures products will definitely maintain large spot positions as well to have appropriate exposure when the futures markets are closed.
I'm CA 6750.  The position is small but its enough that not taking half of it above 7k would be wasteful.  *At the moment*, I am glad I started to add to it at 7.1k.
I don't use multiples of 5 for stop losses, don't ask me why!
still leaving those buy orders there ? this weird ascending triangle is making me uneasy so i closed at 6580, not confident enough to go into a long though
I'm at a tiny loss.  If I close my short here and now, then I am BE since my last block of trade tracking since March 30th.
I got tired of that so every time i get above 1% i'll start moving my stop loss. Every 100$ move i adjust my stop loss. I might get hunted, but at least i don't lose all the profits.
2 months ago i started in Kraken and lost 200$ of my 650$ stack... Almost gave up. Slowly been getting better (or luckier...) and i'm at 865$ now. Trying to get to 1000$ to cashout 350$ (half my investment) and try to repeat untill i get all the investment out.
Then i can play with profits .
Haha isn't that the million dollar question, personally, I'll know the bottom is in when we go sideways for a few weeks/months.

I don't think there is enough FOMO fuel to have us making any major upside moves anytime soon
We'll see. I do think most people that are selling under $10K are intending to buy back lower (and many of them already have). However, there is an entire subset of holders in the <$6K cost average range that haven't been threatened in 8 months. We could see a new wave of selling if $6K falls, and that's the biggest concern I have. I also haven't heard a compelling argument as to *why* the trend should reverse that isn't predicated on "because it will probably be worth more later." That's a legitimate reason, but it shouldn't be the primary reason. 
Not super experienced with OBV but I'm not seeing a bullish div on the daily OBV - it hasn't been rising at all and in fact is currently at its all time low since the ATH in price. Isn't OBV bullish div when price makes is decreasing but OBV is increasing? I'm not seeing that.
Alright I hear you, it's understandable.   Did you see [this](https://twitter.com/bbands/status/981935959242555392?s=19)? Not that he's the Messiah or that's a sure thing but he is the guy that created Bollinger Bands which gives him some pretty good credit, I'm curious what he's seeing. 
Dentacoin and ico founders can still fakely pump the price of their shitcoin, it only goes to 0 when their is bad news.

ETH has so many players that it can dump faster, pre eth ico got their eth at 0.20$ they are still in profits.

I love shit talking ETH here, its my eth fanboy meter. -2 is not a lot I used to get at least -10 lol
Basically if it stops moving at all people assume it's going to break up, not down. I'm personally questioning that assumption 
[deleted]
You realize a stop hunt is always a pop, right? that's the point
Good call
and it would give you two disgustingly beautiful short entries for the price of 1
You're definitely not the first one to think that's clever.
You from T_D? Or do normal people hate soros as well? lmao
Is it worth trashing someone's reputation if you're not even sure what they did? Soros has been involved with some very good philanthropic efforts, but hey why would you care if he gives $18 billion away? 
I don't think this would necessarily accurately gauge it though. If say 70% of people in 2017 only bought and never sold, and only 30% of people who bought crypto sold/traded at some point last year, there could be a ton of paper profits but only a relatively small amount of tax liabilities

Maybe I'm missing something but it seems it would be difficult to estimate. 

Maybe Tom Lee has access to several exchanges' data, that seems to be the only accurate way to estimate which users sold for how much profit.
Good point. In theory crypto would be a great tool to get one over on governments, and also a step closer to his "borderless world" idea.


Bitmex is a futures platform, but the same thing is available for the derivatives such as XBTUSD (XBTM18 etc are futures but XBTUSD isnt).

We already have that for indexes? Is there a broker that would let me buy SP500 with limit orders and give me a fees for doing so?
Funding strongly negative -> dump on funding, funding strongly positive -> pump on funding. But you don't have to trust my word for it, Bitmex has historical funding rates on their website, which you can cross-check with the 1 minute charts. Also, the impact is minimal if the funding is small - 0.1% is my rule of thumb, but anything above 0.3% *will* result in a significant price movement. It is best exploited on *other* exchanges than bitmex, since they usually follow if funding is large enough.
Could also look for a TD combo which kind of let's you count some of the setup candles in the countdown with a couple extra rules. Not going to go through figuring out where we're at on that though.
I too am somewhat underwater (bought in at 13400), though I've been able to accumulate enough during the bear trend since the drop from 11800 to make up for it when we recover (and I truly believe we will). I've learned a lot since joining this crypto thing. It's been the most wonderful, terrifying trading experience that I've ever seen. 

That said, I never bought more than I was willing to lose completely, and I'm looking forward to continuing to accumulate BTC until everyone else in the world realizes what they're missing out on.
Yeah was a joke ofc
[deleted]
Because anyone paying attention has already sold?
I would suspect we need to see some crypto has failed completely and bitcoin is dead posts before we reach the bottom.

It is building but I dont think we are quite there yet.
No I get it, it's so so clever. I was really impressed with how clever it was, I think it made the point you were trying to make really strongly and not at all condescendingly, and you totally didn't come off looking like a petty little shit.
Someone has to if the price is going down 
Not really, we've been dropping much faster than in 2014. I mean I can see the similarities, but 2014 was even choppier with more bounces. A bounce to 11k at this point is highly unlikely.
It gets like this after bubbles. I almost rage quit every time before mods remind me that I just need to down vote and report. Hang in there.
> These indicate the lowest buy-in levels of people within the last 6 months

This is faulty thinking. The amount of bitcoin traded at these points and the amount of that same bitcoin then being traded as it crosses this point is completely negligible. It makes no difference. And length of time does not give the arbitrary points any extra relevance. The points are so arbitrary they cannot possibly give anything to the TA, unless larger market actors pay heed to them, which I assure you, they do not. 



I haven't researched it. I would think they would have both fiat and BTC on both exchanges. See gdax is higher than bfx? Sell a bit on gdax, buy a bit on bfx. See bfx higher than gdax? Do the inverse, all while keeping a programmatic ledger internally in the bot. I'm sure that's oversimplifying things.
arbitrage bots don't necessarily transfer from one exchange to another, but can also make trades based on the price differences on exchanges that already have fiat or coins.
I think people just got bored of BTC and left, honestly. Margin trading is the new thing and GDAX doesn't have that. Also, the GDAX volume dropped off a cliff 3 days after BCH was added, so that was part of it
My thinking as well. Lets hope. 
That's really strange. 
idiot
To be fair I really think we will reach something like 5.8k, but rn there are too many shorts opened and too high an expectation of a swift crash to my liking. I think a retrace is due, we'll see.
I'm actually a sad bull. Had a big leveraged trade yesterday I was hopeful for but closed it with tiny profit because the trend just isn't there atm.

Ofc I suck quite badly at trading so maybe my timing was off by a day and we get a nice spike this weekend. This would please me even if I'm not in on it.
Sure thing. I'm in for 264 BTC.
Ah yeah, looks like I meant 140, misread the grouping in the orderbook.
Yes on a 2BTC position the fees are close to 20$ per 8hours. 
Yah I brag about my underwater trades for attention. They don't actually happen. 
6k is still half way to moon
I'm not sure that's being translated well, and it certainly doesn't point straight at bitfinex or "Crypto sp. z.o.o". This rings of a hoax.
This is an absolutely insane thing to speculate on. It doesn't matter how many coincidences you find, they are still coincidences. A coincidence isn't evidence, so why even talk about it?  Combine that with the hyperbolic headline and you've got a strong candidate for fake news.

If this were remotely accurate you'd have the AP all over it in seconds.
If ~$6500 levels hold, I would say months. If we have a quick, low-volume dip to low $6000s and back up, maybe even weeks. If price goes below to like < $6200 and actually stays below $6400 for more than a day or two afterwards, probably won't see new ATH until 2020. 

Lots of variables though, imo any long-term positions should be looking to hold until next halving meanwhile short term trading is king. 
Gah, BTC is the *worst*
> We all know where this is going

My problem is with the word 'know'. That is all
[removed]
> The chart says all, and it says it obviously.

Very logical. Your IQ is too much for me. 

> Your pathetic ad hominem attack is not going to change the chart.

*Your pathetic, ad hominem attack is not going to change the chart.*&lt;— FTFY. 

> And looks like the price is being pumped higher, which is what I said was one of the obvious possibities above.  

You basically said the price could go up or down. I can say with 100% certainty that one of those options will always be a possibility. Bravo on connecting the dots. 

> possibities

Also, it’s spelled *possibilities*. A for effort. 
Sorry I don't understand. Let me get this straight. So if the Bitcoin futures price is well over spot, I can sell a futures contract and buy on spot(at any exchange) to automatically make a profit? Is that like shorting a stock? I borrow someone else's stock, sell it at a high price, buy it back at a low price(from myself in the futures scenario), then give it back? 

If the market makers have spot positions, do they need it to satisfy delivery if someone buys a long futures contract?
Then I'd fudge down to your odd number of choice haha $6472.87 sounds good
One more triggered at 6560 so I only have 33% of the position left. I have a buy to flip it down at 6525. I might just exit. I'm going to be traveling and then sleeping for 18 of the next 24 hours, and being completely out of position may be my best play. I certainly wouldn't want to be long with any weight.
You can set a trailing stop, too, which I've used with some success. Works best once you're comfortably in profit, though. 
I hear you, but the fact that everyone is expecting that sideways movement leads me to believe it may not happen.
Sounds like you don't understand divergence, it's the same on all indicators, RSI OBV it doesn't matter [this is what I'm seeing](http://www.forextips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/regular-bullish-divergence.png), it's a regular [bullish divergence](https://snag.gy/UFVf6e.jpg). 
just so you know he also suggested a w bottom at like $9-11k or so. Very big wrong call 
Pumps only work if there are enough fools to fomo into it. As long as dentacoin pumps still work, we're not done correcting yet. That's my whole point.
You're definitely right...I just remember green dildos and "you don't short btc" memes being the norm too, until it wasn't

Edit: "you're" because I'm anal about that
volume is one of the best indicators for if a movement is more legit or not
lol that's if I closed here and longed or hedged until then. *and* only if my theory/prediction is right. 
bad bot
T_D being the reddit's Donald Trump fanclub? No, not at all. I thought it was pretty normal to hate Soros. :(
His 'philanthropic efforts' are at least partially responsible for a bunch of revolutions and humanitarian crises around the globe, he's also at least partially responsible for the Asian financial crisis and a number of smaller 'emergency' situations in various markets.

The fact that he 'donated' $18 billion (even ignoring the fact that a lot, if not all, of that money goes towards manipulating the world towards his own designs) is of little import to me, considering the wealth he has amassed and the means he's used to amass it. 
This doesn't answer your question, but its information. 

"The projected tax liability is based on taxable gains for crypto of $92 billion"

"Fundstrat also said crypto exchanges posted record profit in November and December and are expected to have huge tax liabilities, which should add to further selling in crypto-currencies. Many of the exchanges have net income exceeding $1 billion in 2017 and keep their working capital in bitcoin and ether, the research firm added."

>We already have that for indexes? Is there a broker that would let me buy SP500 with limit orders and give me a fees for doing so?

Yep. I receive a small credit as a maker for ESM8.

Bitmex offers this to everyone in order to add liquidity to their order books. Doesn't quite work the same with stocks as you aren't trading on your brokers internal order book. In that case, it sounds like you're thinking or CFDs? 
Would there not be a pump beforehand if funding is strongly negative though? All the bots opening longs to scalp fees should theoretically cause a pump, no? 
Yeah, anyway, whatever that says, I wouldn't rely on it to open a new trade right now, this situation is a pure gamble IMO!
Alarms are terrible. and have never really proven worth it to me. If I really need to close, I'll set a stop. Otherwise I've been fine sitting through pumps so far. I don't know if I can live like chewy trying to trade at 4 am waking up in the middle of the night
k so then why is everyone claiming 4k or 5k inbound? 
Haha, so true. Though I've been seeing "there will never be another ATH" posts every now and then since at least $10K...
Wow, let it go brother.
I think it's very probable we'll hit 10k by June. We'll see.
>The amount of bitcoin traded at these points and the amount of that same bitcoin then being traded as it crosses this point is completely negligible.

Fair.

> And length of time does not give the arbitrary points any extra relevance.

Sorry, can't agree. You can repeat "arbitrary" but this is begging the question unless you can explain why they're arbitrary, or provide a source explaining why points that touch support within 6 months are irrelevant for looking at a long term trend.
Wow that really sucks. Just wondering have you ever successfully/unsuccessfully done a 25-50x leverage trade when we have been trading flat for awhile, meaning price just keeps fluctuating about $100 or so with consistency, which is what has been happening the past few days before a pump or dump. Basically plan is to long at the bottom of this mini channel or short at the Top of mini channel, and close once we move $10-$30 up/down. Should be rather profitable due to the leverage used, and safe to a certain extent if the pattern has been repeating itself 5-6 times already 
Interesting and agreed.
On kraken i don't have that possibility, at least never seen it or don't know how to use it
Or maybe we've started?
I very much understand divergence. I'm not seeing that at all on OBV and again, I can't look at your chart - snaggy is blocked at my workplace. Use imgur.

From stockcharts: "A bullish divergence forms when OBV moves higher or forms a higher low even as prices move lower or forge a lower low. A bearish divergence forms when OBV moves lower or forms a lower low even as prices move higher or forge a higher high."

I'm not seeing OBV moving higher at all. OBV on the daily is actually at a low.
Alright, I didn't see that.

I know it was in jest :P
I think it is, I just have mainly only heard of hate for him from the alt right. 

I believe it's fairly normal to think he's a scumbag though. I just got my initial impression of Soros hate from T_D
Are you Hungarian or Russian? What revolutions do you mean? Do you support free markets?
yes im thinking CFDs but you just said ESM8 does it so why doesnt it work with the same with stocks?
Yes, but the start of this pump before it is usually hard to predict. However, at large funding rates, taking the opposite position a couple hours before and then closing *before* the funding actually happens sometimes works.

But test it out yourself, don't listen to strangers on the internet ;)
Very true haha. These 15 min BBands are really fucking with my mind.
[deleted]
All I can say is common sense. A big strength of TA is that others look for support/resistance in a similar way. When you're taking these far off points, a lot of people won't see that stuff or won't include it. You have to use what others are using to see where to sell and where to buy. A point at $4900 that nobody is using is arbitrary. 
haha entirely possible bro, would be a very positive outcome imo
agreed. Genghis must be using a different/special OBV, because there is no divergence on the standard OBV. it's going down with price on the daily.
https://imgur.com/Tr6wxEe
guy is clearly smart but he's just suggesting is all. big difference than actually longing. 

and tbf this is the most unsure I've been in my short since opening it. 
Word
hah. I'm very strongly considering closing. I may do what chew did and open a long here on sep futs and just close whichever way it breaks.
I mean, you really don't have to look far to find out about his involvement in various regime and policy changes... 

My own political views have nothing to do with it. I just find it despicable how a billionaire who made most of his wealth from currency manipulation and crashing markets gets credit for being a 'philanthropist' while going around funding revolutions and counter-establishment movements around the world. 
>yes im thinking CFDs but you just said ESM8 does it so why doesnt it work with the same with stocks?

It does, but market maker rebates aren't available for everyone as they are on Bitmex. You can register to become a MM with NYSE ARCA, for example. You can also be hired by penny stock companies as their DMM. 
I just really hate waking up to that sound of losing money. It's truly awful
I see where you're coming from.  More recent, emotional and obvious support lines like at round numbers I would give extra weight because they attract the herd and more traders' attention.


But we know there are subconscious psychological factors at play within TA that don't appear to be common sense to the average Joe, or something they would trade on--why does a rising wedge fall but an ascending triangle rise despite looking very similar? etc.--and TA isn't meant or able to contain only a chart of people who use TA. Now granted, a lot more people in crypto seem to be using TA, especially whales. (standard TA caveat that all it can give you is a best guess in confluence with other factors and the unknown unkowns always in play)

Generally speaking, I think that this support line represents a price zone where buyers intuitively considered it an excellent deal, and now that appears weakening.
What OBV oscillator / period settings are you using? I'm using the standard tradingview one and it's currently at the lowest it's been since the ATH: https://imgur.com/a/WrgMn

In fact, the earlier one on your chart isn't there on the standard trading view one either.

And regardless, I disagree that the most recent one on your chart is valid just yet. If over the next 72 hours or so we drop further on high volume the divergence would be erased as OBV would fall well below where your line begins.
Okay, so what prevents a company to make CFD trading for stocks which allows you to collect fees if you set limit orders?

>Okay, so what prevents a company to make CFD trading for stocks which allows you to collect fees if you set limit orders?

No idea, I'm not a lawyer or regulator. I'd suggest consulting with one if you feel like you can attract sufficient trust and action. You may have the makings of a great startup.
Interesting. Correction on my part - normal OBV doesn't have a period setting at all.

Your indicator is slightly different than normal OBV in that its value is the current volume (positive or negative) - the EMA of the volume over 20 periods. Normal OBV is essentially a running tally - just add or subtract the volume from the previous value.

The normal OBV indicator isn't yet showing divergence, Lazy Bear's oscillator version is. Not sure what value to place on that but I stand by my opinion that it's way too early to call it since we're still in a local downtrend on the daily.
RobinHood is a broker in the US that charges no commision per trade. They make money by the interest they gain off of users' unutilised funds. Many people think they wouldn't be able to gain enough revenue to offset their operating costs. If this is the case then I think they would benefit from a bitmex type model.

You mentioned that since the stock market isn't up and running 24/7 it wouldn't be worth to pursue a bitmex type model for a CFD broker. Why is that? Im not pursuing a bitmex type model to add liquidity; I'm pursuing it to attract customers.
In your opinion, is a bitmex type model (which allows maker fees to be earned by users using limit orders) an unprofitable one when applied to the stock market (can be implemented in SPY futures or CFDs) 
Yes ok thanks, glad we're on the same page now guess I should have made it clear and looked at regular OBV, I thought I was going crazy lol.    I like the OSC for catching things, learned about that from a couple of my favorite traders and it seems to catch divergences I don't see otherwise, of course it's not full proof but it has worked out fairly well for me, I agree still to early to call just something I'm watching.
