Being in position here feels like standing in front of a door on a Japanese game show.  I don't know if I'm about to get a new car or kicked in the nuts by a donkey.
Point and Figure https://i.imgur.com/3IDlia3.png  We have confirmed a column of 5 O's.  Our last column of X's was a long column of 22 X's.  A 50% retrace of this column would put under 7399 and now that our O column has confirmed this is more likely to happen before we can continue upward.

Let's look back at our chart drawings from 4 days ago https://www.tradingview.com/x/vDDIAO6U/  Both the smaller kumo break out and the larger higher high break out played out very nicely.  A strong move up without very little retracement or throwbacks to previous highs.  Reaching 8100 without much retracement is fairly impressive, but we are now at a minor 62% fib level, a weekly level, and we have had recent 2-4 hour bear divs.  A retrace to at least 7000-7400 (25%-38% fib, 4 hour cloud, wyckoff throwback, volume node) is highly likely here.

The higher timeframe bull break out is at 9.9k-10k (confirmation of long term downward trend break, higher high, break of 62% fib from local high to local low).  As we approach 8.8k-9.9k (volume node, long term downward trend, major weekly level), we will see more and more shorts open as the risk reward increases on short position.

Pretty uneventful weekend https://www.tradingview.com/x/tNnzONWq/  This chart is of my 'weekend line' indicator which shows a purple line starting at the US stock market close on friday and ending on US stock market open on monday.  This line can act as support or resistance but most of all it is a price magnet with the price often touching down on it around the end of the weekend.  In other words, most weekends go sideways.  But looking back through the history there has been very few weekends that are so uneventful as this one.  No, I don't think we discovered the true price of bitcoin©.   I was thinking when we drift sideways along the weekend line often we'll end up with a big move sunday afternoon that does not retrace back to the weekend line.  This is mostly gut feeling of impending excitement, enough that I thought it is worth mentioning.

The Weekend Line indicator mentioned above: https://www.tradingview.com/script/LJxwr2ZL-Line-from-Start-of-Friday-to-End-of-Sunday-v1/
You guys are going to give me an aneurysm with all the same tired talking points...to hear some people tell it, it's *all* whales, bots, exchanges, and pump and dump groups.

Guys, it's *traders*. Who sometimes react to each other in quick succession when they feel strong FOMO or fear. Occasionally set off by a whale who thinks he can benefit by absorbing available liquidity before the rest of the market moves that way anyway. *That's it*.
Advanced TA says we seem to be climbing a mountain over the dungeon of capitulation.  https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/ClyXqInO-The-One-Coin-to-Rule-Them-All-Chapter-I/

Targeting 9k based on that mountain.

Edit: incidentally, my TP ladder for this long tops out at 9.1k.
Some bears around here forgetting that BTC dumping isn't always organic either, look at both sides.
I am loving my tipsy long from 7950 last night. Let's ride!

2013 bubble:

https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Da1NHlSVQAAsoBZ.jpg

----

After the 2013 bubble, it took 405 days for Bitcoin to completely reverse 1 month of bullish momentum (621% gain from Oct '13->Nov '13). 

On this bubble we already reversed 1 month of gains prior to the 2017 peak in 55 days. 


We are moving a lot faster compared to the last bear market, and that should be obvious from how fast and brutal the Feb 2018 dump was. But to be fair, the post-2013 bear market took us all the way back to ~$200 which was the prior ATH, which I think is the ultimate bottom of a bear market. But shit was scary back then, most people weren't even sure if bitcoin would survive (I was of course, heh, but most people weren't). Now it's more like "lets just get the bear market over with and go to 100K already"... dropping back to prior ATH ($1200) would be a 95% decline.... and honestly I don't think bitcoin deserves that at this stage. There are too many confident buyers who would buy it up before it gets there. 


There are still a lot of people skeptical about this being the bottom, I like [this guy's chart](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/Yp45tiB5-Scary-BITCOIN-Comparison-2014-and-2018-You-Won-t-Believe-it/) ...and I was also pretty certain we were heading to $4K, but now I'm not sure. Either way, we're close to being done with the bear market, and at times like this (unsure about the next few weeks, confident about the next few months) my priority is to acquire/hold as much bitcoin as possible. ATH this year is highly likely imo, and that aligns with how long it takes for the average bitcoin bubble to burst and recover: https://i.imgur.com/sP8b91A.png

---

There is also a chance that this could end up as a re-set and continuation of the year long rally: https://i.imgur.com/ZiM19RB.png ...if that happens we're gonna see some crazy shit this year.

Don’t think I’ve seen the sentiment so bad in here, even though the price is going up! 

Is that not supposed to be a good sign?
And there I was saying I was going to turn off my mining rigs at 6k.


What's bizarre is the lack of retrace before making higher highs, making both longing and shorting uncomfortable. 

Honestly thinking of employing both positions with SL at 8200 and 8500 and riding the candle. 
Wicks on 'finex are now consistently longer than 'mex, so I'm moving my charting for now. The 12h is at a critical juncture with the new candle having moved sideways to the upside of the cloud. The chikou is however sitting right underneath the kumo. If there's a move to the downside now, it'll be interesting to see where support is and particularly if it's the first lead span (average of highs/lows from last 13 days), which is just under 8.2k for the coming few days.

12: https://www.tradingview.com/x/4PdcCYm5

Target on the daily is still valid and a weak bullish cross still forming. There's kijun support now and the 9.1k previous local high [that I have marked] would seem like a possible final resistance, given how closely it coincides with the kumo top. But I'd imagine the sell orders at 9k or even below will be too thick, unless of course another wild 1/4 billion emerges.

Hope that guy who was cursing Chewy for convincing him to open a short didn't close his short
This dump really is the best-case scenario for bulls. Healthy retracement was desperately needed after that run-up the past four days if we want to have any hope of breaking through the ATH log trend in a few days. 

Don't be surprised if this pulls back even further to the 7600-7800 range before we head up again. Ideally, we establish a lower high while maintaining a higher low over the next two days. This should give us the "ammunition" from a TA standpoint to push to greater heights when it matters.
doesn't feel right, closed my short at break even. Was expecting some bigger downtrend here. Now it's time to wait for log resistance.  All attempts to push down price on 15m results in wicks to the downside and then resuming price 

edit: added a stop limit to the upside at 8350 on bitmex, will see if this rides to 8500 other wise just clsoe it
Believe it or not, that only took us to the bottom of the channel formed the last few days. Good time for a long, or beginning of a larger dump?
[BB daily looking interesting](https://www.tradingview.com/x/4RW1atvm/), we'll see what happens.
Anybody see this shit on OKEx? 

https://imgur.com/GfS1gGQ

Can somebody please explain *negative* margin in this context?

Edit:

Also of note... none of the T10 has added to their position in the past 2 days... https://imgur.com/a/ckf6r
It was a bart. It appears to be coming back now but they got me. I am out, my long from 6960 closed at 8140. I'm on the sidelines now for at least overnight.

FWIW, the Bitfinex volume of the big green candle on the morning of 4/15 (US time) on the ~~30-min~~ 15-min chart was 5.1K, and the volume of this big red candle was 4.925K. Including the wick, the BRD was a bigger move for the volume than the BGD.

edit: sorry, 15 minute, not 30 minute.
Again failed to pierce the daily BBand (for now).
Bull pennant broke up but we are still in the ascending channel : https://www.tradingview.com/x/Bf8KkFsW/

Looking very good right now.
My strategy now is to keep moving the stop loss up with about $100 diff vs high. 
Yesterday I called a break out of the triangle between 7 and 9am EST and here we are. The direction wasn't obvious but it looks like a whale picked it for us. It's a bit silly how precisely this fit inside the triangle, no?

https://www.tradingview.com/x/MpbVcYSQ

Anyway, I thought we would break down. Was short from 8090, had sell orders at 8200, 8300 and 8400. Now I'm short overall form 8200. A bit surprised we're maintaining over 8.3 but I'm watching this carefully. Might bail past 8.5 - could use some advice here. Starting to worry I've misunderstood/underestimated the relationship between the whales and the bulls. If this is going to be a repeat of the February rise from 6.5-11.5k then I need to reorient my mindset now before I lose more and I'm thinking this is probably the crucial moment that'll tell whether we have the momentum to explore 8.5-9k right now. 
going to start scaling into a short hedge from 8400+

Fully hedged by 9200 (EDIT: 8500, my bad)

Stops just above the resistance line, say 200-300 bucks above.

Good luck gents

2k market sell on finex
Short $1.2mm at $8388. May add to this. Stops at 5%. No volume between sudden pumps, longs increasing accordingly. Seems manipulated, expecting a sudden drop. 
[Rising wedge](https://i.gyazo.com/1fdb78808f9a6cf243e007c245548971.png)

This is how I am seeing it. We only retraced to .236 which is an incredibly bullish sign. Almost hard to believe. Move for log resist line and maybe a rejection followed by a retest.
Log downtrend line is really close now, we can even break it with one good pump. Currently on mobile can't post TA.
broke out of daily bbands, bear div on the 1,2 and 4h still ongoing, top of the ascending channel, we're in for a retrace i think but will the 8200 support turned resistance confirm as support again?
Tipsy long stopped.  As a complete novice I'll not get too greedy. 

I literally have no idea what to do right now.

I'm all in fiat but wondering whether to buy some now or see if the almighty descending trendline is broken?
8.5 is a big level, so we're either going to start getting more bullish confirmation or bearish continuation right here.  new weekly will be interesting 
Technically speaking, if we break 9.2k we are out of the bear market and onto the next “ Bull Market”. From a technical stand point yes it makes sense because we have broke the resistance line from the ATH, but to your regular investors no.

The average person doesn’t know anything about bitcoin T.A, resistance lines, support lines, log lines, etc. So why would the 9.2k price attract new investors? They see the price of 9.2k and all they see is Bitcoin under the 10k mark which is a “ Mental barrier “ and that it’s roughly half of its ATH. In my opinion, I think if we break 9.2k we aren’t going to “ moon “.  
What just happened?
"Someone" keeps showing us the way. Hope the volume will return.
Closed my long with P6%. Gonna go and relax for some time before I come back. Happy trading guys!
[deleted]
On my chart (gdax), I show we are currently "right at" the ATH log resistance line drawn from the 17.2k peak, when **not adjusted** for the 11.7k peak that peaked just above the log line.

The ATH log resistance line adjusted for 11.7k is still above us.
It is close to 300 usd cheaper to buy BTC from Bithumb now? From premium to a big drastic difference. 
Top of the downward channel action (a.k.a. "the next <time period> is critical for Bitcoin")?
https://www.tradingview.com/x/KOuGsyy0/
Market seems to have absorbed the sell pretty well.   I think we will trickle back up on low volume. 
I've read a few comments about LN's effect on the price when BTC are basically "stuck" in channels, not on the market to be bought or sold.

What effect would this have in all reality? Can someone more knowledgeable explain to me the potential ramifications of this?

For example, this comment:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8c6ny3/lightning_network_has_over_12_btc_15k_nodes_and/dxck4gz/

says:

> $20 per channel

>So if we get to 100m channels there will be $2bn effectively taken out of trading circulation.

>I personally think we will see an average much higher than - perhaps around $1000 per channel.

>The material impact this will have on bitcoin price is often overlooked IMO


Hey all.. so any of you looking to open a position here (long/short) or waiting to see how it plays out in the next few hours? Would also like to hear from people who already have a long/short position open as to how they are looking to play this...

Edit: Just as I typed, it looks like its going to test 8.2k again.. moment of truth...?
Looks like we're going up. Not currently in position but moving a lot of funds around, wondering how many people will switch from Bitmex to altcoins as they start to pop and what impact that might have on price.

Edit: although, lets not suck eachothers dicks quiet yet.

Finex had 27k longs before the mega pump from 6900. Happened so fast that most new longs couldn't open in the interim. Currently at 29k, so ~2k are either underwater or gonna be thinking about closing at break even. Around ~2k have already closed. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/HujzSmZW/

edit: good points made below, it's more like at *least* 2k longs are underwater, as many profitable ones would have been closed from lower spots and any new ones opened would be abovev our current price
Disclaimer, TA "lurker" for a year, first post in this sub which i find very useful. Still have a lot to learn, especially on entry/exit points but you guys are teaching a lot (well, not all of you! :p ), thanks! :) Short/long term Bearish, mid term bullish, english is not my native language, be gentle! :)

I am looking at [this 4H chart](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vn8dtg9ah5adh1l/Schermata%202018-04-15%20alle%2011.11.03.png?dl=0), and [this hourly one](https://www.dropbox.com/s/y5w5ajdsgo4ep8y/Schermata%202018-04-15%20alle%2011.16.19.png?dl=0).
We are in the middle of a mid-term bullish channel that may impact against the old log resistance from 20k mid this week/end of april.
Currently we are very close to the top of the channel and painted an ascending triangle.
To me the ascending triangle is due for retrace or some sideways and then a retrace to get down closer to the bottom of the mid term channel:

a) we have a triple top @8100, the resistance has held the "standard volume" (i.e. excluding whale's buy orders);
b) volume keeps dropping;
c) we faced a lot of bart fractals since the beginning of April, the one started with the BGD on 12/Apr is due for retrace;
d) this market teach me that, unless there is a lot of volume and/or real FOMO/FUD, whatever spikes so suddenly and violently has an equal sudden and violent retrace;
e) a lot of us are sitting on the sidelines waiting for an entry, i.e. we are not sure the bear is over and some are scared of black swan events (BGD/BRD);
f) we are still following very closely [the 2014 bubble circle](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/YEKVBBnC-Bitcoin-2014-Crash-Overlay/);
EDIT: g) shorts are not that high and anyway lower than longs (delta is about 4k), a short squeeze is unlikely;

However my comment is mildly biased and i am new to TA so i would like to hear some different position. :)


Follow up on [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8bwesq/daily_discussion_friday_april_13_2018/dxbn7k7/):

So far it seems 7.5k held well. Second attempt at breaking up from the log support line (dotted green) that is acting as resistance now was more convincing and we're still flirting. We might actually get at part 2 of bullish scenario. (dude WTF) 

I drew [an additional line](https://imgur.com/aPD8oD0) on my chart that I'm guessing will act as support. If my guess is right that defines a rising wedge. If we can make it close enough to the apex there is going to be a fan-fucking-tastic battle with so much volume your hearing might get affected. While bulls will see a giant symmetrical triangle bears will focus on the bear market and rising wedge. I'd really like to see that happen as that would settle the argument between "this is still a bull market" and "we're in a bear market now".
Can someone give me a quick explanation of what it means to hedge bitcoin? Total n00b question but I would rather get it from experienced trader than a white Wikipedia page 
So my 4 hr stoch RSI cross played out quite  nicely. Heavily considering selling half my stack as a hedge here.

- Sitting just above daily bbands (they're still probably acting as downward pressure).  
- Barely wicked over the log support-turned-resistance. Realistically it's more of a resistance band and we're still dealing with it.  
- If we maintain this area of price (~8.1-8.3) we'll avoid the daily stoch RSI crossing today but it would take a lot to avoid it tomorrow.

Stops for buying back in above 8.5k if I do sell, waffling back and forth on it. Will probably sit around and sell if we make another attempt up or if we start seeing a high volume decline.

Add on: the top of the 4 hr BBands are now pretty much exactly at the log support line.

Update: Fully sold at 8300 ish, just being cautious. Stops as I said.
will this market ever move normally again or is it just pump and dumps from here on out? 

I feel like you can still trade it by guessing where other people's stops are. but besides that you just have to hope you're not trading like the majority or you're gonna get hunted lmao
looks like this bull flag may be about to break up.

Trying to learn something here.

So the triangle is coming to a conclusion. Is there any TA indicators that would give a higher probability for a breakout either upwards or downwards?

And if there arent and we are 50/50 about whether this will go up or down, then whats the best way to trade this? Wait for a clear confirmation of the breakout and only enter then?

If I already have a long open here from 7990 from 12h ago, then is the wise move here to close it for a small profit (because the previous trading idea has now expired) and free myself for whatever new position needs to be taken?
Yesterday I mentioned about a pattern that I’ve noticed on TradingView. It worked again; 

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8c5799/comment/dxcr8z7?st=JG0FQ7NH&sh=37ff4440
I am really surprised to see the price stayed overnight in the range, both channel and triangle. I am really curious is this going to be aggressive breakout or BTC will just continue sliding and ignore every TA aspect we are talking about in here. 
Fuck. 9k is my short position swing trade liquidation point.
oh boy oh boy, am getting laid tonight...
And guess who's overloaded again? I am long from 8115 according to this strategy at least, but as usual the futures lagging price was imposible to execute on https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ccvku/daily_discussion_sunday_april_15_2018/dxe8emq/

Gently caress their 4 MB 100 Mhz server
How high do we have to go to get out of the downward trend, like 8500?
Soon we are at that nice downtrend meme line again https://www.tradingview.com/x/2t1dN1tA

8200 to hold or not, that is the big question for me. So far this week a lot of resistances has turned support
Had a stop loss excecute on a short that i had previously already closed and forgot to cancel. Guess i´m long from 8200. /shrug
Its 6:10 am in the US & I just witnessed greatness.
How can we analyze/categorize buying pressure? What can we look at to tell if it's healthy or weak?

For example, Mike wrote: "No volume between sudden pumps, longs increasing accordingly"

How would one see this? Can we see it on the chart or do we have to look at order books?
[removed]
Wasn't as big a dump as I would've thought - anyone's guess if these people still have more coins to dump. Now the question is whether to open a long or hold onto my short. 
Going long with a small amount. It could absolutely go down but I'm playing this as a 3:1 risk/reward and I think I can beat those odds. Will hopefully ladder more buys later
i am no moon boy, i actually dont really care about short term, because I am a german hodler, who cannot sell before october and december, due to the 1 year... and, if I dont need the money by then, wont sell then and just hodl on until the next halvening...

but i think the fact that we can hold 8k might give us small signs of hope, that this might be a reversal
We broke out of the Bull Pennant on the 15/30/1HR but not as aggressively as we did last night . It’s a slower climb but I’m feeling a tad bit bullish. 

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/2fHwIr1l/
this is anecdotal but so far we're mirroring the movement from march after the falling wedge break:

march: https://www.tradingview.com/x/SATYtb31/
now: https://www.tradingview.com/x/UCCPWVVX/

If the past is any indication this could continue on low volume until we slowly meet the log downtrend.
New trading idea:  DildoBot

It keeps stop longs and shorts $50 over/under a moving average on the 1m candles.  Once a trade triggers it sets a limit sell/buy another $100 past that.  Thoughts?

Hot damn.  This is the type of shit that keeps me glued to the exchanges.  Hope everyone out there came out alright.  


"This is a sucker's rally" - this subreddit today.
why is everyone so butthurt?  Btc is over 8k!  Unless you bought during like a 3 month period of time or made some stupid trades you should be up quite a bit.  Many people need to relax a bit.  Its just bitcoin. 
Little off topic but just heard Art Bell passed away. Listening to him on the radio back in the day made me interested in thinking about things differently. 20 years later I'm on this wild journey trying to make magic internet money a success. RIP Art.

Mother of god. I hate greed. Should have shorted over 8400.

Shoulda coulda woulda. 
I can't imagine how bad was it for those stops that got wicked at this end of this ... monstrous wick going down to 8000.
Quick update on the Bitccoin market, we had a good week with gains across most of the crypto space.

The market responded strongly after we tested the bottom of the newly formed channel, and coincidentally also broke out of our longer term down trend channel.

The bear flag that was painted in early April clearly failed, instead we received a nice jumbo candle and some good price action, a nice reminder about the big hitters in crypto.

This buying volume has left a nice little bull flag in its aftermath, from a purely technical point of view I am bullish on the markets.

We could see the bull flag fail in which case I would put our short term support around the 7400 – 7600 zones. $8000 being our near term psychological support level.

Should we stay above the $8000 support zone I would expect a push to about $9500 before some correction.

Summary: I am bullish above $8000, cautious above $7400, and I will look to the bearish side of life should we consolidate below $7400 at any point this week.

Higher risk trades will be closed should we fall below $8000.

In the first post of this thread, I guessed that we'd see $8400 in the wee hours of the morning.

Here I am, attempting to time the last post of the thread, and we're right back where we started.

Reopened my hedge short at $8,330. 

This shouldn't go up any farther. 
So with this overloaded exchanges and big spikes, isn't it better to always be in a position and protect the downside and just wait? Of course not just buy in, but it seems sideways is over for now mid term 
🌒 
Well, I guess 8600 res is up next.
wisdom and BFX are showing different highs. I got a fill for a short at 8450 but wisdom isn't showing the true high which is about $10 higher. Anyone else ever notice if this happens (and how often)?
Assuming this one was a single entity, what are everyone's theories on the timing of it at 7am EST?
Rookie question. 

Suppose you had enough of a specific crypto to move the exchange price somewhat significantly and also had cash on hand. The currency is low volume without much movement either way. Volatility is low.  

Would it be most profitable to place a series of large volume buys and sells of an equal value apart then let the orders be filled back and forth all day -or-make less frequent whale moves to force the price up for a day or two and then back down for a day or two. 

Thanks

Dumb question, but when people talk about using FIFO (or LIFO, etc) for their taxes, does this apply to just their holdings on a particular exchange, or their global amount (i.e., their entire stash of some cryptocurrency)? 

For example, say someone has a 10 BTC stash they bought over the years, and then sends 1 btc to an exchange. Then lets say they trade that 1 BTC into usd 10 times back and forth, but end up still with 1 BTC on the exchange at the end. With FIFO, each time you buy then sell that 1 btc on the exchange, are you paying taxes as if you are selling some of your original 10 btc stash in chronological order (that you never even deposited on the exchange)?


Anyone looking for a clear cut daily RSI v-bottom before switching back into a bull?
[deleted]
Where are all the sellers!? You guys have open goal posts right in-front of you! It’s right there, go at it! ;)

In the meantime, buyers are painting a _potential_ bull flag: https://www.tradingview.com/x/vAFtePfz/

Alright, I’m being a big sarcastic here. I agree it’s getting a bit ridiculous. But honestly, sellers aren’t showing up to the looks of it?

I would not be the least surprised if this flag confirms and does another leg up to test 8.5k...
And now back to your regular bear market.

Edit : lol from like 48h underwater to profit in 5 minutes
[deleted]
People focusing on the daily stoch RSI (including me) should also consider that the 4 hr has crossed in the oversold region. If this recovery is really going to continue in the short term you'd expect that to indicate a leg up. 

Not saying a bounce will happen, but it could be a litmus test for the markets likely direction on a slightly longer term. Even if it does bounce there would still be time for the daily to cross later in the day or in the coming days.
Well that was quite the savage BGD
Volume has dried up too much for me, i'm not taking any position. Had expected more volume after our spike last week.
I know I’ve posted a plethora of times today and  I do apologize. Just a word of advice for new traders since I’m new to the game: 

If you have a target you’re comfortable taking a loss at and the price hasn’t reached it, let it ride out. 

I’ve panicked closed more times then I can count and it’s done nothing but burned me. Sure there are circumstances where you should close prior to your stop loss like when there are strong bullish indicators on the charts. But if you see a SGD on a one minute chart, don’t panic, take a step back and look at the market sentiment.   
Seems like this push up was done by a single person. Longs went up by 1400 in a few minutes. I think a whale is trying to push up the price so they can dump on it within the day. I don't think this price is sustainable for current market demand and we'll probably see low 7k's within a week or two but 6k is looking to be like a solid bottom. If we do ever get back down to 6k I think many people will buy it up for long term. 
It's always nice when Bitcoin goes up, but I would advise the bulls that a retracement to the 7600 range would be the best thing for Bitcoin over the next 24 hours. This would set a daily higher low and put us in position to break through the log resistance from the ATH in a couple days.

It’s looking good- holding ground at ~$8k! One full week of this I’d say we’re in notably good shape. 
I have a 1.000$ long with 25x leverage @ 8.120. I know it’s a gamble but should i put a stop here and take the profit or should i let it go further?

My recommendation to short / sell bitcoin now because it will go lower within the range. Please do not downvote just because you do not like the conclusion of the analysis. This sub is for different opinions both on technical anlysis and fundamentals and sentiment analysis:

1. Asia market is open and the most FOMOing of all markets (south korea) has a $300 DISCOUNT price on bitcoin

2. Google trends for "bitcoin" keywords which encompasses any search for bitcoin news, price, etc, is DOWN the last week despite this whale driven pump

3. There is no volume in between the pumps. It is a quick pumps, then a dead market. At some point the whale who bought up all the coin will need to sell it back. Unless FOMO kicks in, they will be selling it for a big loss.

4. The pump driven volume is drying up. Volume consistently on the decline despite being a weekday in asia currently.

5. More and more people are entering the 1 year holding period for bitcoin, so will be motivated to sell for tax efficiency.

6. Not one tether has been redeemed in the entire bear market. Not a single tether. Think deeply and critically about whether that makes sense. It is very low probability that tether did not participate in fraud or market manipulation. When tether crashes, so will a large part of the ecosystem. It is the number 2 coin by volume. That makes any holding from this perspective highly risky.
With volume drying up it's pointing to an absolute clear sign that crypto isn't being utilized as a currency but rather almost 100% hoarded.

Underlying economic activity wouldn't care about the actual price of Bitcoin because BTC would only serve as a medium for transfer and clearing between two points of cash (i.e. cash -> btc/goods -> cash). For example, you wanted to buy a game but didn't want to use your CC, so you go buy btc then pay for the game with btc. The company receiving has no interest in keeping the coin so it sells it for cash. Since neither party is holding the coin for the long term, it doesn't care what the current price of btc is.

So underlying commerce is price indifferent and therefore should continue even as the price of btc goes down and stays low. All the commerce cares about is a low fee. We currently have really low fees and therefore commerce should be alive and going.

Therefore with these low volumes the speculation dries up and all that is left with is commerce. We can see that the commerce is actually insanely low (under $150MM) per day while the market cap of bitcoin is over 140M. That's over 1,000x multiple. So around 99.9% of the price is due to hoarding, not underlying commerce.

Hopefully you can all see that this means there is very little actual cash sitting on the table and crypto is still massively overpriced and waiting to implode.
So whatever happened to the scaling debate? Do we only talk about problems when they are presently an issue? Real good foresight.
it s unlikely to breakout without hunting some stop losses.
Just remember that every time we get a green dildo like this, more 'expert traders' jump into new shorts. 

I cannot wait until May.
Those were some brutal buys. 
How is the ratio between long & shorts right now?
Have a short order opened at 8650, lets see if it gets filled. We will meet the log resistance line from ATH at around 8.6\-8.75k depending on the time we get there. When we go higher without a dropback here, the daily will also become overbought by then with an RSI above 70 \(12h around 80\). All lower time famres are already overbought a lot. I expect we might drop back to 8.1k then and reverse then to climbed higher or that was the top of a DCB and we fall back all the way. Downside directed large scale tirangle could then be in play. If we directly go through the resistance line in one go, I expect we test it again if it holds as support, so quite a safe bet, as you can exit the trade without a loss.
Just curious if anyone can answer this question for me:  At what price do we breach the trendline from our all time high?

EDIT:  Thank you so much for all your replies.  You're all great!

Do my eyes deceive me, or is that a bear trap on the 15 minute chart?
People really think that's the end of the dump? Have you not been here for the last few months? We were just rejected by our previous support line after 4 days with little/no sell pressure. I'd be amazed if we didn't see at least 2 red dailies now.

Howdy,

Been lurking for a month or so watching and doing some trading to get a feel for the market. I’ve had pretty good luck with my speculation on direction but terrible results in practice due to getting stopped out. The most recent examples are the BGD to 8000 the first time and then last nights jump from 8000 to the current. I entered long positions with what I felt were reasonable safety stops but they were both hit before the big jumps. My current strategy isn’t working so I’m curious how you guys make that decision on each trade?

What are your personal rules for stops when you feel pretty good about the direction but still want that safety net? 
Hey fellas wanted to share this live analysis of BTC price action, been loving the open discussion format!

What's the reasoning behind a bull flag? Bull flags should happen in a very bullish market. So, how is it possible that we can form a "bull flag" after the bottom of a long bear market? The first pump after a long term bottom is usually fought hard, which makes a contradiction here. Either, we never was in a bear market, this isn't a bull flag or that wasn't the true bottom.

What's the likelihood that this intraday rising wedge turns into a continuation pattern (e.g. rising wedge breaking up)?
Shorts didn't change much during this spike but a sizeable number of longs opened up. 

The volume is crap, some long term holders that sold in the last 3 months are rebuying but beyond that the volume is dead AF after each spike. How can this be sustainable? Can leverage/whales/exchanges prop the price up to 12k? 19k?

Anyone know which market had the big buy to kick off the pump this morning?  Wondering which chart to watch for the next one...
Did anyone else just see a 2000 BTC sell wall @ 8300 on Finex or did cryptowatch just glitch out for me?

I am long term holder and invested as most all the people here but if one single individual/group can pump the price this way and people see it as "organic"... well...

It slightly reminds me mid december/17.
Say slightly because that was parabolic, this goes 90°....

Not funny anymore, just going to follow the trend after next correction with VERY tight stops.

Nice little $300 ~~bounce~~ surge this morning. Looking at 8400 as resistance and 8250 as support with Stops at 8500 and 8150 respectively. 

The ascending channel we are in continues. It hasn't ended well in the past, so a retracement to ~7600 wouldn't be a shock. Set stops accordingly.

so this reversal is coming along nicely.  The real question would be is this for real or just a bull trap?  We won't know until the first big pull back.  If it completely recovers afterword then the new bull run might be here.  If not then 6 more months of winter.  I'm expecting it to keep hanging here and then have one more pump before the big drop.  Might take a week or so.

Genuine lols
I couldn't stop laughing LOL
Your name is as good as this comment is.  Thanks for posting mate. You cracked me up.

I mean realistically speaking, this was only a $200 dump. This is not really a big deal, it's just the first time it's dropped sharply since the bart a couple days ago. That turned out okay, so maybe this one will as well.
Next time someone complains about the "obvious manipulation" from one entity that bought up all the coins resulting in a big green dildo, ask them if they bought in too...they'll likely sheepishly admit that they did. If so, congratulations, they're part of the "problem" and their argument is invalidated. (Reverse for selling and big red dildos.)
Thank-you. You are my hero <3
I can only speculate, but I suspect the large volume-increase driving these "inorganic moves" are stops/liquidations & those actively looking to trade the breakout.
Respect for making actual art out of a damned TA Chart.
This TA is ridiculous, your swamp trendlines are completely inconsistent and in a couple cases don't even touch swamp support.

Would you consider this an ascending triangle or just a triangle?

To me it looks more like an ascending triangle but the wicks make it ugly (although what pattern looks "perfect"?)
What a call. Nice one!
Are you calling for a break up or a break down?
This "but BTC did that during last bear market" narrative is getting annoying, people are relying on it way too much. Current space is nothing like the last time, do you guys even remember what USD volume was back in the day? BTC was dead for many believers after the fall of MtGox.

> There are too many confident buyers who would buy it up before it gets there.

People are greedy and won't want to miss out another run, this will be true for a while I think.
I found that Twitter thread to be fascinating, thanks for posting it. Tacked onto the end of that thread is an article from November that had a lot of interesting information about Central Banks investing in crypto and why it's in their best interest to do so.

https://www.coindesk.com/2018-year-central-banks-begin-buying-cryptocurrency/
Seems arbitrary. 

There's no reason to select the 1 month span other than to use a date which is already behind us. Looking on those 2 charts on the top, it's 621% (2013) vs. 348% gains within 1 month. So, the gains don't align and the expected 1 month decreases don't align either.
> Now it's more like "lets just get the bear market over with and go to 100K already"

Maybe I remember it wrong but I'm pretty sure people also said this in 2014 (with 5 or 10k instead of 100k). We had 2 bubbles in 2013 and for a long time people thought this was just another retrace before the next bubble would start. For example there was /u/moral_agent's Bubble Watch overlaying current BTC price on the price during the previous bubbles:

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/28iudv/daily_discussion_thursday_june_19_2014/cibieyx/

(just one random example from 2014, funny because you're also in it)
Thanks for this analysis
Is this a bearish divergence?
I wish I had more than one upvote to give, because that is an accurate representation of me.
RSI and stoch in 1 chart... game changer
Also it’s early USA time most are sleeping, likely means the “active” traders are the ones on right now.

That means the likelihood of saltiness from failed shorts is higher.

People are looking for excuses to short at the moment because now “it must be the right time”

I’m with you I think the price action is quite bullish. Frankly though I’ve taken profits already and am just observing.
Because all the hysterical gamblers over here went short apparently.
I think a lot of people expected it to break down from the triangle it was in. I can’t speak for their positions, but I hope they had put in the proper stops. 
Yes it is. Use tight stops. No stress.
This is a sucker's rally
That's what I'm doing except I have SL at 8200 but am scaling in sells up to 8600 where I think we'll be forcefully rejected due to the proximity to the ATH log resistance. 

It could go all Bitcoin on us and kick right through the log resistance, but I'm fairly certain that won't happen without some retracement first.
I was literally just thinking about this.  If you had, for example, SL at -1% and take profit at +3%, for example.  I think better might be to set your buy and short as stops themselves and keep them on a buffer to each side of the moving average, trying to catch the beginning of a big candle.  I guess it all depends on how violent a movement you are expecting.
Your Ichi is always on point. Cheers.

> OnlyTheRealAdvice • 4m
> > This dump really is the best-case scenario for bulls

> Agreed. Best case scenerio for BULLS is that the price dumps. Intuitively you would think best case scenerio for a BULL would be a bulling price that rises. But, no, logically we can conclude that a DUMP is actually the best-case scenerio all around when you want a rising price. /s

> Sometimes I wonder if everyone on this market discussion is high on some dark market drugs. Though, I guess that would mean bitcoin got used for something, so it is doubtful given the low transaction volume (2 year lows transaction volumes), so I doubt people on here have any dark market drugs (at least paid for in bitcoin). So, the cause for the idiocy I just read which was updated I cannot explain.

Stop being daft. If you don't understand, ask questions. The OP made a perfectly valid point regarding retracements and consolation being necessary for healthy trends (in both directions) and to break upcoming supports and resistances. Otherwise you get blow-off tops and V bottoms which occur because of strong non-stop movements and often cause trend reversals.

But something tells me you know most of this and are just trolling.

Username checks out...
On kraken ethusd is driving btc slightly upward. Bitfinex is showing horizontal movement dispite it. Will watch ethusd, if it keeps going up will exit my short also until it starts dumping. Lately eth dumped before btc started dumping also.

Where is log resistance? Not near the charts
The correction (dump?) will come when there is maximum fear to go short. 
Daily RSI crossed, but could see a decent bounce off bottom of channel for a nice long scalp. 

May open up a little guy with stops below 8k. Risky business though. 
I don't know man I wouldn't touch this fire even with a pair of gloves and a 5 foot stick until it cools down
I would at least wait for more buying strength to show
FWIW, I did notice that these BARTs are often a quirk in a continuation... most recently on Friday from 7800-8200-7800, then we continued upward.
good time for a long if you're ready to close it below $7950 or $7800 depending on leverage/position size
Are the blue arrows the only places you see the daily interacting with the top of the BBands on your chart?
swiggety swooty
We broke up out of that. Trend reversal sign maybe?
thanks, stoch RSI would indicate a downmove as well: https://www.tradingview.com/x/GFOS1g71/
Good trade 

Yeah that didn't seem to work (for now). We'll see if there's another attempt over the next few hours as the triangle lines come closer to converging. I guess there's no real way to know, bulls (whales) have been unpredictable. Have to consider stoch rsi getting hot. I have a small short from 8090. Stops at 8.4 but wondering if I should just bail if we cross 8.3 
and we're breaking out of that now too
Thats what i do also, to bad i got bored yesterday and closed mine. Good luck 
I say bail now brah. Don't catch falling knife, up or down. Don't catch the top 1/8 nor the last 1/8 as the saying goes. 
Why bail at the log line? 

Bail at breakeven and re-short 8.4-8.6, don't feed other people's shorts at 8.5. That play doesn't make sense to me. 
How big of a % of your whole stack are you in with? 

If youre already all in, id at least reduce the position, and you'll probably have that chance soon around 8200-8300, even if we still go higher from here.

If its below a third of your stack, then id say theres an argument to be made that this will at some point go down again and you can fill your position on each leg up. Biggest temporary bull runs on our way down from 11500 have been around 2000USD - we are at that level now. That said, % wise we are alreay risen more, and since this was a much lower start at around 6500, it makes sense this rise has more power.

Stops around 9300-9400?
Why do you call it a "short hedge"? 
Want to understand terminology that's all. Why not just "short"? 
I would advise layering in up to 8.6 but it looks like you're giving yourself plenty of room for stops so it should be ok. 

I have a similar hedge strategy and my first small sell was filled at 8425. 
What are we looking at for support now? 8.1? With previous support being 7.7?
TA worked this time, thankfully. Got my limit buy filled at 8275 and nice little bounce off of 8250. 

RSI got a little relief with that drop as well on the 15M - 4H time frames. We could be in business for another leg up sooner rather than later. 
And with that, daily stoch RSI is currently crossed. We'll see if it stays crossed. Need to get back above ~6300 ish I believe.

Certainly doesn't look good.

I think the same! it's a matter of time
I'm really scratching my head at the moment, shorting is rational, but I'm not so sure that the market is rational at the moment. 
Take profit levels? 
How you doin?
How you feeling about your position Mike? 
RIP
I dont see a wedge to be fair, to me it looks more like a channel. With basically parallel lines conecting the wicks. 

Don't think it will hold long term because its just insane, but i don't think it will behave like a wedge.
Nice chart. How did you draw the fibs? 
Would the retracement level at the log line (which I believe we'll hit) be a much better indicator for market sentiment?

.236 level retracement is a great bull indicator on its own, but when we had such a massive squeeze beforehand, we shouldn't be expecting a huge retracement immediately, wait until the bears enter back into the market first.
I have it at $9k on bitstamp.
Make your moves in chunks based on the market. Buy a bit now and wait a bit for more confirmation. 
It's broken on the linear.  May want to take a low leverage long and see if you can close before hitting th log descending resistance.
you people are absurd. I have never been 100% fiat. i've never even been long fiat, it's just a matter of exposure
I don't think that's true anymore. That was the case in September 2017 with coinbase exploding in popularity, but until we get over 12k I don't think you're gonna see mass hysteria again.
We broke out of the 2014 bear market at around ~$350 (roughly, this is based on memory).  New investors didn't start coming right away. They came after we broke the previous ATH, after we broke 2k, 3k, 5k, 9k, and especially 10k.

We're not just going to enter bubble mode again. It'll slowly creep up, and by the time these "new" investors want to get, you should be planning your exit.
someone decided to buy a bunch of btc in the middle of the night again (2.5k in 1 minute) 

actually think I'm gonna take a break for a bit after this- bear, bull, doesn't matter, this is not really fun anymore. Just a guy with thousands of btc throwing the market around

maybe will come back on lower leverage 
Think we're going to 8500-8700 area before going down. That giant short squeeze seems to have given the market some lease of life. Thing is if we build up longs on the way up unless the shorts increase(because they went from 40K to 24K on the squeeze) I cant see this lasting, the buy pressure just isn't there IMO. The market just seems to be extracting money from people at the moment and I don't see that as particularly bullish sign.
see you in  two hours
12k
11.6k
TA confirmation would be breaking the top between the bottoms.
What price is listed?
Possibly withdrawals disabled? There must be a reason this isnt beign arbitraged.


Seems a little tenuous to me since the bottom of the channel is only based on one point of contact
Believe me exchanges will be the first to adopt it once they feel it's stable enough because it will save them a lot of money, so you might get some of that at first but exchanges should quickly adopt it. 
I don't think there will be any meaningfull BTC "stuck" in LN, you can always close your channel and send it to an exchange, or down the road exchanges will probably accept LN tx deposits as well.
Very interesting.  The number of nodes continues to grow rapidly. Was 348 last I checked and now over 1500.   
It got sold straight in to. Hard to trade this. It's what's known as the dumb zone, possibly heading to 7900 if Joyrider's chart is correct (which I think it is).
I sold my holdings again and currently out of position. 
Not sure anymore what to think of all this.

If we break above 8.2 i'll probably FOMO in again for a good portion of my stack.  Otherwise i will wait this out a day or two
It is not just someone. It is the very group of people who bought the coins during the pump the last week. You can read my analysis here: https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ccvku/daily_discussion_sunday_april_15_2018/dxfjoom/

The way a pump works is that you only make money when you sell the coins back to the idiots FOMOing in. If you fail to create FOMO, then you failed at the pump and thus will incur a loss. Huge market orders was predictable given the anemic non-pump volume.

The pumpers were literally running out of time. At any minute another whale could market sell and thus crash any chance of them getting back their money without millions in losses. So, they could not wait around forever. They literally have an urgency to sell to maintain capital.
My guess is that more than 2k will be under water Longs open as others close. So, 5k in longs may have closed in profit as it was at $7500 and 5k new longs at $7500 opened. The net-longs didn't change, but their price averages did.

What we just saw appears to be closing of the longs that was created for the pump that occurred 12 or so hours ago. Basically, it was a failed pump. My guess is there will be a cascade effect over the next couple days as there is no FOMO being generated by the pumps.
That's not how it works, it's a dynamic process. Even if the amount of longs stayed the same, people constantly open and close them.
I've never seen the overlap before. Nice post, thank you.
nice first post and good eye on this mid-term bullish channel.
Thanks for the info! What would be the timeframe for this apex?

>Can someone give me a quick explanation of what it means to hedge bitcoin? Total n00b question but I would rather get it from experienced trader than a white Wikipedia page 

Open a short position against the value of your bitcoins. This locks in the fiat value if your bitcoins, protecting you from loss in case the price drops. 
you have a cold storage stack. you have a trading stack. you are betting on price going up (long) with your storage stack. you are hedging your long hold stack with a short with your trading stack. ergo you make money even if price goes down. 

edit: or just hedging long positions with short positions, doesn't have to be cold storage.
Could I see your chart? Because on mine we already crossed the log support-turned resistance.

This is how I have it drawn (red dotted) : https://www.tradingview.com/x/TB9H8N5B/

Zoomed in : https://www.tradingview.com/x/5wGaXBjQ/
Every pump and dump frustrates a normal trader and causes a certain percentage of them to trade into fiat one last time and cash out. That is why you will see these pump and dump occurring with lower highs and lower lowers.

Though traders do not have "strong hands" in aggregate they own a lot of bitcoin just due to the percent of the time they are "in market" (holding bitcoin for a trade). As these traders evacuate the market due to low liquidity and increased level of manipulation due to that low liquidity, then you will see more and more declining prices.
On some positions like this short from 8.1 I set alarms not stops, if you are confident about the lack of volume, retrace, suspect lack of selling, bear divs  it's only a matter of time before it reverses. Best to not read this sub while underwater tho...
Not before US regulation
the pnd's aren't entirely random though. Aside from divergence, we saw the macd lines were squeezing together. Can only move the market when you have bots on your side
3 more minutes until some candles close and I believe it.

This belongs in r/cryptocurrency . Please keep your posts here focused on Bitcoin.
Ya I mean most the community is split pretty 50/50, the best move is to just wait for confirmation and play on that, it should be violent either way it goes.    If you're leaning bullish you can leave it long and put a stop loss at break even but hard to say.  I'm bullish but just waiting for a confirmation cuz there are so many indicators and signals for both arguments so not sure how anyone is confident enough to pick a side at this moment.   Just cancel your long, set an alert and be ready to go either way I think is the best choice. 
I chose to focus on fundamentals personally.
I look at which side is rejected more severely last time.


But it was sell for like a month straight and correct the whole time.
it's just a lagging indicator is all. it's generally right until it's not, and then it's pretty wrong for a bit, and then it's slowly right again. 
Lol, ya I keep telling people this for awhile now. 
you had 50% chance to be right. Today, there is 25% chance your observation still valid. 
Miles before that happens - but at this point, looks probable.
8,800 would get us out of the giant triangle from the ATH. Wouldn't bet on it til some time in May though.
I have it around there. But just because we break it doesn't mean we are out of a bear market. I have a feeling, though, we are going to bounce right off of it.
8.2 was the longterm log support turned resistance, and we pretty much broke that right now. This is a verry bullish sign imo
To be expected to see low volume between the pumps. Bearish signal if you are bearish, but it's bullish if you are bullish. As usual, indicators and their interpretation are a bit subjective. 

For me this drawn out consolidation pattern looked like a continuation. Especially because many alts look rather bullish and there's a good chance they have seen the bottom at least for a couple of weeks. I feel like it's the altspace dragging Bitcoin up and not the other way around.

It's only been about ~30m
Low volume, I'm thinking we'll double top 15m here and retrace some of this pump. 

Edit, I'm probably wrong, usually am wrong... might turn into a cup and handle

You may attract the wrong crowd 
Hitting the correct pump even half-way is still a guaranteed cant-lose-money situation, so you have a point there.

The question for me would be how do you identify the candle that actually IS the one? There are usually several fakeouts before and hitting one of those could leave you sitting at the very wrong end of the current channel.

I've had about 50% success rate entering on dildos, still not sure if its a good idea.
Whales buy and sell otc though.

It’s funny because we will either go up or down from here, but whatever happens, it’ll seem obvious in hindsight and whichever side is right will say “well obviously!”.

this is how it happens- *everyone* starts to lose money. despair for all- bears and bulls. That's how it happens

Bulls sold the bottom and longed the top, bears shorted the bottom and closed at the top. when the market is more about trading than holding, it becomes too frustrating for participants as they realize trading is very, very difficult 
I'm with ya there dude. Lost a legend. Sucks.
The crazy thing is he died on Friday the 13th. Seems fitting. 
depends, on BFX I would say anything less than 250 is not a proper wall. Also depends a bit on the price level, if it's an obious point like 8400 you know it's a intended one
I got wrecked again as well. Lost all my gains from the entire weekend. Feelsbadman
Stopped me out at 8200, but I got back in after the pullback of the bounce at 8137. Not too bad. Held onto some fiat in case this dives lower.

What are we going to see today Mr. Barber?
I see two possible bull scenarios. 

The first scenario bounces off 8.5 k - 9 k, forming a handle, and rocketing up to 11 k. Twice we've gone from 8.5 K to 11 k in four days in the last few months.

In the second scenario, we spend time doing price discovery in this range. We haven't spent a lot of time here, So we bounce off of 10K -11k and form a large handle there. This scenario is predicated on us taking about a month to get to 10K, and probably spending another two weeks to a month getting back up to 10K - 11k after that initial rejection.

The second scenario is more bullish, IMO.
Fully prepared for a sucker's rally. Selling incrementally all the way up. Don't think it'll go as high as people looking to time the top want it to.
This and replace 10k with "wherever/whenever there is enough liquidity for him to unload it all"
The man is back!

People are talking a lot about FOMOing in for the rise. Thing is.. we are in a bear market now, people have seen it falling and some have made lot of money from it already. So there will be a lot of folks waiting to FOMO in on the fall too, stacks ready and waiting. So the fall can become pretty vicious. 
Doubtful it reaches 10k, 9.2k maybe.
But it could go up further.
you're wrong buddy. my wire clears on monday. it is going to be nothing but green dildos.
My body is ready
watch this bull flag go to 8600.
Where are you thinking of setting stops?
Huge bear div on ethusd 3H, and I mean huge, not closing my underwater short from 8100, but not adding either, will try to close at or near breakeven and re-evaluate.
Dude... i'm so glad you post here. I sold as soon as I saw this and you saved my ass. Always appreciate you chewy
Well done man.. are u keeping the position open for a bit longer or taking profits now? If not closing now, any specific target in mind?
I closed my long at 8380..waiting it out now..
any particular indicators you're using here? or just raw feel?
What would be your soft stop here?  8500? 
Did you open up the hedge on June futures? I didn't see the price go that high ($8,330)
the top at BFX seems to be 8459.

curious, how can you get such perfect entries? are you using limit or market orders, and how can you tell that this would be the highest this current candle goes? just curious, because 8450 is like an 99% accomplishment here, would be impossible for me.
bitcoinwisdom sometimes doesn't process all data of bitfinex during fast moves -- sometimes bitcoinwisdom.com only shows 500 btc volume when there was a 2.5k btc volume; cryptowatch mostly gives more accurate data
I spilt morning coffee on my keyboard and as I was cleaning it I hit market buy by accident. 
I'm thinking evoke maximum FOMO with groggy North American eyes.
What?

LIFO, FIFO, etc. refers to the cost basis accounting method you use to calculate your capital gains tax on applicable transactions for the year.  Once you select a method, you must use it consistently (you can't use FIFO for bitcoin, LIFO for ethereum, and Avg Cost for litecoin - you pick one and stick to it for everything). Transferring coins between exchanges does not trigger a taxable event.  
I feel the IRS needs to provide more guidance around FIFO, LIFO and other methods for cryptos. It's a grey area with no black and white answers.

Some people think FIFO based on when you bought them regardless of exchanges or where they are stored is the most conservative and safe way to do it.

A smaller set of people think FIFO based on wallet and exchange is fine.

A smaller set of people think FIFO, LIFO or lot specific is totally fine and you can choose your lot based on any that you own.

We won't know for sure until the IRS releases more guidance or when some case history is produced.

Here's some more info:

The TA doesn’t mean anything if there is no more fiat to pour in. Is there more fiat to pour in? 
> sellers aren’t showing up to the looks of it?

imo buyers aren't really showing up either, it's just huge buys that stop people out and scare people into buying.

once the big playa decides to buy or sell the market will move again

the market lately seems to be moved primarily by stop hunting. just lots of stop buys/sells triggered which is why we see so many ridiculous wicks before going back to virtually no volume
The dumping is not done my friend. The first dump was a shot-fired that signals the soldiers to load the canons for more dumps. The cascade effect will bring the price below $7k by end of week, IMO.
the price wicked 8k on finex, albeit briefly from a huge market sell, then 3 min later went down to 8068
Also, look at that [weekly](https://snag.gy/2NP7of.jpg) stoch son!
You can’t always take a bearish tone. You gotta start leveraging up with it. 
If you also look at past daily stoch RSI's it can be oversold for 6 days or more before it comes back down. 
>  the 4 hr crossing IS in the oversold region

can someone explain to me how stoch rsi works so I can understand why this is possible? this seems a bit ridiculous to me. I've always found stoch rsi to be pretty useless and seeing that 4 hr is oversold rn makes me think it's even more useless

edit: just kidding. it's basically the 2nd derivative of price? So because our momentum (e.g. 2nd derivative, acceleration) is slowing to virtually a complete halt we are now "oversold" on stoch rsi. What exactly is this good for? 

What's the "protocol" when relatively similar timeframes are giving completely opposite results? 
deluded bears reporting in
(In all seriousness) I'm convinced that everyone is waiting around to see what happens as we approach the log downtrend, which I have at 8760 right now and falling. No buyers but no one ready to sell yet either.
I've been sitting on an 8120 short all day. 
patience is the greatest skill a trader can have
[deleted]
Maybe they don’t plan to dump? Maybe they think we hit the bottom and these are literally the best times to be buying for the long term. At this rate the window of opportunity isn’t large.
That being said, the hourly is forming a tight equilibrium pattern and could have a break in the next 30-60 minutes. No reason to think we won't continue up to test 8600, though I think the rejection would be substantial if we do since that will bring us close to the log resistance from 19K.
[removed]
til someone decides to sell 6k in 15 minutes.
You say that, but knowing bitcoin it never likes staying in one place for too long.
Yes but it keeps losing momentum each time it get close to or over 8.1k. Not even testing 8.2k recently. This tells me that either it is preparing for a good pump to get past 8.2-8.3k area or will have another lazy test of 8.2k and then retrace back towards 7.5-7.7k. 
Take the win. 3x leverage is risky but 25x and you can get wiped with one whale candle
yes, no question - at least take some profit
trailing stop
always protect your profits, so yes 
Let it ride till the next halvening🤪... which will you regret more? Seeing price go up after you closed it, or getting rekt?
Remember when it went from 6k to over 11k. This pump has had no legs and is doomed. Until we have some alts die, we have more bleeding to go. 
Dude, it does have to retrace. That is the point. It has gone up so quickly on lowish volume (besides the short squeeze) that it will go back down a bit. 

Now, are we out of the bear market? Who knows? I don't think so, as we have gone up 31%, and have only recovered roughly 10% of the way back (310% in total). But, maybe we are going back up the other 9/10 of the way. 
For better or for worse though, you can’t deny that the last two TA resistance levels were blasted through by single buyers. It jumped past both 7.8k and 8.2k in a matter of minutes, literally. It could just be bull whales trying to drive price back up, but you just need to realize that the price could go down just as easily. Enjoy, but just don’t get hopes up too high yet.

You're wrong about tether being redeemed. In February they took back millions of tether. That actually was a good indicator for us starting this bear market because when they took back and burned the tether that meant people were selling back into fiat. Tether is not fraudulent.
> Asia market is open and the most FOMOing of all markets

Hmm, something seems wrong with this market analysis. Something's not quite right with it. I just can't exactly put my finger on it...
As nervous as I am about shorting here I genuinely suspect that you may be right. Pumps are getting weaker and I can't really think of much reason for BTC to be increasing in value right now - interest is clearly dropping.
> Please do not downvote just because you do not like the conclusion of the analysis.

OK. How about I down vote you because I don't like unsubstantiated claims? 
> There is no volume in between the pumps. It is a quick pumps, then a dead market. At some point the whale who bought up all the coin will need to sell it back. Unless FOMO kicks in, they will be selling it for a big loss.

I really, *really* hate this argument, and I hear it around here *all* the time. It's just flat-out false.

First, the same is often true for downtrends as well: quick dumps, then a "dead market" (it's not really dead, it's just high-volume movements followed by low-volume consolidation as the market determines whether to continue, retrace, or stay flat).

Second, it's not one big whale doing all the buying or selling...it's hundreds of traders reacting to market movements in quick succession. I myself smashed through two walls on the way up, and I wasn't the only one buying. Yes, there are rare instances when you *can* attribute market action to one trader, usually when you can actually see a XXX or X,XXX BTC market buy/sell go through. But even those will likely only result in a long wick unless thousands of traders across dozens of major markets actually respond to the action and follow through.

We heard similar flavors of nonsense the whole way down from $20K (one whale is shorting the entire market from ATH to $6K and he's almost out of coins!) and now apparently one whale is responsible for every single pump. People just like to blame whales / the exchanges / Soros for every single move, the same way people used to blame God for thunderstorms before we understood the intricacies and complexities of weather phenomena. I see it as a form of learned helplessness, and it's highly detrimental to a trader's view of the markets.

By the way, I'm bearish on short to medium timeframes myself (and currently completely out of the market with my trading stack). I just don't like that argument.
You're not wrong. This low volume pump is a joke. Moon kids are going to get wrecked, but at this point I'm happy about it. Some people just need to learn the hard way. 
Thanks for this mate. Just sold my holdings.. you raise a good point and I have been drawn too fa rin in by FOMO.
Just like gold is waiting to implode right, with its main purpose also being hoarding

Human greed will never die and will fuel many more bull runs
I'm buying BTC because of its hyperdeflation, not because I want to buy a coffee with it. 

After 2017, I'm sure one thing won't ever disappear - human greed, that's the main drive for this. Combine greed with this pure and unique [free market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market) and you have something unpredictable.

Cool napkin math and conjecture. 
Now to the big question... what happens if the increase of those BTC purchases outweights the sellers on the exchanges :O  for example some chinese game or micro tx or decentralised payments would become popular to really utilize crypto
Oh so you are telling a Reddit sub dedicated to the price movement of bitcoin that bitcoin is a very speculative asset and could very well go way up or down on price?  You assume none of us have looked at a chart?  No one here knows where the hell this is really going.  We all know it is a crazy ass game and this point and no one knows the future.  We just choose to play the game and anyone this deep in the game, where they are going on reddit looking at a daily thread on price action knows what bitcoin is and what it is capable of simply based on the past.  
Dude volume completely dried up last night and it pumped to 8300+. The rest of your comment is invalid 
The current speculative thesis is that it is digital "gold." That has not been disproven yet. Only a hack or continued volatility would disprove that, imo.
Okay guys right here is a prime example of what I've been saying the past few days. "Bears" get downvoted regardless of content and "Bulls" get upvoted regardless of content. Just read this thread and you'll see the proof. Stop lying to me when I call this out.

This is a major issue with this subreddit and won't be fixed until we take a good hard look, and realize this is an issue. It's bias at its max and is COMPLETELY unhealthy for a finance trading forum. It deters from productive and insightful discussion.

While I completely agree with you, there are obviously more people wanting to play the hot potato game than margin calls I can get before going bankrupt, reality has little to do with people thinking they can win the ponzi (until greed kicks in and they don't sell the top).
the debate ended in August. If you want to talk about scaling generally, have at it in /r/bitcoin.
Just use bitcoin when you're trying to immigrate to a different country and probably just want to avoid paying taxes or you're at serious risk of having your property wrongfully confiscated by a dictatorial government (possible if you live in china or something but almost certainly a non factor for 99% of humanity including those living under quasi communist governments).

There shouldnt be a scaling issue once price stagnates or continues to fall and people lose more interest.
i cant wait until monday. alts are breaking the long term resistance. it is bitcoin turn now...
One side are currently very relaxed on a Sunday and the other are more than likely starting to sweat if not gone broke already.  They don't close....  Either way it's up from here. 
8600-9000. I have to do some math but I can't right now. 
At the current pace, we should break it at the 8600 mark in 2-3 days.


If we stay in this current blue channel, anywhere between 8770 and 8650

Also known as a double top. If you look at a lot of charts you'll notice Ms appearing at the tops of bull runs, and Ws appearing at the bottoms of bears.
We used to say that "M" is for murder and "W" is for winner. Only half-jokingly used as valid TA.
M. O. O. N. that spells retracement.
For the record, this isn't a spiteful post, but you're completely devoid of vision. I'll feel sympathy as you're left behind eating the $7k crumbs BTC leaves in its wake because you usually seem well-intentioned for a troll.

I'm not saying $100k is coming this year, next year, or the year after, but to claim that this technology is dead, useless, and a PnD fails to recognize the countless milestones and hurdles that dwarf anything we're experiencing this year. 

Good luck, but perhaps you should take a break from this sub.
People like to talk alot of shit about bulls posting nonsense that isn't related to trading but holy fuck, you take the cake today.
There are a few bitcoin myths that are ingrained into bitcoiners via controlled and censored subs. These myths are:

1. Bitcoin is still in early adoption phase. No, it was blasted on all financial networks non-stop for months and Yahoo Finance places crypto above stocks on their home page. We are not in early adoption phase.

2. Hodl will guarantee money. While this has been true for many people it is not guaranteed in the future. Assets do actually peak.

3. Bitcoin is digital gold. This marketing phrase was invented after it's original use-case (currency) failed. Simply repeating it over and over does not make it true.

4. Bitcoin is decentralized. It's mining is controlled by few people. It's developer base is small. A huge portion of the tokens are controlled by few people. Very few people control the ecosystem of bitcoin (exchanges, service providers, etc).


I agree with what you say in general. Lot's of people will be bagholdng bitcoin. However, I still like to trade it. It's direction will have a downward bias for at least years to come. But, it will have a lot of volatility to trade.
If you quit bitcoin, please don’t leave this sub. We need you.
Don't look at anything under 1hr
The total lack of selling and retracement since 6.8 could also indicate a huge bull trap ya know, that's not how normal markets behave.
That would actually be ideal as long as we maintain above ~7200. My only concern would be panic selling by weak hands should we fall that far. 
My advice to you would be to not try to trade any of this range. It's overdue for a pullback and also looks like no one wants to sell right now

either hold a position and wait or sit it out, you'll just lose money if you keep closing and reopening
FOMO is probably one of the worst thing when it comes to crypto. When your feeling it, sit on ur hands and blow some steam off before you make any irrational decisions. 

Don’t get fooled by a 40$ green candle as we have been rejected constantly around the 8130-8150 area for the last few hours.  If you really want to fomo in, i recommend DCA instead of buying up a large portion of BTC all at once

This market needs to unwind hard to get rid of the kind of posters complaining about manipulation and pump and dumps.

These kinds of movements have existed for as long as Bitcoin has been traded. I've personally witnessed them since I started watching the markets in 2014. I'm sure I can dig up screenshots from back then with red and green dildos. It's called volatility. The only time I can remember when they didn't happen was during the bottoming of the bear trend when volume was super low and we consolidated around $200/$300 for months (which was also natural).

Lower leverage and loosen stops. Use mark price instead of last price on bitmex for your stops because those liquidations and other people's market stops can cause massive wicks that screw you over. 
1) Smaller positions
2) Bigger stops
In that order.
After being stopped out repeatedly when I first started trading, I now always add $100 to what I think it will be in either direction and it has worked well.
After getting stopped out repeatedly at the beginning, and more recently, just picking the wrong direction with my trades, panicking, closing and opening positions, I'm starting to think what might work for me is just DCAing an entry point at low leverage so the liquidation point is low (ie. if you were to go long right now, have liquidation somewhere in the low 6k range). But that kind of r/r scenario might not interest you...
I use low leverage, usually no more than 3x or 5x when I'm super confident. I usually put stop-loss around 4-6%, but even then I'm getting stopped out from time to time.

The key, I found, is to scale into your position and be ready to add to it if the market turn against you temporarily. You need to be sure enough on your trade that a 1-2% swing is not affecting your decision on the move. In that case, it's usually a good idea to add to your position.
Yeah, I just noticed that today.  I don't know if it was a bug, since I didn't actually use it.  Did you get charged an actual fee on a stop limit?
As far as I know, they've always charged for stop orders since it's essentially a market order made on the fly. 

Limit orders still have no fees as of this morning. I had one filled when we dipped to 8275.

Edit: I just reread and noticed you said 'Stop Limit' orders. Apologies, as I haven't used this feature for trading yet and don't know if fees apply. In fact, if someone would like to provide a ELI5 for stop limit orders, I'd be very interested to understand how it works.
The price doesn't care about your rules. 
What if Bitcoin continues to be in a bull market and what we saw during Q1 2018 was just a major correction?
They mean falling wedge. A lot of terms are used idiosyncratically in Bitcoin contexts I think largely because of the lack of subject-matter expertise in the newly-powerful demographic (not just in market terminology).
So, what do you think that means?
That’s because we may now be in the “fools rally” denial stage. No one is buying back in because no one trusts it. Once the trust returns people will start buying back in en masse, but the price needs to get sufficiently high first. At a guess I’d say back over 10k could do it as that is a psychologically powerful number.
It's Sunday, don't expect massive volumes. We just broke out after consolidation, this kind of volume spike is nothing unexpected.

> Can leverage/whales/exchanges prop the price up to 12k? 

You seriously believe that? That's some tinfoil hat shit, meant to support your own bias.
Sustainability and short term price trends never usually align in crypto. Sentiment always tends to outlast any “fundamentals.”

That said the sentiment has not even come to close to unreasonably bullish. You can get a sense from this thread and its comments.

Alternatively of course if the hidden sentiment is bearish then you’d be spot on. For me though these prices are still extremely cheap per my long outlook so in the coin flip of long/short I tend to favor long because in the grand scheme long/buying BTC here is the play.

Shorting after a spike makes reasonable sense on paper (that seems to be the impotus for your comment); the environment though tells me not many market participants are interested in selling. You’d be betting on your random bear whale theory (which I can’t confirm nor reject).
Always entertaining reading your shamelessly bullish posts. You should learn TA so that you can contribute more to the sub than wishful thinking.
tether prints dont really correspond with money entering. If anything, with money moving to the sidelanes. 
Hard to tell with tether prints. I saw one hypothesis that the previous print was for people tethering up their BTC for impending doom. Maybe it stayed on the exchanges (doesn't it always?) and has rushed back to BTC then. So that would support your theory. 
Could you please explain? Genuine question.  
Usually its finex, followed by a short squeeze
Ya, saw that. Probably trying to kickstart the seemingly impending sell-off
This is just one of many theories, but here's what I think of the market recently:

Most people who were going to sell any significant amount of coins did so on the way down from $20k to $6k, and then had one more chance to sell at the second go above $10k. 

Most people who were going to buy any significant amount of coins at this time had plenty of time to do so at sub $10k (even sub $7k) prices. 

What we have now is a genuinely exhausted market, because potential sellers (people who were buying between $10k and $6k) want to sell *much* higher than this, and potential buyers (people who sold above $10k and did NOT buy yet) want to buy *much* lower than this.

So, any market move can end up being very violent in either direction because orderbooks are thinner than usual and liquidity is lower than usual. Combine this with more than usual margin trading going on because daytraders need to use higher leverages to make up for a generally more flat market (and until recently, very flat alt markets), and you've got a very explosive mixture on your hands. 
If you understand the use of stops, you should understand what creates price action like this.  It's not "organic" buying in the sense of random people buying small amounts for use in dark markets or something, but it's not necessarily one whale either.

When a lot of people have orders to buy at or near a certain price threshold, you see this sort of cascading affect.  It happens in both directions.  Everyone can't buy or sell at the same time and all fill at a great price.
I can : https://www.tradingview.com/x/Bf8KkFsW/


Low volume doesn't need much of a buy to spike the price. Head on over to ZEC and buy 100 coins and see what happens.
My best guess is algos painting the tape.
I mean that's kind of how it's supposed to work, right? It doesn't always happen on a regular time frame obviously, but retracement is a good thing for further movement upward.

You are a newbie who is learning how to trade bitcoin and admittedly been losing money. Why do you keep on making risky bets in what even seasoned traders call a no-trade zone? 
same thing, was bitching to myself when it rose higher. Don't think it'll go to mid 7000s but now we wait...
Korea already broke under $8k. 
Tell me. How are all the prices across exchanges linked? How does a marklet sell on Gdax for example, affect the price on Binance?
stopped the climb there awful quickly

> ridiculously overpriced

This is so funny when people say this. What the hell does this even mean? 

It is literally priced by supply and demand so the current price, by definition isn’t over or under priced.

Utter nonsense. 
Hidden orders and stop-limits, sir. The order books on BFX are never what they seem.
Don't trade the order book.
Why would we go down to 8k? Making assumptions to justify bitcoin being over priced. Sounds like you made a bad trade kush
Lol people rage downvoting anything looking near or far like a legit concern (liquidity, no proper retrace, poor volume etc)

Dump incoming probably, then comes the ragedownvoting of any bullish or reasonable (this will not go directly to 4k) comment.

There doesn't need to be fomo: supply and demand. If the supply is limited (more people hodling because they believe the bottom is in), the demand will raise the price.
It is a really interesting question--can the whales keep us inflated without any new money coming in? It seems obvious to me (but maybe I am just delusional) that there is barely any new money coming in, and it is essentially just whales triggering long and short squeezes. 

I see the future playing out in one of two ways: 

1) some event triggers a new bubble/interest (maybe an ETF)--I don't think this is super likely for awhile though because most of the retail/dumb money interest got majorly jobbed during the run up, and are facing real life pain (e.g., Bitcoin MLM moms and plumbers are now going to the local Six Flags instead of Disney on the family vacation because they lost 1000s). BTC has become associated with a scam by the very audience that you need to push this back up. 

2) Eventually the core HODLER support group can now longer continue to "buy the dip" because they are mostly liquidated through the recent shift to leverage. This is a similar scenario to the US Great Depression. Then, the price absolutely craters. 


Don't forget inflation, a lot of coins are put in exchanges for sell, that also cause the price dip if just a few people buy. 
> google trends for bitcon is DOWN

It might be because bitcoin itself is more common knowledge? Personally, I did my googling about bitcoin in December of 2014. I bought bitcoin February 2015, October 2015, January 2017 and December 2017. I didn't have to re-google bitcoin every time bought it.
I'm Iranian (although an atheist) and I can tell you anyone who wanted to get in already got in (and more are coming). People who invest usually don't care about what their religion says, but look for profit instead. This will have positive publicity but don't say that it opened the market to 1.6 billion. Muslims don't care about Halal or Haram when it comes to money. Mostly foods.
I would imagine most muslims who actually have the 'spare' money of any significance to throw into cryptos didn't particularly worry about whether cryptos were 'halal' or not before, but what do I know. 
It's been fine for ages, this is old news.  It won't impact the market in anywhere near the way people seem to think.
1. There's no single authority over all Muslims that can legalize or outlaw crypto, there's no pope in islam. 

2. 99.99% of Muslims that know about crypto do NOT believe it is Haram and never did. 

3. "BTC is crashing because Muslims are cashing out to go to hajj". 

And

"Moon when Ramadan ends"
yea, am pretty sure they are all queuing up to get a piece of this.
That chart it's so noisy. 

But it isn't valid. For starters there was no Adam and Eve there. And the market sentiment was so much different. People really thought it was going to 0 .
0-2 days before a short dip and long climb, if not I feel it will fall again. It won't be flat for long, it never is. At least unless it's determining a bottom.

Price rises with BTC, overvaluing the alt to its current trading price point. Traders sell at the higher price and repurchase at the lower valued BTC ratio. 
I don't know what surprises you then...
If that were to happen again... oh boy.

What could the strategy be? Try to shake out some other whales so that when they pump the price again it won't be dumped before this particular market maker is ready to take profits? 
so what? do you see 40k shorts to be squeezed? 
Just to be clear I didn't make that chart, the link has been floating around a bit.

Why sell now when it'll be 10k at some point.

Blame yourself but not him. chewtoy is based. 
This reeks of B.S. 

You constantly post nothing but Bullish hopium here. How are we supposed to believe for one second that you would short bitcoin. 

It sounds more like you're trying to discredit another member of the sub because he actually shorts your beloved bitcoin. Weak.
Even the best trader has like a 55&#37; correctness rate on their calls, at most.
So why wasn't it like this before?

The MMs know people have stops and will react in panic to large candles. So they push it w these huge market orders. Call it whatever you want, it's not as enjoyable as it was even n January or february
Under the influence of the ring.  What can I say, manipulation.
Dude thank you for urging me to be patient in my long - you are a real one brotha 
Thanks.  And thank you for posting here.  I always enjoy reading what you have to say.
Well the bottom trendline is at a 24 degree angle and the top trendline is at a 14 degree angle.  I would classify a 10 degree difference between trendline angles as significant; the triangle is not congruent.

So ascending triangle.
he's saying whichever way it breaks will be the breakout or breakdown. I personally think we may just slide out of it sideways 
Yes.
do you think people weren't greedy last time? 

here is a newsflash, the reason people say "BTC did this before" is because this shit is cyclical. You go up, you retrace, you go up a bit more, you dump lower, you go up a bit more, you dump lower...then you find a bottom and consolidate before you go up again to a higher high. 

we haven't had true consolidation yet. There needs to be months and months of it for people to accumulate, to have a big enough portion of BTC in the hands of believers who won't sell when this thing gets to $15K or $20K

Right now we do have a pump going, but its highly likely its just a dead cat bounce after a massive sell off and sooner or later this thing will start heading back down again. Personally I think we'll see $10K before it happens, but then we'll head back down to visit $5K. 

Newbies are patting each other on the back, but you are forgetting that we are still only at $8,300. A few other numbers for perspective:

* 02/06 - $6,000 our current bottom so far
* 02/20 - $11,600 pump from the bottom(we are still quite a bit off from here)
* 02/26 - $9,600 dumped down
* 03/06 - $11,600 pump from the dump
* 03/19 - $7,200 another visit down
* 03/22 - $9,000 bounce up
* 03/31 - $6,500 our "bottom" before this pump
* 04/13 - $6,500 2 weeks of consolidation before the pump started

Essentially if you look at these numbers we were due for a test of $10,000 before the next round of sell offs
> went short sub-$7K
Yes I get that a lot are frustrated at the suddenness and seeming randomness of the rises. But I figured this is how genuine reversals often play out, and is the reason no one believes or trusts them until it’s too late.

If we drop way down from here and end up under 6k tho, I think I’ll give up and bow down to the bears and join the dark side.
Really hard to balance those SL though to be cheap enough but not get double-stopped on volatility.
yes deleted, even his account was, at least that's what I saw
> How low could it possibly go? 

well it was $6800 3 days ago, so it could go pretty low
$300 dollars, and if this whole pump was just a larger DBC (which i suspected it was), we got a long way to go.
> How low could it possibly go?

I’d say no lower than about $2600
This response lacks excellence. Do I need to explain why?
I'm far from having a good knowledge of the markets but I like to read here and observe... Since the beginning of the last few "runs up" am I wrong or this seems to be driven by ethusd? I was looking at volume comparing other big green candle ethusd had vs btc and the ratio of volume for eth seems to be higher compared to btc, does that "mean" it's eth that drive the price up and btc follow? 
I've been using eth as an indicator too. It's really strong lately. Interestingly, the ethbtc ratio only temporarily suffers when btcusd pumps, then ethbtc balances out as ethusd tries to maintain it's price. 

If the ethbtc fails to recover after another btcusd pump, I'll take that as a sign that the rally has faded. 
good point
around 8500 https://www.tradingview.com/x/5WlkqErs
Yes, and currently this is not there and I agree shorting the log resistance breakout point is the best thing here. Now we are in the middle of mid and long term resistance vs support levels
The correction is happening right now, and its direction is upward. There was no reason to dump vast quantities of Bitcoin in February and March. We will see a new ATH by June, and if you're shorting, I hope you're a Jedi because any dips between now and then will be small and short-lived. 

Fundamentally, Bitcoin is sound, and the only TA I need is the round bottomed waves getting progressively bigger since the $6.6K bottom.
Preach brudda
I agree. Nice reward if we go up, but not exactly confidence-building!
Nop, I'm just looking at BB after an insane rise from 6k and squeeze at 16k, previously daily BB's were pretty useless.
looks like it was just a fakeout. Still tells you about market optimism, though.
I'm a little over a third in - I can either just wait for a return to 8200 and break even... or I can increase my leverage and add to my position ;)

But seriously I'm uncertain so I'll probably just hope for this to cool down right now, if we get up to 8.7-8.9 that's where I'm in trouble.
9k+ I’m thinking, yeah
I will not short more than the notional value of my trading stack
I got 8.2 which is the previous old term log support that we broke through on 3/29 ([dotted red line](https://www.tradingview.com/x/TB9H8N5B/)).

[Zoomed in](https://www.tradingview.com/x/5wGaXBjQ/)
8250 is the resistance turned support. I have stops set at 8150 since I think we may dip below 8250 while we consolidate in the 8250-8400 range.
Personally 7800 is the major support to watch for me, in terms of this being a  reversal or not. 
'worked this time'... So you might as well just guess what will happen (which is what it is effectively)
Got some shorts in at 8400, expecting to leave them there for some time
>What happened to your short around $7500? Closed and reopened now, or moved stops up?

$7640? Closed it [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8bwesq/z/dxbprk6) 
Time to get out
Rising wedges are a bearish formation so a pullback is definitely in play if you see it that way.
Loose elliot wave count of 5 waves up to 8218. We retraced to exactly .236 and then moved higher so I am feeling good about this count.
Yea, like I said it's almost hard to believe we are this bullish. That's why I am optimistic, but still pretty cautious. Very excited to see what happens when we hit that log line.
We need lots of BITCOIN BITCOIN BITCOIN kind of hype.

We're a way off from that.
I'M IN HYSTERIA NOW
Middle of the day where I am.
I totally see where you're coming from, and I agree to a large extent. But that was almost a text book bull flag being played out. I know RSI has been oversold, but that does not have to be significant.

It definitely seems like a lonely player acting here, but it's _not_ entirely irrational. Or am I missing something?

Edit: it’s NOT entirely irrational.
I understand the frustration, but why now? If you take the last two months, hasn't it been the same always, especially the bullish parts? Take 18-24th of March for example. The main movement always comes in big spikes, which are most likely somewhat manipulative in nature. I kinda thought this is something you always take into account when trading bitcoin.

Or do you feel its gotten worse now?
Yeah this random spike shit is annoying as hell and it's the reason I'm staying out of position. 

This market is nonsensical now. 
lol good guesstimate. 
8578000.00 KRW :: 8014.00 USD
For sure, the bottom can be drawn much tighter
these fakeouts are ridiculous 
Or the boogey man was involved. I heard he had a deal with a huge whale and they split the profits under my bed. 
You made the right analysis, don't let the downvotes bother you. That's why I remained confidently underwater, thinking shorting from 8100 or 8400 didn't matter much in the grand scheme of things and I'd miss the better entry sleeping or w/e anyway. 

Now let's see where this takes us, above 7.6 bullish, below 7.2 bearish imo. 
Eh..
It's been the weekend.  Let's see what happens tomorrow when the big boy markets open up.  Things are looking green right now in the futures but with all the geo-political crap who knows how things will play out. 
You're right but within the dynamism, any new longs would have been opened above where we currently are.
Thanks but props for the overlay go to u/joyrider5 for posting it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8bwesq/daily_discussion_friday_april_13_2018/dxa9hl5/)

4h intervals
lmao that went dark quick
Ok, but since this is a bitcoin sub we should use a bitcoin farm as an example, so to get started how deep and how far apart do I plant my bitcoins?
Thanks for the real life example, hot dogs or dog food would have been cool too but I guess Cotton works 
So, how is this significantly different than holding in fiat?
Would you have to open a short position against the entire value of your cold storage? 
I dont have cold storage so 0 hedging for me
https://imgur.com/a/rlZOn (4 hr)

I have it drawn as the log line connecting the september crash to the 6k crash using bitcoinwisdom so I can snap the line to the exact bottom of those wicks.

I will say that it's not like it's a line in the sand. It's more of a band/zone that's heavy resistance, possibly due to people like you and me having it drawn slightly differently. We're probably dealing with it here at 8.275k as well.
> Every pump and dump frustrates a normal trader and causes a certain percentage of them to trade into fiat one last time and cash out.

Yup, I'm getting close to cashing out and leaving forever/until there is a next bull run/we hit $3k for a few months then start to climb up again.

I agree with all of your comment wholeheartedly

So if history repeats itself ( aka 14 hours ago ) we are looking at a 200-300$ price increase. 
You saying we're about to have a little dump? Or a big pump? :)
yup, I've been avoiding trading since the Bitcoin spike as its been all over the place. The most I've done is start to hedge my exposure to Bitcoin as its looking a tad precarious.
[removed]
I make sure to cover Bitcoin first and foremost in all the analyses I post here.
I would agree. If your trade didn’t play out in the timeframe you aimed at, and you’re still in profit, then personally I would take that profit home.
What exactly do you mean? That you are taking a longer-term position?
> you had 50% chance to be right. Today, there is 25% chance your observation still valid. 

Nope, still a 50% chance. Like a coin flip, the chance of landing on heads is the same no matter how many times you got tails previously.
What does it have to do with me being right, mate?

The focus should be on the technical analysis feature on TradingView. Now we know that, at least, you shouldn’t trust it blindly. 
I have it higher, at ˜8850 right now:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/52Nm8BwJ/

I agree that even a decisive break won't necessarily imply the end of the bear market. New downtrend lines can be formed, as we all have seen in the past month or so.
This depends, if this resistance turns to support again, and we will hold out the next wave of profit taking, then this might verry well be the end of the bear market 
That's also what I've been seeing. Plenty of alts decoupled and have been rising steadily with or without Bitcoin. 

That's not to say Bitcoin tanking wouldn't tank most of the alts as well, but I think we might be seeing a new shift in the dynamic of alt to btc.
I know, but change ETH to BTC and I make the same mistakes on the same proportional price moves. 
Dude, you just don't think we will retrace at all? We have retraced pretty much every rise, even in the last bubble. 
*I've had about 50% success rate entering on dildos, still not sure if its a good idea.*


Not the data we need, but the data we deserve.
a new cycle will not play out in 6 months even in crypto
Nah they're both signs of a heavily manipulated low liquidity market. It takes potential ww3 to move gold 2% but it takes a medium sized whale to move bitcoin's price by 3% with no unexpected news to speak of. Take a step back and let it sink in how troubling a sign that is. 
But there has been many opportunities for both bears and bulls.  Its been like a perfect market to benefit both with predictable runs and crashes.   If you didn't make money that's on you. 
Went back and listened to some old episodes on YouTube last night. Forgot how perfect his voice was for radio and telling stories.

Ah, you know. Same old, same old...
only back with the trading stack for now since I still expect this thing to go down after the rally is over
Sorry, why's wardser so famous? Noob greentoe cryptoboy here
I believe Bitcoin is a speculative play. Which means its a game of musical chairs until the entire crypto market disappears. 

Which is why I got out of my long term stack and went all cash at $17,500 while everyone else was waiting for $100,000. 

And just because I recognize the manipulation, doesn't mean I can't make a little bit of profit along with the whale while he does all the heavy lifting 
oh yeah. Pretty much the easiest way to spot that the top is in, is when we get a giant red candle similar to the giant green candle we had that started this whole thing 
On what time frame? It's definitely going over $10K. It's just a question of when. You'd have to be crazy to think otherwise. Shorting is a bad idea for the next couple weeks. The guy who's been dumping on us for three months has a lot of coins to cover.
Of course it could. 
I see what you did there
Im in this camp...
I'll probably exit above $8,500 or so. 
Saved your ass from what? So far it's dropped less than .5% from my entry. 
He'll feel raw, alright.
Mostly RSI. 

Bearish divergence on the 1h - 6h, and the 6h has just been absolutely absurd for the duration of this move. 
I always reference spot for my entries. 

June futures was trading in the vicinity of $8,260 when i entered. 
It's just under 50D MA. Thought that 8500 may have been a little optimistic so put in just under. I don't usually get entries that close but I did stop sell a long @ 4970(BFX ATH) and short 19.1K on similar logic of just taking entries slightly below big round numbers looking at key areas. Also fib retracements are usually really good for entries. You need some basic TA and a decent amount of luck, it helps to have limits orders a few % over and under the current price for spikes either way.
I realized it was off a few times but didnt realize it was that off. I'm going to have to switch to using TV or CW more often I think. Thanks
Did Einstein send you $100 btc and did your wife and cat clap?
Yesm but he is right - the question is the scope. Germany for example says per portfolio (broker account), so you can have some long term holdings in one, and trade the same stock/currency/whatever in a separate account.
I might add some more btc to my portfolio later today so yes there is.
There might be one more pump left in this one sloppy, they're getting weaker though. You ready to short 8.5 and get fed a perfect entry by all the weak bears with stops around there? 
At least try and pretend your analogy has some substance to it. 
or it was another part just like the one from 2 days ago.
This is why not a single major index is using bitfinex. 
Good point. Notice how it already did it once this bear market too, though.

I agree there are definitely some bullish signs that this could be the push we break through the ATH resistance; just trying to keep the bad looking daily chart in mind so playing it cautious until that actually happens.
I'm not on an exchange that offers leverage. Not a fan of Kraken's or Poloniex's fees and others aren't available in the USA.

So instead I buy/sell with my entire crypto stack, mostly just looking for a great long term entry. I've been bought in since 7.2k and happy with that entry so even if I'm leaning a bit bearish medium term I won't be selling until some of the bearish signs actually play out (which is what you should do anyway). 
It's essentially a derivative of the RSI so it can somewhat show as a second derivative of the price. By it's nature it swings much more quickly than anything else, and so provides many more signals than some indicators. But it also provides more false signals too. The common advice I've seen is to only consider the crossings of the ema with the actual value in the overbought in a downtrend and the oversold in an uptrend.

4 hr is a shorter time frame than the daily, so a possibile outcome would be a short bounce up to the log support turned resistance or the daily bband. Maybe even farther who knows? The daily stoch could continue avoiding the crossing for a bit longer in that case. It could also mean nothing and be a false signal, which would indicate to me the daily crossing may be a signal to pay close attention to.
I haven't been shorting this, it's starting to look like a genuine short/medium term reversal now. 
Over elaborate? Lol. Yes because 1000s of normal people all decided to buy a single BTC within a few minutes of each other. It is more likely that a single person bought that much within a few minutes. 
Soros shorted from 19k in silence. Then suddenly declares after a nice 80% gain , NOW i will enter the market
how long before "new paradigm" again?
This is really looking like the denial phase,  but this time it's the bears not the bulls
let's say the chance is 50/50... the best idea would be buying now and in 1-2 weeks. nobody would regret longterm
Tick tock
No, it's going somewhere fast [soon](https://snag.gy/uvGzYl.jpg). 
Hard to say because bitcoin doesn’t always operate with momentum (ex: this jump to $8k was sudden and is now staying there)
I do agree, but I have made 11% return by longing without leverage since April 1 and I'm happy for that. The point I was trying to make was use stop limits and nobody has spend all this time and energy worrying about these dumps.
Look back at Oct-Dec 2017 this rise is nowhere near the same in momentum. The debate here shows that. I have doubts it will hit 10k because there is no commitment to it. 
I do realize that. I came into this in January, didn't know a damn thing and got left holding the bag. Sold on the way down and made 85% of my losses back in March longing where possible with stops. There are a lot of very smart people here, much more than I.
I am not. You can read more in the last half of this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ccvku/daily_discussion_sunday_april_15_2018/dxfk7ia/

They destroyed 30 million 1 time. During every bear market. During the times when other exchanges had so many people cashing out they could not process all the withdrawals and had to increase withdrawal fees, etc. They destroyed 30 million only under a lot of media criticism. And then, shortly there after, they printed a whole bunch more.

Even if they have the money it is questionable whether they can even redeem a tether. The accounts that bitfinex / tether used in poland utilized a bank associated with working with the colombia drug cartel. Bitfinex promised to give an official statement on this last week, but failed to deliver it by the time they did and instead tried to delete all references to the bank seizure and bank association.

None of it is provable, but as the saying goes "where there is smoke there is fire" and with tether/ bitfinex there is a LOT of smoke.
You can see korean and non-korean prices here and see there is a discount. The discount fluctates, but it exists: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/#markets

Historically, south korea always led the bull and FOMOed the hardest.
What is the unsubstantial claims. 1-4 are easily verifiable with the 3rd parties implied in the claims. 5 is not provable, but is likely correct since this time period started the first phase of the FOMO last year.

6 while highly controversial in this sub is not provable true. However, there is a lot of evidence that when links together forms a picture that makes it likely and it certainly cannot be proven false which it should be provably false according to the tether white paper due to the audits they were supposed to have that they never did do. For example, tethes own white paper says they would conduct "frequent audits" of which 1 has neve been done. The one audit they employed had the relationship ended for asking too many questions. Strange that you can see /r/bitstamp and other exchange forums of people all talking about fiat withdrawals, but there has essentially NEVER (1 30 million time after a lot of bad publicity of tether) been a net-withdrawal of tether (where withdrawals are more than deposits and thus cause token destruction according to their own white paper).

Lastly, the bank they stored a substantial portion of money in just got busted for working with the colombia drug cartel, so whether or not those funds are frozen or not is highly suspect. Bitfinex was supposed to have an official response to the incident, but failed to provide one despite saying they would.
I mean, he's literally explained why he believes what he does. I can understand why you'd be reluctant to believe him but if you are then please explain why you disagree.
I agree with you that whales have turned into a boogey man. However, in many cases, it certainly is one group of people. When you see the volume go up 100x on a single minute candle compared to the previous minute, it is more and more likely it was not the coincidence of 1000s of unrelated people all hitting market orders at the same time and is instead a smaller group of people coordinating.

There literally have been telegram groups for pumping (coordinated groups that function as a whale). Real whales / pump groups are not that unsophisticated and they have a lot of money and astroturf reddit too.
Yup, was really surprised how it's really slowing down a bit. I'll admit the pump today did catch me off guard though.
Hope you sold before the 2k market sell. More selling will be incoming if you didn't, so no worries.
But gold can be worn as jewelry. You can't wear your bitcoin. That'd just look stupid.
It's not unique, though. There are plenty of cryptocurrencies.
> So long as that does exist - the price can continue to climb

Price is meaningless without liquidity. If liquidity doesn't rise with price then you'll never be able to sell for the price listed on paper.

> We've 'corrected' to a much lower price, TX volume declined but that iirc that decline is tapering off, and we also have this recent rebound

This recent rebound was from two sets of whale buying. More likely it's whales trying to game the market in one manner or another than new money coming in.
Store of value isnt a use case by itself. What value does it store? Purchasing power? No because nobody uses it. Fiat value? Clearly not, just ask the millions of people that bought after BTC went mainstream (and yes it has gone mainstream as an investment asset, anyone claiming we're in the same place the internet was in the 80's or some shit is beyond delusional).
China's already banned crypto.

> decentralised payments would become popular to really utilize crypto

Not likely. I don't know *anybody* that was consistently using bitcoin to pay for small purchases last year (or even this year). The only ones that used it in large purchases were high end merchants which will take *any* form of payment if they can move it. Sure the Ferrari dealership will take bitcoin, they'll also take gold bars. But I'm pretty sure no regular store will take a gold nugget as payment.
[deleted]
Yeah, but that's pretty common when volume starts drying up.
The price slowly creeps up until volume pops up again and dictates which direction we move next. 

On a pump from BFX, not from cash.

The volume rose on BFX while it was equal or less (from the prior 2 weeks) on GDax and Stamp. This would be described as a tether pump (I think?).
You realize that was one whale's movement, right? Totally organic. /s
Gold has massive liquidity as 50% of it is used in some sort of commerce or physical product.

Bitcoin has none of that. It could have a trillion dollar valuation but if there's only $1B in cash, then you're not going to get more than $1B out of the damned thing.

Paperwealth is 100% meaningless. All that matters is how much you can get for it when it comes time to sell.
I'd say the thesis is that it could become the closest thing to digital gold, not that it already is. It's pretty obviously not, so far.
Continued volatility?

Exactly how much volatility is needed to prove it isn't digital gold?
> It's bias at its max and is COMPLETELY unhealthy for a finance trading forum. It deters from productive and insightful discussion.

In what universe is the comment that you're white-knighting on behalf of in the realm of "productive and insightful" discussion? When you break it down, it's just a low-content low-effort tired cliche devoid of anything other than an appeal to gut feeling about what the commenter expects to happen.
huh? that OP you are so valiantly defending is adding nothing to the conversation. Clearly there are more uses for BTC than just hoarding and having that as the sole reason why BTC will decline is very low effort. Looks like both of you are getting rekt shorting. Do yourselves a favor and start buying asap
Asking about scaling problems will probably get you banned in r/bitcoin

That's why we had $50 fees during the runup in Nov-Dec, right? That's why we had capped tx's and long transfer times, as well, right?

What a peculiar response. How does that apply to everyone?

Of course scaling isn't an issue right now as fees are non-existent and blocks aren't being filled. I'm looking at this long-term, so we don't have another late 2017 fiasco and instead be ready for mainstream adoption and won't be rejected again.

In terms of use, it 100&#37; is. In terms of speculation, i'd agree.

No one is that dense to believe that holding is 100&#37; guaranteed money. The most reasonable holders will tell you is that it's a safer bet than trading and has a good chance of making it.

It's the most decentralized of all cryptocurrencies in terms of governance and developers by a country mile. 

> A huge portion of the tokens are controlled by few people 

Early adopters have more coins. Not something remotely unique to btc. 
Points 2-4 are spot on, point 1 is hard to say either way. I do think Bitcoin is less likely to be widely adopted than crypto in general and am going to be looking primarily at a handful of alts once this bear is fully satiated.
Poe's law.
> normal markets

Which this is not. 
Basically I agree with you but I think that panic selling is basically guaranteed, so it's going to be hard to maintain any support within the BGD range. People who bought in during the BGD weren't staking out long term positions, they were looking for a quick buck. Somehow I don't see them taking a principled stand or going down with the ship.
Let's not forget 6-11.8k, I remember you and I lost several trades in a row because of that shit lmao. 
Whenever I feel FOMO, I go over to /r/Buttcoin and waste a few hours getting told how stupid I am for believing in something that has gone up in value an average of $80 every month, since 2012.  I'm currently talking to someone that said bitcoin is a failure because nobody wants to spend it because it's deflationary, and nobody wants to accept it because of its volatility. 
the pumps and dumps aren't an issue for people hodling/not margin trading. it's an issue for people in this sub because we're gambling. 

and I don't know what's up with people calling this the end of bitcoin because it dumped $200? thousands of developers are working on the infrastructure. institutions are buying in. traders and MSM will start talking up the next halving later this year. let's not lose our heads just yet.

GDAX changed the UI a bit last week.  It shows a fee for Stop / Limit orders but you are not charged a fee if it posts as a limit order.  If some or all of the order cross the spread, then you are charge a fee.  My experience has been about 50% of my Stop / Limit orders are free and the other 50% cross the spread.
No I didn't. Ive been in a position since last week. Had a stop limit order in last week which had zero fee. Just cancelled it and tried putting a new one in and now it shows a fee....
The "Stop" is the trigger price for both buying and selling.  When the stop is reached, you automatically place your limit order for x price.

Thus a BTC stop limit buy order right now could be; Stop= 8300, Limit= 8310. (If Bitcoin goes above 8300, you want to buy for 8310.)

A stop limit sell order could be; Stop= 8200, Limit= 8190. (If Bitcoin drops below 8200, sell for 8190.)
It's not my rule I believe. From what I have seen in crypto (including alts) back to 2013, after a bear market you got a slow steady rise in price that increase in speed as it goes up. You don't get a sustained crazy pump with almost no retracement, it's the contrary; slow -> fast, not fast -> slow, giving a bear divergence. 
nothing, there was hidden walls at $8100 last night too
You know what, you may be right. Still think it's most likely just a bull trap but you definitely might be right about this. 
Genuine question, if everyone thinks it's a suckers rally, who is actually buying them lol
My own bias is to make money and Bitcoin green dildo'ing all the way to 1m each would be great, I just don't see that that's a real possibility right now. 

Anyways, cryptokeepers comments might have some validity. I'll have to adjust my market outlook. 
There was a recent BNB speculator dump, possibly to USDT with nowhere to go. This may of helped. As in an hour ago.
Thanks
That's the first big sell wall we've had in weeks, right?
yea, sure, but this is not what the market used to look like. This does not look like the genuine FOMO buying from January and earlier

You're describing what we already know. We know it's a stop hunt, it's just that it doesn't really inspire much confidence in the asset (for me)
Yeah, our bitcoin bus is running at some high speed on that highwhay.
The question is, what's the name of the driver? 
I think "volume" and "traders" are passengers here, not driving it at all.
Next question is, do you trust the driver?
Yeah, i know, it was a bit of a rhetorical question. It's 1min chart, you have totally flat volume/volatility for hours, and then at the top of the channel, very close to an upper resistance someone buys 2500BTC in 1min filling the order book upwards to 8350? Imho it's a really dumbo move unless that "someone" plans to dump somewhere higher imho.
Yes, it can be a healthy event. Maybe that was it's intention. Looking for feedback. Thanks!

Well I'm keeping the bets smaller now but I guess I can't disagree. The answer is FOMO of course. 
I'd guess that's why he's asking the question. Trying to learn as he watches the charts. Wish there were more people like chewy and sloppy who obviously try to help.
Last high on Bithumb was 100$ lower as stamp... nothing special here.
Bots

If the price is low on exchange A and high on B, you can buy BTC on A, send it to B and sell it for more money (and then send the money back to A and repeat). This is called arbitration and increases the price on A and lowers it on B until the gap is closed. In reality this is done by bots who do it 1000x faster than any human could. As soon as there is a profitable gap somewhere it is automatically closed by these bots.
bots performing arbitrage
arbitration bots.
Say you have access to all the exchanges. If one has the lowest price you’d buy there, if one has the highest price you’d sell there. Many people doing this causes the price to be pretty much level. Obviously there are other factors involved like commissions and withdrawal rules etc. also everyone doesn’t have access to every exchange but you get the idea. 

Oh and bots (trading programs) do this mostly instead of actual people. 
Of course you're right, lets be generous and say there is 5x the amount of liquidity as the orderbook suggests prima facie. That is still very miniscule. 


Not trading the orderbook, obviously those numbers will fluctuate as we move towards or away from them and there are likely hidden buy and sell walls all over the place. Nonetheless, liquidty is very poor for BTC. Its just a fact lmao
Didn't say we're going up or down from here, just pointing out the horrible liquidity that BTC has and why it should not be compared to gold yet (poor liquidity and high volatility) and probably never should (artificially low supply, 21m supply limit is as arbitrary as it gets).
I remember people saying those exact comments in the early days, no volume, no one is interested, this will never take off...and then we saw what happened

What you don't seem to appreciate is that market sentiment can change in a heartbeat in crypto

But that's not even touching on the fact that no order book is reliable to trade from

You're right, of course. I guess a better word would be 'surge'? I guess I'm just used to it going down so much that bounce has become my default term for a green candle. 
If you throw a ball to the ceiling, it bounces off it. If there is no ceiling it keep going up (until gravity)
It works both ways and resistance is a ceiling

Bitcoin needs a certain number of new entrants, constantly. The reason being that not every hodler can hold forever. At some point they lose a job, lose faith, need to pay down debt, want to buy their first house, etc.

So, there is a constant supply of coins from mining (miners need to pay ongoing electricity cost at a minimum) and more people will want to sell as they reach the 1 year holding period and due to life events encouraging them to sell or simply because a range bound bitcoin is too boring to hold.

I would say the supply / demand ratio in the mid term is not looking good for the price.
It also depends how many of the whales are traders vs buy & hold investors.
I agree it is unlikely there will be a new FOMO event. A lot of the "Holders" of bitcoin are actually traders. Add up all the traders together who are buying / selling on any given time (swing trading) and it amounts to a lot of bitcoin being "held" due their aggregate buy-ins.

The lower liquidity and more whale dominated market will turn off traders, which removes them from the "hold" pool as they sell for fiat one last time and quit trading.

In addition you have non trader holders who will sell due to life events and who will sell because a range bound bitcoin is boring. It's easy to hold when it always goes up. It's harder to hold when it trades like a US treasury bill.

Lastly, governments and media and even private companies are slowly turning more and more negative against bitcoin. You see this with new enforcement actions, central bank bans, bans in advertising, increased KYC pressure which creates buying friction, etc.
No, because "bitcoin" cover people searching for price, news, etc. When price goes up and people want to look up the price or find the news for the cause, then they use keywords that use bitcoin. 

So, when bitcoin goes down in the trends it is a good indication there is just less people following it, period.

Thanks for your insight!

Well seems like no one cares about anything when it comes to money.
while I agree with that I wonder if it'll affect the middle-east corporate markets. The big banks there do care an awful LOT about financial product being compliant with Sharia law.

Look at London and see how lots of financial products were made (or renamed) to work with Sharia Law (ie: bonds/sukuk: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukuk )

Arabs investing in crypto is bullish since they have lots of money and little brain. And also oil price is about to boom again. Lots of income is coming to there hands.
how is this an Adam and eve lol 
yep.  totally invalid.  theres not even an adam and eve.  nothing alike in any conceivable way really.
The main reason I think it will hang is the historical volume on the recent jump.  When that happens you never see it go back down fast.  In the 2014 bubble it was hanging for about a week so its a possibility, but it usually doesn't happen that way and it's been faster to drop in this bear market.

Not convinced. BTC going up does not change the Satoshi value of alts. When BTC price is going up, people are in BTC not fiat/tether. Alts are valued based on btc. You mean people gauge alts based on dollar value instead of Satoshi value?
consider I am holding from 2013  , nothing can surprise me anymore .
It was still inspirational.

With the same logic, why were there so many sales at under 7K?
Not fudding lol. Chill

Don't even bother with these people trying to act like this is just how things have always been. I try to take all perspectives into consideration, but I'm genuinely perplexed by that view. I honestly think a lot of them just started trading like last week so they don't know? 
No problem, I'm glad it worked out for you brotha
Even bears are capable of acts of goodness ;)
Thanks, that means quite a bit. I appreciate that a lot

Grats again, be greedy but not too greedy :) 
but this time it's different ™
If it's a reversal than there's plenty of upside available. I'll never understand the "it's gonna be too late!" line of thinking in context of reasonably small moves.

First big short entries will probably be at log resistance from ATH. It's low enough now that the market might hesitate only slightly. Good pullback entry there, maybe as low as $500 - $1000 below the contact point. If it stays alive then long with medium leverage.

After that, I'd just hang on to take profit at $12k, and long the pullback (with a bullish bias) on lower leverage.

That's my game plan anyway.
Yeah, I’ve tried to straddle positions on occasion  w/ BTC and it always ends in liquidation of both positions and a fat green dildo...
That's a shame. I generally enjoy it when people rant about how awful I am. 
I believe it can help. 
Eth rose to 530 again but btc is staying still... My short is not liking this movement from eth. Better close it for a small profit.... 
Ethusd seems to hit a resistance line now. If it breaks upward 535 with conviction could be trouble for bears (short term, don't think eth has enough fire power to drag btc up, only to nudge it one direction or another in indecision times) 
You're cutting all sorts of stuff. It's 8900ish: https://www.tradingview.com/x/PIwi4dAI/
I've been saying it's a worthless endeavor to short before the log resistance for days. 

A lot of bear ammunition was spent just to get rekt before the most prime entry was reached. 
Just opened up a mini guy at 8110 because YOLO. 
I wouldn't add to that losing position right now.
Thanks. I'm just starting to learn and didn't realize that was the resistance/support. Knowing that I would've left my short @ 8.2 open instead of closing it at 8.33, could've got closer to breaking even. Oh well. I'm pleased I pretty much called the exact time of this breakout based on the triangle I drew last night, but boy did I guess the direction wrong. I'm not bearish per se but did think we were due for a retrace sooner rather than later. Need to reevaluate my bias I guess.
Yeah I've been out since an average of 8300. Not sure what I'm targeting now, interested to see how the market responds to this flash dump.
Im seeing what i see right now is highs and lows climbing at a similar rate. Which means there is no predictable breakout point. Probably up , with later retrace if we break log resist, or down if we dont.
I'm starting to see 100-250k price predictions again these days, people are working on it
Maybe he's European then! Probably since Bitfinex is not really used by Americans
it was more like an ascending triangle, really. The target would be like $9k 
I haven't been around during the low volume periods before November 2017, so I don't remember what it looked like really. 

I'm probably just being emotional but I really do need a break again regardless. My short was successful but not nearly as much as it couldve been if not for the largest green 1h candle we've seen in months. That just kind of annoys me. 

Lots of this sudden buying and selling is just ridiculous. Very inorganic compared to even a few months ago in Feb or January. 

I just want to enjoy my life again. 

Like I said will come back on lower leverage most likely :) 
'Random spike shit'.  We had 24 hours of selling yesterday, we fell $20. 

The good traders sold at $20k, they are either now back in, or coming back. 
Closed my long yesterday because i wanted to sleep... I never get lucky. 
0 volume for days then 2.5k btc bought in one minute.

Literally 1/3 of daily Gdax volume in 1 minute. 

this "market" is a joke, lol 
Just my opinion but whatever the motivation behind this random spike shit is . . it is helping motivate some to commit to turning the bear around.  
Sloppy, you short? Feels a lot like it will drop. Small hedge can’t hurt, no?
It is Monday asia time and for a large portion of bitcoin's history and even in the last bull run to $20k the asian market was the "big boy market".

Asia monday volume is thus far lower than asian sunday volume.
Thanks, much appreciated.

Avoid short-term capital gains taxes, if you're in the US. This way you can hold them long enough so that they're taxed at the long-term rate instead.
You dont have to sell all your coins. 
Not much, except you aren't exposing yourself to third party risk with the majority of your bitcoins so you can keep those in your cold storage without having to move them.

Instead you expose yourself to funding fees and such so there's some tradeoffs.
>So, how is this significantly different than holding in fiat?

It isn't significantly different. There are benefits for larger traders and those with tax implications.
If you want to hedge the whole thing, yes. Of course you can use leverage so you only have to put up a fraction of the fiat that your coins are worth.
Same boat. The lifestyle of watching your position 24/7 isn't worth it
these def are pump n dumps. My point is that money can still be made from them as they'll only pnd under certain circumstances revolving around indicators
Pump 200-300 bucks.

Interestingly, it looks like it's just continuing the equilibrium pattern, so we could be here a while yet before a break.
Feel free to post Bitcoin commentary. If it's not focused on Bitcoin it doesn't belong in this sub.
Yes, a bearish one.
right but what he means is there's a 25% chance his observation is valid twice in a row :P
Sure, doesn't mean people won't be miserable. They're used to holding  and making money.

When they realize trading a bear market (and a relatively heavily manipulated one at that) is much more difficult than trading a bull market (buy the dip, hodl or sell the blow off tops), they will take their profits from 2017 and leave. 

Just my 2c 
not true. the market value of the coins drops so your portfolio value drops. Yea if I sell it will be "realized". Plus I have no fiat left to buy lower so now i'm stuck. all bad.
I think the 2nd time around would have been priced in instead and the 'news' was sold.
If you were to trade 25% of your hold stack. (Short term 1-4 weeks) Which would it be buy or sell?

Asking for a friend*
Famous isn't the right word. They posted a lot a while ago. Not as much lately.
He had a lot of savage bearish calls on the ETH/BTC ratio last year and also timed the top of BTC/USD in December. Some of those bearish threads he started in ethtrader were legendary. One guy against the world it seemed like.
Oh it will definitely reach 10k again, no doubt about it. But that time is not now unfortunately. 
I think the same. Just hedged my trading stack at 8250, and going to set alarms this time.
from clenching *really* hard during a .5% drop
super YOLOd on ETH. Literally 100% of my portfolio was in it anticipating a break of 530
You've hit that perfect balance where you got a good laugh out of me but I still downvoted. Well done
Was there not bear div showing before previous green candles or am I misremembering? Seems like a whale could invalidate it at a moment's notice.
Ah gotcha, makes sense. Thanks
Ah, understood.  I misread a little bit of his post.  After re-reading, OP's thought regarding using FIFO and buying / selling a few times was correct -- it would be as if he was trading out of his original stack.  It'd be more beneficial for him to his LIFO in that case.  
My name isn’t sloppy, but I’m ready to short 8.5 if this bull flag breaks up 
lmao yes, i'm looking to short another attempt at $8.5k actually. or even higher. I should've waited, really.

Pumps NEED FOMO in order to work. No FOMO is being created. So, the pumps will break down.
> Notice how it already did it once this bear market too, though.

Ya but look how it's starting to point up and looks bottomed out.   

I agree though, I don't like the daily stoch, but the candles and everything else isn't really screaming top.  We're at the top of the bollinger bands on the daily though which I don't like and I noticed a bear div on the OBV OSC daily.   But those take awhile to kick in, so ya daily still doesn't look bad but there are strong indicators to point for it going either way on the daily for me.  I could see a pullback, or a strong bounce and then pullback, tough call. 
you are in the US? are you aware of the tax implications?
> So instead I buy/sell with my entire crypto stack

Damn, bold move, you seem like a smart trader so I'm sure you'll be fine but that's a large stack to be playing with. 
if you say that, then it's a bull trap or ? A bull trap is when no one expects it. or the sucker rally ? if 8200 holds we know 
How many normal people are in this reddit thread right now?

How many in bitmex troll box?

1000s is likely not a terrible estimate for the amount of traders that watched this spike. Especially considering the global nature of these markets.

Just pointing that out. I don’t comment on whale theories as I can’t prove or disprove.
It fits my description of the last trip to goblin town as a reverse bubble.
we went from $6.8k to $8.4k on shorts closing and one dude buying 2.5k btc in 1 minute. do you actually genuinely believe this is the reversal? That there is genuine demand? 

Like come on, the charts look absolutely ridiculous. none of this looks like real buying, it's just hedged shorts getting stopped out and some dude throwing a shit ton of money at the market 
How is it denial? Where is the demand that will move the price up? There's one reason and one reason only we are up here right now and that was because of the short squeeze. We literally had 10s of thousands of BTC shorted and had to be covered. If you look at this one current candle pushing us up it is on very low volume. That will result in a bearish divergence on the RSI. We are at the top of the daily BBs and are always rejected by it. We can ride them up for a little while but moving above them and staying above them is never sustainable. We also still need to see if the market wants to be up here, aka going back to find support and making a trend line out of it. Moving up without finding support makes long term investments very, very risky.
>this is a suckers rally
That looks like a rocket to me 
7k it is then!
Of course a move here won't have the momentum of a parabolic bull run approaching peak levels. That's a terrible comparison. Not saying this move will go on and is the true return to bull (who the hell knows, really), but saying that it's not cus it's not the same momentum as late 2017 was is just silly. 
> Lastly, the bank they stored a substantial portion of money in just got busted for working with the colombia drug cartel, so whether or not those funds are frozen or not is highly suspect. Bitfinex was supposed to have an official response to the incident, but failed to provide one despite saying they would.

LMAO 
I mean, I don't entirely disagree with you. There definitely have been (and probably still are) pump-and-dump groups that have successfully manipulated smaller altcoins. And I'm sure some try funny business with the Bitcoin markets, too. It's just incredibly *hard* to do well. What people don't realize is that whales can't just force the market in a certain direction. The reason a 500 BTC buy can set off a pump is that the market was ready for it, sentiment-wise and in regards to a variety of other factors. I addressed this in the Daily a few days ago. Whales setting off a market movement can get it horribly wrong and be stuck in a terrible position that's hard to unwind as a result. A noticeable example was when we were drawing that large bear flag a week or two ago, and one whale tried to make the whole "bear flag surprise break upwards" thing happen, and it didn't happen. All it made was a large wick with no follow-through from other traders, and the market actually broke *down* a few minutes later after it saw the weakness on the buy side as a result of that attempt.

> When you see the volume go up 100x on a single minute candle compared to the previous minute, it is more and more likely it was not the coincidence of 1000s of unrelated people all hitting market orders at the same time

I make a version of that argument regarding walls, but there it actually makes sense. In your case, I have to disagree. It's not that they all hit market orders at the same time, it's that they hit market orders in response to each other, and usually at key TA points. Why do bear flags break down? How do traders know how to sell all at once? They don't. It starts with a few traders convinced it'll go down who want to sell while the selling is good, followed by a few more that see the selling starting, followed by a whole busload who see the selling and all experience fear and want to get out before it drops $300.

> astroturf reddit too

That's a total, complete waste of time.
Yep, it was surprising, but these small % pumps are really nothing. People keep shrugging we're off more that 50% from. Ath. 
Holy shit!!! I sold a fucking minute before that. You literally saved my balls man thank you so much.

'This recent rebound was from two sets of whale buying.'

Said with such authority when you, like everyone else, has no proof whatsoever 
You completety missed my point by focusing on 3 examples I came up with in 10 seconds...
Every single one of us wrangles with what the hell bitcoin is worth.  That is the game.  You can easily provide countless arguments either way.   you can try to compare it to other things but it is like nothing else.  It is pure game theory.  All anyone can really say is this.  Bitcoin is worth something between 0 and a lot and as of today it functions.  I can buy it and sell it for around 8 grand right now.  It is going to be something else in a month but I can’t say what.  No one can.  They can take a guess.  If this guy is convinced it is overvalued he should be shorting.  Fact is he doesn’t know any better than anyone else.   Bitcoin is worth something because it is being hoarded so it is overpriced?  Is that the argument?  Tell me about gold.  It is being hoarded.  If even more people come in and hold bitcoin it could get more scarce and valuable or people could lose confidence and dump it.  The argument is pointless because you could say the same exact thing all through bitcoins history.   People said the same shit when it was $10 or $100.

I am the very opposite of a white knight, I piss on white knights lol.
It's not OP but the overall sentiment of the daily threads. Read what I actually wrote.

>Do yourselves a favor and start buying asap

It's gonna be funny when you lose all your money.
Prove it
It will get you banned in both r/Bitcoin and r/BTC, unless you're agreeing with their viewpoints. There is no debate or discussion, they are both just echo chambers.

Either way, this is definitely not the sub for that debate anyway.
That's not a bitcoin sub.
School me then since your so technically inclined. 
LOL. This is NOT a bubble. 
Once speculative interest dies off there won't be any scaling issues. I mean, who's using Bitcoin except those sending it to and from exchanges? 
It was just a random Wikipedia page.
That is a really weird looking pattern, and such short time frames are generally less reliable. On the 2hr chart it looks more like [a bear flag](https://speedtrader.com/how-to-trade-flag-patterns/).
[removed]
> In terms of use, it 100% is. In terms of speculation, i'd agree. 

Well, if you are measuring use as a currency it is more "early adopter phase" today than it was 2 years ago. Adoption has declined. Not sure if that is a positive thing or not.... Depends on your perspective I guess.
From which you can conclude, surprise... Almost there... That it's manipulated, and has nothing to do with organic growth. So it can as well dump violently and suddenly.
Sure, but that's not something that you or I can control. What we can control is our positions and react according to the movements of the market. 
Yep lol lost a lot trying to short that
people are just tired of the random dildos. I don't know what yall are confused about. 


Before you didn't have to watch the charts 24/7 to baby a position. now you  have to lest you get dumped or pumped on, anywhere from 5-15% in an hour 
This lacks excellence.

Yeah, I'm wondering if it will actually charge the fee though.
Interesting. I've always thought that you could only make limit buy orders if the price is dropping and limit sells if the price is rising. By your description, you can make limit buys when the price is rising and sells when the price is falling for no fees? 

If that's possible, why not just make it so that stops in general don't charge a fee since it's basically the same thing (targeting a number and adding/dumping crypto.
I agree that at least some retracement soon is inevitable.

> Either, we never was in a bear market, this isn't a bull flag or that wasn't the true bottom. 

But i wouldn't say we weren't in a bear market just because of one potential bull flag.  Nor would i conclude anything about bottoms. 

So, I guess hidden walls are less whale trying to influence and more someone legit trying to make a position without messing with the market?
dush the bottom will be boring and sideways for longer than a week- otherwise this market is entirely controlled by a few large players. 

$6.8k to $8.4k was hedged shorts getting stopped out and some dude deciding he wanted 2500 btc *right now*. none of this looks like genuine buying, just stop hunts and tomfoolery.

sure, this could go on for a while. personally I am finding myself less and less interested in it as I realize I'm being played for a fool
Someone with a ton of cash it seems. Possibly people who sold near the top and think we’ve hit the bottom, and are buying back in for a new rally. They might be playing it perfectly if so...
A weird dump moment, can be explained as they're burning part of their tokens in the next few days. I guess they want to buy them back cheaper.
no.
2000 and 1000 btc walls has been flashing on the ask side on finex for weeks. 
I agree that it's not FOMO buying.  I don't necessarily think it's a stop hunt either.  I think basically what you are seeing is seller exhaustion.  Organic selling is mostly gone or is small relative to the steady buying of DCA investors and Bitcoin users.  The only significant selling was leveraged shorting, and that sort of backfired eventually as well.

You still don't have a ton of buyers eating up the ask.  Just steady buying absorbing all available supply until the necessary supply is at a higher price.  But that doesn't mean you will not see more aggressive buying in the not too distant future if more investors and traders believe they see a bottom in the charts.
The driver didn't change . Why did you trust them before?
Gotcha. I guess maybe it could be someone frustrated waiting and just going YOLO.

If I was despicably rich I'd probably do the same.

I took Chewy's advice - I ended up opening my short at 8340 on a feeling. 10 minutes later came the red candle ;)

I got lucky but I'll take it. Wasn't a huge short so it'll only help recover a part of my trading losses from the past week but I'll take it. 
Also, no need to transfer btc between exchanges if you have a stack of usd and btc on both exchanges.
won't withdrawal and deposit take too long to make it profitable even by bots?
Exchanges for most asset classes do not have good liquidity.  That is why you have dark pools and block trading for large orders.  There is demand if you go to specialists and they are popping up all the time to meet this demand (Gemini being the latest large player).  That other guy is playing dumb because he is short.

You're so certain about something you have nothing but your opinion to back, nothing I can say will be considered. You go on believing that, pal.
No problem. Yeah, when it comes to money, all bets are off!
Well, interest on money or loan is Haram according to Sharia Law, so you can see the extent that Sharia Law is "flexible" when it comes to finances:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riba

While Sharia law was not an issue for the wealthy Arab to invest in cryptocurrency, it will create positive publicity and prevent conservatives to land the religious ban hammer. Overall a good news, but not groundbreaking or anything.
6k v bottom is adam, inverse bart at 6.5k is eve. On top of that you can also see a smaller one in april 1 and 6.
Before the current action. Besides , what comes next according to that chart it's just a bunch of flags to me.

And linear downtrend was broken before the big green candle. 
[https://cryptowatch.de/markets/poloniex/eth/btc](https://cryptowatch.de/markets/poloniex/eth/btc)

just watch the ratio, thats easier. its more or less flat over the last days...
I think he’s meaning the ratios rise so they can buy more BTC.  ETH ratio has moved over .007 the last week.
Talking nonsense about gox selling is fudding.
Nothing has happened yet, you might be surprised ;)
Did he whisper in your ear and directly tell you to open a short? 
I think part of it is these people just gained a lot of paper profits from the pumps. Once someone dumps on them they'll get upset again. 



but yes I don't know how anyone is justifying this - the market is completely different now. Who wants to watch a static charts for 7 days straight just to catch that pump or dump that lasts 1 hour out of the week? 
The person you're speaking about has been part of the bitcoin community for years. 

It *is* how it's always been. (I've been around since before the late 2013 bubble.) This has always been a highly manipulated and highly emotional market, with thin books that are easy to shift. It's actually gotten better, believe it or not. I'm not saying it *should* be this way. I think the only way it'll ever fix itself is if it gets bigger and some real, professional, regulated money enters the space. 

Until then you either learn how to deal with the games or you get out into something more reasonable.
believe it or not I want everyone here to make money. if I didn't I'd have said go long at $11.7k and short sub $7k

and I did actually give several people advice to buy sub $8k when they asked 
It is different. The market is huge now compared to 2013. Everyone that knew me back then thought I had lost my mind over Bitcoin. I was putting every free dollar I had into it. Heck, I ended up divorced mostly because of it and boy did it pay off. No one knows what the price will be at any given time, but we all know how scarce it is.
So u keeping ur short open for now? Any specific target in mind?
so ridiculous for someone to complain about you.  you’re the only person on here who is completely transparent, and you are profitable.  Glad you enjoy it though, haha. 
that was too early to judge, you said stops at 8.5, when he posted it was only 8.4, are you still holding that position?
maybe bitmex and bitfinex is different. but yeah bfx is better
I closed my position at a loss. If we retrace to 8200 now I won't be too happy ;)
>I'm pleased I pretty much called the exact time of this breakout based on the triangle I drew last night, but boy did I guess the direction wrong.

Happens to everyone from time to time. I just try to remain 50/50 with fiat/crypto and make sure to set stops based on support and resistance to protect my stacks. 

When the market is trending upwards like this it's a little easier to just set a stop against the dump if you're heavy with crypto and just ride it up. Otherwise, you can scalp these sideways periods until the next move for small profits.
Right, and given that the flag/triangle broke out, I don’t think it’s unlikely we’ll test 9k soon.

Sellers have had several amazing opportunities to dump on the market here, with multiple visits above 8.1k. When sellers aren’t around, low volume continuation patterns happen.

I’m not saying sellers aren’t gonna show up. But there’s nothing surprising with this move above 8.3k in my opinion. I’m also not saying that the bear market it over. But right now the market seemingly have chosen to attempt a test of the descending log trend from 19k, instead of testing 6k again. So a true reversal might be on the table soon.

Thoughts?

Note: Edited my previous reply to you with typo.
Where did you finally close your short?

Regardless of what your decision, let me just say your approach and position was one of the most interesting ones here and you have been an inspiration, at least to me. 

Even though we are "low" now, I still believe we have some falling to do. I've met some people recently IRL who passionately preached summer ATH.. if nothing else, this alone tells me that we are not at the bottom yet. I'd expect the bottom to be a place where people finally let go of the memory of the recent ATH and set realistic new targets for years to come. 
Or the “weak hands handing over their coins to whales” theories were true? Crash the market, get the casuals to sell, make them think it’s all over, then buy back in chunks at bargain prices?

When the volume truly returns and the casuals start buying back in, it’ll already be too late and the whales will be looking to sell again.
And...back to zero volume.
Yeah I would just stop shorting this bro. This is some untradeable manipulated poopoo. 
Hedge anywhere from here to $8500 is smart imo. Even up to $9k really, if it blows past that I'd say all bets are off and we're possibly testing $12k again
Yeah, except asian volume hasn't really been driving the markets lately.

That's a freaking year...
(You pay short-term gains on your short but presumably that will be small relative to the long-term gains in your coins)

Good point.
I'll trade on lower leverage from here on out and make sure I'm not being greedy.. Aside from that this is just getting emotionally exhausting. Watching charts 24/7 even though they do nothing 99% of the time is fucking lame. 
oh yes, I agree to an extent that it's actually somewhat tradable. Just not on high leverage and not without stops/watching the market like a hawk. 
With all due respect, I've specially talked to mods to check these posts are fine several times in the last few months I've been posting them. Has something changed about the rules to make them an issue now?
I'd buy with plans to sell above $10K
Wow.  Yeah that's extraordinarily bad RR right now. Nice wake-up call. 
Yes but it hasnt stopped any green dildos. 
Everyone is welcome to the bear party. Let's hope we get our entry. I've been patient not to short 7.8, 8, 8.1 and now 8.3. 
I got a small one filled at 8425. Rest run up to 8.7 and heavier at the end to account for bull disbelief. 
My crypto stack is only <10% of my entire portfolio, so I'm pretty accommodating of a higher risk level, even compared to straight hodling (rest is in boring index funds and such). You'll still probably see me disappear from here once a bull run really seems to be in full swing as I'll transition to just long term holding.
people can't even react fast enough to buy that quickly man. I see the price go up that fast and I can't even close or open a position quick enough. Bitmex engine is so shit there's no way people are reacting that quickly. it's mainly stops and liquidations
Yes it's not. That is what I said. I was responding to his "we have gone up 31%" comment like this is an insane out of control thing going on. It's not.
> how are you measuring liquidity? and what can be done to increase liquidity?

Liquidity is the overall demand on buy and sell sides. You can measure it by the daily volume on cash exchanges. Since you can't get access to the cash deposit and withdrawal data on those exchanges (to measure cashflows into and out of crypto), you have to use straight up volume * price to get an idea. As speculation goes down, utilization is all that's left. As long as network fees stay low, utilization won't leave.

The way you increase utilization is to increase adoption but you can't increase adoption much further because crypto is an extremely niche product. The benefit it has over fiat and traditional banking is extremely minimal to non-existent in all but a few cases (such as illicit activities).

I love my bitcoin but I have only ever used it to directly pay for things three or four times. Every other time I still use cash cause it's easier, faster, and cheaper.

> I was actually thinking a while back - if liquidity dries up, doesn't that mean there's potentially an opportunity to provide liquidity in the market?

No what you're thinking of is market making. The problem is once you buy it off someone, you have to flip it to someone else, and there's nobody else to flip to so you'd go bankrupt pretty fast. There's a difference between providing *instant* liquidity through open orders (which you can cancel extremely fast as matching orders hit the book) and actual liquidity.
Cause you're trying to make case for why people *should* buy but none of your reasons holds water.

Could some dipshits come in and throw money on the table? Sure but if enough money actually came in, the whales would sell it off and walk with said cash.

You have to assume there are enough smart large scale holders that are ready to sell and just looking for a better price. Give them enough of one, and they'll sure as shit walk.
No you could get 8k per *unit* of coin. If you tried to sell 10,000 coins, you sure as shit wouldn't get 8k/coin. You'd probably be lucky to get an average of 7.5k/coin.

The point is there's not that much free cash sitting on the exchanges for you to trade the coin for.
so you honestly think BTC and other alts like ETH, OMG and the like will never go higher than they currently are? No offence but start doing a bit more research on the topic before doling out misguided advice

Like I said, there have always been dildos and traders were always getting rekt by them. The only difference is they're more random now, and that's because there's more uncertainty in the market. They were more predictable to you (and us all) because late last year we were in the tail end of a strongly-trending bull market, where the safest bet was up, everyone kept buying in over and over, and so the dildos tended to be green.
See rule 1.

Find a way to communicate with people without demagoguery.
Haha don't want to find out by testing it 
In his example, you would incur fees on the stops. When the price hits 8200, the market is still above your limit (your limit is 8190). Your order will then operate as a taker until the price falls below 8190, at which point any remaining becomes a normal limit sell.

For instance, say you have a stop limit sell with your stop at 8200 and limit at 8190 for 100 BTC. Price falls to 8200. Your stop triggers and your order fills as a taker for 50 BTC (incurring fees) until the market is at 8189. Now you have a normal limit sell remaining at 8190 that won't incur fees but runs the risk of never filling if the price continues dumping fast.

A stop limit basically just lets you say "I want to sell/buy if the price falls/rises to x (stop) value but only fill my sell/buy at y (limit) value or better."
I don't know about the fees as I don't use Gdax, I was only describing how conditional orders work on every exchange. The interface is not the same though, if you compare Bittrex to Binance for example. Some exchanges have a box for buy orders and one for sell orders, others have only one box where you have to modify the options to make it a buy or a sell conditional order. 
Yes, definitely. that's the point of it being hidden, really 
True but considering the artificially low supply of BTC + the fact that most of the supply is in the hands of a few hundred emotionally charged incel bronies (see twitter and look up Samson mow and the monero lead dev) I don't think this market is going to act very rational at all. 

Anyways, I had some short limits set around 8425 to 8.6 and the first executed. I guess I'll see what happens. 
When were there others? Would genuinely like to know and whether they had any effect.
Edit: Woah, did I say weeks? I should've said since the BGD - which has only been three days!? 
Perhaps. I need a good break for a bit, this stuff is too much for me 8)
I didn't, and i don't, i am still waiting for a sharp retrace.

they can do it instantly by having large stack of fiat and btc on standby on each exchange.  buy from one, sell on the other, instant profit.
Imagine you got $15k

You deposit $5k on 3 exchanges. There you go; always ready to arbitrage
True, what I said was a bit simplified, in reality (like /u/Surf_Solar said) you have both currencies on both exchanges and only withdraw/deposit when necessary. It gets even more interesting (also risky) if you can long/short the currencies.
The only difference is most asset classes don't move 25% in 3 days

What happens when you try to sell OTC and the price changes 15% in the hour you're negotiating a deal?

Always wondered about this

Dush actually stopped shorting for a while now. Stop hand waving actual issues by assuming people are short, it's a terrible argument. 
[removed]
What I said is not opinion. People use "bitcoin" among their keyword searches for far more reasons than looking it up initially. People who heard about bitcoin 10 years ago still utilize keywords that use bitcoin in it. Fuck, looking up "bitcoin wallet updates" will be shown in that result.

Keep your head buried, pal.
Financial Sharia law is bullshit. Basically it is the same as traditional finance but with higher fees and a sticker (hallal). I'm not debating that. I'm just saying that it really works (ie: a big number of muslims will pick these instruments despite being the same for a higher price tag because of the sticker).
idk man its all just a bunch of flags.  they don't mean anything.
Yeah I get what you’re saying and honestly I’ve dwelled these parts long enough to either eye roll at your post or just not reply because it’s a wasted exertion. I was just asking a question, not everyone has the capacity to stay tuned in 24/7 on this shit. It’s not healthy and you don’t need to go full roast when someone asks something. You could’ve left it at “no selling as of now, no further moves until sept meeting” and that would’ve been fine. Cool? Alright cool. My post is hardly exposure enough to flop sentiment so you don’t need to be so skittish about it. Jesus. 
Thanks! I don't doubt things were crazier in 2013...and I can only imagine the uncertainty and volatility of 2010 to 2013, when market options were extremely limited, books were even thinner, and people weren't even sure if this funny internet money was even worth a dollar or $100. Back then one whale could literally pump or dump the price 90% with one buy or sell....
Sorry, comment was not meant to be directed at two_bit_misfit, but I see how it  might read that way. I meant it more generally because sloppysynapses had replied to multiple comments expressing that sentiment (I probably should have replied to one of those).

I have also been around since before the late 2013 bubble, and I think I disagree. Back then, the books were thin, there was obvious manipulation, and there were spoof walls, etc., which led to choppy/unpredictable movement. In fact, in 2013, my most effective strategy was writing a crappy market maker bot to exploit the spread on thin books, so I'm definitely familiar with what you're talking about. 

But, I really don't remember seeing 20% movements in 30 minutes after multiple days of chop. I think that is unique to this environment we have now with some very large players and relatively thin books. 
I know, I was just kidding. I admit, your constant bearishness was/is annoying to me but only because you’re usually correct!
Not chewy, but I would think a test of 8000 would be imminent.  No idea after that 
You win some, you lose some. Let the universe have this one; you preserved your capital. :)
Here. I'm probably closing it at a local top so I might re enter on lower leverage but the amount of control these whales had over my net worth wasn't worth it :p 

Hey thanks, that means a lot haha. Why an inspiration?? 
probably. who cares? They can do whatever they want, none of this seems like real price discovery, it's just a few dudes having their way with overleveraged traders. No one is here for the tech or genuine market movement. Need a break
I'll just make money the ol fashioned way 
Yes, I feel the same way. But I’m not short. Is it greed? Are you short?

It’s excellent risk management to short here, bht somehow I can’t bring myself to do it.

Am I being greedy? What are your thoughts?
That is because it is banned or nearly so in several asian markets: China, India, Pakistan, etc.

That is not exactly bullish indicators. The one market that embraced bitcoin from a regulatory standpoint (korea) is trading at a DISCOUNT to the price. Again, not inspiring confidence.

Pump and dumps have a net-zero effect. A pump and dumper needs to sell the coins they buy. So, the reason why the price rallied from $6900 was the result of about 4 20 minutes pumps in the last week. Eventually, the pump group needs to sell back.

So, to have sustained price recovery, you need actual holders / adopters. That is hard to do when every week more and more bannings occur and more friction happens in the buying process.
Yeah, bitcoin years are like dog years.
I am a mod. These posts are fine as long as the focus is Bitcoin. See the sidebar.
Thank you I really appreciate and respect your opinions! Last question if I may while I have your attention lol 

With the other 75% of a hold stack would you wait and accumulate/hold until surpassing or next ATH and then layer sell 25 or closer to 75%??? 
To buy more & cheaper later on of course

Reason for asking my friend made 500% gains and never sold.. He won’t make that mistake again..
Yea horrible move on my part. Good thing about making mistakes like this is they help reinforce your rules and with time you come back stronger than ever. No more FOMOing in with market orders at the peak. Man that was dumb of me
Yeah that's what I mean - everyone relying on bear div the past few days has gotten burned it seems to me. But I want to trust it this time. Feels a bit 'dry' out there right now. 
I just rekt last night on my shorts at 8150 because i wasn’t around to close for drop to 7950. 
Just closed my short from 8350 because this bullflag looks promising. 

What exactly entry you looking at? I’m gonna stagger shorts between 8450-8600 
The bull party is a lot more fun. Shorting will not be a smart thing to do until somewhere north of $20k. You might get lucky here and there, but it will be a losing proposition overall. Supply is tight and demand seems to be perking up. That's just Bitcoin doing Bitcoin.
Ascending triangle target is $8.7k. This shit is ridiculous but it's somehow kinda still following some TA
Ah ok cool, enjoy your posts I can tell you know what you're doing and have some interesting insights. 
there are things as stop limit to the upside
We do not now, that was all
Naaa, you could probably sell 10k coins at 8k.

There’s about 65M worth of buy-side contracts >8k on BitMex swaps as we speak. You could market sell 10k coins and you wouldn’t dip sub 8k if you used two exchanges (or even just two instruments on Mex)
If you're trying to sell 10,000 coins ....~80 million dollars.....

Yeah, you're gunna move the market....This isn't some crazy new insight.
You would sell 10,000 through a block trade off the exchanges books where there is demand.  Only sell that amount on an exchange if you wanted to move the price down.  Exchanges have never had good liquidity, not just for crypto.
Prove it.
Wasn't speaking to you i asked a specific person to validate their specific claim.
Fair enough but the concern Trolling was very strong. I don't need to debate. Im all set. 
If I were a spice girl I would be flour. So no. 
I don't mind volatility. February and January were fucking awesome. This shit is way different. 
> where the safest bet was up,

well, no, not really. January/february were extremely volatile but it was much more enjoyable to trade. The trend since then has definitely been down and I think most traders would say it was a lot different back then
edit: Contribution self-removed due to over-zealous moderation. 31 day ban for single use of a benign word with 10 upvotes of communities agreeance. Unlike the army of trolls who evade these bans I will not be contributing any further. Race to the bottom.
Good to know. Thanks for explaining.
possibly, to me this is just 100% clearly manipulation. once the blatant, overt manipulation stops and we go sideways for a while I'll think the bottom is in. 

Notice how like that guy said above, sentiment is low even though price is rising? That's because no one here is actually buying or they all sold low.

Remember, despair for everyone, not just bears or bulls 
exactly 7 days ago. somebody bought 100 and he pulled out. 

7000 btc wall.
Agreed. Everything about Islam revolves around profit taking. I don't think there is any religion that incorporates this as much as Islam. So you can be sure any ICO that gets "Halal" sticker will moon LOL.
They mean something. But the thing is, there was no v shaped bottom, just deeper, the period of consodilation cant hardly be called a eve bottom, and it didn't met their target. It clearly a wave 3 correction using elliot waves.
Sorry, did not mean to direct that comment at you (see my reply above)
I guess I don't remember if they happened quite as fast, but 20%-50% changes in a day were completely normal. Look [at the historical Gox data](https://bitcoinwisdom.com/markets/mtgox/btcusd). It was pretty nuts back then. I remember people complaining about being bored when we only saw a 10% swing in a day.
Well I was in the process of changing my trading strategy and your example gave me good input about which way to go. Changed from trying to catch rises and falls into full bearmarket form - orders 90% shorting, refining my entries, almost no stop losses, just gradual adding.
I don’t think that’s necessarily the case. I think there’s literally a chance some big buyers are scooping up coins at great prices for the future. If we indeed hit the bottom, this is going to happen a lot more until casual money floods back in and you’ll have your consistent volume back. 

Seems like we are at the “fools rally” stage here.
As a blacksmith or candle maker? 
No its not greedy, it's probably smart. I'm going to take a break though for a bit I think I need to clear my head. Got stopped out on my short finally and am upset w not taking profits earlier on it. Still a huge win but this market is too manipulated for me to enjoy it anymore. Not worth the stress really 
Like insect years
So remove the mentions of altcoins from the summary or what?
hold stack is for holding long term.

meaning you don't touch it until it gets crazy high and you can change your life by getting out. So you don't really try and time the top. 

that said, if you want to play the mid-term moves(i.e. trying to sell when $20,000 got rejected on this last move)...I find its best to just let the price do its thing until the price shows a noticeable retracement(i.e. drops below 25% off ATH). This usually indicates that a reversal is likely.

Then just be patient and wait for an eventual bounce that goes almost as high as ATH without really getting there and sell most or all of your stack when it starts to run out of steam

Layering in the rest from 8.5-8.7. Don't expect to close this for a loss since a retest of log support turned resistance turns support is likely even if we cross it.  

No stops for that reason but inb4 BGD upon immediate breach of the line and I get rekt. 
> demand seems to be perking up

Because some whale market bought 30k coins?
Hmm good limit offers placed then. I went mostly off the log line (around 8.5) and instinct (expecting at least a fakeout). Good to know there's some lines and whatchamacallits backing my potential play. 
well yes that too. I just mean it's mainly stops. I guess you could classify that as fomo buying
[deleted]
Not true. You just wouldn't lose the value. It'd still be in BTC though. You'd then have to further sell what coin you got from the swaps and that would definitely be below 8k. So you'd average out a price lower than 8k.

That also assumes you wouldn't have trouble liquidating that future's position (without losing more value), which I can guarantee you would.
Then why did you say:

> and right now if you sold you could get ~8000 dollars for every bitcoin
Ehh?
But your proof is right there...
Report that as a rule 1 violation. Campaigns of low quality concern trolling qualify, but ad hominem attacks need to be addressed first.
There was a sense of flow to the markets, and even though that flow could be sharply reversed, it wasn't herky jerky "bart" patterns of huge dildo -> flatness, which only got coined recently because they only started en masse happening recently. March 26th was when several happened in a row for the first time
Report and ignore
Interesting. Do you keep notes on these or something? That's a good idea.

7 days is a long time though, when sometimes you might see multiple per day. There has been an eerie lack of sell pressure during this recent run up, but that's probably at least partially attributable to recent oversold conditions and trader's fear of shorting after the squeeze. 
I remember high volatility, for sure, but I've always felt there was some kind of meaningful trend to follow, you could sense when things were going to reverse or bounce, etc., even if it was relatively chaotic.  The squarewave movements we've been seeing recently feel more like landmines that come more or less out of no where and don't necessarily indicate any trend. 

But, sure, more likely than not, there were movements like this in the past when I wasn't paying attention. It doesn't change the fact that the price movements we are seeing are qualitatively different from what we've seen during the 2017 run up and the January-March 2018 period, and the underlying cause is quite bearish.

I think most TA is bullshit and useless especially lately with all the market making goin on but lately I've gotten rekt trying  to trade against it so I'm saying fuck it. 
or just breakout trades
The liquidity is there ONLY because it's seen as not volatile right now. The second the market starts moving, that liquidity would vanish you'd be stuck in your short with nobody to buy it back from and close.

More likely is Bitmex would ADL your position in the middle of the movement and you'd be borked.
63million contract between us and 8k on swaps alone
the 10% jump was a massive short squeeze (and stop loss hunt).

from the troll box chat during that time, someone mentioned that they just did a 100mil market sell on bmex to make the initial spike to 7k happen. Afaik The vast bulk of the rise after 7.2k was the short squeeze
Just saying: I had Mex open and checked the order book.

It would be really easy to sell 10k coins above 8k roght now. Kraken, GDAX and Stamp would be enough to get it done
because i figured i wasn't talking to an audience of people with 10,000 bitcoins to sell?

you know like if you're talking about the price of beef at the supermarket it's implicit not talking about the price of a whole cow?
Ehhh? 
Doesn't say anything about Globie2017 getting banned which is his claim.

You can still spot the macro trends. Right now we're bouncing inside a big bull pennant that started at the top of the bubble in Dec. This last big move was a bounce off the bottom of that, and we're in the process of either bouncing down off the top or breaking through.

2016-17 were pretty low key for bitcoin. This is feeling more like the bubble zone that the entirety of 2013 was, and most of bitcoin's charts prior to that as well.

You also have to take into account that [bitcoin has more attention now than it ever did back then](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2012-03-15%202018-04-15&q=bitcoin). Even the 2013 bubble looks like a blip in the Google trends, and back then it was at the 100 mark. There are so many more people on these exchanges now, most of them completely untrained.
Yes I wish I learned how to trade when the market was more raw and full of people. the bull markets and month or two after crashes seem relatively genuine. Lately it's just gotten worse and worse. I don't mind getting "shaken out", I just want to preserve my capital and sanity 
Lol nice, man. I'm glad you didn't. Still think here to $9k is a good risk/reward for a short. Obviously $8.7k+ is much higher reward with less risk. There will be an inevitable pullback at some point

regardless of how good you think you are, you still need to separate your stacks

if you are as smart as you think you are, you'll still be plenty profitable using 50% of the stack 
yeah I guess. Shit's just looking less like a market and more like a casino 
What's your problem?

I think this more or less my point, actually. These dynamics are unique because this particular market situation is basically unprecedented. It's not hard to see how exactly what you describe is a primary contributor to price dynamics I'm talking about.

I agree, though, that the macro trends are still readable.
The community your post is written for is probably /r/CryptoCurrency 

Mods are currently talking about creating an altcoin daily thread. This post will be ideal for that.

Until that's implemented this content belongs in another sub, like /r/CryptoCurrency .

Rule 2 applies to everyone.
