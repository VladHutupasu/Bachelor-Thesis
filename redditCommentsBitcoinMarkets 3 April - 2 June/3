If I miss a trade, I missed an opportunity and I feel miserable. 

If I made the wrong trade and lost money, I feel miserable.

If I make the right trade, I wish I'd put more in and still feel miserable.

Sometimes I feel like the only thing you're guaranteed from trading is misery.

EDIT: More succinct. 
Sorry in advance for the not so trading related post. 

Just wanted to say thank you to all the members of this sub who post helpful content. You might have seen my post some months ago explaining I'm going to prison for a few years asking for advise. Between the content of this sub and learning some basic TA I've grown my stack considerably and feel good about my investment for the next few years. 

While inside I plan to read as much as possible about TA as well as trading psychology so when I get out I can begin day trading on a more professional level. 

The amount I've made is probably quite small compared to others in this sub but it's enough to possibly be life changing when I get out.. and if this whole thing goes to shit I'm glad I at least participated in a possibly world changing technology. Worst case there's always bartending. I leave for prison in a week. Catch y'all in 2021. 

Cheers 
Lol @ the $7700 wick on binance. 
Is this mainly a "short" subreddit?
Bittrex seems to have just added USD markets: https://bittrex.com/home/markets ([archived in case it gets taken away](https://web.archive.org/web/20180531135003/https://bittrex.com/home/markets))

This is unusual for 15m bb to be so tight for so long.
Got stopped out of my [3x short from 7525](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8n5lmx/daily_discussion_wednesday_may_30_2018/dztm25j/) at 7450 for a small gain. Back in a 2x short from 7578. My stops are extremely tight at 7625-7650. MACD and Stoch RSI giving different messages on 1h-6h, so no guidance there. My thinking is basically if we continue to go upwards here, even a fakeout, it would be bullish and there is nothing stopping us from going to 7800-7850 for a true test of a higher high and breakout of upper resistance of downtrend. On the other hand, we are still fairly decisively in the downtrend until we aren't so I have no problem opening a moderate short here.
Don't know why people are surprised, it's just a tightening range/equilibrium pattern. It's not breaking down hard, it's probably going to stay above 7350 or 7400. 
My guess is we will get more or less boring 24 hours and wait for the 12h Bbands to close, if we do not move above 7.6k we get very tight 12h Bbands in about 26 hours which will then break in the one or the other direction. Happy trading, dont waste another sunny day with charting where no real move is happening. 
First bottom (6k) we've seen capitulation and true recovery, second bottom (6.5) we've seen over leveraged shorts getting rekt and pushing the price 1k in 30 mins. Today we have 11k more longs than shorts and it surely does not feel like capitulation. 


Just did my speech on Bitcoin to 100 college kids. I now have people coming up to me asking how to margin trade on Kraken. 

Otherwise it went well, people were extremely interested and it caught everyone’s intentions.

Out of the 100 people, only 2 we’re invested in Crypto and barely any people knew about it. It’s really crazy how many people don’t know much about BTC. Just shows how much more room it has to grow
Nobody talking about the rising wedge? On mobile so can't chart
My brain talking to my brain - Bull trap, oh wait, no bear trap, oh wait, no bull trap.. 
Whether you are long or short, you won’t be getting a good nights sleep tonight 

BRD or BGD can happen overnight 

You can wake up to 6,000 BTC or 8,500 BTC
Trading range for now. Would not make decision to enter the market until it has made up its mind.
Not in a position ATM, considering shorting at 7700 to at least 7350.

Theres a massive gap in the chart from 8560 to 7900 where we just went into freefall. Question to those with more experience: do massive gaps like that require more "fuel" to get through or is it a bit like an empty canvas situation? Or is it great cos theres no real resistances?

I noticed that the hourly bands seems to be shaped like a [heart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/oylM7ote) which is mildyinteresting
I am literally down $1.5M since December b/c most of my wealth is tied to BTC... and I STILL sleep like a baby. Why are you pussies so bipolar and emotional?



As long as we’re not out of the bear market (and we’re not until we’re at 12K) the trend is the only thing you can rely on. A reversal so quickly does not feel right, needs more pain, needs more time for people to forget, and more parasites/shitcoiners need to leave this space. Only the ones who truly deserve it will reap the rewards. I’m ready for the price to drop more because I don’t give a shit. Long-term Bitcoin is the most bullish its ever been and the network effect is unstoppable. The noobs and shitcoiners who think anything with a “blockchain” is the same as Bitcoin just don’t get it.... they will learn their lesson in time... and maybe one day they can tell their tinder dates they lost seven figures in 3 months like me
I sold 95% of my crypto last week. The peaceful sleeping that occurs while not thinking about next trade should not be underestimated :D
closing my long from $7080 here at $7505, not liking how long its taking to take down $7600. 

lots of sellers at this price range and the concentration of buyers hasn't moved up so they are still waiting for $7,000
!short XBTUSD 7545 1X 29%

there is no steam to break 7.6 short term imho
and there is still some room to go down.

I may regret this one later, but I will closely monitor my position

Once we get above 10k all hell will break lose, as the delusional bears get stopped out and margin called en masse fueling the rocketship enough to bust through the Titanium Resistance at 12k. Beautiful times ahead.
Looks like an ascending triangle ~~wedge~~ on the BFX 15m. Standout volume observable as well.  
I'm expecting an upward breakout soon.  
Feel like the 4h 100u EMA will be tested here at some point.  
With a move back down after failling to climb above it.  
Okex futures that expire tomorrow spiked down $50 for no dam reason. Then spiked up. My 'market' stop loss at 7495 got hit and it covered it at 7518. Something is odd. It's also been about $20 lower than the index for today. Some shit is gonna happen I can feel it lol. Seat belts gentleman!

What is this indicator on the right called? How do I access it in tradingview?

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8nc8rd/bitcoin_going_down_to_5k_range/dzunxco/

credit to /u/ThudnerChunky for a great analysis of why this range seems more likely to be distribution than accumulation

> the price is spending more time at the bottom of the range than the top but the volume is happening towards the top of the range (indicating distribution rather than accumulation).
Moved the stop loss on my underwater short around 7500. 
I'm taking a hit but i have zero confidence on this move down further.

Low volume dump and a lot of buying quickly stopped it. Now it's the usual slow rise until the next green dildo up and this time should go through 7600 since it will start around 7500. 
Unfortunately, this repeating pattern of slowly creeping up and then dumping seems likely to continue. We might get a few pumps in there to mix it up, but I'm not optimistic about an overall trend change.
Closed my $2mm long from $7511 posted [here,](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8lywrt/z/dzjygue) at $7622 for a total profit of 1.7%, or $34k. Also received approx 0.5xbt from fundings.

Not quite what I was expecting, but happy nonetheless. Will await a better entry. 
If this stays above $7290 it will paint a higher low on the 4hr Bart-chart. Zooming out, that would look pretty bullish  
Hi guys and gals, 
Anyone fancy giving a bit of advice on TA to a noob? Looking for some good books/resources to get my head around it.

Cheers
Is it a bad idea to hedge a successful trade by taking the opposite position at the corresponding support/resistance? I did this last night because i was too annoyed with winning trades dissapearing while I was sleeping. Given how violently this market has tended to move, I'm thinking it isnt a horrible decision, but then again, I am pretty new to trading.
Stopped out on my short from $7371 for a small loss. 

First bad trade in 29 trades :( Oh well. Before going to bed I was extremely uncertain of this trade and had a feeling it was going to break up, and it did. 

If you’re not comfortable with a trade, close it! 

Not opening a short here. I have sell orders stacked from $7648-$7770 and hoping they will execute 

**Edit** 

I’m definitely not bullish yet, but if this is a reversal and we slowly creep back out of the 8k range it could very similar play our like our BGD for traders. Shorters in denial  and shorting against the trend and saying “ This cant go higher” and getting rekt every single time. That was me, and if the trend shifts I’ll be going long more often 
Looks like a bull pennant on smaller timeframes, but I'm expecting it to break down because...why wouldn't it?  

Seriously though, I'm watching the resistance line of that pennant since it's forming a larger resistance line tracing back to the local high at 8644.  If that holds, and we break down from this ascending wedge, I'm expecting we head back down to retest the rising log support at around $6950.  

2nd image shows a zoomed out view where this action could be in the context of a falling wedge, and I'd expect a breakout after bouncing on the rising log TL.  

https://imgur.com/a/QtxAfqy 

Just some thoughts...will re-adjust plans as soon as they're invalidated.

Edit: I realize most of this is premature speculation, I'm just trying to come up with a narrative that I think is plausible and see if it plays out. 
For me BTC looking quite bullish on the 15 min chart. MACD about to cross over. RSI and price both making higher highs\(past hour\) BB squeezed primed for a breakout, i'm expecting upwards, only thing to keep in mind is this really big resistance at $7600/7650. [https://www.tradingview.com/x/8C2jn8Xh/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/8C2jn8Xh/) 
I'm already preparing myself for the worse if we break down from here and plunge into the abyss but I'd be very surprised if this doesn't play out just as it did at the top
http://d.stockcharts.com/school/data/media/chart_school/market_analysis/wyckoff3/wyckoffaccumulation.png

Right now it looks like we are in phase D: testing the resistance.
[removed]
We've formed a higher low of 7270 followed by a higher high of 7600 on the 4hr timeframe.  Expecting the bullish pattern to continue with a new higher low to form around 7400 and then burst through the 7600 resistance for another higher high.  
4hr RSI is not overbought yet so plenty of room to go up.
Added to my short just now at $7,500. 

Edit: I'm absolutely blown away that I even had the opportunity to add to my position so high after such a clear breakdown from a bull flag. 

It just seemed like a no brainer. 
Is there a possibility the reason why volume is so low and diminishing is because most large transactions are being conducted OTC and off exchanges? I'm seeing a lot of (unverified) reports that OTC volume is through the roof. I mean anybody can say that but...
After much internal deliberation, last night i finally set up weekly dca buys for the first time since December, starting from zero holdings. I portioend out how much fiat i am willing to invest, all profit from 2017-Jan, set 25% aside for super dips and the other 75% will get evenly purchased weekly through 2018, absent a black swan event.

Today was really nice, price goes down, cool, more btc. Price goes up, cool, blockfolio in green. I realize that I am likely not buying the bottom now, but was stressing too much on how/when to deploy capital. This stresses me out way less. And I have 25% set aside for a capitulation dump, if it happens. 

Best part, check my email for my auto purchase today, price of $7601. Even my dca has fomo.... Maybe i should move buys to Sunday nights? 
Whale 1 to Whale 2 - Dump ETH

Whale 2 to Whale 3-10 - Make BTC hang out here

Whale 10-100 - Pump EOS

Edit: Whales 10-100 dump it and blame it on bad connection. Did you say "pump", oops, we're sorry, we heard "dump"
Any thoughts on how the current global trade situation will affect crypto prices?  

Stocks are down (-300 DJIA now), but not cratering like I was expecting on reading all of this today.

100 USD move up to 7650 you need to buy 1600 coins

350 USD move to 7200 you need to sell 1600 coins
Even with this pump up right now shorts continue to increase while longs continue to decrease. That's quite bullish imo. Funding for both sides is either stable or decreasing as well so you can expect the willingness of both sides to hold their positions for a long time to go up, aka more chop for the foreseeable future.
Looks like ETH is leading this small pump
[https://www.tradingview.com/x/HUDlnPkn/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/HUDlnPkn/)  Here the 1h. Strong bearish divergences too and currently reversing on the indicators. Can also be seen on the 3H.   I feel a drop to 7,000 area is coming.   


We've reached the $7.600 barrier and could go a little more up, but I'm not playing that.  Strong bearish divergences on the 2h on multiple indicators. Also a rising wedge with decreasing volume.  
If you sold at 17-20k, how's your life now? 
Bear div on the 1h and almost on the 2h. 
Still holding my short from CA 7420. I saw the spike to 7600 and the immediate retreat so I didn't take the loss yet. I'm still not buying the narrative that we are reversing from the 9K down trend and 7040 was the bottom. 

We keep getting this low volume pumps that have no follow through from buyers. Yet again, volume is declining and we are meeting heavy resistance that has been tough to break since last week. See the arrows pointing to the lagging span, how many times we've bounce off this price area. But maybe I'm wrong and we do break through this time.
https://www.tradingview.com/x/nY8hn8e2/


The scenarios I can see play out: 

A) Bulls show up with volume that pushes the price above the rising wedge and stays above 7660s or higher. On which I'll take the loss.

B) Sideways action with volume decreasing, reaching the bottom of the kumo at 7600. In this case I'll wait and see if and how we break through the cloud.

C) We mini dump to the bottom of the wedge but don't break down. Where I could close out almost at breakeven or for a small loss, which is more likely.

D) We fall hard through the wedge. Set stops at break even and let it ride once more.

Good luck all. 

4hr just closed in the [cloud](https://snag.gy/UkATqt.jpg) so that's pretty bullish. If we do get a retrace like the last green dildo that would put us around the 7.4 which is Tekan-San (green line) support, so we have some good looking support down there. 

Edit: Also watching [this](https://snag.gy/sGhn2v.jpg), this (50 & 100MA) hasn't crossed up since late Oct 2016. 
!short XBTUSD add 7560 1x

I don't believe in this rise, a lot of resistance overhead, volume was way lower than on the drop, small rising wedge... It's another run where bulls pushed this up just to stop right before resistance.

Still probably gonna bail somewhere above 7.6.
Stopped out of my short at breakeven overnight. Slight loss due to $28 of slippage.

!short xbtm18 close 7465

We still didn't break/hold 7600, but we had a higher low and a higher high, so I'm staying out of this for now. I'll probably re-short the top of our channel at 77xx, but content to be unleveraged while I see where the market goes. 
!short XBTUSD 7528 5x 30%

Not overly impressed by this pump attempt, will look at bailing if we break 8k.
I havent really been trading this range at all. Its a little too “no-trade zone”y for me.

But a friend of mine has been scalping like crazy every time after a bart and has almost 40% returns in 48 hours without trading any barts at all... All just limit orders with 30$ ranges

Thats fucking impressive
[https://prnt.sc/jp7af4](https://prnt.sc/jp7af4) BTC on Binance spiked to 7699!?!? I didnt even notice as i was looking on Bitfinex. You guys think this was somebody tring to trigger stops and now we go down, or what may have been the idea? Unsure what to think as only happened on Binance.

If Bitcoin has indeed triple bottomed - this will be one of the most if not the most significant events in its history considering its ATH was (IMO) the breakthrough into the mainstream and in hindsight will be the last best chance to accumulate. 
cryptowat.ch
Down?
Typically don't believe this stuff, but btc has now gone up after Italy news and now the tariff news.  IMO I think these are just short term pumps(for now), but it definitely adds to the narrative that BTC is a hedge against global chaos.
!long XBTUSD 7450 10X 100%

I’m feeling quite delusional today. I Hope we break 7800
Got a feeling this rising wedge won't play out like a rising wedge should, not confident enough to open a position on it yet though.
To more experienced traders on here. Isn't there a cup and handle forming on pretty much all time frames? 5 min to 1 hour chart?
Sorry for spam guys, will chill out on top comments after this.

I hope this isn't getting annoying but I am very curious what this sub is feeling in comparison to the beginning of April. 

---

Are you more bullish now than you were at $6.4-$7k at the beginning of April?

https://www.strawpoll.me/15806957


Damn.  Bulls taking care of business. Definitely not expected. 

Good job bulls. Shoulda opened a long 
The only time I can find insightful company, advice and commentary, is when the market is boring. During the recent crash I was being downvoted for building a long order sub 7.2k, and at 9.5k I was being downvoted for talking about shorting lol. 

Good luck to all.
Upping my [2x short from 7578](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8nf6at/daily_discussion_thursday_may_31_2018/dzvbrpd/) to 3x at 7572 avg. MACD and Stoch RSI 1h, 2h, 3h, 4h, 6h are now on the verge of turning bearish or already there. Stops still at 7625-7650.
I think it’s time we embraced the fact that it is possible we’ve been in this huge pennant for a reason: Price discovery

Maybe Bitcoin never goes back to ATH, maybe it never goes below 6k. But maybe we just needed the entire world to FOMO in so we could find out just how much one Corn is worth.

And it looks like that number is 7500 for now.

Just wish someone had called it :/
Just woke up and saw that I got stopped out of my short from 7540 @7415. Really thought that we were setting up for a drop to the upper 6ks. Pump is pretty weak volume wise though. Am waiting to see if we confirm the same area as resistance again (~7560-7600) or if we bust through this time. 
I cropped the dates out by mistake but here is the fractal I spotted. [https://imgur.com/a/efXUqYH](https://imgur.com/a/efXUqYH)

Loving all the downvotes on bullish comments hahaha 
I'm messing around with adding longs/shorts to the same chart as the price.  (ie. I'm a complete amateur with reading charts)

[Would comparing the three of them with % change be useful?](https://i.imgur.com/qTDZpsv.png), or is this information too obfuscated to be useful?  The log scale's are too different to have any sort of decent resolution

be gentle pls
Mid time frame MACD's are working their way closer to the positive. 4 Hour just dipped it's toe in. Looking for some crosses in the next couple of days!

But conversely that could just mean we've got room to fall. Without exiting the coil we are in.

for some reason bfxdata.com long/short chart isn't working for me.

Does anyone have a snapshot of recent longs vs shorts? or could you share a link or instructions for how I can pull the comparison chart up on TradingView?
Well that was less consolidation than I was expecting but it looks like we're probably heading up now. First target at 7850. Second at around 8300.
that's it boys.  can't get through 7.6.   prepare for the BRD.
This looks like it's going to dump. Funny thing is people looking to long at $6800 only got $7000, on the flip side a lot of people waiting to short at $7800 and only got $7600. Volume is sad. I don't know how you guys trade this craziness.
As someone who was waiting for late 7200's, this green candle is as painful to me as a dildo shoved up my ass.

Right now, Bitcoin looks like a series of steps where you bet UP or DOWN

I ended up accidentally closing my position after the last green candle at $7,580, was trying to cancel the break even limit sell order instead..

This turned out to be the most challenging trade of my life. I managed and turned a big loss into a smaller one, though my plan was to turn it into profit even if I had to wait longer but instead got a little excited and ended up pressing the wrong buttons..

!long BTCUSD close 7580

I am long again with 20% stack from $7,499, caught the wick. I might add more to it upon good indication, or I might close it, I might also short around $7,600 depending on the circumstances. 

I have pretty much quite a lot of options now. I do not feel isolated in a trade, rather I feel glad and happy. :)

Ascending triangle they said...
Mods - calendar is out of date.  MtGox stuff in September.  Were there dates for Coinbase's new product releases...didn't pay too much attention to that.  Anything else noteworthy?
something noteworthy is the stalemate that margin longs and shorts are in. I think short positions are more likely to be squeezed in the short term, but I think eventually we will go down and some longs will need to capitulate. But right now neither is willing to close at a loss. 
BIG GREEN DILDOS! Folks, that's what you paid for and came to see! Enjoy!

With massive volume, to boot! Giddyup!!!!

Looks like 7530 is solid support to start a long if not already in one.
Ethtrader starting to talk about moon, delusional atmosphere. Looks like it has double top'd around 580 and it might pull down BTC with it. 
I have us breaking down through the wedge and closing under in on lower timeframes.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/0lwME4Qq/

Opened a short from $7560 but never posted it.

People who are short from there are you guys holding? Or closing? 
So in general, people who say "bitcoin is not like other bubbles", "muh fundamentals","ta don't work here" and so on

Why would this be, since bubbles  has been recorded in 500 years of human history in all kinds of asset classes, on all kinds of time frames.

My point is, this is separate from fundamentals or not, since markets are humans 
I think it is a good bargain to buy the coin at current prices as the rewards seems to outweigh the risk. 

I am going to add another 20% to *the long from $7,499* at $7,580. 
ETH seems to be breaking through resistance right now after it started pumping about 15 minutes ago. It will be interesting to see if BTC follows suit soon.
Breaking down hard
The RSI is oversold, if not, then just about, on almost all time frames. Given the very pathetic drop just now, along with the even more underwhelming volume, I'm sorry to break it to the goblins here, this will quickly reverse to a stairway to heaven!
Currently in a short from 7536. Anybody have a support line that I should keep in mind? 
Managed to short @7590 (6496€). 15 min RSI is 87 and we're hitting important horizontal resistance. Stops above 7800.
Has any one noticed how nice this run up looks on the ETH 30min, compared to the BGDs on BTC? It looks very healthy.
How do you deal with losses? I just closed an underwater long and ended up with -1.3% loss. Could kick my ass but it was my fist trade
What's going on ETH is dumping..btc is going up
Long from 7240 is looking good. No stops and no thoughts of closing. This could run up hard.
Oepsie...... As mentioned last 48 hours... Me, Buying ( add to my long term porto - Ledger ) when we are at 7600. We are getting close. 
When there, I will add 3 Juicy BTC's. 

Although... we are not there yet.... Patience.
Posted this last night, not the prettiest, but it's looking a little better now. Inverse H&S: https://imgur.com/a/BG2ax8F

A breakout should take us out of the bear channel, and an eventual target of 8150 or so. Personally, I wont be fomoing this one, but a retest of the neckline after a good break (to like 7800 or so) might make a nice entry.
Jazzed about my long from yesterday. Looking like it could turn out to be one of my better trades.  Kind of wish this would come down a bit because I'd like to add. 
About one year ago Bitstamp made the following announcement

> Margin Trading
> We are also happy to announce that we are now testing our margin trading service, which is in its closed BETA phase. Currently open to a handful of our customers, we will be gradually opening up access to everyone in the months ahead. Watch this space for updates!

> Bitstamp Ltd CEO, Nejc Kodrič, had the following to say about the announcement: “Things are changing rapidly and we now have the fundamentals in place to give our traders all the services they’re used to, but in a safe and secure environment. Now is the right time to expand and continue giving our customers what they want.”

https://www.bitstamp.net/article/bitstamp-announces-phase-ii-its-development/

Not sure they stopped these plans (for financial, technical or legal reasons)?  Somebody has some update about it (or did somebody take some time to contact them about the topic)?

/u/bitstamp-lucas  
This simple support turned resistance game agaiin.
Bitmex down. Could see some interesting movement if the manipulators are paying attention.

"We are currently experiencing a server error. We have been notified. BitMEX will be back up very shortly. Please try again soon." 

Edit : Back up for me now. 
Despite the wedge I'm still bullish short term, gone long with a tight stop
[removed]
This looks like a great spot to take some profits, closing half of my long here. (7,550).

I'm staying in a long position overall unless I see clear signs of goblin town. I'll start adding more from 7.1k down to the low 6s. 
The weekly cloud (double settings) is going to flip bearish at the end of the week if the week closes below the $7200 range. That, coupled with TK cross at the end of last week and the fact that the cloud is very thin points to trouble. 
Putting a small sell at 7.9; my greedy limit strategy has been working well for me, and when I asked people opinions on market orders and balancing in a more traditional market maker way everyone assumed I was joking, so its a little unclear if maybe I'm missing something important about that or if all you lot are only concerned with margin trading and have nothing substantial to say. But I think the later.

I believe that 7k will be the real bottom and the readjustment period is coming to an end. Random pushes to 8k may be a thing, but 3rd times the charm or some shit, and this time is different\^tm.

My optimism for last years growth rate of 3 months to double price is gone, but I don't believe the 200\-600 era rate of \~1 year to double is realistic, but we may spend a few months to a year doing so before a new rate of growth is decided on.
Had the plan that I would use tradingview from my tablet during the summer...wow, ruined my drawings in no time on Android!

While I was trying to zoom and right click, I managed to move my trendlines, delete a fib and collapse RSI and volume indicator into one - although I think that is a great feature, I would like to know how I do/undo that?

Is anyone here using tradingview on an Android tablet?
I would be most grateful for a tutorial on how to control it...
What can we expect/look forward to when it comes to news? Nothing exciting seems to be coming any time soon, and market doesn't seem to care about anything these days. Will anything short of china adopting bitcoin as legal tender turn us around?

Since consensus, we (I?) have yet to see anything that justifies movements up OR down for a while now.

So close yet so far.
Dumpy put up a good fight and even won a couple rounds, but he's looking tired -- like TKO-level tired -- after today's feeble little dump.  Now he looks like he's just bleeding out but somehow staying on his feet.

Don't be surprised if Pumpy delivers the knockout punch in the next couple days.  Either way, Dumpy already lost on points.  Bitcoin still worth more than most of us thought it would be even a year ago.

Ez crash back to 7200 ish, as usual no follow up after the initial BGD, sideways for a while and crash back down.

Ascending triangle on several timeframes, could well go more or less side ways for the next 12 hours tbh, before breakout either way. If upwards I would expect it to reach 7800, and if down 7300. Will see how the divergences look closer to the time to try and decide. Currently not in a trade as not enough support either way atm for me. [https://www.tradingview.com/x/agUOPplg/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/agUOPplg/)
When I zoom out six months (actually, a little more -- to Nov 20) on the one-day candles, it looks pretty bullish, like we're bottoming and starting to head back up.  It wouldn't surprise me one bit to see a new ATH by the end of summer.

Zooming out a year makes the ATH look very achievable.  
The way I see it is that we need to break 7800 soon. There is a lot of resistance there and taking it would be incredibly bullish. We have gone above the 50 and 100 MA's on most lower timeframes but the bearish divergencies and relatively high RSI levels could easily make up for another leg down, so taking 7600 and 7800 is a must for the bulls. 
Ascending triangle tightening. Looks like its going to slingshot upwards any moment. We are experiencing a bullish paradigm shift of epic proportions. Hold on to your hats girls and avoid running into the carcasses of all the slaughtered bears that litter the path towards 12k and beyond!

Edit: lol this weak drop brought all the desperate bears out of their hiding places. Sorry guys but this is bullish as hell

Really weak effort from desperate bears to drop the price. The strong resistance by bulls plus slow push upwards shows this bullish fevour is only increasing. Onwards and upwards!
Agriotherium is an extinct genus of bears whose fossils are found Miocene through Pleistocene-aged strata of North America, Europe, Africa, and Asia, living from ~13.6–2.5 Ma, existing for approximately 11.1 million years. Materials of the late surviving A. africanum from Africa has suggested that A. africanum died out soon during the early Gelasian.

Agriotherium was about 2.7 metres (9 ft) in body length and weighed around 900 kg (1,980 lb), making it larger than most living bears. Except for the extinct subspecies of the modern polar bear Ursus maritimus tyrannus and Arctotherium, Agriotherium was, along with the short-faced bear, Arctodus simus, the largest member of terrestrial Carnivora. It had dog-like crushing teeth. Its primary diet was carnivorous and secondary was omnivorous possibly classifying this animal as mesocarnivore. With a body mass close to those of most large ungulates (bovines, cervids, camelids, and others), it is probable that Agrotherium could have preyed on these. Agriotherium also likely scavenged, and would not have been hesitant about stealing kills from such animals as the sabertooth cat Amphimachairodus, with whom it shared territory in both China and North America, and the feliform Barbourofelis, which it lived alongside in Texas, as evidenced by fossil deposits at Coffee Ranch.[3][
My god I spotted a difference of 1 cent between buys and sells. Clear evidence that bears are trying desperately to manipulate the market and drag us back down into their holes. Bulls rightously gobbling up all weak bear sales and storming the front to 8k. I've never seen bears so utterly decimated before! Keep going bulls!

Hurry up and burn through your stack so you can move on to a happier life 
The market has endless opportunities. Missing them sucks, but know there’s another one right around the corner. Losing trades is part of trading. You can’t get to your next wins without losing some trades in between. Change your mindset and you can find positivity anywhere.
Read trading in the zone by Mark Douglas and learn how to enjoy fear and lose money, never think of trading as money just numbers 
Signs of an emotional trader\^.  Highly recommend you either stop trading for a while or lower your positions.  You should be confident in your trades but also recognize you're going to be wrong 45% of the time. If you set your stop losses and profit targets right there isn't much to worry about. 
Interestingly im more miserable doing successful trades than unsuccessful ones
Change your ways soon. Don't be so on edge and greedy. Otherwise you'll soon be overtrading and rekt. I'm speaking from experience. Learn at every mistake and take time to reflect on what's going on
Don't forget making the right trade, taking profit, but exiting way too early. Max pain somehow. 
If you trade 100% stack, the wins are good, unless you stress out for taking profits too soon or wait too much and not win as much.

Of course that means losses will be also greater

You learn the truth of the Buddha's teaching through trading. Life is suffering. Suffering is caused by attachment. Attachment can be broken.

Concentrate on doing the right thing rather than being attached to the outcome.
I’ve been arrested. 25 years+ in jail / 400k+ in Fines. Got out of all of it. Hope it’s the same case for you. 

Getting arrested was probably best life lesson for me. Turned me around and put me on the correct path and I’ve forever bettered my life since then. 

Hopefully it does the same for you. 

Good luck in life man. 
Hey buddy, you stay strong and focused. God bless and see you on the flip side, your are by default a true hodler (for a few years)

Fuck man. Hopefully your prison gets overcrowded and you get released early?  Are you hodling anything going in?
>leave for prison

Uhh what did you do?
You should learn to meditate in prison as well. People voluntarily spend years on silent retreats learning to meditate. There's no reason why you can't do the same with your time away, regardless of the fact that it's involutary. Mindfulness meditation is the most important thing I've ever been taught. It's the method for developing an equinamous mind. It's always best to be under the guidance of a good teacher but that's not exactly possible in prison. I can recommend some good books if you'd like. You can accomplish a lot in prison if you use your time effectively.

OR:

6k, all time high volume after a crash of 70% or whatever always loads up a bounce of at least 100%.  > Then it loses it all back

6.4k, repeat, bounce is down to 50% this time.  > Lose it all back

?.?k, bounce again > Lose it all back


This huge triangle people are drawing is grabbing one pattern in their mind and ignoring the entire underlying mechanism at play. Can 11k more longs than shorts change the entire structure of human emotion that creates the bubble action?
Soooo....Bullish then?
Isn't margin trading one of the most dangerous ways to live a life?

Zoom out a little. It's a small rising wedge inside a bigger falling wedge inside a bigger bear channel that's running into long-term resistance soon.

also this is a great example of why buying the 4h rsi at oversold is nowhere near a 100% win.

Look at the price when RSI was 17: $7520.

We have effectively reset the RSI and even gone above neutral (~60) and we are $50 above there with most of our movement *below* that price point.

I call this the [WIFOM](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=WIFOM) effect.
Wait why would I not sleep well if I woke up to 6k btc, I'd retire
With the gigantic previously established support in the mid 6000's I'd be more than a little shocked if we wound up at 6k without alot of sideways and retesting.
THis 7-11k range can lick an asshole.

Get us the fuck out of it 
While we crashed down through it this time, historically (read: historically within the correction from ATH) we've hung around that range quite a bit, there's plenty of volume nodes particularly at 7.8k-8.2k; I wouldn't read *too* much into it as an "empty canvas".

Even if you pretend it is an empty canvas, the 7ks were ACTUALLY an empty canvas due to the BGD and not having had much volume in the 7.2k-7.8k range previously and we've certainly spent plenty of time there recently.
Empty canvas situation imo.
Sorry but thats a terrible decision. Market is overwhelmingly bullish and shorting it would just be not a very wise

Patience can really pay big whether you're long or short.  I hope you at least took your gain in BTC or you might soon be in a "sitting at the bottom waiting for it to drop but watching it explode upward thinking 'damn, why the eff did I sell there!?'" situation, which is a crap situation.

Volume Profile or VPVR
Here’s a great overview of the basics 

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/ETHUSD/ztOxu8Hm-Volume-Profile-Fixed-Range-Session-Volume-Visible-Range/
Volume Profile, likely Volume Profile Visible Range \(VPVR\). Only available in pro, go to indicators and it has its own section.

One of my favorites, especially used as confluence for horizontalish supports/resistances.
Indicators, Volume Profile, Visible Range.  Then have the "Number of Rows" setting quite high!
I mean, most people don't use it that far back, if you're trying to show a bearish bias that works I guess.  But you're supposed to go right to left, which would put us around 8.2 as the most volume and changes your nodes up to date. 

I could zoom out to 2013 and really scare people lol but it doesn't work like that. 
I'll be surprised if we don't see a $300 1hr green candle sometime in the next 24 hours.  Seems like all the ingredients are there.
On 4hr chart we have a higher high and now a higher low with an inverted H&S+C&H: textbook reversal pattern. I want to add that the chart is not in sync with my gut feeling (since April BGD).
Congrats mike. Your trading patience is amazing. Works well in this choppy market. I am trying to adopt some of that in my trading style :) 
I think that the fact we STILL can’t get above 7600 is very bearish after all.

I want the corn to go up, but it seems like the corn doesnt want to go up.
What do you consider a better entry? ..realistically speaking .. asking for a friend

No, that is not a bad idea
Why don't you just exit the trade and save on fees?
All good runs come to an end! Well done.  
Take my advice and don’t get back in for at least 24 hours

In your position people tend to over trade to get back into a groove and start making more and more bad trades. 

Give it 24 hours to let your head cool 
[removed]
Agreed. The RSI should also cool significantly when the higher low is set which could facilitate an even greater bounce should it occur. 
So you’re 20X? I hesitated to add earlier. 

Edit: a word
Yes, the bull flag broke down but it was bought up so fast that isn't it possible that it was a bear trap? I've been calling on us to range in the 7k's for awhile so I think you'll be able to get out in profit on this but aren't you at least a little surprised given the bearish sentiment recently? I feel like how fast this recovered would lean bullish.
May I ask if you're moving your stops up with this add in case of a sudden move, or you still plan to cut it over 7600?
Interesting. Do we have more infos about this ?
Is that a knowable answer, is the question.
This should work out well for you I think .  I wouldn’t worry about day f the week.  All that stuff will be a wash avaleraged out over a few months.  

But weekly buys between now and December should be a pretty safe bet to catch the bottom at some point in that range with your average cost of purchase about between the current price and the bottom most likely.  

I would be pretty surprised if we haven’t reached the bottom by December.  
Bro. This is not the time to be DCAing. Wait for the price to stay within a $2000 band for a month before you do. DCA is responsible but at these prices quite irresponsible and yes, stupid
The market isn't certain that these tariffs will stick yet. That's why the response has been muted. The ones against china have been announced, pulled back, and then re-announced. No one knows WTF is going on. But if the newest tariffs against all European cars go through, that would be disastrous to the US economy. 

Most of those cars are made in the USA for the US market.

I'm also hearing in /r/economics that prices on steel and aluminium have gone up drastically in the last couple months. Trump is throwing a wrench into the US economy and into the very idea of free trade in order to score political points. We'll see how long this lasts before voters in impacted districts wise up. Protectionism is a two-edged sword -- for every worker than benefits, there are others that get punched in the gut.

In terms of Bitcoin, I think there's probably a weak negative correlation between stock prices and BTC. Some folks now see digital currencies as a hedge, but that has to be a tiny minority. Still, some money fleeing the broader market might end up there. I don't know that there's much data showing a significant correlation, despite the anecdotal evidence.
Probably not that much unless we are really entering recessionary conditions over it.
More often than not it goes in the direction of least slippage.
It's like this all day today. At moments it was like ~20 BTC sell for a 100 USD drop.
Go look at what shorts did from $10k to $12k riiight before the first precipitous drop to $6k 
(they went from 8k to 25k)

Also, believe it or not, I went back and looked: the move to $6.8k to $8k was only a short squeeze of about 2-3k shorts.

The other 12-13k shorts closed above $7.7k. They were sold into *after* the pump and held up the price. 

Craigc123 I think is his name? Or Craig something. Did a post on it looking at the 5m charts of shorts after the BGD. His comment is on the daily the day of or after the BGD
Reverse the scenario and this would have 50 upvotes lol, amazing!
Looks similar to our pump last night in the $7300’s. Slow climbing up with decreasing volume followed by 2 LGD’s 
People have now realised that we hit the floor for 2018 already. Watch this market pump!
DCA until zero and implode
Impossibly stressful trying to decide when to buy in again
if you are 20x short from 20k, how's your life now?
buddy of mine literally bought a lambo at about 18k, his stash was a little over 100 btc and maybe 4 - 5 btc worth of some alt, he sold $280k worth of btc to buy this lightly used convertible Huracan

I told him he was making a huge financial mistake but more power too him, gotta enjoy your money right?

No. A week later it dropped and never went back, his timing turned out to be incredible. I believe he has bought back most of what he sold sub $10k and I just think god damn you genius
how is your life.. 
Not mention Bitcoins
buy more coins again at these levels

Soon...
If you're waiting for 7600 then why not wait until 7800. everybody keeps saying heavy resistance and are going to short there
wait, since when is closing \*in\* the cloud bullish? I thought it was just a no trade zone

If the price never gets lower, that would be big indeed. ;)
Right. If there would be another massive pump it would probably be the last one. After that btc would either grow organically or die.
Yup. You can still trade on Kraken (if you're using it) via the manual order option though.
It’s undeniable that BTC has been and is being used as a hedge against global uncertainty by some people. Say what you will about the volatility, but it’s a moot point as people are using it this way regardless. The question is, does that use case actually have a meaningful impact on price currently and/or will it have a meaningful impact on price in the future. I’m of the opinion that this demand has already likely contributed in a relatively meaningful way to keeping the price where it is currently, and the demand isn’t just going to go away (unless global uncertainty does) 
Great entry!

High five, fellow deeloozheenal bull. It's delusion time!
Chart please
The 1 day as well... 
Not a super experienced trader, but i literally never saw a c&h play out in this bart meta...
Yes, it does, with a break above 7600 to confirm. But it also looks like a bull flag with the same resistance line, and since this market is so illiquid and people use such tight stops we tend to get a lot of rapid pumps and dumps ("bart") so the c&h seems more like chance to me.
No
Same as before. Bearish until we close a weekly candle over $12k. 

EDIT: Even then I'm concerned about bag holders dropping them off when we get there tbh
I'm curious what mindset the people who pick "same as before" had. But I guess that's not the point of this poll
Forgot option for "what color your lambo, bro?"
Bearish, bullish (april), Bearish again
Bullish for now as in that we'll see a reversal or bullish that we'll break 10k in the coming month?
Universe is about to balance itself and give you 23 losses. Can you just not short please thanks
same as it ever was. Price action in either direction brings out the memes.
Honestly the best TA .. even the most simple and classic is always right and wrong. Both possibilities exist and most likely the structures one builds from support and resistance will still play a major role, it can just land in different places you expect sometimes. The market is organic and you could have been very wrong too. There's no harm in discussing and arguing the potentials that exist in TA. It is those potentials that we can at least actually discuss, pure price prediction is nearly impossible, it is the reasons why you thought it would go here or there that are of importance here, not that it actually did. People will listen to you after you are humbly correct a few times and you explain your positions for everyone to verify, otherwise be ready for trolls.
Username checks out

Doing the same here and adding some leverage to the short
Great entry! What's your target for this short?

I personally have short positions on ETH and LTC as I expect these to lose more value against USD compared to BTC. ETHBTC ratio is already failing at previous support-turned-resistance, and LTC... well LTC has never been strong against BTC since the Litepay scandal, and its ratio has broken down from a large h&s formation on the daily. 

I expect a market breakdown in the next 12-16hrs.

Yes, it's 7500 for now. But tomorrow we'll be in a different world, and for that world another price might be better suited.

"Pricediscovery" happens all the time, because the world is changing all the time.
For now that's a lower high.

The volume is like 1/3 of the drop.
Price fell pretty hard for awhile. This shit always goes in cycles. I can't see why it would rise significantly from here (above 8k), but it can't just go down all at once. I'm expecting a failed test of $7750 or so with a retest of the 7k bottom here. After that... I'm not sure. Will be interesting to see if any big players dump off large numbers of coins at that price point.
What does it gives it term of information ?
Considering the size of the squeeze and rally, wouldn’t this still indicate a max of only around $7800?

I noticed that it is an ih&s looking thing too- unfortunately we have the lowest buying pressure on the advance of the right shoulder, which does not fit the volume profile of an ih&s at all

doesn't mean it won't perform though. Would be a target of about $7900-8000
Don't you need Fiat to chase shorts? Vitalik doesn't have lots if those. :)

I'm not even particularly bullish, but you can't ignore price action. It doesn't hurt to point out indicators, even if it goes against your conviction.
Downvotes are on low quality comments.

It just looks like bulls have only gut feeling to support their view.

31101.8998 to 20891.3288 

longs / shorts


right click, Change symbol, type in "shorts" or "longs", click first one, should say Bitfinex on the right 
Simple indicator there you can add to the bottom of your chart, shows levels . .  search for "BTCUSDSHORTS BTCUSDLONGS - Bitfinex BTC Shorts & Longs" . . . there is a chart overlay there somewhere also.
also it breaths normally. very reassuring.
You can feel the panic setting in 

actually idk if these buyers are scared at all. It's weird because no one is buying $7600+ but buyers are eating up these dips like it's free money lol 
>This looks like it’s going to dump.

Gut feeling orrrrr

> I have pretty much quite a lot of options now. I do not feel isolated in a trade, rather I feel glad and happy. :)

Having a lot of options = no confidence in any of them
I said it's a wedge... Nobody listened...
right onto a BRD
Make a thread. We should figure out what we want posted as a community and be specific about what we want in there. It's not an automated update... I hadn't ever looked at the calendar before.
There are a hell of a lot more longs underwater though. Both as a % and even moreso as a static number. 

There's ~$2,500 in damage to longs from the 1 month high compared to ~$500 in damage to shorts from the 1 month low. 
Agreed. I think ETH shorts are too juicy not to squeeze right now. I'm kind of surprised it hasn't bounced back yet with this in mind. If an ETH squeeze does happen, don't be surprised if BTC pumps up for a bit before bleeding back down.
shorting is inherently harder since there is a limited up(or down)side, something can only be worth 0. And also you have buying as the "natural" way to enter a market, and if you have 100 BTC profit when BTC is worth 2$, maybe that is not so fun

so yes
That's not a BGD, that's a MGD tops
Long right below major resistance.

No good, should probably wait it out
Watching them "buy the dip" like it was still 2017, on the way down from $1400 was pretty entertaining.

EDIT: To be fair to them, that strategy will have made a lot of them and many others a small fortune last year. Time and a place.
Hoping it does, mostly to have the pleasure of seeing the moonkids on ethtrader wine over their liquidated longs. That place has less TA than a kindergarden and they downvote every bearish post to oblivion. Its just canerous.
You meant top
I decided to close, as I was concerned by ETH's recovery.  And still concerned about the number of shorts open.

Might be a terrible call though, just wanted to take profit off the table.  There's a decent chance this move might not be done yet.
I closed my short from $7560 at $7440 mainly because it is night in Europe and I need to get some healthy sleep. 
I was underwater since the pump last night. [Posted about it here](https://old.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8nf6at/daily_discussion_thursday_may_31_2018/dzvwl6i/). I have us still on the wedge, so I could close now for a tiny loss or wait for it to break down. Nothing has really changed so I think I might wait it out for the latter and see if it breaks decisively. 
I've been getting wrecked shorting all the way up from 7, now I'm short from 7575 and this is the first one to work out for me. Took some hits to my trading stack so I can't afford to let this ride to B-E but I will probably close it at 7.5

I'm leaning bearish these days, and if I had to wager on any dump being the one I'd put my money on this one. Don't think we're seeing 7.8. Willing to be proven wrong in the next hour though. And if we do retrace the whole thing I'll be very impressed and will change my tune. But you can tell there's a hell of a fight going on right now, and I think the outcome might paint the narrative for the next few days at least.
I just closed mine, have some PTSD from last inverted bart this morning. Better to take profits quickly in this choppy area i think.
I'm an expert at holding underwater shorts. Targeting 6900 at the very least. Would only be surprised at anything less than 6200. 
"ta don't work here"

Well TA also arguably doesn't 'work' in traditional markets.

You only need to look at  various studies, a comprehensive one being Massey University, to see that TA gives results comparable to random chance.

Or go through the trading bot results here and compare the results to what you would achieve through random chance, it offers some great reading.
Yeah right at a local top..
Eth's behavior looks like stop hunting to me. Lots of underwater shorts from 550-560 and someone is hoping to squeeze them. 
lol what? thats breaking down hard?
Bulls stopping it so far
If you think this is oversold you must not have been looking at the charts for the past week.
I see it being oversold only on 15m. At 1h, 4h and 1d it is not oversold at all! So we can consolidate here for couple of hours and continue our adventure  in goblin town ;\)
We're on oversold on 1-15m, all higher time frames have a lot of room down.
These pullbacks are necessary to form higher lows and higher highs. Check out the 4hr timeframe, this pullback is right on schedule to form the higher low and continue to a new higher high.
7440 is bottom trenline of falling wedge, good chance we go true tho
Tight stops on that one, this thing is turning back up
https://www.tradingview.com/x/C2QtEPSw/

We broke through wedge.

I’m holding my short with stops at break even ( 7560) 
That black line seems to be well respected

https://www.tradingview.com/x/y09AIYOu/
6.8
I think they pump it just to catch shorters like you and then drop it 
gl lol
How do you call a 6% rise in 12h healthy? It's not as vertical as btc because its created by Bots trading the ratio. And we can say the same about the dumps also.
Slow steady growth with some pullbacks are healthy. This is not. 
1.3% loss is actually a phenomenal loss 

with bitcoin, you could go to sleep and wake up with a 15% loss just as easily 
That's a celebration if it's only 1.3% loss.

Just don't trade with your whole holdings stack.  Only trade 5% of it, because 1.3% loss on 5% is really nothing.

You should stick with trading **tiny** amounts until you can get desensitized to the ebb & flow of losses & gains.
Every trader has losses, otherwise we would all be billionaires. Just learn risk management to cut your losses and make more money and your wins
You get used to them over time. The 'right' move going by indicators and R/R will not always work out and the quicker you accept that the sooner you become a better trader. You want your trades to be based on reasoning and as soon as that reasoning ceases to exist cut your losses or else you're just gambling. 
Look at daily volatility. All yourself how much of a move in the timeframe you trade is noise and how much signal. Prepare mentally to ignore moves that are noise and to hold a position until signal is seen. Size your position accordingly.

Daily volatility is about 4% for btcusd, so 1.3% is mostly noise. Trading noise will give high variance outcome. This can be profitable over very many repeated trades, but an edge is hard to detect, and emotionally better suited for algorithms.
You win some, you lose some. The trick is to win more than you lose.

wierd but if eth dumps enough btc will probably follow to restore the equilibrium
Bounce off 7400 back up through 7600 would be great 
you wait for the Price to get High enough to buy for longterm ?
For the IH&S to be fulfillable or expected to complete it should be rising volume on the right side of the right shoulder. Which this doesnt have. So my bet is down we go.
They stopped for legal reasons
I was thinking about this as well the other day. Stamp was one of the first exchanges to start using SegWit but they've really been dragging their heels with the margin trading update.
IMO I don't think it is going to hold.  Will see in a few...
The 15m candles post-dump tell quite the story right now. A real struggle going on.
Working fine for me.
All I’ve been seeing for the passed few weeks is “Bitmex down” .. “cant access Bitmex”.. “Bitmex shit f!?# c#!?”. If people have this many problems on a platform and they post it here to shit...why do people still use it and this support it? Or am I just in the dark

You think $7k is the bottom so you're selling 13% above it? 
i tried the same on my phone and managed to hose everything when i was trying to zoom. I fixed this problem by never visiting tradingview on my phone.
You can lock things you draw so they stay put, it's what I do.
The same happened to me on iPhone and iPad - I messed up all my lines just trying to zoom and pan. And even switching from portrait to landscape mode does not work reliably, I sometimes have to exit and restart. As good as the browser experience with tradingview is, as bad is the iOS app (and apparently also the Android one).

Also, I don't get why they don't enable push alarms on the iOS and Android apps. Probably because the highly-priced SMS alerts are better for business.
We've had incredible news (NYSE, Nasdaq, Coinbase ramping up) and it hasn't moved the market.  It seems good news doesn't move the btc price anymore.  Other factors have been in control after the peak.  Maybe retail investors responded to good news and larger investors and traders are in control now and don’t care about good news because they already know it is coming soon.
Same. Fuck, i judt wanted to pull all my orders to spend a nice day.

Personification of the market into two caricatures is a fool's errand. I know you're joking but still..

Ridiculous, are you implying that we will bart?!
Price went down from 9,900 to 7,000 in less than a month and went up from 7,000 to 7,500 in the last 3 days. YEAH, bears are so exhausted...

Removed because of rule 3. Just take a moment to review the sidebar. I'm sure this was just a one time impulsive quip.
Mining equipment is reaching Moore's law limits, which means ASICS performance doesn't increase 100x every six months anymore, that's the reason the growth of the hashrate is stabilizing. That's the sole reason for this.
Plateauing?

It seems like it’s still going straight up.

Do you mean why the difficulty is not increasingng as much as it used to? Why the slope is declining?

[Difficulty](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty) is not the same as [target](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Target) value.

Difficulty was created to help people understand the whole retargeting thing.

If difficulty is X, it means it will take X times as long to mine a block in expectation as at difficulty 1 (assuming constant hash rate)

For target that would mean

If the target at difficulty 1 is Y, i.e. the block header hash has to be below Y < 2^256

Then the target at difficulty X is Y/X, I believe.

There’s an inverse relationship.
Agreed, how dare they sell their ETH!! 😡😡😡

I wouldn’t be to confident. Last drop to 6k was also moving around 7k for a while. Also i haven’t seen a confirming reversal as the previous 2 times we’ve visited 6k. 
I’m still positively bullish on bitcoin, but more in terms of a few years, but not for the coming weeks.

I actually mentioned this sub and about how crypto can bring people together from all parts of the world and create a community. Mentioned how they might just be internet friends, but they can definitely be a major part of your life. 

Talked about TA, and actually did a live drawling of some Technical Analysis on a big screen. I mentioned Bart’s and the audience got a good chuckle. 
Not gonna lie at this point it looks more like a channel than a falling wedge to me.

Edit: Ah, I see you. Yeah, I agree.
I feel like volume has been a major issue with the majority of our formations on the way back down from 10k.

The pattern fits perfectly, but the volume never matches up 
your starting point for the wedge is completely arbitrary. all it would take is a rejection from $8200 to turn that into a channel. 

why not start it here? https://www.tradingview.com/x/SxeZ8Qfx/

lol

https://www.tradingview.com/x/Qzy6jI1d/

that is the wedge everyone was talking about before it failed to breakout. EDIT: I drew it wrong, the support line was steeper, but point stands. 

wedges are meme patterns because you can just redraw them once they fail
Funny

> Market is overwhelmingly bullish

You have an interesting personal definition of "bullish".
market being overwhelmingly bullish is another reason to short.

Care to elaborate further why its such a terrible decision?
I actually like the sub better during bear markets. I’ve been out of the country and out of the loop with crypto, and this week I started my summer internship (at a bank lol). I’ll shit post from time to time when I’m bored at work
In hindsight it was stupid of me not to cash out above 16K when all signs pointed to an end of a bubble. I was so close to retirement and I wanted it so bad I stubbornly held on incase we’d blow past 20K and head towards 50K. I made the same mistake more than once, this time I knew better but I still couldn’t abandon my BTC before I reached my financial goal... which I still think is inevitable, so I don’t regret it. Although if I did sell I could’ve had twice the amount of BTC now, greed is a hell of a drug 
I don’t. I cashed out around 2 BTC at an average of 13K, that’s pretty much all the cash I’m living off of right now 
Normies are peasants to me now, why the fuck should I care what they think
I still have a long open on bitmex from 7630, but I get funding payed so let's see when the market moves back how things go 
Not much of it was BTC, mostly the other top big top 10. ETH was very long term but the market looks so weak so I will not wait another 8 months for it to maybe reverse like last year

I will wait until the 1D moving average cross and we at least get 2 weeks of green and healthy volume before buying back in bigger amounts
Yeah, for sure. Or what is your point? Buying into a trending strong market regardless of multiple is the preferred thing for me
nope all fiat. I don't hold BTC during a bear market. Now once we enter a bull run and go past $12,000..yeah then I'll favor BTC. 

and yes patience pays off, but not when we are testing a pretty significant support line and only bounce a few percentage points. And I'll have plenty of chance to reload while it takes the bulls time to take down $7800
Chad and Binary echo chamber are my buy signal watchtowers.
Except that Bitcoin has a long history of just the sort of thing Chad described. We could easily see $10K by Monday and $12K within a couple weeks. Not saying that's how it will go, but it's not fantasy at all. I think that just last year we doubled over a period of one month three or four times. I doubt there's a year in Bitcoin's history when it didn't happen at least once.
I remember after the mt gox crash all I had left was fantasies and heavy bags. Turns out reality was more wild than my wildest fantasies :)
Up. Hard and fast.
I remember saying in like February how no one would be FOMOing in at $9k in April at the ATH resistance line because it'd be so low...lol man how wrong I was. 

this market is so god damn bullish. I don't think the bullishness will ever be beaten out of it. We could be at $2k and people would be bullish over a push to $3k
Actually he's talking about 12k, nerd.
It's just a perk of being Chad
yea you are right i frequently use the wrong names for these things. i guess i meant to say ascending triangle.
It doesn't matter what I think. Time does not exist. We have no free will.
Yeah Point of Control is super useful!
Yes it's a beautiful indicator! 

Need to look at in more in depth. I've never been able to explain why the rejections have felt so much harsher than the bounces but now I think it's probably because the volume downwards has been much higher than upwards 
> most people don't use it that far back, 

What do you mean? I'd like to understand the indicator before I put a lot of faith into his analysis, although my personal feelings align with it already obviously. Just want to make sure I'm using the indicator right before putting stock into it
Note that my comment was before either of the last 2 big green candles. That said I don't think the mismatched shoulders nor the volume match a textbook inverted H&S
Patience. There is a iH&S with shoulder line at 7600, so of course it will be hard to break through. If we don't we may fall back down but probably not by much. And if we break through resistance we probably won't go up much before coming back down. I feel this is going to be very choppy for a while.
$2 dollar M&Ms.
$2 m- m- mike XBTs. 

2 million dollars
It's a bad convention adopted by finance and marketing peeps, but it's convention nonetheless.

Reason:

m is 1 thousand in Roman numerals, therefore mm should actually be 2 thousand \(it's additive\), but instead it's considered to be m x m \(i.e. 1 million\).

Since mm means millimetres and since I'm an engineer/scientist, I much prefer 1k or 1M \(i.e. metric\).

Definitely not opening a trade anytime soon. The next obvious trade is a short from $7800. Which I dont think we will get there in the next 12-24 hours ish.

Great advice

Hope yall can stay sane and solvent that long.

I have absolutely zero faith in buyers to do anything but fuck this up here.

Still planning to exit above $7,600. 
If you're on twitter and subscribed to the crypto talking heads, you see a lot of this. Not going to bother even linking because I'm basically saying what I read and none of it is verifiable.

Even if this was true though and only retail and some whales left on exchanges, I don't necessarily see this as bullish news as you don't know the intentions of OTC buyers.
If you have more than 10K twitter followers and you state this, then yes it's the truth 
That is what I am hoping for, and will allow me to chill out a bit. I hung onto my position last time too long, not a great trader, mostly have been lucky. And if we are still bearing around past December, maybe I can dig up some loose change a bit longer. 

I can guarantee i will deploy that last 25% too soon, that's for sure. 
Entitled to this opinion, not saying that I'll be right or optimal use of capital. Not even saying that I'm not stupid.

>  Protectionism is a two-edged sword -- for every worker than benefits, there are others that get punched in the gut.

Economics teacher here: It's worse that that. For every worker that benefits, there are quite literally dozens of people who will pay more in higher prices because of such tariffs. Trade creates economic casualties as production moves to those with comparative advantages (ie foreign producers), but creates additional surplus well beyond the the concentrated losses. Tariffs are simply the reverse.

So tripling in shorts is a lot of sell pressure. So much so that the price couldn't get above it's trend line resistance. I'm not sure what is surprising about that. Right now we are coming off of a downtrend right above our support line. The R/R for shorting right now isn't that great and yet people are still doing it. That's why I call it bullish.

This is the same thing as shorting last time at 6.8. Shorts went up to 40k and we had the biggest short squeeze ever. If shorts went up right now to 30k and we hold this price, yeah, that would be super bullish and we'd get another short squeeze. We're not quite there yet, only at 20.6k, but I don't expect the shorts to rise that high nor do I expect another short squeeze.
I agree but the market is very different now than it was then. We were fresh from ATH early Feb and volatility was great. 
LGD lolol

Well I can console myself with the fact that he bought a meme car
Did you become rich or at least bought some new cars, toys etc?
Because I got in this trade accepting that I could end up with a 3% loss, 7800 would be almost a 5% loss if it breaks through it. My usual risk tolerance for any trade is 2%. If I'm wrong then I rather cut my losses and get out.
You can go edge to edge, which is my least favorite trade because ya you're chopping sideways in the cloud, so not the most bullish thing but it adds one more support zone.   Which apparently broke, so not that great but support in the tekan sen and kijan sen is there, cloud breakouts/breakdowns are better for trading. 
!short XBTUSD add 7542.5 0.5x

Yeah, miscalculated this a bit so just repairing.
You can draw at least 4 different formations now on different time frames, so I'm going here more with a feeling that this doesn't have enough fuel to go much up.
aren't ascending triangles some of the most reliable bullish formations resulting in breakouts?
Have increased my stack by 250% the last 2 weeks by shorting alone so ofc I might keep shorting ;)
All those shorts are going to get screwed sooner or later , it's been too profitable for them during the last week , BTC doesn't like that

There ya go, sorry for the extra lines but I think you can find the wedge. https://imgur.com/q6TLWfo  (the box was my target related to the previous breakdown for my previous short that ended up closing at break even, it wasn't related to the wedge.)
This is a noob question, but I've had some people tell me that left side of the cup and handle pattern needs to be higher (setting a resistance on the left side of the cup) and right side lower (unable to break the left side resistance) then form a handle. In this situation, the right side of the cup formed a higher resistance. Does that matter typically or no? I'm trying to learn but I'm having trouble finding a concrete answer. Thanks again.
I'm a same as before girl. I don't reckon the price is going to make significant moves for a lengthy time. And by significant I mean below 5 and beyond 9 grand. 
They could just be hella bullish the entire time
 or super bearish. A lot of people think this huge triangle is just  noise
Anything you want Ethmeplz 
How low will it go, what do you think?
I agree, doesn't look good.  If we do go back down, there is likely to be a wick first.  Have put +1% sell orders in.

I am sticking to eth and btc (I am actually long eth from around 509, but it is more of a hold - I think it has better prospects longterm and it was a good point to buy in. The slippage on the buy button was literally from 498 all the way to 509 - insane). 

If we go down at all (nothing is certain) then I am watching for a bounce at 7400, the current short-term rising support line. If we don't break through with some gusto then another attempt at 7600 seems likely within the scope of the current wedge.
those 2 I just bought 6 hours ago.

Forgot to close this ages ago
Yah I'm not turning bullish below 7.8k.
One box is bigger. One has a line pointed at it.
Fractals generally suggest a similar pattern playing out, albeit on a larger or smaller scale. Given the first BGD was $1300, and this recent pump was $400 though, it may be more academically interesting than tradeable at this point.
I don't think it indicates anything. Just thought it's interesting.

Cheers. Nice spot!!
Yep! You're absolutely right. I was just being a bit light hearted.

If it was to confirm, RSI would be up high enough to put that huge hidden bearish divergence in play. Hmmmmm. Gotta love trading!!
> Vitalik doesn't have lots if those.

Yeah i'm sure all those conferences he speaks at pay him in Doge.
It must have crashed, only the PMs one was working.
Restarted it and your entry was saved.
Agreed there just a lot of chumps on here that downvote anything positive
Yea, and the history of 9 years of a constant uptrend, but who cares about that, certainly not bears, they have their magical tea leaves and memelines on rainbow charts.
I have a gut feeling you're right
That's not surprising, because fundamentals and technical (the chart) do not look encouraging for them.  So all they can do is base it on their gut/fantasies.


Oops \- sorry, the labels were annoyingly big

Bars = BTCUSD

Red = BTCUSDSHORT

Green = BTCUSDLONG

all Bitfinex
You and me both

That's an intriguing idea.  I wonder how I could go about creating a single line ratio of the two.  Hmmmm, back to tooling around with it.  Thanks for the input
So, it looks like we're nowhere near a short squeeze like we were last time at 6.8k
Thanks! That's what I needed

It looks sad and tired. Everything. Bch is back uner 1000, ltc is tired of life, eth isn't able to chase shorts, btc is barting around like a sad panda on 0 volume. No need to be a genius to see where this is heading.
yep I RESPECT TA but I don't it because I don't know how. I made crazy money during the last bullrun following my gut. Come at me bro. Follow me on twitter and join my paid telegram group. 
eth is dumping, and that's good enough for me.
Depends on the asshole, depends on the dildo 
This is not the nicest thing to say, especially when you quoted me..
I actually listened to you and went short 5x at 7,560 \+ added a bit later. So thanks a lot for your insight! I guess I need to go learn geometry now :D
It is a wedge but it looks like one more trip up before the point.
it would be a BGD they said... it would fuck over bears they said...
Are you still bearish Chewy?
Yeah. There are lots of longs stuck from 8000-9400. I noticed the crash actually brought in a lot of new people who were savvy enough not to FOMO the blow off top. Most of those guys are now under water and enough coins have changed hand to fuel some sub 6k capitulation imo: https://imgur.com/a/PyFdZ8f
to elaborate

If you short X contracts, your profit can only ever be at most X usd (denominated in BTC). Your BTC profits are unbounded.

If you long X contracts, your profits in BTC can only ever be at most the position size (denominated in BTC) at entry. Your USD profits are unbounded.
Oh come on, it's been a slow day! Enjoy!
On the last 4 positions opened in the bot, 1 was a short and 3 were longs from above 7500. One was from theEchonomist because he closed his by mistake and ended up opening a new one smaller so that one only counts as half :) 

I wouldnt long until we get a nice bart down

Wouldnt short until we get a nice bart up
My favorite meme on ethtrader is the "last time for sub-$X00 ETH!"

Last time until the next time...  I almost hope this weekly equilibrium pattern breaks bearish just so I can read comments on ethtrader.
I don't think I've ever seen the word "short" on that sub. It's always been ethhodler. 
Random chance is the same as rolling dice. And rolling dice has no human thought input that influences the outcome. Professionally trading involves thought input, which influences outcomes.
I use 4h moving averages as main indicator when to go long and short, tell me how this is bad https://www.tradingview.com/x/UlHAWy1x

Crypto is extremely momentum driven so those indicators works well.

Anyway it was only an example , I did not want to start some TA works vs not but in general why BTC should be not like any other market since nothing points to this
I can still bail out above breakeven in the worst case scenario or add lower. So it doesn't matter to me a lot. 
I've been watching for the same thing all day. ETH shorts seem particularly juicy right now, and this could lead to a big pop up in BTC if the squeeze is successful. It looks like whoever opened those shorts has plenty of capital left to protect their position though, as this attempt to break out has failed pretty spectacularly so far.
Impressive, really.

Support around 7350, this may wick back up...
I'm down for goblin town!
Don't you logic at this sub! Moon or goblins, nothing else.
I suppose the continual moves down from ATH have been 'necessary' also right?

Oh yeah no that didn't work did it. 
but that would be good for him..?
Terrific analysis.
I think it just looks healthier in terms of it's not a straight line upwards. ETH is moving up steadily but BTC is moving up in little spurts
The same way 6% drops in 12h are healthy.
It’s definitely done much more but I do believe there will be a slight pull back soon. Maybe healthy wasn’t the right word. I just noticed how smooth it was after those 2 BGDs and not choppy but I never really thought about the bots trading the ratio. 
This is good advice. 
Chewy said it best:

> My preferred approach is to define a likely narrative for future movement when I enter a position, and then hold my position until that narrative is proven wrong.
This is a good response.  A good way to set a chart up for easy visualisation of this is with a 24 MA envelope set to 5%, on the 1 hour time frame. 
Generally, jokes related to mortality are very problematic in this sub because there is a real and dark history with that. Let's try to avoid that so I don't get reports about it.

Sorry for the serious post. I know you meant well.
Bring that bitch to it's knees hahah
Btc holding very strongly dispite the eth dump 
It looks to me like we're going way higher than 7600. There's kind of a perfect storm brewing for one of Bitcoin's legendary massive green daily candles ( > 10%, which we haven't seen even once this year, very oddly) followed by a run up lasting weeks. End of week coinciding with end of month means many people all over the world getting paid at the same time. Probably a big short running out of time to cover. Jitters in traditional markets, especially the Italian situation. Lots of fuel here. 
yes... awaiting it will pass the 7600.. and when it is there for 1 -2 days I will buy!!
did you ask them by email? or did they ever post an announcement (couldn't find anything on their twitter etc.)
Same here.
Because it allows for incredibly fast and easy access to high leverage with minimal KYC

> why do people still use it and this support it? Or am I just in the dark

Extremely liquid, offers up to 100x leverage - higher than 3.3x bfx offers, people would still use it if it were even only 10x, is very trustworthy with an established reputation, and has no KYC/AML laws

This probably belongs in the alt thread.

[removed]
Then why are you waiting to buy higher? 
I explicitly called it "greedy limit". This market has allot of random volatility, if I a permabull feel the price is moving to fast upwards, the chance of a retrace are rather high. And it costs nothing if it happens to random walk the other way.

If we were to be 8k an hour from now would you not think that 7.5ish would be expected shortly after?
How do you do that, on the tablet?
The bear trend sentiment repressed positive news. But perhaps if not for these positive news btc would have dropped even further.
Yeah. I am happy I am out of position right now. Feel sorry for people with 10x\+ leverage...
Maybe it's an ascending Liza pattern instead this time

or maybe a more exotic Lester pattern? http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/Lester
Bears such as the American Black Bear and the Grizzly Bear hibernate in the winter. Their heart rates drop from a normal 55 to only 9!
Price went from 5k to 20k in 35days last bullrun so whats your point? Reality is right now, at this moment, bears are getting ripped to shreds
You can draw your line from any point to tell whatever story you want. The only lines I care about are the one that starts in 2009 and the one that starts where I entered my position.

But yeah, they're exhausted. Looks like the big ones are out of ammo.
It is relevant, on topic.
I dare say that most of the people who were once holding out for 16k to sell have changed their minds and either already sold or left them in cold storage. It's been six months.

Of course, that's what people said in 2014, and it took another six months to truly bottom out. =|

if it can rise $1k in a few minutes why not $20k in few months lol
Would it not be that the number of miners is at a stable rate too (i.e. fewer/no new miners in the picture)? Even if mining performance doesn’t improve at the same rate, surely increased number of miners fishing for the same reward would drive up the difficulty too?
Ah my bad. I meant the rate of the rate of increase. I guess the fact that the rate of increase is always positive makes sense. But if it's increasing it should mean it's becoming more profitable to mine right? While it's just flat it means the innovation is just chugging along getting better due to economy of scale \(or whatever the phrase is\).  


As for target \- not too familiar with this. Is it a better measure of 'mining power'?

by british inches I mean centimeters. lol 165 cm
what the article didn't mention (at least not that I saw) is that it spiked because of bots that monitor Binance's new coin listings and immediately buy up whatever is announced.  Since I'm sure that no one was expecting a stablecoin to be listed, it obviously caught them off guard.

Semi-related, but seeing as TUSD/BTC market on Binance and Bittrex is essentially the same as BTC/USD, I have to wonder how parallel they end up being in price and if there are any arbitrage opportunities.  By this I don't mean arbitrage opportunities in the traditional sense, but rather, if the price of BTC tanks at a given time and the rest of the altcoins follow it, TUSD/BTC will presumably be green.  And when the typical Binance idiot sees one coin going big time green in a sea of red, I wonder if they would end up driving up the price of TUSD to the point that there is a significant difference between the value of TUSD and the value of Tether.
I’ve actually been pretty excited for tUSD. It’s what tether is supposed to have been the whole time. Actual consistent audits. Every time I convert to tether I have anxiety because I feel like that’ll be the day when it comes out that it’s BS. 
Upside down?

Looks like you may need some new glasses.
Nobody ever made money doing crack.
It depends. I like all kinds of safe fun. Like trading with what I can afford to lose. Dangerous fun is not for everyone.
Oh crap, I'm sorry, and thanks! I already knew that from a few weeks ago (I'm Lambertville). Very cool that you went to speak at a college. 
Which exit?
If you make a personal rule to never cross a certain margin threshold (say, 10x or 25x), Bitmex is still much better than Kraken. The low liquidity and super high fees almost make margin trading not worth the risk on Kraken.

Greed can always cause people to bend the rules though, so I understand your concern.
People from US have to use VPN for Bitmex, am I right? How do they report taxes? \(if they do\) :\)
Kraken fees are insane. You can lose a lot of money just overtrading on that garbage exchange too :)
would have loved to be there broski
I edited to posted a chart that agrees with you.
How do you get several exchanges into one chart, when i try and copy what is on yours it finds no results. :\) 
Lol.  I didn't start it there, that's just where it happened to end up.  I was working from the low at 7040 through 7270, and it coincidentally landed on a third point of contact.
well he was ironically shit posting to short this the entire way down from $9k. Now he's unironically saying not to short, so his ironic advice might be better than his genuine advice 
wow man you must be in your early 20s and you have 6-7 figures in wealth? fuck me im such a loser:(
Why you working for the devil son! lol. 
Cant always sell the top, use BTC to enhance life regardless of price.
Likewise but for this to truly to go crazy, we do kinda need normies getting in and their negative perception of us doesn't help
I can never get myself to sell what I feel is too low or during big drops.  Although I get it cuz we could go lower and take a long time to get higher so it makes sense, but no idea how some do it with all or most their crypro.  I took some profit at 18k and get it above 10k but with such a huge retrace I just can't do it after like a .786 fib retrace, even though it could be the correct move.  But congrats for sleeping easy, nothing like a peace of mind and securing money is always good.
well done!!!
it has been easy on you not because you are on fiat but because the market went down. so you think you are a genius. if the market were going up, then you'll be stressed to get back in.

you only get out once you are emotionally disconnected from the market. since you are commenting here and following the price it means you are not
Yeah, could also easily see $5k. 

Last years rapid and gigantic rise was likely a once in a lifetime event requiring global media mania, every person in the office buying BTC.

Considering most of those people got burnt and the media is tired of crypto for now at least, where do you expect all of this money to come from?
I didn't say it's 100% impossible.  I said, it's a fantasy, which is what it is.  But down 60% for the year, I get that you must hold onto to some kind of hope, however implausible.
2k to 3k is a 50&#37; gain, so yeah, people would be bullish about it.
That's why the bottom will be at 1150! 



https://i.imgur.com/p4cIexA.png
It's great for seeing where institutional money is putting their volume, more for forex etc but BTC uses it some. 
Just like trend lines it's best to go right to left so you get the most current action, you're going to get more recent volume and nodes which will help your current outlook. 

If you're looking for bubble outlook you can go back years and it will show more volume in the 1-2k range, so what ever you're looking to produce.  
So depends how you want to use it, think about what time frame works for what you're trading and zoom out or in to the chart.  Do you think the last 3 months paints a good current picture for you or you want the last 3 years to help you decide where to go.  

I'm using [this year](https://snag.gy/kSJjfm.jpg) as it's been ranging sideways for a lot of it and I can see resistance and support pretty good, but you can go back farther if you think we're going to drop a lot and find support zones there. 

Edit; Ignore the trend lines it got messed up. 
Agreed, but a minuscule 50 dollar pump to 7600 that gets killed below 7600 isnt exactly bullish
>$2 dollar M&Ms.

Long term goal is to increase my trading stack to a giant Scrooge McDuck vault full of M&M's. 

>m is 1 thousand in Roman numerals, therefore mm should actually be 2 thousand \(it's additive\), but instead it's considered to be m x m \(i.e. 1 million\).

Curious. Why do you believe that it should be additive? In basic algebra, it would be multiplied as it is in finance.

Edit: When I was in business school, taking finance courses, we were taught that M was for Latin mille (meaning thousand), and MM was to be read as "thousand thousands". 
I know history might not repeat itself again since everyone knows about it now. But if I was expecting a proper bounce off this floor, I'd still put my money on it being on the 6th. 

[https://imgur.com/a/jfXtNls](https://imgur.com/a/jfXtNls)
Tbh I'm staying to lose faith in sellers. This shouldn't be bought up so quickly. They're starting to do what buyers did. Pushing it and just letting it go.
Thanks! This quick pump back to 500 spooked me, so it was nice to see you took it as a chance to add instead.
Lol
Hah, yeah hold off on using that 25% for the first “bear trap” of the next market cycle.  Otherwise, yes it will be too easy to put it in too early.  And then the market falls another 25% and you’re wishing you could add more. 
Ethmeplz's comment backs me up here. Look at his comment history and tell me you'd trust him with yo money...

The $2000/month was pulled from the 3000-5000 range. Price discovery didn't really happen in this range, I see 3k as a "too cheap to ignore" bottom, cuz the most you could realistically lose from 3k is 40% drop to 1.8k, which is probably a wick anyway. 5k is another psychological level we've reacted to in the past that I find a good candidate. All pulled out of my ass but smells right to me 😂
Dont take his advice. Wait a month? This is crypto where ALOT can happen in a month. Dumbest thing I heard all day lol
The r/r for shorting here is huge actually. A move down from the triangle would signal a completely new downtrend with a very low target, around $4.5-6k before a significant bounce.


There is a good reason the price gets swatted down from $7550+ every single time it's gotten there the past few days. 

But longs are buying into it anyway just like shorts did when we were in the $6ks

and I don't get your point, so shorts opening here is bullish  but back then it was bearish because...?? Shorts didn't cause the dump to $6k, they just anticipated it

All I'm saying is shorts opening here are a little smarter than shorts that opened at $6.5k 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/3ILe6fFH/

notice the difference in short price action on each drop from the local high. 

1. shorts anticipated the drop, strong hands knew we had to move lower
2. shorts piled on as the price tanked, eventually causing a short squeeze that held up the price *after* the pump
3. shorts have remained relatively flat/even went down on this move down. There is no cushion to support the price this time like there was after the BGD.

it was weird at the time and in hindsight, it was clear someone knew about Kobayashi's dumps. There was talk about a "big shorter" back then.

OK cool. Best to stick with your strategy and not listen to others. I was just curious as to why.
What’s your target?

I’m assuming $7400 
Problem is that you can also draw ascending wedge here.
In the last month almost every single ascending triangle broke down. Which is the opposite of what should happen. 
I’m not sure, but this entire bear market has been an absolute shit show for T.A. 

You can’t really rely on formations for trade off of. Yes they can definitely help dictate the next move. But trading off horizontal support/resistance, general resistance/support areas is definitely a little safer
Yes except volume is more important. Volume has to increase too
great... keep shorting!!


“It works until it doesn’t” Always read that on here and it’s so true. Get on a hot streak and then BAM BGD..
be sure you got the $$ to cover
Sustaining that for 48 hours... I hope he can buy a nice vacation with his returns.
Probably not stop hunting if it was only on Binance then
That's not a rising wedge. Rising wedges usually form at the top of a run. We literally just broke out of a falling wedge then dropped down to find support. If anything, all you have is a support line. 
Thanks bud!!
C&H should have a flat horizontal resistance. The fact that the resistance is sloping already makes it a dubious C&H. I'll make your life easier, though. Almost all patterns are just some basic shape. A C&H, for example, is really just an ascending triangle but with only two points on the resistance line before a break through. As long as you can identify resistances and supports and understand when they break then pattern shapes tend to not matter as much.
Why not? Do you think it's just going to coil forever? Haha 

Weekly bbands generally pop pretty big with btc 
Same as before— clueless


If I’M clueless, 95% of this sub is clueless too
lmao msg me on ig tell me what u went to prison  for 
If the rising wedge plays out it could fall to 7050 ish but bulls may be desperate to make a higher low so 7.1-2K is a possability. or we could go lower and test 6.8K
To continue the downward trend, sub $7k in the coming weeks.

A few days &#37; gain doesn't change what's happening.
Definitely bullish.

Too be honest, it seems like whatever side is being downvoted might be an indicator in its own right. Last week all the bearish comments were being downvoted.
You know, it can't go up forever.

This is trading sub, we trade here, doesn't really matter where it'll be in a year, it matters where it'll be when I close my trade.
Yes 2014 to 2016 was really "constant uptrend".  You are looking at imaginary chart and we are looking the one from reality.
Shorts aren't nearly above longs tho right? that's just the two lines overlaying each other with no axis ya? 
Right. Keep in mind the shorts didn't squeeze the price up, they actually all closed mainly after the pump.. They held the price up *after* we were trying to dump back down
20,000 shorts getting squeezed is plenty. Wouldn't take much of a nudge to get the party started.

Why? I'm making a point about uncertainty. It's not a personal attack on you.
Glad to hear, hope you'll get out with nice profit.
That's the point, the are so many formations here, hard to follow this. We broke a wedge within a wedge within triangle...
I'll be bearish until this formation breaks to the upside:

https://imgur.com/a/5cYeeJM

I see it as far more likely that it'll break down than up, but my opinion will change if the market can make it back into the $8,000s. 
While this is technically true, I think people forget that the potential downside can expand exponentially as well. A 10x short from $10k to:

$1k gives a 9000% ROE
$100 gives 99000% ROE
$10 gives 999000% ROE
$1 gives 9999000% ROE
$0.5 gives 19999000% ROE
$0 gives infinite ROE

So while a short technically can’t go lower than $0, the profits you can yield from a short can still approach infinity.

(EDIT: Though yes, I do see what you’re saying about these profits being in BTC, not USD)
>If you long X contracts, your profits in BTC can only ever be at most the position size (denominated in BTC) at entry. 

~~This is wrong, or am I misunderstanding?~~

I get you, but don't use BGD name in wane, when BGD comes bears buttholes burn and vibrate. This one just tickles them.

Long @ 7400 

Short @ 7700 

I will not allow bart to make me his bitch. 
I agree with you and I hate the state of the market right now. Maybe I should research VPN, sign up for MEX and hire a full time nanny to take care of my kids.
If the bears can't push this further down i'm closing my shorts for a loss. This will get back up fast.
Dream on.
Absolutely! No equity goes up continuously. Zoom out. We started 2017 at 1k...we went to 20k..we're at 7k now...next stop will be a new ATH
Nah he means MMs want to catch me and want to hit my stops before dropping. They are targeting the bad bears.
Still long from 7350. Wondering if I should close and open a short. I tightened up my stops
That’s what I was trying to imply but for lack of a better word I can see how it got misinterpreted.
I also said that. Nothing healthy on the movements we're seeing. 
I might have come too strong, i understand your point and is valid, but we need to read the reasons behind before acting on it.

The hard part is choosing a point at which that narrative becomes unlikely to play out. 

Let's take my current short position as an example. 

My chosen narrative at the time I entered ($7,360) was that the bull flag had broken down and the market was going to continue to decline  below $7,000. 

Well, that didn't immediately play out as I'd hoped...but just because the market jumped 3% above my entry doesn't mean my narrative won't still play out eventually. 

The point of no return for my narrative is likely to be $7,800+. But that's too far away from my entry to wait that long to cut my losses. 

The reality is that I entered at a bad time for my risk tolerance. 

I should have either waited for the larger triangle formation to break down below $7,000 or waited for $7,550 for my short entry. Or at least had far tighter stops on my short. 

But for now my narrative is still possible (perhaps even likely). So despite the fact that the trade is underwater, I'm holding it for now.

Yes it would. 5 monkeys trying to find the bitcoin block reward will occur quicker than 2 monkeys trying.  
Source: Have mined bitcoin with Monkeys using abacus in the past.
Yes it'd increase hashrate too, but that graph uses logarithmic scale, which is something to take into account too.

Hashtate can't keep growing exponentially forever, it'll eventually "only" double or triple every year, instead of increasing 1000 fold.

That said I don't know about new miners tbh, there might be new ones, I just know nothing about that world.
Right, so you’re referring to the second derivative being negative?

forget about the target nuance. It doesnt relate. My bad

Seriously though, what’s up with Reddit’s obsession with the neck beard? Almost every sub I visit reference the darn thing. 
Got ya, I did think it would be some kind of pun. 
Why did you get a vote and I didn't. IT WAS MY IP!
i have three big problems with TrueUSD and view them as arguably worse than tether.

1.) no msb license. This is required for them to send or receive greater than 10k in the US. Without this they are subject to be shut down at any time.. no they dont have a pending application. even if they did, there is no grace period.

2.) clawback policy - the terms and conditions cover about 6 clauses that could allow them to clawback/cancel the token on you. 

3.) what theyve posted so far is not an audit. regardless of how they shape it. It falls into he same vein that people had issues with tethers provided document last year. it may be truthful but not a certified audit.

Circle's proposed product USDC is the only alternative to tether i would consider if i needed a stable coin at this point.


The possibility of audits is good. Reaching $1.09 less so. It seems really hard for anything to keep its peg. 
Rick James?

Well you can always buy back when the trend reverses and get stronger. A lot of people on reddit have their "cashout targets" which in my opinion is an amateur mistake, since this means they don't have confidence that they are good traders and can enter any market at any price if it shows strength
Sorry but I have no idea what you are talking about, why would I be thinking I am a genius? Why would I be stressed to get back in? 
You can sell your coins and then continue to trade.. 
It's not a fantasy because it has already happened many, many times. 

By the way, I'm way, way up even on what I bought this year. December means nothing to me. Did not buy or sell between October (bought the dip in September) and February. It's just a glimpse of things to come as far as I'm concerned. 
okay $10 to $15 you goob
Still pretty confused, are you saying  the indicator itself is useless? 
Simply because that's how Roman numerals work (additive or subtractive, not multiplied) and, in this case, 'mm' is based on Roman numerals (I'm fairly confident I'm correct here, but don't mind being proven wrong).

For example:
VIII is 8 (i.e. 5+1+1+1), not 5.

One really shouldn't use a convention based on Roman numerals, but ignore how it actually works. I think the 'mm' convention was probably originally adopted by someone who thought it sounded clever, but misunderstood the basic concepts behind it.

This might all sound pedantic, but nomenclature matters and misuse of terms can lead to confusion.
> we were taught that M was for Latin mille \(meaning thousand\), and MM was to be read as "thousand thousands". 

 M is indeed mille \(i.e. 1,000\), but I'm pretty sure MM is 2,000 and M \(with a flat bar over it is\) is 1 million.
I would not trust any of you morons with my money =)

I am guessing the range is more like a low of $4k-5k, if everyone wants $3k, wont happen. Also, at that price will get picked up fast (25% set aside), imo. 

Or we could range around here a bit and square app opens up lightning channel, boom. So i have a bit of perma bull, in that regard. 




I listen to all opinions, but no, die is cast. The market corrected a high enough % where i am comfortable to let it ride.

He may very well may be right. Most markets, including past btc markets, would argue for this position. But, I'm thinking this cycle may go faster than before and am willing to deal with the outcome. 
We moved down 30% with barely any relief / consolidation in between. We then bounced a few percent up after 'almost' reaching a long-term support. For a short-term / scalping play this isn't a terrible spot if you're convinced this go at $7500 resistance is going to fail again, but to say that this is 'huge' r/r for shorting in general is crazy, there's no real reason to believe 6900-7000 support will break even if we do get there again, and there's little reason to think we are actually headed that way right now. 

Huge r/r for shorts was when 10k failed, and when we crashed through supports in 9ks and 8ks. Now? Eh. Too much risk of becoming a bottom shorter, I'd say. 
Shorts do cause sell pressure though, and they did so at the top of a trend near a resistance. The price of BTC nearly doubled so shorting there had good R/R. Right now we are 25% from our peak of our most recent trend, we are at a support line that held nicely and you want to short now? A short with good R/R would be after the line breaks, not before. As you said, the short *could* be huge now *if* the line breaks, but until then, shorting at support is never a good idea. And if the number of shorts goes up, and support *holds* then how is that not bullish?
I was about to say, you dodged a bullet. NEVER borrow money to make an investment like this unless you've got decades of trading experience. 
I give it another 5 years before you're in massive debt again.   Getting lucky once won't change of lifetime of poor financial decisions.

Tbh I have no idea. Still think we may break down the triangle. I'll see how it goes.
Tbh I never saw properly drawn ascending triangle in last month.

I can't draw proper p one now without violating chart, it's a wedge.
Hence why the Bart formation is a thing now
It's a chop. I said it should be traded like: 1-2% stop, 4-5% profit, nothing more.
Great point. I've noticed next to zero TA formations work out aside from falling wedges.

ahh yeah im fine
Just pointing out the supposed formation to him since he didn't see it.

Indeed, the only real wedges I see that play out like wedges in btc are generally found in multi-week time frames as the price travels end to end in macro formations.  For time frames and placement like this one today I do just treat it as support and resistance lines, and don't place any bets on assuming it should break down in this situation.
Rising wedges are also valid at the start of a run, they are labelled as leading diagonals instead of ending diagonals.

While they do tend to break down and retrace deeply. They are often the first move in a larger swing.

its a rising wedge, they can form at the bottom. 
Hey, thanks a lot! I really appreciate it!
That's plenty of movement to keep bots and scalpers happy. Beyond that I don't think the appetite is there in the wider world for anything more.

This is good for bitcoin.
Yea, this is a trading sub, not a gambling sub, that's why I can't stop laughing at the people who clearly don't understand the distinction and get themselves all worked up over where the price will be tomorrow (which is nearly completely random) when it's much easier to make the trades on a yearly timeframe if you're not a goldfish and have some patience and attention span. But I guess patience and attention span are not the specialties of millenials raised in the culture of participation trophies and instant gratification.
> it can't go up forever

I mean, if the supply continues to shrink via breakage, and that rate outstripes whatever decrease in demand there is... Yeah, it could go up forever. It simply depends on your assumptions. 
goldfish spotted
Yeah, and I think that might obfuscate it too much

[Here's the same time frame with typical scales](https://i.imgur.com/CzvEu0S.png)

I think there's some moderate value in comparing the slopes/rates of &#37; change over a period, but likely still needs other charts to complete the picture \(making this experiment largely useless\)
Sure, they weren't squeezed due to margin calls, but there were many more shorts than longs so they either closed to take profit from the former peak, or to prevent a loss, meanwhile the longs kept up.

Here, there are many more longs than shorts. So if shorts do close, there's (*possibly*) already less willingness to margin long further. Meanwhile, there's also less likelyhood of a squeeze.
sorry forgot reddit manners. I forgot to /s
Its funny because you were very bullish at the $9k mark

How likely do you think we'll revisit the top of the triangle? I feel like thats way too obvious of a play to actually pan out but maybe that's wrong thinking.
Im with ya on this one
Hey Chewy, does Bitcoinwisdom ever give you problems?  At random times it won't let me draw any lines on my chart, even if I refresh/restart my browser.  Wasn't sure if it's just me or something that happens with the site.
Your ROE is computed in BTC. Your USD profits are bounded by the position size if you short.

Who cares if your ROE is infinite, if BTC is worth 0

The main thing to keep in mind is that if you short, cant make more USD than the number of contracts you shorted. If you long, cant make more BTC than the position size at entry

ROEs are infinite when denominated in the losing currency either way (BTC loses if it goes to 0, USD loses if BTC moons)
It is correct.

If you buy X contracts at price p,

you basically bought X/p Bitcoins using your BTC as collateral.

You can never have BTC profits in excess of X/p Bitcoins. But the value of these X/p Bitcoins can continue to increase

Confirmed. Hit my stop @ 7617 when it went to 7625 on mex. Coffee break needed.
Scale out is always the best option in these cases imo. Hitting important resistance here. I would sell a bit.
Crypto is a tiny market, it can be moved by a few interested parties. So most of the movement is manipulated until it gets more liquid. But that does not mean it's unhealthy, it's just the way it is.
No worries. You shined a new light on it and I agree with what you’re saying.
I made the exact same trade on ETHUSD... entry at $554 with a target of $525.  I was absolutely sure we’d see that bear flag break down.

Closed it at $557, once ETH start creeping up but can’t forget this market loves to chop up gamblers.
Are you considering increasing your leverage here to add to your short?

Edit: changed long to short.  
>My automated systems didn't blink, API access was stable

With 100x, you've already decided that you want to be liquidated anyway, so it doesn't really make much difference if Bitmex is down or not.
Thanks! You can ask me for more facts any time. Beep boop.
It's not an opinion. It's more like ... a law.

Lets just keep it simple. I'll delete and rekt some bears.
The algoritm tries to keep the rate of bitcoins being mined constant. More monkeys mining will not make bitcoin production 'quicker', but would increase the difficulty.
They need a reality check is what they need. I posted that it's good to take profits the day of the ATH and those fools told me that it's stupid trying to time the market and they wouldn't mind holding thru a 70% correction like summer 2017 again.

Well, they got what they wanted. 
Yeah, right, all the shorters are bulls, even you :-P

no no no no calculus is a waste of time, trust me. im about to finish a dual degree in biochemistry and computer science. ive done up to calc 3 and beyond. its not worth it, you wont get too much out of it. if you want an actual valuable employable skill, learn programming and computer science. you dont even need a computer to learn programming, just textbooks and paper. you could find a great job making good money 50-100k+ after all that time in prison. you wont get anything out of learning calculus. 
Well you can get thrown in prison for selling $1 of BTC too...or having consensual sex where $100 is exchanged...or having a plant on you that you smoke.  But that's humanity for you.

What are you doing instead of a stable coin then? I was converting to eth, sending eth the Coinbase, converting eth to their cash wallet and then doing the process all over again to send back to the exchange once I was ready to buy back in and getting murdered in fees during the process. Tether, while shady, has worked great for me since then. But like they say, “It works until it doesn’t”
Just needs more time to mature so the liquidity can be there. We’ll see how I  goes. I’m optimistic though
Ah that's amazing, thank you my friend!!!!!!! Just a shame it's only available to Pro users of Trading View xD 
how did you accumulate so much wealth?
I understand what both of you are saying. Indeed, I've been out or hedged to 0 BTC for a few months, and it has been very freeing. Instead of coming here reading every word, watching numerous charts on multiple timescales; I come here after a few days absence and 11 hours of sleep and the comments look like Charlie Kelly with the red yarn.   


Yet if BTC surged to $40k randomly over the next couple months, and I only profited a few hundred bucks from it, I would be reconsidering WTF I was thinking being underexposed for so long. But I won't feel like a genius if bitcoin consolidates at 3k and I manage to reload large amounts, I'll just feel like a lucky chimp identifying some broad trends. 
That's great if losing 60% of your money means nothing to you.  I don't know that many people would not care about that, but more power to you with that attitude, and your fantasies, as well.
> I'm way, way up even on what I bought this year. 

how? It's like 25% above the lowest low of the year? It seems like you buy at any price point so I have a hard time believing you've only caught the very bottom every single buy
A glimpse of things to come....

So that push required global media mania, people buying en masse 

Considering the media is bored of crypto, people got badly burnt, you expect that not only to be recreated, but on a larger scale? Where exactly will this money come from?

Inb4 'institutional money' - there may be no real institutional money, if there is it might be tiny, their intentions might also be to crash it into oblivion 
No I love it for support and resistance levels, I'm saying it's pretty useless to go too far back when you're currently trading.   

*Unless* let's say you think the bottom will totally just fall out and you're looking for major support from long ago you can zoom out and find support levels at 2k etc.  Check out different youtube videos on it, but it's a great addiction to your indicators and I use it a lot. 
Nevertheless it is a convention and the point of a convention is that you don't have to know the origins or the backdrop to be using it.  Since mm is extensively used in marketing and finance as you pointed out we just accept it despite its ridiculousness. 


To be safe, using K for thousands and mm for millions is safest and most likely not to be misinterpreted. 


>  there's no real reason to believe 6900-7000 support will break even if we do get there again

well that would be a break below the symmetrical triangle. There's as much reason to believe a move below the triangle would have been a fakeout as there would to believe a move above the triangle woudl be a fakeout. (actually there's probably even less reason to believe a break below would be a fakeout since the downtrend was established before the triangle- meaning it'd be a continuation triangle)

longing $8.8-9.3k in anticipation of a large move up had a similar r/r profile as shorting $7300-7800 in anticipation of a large move down. 

Personally I believe the latter has a better r/r profile because of the triangle's inclination to break down vs up (apparently a 66-34% chance according to Peter brandt, the chart meme king) since it's it's a continuation pattern of the downtrend 

I get the worry about being a bottom shorter, so maybe the r/r isn't THE BEST PLAY EVER but it's not *crazy*. The reason the r/r is asymmetrical is that the risk is contained because there's a confluence of huge resistance right above us, whereas the reward for a drop below the triangle is potentially huge. 

While low $6k provides good support, high $6ks and low $7s isn't exactly strong support. So a move down would have shorts from $7.3k+ feeling pretty comfortable without having to worry about getting shafted by a dildo again since it's likely we will move below $6.8k relatively quickly if we do move down.

I'm personally not really sure why people think $6.8k is strong support, either 
I'm talking about before the *first* drop to $5.9k

https://www.tradingview.com/x/3ILe6fFH/

Notice how shorts increased on the way up before the drop and they anticipated it? 

As opposed to shorts increasing *all* the way down to $6.5k the second time, with more shorts piling on at the bottom. 

Whereas here we've seen a relatively natural sell pressure coupled with long liquidations pushing the price down from $10k as opposed to open interest from shorts moving it down
Wouldn't recommend it at all. It was reckless but I could see the potential and had no funds available. Certainly not advocating it but it is a good story with a happy ending. I told the bank the loan was for a car but then did end up buying a car when I cashed out so I was sort of telling the truth!
Thanks but I am well on my way to buying a house outright in my 20s and like to think I have learnt from my past. 
This is a valid warning honestly. I hope it does not happen to you but literally most people who win the lottery are broke within 10 years. 
Girls seem to like it. Especially on a sunny day with the roof down. I enjoy it anyway especially to be lucky enough to have that car in my 20s.
Yea lol cayman is much better 
I would generally agree if we were still not at what most from early 2017 would consider high prices.

New money has to be consistently entering and paying for $7k+ btc to prop prices up to offset mining

Going sideways essentially means we're just financing miners' operations, and since usage is down quite a bit I can't see that really happening lately for no reason
Oh idk yet it's probably a long story. He just commented earlier he got arrested once but got out of it and I was curious how and what for. Not sure he wants to say it publicly tho 
Both boxes are shipping in two weeks. 
Lol. I go with r/r, it's calculated gamble.

Ok, so 1 year. I trade almost 1 year. I could buy BTC for 3k when I entered, I'd be up 2.5x now just by holding, right? I'm up over 5x.
/subscribe
> where the price will be tomorrow (which is nearly completely random)

Don't trade.
Demand... Exactly. You need to find someone who will buy at higher price. At one point it's gonna be hard to find a buyer.
The supply is increasing. It is the speed of increase that shrink every 4 years.
Yes, I agree. I do believe the short squeeze propped the price up, just didn't realize it actually wasn't a "squeeze" from liquidations or margin calls. 
Whoops me too lol
My sentiment generally follows the direction of the market. 

At $9,000, the market was pushing toward the top of the triangle. All things being equal, I tend to assume the market will continue moving on it's current trajectory. Which at the time meant pushing through resistance and continuing to climb. 

Once the market bounced off of $10K and dropped below $8,600 my sentiment shifted and the logical direction was down to push through the bottom of the triangle instead. And that remains the logical outcome until such a time as the market makes a strong case for a reversal. 

This would require a sustained push above $8,000 or so.

As for the likelihood of revisiting the top of the channel, I'd be a bit surprised but it's far from out of the question. If the market heads back up there though, I'd expect it to break to the upside. A revisit of the top of the triangle that doesn't break out to the upside would be a bit of a head scratcher. 



I've never really had any problems with it. 
Happens to me sometimes.  I click off of the line tool and then back on it and that usually fixes it for me . 
Because I want all the monopoly money to myself! Anyway, I included an edit before you replied, though I forgot to mention that while the downside and upside are technically infinite, we are about as likely to see $1 mil bitcoin as $0 bitcoin.

I do see what you’re saying after running the numbers though. A 10x short of 1 btc from $10k to $1 would yield approximately 98,440 BTC for a total profit of only about $88,440. In comparison, a 10x long from $10k to say, $100k would yield approximately 2.4642 BTC for a total profit of about $236,420.

However, in practice, as long as one expects bitcoin to eventually go up, shorting bitcoin is much more profitable than longing it in the long term. Just compare the difference in BTC profits for the two situations. I think people tend to forget that long-term bulls can still short BTC in the short term to maximize their profits.
Say I buy 10k contracts on when BTC = 10k. My position in BTC is 1BTC.

If the price doubled to 20k, I would have 1btc profit. If the price then carried on increasing to 30k, I would still only have 1BTC profit?


Maybe I'm getting confused because Mex trades USD contracts and settles in BTC.
Ohh. 

For some reason I thought that if I were to use leverage to buy 10 BTC and the price went up 100% then that means I profit 10 BTC. Does that make sense? If I were to put 10 BTC into an altcoin and it went up 100%, I would profit 10 BTC
Lol
I read some good advice on twitter- set your limit orders where your stops would normally be. They'll probably get hit 
True. I’m still fairly new to this but I’ve been doing pretty well so far. I think greed is going to be my biggest challenge. I’ll scale a little out now and at 7550
While this would be the spot to do it, I don't really like to increase my leverage above 10x. 
>Couldnt you and a few people in this sub built one? I heard it is pretty good money.

Yep. I built and sold a spot exchange not too long ago. Now I'm old and tired, more interested in managing my fund and trading than running a futures platform.

Yes if it's constant. However if a million monkeys suddenly showed up and started mining with the abacus it would be found quicker relative to them not being there \(until the next difficult increase\).

you do know that if you transfer out from GDAX instead of Coinbase, there's no fee, right?  I don't know if this still applies with Coinbase Pro or not, but it at least eliminates fees from one exchange.
cash is a stable coin if you dont want or cant do tether. However, I prefer to hedge my holding rather then sell out most of the time. YMMV

Bitcoin... I’ve been buying with every paycheck since 2013. Except for the last 2 yrs when I had no income, I would’ve if I could and I still would now
if if if... backtrading is the easiest job in the world

A trader/speculator only need to care about the in and the out of a position, and should have the confidence that if the market shows him a new opportunity he can easily enter without any thinking of the past. It's like basketball, it doesn't matter how many shots you missed in the past only that you hit the next one.


I bought all three bottoms (6K, 6.6K, and 7.5K). I'm up about 20% this year as the biggest buy was in February. That's way up when compared to any traditional investment. 

Overall I'm up thousands of percent. Time is money.
>Nevertheless it is a convention and the point of a convention is that you don't have to know the origins or the backdrop to be using it.

I agree, though it still bothers me from both a scientific and aesthetic perspective.

Also, I often see confusion online regarding '$1mm', but I never see anyone confused over '$1M'. That's why I'll always use the latter... 1 mega\-dollar :\)

At the very least, one should use '$1MM' \(upper\-case\), though I still think that's silly and imprecise. Regardless, it's the way it is and me hating it will make no difference. However, if I ever see it used in a sentence with '*alot*' and 'halvening', I'll probably scream and quit the internet forever.
Don't get me wrong, I can totally understand anyone entering a short here. It's your wording I completely disagree with -- saying that r/r to short here is 'huge.' To go with your own example, I don't think anyone would have said a long at $9300 (after having moved up to $9800 and then bounced back down to $9300 to boot) was 'huge' r/r; likewise shorting here is a very speculative *maybe* and certainly neither safe nor a very 'good' entry. Like, it's shorting before a breakdown of support is confirmed but after a significant move down has already happened. It's pretty much FOMO at this point, really. 
Okay. That is a bit weird. I think I'm starting to remember that, too. There was some massive whale who shorted 1k coins at 10.5k and the price went all the way up to mid 11's before dropping and everyone was expecting the whale to get liquidated. But, overall, that would be an exception rather than the rule. I think it is generally accepted that, no matter the asset, when a price is able to hold a certain price and shorts go up that is bullish. I don't see how that is any different this time. 
Congratulations! I guess the universe decided you deserved a big break :)
what kind of bank makes a car loan but doesn't require to be listed as a lienholder on the title?
Yea buying a luxury car which is outrageously expensive to maintain once the warranty expires really hammers home how you've learned your lesson.
Statistically winners of the lottery are more likely to file bankruptcy than the general population.  
Nice to hear you’ve made such a great profit. 
My only advice is dump the z4 as soon as the warranty expires. It will turn into a BMtroubleyou
Looked at Porsche but the z4 35is had 18k miles and is just as quick. 350 horsepower is good enough for me.
Cayman is a pretty feminin car, it was actually designed by a women. 
We get inklings of OTC's vastness every now and then. I wouldn't really look to exchanges any more for an impression of the true action. They were everything pre 2013/14. Now not so much. 

The people with the real money are the ones with real vision and patience. 

And at the start of 2013 it was $10. At the depths of 2015's awfulness it was $160. Things reach another plateau. The scene gets used to them as the new normal. 

Even if things get boring as fuck, there's still an army more people than before. 
Oh, that doesn't mean he went upstate or anything. Prison is for long term felony sentences. County jail is where most cryptonauts are likely to end up if they get arrested at all. Most likely he was cited and fined for playing dungeon and dragons on a public sidewalk or something. Doubt it was as serious as pot or jaywalking.

Lookup what breakage is. The issuance schedule of BTC has nothing to do with total supply. Breakage does. 
3 days of green bulls run free, 3 days of red bulls are dead. 3 days in a row in one direction that bounced off at the top or bottom of a triangle tends to indicate the trend reversed. At least within this pennant.
Yeah, I tried clicking everything, nothing seemed to help. Maybe it's a chrome issue, switched to Firefox and it hasn't done it today
yes, correct! Your upside in BTC from shorting is greater than your upside in BTC from longing due to the non-linear nature of the contract!


If you buy 10k contracts at 10k, your position size is 1BTC.

Let’s say you’re doing this at 10x leverage.

You pay margin 0.1 BTC and have a total position size of 1BTC, so 9000 dollars worth of your position is on leverage, 0.9 BTC. You will need to oay back these 9000 dollars at some point in the future! If the price goes down to 9k, then they sell the 9000 contracts at 9k for a total of 8100 usd and your 0.1 BTC (now worth 900 usd) brongs the whole thign back to 9k and their book is balanced. You have been liquidated.

On the contrary, assume the price of BTC goes to 20k

You have a position of 10k contracts @10k entry, so you have the ability to sell your 10k contracts @ 10k for 20k contracts @20k

You need to pay back the 9k contracts you bought @10k (your margin was the remaining 1k contracts, i.e. 0.1 BTC), so that will cost you 0.45 BTC

You hve made. total of 0.55 BTC out of your initial 0.1 BTC margin. 450% ROE

If BTC were to go higher, you would need to sell less of your 1BTC position to repay the 9k in margin, so your ROE tends towards 1000%
If you open a 10BTC long, you have to pay back the fiat you borrowed to buy the difference between position size and your margin.

At 10x you pay 1BTC to obtain a 10 BTC position.

If the price of BTC doubles, your positon is now worth twice the fiat. Subtract the 1BTC and you have 9 BTC you bought at half the fiat price, so you have to give back half the BTC, i.e. 4.5 BTC to py back your creditors (who gave you the equivalent of 4.5 BTc in USD at current market price to buy 9 BTC when you opened the position.

You keep 4.5 BTC and you already have 1 BTC. So 5.5 BTC total

Profit is 450% of your initial margin
That would have worked wonders so far. Thanks, I'll try that out. I still believe we are going down, but we might visit 78xx first. What is your take on it?
I read Flood's Twitter too, good stuff, that was a good tip. https://twitter.com/ThinkingUSD/status/1001328699587813376?s=19
If you're scaling out after a 3% move up I'd say greed isn't going to be a problem - and it might even be an issue that you're not greedy *enough*, although you can never lose money by taking profits
Well done Mike. Enjoy!

This is some of the best, most understanding and personal moderating I've ever seen. Bravo, good sir/miss. 
Yes
This chop is just because a lot of people don't know, so they take small profits.

FOMO ATH had a lot of buys, a lot of people didn't know how to margin trade. Look at Mex now, bigger part knows now how to short. They take profits as soon as they can.
Don't count on it...humanity is not evolving much and society is evolving and a glacial pace...and devolving in some cases and areas, as we currently see in the USA.
Off to /r/tallguysmarkets 
No I do, I’m referring to the fees that Coinbase chargers when you sell into cash/buy back into crypto. 
That's fair, I guess it isn't *huge* per se in terms of downside to upside. The *reward* is potentially pretty large, and the risk is relatively contained, so to me I see it as strong r/r.

Upside: Anywhere from $1.5-$3k of downwards movements, more if you're patient and want to hodl a short through any bounces if you believe we're moving down further

Downside: $300-700 of upwards movement.

so the r/r would be like a factor of 5, which is pretty big imo. 

A long here really has about the same r/r since a move up would be met with triangle resistance at about $9k by the time we get there. although if you factor in a breakout upwards (and a move to new ATHs) the reward gets exorbitantly large - but that's always the case with longs (which is why in general this market is bullish, rightfully so)

So I disagree that it's FOMO, although yes, it is probably just a bit later to the train than most people would like to be, ideally. 

I'm  big believer in the law of attraction and interestingly I had been doing some wealth affirmations the months prior to this......
So do you know what it takes to trade and hold btc without selling while it goes up 10 times in value? It was stressful and I cashed out over a quarter of a mil and I can't reward myself. Funny how the salty comments come from those with new reddit account who presumably bought at the top. Damn you probably bought my 17k coins. What's the point in trading if you can't treat yourself and enjoy life?
That was my point.
Haha will keep that in mind. It's actually a rare car and no longer made and only done 18k miles. Will only have for a couple of years as not practical with kids etc when they come along
Lmao cayman? It's a mid engined Porsche , you don't know shit about cars I guess 
sigh.  You're probably the kind of person who thinks that an MX-5 is a chick car too.
He said 25+ years and 400k in fines tho lol don’t know how he got out of it.

Lol ya I know, I meant to ask why he was arrested, cause he got out of going to prison 
If someone really thinks the price 24 hrs from now is always "nearly completely random", then they are clueless about technical analysis and should not be trading.
I'm an idiot. I see where I had a brain-fart now. Thanks.
Basically agree with you. A move above $7600 would definitely give me pause but I wouldn't suddenly think we're going anywhere super high. $7850+ and I'd get nervous shorting this but I'd probably only be convinced of a large move up at $8200+
Ya I forgot his name, I think I saw aabtc tweet that. I don't think it's even isolated to bulls- it's a pretty good tip both ways. It's a good way to think about where to close positions as well, not just stops
In the current market environment I'd heavily disagree with this statement. 
I’ll take that into consideration. I’ve been a long time lurker here but I’m just starting to trade. I feel as if it’s like a video game though. in the sense that I’m get exponentially better and better with experience (especially in this volatile fast paced market)

Thanks :) still trying to find a personal voice with it, and I'm learning to switch voices still, but I've been getting a lot of good feedback that has helped a lot.
Sort of, I think mex is full of idiots so idk if I would say the market is smarter for it lol 
So... you're saying we should short human futures?
but if you are aware of GDAX and its fees, why aren't you just using that?
250k is a nice chunk of cash but it's not buy a BMW and go crazy money.  You'd have benefited far more if you put that money into investments and retired substantially earlier than most other people.  But instead you bought a car.  Because you're hood rich and you'd rather flaunt your mediocre winnings than smartly allocate the funds and prepare for your future.  Hopefully the next 7-8 years you spend driving your rapidly depreciating car will be worth retiring 7-8 years later. 
Enjoy it and take it from me for having just a ordinary x5. Man, the moment it has issues the costs take away the joy. Parts ain’t cheap.
Basically just saying having a nice car is awesome, but it shouldn’t burn your money ;).

No worries homie. Hope this helped. I also added it for others who may not get it
Ya, works either way and I have been trying to be patient and use that, not easy.
I'm not suggesting that he not take profits *here,* I'm saying that if he is comfortable scaling out after a 3% move greed shouldn't be an issue, and in some cases, his lack of greed later on may be the issue. 

I personally go for the big moves, if I catch a local bottom or a top at strong support/resistance I generally try to hold it out until breakeven. So in his case holding his long open is an appropriate amount of greed in terms of the r/r considering the potential for a recovery (although I personally do not believe that will happen) 
Keep your ego in check, that's how you avoid getting rekt. Thinking you can catch every swing is what'll ruin ya. As long as you're patient and have a plan you'll do fine.

I didn't say smarter, I did say a lot of them started to trade both ways.
There is still 6 figures sitting in crypto and plenty in investments. I will be mortgage free in my early 30s. It's hard to give financial advice without all the facts but I guess it's just your personality type which is fine. As you can imagine the past 12 months have been great. I'm sure you would have advised against going all in at 1k but I did it and I get to decide what to do with it. You didn't so you can only type on reddit about it.
I think you're over exaggerating a bit, it's not like he bought a Ferrari
It will be gone before it's done 30k miles for something more sensible. Right now I'm just enjoying life and increasing my stack ready for the next bull run to 50k btc ;-)
Fair enough. I go for the smaller ones and they add up on each other and pretty much equal or surpass the the bigger moves at time. 

Yes not being greedy enough can be just as catastrophic but for now that's nothing to worry about.
I figured that out very quickly just getting into crypto alone right before the big bull run. It’s taught me to be very level headed and think things through before acting. I’m mostly comparing it to a video game bc honestly it’s kinda fun haha

Awesome, what are your thoughts and analysis for June? 
I get somewhat emotional when I enter/exit the market so I try to avoid it as much as possible. It's worked out for me so far, I shorted $9.6k and just held until here lol

I don't know if I could've caught ~25-30% of movement with scalps on the way down because I am not very good at the shorter term trades, plus it's more stressful imo
yes it is! a video game with money. That requires your attention 24/7

And koreans are obsessed with it...
I'm bullish on btc but not intending to sell anymore until the 2020 halving. I like to think we are at the bottom around 7k but I do believe the next bull run will take us to 50k. Just may take some time. I don't trade btc with all these barts etc but have an interest in alts such as bnb,wtc,xlm all to perform well over the summer.
> I get somewhat emotional when I enter/exit the market

Here we're the same. I guess that is part of all traders though. Lucky me has pretty dim emotions most of the time though.

> I am not very good at the shorter term trades, plus it's more stressful imo

Here we are different. I kinda admire you for being able to hold through the Good, Bad and Ugly. I really don't know how you guys do it. I try to optimize as much as possible and have a really good win rate in the short-term (about 80-85%). This goes down to 45% when I am trying to trade medium term. "Hit and run" is the name of the game for me. 

Also you always seem to get the tops. GJ on that. 


I can see why lol I’ve always wanted to get payed to play video games and I guess this is better than trying to find matches of h3 in MCC I guess:P
Dang, that's a pretty damn good win rate. Congrats on that. I'd say if you're good at it keep it up. 

And thanks btw. I do attribute a bit of it to luck but most of it is just sheer stubbornness. I shorted a bit on the way up and got screwed on it and just closed it at a loss. So part of it is that I just generally keep trying to short until I get the top and then the large move down ends up making for the losses. Although I *did* finally long $8800 to $9650 and turned it into a short. So I guess I did sort of get the top

So far it's been profitable since we've just been ranging and any top short + bottom long has seen nice returns.

I suppose in a bull run I will have to change that mindset
> Dang, that's a pretty damn good win rate.

Thanks. It has to be though since I am doing this for a living since 2016 (if you count stocks and rarely forex). Also doing university on the side (sometimes I wonder why cuz of dez mad gainzz) and I hate not being able to look up the price when I want to. What I hate even more is setting stops.

> been ranging and any top short + bottom long has seen nice returns

Had to chuckle a little. I think you mean that these tops and bottoms occur a lot more lately ya? This will probably change when the symmetrical triangle is resolved. I can see us ranging for a maximum of two weeks. It's getting very tight.

> I suppose in a bull run I will have to change that mindset

In most of BTC's bull runs you literally don't have to think. And I think you're doing a pretty fine job. When we start breaking the pattern of lower high I guess you could long and forget for a month.


How old are you? Just curious. Immediately assumed you were older since you trade stocks/forex but then you said uni lmao. grad student or undergrad? I'd be amazed if you're a grad student and are trading crypto

and yes, that's exactly what I mean! There may not be so many obvious bottoms and tops with large, almost straight line moves up/down in the future. I believe we're making a large move here pretty soon as well. 

And yes, that's pretty much what I plan on doing. The nice thing about all this is that I've learned much, much more from this than I did from the move from $8k-20k lol
I really value my privacy and I don't want to share too much,but I am in my very early 20s. I just looked up undergrad and grad. Sry here in Europe we've got bachelor and master. I think I am undergrad. I am going to complete my bachelor in about 2 years. Following BTC since the early days though cause I got into weed pretty early on lmao. Back then I was sadly too young to realize why it could potentially be game-changing.

I always had an interest in trading. Played a lot of ressource managing games back then and also flipped stuff on ebay. As soon as I was old enough I rushed to trade stocks. I only dabbled in forex. My analysis for today is to short the euro @1.172 with 1.168 target though lol.

Yes I was pretty fascinated with this whole experience, since it was the first bubble I witnessed in its entirety. I sold my whole stack including cold storage from ~2015 or 16 @11.5k though because I thought that was pure madness coming from stocks.  Definitely was a great learning experience. I never seen bulls that are this retarded in my life. Not even TSLA.

What I also learned was that I was actually a decent trader. I did okay in stocks and really well in BTC and alts. I attributed that to me just exploiting a bubble and nothing else. This showed in my trading when I lost around 10k in february because I got chopped up like crazy. Since then I did well though and gained quiet a bit of confidence. 

"During a bull market everyone is a genius" definitely seems correct. This causes heavy doubt during a bear market in your own abilities.
