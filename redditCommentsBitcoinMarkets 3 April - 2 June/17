[Daily Discussion] Thursday, May 17, 2018 -- TITLE
#New post: [\[Daily Discussion\] Friday, May 18, 2018 →](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8kae50/daily_discussion_friday_may_18_2018/)
I'm currently out of the market. I had opened long last night small along with /u/_chewtoy_, but had a bad feeling before going to bed so I closed it for tuna sub profits. I've mentioned it a few times, but the absolutely insane stop hunting/wicks we've been seeing the last 24 hours (especially on mex) make trading this with margin over 3x insane. To be safe, you really need your stops around 3% away.

On BitMEX, the wicks are always bad, but we're starting to see what I can only assume are legitimate stop hunts of MEX caliber occurring on BFX too. This just exacerbates the problem on MEX.

Between Sunday and Tuesday, I had three monster trades that increased my overall stack by 44%. I had three positions stopped out yesterday that reduced those winnings by half, despite having relatively deep stops significantly over proven resistance. In all three cases, the price returned to its previous level in under 2 minutes, and in many cases moved further into profits. Being up 22% since Sunday is still a very good feeling, but I'm thinking I'm going to either sit on the sidelines or drop to 3x/swing trade territory. 

The entire premise behind successful margin trading is to cut losers quickly, cut weak winners quickly, and let strong positions run. When the market will oscillate 2% in under 90 seconds a half dozen times in a day, that makes that strategy extremely difficult to execute.

Macro: https://www.tradingview.com/x/pCoVcliz/  
Micro: https://www.tradingview.com/x/6Vvrz0qg/  

We're narrowing in a number of patterns. I'm not looking to take a position anywhere in this cluster. Plus apparently MEX is/was down (RIP hammy the hamster) anyway. I had some scaling long orders in (up to 10% of the account) from 8200-7800, and I'm not concerned if those execute. That's been a plan for a while. 

Good luck everyone. These market movements feel more intentionally malicious these days. 
Either there's a big green candle coming or Mex traders have lost their damn minds.

June premium is up to around $80.

I'm inclined to believe the latter. 
I’m long at 7980, stop loss at 7690. Don’t want to be the person waiting for 7800 but it never comes. Could be too early for this but I think the r/r is worth it. 

Edit: getting rid of the stop loss for now. I’ll DCA this if we go lower. My position isn’t to big currently
I think it’s safe to say no one has a single clue what BTC is truly going to do.

It’s been a week since our decline from the 9000’s range, and we have still managed to float in no mans land for 7+ days without breaking down through 8k
I'm ready for this thing to happen again. Long from 8050 GDAX. Descending wedge / Bullish divergence on the 4hr. RSI / Similar price action from March 8 - 18th.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/bpKpa3JV/
Closed my long at around $8,345. 

Edit: buying pressure evaporated almost immediately after I opened the position. 
Now instead of watching the price move, I watch the[ % uptime](https://status.bitmex.com) decrease.

A number is a number, any number will do, just give me a hit.
I’m bullish but I’m pretty drawn to the overlapping supports at  ~7.2k. The downtrend from 20k(getting lower by the day), uptrend line from 6.4k, .236 fib support of the move from 6k to 10k and horizontal support, I would love to make a long there. But then again anything under  8.2 has been bought up ferociously. 

On the flip side of it, if you pull up the volume profiles of the 7ks it’s almost non-existent, we’ve blasted through that area going up and down, if bulls give up this support it doesn’t seem far fetch bears could build momentum and lower lows are right around the corner. 

I don’t think this post really has a point or so what but just sharing some thoughts 

Mimics the 9.4k drop perfectly so far. I dont believe in fractals but this is just too bizarre.

On top of it, it happened almost at the **exact** same time 

Edit: *Fun Fact* 

 Last Weeks Drop happened last **Thursday** at around **2:15 EST** time 

This Weeks Drop: This **Thursday**  at around **2:40 EST** Time 

30 minutes apart, exactly 1 week from each other. Fucking crazy 
well at least now we know the price is run by skynet
Just remember, sooner or later this ends with a BGD.
The current price action on bitfinex looks pretty funny on the 3 min chart.
Bought some real btc at 8200 today again since my sell at 9100 last week. Putting some orders at 8100 too, margin is not worth it currently but to buy btc in the middle of yearly low and last move up sounds good. I need them for some master node stuff so now is the time

The feeling of buying and not trading is so less stressful :D
Based on the 2D Ichi, which BTC has been respecting quite well, I think we're finally going to see price flatten out; something necessary if we're ever going to see another bull market (we will).

https://www.tradingview.com/x/r2dZgf4P/

Price is at the bottom of the 2D kumo and the kijun has been flat for ~2 weeks now. We are headed to a happy place of equilibrium with greener pastures ahead. If I had to guess the range for the next 2 months (!), I'd say 7700 - 8450.
Forgot I got a buy order at 8250. Guess I'm long now on accident lol
Just to share a personal thought, and i thought this story might be interesting as compared to the sleepy markets at the moment. 

I believe that a large number of outsiders think the crypto space is a joke for a good reason: it is a joke. For every good actor out there who is legitimately interested in advancing the tech in this space, there are a hundred bad people who are only vested in siphoning money from this space for their own financial benefit. 

As an example, I have a friend in the startup industry. Late last year, he had absolute zero knowledge about Bitcoin or the blockchain, and was fomoing into altcoins at the top. 

Today, I found out that the same friend is using his startup company to launch a blockchain project for some cross-border payments (as though we don't already have a million of those) and an ico, backed by a reputable venture capitalist who used to work at Sequoia Capital (no doubt who will benefit from the token allocation). That friend has also been invited to speak at some Asia payments summit on the topic of Bitcoin prices, ICOs, and the future of blockchain tech.

What will happen next, you wonder. The ico will probably be funded, whether legitimately or illegitimately. He will then get that coin listed and traded against Bitcoin on some prominent exchange, pay the listing fee, and start the pump and dump shenanigans. For every bitcoin that he makes from such a venture, you can be sure that it will end up on the open market for sale. 

My belief is that so long as these bad actors/projects are allowed to exist or propagate, and without regulation, it will be very difficult to see another price boom for Bitcoin. 
Like I said, 8200-8900. Boring. 
[deleted]
Is Bitmex down for anybody else?
From a consolidation point of view, we have mean-reverted to the yearly daily vwma. Our volume & volatility has mean-reverted and tightened too. And we're sitting on the volume Point of Control. All signs lead to a major swing about to start.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/9ZKxZEIL/

!long XBTUSD 8260 5X 25%

Hit support on the ascending traingle. I'll see how this plays out.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/2iH9t8VD/

edit: I set stops wide to avoid getting wicked on an uncommitted move. For now, I'm content with where we're holding, but it is starting to feel like it could be that 10 foot drop before the 100 foot cliff. I may set stops closer to the 1% range
!short XBTUSD close 8251

Not sure if this will go down more and i'm partying tonight so can't baby sit the position. Time to put some alarm to drunkenly open positions when this moves.
Be very careful placing Bitmex orders right now. A couple orders I hit submit on over 5 minutes ago are hitting the books now. If you are used to spamming to open an order, don't do that right now.
BitMEX going down is going to make for an interesting next hour. Could be the uncertainty the market needs to get below 8k. Or maybe the reverse and a bull whale makes a move now. Never a dull moment. 
Human traders wanted!! Uncle Bitcoin needs you!!
All right Bitmex. Now what?
all in long @ 7950
I think we are being trained to take profits early, which will decrease volatility in the market. Leveraged positions are getting chopped up. Not saying its orchestrated but it sucks.
Bitmex: Trading Suspension  

Trading will suspend to fix a hardware issue. We expect to resume within 30 minutes.
That's sad:

Liquidated long on XBTUSD: Sell 9,083,019 @ 8076.5

Yes, we broke down out of my descending wedge. But fear not, because we are in a much larger, more glorious descending wedge that I had not accounted for!

https://www.tradingview.com/x/6HCDARtD/
Shorting the triangle breakdown at around $8,230 on spot. 

Edit: I'll flip a table if it reverses back above $8,500, but I see no reason why that should happen here.

Edit: based on the simply massive amount of buying pressure we've seen over the past few days, you will VERY VERY likely get another chance to short back up toward the former channel support in the next few minutes or hours. I'd take it as an opportunity to short if you missed the boat on the drop.

EDIT: I had to mash the market-sell in order to get in on the drop. So I'm short from June futures at around $8,280.

EDIT: Hopefully this is the confirmation of support-turned-resistance I was watching for: https://imgur.com/a/KWtLkp5
All in at 7960, I FOMOed
Could anyone explain me why many people in this sub are speaking about strong support at 8,200 and that we can't break down this? Why do they think this support is stronger than resistances at 8,400 8,500 8,600?Is that because we touched 8,200 two times and almost precisely at the same level?
It seems the ridiculous wicks have continued overnight, except the most recent ones are downward. How did finex drop under 8200 twice just to carry on its merry way up at 8300?

Glad I'm out of this mess for the moment. It feels like there's some merit to setting a buy 1.5% below us or a sell 1.5% above us and just go wick fishing. 
Alright Bitcoin, do your thing already and get this over with!
Mr. Crypto...I don't feel so good.
Let the games begin.
Closed my short at around $8,000 on Mex. About $8,000 on spot as well. (I originally thought spot was above Mex, and cited $8,050 as my exit on spot, but in reality they were near parity).

EDIT: More because I wanted to get the fuck out of there until things calm down than anything. 
Just added to my short at 8060. CA now at 8260 with stops in minor profit. Let's see if the market is serious about holding 8K.
Been a while since I posted here, but I'm getting a signal that hasn't failed me in the past. Clear bullish divergence spotted on the 4h timeframe. Too late to post an image. Just google divergences if you don't know what they are.

In any case, if 7.9-8k holds, I call bottom for a while.


If this ascending triangle holds, that would be huge. Staying above that support will be critical for breaking 10k within the coming weeks. If this bad boy breaks, ALTS will be going on a firesale. 


Happy hunting


Edit: switched back flair to short-term (5-10 day) bearish. 
And Bitmex is having API problems again. 

Should be quite the shitshow if there's a big move sooner rather than later.
Descending triangle = continuation pattern: https://www.tradingview.com/x/A0fsEkVA/ 

Imagine longing 8210 on bitmexico and seeing the price drop, best they could do is return orders made prior to this downtime. Probably not going to happen. 
I feel bad for folks with locked positions on bitmex.  
still no volume even on dumps 
buying in at 7888, that is my lucky number I hope
Short from 8160 and just opened up a hedge long on June futures at 7985 spot. Not sure if that was the best idea, and not sure why I seem to be hedging my positions all of a sudden, but let's see how it goes.
Max red days in a row without some green in there somewhere since 20k top: 6

Average is probably 3-4.

We're going on 5 🤔
This feels way to god damn similar to the 9.2-9.4k range last week. 

Slow creep up’s from an “established “ 9200 support after being tested many times. Bounced of 9200 and was tested a handful of times only to make a slow creep up to test the upper ranges of 9.4k which we couldn’t break through. Ascending triangle that should have broke up, but broke down. 

It was the situation “ Break 9.2k and go to shit or break 9.4k and hello the moon “ Bbands were also tight as a a twat like they are right now. 

Established “ 8200 support “ with a break of 8400 to moon or a break below 8200 to the sewers. Slow creep up and dying volume similar to last week. Ascending triangle once again and we are recovering from another dump as well. 

We are also exactly a week apart when the dump happened, if it dumps tonight it would essentially be exactly 1 week give or take a few hours.

If it repeats again, 8k for a small bounce then 7.8k established as temp support only to be blown through to reach 7.2k for a major bounce.

Anyone else with me on this boat? I’m also long 

Edit: Closed my long for 5$ Loss lol, scaling into a short from 9.3-9.4k because I think this is going to play out like last week 
Closed my long for a 50% loss on my trading stack. Fucking hurts.
I will go down with this ship

And I will throw my hands up and surrender

There will be no bounce up on BitMex

I’m amazed... and always will be
All in at 8k, might be a mistake but you lot are super bearish.

Expecting a nice bounce at 7800 if it gets there and if it goes to 6500 we should be back here soon enough.
So I was looking through my old trading notes, which are fairly sparse compared to recently (though more meaningful and less noisy).  I found 2 gems. (actually these are the *only* 2 notes about the BTC in my 2017 notes until February 2018, the rest are about alts... yeah...)

1. November 28th 2017: "BTC drop will be to 5.5k"  (this is when the growth was becoming crazy, so 5.5k was based on a fairly consistent high before total insanity.  November 28th is after spending November 16~25 in a fairly well bound horizontal range, and noting that the previous flattish range before that was 5.5k ish in October 12~28th)  I thought it was gonna drop a lot sooner though and it just never went back down and went into the rear view mirror.

2. January 17th 2018: "Buy in 6500 ~ 8500" (again, this was based on looking back to the November 16~25 range for a ceiling)

It appears that after we passed 8500 I thought that the growth was getting unsustainable, but before that I was comfortable, and that it was the roof of sanity.

At that time, I also almost only considered horizontal lines in terms of support/resistance.  I didn't integrate diagonal resistance/support into my decisions until after the downward log trend line materialized.

I bring this up now as we are basically in the range which was apparently very important to me in the past.  (people have been asking what is so special about this spot)
##**Vote on both polls please.**

$7899 or $8601 first? 

https://www.strawpoll.me/15717691

$5999 or $10001 first?

https://www.strawpoll.me/15717650

Assume spot price on bitfinex. 

Sorry for spamming the sub with these, but I am super curious now to see what sentiment is like. 

I'd offer commentary on price action but I'd rather see what people are thinking with no commentary attached. 

For what it's worth, the last poll yesterday ended at pretty much exactly 1:1 for estimates on which price we hit first, $7800 or $8600. 

I'll edit in old polls in a bit.
5/17/18 UPDATE. Per my last update on [5/14/18]( https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8j9i8m/daily_discussion_monday_may_14_2018/dyy0sl9/), I predicted we were in a descending wedge, which seems to be loosely playing out with a slight drop off in volume. While we’ve been in a downward movement for the past 11 days, there is significant bullish divergence on the RSI since 5/12.

I’ve done some clean up on my chart, greying out many older lines of support/resistance/etc. The two thick blue lines are support, the darker of the two being the long-time log support since 2017. The four green arrows are where we could go between now and 5/31. Here are the updated charts…

Here’s the [macro view](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZFnV116X/).     
Here’s the [descending wedge and four scenarios](https://www.tradingview.com/x/bfaiTZJs/).     
Here’s the [super zoomed in view](https://www.tradingview.com/x/YobZlDeK/).     

**Uber Bull Case:** This assumes we decisively break through the black resistance line with sustained upward movement. Despite the low amount of shorts, I believe this could be a mini-BGD as those tend to appear when we have built up some sideways momentum and are encountering a resistance line for the 3rd, 4th, 5th time. This gives us a price target of $9,900 by 5/31.     
*Probability of Occurring: 35%*     

**Bull Case:** This assumes we break through the resistance line but don’t have a significant pop to get there. This gives us a price target of $8,950 by 5/31.     
*Probability of Occurring: 15%*     

**Sideways Case:** This assumes we bottom out around $8,000 and stay more or less range bound around that number for the next two weeks or so. This would actually be a healthy sign for the market as it shows accumulation occurring at that level. This gives us a price target of $8,000 for 5/31.     
*Probability of Occurring: 30%*     

**Bear Case:** This assumes we fall out of the descending wedge, breaching the black support line, and sets us up into a direct confrontation with the log support from 2017. This gives us a price target of $7,050 for 5/31.     
*Probability of Occurring: 20%*     
Hey, quick question, where do you guys look at big buy/sell walls on the market? Is there a specific site or do i have to go to the exchanges themselves and find it in the *depth*
I feel like, yet again, this area just continues to be stubborn as hell. It's where the entire bulltard run started (sideways from $7950 to $8350 for 5 days then boom) and now it feels like every time we come here that it's either about to start again or it's about to end. It's incredible how magnetic this range is 

edit: it's also interesting that no one here is even reacting to a 1.5k market sell
No surprise this ascending triangle broke downwards rather than upwards. I guess patterns in larger time frames are more reliable..

I would be surprised if bulls manage to push it back into the ascending triangle. More than 1.5k BTC were thrown
Log support query where opening myself to look plenty stupid.

Lot of talk about a monster symmetrical triangle forming from the ATH and from way back when looking at a log chart \(20th March 2017\). [Unless we have a massively narrow range of movement for a whole week, next week is when a direction has to be picked to move out of this space](https://imgur.com/a/9AnqaTv) next week.

So my query is this:

How much attention is paid to seemingly 'critical' moments like this? Additionally, I'd guess this is generally only useful as a retrospective analysis, as it merely insinuates a movement up or down to break the trend \(with no indication as to which\). Would that be correct?
I give up trading this range, !short close 8300 . Staying out until either 8k falls or we break up. This is too annoying.
Ok. This game is for big bois. I am stepping aside. Will be shorting anything above 8500 level and longing anything below 8k.
Ok. Im finally taking a position. Scaling long between 8.2 and 8.3. Stops scaling in from just below 8.1 to 8.05, to (hopefully) prevent being stopped out on a crazy wick.

I still have fiat on the sidelines, so this is kind of a hedge-long. I'll be happy with a move in either direction, as long as it's a nice clear move and not just more giant wicks.

Edit: I'm going to babysit the crap out of my stops.
As I have said before I am only trading 4hr and up at this point due to what seems like confusing algo price action.

In a profitable short still and setting SL at break-even because we could always get the Biggity Giggity at any moment!

 peace
For everyone scurrying in to short the breakdown, what's your real target here?

I've got a half-assed rising support line that I may not entirely believe myself at around 8095, and the falling wedge support below that at around 8050.  Just curious what everyone's plan is who's shorting here.
Bitmex is ded. 
Glad i left bitmex. Left due to overloaded problem. Went bald pulling my hair out.
Bitmex reopens:

- Scenario 1: High level of longs closing up driving the price even lower, not to mention possible liquidations

- Scenario 2: Traders buying the dip.

I'm more incline to believe Scenario 1... We'll see
Bitmex: 13 seconds ago

So about that descending triangle.....

Descending triangle = continuation pattern: https://www.tradingview.com/x/A0fsEkVA/

Sorry for repost. 

Currently holding my short until break-even or a clear reversal (which would have to take place in the low-mid 7000s to be clear)
Damn, not feeling so confident about my $8,300 long \(5x 100&#37; of trading stack\). Liquidation price is around $6,900 so I have plenty of breathing room. Also the position is with June futures so I won't get railed with fees for waiting it out. Still sucks :/
Could this be a self fulfill prophecy? Oh yeah we gonna see 7800, say it X times, and then we move towards that price?
ELI5 - why does resistance hit perfectly on even numbers like this - i.e. $9200, or $8000. 

Is this entirely because limits are usually set at easily manageable numbers? But 8200, 7800 seem odd? Is there more to this?
Overall, I would feel much better in a long trade in general when daily MACD bottoms out (the peak at which selling pressure abates in that time frame) -- without this, I am skeptical of anything confirming to the upside due to latent sell pressure, as though the price bias/gravity is still pulling price down (would explain all the wicking on volume breakouts last 12 hours).  This indicator has proven itself time and time again, we're about a week out from this happening, which is around the time the weekly MACD should be crossing over too.  I think we jumped the gun by a week on the current (unconfirmed) bullish formations.

Closed my short at 8062. 

My girlfriend is over and I want to enjoy sex. Don’t want to  have a flaccid penis while I’m dogging from behind because  I cant stop thinking about if Bitcoin is fucking me 
Going long now, big time bear but we had 4 straight red days and we seem to be inside a descending wedge. Expecting a good bounce and then ill go short again.

We could potentially go bear 8k before bouncing but if anything I'll just add more yo my long around there.

Good luck 
Hey Guys. 

There is a 3-4 week OBV tend line (ETH)  that has broken today. When BTC's similar line was breached we experienced a 12% drop. I believe ETH's could provide a similar hit.  Which will likely effect the whole space.

Chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/EAGImlRv/
I feel for anyone on the wrong side of this. 




The last drop was due to longs closing.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/61JtDGGI/

Also interesting ETH has just about completed its end of the ladder. 

If you look at the situation using triangles, it looks like a mess. In the ladder form, it makes perfect sense. Maybe I'm crazy, but I can see exactly where the barts go after we get a leg down, because they snap to them like a grid. The cascading sells often overshoot for a bit, but it corrects. It feels almost mechanical.
I'm probably cursing my trade just by saying it but as much as I'm tempted to go long I really think someone or a group of traders are going to YOLO this down to 8k.

There's always going to be more people looking to be long (anyone buying via coinbase for one) and with it getting several clawbacks from around 8400 and with this sub flipping bull I'm holding my bear flair. Albeit under duress.

I'd expect another attempt at 10k in the next few weeks and I'm long term bullish.
'I don't care whether the NASDAQ adopts crypto.

The next NASDAQ will be built on a crypto protocol.' -Fred Wilson USV
Bounces are weak..unless BGD..I'm waiting it out
I think I’ll just go wick fishing at night - reel that bitCat in and sell the upside of the chop the next day. 
I'm not sure if we've actually reversed just yet, though the fact that we didn't roll over all of yesterday is promising. that being said, the quick rejections of all upward moves are,.... odd in a way. It's almost someone got really sick and tired of all the barting around is actively trying to keep price stable. 

I'm looking at two things: 

Bullish scenario:

Ascending wedge of you cut off the double bottom wicks. Think this would set us up for a retest of the resistance line from our 10k attempt (@ 8500), which I expect to be rejected on the first try, but will probably breakthrough on the second attempt (@~8350). 
https://www.tradingview.com/x/QveH0wuT/

Bearish scenario:

We're actually making a bearflag with our pole starting at 8.8k This will also grind up to the resistance line before setting us up for the next drop. The target of the bearflag would be around ~7.7k and will become the more likely scenario if we fail to hold 8150 for whatever reason in the next 48 hours or so.
https://www.tradingview.com/x/2xoO5Jj1/

Good luck all!

Edit: Okay BTC has a mind of its own. 

More wicks on breakouts, price is spinning its wheels.  Seems like anytime it tries to move up on any momentum, there is too much profit taking.  Maybe it's because the barts have conditioned traders into abandoning positions asap.
I don't understand this price movement. It looks like the resistance around 8400 and support around 8200 are strong. Those wicks on lower time frames are ridiculous. Dips are getting bought like crazy, while at the same time any movement to the upside gets rejected with the same pressure.

These are almost all 100$ wicks, which makes stop losses practically useless: https://www.tradingview.com/x/5xjrp9e9/

I have no idea what is going on, still holding my short from 8450 which I entered two days ago.



I have a couple noob questions that I'd really appreciate insight into, especially as this market has become less volatile, I'm looking for ways to maximize my time versus returns. 

1. As an American, what exchange is best to short btc? 

2. Which trusted exchange has leverage that can be applied to trades? 5x etc.. 

What are bbands and how to view them?

Really appreciate the responses.

It looks like ETH lead this mini-dump, which it tends to do when it reaches >0.085. Hard to tell though... is there any way to see the candles on sub-1m timeframes?
BTC Dominance typically runs at an inverse to total market cap. We are currently seeing it creep back up (timestamped at 37.4 currently on CMC). Just something to keep an eye on. 3 month trend line is around 40%. If we see a correction back down, it will be great for anyone to grab cheap ALTs and gain BTC on the rebound. 
It is starting to look like G'Town instead of Giggity
We break down of the wedge if we go below 8050 USD
Now watch it bounce back from 7.8 to 8.2 before Bitmex reopens. 
Just a wild 1040 BTC sell wall on BFX appears, nothing to see here
How cruel would it be if we bounced around in the 8000-8100 range for another three days?

What happens next, folks? https://www.tradingview.com/x/J6wZVoPe/

We've been over this 8K price for 1 month, basically to the day. We've revisited it 3 times, which each subsequent high being notably lower and encountering a somewhat symmetrical zone from the other side of the rise to 10K.

I'd love to hear reasons why we're going to hit 8K and *not* go under it this time. Feels like we're due a bart completion to 7K for cosmic balance. I'll give a list of reasons I will ignore:  

1) Because it will be worth more later  
2) Because "who's selling?" at under 8K?

Tread (trade) carefully everyone. Violence in price will be unleashed. In which direction, both wicks and candles, is all that remains to be seen. 
If you think support at 8000 is going to hold I got news for you...
Get your popcorn boys. Trading to resume at 24 past the hour.
This seems like a bad place to panic sell or short. We are currently hugging the resistance of the giant descending wedge on the 12h, with the 7.8k resistance right beneath us. I'm not sure if I understand why the sentiment is so bearish. People have been calling for 7.8k the whole last week since we dropped from 9. Hitting a low that we expect should be an opportunity for a bounce imo.

Not that it couldn't break, I could easily see low 7000's in the next several days, but a bounce seems probable before too much more downward movement. I would have to consider closing my long in the 7600's simply because im overinvested right now, but we also have strong support at 7k right now from the ascending trendline from the 6000's lows, and the descending log ATH line we have yet to retest as support.

Edit: I am referring to shorter timeframes for a bounce, not the strength of support for predictions of whether we will be at 10k\+ or sub 6k a month from now.

This was posted on another subreddit by someone 4 years ago when the bitcoin market was in the dumper.  Thought you might find it interesting in light of what's happening right now:

\-\-\-

As someone who has invested $140k into Bitcoin, I don't understand why some of you are freaking out.

Seriously, calm down. Have some respect for yourself and the choices you make. As of today I have 770BTC and while I don't like the price going down just like you, I just continue to accumulate and look to the future.

I also don't intend to sell any BTC for fiat \(that could change if there's something I really want, and I can't find it for BTC\)

You just have to look at the big picture. BTC changes EVERYTHING in regards to transferring value over the internet.

For example tomorrow I believe there is going to be a service launched that allows you to "rent" your Hard Drive space to others over the internet, and it's all validated and compensated with BTC. There are so many different applications that are going to be built on top of Bitcoin.

You also have to look at the hash power of the Bitcoin network, it's HUGE and adds much more security compared to the alts.

Then you have remittance services that are being built on top, charging 3&#37; to consumers instead of the dreaded 10&#37; scenario.,

Bitcoin has everything going for it: high hash power, crappy world economy, old systems taking huge fees...it goes on and on.

Plus \(I could be mistaken\) it costs each miner about $108 to line each Bitcoin. The network is fine.

Just ask yourself why you're in this. If you're in this to feel happy go lucky every single day then you should reevaluate your thinking.

\-\-\-
Long from around $7,950. Stops below $7,700.

Edit: it's close enough to $7,800 for my purposes. RSI is oversold across the board. Should bounce a bit here. Possibly more than a bit.  
Hmmm this is getting really boring... maybe the real fair price of bitcoin is just like 8k~? I mean at least i think it costs like 8k atm to mine a btc (at least with the current electricity costs in the USA).
I smell a 'trap' coming soon. 
Oh dear, price actually moved.  To all the longers on bitmex, hang in there.
!long XBTUSD 8030 5X 20%

We are bouncing off the support for a falling wedge that I think could carry us back to the trend line ~8400. Tight stops set on this at 7925 as I'm not interested in getting underwater here.

Here we are zoomed in on the hourly with my scribble line:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/7cCUD6Xn/

I think the potential for one more stab at the 8k mark is there but I'm really having trouble seeing 7800 happening and those waiting for <7800 are just going to end up buying closer to 9k.  

Shorting Eth is also looking like a good sister trade:

Closed my long that’s averaged at 8280 at 8290. I profited from opening longs yesterday but I don’t want to get to greedy. Currently out of position but might open a small short. 
First time in a while I’ve actually been able to get any work done...

I always have the Mex tab in my browser and cam follow the price on there, but lately no need to even look ;)

That said, market making here is extremely profitable, but not really worth the risk of being caught with pants down. But you can easily make 0.5% on your stack every ten minutes if you just open and close positions at the exact same
price point
Thoughts on opening two positions here with stops below 8.1 and above 8.4 and whether it would be better to long or short June futures on Mex? 
This slow descent brings back bad memories from two days ago before the BRD. I'm long with tight stops, because we might be approaching a cliff.
It looks like it hanging off the edge of a cliff again...just added to my short.
Out of my long at 8225 for a small loss.

Updated my original post just a couple minutes ago with a hedge short on June futures @ 8330. 
[deleted]
Lowered the stop on my short...looking for it to maybe retest the .50fib @8200 and then finally go to 7600-7800 where I would be a buyer...good luck to all

peace
Is my blockfolio bugged or does coinbase actually have less than $50mm in volume? Didn't it use to be like 400 lmao. Sure BTC is down over 50% but that would still imply 200-ish million in volume. 
Im just going to assume that I'm losing my entire assigned margin on Mex to a giant $2000 wick as longs gets closed/liquidated. Anything that gets salvaged will be a bonus.

Edit: My position was closed somehow before trading resumed. I must have got really lucky with my stops.
Those twitter scams are ruthless. Already tailored to what just happened on Bitmex 🤣
Damn, those bitmexican bulls got rekt. The stophunt to surpass all stophunts. Arthur Hayes buying a new lambo tomorrow.
Closed short and opened long @ around 7970...will re-short higher unless we get the Giggity
I have been watching the stability/volatility index of bitcoin and ethereum lately. Ethereum is clearly rising while bitcoin is falling.

Seems like we're going for a new record of tightest BBands.

/u/noeeel , how tight do you think we can get them?
Y'know who is very happy with this price action?

Bots scalping 1% trades against ALTs to accumulate BTC.  So many chances to flip coins in this formation.

These quick candles that just go up then down, without little up/downs on the way, are perfect for the trailing to follow them near max/min.  And it's a good situation for triggering buys/sell trailing based on BB bands.
Making a small long exposure here even though I'm not trading. This is a pretty certain area where it'll recover (even a 10-15%).

look at the chart, we very rarely dump out of a cliff.
Happy I dropped my position last night. If bitmex was down right now and I had a position I’d be a bit worried.
Psychologically, the lower into the 7s this goes, the better chance for the bulls to hammer the price back up. People are going to be shitting their pants from the BGD, and will likely close shorts/open longs at this point.

That’s assuming 7800 support doesn’t hold.
[This market](https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/tense-spectators-watching-sporting-event-picture-id487704335).
If this bottoms out above $7500 it's an extremely bullish higher low.  Bottom at $7000 still bullish.  Bottom below the last low of $6.6 = bearish. 

AND we still haven't seen a BRD by the definition of $250 in one hour so bullish in that regard.  Could still see a BGD that will undo this in a hurry, but that is unlikely as it seems these fools have a lot of coins to dump.  Smart play is to sit back and buy out the dump. 
Guys the institutions are coming in any minute now...any minute now. /s
Here's what I am watching:
https://imgur.com/a/MAdRJEF

Price converging towards PSAR sell signal corresponding with key technical support pivot/zone (S3 - 30 min chart) at 8278; when that signal becomes a sell, it could test S4 which is uncoincidently at 7.8k where we could find a strong bounce.  I don't see any intermediate supports before then.  PSAR is 8207,  if that breaks, it will cascade down to test 8.1 again.

edit: 2hr chart shows this even more so how precariously support actually is; PSAR turning into sell on this time frame usually turns into bart. https://imgur.com/a/XvlGcT4

Ask not what digital currency can do for you, ask what you can do for digital currency.
Bulls should be excited about this price action and volume.  It's important for bulls to remember the mentality of the bears and how their actions are actually a large part of why the price will go up even more when it eventually starts increasing.  

There are only two kinds of bears:

1.  Those that sold btc short and HAVE to BUY back later at a lower price to make money

2.  Those that want to BUY at lower price than they currently can buy at.

So besides bears that have nothing better to do with their time, ALL BEARS WANT TO BUY BITCOIN

They may call it cheap, frugal, savvy, or smart but every single bear poster on here is also a Bitcoin buyer.  They just want the best of both worlds.

Through their delusion they see a stagnant and tight range for btc for the last 30 DAYS as a positive for them.  They see non record setting volume as "low" volume.  Of course they like to highlight that fact constantly to try to get impatient bulls to sell off their coin.  The mental picture they want to conjure for bulls is that lower volume must mean that no one is interested in bitcoin anymore and that there really isn't any action in it and that must mean that bitcoin is dead or something.

What they either fail to tell you or don't understand is that having 30 days of liquidity at these price levels is amazing and incredibly bullish.  The square cash app for instance right now is the number 1 downloaded app in the Apple IOS Itunes store and it allows its users to buy bitcoin.  In the just the first quarter of being offered they sold 31 million dollars of BTC.  They have an audience of 28 million people and growing.

Robinhood a low/no fee trading app offered in the itunes store starting offering crypto trading within the last 4 months.  Because of that they say that they went from under 1 million users to over 4 million users.  They now have more registered customers than E-trade and have handled over 100 billion dollars in equity trades on their platform.  

LocalBitcoins has near record volumes in Venezuela and Iran right now.

Coinbase just added 4 new products for institutional investors.  Coinbase in December alone had 400 million in trading revenue.  About half their volume is in btc.  It's important for bears to remember that Coinbase has grown its userbase by 66 percent since those December highs.  Although they don't reveal exact numbers it is likely they are at 25 million users presently.  It should also be remembered that most Coinbase users buy btc. and other crypto to hold based on their user history.  

A stable price for 30 straight days should scare the shit out of bears because of their want or need to buy back eventually.  Unless they exit the market entirely they HAVE to buy back at some point.

Low volume to a bear is 600mil-1bil per day which is actually TRIPLE the average daily volume of a year ago at this time.  What should really scare bears is that we are at the same price that we were in November of last year and the volume is slightly above that month even though the PRICE WAS INCREASING DRAMATICALLY.

In a market price movements cause volume to increase because it allows the possibility for a trader to have bought at the lower price and to sell at the higher price.  In a market with stagnant prices for 30 straight days yet volume that this higher than it was a year ago at this time, it stands to reason to question what the motivations are of the buyers and sellers are in the market since it becomes more and more unlikely that they are buying or selling to speculate on or cashout from quick price movements.  

To have the same or higher volume at the same price level as last year is very bullish because the buyers at this level are likely very high quality in relation to the eventual appreciation of the price.  They are acting like a loaded spring of sorts because if the composition of the buyers is increasing because of user growth across all sources of liquidity (and they are) like Coinbase, Square, Robinhood, Localbitcoins, etc. it has to cause a floor on future price swings downward.  

So what I believe is happening is that micro buyers who intend to hold and invest are chewing up all of the coin from shorts trying to tank the market.  That this is a huge bear trap that is not obvious because it is the aggregate demand of millions of buyers that is preventing a crash instead of whales on the other side providing the price stability.

Put simply the market is growing and becoming fragmented and that sellers and shorts are being trapped.
Sup with that 8500 wick? Big market buy? 
Added to short from 8300, @ 8228 

I’m expecting some people did the same as the bottom support of the triangle will most likely act as resistance 

Edit: https://www.tradingview.com/x/VpqEsjyN/
After being out for a month or so I'll slowly be re-entering again, only hodl though for the time being. Any big things I missed?
Careful, made a test order through bitmex, took 30 seconds to go through.  And only clicked once.  Don't spam that button right now and expect slippage...
Small question. If i see a lot of sells at bitfinex for 8201 \(like 100 BTC\) but there aren't any limit buy\-orders on the book for that price. Does that mean the limit order that gets filled is OTC or hidden or something? If thats the case, how can anyone talk about buy\- or sellwalls? I mean, we dont see them. Am i missing something?
Yikes
Our 3 day support is about to be tested around $8115

Edit: Broke though  ( Sorry BitMexers’)
Well if anyone wants to have fun: 

When BitMex comes back online, just constantly refresh the BixMexRekt Bot on twitter to see how many long panic close.


Those poor guys https://twitter.com/bitmexrekt?lang=en
Did anyone try / manage to change the leverage on Bitmex, after it came back up, but before the actual trading resumed?

I had cancelled my orders, but I didn't think about trying to lower my leverage as well. It only dawned on me after the trading resumed - at which point it was, ofc, too little too late.
Wow . I caught a wick down to 7960 on june futs! Thanks mex!
Support turned resistance \(8.1k\)?
Open your shorts gentlemen.

The beautiful 7000s upon us.
If you are trading for a living this is the part where you cut your losers short.

My comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8k1a59/daily_discussion_thursday_may_17_2018/dz59xz0/

I'm not cutting my losers short but that's because the losses will affect my lifestyle and not my capital. If you are a trader, this is a tough call.
Waiting for the 4hr RSI to get to 25 and load up the truck
opened a long since I think this is due for a quick move up 
yeah this is starting to look exactly like 9.4k. just a question of time before we go down i think
I'm in a long, and I accept that the sell pressure has been pretty relentless. However, I can't shake the feeling that this all could just be accumulation before an eventual retest of $11,700. Would anyone be that surprised if we popped up over the next couple of weeks to around that level? Exactly. So, wouldn't that probably give people who bought at these levels plenty of time to offload their coins at those levels with ~40% profit?

edit: thanks for the feedback guys, that's why I'm here. Definitely interesting to hear that several people would be completely shocked by a retest of $11,700 within the next couple of weeks, I wouldn't have thought that but I hear you loud and clear.
is "sell in may and go away" still a thing ?
I really feel like 7.8 will need to be tested, there's too much uncertainty even with the (unconfirmed) bullish/support formations.  Feels like sellers are using this formation to pull more bulls into what will be another test at another important technical support level - which to me makes sense since BTC never gives anything away for free.
Love reading the tweets people send to Bitmex at this time. Over leveraged long traders getting rekt blaming Bitmex.

They gave you a heads up. Staying in a long during a 5 day dump isn't the smartest thing.
Bought my btc for 150 a coin.


Come at me bro.......
So it looks like we’re in a [falling wedge](https://www.tradingview.com/x/S6TVWhEa/)  (bullish?) on the daily, but inside a [rising wedge](https://www.tradingview.com/x/IgO7tph9/) on the 4H.

What do we make of this? I’ve been hearing calls for 7200 as absolute bottom due to long term support, but what are people’s targets here?
So will it double (triple if you count wicks) bottom at 8000-8100? Place your bets! Gonna bore long at 8164 methinks. 
Bitmex: "Trading will begin at 24 past the hour"

Its going to be ugly
Filled limit buys at 8000 and 7950. Anticipate that we could see the 7800s, but don't want to get greedy as I think we'll see a sizable bounce in that range. Time to be patient.
Falling Wedge within another falling wedge? or nah?

https://imgur.com/a/j8Rn31R

(tried to bold the lines of the larger one)

EDIT: 3 points of contact on both support & resistance lines for each of them on the 6 hr
I've never been more bullish before in my life. Watching these silly attempts by bears is like seeing a guy with erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation problems trying to satisfy a pornstar.
[2014 comparison](https://i.imgur.com/ZUrXFNW.png).  Its pretty likely we bounce from here.  I'm long from 8k.  The drops are getting weaker and soon it will be the bull's turn.
8272 was support that is now resistance, we'll pivot around it like a zone, but now this area will need significant volume to break upwards or will test 8207 which is the inflection point where PSAR on 30 min turns to sell signal. I generally find that price tries to moves to the PSAR inflection point price before continuing the larger trend/formation (which at this moment is still a WIP).  If 8207 fails, then 7.8 test is a near certainty. When that happens, I am adding hand over fist to my long.

https://imgur.com/a/XvlGcT4

Edit: 8228 is the 5 min PSAR inflection which would be a sell if we cross from above it, this could cascade the price immediately through the 30 min PSAR of 8207 if breached.  Could make an excellent dip buying opp.

Edit: Once again, ETH leads the way.  If BTC moves one way, I see it as a fakeout if ETH did not or does not move in concert.
We need capitulation. Bring it on !
Oh yeah, we're definitely going down for a little while.  I will be buying this dip but not tonight.  Would very much like to know how all this Bitcoin made its way into the hands of the sellers.  Did they borrow it? If so, we'll bounce hard when it bottoms.  If not, they'll run out and kick themselves for selling just like everybody else eventually does.

Is Mt Gox menace done yet? 16,000 coins gone this time?

I don't believe for a second that this numbskull is out of coins. He's gonna dump again.  Keeping my fiat powder dry for now.
https://twitter.com/PeterLBrandt/status/997261386966183936

ETH might dump hard and bring BTC with it..
Well that's 3 times that bears have been rejected at 8100. It even happened on what appeared to be a completed H&S on the 1H. This is starting to feel bottom-y, but the lack of volume has me concerned that there just aren't enough players to make a difference. 


https://www.tradingview.com/x/M5nb6A4X/
Nice support at 8k bulls 👏
With all the sarcasm going on, can anyone tell me plain if BTC is screwed as in we’re in for a big drop? Sorry for being a noob
Bears couldn't even dump it below $6000 today. Bullish.
Neither a pump nor dump after Concensus? 
Moving my stops up on my long to just sub 8200. If we bounce there to anything under 8250, I'm walking manually. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/SLGunXtI/

edit: June futures inexplicably is sitting at a $100 premium, so I opened a hedge short at 8330. 
Entered my primary buy-zone https://www.tradingview.com/x/gjBGoFsG/

( https://www.tradingview.com/x/5t6oEuLE/)
!short XBTUSD close 8000

Approximate close - bought in with fiat on gdax/binance. Posted a bit late since I'm sitting in the parking lot at work doing this on my phone.

R/R trade here. Like how 8k is acting, think this could wick down into the 7ks again but I'll just eat the loss if we go below 7.8k.
Where do you guys think the carnage will stop? Or do you think it’s up from here?
Little long from 8500 underwater but I have time and will buy this dip, maybe around 7500.
There is no way this will break up after so much inconfidence and so much bearishness. Conference had zero positive effect on btc price, in fact, it had major negative effect. Might see sub $6k within a few weeks!
Again my physical buys just below 8150 hit. Still believe this is the new  psychological floor if it holds

Also fits quite well as a 50% retracement middle level from last big drop and top https://imgur.com/a/jw9NPL0
For some bullfever, check out this major and very important TL from 1800 that we are currently bouncing on: https://www.tradingview.com/x/4RPbRYgv/
stop loss triggered at $8,008 back to fiat 3.6% loss
So if we test 8k again soon and it bounces does that mean we could see 9k again this weekend?  Two touches?

I'm not nearly as annoyed by losing money  as I am by bears making money.
It feels bad to see Bitcoin breaching the $8,000 mark and touching $7,982. First it fell to almost $8,100 and we saw a push up around $8,200, then it fell again, harder second time. As I finished this post, it is falling again for the third time but it was just a wick.

I was away but just hoped in, I didn’t like the drop. My long is about 4 feet deep as of writing. I saw it 4 feet above some days ago, but I didn’t close it, because I believed in the coin and the future of it. I still believe in this in the long term. 

I am not closing my position; my liquidation is sub $7,400. I came up with new plans and put them in place in case I need to reorganize my position. I won’t be happy if this falls just like that, it will break my faith in the technology; and; my investment of both time and money in it. 

If you have cold storage coins that are passed the long term capital gains threshold, now would be the time to sell. Lower lows and lower highs, look back at 2015 and realise its almost uncanny resemblance.

I'm long term bullish but my 2014 coins are in the way to the exchanges. Looking to buy back 2x my current stack sometime in late July/August. Will keep a handful of coins to trade with.
Bitmex’ers-
Curious how accurate testnet engine is vs main engine. Is it a fairly accurate sim?
Thanks in adavance
June futures is erratic, jumped up to like 8150 at one point, careful with stops

Bitmex down for anyone else? im getting 403 forbidden
So ummm...Whats it mean when there is a triple bottom? Is this about to fall through the floor?
Oh well, that's what I get for opening a small long and going to sleep.  Now I wake up to sub 8000.  I should have set an alarm or something.   But back to being short and staying short when I sleep.
Can someone who uses the TD indicator tell me if that 20:00 UTC candle was a 9 on the hourly?
[Here's the chart I'm looking at](https://imgur.com/a/HdbU6zq). A copy paste of 2014-2017, putting us around $2500 by EOY and nudging $200,000 around mid 2021. Seems almost too realistic.
This is going to wick down so bad lmao holy shit this is going to be fucked up to watch. If you can time a long I’d do it. 
longer we stay in this range longer i think this will shoot up.
But then, what do i know..?
C'mon Bitcoin. Do something today. 
On mobile, quick post.

Looks like a bear flag inside of a falling wedge inside of a bigger triangle.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/LE25M010/

https://www.tradingview.com/x/L1Kg9DSh/

https://www.tradingview.com/x/5YnX2WBp/

I think this bear flag will fail and we shoot up. If not, this falling wedge fails and we are boned.

I’m out of a position. 
The bullish 4h divergence and the cloud support+50% fib support make me think that we will retest 8400 and 8600 sooner rather than later, going below 8000 will require some serious coin to be thrown, which is not impossible to be honest. Im waiting to drop my 8260 buy soon for a few % gains.
Ascending triangle on the 4hr candles right? Ignore the long wicks obviously 
Well now we have a direction. Everyone eying
7800 it seems so now is a good time to put some buys orders if you believe in it. Note: I dont.
what a fucking day...   not even volume in the dumps :D
Is that it? Shorts - you taking profits or holding on?
I sense the huge " my lambo is taking too long " frustration of apparently Hodlors. It feels so good to be a trader.  We make lambos on the way up and down. 
About 6 months ago I was in Wanchai, Hong Kong where most exchanges are located, back then I hear lots of Korean, Hindi and even Arabic speaking people (mostly here for arbitrage) chatting and exchanging tips, or just smoking in the street corners. Those days are long gone. Now even bitcoin ATMs are re-opened... Previously exchanges shut them down for "upgrade" but it's just because they don't earn as much fees as counters. From my perspective, this is a several years long bear market. 
1h, 2h and 6h Bbands are quite tight, expect a move soon!
Buying spot and margin \(hopefully\-bitmex\) 8000\-8050$. Everyone waiting for 7900$ means this will stop 100$ higher, because big players need to buy before the crowd.

Selling here is like selling sub 7000$, but ok, someone needs to buy up :\)
..and a wild bear appears 
On your marks...get set...
Bitmex is online in post only. You can remove your orders too.
8k holding well, and after that we have 7800 right?
Is this chart correct? https://blockchain.info/charts/n-orphaned-blocks?timespan=1year

Where is the news saying that the oraphan blocks all died?

"Engineer kill all orphans"
Here's what I'm thinking on the 1D chart.

BBands are widening, but the 1D candles are touching the bottom line of the BBands. Typically when this happens the price will rebound. My guess is 1/3rd to 1/2 of the width of the BBand.

Now if you combine this with Stoch RSI. It's making a double bottom, almost nearly 0, on the 1D chart as well. When this has happened a subsequent run up in price has also happened. I kind of drew it on the chart. (blue circles)

If we make a higher low from the 6000's then there's some possibility to remain bullish. (blue slanted line on chart) If we don't make a higher low on the 1D then I'd say look at below. 

Just my opinion/take. This isn't financial advice.

https://i.imgur.com/tYCiJfS.png
daily and very short-term stochrsi severely oversold on most exchanges, other timeframes are declining or fairly oversold

Last time the monthly stochrsi was this oversold btc doubled/trippled in value shortly afterwards (it hasnt been this overosld since may 2015, or 3 years...!)

Maybe not the best indicator, but it is some hopium for bulls nevertheless... !
You tell me what the fruity you think the price is going to do? Whats with the downvotes? 

No joke, even downvotes carry a lot of information, and I love analyzing information. I am also very honest. lol. Stay happy everyone and no losing money! :)
Bitcoin is starting to feel like a real drag and the Netscape of crypto. 
I think consensus dip is over. IMO we're going to have another go at 10K, momentum may pick up after the weekend as we consolidate in this range for some days. Sub 8k is becoming less and less probable with every passing day, the only direction left is up. 

Sideways movement will pump the alts which will be reabsorbed in BTC to make a run. Alt pump precedes BTC pumps, as I trade alt/btc I noticed this trend alot. Even the first BGD was after a significant alt pump. It seems that now money flows into alts then into BTC as traders take profit. 
Meanwhile my opinion changed a little. I just accepted the bearmarket. We have seen such a great 2017 and now we face a downtrend for at least one or two years. Glad, I took about 50% of the stake out in december. Literally when BTC hitted 17k (downtrend already started). The rest I took out slowly and right now, only 1k is still in the game. Lets wait and see, where this is heading. 
With all these projects out there, there have to be a drying up of 90% of the projects. Really. And then I think 10-20 coins will make it through this bearmarket and survive and then be the new currencys for massadoption. Timeframe 3-5 years from now. 

But I am really sad, that the last exciting year is over. It was phantastic, epic. And finally I bought myself a piano from the money ;) It was just epic, really.

So clearly as it seems, we are not heading to $8,400 anytime soon. 

I see a good probability of price painting a double bottom at $8,100, before continuing its original path (this coin loves ranges and also, ways to break them).

We could possibly go as low as $8,100 before bouncing (I still do not see it going sub $8,000 at the very worst, let alone $7,xxx is out of the questions). $8,100 will be a very prime times, there will be a lot of trading activity.

It feels like some kind of a test, perhaps a kind of gamble as some of other say so..
time to bust out your best n=3 statistics, guys
Conference is over and it had no positive effect on the price. In fact, I believe this is the first time price dropped drastically prior to a huge conference, kept dropping during it, and TA suggests it will keep dropping after it. No major news/announcement was made that could help the price recover. Thomas Lee was, again, dead wrong about his expectations/predictions, and almost everyone is bearish - just like the beginning of the year when we all expected $6k - and $6k we got.

Anyone longing here has balls of steel. I personally wouldn't long bitcoin even if I got free money and guarantee to keep possible profits to do so. It simply is not worth the headache and time required to baby-sit. Expecting a severe drop, sub $8.2k by day's end without a doubt. 
I've never seen anything more pathetic than the bears of 8k-10k range. 6k-8k and 10k-12k they were way more impressive. This right now is unbearable to watch. Having to watch this idiocy before the inevitable retest of high 11ks is truly painful.
I am looking into loaning some of my coins on Bitfinex, not done before, so I have a few quesitons if you guysgirls dont mind.

When looking at funding rates, it states 0.01% per day for BTC. 
So if I loan $150k worth at this rate, I will only earn $15 per day in interest income? Or $1500? I HIGHLY doubt the latter, and am inclined to believe it is the $15 per day, in which case I will not even consider loaning as that is a ridiculously low amount for the risk taking and money involved.

I am asking because I wonder if I should 150000 x0,01 or 150,000 x0,0001 (0,01 / 100 to get the actual percentage to use in the calculation).


Trading back in 2 minutes.

Just feels like we're circling the drain here really. Putting up a good fight for 8k but we just slip ever and ever closer to dropping through.

Is there any bullish sentiment left.. I can't see any. Yes some strength to hold on to the 8s but I can certainly see us repeating this pattern all the way into the 7s and then potentially lower.

Hope not but the trend is most certainly set for the time being. 
Easiest long ever opened on that. Thanks bitmex! 
I believe [this book is a more relevant read](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0544574788/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_38J.AbAT6CKY1) than the previously recommended 'Demagoguery/Democracy' book.
This market is going to be fun, full of bounces/traps for the bulls all the way to 2500/4000.
Are we building a support at $8,300 before the next move? Looks like it. 
[deleted]
If we break below this line, could it be a Head and Shoulders pattern in a overall downtrend \(descending base line\)?

[https://imgur.com/a/jTZDf3u](https://imgur.com/a/jTZDf3u)
Get ready, set,   GOOOOOO!
can everyone here just sell bitcoin so we can get rid of this shitcoin? and let crypto truly boom   without being influenced by a dead technology?
Remember two weeks ago when the bulls were convinced the trend had reversed?  I remember.
Possible Bullish divergence on the 1h chart.

EDIT: possible*
I won't trade for a month if this won't go 8300 within 3 hour.
Price being propped hard on bitfinex. Little movement, relatively a lot of volume, slow parabolic down
What happens to open orders on bitmex? Will they go post only mode for a little bit?
Guys, I have hidden orders for thousands of bitcoins on all major exchanges at 7900. You will not see the 7800's, sorry. Better buy now.
now that all those longs that didn’t learn from that death maul bullshit are rekt’d I think we can start lubing for that MoaBGDs
Looks like my short/selling advice a few hours ago was right call! However, longs still have time to abandon losing ship... the immense crash will commense in just a few hours. Expecting sub $8k within 24 hours based on overbought short-term timeframes and overall bearishness. Conference this year is huge reason to be long-term (1-2 years) bearish on all crypto's.

Expecting $3k bitcoin by December.

Edit: also noticed how parabolic "trav" has been quiet on his bulltardness lately, lololo, profits come and go, lololo!!
This is the beginning of the end for bitcoin!
Very disappointing action from the bears. couldn't break down past 8k far. Expecting 8400 within a day or two.
[deleted]
Why is there so much fear amongst the traders for god sake? uuhhh.
Looking forward to the chaos when BitMEX goes back up.
We won't see 10k again in the next decade...Institutions don't invest post bubbles...they just don't...it's simply logic.

Holy crap 44%? That's monstrous indeed, well done!

Sorry about your subsequent losses, but probably good to wait on the sidelines a little for a clearer picture. I've barely been doing anything since we dropped to 8.2 on saturday(?), just buying some minor amounts on dips with varying success, (6" tuna sub) I hope the weekend or next week something will have happened so it's a little less risky to trade in.  
Have you read the troll box? Most of them never had minds. 
Seems like everyone and their grandma was/is waiting for 7800, so that might be the time to jump the gun a little bit
hope it works out cause that would be pretty bullish imo
Maybe this is where the boredom phase begins? Maybe we'll oscillate in a couple of $100's for the next couple of weeks. I think we might not see a whole lot of movement until we hit the resistance line in 48 hours or so, if we meander through that sideways, I'll become bearish on volatility, not price, haha. 
I do. I remain silent a lot of the time.
Personally like drawing the wedge support starting from one more local low forward. Makes it much more filled in and wedge like, and we haven't yet broken down from it or wicked out of it then.
Those fake-outs are becoming harder and harder to spot. What's your feeling of the market right now chew?

The ascending triangle was invalidated but we bounced on the resistance of the previous pennant: https://www.tradingview.com/x/Ot7fbDLP/

Hard to draw this without some heavy wick-cutting. 

/u/CatPizzas32  made an interesting suggestion with this long term support : https://www.tradingview.com/x/GO4gzyB7/

With this support, the move to 10k and retrace to 8k could be inside a giant ascending triangle with 12k+ in sight.
you were shorting with a target to  7800, and opened a long because of short term buying pressure which went away, why not resume shorting to protect the fiat value of your stack?
Short it
You're not alone in thinking this way:

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/M7sw2Nch-BTCUSD-Dread-It-Run-from-it-Destiny-still-Arrives/

I agree with this multi-support being the ultimate buy-zone. I'm not sure if whales would let us take the obvious buy-zone though :(
You make a salient point. The 7s have always been blasted through on the way up, down and back up again.
I doubt we go below 6400. 5900 was such a crazy day back in Feb. Many people are still shell shocked about it
You will eventually find a pattern in anything if you look hard enough across different timeframes, as you have here
Astute observation. Rode last week’s down but I’m out of position now.

Will wait to see where a bounce takes us.
buyers need to stop catching a falling knife. no one's buying high but everyone and their mom thinks buying the dip is free money

I'm going to cry if we break support like this

Or a BRD 
BGD to $4500 is small consolation for some.
Or a BRD to complete the bart from 4/12
its still just chop, 3% here or there, for a proper BTC dump this needs to go down 10-15-20%, and to get there we might see a BRD if $7800 goes down and everyone starts bailing 
1m too.  It looks ridiculous, almost as if everyone forgot about Bitcoin the second that BitMEX went down.
17 red candles in a row, that is reccord :D

Heh, looks like someone is just casually moving a hidden sell wall down every chance they get. Seen a few buys that didn't effect the order book.
you're a hodler now, harry
you should be able to exit at breakeven at least if you want. 
Setting a limit sell around 8340 should be good for a small profit.

If you believe it's going up, then just let it ride.
you can do an abortion.
watch ... it'll be a winner.
I know several of these.

Even more frustrating because I was here from the start and I actually tried to create a startup and we tried an ICO but our marketing wasn't good enough and I didn't have sequoia behind me. So it didn't work out.

Now I see guys starting up with no knowledge of how the simplest things work. Asking me for help on their token model...

Yes, I'm bitter. 
Breaking: ICO's are discovered to be scams. 

Seriously though, the liquidity sucks and the crypto dominance chart is skewed because of this. Bitcoin is only really in competition with legitimate projects in the space, not the 1000+ pieces of shit out there, and even other top ten coins have very bad liquidity compared to BTC.
Eventually the foolpool will run empty even without regulation, I mean even the sec is starting an intentional shitcoin to teach poeple about shitcoins.
Don’t be jealous cuz your buddy that got into crypto later than you has the business sense to cash in. You would too if you had the opportunity!
> FATCA data

why would they need FATCA data? isn't the "Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)" to be reported back the IRS?

But US citizens cannot be registered on bitfinex, (a) so why should non-US citizens give this info, (b) and why has the IRS or US government the right to demand this information from foreigners?

I am not trading on BFX, just doesn't seem to make sense for them to ask this data.


Deleted. What's this all about?
Guessing automod removed it, needs manual approval (obviously relevant for this sub.)
Only for KYCed accounts, confirmed by their staff. And then again if you only trade crypto and you did a KYC then you are doing it wrong anyway.

It is working for me and haven't noticed any downtime.
Me too, can't log in. Their price seems to be diverging from the market too
I've no issues in Europe.
It was down for me but back up now at 843am new york time.
pamp eet?
Do you think that bitmex should launch their own coin? They would use the money they raise to increase the scale of business. 
I'm pretty skeptical of that triangle tbh, ascending triangles are *usually* continuation patterns, not reversals. Calling it a bear pennant/flag makes more sense to me given the previous movement.

Still may be a good r/r trade if you think this current movement is just another fakeout; anecdotally this seems much more sustained than others though imo.
you mean hit support. 

And I'd be cautious here. That move down broke down the 5m bbands, and is putting pressure on the lower 15m bband.

Nice job man, you held strong through that fake pump from last night.
You've either closed at the best possible time or the worst! 

The ascending triangle is on the verge of breaking down. If it holds, then more chop/sideways is on the menu for the foreseeable future.

If it breaks, then maybe we'll finally get some solid direction for at least the short term.

Now it just says downtime in progress. The only order I tried to place was a short add at like 8390 in case it flashes one way or the other, so if it went through, then fine. 
Idk man I’m getting worried about their hamsters 
It’s a bit of a sorry sight isn’t it
Even though I'm short I don't feel safe without being able to get back into bitmex and set stops. I hate this. Worried it's going to bounce hard somewhere.
Bruh we have been through this before many times with a few different exchanges. Everyone has these dark fantasies of what COULD happen in the worst case scenario, but ultimately I bet we look back at it and view this outtage as a non event. 

My guess is they allow people to close orders before they come back online.
Not even waiting for signs of bounce?
GL
Damn that is a fucking ballsy call. Putting a lot of weight on 7.8k. Why not just long from 7850 with a stop loss right at 7700? 
That's just fucking dandy.
If i was a super whale i would just market buy or sell now big time and watch the world burn :-D. JK plz don't :(
LOL, bitmex is garbage!  They make so much money, their infrastructure should(edit) be rock solid.
Look at the stability across exchanges while BitMEX is down.

If this isn't anecdotal support for the "manipulating spot while margin trading futures" whale theory, I dunno what is 
I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad I have no stops currently. I think happy. 
this can't end well
Good luck chaps!

maybe it will go up!

...cool, I'll exit my short at 7200 then.
Not a fan of the volume profile and the empty space in the beginning of that wedge.
I wanted to make the same post, this is why I choose 7888 as buy in price. Because of the large wall I go for 7911
I was extremely fortunate to notice the June futures price hanging at 8325 selling into a $3M limit buy on the books as BFX broke the support line. I was already opening a hedge entry when the SHTF. Got a $100 premium on my entry and manually closed the long on the bounce to 8225 for a loss.

Your caution earlier was spot on, I appreciate it. 
What is the rationale not to long if at least temporal upward move is very likely? 
I won't be able to afford to replace my table if it reverses so it better not

https://www.tradingview.com/x/elFKnFEs/

someone else posted this.

basically it's where most of our volume has been. it's strong support for like 80 reasons, which is why a drop below is pretty bearish. 

it's the 50% retracement from our run-up recently, it's where the insane bull run started, it's where most of our volume has been, and a drop below would be a new low

but yea, $7800-8200 is a pretty magnetic area
It's not really about a specific point IMO. It's this entire zone. There's so many conflicting signals that it's near impossible to know what's coming next. It seems like the bots and market makers feel the same way because every pump is being slapped down and every dump is being bought. 

The market completed a cycle and is now indecisive about if we go up or down from here. We had a 100% bounce on ETH and many alts and BTC also had a good run. Many alts and BTC retraced 50% from the high. What worries me is that ETH has not yet really dumped. I fear that it's going to drag the market down when it inevitably happens. 
Because they are bulltards who came from cryptocurrency/bitcoin subs stating every now and then that they see a:

1) bullish div
2) bullflag
3) rsi oversold

Of course they are not traders, they just heard it once or twice and they keep adjusting their cringy TA to make them more comfortable with bagholding. They see a support but they dont see a resistance (moon ahead obv) cause thats how they wanna graph to look like.
"Bart chasing"
> It feels like there's some merit to setting a buy 1.5% below us 

Sure, go for it and then there is bad news and the market sells off 15% and you catch a buy 1.5% into that drop.
I would say BTC should buy me dinner first, but then I realized that no restaurants accept bitcoin.

Edit:  New ICO idea: BiteCoin - a crypto specifically for restaurants (because for some reason we need different currencies for different things that you buy.......looking at you Dentacoin.)

Edit2:  Apparently BiteCoin exists.  This is from thier website: "Welcome to Bitecoin the future of Cryptocurrencys" 

Where do I sign up?
Maybe I'm misremembering, but haven't there been scenarios like this (exchanges down, short acting FUD scare, etc.) that dip the market temporarily and then slingshot upwards? As in, the sellers get a taste of what they were going for but bulls jump on all at once (more quickly than under normal trading circumstances) and they push it back up and then some, causing a breakout? Similar to a capitulation that bottoms hard and fast.
>rejecting 8k.

we are above 8k, how can you think the market rejected that mark?
!short XBTM18 add 8130 25% 
Have you checked the funding?
Nicely done. I considered adding as well but my position was already stupid big given how much I've gotten chopped up the past few days. 
bull div on the 4hr., Descending wedge, exact same fractal as March 8th - 18th. I'm long.
What price currently needs to hold? 7.8k?
Indeed. Hammy II is in a pellet coma and taking some time off his wheel.
I thought, $100 premium, that is too good to be true, let's sell!  Oh.....
Promise?
If we break through the 8230 support turned resistance line from the Ascending triangle that broke down

https://www.tradingview.com/x/nOLLC6P3/

Which it has bounced off twice 

You think the bulls have the fire power to push through?
I do think there's inherent risk and they aren't responsible or obligated.

Still, they're gonna lose customers on this fuckup.  Love em, but they've fucked up.
They dont give a shit and never have. I remember last december when mark price instantly dropped $1k on perps because gdax went down (which had 2k premium or so), it liquidated a FUCKTON of people. Bitmex completely ignored it.
cannot even imagine the bitmex shitshow when it comes back online... if bitfnex traders have some class they should wait before "the big move"; my bitmex hedge short is not in danger, but so many people will lose a lot of money
Why dont people just close the existing short position instead of opening a long to hedge? It seems like the effect is the same
May as well, going back up before liquidation seems inevitable anyway.  But I guess you aren't going to potentially take this down so far so maybe that mentality isn't helpful.
At 7 the bear market ends and we all go to the moon?
Surely you have seen some green days :\)
I lost 90% of my stack in my first two weeks margin trading. And the worst part? Most of those trades I could've broken even on or profited on if I had just waited them out a day, an hour, sometimes even minutes.

After that huge loss, I'm currently at about 1/3 of my original stack. My advice to you? Take a break. My first loss was a big one and I went insane after that trying to make it back. Learning patience has helped me trade better, weather the losses better (because there will always be losses), and feel better.  

Most importantly, if we're back over 8k tomorrow, don't hate yourself for it.
Bit premature imo, Id be borderline shocked if it stays below 8k overnight and doesn't bounce up at least to around 8.1
Where were you long from? 

Sorry man 
Promise me you won't kick yourself too much.

It fucking sucks when you make bad trades - I know because I've been there. Hell, last night I was fucking livid because I got repeatedly stopped out because of wicks when I otherwise would've profited. My fault, I know. 

Point is, we all make shitty trades from time to time, and the market has been extraordinarily hard to call either way lately. 

Look after yourself, take a break and come back when you feel a bit better.
Well just know if you’re feeling down and need some pep talk we are all here for you.

We may all just be internet friends, but we can all be positive and help cope with negative emotions at times. 
Should have waited to see if 7.8k holds 
That is painful but not sure why would let a position move against you 50%.  Rule #1 is cut your losers quickly.

Although I've taken some huge losses in the past when I didn't follow that rule.   Anyway you lived to fight another day and all you can do is try to learn from it and soldier on.
Your sizing is too big or your not using stops at all.
A safe rule is to risk 1% per trade although this is from traditional markets.
Certainly don't lose anymore than 5%, no matter how you feel or how 'dumb' the market is.

Rule #1 preserve your capital
Rule #2 don't forget rule 1
> a 50% loss 

Ugh.
I love that song Dido
Contrarian trading, I like it. 
Nope, right now polls show 68% to 32% of people expect we see $10001 before $5999.

Also, ~59% majority expects $7800 before $8600.

So you are perfectly in line with the majority. Not contrarian at all 😛
Where do you think it will bounce back up to?
All in as in short? 
so why take the risk of sub 7.8k, and not wait for 8.4k once it get's there?
I think the polls are great. Of all the crypto subs, this might be the most likely to show some leading indicators.  

love the polls!
I like polls but I hate big bold fonts.
I do not mean this in a snarky manner...how do you come up with those percentages?
Hey I like your username!
[deleted]
going under 8k is like bulls admitting defeat. They vehemently defend 8k until bears go to hibernation again. Those big sellers will eventually come back when they see 8k is holding and can go up any time.
It’s just market manipulation from the same whale or same group who has been pumping and dumping he last few days. The person wants to mess with the market so much that the overall sentiment becomes bearish, then he/she/they will come in and scoop up billions worth of cheap btc at 5 to 6k.
Yeah I mean if you you look at a 1W or 1M chart and ignore the barts, the whole thing is behaving according to SOME TA principles at least.
yeah, people are watching for formation in small time frames which doesn't really work in chop/sideways movements. The support of this triangle was to steep anyway. The ascending triangle could be bigger like this: https://www.tradingview.com/x/mNv2QfiN/

Or it could be a bear pennant even though they are rarely horizontal
!help close
Dude, you got them prices wrong I think. But then again, its your game not mine. Cheers!
Thank you for contributing, I pray it pays off well. Cheers!
That's not a crazy wick by any mean, you'd be better off starting a very small position with plenty of margin to keep liqui well out of reach tbh.
This is the move I'm making myself as well. Long 5X 20% stack, if we dip a bit add, if it dips hard I'm out. Might abandon ship if alts crap out first.
I'm leaning towards this as well. Low leverage, adding scaling all the way down to 7800. Perhaps with a hedge short in there if 8K falls. 
I'm still in my short and I'd open one here even if I didn't have one open. This will stall at $7800 but not be a big bounce and we're going to accelerate downwards over a week or two. I'll probably re-evaluate after I see what happens at $7800 (if we get there, which I obviously think we will) 

it's always possible this just doesn't have the steam to go below though...
7850ish. Reshort 7750ish or 8150ish. Whatever comes first. 

Stops at breakeven once 8100 falls
I think I will go long here, or at least flat.  If 8100 doesn't fall, then could be a good bounce back up to 8500 perhaps.  It's risky though to try to scalp a DCB when could have  $500 drop any second.
It's ironic with their front page article "BitMEX Technology Scaling: Part 1" next to the "api timeout" error.
It's back

Edit: aaand it's gone again.  I put in a stop during the brief time up (for other reasons, I had to step away from the computer), which probably is not a good thing.
Im voting scenario 1. It's going to be a shitshow when they open.
Scenario 2 will happen.

Within a second of scenario 1 which happens first.

Then repeat.
You're not worried about a hard bounce at 7.8?
I think you really overtraded here, or at least traded with too loose a stop. Hardly anyone would risk 5x of their ENTIRE stack trading in 1 position, and now you are stuck as the price possibly goes even lower. I’d Advise you atleast cut your position down as this position is too huge I believe and might end up giving you even bigger losses. 
I closed my 8300 long as soon as I saw $8000 was going to drop out. That acted as support for way too long, and I think this thing will dump long and hard now...we might even see a BRD like the BGD that fired off last month's bull rally. 
It's said about every single next support/resistance.
Mainly because of human psychology.
Psychology is largely in play here. You ever get a sense of dread when the price ticks from 8257 to 8256? Not much, I'd bet. But it's a little scarier when it dips from 8200 to 8199, and even scarier from 8000 to 7999.
Everyone is using the same TA, following the same shills \(and not shills\), etc. 
Ah, someone who doesn't watch the 15min and gets it. Yes. Albeit it's not as clear as on say, eth or eos, 1D macd, stoch rsi etc. should tell you not to short this. Longing with a very low liquidation in case of a last leg down is the best r/r here.
I use MACD on several timeframes to trade quite often, but it's an absolute mess right now. 4hr / 1d / 3d are very out of sync, and 1h just looks as stupid as you'd expect it to with the recent price action. RSI is at this stupid 'almost oversold, but not really' level that makes it pretty much completely useless, too. Looking for some clarity either way before entering any big positions.

Lol that's why I had to set a stop, and when I came back bitmex was down.
Yes it could be a double bottom at around 8100.  Time for a bounce, agreed.
Only logical move here. Lol'ing at half of this sub trying to day trade the chop and flipping their positions back and forth constantly with little to no profit. 

Never been so comfortable with my long a bit underwater. 
We only seem to be jumping up one rung on the ladder. That puts the next Bart up to 8.2 to 8.4 range before we step down to  8k

Https://www.tradingview.com/x/m59UADf0
good trade imo, even if we drop to 7800 a bounce is likely.
Yeah I've been anticipating about 7-10% drop, which would bring us to about ~7500-7700. Though I expect more resistance for BTC as it didn't rise as far, has already dropped more, and will see more buying pressure around the 7800 level (as everyone's targeting this range.)

It wouldn't be surprising to see ETH correct more than BTC in the next few days (if we correct)

Nice find though and thanks for the heads up!
Thanks, good looks. Been paying close attention to BTC's OBV and that trend being broken was something I heavily considered when I did my initial sell above 9k. BTC has been in a downtrend on OBV since but has recently started to go relatively sideways (still hasn't broken the OBV "resistance" trendline though), hadn't thought to check ETH's.
The ETHBTC pair is showing bear div on the 4hr, while BTCUSD is showing bull div. Thus far ETH has pull BTC up during this entire rally. It's quite possible BTC now becomes the leader. I traded my ETH for BTC at the .08497. No doubt if BTC dumps, ETH will dump much harder. 
alternatively, most ETHers are traders, and they'll trade back into Bitcoin as ETH starts crashing 

frankly this thing can go up, down, sideways, so just relax, lube up, and let Bitcoin do its thing
"Healthy correction. We are in a bull-market."
I'm going insane and I'm short. For anyone who's long right now, sincerely, good luck. Who knows, maybe shorters will be the one's who end up getting burned on this. It's still early yet. 
Probably because Chewy said he was closing his.
What indicators are those? Custom?
I don't know, the dips are being bought up really fast, it's getting increasingly harder to force it down I'd say, I don't think the cost of forcing it down would be worth it.

By that they mean the source code, not on top of the actual network.

Anyone who thinks these public companies will pay (a lot) to use a network they could literally build out in-house, for pennies, is a total fool.

It's why I said the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance was a joke and it boosting the price of ETH was retarded.

These are *open source protocols and code bases*. Why the fuck would I (a company) *pay* for something posted on the internet for *free*?
BGD?
Bounces are weak because of MACD. We’re negative on most time frames. Usually it means we need big volume. I think the volume gets the bots buying.
Price is the consensus. I know there are tons of bots, but bots are created by human afterall, and it's never fair.
I’m basically sitting 50/50 with my fiat on a limit buy in the 7850 range and a stop buy in the 8600 range. I think if 8000 falls enough stops will be triggered to push us down the the 7800s, but I expect strong support in that range. The 8600 stop is so high because I just don’t trust these random wicks we’ve been seeing. Just trying to be patient and let the trade come to me at this point. 
This has been going on for a while. The only notable movements are BGDs or BRDs
I've got all sorts of conflicting data: https://www.tradingview.com/x/jX66RfZB/  

Green lines are a descending triangle that seems to be dying out as a formation.   
Yellow lines are an ascending channel and/or bearflag on larger timeframes.  
Purple is an ascending triangle if you cut the intentional malicious stop hunting wicks.  
Blue is longer-term support-turned-resistance.  

It's a huge mess. 8450 short is a decent position, as is 8200 long. I have a very small long from 8280 on Sept futures (currently @ 8480), but profit is negligible due to size.  I'm not even really counting it as an open position. It might actually add up to something if we break back over 9K haha. 
Market manipulators found a new technique: stops triggering. 
Kraken would be the safest. You can use BitMex but the servers are absolute garbage and you have to use a VPN, ( BitMex doesn’t allow US citizens ). 

So I would recommend Kraken, they also have USD instead of tether.

Bbands are Boilingerbands. When they are tight, it shows there hasn’t been a large movement in either direction.

Bbands can be loose on a 30 minute chart because the range shot up 100-200$ in a 30 minute time frame, but can be tight in a 4 hour time frame because in 4 hours frame, the range hasn’t moved that much.

You can view them on trading view under indicators under “ Bbands”
So you're saying that at maximum BTC dominance is the optimal moment to buy alts, and best time to switch back is at minimum btc dominence?  (sorry your sentence somehow confuses me a bit)

Man that's so simple and now I realize obvious, too bad I never considered that when trying to figure out how to manage my alts, thanks.
lol that sell wall
They very well could take that approach. But it's a problem that compounds significantly if the market doesn't bounce off $7,800.
got pulled(for now)
Wall pulled or eaten? What the hell is going on here lol
That would be merciful of BTC. Cruel would be Recurring Barts/wicks of multiple thousands. 
Why would it be cruel?  BTC price appreciation is all but certain.  Traders might be able to knock it around for a long period of time but they only have so much power.  They can spread FUD all day, everyday but just like bulls they will have their comeuppance.  The probability is shifting that bulls are more likely to be right than bears by a large degree.  Faith will be rewarded in a growing market.  And ultimately user and network growth is what determines the price of bitcoin.  Traders are ants in the scope of this thing they only look powerful because fud creates short term victory for them because market prices have movement above and below intrinsic value for sustained periods of time.  
Status quo levels of cruelty
Moving averages are pretty awful indicators when the price has been ranging heavily though. Like, that particular one crossed up when we were over 9.8k, and crossed down when we had just finished bouncing to 7.5k (so I guess the next day on that one was pretty red - still, close to the local bottom).
And last one was followed by a bgd
More like Atlas
One must imagine Sisyphus happy.
well, for one, it just seems too much like a foregone conclusion that we will go there. so, knowing this, if there is someone who wants to accumulate at these levels then doing so right around $8k would be ideal since the sell pressure from everyone expecting $7,800 will be immense. not saying this is what is happening or will happen, just a possibility.
Why do you think we'll go under it "this time"?    We could easily bounce to $8500 or $8700 and then move back down in a few weeks.  I personally think more bad news will pound the price lower eventually, but under 8K in the next few days is far from assured, although certainly significant probability of that happening.   

You are talking about a drop of about 2% from here, in a bear trend, so certainly a good chance.  I would not open a big long here for sure.
I, for one, welcome the MOAB

I’ll also give a serious response. I honestly think we’re going to chop in about a $500 range for the next weeks up to a month. 
I've always wondered what a nun's snatch would be like. Either stupendously tight, a vag only God could have made. Or something messier than Princess Di's backseat.

I don't see a middle ground here 
Down

*Edit - the denial is still here, downvotes incoming hahaha, one day you will wake up to what has been happening around you
It might for a while.. 
Which support ?
Cant even set SL orders or anything... 3 minutes to go!
Yea the amount of scaremongering is pretty funny. Lots of people were talking about how a correction to *at least* low $8ks, preferably mid $7ks would be 'healthy' while we were moving up -- but now that the correction is happening, suddenly it's the end of days and we're going to $3k again. 
Sentiment isn't bearish. 66% of 158 people on this sub think we'll see $10001 before $5999.

https://strawpoll.me/15717650/r

If you're saying people predicting sub $7.8k before a bounce is bearish...aren't you...being bearish?? 
>  I'm not sure if I understand why the sentiment is so bearish

Just guessing, but could be the market just dropped from $10K to below $8K in the last two weeks.  And also from $20K in the last few months.  That could be part of it.

But yes, there is probably strong support at $3K, so we should be bullish here.

No
like an extreme version of equity vs fixed income ratios, where the %age of your portfolio invested in equities should be ~(100-“your age”)%
This choppy market will make sure that my stack gets decimated as per your description. 
The people panicking are either over invested or simply don't have the mindset for speculating in an emerging asset class.
where the fuck was i 4 years ago DAMN
Didn't you make the argument en route to 10k that RSI matters very little when the overwhelming belief is that something will happen? Further downside seems to mirror that scenario in reverse 
Is this more because you closed your short at 8K and wanted to get an entry before there was no entry to get? Or do you think you'd have flipped short to long if you were still holding (as I am). I'm not sure this is going to bounce that hard, given the way we got here. Obviously could be wrong. 
Higher low in the making from 6000? :D

See my comment below. I'm on the same page as you.
What's your target?
I would have expected a bounce to have reacted to the low RSI by now.  The more it meanders here the more it cools.  Maybe more stairs to take down.
> maybe the real fair price of bitcoin is just like 8k~

That one's rolled out whenever X price sticks for a few days. Soon it'll be extremely unfair for someone. 
[deleted]
Yup, we are in this really boring phase of the market thinking 82** is too cheap and is instantly bought up but anything in 84** is too expensive and must be sold down.

One side will give out sooner or later, just hope for all of our sanity that it is sooner rather than later.
If they could just allow us to cancel our orders / market-close our positions, a few minutes before actual trading resumes... yeah, that'd be great.
!long XBTUSD add 8015 10%

bouncing off 8k again
Moment of truth, short term for the bears - can we hold below 8k for a four hour close below?
I’ll be buying some more tomorrow 
I jumped from heavy Eth to heavy BTC at 0.084.  Very happy with my BTC gains (170%) from trading Eth over the last month or so from 0.06  
On your first chart i see a potential big bart forming. Anyone else?
good eye on the support! 
!long xbtusd close 8250


Got stopped out overnight. Set stops a bit close but it looks like even if I had set them just under 8200 like I had originally planned I would've gotten wicked out.

Starting to get really annoyed. Every trade I open starts off really well and ends poorly - if I had just been scalped my past few trades instead of waiting them out I'd be in profit right now. My switch strategies because it seems like no one buying/selling BTC can make up their minds.
As long as you didn't panic on any of the half dozen 1%+ 3m wicks in the last 24 hours. 
Too bad i pay that as fees (leveraged), so i'd be working to give profits to the exchange... No thanks
lol sounds like a true achievement mate no joke. haha.
Could be smart if you think the next significant movement is going to be large and violent. If it is, Mex gonna be ded.
Its gonna wick and stop you out. Rly hard to determine when to close anything right now. Just wait it out until the market decides a direction. Theres gonna be plenty of time to make a fuckton of money with a lot less risk. Just ask yourself if you want to trade or gamble. You dont NEED to always be long or short, flat is fine. Sometimes best
This question comes up a lot, and my sentiment is generally that it's not a great strategy.

That's particularly true in the current climate, as the market has been wicking like crazy in both directions. 

If you had taken this strategy last night at the same price point (~$8,300), you'd still have your long open, but your short would have been stopped out on the wick to $8,500 on spot.
I went short due to my little analysis below, even though my positions should have 0 influence on anyone decisions 

It’s way too similar 
I'm doing the same. Long futures, short swaps. I'm starting to think we are going up and I'd like to stay in my long for some time if it were to happen and I don't want to pay the fees.
think of them yesterday's wicks...
Short from the top of this mess and long from the bottom of it would be perfect.  (I had that setup on the 15th, and it finally worked very well after it finally found the next real low on the 16th)

But I wouldn't mess with the center line.
I'm really hating this slow jerky bounce down.  At least before the movements were big and meaningful.  We've calmed down, but we're still trending flat/down for almost a month now.

I don't want a repeat of 2014.  Plz no. :(
Same flip.  Man, the june futures was waaay behind bfx with super high premium for a moment.  Such a big sign and big window of opportunity there.  

Though it ended up restabilizing where my order went through at 8250 anyway heh.
I think you all took a loss for nothing but we'll see.
Just bailed too. Gonna yolo flip short pray for me.
Holy s#!tsnacks.

!long XBTUSD close 8225

!short XBTUSD 8225 5X 25%
Why on earth you would go long is actually mind boggling 
Just wait.
When i was trading btc/eur there i felt like the only person amongst thousands of bots, so i left and went to the bitmex casino instead.
nope, $49.42MM for me too
7.3 k last 24 hr or something so yeah nobody traded there almost.
6.5k BTC, so around $50mm.
Good luck and sorry. :(
I totally agree although it's nice to see some users changing their display name to [not giving away [coin]]. It's so nice that they're doing this, in fact, that I've decided to celebrate by giving away 500 ETH to all my closest crypto friends. PM me for details.
*renting
you mean the volatility of Bitcoin is falling while the volatility of Ethereum is rising?

Because to see that one is falling/rising vs the other, observing the ratio would do
Am I totally cocking things up again or does the graph of ethereum only go till Dec 13th 2017?
toit like a toiger
Hella tight
Yep.
I'm using a bot on the top 30 volume ETH pairs \(with the exception of the other base coins against ETH\) and my buying has been crap. Nothing but bag city around here.  Then again I'm using RSI as primary indicators as opposed to bollinger bands... might need to tweak my settings.
Long from 8159

Good luck to us 

Edit: closed my positions at break even
Nice try polishing this turd
If 7.8k really is taken down with strength, there's a really good chance we're going to revisit 6ks again.  

Note that I did say with strength as in a BRD, chop is fine and expected, I like price consolidation at this level while daily MACD starts to bottom into next week.
Seriously, even 10$ swings have me on the edge of my seat with a "is this it?" mindset

EOS?
The seeds of a future butter...
I remember saying the same thing in the distant past after buying enough at $1k to ruin my gains from $10 after the price got back to $200.  Spent enough at $300~600 to break even and now I am holding a pittance of the former stack, and have been buying again from 2k to 16k.
There are a lot of bagholders like you in this market and a lot of them are thinking the same thing as you. That is why the price needs to go a lot lower before a possible recovery.
what's your breakeven??
Why let this price move a little bit downward influence your total involvement in BTC?  BTC is a legitimate form of investing.  Buy buying btc you are offering the service of providing liquidity to someone who wants or needs to sell.  Liquidity is a significant part of the ultility of btc and as liquidity increases so will the ultility and price of of btc.
[deleted]
No you aren't.  Or maybe you are if you already have a limit buy order in for that price.  

Otherwise, the market conditions can change and you will change your mind.   I sure won't buy at $7800 unless it seems like the smart move at that time...right now doesn't mean anything.
Ok so you mean you are staying out of position then ...
If you’re going to go long in this weird range.. $7800 is probably the only place you won’t need a prayer. It’s the safest bet 
I'm long at $8900 :/
Not quite yolotrades or YRuafraid level of hopium, but good points nonetheless. Personally I'm still waiting for the non-bitcoin creepto markets to fully implode before buying btc again, but I gotta admit it's getting tiring and I'm starting to feel a bit impatient. 
>Through their delusion

Lost me here. Man, framing this as an "us vs them" thing is not conducive to a great discussion or seeing the market clearly to me. I'm long btw.
> A stable price for 30 straight days

You call 8K to 9.8K to 8.6K to 9.6K to 8.7K to 9.9K to 8K in 30 days stable? What are you on? We're down 20% in 11 days.
This post just screams cognitive dissonance.
Incoming "stupid delusional permabull hopium get rekt" memes. Don't forget you're not allowed to say anything bullish in here when the price is going down!

But I'm bullish too in the mid- and long-term because of all the positive news lately, even though we're dropping in price. IMO the market is still tormented by PTSD and will be for some time. But the general attitude towards bitcoin and crypto in the world is more positive and constructive than ever and the tech is still moving forward as always. The SEC, financial institutions and companies are finally treating crypto with way more respect, especially when comparing to early 2017.
You realize people are using square...not for bitcoin, right?

They use it for cash. You could probably go check the ratings before btc was added to it to see that 
What about the part of the story where the Bear eats up all of the "micro buyers" on his way to Goblintown ? 
You forgot the third kind of bear:

3) Has a fuckton of money and is willing to lose it just to drive the price of Bitcoin down.

Those are the ones that really make me happy because they're just sealing their own fate and making the rest of us rich doing so.

Bulls just testing the waters. If it holds around here they can start going long. This could be just a tiny DCB from shorts closing and longs opening
I think you are doing it backwards
*spins roulette wheel*
lol haven't you been calling for sub 8k for the past week?
Now then now then, as Jimmy Saville would say... :-O
What’s ever crazier is it happened around 130-230 PM EST Tome last Thursday, we are nearly exactly a week later five or take an hour
That's a bit premature, but in any case we're in a better position to retest 10k now than last time. If that ever happens. I'm completely agnostic atm, but bullish for some alts.
$11.7k is a pretty hefty target, man. It's not really the same as it  was before- we now have insane resistance thru $9k range. 

Keep in mind that this entire run up started from a massive short squeeze and we are now 2% above where that short squeeze ended. 

You're relying on another move like that when there simply isn't any fuel for one. 

If anything, people long on bitmex futures are prone to being  squeezed. September still at a $150 premium despite the fact that we have gone sideways and down for weeks now 

Also, $11.7k from here is a 40% move up...that's the same as moving down to $5900 from here
> $11,700. Would anyone be that surprised if we popped up over the next couple of weeks to around that level? Exactly. 

Delusional
"However, I can't shake the feeling that this all could just be accumulation before an eventual retest of $11,700. Would anyone be that surprised if we popped up over the next couple of weeks to around that level? Exactly."

Well me for one, I would be extremely surprised, the delusions here get scarier by the day.
If we spring back up now it would definitely be a strong argument that we are in a giant ascending triangle 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/GO4gzyB7/
 
I don't trade based on my "feelings" and while I would not be that surprised if we were at $11,700, I be even less surprised if we are at $7000....because that is much more likely (based on the chart, not conspiracy theories or fantasies)

And I trade on probabilities and that is why I have a short position right now.
This year it's more like "Sell in may, then rebuy for a 2-3% loss a few days later - then resell for a further 2-3% loss a few days after that"
In traditional markets yes, in Bitcoin terms May was February.
Yep, just like last year we all should have sold in May and went away until December, too.
“Sell in May, moon in June”.
We'll know in June. 
Sell in May and stay so you can keep selling some more
Yes November until April is always bullish.  Specifically, January is the most bullish month and has its own [wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_effect).  It's right when it's right and wrong the rest of the time.  [Here](https://www.astrology.com/horoscope/daily/taurus.html) is another good reference if you're into seasonal predictions that are right when they're right and wrong the rest of the time.
BBands are stupid tight across multiple timeframes. 

I'm not sure the market could withstand another strong push down to $8,200 without sinking lower. 

Although, I'd have said the same thing at least twice within the last 24 hours and been wrong!
I mean, lets be fair to them, its one thing to get fucked because you made the wrong call, its quite another to get fucked because the exchange went down 
bought my first at 100 USD, which are sold by our dear trustee for 10k, unfortunatly I lost 80&#37;, fortunatly it was fucking easy to trade on Empty Gox that time and I trippeled my Bitcoins in the crazy up and down collapse, I want this volatlity back! what we see now is peanuts trading without leverage.
My target is more down, until the market convinces otherwise.  I don't know how you pick "targets", because a drop to $7800 over two weeks is a lot different than a drop to $7800 over two hours.  Also $7800 via $8700 is different than via $7000.  

Anyway I just added to my short here, because broke uptrend line from around $8120.
Rising wedge looks forced/ too steep/ like an upside down snow cone 
8500 -> 8200 again -> 9000... then we decide if more bull or bear 
I think it will bounce off 8k at the falling wedge and then retest 8.4 at the trend line where I expect it to fail and then go into the 7's. Longing at just above 8k

https://www.tradingview.com/x/6rVGqtwl/
Going to be overloaded as everyone market dumps same time. Candle is going to be huge. Probably hit 8000. Maybe even lower
Too many possible ways to draw support lines.  We broke out of this one: https://imgur.com/PLYZtba

Not buying that steeper wedge you have though.
Lol, sounds pretty funny.  "Hold on, it'll come, hold on, yep, yep, ok, it's going up, alright, there it is, yes, yes, oh shit....ok, I'm done."

Rule 2: This is what my BTC trading sounds like.
Pornstars actually might be the most easily satisfied women since they are hyper sexual and can tell you exactly what they want. It’s the prude uptight ones you gotta watch out for. 
I've been much more bullish when I saw +5% a day for a week or so
that bounce needs some blue diamond shaped pills before we get all bullish and riled up

Thanks for posting. But eth ratio can go down to 0.055 and not be a new low...

even if eth tanks to $450 (the target of that) btc could be $8181 with a 0.055 ratio.

But yes it's very likely if eth dumps btc will too. 

Also. His reply to the tweet is hilarious.

LOOOOOL
Thats such a juicy pattern, if it plays out pain will be unreal
I don't listen to a word that man says. He calls out H&S even more than this sub does, and he's wrong more often than not.
deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.1463  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/48507)
I see this quite often in here so it's probably worth saying: H&S is a trend reversal pattern.  Down from here would be bearish continuation (on the 1 hour chart) so the pattern isn't valid.  What you posted is just a bear flag that has broken down into a big 'h' shape.  It is not uncommon for them to do this before they validate.

EDIT: what you're after would be a inverted cup and handle.  This is a continuation pattern that would fit at the bottom of a bear flag.  There is a chance we're making the handle with this mini bounce.
That's also very descending triangle ish.
Arent we expecting a bounce or two off of 8k before heading down to 7.8k and beyond?
The only real truthful answer is no one knows.
Nobody knows that, they are just trying to justify their gamble with meaningless charts.
You don't find the sarcasm during the doom stages.  
as long as 7800 holds it's mostly fine.

The market went total berserk on the run towards the Futures market for BTC last Winter. Over-leveraged investors and Fomo'ers made the market go irrational and overshoot. We are just still correcting from that and we will most probably go much lower. These cycles need to play itself out. Not even CNBC shilling crypto and BTC every single day on mainstream media, banks starting to embrace Blockchain and Hedge funds trying to addopt it and not even Conferences like Consensus, with all the new announcements are  going to stop the price from bleeding towards more realistic levels. This is still a experimental tech that cannot even scale to like 120000 transactions per min.  required to fulfill all the processes of every day life wroldwide, and here are some  People are already taking and  treating this like it has already accomplished all of that.  There is still a long way to go for Fundamentals to make it possible for price to go to new ATH. 
Just DCA for long term, and you will be fine. 
Nobody can see the future but you can look at the events going on. And if consensus news and the major announcements over the last month  mean anything at all, there is hundreds of millions if not billions flowing into companies and projects in this space. Probably more so than any other time in the history of crypto. That being said markets can be irrational for along time in either direction so...
To me the dumping looks kind of weak. I don't expect a huge drop. A slow bleed is possible.
Can confirm, BTC is screwed. 
If your investment horizon is long term you have nothing to worry about. 
we are still ~~20x~~, ~~19x~~, ~~18x~~, ~~17x~~, ~~16x~~, ~~15x~~, ~~14x~~, ~~13x~~, ~~12x~~, ~~11x~~, ~~10x~~, ~~9x~~, ~~8x~~, 7.9x from where we were before the bull run
#neverchangechad
I don't know why anyone would expect consensus to have any effect on BTC prices. 

Anyone paying to attend a crypto expo is already well aware of what's happening in the space. It's not like it's going to cause a bunch of noobs to FOMO in.
Consensus has only caused a substantial pump once, it's been pretty flat for some weeks after it in previous years 
Walking a tightrope right now, both either side is really decisive so far... 

Edit: Screw it I'm getting impatient. I'll go to the gym, stuff always happens in the market when I'm away from the charts. 
Remember about 7.5? I member. Because I felt unsecure I moved my stop up and got wicked just before the 1000$ dildo that would have made me rich. If you have a conviction, and afaik the 1D doesn't lie, play without stops imo.

(Note that I don't like the btc 1D much but eth looks good)
I opened a long at 8250 as well and will be doing this, but I'm wary of wicks and might set stops a tad lower.

I'm keeping an eye on the 7.8k level since that's where the 0.618 Fib of the move from 6.4-10k is at. I believe we'll have some form of a bounce there. That said, it all feels a bit too similar to March where I was looking for a bounce after the 11.7k rejection. We bounced off a few levels but failed to make higher highs. 

If we do bounce but fail to breach 10k I'm afraid we'll be visiting 6.8-7k since that's where the line from 6 Feb and 1 April brings us. 
When the group that has been market selling thousands of btc this past couple week runs out they will buy back in and there is a lot less resistance going up than down in the order books.
I'm still waiting for 5k.
Tens of thousands would have to dumped to even make it to 7800-7900
$3k, pentaruhdi masterluk prediced it, so it is only way to recover... we must visit $3k otherwise we will never see another bullrun!
The FUDmaestro with zero credibility has spoken. Better sell all you holdings. 
bad bot
you remind me of Duschkushman or whatever his name is , he predicted sub 5k and after that BGD he just vanished 
haha nice life x
[deleted]
I posted something similar yesterday, but using the low from March of last year (and log scale), and it ends up very close to where we are now.  

I'm not really convinced that it's a "very important" TL yet.  But, it's something to keep an eye on.

EDIT: Zoomed in view...it's right around the 8100 level the way I have it drawn.

we are at the precipice. Either 9k with hella bullish confidence or we buying property in goblin town hoping for bull gentrification 
There is heavy resistance @8500. Seems too soon to go test 9K.

Because of a short squeeze. It was the perfect storm. It’s not something that you should expect. 
More like in 1 hour
It's not us vs them. Markets will fluctuate. You should be aware of all movements so you can trade better.

Stacy is now into bears. Sorry Chad.
I'ma bear... grrrrrr!!! 
> but I didn’t close it, because I believed in the coin and the future of it.

> I won’t be happy if this falls just like that, it will break my faith in the technology

I don't think you should let the price of the day affect your confidence in the tech.

And be honest, you didn't close it for the sake of more gains, not because of faith in tech.  The faith was the rationalization for keeping a bet open.

Dude, if you believe in the technology, you don't think like this.  You pull your damn coins into cold storage and you hunker down for the bear market.

I've had my investments be down 80% from high more than once in Bitcoin.  Shit goes up.  Shit goes down.  Right now we're in a bear market.  Wake up smell the fear.  But if you believe in the technology, you make a long term plan and you stick to it, not some leveraged gambling drama.
Because the price goes down it breaks your faith in the technology? Sheesh, the price of the coin has very little to do with the technology.  The price is mostly driven by pure speculation as of today.  The underlying tech doesn't change whether it is worth $\`1 or $100,000.

Once we see heavy adoption that will be a true indicator of price.
use stops lol
> I believed in the coin and the future of it. I still believe in this in the long term.

Same here.  So far it hasn't let me down but sometimes you have to wait.  I'm looking to buy this dip.  Haven't decided at what price.  We're not at the bottom of this dump quite yet.  You could get liquidated, but I doubt it.  

In any case, don't be sad.  Bitcoin goes up and Bitcoin goes down, but over time it goes up.




[deleted]
7400 is just a 7% drop from here. 

You are way over-leveraged 
Why would you sell your cold storage  
now when it is projected to be much higher by year end?  Dangerous advice 
Comments like this make this thread worth its weight in gold. Good on you man. Thanks for the reminder. 
The entire world doesn't live in the US
It is accurate in terms of how orders execute and also how they are processed by the API is that is how you interact with the exchange. So, a great way for testing an execution system and for working out the different order types and what they do.

However, price movement and action is unusual and markedly different to the actual live market.
$1m is a huge stretch, come on man...

That said, I don't think Draper is too far off with $250k

Maybe there should be a Draper-watch website...?
Ouch, your browser got into some abusive loop an you got IP banned.  Should clear up in one hour.  You should tether up your phone to change IP and make a ticket with support in the meantime.
Well our giant wedge on the 4H just bursted through the bottom 
Yup
the 19to20utc candle, yes.
Why should this play out this way?
we haven't had any mt. gox desaster yet
This is ***drastically unrealistic***. The amount of people who are invested in the space or interested in investing in the space (btc and crypto in large) is easily 100s if not 1,000s of times larger than back in 2014. I could write a 50 page thesis on the subject, but I won't. This takes into account literally zero non-quantitative factors. 
Oh lord I hope not because my bags’ll be too heavy at that point 

2021 is another universe.  It is beyond the singularity as far as crypto is concerned.  What do you think the odds are that BTC will be $200,000 on in 2021?  I would say around 1-5%.
A lot of our recent moves have happend in the next couple hours of the day
Looks roughly valid to me: https://www.tradingview.com/x/YbHrdVQe/  

After the number of attempts sellers had to dump through 8200 yesterday and were unable to (and I was one of them), a big pop upward here wouldn't surprise me. 
My problem is, depending on which wicks I ignore, I can end up with an ascending triangle, a symmetrical triangle, or an ascending channel.  Sitting out until there's a more clear picture of wtf is going on....which probably means a pretty boring day for me today.
Haha I like your optimism.
hodling my short for now
holding on. betting we'll range between $7800-8200 for a bit unless we dump through. I'll hold my short until like $8600 though so keep that in mind 
I  actually have no clue what to do right now . Short from CA of 8250.

Current stops at break even.


I didn't get to close sub 8K, so I'm holding. Set stops half way between current and entry. 
Too bad it's doing neither at the moment. 
Market hodlers are different from regular hodlers, we buy/sell at the start and End of bear/bull cycles and ignore everything else in between. Might take longer to make bank, but God is it less stressful 
Well, good traders do.  Many of the hodlers would go broke quickly if they tried to trade.  Their only chance is to hold, and they already hit the lottery if they bought low enough.  I'm not sure why anyone would keep holding past $20K and $10K again, but I'm more of a trader type anyway.   And yes, nice not to be helpless and at the mercy of the market.
I've said this before many times but US citizens aren't allowed access to anywhere that you can short. We have very little choice but to be long and hodl. I'm sure there are risky exchanges and covert ways to participate, but by and large trading is rigged against us.

Everyone stopped talking about bitcoin because when before they were making huge sums of money, they just arnt anymore. No one wants to talk about losing money. Its as simple as that. 
ATM fees are very high compared to exchanges. 
The "long gone days" you are lamenting lasted for about 3-4 weeks in total, at the top of a year+ long bull run. 
I hope it's sideways!
8k was a beefy level. Not sure anything in the upper 7k can hold it back.

Target is 6.9 to 7.1k though, based on the last two bottoms.
*rekt
Can cancel but not post though
Oh shit, people can't trade? That's going to ruin some people's  month if this keeps going down. :(
Then 6k after that. Then 5k. Then 4k. Then 3k...
With the second double bottom you have on stoch rsi didn't the price fall of heavily afterwards? The first one also doesn't really imply a runup. I think you're possibly looking for confirmation bias on this; by its nature as 2 degrees away from price the stoch gives a lot of false signals.

Edit: lining it up better, yeah, looks like the first two preceded a couple days of a DCB.
>24k soon -u/myusernameiforgot


Because you said nothing to back up anything you said. This sub generally downvotes gut calls unless it's from someone that's been around a very long time.
Why? Because of the bear market? It's certainly up there with the best of the crypto world, technologically....
[deleted]
>Alt pump precedes BTC pumps

I remember alts pump in December but don't remember BTC pump after or during that...
Keep dreaming. !RemindMe 1 week
>a downtrend for at least one or two years

How did you come up with these numbers?
A piano is not a lambo. You're doing it all wrong
I think 8200-8250 is really the key. That's part of why I opened long here. We're right at the bottom of a pattern that could break back up to 8350. If we break under 8200 at this stage, I don't see 8100 stopping us from going sub 8K. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/xg1sYIZJ/
https://www.tradingview.com/x/xg1sYIZJ/
We could also remain at 8.2-8.4 for weeks, so people desperate about seing their investment grow sell into smart money, this is how bull runs start. At that point it's anyone guess really. What is certain is that there are some massive shorts that will be competing to close at some point. But also a lot of longs. Check your bias, we all have one.
Man just props to citral and hauserfield for earnestly replying. This analysis is so clearly from a noob that I wish there was a feature to block comments from some usernames automatically
Damn, man I’m bearish right now too, but your posts are just outright depressing. What’s your point in all of them?
"Severe drop, sub $8.2k" - ha.  What's severe about that?
Why do you even waste your time writing this nonsense 
I take it you’re all in on a short then at high leverage? Sounds like amazing odds you’ll make loads of money.
I believe this market is running out of weak hands, but not of speculators yet, and you just prove that point.
Oki nice perspective, guess we'll see. 

Edit: I don't see why you're getting downvoted so hard, I think this is your most thought through post all day. I don't really agree with it very much, but if that's how you feel that's fine. 
Chill out Chad. 
Bags getting heavy ??
That was when a lawyer was selling off coins
Dude, 0.01% of 150.000 is 15 $. thats pretty simple math.

and it is not a $ amount, it is a BTC amount. Future gains (or losses) with the price included.

There are some nice lending bots around, just google. If you want to spread your risk maybe add poloniex or quoinex.



Not even slightly worth it at those percentages. They barely beat out interest rates from bank holdings.
Balance after 1 day = principal amount * (1 + [interest rate/100])

Therefore, 1 BTC becomes 1*(1+[0.01/100]) = 1.0001 BTC

18 BTC will give you .0018 BTC daily. So yes, $15 is about right. Oh yeah, don't ignore compounding because that can become pretty powerful in a few years' time.

Source: am lender


I used to lend tether and btc on bitfinex using the poloniex lending bot but the rates have dried up completely. I still check the rates occasionally and these days it will often be lower than 0.01. No point really.
Nah its just the eos team selling their eth to keep eos propped up.
Eth looking strong

https://www.tradingview.com/x/By2el0DY/
And then it loses its dominance on the rebound. Ratio has been trending up for weeks
Last time btc was at this price, ETH ratio was under 0.07
Feels like it's gonna be a slow grind.
I see the opposite. BTC does not like being down here.
I thought you made a good call here but this bounce is fucking weaksauce
Isn’t the demagoguery the main antagonist in stranger things?
bitcoin markets book club?!
Lol apparently the fudsters come out of the woodwork everywhere. 
We will see hundreds of Barts all the way down to 4000.
looks more like a bear flag/pennant
this right here is why this shit needs to cool off for a while. get rid of the moonbois and restart this baby 
volatility is gone during periods of consolidation...after a period of consolidation the price either takes a massive move down or up and starts zig zagging until it finds a new consolidation point and the pattern repeats itself.

this shit happened before, and it will happen again 
Alts are having a slow and steady growth, not compared to their ATHs but they keep finding higher lows. Bitcoin is moving sideways. Bears and bulls have been burned too many times to risk any serious position. Wicks, BGDs, BRDs, barts... These kill incentive to trade. People constantly got stop hunted, have to manually watch their positions, eventually it becomes so stressful they will just cash out or put in cold storage.
>we will never see anything go up 5-10x again

!remindme 1 year

is bitcoin 40k? Why yes it is
> CryptoCurrency is fucking stagnant now. 

"now" as in the last 5 minutes?  The market has had crazy volatility lately...over the past few days/weeks/months.  I don't know how you can say it is stagnant.  Yes the volume is low, but that's usually the case between market manipulation bullshit.  It was like that all last year too.

But yes you are probably right that we won't see BTC go up 5-10 times from current levels. Of course if it drops to $1000, then 5x could be possible.

And the reason for anyone to push the price up is the same reason they did it last year...to profit.   Both pumps and dumps can be profitable to those with the power to manipulate and move the market.
WE HAVE A WINNER!
Took you guys long enough to show up. 
Your bags. Their weight?
Wow you must be really dumb to believe that.
Upvoted for somewhat true. The crypto market wants to be bullish but btc prevents it, it's a fact nothing else.
:'( be nice to me, it hurts.
Oh yeah, I 'member!
2 weeks ago the price was lower than the current price.
Signal on the 3/4hr is more reliable. If we can hold above 8k we are in good shape and daily close at or above 8200 would be a very good sign for the bulls. 

The sell volume wasn't all that strong here and it was followed up by a good ammount of buying. 

Sub 8k stops got sweeped and we probably just reached peak fear for normies. Very possible a bounce is around the corner. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/a9MuAi2G/
you are doing it wrong
Cya in a month 
Thanks for the heads up I guess?
You sound too emotional. A really important trading lesson: the market doesn’t care about you, me, anyone or anything. 

I hope you aren’t too over invested, my friend.

Edit: spelling
Yea 80% sell volume comprised of mostly 1 minute huge market sell candles vs 20% buy volume is really propping up the price.
I sincerely doubt they have any preexisting plan in place for what to do in this kind of situation.

They're probably running around trying to answer that question as we speak.
why hidden there and announced here with such fanfare?
it got below $8,000(a support point that held for weeks)...you better believe this isn't over
The classic:: **I told you so**

You  so smart! Can i sub to your YouTube channel? 


I don't know on what planet you live. 1H rsi is almost at 30, stoch rsi near 0, mfi pointing up. So, so overbought!
Dude, it's been like 30 minutes
Why 8400 ? did you bought at 8400?
if it goes up, bears feel pain

if it goes down, bulls feel pain

if you comment senseless one-liners, we all feel pain 
Maybeee because a lot of them are trading with money they can't afford to lose as it would affect their standard of living?
Hodling paper is scary ;__;

No matter how fast the price raises I know the price is still to low and it bugs me to sell even if I believe it to be a local high
Pure mic drop stuff there! Halfway through I wasn't sure I was going to be in full agreement... but the way you put the final pieces together... it made me buy in completely to your compelling and implacable logic. Surely the Newton of our times.
Lol go home bro you're drunk. 
This is the dumbest thing I have read on the internet today.
I'm amazed at how high sentiment is right now. It's genuinely confusing. 
This bubble is just getting started. They wouldn't invest if crypto wasn't going to go huge into the trillions. 
In late 2015 everyome and their mother claimed Apple was in a bubble and shorted the crap out of it. It crashed... a little
Institutions did not invest in tech in the last 17 or 18 years...??

I had no idea!  They really missed out then didnt they?
Rule 1. This was pretty egregious. Starting you off with 7 days. Next ban is for 31 days.
Rule 3
[removed]
I caught 8750-8300 all-in at 10x short and 8650-8500 all-in 10x short, and in both cases I was on June futures and had the premium drop in my favor as well. The first one was massive. The stops yesterday hurt, because it wasn't even a bad position or bad call long/short. It was just stop hunting to a level I haven't seen in rapid succession. 
I've never so much as looked at the troll box, and I probably never will.
What was that tree guy's quote again?

"most of the people in this market have half the witts of your average moron?" 

Pretty on point I gotta say, also when I read the shit on twitter. 
Also could see the market just cutting through 7800 like it doesn't exist, considering so many people believe it to be support.
Anecdotally it feels like you should add $200 to whatever anyone expects. Wish there could be some data behind this
Resistance at 8,600\-8,650? The one which might break us from bearish trend?
Can you show me what your wedge looks like? 
I'm debating between re-drawing that line, or ignoring the wick if the daily closed at a point within the formation. Either way feels a little dirty.
Why not a larger bear flag? Using the top of the wicks as guide.
Because it was 3 am for me. 
We need something like a spread against a target ~~price~~ uptime percent.

I just walked away that day, it was a shitshow.
It wasn’t even looking hard. It was literally standing right in front of me and it was 1000% way too obvious. 


So nobody should buy? Got it. 
It is if you hodl.
^ 1,000 times. 

And it's happening in a micro-sense right this moment. 

Buyers are lining up and stalling the breakdown. But they'll most likely stop the frenzy the moment there's the slightest hint of resistance back up at $8,230. 
Sadly I think this is the way the markets MUST go.  Concepts are sticky (memes!), and the meme for all of 2017 was "Buy the Dip!"  And it **worked then.**

So now there's a lot of people still in this mode, but the market as a whole has changed.  More and more of them need to give up and be patient for the bear market to run it's course.  Then we can find the bottom faster and not have a repeat of 2014. :/
I dont get it, what is going on? 
Summary: everyone is short term bearish Af but medium term bullish. 

So expecting a bounce off 7800? 
Once again your timing with these polls is impeccable 
Everyone's not gonna bail at 7800.  We were at 6600 a month ago.

Honestly, if this bottoms above 7500, it's bullish AF.  We have a higher high from 9000 (3/22) to 9800 (5/3) and a higher low from 6600 (4/9ish) to 7500(?) tomorrow.  That's a nice upward swing any way you cut it.  And if you insist on drawing your line from December 17, well, I can only tell you that all those little spikes end up looking very small over time.
My thoughts exactly whilst I do suspect we get some minor form of rally sooner or later I think we will retest the lows 
Flaccid penis formation confirmed.

Lol, that's savage.
Same. I think I cancelled all my orders just before it went down. I think...
dont refresh

In which direction?
Cash isn't their problem.
 
They do over 3 billion dollars in trade a day, their daily profit after expenses is still mind blowing.
It does more volume in a month than some second-tier global exchanges which employ a 100 people.


They have a legacy matching engine that struggles to auto-deleverage on scale, and changing that might mean changing things from the ground up on the back end, and doing all that without losing a shred of data, coins or uptime is a real challenge. 
Top engineers at exchanges make over 300,000USD and those roles are still hard to fill. 

So 1. they don't need the money 2. they're throwing money at it but the fix is hard. 
You make valid points all around. Might be worth setting tight stops after all. Another leg down could move a ways.
Yeah but then again the move at 1pm GMT went clean through the 15min band and bounced back like it was on springs 
I do, thanks. I'm willing to hold this one potentially through a trip sub 8k. Low leverage and low stack % for the initial entry. 

Thanks for the tip on the BBands. Wasn't watching them closely. 
And the 30 min, and the 1hr.
Thanks!
Looks like chop is back on the menu unfortunately 
I believe this is more of a symmetrical triangle with a fake out to 8480.
The lines fit a lot better than in an ascending triangle. This could go on tightening range for 12h or more (although i don't think it will last that long because it would become too tight).

The apex should be around 8300.

True, I have half a mind to put some stop shorts below 8.1k but I'm very afraid of the wicks. 
I had to go away from the computer like 30 minutes ago so I put in a "oh shit" bailout stop up above 8550.  

Not sure if curse or blessing.
Yes, but otherwise it's interesting to see our algorithmic overlords in action with minimal human interference
You and me both brother.
Where are you short from / where are you place stops when ShitMex opens up? 
Close orders, sure. But not positions. 

We've been through this type of scenario before. But never with an exchange that offers 100x leverage. 

If the price is any more than 3% away from $8,200 when trading resumes, you'd better believe there's going to be a lot of liquidations that wouldn't have occurred had those people been able to monitor their positions. 
I am front running a little, my target was 7890 but I am expecting a huge bounce when we get to that range, I don't want too much slippage plus I don't want taker fees.  This will be a medium term hold (2-3 weeks then re-evaluate) through the daily MACD bottoming starting next week where I believe our pattern should confirm with some upside to 9k minimum. 
building a highly available system is not about money, it’s about past decisions and the ability to either turn back time or figure out a way to mitigate those (bad) decisions going forward.

The only thing the money can offer them is to rebuild the whole thing from scratch. And there is simply no guarantee that they will make all the right decisions the second time around.

The reality is that the best devs in the world don’t care about money and therefore won’t go work for BitMex... Because they work for Google
Maybe everyone is just being really supportive and kind to the bitmex users.

Edit /s
While I don't disagree, we've been going sideways for weeks now. It's very possibly a coincidence 
well last 24h the price has moved like 200-300 so... in both irections
I was able to put them all they way up to 8400 before it crashed. Don't know how safe that is anymore though.
Should be a shitshow when they resume trading if the price isn't more or less precisely where it was when they suspended it.
Popcorn time!
Lawsuits coming up
Me neither. But I don't argue with the market when it respects a trendline. That may happen here. Still too early to call it though.

it could easily become a descending channel with a lower low 
Ya, that guy's going to be in rough shape unless it was a short panic-closing.
Saw this and somehow accidentally shorted swaps instead fml. 
Because it's not a guarantee that the market will return to confirm support-turned-resistance. And the breakdown point is only about 1% above current price. 

It's not really worth it to flip-flop for a 1% gain. 
I see, thank you for explaining this :\)
pretty good summary!
Eth got to 300 recently, after ATHs of 1000+.  I consider that real dumping.
[deleted]
Thanks mate! I am worried about ETH as well...
You can't have a reddit name like that and not be a complete tosser, sorry man!
What an insightful contribution. 
Well, the point is that the price has been pumping or dumping $100+ and then immediately returning to previous levels within a 1m-3m candle. If the move actually stuck, you'd likely be bagholding 
You'd obviously set a stop/flip first. 
Good to know you have standards. 
Meant rejecting the breach. I guess holding 8k or rejecting 79xx.
He's still short, so he doesn't

I'm on futures, so no. Why?
Surprised I very nearly got the top of that bounce. Futures add was 8131 and the top was 8139. 
There are a few supports on this ascending triangle, depending on the slope of the support it is somewhere between 8050-8150. If that bad boy falls, I believe we are looking sub 8k. I'll be looking to ladder down again my Alts when btc is between 7.4-7.8. I primarily trade Alts (simulating leverage) to take advantage of their smaller market caps without paying fees to use leverage. 
Unless this is one of those super frequent times TA doesn't play out, sure. 
Sure. Resistance on the descending triangle is up at 8320. I won't really be concerned until we break and hold over that. 
Well they are partially responsible. The least they could do is show a warning on their website or a countdown.
For them to be in any danger of losing customers, the customers need to have an alternative exchange to go to. Ain't any other casinos in town, so...

> but so many people will lose a lot of money

And go into your hands :/

Bittersweet gains.
Several reasons:

You could think futures premium will go up.

You don't want to pay swaps funding fees.

You don't want to try to open a position during bitmex server overload- closing a position takes priority so having two open is better. 

Maker fees are negative so opening more limit orders could mean more money from that.

Having two positions open is fun, and it makes it easier to stomach the visceral reaction to any red uPnL you see. 
Well sometimes you can get positioned to profit of the next movement and still close the current movement in profit.  But that wouldn't be compatible hedging really, you'd be dcaing into the next counter move.  (Like I've been doing on sept, I'll go as low as 7000 with it)

But even with a hedge if you have a spread where your long is lower and your short is higher, the whole middle zone is green.  If you get a wide range, and there is a bunch of volatility and not clear direction, you can let them both go at optimal times while getting a lot of information about the current movement before committing, rather than having to commit quickly and harshly.
Thank you. It's not a lot for most people here (~0.01 BTC) but it was all I had in my trading account and I'm so fucking pissed, that was like a week's worth of food. I think I'll stop trading or trying to trade for a few weeks. 
I kept hoping it would bump back up... never did 
don’t you mean *my* song?
it's not contrarian at all actually, the polls I posted show that that is largely the majority prediction 
> 68% to 32% of people

of people who voted. 

Size matters.
And what % of traders lose money again? J/k, I appreciate you doing these polls periodically
8001
No idea but higher than my buy in price is fine.
Hey that's a good question... what are your thoughts?
What time frame? I see $30K within 12 months. It will obviously go up and down in the meantime. This dip could take us back to $7k. Seems to be happening in slow motion so I'm not buying just yet.
Long

Because 8400 might be buying a local top with nothing but downside.
Or at least not get brigaded/spammed/bullshat.
Oh sorry I can't see how large it is on mobile. Is it massive? I'll put two pound signs to make it a bit smaller 

C'est mieux maintenant?
Good question. It's a lot of factors -- looking at how the market has behaved historically, looking at short-term and long-term market indicators (especially once you've gauged their win/loss rates in different scenarios), looking at overall flow of funds into crypto, looking at BTC/alt dominance and more than anything trusting my instincts. I spent several years in financial services on the investment side of a top alternative asset management desk and also with a hedge fund. A lot of this is instinct and having a feel for investor behavior in exotic markets.

It's worth noting, I am obviously well aware there's a big divergence in my probabilities -- I believe we're much more likely to see an Uber Bull Case or a Sideways/Bear Case before seeing a "standard run up." I think the market is consolidating at the moment and we will either see a violent move upward or stay range bound.
thank you!

I think you're missing forest for the trees here. Nobody long-term bullish cares about holding up 8k or Bart Simpson's joyous up and down rollercoasters. The 'bulls' are either committed already (sub 7k was a pretty obvious 'buy now' for anyone looking at hodling til the halvening at least), or DCAing their way in and celebrating every move down as an opportunity for cheaper coins.

Any 'bulls' concerned about price here are just scalping longs -- nothing wrong with that, but I wouldn't consider them really 'bullish' in the grand scheme of things.
Unless you are communicating with those whales i have to be skeptical.  Buying at 5-6K seems expensive considering that it might never make it past 7-8K for sometime.  Also is there a strategy of playing the market like that without sacrificing some coins?
I'll reduce the stops to around 7.8/7.9 ish as my orders down to 8.2 get filled.   I just think a quick drop to 8050 from here might trigger panic selling. Maybe not from 8.2 though.
Stops below 7800, it could either go beautifully or horribly wrong.
I guess I'm probably putting too much faith in the falling wedge holding up, but if it fails, I guess 7800 is the logical place to re-evaluate.  (It's also pretty close to the .618 retrace of the run up from 6425 to 9990)
Honestly bro your certainty here makes me bullish. I've always noticed by the time that traders have finally "figured out what will happen next" based on previous cycles, the cycle is already over and something else will happen. Like when the price had crashed after touching the log resistance line 3 times during the correction cycle, I was very certain when I shorted at the log resistance, only for us to blow through at hit 9.99k. 

Right now I see the same in reverse, on each of the last few tops, we had massive crashes. People are looking at the 9.9k top as the same and people are shorting with a lot of certainty. But think about it, I don't believe it will play out so simply, when it has become so obvious. 
Yup. This is the power move 
Makes sense.  Thanks.  I'm still in an analysis paralysis.
or if...
There may be one. I might close it there, but I probably won't. I am worried about one, yes, but I don't want to set a stop down there and unless I'm actively watching it when we get there and it feels bottomish, I'll let it ride.
I might set a 50% take profit at low 7800s and let the rest with stops at break even, if we haven't gotten there by the time I go to sleep and can't monitor it. But right now buyers seem MIA.
[deleted]
Eh Fuck it, if I lose it all I'll probably stop trading for a bit and just hang onto my cold storage coins
Just want to show everyone that people who play with crypto are not die hard virgins 
And if it goes up, my girlfriend will have never seen a penis so small. 
Well he was short so...
Long from $9,478 with 50% of your trading stack at 10x leverage? You're less than 5% away from liquidation. 

How on earth are you comfortable?

EDIT: That's also assuming you are using cross margin. Otherwise you were liquidated awhile ago.
A bit underwater? You're 15% underwater. 
I've come to the conclusion that half of them work for bitmex.
I feel the same way. First time in a long time where I feel calm with an underwater position.
So you've decided to call a drop when we're fully into a movement, then you say you imagine eth will drop more than BTC, well wowee I'd say that's pretty obvious given how it's held up so far

Then you say BTC might not correct at all

The nonsense which gets posted here is really quite hilarious
Yes, had my eye on that bearish div.  Things looking like they could get nasty for ETH.  MACD on pretty much every timeframe about flip into the negative

EDIT: Good trade btw, looks like you will have caught the top!!
or into fiat
Or the inverse...

You're assuming they are trying to improve security and not just trying to reduce cost of the network itself.

You can do the latter by running a decentralized network and having a single verifier of all data. Most modern corporate network architectures are somewhat of a mish-mash of protocols and designs while a single decentralized network can be a cheaper way to streamline said network.
If you are running an in house version without individual actors enforcing consensus rules you are running a shitty database, you don't need a blockchain.

That graph really shows how messed this all is at the moment :)
Mate you out? What happened to the long?
Interesting charts. What factors do you think indicate a move up now? 
Stop hunting has been a thing since Bitfinex started getting big in 2014. Remember: the market is a tool to fuck over as many people as possible, usually all the smaller and less experienced fish


We're just at a major indecision point.

Also wouldn't be surprised if a lot of these wicks are ETH arb bots.
Thank you! 
Sorry, my phrasing was a bit presumptuous! 


Essentially, BTC gains dominance in times of uncertainty (when the overall total market cap is going down or thought to possibly be heading down). This stabilizes the price of BTC much more than ALT coins, as they have much smaller market caps. So, many people convert to BTC (like myself) when it looks like a market contraction might be coming. Because if that contraction does come, alts typically fall much harder than BTC, thus if you are in BTC, you will be able to rebuy in at a better BTC ratio, thus increasing your ALT holdings. 


Let me know if that helped or I can expand a bit more with a few number examples!
You think they would deliberately keep it offline? 
What if *all of that* already happened? And $20k was the reward?

7.8 is possible but anything under is wishful thinking short term imo. Either we gain some height to smash through supports with momentum, or we gain some height and momentum builds up and sellers don't want to sell anymore. 

Other case : as the price stops growing and ranges, ppl lose interrest and cash out one by one, slow bleed, alts season. 

Other case : as the price stops growing and ranges, ppl lose interest and cash out one by one but the price doesn't tank somehow. Which means someone is buying it, and once done will quickly mark the price up.
We could bounce higher. We did just that on the double top to 11.7k. 

There's a case to be made for a huge descending triangle on the daily: https://www.tradingview.com/x/CzNwdPwD/  

For BTC to continue rising, there needs to be fuel for that. I'm not seeing fuel for another bull run until there's an environment to support it or there's a new frenzy (in which case it shouldn't stick).
They probably get creative with ways to get off which might tear it up a bit.
I always think of that younger brunette bird in Sister Act. That’s the kind of nun’s snatch I’d like to try.
This is exactly what I meant to convey.
Yet you fail to realise that this sub is continually positive on the whole, downvoting anything negative and in denial.

It's been funny to watch though, down and down we go, as predicted. 
>  66% of 158 people on this sub think we'll see $10001 before $5999

Yes and there are a lot more than 158 people in this sub.
And i could say we're up from 2k\>8k over the last 12 months. I'm more agnostic over larger timeframes, maybe even bearish, but I'm talking smaller timeframes\-I dont like shorting right as we approach support everyone has been eyeing during a downtrend, or longing right before resistance. I was equally confused when people got super bullish at 9.8\-10k.
the people panicing aren't new to Bitcoin, and know that a 3.5% drop could just be the beginning 
Lol I know. Me too. I didn’t even find out about bitcoin until December 2017.  
actually i remember him shorting 9700 on the blow off top because of overbought RSI.
I believe I said that it's less helpful when the market is in a strong trend. But that doesn't mean it's useless. 

I'm probably getting in a little too really here, but this should bounce relatively soon. 
I'll probably be underwater for a bit, but $7,800 should provide at least a moderate bounce. 
6600 was the last low, about a month ago.  I think this one will be somewhere in the neighborhood of 7500.
I don't typically have targets
Well...fair point. 
I’ve been having my most productive day all week.  So I guess there’s that... 
That's a good idea.  Unless they are coding that feature right now...

I have a bucket of salt for you

Was so unwilling to pull the trigger this whole time knowing damn well 0.055 was dirt cheap ETH (I traded ETH a lot last year on Dax)
I traded all my btc for eth at 0.55 in april. Didn't swap back to btc though, sold everything last week.

I still think its too risky to buy in at these prices with the price movement potentially going significantly lower. So I'm waiting in all cash for this tug of war to play out. It's just a simple risk to reward evaluation and it isn't worth it for me to get my hand trapped in the cookie jar.

I panic closed last night when we got to 8400 my 8700 short. Kinda lost confidence when I saw you and chewy close after the triangle break.  But I didn't consider that I had a better position than you guys and could wait it out a bit. But there you go, live and learn.
No stops mode until you get a BXD up your but. Even still you have 50% chance of winning in that case. Not for me though.
I am not shorting. Just opening longs 1x lev (actually 10x, but I withdrew 90% of my trading stack) and closing them at the same price point (or higher). Set stops below 8100 and you should be fine
On BitMex you don’t pay for leverage
Mex so bad it died while going sideways earlier. 
There’s more longs than shorts no? How would Bitmex be dead?
It has the benefits of not depending on setting the position after the break when Bitmex usually hangs, but i agree, with such active stop hunting (wicks) the stops would have to be far from current value that would render this strategy useless. 
If stop hunting was not a problem then you could set the stops right out of the pattern and get a good entry without having to worry of server overload
On the other hand, if we go down, the futures premium is likely to disintegrate quickly. 
Some dude had a $3M limit buy on the books at 8325 on June. If he wasn't a short bailing, he's hating life right now. I guess even if he was a short bailing, lol.
I'm actually up more on the short I flipped than the loss on the long, but as you said, we'll see. 
Shit bro.
lol someone on june futures had a $3M buy in at 8325 and let a ton of us sell/short into it while BFX was nearing 8200. Got a $100 premium on that short entry. 
Same. Had to market sell it though.

I got lucky. My stop must have triggered just before it went down. My position was already closed when I logged in.
how much ETH do i need to send you? will 0.1 be enough?
!long on number of PMs gypsy gets anyway
If 8230 is rejected if we get there ( previous support from bottom of triangle), i highly recommend closing there. 


tbh i'm not really trading. i just withdraw my interest gains through crypto. i just buy and then sell on my card. so now just holding for a few days it to appreciate (it's a small amount around $5k)
Mikey, I’m usually bearish and have spent pretty much every trade shorting. You can’t underestimate the effect of the BGD on your average Joe though. I should know, I am one!
Log support from Sept low through 6k is currently at around 6800-ish. If that fails, things are all kinds of fucked.
I disagree, I think we have strong support at 7200.
I’d agree with you without the BGD. Psyhologically, your average Joe is going to think; “I don’t want my shit pushing in again”, even if the number of shorts open was the primary reason. Your average Joe doesn’t
know/care how many shorts were open when the BGD occurred, only that the BGD occurred.
Stop, I can't breath...
I've learned to pay no mind to the highs. Draw lines from low to low to low. If it's up, a higher high will come.

> I gotta admit it's getting tiring and I'm starting to feel a bit impatient.

This reminds me of housepricecrash.co.uk and you can guess the theme of the forum. 

There are posters on there who sold up 15 or more years ago expecting to buy a house cheaper who, er, still are. 

I remember seeing posts around 2005 saying 'should I buy this house in central London for £150,000?' followed by an avalanche of responses along the lines of 'forget it, son. The game is up' followed by a £1 million rise.  

Alts have already so ridiculously exceeded my expectations that I don't have any no more. They bear no relation to reason. It may not return for an alarmingly long time. 
How else would you frame it? It's not a kumbaya thing.  There are a lot of people who hate Bitcoin, and I mostly feel sorry for them. Not only are they missing out on one of the few chances life will give them to break free of the debt slavery prison they're in, maybe because of some weird financial Stockholm syndrome, they're also missing out on the excitement of taking part in one of economic history's greatest advancements.
This whole sub screams cognitive dissonance and confirmation bias.

Dear Jim,

“*I want a decentralized worldwide digital currency, based on cryptography, where transactions take place between users directly on a peer to peer network, without an intermediary such as a central bank or single administrator, and are recorded in a public distributed ledger.*”


Now then, now then... 
Well if this was it then this is definitely less dramatic. 
I appreciate the feedback, bud. Just out of curiosity, would you be *shocked* if we popped to $11.7k three weeks from now?
saying that a retest of 11.7k wouldn't be that surprising is delusional? c'mon man...
/u/Hotsoccerman regularly posts thoughtful analysis and comments. If you disagree with his outlook, you should do it on the merits of his argument instead of continuing a long trail of snide remarks which add zero value to any conversation.

As long as you didn't hit a couple particular days in February at least.  I know several people who sold the bottom or close enough to it to not be able to to have found the good timing to recover the loss.
More like sell in May and buy back in July
multiply in July
Just not true for bitcoin from November last year until April...
Doesn’t this feel like 9.2k-9.4k to you? You were long last week and got stopped out.

If this does fall, will you be shorting from 8.1 ( 9.1 when you did last week ) 
third times the charm
They warned 30 minutes prior but not sure what else they could've done during the down time for existing open orders 
Vel, if you start your support line at the slightly later dip to ~8750, we haven't broken out of that yet
Thanks, I'll keep that in mind for my next hookup with a pornstar.
I'm a permabull shitposter. The lower we go, the more bullish my shitposting becomes.
speculation based on tweets and earlier wallet movements. I'm not sure but at this point just kinda sneeky suspicion. 
He's eth moon Boi trolling 

ironically all his trolling has been accurate so far lol 
And he's here apparently to watch longs die.
They're geniuses, really. 
Yes, they are if they hold. Nobody ever regrets buying Bitcoin if they hold it long enough.  They do almost always regret selling it though.

I've bought a couple of ATH points that look extremely cheap right now, and I've sold some at a huge "profit" (I no longer consider dollar gains to be profits, just tax headaches) and regretted it when it went up another thousand percent after I sold.
Yeah, I don't believe in arbitrary lines. I believe in math, and math says we go up over time.  Why? Because demand grows, and supply doesn't.  Sometimes supply is artificially inflated by a mad dumper, but they always lose in the end. Always. Even the Gox guys got bought out eventually -- 400,000 coins.

That being said, I now have an order at $7500 and will definitely buy more if it goes lower than that.

Well, to be fair he called a potential inverse head and shoulders on our first bounce at 6k and this sub went nuts over it.

My last chart was in mspaint 

;__; What do you have against my art skills
Thanks for the clarification. I had forgotten that it was a reversal pattern. 
To me the drop makes no sense in the first place so I have no clue.  I’d like to see it go up though since I’m long 
lmfao!
$1.50 btc.  lol bears are so desperate for this market to drop.  It's going to be awesome when they get destroyed.
That already seems to be the issue
> markets can be irrational for along time in either direction

truth
I see this also. Businesses aren’t setting up desks, VPs aren’t leaving for crypto businesses, insured custodial support being rolled out and exchanges being purchased aren’t because they think they can make a one time play and crash what effectively is a small $300B (comparatively) asset class. 

This is a several trillion opportunity that is once in a generation, heck century. I have never felt so positive for the space. I’m looking straight through any FUD and I’m holding on and I hope everyone else is too. We haven’t come this far to let go. I don’t normally say this, but at this moment, i’m all in. 
Those prophecies don’t cut it anymore, at least so it seems. Chinese New Year, tax etc etc

Bitcoin and cryptocurrency's have no future.
That is one of the most idiotic things you can tell that guy. This is BTC, not S&P. BTC is easily replaceable.
Bullish.

Thanks, the market can finally move.
Thanks. They're still enough off 8200 that they shouldn't get wicked. I appreciate the cautionary tale though, truly. Sorry you got stopped out just before that. I was short and got stopped on the way up off 6800. I've often thought the only worse fate would have been to be long and get stopped out *just* before it. 
Boy you must live a dangerous life my dude. Playing without stops is very risky. All about hedging risk
Order books are a bit thicker down here. I'd be surprised by a fakeout wick that went much more than $20ish under 8200. 
Mt gox wont rebuy 
Assuming orders don't get pulled. And even if they stay, that is completely possible.
That's ridiculous. Saying we MUST do anything before a run or dump is false. 
leave dush ALONE 😡😡😡😤😤😤
he got banned. he actually closed his short before that I Think, I remember him saying 40k shorts open was retarded and it scared him out of shorting
I believe I got him banned. He was being rude and I reported him the mod. I dislike rudeness, please dont be rude (not directed to you but in general). Howveer, I believe dush has served his time and I think ehw ont be rude anymore. So if the mod is reading this; I, the victim of dush, forgive mankush, and allow him to return.
Not in my world. There's actually more people viewing BTC charts as linear than log (think retail) and for that reason linear wins and thats what i graph based on. Given my history of trading, it works out just fine.

I've seen a lot of BGDs over the past few years that put these recent LRDs to shame.  These things are just little Japanese clit diddlers compared to what a big bull can do.
True.
Agree with veltrop. We keep positions open for more profits, not for tech.

That being said, price jumped back above 8k right after you posted that 🍻

I closed my long that was underwater so I know the frustration and it may jump back up to 9.5 K regardless of what anyone's charts say. You do you. 
lol bro I am trying my best to keep it as long term as possible. Possibly devoting part of my life to it. hehe.

Just realized this as said below.
I am not planning to close it so stops are of no use, just doesn't look good watching it in red and low.

Edit: Hey lad this is my trade and my choice.
Hey man thanks and I really feel glad we are on the same page in terms of the coin and its future. I have planned already this trade, I will hold it thats how they say it here.

I will get over it and won't be too sad. Cheers mate! :) 
I can move large sums of money using Bitcoin to any part of the world with just two long alphanumerical addresses.
My actual liquidation as of writing is sub $7,200. But I have experienced +-$200 change in liquidation price as I approached in the past. So I just added $200 more to make it $7,400.

Not sure about your Maths though.
projected by whom?

There is no guarantee it will be higher. 
Key word is projected. Just how they projected $50k when it hit $18k and we know how that prediction went.
Worth its weight in 💩.  The smarter move would have been to sell the stack at 9.8k a few weeks ago 
That's what the word "If" is for you numbnuts with a chip on his shoulder 
Of course! Lucky in the sense of taxation 
Thanks again.  Ya the price action puzzled me but I’m very new to this type of trading so I wasn’t sure.  5ish hours ago there was around a $90 spread on perpetuals- mark vs spot.  Wasn’t sure if something like this is seen on live trading.
This is my site with the parameters of the Draper Prediction:

I should probably make a button to load it.
>tether up

But... Mex doesn't have usdt...

>your phone

Oh
Thanks I was trying to factor that in for a short-term bounce...we'll see how it plays out

peace 
yea mine too 
Yes, buying pressure is slowly building up. Bears are hesitant about getting rekt and bulls are starting to fear of seing the price runaway. The tension is building and even a modest move up could be explosive. 

The chart is obfuscating it all so it's anyone guess tho. I suspect eth is on the verge of a massive bull run tho, which could only help. 

I'm certainly not shorting this market anymore for now.
Thing is, if you do include the wicks it's a super droopy looking bearflag.. 
Triangles do the absolutely opposite things from what they should do the last week :\(
lol true
Your’re position trader.  Yeah, that periodic hodling :) . I can be one those once market gives a clear longer term direction.
America is only 1 country of many
>I've said this before many times but US citizens aren't allowed access to anywhere that you can short.

You must mean short on leverage, and you're wrong about that. I mean come on.. do you not know that the CME and CBOE are offering leveraged futures to US citizens? And there's Kraken. And USDT instead of USD but can't you use Poloniex, too? There's more too, and everyone just signs up on BitMEX through a VPN.
Kraken?
"aren't allowed"

I've noticed many websites where shorting is possible treating their user locations a lot like porn websites treat the "are you over 18" pop up. It's a formality.
Wish granted
Spot hit... Maybe, I just trading spot for now since bitmex is down :\)
DCB or such, my take is 3rd to 1/2 of the width of the BBand is where we will see a bounce to.
There is only one thing really to back it up. I have said it during the past one and very clearly seen the consequences of it. I for sure believe this market is controlled and is not completely independent. That's it for backing up my statements. I guess I will have to spend some more time in here than, I am ready!

A gut feeling is a gut feeling when you ignore all the rational and logical indicators out there flashing at you, yet your guts take over and you make wrong assumptions and decisions. I don't do that. Ta dahh.
I suppose it’s never been hacked, it’s security is quite impeccable, but the technology feels very old. 
Buy the rumor sell the news
The last narrative was the 'upbit' fud. If it wouldnt happen price would be 20k already.
That wasn't pump, that was pure raw insanity.
Are you actually positioned short or do you just troll?
Based on historical BTC bear markets plus the next halvening I would assume.
Historical BTC Charts, yes. It was all heated up to much, the chart went parabolic. After that, there is always a phase of a long downtrend.
I sometimes feel pity for myself for not taking TA seriously in this market. But then I also think TA sometimes is nothing but a mere joke. 

If we *break the* line towards the bottom and $8,100 doesn't stop us, perhaps I'll have to look at it again closely. 
If we break 8200 then 7600 ish is next maybe a bounce at 7800. As we did som consolidation there on the way up. 
We are not trading slow stocks, not at all. I do believe people want to grow their investments in a shorter time especially in this crypto market. 

The downvotes with this post lol actually communicates a lot of information to me. Does that mean my own bias is safe if I were to forget it for a moment? 
Whatever floats your boat mate and yes some of us are so dependent upon others. That's what I wish I could block. 
Rude.

Also, why do you think it is nonsense, what part about what I wrote is a lie?
This guy is a notorious troll. Hence the downvotes. 
I think he's long from $8.9k lol 
See? This is what I'm talking about. Beyond filthy and pathetic.
I miss Kobayashi.
Well yeah i stated that was just not sure whether the stated percentage was already divided by 100 for the calculation or not (so its actually 0,0001 x 150,000 and not 0,01 x 150,000). 

I know its not $ amount, I stated $150,000 WORTH (of btc, ltc, whatever)... its in my comment not hard to understand.

I will look into the bots thing, but if its just $15 per day for such a large amount I highly doubt bots would make it more interesting. I was expectng at least $75 p/day minimum, with $150k worth you can make so much more than $15 in other ways, even less riskier ways.
Is it not still better than just HODLing? I mean if you hodl anyway extra 15 bucks per day is not bad? Assuming BTC will grow in the long term.
Compound interest also applies to risk of haircut; which can be absurdly powerful in a few years time. Don't ignore counterparty risk.

Source:math and fucking pissed at bitfinex
Meh just close at breakeven or slightly less I’m long from 7989
Sorry but that show sucks. Just a rip-off of movies like ET and The Goonies. It has no originality and the plot is boring and drawn out. I'm shocked that it's as popular as it is.
"Everyone loves large chests"
The bullish sign back in the day was the 'I'm waiting for $550'.

This time will be no different except Bitcoin added a digit before the decimal.
My fingers are crossed whatever it is. uhh.
Yep, this looks like its going further down
it can also move up though

>People aren't getting stop hunted it's a Phase 7 hyperwave stuck in a rebound burst. These are very dangerous for newbs and I recommend leverage traders STAY WAY. I'm still pretty new at this but even some of my shorts got liquidated in the thrust up to 8500 even though I remain 100 PERCENT solid in my analises that this market going to 3D.

Huh?  On May 3 BTC had a low of 9188 and a high of 9798.  If you are going to troll at least check the historical prices first ffs.
can you elaborate? 
To me it looks like price made a lower low and the RSI made a higher low
The market is not a living being and doesn't need to be described as such. 
binance and GDAX have done post only periods. Most likely they will do the same, but, it means I'm going to have to stay awake and at my computer refreshing bitmex for hours and maybe all night lol. I have a bunch of orders open (no positions luckily!)
that’s exactly what I said bub. now that that has happened yadayada. we are hanging at 8.1k after that ridiculous bullshit 
nah, just going back up to the range we were in's peak.
Well if that is the case I am pretty god darn sure they already lost chunk of their 'can't afford to loose stack'. The moment the price is about to go up, I start seeing markets sells. 

If people really care about not messing up with their standard of living, they really need to be patient. Traders doesn't have a clue. This has been bugging me, may be more because it doesn't favor my position,.
You're all good mate! Holding any position atm?
People don't want to admit that it's very possible and actually very likely..keep hodling though...
The sentiment is absolutely insane. Seems like everyone EXPECTS it to go up for various reasons. Markets simply don't work like that. 
It doesn't work like this though. Institutions don't operate like that whether you want to believe it or not. 
lol @ you comparing tech companies with earnings to a cryptocurrency... 
Damn, now I'm curious what he said that warranted 7 days ban!
get him jared!!

Your risk management is terrible. Fix it or just HODL.
Good call. It's a trainwreck (which, consequently, makes it hard to look away once you do).
it’s an excellent way to doubt your position, no matter which position it is.

I completely agree, I’m in a small position currently. 
I have it at 8450-8500 as of now, but somewhere in the vicinity should be heavy resistance.
https://imgur.com/a/1F2ox2j
funny you should say that because I actually just draw this line you mention 15 minutes ago. It's nice because it is parallel to the support below and there is 3 points of contact with the 1h, but i'm not sure if we can trust those wicks! 


walked away as in sold all? Or just stopped trading?
do whateva you want, it was more of an observation  of price action than anything. I think people see this as free money and similar to $6.5k and they're going to be terribly disappointed 
no its not :p 
At some point "stalling the breakdown" turns into "strong support" though.
Well your predictions haven't been too accurate have they 
"Short the bounce/spike" is my mantra now.   And that won't change until we are clearly in a strong bull trend.
Yup, and so far it's been profitable to buy every single dip for the inevitable bounce. every bounce is smaller though in terms of each time frame from the 1m to the 1 week. 

I think we're around September 2014 right now. It consolidated at $8200 (well, $470 ish) for 2 weeks before dumping to $6600 in a parabolic dump. bounced to $7800 then finally made new lows below $6k. 

 so far im thinking sentiment, price action, fundamentals (as in, change in fundamentals, not overall fundamentals) and everything combined, it is probably very similar 
lol I'm seriously not trying to post after we move down. I promise it's a coincidence 😅 


it's actually kind of annoying because I want to genuinely know what people think regardless of the past 5 minutes 

I recorded current results before I posted this and a am going to see if the percentage after this is more in favor of moving down actually
7800 is where the traders that are hoping for a bounce will bail, because thats where most of the stop losses are
I assume a flaccid penis is a bearish pattern.  
Wait corporate BFC accounts don't have margin access?

True, but this doesn't look particularly springy so far.
I'm short from 8160, no stops lol. I just realized I might be in a lot of trouble.
That's assuming most bitmex users are humans.
Well the closest we have seen was a couple brief OKex outages. 20x and not 100x, but I get your point.

I still think it will be less eventful than we are thinking.
it's unfortunate how this doesn't make sense unless you have worked on or at least understand large infrastructures like this...

people assume they're lazy or cheap but it has nothing to do with that. it's like trying to build 1,000 extra apartments on top of a clay hut. doesn't matter how much money you throw at it. and you can't simply just start over 
As long as you're not at risk of stops or actual liquidation, it should be fine. I imagine they'll work very hard to avoid any significant movements that liquidate all the 50x+ yahoos.
Kind of funny that the price isnt moving on Finex now that mex is down. Does mex really control the market? Can't be good when futures/derivatives run the price.
shouldnt the price be different from when they suspended it? \( i mean if btc moves by the time they open it\)
Not looking forward to get my stops hit due to the mex overreaction if price is diverged from bitfinex price :(
What would you imagine would happen in each case?
Push the "fair price" liquidation system to the limit.

But I feel they are in better shape to absorb the shock with their time-filtered reference price than a system that doesn't.
When binance went down for 2 days there were coins with over 40% change comparing to the order book. Once they resumed it took 1 minute to get in sync to all other exchanges. There was a 5% spike difference at most before leveling.
Bots trade fast enough to mitigate this differences 
What lawsuits? BitMEX releases liability for these circumstances I assume. I dunno, did anyone actually read the service agreement?
I just read the terms since I never did. Bad news for those who got rekt. BitMEX denies all liability.

Gotta double down and make it back.
The ratio is likely going to take a leg down soon. Not a bad place for a short between 0.86 to 0.88. 
I've done it, but I realized sooner or later the price will move in one direction and I don't want to get caught with my pants down. 
Let's just keep that between us...
Longs pay shorts 0.2030% in 12 hours.
So... 50/50?
W double bottom could look like an awful lot like a descending triangle, no?

(not saying this is, just stirring the pot)
It's a good point.  There are so meany features on bitmex that I love that others just don't have.
no, but they had hard disk problems earlier today; should have been solved, but API went down again.
Well put by veltrop and Sloppy, including some things I hadn't considered.

My main reasons for this particular position right now:

I was short-term bearish. Several notable traders opening longs made me consider the bull scenario/7.8 acting as strong support. Even if 7.8 breaks I can tell myself this long is my DCA long which I would add to between 7 and 8k. In the meantime, providing the short doesn't get stopped out by a slingshot up here before we go down to that range (if we go down), I'll be in the green still.

I opened two positions a couple of days ago and it was going great until it went very wrong lol - but I think with the right timing and luck it can be a nice position to be in and as veltrop said, gives you a chance to scope things out.

Furthermore, mex funding seems like it might favor shorts in the short term, so I can collect a little bit on that as I'm short swaps and long futures.
Not to be a dick but if losing 0.01 BTC is a big deal to you maybe you shouldn't be trading. I mean that in the absolute nicest way possible.
Oi! I'm trying to be an individual here ;D
What polls are you talking about? 
150 people is a decent amount

I mean it's not a stringent study by any means...but it's a lot better than skimming 10 comments and concluding everyone here is bearish, which they are clearly not. 
Still big but less in your face :)
I think it's a psychological thing. Going from 10k to 7k in a matter of two weeks is just too much, it will kill the momentum and everyone would like it to sink further down from then on. I personally think BTC sinking this time will seal its fate for a long time, while the rest of the market is just getting started. Consensus demonstrated how the general public is keen on alts not because of the tech, but because of the gains. If BTC will not satisfy the greed of masses (and it is working in exact opposite by draining the alts), many will flock to the alts for profits. Remember how the last BTC pump started? Alts began suddenly pumping. The same scenario can play out again.
[deleted]
Yeah, but I'd be scaling between 8300-7850, weighted such that my average should be around 8K. $200 (2.5%) stops on a 5x trade is on the outskirts of my risk tolerance, but if I hedge under 8K it would be fine. 
I'm not certain by any means but more certain than I have been in a while. Look at top 5-6 comments. All long. If you want to contrary trade, you'd short right now. 

You could be right though, I guess. 

We got here entirely on a short squeeze, fundamentals are shit, institutional money is not coming in (that's all a meme), alts just finished their massive DCB, and we're going sideways  with futures premiums going UP. lol 

It's the opposite of $6.5-7k, which i correctly called accumulation 
I have limits around there to take about 20% profit off the position in case I miss a quick bounce in and out of there.  probably will set another 40% or so around 7200.
You really know how to kick a guy when he's down :\)
wat
the standard for that verification is a photo of the chick naked with you holding up a piece of paper with <username> delivers. To the moon!
I promise you the r/r is worth it. worst case you have to stop having sex for a minute while you close a position. 

Best case...you blow a load as this shit dumps below $7800. 

aight but really go spend time with your girl. have fun mate 
I never bothered to close it on the bot but the position was closed in baby profit. 
I also suspect the new sexy position bot is making people a bit more trigger happy. that said I knew there would be a little pull back from that march to almost 10k but this is beginning to worry me a little. bottom must be close 
Oh wow, sorry you’re totally right! I apologize for posting such nonsense. I hope I haven’t inconvenienced you too much because I know you’re salty by nature, and I really wouldn’t want to exacerbate that.  

Have a good night! 
Thanks. I was looking at this one: https://www.tradingview.com/x/61JtDGGI/

Found your Bitcoin Leveraged Movements indicator on TV, looks interesting, though not that many signals. Are there any other indicators on that chart?

The one custom strategy/indicator I use that's consistently profitable is a 30m ichi-based buy/sell indicator. Can share if you're interested. My TV sn is buffetbeijing
If they're going to do a complete wholesale change already then, why would they go with a private blockchain that's slower and less efficient than some other network architecture/topology (ring or mesh, for instance... idk, I'm not really a network engineer)?

Put in other words... sure, private blockchain may be more efficient than the mish-mash they currently have, but if they have to tear down/rework the mish-mash anyway, why not just choose some architecture that's more efficient than a blockchain without the mish-mash?

The benefit of blockchain *is* the security/reliability. Going private with that removes those benefits and you're only left with the inefficiencies, from what I gather. 
A decentralized database could decrease cost of overhead under a monopolistic system.

So they could run their own private blockchain and it would be more efficient than running a mish-mash of other networking architectures.
Exactly.

ha ohhh got it ;)
I am. I closed last night in tiny profit when the pump died off quickly. I'm leaning towards reopening long if I can get in this target area: https://www.tradingview.com/x/jG9GkWlK/
So by the time you see a real contraction it's basically already too late though right?  That's what's always got me about protecting my BTC ratio.  (because I don't wan't to do it at high frequency and try to jump on each contraction)

Thanks for mentioning the other contributing factors though about uncertainty. 

In hindsight, I've definitely seen this pattern, need to get better at managing it.  

It's tricky with alts though, because if you have a particular alt that already wasn't at its high, it might even pump on news/events when things are contracting.
There's certainly nothing stopping them from doing so. 

Do I think they would? No, probably not.
Everyone would be wrong except you? 
I agree, I also think sub 8k to $7.8k is totally possible in the short term. dropping much below there would cause me to really have to reevaluate, and if that happens, so be it.
A cross, holy water and the donation box. God knows what's been up there. 
Oh yea forgot about her.. What if the deal was pork Whoopi's damp crab sleeve first, that's the only way to get the young brunette. That's the deal. 

Don't know if I could. 
When have I ever said that?! I started conducting these polls basically to prove that this sub *is* very bullish by default 
Ah yes, I forgot that you can't poll things unless you include literally everyone. 

I meant really, just go look at all the recent comments. Like half of them are people saying why this is bullish...

I just counted the top most recent 46 comments. of them: 28 were bullish, 10 were bearish (2 of those were sarcastic or very short term bearish and they planned on buying the dip), and 8 were neutral or irrelevant. 

that's 60% bullish. idk i mean it could just be a coincidence...but I'm thinking this sub is pretty bullish right now. 

Look at futures premium right now. Still pretty big. $140 on September...
> And i could say we're up from 2k>8k over the last 12 months.

Yes you could say that, and ignore everything over 8k and pretend it never happened.   You could retreat to alternate reality fantasy world, yes you could.

Well at least i got an excuse im from Russia , we still use Nokias 3310 here and drive LADAS
When do you decide to close a long? Apologies for the questions, just trying to learn from others 
8700-8400 is pretty good, despite the missed potential. Hard to be too upset over catching a 4% swing trade. 

It made sense to close where you did, too. There's not a whole lot between 8400-8600 in terms of resistance. The trouble now is trying to get another good position. 
I do not have any stops on this position, I did on the previous one however, only for the second time in my trading life. lol.

oh, you pay for leverage alright, just not in the way you are implying. :)
Still in Kraken. 
Bitmex isn't so good also, even chewy wants to leave... Finex requires a minimum of 1000$ equity and i don't have that much to play with.
I need to create an exchange of my own :)
He means "ded" as in, "their servers will implode and it won't be possible to open a position."
Traders rushing to open/close positions will kill the remaining hamster.
You're also counting on bitmex to actually trigger your stops when they should trigger. 

Anecdotally, this is not a certainty.

During the move from $9,400 to $9,000, for example, I had stops set to trigger at around $9,250 that simply never executed. I closed my position manually, and about 30 seconds letter I got a message that my stops were cancelled. 

Thanks bitmex!
Which is why I'm tempted to short futures, which I did the other day to great results, but this is just getting insane.
I've probably never been more grateful to a whale/MM.  He cleared the path for us guppies.
Sorry to come out cocky but you're lot emotional trading. A 2% drop and it's going 5k (I don't mean you especially). It's already back 8.2 and everyone took a hit. Imo in illiquid fluctuating market like this everyone should be able to stomach a 15% move against his position. Which means less gains when it goes +15%, sure...

Just messing with you.  Sounds good.
what's your average buy in price? I see your name around a lot and have wondered 
lol im really curious though. 
Must of lost out on another coin and hoping you recover it all with tefood
What did he say 
That's true.  And everyone has to decide if that date or hike they are going on is worth $10,000 or not.  Sometimes it is and sometimes it's not.   
It's on Bitmex, so I can't check right now.  It's pretty low leverage, so I'll be fine.
So far sticking to my simple (and probably a bit naive) strategy and resisting the urge to fomo in turned out quite okay.

Also the housing market is so fundamentally different that all it has in common with any of this is that it goes through boom and bust cycles (on a much larger timescale).

Most people aren't permabulls or permabears. Everybody wants to make money. Nobody knows where the price is going. Everybody in the market is a buyer and seller at some point unless they literally die hodling.  To me there is some mild fundamental substance in the OP but is mostly cheerleading tribal stuff that fits better on r/bitcoin.
Yes, people are coming up with elaborate theories/fantasies now as to why it's ultimately bullish that the price is dropping so much, so fast.  They are trying to convince themselves that what they are seeing is not real.

And cognitive dissonance will get stronger and stronger as we drop until it gets to the point where reality cannot be denied.  Then that is when it gets kind of sad.  Right now, it is just irritating to read posts about "I don't get how we can be bearish here?!?!".

Someone today posted about how they just sold and have lost 50% of their funds.  That will turn to 75%, 80%, and 90% for a few who are extra stubborn.   

And I hope the market magically turns around and goes back up forever, so all this doesn't happen, but that is unlikely.
Doesn't help me when I have an open position on MEX and can't log in LOL
Aren't we at $8210? lol jfc what's the premium? $70? $80?

The premium is going UP while we go down/sideways
I've never seen the books on both futs and swaps so calm.  Usually it's like watching a seizure on swaps.
I just want a wick to 8000 to close 33% of my position so all fees are covered and i have some profit so i can sleep better
:-O

Harsh but true.
I’m short now ( was long before ) so I’m feeling a dump. Weak sauce bounce off bottom of triangle which is really a bear flag. 

Are u in position? 
To be honest, yes, I would actually be shocked. Whereas before we tested $9990 I can genuinely say I wouldn't have been. 
In this sub, if you say we are heading to 2k, you’re “smart money.”  But if you’re bullish, you’re delusional. 
well that was unexpected and nice, thanks :)
Exactly.  I linked to horoscopes for a reason.  You see what you want to see in horoscopes, the same way that OP is searching for bearish indicators.  He's happy to ignore that the indicator was completely wrong about the past 6 months as long as it aligns with his desire today.
Shorting a breakdown here is a bit of a mixed bag. 

The obvious initial target is $7,800, which makes shorting a breakdown of $8,100 more of a scalp opportunity than a worthwhile swing trade. 

I'll probably just ignore a breakdown here and watch what happens at $7,800. Potentially longing a bounce there.
Why did they need sudden maintenance?
which is why why I don't really trust most wedges people draw here. I don't even know what the actual protocol for it is. You can just draw a new support line and justify a new wedge.

If you draw the new wedge with a steeper support line m then it doesn't have as many points of contact, too

Not saying it's not a descending wedge, but I'm really not even sure where you're supposed  to draw the support line in this case. 
I didn't mean mine is any better.  I mean you can draw it to fit any narrative.
OR your next hookup with a uptight prude. 
When moon? 

Sir? SIR?
It's the ratio, only thing you can trade. Btcusd is the only fiat pair. 

Also, they're all futures. So they're above spot. 

They have terrible liquidity so taker fees are insanely expensive too 
lol oh come on I think you're confusing a grumpy old man for a brilliant troll. he's not that bad

Huh? Whose talking about those silly meme? Not me. 
I’ll message you from my yacht in 4-5 years to prove I’m right 
Told ya
I was long and got stopped out overnight and decided to sleep in just a bit more before reopening. By the time I was pouring myself coffee and saw what was happening it was already by 7400s. I caught a buy after hitting market buy about 500 times.
It’s like shagging a hooker without a Johnny.
What if your liquidation is 3k? Risk much?
The coin moved around mtgox wallets doesn't touch the dump volume this past few days, let alone two weeks.
im afraid we must pentarhudi (master luc) said so, also 1-2 year bear in prospects
# #bringdushback
Seconded. He was entertaining and not that much of a douche.
Linear for long term is...really just...not smart 

A linear line from $1-100 is insanely parabolic 
*OH* I'm dumb lol.


Still though, big moves aren't something that usually happens.
Possible. Unlikely.
Nothing wrong with trading up and trading down, whether you believe in the tech or not.  I do a little myself.

But /u/TheEchonomist is both proclaiming to believe in the tech and also that his belief will fail if the price drops ~10% more.  That's fucking crazytalk, he needs to get out of crypto if that's his thought process.  He's going to get rekt.
Then you need to deleverage your long and make a plan for risk management.

I've been in crypto for 7 years now.  There is a very high chance we see under 7k at some point again.  It's also likely that we could see under 5k.  It's possible but unlikely that we see under 3k.

Last year's bull run was insane.  A 75-85% retrace to the bottom of the bear market would be NORMAL for crypto.  I'm not saying is going to happen, all of these are spectrum possibilities.  But you should have a plan for them that you are comfortable with.  If it happens and you get rekt and give up on crypto and then you miss the moon 3 years from now, you're going to be really unhappy.

Consider the bad cases and look at the history.  Make a plan and you'll feel better no matter what.

It can be done just as well with a $100 value.

It has a track record of reaching all time highs as year end approaches. As a man of the charts I don’t have to tell you this. 

Several prominent people have made predictions that bitcoin’s price is headed up as this year progresses 
There are no guarantees in life but death and taxes.   I’m all in riding this wave 🌊 but I do think it will take years rather than months.  
I think I'm going to sit out unless I can get a long entry extremely close to the support of the ascending triangle. Even then, I'll be going low leverage and maybe 20% of stack. 
Indeed: https://www.tradingview.com/x/zb9Uvwk9/  

Happy to be sitting out. 


These wicks are bullshit, think its fairly valid to cut them.
The cascading drops from the other week all began with an ascending triangle that broke down.
The point is if you can't articulate what those rational and logical indicators are (and I've never seen you clearly do so but I'm admittedly not following your every post), it's a gut call.

Your gut call is that the market is controlled and is not completely independent. You need to back up that idea with evidence, otherwise it's just your gut. In fact, it's gutception. Not only is your gut saying it's a controlled market, you're then using your gut to guess which way the controller wants the market to go.
Seems fine to me... segwit adoption growing, layer 2 coming along nicely, lots of amazing projects on the horizon...
well?
I wouldn't say years. The cycles are accelerating. I would say 3-6 months.
People (speculators) are scared at the idea of a month of sideways, simple.
Yeah fair enough, but we should give positive feedback when trolls do something right haha, coerce them into better behavior 
That's very slightly underwater, when you're not a degenerate gambler with 1000 leverage like most people here. I'm not even slightly concerned until $7000 at least.
Your desired numbers are not possible at all. This would mean anyone lending 10 BTC would have 11.8+ BTC in a year, not even including compounding and also 15% BFX fee. That is 20% yearly rates for an asset that generally grows in price, seriously?
I'd trust an insured bank with fiat and a low interest rate, or cold storage with btc gains but no interest, more than putting a life's holdings on bfx with their shitty interest and increased risk.
Honestly? No. It's not, because when your HODLing and being an active investor you can sell and rebuy at moments of market capitulation/fundamental changes/news events - this can be done at a macro level it doesn't have to be day trading.

Even if you are the HODLr type who just sets and forgets it - it's still worse. As you wont have the coins under your control and will be at the mercy of that exchange.
Nostalgia for Spielberg-esque stories of the ‘80s. Seriously, that’s it. Even Netflix didn’t realize it was going to be popular until it caught on two summers ago.
Alts are profitable. Not 5x profitable but still you can profit nicely from them due to trading bots and panic sellers reacting to Bitcoin movements. 
I don't do leverage trading and I don't think Bitcoin will go down or up much. Its volatility is bad for adoption so someone is taking care of that.
This is what happens when gov'ts make it difficult/impossible to get your funds into crypto and to exchanges.  It's not even legal in the USA to margin trade.  That obviously hurts demand.

And yes, hodlers aren't having a great time lately with their "investment".  I can't see that they are going to hold all the way down too.  But hopefully the market will find a solid bottom before long and slowly start to trend up.  It's unlikely, but possible.

Sarcasm bro 
Please ignore, I'm stupid tired and looked at the price on the 14th lol. Anyway it's still higher than the big green of the 12th so I remain cautiously bullish.
The higher low isn't confirmed yet.
It looks like artificial price suppression every time a little pump begins, but it also looks like the price is being artificially propped up every time it dips.

If I had a shit ton of BTC to sell, I'd pull all of my ask orders at the first sign of a FOMO pump so I can offload at a higher price, not just start firing huge market sells into the pump to stop it in its tracks.


They probably are being patient, which is why you're not seeing the movement to favour your position. 
Have a few sell orders open that wont trigger any time soon, I only sell when its very high

9.something and 11.6
This is a trading sub dipshit.  The exact opposite of hodling is being discussed in every single comment...cool story though. 
If you subscribe to Soros' idea of reflectivity, you could say (which you have, I believe) that this expectation of institutional money is what's driving bitcoin to exorbitant prices. When investors slowly realize that that institutional money is not actually coming anywhere near the expectations people had, the bubble pops. 

> Every bubble has two components: an underlying trend that prevails in reality and a misconception relating to that trend. When a positive feedback develops between the trend and the misconception, a boom-bust process is set in motion. The process is liable to be tested by negative feedback along the way, and if it is strong enough to survive these tests, both the trend and the misconception will be reinforced.

The market has sustained itself thus far on the little amount of institutional investment and massive retail investment so far. Low liquidity, ease of access for green investors, and a promise of a financial paradigm shift are all the typical signs for a bubble pop and eventual decline. 

When the trend/misconception become *too* strong, expectations exceed reality and the bubble pops. I think we're in that process right now

I have so far not seen any large institutions actually long on bitcoin, just individuals who've already bought in with exorbitant amounts of money. People don't realize Goldman making a trading desk is not anywhere near the same thing as them going long on bitcoin 

edit: added bit about liquidity and green investors/paradigm shift 
You didnt specify just crypto....  next time be more specific.

My point stands:  institutions DO invest post bubble.
Zir assumed a mods gender
My risk management is actually quite good. I didn't open 10x all-in. I quoted average entries in each of those cases. The first position was opened at 8850 and added on each leg down with stops moved appropriately. Roughly same for the second. 
In German we have a word for this. It’s called “gaffen”

Apparently, the english translation is gawp. Never heard that word before, but Im no native speaker 
Honestly, my brain treats it like an ad on a news article. 

I register that it's there, but my brain immediately ignores it and moves on.
Worst part is people are falling for it otherwise it wouldn't have become so widespread.

On a serious note, if you send me one btc ill send you one tron ok?thxbye
Even without the wicks the pattern is there, just drops to to a lower level (not as parallel but close enough) . This could be because of high horizontal resistance @8400

I was working and away from the charts so i couldn't buy @8200. But since this is possible a bear flag, the wisest decision would be short 8450 (and ignore the wicks) or around 8500.

The price is rising so it would be important to watch what happens @8400. If it goes to 8450 i might short with stops above 8600
Sold all? Never man, just closed my laptop, tossed my smartphone and went for a hike :)
Based on your magic 8 ball that tells you exactly what the price is going to do? 
Chances are high that it is. Maybe not, but the vast majority of true crypto-enthusiasts (the informed, balanced and nerdy kind) are pretty certain that the price will be above $8500 at some point in the not-too-distant future. 

Also, the LN is looking bullish af. I feel like this isn't talked about enough here but progress and planned upgrades are incredibly bullish, imo. I was just reading up on channel factories and delegated channels, which are both incredible. AMP and watchtowers are also super bullish additions to the network that are going to go a long way to making this whole thing work. 

I'm also seeing more and more desperate LN FUD propaganda from the likes of rBTC, such as [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8jv65e/so_i_guess_the_routing_problem_with_ln_has_been/?utm_content=comments&utm_medium=hot&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=btc) gem, where OP photoshopped a two nodes together to make it look like hub and spoke, then gets schooled in the comments for being retarded.

I'm increasingly confident that LN is going to be balls-to-the-walls awesome and go a long way towards solving scalability, which is the main concern at this point. I know you think BTC is only worth $8000, and looks like you're pretty much spot on at the moment, but improvements like these are incredibly bullish imo and greatly expand the horizon of potential use-cases. Bullish af.
Sure, if buyers actually follow through and **continue buying as price rises**. 

Buyers have been loading up on dips and disappearing like farts in the wind once they take a glance behind them and realize nobody's following along. 

It's a recipe for steady decline. Not a recipe for an uptrend.
it only worked for $6500-$7000 because there were 15,000 shorts to squeeze in an hour. No more fuel means no one's buying high/getting squeezed like last time (imo)
I really can't stress enough how utterly useless it is to judge someone's performance by how many times they are right vs how many times they are wrong.

Since /u/justanotherlogin spun up his bot, [I've logged 12 trades](https://www.anotherbot.info/history.php?user=_chewtoy_).

I've taken a loss on 7, taken profit on 4 and am currently in profit on this trade for now. 

Despite the fact that I'm below a 50% success rate on these last 12 trades, I'm still up about 9% because when I was wrong I took small losses relative to the gains I took when I was right. 

EDIT: I'd also add, "how far back are we talking?" Because I'll grant that I've taken more losses lately than usual (but again, small losses), but I did exceptionally well between $6,400 and $10,000 prior to the dump below $8,800 recently. 
HOW DARE YOU CRITICIZE THE MIGHTY CHEW
The HODL mentality is smart but stupid. It’s smart if you never think the price is going to go lower and a bull run could start any second.

It’s definitely more profitable to buy every drip and sell at the “ top “, instead of buying the dip, holding through the top just for the dip to come back at you like a boomerang. 

Sure, if you sell at the supposed top and it goes up more you could miss out on some gains.. but holding till you die isn’t the smartest idea. If you’re pumping fresh money in, sell some at the top lock profits and let the rest ride 
Haha, not accusing you of anything. To be fair the odds are stacked against you by doing this in a downtrend.  

Keep it up though! I really like the gauging of sentiment. 
Oh, I see what you mean.  Yeah, that may be.
Ask my girlfriend
Usually indicates a soft market.
Not sure about that last point
Yup, me too
To be honest, I'd be happy with a direction. Any direction will do! 
Agreed. 
Indeed. 
The problem I see atm is that consolidations have bearish bias, as in, as soon as an asset stops growing for a few days ppl want out.

Just when I thought they were all here for freedom and technology /s
Honestly I think no stops is better. 

There could be a megawick, even if the price has barely moved.

Like, what if people have custom trading software or bots that will spam orders, and continue even in timeouts or whatever conditions until the order goes through, and it has bad "plan B" handling for these cases.  (I've considered writing such an interface)

Or even some stale client side requests that finally get through.

When it comes back up hopefully everyone's sessions get fully invalidated and all the clients get thrown into a stopped state first.  

But even with that it's going to be opening a floodgate.

edit: oh how sweet would it be if I catch a megawick down on my orders on september though.  September is so illiquid it already happens a lot as it is.
Maybe not all but at least there are humans. Just look at the 1 min chart on BFX wtf
I mean, they probably could start over. But they would need to find people who can build it, test it, profile it.... all while praying to god that no one working on it puts a back door in that allows them to either steal or manipulate their subledger. There are companies that have the expertise to do it, but Bitmex would probably need so many people to get this done in a manageable amount of time that they would need multiple such consulting/body leasing companies to work together.... which never works

It probably does now. this is why barts exist imo.


Super conspiracy theory: someone poured water on servers and is about to pump or dump the shit out of this 
yeah, looks like price is staying within 4$ while it's down
If no orders are fulfilled during this maintenance, then the price should be the same as it was on Bitmex when it went down (at least in the instant when it comes back).

If the rest of the market moves considerably in either direction, I would expect that direction to be quickly amplified on Bitmex.

- e.g. if the market price goes down in the meantime, then the moment Bitmex is back, it would be profitable to go short ASAP, which would drive the price down fast (towards the market level), but then continue to drop due to liquidations.

(that's obviously what's going to happen, since I was long when their API crashed. Oh, Murphy...)

EDIT: actually liquidations might start pouring in from the get-go, due do the Mark Price having changed.
You simply can't skip over significant price ranges as though they didn't happen.

Let's say, for example, that the market pumped to $8,400 while they are under maintenance, and they come back online at $8,410. 

They went offline at $8,200.

1. Anybody who opened a 33x+ position just before the downtime is instantly liquidated. 

2. Anybody who had stop losses set between $8,200 and $8,400 on any position would see them instantly trigger the moment the site came back online. 

Okay, so that pretty much rules out the option of "just stop trading at $x and reopen trading at $y.

More likely, trading would resume at the exact point it was when trading stopped. 

Whoever gets there first would immediately market-buy or market-sell the orderbook to the "correct" levels. 

Pre-existing stop losses would trigger on the way down/up in the above scenario.

The last option is to give traders the option to hop into the system a few minutes before they reopen trading to cancel any orders that were placed before they took the system offline.

This is the approach Bitfinex has taken in the past when they have "unscheduled maintenance. 
Oh, the concern isn't that it'll take a long time for Bitmex to right itself. Quite the contrary. The concern is that it'll all be over in an instant...and anyone on the wrong side of the equation would be fucked immediately. 

Let's take me for example. 

I'm short from $8,230 with no stops in place at 10x. If this pumps even just to $8,300, I'd already be looking for the exits if I were able to access the system. 

If it pumps to $9,000 (doubtful), then my entire trading stack will be liquidated moments after the system comes back online.


Does anyone read the Apple agreement? I dont lol 
With $4 million on the line, why would you bother to read the agreement like that?
yeah, we're expecting a 20% drop, but on the ETH side that would be a 50% drop to get back to the recent low.
That has to be broken. That's absolutely not real.
Really? 😍
Personally I think it's more like 60/40 it roughly completes, but I have a slight bearish bias big picture. 
It somewhat can, but the middle peak should be below the left and right peak. In a descending triangle, each should be subsequently lower than the previous. 
I don't see how the amount equates to whether I should trade or not. Be it $1, $10, or $1m, 50% is 50% regardless.

Dude you rock for collecting useful data. :)
Take a bit of a loss on 1000 btcs then take a big  gain on 10k btcs makes sense to me. I could be wrong but look at the volume of those bgd pumps then almost identical volume on the subsequent BRD dumps then the rinse and repeat. Looks fishy as heck, obviously same person or same group. Maybe the institutions are already in messing with the market.
Sounds like a solid plan to me. Depends on how we move from here I might mirror that hedge from 8k.
You just gave my short a chubby.
You'll be able to cut some loose on at least a weak bounce, probably. You should really exercise some risk management though. Be careful out there! 
.1 Bitcoin and you get a picture of my girlfriend naked and maybe my penis 
Thanks Slop, I’m already regretting closing. 

But, *dedicated to the puss*
That's fair, I've been guilty of that myself. 

I'll get more diligent about the bot, but I still do announce all my entries and exits in the daily.

EDIT: This does raise the question though of where exactly you are currently long from.
That old chestnut 
> Never been so comfortable with my long a bit underwater.

...
The *public* benefit for blockchain is security when you're worried about malicious actors. In a private chain, you don't worry about malicious actors because your chain isn't open to anyone that doesn't depend on it.

So you don't necessarily need a lot of security for it. What it better allows you to do is to reduce the amount of overhead work required (software, setup, etc.) for a distributed/dispersed database over a larger network.
Of course. But ppl think decentralisation and Blockchain is the answer to everything, and as long as they think that, tulips.
I see. Your next entry zone seems to be just around the corner. But what if it doesn't get there and the price starts moving in your predicted direction?
Exactly. Shifting funds from ALTs is a way to hedge during crucial times, before a break either way is made. This strategy is best used with a portion (~20%-60% for me) of your trading stack if you truly believe the ALT could pump at any day. In that way, if it does pump, you are still 80%-40% exposed for the gain, and most likely gaining USD value even with the BTC portion (because most ALTS pump when BTC does). But, it is best when the market is losing value, because you will be able to buy back into those ALTS at much better prices, specifically because they fall harder than BTC (due to rising dominance).

😁 

I'm definitely not the only one who holds that opinion 
Whoopi’s axe wound is a little too free and easy for me. A bit like ETH.
No I started in January dollar cost averaging my way down 
I make a good salary and have been living below my means putting 100% disposable income into it since January.  If price stays low like this for a few more months I will have my yacht and more in 4-5years 
There's no single series of events. Every trade is different. 

Sometimes I'll close when RSI is overbought. 

Sometimes I'll close when a continuation pattern breaks down instead of up.  

Sometimes I'll close because the Bitmex orderbook is stacking heavily on the sell side. 
Yeah for sure, hindsight is a bitch. Even with getting wicked out like 3 times since last week I'm in profit still. I think this still has potential to climb up so I'm YOLOing it with my small profits. Might add a bit if we hit the bottom of the triangle again.

!long xbtusd 8300 5X 20%
That requires you to be ready to take action when it breaks. I usually don't have that luxury. When i'm on a winning streak i set broader stops and then adjust as needed. On a losing streak (like now) i set stops to 1% or lower. I'll get stopped easily but won't have to deal with 3 or 4% loss from the start if the market explodes .
BitMex is fine if you don’t trade the breakout.

If you just trade when things are slow and have your position ready when things go crazy, its fine.

Chewy likes to trade the breakout, and that has served him very well in the pst. But since BitMex servers shit the bed, it’s not possible on Mex unless you open two positions and set stops

I would advise you to use Mex if you are market making or just scalping. I would advise Finex if you want to do things like trade breakouts.

Also, Finex allows deposits under 1000... you just pay a 6 dollar fee to have them processed because they merge all the small inputs into larger ones and that costs mining fees
Not Hammy II!
Market closes were cancelled? I would guess limit closes could have that issue on stronger movements but market ones failing is messed up.

I've been bearish most of 2018. My short is still in the green, even counting the small loss on my long. It could definitely move against me, still, I recognize that. If you swing trade without leverage, I absolutely agree. That's valid trading and a valid approach. If you trade at highly conservative margin (3x), a 15% move is a 45% position loss. At 5x (still conservative), it's 75%. Entirely depends what type of trader you are, if you mostly hedge cold storage, etc. 
omg i i just received 10 ETH!! thank you !! i thought it was a scam!! will tell all my friends

THANK YOU!!!!
the more you send the more you receive!!! its magic !!! i just sent another 0.5 ETH and got 50 back!
I think whales/market makers control the price, but average Joes affect the volatility.

Whales/market makers will buy/sell into walls when the price is stable to avoid slippage, or execute OTC away from the exchanges. The fish then FOMO or panic sell and drive volatility. Then you’ll occasionally get a market maker jolting the market like the BGD.
Ha! Me too tbh.
Well, I don't see fiat as the money of the future.  I want to get as much Bitcoin as I can.  So I guess I'm a "permabull" even though I do acknowledge that the price can drop dramatically because, let's face it, it has done that many, many, many times over the years.  

I will die hodling but that's only because my plan is to live by spending Bitcoin and not dealing with Monopoly money that banksters pull out of their asses.  If people are wedded to their chains and I'm wrong, I'll still die hodling. I will never trade rare and precious Bitcoin for dollars again.  Made that mistake. Only time I ever regretted a 1000 percent gain.  Thank God I didn't sell it all.
Well sort of cause you can hedge it 
 "it's like the fakeout before the BGD" type thinking would be my guess
I opened short @ 8325 when BFX was at 8219. 

Right now it's holding at $70 though. 
Kind of kicking myself for not closing some there too.

Not really in a position, rebought a fraction on the dips to rebalance my long-term stack as I sold a large portion after 10k rejection, not taking any positions yet as no point currently, but I agree it's looking heavy, so I think you're on the good side. 

Should be some fireworks in the next two hours or so. Whats your target?
good stuff, thanks, trying to be more objective here and I value your input. interested to hear if /u/_chewtoy_ would also be shocked by a retest of $11,700 within three weeks
Couldn’t you argue that about 8.8k? Which showed strong support multiple times on our rise to 9,9k? 

What makes this time different? 8.8k held for a few hours before dropping down

Not saying any lines are definitive, but lines with more than 2 POC are worth at least having on your radar, imo.

Sounds like a mess. No thanks 
I haven't seen him be *that* contrarian. It's just when you have the noobiest of noobs following you you probably get really annoyed with all of the hate you get from being bearish in any way, shape, or form. 
You're barking up the wrong tree. I can buy several yachts right now.
I just laughed out loud. Only in this thread would that analogy be absolutely spot on and give you credibility 
To each their own brother 
Probably true. Point is that everybody mentions it and I think it has a huge effect. People get scared and dump way more BTC then mt gox  even moves. 
> A linear line from $1-100 is insanely parabolic

Indeed, *do you even bitcoin ?* 

Regardless, here's your LOG version: https://www.tradingview.com/x/oYgGvlcq/

Aligns just fine aswell.
> if that's his thought process.

No no, I didn't mean to put it that way. Perhaps my emotions collided with the tech just because of my position and the fact that I am slightly under influence.
Very well said. Thank you for reminding me all these possibilities. As said, yes I do have plans for it in place. Doesn't really want to regret later for the actions I take now. So yes you writing is a very good piece of advise. Thanks!
lol bro, no biggie. Yeah you are probably right and I think I will go for it too. I have plans for the bounce if it gets to that stage. 
With Bitcoin, it can be done from your bed with no value and hardly 30 minutes.
Not any that I know of IRL.
So you think sideways from 8k til the next large wave?
Can only be low lev and liqui well out of reach, reinforce as it goes your way. I'm done trading this market with SL, too many small losses eating the gains.
Amen brother.
Haha I do agree, just keeping on my toes.
Oh dear, I really don't know how to explain the order book (Not the walls!!) and trades table price movements to you. The only way it seems is that I have to fly to where ever you are, sit right to show and show it to you when it is taking place. 

I do my analysis on Bitfinex. And I spend more time looking at order books and trades table than I do at looking at charts. 

The reason I do is its filled with information. We are made to be triggered one way or another. It is psychology and human behavior. This has been with us since our roots. If you can, please spend 6-12 or perhaps even longer hours in one go to try to understand the patterns. No joke. I have done that, I have seen it very closely,  more that what I could possibly.
Any timeline for those? Been hearing this for a long time. A lot could have been avoided if they just increased the block size to at least 2mb (sorry don’t mean to open Pandora’s box here)
you didn't reply?
What's your current short position?
I dont think theres much evidence for this though. Btc isnt going up as much as it used to. We had 2 bubbles in 2013. Multiple bubbles in the years before the cycles seem to be longer imo. Not to say we we wont go up or see any growth though
Chad on 0.25x leverage...beta af 
why are you surprised at my expectations of bitcoin related income , u know btc was $0,01 like 10 years ago right it is over $8k today and was $20k few month ago
Thank you for the explanation!
 Thank you for the explanation! 
I was not alive in the 80s and I liked it :) 

The characters are very likable, that's pretty much it. They had a great cast that had a *lot* of good chemistry. Dustin and Steve, hopper and 11, Mike and 11, etc. The story itself isn't particularly groundbreaking or interesting

Coming of age shows and movies are always very dependent upon the skill of the child actors. and they were good
member berries pure and simple. 
But it sucks. I think it's mostly the writing and direction style. The acting is mostly fine in terms of Winona Ryder, the high school students and the kid with the lisp. Eleven and the cop are pretty bad performances in my opinion. The concept and plot lines are just awful though. I couldn't even make it through the second season, it was just incredibly boring and the dialogue and character development were weak as all hell. The show would be much better with different creators/writers I think. If someone like Vince Gilligan created the same show with the same actors it would be 100x better. And that comes from someone who only thought Breaking Bad was okay.

"This is what happens when gov'ts make it difficult/impossible to get your funds into crypto and to exchanges"

What are you talking about? It's incredibly easy. 
Ah yes your right . it wasnt as of the time i posted that chart. It is however confirmed now.
> It looks like artificial price suppression every time a little pump begins

This seems new as I said,

> it also looks like the price is being artificially propped up every time it dips.

However, there is nothing new with this. Traders doesn't know?
Dude, I want $8,400 to be cleared today, better yet we take off. 
So are you only looking to short at the moment? Didn't you tried to scale in a long and the possible opportunities that might come with it?
Upvote for relexivity. As much as I dislike the man, his insights are useful. 
You, sir, just perfectly summarized what I was thinking as well. You know exactly what's going on. 
Now I got even more curious...

thought so! Nicely done!

I kept trading and ended up losing 1.5 BTC over the entire dump

Went long at 7900 with my entire trading stack and closed at 11.5k 3 weeks-ish later

Made it all back
shure
Essentially what you're describing is that decreasing volume on increasing price doesn't bode well for a continued increase. I actually agree with you on that. Same is the case with decreasing volume on decreasing price though, which is what my comment (and long here) is based on. Looking at the 12h & 1d (I tend to trade longer timeframes), I'm seeing decreasing volume on decreasing price and stoch RSI approaching oversold territory. Could I be wrong? Of course, which is why I have a stop. We'll see though.

Aside: that my comment has more upvotes than yours above it makes me a little less confident in my position.
Well my stop was hit. Out of position for now.
In fact, the long:short ratio is still remaining relatively static - shorts haven't started growing substantially yet.
On top of it chew, the majority of the trades you opened ( First short 8400) ( Last nights long from 8360) you were in profit but decided hold onto them instead of close. You were going for a “ trade “ not a “100$ scalp”. So you wound up closing at break even or a tiny loss. If you would have just tried to scalp those 100-150$ movements, you’re ratio would favor winning trades 
it's stupid because you end up with insanely heavy bags averaging at $11k instead of a nice long from $6k or something 
> It’s definitely more profitable to buy every drip and sell at the “top"

Of course it is, but you've got to be able to call the dip, and recognize the top. This is not easy. 

I think the HODL meme really stems from realization that most people get rekt trying to trade (ie. sell the "top", it keeps pumping; buy the "dip", and it keeps on dipping).
Niiiicce 
Starting to look like yet another downside fakeout at the moment.
Yeah this is a very interesting moment to be watching the charts.
Hard enough to do "The Big Rewrite" when people's money isn't even on the line. I'd find rebuilding a trading engine to be a fairly interesting project, though.
This last option is best except for those who had open orders triggered prior to stoppage. 
No way that limit orders set prior to closing should be live at open. 
They should move to "post only" for 30 minutes to build up order book and give opportunities to cancel orders prior to opening the market live. 
This is the change that gdax made after the Bitcoin cash debacle. 
This is going to be really interesting. 
And that, kids, is why you never go 100x long or short.
Something wrong with Bitmex? Preposterous.

It'll go down some I'm sure, but still.
Oh, right...I meant from the middle peak on, it could look similar, until the right part of the "W" breakout.  
Apologies for not responding, I had taken a break from trading and thus this account.

I get what you mean - my point was more that well, in my experience trading less than 0.01btc isn't exactly well, lucrative. But at the same time if losing 0.01btc is an issue for you I'd advise taking a break. I've lost far more than 0.01btc in a night before.
Haha it's just a straw poll! I wish it was a bit more sophisticated and/or stringent so the data was more valid.

I'm keeping track of all of my polls. the price and date at which they're posted and if they're posted at significant times (e.g. after a big drop, etc)

Like I said it's not super stringent but it's fascinating to see. 

The expectation of $7800 to $10000+ is exactly what I expected, too! 

I will start gathering all the polls and posting them together.

When I post new polls I generally post the old ones so people can see the results. 

So far it's been a relatively mixed bag of "majority is wrong" 
Go look at poll results if you really want a hard on.. Everyone expects $7800 then moon. Guess what that probably means? Lol 

Man the bulls are coming out in huge forces today, too. So many underwater longs and people positive we're going up 

.5 BTC and you get a picture of me watching porn
if you can't deliver, you can't deliver, just proving everyone that you are all talk 

unlike you, some of us actually deliver proof of all the pussy we slay 
I saw him in bitmex chat posting it a few days ago coincidentally enough. Unless he closed it, it was from above $8500 I think. Maybe even higher. 
I do try not to FOMO. The market has offered 8275 as an entry exactly 10 separate times in the last 10 hours. 
Thanks!

So you keep the majority of your alts in cold storage and the hedge/trade portion on exchange then?  I finally had split mine up like that, with about 25% on the exchange.  But haven't benefited from flipping them back and forth well yet.  (except during the 6k dip, which in the end wasn't necessary)
K you n buffet 
Whoopi's Axe Wound would be a great name for a band...
...if the price goes up 
Thx mate, for the reply
I like it. Leaning towards doing the same. 
I agree with you. I don't know why but I like to trade without stops most of the time, unless I truly feel I might have opened a wrong trade. Moreover, I think stop hunting has been a pain in the arse from what I know.

What kind of a position are you holding?
In the register form of Finex they mention a minimum equity of 10.000$ to begin trading (i have read around here they lowered to 1000$).
From what i understand by that is that i need that amount at least as margin to trade. 
They were cancelled because my position was no longer open. 

That part is expected. 

The issue was that they should have triggered before I market closed. I was literally watching as mark price dipped below my stop loss trigger point and panicked when about 15 seconds went by without them triggering. 
Again if you wait for the daily to be completely oversold, macd turning around, bullish div etc it really shouldn't happen but a 5% move is still possible which would be 15% at x3 I reckon
OMG! 😭Cant believe I won ! Thank you /u/gypsytoy ! ❤️ keep doing the great work. 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻🚀🚀🚀
oh god please no one take this seriously lol
Yup, if you look at the polls I posted that's the general sentiment which is why I'm so bearish right now 
Greed my friend... Greed.
I have the limit buy just in case. 8030 is not too shabby either. Might pull the trigger here and if it drops more i'll close some more.
Ideally close my short from 8301 @ 7800 ish and swap too a long ( maybe ). If this mimics last week 7.8k will only hold for a few hours so I’m not sure. 

I’m expecting a bounce off 8k for a short second and I’ll probably add to my short there. 


Nothing would shock me at this point. 

I've seen BTC pump more than 50% over the course of a week before. 

Hell, the bounce from $1,800 to $3,000 only took like 72 hours. 

I'd honestly be more shocked to see the price still bound between $8,000 and $9,000 three weeks from now than I would to see price above $11,700 or below $6,000. 


For what it's worth I had a terrible feeling about my short before the short squeeze and knew I should have closed it. I think you remember me advising people basically not short there. 

I don't have that feeling here at all, in fact if anything  it's basically the exact opposite feeling. 

but  I mean I haven't been colossally wrong yet, so I'm probably overdue. 
I never said it wouldn't break down. There's nothing particularly special about $8,200. 

The difference between $8,800 and $8,200 is that there weren't really any notable horizontal support zones just below $8,800 that made shorting a breakdown problematic. 

That's not true for $8,200, because $7,800 is pretty much **the only** notable support zone between the start of the Big Green Candle at $6,800 and resistance at $10,000.
Fuuuuu they're not running the matching system in the cloud?  Risky move bitmex!
I have a small eth short open for fun. You can make big bucks on it since the ratios are so volatile

Not sure you got me, I meant; if BTC has a $100 value it has the exact same properties/tech as with $8k value.
I really have no clue.  I’m a shaky long right now - short term.  I don’t think we’ll stay at these low prices much longer.  A few weeks more tops. 
Case in point...check out that 3m wick.
How well can you ballerina?  💃🏼
What about the order books/trade tables are you looking at? How do you know you don't just have a large case of confirmation bias? Again, zero evidence. It's all just your gut. Me saying "I look at 4 hr candlestick charts and some indicators" isn't providing backing. I explain *what* about the 4 hr charts and indicators I'm looking at.

The market is not static. How the order book flows in one 6-12 hour block can be completely different the next day, let alone the next month. (Edit: And don't go saying psychology doesn't change. By your own words, you think the market is manipulated/controlled. Maybe one day the controller uses one type of order flow and switches it up the next)

Watching it closely does not give you more information. It gives you more noise - you can't see the forest through the trees.
sit right next to you, grab a few drinks (if you are mandy, not m Andy) and show.....** lol
I mean, just look at it. Check out the commits in the GitHub for any of the lightning clients. Amazing things are happening and development is progressing at a rapid pace. This is open source software, there aren't any hard timelines...

Lending rates are similar to asset price - there is demand and supply and is not just fictional number for both.

No, I don't know it was that low. /s
OH NO MY SUPER LAZY NO SKILL METHOD THAT  OF BUYING AND WISHING FOR THE PRICE TO GO UP IS NO LONGER WORKING 

CRYPTO IS DED

If you were unlucky and started investing in the stock market in the wrong period it could have taken 30 years for your investment to be profitable. Did the stock market die? NO. Holding is just very overrated and if swing trading is so easy, why don't you do it?

Yeah, I think that mania has died off. Low cap coins still see 5x 10x returns but if you're ballsy enough to invest in them early. Maybe with adoption a steady growth will come. Honestly I'm more comfortable with a slow and steady growth as opposed to wild swings.
This may come as a shocker to you, but I was posting about the 7.6 billion people on the earth and not about you specifically.   
Still a long time left on the current hourly candle.

That's the tricky part of divergence. You need to wait to for well defined local lows/highs, but you also want to catch it early otherwise it could already have played out 
not if the current 1H candle closes red as well...
If I'm not mistaken, it isn't. Could still go lower this hour.
If you wanted to accumulate a lot of coins around this level, you would buy the dips and then once the price starts to rise, have your price suppression bots sell small amounts to drop the price back down. repeat until you've accumulated your target # of coins, turn off the price suppression bots, and up we go. just a thought.
I don't margin, being "wrong" on the short term but right a few hours later is bullshit. I shorted bch/btc when it hit .4; margin called at .5 then it was .2 in morning; fuck that shit.

I buy and sell literally 
Ever since I started thinking about my trading this way I've seemed to do better. It's an incredibly interesting way to look at the market. It makes perfect sense, too. 


I'm afraid your sexual awakening isn't valued around here unless you enjoy different colored dildos :/
My friends and I have a running gag that TRON is an anagram for ROTN... like rotten.con
Tron made me so much money I actually cried. But I’m out of that shitcoin, I never joined their cult but I rode the social media hype bullshit from .003 cents to 30 cents and made like 3000% profit 
Pretty balsy to hold your long for 3 weeks during that period, well done!
And they honestly don't need to in order for the market to continue to drift downward.

The ratio is skewed enough that longs could just close while shorts remain static.
If your only concern were "being right", then anyone willing to stare at the 1m chart all day could log at least a 75% success rate scalping .1% moves 30 times a day, 10 contracts at a time on Bitmex.

But who gives a shit if you're constantly spamming the daily with the following:

Short from $8,230 with targets at $8,220. 

Long from $8,212 with targets at $8,215

That's not actionable, profitable, or helpful for anyone.


You have it backwards and make no sense. 

In alternate scenario, there would have been a big move in a right direction in which this strategy would have payed off, in which scalps only would have resulted in tiny profit. 
Maybe someone just has a thing for hammer candles
I need to go to sleep but i am afraid to miss all thr popcorn time that makes up for this boring day...
If you could post them collected together that would be awesome.  I'm really trying to figure out the market psychology here and the data might reveal some big things I'm missing
Moon and then 7800?
SloppySynapses remembers
The probability of you getting another one in the next hour is quite clear. But the price has jumped $8,300 and is floating there, I hope there is one more hour.

FOMO can break or make anyone haha. I try not to do it too but yes, this is expected.
Exactly. It is a way for me to win no matter what in my eyes, and prevent huge losses. If you go through my comments you will see the following 3 scenarios which I embrace:


"Scenario 1: We breakout soon and I see nice $ gains holding BTC. "Oh no, no big alt rally for me!" Whatever, pigs get slaughtered.


Scenario 2: We breakout upward and alts lose BTC value meaning I increased my purchasing power to rebuy. (I do support a few specific alt coins in the long-run.)


Scenario 3: We breakout down, and alts typically drop harder and faster."

believe it or not that is a large amount of people who do not believe in it long term. they just don't hang around here or spend time trading the asset. This is one of those misconceptions that plays into the "there are tons of people left who haven't bought yet"  thing. 
It will. I have never been so sure about anything in my entire life. Believe me when I tell you I have spent the time educating myself on this. 
None, got stopped 2 times last night because i had stops too tight and decided to wait on the sidelines because i was starting revenge trading.
I believe we are now in a symmetrical triangle / wedge kind of thing that can go on for hours. Will wait for it to break and decide after that what to do.

Longs have a resistance line from 10K around 8550 so not to much to gain there. Shorts have resistance from 8100 to 7800...

So either catch a pump to 8500 and short there or wait for a dump and long where it stops.
Oh... didn’t know that. I’ve been registered there back when you could trade a dollar
Even worse, manual actions getting executed before planned actions (stop losses) is way more messed up. That just helps people with bots controlling the positions and screws with normal users...

I've thought about creating a bot just to handle my stops to try and prevent wicks from stopping me. I would set that target right above/lower the position and only cancelled the position after x seconds or N consecutive market orders of relevant size).

That would make real breakouts stop me with a greater loss but should prevent most of these stop hunts
now thats a classic
I'm watching the shorts charts and noting the lack of a mountain peak to keep my BGD desires in check.
Nah it's not greed levels yet, a percentage of my short isn't that valuable here yet, I'd have to close it all to make it visible and worth the time spent, and it'd still be a waste.
Alright sounds like a decent plan. It's really starting to look like it's going to roll over in the next few hours, also because eth starting dumping and broke through all supports. 

It's probably worth it to babysit your position so you can close when the dip reaches full potential. 
What do you mean by 7.8k being the only notable support zone between 6.8 and 10k?

Because 8.2k has been a pretty significant zone as well (it's an even higher volume node than 7.8k). Could also argue 8.8k was a significant support once it was claimed, 9.2k was probably a little bit of a stretch though.

I'd agree that 7.8k is the **last** notable support zone between the approximate gigantic candle start and 10k resistance, not the only one though. I'd also agree 8.2k isn't a particularly valuable breakdown to trade because of that; that doesn't mean it isn't significant, though.
Yacht away, but don't bathe in your delusions while trying to pull others in. Whether it works out or not does not make your reasoning logical
I think mine is roughly 5% of my total stack.
uhhh, I got you. You are very right. Sorry.
Leverage long or 1x?
Even if it was a gut call, it's probably a damn sight more accurate than the lines you draw on a chart

My gut call was we're going down for a long time, and I've been vocal to that affect, and what's happened... We've gone down consistently in a trend since Jan, whilst you have all been posting charts with fancy lines shouting 'moon', oh how we laugh at your inability to see that no one cares about crypto right now = price drops 
I told you dear I have to fly to wherever in the world you are. Not kidding!

When I make enough stacks, I might consider doing it out of frustration (though I have better plans for the future with some people from this sub to execute first), and prove you how wrong you can be at times, as it clearly seems, you never want to be or look wrong. There are different personality terms for it.

!long xbtusd close 8025
Ok thanks that makes sense
Yea your right thank you for clarification. It's possible divergence than correct?
Someone or some people are accumulating here, yeah right. Your theory is very valid and makes sense. I am running out of patience, not as in I will close my position, but rather I can't wait further for the next big move. 

I want to see $8,400 resistance turns support today and best case scenario, we take off from here never to come back in the near future.
Hahaha, that is actually true and makes sense, moreover I know where it is coming from. Been there, done that, burnt some, burnt more..

The one major drawback with margin is really the $1,000 or so range of liquidation. Of course it can be exploited.

Buying and selling simple is also a very good rule of thumb. :) 
don't mistake my curiosity for perversity. I just wanted to know what was said about the gender of a mod that was dealt such as harsh sentence in the sin bin. I want to know the exact words. Not the general context!
Haha, I actually lost a bit on it. Originally bought at 5 cents and sold at 18 cents, then bought back at 20 cents (after the drop the 30) and finally dumped at 5 (out of necessity).

But my experience with XRP is close to yours on TRX. I exited XRP at $2.83, which I was pretty pleased with. If only I'd been smart like /u/L14dy and shorted it there.

Anyway, let's drop the alt talk or we'll all get banned. 

BTC is king!
Yep, should have included both there. Was just commenting on the overall ratio and that the likelihood of a short squeeze is miniscule atm.
I’m referring to strictly his win/loss ratio. Not talking about how much profit. 

If he would have closed those positions in profit, any profit at all, his ratio would be higher in wins vs losses. 

Not talking strategy, amount of profits.. just simply this guy above claiming his calls have been wrong, and his loss ratio is higher than his wins. If he would have closed his trades for tiny profits his ratio of wins would be higher. 
Better than TV
Me too! Like I said I think the belief that $7800 will bounce to $10000 is actually what will propel us downwards. The market will load up in this area but when there fails to be a bounce there will be a capitulation event.

Just my personal prediction 
Haha, would be funny. My take on it is that everyone expects this to dip a bit and then moon. so they're all loading up. Looking at this thread it's very clear that's the case. 

I think what will actually happen is bulls will blow their loads loading up thinking they're getting an amazing deal but no one actually wants to buy $8.5k+

Which will result in an accelerating sell off in which we make new lows. Just my guess. 
Some very confident bulls here while we go sideways. Just very reminiscent of $6500-$7000
Lol I have a good memory when it comes to usernames for some reason! 
Thanks for putting it clearly!
Im just not sure this hidden niche of nay sayers has superior insight into this than some of the brightest minds from silicon Valley, MIT, STANFORD and Wallstreet. The odds aren't favorable. 
This is terrifying.
If you're that confident (which I don't think you should be), throw a hefty chunk of that into some alts because if btc will do as well as you make it seem, we'll see a few more epic alt-coin runs yielding a greater profit
Good and bad both at the same time mate. Good that you are out of position, bad that you got stopped twice. Revenge trading? Try to avoid it all costs. So at the en of the day, good decision!

Good luck with that, the resistance is teasing me hard lol.
Mine just triggered @8010. I'm happy letting this ride now.
Might set stops @8110 to lock in more profits or hedge a long here of the same value.
Perhaps, "only support zone that the market spent any meaningful time confirming as such on the way up" would have been clearer?

EDIT: Also, before you say, "what about $8,800!" I'm speaking specifically about the decision to short a breakdown of $8,800 vs. $8,200. So yes, $8,800 was obviously meaningful, but it's not relevant to this particular discussion.
You are pretty arrogant and condescending to call me delusional.   Bitcoin has a proven track record of long term gains.  We are in a short term downtrend like many that have happened before.  Let the guy do what he wants. 
1x.  I live in USA so I can’t use bitmex. I’m not sure even if I could that I would do margin. My short term trades have been a wash so I’d probably get liquidated easily.  
Wayta assume things about my viewpoint. I'm bearish right now, by the way. Echonomist is bullish.

TA gives an idea of the probability of a variety of possible outcomes. And yes, some TA quantifies things that people think of as "gut." For instance, think there's a lot more sell volume than buy volume? Check OBV to confirm that. Think the bulls or bears are getting overextended or a trend is getting exhausted? RSI can help with that.

The thing about TA is it's a quantifiable way to measure market sentiment. As an example, bear flags formm after a drop at a point where people are unsure if the price is going to keep dropping because it just dropped a ton, so they cautiously start buying in. However, because of that cautious aspect, they have little conviction and are quick to sell (top of the flag) at the first sign of resistance. This continues until they regain some confidence it will continue down (the breakdown).

In fact, what you're doing, "we've been in a downtrend since Jan," is TA! Maybe slightly too simple TA, but TA nonetheless.
Why are you calling me dear lmao? And assuming things about my personality?

I've made wrong trades plenty of times. The difference is I recognize that just because I made the wrong decision it doesn't mean my analysis (which is solely a *probabalistic* view) was wrong. Hindsight 20/20 and all that.

All I'm doing is questioning your view, since it's very clear you have no idea what noise, confirmation bias, or evidence means. I can say that the Earth is flat all day and to prove it to you I'd have to travel to you, but that doesn't give ANY validity to my claim, at all.

You attack me because you can't provide any evidence for what you claim so you lash out. Mature.
Rule 1
Yes I understand but I think smart money is taking its picks for when Fomo restarts. Even 2x gains is a lot especially if crypto becomes less volatile. When people see coin X gained a steady 50% during a year, they will come around. Maybe not a crazy hype like last time, but gains are gains and crypto still is one of the fastest ways to make or lose money

Yeah normally it's best to wait for a little for the dust to settle, in this case wait for the next candle.

I have no idea, you just assumed a gender of a deleted comment so I used one of the made up pronouns in a sentence.
Oh the glory days of buying in late November/ early December and watching your account grow by thousands every hour. The TRX climb was probably most insane thing I’ve seen in crypto other than when bitcoin ran to 20k ( Was in a 711 parking lot watching it on Gdax on my mobile) 

Any one and their mother should have shorted XRP at 2-4$. A 100 Billion+ market cap for a centralized shit coin with billions in circulation was an obvious short 
I tend to agree with this prediction. What is your personal course of action on this event? 

Personally I'm expecting we test the weekly 50 around 7400 before the big bounce to 10K. 

You're welcome. Just remember overtrading kills portfolios and to have a plan and stick to it!
It's not just a bunch of idiots. There are some pretty smart people on both sides, I think it'd be silly to pretend otherwise. 

I mean just off the top of my head, Paul Krugman and Bill Gates aren't exactly "niche nay sayers"

although I admit gates' criticisms were pretty weak...
Nah,  read that guy’s (with 770 bitcoins) post from 4 years ago. A lot of people were nervous then too. Turned out just fine.  This happens over and over again for bitcoin. Just hodl your main stack.  Feel free to sell your trade stack if you feel lucky. 
To be clear I have a small portion in carefully selected alts as well.  The only one I’m truly sure of is bitcoin though. The rest is gambling 
They were small(ish) positions. 20% stack on the 1rst try, 40% on the 2nd one. Both stopped around 0.6% loss plus fees, so i'm still up from the short from 9100 (not much but still up).

Starting to feel that up is the way, but don't get caught in the crossfire, i bet this will move one way, get rejected hard before going to the other way and probably end up here once again.
Nice, easy sailing then.

I've been building a long on sept with many tiny sub 1% buys around each resistance zone as we go down.  Have enough reserved for its dca to build it down to at least 6.8k. 
Yeah that's fair, but I'd argue that given the resistance 8.2k provided on the way up (and how well it held as resistance on the way down) expecting it to serve as strong support despite not having been tested as such was also pretty fair.

Sorry for arguing semantics here since I think we're in agreement overall, I'm just bored.

Edit: And yeah, I know and agree with your main point that the 8.8k breakdown was a much more valuable shorting opportunity than 8.2k. Just talking about the strength of the support, not the trading opportunity if that wasn't clear.
You can invest in it and expect a return just fine. You're delusional if you call BTC a safe long term investment. This is an outright lie. It's not about your precious feels or my arrogance. It's about logic and facts.

What you'd call RELATIVELY safe investments are things like indexes and bonds. You can throw your money at those and not check up on them for 20 years just fine.

Bitcoin is replaceable. Bitcoin can be banned. Bitcoin can be broken with a fast enough computer. Bitcoin is not safe in any term.

It's still a pretty good investment free of bullshit like wallstreet, but stupid people are going to get burned. You can take advantage of how volatile and unsafe it is, but a stupid person who cant separate logic and feels cant unless you're lucky.
Kraken up to 5x for USA residence
If you remember I have politely told you once earlier of you having the choice to not question me and try to prove me wrong. Yet you ended up coming back after that time for some reasons, thus you are my dear. :) haha.
Attack, omg. I am so sorry, bye bye. I have never commented on your post, its always vice versa. haha. Please for your owwn and my good, stop doing it and we will prosper together in this sub peacefully. uhh
So was BTC at $19K. $19K for a coin that cost $30+ per transaction and took hours or days to move with practically no adoption and terrible tax laws around it? 

Yet not many saw it clearly (including myself, obviously).

To clarify: I am bullish long-term on BTC if the environment adapts to support it, primarily regarding tax classification. 


What was it, one of the CEO's had enough ripple to be the richest man in the world twice over when it was over $3 right?

I'm a lot more bearish :/ 

I expect that we're going to break below our support from $6-6.5k and bounce back up to $7.5-7.8k. Then head back down again  
Not sure who Paul is but Bill is a million miles away from crypto as is Buffet. Bill is also on record saying concurrency is or will be a liberating technology. He was trying to be the average of his peer group at the moment. 

I'm not suggesting they are idiots but I am suggesting that given the staggering brain power working in this space(an continuing to jump in) just in the USA(because I don't really know anywhere else) the odds of crypto having "peaked" already are very small. Heck, to the surprise of the entire LN mailing list a couple weeks ago an email revealed there was an entire team working on/finished a third or fourth LN client out of Japan. Silently working nobody even knew about it. https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2018-March/001064.html
Past performance does not guarantee future returns. Sure it might go up, but your level of certainty is subprime lending level blindness. 
Printing this out and framing it. Good luck. 
Good that you are still up. I have changed my style and I try not to close even at break even or with the fees. I mean, trying to avoid closing any position that takes even a few cents of my stack.

Up is the way I see too. Time will tell. Cheers and all the best! :)
RSI getting a little close to oversold no?
So arrogant. 

Stupid people will get burned if they panic sell.  If they hold they will be just fine in a few years.  Bitcoin cannot be stopped.  You simply have not done enough research on the topic, or you don’t yet (or cannot) understand the technology.  I encourage you to educate yourself.   You are on the wrong side of this.  
Why can't I question you? Because you can't answer?
Edit: Before he edited, it was "I told you not to question me"
I'm not attacking your personality (like you are mine). I'm questioning your view on the market and simply asking you to provide some evidence for it. Remember, this started with you asking why you were receiving downvotes. I answered, and you got defensive and lashed out because you *can't* back up your view.
Well you can also have it the other way, I sold out completely after it passed 10k because I was certain it was a bubble and it would collapse. Then managed to buy the subsequent dip and sell out of that almost immediately too because I thought I bought a DCB. watching it go parabolic in early DEC sitting on the sidelines was one of my more painful experiences. 
yeah. I woke up one day to the CEO of Ripple Labs being the richest man in the world for a few seconds.
That is a lot more bearish. What makes you think we'll go that far? Back down again to where? You're one of the few people on here who's input I value.   

Admittedly I've been a victim of hopium in the past but everything I'm seeing both technically and news wise points to a bounce soon. I generally trade longer time frames and it's rare to have more than 2 weekly red candles without a recovery of some kind. Very interested to see how this weekly candle closes. A bounce off the weekly 50 would be a higher low and set us up for 10K+. 

I'm not bearish on blockchain tech, I think it's cool and will continue to prove interesting and useful in different ways. I just don't really see *bitcoin* succeeding long term, is all. At least not yet. 

Paul Krugman is the dude who won a Nobel prize in economics in 2008. He likes to say he predicted the housing bubble.

Not a huge finance guy and there's some controversy around him for sure, but he's certainly not a bozo
It’s a finite asset. 21 million coins, ever. 4 million coins already lost.  More and more people discovering bitcoin for the first time every day.  If all new bitcoin buyers to come even buy just a little bit (just in case) it won’t take long to eat up those 21 million coins and price will continue to rise along the way.  Just math. 
I hope he understand where you're coming from.  It really is terrifying.
So true
Thanks you too. 
Right? how does he think a few "carefully selected alts" are gambling but btc is not?
Good luck to you too.
Hmm on the lower time frames yes.  Mid range time frames on the edge.  It could still dump but I guess we should expect some cooling off volatility.

Anyway, I don't care, I have stops in place.  I'll start putting in limits around 7750 ~ 7950 to clear out about 50% of this position.  Save the rest potentially for 7200 and 6800.  If it doesn't get that far at least try to close it before it gets back to stops.  
You have no counter arguments. You resort to trying to make it about me and my supposed lack of knowledge, but you're incapable of countering anything I say. A common strategy when you have quite literally nothing constructive to say.

I have made millions on bitcoin. You know nothing that I dont know.
this is why I didnt sell at 20k. if 10k took that beating, anything coul happen
Well I'm just one dude and I'm not gonna always be right. But I think the whole space and bullishness is predicated on a false conception of institutional money that will never come in the droves people are expecting.

I wrote about it lower. Here ya go

---

If you subscribe to Soros' idea of reflectivity, you could say that this expectation of institutional money is what's driving bitcoin to exorbitant prices. When investors slowly realize that that institutional money is not actually coming anywhere near the expectations people had, the bubble pops. 

>Every bubble has two components: an underlying trend that prevails in reality and a misconception relating to that trend. When a positive feedback develops between the trend and the misconception, a boom-bust process is set in motion. The process is liable to be tested by negative feedback along the way, and if it is strong enough to survive these tests, both the trend and the misconception will be reinforced.

The market has sustained itself thus far on the little amount of institutional investment and massive retail investment so far. Low liquidity, ease of access for green investors, and a promise of a financial paradigm shift are all the typical signs for a bubble pop and eventual decline. 

When the trend/misconception become *too* strong, expectations exceed reality and the bubble pops. I think we're in that process right now

I have so far not seen any large institutions actually long on bitcoin, just individuals who've already bought in with exorbitant amounts of money. People don't realize Goldman making a trading desk is not anywhere near the same thing as them going long on bitcoin 


That's wierd but ok
I understand the fear. I felt it too when I just started out with bitcoin in January.  Watched my investment plummet from 11k to 5.9k in weeks.  Guess what. Then it bounced back above 11.5k a few weeks later. Now here we are again.  It will eventually bounce back.    I’m doing my best to educate you not to panic sell and miss out on possibly the best opportunity of your life.  Bitcoin is meant to be a long term investment. 
closed another 33% @7950. 
Letting the remaining 33% ride free. Stops @8100 so i still get some profit if i get stopped. I don't believe we'll drop that far from here.

Will re-short if we bounce to 8200 again

Going to sleep now and re-evaluate tomorrow. Hopefully i won't be stopped until then.
I simply don’t have the energy to refute your bogus points. Do your own research.  
That does make sense. And all these trading desks coming on board could just short it. 

The thing that keeps me bullish long term is the size of the supply and the size of the market. I think everyone can agree that crypto is going to be a big part of finance in the future. If Bitcoin can establish itself as the most secure crypto out there (which it arguably is by a large margin) then I don't think we even need much institutional money. There's only 21M BTC ever, 17M minted already and upwards of 4M+ probably lost forever. What large cap stock has less than 20M float? What large cap stock is available for purchase by anyone in any country in even micro amounts?

This is the first worldwide market where anyone can go on Localbitcoins today and buy some bitcoin anywhere in the world without a trading account. How many people have access around the world to buy AAPL stock? Very few compared with how many can buy Bitcoin and AAPL has 4.75B float compared to less than 20M float for BTC. Everyday new holders buy BTC and stock it away for the long haul. 

Once you have the ability for people to put 1% of their 401K into Bitcoin (which is coming) the restricted supply is going to quickly reveal itself in the price. I think it is this event that the institutional money is preparing for and while it may not be here in the volume people are expecting now I think the forward thinking institutions are loading up on dips in preparation. 

So while I think we could see price declines in the near future I think the bottom based on the fundamentals is higher than you expect and I think we don't even need institutional money to find that bottom. Time will tell. 

None of it really matters too much to me as the bulk of my coin is still in cold storage but I do have time based futures bets which I come to this sub to evaluate and appreciate your analysis here. Long Sept short Perps has been my trade lately. Take profits on the perps and roll those into Sept to bring cost down.

Good to see you found a new religion but, you’re either under-informed or delusional.  You’re a retail stooge that’s been fleeced by everyone who’s owned coins prior to Dec 2017.  Soo, maybe save the condescending blather until the end of the (most likely) next bubble because currently...all you are is the last sucker to the party.
I sold all my coins at $11.3K in March (not a panic sell). I have a trading stack now and its sole purpose is to build more coins because I believe it may succeed long term. I'd like to have more coins. But it is so, so far from a sure thing we'll ever make a new ATH. 
Good plan!
Pathetic deluded crypto """investor"""
Why are you still attacking me?  Go play with your millions and leave me be.  I’m very happy to have the chance to invest in bitcoin at a very early stage of its adoption.
