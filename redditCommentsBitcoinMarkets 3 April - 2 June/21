Happy Mother's Day, you degenerates.  Make sure to go call your mom between your chart watching. Peace (and you're welcome).
If you believe we are still in a distribution phase, or believe that $7.8k is right around the corner, then shorting/moving to fiat makes sense to me. 

However, to consider the alternative, if we are in an accumulation/reaccumulation phase, the sells/shorts are being used by accumulators to reduce slippage for their buys. (Price won’t rise as high, which is what you want if you're accumulating) I’ve been looking over the BFX data, and for transactions over 1 BTC, I see mostly buys (usually clusters totaling to 20-50 BTC) while for smaller transactions I see mostly sells. Perhaps this is indicative of retail investors selling while bigger players make sneaky buys. Or, maybe it’s just a coincidence and we are indeed headed much lower. 

Just what I’m seeing, and full disclosure I’m in a long. 

Edit: also, go call your mothers you filthy animals 
This latest mini dip was mainly a huge market seller on finex. https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/volume/1h?c=e&t=b for one minute finex had more volume than all other exchanges combined by a good chunk. Fat finger maybe.
Today's expensive trading lesson. If you miss the right entry point, no matter how much it sucks, you're better off just riding the market in either btc or fiat until there is a clear direction than trying to get into position and getting chopped up.

Fortunately ended up in the right side of the break upwards so in a better position now. 
LOL this sub is so manic depressive
My take on it. We're still in the same bear flag pattern as the last week:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/w03Ix0tp/

 I won't be buying in until the pattern breaks. You can see ETH on the right twice had drops so large it escaped the channel and both times it went right back into it. It's more or less traveling on the same rise as it did on the 7th. Both BTC and ETH are high on the gains right now, but I think FOMO is kicking in, so that should be expected.
If you believe the trend is up since 6.5k, we now have a massive hidden bull div on the daily and could see some fireworks. Next target would be 9.2k.

Chart slightly outdated, I'm on mobile :

https://www.tradingview.com/x/drVY7bQa
don't you guys think that soon we will have a big move one way or another?

https://imgur.com/a/QJUr8tW
According to this accumulation/distribution pattern we should have a small low\-volume rally before we drop further? Or was this already the rally from 9k to almost 9.4k?
Thoughts on longing rat poison if it breaks upper trend line of the bear pennant we seem to be in? Upper trend line sits around $8.600 at this moment (finex).
Closed my 8375 long posted a few hours ago at 8560. I was thinking there is a possibility to blow straight through 8650, it seems unlikely. My guess is we go sideways for some more time before a big move is made. I’m gonna stay out of position here since I’ve scalped enough gain at this level that It doesn’t matter much what direction we go. 

Personally, I think we have stayed this high due to alt FOMO. I don’t see any alt popping (atleast for today) after this last months run up, alt volume has dried up significantly.
This could be super stupid, but I have limit sells on the rest of my stack. Half of it has now been sold. Seems like a good time to take profit while its on the rise. Potential to miss out on gains is there, but I'm going all in on this being a fakeout. 

We'll see in the next week  if I'm crying or not.
I hold 0 btc, I realize now that that is pretty shortsighted and stupid. I want to take 30% of my holding and put them back in btc. A week ago when we were getting close to 10k all my alts where in the green but now thats not the case. I was wondering if I should make the move to btc now or wait for some of my alts to go back to breakeven 
A simple bullish/bearish/neutral poll:

https://www.strawpoll.me/15692388

Yet another straw poll, I love seeing this sub's sentiment because the majority is actually right every once in a while.

Would love to track it randomly with these polls.

Also old poll results when we were at ~$9.3k after hitting $9990 3 days ago. 

**Please do not vote on this poll:** https://www.strawpoll.me/15672326/r

When I post this, it will have been:

37, 31, 19 to bullish, neutral, bearish respectively.


Bitcoin what have you done?
The 1000+ BTC buy wall is back in finex.

If this wall moves up with the price then expect a pump, these were the characteristics of the last 1000+ buy wall at 6500, that acted like a cushion and kept  the momentum.

It may disappear but if it reappears as the price starts dropping, it's likely to be the same thing. 

On the other hand, it could get pulled completely, never return and initiate a dump.

My advice, keep an eye on the wall and buy price of it. 
Seeing an ascending triangle on the 4 hr.  Personally expecting a pop to 8900-9100, then back down.  Ichi flipped red.  Stoch RSI is up there, I expect RSI to continue up to ~50 then start heading back down with this move.  I'm not in a position ATM but if it works out like this I'll likely go short.  

Still fairly new at this, any comments/tips?  

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/E1A0qtYZ/

Edit: Said wedge, turns out it's a triangle.  
!long XBTUSD close 8618   
It looks to me like we are forming a pretty aggressive upward channel after the local bottom around 8.2k.  Also you might be able to argue that we also confirmed a double/triple bottom with a target around 9k?  Not sure if it will actually play out so optimistically, but I'm cautiously bullish.

sorry for my shitty chart skill:
[chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/eXvJ2Pvo/)

edit: corrected chart.
Went ahead and closed out half of 5x my long from 8.4 that I opened on Friday. Not really sure where things go from here, but I've been bad about taking profits lately so I'm going ahead and doing it here (have had multiple chances to close my 3x LTC futures ratio long from a few weeks ago at 50%+, and instead wait and see it dip back down under 10%... I swear I'll close it next time it hits my target) 
Longs going up and price is going down big time. Uhhh doesn't look good.

https://i.imgur.com/bCpOyAV.png
We're not even oversold on anything over 15m yet, either. Technical bounce off 8350ish is almost a given unless the honeybadger comes out.  

https://www.tradingview.com/x/XuU6SbMV/  

That's quite the parabolic dump. Futures premium disintegrated as well. I'm short, and I went stupid heavy at what I thought was a key entry, but that far exceeded my expectations. Good lord.

edit to add: Came across this old support line which we blasted through. Will be interesting if this flips to serve as resistance.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/LzXP04P7/
So guys I'm back after having around 3 weeks away from crypto, I felt it was really taking over my life and killing my time management for other things like studying, socialising and sleeping. I stayed 100&#37; in bitcoin for the whole time and only checked the price a few times.

I really recommend to anyone who thinks crypto is becoming too stressful and consuming to just take a step back for a few weeks or so. I, like many here, believe bitcoin is here to stay for at least the foreseeable \(10 years?\), so whats the worst that could happen from taking a little break, there will be plenty more opportunities to catch the dip or sell the top in the future, and god damn it feels good not having that stress on your mind all the time.

For what its worth, from someone who hasn't been trading for the past few weeks, I've seen a lot of those 'good' news stories about these famous, high\-profile organisations/investors saying "muh bitcoin is the future, bla bla bla", and all these firms saying they're going to start investing in crypto. This is good and all, but I would think these people involved have their own interests in mind, and they would only publicise all this good news at a time when they felt was best. E.g. Soros a few weeks ago announced his firm would start crypo investing. I think its safe to say his firm started investing long before they actually publicised it, as this would be the most beneficial way for him. The same could be said about the numerous other high\-profile people who are now all praising bitcoin. Basically all these big names have a vested interest to make the most money as possible, and entering when there is blood in the streets, and hyping something up at the top of what could be just a larger DBC would be there best option. Not to mention we've had pretty good news for weeks by the looks of it and it all seems to be dying down now \- plus whole Upbit drama.

This being said, these big players could simply just be prepping bitcoin for another big run, and the bear market may truly be over, but its still far too early for that claim aswell.

I've heard about this Consensus 18 happening in the next week \(i think?\), and wouldn't be surprised if this is another buy the hype, sell the news sort of event. Just searching Consensus Bitcoin on Google and you'll find the first result states, "Consensus 2018 will be the next big catalyst for Bitcoin, Analysts says". Seeing these sorts of things leads me to believe one thing: unless something miraculous happens for bitcoin, we will see a sell\-off once Consensus is over.

As I said I haven't been looking at this daily thread for weeks now, so I'm not even sure what the sentiment is like on here; I guess I will find out by the amounts of upvotes/downvotes.

Edit: grammar and spelling
**Position bot update**

Ok guys, migration seems to have gone smoothly. All should be working as usual (or better).

Changes:

* New site [https://www.anotherbot.info](https://www.anotherbot.info). SSL enabled so no more problems with warnings about potential dangerous site

* PnL is calculated depending on the pair, so each pair should now show the correct PnL. As it has to load more prices it might be a little slower loading

* Added filters for Type and Pair. Rows can be sorted by clicking on the column header

* Added the minus sign on negative PnL to make it easier for color blind people

* Added a column with the duration of the position (how long its been open)

* Bot has a new parser mechanism that should handle commands that do not follow the syntax 100%. Additional error messages are now being sent by PM to warn about the error in the syntax
* Commands can be sent by PM to avoid spamming the thread. Send your commands to [/u/position_bot](/u/position_bot) and the site will be updated

* Opening a position only gets a PM and not a comment on the post to reduce spam.

* During this week i'll enable a restriction to only accept commands from posts over 100 chars. Low effort posts to update positions must be sent by PM to the bot!

* Mobile notifications: Enabled a Push Notification System using the app "Pushed". Its a free app that can be downloaded from the usual App Stores. Just create an account and search for "Position Bot". Once you subscribe to that channel, you will get a notification every time "special" users update their positions. For now i've enabled it for [/u/_chewtoy](/u/_chewtoy), [/u/MikeXBT](/u/MikeXBT) and myself (don't follow my positions if you value your money, i just need a user to test the system). This list will grow, just haven't decided if i'll create a subscription system where each user can decide which users they want to follow or if i do a poll and the most voted users.

* RSS feed is enabled on each users history page. Anyone that is comfortable using RSS can use this links.

* The bot is now running on a better server so it should have a better performance now.

* Since the database has some older positions, i'll be checking with those users to see if the position is still open or not. This site should only be used for trades and not to track cold storage / long term positions.


To do:

* Enable handling multiple positions per comment / PM
* Notification system improvements
* Additional error messages and controls
* Add BTC address for donations (last thing to be done so it will take time) 

As always suggestions and bug reports are welcome


!short xbtusd 8450 1x 50%

Putting half my stack in fiat for now. I have a bad feeling about the bear pennant forming. But can also see a BGD appearing out of nowhere. So 50% fiat feels like a decent hedge either way.

I would buy back the other half on a break above 8700.

We’re also nearing a bearish TK on the 12h double cloud: https://www.tradingview.com/x/aHMYC8KU/

Another theory: maybe we are inside a larger pennant we all thought we are in: [https://imgur.com/a/sVzODeS](https://imgur.com/a/sVzODeS)
Finally a point where I can move my stop loss from 8550 to 8652, again showing that waiting and waiting a bit more for the market to give you a clear direction is the way to go. BTCs volatility has actually been quite OK the last month, it just seems bigger because of the exploding moves.

 If not, I would have been equally stressed about when to get in again...
Could it mean anything that the BGD came at almost the exact same time as it did yesterday?
The market definitely wants to go up, not so sure about what traders want, given the fact that we have already set new higher high for today. I think it will give more confidence to those currently sitting on the sidelines to join the market in its journey to whatever heights it might be going to. Furthermore, businesses will resume tomorrow so I expect positive price movement.

With that being said, I just closed my long from $8,375 at $8,667. I want to increase my stack as much as possible to continue trading with bigger position each time until I can. Moreover, I have already made some healthy gains, I want to sit on the side for some time, re-evaluate and then join in again. I am also planning to help push the price up.

I will be on the lookout for another good entry if we retrace a hundred dollars or two. If we do not retrace much, I will wait. If we continue to go high, I think I will be looking at potential support and resistance lines from the TA done by the experts here. I might also just open another long if I see high probability of continuous growth without much retrace. No shorting at the moment, it can be deadly!

!long XBTUSD close 8667
So I have a question to you folks, what do you think about people who say that bitcoin and crypto doesn't follow traditional market patterns? They say that it's all driven by fud, hype, and manipulation and that TA is a meme. But isn't that exactly what drives traditional markets as well? I get that it's much easier for whales to affect the prices in crypto since it's such a small market still. But doesn't manipulation, fud, and hype happen in the stock market too? 
I managed to open a long at 8375. Trading 50% of stack. No stop loss on this, I’ll manage as a I go. This has the potential to break up. I’m not sure if there is enough volume to get this below 8200 currently. One of the biggest Blockchain events of the year is going on right now. 10,000 to 8300 is a big correction, there is definitely potential to move up. 
**Position bot is offline**

I'm going to update the bot to the latest version and migrate everything to the new site. 

Everything seems quiet so it shouldn't cause any problems. When everything is ready i'll create a post with the changes i've made.
Has anyone done backtesting or analysis of the ‘diamond’ formation for BTC?

Big green dildo or not, there’s a pretty clear diamond formation here: https://www.tradingview.com/x/cn3iks3s/

A few people called this pattern yesterday: https://twitter.com/cryptotutor/status/995433476034834442?s=21

I’ll need to do more reading about this pattern in terms of volume profile, targets etc.
looks like another [bounce exactly off the daily doubled kijun](https://i.imgur.com/MJFzZXg.png), although the [bitfinex long:shorts ratio](https://i.imgur.com/2LAVN0l.png) is a little high for my liking

Nice big BGD, so once again we're getting bamboozled by BTC doing it's contrarian things. Currently, we're making another move towards 8.6k, though we're doing so on less volume than the last BGD. This doesn't mean the rally isn't legitimate, but rather that sellers seem to be exhausted at the 8.4k level. 

Now it will be interesting to see where it lands in a couple of hours, and if an uptrend will be established. Somethings to keep in mind though, comparatively many longs are open that might take profit dampening aggressive moves up.

We still have the major resistance line from 10k -> 9.4k -> currently at about 9k. I have the 0.382 at about 8.65k. 

Last, I just extended our pennant a little and we might still be in a larger pennant formation. It's still a risky area, but these movements make a long here more attractive. 

Chart (sorry for messiness, the orange pennant): https://www.tradingview.com/x/CMRBqOVo/

Good luck! 
"Fuck your Bollinger Bands!" -Bitcoin
I'm going to hold my short a bit longer. Probably until $8,850. 
Yesterday many here were saying we were headed below 8k.  And soon after into goblin town.  Now we’re headed back to 9-10k ?  What changed?
Ascending triangle on 15m, ascending wedge on 1h, bear flag on 1d.

Still on my 'f..k it, is gonna bounce somewhere' long from 8450, no stops, going to sleep, gonna regret this tomorrow.
Jesus this is not what I want to see when im about to sleep. Going in fiat now.  
I think it’s rather important to be able to atleast stay above 8400 and establish it as a support. I’m personally still sitting 50% in bitcoin and the rest in alts( too late for me to pull out now) and I’m not confident enough to put the other 50% enough unless we have a new area of support as any tanking movements back to Low 8300 will screw me over 
Did a scientific test and tried to buy 1 contract on Bitmexcio, system overload. Prepare for some choppy cascading moves soon :D 
Still premature
What’s the opposite of a dead cat bounce? When you’re rallying and retrace a bit? Just a bear trap? Is a bull trap the same as a dcb?

Also is this one of them?
Ascending triangle or bear flag?

Just closed my 8443 long  at 8679.. 
pretty happy with the small gains but i honestly just have no idea what’s gonna happen so i’m taking my profit for tonight. Will probably open a new long if i see more bullish volume  
a dip is not owning me again. short here. 
Hidden bull divergence developing on the 1h chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/dtMJg4hr/

Someone might be making a bit of room for a BGD?

Anyway, I’m not sure we’re done testing 8.2k as the local bottom. Feels like bears are not yet giving up.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/1WWWVXun/

Futures premium also evaporated. Long 8500 OKEX quarts full position, if only for the short term. Premium near zero is ridiculous.

Edit: https://www.tradingview.com/x/CQ1k5oZn/

idk, ya buy that it's a breakdown?? It's a short term line, support in this area.... I won't pick this hill to die on. Below 8300 BFX and I close. I closed my short for this long, too.
We were in a channel (red) within a pennant that just broke.  Held up well with 5 touches.  Could see 8K if it reaches the bottom of the pennant (blue).

https://imgur.com/a/Nv6Dde2

Edit: Or sideways before breaking up out of the pennant after the Consensus 2018.
still in Fiat

feels like the price is on life support because of that 5500BTC buy wall from 8000-8200. Walls like that tend to be tested sooner or later...and a safety margin of just 5% isn't enough for me to trust it, so just going to be patient and wait things out
I swap all of my bitcoin for ethereum at 0.063 . Best trade I made this year .
Bitcoin started acting up right before my flight, costing me $50 in wifi fees.

Can't be away while the bulls are at play.

Consensus only a day away. Expect detailed reports from the front lines from yours truly. The amount of energy and buzz is unprecedented. They've sold another 1,500 ($3,000 a pop, now $3,500) tickets since I last checked a week ago. Big names from all over the world.
Curretntly looking at this.

So far it has been proven to be correct, let's see If it holds on the next test of the border lines. We have tested both many times so far.
Getting really close to bailing here. Just had my last add go through on my short, CA @ 8720 on June futures. There's a part of me expecting a huge dump off the daily close. This has to be the weakest/lowest volume pump I've seen in a while. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/B2gO4tZm/  

We're still sort of wedging upwards, but I have a low degree of confidence in this formation. I'm not willing to hold this thing that much deeper.
Absolutely disgraceful show by the bulls. Maybe I'm short-sighted but you think they'd try and hold up the price at a certain level?

Look at how thin the sell side of the order book is... https://i.imgur.com/pHXshsK.png

Maybe it's just me but it's super annoying with a thin order book like that bulls don't try and make a move...?
Just woke up and flew out of bed, 50% of my buy orders trigger, just went all in. Let's hope that wasn't a mistake.

Flair remains bear.
Short @8585. Stops above 8650. Very good r/r for shorts here. Loss is very limited.
I know everyone is sharing their doomsday opinions for bitcoin this week, but this is really looking like a perfect storm forming for later this week. We are approaching heavy resistance around $8800-$8900 over the next couple of days. If we get rejected, this will look eerily similar to the wyckoff distribution chart getting shared. We are also looking at a similar double top formation to what happened in February. In addition, the BCH fork is May 15th, which I honestly think helped jumpstart this run, more than tripling in price over the past month. Consensus is May 14-16 as well, with both events potentially triggering a selloff after the event.

On the flip side, if we do manage to stay above the $8200 range all week, I think we may be looking pretty bullish in the short term, since it has held against some pretty heavy selling pressure so far.

If you ask me, I’m starting to agree with some people that we are forming a long-term triangle, with our highs getting lower ($19.8k, $11.8k, $10k?) and our lows getting higher ($6k, $6.4k, ?). Even if this does drop further from here, I’m starting to get more bullish in the long term, as long as we manage to form another higher low. At that point, it would seem pretty much confirmed that a bottom has been found, and people can comfortably buy the dips moving forward without worrying about as much concern for major dumps.

I know this is a bit of a novel, but this is my read on the current situation. I was curious what everyone’s thoughts are as well, beyond the next few hours/days?
Gdax at a monstrous 6900 btc 24h volume...how low will it go? One day I will be able to pull off a significant portion of volume by making a few trades lmao 
What do you all think of this? https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/JtW9HuaU-Crypto-Review-May-13th/ Phil is pretty much a permabear and it looks like he might be turning bullish is we close above 8800 today. Looks like we will be setting up a morning star pattern on the weekly. 
!short XBTUSD 8745 5X 100%

I'm expecting 8800 to provide good resistance. I'll add a bit more at 8790, and cut it if 8800 breaks with volume. I like to enter these sorts of positions with absurdly tight stops.

Anyone else dealing with an underwater short right now? What was your entry and what's your plan? I originally said I'd cut it loose if we broke $8,650 but think I'll hang on a little longer, the buying still seems weak
Users of scaled orders, what do you do when price moves to your side but only a small fraction of your total order has been filled? Do you add the remainder during dips/bounces, or do you tend to sit on your hands? 
8 min for this pin bar 1h candle to close. interesting times https://imgur.com/a/61lrTZV
Been long since about 8.3k. I'm not quite sure where to put stops and/or limit sells at this point? Any advice?
Bought in yesterday @ 8500 at the opening because of a strong doji close on the daily and an exhausted selling pressure.

15mins and hourly charts looks great and has been breaking up channels. Great for bulls.

6hour chart has a strong consolidation formation that bulls need to break by day’s end, meaning at the end of this last 6 hr candle, which is also the end of the daily today we have to pass 8700 with good volume.

On the daily we are testing upper boundaries on yesterdays high and it is also the 8700 we have to breach. We really need good volume here and in a few hours, Asia should provide Monday morning activity.

If we breach 8700 with good volume by end of day ill roll my trade until the 9000, possibly to 10. This may end the short term bear market as we march over 10,300. This will make below 8000 a less of a possibility

If we do not breach 9700 by end of today Ill sell at whatever price we end because it means theres not enough bulls to push further

Stops at 9500


what is this 1000 BTC limit buy order popping up on finex all the time?
One last look before bedtime. Looks like an ascending [wedge/channel? on the 1H](https://www.tradingview.com/x/aPO21Vk5/). RSI has cooled off on every time frame. MACD still bullish on smaller time frames up to 6H were it crossed bullish. Every thing higher looks bearish. 
[4H still looks like a bear pennant](https://www.tradingview.com/x/wKK1H8Wp/) and ichi looks bearish with Kijun pointing down, chikou under price and kumo way above price.

We bounced from 8750 a few times and now are struggling to stay above 8600. [I'm short](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8j1gi0/daily_discussion_sunday_may_13_2018/dyx0h6d/) from 8640 but was skittish to add on the run to 8700. I'm keeping my SL above 8860, maybe higher to avoid a wick, instead of closing at breakeven here and will reassess in the morning.
I want to short this but I’m not sure if the volume is there to drive it below 8-8.3K with Consensus coming up. I’d wait a few days and see if the hype does lead to a pump in the charts. I’m out of position until it makes sense to get back in. If you open a long, I would put a tight stop loss (8250 area). 
Will the sheep follow this move? If yes target around 8.8k \(maybe even 8.9k if we are in a descending broadening wedge\)
i wonder if bulls are going to pop up and start saying this was a much needed pullback before the next leg up again. 
looks to be a hidden sell wall at $8610
Can any professional trader comment on the current market situation? I would really appreciate it.

8200 was a big resistance and approximately the 0.5 retrace so is it likely to be the bottom? Or is 8000 to 7800 more likely? Or even lower? 

In which phase are we currently? 

I have the feeling that we currently try to push up but I see too less volume, but when volume enters the 1h candles than we get a push so this would  a more bullish indicator right? 

Thank you in advance

Volume on gdax is the lowest I’ve seen since I started trading. What gives?

!long XBTUSD close 8540
Good morning my fellow shorts. Got closed out just above break even sometime while I was sleeping. I didn't update my position to show that I had added to my short in the 8.4 range and closed the portion I added at a loss in the 8.5 range yesterday - so full disclosure: I lost some money. But nothing too bad.

!short XBTUSD close 8410

I have reopened a position here @ 8555 and will cut it loose if we break ~8650. Will post it in a separate comment. 

Edit: Well, looks like I didn't have to wait long for some fireworks. Let's see how this plays out.
Closed my short at around $8,710 for a fairly substantial loss. 

I'm pretty shocked the market popped so significantly there. But whatever, buyers seem to know what they're doing. Even if I think it's retarded. 

Will reshort once buying pressure subsides.

After successfully [catching knifes from 8.9k](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ito6f/daily_discussion_saturday_may_12_2018/dyv33qb/) I've zoomed out a bit and got back into a more rational state of mind.

Here's the big picture I'm looking at (2d chart): https://www.tradingview.com/x/ejyGS8LN/

Right now, **8200** is obviously the break point which corresponds nicely with the 'point of control' in the volume profile. I actually do think we will find strong support here.

However, if 8200 breaks down the next volume node will be found around **6900**. And this is an area with a lot confluence:

- ATH log resistance tested as support
- Log support from Nov/Feb/Apr lows
- High volume node

Given where we are right now, I'd almost prefer the market to visit 6900 sooner rather than later and confirm this area as solid support with a nice tripple-bottom. That would almost certainly but the bear market behind us.
Whales dumped 400BTC to break down of bearish pennant/triangle. Looks like it's going back in though:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/WOxyI0GK/
Anyone betting on cup and handle? Or is the volume too low and we're going to drop big?

http://imgur.com/gallery/v88zgCG
ETH has been on a steep rise. Usually Bitcoin follows. Not so far this time, though. Why is that?
Anyone else worried by, what is frankly, colossal volume on sell of, and relatively average volume on rebound?

Seems like shorting/longing has become way to popular, and big guys (exchanges and "whales") can very much manipulate price ~1000$ in order to liquidate bunch of naive people. No need to wait for price to go to 20k-30k, just play around 6k-11k and liquidate people as it goes up and down...

People’s reactions never cease to amaze me. Its a 100 dollar pump, calm the fuck down lads.
So did we just break up from a pennant now?
Hi guys,

I wrote [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8j1gi0/comment/dyxam5h?st=JH59AP4M&sh=433262fe) up and gave it some thought. Posting here for some visibility. Would be nice to know what you think about my short to long term predictions
What do you guys think of this fractal? It seems to be pretty damn accurate so far:

1 interesting thing I noticed zooming out to the weekly chart , we roughly made a move from ~6400 to ~9900 with no significant pullback. If you count that as 1 move (roughly $3500), 50 pct retracement of that would be about where we landed. This drop has looked horrible for the bulls, but bitcoin market cycles have been quick historically and maybe this is just the drop that had to happen? 

Just food for thought, but maybe this move has been more like: Bulls: “ok, fine, if we have to retrace, let’s gets this over with”. 
Looks like ETH leading the market again, upcoming conference hype maybe(will of course dump afterwards) but that could be the help BTC Need to break through this boring 8600 level
When would this bear flag on the daily be considered invalidated?
Excuse my shit post. 

Snagged a short today while taking a poo at work on this very busy Mother’s Day. 

I’m hoping it will be the most profitable poop of my life
I love how paranoid the BGD's made a lot of people. It just makes the market even worse, everything will tell you to short, but the memory of BGD's will keep you awake at night. Does anyone think its better to not consider the risk of a BGD or BRD when making a trade?
That is my bigger picture with the more important lines right now: [https://imgur.com/a/kfboknj](https://imgur.com/a/kfboknj)

The wedge broke violantly down as expected, support should be 7.3k if this large scale pennant is in play. Will go all\-in if we really reach 7.3k with stops at around 7k. Another upswing to the res line of the large scale pennant would bring us back to 8.5k... that is my target to sell.

But as said below, a low volume rally here \(to reset the mid\-term RSIs\) is not unexpected.

This violent downswing we are in might also fold out as a very steep descending wedge. Bitcoin really loves to paint wedges.
Hmmmmm when did we see this "small push, moving average forming cross bull flag breakdown last time"-formation ? :D https://imgur.com/a/63Cn54o
I can see a small ascending wedge on the  30m.
Limit order just got filled, I am back in a position. Good night traders!
Low volume. Seems fake. Will wait on sidelines. 
Chew, if you have any updates, many of us would be happy to hear that

I apologize for speaking on behalf of many but I’m pretty sure that’s the case 
I'm feeling very confident with my position. More so then usual. Switching from bearish to bullish. 

Long @ $8350 

Target : 10.2k sell 

Rebuy @ $9.4k or fomo @ $10599.

Reason? Gut feeling. 
 As I previously said, this is going to be hot next week with the consensus. Alts will go crazy, dragging btc along. From there i guess BTC will most likely attempt another breakout, which will depend what will be revealed on the consensus and what the alleged "huge industry announcements" are.
Looks like this chart I posted a few hours ago might actually play out. Who would’ve known.

Currently all in fiat, got a bit emotional trading earlier so just went cold turkey. Closed my short at a loss, I still think this pump is a load of bullshit but I am not looking at things objectively enough at the moment. 

I would be shorting now though if I was taking a position. Will long if 8850 is broken and sustained. Volume is garbage right now. Good luck everyone. 
Still having my 8550 long, placing stops at 8300 now. Feels like this market is like a house of cards waiting for the last wind to crash it down. On the other hand, some strong alt recovery already on Binance so this might lead to some organic buying

Tradingview/computer question: When the screen of my computer (macOS) is locked because I have not touched it for some time, the Tradingview alarm does not work (even though the window is open in the browser). The alarm only rings immediately after I unlock the screen.

The computer is not in sleep mode, I have disabled that while plugged into power.

Anyone knows how to get the alarm to work while screen is locked?

Predictions on how bch fork will affect the market Tuesday? If at all?
Question for the experienced traders here.  How do you go about taking a break with trading BTC?  Say you have a 2 weeks family vacation or business trip, do you just sit out in USD?  Or do you try to identify the trend and sit in BTC if it's an uptrend or 50/50 BTC/USD etc.  Interested in how you guys manage this in the long run instead of babysitting it 24/7 on a beach or hotel somewhere.
When talking about daily closes here, which timezone are you all referring to?
Haven't used kraken much and am testing it out so I can play with leverage for fun. However, all of the deposit addresses I generated are invalid BTC addresses. Wtf? Is this a common problem?
I was just talking to my brother-in-law about how the BTC markets in the past week has been an emotional roller coaster.  I'm just wondering how you guys fared both in trades and in sentiment now.  For me, I lost a bit of money, but more disappointed if this run will really stall here.
I added a bunch to my short at $8470.  There is the BGD risk, but doesn't usually launch from this kind of formation.  BRD is more likely, or just more bleeding.

EDIT..there goes $8400  support on Bitstamp.
Woah, BGD just now. 8400 to 8570 in 6 minutes. 
Edit: About to break 8600

Seems most cryptos got this BGD at the exact same time. 
Selling btc at $8600 is like selling gold at $1 per ounce.
Thinking that last flair up to 8500 was a topoff, a fakeout before a mega breakout. 
Hmm, the fact that the bearish pennant hasn't broken down surprises me. 

Could very well be an accumulation move here with a counter-intuitive break upwards. I guess it'll be one of those "set and alarm and forget about it" days.  
Looks like another DCB might be beginning to take off.

$8750 would be 50% fib, for what it's worth.
Man, what a fakeout

If we dont go higher today could this be counted as a double top or is this too short of a timeframe?

Dead cat bounce to provide whales liquidity to cash out at a premium. The storm of regulations is coming and all these shady wash trading exchange cartels will be shut down for blatantly selling and manipulating securities. People also forget almost half of Asia's "volume" is fake, Huobi, HitBTC and OKEX are blatant offenders. 

Bitcoin will be 22\-44 billion market cap by years end. \(Most bullish prediction.\)

A strong break up here is likely 
People are still selling their btc below 10k? Hilarious. I guess burning money is a fetish for some. I won't judge.
[deleted]
I think this was the last dip. We have fully cleansed from the correction. Any pump that starts now will break $10k and after that, we will never see bitcoin below $10k anymore. I expect the pump to commence within a day or 2 day. BTC at $15k next sunday wouldn't surprise me a tiny bit! We won't drop much further. Any bearish sentiment is false sentiment. Anyone with shorts open should close them asap. Rally soon.
Most obvious dead cat bounce I've ever seen

If we break up she gets a spa day, break down and it’s just a card I’m afraid.
I’ll be watching charts with my mother 
I'm a mother and I'm watching charts while my kids ignore me. 
Uhm, for what reson are you calling us degenerate  ?? Rule 1 bro... be excellent.
Jokes on you. I live with my mom! 
Idk, could be, but I'm getting the 10k attempt vibes again. low volume, subtle pressure to incite some FOMO (lingering around the breakout point) whilst never actually crossing the line. 

Could be accumulation, could be distribution. But I'll only long near the bottom on our pennant/flag, wouldn't short here in general as upwards fakeout is likely. (ETH also looking strong in recovery, might be leading the charge again)
I don't understand why whales would spend so little time accumulating in the 6k range and then re-accumulate in the 8k range.. (which is why I missed the timing for long before the BGD)

I can't help but to think that the 6k accumulation was not the end of bears market
Sound alike all mini pumps being pushed by big market buys. 
Resisting the FOMO is the hardest and most valuable thing a trader should learn.
After two weeks of good trading (consecutive to a month of bad trading), I have opened a long around 9,7 while I wanted to do the opposite), I have averaged it down to 8.9 and let it opened. Quite happy with the bgd and ready with all the possibilities but it’s definitely not the situation that I envisioned about this week.
this is correct
> massive hidden bull div on the daily 

where? I can't really read your charts sorry, very difficult for me especially with the colors. I don't see one on  RSI though
I do and have we broke the bear Trend quite a while back which is why I went long towards the bottom of the dip yesterday at 8530 I would have waited for 8200 but I didn't have time to babysit.
No shit Sherlock 
Too damn similar, it's disturbing

https://www.tradingview.com/x/aEAPFwKP/

The neckline(The top of the low-volume rally) is 8650 according to Wyckoff theory. Going down from here

EDIT: [Wyckoff](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/54/96/5c/54965ca530afd853b7d0455ecd6830c6.jpg)
I'm always long on rat poison. Great team, excellent potential, consistently undervalued. 

If we break 8.65 I might pop in a scalp long with a target of 8.9k. It depends a little on the break though because I still find the market really heavy looking and the decrease in volume isn't inspiring confidence either. However support seems to be beefing up a little, and currently the path of least resistance might be up. I'd use super tight stops though to lock in any gains. 
on the other hand, BTC always does the most unlikely ;P
I'm looking at the order books and I'm seeing a fake bull run as well. Volume isn't there to warrant such an upward movement. I think we're in for another drop in a couple of days. Maybe 4-5 at most. Definitely feels like someone is trying to liquidate to me.
Tough call but you might want to wait until the end of this week just in case there does end up being a big altcoin pump from consensus.

On the other hand we could turn around and dip back to 7800 in short order.

You could always do 15% now and 15% later.
If you are planning on holding on a longer term basis then it doesn't really matter when you buy.

So the price could go up...or down
Is there any way to view bitfinex's orderbook other than from their interface? Would like to have it as a view in tradingview
That's not a wedge, it's a triangle.
I see the triangle, but not sure it confirmed yet. We're currently at $8677 (source: Coinmarketcap). 
I saw your position. Enjoy your gains. :) Cheers!
We're painting a reasonable cup and handle on 12hr / 1day charts. It looks a bit retarded because of the original BGD, and C&H patterns in general are meh, but the target for it would be quite fun - a retest of $12k. 

That is of course if this isn't just a lame technical bounce and we actually confirm a breakout from the handle. 
Probably a good place to close. You can always re-open a break above 8800, but this thing seems to be petering out off of 8750. 
Is that trading view premium? 
God damn it why did I close my short... 
On that note... are u closing or moving ur stops down?

I’m drunk and not sure what to do here 
That add at 8700s was ballsy, so good for you. I chickened out when I saw chewy dropping out on a loss. But that bear flag was text book. I’m setting stops at break even and resting easy now. 7800 target maybe?
I see bitcoin's and alt's prices in my fucking dreams :(
As someone who has been involved full time for basically 4 years, you need to learn when to obsess, and when not to obsess. There are times when it's good to be committed a ton, but there are other times when nothing is happening that you have the freedom to go off. Took a very long time to get a feel for when and how to manage the on\off periods.
If history is any indication, then you're right about the post-consensus sell-off. Check out the May 2017 price graph. Consensus ends, Bitcoin takes a big hit.
Best thing is you can use funding services on exchanges in the meantime. USD lending gives you are yearly return of 25&#37; which is not bad at all. I lend some JPY \(Japanese Yen\) for incredible 0,7&#37; per day for 3 days, now the rate fall, but that was crazy, as the risk is minimal to not existing.
Good and balanced post.

"This being said, these big players could simply just be prepping bitcoin for another big run, and the bear market may truly be over, but its still far too early for that claim aswell."

- no, just no 
Good work that man
I think instead of letting people back date their positions, you should set the position automatically

i.e. lets say they open a position at 5:30pm...the bot then will check what the price was at the time of their post and will use that for the position 

will help eliminate all the people faking their stats for karma
Have you considered making a leader board?

I suppose then you'd have to deal with more hostile user issues.
Wow you are quite awesome! Thanks for all this.
feature request:

it would be nice if the bot would check the price of your trade vs the btc price at the time you posted.  Then it could show a "trade accuracy" percentage showing how well your posted trades line up with the real price.  this would let you know if someone is hindsight trading. 
/u/tippr all

Yeah I have this in my chart I posted a couple of minutes ago. I'm also keeping open the possibility of an ascending wedge, but that'll really depend on where it lands after this pump. I'd say breakout is around 650, breakdown still at 350. Pretty nice 300points range to trade in.
That's what I was thinking, just forming a bigger pennant. Though we could get a "Last Point of Supply" push to the upper 8ks.
Isn't that awfully tight? A couple of dollars and you could get wicked out.
Are you short now, and staying?
If you remember, during the last run up to 10K, we had similar BGDs at the same time everyday. 
Yep, we saw so many during the uptrend in mid-april. I'm short and these market buys at fixed time makes me nervous as I am still convinced the whole uptrend was basically guided by them. If we do not break down in the next 18hrs I think I will reduce/close my position.
Don't want to get trapped back in a game of MMs.
No it can't possibly mean anything.
Sorry, need some help here:  What does BGD stand for? Seen it alot here lately.

More GDs and bigger GDs -- that's the forecast.
I think the factors are mostly the same except it's more extreme for crypto. (There's barely any fundamentals) For example, who trades oil and corn to actually hedge/consume?
TA works only if enough people think it works. No time to explain.
>  They say that it's all driven by fud, hype, and manipulation and that TA is a meme.

It is mostly driven by manipulation, but TA still works to some degree.

And no, manipulation on NYSE is not nearly the level of BTC market.
I started to think TA was complete and utter bullshit until it started losing me money by actively ignoring it. Perhaps it was just an unlucky streak but there are a few indicators that work for me and I don't give a shit if they don't *really* work, it's profitable for me. Most of it really is bullshit but there's some pretty simple stuff that works well

I have a feeling most people who say that either trade very long term trends or they just don't want to deal with all the bullshit that comes with trading.
Ermmmmm nope, fundamentals drive a large part of traditional markets, of course hype and fear play a role in any market, and manipulation will of course sometimes occur. 

But crypto takes manipulation to another level, for example in the alt market you can see great pumps and crashes off the back of reddit users posting en masse.
What do i think about those people who...? I think good for them and would they mind sharing their approach please. Maybe they have something to add to the mix, important to keep open minded i feel. 
Traditional markets are tightly regulated to prohibit manipulative practices like wash trading, cornering and of course insider trading, all of which is completely legal in the unregulated libertarian paradise of cryptoland. I'm always sort of baffled when people in this sub discount the possibility of manipulation - I mean, it would be stupid *not* to do so, particularly when the markets are so shallow and the majority of participants are so inexperienced. It's easy money. 
I don't blame people for thinking TA is a meme, but then why are they talking about market patterns? Sounds like they are trying to shift the blame.
they are totally wrong, btc follows even more market cycle and hype patterns since fundamentals are weaker
Good luck but managing as you go can be risky. Deer in headlight moments and emotion will swing you around more than you think.

at least have a rough idea of what you want to do with the trade
Don't be caught up in the hype of Consensus is my main advice. Buy the hype, sell the news. This rally we've had the past month could very well be the product of Consensus hype and I'm sure there are many waiting to sell the news, looking at the charts it seems some may have already started.
> I managed to open a long

Good call. Just wait, chances are very low you will see $8,200 again.

> This has the potential to break up.

High probability. All sort of market sells are being absorbed by the market pretty nicely and the price is holding up.

> I’m not sure if there is enough volume to get this below 8200 currently.

Definitely not. As said above, market sells are being absorbed without affecting the price much. Whoever is keeping it stable (I won't call names) is doing a fantastic job. 

> One of the biggest Blockchain events of the year is going on right now.

Haven't heard about this so no idea.


Interested to hear your thoughts on this sudden change of mind.. 
I think you'll be safe. 8.8k is where the 4h kijun meets EMA200 and the 8h cloud. Stiff resistance. If you have a stop, it might get hunted though... meaning if you don't want to get hunted, you're probably going to have to baby sit your position. Good luck.
$8,850 would be about the target for the possible symmetrical triangle that was broken out of 6 hours ago.


I got stopped out overnight at 8610 (June futures). I just got home expecting to be able to re-open over 8700, and where the hell did the premium go? We pump up and the premium drops fro $100 to $50? Damn. 
Jumping on at 8650 (8700 June futures). Approaching the top of the rising wedge: https://www.tradingview.com/x/GUG8hBaY/
What is special about $8850?  

People forgot that we went from 6.5 to 10k without any retrace. Now they begin to realize we made a higher low. People don't zoom out.
> What changed?

the price went up and most people here don't have the foresight to see it doesn't go straight up or down.

still following distribution perfectly. look in particular at the test, break the ice, low volume rally, then markdown. We are quite literally following it perfectly

and massive continuing hidden bear divs on the daily:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/zFIgO8oa/

also notice how there's hidden bear divs in this triangle but there's only 1 hidden bull div- mainly because we closed the daily at $7k instead of $6k that first time around. to make another hidden bull div we'd have to break down below the support line. and we got rejected hard off the resistance line again:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/KYhkn3cV/

edit: Note that these charts are all on very long term time frames. These are the time frames I like to trade off of because they provide the most clarity and strength in patterns

"Everybody said it was going to be sunny tomorrow. Now it's cloudy and everybody says there's going to be a thunderstorm. What changed?"

It's not sunny, that's what changed. 
Most sensible traders agreed that we may see a rebound to 9000 before going to 7800. I dont want this to happen, but if it does i pray to god we bounce of 7800. Dont listen to people who use absolute terms such as *will deifnitely go up/down to xxxx*. I only seriously consider the TA of people who provide more than one scenario and are open to changing their opinions accordingly. Thats why i like chewey so much, he trades what the market does, not what he wants it to do.
Nothing changed. We are still in a bear flag. Relax and wait if we can break the resistance or drop deeper.
I still say its going down. Just because the price goes up 4-5% doesn't mean its now bull season 
i turned my short into a long. that's what happened. haha
Nothing. BTFD.
the date changed.
I was actually thinking to short $8,600, which happens to be the current price. I believe many others followed the idea. 

But you know, this is Bitcoin, things can take a turn very quickly.
Good thing you held the long, we just had a small spike to 8700.
Bag... getting... heavy...
Living mouse pounce? 
yeah a bull trap is a dead cat bounce. Nothing really different about them. 

Although the name bull trap has more connotations of being subtle and tricky 
Alive cat bounced
Perhaps we can call it Dead Rat Dip, DRD.
When both meet you have a Schrödinger cat
Kraken is also pulling ahead and trying to drag bitfinex up. 
A dip has no name, and profit taking is coming. Prepare yourself.
Might be too soon to call. A $60-$70 dollar drop would wash that out. 

This is definitely way too soon to call but if it even gets there, there would be another one that could potentially form from $8,300 though if we dump through the current div. (Depending on how low it’ll go) 

I also think a retest of $8,200 is a likely possibility.
June futures wicked to 8275 on mex lol. Good lord
Just as some bears are waiting patiently for the price to come to them, some bulls are waiting for the price to come to them. Not all tactics involve hysterical market orders.
that wall held the market up at $6.5k, too. that thing is really holding it up 
> Walls like that tend to be tested sooner or later

Under usual circumstances, yes. But I do not think that will be the case this time. I do not see that much BTC to be sold, neither do I think that the wall will see the light of the day again for the time to come, it could but who knows. As Sloppy said above, that wall is really holding this up, I will only consider shorting if it fails. 
Just now scale out selling it above 0.12 to keep it rolling.
> They've sold another 1,500 ($3,000 a pop, now $3,500) tickets since I last checked a week ago. Big names from all over the world.

So we are in the wrong business. Trading is not where the money is, selling overpriced tickets to corporate middle managers is
thank you for doing this, I will be reading your updates.
Consensus is an alt show, if that would be huge for BTC don't worry, the price would already be around where it should.
We have a nice bearflag there.
I don't see much downside about closing at be when things go against you, never regretted it in fact
Bailed at 8700, almost broke even since we came down (CA 8850 or so). GL to you all still holding your long, I sincerely hope it goes up for you.
I'm starting to get pissed off here, underwater from 8550 but I've got to imagine there's some kind of strategy at play, ie close the daily green and then dump. I feel I'm deep enough underwater that I might as well give it another $100 leeway at this point. Once I start losing enough I start taking a "f*** it" attitude. 

On the one hand I'm impressed we
made it this high. On the other hand, market makers are setting up the bulls and they can't even get it past 9k? Come on...
thats usually a good indicator to sell

at $20,000 the order book was paper thing after that until about $50,000...but then the sell off came

basically if a move doesn't happen even when the books are paper thin, then the move will usually be down after that 
Broo, I think it's very risky to long here.

Botje at tradingview looking at at least 7900/8100
Your trading acumen is dead-on!
Brave!

Usually these BGDs are followed up with upward channel that fails at a resistance level and then barts down. So I think your stop might get hit on a wick or something 
Haha... yeah, it's going to stay above 8.2. Well above. The latest short-bus mega-shorty is fresh outta coins to sell at a loss and probably needs to buy a bunch back. I hope he waits a while to buy back. Max Pain and all that...
Interesting idea regarding long\-term triangle. If it was going to form as a perfect symmetrical triangle, then arguably this was our local bottom.

[https://imgur.com/a/iP1R5AN](https://imgur.com/a/iP1R5AN)

Would likely make for some interesting flux in the short term, but we'd be looking to break into more bullish territory. Maybe a deciding moment around \~10.6k?

Edit: Absolutely fudged touching the ATH wick. Oops. Ideas close enough, if not accurate.
what bch fork wtf 
This is probably why Brian Armstrong is in panic mode lately. This is largely his own doing and his monopoly won't last forever. He could've fostered a healthy environment around Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin. Instead he sold out to Roger and went the insider trading route, along with a whole load of other terrible business decisions. What ever happened to that internal investigation anyway? This guy doesn't care about the long term implications of crpyto. He wanted to make a few quick bucks. Now his cash cow is hemorrhaging. Good. Let a better exchange take all of his business during the next boom.
It's not as urgent as he makes it out to be according to the Ichi. BTC has until the end of May before it finally tests the weekly kumo. If by then, price is below 10.3k, the outlook is bearish; above that level and it's in bullish territory *on the weekly chart*. At that same time on the 3D chart and at roughly that price level of 10.3k, price will test the 3D kumo.

Technicaly right. So we need a close above 8815 in 2.3h
Turning bullish????? in what universe?

FFS!
You may have a winner. 
FOMOing in low on a dip is not FOMOing. that is smart buying :) if it dumps through here at least you can say that it was justified instead of having to look at yourself in shame the next time u go to the bathroom
Nothing wrong. Bears being carried on the back of some whales market selling over a thousand btc in a few minutes on this final pre consensus dip. Enough to trigger a bunch of stops and bot reactions. Conference starts in 7 hours, this weekly candle should be a BGD. If you were trying for a quick scalp before bed you may have made a mistake but if you can hold your position overnight you should be good imo.
Nothing. I did too. My gut is telling me next week will be better 
Care to decipher what you mean? Too newbish to understand :(

I looked it up and in Oct 2015 the price was mostly going sideways before a big pump in November. Best I could gather.
I'm short from 8615, probably will hold until 8850 also.
I'm in a short from just here. Got stopped out overnight around 8550 on my last short. I'm holding until the 4H bear flag gets broken (coinciding with breaking the historical resistance/high volume area around 8850).

edit: I expect everyone and their mothers (even on mothers day) to bail there, though, which could be quite a bit of fuel for a BGD.
I had a short entry around 8370 yesterday, during a dip where I was convinced we were still headed for 8200/7800. I spent four hours looking for an exit, as we slowly crept up to 8500. Luckily we had one more dip after those four hours that got me around break-even point.

The volume wasn't great last night either but the price kept creeping up regardless. It seems like the dumping might be over and were in the last stages of accumulation before a pump tomorrow. Could be another dump, Sundays almost always close with a daily red candle, but seems like we're letting it get higher before a pump for Consensus tomorrow. 

Personally, I'd close out on the next semi dip, just because the risk/reward isn't really worth it at this point to short at that level.
I was short from CA of $8,540 and closed mine for a small loss at $8,650

I’ll probably scale into another one between here - $8,825 and bail of $8,850
I wait. that's the reason for the scaled orders in the first place.  
Depends on market action but if you want the whole position to be in which i think you want otherwise you wouldn’t put in that many orders would you ? and you think the bottom / top is found then just market buy the remainder.
>  remainder during dips/bounces, or do you tend to sit on your hands?

I wrote a long reply and deleted it.  I think this ultimately boils down to your past behavior on trades. Your scaled positions which are stale limit orders could become active in case of a large move in which case you might be holding an underwater position for a while. Does your past behavior indicate that this is an acceptable position? Some people like tightly limited losses while others, thinking of fuckharvey's short, accept some fairly large losses in hopes to land on the right side of the trade and add to the position when its like catching a falling knife.  fuckharvey's position worked out but it could've failed miserably. On the other hand cutting losses quickly could get you scalped out of both entries.
This is why I think it all boils down to your behavior and stress on each trade.  You can look at your past trades and see if scaled orders have executed and made you profitable because you predicted trends well or whether you reset positions and did this work or not.

Sorry.. I guess this post ended up becoming long again anyway.
This happend to me just before THE BGD I should of added the rest in but I sat on my hands waiting for the long pole to resolve. Which it still hasn't. Also not still in that position
If it moves in your favor, then that's a happy problem, because you are already winning. Even small win is still a win.

As bitcoin usually moves in dildos, I tend to wait for that bigger movement and then re-evaluate. I've found that my decision quality falls in these situations, as greed tends to take over, so I'm training myself to be overly conservative when adding after the first successful move.


Long since 8.3

Going to hold until 9-10k, if we get there 

Stops at break even or a little earlier, if we go down now 

I’m not much of a TA guy but I think that risk reword ratio is pretty good right now with this entry 
Good entry. if you need advise, I would say put a stop at $8,600 to make sure you lock your profits. You can then obviously re-enter the long with another good entry like the current one. Cheers! :)
personally would be thinking 8.75, 8.53
8.8k seems to be consensus for the top of this move. You can scale out up to that point in chunks of 3 limit sells.
> If we do not breach 9700 by end of today Ill sell

you are definitely going to sell by the end of today, then. o_O
https://i.imgur.com/acwXXkD.png
spoofing/manipulation probably
There's also 7.5k btc down to $8k on bfx. 

Someone is trying to hold this shit up. Or they really wanna buy some bitcoin. Either way I want to see what happens to it 
"healthy correction"
They will come out after the next $100 push.
Volume mostly comes after confirmation of a move's direction.
Traders are not fortune tellers, but gamblers using probabilities.
We don't make money on 1 move, that is called being a lucky SOB.
We try to make money by consistently gambling on bets in OUR favor. Doesn't mean every trade will be a winner, but we should win out in the long run.

The only true bullish indicator that the bear market has ended is a break of 20k or at least 11,5k. Anyone claiming something else below these levels is guessing or pulling stuff out of their ass.


These are my personal expectations.

I got wicked out of my short as well. I think I'm gonna sit this one out today, unless the [4H bear flag breaks](https://www.tradingview.com/x/YmP9AGuK/) down or it looks invalidated.

!short xbtusd close 8657
I’m curious as to why you were so bearish. We had a significant sell off since 10,000. To go sub 8k that quick would be pretty surprising. I myself shorted to 8200 but I thought even that was overextended. I was saying yesterday that the 8200-8500 was a not trade zone
I thought you were going to wait until we got closer to $8,500? Anything change? Bear flag on the 4hr still seems in tact 
I think you meant !short?
When you say you're waiting for buying or selling pressure to subside, what are you looking for on the charts?
damn dude your success rate is like 99% now

edit: I know he's not perfect I'm just trying to cheer him up :)
I've come to learn with time that trading what the price does, and not what I think it should be doing helps a lot. Congrats for cutting it, you'll make up for it anyway.
Trading bot is offline, /u/justanotherlogin is making some changes
substantial loss? I thought you started shorting at $8600 and opened a temporary long at $8300 which you closed and then reopened your short position. So arent you just losing 1\-2&#37;?
The attempts to break 10K failed and then same with 9.4K . . that was coming off double bottom at 6400/6500, whats different now? Volume is even lower is it not?
We're not going to 6900, even for a quick visit.  Too much demand.
Were not going to 6900. Why are people so delusional. Absolute bottom has already been done. In few days conference starts and then price will go above $10k very quickly and never go below it ever again EVER. People still calling for sub $8k and using TA to back it, are just using the TA as cover for their bad past decisions... most of them probably shorted bitcoin at $6.3k and hope to buy in just a little above that to lessen their massive losses. We are not going sub $8k anymore, soon, the moon shot. Very soon!
There's a chance it was a long "closing" on finex
Yep. The pennant has broken down and confirmed on the hourly candle close. Now we wait to see if there's follow through or if its a bust. Not a lot of confirming volume so far though.
Way too early to call but hey if it happens then great 
If you look at the daily, the sell volume wasn't anything to write home about yesterday, so it goes both way and doesn't mean much else than retail isn't interested yet. Not bearish per se.
Because ratio has broken out from 0.08.
I'm really tempted to sell my Eth to BTC (about 20% of my stack). But Eth has reached ~.1 ratio earlier this year, so it still has a ton of upside. You could also consider if it's a buy the rumour type of scenario especially so close to Consensus..
If you look at the daily the volume wasn't colossal. The lack of buying was.
I know kung fu
What am I looking at.
1981 called, they want their 4 bit resolution back 
I feel unsafe.
This is aids  
> 100 dollar pump

100 dollar pumps a day keep the losses away!
Taco Tuesday on a Monday !
More like $150, but yes was still a bit of an over reaction.
> 100 dollar pump, calm the fuck down lads.

it is the breakout of the pennant, not less. break\- or fakeout is the next question.
it's not the size, it's the timing
Wicked above it on Stamp for a few seconds, but dropped right back in. 
We're just at the upper trend line as I see it. Would wait a bit. 
I expect $9k+ before the day's end (within 10 hour).
>	 6. Next year: ETH will at this point most likely dethrone BTC as #1 in market cap in 2018-2019. This will really suck for me and I will be extremely frustrated about it, but I will ultimately have to come to terms with the fact that the market has decided something I disagree with. **I am working on a coping mechanism to come to terms with this already.** If you know how much I love BTC, you can imagine how much this sucks already

If this happens then do share your coping mechanism with the rest of us 
I don't understand why people get so uptight about 'flippening'. The only thing they're in competition for is pumper funds. 

I wouldn't use BTC for that home toilet renting app I'm working on. I wouldn't trust ETH with my money's security in the long run. 

They both have a place in largely separate and equally huge areas. 
Might as well post the comment in text form in your comment here so people don't have to click around- on mobile it gets annoying depending on what you're using to read reddit 

Also those are some pretty reasonable predictions. The ETH one is interesting, why do you think there will be a flip?
Why will it hold 7500? That seems arbitrary, what's your thinking?
Agreed with 1 and to some extent with 3.
I was thinking along the same lines, that range bound price action is most likely in the long-term, given the role of BTC as a store of value / trading. 

The flippening also makes sense. After all ETH outperformed BTC last year and if it continues in the same way, then it certainly isn't impossible.

Don't agree with mining being a large part of the future, though.
I have exchange orders for BTC down to 7k. 

I know it's rampant speculation, but I can't ignore EOS 24h volume on 'finex having exceeded BTC several times over recent days. If the mainnet is solid, there's going to be a glut of ETH.

One of the most important roles to be played by blockchain will be in political elections. When do you see this becoming a reality? The tech must be ready, what about public opinion?

does sound like a good personification of bulls 
didn't ETH boycott consensus?
On the daily it's a little hard to tell. I'm watching the 4H though, which should be around 8850
technically it could go till 9.4k but I'd say breach of 9k would make it invalid
This is truly a shit post about shitting.
What's your entry? 
That BGD on April 12th absolutely fucked me and I've not been able to look at a dildo the same way since. 
Violent, not violant.
I don't know, when?

A bear wandering the desert spots an oasis.
Just broke down apparently.
long? short?
Sucker's rally
I believe he said he's not worried until a new high is made- > $8650. 

this really should've been expected for the most part- it would've been very surprising if buyers pushed all the way from $8k to $10k over like 3 weeks just to give it all up in 2 days.
> many of us would be happy to hear that

I think many of you need to stop depending on others to make your trading decisions. I strongly encourage many of you to start learning, observing and doing the analysis by yourself so that you can make the right decisions based on your understanding rather than depending upon others and calling them in times like this.

You are fully responsible for your own trade just like I am for my trades. :) Cheers!
I'm not sure why you'd plan to sell at $10.2k 
I cant tell if this is trolling. Because I would probably short at 9.4 and fomo at 10.2 and consider closing that fomo at 10.6.

Edit: Actually I'm attempting a scalp short right now from 8600's with tight stop losses. And would attempt a more committed short some time before 9.4. I don't mean to be rude if you are being serious, It's just that besides longing 8350, everything else you say is pretty much the opposite of what i might do at that level \(if i did anything at all, 10.6 has no significance to me\), so I'm curious as to any reasons you have besides "gut feeling". Not that I never experience some factor of that..
No stops?
Always smart to trade with your feelings and not the logical part of your brain.

And why didn't you just make your target at $25K for this run?  Just about as realistic.
For me: You just catched a nice entry and are overconfident that this is the real thing. So you wanna sell just above a break\-out above the old top? 
And to balance it out:

!short XBTUSD 8555 25X 20%

Good luck!
big assumption based on what exactly? past consensus events haven't pumped the price
Ballsy. If you're trading the potential bear flag, I usually trade the break out; when price breaches the ascending support line (bottom of flag). Trying to catch the top is a nightmare because you don't know how long the flag is going to be. In some cases, it's almost as long as the flagpole.
lol @ that green candle on the left, this market is retard-o
truuuuuuu
Hmm seems to be popping a little here. 
let's see where it takes us.
It seems to me that sellers can’t move the price lower anymore, which might be a good sign for recovery 

I might be wrong so I’d be happy to be corrected

Quick, people are losing interest in our forgery! Let's make a forgery of a forgery and make some change that adds no significant value so cryptobros will keep buying it because they think can make bank on forks!

I think the reason is that the browser session isn’t active when the screensaver is on.

I think one of the PRO subscriptions of Tradingview offers SMS alerts. Might be worth considering that there’s potentially a very quantifiable capital return on such a premium feature :)
Hmm, the internet also times-out when lock screen goes on right? Maybe you'll have to turn that off manually. I personally use alerts on my phone because its easier for me.
Imo BCH sell off into Eth or BTC, causing a pump. 
I usually go fiat, and then spread out a bunch of buy orders 40% off the current price.

If they get filled, good...if not, I decide what to do with my position when I get back. 
being flat is never bad, although some people dislike losing BTC more than the like losing fiat value.

You can always just set stops to go flat and let your BTC ride
50/50 or something is a good rule. If you feel the need to look at your position, then sell more until you don't feel that need
If I can't access an exchange for more than a day I always hold it in fiat
If you trade on Bitmex go x1 short. It is like staying in fiat.

Hi,

We're sorry to hear you are having issues using a Bitcoin address generated. If you could submit a support ticket here https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/requests/new our support team can help you figure out what maybe wrong.

Thank you!
That’s troubling. It hasn’t happened to me before
It’s been tough for me too. But what I find important is for me to sit back and learn from my actions and emotions. You’ll never become a better trader if you don’t learn from losing money.

My balance sheet is also down from these past few days. But I think I’ve become a slightly better trader in the process.
Looks like some people purchased some bitcoin in that period of time.
hardly big
Zoom out.
you posted the exact same thing a short while ago...
You can now buy it back at 8500. Nice swing trade man!
Selling gold for $1 per ounce makes perfect sense when you know you can buy it back for $.90 per ounce.
buying btc at $8600 is like buying btc at $3k just more expensive 
I'll give you $3 an ounce.
I support you, Chad!
mega breakout upwards or downwards?
It can go either way and considering how weak the market has been, I"m betting it drops further from this bear flag.
I agree and expect mega, or lets just call it a breakout for the time being in upward direction in near future. 
Give it time, it neither broke down or up yet, we just trade inside it. A decisiion which way we take will be made before the end of this day for sure!
> $8750 would be 50% fib, for what it's worth.

50% Fib of which movement? 

50% Fib of the rise from 6.4 to 10 is at 8.2.
It’s weird it Paints a different story depending on what exchange you were looking at. I had stamp breaking out and and briefly using it as support before falling back in. Gdax/finex  painting a fakeout, and xbtusd perp swaps touching the line and got denied perfectly. 




What makes you think the price has an obligation to remain in a formation you draw?
Gotta let us know the timeframe for us to provide feedback, playa.
Yeah, I'd say too short and based on their small scale the difference in price is too substantial. It's really more a pennant for now which might turn into an ascending triangle. 
Too short, even for bitcoin, IMO.
I'm going to take this FUD, shine it up real nice, turn it sideways and shove it up your candy ass.
I was/am an early investor in Sia. This is total biased bullshit.

They are *still* mega-mega-MEGA butthurt about Bitmain beating them to market with their ASIC -- a project the Sia/Obelisk team should have ***NEVER*** pursued.

All is fair in business & war. If you can't/won't deliver in an emerging market, somebody else will certainly step up. That's all that happened here.
How so?
2014 was a completely different market. 
Could you elaborate for us, please?
no, it doesn't starting.
Nope 
Absolutely, I’m looking forward to $3k BTC prices.
Probably should have waited til this dip bottomed out
Continue ze dump. 
Bitfinex, you can swap between currencies and sometimes you get great returns. Currently for USD around 20&#37; per year...

there have been days where you got 0.7&#37; per day. but these times never last long. 
what is it with people posting hindsight trades

If you traded, then don’t tell us about it unless its rn
You wish you were short from 9625 :)
8625 maybe 
What nonsense? We've been in a bear market since January.
Can you show (with charts, or indicators) why you think so? Or is it just a 'gut feeling'? Some people here think we are painting a [bear flag](https://www.investopedia.com/university/charts/charts6.asp) which will break down within the next few hours/days.
Like they say, stairs up, elevator down.
You can close it at break even in 30-60 min.
Still not even thinking about it?
That depends on if you're offloading coin to make money right now, or if you're offloading coin to drop the price hard so you can accumulate more coin to sell at a later date with a higher price.
up to what price though.. :(
This guy is obviously a troll, can any mod ban him?

That article is older than the recent run-up and nose dive lol.

Why?
!short XBTUSD 8561.50 10X 
Consider: selling at 9400, buying back at 8200. Selling again at 8800, buying back at 8400. That gives you more BTC. How is that “burning money”?
Maybe losing money is a fetish for you? 
what? You do the opposite of wht you did to open it
You said sub 6k yesterday. Stop trolling.

Next stop 8630ish - let's see... Not convinced, yet
BCH "performed" better because it has even **shittier** liquidity than BTC. 
[deleted]
I'm a simple man. I see the word "cuck" and I down vote.

That BCH supporters need to resort to this kind of talk, and engage in all kinds of underhanded methods to usurp BTC, makes it look toxic and scammy. It cheapens any fundamentals it might have, because clearly those aren't enough to rely on.

I feel dirty even just shorting it on Mex because I don't want to give it volume.
Roger Ver is that you? But really, how does anyone take people like this seriously?
These childish BCH Vs BTC slagging matches are the most mundane and pathetic thing about the whole Crypto space. 

I'd love to lock all the gobshites in a room and throw in a load of weapons then let them all fight to the death. Last person standing wins a date with John McAfee.

Let's be honest now, it's gonna be a card either way.
Lol that's awesome. happy mothers day 
Sorry, I meant fellow degenerates!
He’s using it as a term of endearment. Be more sensitive. 
*whoooooosh*
why not accumulate at 5k if you are 6k? I imagine, accumulation does not necessarily happen at the lowest price point, it happens at a range where you can wreck both long and shorts
There was a ton of accumulation in the week before the BGD. 
That was by far the largest market order in the past 6 hours, nothing even comparable. https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/volume/6h?c=e&t=b
the "the whales are doing this" rhetoric here the past few days is very similar to the "wtf manipulation" comments we saw after the BGD (including my own)

Also not shorting a bull market on a slight dip.
Can't argue with that.
Yep. I thought I was getting better at it as well! When you get a good entry it is all so calm and easy. Just have a plan and you know you can't lose much

When you're out of position it is a much harder place to be especially in a situation with potential bgd and brd all over the shop
you made me laugh mate

i'm still learning how to trade based on TA so i'm not sure about anything
>The neckline\(The top of the low\-volume rally\) is 8650

without the wicks it is more around 8.8k, if we break up from the pennant we are in this could be the top of this short\-term rally.
I have to say that I'm inclined to take the Consensus thing in consideration as well. I know it might have no effect, but than again... could generate some hype, self fulfilling prophecy aspect, etc. 
8.65 clears you of yesterdays high . . 100 day EMA is at 8735 on 1HR Bitfinex chart . . may be a strong resistance point.
user name checks out: likes harvesting baby brains to eat and always long rat poison.  All before Charlie Munger made the reference ...unless you are Charlie?.. and you were just throwing FUD to BTFD.

It all makes sense now.
> You could always do 15% now and 15% later.

Great idea thanks
It does though. It's about how much you can accumulate at the bottom. If you see BTC going 100k + and the price difference of a few thousand now means you can afford .5 BTC or 1 BTC then that's a big deal.
Haha to be fair, there is another poll from a while back where majority (or plurality can't remember) of people predicted we'd be ranging from $8k-12k in a month. And we did

But yea, that's the point of these straw polls. I want to see if we can prove/disprove that there's any meaningful correlation between sentiment and market movement. It's obviously not a rigid study or anything but it's fun to look at

Also: look, the gap is closing. I have personally noticed that vote totals will be out of whack for a bit before one side comes in and balances it out. Bears tend to vote faster than bulls in the 4 straw polls I've posted. For some reason they are more active on the daily it seems, despite them being the minority overall
poll is perfectly split now lol 
Obviously you have to look at both scenarios and not just jump in to a trade. 

What I'm saying is the buy wall that was around from the pump at 6500 moved up with the price and if this does the same thing now its an indication of the direction we are going to be moving in.

If we drop and it doesn't show up then its a fake wall, but if it pops up again, that means someone wants the price to go up.

Not too sure, I'm looking at the charts on cryptowat.ch
Yup, you're right.  Thanks.
Thx, I just saw this post. I really don't have time to post every trade, and I usually only exit in increments unless I see a reason otherwise. I don't know if I'll use that bot or not in the future. When I do a trade I usually enter with more than I want for position size then reduce when it goes my way. Set up stops and partial sell orders. By the time I get to post to that Bot price has moved and then someone will complain that I wasn't honest. Making money is Kudos enough for me, don't need to impress any one. I saw you like to watch order book, found that interesting. Any tips or ideas on what to watch for? I've been trading several decades & have done well by my own indicators, a bit different than most. Always enjoy learning though especially from unconventional traders which I am.
what's the confirmation for C&H here? gonna go mortgage my house to buy in.
You think it's gonna chop around 8500-8700 for a bit? A bit disappointing there isn't much steam before the Consensus tomorrow.  I also bailed on my underwater long, but at least it wasn't as deep underwater.
No just dark theme/night mode
Did you open on the way up or on the way down? Just curious. $8550 was an odd place to open a short, but I tried to tell you that $8750 wasn't a bad place to open a short :( which meant you shouldve probably held thru it. well obviously now yes but ya
Not for me, but i'll be moving stops at least to see if 8200 will be tested again. Held from 8420, added @8580 and cried above that. Don't want to be stopped in a wick though... Stops around 8650 for now. 
Don’t trade drunk. 
Stops are at break-even now (minor profit). If 8400 falls with conviction, I'll probably move them down a little lower (1% maybe), especially since the futures premium is gone, but I don't want to exit this early. This could end up being an absurdly lucrative position.
First target is 8200. If we get there, stops go to 8500. Then I'll be watching for 7800. 
i luckily exited my long before the dump, but what about the charts for “textbook” for a bearish reversal? 
Just trying to increase my knowledge :) 
I have had many, many nightmares where BTC is suddenly trading for $4.00 and it seems like the end of the world.
hahah man it was hard the first couple days/week, I felt like some part of my life was missing \(because it was\), but afterwards it was all good. I could easily see myself living a good happy life without crypto but I guess we're too far down the rabbit hole already.
Me too
Is it time to obsess now, daddy?
Agreed. It seems I chose the best time to take a break aswell, prior to this dip we're seeing now, the price had just chopped around the 9000s for the entire time.
Truth. Good to see you, by the way...don't be a stranger!
You're right, do you know the exact dates Consensus was last year? Looking at todays charts makes me think some people are getting nervous and cashing in before Consensus in fear they'll miss their opportunity to sell at a decent price.
That sounds like a pretty good idea actually, as\-long as you trust the exchange with your funds. 
I had to include the bullish scenario so I didn't upset too many people, no matter how unlikely it is.
could do this or flag positions that are opened in real time with a flag. So you could open a position in retrospect and put a price from before or you could just not put a price and put a flag like -realtime so it just takes current price and then puts a gold star next to them. 

nothing wrong with opening backdated trades, but there should be a distinction between them and real-time trades so people know which are more "legit"
If it moves money around, flexibility is not a Word you like. Strictiness is more like it :) 
just read it now. 
Yeah but the entry wasn't that good and I hold it through 8200 yesterday but did not want to close at break even to see where things went. Now  it is up 15% at least (10x leverage) so it's a good profit
No I am long from 8550 still
Yeah, this seems similar to that. I felt bearish so far but if we break 8650 and post a higher high than yesterday then that could be pretty bullish I guess. Just for fun, yesterday's high was 3 hours after the BGD.

I still dont know what to think about the Consensus. Sell the news event or the opposite?
Yea, that stupid Bill Gates must keep mixing up shorting with longing.
Yes, big green dildo.
Thanks! :) I wanted to hold as well. But then I recalculated and found out if I make the right moves, I can maximize my gains. Also reminded me of the term being 'married to the position'.

In one case it was really profitable when I closed my long from $8,000 last month walking away with 11.15% gains. On the other hand, it also reminded me of my short from $8,735, which got liquidated just close to $10,000.

>  I'm still holding my long from 8443

No harm in doing that, but I think you must have price where you would lock in your profits in case if this retraces back a bit as said above.
I think I can agree with you to some extent now that we might be approaching $10,000 again.We break it or not is a matter of time. :)
> who trades oil and corn to actually hedge/consume?

Refiners, drilling companies, oil/gas firms, and farmers.  


Mind sharing the indicators you rely on?
You realise that with bots following the same methodology TA in crypto is very likely largely a self fulfilling prophecy.

However, if you come from the financial world you'll know that TA is taken with a VERY LARGE pinch of salt in traditional finance, let alone crypto. 

It seems most amateur hour traders in crypto have just jumped on the TA band wagon having searched Google and then make their predictions fit the narrative after the event, you see that here on a daily basis.  
> I have a feeling most people who say that either trade very long term trends or they just don't want to deal with all the bullshit that comes with trading.

(Yeah that...or they are utterly and totally clueless and absolutely no hope for them with trading, or probably most any other area of life.)

And it was just random coincidence that BTC spiked $1000 when it hit that long downtrend line a couple of weeks ago.
If we can make the assumption that crypto markets can be and are manipulated to a significant degree, then logically it would follow that any indicators/TA is a product of said manipulation as well. 

You know those street vendors that let you play the game with 3 cups and you have to guess which cup has an object underneath? Even they know it's best to let the their customers win sometimes, otherwise nobody would play their game. I think it's sort of the same in crypto. That's also probably why the pretty simple stuff seems to work well compared to the complicated stuff, it wouldn't make sense to create signals the majority of your target audience doesn't understand.

Isn't taking TA with a very large pinch of salt pretty much the same as TA not being very trustworthy? It is when you can spot the bluff/lie that is presented to you in the form of indicators that you are successful. You also have to be in the minority for it to be profitable, it being a zero-sum game after all.

If you want people to invest as much as possible, you want to inspire confidence that their trades will be profitable, even if it turns out otherwise in the end. Some people can be influenced by news and articles, others by greed ("xxx has risen over 9000% in value over such a short time!") and fear (value of xxx has plummeted spectacularly), well emotions in general. Then there is the type of investor who tries not to let emotions make decisions for him, how do you inspire confidence in him? Give him some charts that have patterns to analyze and make sure to follow those patterns for example 1/3 of the time so that he feels he isn't making random decisions based on emotions.

The thing with those charts is, they are supposedly neutral ground to base your decisions on when in fact they're not. To me, it just doesn't feel right to call interpreting said charts technical analysis because it leads to people drawing parallels between crypto markets and the stock market for example, which are two very differently behaving things in my opinion even though they appear to be similar. Trading in crypto markets (as of right now) resembles online poker quite a bit to be honest, the most important thing besides knowing the rules is the ability to read your opponent properly, you make the most money by either bluffing successfully or reading your opponents bluff. Only when talking about very long time frames the equivalent of fundamental analysis becomes a very valuable tool to base your investing strategy upon (in this context by fundamental analysis I mean which token/technology becomes the most useful in the future).

The ones who have the resources to move prices in the direction they wish know there are people like you who base their investments on technical analysis and seek to exploit this fact for their own benefit. There are people who have enough bitcoins who can make the charts look like anything they want and nobody will challenge them because it would probably require an utterly senseless amount of fiat for them to give up all that control (bitcoins).

I think it would make sense to use a different word for 'TA' in the context of cryptos. 
What simple tools and indicators do you use successfully if you don’t mind me asking? I am more of a hodler than a trader but I am working on learning to trade in the short term. 
As much as I admire your optimism, current regulations on traditional markets have done little. Insider trading [is still](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bioverativ-insidertrading-sec/u-s-sec-files-suit-over-possible-insider-trading-on-bioverativ-idUSKBN1FG02M) very [rampant](http://www.businessinsider.com/equifax-data-breach-trading-suspicious-after-hack-now-under-federal-investigation-2017-9) in most [industries](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/04/05/house-committee-insider-trading-navient-consumer-financial-protection-bureau/100087228/) and [politicians as well](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/14/congress-stock-trading-conflict-of-interest-rules-238033).

There's manipulation in both. The question is in which do big players have market power... well, probably crypto, since you don't need to pay extra to have real time access to price/quote/book data.
I’m taking profits as I go. Took slight profit at 8480. I’ll stop it if we get to 8250 area
I’m not caught up. I still believe we are on a downtrend. I’ll cut this position early if I think it’s right. Bears have been unable to get it under 8200. If the market can hold this support till Monday when there is supposed to be “big industry news” we likely can make a move up. 
Because I'm actively watching the market movement here and I don't see much enthusiasm. 

I'd rather lose a bit more on this short than cut it prematurely. 
Babysitting my positions is what I do best. Sorry Mom.

When do you think you'll give up on this one?   8850 also?
I got wicked out of mine so reopening again as well. 

!short xbtusd 8640 10x 40%
$8,800 has served as strong sort support in recent history. If the market makes it to $8,850, then there's a strong possibility this whole dump is a bear trap. 
You're still so bearish?

Support established at 6.5 stopped that drop, we bounced off 8.2, making higher lows since then.

On the other hand this may look like bear flag or ascending wedge.
thanks for this, it is remarkable how perfectly we follow this pattern so far, if we drop down in the next day, it would be astonishing. 
This! I needed someone who explained exactly this. Asked it earlier here. So do you think that a triple bottom on the daily is likely ? 

So distribution happened, what's left to distribute now?
The question is if we will see a throwback and how high it will go.
So, if you are sitting in fiat, what would you do right now?  Thanks!
That Wyckoff chart is scary- can anyone provide a counterpoint to this? It just looks too good to be true. Have there been cases in BTC lifespan where Wyckoff phases have been invalidated?
Do you think consensus is going to change any of this?
We're not going anywhere near 7.8 in the near future if ever. If we do, it will be extremely brief so keep your fiat dry.
We’ll see. Good thing I’m mainly a hodler. I trade a small amount and only lost a little based on trying to read the sentiment here yesterday which was so doom and gloom.  I imagine many shorters trading on margin are getting raped today.   If we hit 9k today then wtf is the point of all this TA when the price does the opposite of what the majority projects?
So short it. 

The dump of Thursday was clearly manufactured, and I'm guessing somebody will need to cover a large number of borrowed coins soon. 

Historically, it's seldom a wise idea to short Bitcoin, but sometimes you get lucky. I don't trust luck. I like math, and math says we're going up if your attention span is longer than that of a house cat.
Lol.

This broke the triangle, but we're still in a wedge and flag, so still gonna regret this tomorrow ;-)
happy mouse house
Would be an alive cat fall if anything.
*I've been through the markets on a dip with no name*

*It felt good to inflict maximum pain*

*In these markets, you can't remember the game*

*'Cause there ain't no one who isn't insane*   

It just hasn't lasted the past month or more. These movements always end up bouncing in terms of the futures premium.

A good play here would be to long the futures premium, and short the asset on another exchange. I've done the opposite (short the premium, and long the asset) when the premium gets out of control, and if you're patient it has been very profitable.
that wall tried to hold things up at $8600 before, and it got destroyed in a day. I think someone is basically stair-casing the price down while they sell off
exactly, you and every other guy.

And with way more longs than shorts opened....if it goes down, it'll go down hard. 

If you look past the big wall, the first time you see a wall that's bigger than 400 BTC is at $6500

Bitcoin tends to go in the direction of the ultimate pain, and at this moment its the longs that are primed for a proper fucking  
[deleted]
Right, that's why they announced SegWit during last year's Consensus.
Alts don't exist to many people on here.  If there is more demand for crypto, then 100% of that goes to BTC.   Well except when people sell their altcoins and all that money flows into BTC.
I'm not at break even. It's 8720 on June futs, so it's a little underwater currently. 
That's a dangerous place to be, but I get it. I strongly expect either a massive pump or a massive dump off the daily close. I've got pretty tight market stops up above us, and I'm ready to GTFO it looks like a BGD. I just don't see the fuel for it right now. It feels precarious to me. GDAX volume is absurdly low (not that I put a lot of stock in GDAX), but There are a lot of longs from below just waiting for it to look like this is dumping to take profits. Lots of shorts also waiting to see if it breaks up to cut losses. It's basically whoever sneezes first. 
I'm in the same boat as you but you should be ready to cut your losses and move on. Sunk cost fallacy and all that jazz.
No worries, I've stops in place. Fairly tight too.

Edit - and triggered.
My stop is not a real stop though. It's just an alarm. This will bull flag or go down here. I don't expect this to go much higher before some consolidation or a retrace.
Please stop. Your comments are juvenile, uninformed, and annoying.
Per ambycrypto.com:

“The Bitcoin Cash fork is scheduled at 12:00:00 UTC, which includes the upgradation of block size to up to 32MB and several Bitcoin Cash Opcodes which were deactivated earlier will be reactivated. Also, they have added protocol extension points for the development of colored coins and simplified smart contracts that can perform automated functions. These protocols use a scripting system in the transactions.”
the volume is actually down on all crypto

on polo BCH had a whopping 275 BTC worth of trading in the last 24 hours. ETH had 986 BTC.  LTC had 172 BTC. These numbers were 10x that 1-2 months ago. 

Personally I feel that the normies are just too scared to buy after a 100% pump in a month. 
You have a rich imagination, you should write soap operas....
Underwater much?
Hope so!  I've decided not to add if it bounces back though. I'll close at BE if we head back up.
Consensus will not save this rally. 
Edit, stop set for 8610 now. Don't feel like losing money on this trade so I'm out if we get back to break-even.
Sundays do not almost always close red. 
Thanks. Yeah I was thinking scaled stops from 8.6 to 8.5 and scaled limit sells from 8.8 to 9.1. Reenter if we blow by those numbers. 
I think this is good advice, but I'd put the stop maybe a little lower, like 8560. 
Why everyone was talking about 8.8 on the way down and now many are talking about it again?  

We smashed through 8.8 like nothing on the way down

>The only true bullish indicator that the bear market has ended is a break of 20k or at least 11,5k.

We'll have bears claiming low volume once we break $11.7k, a double top as we approach $20k, and "overbought" at $20,001.

I did. Thanks
Sorry, I'm just now seeing this.

When it comes to buying and selling pressure, I'm really looking for which side is Market buying/selling and which side is just letting their orders be sold or bought into.

Large green or red candles on the 1h. 

Slowly grinding up or down is generally indicative of weak pressure in the direction the market is drifting. 
Ha, probably closer to 60% these days. 
I don't measure that way. Each trade is unique. 

But all in all, I'm pretty close to breakeven between the short from $9,100, the mistimed long from $8,420, and the short I just closed from $8,400.

Especially since these happen, green and red, multiple times a day during above average periods of volatility. Someone just bought some coin.

I’m out walking my dog, we got one about the same time yesterday and the price returned where it came from within hours.
Explain?
Still eyeing 8650 before bailing on your short? I added to mine @8850 bringing my average to around 8500.
Thanks, I was also watching Bitstamp. On the look of it, with RSI still showing oversold conditions on the 4-hourly, and price touching the lower bband on the 20-day MA, there should be room for spending a few days in this region, maybe a bit up, but isn't the volume at such meager levels that any upward move carries high risk and price could suddenly break down? 

Edit: Continuing up now for some tens of $ at least. How to make sense of this?
Seems like price is continuing up some more. To me, the last 48-72 hours looks like a "parabola bottom", if that's a thing. Or the Eve part of AE bottom.
Why?
Still looks pretty bear flaggy, my friend. :-P

...your home toilet renting app?
> I wouldn't use BTC for that home toilet renting app

Any shitcoin will do.
I have been through the ringer since 2011 and I think ETH is a huge sham. I think Vitalik is a joke who stood on the shoulders of giants and paid a lot of people to build Ethereum, but for some reason everyone considers him boy genius and the creator of Ethereum, when in fact Gavin was the brains of the operation.
Didn’t wanna clutter the daily.

I think ETH will flip because so many devs are working on ETH. I think the projects are currently big nothing burgers compred to work and research going on in Bitcoin (Lightning, Mimble Wimble, Schnorr Sigs, Bullet Proofs,  Cross-chain Swaps), but most people don’t even know that a public key is not a number, but a point on an elliptic curve over a finite field, so in the end shit like Crypto Kitties (which is retarded from every angle I look at it) will attract the most attention and money. Eventually ETH will be like Facebook is now (full of garbage that bloats it’s entire raison d’être, but it will still be useful for its originally intended purposes).

I spent a lot of time in nightclubs this weekend and I finally understood that the entire world is full of plebs who are dumb as a rock and just wanna wear shiny jewelry, buy cheap clothes at the expense of poor people and drink a ton of alcohol in hopes of getting laid. These people will use anything with a nice front end, regardless of security implications.

It’s just a matter of time before ETH simply becomes so centralized that it’s fast too.
nice write up. yea explain the eth flippening prediction. 
Lows are 6k, 6.4k

Highs are 11.7k and 10k

Both about two months aprt in each case

If you draw that triangle it meets somewhere in the 7k range

7.5k is a psychological number and ~50% of the price on 1.1.2018
in my opinion PoW based consensus is perfect 

I think we will all be mining one day as part of our “controbution” to the global democracy.

I accept it is a bit outlandish, but I don’t think there’s another way to achieve a global consensus
I think the world isn’t ready for elections on a blockchain. I think it will happen in this century, but no clue when
CREATE TABLE DISASTER AS

SELECT AVERAGE(PRICE) FROM BTC

6.8-6.9k is highly probable if 8.2k breaks down. [I posted a similar theory recently](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8j1gi0/comment/dywpm4m).
At the worst it’s a different perspective then what we’ve all been thinking, at best its what’s currently happening. The lack of bounce has me concerned with this perspective, but then again straight up isn’t really the bull way. 
Maybe I confused that with this one https://www.gbaglobal.org/event/ethereal-summit-2018-by-consensys/

Honestly, I am expecting rather decent moves from the traders rather than any sort of surprises. 
Most people on here are learning and making calls, but it helps to know the perspective of someone with years more experience. They'll most likely see or consider something a newer trader hasn't even learned about yet. 

Edit: on that note, if I see chewtoy make a call and reference something I've never heard of, that gives me a point to research. Not necessarily blindly follow their calls
It's not trolling.  This is common for this sub.  A $100 rise and desperate permabulls are once again convinced we are back in a raging bull market.

They did actually 
Last year consensus began the BTC pump to 20k. BTC will be dragged by raising alts during the Consensus, from then on it will be on its own but if the general sentiment is any indication, it will go up. Every where I look there is assumption of a consensus pump (even assumed by coindesk itself). A self fulling prophecy like TA, but with much more mojo. 
Would the pole be at 9.4 or at 9?
I miss the times when it was more clear. Now I look at the chart and I start to think is this a wedge, ascending triangle or a bear flag...
lmao right??
Pretty sure that Green Candle says everything you need to know about this market:

Some group of people were not happy selling at 6k, saw shorts pile on, so they squeeze the shit out of the market to incite a FOMO rally that falls just short of the moon target.

Now they ladder the price back down so they can sell more, and once they’re all out of BTC:

One way ticket to Goblin Town

I mean, for people like me it’s simply insane that BTC is anywhere near 10k in 2018. I mean, we were at 150 3 years ago. Even if we go back to 1k, Bitcoin is still extremely valuable as a store of value for people who bought back then. I just feel kinda bad for people who put in a ton above 10k :(
Yeah this is shown in those symmetric triangle formations people have posted then, market squeezes in from first 100s, then 50, then 10s in matter of price action for a violent move
> It seems to me that sellers can’t move the price lower anymore

I am afraid there aren't many sellers left in the market. We have seen massive sells in the last few days. Market has been pretty stable in the last 12 hours or so. 

People are still selling for cheaper prices, the chances are people will buy the same coins they just sold at higher prices in near future.
If fees skyrocket again, it will change your view drastically I think.

I think 7500 is almost guaranteed between now and year’s end.

I think we could bounce back up to 9k+ in the short term, but I’m not betting the farm on that.

What I anticipate will happen is the following:

1. Today: BTC will bear flag up to 8800+, maybe even 9k+.

2. This week: Consensus will give ETH a small pump to ~0.1 on the ratio (maybe)

3. Next week: At week’s end we’ll see things come down back to 8200-ish and then I believe 8200 will fall

4. This month: An overreaction to sub 7k by June is possible, but overall we will probably be range-bound with 7.5k ultimately being our mean for the entire summer.

5. This year: Eventually the long-term log support/trend line will meet 7.5k and we will continue our ascent to organic highs as BTC gains mainstream adoption as a means of exchange for consumers and institutions.

6. Next year: ETH will at this point most likely dethrone BTC as #1 in market cap in 2018-2019. This will really suck for me and I will be extremely frustrated about it, but I will ultimately have to come to terms with the fact that the market has decided something I disagree with. I am working on a coping mechanism to come to terms with this already. If you know how much I love BTC, you can imagine how much this sucks already

7. This decade (ie. by 2020): Cross chain swaps will become ubiquitous in the future and the entire world will basically run on one huge interoperable network of blockchains using hash-time-locked contracts to enable information exchange

8. This century: Once Quantum Computing starts to do some awesome stuff, we will move to quantum strong pub key scripts and use quantum entanglement to run a global relay network for these blockchains... maybe photonic network instead of quantum, but one of the two for sure

9. One day: At some point virtually every person on this planet will run some heavily commoditized form of asics to secure the entire global blockchain interstate.
I presume you meant LIFO? (I'm in the UK and we don't have the luxury of choosing!)
Thank you, I'll look into that. However, the internet does not time-out on my Mac when screen is locked. For example, a VPN connection still stays active and does not disconnect.

I also use the bitcoin ticker on my phone, but with Tradingview I like the fact that you can put alarms on any arbitrary line (not necessarily horizontal), including any indicators. It is much more flexible.
Cool. Thank you, sir.  I like the ridiculously low bid idea.
Thanks. Flat is no position, all in USD right?
Wait, you should get 8400 soon!
Yup and the next fib is at 8633, keeps bouncing between both. Which is why I'll open a long only if 8630 is broken with conviction and holds.
The most recent big drop.
Damn.. I just look at Bitfinex to be honest. Do you use cryptowatch and tradingview or is there some other website where you can view different exchanges more conveniently?
Sorry, I meant yesterdays and todays high as a double top.
It's an excellent article. Don't comment unless you read it.

It's circulating among many reputable folks on twitter.
It's not really FUD. If anything it's bullish.
Yes.
Maybe
No.
aladeen
How so?
4 or 5 bounces off of the log downtrend line before breaking through. Followed up by bullish push upwards, which resulted in a bulltrap before a slow bleed downwards to new lows. We're currently in the midst of this bulltrap, if this all plays out the same way. Timing is pretty similar (actually remarkably similar that both started in Dec/Jan) and the percent changes aren't too different either. 2014 had a stronger break through the downtrend line though.

Overall, looks pretty similar to me, so far, but that doesn't mean that it'll play out the same way, of course. 
I figure conference next week should pump it up. I’m long term so whatever 
20% return for lending USD?? Is that real?
lots of people wait until they're 1-2% in the green before posting cause they think that means they ll close in profit. check back on these positions in a week and most of them will be in the red and the person won't say when they closed lol
So about that % difference and post character limit....haha
I was but then closed the postition at 8300 then reopened the short now
Winner winner chicken dinner. 
You are crazier than me. About to close my short (underwater). This really doesn't look good for bears now 
Report his shitpost like I just did.
A number of factors that add up to a gut feel. It seems we have reached a reasonable bottom with a new high from the previous 6k drop, positive fundamental news has vastly outweighed fud (IMHO) and if you zoom right out to 6-12 month view / look at the base level uptrend a rise would make sense 
Because.
!short XBTUSD 8561 10X 100%
Never mind I found on the website.
Yup, remember to use RES and tags folks.
He's actually very bearish long term and perhaps he will turn out to be right, who knows.

This 'going to 10k to 15 k' is the troll.  He loves injecting himself in places to get a reaction.

Just putting this out there in case others aren't sure and are about to get worked up lol
I can't recall saying that. Mind refreshing my memory??
LOOL same
Might be a good time to reshort this honey badger, but waiting until morning to do so
Yuh. Kept my short from 9350 but my stopped got wicked, so I opened another one. Only 3x right now.

Lots of moving averages and horizontal resistance in the upper 8ks
Short from 8500 10x 100% (edit... that’s the June futs entry)

Not in profit, so am I doing it right? 
! short 8758 caught the top wick on the dollar. 50x 100%. /s

lol these guys. I am proud of my 8795 june futures add, though. 8812 was the top. 
Like me, short from 8500 and sweating bullets :) 
Well it's kinda difficult to eat, trade and shitpost at the same time. I did enter it around 55 minutes ago after u/nothingyoubegin and it went underwater immediately if that makes you feel better. 
I'm so manly I post my limit orders weeks before I cancel them from not triggering
yeah agreed

!short XBTUSD 9999999 100X 100%
Without thermos's censorship in the major information outlets, Bitcoin cash may not have needed the EDA to survive.

Made me laugh tbh lol
Sometimes I am away from reddit but still trade from my phone. Just a thought. 
Serious question, why would one bother with LTC? I get the whole atomic swaps theory and its dominant age amongst other alts, but why else? 
lol no, much more likely a troll trying to undermine BCH.

Or, looking at its comment history, just a troll.

You’re right, I’m going to have to buy more BTC to help support the rally. I’m sure she’ll understand.
Thank you! I always appreciate your analysis, BTW.
The word fellow could imply a man or boy, how dare you assume my gender!
Exactly, but I imagined one week was not enough time for accumulation. I was expecting something more like months.
Did you miss the 3k btc market sell/buy a few weeks ago? an 800 btc market sell really isn't that crazy on finex
This
Wait til you learn more, you will be even less sure. I miss thinking it goes straight up/down 
Ha I’m watching this one too. Although with so much support & resistance near this area I’d be surprised if it bolted more than $300 in either direction. Although this is bitcoin so anything could happen!
Duly noted. Thanks!
Never actually thought about it like that.

But then again buying yesterday would have been better than buying today and the same could be said about tomorrow.

There's not really a perfect entry for holding. 

Just buy and hold, add to it if the price drops. 

Imo bears have a far shorter outlook in their trades, where bulls spot traders can forget about btc for a few hours if its not going their way
Buy walls (that are spoofs) are putting pressure on bots to place bids into ask walls.
At least $9400, but really $10000 to be 'safe'. That's pretty much where all the other important resistance points are at, anyway -- so not a bad idea to mortgage the house if / when those break!
I think Consensus is not going to have nearly the effect people are touting. If we break down out of our descending triangle (right on the support line now), I doubt we'll see 8700 again for a little while.  

https://www.tradingview.com/x/GJMbYP3r/
I shorted from 9300 to 8300, then longed to 8600. I was going to open a short around 8800 but wanted a day off and didn't think there'd be much movement, especially not sudden enough to need to be in position beforehand. Aaand here we are.

This is a hard one because 8400 to me is dead middle of where this can really go either way. I think I might just ladder buys below and sells above.
Shorted 8350, closed, reshorted 8550. Now we're in no mans land again. Staying out of position and pissed as hell. My own fault. Will take a breather to avoid revenge trading.
At 8200 you just set the stops, or did you take some profit too?

Short also, I slept through the chance to take some at the lowest point, but set a similar stop. (after a couple bad moves last weekend I was expecting to wake up to liquidation, not profit)
> I could easily see myself living a good happy life without crypto

AFTER we make $1M

let's get itttt
If you have enough money to retire, then go for it.  If not, then trading is not a bad job, compared to most.  It is stressful and involves long hours sometimes, but great to work for yourself.  And if you are a good trader, the money is sure good.
I'll answer for him....yes.   Although there really hasn't been a good break in market volatility for well over a year.  Before that, you would have two straight months with very little volatility and instead just chop.  That was the best time to take off from trading.

I believe it was May 22 to 24.
Fair enough, though if the only authentication required is a reddit pw, I can't imagine keeping anything I wouldn't be willing to fat-finger away. 
I think it will be easy, if not quite easy to break $8,650. Posting a higher high could definitely be a bullish sign as you said. Most people have already sold their stacks, so now they are back in fiat, which gives them the buying power they were previously lacking.

There used to be a time when I used to take consensus into consideration, not anymore I think. The only things/factors I look at; observe; and; make my trading decisions based upon are the trades table, order book (it is very dynamic), charts, and probability.
I hope he forget all about the BTC market.  The last thing we need is him shorting to make a point.
Yeah of course, but I bet most of the trading is from speculators
Well, it's really a combination of things. I use horizontal lines, RSI divergences, and volume profiles.

It's a lot of experience as well, there's not much I use that says "yes, do this exactly now."

It's also primarily a risk/reward thing. 
yes I know that, and I take TA with a massive grain of salt. I stick to some pretty simple stuff- none of the ichimoku shit or the fancy shmancy indicators.

Also most bots are quantitative analysis, not TA. 

I just stick to stuff like important price points (horizontal resistance), volume profiles, and sometimes divergences

I suggest you look into longer term trading- short term traders can kind of get wrecked. Short term indicators are good for finding tops/bottoms (entries) but other than that I'd try to hold trades out for a longer amount of time than most people here do.
It's not optimism - obviously you can't ever totally eliminate all forms of market manipulation. But the degree to which it occurs in crypto markets, and the ease with which it can be accomplished, is an order of magnitude more common.
oh okay, so you have a rough plan.

thought you were going in completely blind sort of thing
Makin' me sweat here Chew. In principle, I agree - I feel if buyers were interested we would've blown past 8650 already. I suppose buying can be hesitant and still go up, but it'll be precarious. I don't know if it'll work out in our favor, and it'll be rough being underwater, but I think I'll follow your stops on this one. 
I think this pumps could be from the same origin of those 2000 buy walls on the way down. They have accumylated and now trying to jump start a rally. 
The enthusiasm is on ETH which will drag btc up with it, but to where?
the perfect son-lol
!short XBTUSD 8650 5X 40% 
I opened with 40%. I'll add 10% at 8700, the other 50% at 8780, and I'll bail over 8850 probably. Would be a rough two days of trading if that occurs. I'm weirded out by this rise out of nowhere, and even moreso by the huge bleed off futures premium despite pumping. 
Position saved with success.

Open positions can be checked @ [BitcoinMarkets Open Positions](http://bitcoinmarkets.atwebpages.com/)


Thanks for replying.  

Given this prior support, I infer that you believe there will be substantial resistance at 8800 , so why close the short at 8710?  Wouldn’t a bounce off resistance at 8800 Potentially bring your trade back into profitable territory?  

Follow-up, now that you are sidelined, are you waiting to see what happens at 8800 to determine the next move?  


https://www.tradingview.com/x/KYhkn3cV/

look at the hidden bear divs, we got rejected off top of symmetrical triangle incredibly hard yet again. to be fair there is a hidden bull div from the $6k to $6.5k but that's because the daily closed at like $7k the first time around. we would have to break down below the symmetrical triangle to get another hidden bull div. 

following wyckoff distribution perfectly.

Yes it's possible we go up here but nothing has changed, this has all been the result of a big short squeeze. the buy pressure is very weak and I'm completely unconvinced of this run-up anymore. After a near 20% drop we have managed to bounce about 4% on very low volume :/
I am really surprised at it too- I have even suspected that a larger player is a wyckoffian trader or something because it looks too perfect
I can't really predict the future, I just try to look at what's happened and follow the trend it's showing me. the trend is generally down. 

Yes, a triple bottom off $6k is possible and more likely than a few permabears here would like to admit. It would be insanely bullish. but a triple bottom wouldn't confirm until like $12k

the breakout above the symmetrical triangle is also possibly the pattern to watch
a mark down comes after the distribution, according to the Wyckoff stuff
yup, I'm not saying I'm 100% certain it will go down...I just, ya know. Think it will
keep waiting, the time to buy was $8.2-8.3k. this spot is a gamble.

It could definitely go up here, I just am inclined to think it will go down
Looking at the possibility to go long in $8,500 range, preferably from as close as possible from $8,500.

Didn't noticed this question was part of the post, not a new post. lol.
The markdown doesn't have to signal a continuation of the bearish market afaik. That symmetrical triangle has us at like $7k by the end of May. We could pretty easily bounce off that even if we do continue down.

We've had virtually no price discovery in $7ks. It wouldn't be surprising if we meandered around there before coming back up again
I don't really know, to be quite honest with you

I'm inclined to say no but mainly because I don't personally believe news is really affecting btc lately
https://www.tradingview.com/x/KYhkn3cV/


past 4 months, shorting/longing have been virtually equally profitable

Show me a house cat with a 4 month attention span ;D
Certainties, how do they work?
Cause it is now filled with bagholders long may they rain

Bags will drop when they begin to feel pain

But they they remember without pain there is no gain
yea I have considered doing this just for the free $$$ basically. Realistically btc will go sideways for a while and there will be several opportunities for this play and it's virtually a free 3-4%

the btc market is just way too bullish long term to ever give up on that futures premium. Even if we dump down to like $4k the bounce to $5.5k will have a premium on futures lmao
I can't imagine it's real, if someone really intends on buying 7k btc any time soon I feel like they'd just have gone OTC at $7k 

Did the entire wall get obliterated at $8.6? 
Yeah that's a totally different case if it were to go down, if so, how down will it go. Perhaps $6500 as you said, or there is also possibility of more such walls popping up.

I can't seem to agree today that we will be going down. If you notice the price movement since we bottomed, they look very similar to those after the mysterious BGD appeared on April 7th after continous dumping and going sideways in $6,500 - $6,800 range. The price continued increasing over the course of next two days after that BGD and then it experienced a big dump. Shortly on wards, it started following the same movements, then we saw another mini dump before that 19K mother of all BGDs appeared. 

I expect a similar scenario in the current context given the amount of uncertainty. There is high probability of price going sideways, even higher probability of it increasing slowly overtime. There is also probability of a dump, but I do not see it taking place before we make it to $8,800 - $9,200 range. 

I am sure we all will be experiencing an interesting week for Bitcoin. :)
Yes, owning Bitcoin has been so painful. My portfolio is weeping. Where do I purchase a good old fashioned bond these days?
I had a friend visting a Cisco conference or something in my city last year, the prices were from 3-8000 USD or something really crazy. Of course no one goes for the conference, since it's just 40-60 old men (not the disruptve business guys so to say) there wanting to drink for free and be away from their wives a week. 

This means that any price can be taken, since no one pays for it anyway and it's just different "partners" all over. If someone asked them a month later what the conference was about , probably no one would know :D

I think also that if their department doesn't spend their 1M budget on "conferences and education" it will get cut to next year... so yeah
So we should really start targeting politicians and banks?
My take is that we'll close above 8.8 which will be good enough for today and see quickly a pullback to 8.6 or so, but considering quite a lot of shorts have opened now it could also lead to some fireworks if volume picks up and there's a consensus pump. 

Personally I'd rather be safe at a small loss than sorry.
Ahh I see. Expecting your alarms to go off then. Think shorting close to 8.4 was like longing close to 9.8. 
Don't tell me its a hard fork.


I don't want to see Bitcoin Cash Cash
Or, gdax and gemini sent out those tax forms and everybody moped the fuck out and went to bitmex
not to mention higher taker fees on GDAX. I have avoided it cause of that. I definitely would've made a few trades on there lately if it weren't for that 
That doesn't change the fact that this is hurting his business. Bear markets like this are bound to push a lot of companies out of the space, which in the case of Coinbase would be a good thing. Brian should've stepped down a long time ago. That company is run by amateurs. 

Of course they're surely sitting on a lot of capital still, so I don't think anything is going to happen to them but one can hope! 
Solid plan. It would be odd to break down like this and then rocket back through your entry. I wouldn't want to be short if that happened. 
What other tips did your phone psychic give you?
That's what I would do.
The goal is to lock in the profits in case of uncertainty. I usually do not put stop on my positions so yeah being a little flexible in this range shouldn't really harm.
That was shocking, really. 8.8K has been a high volume node for a long time. We certainly could blast up through it, but I think many longs are looking to take profit there as a historical HVN and as a probable top *if* this is a DCB/technical bounce.
Aside from a number of indicators converging at that level, the wedge/flag pattern is set up to complete at that point.

Or in your case lose major money since you traded your real money for dino-dollars at exactly the wrong moment.  Sorry.  I calls 'em like I sees 'em.
Ok thanks. And you're doing this on Stamp, right?
Well now I feel a little lonely in my short 
*gulp*
I added a bit here and will close above 8.8 I think. 
Starting to feel a little married to my position, but also feeling incredulous at what the market is doing right now. That's probably a bad mix.

Do it.
This is trading on ecstasy. I like it
If the price swings within a 50-100 range for a long time, moving together to a equilimbrium , then a big move in any direction might show the market trends in one way or the other, where it could not before
Yup. If stamp gets above there, I'll bail. 
Because he wants to quit his crappy job and BTC has to go to $9K before it can go to $100K and he can retire and get his lambo.

Absolutely no other logical reason.
Or ascending triangleish...
This. I'm sort of seeing this weekend as just giving the RSI some time to cool off before another drop.
lol
Poober^^TM

Or, you know... Just a webserver and a front-end. You could even accept Bitcoin as payment... on Lightning
It is possible ETH will flip. But I think it's also much, much more of a prime candidate to be replaced by something better. 

It sells itself on utility but I get the feel that the actual utility is pretty darned clunky. 

My feeling is that someone at some point will come up with something vastly simpler, safer, more secure and all round better to do the actual jobs needed.  

The question is whether by that point utility actually counts for anything or whether it's still the dollar sign that rules everyone's thoughts. 

Bitcoin has one job to do. ETH is trying to do loads and it sounds like it doesn't do quite a few all that well.  
You could just have watched tv to come to that conclusion about people's motivations.
This is basically the reasoning I bought EOS for, so much money and devs involved. It will not take over for BTC or ETH, but I think it might turn out to be the "enterprise choice" for some distributed apps that need fast execution
commented below
Word. My view is 7500 is a place price will stop, but if it's going to head lower it'll just be a pit stop, wouldn't "bet on it". Becareful brah, if it goes back below 8k the precipice to 7k is awefully close and tempting, esp if longs are still high.
You're correct. I was being an idiot.
Downvoted for self-deprecation :)
OK
You devil you
What do you mean?
Zoom out.  We've had a ~$2000 rise in the past month.

Long term bull here.  Not desperate.  Bought the dip. 

If you want to see desperation, watch the bears gleefully recite their lines, "Bag holder!" "Capitulation!" "Goblin town!" every time some dumb big bear decides to waste a few hundred million in a petulant dump during an obvious bull market.  It's totally pathetic.
It's not just a $100 rise though. It's recovery to the same highs as yesterday *and* other coins are higher than their yesterday highs. Exuberance is contagious.
Bitcoin was in a bullmarket that time last year
&nbsp;

There’s some accuracy on both sides here — u/theslayerofFUD is correct that BTC was in a bull market prior to Consensus, since the $2,000 mark was breached on May 20.  That said, to underscore a general point made by u/adun-d, the bull market continued through and beyond Consensus 2017 — maybe not each day — but BTC finished May at $2,300 (15% higher than pre-Consensus), finished June at $2,500 (25% raise from pre-Consensus), and we all remember the rest.

&nbsp;

Consensus affects BTC’s price with something more than a calendar correlation: Last year, the civil war over scaling seemed to be resolved, averting the imminent S2X fork (I know there’s a whole history beyond that) — that seemed to open up the gates for a future rise.  The BCH fork did not seem contentious when it occurred over the summer; it seemed like smooth sailing post-Consensus since *a crisis was averted.*

&nbsp;

If this year’s Consensus punctuates additional BTC utility (maybe challenging ETH’s smart-contract space with RSK), and/or highlights a solution (how SegWit and LN solved the Dec/Jan fee/mempool problems), that would provide **causation** for BTC’s price to head back north in June and beyond.

&nbsp;

Perhaps the best way to view Consensus’s annual impact (it started in 2015), or the health of BTC generally, is just to do a year-over-year analysis from the end of May each year:

2015: $220

2016: $700

2017: $2,300

2018: ($8,500...)


We’re moving in the right direction.

&nbsp;

> Last year consensus began the BTC pump to 20k.

Consensus in 2017 was May 22-24

Bitcoin price was in a bullmarket and already in an uptrend well before then. You can't say that price was increasing because of consensus because it wasn't. Anyway, BTC price dumped on the 25th and again on the 26th.

Keep clutching at straws though.
If you're looking at the 4h, the pole is from ~9.4k to 8.2k.
Remember when you said that we won't see sub 10k ever again :-P
> once they’re all out of BTC:

> One way ticket to Goblin Town

no contradiction here? if they are all out of BTC, how are they going to push price further down?
Lol this is ridiculous 😂

Still think you should wait. If we pass $9.1-9.2k u can go long/buy with stops below $8.8. 

Don't let your previous sell/close affect your mindset. Wipe the slate clean, you're starting fresh. The market doesn't care where you entered or exited. it's going to do its own thing regardless 
Thank you for this great reply. Can’t wait to see if this plays out.
What makes you think ETH will dethrone Bitcoin? Haven't they already had like two chain resets in their short history? Minimal hash power and trust compared to Bitcoin? The whole "infinite supply" thing? Don't see it happening. 
quantum computing will make current kind of programming obsolete giving more power to server less and infrastructure as code paradigm (from investment perspective, i think we will see lots more opportunities on other sectors besides blockchain - i like to fantasize about what i would do if such computing was possible and commercialized like raspberry pis when i am bored).  

eth overtaking probably will happen in the middle of next growth cycle, i probably should be keeping more tabs on eth news. i dont think it will happen at a point when it means anything fundamentally though and it will just be one of those retarded bull justifications that will wreck lots of newbies

7.5k mean for summer seems quite possible.

nice analysis
Nice overview of your thoughts! 
Yes you can either go to USD or hedge your btc on bitmex or something. If you go on vacation there's a strong chance your short will get liquidated if it's on 10x leverage though.

Going flat with USD is probably the best option for a vacation.

I wouldn't be comfortable hedging for more than a week or so with anything more than 3.3x leverage.

Most people don't like putting all of their cold storage on exchanges so going to fiat for a vacation is probably the better option.

If you can check your position on vacation every few days then it's not a big deal. 
I usually just look at bitstamp on TradingView, but I’ve been experimenting with other exchanges up at the same time to see which one is most accurate. What just happened was a little mind boggling that xbtusd perp swap futures would’ve given you the best trade. 

Tally 1 that bitmex futures drives this market 
If it's so great then summarize its points.
Well when you don't read the article you can just make up stuff.  Keeps you versatile.
Your aladeen is quite aladeen.  wait, did you just replied to yourself?
If you've been keeping up with the news in the crypto market you wouldn't be asking this question. 

Regulations should be hashed out by the end of the year with Wall Street Markets opening their trading desks by Q4 2018 or Q1 2019.

That being said, it can drop a little more but I'm not thinking it'll crash at all and if it does, well that just means cheap btc. 
[deleted]
Yea that is what I have been seeing too, you're saying this looks similar to may/june 2014 right? Of course this time could be different^TM and this could just be like the silk road bear trap.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/Vm20ETZp/
I agree pretty much for those same reasons. It is looking strikingly similar. 

Just wondering what other peoples reasons were for thinking so. 
Most of the conference is gonna be about alt coins and ICOs, besides so many people seem to be expecting a pump coz of consensus which IMO  is a big warning sign; beware.

Ok, ok. Will add a control for current value. Positions outside 1% must enter a "force" flag on the command or something 
Sry bro. But it was a bit obvious after the weekly close.
So to round up your statement here: "Because."
!short close XBTUSD 8592 
How’s that working out for you?
https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ito6f/comment/dyv8kqa?st=JH4UY2EI&sh=0dee82e7
Hahahaha there we go!
!short XBTUSD close 8600

Should've set a stop, missed the bottom of the wick, closed at a small loss. I might regret this but didn't want to fuck around, might reshort if this goes a little higher but I've spent all day pissed off and just need to relax a bit. 

... I'm already starting to regret it lol
Hope you are right. 
:X just hold thru, i think u will be fine. I got a $8950 september wick last night from a limit sell i forgot about. $300 premium lmao thank u shit liquidity
We talked about a dump/pump on the daily close - you don't think that was it? Now that I'm out of position I find myself re-evaluating. 
It does ;) I'm mainly just teasing. I just think it's funny.  for what it's worth I didn't downvote you

It also will force you to rethink whether or not it's a good trade

And yet it's slower than the real Bitcoin. Smh. 
thats why bch has less transactions then doge Coin? Great currency dude, go drink more of that roger ver coolaid.
It's actually really fast and reliable and good for payments.

If I'm sending crypto payments I'll always send LTC.
Thanks, I appreciate that a lot! I'm glad you do. 
Ah I see, fair point.  I think perhaps those people had been waiting for 6k prices with watering mouths that they did not miss the chance to buy there again.
I said 6 hours not the past month. Looking at the past week we can see a bunch, almost all big red market sells surrounded by low volume.

edit: and almost all at key levels like this last one that tried to break down the pennant right as the candle closed
> Wait til you learn more, you will be even less sure. I miss thinking it goes straight up/down

This is both funnier and more accurate the more I consider my trading history. 
Generally the opposite in my opinion, I just think bears have to be more diligent lately because of PTSD from the 17% 1h candle...

it's scary shorting btc...
Yikes, looked to me like it wicked 8570.  Is that a breakdown to you?
I don't really plan to take profit there, though maybe I should. I feel like I might have the equivalent of "short from 10800" off the 11.7 breakdown here. This could retest the log line down in the low 7s, so I'm trying to be patient. 
lmao
I will just give an example, depending on the country (currency settings) 2,02 and 2.02 can yeld very different results.
In the binance app i had to change comma with a decimal point or else it wouldn't work...
Auto correct can quickly cause havoc, although it doesn't really relate to syntax issues. 
Traders provide liquidity, and liquidity is an important and valuable risk-transferring mechanism. Just because most of the volume is from speculators (hell 70% of forex volume is bots) doesn't mean the underlying asset/derivative is inefficient. So long as no single entity has market power, traders make the market *more* efficient, even if that means efficiently transferring wealth from one group people with the wrong expectations about the future to those with the correct expectations about the future.

control f: corn 

Not that I understand exactly what that all means.
Volume is the most democratic measuring tool ever. It's people voting with their money and the chart as the source of truth for that
Technically this can bearflag all the way up to 8850. Chewtoy is definitely correct that the buying pressure still doesn't seem very significant. Maybe a low volume slow creep up to paint a nice flag and then the next leg down when the indicators are cooled down. 

Then again, who he heck knows. 
I'm seeing fake push walls in the orderbooks too. I don't know I'm sceptical 
That's what I really don't understand about a break up here. Where the hell is it going to go?

The market just spent quite awhile consolidating in the $8,600 to $10,000 range. Now its just going to bounce right back? Makes no sense. 
Hey man, just want to say that you are one of the traders I respect more around here. I'm skeptical as hell too, but it would be crazy if we break up from here and finish the day/week candle above 8.8k. What do you think of the chance of that happening and where we go from there?
Saw that earlier. It's huge triangle. Tbh I have no idea where this is going.
Yeah, markdown already happened to 8.2, distribution happened around 9-9.4k imo seing that 10k was untouchable

Don't think this theory can't be applied to short/mid term and reverse once done
Thanks!

Really is..... Kinda, I mean, you can get burned as with everything. But as long as you have a well funded account, and money on multiple exchanges, you can almost count on the premium settling in a range. This range changes, admittedly, but right now the premium should lie somewhere around $150-$250 (1-3%). 

Just earlier, I shorted the Eth premium at $40, and longed coinbase. Just closed for around $19/Eth. 

*Edit: I forgot to mention the best part, is that it counts as losses on CB account, which inevitably gets reported to the IRS. 
If I had more money on the exchange I would be banging the fuck out of this at 8420 OKEX. Zero premium.

I got it shorted on BFX near my 8500 entry on OKEX. I would go long over equal positions though, here on futures.

The longer it sits here, the more I am like "why didn't I already start sending it"

*Edit: lol started sending it and the opp is evaporating.
yeah it was a massive sell off
[deleted]
My stop is very tight. If we pop I'll be out very quickly. Seems like we're struggling to break 8750. There is just no volume behind this thing. If it breaks, I'll just re-evaluate on the sidelines. 
Watch out mr chewing toy will maybe see this. And yeah not a sure thing here. But I'll have enough time to exit if this decides to flag.

To short 8700.

You scaling into another short?

A mixture of stamp and Mex. 

I've noticed recently that Mex telegraphs upcoming moves a bit based on the premium. A "premium divergence," if you will. 

During the movement from $8,200 to $8,750 over the weekend, the price was rising steadily but the premium was dropping during the rise. It dropped to $0 toward the top of the spike, from around $100 at the beginning of the spike. 
u/haserfauld how you holding up?
think he's just closing so he doesn't have to stomach an even larger loss in the chance it keeps going up, aka risk management. This is not a bad spot to add/open a short
The last time I took a look back I had a 57% success rate on a simple "did I make money or lose money on the trade." It's probably closer to 60% now. 

But that's a pretty useless measurement, as a trade where I lost .01% is given equal weight to one where I gained 25%. 

Assuming you followed every single one of my trades since August of last year, you'd be up about 300% on the market, or ~$27,000 if you started with $5,000 (or 1 BTC), trading on 1x leverage. 

If you traded on higher leverage, you'd obviously be doing better. But more than 10x leverage and you'd likely have been margin called at some point and lost everything, as I'm pretty sure I've taken at least one 9%+ loss on a trade since August. 
Way back.
No.
I wonder how many people would play bitcoin on speed mode. Like...imagine a video game where it's the crypto market but everyone is on 20x leverage with slightly negative taker fees or something to encourage speed trading lmao 
bitmex at 8600 now, seems like a short with 1\-2&#37; stops would be a good idea.
I already quit my crappy job, so BTC better go up, I still need a Lambo, and don't want to find a new crappy job.
Why does the RSI need to cool to drop? I see it "needs to cool" when price goes up for too long/fast.
gold
Dumpr. 

And please sign the NDA I'm PMing all of you. 
Cardano is pretty great imo
I agree, this does seem possible.
very true
The devil in me woke up again. After getting stopped at $8,540, I re-entered another long at $8,402. 
What I mean is I do not think the buyers will give it up in two days. I expect them to come back and buy. Moreover, all sort of market sells are being absorbed by the market pretty nicely whilst keeping the price stable. 
> Zoom out. We've had a ~$2000 rise in the past month.

Zoom out  We've had a $11,500 drop in the past few months.

And bears aren't desperate, because they aren't so dumb as to hold unprofitable short positions forever.  
You call this "exuberance".   This bear market has really lowered the bar for you guys.
Thanks for clarification. In general, I think there will be a pump, then a "sell the news" event and soon after a steady growth which will accelerate throughout the summer. Afterwards we just have to wait and see.
Whatever floats your boat man, swim against the flow. we'll see what happens.

I have no idea if any of the political aspects of the article are true or not, but the top section regarding the spectrum of CPU-GPU-ASIC isn't fud it's just fact. If you want to keep hardware companies from developing ASIC miners you have to substantially change the algorithm regularly, otherwise they can just make a slightly more flexible ASIC built to handle slight algorithm changes.
PoW will cause the heat death of the universe.
I did read it. Sorry you can't wrap your head around the fact some people will see things differently (and better) than you.
Completely agree with this, crypto pretty much had very little exposure back then, but I was talking about the price change/marketcap/charts.
Exactly, I was concerned that it may take another 2 years before we even see the market recover again. What is infinitely more concerning is that there was no recession between 2013\-2017. What if one occurs before two years from now?
Not sure. It's hard for me to imagine it'll be quite that long even if this does play out similarly. Things are moving a bit more quickly now and we have LN up and running and general release clients should be on the horizon for later this year, I think. Plus the halvening is two years out and hype for that usually starts much earlier. 

There's a lot to be bullish about on fundamental grounds but this market is tricky because price discovery range is massive. I personally think Bitcoin will be worth several million per coin in the not too distant future but the market seemingly has no idea how to value it at the moment.
Yeah looks similar to the break of the downtrend line then except we didn't pop as hard (yet). It's this person's opinion that the recent run up to 10 was merely traders taking advantage of the technicals. I don't see much reason for why the line break would correspond with an actual change in the market. Things still feel pretty bearish to me and everything down to 1.2K is relatively weak support. 

I posted this the other day, but if I were a betting man (oh wait, I am), I would guess that we'll crash through $6K at some point soon, bounce at 4.8/4.9K before capitulating or slow-bleeding down to the 2K/3K region, which I think will be the bottom. That's all just speculation though.
Tom Lee thinks there will be a significant rally next week.  I’d rather not miss out on it.

To clarify, I meant 8812 was the local top on June futures. We could still go back up, but I'm setting my stops really tight over my entry at this point. 
There you go, sir.
Hot damn. That's a sweet wick. Seems to be stalling a bit here, though. Got my stops at a higher high on June futures.
Weekly closed down heavily. 4H/1D bearflag is not yet invalid. I think we're going back down still, but I'm now back in the green. I put in an limit order to double my position size and set stops right above the local high. 
Blockstream core devs don't want you to know the truth. They lie and censor and block discussion everywhere they can. Don't let them keep you fooled. This isn't tribal, this is about the future of cryptocurrency. Don't be on the wrong side of history. 
It was created literally and explicitly as a peer to peer CASH system. You only have to read the title of the white paper to know that. Try researching for yourself instead of swallowing core lies. The Eda was necessary for the Bitcoin brand, spirit and purpose to survive. It is not a fundamental change in design function or intent. Merely a clever adaptation for a hostile environment. Bitcoin will survive these attacks from the incompetent and malicious blockstream charlatans.
Bitpay supports BCH. That's a lot of merchants that you can spend your fancy BCH currency coin at
.... how?
Is doge supported by Bitpay?
don't really see the point in noting it
Not yet. I'm looking for <8550 as a true break. It's a bit dodgy of a formation, but it's acting like it's going to go.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/piAHz0iK/
There you go, man.
Yeah but I just want a bot/AI that decides how to spend my money for me. :)
Yea, exactly. I also like to use very simple chart patterns that incorporate volume profiles like double bottoms/double tops. The low volume second push to high $9ks was a very clear signal to short/sell. I should've shorted it harder 
I think it might make sense more from a psychology point of view than a ta point of view. A lot of traders still don't know whether this is a bull or bear market, so there is nervousness around key pivot points and over reaction to failures.

We spent quite some time in the 8600-9500 range so it is acting as a comfortable magnet for the people who think this was an overreaction to the failed break up.

In a way, I wouldn't be surprised for it to go back up to the 9ks and hang around a bit longer for people to build up confidence to have another go.

Don't imagine that this has any validity from a ta perspective but it matches how I was feeling. 10k was too soon, but below 8k is too far
Assuming we are back in a bullish trend long term it makes perfect sense. There's a lot of these shakeouts on the up-trend that builds up each year. https://www.moonmath.win/
9234?

https://www.tradingview.com/x/drVY7bQa
It can always skip 9k and shoot straight over 10k ;-)
Yes, it would be crazy. if I had to put a random ass number on it I'd put it at 30-40% chance of happening. Just a complete random guess based on gut feeling so don't take it too seriously. Remember that's about the chance trump had of winning LOL

If we did manage to break, say, $9.2k+ I'd be longing. breaking $8.8k and I'd be annoyed and waiting patiently for more movement before making a decision. $9050 is roughly where I'd start closing and considering longing. 

I may even add to my short at $8.8k

Also, thanks :)
I mean neither do I but nothing so far has suggested to me this will go farther upwards. All of the buy pressure has been tentative and low volume, the sell pressure has been very quick and intense. It does not scream "bull market" to me.

I really do believe a "bull market" starts after a flatline where we can't go lower. Not a low volume rally where people are just waiting to sell the bounces
it's possible fo sho, I'm no wyckoff expert.

I am not just basing this off of the wyckoff stuff, it's all the other patterns and longer term indicators I'm basing it off of. 
If you're really bullish on the market, I personally think it would be fine to long/buy here and have stops below, say $8.4k or something. 
because in case it breaks up from here you're in a good position! It's always good to get local bottoms/tops, even if you don't know where it's going afterwards. If you bought at $8.2k you are in an amazing position to either:

hold your position while btc begins another bull market 

or

sell at $8.2k on the way down, since hitting $8.2k would likely mean lower lows
"So How did you spend that 1M budget last year?"

"You know this cool thing called blockchain that will solve our logistic and database problems? I went to a lot of conferences about this and we are ahead of the game. The guys at HP doesn't even talk about it yet"

"Nice, just tell me if you need a bigger budget next year. We will outsmart them"

"Sure"
But have you accounted for slippage? I normally set stops $10-$20 lower/higher than I actually want to sell/buy because of insane slippage during dumps or pumps. Also if trading on bitmex stops is essentially the only way because of the damn system that crashes 
Sounds good
Bitcoin Ancient vs. Bitcoin Avant Guard
Hope they told you to use a stop loss.
Yes. Opened 8650 spot (8700 futures). Will scale in up to 8780 and bail on a break up over 8800.
I'm sorry you have to pay a mortgage.  Please know that there are very smart people working 'round the clock to end that world.
That's interesting. I'll have to pay closer attention to the small changes in premium. Josh Olszewicz has a nice chart that I've seen in some of his videos that tracks the various premiums and discounts over time. I think he said the script is available for free (from someone else) but I haven't checked it out yet myself. Wouldn't work with bitcoinwisdom though. Personally, I haven't really gottem myself setup and acquainted with TradingView too much yet but it's on the to-do list. Right after I finish battling BCash trolls.
Holding mine still. Got an add in at 8790 on futures. 


I'm still here too, just slightly underwater since I opened basically here, after taking the loss from the wick to 8650 overnight.

Kinda tempted to hedge with a long on the M18 like /u/haserfauld has done in the past. Regardless I'll bail over 8860 or so if this keeps up.

Throw in the BitMEX engine and we've got a new form of torture for the UN to ban.
You do you, but I'm closing mine soon if this doesn't drop. 
People trading on the RSI. It helps to not have them against you, instead potentially with you, when moving the market.
Well, if you draw your line from the ATH, you'll always show a down trend unless you're right at the ATH, in which case there's no line, just a point.

Bears are absolutely desperate at this point.  They've been dumping on us for four months with very little effect.  We're still on trend if you zoom out a year or more, and pretty soon we will hit a new ATH.  

Been doing this for a while.  Mark my words: It's just a matter of time before Bitcoin doubles in a month, pulls back a bit, then doubles again.  That would put us at $30-35K by the end of this year or possibly early next year.

Short if you must, but it's a loser's bet unless you're going for a quick scalp.
What bear market? It's only a bear market if you're a total newb who bought in December.  If you bought in February or April, you're up.  If you bought a year ago or more, "bear market" is just silly talk.

It's silly talk anyway. One expensive and ineffectual little two-day dump does not a bear market make.
The trend isn't good. Even if, Consensus manages to prop up the price a bit, I'm that much of a gambler to go in right now knowing well that we are still bearish.

Let's see what happens
Lol. :-D

Yeah but this is not some new revelation. There are pros and cons to ASIC mining. The biggest issue, as far as I can tell, is manufacturing centralization. This aspect will hopefully change soon.

Wow it is following the pattern closely.  Pretty uncanny. 

So where are we headed next, straight down?  The Wycoff pattern seems to show we could be headed back to 6k or worse.  Does Wycoff allow for the market to recover after it reaches that territory or is it game over?

but arent you essentially doing the same thing as someone who would open shorts now at 1-2% stops?
That's if your expecting it to drop but they are not. So which one is "trading against the market"?
Definitely shorting until the market convinces otherwise.
> It's only a bear market if you're a total newb who bought in December. If you bought in February or April, you're up. 

My god, the noobs here don't know anything about markets and proper terminology.

I assume those are all supposed to be 8s. If you're at 8500 average (spot) then I'd probably set stops just over 8550 if you can stomach it, then in profit (maybe 8475ish) if we leg down below 8350. Just my opinion. There has to be a technical bounce here soon.

So...? They specifically added BCH because the BTC fees were getting out of hand and people weren't spending their BTC anymore due to these fees. The amount of people using it can change over time. 

BCH's miner fees are always lower anyways. 
What kind of ridiculous bullshit is this?
be patient and don't panic buy. I have sat through these bounces before, it looks similar to me.

Hard rejection from $11.7k, a bounce where bulls are in disbelief and bears are tentative...I've seen this before.

Could definitely play out differently but like I said I sat through $11.7k down to $6.5k and it's tough to be flat/short during the bounces but you have to be patient.
Exactly my sentiments. Well atleast the green was a nice thing to wake up to

I mean, BCH was created in August. 

I'm under the impression that a transaction isn't spam if it pays a fee.

BTC's blocks are very cheap to fill up and cause a backlog. Malicious or not, it's an attack vector. Bigger blocks make this 'spam' more expensive as there is much more room to fill up. 

Fees are nothing right now, but when BTC's price tanked yesterday there was a huge backlog again and fees spiked. It's near impossible to predict if the fees will stay low - hence why Bitpay adopted BCH, which will always have cheap fees. 
Because the blocks are only half full. There is no competition for the space. And I'm sure there won't be ever again because nobody wants to pay$60 to move their money and each time. They will use altcoin and further reduce bcore's dominance.
after buying high and selling low too many times you get tired of it and stop doing it. i am a very impatient person in real life actually, but i've learned my lesson with trading enough that i know i will lose money if i am not disciplined
Better not touch my position before i mess up. Going reckless again without stops till the morning.
Good luck to both of us and hope we meet bellow 8300 in the morning.
