Lot of hysteria here, personally I just see a equally violent upward reaction to the last leg down to 6.4 which was rather absurd and smelled like panic + fomo dumb shorting and got lot of noobs trapped I suppose.

I'm out since my last scalp short 6.9 -> 6.8 and I'm considering buying the dip now, wouldn't short below 8.4 or 8.5.

Good luck all and please, keep calm. This is not a bullrun yet with such a low volume (compare to 6k in februar, it's shit) nor is it going straight 7.4 -> 3k.

Magic Poop Cannon calling 3k imminent should have ringed a bell anyway, this guy is always wrong.


It does seem like we've broken through initial resistance and are holding it decently well so far. 

Macro: https://www.tradingview.com/x/1em4nzBm/  

While we have resistance closer above us (7500), our next crucial test is the 7800-8000 range, where the downtrend line from 11.7K and the 6-month log support-turned-resistance line are currently converging. I do not see us passing that on the first try. 

Micro: https://www.tradingview.com/x/sKLYHh5f/  

I'm licking my wounds from my stopped short, but I am still holding my June futures long, which I added to (very lightly) at 7290 this morning. CA @ 6517.

I may look to scalp a short in the 7500 range, but I wouldn't consider re-entering until 7700+. I may add more to my long if we can break 7500 and hold it, as well.

Good luck all.
So, bitcoin pretty much did the last thing anybody was expecting early this morning and broke through the substantial resistance zone between $7,100 and $7,300.

Resistance at around $7,250 has been tested a few times this morning and (at least for now) is holding as support. This movement is potentially forming a [bull flag that would break to the upside at around $7,500](https://imgur.com/a/Qmbuq) with a target of around $7,800. It's a pretty small flag.

Zooming out a bit, the market is still wedged pretty firmly in a bearish descending channel:

https://imgur.com/a/i1XCz

The resistance line is at around $7,800, and I'd expect it to hold for now even if this flag does compete to the upside. 

However, if the market *does* break out, then we should see an attempt at the [log resistance line](https://imgur.com/a/UUKKG) that's currently at around $9,500 or so.

All in all, it's a great place to have a long open from below $7,000 and a pretty precarious place to be opening a fresh long. 

The payoff could be substantial if the market remains bullish and continues to press upward...but disastrous if the market remembers that it's been in freefall since $20,000 and the trend is still very much down. 

As for me, I'm cautiously optimistic and still holding my long from around $7,030. 

I'd say the odds that I'm stopped out of my position by a test of $6,800 are pretty substantial. However, the risk/reward is very high if the market can maintain this bullish momentum. 

This could very well be the beginning of the end of the bear market. Which is a pretty exciting situation, even if the odds of that are a bit long. 
This is extremely interesting. 
Holding from late 2013 to early 2017 was despair. Even though I'm still on the sidelines and probably going to start buying in soon, what this bear market has taught me is patience and that in itself has been a valuable lesson. 
Over the past 6 months i have come here reading peoples comments daily.  And i have honestly found it to be somewhat detrimental.  For anyone out there thats a noob reading this. Learn to trade. Practice!!! Educate yourself!   Dont come here expecting real sentiment or an idea where btc is going.   Wayy to much bullshit in this discussion.   Its not all trash but there is a lot.  
Sentiment indicator: my Tron holding coworker wants to learn about shorting
I was a few hours in the middle of conducting my monthly buy when all of a sudden... I guess we just popped the weekly pivot. Daily Stoch RSI was oversold, my custom aggregate indicator was oversold. In a few days we'll be over bought again. My guess is a short bull run back to the low 8k at least, upper 8k at best, probably right into the middle at 8.4k which is the April pivot. That's where you bears should short, lower risk there, not here. This was a decent pop today.
Definitely traded this one wrong. This is what I wrote after we pumped from 6500:

"
With the velocity of some of these pumps it so far lines up with what my gut was telling me. Debating opening a small short at 7200, and I will if it struggles there, but I'm thinking this has enough to go up to 7.5-7.7 with a chance of 8.2, and I'd rather not be underwater that low. I do think it will get rejected by the old long term log support at 7.8ish, and if it gets past that, I doubt it clears 8.2 log resistance.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/xXoDWTju/"

I ended up not following that plan because I overreacted to the resistance at 7k, listened a little too much to fellow bears, and made a short entry there. I scaled a little out of my position in that range but I'm still far more underwater than I like with what looks like could be a decent amount more room to go. I still think my initial take may end up being right and I still don't see us clearing log resistance from 8.2-8.4, but I don't think I can afford to ride out my whole short til then on the off chance we clear that.

Need to consider a little bit more but I think I'm gonna have to swallow a painful bite of this short here and see if I can make it back up with some higher entries, or watch it plunge right back down and end up break even once it goes past 6.7 or so.

Greed kills!
All the posters that were bears like yesterday and are now suddenly all bulls has to be a sign.
Oh geez, it's just going to march sidewise right out of this wedge for hours on low volume before committing to a direction isn't it.  This place is gonna become bored and schizophrenic again.
In other news, the Craig Faith guy got BTFO by both Vitalik and the LN author  :D

7 straight green 15m candles. 7 of 9 30m candles green. 15% rise from the local bottom in just over 48 hours. RSI overbought on most time frames. This is prime scalp shorting material, except this doesn't *feel* overbought. This has been low and slow, and it feels to me more capable of a giant green candle just over 7500 than it did in the 7400s. No trade for me.
What kind of bullshit is this lol my stop limit triggered nicely just at 7520.... for fucks sake what the fuck nice I just bought the fucking daily high I'm so triggered 
Have had a working theory for a few months that we're in an expanding fractal, where similar price cycles repeat just on a much grander scale (even on a log chart).

Today's chart: https://i.imgur.com/MTqzaLO.png

Chart I posted awhile back: https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/0GcxHj0i-Expanding-Fractal-Idea-50k-by-summer-200k-by-EOY/ (the timing is off, but the concept of the expanding fractal can still play out).


State of the market summary: Of course the market’s word is final, but it’s hard to trust it when, for the last few weeks, it’s been acting like your border-line homeless uncle who only shows up on holidays to ask for money over dime-store whiskey breath
These algos are brutal lol. Definitely new players from this year. Better turn your timeframes up if you’re an impulsive trader like me
First rule of BTC doesn’t matter which position you’re in, if you marry your position, at some point you get rekted lol.


Special thanks to all the rekt bears, longs will be rekted in a couple of days also lol.


Really temped to close my 2x long from 7030, but lets let this baby ride to at least 7.8k.
Buying back in. Seems like we're in the process of bouncing off the bottom of the wedge to at least retest 7.5k. Tight stops (alarms) in case wedge still decides to break down here, but I don't really expect it to.
A quick note on Bearish and Bullish RSI divergences, because they've been actually quite helpful in telegraphing impending price movements. 

First for bullish divs, there's actually a very exciting hidden bullish divergence forming on the 1w. RSI has made a new low compared to the $6,000 previous bottom, however (at least so far) the market has failed to make a lower low in price. 

Unfortunately, this hidden divergence is only present on the 1w. As lower timeframes failed to make lower RSI lows. 

Moving along to bearish divs, these are all going to be hypothetical for now. 

*if* this keeps rising up to and beyond $7,800, then we will almost certainly see hidden bearish divergence on the 4h through 1d similar to what we saw when the market rose to $9,200 but failed to get higher than the previous high of $9,900. 

RSI will make higher highs on these timeframes, but price will make lower highs. 

So, just something to keep an eye on if this does continue rising. It's more or less doomed to fail if the market starts floundering in the $8,000s and momentum drops off.

The bearish divergences will obviously be moot if the market fails to maintain upward momentum up and over $7,800. The market will continue to drop, but it won't be a result of hidden bearish divergences (because there won't be any).

Still almost ath shorts open, upside here is pretty good
[removed]
Nice little reset of the RSI on the shorter time frames there. If it can hold above 7250 for the next few hours, it will be ready for another move up (bulls willing). 
Well, at least now things get interesting.

If we can hold above 7250 for a day, that would be good for Bitcoin
Closed my $2.2m long from $7k at an average of $7380 as per my plan mentioned a few days ago here :

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/88g9fm/z/dwkgud5
To me this still seems like a healthy retracement from our rise from 6.5k. I still expect it to go to 7.7k-8.0k from here. Stop loss at 7K for break even for my long from there. 
Couldn't break 6500 for the second time. Interesting. I figured we'd crash through it. 
But of course we rallied to 7300. 

Max pain:

I believe we a due for a leg up. Just a feeling, but I've been wrong before, too. 
went out at 7468, need some zzz good luck rest of you
Rising wedge on the 1h?
"Credit Karma, which operates a tax-filing service, said Tuesday that out the 250,000-plus 2017 federal tax returns it has processed to date, less than 0.04% of them include any mention of a cryptocurrency transaction."

That's less than 1 out of every 2,500 people.

Incredibly early days.




Ironically, nobody on altcoin subs complain about ‘being tied to bitcoin’ on the way up.
please more bearish predictions or I am going to exit my longs from last 2 days ;-)

I'd say we have made a convincing breakthrough of the first of three important resistance lines when we reached 7400 USD: 

https://i.imgur.com/dMAvRAv.png

The second line is now at 7891, but it will probably be at ~~8000~~ 7k8 if we break through. The last line, which if broken will let ut out of the bear trend since the ATH in december, is now at 9641. Let's say ~~10000~~ 9k3 USD when we get there.

TL;DR: If we can get above ~~10k~~ 9k3, we are out of the bear woods.

EDIT: Corrected some rough calculations.
Jeremy Gardner saying on Twitter he’s seen requests for “Multi Billion” $ OTC trades: https://twitter.com/disruptepreneur/status/980940740564942848?s=21

He doesn’t have a source, says he’s witnessed it.

Obviously could be untrue/misunderstanding. But $1b is 135k BTC so would be pretty crazy if true.


Here’s the [**current distribution of limit orders**](https://i.imgur.com/QcEsl3Z_d.jpg?maxwidth=2000&shape=thumb&fidelity=high) across the entire book[^1](/u/The_OPs_Mommy) 


Taking a look, it seems like there’s a bunch of people who would like to try and catch the falling knife at 6.7k and at 6k. Past that point, the orders drop-off exponentially. 

On the offer side, there is heavy resistance right above us. Seems like the market’s expecting to see $7800.  

After that, no clue.. flip a coin. Either we’ll be going back down or people will be getting sh’rekt (probably both) 

&nbsp; 

*****  
[^1](/u/The_OPs_Mommy) *Technically not accurate. There’s actually thousands of bitcoins for sale between $56k and $100k that I had to move off-screen, otherwise the chart just looks really ridiculous*  
capitulation and Death Cross will never mean the same to 90% of the people on this sub ever again lol 
I'm still bearish in the medium term, but what's speaking for the bulls is that this run is looking a lot more "organic" than the random pumps followed by "Bart formations" we had the last few weeks. Volume is not increasing though so I remain skeptical.
[Coinbase snags another former New York Stock Exchange exec to push crypto to Wall Street](http://www.businessinsider.de/coinbase-snags-a-former-new-york-stock-exchange-exec-to-push-crypto-to-wall-street-2018-4?r=US&IR=T)
My short got stopped out at 7320. Still holding my June futures long from 6425, but the short was heavier, and I'm still net down a few percent between the two. 

Seems to be an ascending wedge off the most recent 6400 bottom. I'm mobile for now, but I'll chart it when I'm at a computer. I did not expect this push through 7300, and I need to reevaluate my market sentiment.

edit: not really much of an ascending wedge after all. It's extremely shallow, and could just be a channel: https://www.tradingview.com/x/y4V2ljjy/
Have a bit of my new strategy, doing high leverage longs for smaller moves/breakouts/downs, then lower leverage longs for more "certain" price points like 6800 and so.

Works quite well so far, since the theory is to try to be in a position and ride waves and use crypto as collateral for that. It's basically like adding or removing from your position, but just having two instead. Then I am also exposed to more upside with a 4x long since the risk is lower, but I can also ride it longer and lower fees

Thoughts on this ?
Rising wedge on the 1hr?
How’s the volume on this pump compared to the last one from $7.4k to $9.2k?
Lighten margin positions here. The turbulence is not over.
Saw a comment (now deleted) saying why so many bears here?

For me at least, it's the path of least resistance. What's easier: fake pump and resume downward trend? Or try and ignite a new bull run with no major fundamentals backing it up and the wider economy getting ready to tank?

Only caveat I can think of: big players are privy to some news we don't yet know (this current thing about OTC buyers going crazy with billion dollar block orders for BTC has me a tiny bit spooked, if true - though it feels like the latest incarnation of the "wall street money coming soon" meme. Also kind of convenient it starts circulating just as the kraken whale props up $6.4K)
Opened a short equal in size to my June futures long at 7490. stops at 7580. This is primarily a low risk/high reward play due to tight stops and my existing position. Basically a hedge. 

This ascending wedge was the nail in the coffin: https://www.tradingview.com/x/uobdFg7p/
I can't remember the last time I saw a parabolic rise of any amount on any timeframe, so I guess that's news.

edit: since the pop
Smells like a recovery to me... This is the first time I've felt spooked by upward movement since I opened a short a few days ago 
https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/YRZvdurN-The-target-of-current-bubble-lays-between-40k-and-110k/ still holds quite well :O  that candle bounce...
Google added a conversation rate window if you search for "Bitcoin". Bitcoin is also added to the list of all other fiat currencies.
hmm, just shot up $300 in like 5 minutes...
Well this certainly was a good climb to wake up to.
I'm not part of any BTC facebook groups, but I'm interested in learning more about what the general sentiment is.

What are people seeing? It is all just bulls saying HODL? Do people talk about shorting, etc?
This moment right here is my nemesis. Is this a pullback to reload or actual dip incoming. On the daily we are still not overbought but shorter time fraemes we are.

Already in a long position since 6900 with target of 7800.. 7500 is a confluence zone for multiple EW counts, but don't know if it is the true resistance. This moment is my nemesis. I can't decide exit or add or do nothing.
Personally I think this looks like a great reentry point into BTC for bigger investors.

If you look at the longer term curve and previous price action we are probably getting close to a bottom now. 

My prediction is that institutions won't want to miss out and will get back in early. Once that starts to happen smaller, everyday investors will follow. 

Shorting has become too easy and although it feels risky to buy, these are good indicators of a change. 

but hey, take with a pinch of salt. This is just a prediction, I'm not claiming to know the future
We haven't even tested broken support turned resistance at 7900 and three quarters of the sub is calling A & E double bottoms and long term bear trend reversals.

Come on people...
Shorts looking greedy.  This downtrend isn't necessarily over, but maximum pain has to happen in both directions (just like 2015)
at this point there is only one certainty across the market:

If it goes up, you won’t be surprised

If it goes down, you won’t be surprised

Pretty much a clear cut match point for those of you who saw the movie
[removed]
S&P -2.2%
BTC +4.7%

Move over gold.
I'm sort of a bull but some bulls here get excited too quickly 
Calm down guys , we still have a long way to go
I wish I could relay how much I messed up.  No leverage, I don't margin trade.  I only trade with the same portion of my overall holdings.  Same as Ive always done.  Anyhow listen to this pathetic performance.  

* Sold at 6792.  Re-Bought at 6697, decent little pick up. 
* Sold at 6816.  Re-bought between 6674 and 6710sh.  Nice little pick up.
* Dip, dip, dip, seemed okay around 6500, gave my self a time limit and was out at 5619.  Sitting in FIAT since.  Contemplating crying but easter candy is nice. 


Good luck today everyone  
Everything under 7400 seems to be getting bought up fairly quickly. 

Or i could be completely biased as I am long from 7400.

Edit: the 1H b. bands are tightening up, and are pretty good for short term volatility imo. We could be fairly close to a ~$200 pop in either direction fairly soon, considering we're still in that rising wedge. 
Things will have to cool off here for a bit, but I think it's quite likely that we will test 7.7k in a day or so:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/i7UCAzyn/
Scalping a quick short here, entered at 7330. Will close when shorter term RSI's cool off. Tight stops, thoughts on r/r here?
This is currently the fingers crossed moment. 

If this bull pennant/flag gets shot down then normal service will be resuming in the coming days. 

Looks like we are currently trying to break up from it. Important little moment here, let's see how much fuel we have left.
always good to see 24H highs after Eastern.

Sorry 3 day High

I guess in medium term we gonna retrace from $7400-7500, which is the upper resistance of local downtrend channel going all the way from the beginning of March. So we could end up with $7100 in 12-18 hours. 
If we manage to breach $7500, then next major resistance is $7800, which is SMA100 for 4h timeframe.
Have a good trade.
I'll be the first to admit I only have a very basic grasp of TA so I don't day trade too much, made a few good ones and a couple of really bad ones (although 1 was when I was using Kraken last year and I was unable to get my order through)

Now to my question, why would a trip to 5.9K (or 4.9K or less) satisfy people. If the narrative is to be believed that the market is over-valued then even if we go sub 5K and get a bounce there will only be a few people (relatively speaking) who will get in quick enough before we are back to a possible 6 or 7K, what then? Everyone who misses out is suddenly going to go fuck it i'm buying? and what about people who are waiting for 5.5K or 4.9k or 3K? The same problem applies surely.
Please ELI5 as i don't really grasp it
Pull up a chair and get comfortable. Probably going to be here a while
This is more of a fundamental question, but a lot of TA experts are calling for capitulation so we can reach bottom and start moving up again. My question is why is capitulation necessary? Can someone explain the market psychology behind the need for capitulation?
I watch the 15 minutes a lot and I do not like what I'm seeing and I don't know why. (I'm in fiat right now so no position to be concerned with).

edit - that's why.
This could break either direction right now.  Bulls and bears at a stalemate.  SO much more buy support popping up today but 7410 seems to be a significant point of resistance.   
Someone on kraken is selling hard, they've made it touch 7250 multiple times now only to get arb'd back up
Remember guys, the house always wins. Never bet repeatedly against the house. When the number of shorts reached ATHs, that was a dangerous signal.

So where are the cartel manipulatuon spam today? 🤔
No bottom without weeks of desperation followed by weeks of boredom. After a bull like that the bear doesn’t just turn on a dime.
It looks like a double bottom with the drop to $6000 in Feb is playing out. If the market can grab on to a bullish sentiment... I think a reasonable target could be another test of the $11K resistance. I'm not too sure about this, but if I were asked to put a timeframe on that, like I like to d with my predictions (here's an example:https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/876bdn/daily_discussion_monday_march_26_2018/dwbpfkm/), I'd say that in a month and a half is when that resistance is tested again. 
Hidden bear divergence on the daily and all lower time frames unless the market pushes past 8k. We'll see how it plays out though, considering the bullish momentum we've had for the past few days.

Edit: Regular bear divergence on this last leg up as well.
Looking at https://datamish.com/dashboard/db/btcusd?refresh=10s&orgId=1&from=now-7d&to=now at least 5.5k shorts that were opened below 7.2k are currently still open and in the red. Interesting to see what's gonna happen if we continue to push upwards.
u/DushmanKush can imagine you're inundated with messages from envious people wondering how you had the foresight to short at 7k.

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/88o7xx/daily_discussion_sunday_april_01_2018/dwn5q1r/
Re-entered my hedge short at around $7,400. 

As always, just being cautious. 

Will close above $7,500. 
In all honesty this pump looks solid for the bulls and waiting until 8.5 breaches and holds will cost me 75% of my trading stack BUT damn does that blow get softened from watching my delta portfolio shoot up. + I'm still weary from taking a huge loss a month ago when we dumped to 8.3 then shot back to 9.9 (I could have held the short open and not only avoided a loss but made a ton, my liq was 10.2 from shorting 8.6). 

Thats why I don't trust any bounce until I'm compelled to do so and I am far from compelled (I actually still feel fomo to add to my short but risk management says that's enough adding). I slept like a baby in an underwater short last night and I think we will still see 5k and then 3k before all is said and done. 

If anyone else is holding an underwater short my only advice is to never panic close when the macro trend is in your favor unless you're over leveraged to hell. 
Doombois you should probably close your shorts, we are at a 5 month high on short volume, yet the market was sideways yesterday and up today https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSDSHORTS/ 
Kraken whale, never forget
[deleted]
I have the weird feeling the market will wrong-foot every TA expert by breaking the rising wedge upward to 7.8, then rekt fomoers. Which means it will probably do the opposite. Or the opposite of the opposite.

Anyway closed my scalp short from 7.4 at 7.3 for a small gain and watching it unfold...
It pains me to say I'm selling this bounce all the way to 8.2k. 

I just don't think the market is ready to reverse until a new low is made. It's a gut feeling having watched this market closely for a few years.
So look at this, if it's  not a classical resistance turned support? And a ma cross to the upside on 6h is forming first time since 2 weeks https://www.tradingview.com/x/lrHiPKyN

Longing swaps from 7418 with stops at 7240 here

Pretty weak little dump going on. Might be a good time for a long. What do y'all think?
Seems very bullish today. What's the probability of a fake out ? And can the bear run really finish this fast ?
Still holding an underwater long from waaaaay back (7450).

Came within inches of just taking a loss and even closer to getting liquidated. Low leverage is my savior lol.

Got lucky AF, targeting just before the 7700-7800 resistance.

If we break and hold it, might consider re-entering but for now just holding on.
[This is what I am seeing in my 30m timeframe](https://www.tradingview.com/x/WRvJZ2ya). I am quite surprised this channel has held strong for so long, and I am not expecting it to continue that way, although I'd really wish it would.

I think we may revisit 7.1-7k and will probably open a short at 7.6 if it gets there, with a really tight SL. I was going to open it at 7.5 but the channel has swallowed that number by now and I don't want to trade inside it.

Why trade when the channel is breaking? because I don't think it can keep up.
How much the crash's panic selling was driven out of fear of not being able to meet/optimize for income/capital gains tax obligations?

Major realized gains in 2017. Capitulation in early 2018.

The fear of not being able to pay one's taxes in full is a living nightmare & market influence.

Investor/user context > charts.
The FOMO is strong with this one.

Still keeping my long from 6450. I guess the target 7800 might be reached.
Must. Resist. FOMO! It hurts letting these limit sells hit. This all just seems like DCB after a grossly oversold period to recharge for more down. The selling was fucking relentless last week.

Beware it's a trap.
This is a very slow and labored "breakout" of this consolidation zone.

I'm a bit concerned.
oh lord, we’re at the same point we were last Thursday. Let’s all claim a victory!!! /s

guys, either we get back above 8k or we go below 6.5k. Those are the only lines I’m looking at. Everything in between is just noise
Funny to see people celebrating talking about bear tears. Like bro, I never said the price was going to go straight down. Just that it was an obvious bubble cycle playing out, and that the general trend was down. And I have been right. Bounces are a part of this cycle.

Eventually I'll go bullish, and expect a true trend reversal. My indicator is when the dumb money has given up all hope of a new bull run. That's when the bottom is in.
I posted [this](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/rq9P8phs-If-bubble-history-is-any-guide-fractals-gonna-fractal-to-16K/) chart a while ago that I found when we bounced off 6k the first time and it played out almost perfectly, and this bounce validates it further. I bought my first bitcoin in 2014 and am having feelings of deja vu as this bubble unfolds. The 2014 crash was ~83% which if this bubble followed the same pattern would put a bottom at ~3k, which many bears in this thread were tossing out just a couple days ago and I think is still a possibility. 

I wonder how many people there are like me who were early adopters of btc but missed out on the run to 20k and have been sitting out on the sidelines since before the pop. Without ranting too much I’ll just say I started buying btc in 2014 and instead of hodling through massive losses I spent my btc. Unlike most here I became interested in btc because of my ancap political views but that’s beside my point of this post. Retail investors and adoption as a currency may not necessarily cause the price to moon, institutional investors will do that I agree. But I’m sure there are also institutional investors who are like me who have been sitting on the sidelines watching btc rise exponentially. 

That being said I think a lot of the people on the sidelines have been around long enough to know that $3k is possible but would buy a shitload at that price level. Maybe we’ll never see coins that cheap because of this, or maybe the 2014 fractal will become a self fulfilling prophecy. In 2014 there were several strong bounces on the way down and I think this bounce will turn out to be one of these many bull traps and we will break down to test new lows again. However this is bitcoin and it’s possible we are on the brink of another bubble. I am comfortable dca’ing back into btc at this range for long term holding, but I do expect sub 6k where I will increase my buys. I won’t be convinced that we are beginning a new bull run until we see some extended sideways movement and pumps that have more volume than the top and the 6k bottom.

Doombois what's your take?
Did anybody see the 300+ buywall at 7280-7290 get pulled? Spoof or coldfeet?
Bought in with my stop buy in low 7200s, bought in manually as a speculative add with half at 7060. Just for the record. Anyway...

Eth led this initial dump, breaking down from 420 then 400. Wouldn't be surprised if it getting rejected from 400 with BTC at ~7500 halts this pump. Edit: just relalized it's currently testing 400 with BTC at 9350ish. Maybe sooner than later this theory will be tested.

Maybe. Predicting a lower liquidity alt to lead because it led on the drop is pretty sketchy. Just a thought I had.

Otherwise waiting to see it test 7.7-7.8k range.

Setting stops at minor profit and letting this go.
Back to fiat for me as a hedge - 7500 seems like strong resistance and I'd rather lock in some decent profit. Was in alts and eth (sold at 420) so overall some good stuff.

Not sure BTC is about to fall out the wedge but wouldn't be surprised to see a retrace to 7.3k, where I have the bottom of the ascending wedge. Want to be in a good position if that's what happens.

Additionally, bear div on the hourly chart (if 7500 was a local high) coupled with the possibility of the beginning of a bearish failure swing (RSI).
Urgh, took profits from all my longs now.  I still have big respect for the bear trend and it has been devastating to not sell tops or short them so far. I would wait to see if first 7400 then 7200 holds, to look for a re entry.

On the short side, just before 7500 down to 7250 could be another move I would be comfortable with.

In other news it's interesting that ETH is up more in % today, but not so surprising with regard to that the 1D was extremely oversold and the higher 300s held very well.

Another thing I been doing the last month with quite good success is to do trades in the same pair but one on USD and one on the ratio. For example longing BTCUSD and shorting BTCETH if one of the trends seems stronger/weaker. Still in very primitive mode how to execute this in a good way, currently just looking at 3h chart to see flattened out trends
Wait a minute. We've gone up 4% and there are people saying we've recovered.. Return to the bull.

Calm down, seriously. It's great to see a bounce up but it's nothing right now until it breaks the key resistance and stays there.

Are people forgetting the last few months?! Let's see what happens over this week before getting our hopes up 
hmm i actually think we might test 7.8 here.

but before that a round of stop hunting and taking out high levg longs should happen.

if it doesnt and if we just shoot up from here, then something would be off. 
Insane markep buy on ETH. How many of you follow Bitcoin side by side with ETH? 
Closed my long at around $7,380. Wedge looks doomed. 
Sentiment here remains fearful on the way up?  Bullish.  
Bear market over..

https://imgur.com/a/rp8X9

If the top trend line is breached, which is only around 7.5K.  Didn't come all this way to fail.  it will try a few times until it breaks free and then the A&E,  huge IH&S or C&H can start forming.  Plus that would mean we were in a falling wedge also.
Current downwards channels.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/EmQ0wlGM/

I'm thinking about closing my hedge short here, but will probably end up waiting a day or two to see what RSI does and if we manage to hold these levels. I also don't expect an instant bull, but more accumulation around these levels or slightly higher, if we hold.
Anybody know why the Bitmex testnet doesn't resemble the real price at all?

https://www.tradingview.com/x/dPO9QY7L

Kinda defeats the whole purpose.
Was about to make my first ever shirt on Kraken ( Small money ) , But i managed to miss type mess up my 2FA and can’t get into account. Oh well 

Edit: I’m shorting shirtless, and shirtless shorting. Sometimes you have to let yourself free. 
That dump didn't stretch out the 1hr BB, it's still squeezed but on the bottom now.
So, I guess we ideally didn't breach that local downward channel started in the beginning of March. This could be good news for bears, and with overall bearish sentiment we still may retest previous bottoms of $6500 and go even for $4000. In daily timeframe I see the downward resistance channel for rsi, too, which didn't breach three times in a row. So, my cautious guess for next week or two would be
$5000-5500 or we just slowly go down to make triple bottom, and then try to breach that local downward channel.
I wonder how relevant/legit this info about big investors is https://twitter.com/Disruptepreneur/status/980940740564942848
Strong signs of accumulation between $7,275 and below.

Currently in mark-up, with an unknown target.  Good guesses are $7,800 - $9,200 - $12k (in order from most to least likely).

Signs of distribution will be signs to take profit.  We're STILL in a bear market, and that hasn't changed.
This is a post about Bitcoin. Bear with me.

So Ethereum is currently discussing a "meta-joke" hard cap proposal, that was both a joke and a legit proposal from Vitalik on April 1st.  

IMO this is a hilarious concept all around. They are basically trying to vote in a hard cap. That hard cap will be a "cap" as long as the vote is in favor of that cap. When there is another proposal for a higher cap, or lower cap, or no cap, or whatever, if the majority votes for that approval, "poof!" goes the cap.

The cat is out of the bag. The discussion of a hard cap is a complete waste of time. That hard cap will be worth diddly. 

There is value to both Eth's and Bitcoin's approach to hard forks and implementing change. The value of Eth's approach is that changes/updates can be made fairly easily, which can provide some nifty updates without needing overwhelming consensus. The value of Bitcoin's approach is that when you invest in Bitcoin, you can be pretty sure that the Bitcoin you invested in today will remain the same for the foreseeable future, at least in regards to things like caps on supply. Bitcoin's ledger is actually immutable. That's something the Bitcoin community cares a lot more about than the ETH community. The DAO hardfork made that very clear.

I have some ETH but I'll definitely continue investing in the one that isn't going to have every single rule of the system determined by the tyranny of the majority for the foreseeable future. 
Any way of shorting XVG because that's Bitconnect 2 in the making (I think).
Genuinely curious about what people are hearing from our newer retail friends. Are the Chads opening up new shorts here? What's the word on the street?

Edit: hmmm the flurry of downvotes leads me to believe many are still short, interesting, and thank you.
Say I want to open a long on Kraken right now. ( New to This ). I want to open a long at 7,400 for 1 BTC with 2x leverage. Meaning that I’m borrowing 1 BTC from Kraken, with a 2x leverage meaning when I cash out i collect the profits on the extra 1 BTC?

So Say i open one at 7.4 and I close it at 7.8 with 2x leverage on 1 BTC, My profits would be $800 correct? 

Please correct me if I’m wrong 
Well that was a market sell
Is it wrong that I want this to go down so I don't have to feel so salty about closing my underwater long at $6500? Had I left it open, I would almost be back even. Instead I lost 60% of my stack. I feel so defeated and discouraged. 
Sorry guys, I forgot to turn off my buying bot before going to bed
Broke out of B-bands by a huge amount, I am honestly expecting a retrace any second.
Lets take a look at the Bitcoin market versus Bitcoin going into the month of April 2018!

[You can find the crypto charts here](https://cryptosignals.trade/forums/topic/bitcoin-btc-technical-analysis-april-2018/#post-17198)

As we can clearly see, Bitcoin managed to break out of the down trend channel again.

Another bullish signal for me (providing we stay above 7000) is the fact that the price action pushed us back above the longer term bullish trend line.

The bearish news is that we are still trading in the second down trend channel, the bulls will have to push prices past the near term resistance of around $7600.

Consolidation above 7600 will be a healthy recovery.

If the buying volume does not show up we will test the shorter term support zones, which in my opinion is around $7000 – $7135.

Higher risk traders will be looking to go long or short here depending on which way the price action will swing.

Should the bulls fail to defend the 7k zone, get ready for another dip and some more discounts.

Feel free to discuss these trade ideas with us in Discord. Safe trades.
Ok I said I wouldn't short below 8.4 or so but the RSI looks quite bad on smaller time frames, trying a scalp here from 7.4 to 7.2 with an eye on the wedge support (if broken I'll add), small position.
thinking of finally closing my short from 10k, on the other hand i think i'll just FOMO back in and get rekt, the decisions...
Closed the part of my short that I opened at 7.4. I think I would rather open it at 7.7. Yeah I'm playing it scared/safe but I don't want to get too greedy here. Low volume rises are scary shit.

Crazy how it takes 1-2 whales and pushes to turn a bear market to a bull one. Of course this would be dumped after a few weeks but can't risk potentially reducing my core position. 
72 hrs before everyone here turns bearish and knew all along 6.3 wasn't the bottom. 
Can someone correct me if I'm wrong? Is this a new thing that alts also climbs with bitcoin and even faster than bitcoin when bitcoin is up? I seem to remember that alts were getting crushed when BTC was going up.
If you believe in Bitcoin, this is where you prove it.
When trend reversal

Edit - it was a gag you miserable lot
today 10.000 btc moved from whale accounts: https://blockchain.info/address/16rCmCmbuWDhPjWTrpQGaU3EPdZF7MTdUk?filter=1


70% fiat here w/ a small short..

Chances of seeing the 6000s again?
Funny that still 6K and 3K is mentioned here.

I call 8K ---> 11K. 

Time to recover from its current bear cycle. 

Also time for Goldman Sachs or other financial institutions entering Crypto.

Bitfinex shorts made a new ATH: [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BITFINEX:BTCUSDSHORTS](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BITFINEX:BTCUSDSHORTS)

Crazy to see this at these prices. Where a retest of 7.8k is possible. 
Anybody see an Adam and Eve Double Bottom on the daily?
We have broken 7.4k... starting to think this rally can take us a bit higher before we sell off again. I do not believe for a second, however, that the bear market is over.
Breaking under 7200 would in all probability end this current upward bump we've had. 

Seeing how tough 7200 was to break, psychologically as well.. it would sap the confidence of a lot of people to see us break under it. 

For me right now 7200 is going to determine the next weeks action. Avoid hitting it and rise from where we are right now and attack 7400 in a few hours, that would be great. 

Slither down now, sit in and around 7200 and fall through it? Fuck city.

It's a coin toss for me. Will be shorting should we break under 7150 will go long should we break 7500 but only up to 7800 region.
I took a break (for the most part) this weekend from the charts and overall enjoyed the vacation. Set some aggressively low laddered buys just in case, but didn't catch any knives, which is too bad but not surprising. 

The bigger issue is that I also didn't come up with a trading plan for what I'd do when we bounced. Psyched myself out yesterday of a long entry on the rebound from $6,9 and am just sitting on my hands right now.

The "safe play" seems like it'd be to wait out a bounce off of $7,8, but sentiment in here is very, very bullish and I'm not one to ignore it all the way up. Did that before, and I was very frustrated.

Advice? /u/_chewtoy_ /u/haserfauld /u/challis88ocarina

 
Would it be wrong of me to consider a decent drop incoming before we punch through 7500?
The price is going up.  Anyone have any idea where this new money is coming from?
IF we manage to break the local resistance around 7.4k im looking at 7.75 as the next key resistance. The short term ascending wedge will be looking to complete as it intersects with the longer term descending wedge. If we were to break this area I would be feeling bullish short/mid term. https://www.tradingview.com/x/eyR2Vhix/
Quick question that does not warrant a separate post:
 This new format, what happened to the spot you can click that collapses a post and its children? Is it still there and I'm not seeing it? Going back to oldreddit...
Targeting ~7150-7250; seeing this as a wave 4 correction, which should hit .5 - .618 retracement. 

Wave 5 target is difficult; wave 5 does weird things. I'll be laddering sells between 7500 & 8000, then retargeting buys at 7000. 
Best, or worst, April fools joke ever?
ooops, bears mighty again, some tough resistance at 7.4 :((
[deleted]
Better testing the downside here than a freefall from 7.8k. Still optimistic that we do not go back in the 6ks.
Any bulls care to explain what makes this reversal less likely to be a fakeout than every other we've had so far?  

Volume low, lower high so far (until it isn't of course but so far is there anyone seriously expecting us to get past 9.1 without a major retracement?), Fundamentally there doesn't appear to be much if any new retail money coming back in or anyone fomo'ing except the enthusiasts that sold previously (and they might be rebuying at a loss after selling 6.4 because potato)
The hard trade is the right trade: If it is easy to sell, don't; and if it is easy to buy, don't. Do the trade that is hard to do and that which the crowd finds objectionable.
Eh still plenty bear here. Shorting

Liquidated short at 7200.... It's all gone
Hello to all, found an intersting analysis on the current BTC-market... what do you think... next goal 7700$?
https://de.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSDT/1MomqJvL/
In the last 4 hours the price hit twice a low of exactly $7,280.90, missing my long limit order by $1.10. It's like they know what my orders are
Kinda new got a question about margin trading.  If I have 2.5 eth and I short 4x for 10eth.  But I hold 2.5 eth, How do I get liquidated???  I have Kraken credit fees, that is why I am wondering.

I have 7900 as short term resistance until we break that I don't see any "FOMO" money entering from sidelines...This minor bump is only from the extreme selling pressure letting up and bots auto buying trying to paint a short term uptrend.

So normally I just lurk on threads to find information to trade on, and I only recently started lurking on this page.  I wasn’t on here back in February, but what was everyone calling for on the days leading up to the 6th?
Daily Bitcoin Update (4/3/18) + Technical Analysis

https://youtu.be/fjnPFkx1SPQ
Explain to an idiot. 
so if you're shorting on Mex, and BTC goes down 10 percent. Do you technically lose 10 percent value of your margin despite the PNL.?
On gdax, eth bch and ltc have all been dumping steadily during the time BTC is in this sideways bear-flag-type 1minute formation. Does that signal anything, like either another impending btc dump - or selling those coins for a btc pump?
34.3k Longs vs 27.3k Shorts, i guess there will be some long hunting
seems like slow accumulation by bigger buyers so far, reminds me a lot of last april when we had that slow climb after ETF crash and everyone was spelling d00m (edit: might have said that too soon kek)
Bitcoin bottomed on Feb 6th at $5,861 on GDAX. We will consolidate for a while before the next bull though.
Anyone see the fractals gonna fractal chart? Had it up on my work laptop since last wednesday. Hit play just to check it out this morning. The dip he predicted is much less than what actually happened, but the pattern itself looks very damn close.
https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/OHlO0FS4-Fractals-gonna-fractal-To-11-7k-updated/

kinda funny/ironic. Looking like another pump might happen soon
I am almost certain that we go down somewhere between here and the low 8's - probably before we reach 7.9k. The big question for me, is whether or not we will make a lower low than 6.4k (within roughly 10 days). Failure to make a lower low would obviously be med-term bullish.
If this wedge breaks down, what target are you looking at? 7k?
[So I posted a few hours ago that I didn't have faith in this channel](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/899akt/daily_discussion_tuesday_april_03_2018/dwqqfcx/). I ended up shorting at 7485 because it broke the blue dotted line with little volume, and so far it's paying off. Not sure where to take profits since I believe it will resume the climb. For now I am closing at 7285 but might even close sooner if it bounces. Not interested on losing even 1 USD here.

[This is the chart as I see it right now.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/EmhQRn1I) I don't think it will test the bottom of the channel and actually hope it doesn't since it will hurt my cold stash.
Anyone short from 7.4k? Looking to make my first ever trade. Starting small. Ideally a short from the 7,800 resistance would be the choice but seems like 7.4k is not a terrible place right now. 
When I look back, I can't find a time when a major downtrend reversed without a V bottom. Am I wrong?
7500 rejected just the once? Sketchy market is sketchy.
[removed]
I just closed my 5x short form 7500, and my hedge short from 7200 at a "loss", but I'm up in fiat, so it's not a real loss. I'm trying to get over the negative connotations of a negative BTC value when it really doesn't matter if your fiat is going up. That's all I care about. Fiat. At the end of the day.
Is anyone good with counting Elliott waves for BTC, I have some calculations with my friends, we got 6k right and a couple of other numbers. It was drawn Elliott, but last seven days we are confused. We expected BTC  to be in the last fifth wave of huge Elliot, but this drop went down further then we expected.

Does anyone have amy TA with longer period Elliotts?

closed my short, 

could have closed it two days back.

got a bit too greedy.

will reenter if we break 7k or at the 7.8 range.

am out 
Looks like we're up for more sideways like yesterday, slowly rise 100$, dump 100$. Repeat some more. Then probably try breaking 7400. We'll see
Hedge short from 7170 last night. Looking to close it after getting through that resistance. Think we will test 7200?

Looks like we found our resistance. Seems bullish for here on out
ENOUGH. If you are going to break through 7,400 just DO IT. Put me out of my misery of waiting for it to go down to 6k instead before going back in. If you are going to plummet, holy crap whales just take your profit and let it plummet.

I still think we're at the bottom of eve on an Adam and eve formation on the 3 day.  Well, a little less at the bottom now, but still.
  The longer we go up, the more the formation holds.
This won't drop under 7.2. My friends uncle told me his friend's son is buying billions of USD worth of Bitcoin OTC. This is just a small bear trap in the overall bullish market from 0.01 USD to 7k USD (that's like a gazillion % run and it's still not over). 

Expecting 7.8 in the morning. 
I said I wouldn't add anymore after 7.4 but I closed out that portion earlier today and I'm salivating at the thought of adding back at 7.7. We just need one more push and the higher the better because it will result in the greatest possible despair when the whole rotten structure comes crashing down to 5k. 
10x short all in at 7.3k

fukkin hell, had to mash that sell tab.

came thorugh.
Looks like we will hit 7000 this morning, maybe lower around 6800.
the last month or so, shorting the dump and longing the breakout has been painful.

wonder whats gonna happen here. 
So close. So very close.

I put my Kraken order in at 5250 EUR after I saw it it 5250.2. The price did drop to 5250, but my order didn't execute before the sudden pump. 
Alright I'll FOMO - long opened 5x from $7,366
Seems like pretty heavy resistance around 7330. Opened a small short in case we get knocked down, stop just above 7400.

Moment of truth could soon be upon us. Let's see if 7300 holds. If it doesn't it's more than likely we'd fall to retest 7200. 

7200 breaks then unpack your suitcase dear because the holiday is cancelled
guys do you reckon this is just a retrace.


or is this just anotehr bull trap?

thinking of closing my short if we retrace a bit, entry is now 7.8k after all the dcaing
[deleted]
This is the point when everybody want to buy sub 7k but we wont get there so soon again. I dont think we go above 8k soon and we will stay in the 7k for quite some time and wait how the general public awarness behaves.
I'm starting to think that I should apply good old common sense here.

We had 6k, looked to retest and got held up at 7.3k which went up 1k. Then we headed down to 6k again and got stopped at 6400.

As a betting man I'd say should it head down there and bounce again (6-6600) then that'll be a massive vote of confidence to investors. 

First week of February seems a long time ago now.
Let's hope for no FUD news this time otherwise we are fcked

Bought some corn at $7400 that won’t be available to sell until tomorrow morning. If we dump hard before then I’ll be pissed fam 
Bulls here are delusional. They have been smacked down more times than they can count the past few months, but still with each little bounce they declare the pain to be over. Watch this one go to $7.7k only to dump hard again (I expect $6.8k at first, and then well below $6k). 

This bear market has just began.

I believe Magic Poop Cannon is a tool for spreading FUD really. If he was genuine he would have used his real name and face. Like this guy: https://www.tradingview.com/u/MarcPMarkets/.
I also added to my June fut long but took my CA up a bit higher to 6.6.  I'll probably take some profit around 7800, and hold off on other TP for mid or upper 8s which is where a breakout of the [big falling wedge](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Wa8haCM4/) could land, and keep some of it open for later.  What are your targets?

Sorry about your short.  I scaled out 75% of mine around BE, and moved the SL on the remaining 25% to 7155 which got triggered.  A rare example of where chickening out didn't backfire.  Yay for risk management.

(edit, I'm not saying it's a straight shot to the 8s or even 7.8.  Am prepared for further oscillation within that wedge)
Yep. 8K soon
> This could very well be the beginning of the end of the bear market. Which is a pretty exciting situation, even if the odds of that are a bit long.

Please. God. Please
Glad to see you claiming the bear market might be coming to an end.

I got a little worried at 6400. I really thought 8500 was the bottom, and then we dumped to 7500. 6400 got me thinking maybe it is all fucked.

I hope we break the log resistance soon. If not, I can’t imagine BTC staying above 6k for much longer...
Nicely put chewy, I still think that opening a long at 7.3k is a good idea, stop at 6.8k with lower leverage.

We just went trhough a fomo on shorting lately, so some will still figth the trend/defend their position, even if it goes to 7k before 7.5k it's still short term bullish.

Opened a 2x long at 7035 also, will close bellow 7.8k. Then depending on the action looking for a new short entry with this time maybe a long term view on it and a resonable leverage.

I still hate myself for closing my 6.7k 5x long, I will be rich as fuck now and conforntable but meh still a good trade.

Closed my long from 7000 @7315 when it started behaving like yesterday as i can't watch charts while working and already had good profits. If later on 7200 is tested and holds might enter long again with stops @7100 or so. And with a smaller position so i don't lose much 
It's a weird sensation seeing you so (albeit cautiously) bullish. I myself am becoming increasingly bearish: the bounce is quite weak so far and volume is lacking. The $6k bottom in February felt and behaved like a bottom. This time around it doesn't look convincing at all. But I'll be happily surprised if we are able to break $9.2k the coming weeks.
>This could very well be the beginning of the end of the bear market.  

didn't you say the same thing when we jumped to 8800 two weeks ago?
You are smart not to use automated stops or you would have been stopped out of that 7030 long yesterday eh bro? Congrats on it working out for you
> This could very well be the beginning of the end of the bear market. Which is a pretty exciting situation, even if the odds of that are a bit long.

Hope in the face of poor odds; sounds like it's time for me to open a short again.
so true. I think that's really the main key to adding to the stack. As someone that new to the hold game, I can 100% agree. Each day is diff
It's great for sentiment. People just miss the fact that you're supposed to countertrade people here.
I have only ever lost money by listening to people in this sub.

That's why we are pumping
Bullish
I think we've never been in this situation before, where we have "shorting mania" and basically the opposite of the bull run where everybody's grandma bought whatever they could get their hands on. I'm curious how it will play out. The direction is probably up at some point, but how violent will it be? Will we go down afterwards?
yeah it's probably going to take a while for word to get out that the bear party might be over 
I also have a tron holding coworker. He has almost 100K, and still believes in it
what about the bitcoin bearz group lol
We are oversold at 6k but overbought at 8k?

What market have you been investing in? A 2k spread is not the edges of the market
On the other hand, the losing trades are much more valuable long term since they forces you to think what went wrong. I also have big respect for posts like this not just bragging about profits but telling your reasoning and the outcome of them. Many good traders are wrong 40-50% of the time anyway
I'm consistently amazed at how quickly 90% of the people in this sub forget how many times this has already happened.

I get it, I really do. This "could" be the reversal.

You'd just think people would realize now that it doesn't simply go down forever and ever. 
Also, people need to realize this when calling people "bears" and "bulls". These people aren't either, they're the hogs getting slaughtered 
My favorite thing about the "contrarian indicator" thing (which can be accurate) is that bulls pull it out when they're feeling extra confident at the first legs of a bounce, meaning we should be bearish again
Schizophrenia is life. 
Personally, it looks like a stiff breeze could blow this over. 
If it repeats the same modus operandi should be right around the corner, then some more sideways for few hours.
The channel is tightening so the interval between moves should get smaller
thank you for your service
I Guess I should just stop putting stop limits lol it's causing me to take more L's than W's 
7520?
Stops hunting whales favorite game in a bear market
8520??? Ummm you mean 7520?
I'm feeling your first chart. That sums up what I'm seeing pretty well.

IMO, this is a corrective elliot wave from ATH. Were struggling to find the bottom for wave C, though.

Welcome back. Looking forward to you posting solid TA again.
I find this price movement absolutely creepy...

Idk, it just depends. Marrying your position is bad if you're sitting underwater, but if it allows you to be more patient it'll very likely pay off in the long run 
No Homo, I want to know what you look like 
Norsk eller?
stay toxic ya'll
lmao there i am thinking you shorted it because the price dipped a little after you posted, nice call
wait, you held your long all the way down to 6450?

Also, what leverage ratio? Even at 10x that still means you had 220k in BTC on BitMex.  Didn’t know people felt comfortable depositing that many coins to an exchange to trade with
For the risk that you have taken, you should had sold half and ride the rest, this may take to 8k.
Yep, hopefully we continue up to the trend line.
[deleted]
You are right. some big sell legs last 1 -2 hours but well absorbed.

Let's see.

Yup
Or a straight upwards channel but you have to squint your eyes a bit
They all got rekted can't be taxed if you don't win :D
you only need to report if you closed positions for profit. a lot of people are under right now. and then many others are in profit and don't plan on closing anytime soon.
~~That's one for every 5 million. I find that to be si interesting... How many of those tax filings include stocks?~~ [Durp, never mind. Brain fart. Sorry.]

I think early adoption is still happening to this day. It might seem to some that bitcoin is everywhere... But I think that's due to media exposure, more than mainstream adoption. So far, the attention is paired with a cautiously positive outlook. I'm optimistic. 
I lol hard at those posts. " derp we need to decouple from bitcoin" It's like a beggar saying he doesn't accept dollars. 
I do have to restrain myself when they go on about 'decoupling'
this is going to $30k
Don't agree with your first line, which only touches candles once.

However, I do agree with the second line, which is IMHO is important line for bulls, and if we manage to breakthrough it, we are good to go to 9k.
I agree with your lines of resistance. You may mean 9K tho?
FWIW, my notes have 7.8k marked as heavy support, but mild resistance, based on previous action at that line.  Though this time around I expect it to offer more resistance than previously.
It’s true. I’m in the middle of a fairly large OTC transaction due to an acquaintance asking me to help.  The buyers are quite secretive but are among the highest elites of different regions. OTC trades are going heavy at the moment. If you know of any OTC traders you can ask them about this. Or just ask Genesis or one of the OTC desks (those aren’t even the ones to set up the bigger trades). 
Why believe him? Who is he? He admits he barely even knows the difference between bids and asks :|
When would it affect the price if true?
He is the source!
> There’s actually thousands of bitcoins for sale between $56k and $100k that I had to move off-screen, otherwise the chart just looks really ridiculous

Wait what? Really?

oh I guess I read that wrong, that's not too crazy I guess. 
This chart clearly indicates that the bears have the upper hand. Especially with the insane amount of longs still open, I anticipate that if we were to reject a resistance level, the buy side is not going to stack up too quickly.

On the other hand, if we start gobbling up the ask side, then I anticipate there’s a ton of additional ammo to be put up.

Personally, I think we will stay in this 7500-ish range for a little bit and then choose a direction. I doubt we will go to 11k or higher on this run, but the historian in me says that we dumped to 880 last year and started our recovery at the end of March, so history could repeat itself.

Target for a sick run would be 50k this time around... fingers crossed
Ya I was gonna say yesterday that the nicest part about this is it isn't just some fuck head buying 900 btc in 30 seconds and it looks like genuine buying 
> It's basically like adding or removing from your position, but just having two instead

I've just arrived at the same conclusion.  I'm thinking of it as having a low leveraged long term and a higher leveraged short term.

But at this current stage in the experiment the short term one is also low leverage and smaller than the long term one, keeping the longer one as a backup to absorb losses on the short term one.

Seems like it'll be cleaner to manage than scalping back and forth on a single position.
Ya I’ve arrived at a similar strategy. Only thing is you gotta keep yourself honest about the prospects of your high leverage bets lol (I.e. don’t let your separate strategies start melding together)
can you draw it?
Looks about the same to me.
A bit too soon in my opinion, should go above 7500 soon

[Chart](https://imgur.com/a/X4Ak7)
Dang that was a quick change of heart.
Have a medium sized underwater short that I was planning to close with some losses past 7500. Liq is well above 8.5, part of me wants to ride this one out.
Dude. Zoom out. 
[deleted]
Not until we go over 7.4k imo. And RSI is overbought on 1h, last time it was this overbought was March 21. And damn, I keep getting rekt by shorting, I'm done margin trading.
Zoom out. I see no reason to believe this isn’t just another bump on the way down. It already appears to be losing momentum.
whats your entry, this might get to 7.7

i just dont see anything above that , considering all the shorts and profit taking that will happen.

but if it wer to get above 7.7k will bail out on my short 
[Congruent with this chart as well](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/iKdrq87Q-Is-Bitcoin-correcting-like-it-did-in-The-Spring-of-2013/) 
I still see more talk of which alts to buy on Facebook than anything else.  It's sort of sad that they don't want to buy Bitcoin because it is so expensive, but even when on sale they can't see the value because of unit bias.

Of course there are HODL groups as well, who will likely be right on the longer timeframes.  I haven't seen the get short message much, but I think there are groups forming around that idea.  You definitely see it on the message boards like this and I have had at least one conversation with someone never in crypto interested in getting short.
pretty much everyone on those groups is dumb and has been HODLing the entire time lol

The funny part is a lot even fell for the hodl meme with some alts, poor baggieholders!
You have a plan to close at 7.8. Stick to it and come up with a contingency (stop loss) in case plan A fails. 

Switch plans = chopped up, bamboozled, gently caressed because you often switch up based on impulse instead of sound reasoning. 
Think of it like this:

If you exit now, you'll probably still get a chance to buy at $7,500 even if this does take off to $7,800. (the market would most likely bounce off $7,800 and retrace at least to $7,500). 

You might also avoid a significant dump and get to choose whether to re-buy lower or sit it out. 
Reload. D/HCA FTW.
I've been hearing this since $10k and expect to be hearing it all the way down to $3k.
> This is just a prediction, I'm not claiming to know the future

Awesome.
7.450 is the new 12k.
yes this is a bi-polar sub with extreme manic episodes.
At the end of the week they will cry when the price hits 6200.
With the volume sort of just dribbling the price up it feels less like a rise of conviction and more like sellers content to be patient
permabulls are desperate for something to latch on to.
One more thing: traders don't have a god damn clue what they're trading.

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/899akt/daily_discussion_tuesday_april_03_2018/dwqmbcd/
Agreed. Either not trade at all, or set really tight SL's.

When global markets take a hit a digital gold is a natural hedge, might be too early, but no doubt it's happening.    In a digital more advanced society gold bars aren't going to work so well.
Lost 3,500$ when we hit 6k in Feb. Sold at bottom. I forgave myself 
Feel you.  I sold a lot at 9k bottom in between the 11.7 twin peaks, no leverage, was with the holding stack.  Rebought for a fair loss near the re-top, only to see it drop back down a few weeks later.

In that situation it would have been less loss to have been in a leveraged hedge that got liquidated.  Not gonna short my "real" coins again.
us fellow shorties feel your pain.
I think this has good R/R right now. Not great, but if you manage your risk on this well I think you could end up in profit. I haven't closed my long, and I'm looking at staying in as the same thing as buying here. I'm feeling good about it.
Also, 2H BBands seem sticky. I think we'll ride them for a while.
7.3 was resistance, it needs to hold here for at least couple hours to confirm break. I'd say breaking 7.5 will be bullish.

Also small scalp short but watching for now, looks like it lost momentum.
Roger Ver died for our sins.
7500-7550 also seems to be around the closing point of this ascending wedge: https://www.tradingview.com/x/sKcEMGZd/ 
If we go sub 5k there won't be any crazy V-bottom bounces leading back to ATH levels. Anyone who thinks that after this sideways bleed we could shed another 30% or more off the price and then see investors pile on to 10k+ levels is just mad with greed.
Honestly if it goes to $5.9k again I'm fairly sure it'll fall through. A double bottom *could* happen but the sell volume is so high on the way down that I wouldn't be surprised if it just dumps through to like $5.5k and people's spirits break and there's no buying pressure left to sustain an upward push for the double bottom. 
Ok, thanks for all you input, very interesting.
So let  me tell you my thoughts FWIW. I haven't been in bitcoin as long as most of you, just over a year and a bit investing, but dabbled a few times before that (wish I had kept them instead though).

Now, as I said I don't really have a grasp on TA, but (like Huggy Bear) I do know a bit about the word on the street. I talk to people about BTC and cryptos occasionally and couldn't really generate any interest from people last year.
When BTC was <3k i was talking to my friends (who all earn more than me by quite a lot) and couldn't really get much enthusiasm, they had heard about it but didn't undertstand it

Interest was starting to stir Mid October when BTC was still less than <6K just but I don't think any of them bought in because it was still too much hassle and they seemed to follow the 'Tulips/Ponzi' narrative because that was their bias most likely.

They did have the sense to listen when we spoke early December and I said don't touch it as even I could see it was getting a little silly.
Sadly although I followed my own advice to an extent by selling some I bought back in way too early.. Never mind

Anyway TLDR.....word on the street is MEH....
We will not go to 3k to arouse confidence or satisfy some TA requirements. 

We will go to 3k because at this time Bitcoin offers less than 3k of value but speculation will probably prop up the price at 3k. 
There are a few reasons why one could argue that continued decline below $6,000 is necessary, but "capitulation" isn't really one of them.

The primary reason is that the market has not undergone adequate price discovery in the area between $1,160 and $6,000. 

The market blew through that area with barely a second-glance in the rear view mirror on the way through it. 

Now, the counter argument is that bitcoin was wildly undervalued in the sub $1,160 range to begin with, and is still wildly undervalued within the $1,160 to $6,000 range. So additional price discovery within that range might not be necessary.

The second reason is more psychological. 

Any market is a revolving door of investors. People buy at x price and sell to a new buyer at y price point. 

There have been several "waves" of investors at various intervals. $200 to $1,160 saw a wave of investors that redistributed their coins to new investors on the way back down through that range. 

$1,160 to $20,000 saw yet a new group of investors who are all still in the process of redistributing their coins to new investors. 

The way I like to think of it is that "expensive" bitcoins are relative to the wave of buyers. For somebody who bought at $20,000, $6,000 seems like it's the best price they are going to be able to sell at before shit really hits the fan.

To a new investor, however, who missed the boat on the run up to $20K, $6,000 may seem like a bargain. $3,000 even moreso. 

"capitulation" is essentially just the movement of coins from "weak hands" into "strong hands." You're taking a coin from somebody who thinks they're lucky to sell when they did and putting it in the hands of somebody who is thankful they had the opportunity to buy when they did. 

To prevent additional decline, the # of strong hands needs to outnumber the # of weak hands. 

Somebody who bought at $6K+ would panic at $3,000. Somebody who bought at $6000 to $3,000 would be less likely to sell, and would potentially buy more to improve their average entry.
How didn't we haven capitulation? A 70% btc bottom and a 80%-90% bottom in alts. Anyone who hasn't shaken out by now is longterm hodling 
My thinking is, its the point where the market makers aka whales, institutions, etc have decided this is the cheapest they can accumulate and are going to give up shorting the market and help pump the price...until next cycle. I know its not the definition of capitulation but it's what I see is being necessary for the next bullrun.
Capitulation is not a need, is an effect. There are several kinds of bottom besides a capitulation bottom. A flat accumulation bottom, a double bottom... each with different price action profiles.

People want a capitulation bottom because its the most dramatic. A huge red spike down seemingly making everyone think there is no lower price for the active, forums fill up with desilusion in a single hour, news get made. 

Then suddenly out of nowhere price climbs back up half way leaving only the guys that where lucky to have their bids in the right place feeling like they are the best traders in the world, and the ones that had their bids below the spike like the cursed of the earth.

And the price chasing begins, both the bids that near missed and the bottom sellers get back in. Then slowly over the next weeks people start realizing that everyone that wanted to sell has already sold, only asks from scalpers and "smart" traders that want to get out on the bounce and not on the bottom are selling.

Each day the passes every one that sold and said "fuck this crap" sees the price creeping up, until one by one become bulls again and fuel the next leg of the rally. Eventually a top happens in the exact reverse way with lambos, 1Mil or eat my dick bets, your barber talking about the new hot crypto ICO he bought. Epics get written, movies are casted, heroes and villains are heralded by the unwashed masses...
Capitulation is necessary so a lot of people don't drop their bags the moment they have a chance. 

It's not necessary as long as optimism gets very high. Very rare after a crash.
"TA experts"...lol
Just a guess (i have no idea) but maybe it relates to a point when the fake run-up strategy (like the one we're in now) no longer works because market demand is just totally dead i.e. FOMO has gone. At that point I guess we return to a less manic/fear driven market that can then begin a long, slow organic recovery to higher highs.
The funny thing about the market right now is that one of two things is true:

1. The sell pressure is completely gone
2. The sell pressure is very much still there, and sellers will dump hard at the first opportunity. 

Regardless of which it is, however, the market will behave **exactly** the same way. 

The market is going to be afraid of its own shadow for some time to come, regardless of whether $6,000 was actually the bottom or it's just a temporary pit-stop on the way to further decline.
Who would the house be in this metaphor?
Wait for this little pump to lose steam and you can again bet against it.
Don't jinx it!
I was always wondering: Is someone following asian channels? And what is the sentiment there?
They're waiting for the dump around 3pm UTC.
remember, up is always organic, down is manipulation.
It has to go up to short

Is it Your Intuition or Are You “Into Wishing?”
If we are in fact going up, broke out of the downward channel holding us to a probable 6k if not lower then the next biggest resistance is 11.7 again. Anything until that point is just going to be a matter of time
I think we will see bid volume pick up if this resistance is broken.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/qgaA2nY3/
I actually think the hidden bear div at $8k isn't a real one because it wasn't a local high but more of a bear flag/sideways channel. $9k was an actual local high. 

the RSI will form a hidden bear div on longer time frames when we get past ~$7.6k 
nothing is gonna happen, unless we go over9 or even 10k, in which case a new bull run might be in anyways, but this scenario itself is highly unlikely.  same way longs at 9k didn’t get squeezed at 6.5
a lot of shorts are being opened right now. A drop is imminent, to 68xx / 70xx at least. 
People were actually arguing with me how having stop losses on *leveraged* shorts entered under $7000 was a 'terrible' way to trade. Pretty incredible.
Too early to say anything, I guess. 

he still has another day
If you didn’t use that much leverage, this could still be fine in a couple of days, who knows.

Don’t get overhyped with a 3 day bounce when market makers have been dumping on your ass for the last 3 month.
It's almost like we weren't at 8.2k a week ago.  
Adding to my short @ 7500.
closed my long at 7500, opened a short at 7400.
will try to ride it to 7100. Let's see :)
I dunno man the last time we pumped we had good news + bottom + volume , now
we have none of those things well except maybe bottom 
I'm a confused bull 
Can you explain why you think this looks solid? Didn’t we pump about 10% recently and still come crashing down to new lows?
I kinda like the low volume slow climb, it feels someone “ Natural “ and feels sustainable to me 
Why do you keep your losses like that and not take profits 
you posted it yourself : https://twitter.com/SwenLink/status/979832264434610179?s=19
Aren’t we still at ATH longs too though?

All this means is that no one is using fiat to buy or sell
Yeah reversed the whole thing. 
It's not impossible, but $3k should take some time to reach, with some serious "fake-coveries" in between...  Not a straight capitulation downward like we are on now.  That's how these bear markets drag on for months.
It’s so obvious the ones that got money on it going down post all these wishful predictions that it’s going to 5K and vice versa. All wishful BS because nobody knows wtf it’s gonna do. 
[deleted]
Same. Wearing my super skeptical hat: if something crazy like $3K is the end goal then I can see the market needing another massive disappointment to fuel sufficient despair to get there. For me that feels something like $7.9K to $8.4K range before the cruel whale dumping resumes.
It's forming a George Costanza.
Where are the other contact points for the support line as drawn?

I guess to ask another way, what was it supporting before it turned into resistance, in order for it to be notable switching back? 

/u/_chewtoy_ talked about this some last week when we were going over and under "log support" that was continually redrawn.
Not sure why you got downvoted.  A legit observation, IMO.  Can anyone say why we *shouldn't* watch that?
+1. this. makes me feel bullish. I'm just waiting for these downward channels to give up. maybe we'll have a third one.
you see a falling wedge, I see a desending channel with consistent, if not increasing volume

https://www.tradingview.com/x/t4S3u4O4/
Yup, looks similar to what I'm seeing here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/899akt/daily_discussion_tuesday_april_03_2018/dwq3z3w/
If it repeats it should go to 8800 before coming back down again. Still a very nice long opportunity.
[removed]
[removed]
I think we're in a healthy retrace; setting a lower high on the 4H and in good position to move above 7500 in the next few hours. 

I'll be scaling sells once we break 7800 until we clearly break through 8000 and hold it. Then we can possibly test the log resistance at ~8800. 
Edit: Explaination of the sells: I expect we'll bounce off of the 20EMA at around 7900 and retest 6000. I'll have stops in place should we push above 8200.


7500 was likely the local top and will be down below 7000 within 48 hrs.
I can't really estimate the probability accurately unfortunately. 
But fast? We have pretty much constantly suffered past few weeks with occassional bounces and in general whole Q1, so wouldnt call anything at this point fast.
If we break 7450, set that breakeven stop, man
Nah bro that channel gonna take us to 25k, but by 2020. #permabull

Kidding.

On a more serious note, I think we're in a [rising wedge](https://www.tradingview.com/x/fp06kgpS/) on the 1H charts and we'll probably break down once the bbands tighten back up which I think will happen within the next hour.
Probably a small percentage but most is just normal market cycles.
this was discussed not long ago, and the prevailing viewpoint on this daily was that the impact was negligible. I strongly disagree with that viewpoint.
If you were in at 7k, would you consider this a DCB?  Or do you think you're calling it a DCB because you're out?
Your discipline is truly admirable :) Patience & discipline will reward you in the end. Don't regret sticking to the plan. 

Seriously, I admire your discipline, it must be difficult knowing how bullish you were a few months ago. Even if you end up being wrong, it doesn't mean it was a "bad" trade. 
How is a dead cat worth $7000, again? DCBs are for companies going to zero. We need a different term for Bitcoin since it's not going to anywhere near zero for the foreseeable future.
I agree with that thought, but here's the counter argument...

Market cycles are very similar, regardless of which market it is. However, what makes crypto so unique is the fact that it's global and trading is open 24/7. And crypto being so speculative is a unique variable that is nearly impossible to weight against any market cycle.

I realize that there was a multi-year bear market that set a precedence that this can be very extensive length-wise, but you must consider that the cat has been let out of the bag, so to speak. Most people know what Bitcoin is at this point. They didn't during the last bear market.

More spectators, more investors, and the other variables I discussed could speed up the typical market cycle time exponentially.

Still, I'm skeptical. This is either a sucker's rally, or the "this looks like a sucker's rally" from the market cycle phase pattern we've all seen shared around here.
Quick point: In the past 4 months we have seen a revolutionary movement with what’s happening with crypto. It’s being integrated more than ever into nearly everything. There is so much potential in the upcoming year where we could have one major news outbreak and send us ATH levels again. 
Long way from reversal. Gotta break ~10k and hold it for that. 
You’re mostly true that bear market is not over. But that doesn’t mean we’re going straight to 3k and stay there. There will be bull trap, disbelief rally...
well, we don't have a mtgox event. that was one major reason why the bear market lasted so long. 
I feel the same way. It's easy for people who didn't experience 2014-2016 to say bear season is over just because it dropped a certain %. As far as my non-TA naked eyes see it, we are just making lower highs with not much volume with the exception of a couple impressive buys here and there. I can't set a time frame on a complete reversal but I think it will take some serious manipulation to not only get people to FOMO in but also to keep those still underwater from selling when they hit their buy-in price. The thought that this is just another pump ready to get dumped on I am sure is lingering over most people's minds. I don't know maybe the shitty weather here in the NYC area is just making me feel even more bearish.
Crypto time is not normal time, everything is compressed.  I'm surprised it took 4 months.
We are still printing lower highs and lower lows on the daily chart so I don't understand why you would think this is a reversal. The reversal will only came after a giant flush and a big fat bounce. 3k-4k Is still very much on the table and almost a certainty by this point. 
Thats what makes it more likely to be true
Honestly, It’s kinda of relaxing and enjoyable 
This looks like pretty textbook ascending consolidation before another large green candle upwards
What do you mean by labored?
All day I was excited looking forward to 7800 at least. Just now I found a note I probably wrote last night. 

"Sell around 7500"

So far I've mostly burned myself by not sticking to the plan.
I've just closed my position :)
I'm absolutely amazed at the short term memory loss that some people in here have. At this point we have gone up about 4% since yesterday. That's it.

Nothing has happened yet. Yes we broke the 7200 barrier that people were banging on about but that's it. 

Are people seriously FOMOing in right now or is that just a 'down with the kids joke'? 
Sure placing a speculative long at 7250 up to 7500 is worth a pop but that's just to see if you can scrap some profit here. Should 7500 break maybe go again up to 7800.

Baring in mind the 1 hour RSI is now overbought and the 2 hour is approaching, plus the fact we can't seem to break 7400... i'd be very careful here. Not saying we won't just blast through 7400 but we could just as likely fall now down to under 7300 and approach 7200.

Other than that I have nothing else to moan about!
That's fair, but keep in mind people are trading at different time intervals. Some daytrade, some trade by the 5min, and some trade by the daily or longer. No matter how you see it, you will be missing movement sitting out. There's nothing wrong with that, and uncertainty should keep you away from a position. But we are not all uncertain, and some of us will even be right.
Yes and we are at same point as 16 Nov 2017??

> dumb money has given up all hope of a new bull run

how do I sign up to get the email for when this happens?
Dumb money is shorting right now so the trend reversal started?
The bottom is in when all you noobs go broke from shorting.
Need a tissue?
What's your take on the ATH shorts & everyone and their mother wanting to short bitcoin ?
May 2014 price action is truly the stuff of nightmares. Sure fucking looked like we were gonna moon again, didn't it? Repeating that price action would be a literal worst case scenario IMO. 

I legit convinced my brother to buy a single BTC at $700 at the top of that fakout. Like the very top. Thank god he held. 
If you’re applying the 2013-14 bubble pop fractal to this bubble, then there should be another bull run before the 2-3 year bear/consolidation 
MPC and Dark are just pushing their own agendas. Multiple charts + constant updates per day begging for likes only goes to show they're making money on stuff other than trading BTC. They're make money off headlines for their charts not actual TA. Notice all the new technical analyst on tradingview that use female avatars. Its becoming a joke
But ...MPC said he loved me 
Not too different from the last month. 
Wouldn't be surprised to see us going up to touch the bottom of the log support-turned-resistance at approx 7.8 - 7.9k before turning downwards again. Will be looking to scale in shorts from 7.4k to 7.8k. 
[deleted]
No one's said BTC has recovered, but recovery has to start somewhere.

If you believe in TA the "almost" double bottom is potentially bullish

What's most bullish to me atm though is how much dumb money is in shorts. This kind of upswing wouldn't be possible without liquidations.
Yeah and also people apparently forget that the market recovered by like 25% in May of 2014. We all know what happened through the rest of the year.
I get hope from there not really being a strong bounce from the last days lows. When theres no hopium for the CO to sell into, he might as well just reverse the market.
This time is different; 7.8k this week where a very lazy drawing on chart tells me is the important resistance level
True. It is premature to draw any conclusions. The upward movement, however, gives welcome relief to us hodlers. May be transient but relief is relief.
> Are people forgetting the last few months?!

Low IQ usually involves very poor/short memory.
Thinking the same, sold my stack and waiting for a drop to get back in.
moved the price $.40
I follow the ETH/BTC ratio. 

And it's been devastated, day after day. 

A leveraged ratio long position of mine was liquidated.
nice scalp
I don't think the wedge is that important...probably some consolidation, maybe a retrace to $7.3k or $7.2k before continuing upwards over the next few days. Don't get shaken out! Take it from me, the resident expert on getting shaken out. I'm riding this long for a while for once.
Still didnt close mine, maybe I'm greedy. 

If 7.3k dont break, this can still 7.5k>7.3k>7.65k

Is that the wedge you're looking at? I want to go to bed but can't decide if I want to leave my long open with a stop or just take profits here. Entered pretty close to the bottom so don't mind holding it if we drop down to ~$7200ish or so before another attempt higher which leaves me enough room for an okay stop loss... but I'm actually thinking another push higher here looks likely in the next few hours. I trade off MACD & RSI a lot and both 15 min / 1 hours look like they've gotten the needed relief with only a slight dip in price. 15 min MACD especially looks like it's ready to curve back up soon and pave the way for a potential test of ~$7700-$7900 range, perhaps. The only thing that bothers me somewhat is the amount of sell walls flashing on and off on Bitfinex, the same 200 coin wall has spooked the buyers off a few times already. 

I might be a little too optimistic here, but idk. This move so far felt too 'right' in many ways to just fade back down sub $7000 imo.
Thanks for the updates and insight to your positions. I sadly didn't get my finances in order this week to play the game so I've been living vicariously through your updates
I think its the safest path, but my bet is that we go to 7500 before 7300
why do you close your wedge before the support line is crossed\`?

Person said bullish in comment? Bearish.
Bullish posts immediately get upvoted and bearish posts immediately get downvoted?

Bearish.
Volume/liquidity on the testnet has dropped off as newbies jumped in with both feet. All the cowboys are handing real BTC over to the patient folks now. 
Very poor liquidity and lots of bullnoobs. Price is generally at a premium because newer traders in this space seem to favor going long over short 
The point is to test trading techniques, features, and API access, not necessarily to replicate full orderbooks. We do intend to increase the simulated activity on Testnet to make it more like the real site, but that is less of a priority than to provide a safe environment to test code.
Tries to open shirt, can’t figure out 2FA. Bottom confirmed. 
Careful with that leverage, you might lose that shirt instead
Thank it later. It was one market sell that triggered some downward momentum but bulls are not giving up. No clear direction = no trade zone.

Edit: Also, please don't take your shirt (off) - understand that things can get pretty nasty in BTC trading, but take it easy ;)
You should wait for the dust to settle, don't try to catch a falling knife. This can bounce back to 7.4 like nothing happened.
people here like ling-sleeves
Tells you a little bit about BBands huh
Wow that's pretty bearish.

I'm buying with both hands if we make it below $5K USD.
I suspect he pulled that information from the same place he shits from.

Not sure what people get out of tweeting things like this - it's obviously not going to incite any fomo.
For what it's worth, I've been hearing about big OTC buys coming through in a steady stream for a few weeks as well. Nothing verifiable but yeah.

So how did we get segwit?
We disagree on a lot. I'd say about 60% of the time we disagree, which I enjoy. On this issue, though, we seem to be in perfect alignment. I started reading hoping to find something to bitch about and I couldn't find anything. A little disappointed, honestly.
I would not touch Verge with a short.  It just took off again.  It has had a consistent climb straight up.  Can't be many folks taking gains.  Long time until the 17th and the "announcement"
Some ppl i work with are super bullish about XVG...i'm undecided, but hope the best for them.
How so?
I'd generally expect weak-handed shorts opened below $7,000 to be closing between $7,250 and $7,400 and strong-handed shorts to be opening in that same zone. 

Suicidal yolo longs would also be opening here. 

It's a bit of no-man's land though.
If this sub is a worthwhile gauge of retail sentiment (and it seems to have been) then the enormity of the flip shouldn't be underestimated. Reading this sub it feels all but inevitable that there will be a shot at ATH resistance.

Chad is either liquidated and out of the market entirely or way long right now.
I suggest to make a spreadsheet for calculating the potential profits/losses of your entries and target stop losses and target profit zones, and display the risk reward ratio.

Also a little tip, don't set targets based on how much money you want to make, set targets based on where you think the price will go or won't go.

Make a trade log of profits/losses and keep track of it.  And to get started, do some **pretend trades** against that log.

And I hope that that 1btc was just an example with a round number.  Don't put more than a few hundred dollars on the line for your first trades.
"Buffett, quoting partner Munger, says there are three ways to go broke: 'liquor, ladies and leverage'"

If you go 2x, Kraken will lend you 2x the amount that you are risking. The amount you are risking is called collateral, on kraken it can be fiat or BTC ETH.


Welcome to the degen club, be prepare to lose : https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/202967016-How-do-I-trade-using-leverage- 
No, if you're opening a long for 1 btc with 2x leverage you're putting up 1/2 btc and borrowing 1/2 btc so your profit would be $400. The leverage doesn't multiply the opening amount, it just determines how much of that 1 btc you're borrowing. If you open for 1 btc it doesn't matter if you go no leverage or 5x, you still only have 1 btc in the game
That’s not right (at least on Kraken). The number you put under “amount” is the total position size, and leverage determines what fraction of that position size you have to put down. So, you would get the result you are after by inputting 2 BTC as amount and 2x as leverage. That means you pay for 1 BTC when you initiate the trade, and you will pay fees for borrowing another BTC. When you close he position, profits would be 2x the price movement, minus fees.
you were just asking if 7400 was good for your first ever short.


Stop and think about what you are really planning to do with this money.
how much?
Welcome to crypto. Lessons are learned the hard way. I've been there and still recovering my losses inch by inch.
Been there, done that

You will make it back

Most likely faster than you anticipate

I lost a couple BTC in the original dip to 5900 by opening a ton of longs on the way down that always got stopped out and shorting at 5912

Went long at 7900, closed at 9k, long again at 7967, closed at 11.5k

I have more BTC now than I did before the dump
Been there, done that.
After that my stops are tight as hell, 1 or 2% and that's it, unless the macro picture suggests otherwise.
If you find a good entry for a short you can recoup most of it. Don't try and recoup it all at once. I needed like 5 good trades to recoup from 1 bad one (and some 3 or 4 small bad ones along the way)
Learn from it. I was down almost 80% when I first started (went long almost at the top of 11.8 the second time we went there). Now I'm comfortably 3x on my stack. Don't let your losses defeat you or cause you to act irrationally, that's how you lose the other 40%>

Daily RSI is flirting with a break higher. If we don't make a new low, we'll have a nice bullish RSI div. on the daily. I usually end up making worse trades when I change my plans.
I'm still in this trade from when price first hit 7.4, yawn things always take longer than I'd like.
Think back to $9.2K, think back to $11.7K. What's objectively changed since then? Nothing really.

This run was kicked off by one big whale on Kraken propping $6.4K up. The move up through $7K barrier was fueled by short squeezing.

We have simply found a temporary local bottom that lets bigger players re-load their shorts higher up. Market will continue to move down towards $5K (possibly lower) within a few days once this initial euphoria wares off and no big fundamental news arrives to keep the hope train running.

If you're an MM/large whale, why dump the market all in one go when you can make more letting it gently float up a bit before bringing the iron fist down again.

On the other hand, profit is profit and you'll always have this dilemma whenever you decide to close your short. Since you missed the sub-$7K range to close, maybe set a hard limit at ~$8K and close it then if BTC gets there?
jeez you wait until now?
Why now?
Nice trade.  Nice patience.  IMO, find a good spot and bank it.  Good luck!
Only reason I'm holding off briefly is that we're overbought on 1hr
Are they?  Just sell some of the rise.  None of this shit is scary unless you are playing with too much money.
what if i told you, being both at the right time make you double the money :O
Not getting too excited, I feel the sentiment changing a lot but there is some heavy resistance we can boumce off but its definitely looking better.
Zoom out and you’ll see a pattern bears are still very comfortable with.
Not until 7800
Crazy how it takes 48 hours to convince people that 4 months of trend has reversed. 
yeah those annoying whale cartels are everywhere!
If I had to place bets, I'd say there's a 75% chance you are correct and a 25% chance you aren't.
RemindMe! 72 hours
8000 is my maximum target for this dead cat bounce. I'll be surprised if it even gets that far.
/u/DushmanKush Well, here we are 72 hours later and pretty much just sideways for two days not below $6.3k

It's my duty to point out, you were wrong. Please stop making comments claiming to know whats next when no one truly knows...
It varies. Sometimes alts will rise in ratio as BTC/USD rises, sometimes they'll fall. Recently they've been rising, probably because of how far they've fallen in ratio overall this bubble. When BTC was last testing 11.8k they were falling in ratio.
Are you talking USD value or alt/BTC ratio?  Either way the more recent trend has been for alts to rise and fall faster than BTC but generally at the same time.

I think it would be very bullish for BTC to see the ALT/BTC ratios closer to flat or down during a positive BTC price move.  Fundamentally that would make some sense to me right now.  You are correct that happened more often in the past, but it's been quite a while.

I think about the valuation of Bitcoin in terms of new money vs inflation.  So with 1800 coins sold per day, is there enough new money at these prices to sustain this level.  In my opinion, there is obviously a lot more new money coming in than that, even at prices a good bit higher.  The problem, IMO, is that there isn't enough new money to cover the inflation on all the alts.  There has been an enourmous crypto bubble formed and bitcoin can't carry the weight of all these alts at their current prices, inflation, and most importantly their alt/btc ratios.  If those ratios get low enough it would be much easier for bitcoin to sustain a long term rally.
it means bitcoin isn't going on a bull run, rather crypto is bouncing from oversold condition overall and people are realizing there was a general overreaction on the downside (of course now there is also an overreaction on the upside lol)
Alts lost more in value and will re-gain more in value than BTC. That's why I buy alts when they look bottomed. Goal is to buy more BTC with profits then.

Bonus info: None of the top 10 alt coins will die, no matter how much some guys here hate them.
Market cycles. 

Money entering - What it's happening now.  
Bitcoin dominance rising - ALTs get sold for bitcoin to ride the climb . 

Money exiting - both fall . 

Bitcoin dominance falling - ALTs pump on BTC sideways movement.
Alts get rekt when Bitcoin goes up. Alts get rekt when Bitcoin goes down. The only time they do good is when Bitcoin goes sideways.
Alts getting nasty too. LTC shot up quick, no way this is BS in my opinion 
the sub is getting generous with the upvotes today.
ah another person who still thinks "The Intelligent Investor" is the height of market books
Any chance it is a cold storage belonging to an exchange? It has ocasional large transfers.
Bittrex cold wallet. People buying too many coins, they need to refill hot wallet for withdrawals. Bullish.
Hate to sound cliched but zoom out to the daily and the weekly.

I'm expecting another drop to around the mid 6000's and then probably that's gonna be it. I don't see us going below 6k. Not now.
Based on the macro trend and the resistance we're facing, 8.3k is less likely to come before 6.8k in my view.
doubt it, but we'll see
About 90% sure we'll see 6,800 soon. 75% sure we'll see sub 6k after failing to break 8k.
Probably sometime next week if it fails to break through the log resistance.
You're delusional if you expect institutional money to enter here while the stock market is going to the shitters. I'm sure they will advice their clients that it's a good idea to hedge in a speculative market that just crashed from ATH.

This is just another bounce on the series of dcb. 7.8k is definitely on the table here but whether we get past the resistance or not is yet to be seen. I wouldn't call the end of the bear market until we get past 70% from previous ath.
After a 4% rise you're calling an end to the bear market?
!RemindMe 90 days "did he call the bottom?"
Technically we've not retested anything. Except your patience.
They are short , that's why 
Would you please be quiet.


Yikes

This rant was brought to you by Greed
So what do you call the guys who buy in at 7k hoping that this asset goes to 20k?
if the price is staying at 7400 with shorts this high it may yet again be a pretty bullish sign. Who knows. 

Edit: To be fair though we have scrapped about 30k in shorts already. I'd expect us to hang out here for a bit while shorts accumulate before another squeeze.
...on Sunday before the priced dropped to $6,450
uhm what?
Barely any shorts closed from yesterdays movements too. I sense a big short squeeze coming. Step on the pedal until a big chunk closes.
Yeah it is crazy. The ordinary folks are gonna get burned... AGAIN...
So we dumpin?
Need to break 12k to confirm. Good luck.
will close my short in this retrace.

7.8 is a minimum i think 
Great... so You buy or short?

Foggy!!!??
Do you think we'll see $8,100 before we see $6,800?

Because that's more or less the movement we'd need to see to the upside to make a long entry here worth the risk. 

Personally, I don't see that happening. 

Opening either a short or a long in the range between $7,250 and $7,450 is probably not a very good idea. However, if you had to pick one of the two, short is less risky. But again, neither are wise.
Oh and /u/sloppysynapses /u/L14dy
I'm with the others as well. Ate a hefty plate of crow with my short, but I do still have a long from just above 6500. I'm waiting on the sidelines for now. If we near 7500, I'm considering opening a small short (equal in size to my long) just under. R/R for a short there is decent. I cannot see us plow through 7800 on one attempt, either, and waiting to short there is even better R/R. But you'd be fighting 75% of the market for that entry. That's everyone's long target close and short target entry. $7460 or $7720 would be my initial leans for short targets, depending whether you'd rather have a good entry that will probably happen or a great entry that may not (for this cycle).

Sidelines for me for now. 
The dump is most likely coming around 7.7k. It's a major resistance level and a fiblevel from our bullrun
Never wrong to consider 
I don't believe so, if it drops bellow 7100-7200 is should remain bellow. Most likely is a push upward to 7800-8000 and drop if the resistance is not broken
There doesn't have to be "new money" every time the price rebounds. 

1. Shorts taking profit
2. Existing longs increasing their positions
3. Investors who sold higher and are re-entering
4. Investors who sold lower and are fomoing back in

These groups are all contributing to the bounce.

If you can't think of a reason that someone would want to buy your bitcoin off you for $7,500, sell it. If you think it's worth more, hodl it.
Institutions.

The damn kitten is still purring
if we have higher highs -> new money was in

if lower high, no new $.
We were massively oversold. RSI needs to reset again (it has by now) before we can resume our way down.
no new money
I agree with your analysis, but I am not playing with this wave.  Wave 5s lately have been very extended or truncated.  
Unless 7200 falls we stay in the same channel, not too worrying for the bulls for now.
Not really, the real resistance is at 7.7-7.8. It's just bull weakness if we don't get past 7.4 but it can't be ruled out yet. It took a long time to get past 7.2 after many rejections. 
As someone who's macro bearish too early to tell. a retrace is to be expected from that runup but this could still have more to go. Expecting 7150/7200 support to hold if it gets there

I'm a bit surprised how well upper 7.3k is holding up.  (low volume though)

Edit: Added to a long
I mean for 2 months we have been pretty much sideways with ups and downs.  The massive bleeding was from ATH to 5.9 everything after has been consolidation with no defined trend, so hard to say which way it will turn in a big way. 
Its fakeout number 2486, bulls fall for it every-time. 
As a general rule of thumb. Assuming the fundamentals are not damaged in some way, the lower the price goes, the more likely a reversal will come.
I don't think this is _the_ reversal, but it certainly has more legs because of the amount of shorts. Our other 'reversals' had no underwater shorts to fuel a squeeze pump, now we've got more than enough for a gigantic squeeze. But most likely they'll get absorbed by the huge amount of underwater longs wanting to get out.
What would make it a fake out in your mind?  To me if it doesn't go below $6425 it's not a "fake out".  Are we talking about the same thing?

As someone who believes Bitcoin is on the right track as an entirely new asset class... digital gold... and is possibly long term very undervalued, each time the price goes lower and attempts to bottom or bounce I find it more likely to hold.  In other words each deeper bottom is more likely to be "the" bottom because fundamentally Bitcoin is cheap.

Believing that each lower low means it's more likely that no low will ever hold is more of a trap IMO.  The low for this year so far was around $6k.  The bounce from there could be seen as a trap I guess, but I think buying as close as possible to that low will probably look pretty good 18 months from now.
Sounds like selling at the bottom and buying the top to me.
It still looks great for medium term bears.  But no, not looking for 1m chart bears.
Almost 3% more of profit, of course i'm happy 
You will be surprised!!
1% ratio rise?
You said we would go below 6.5 yesterday  dunno about your predictions 
You’re all-in with a liqui at 9300?

what entry? what lev ratio?
I would have waited for 7.7 if I was you, but 7.4 should be good with those stops.
they always know
use 5 layered order 
Unless you're trying to quick scalp a trade, always set your limit orders several dollars off the mark. 
You get liquidated when the exchange sees that you are at risk of not being able to pay back what you borrowed from them (the 7.5 ETH). For a 4x short, this would occur after a 25% price rise minus maintenance margin. Don't margin trade if you don't know exactly what you are doing, start off with unleveraged trading.
No. But explain your thought
"kicked I'm from the USA"

you mean picked right? You used a VPN and ended up selecting USA anyway? 
Do you know that you risk loosing your trading stack if you get caugth with no recourse ? Same thing with bitmex. 

Use Gdax, Kraken, Gemini or Polo
You’re fine. Just keep your VPN on and you won’t have an issue. I accidentally logged on without one and didn’t get banned or anything.. I did end up losing a lot of money on there , but it wasnt from accessing the site from the US.

Edit: sorry I thought you were talking about bitmex, never used finex.
I can’t find anything from the 4th or the 3rd.  Granted,  I’m on my phone right now, but links aren’t showing up on Google.  

Really what my question is, is why is the sentiment so much different now than in February with regards to price?  It seems counterintuitive that the price would potentially drop to half what it was when literally every single “headline” was either negative or clearly manipulated or misconstrued to appear as negative.  

I understand there is a lot of objective evidence with TA, but the common sense answer doesn’t match up with that.  Maybe that’s my issue.
Go back and look, the daily threads still exist.
IIRC, a lot of people were predicting a bounce from 7.2 or 7.4. Peter Brandt predicted that that point would hold or we would hit 5k, I think
By half I mean the 3k-ish prices that have been thrown around for the two or three days prior to Sunday’s bounce.
Yes which is why you need to hedge before you short to retain fiat value. 

if you have 1 BTC and you want to short worth 1 BTC then you hedge with 7300 contracts. Subtract another 7300 contracts.

Your position would be short 14600 contracts and you would be 2x short from here. technically 2x, but really, you only make money off of the second 7300 contracts.

The other 7300 are just to retain value.

If you are not constantly short 1x on bitmex then you're not flat- you're long.
In bear markets the alts seem to decay when BTC isn't moving.
They're all directly impacted by BTC's movements. I wouldn't put much stock in it. 
Seems like a DCB to me, not accumulation.
Serious question: How would you differentiate the order flow of slow accumulation as you perceive it from hypothetical slow distribution?
For accumulation there needs to be buying, there is no bull volume 
How does a 70% correction remind you of a ~40% correction? 🧐

Would've been more like sub $500 than $700 back then 
What happened to you being the biggest bear on the planet?
Ok, I'll allow it.
kinda completely invalidated
Looks nothing like it.
Que? He completely misjudged it. No hard feelings, predicting this market is hard. But can't see how it even remotely resembles what's happened in the market now.
The market has needed **very little** in the way of incentive to dump to new local lows.

Breaking down from this rising wedge could very easily drop the market below $6,400 ultimately. 

I'll likely get out of the market's way if the wedge breaks down.
If it breaks down I'm looking at 1500% profit on my 7k short. No reason why it would breakdown then for no reason at all bounce hard off 7k. If 7.0 is worth buying then 7.4 should have plenty of buyers to stop a capitulation breakdown. 
First of all, if its your first time trading it's pretty hard to recommend starting here. The current market is extremely unpredictable and even most seasoned traders are having a lot of difficulty trading it.

If you still think you are willing to trade, I would wait for confirmation of a breakdown from our current rising wedge. If it gets convincingly rejected from the 7450-7500 range, you may have a relatively safe short entry. BUT, this is just my read and you should go with your intuition and make sure you have a good exit plan if things go wrong.
if you zoom out it looks like a terrible place imho.
You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.
we also had our V\-Bottom at 6k. 
Very. 

The $1,160 to $200 downtrend reversed off of a triple bottom. 
Too early to say.
That would be 50% of the population. 
If you are a passive investor, you don't deverse to get rewarded.

I still think that a "weak hand" is someone that didn't sell above 10k.
Not a bad spot necessarily, although there's still a pretty high probability that buyers are fucked here.

Unfortunately though, rising wedges have a habit of getting worse before they get better for those selling into buying pressure on the way up. So you probably made the right call for now. 
Flair checks out.
An alternative count is that we are in the middle of a "C" wave, which is part of the ABC wave that started from 19.8k. "B" wave being the corrective rally from 6k to 11.7k. 
you circled spiky lines; I believe spiky lines will continue on into the far future but I'm confused how this helps anything
[deleted]
Not sure, all depends if that 7240 level holds or not
I am thinking we pullback to 7150–7250 area at best.  4 hr looks bullish.   
If its like yesterday night it wont pass 7280. Going sideways till the channel support line is reached for another leg up.
If 7280 breaks than a test @7200 should happen. 
Anyway i closed my long @7315 because i can't babysit the charts at work and waiting for 7400 to break up or a break from 7200 either way to decide my next move.
Paint ze bull flag an zen damp it.
Support. If its underneath you it's support. 
9 out of 10 times I get trapped when I place an order before going to bed. :/
No fomo
Isn't it so much better when it's going up? I wish I wasn't so busy so I could just watch the charts and think about adding to my position!
I see what ur doing here ;)
Look I agree with you, but the way you're posting lately has me thinking you might be breathing a bit too much of your own fumes. I actually do have friends who run crypto trading firms that confirm there is currently large buying activity OTC (yes, billions even). All information is useful.

Haha you've been all inning since the 6Ks, are you actually doing these trades? :)))

That's why I never use round number, even in moments like that. I'm sorry for that bad luck

Layer in with multiple orders in a ladder next time.
Someone had a 2k BTC buy wall at exactly 5250, probably why it didn't hit :)
careful, might sag to 7.2 over the next few hours before heading to 7.7k. Stops?
Why FOMO now? FOMO at 7500 if we get there
Buying here is bad. We're right under a number of potential resistances, and we aren't making any moves on them right now. Wait for a more convincing break through $7400 (that's only like $100-150 lost per coin from here anyway), on the short term technical support (somewhere around $7100ish) or short term psychological support ($7000); or wait for the knives to fall somewhere in $6000. Definitely not a buy spot, this.

edit: for the bulls, not a sell spot either, this, if you're in position already. Sell if $7100/$7000 breaks ($7200 if you have PTSD), or take profits somewhere quite a bit higher than here. 
Username checks out
I’m def not buying here. Still think we have to make new lows 
Let's play it Bulls like you did when employing peak Jordan!!! ;)
I wouldn't listen to most people here. People base their advice to fit their own narrative. Listen to your gut and remember profit is profit especially in these volatile conditions.
Waitttttttt

Sustainable. You'll regret selling unless you are unwinding a profitable, leveraged long.
you are a whale. you dropped btc mc by $128M (8$*16M)
Seems most everyone agrees it's a no man's land for trading rn
I'd say less than that, the entire crypto market is still rising.

What I have noticed is that there are ALOT more profit takers in BTC, compared to the other big cryptos.

The small dips we see in BTC, aren't there on other charts but once that's done and if the alts are still rising. BTC tends to follow.

because you say so? 
Fully convinced this is a larp now, you've had like like 5 posts a day DCAing into a short in the 7s and then into the 6s either 50% of stack or all in, somehow you're still at an entry of 7.8k. 
if we fall below $7.2k I have a feeling it was just a retrace. Remember $6450 to $7400 is 15%. That's a pretty decent retrace.

But there's a sort of double bottom at $6450 and $6550 with a neckline at ~$7200 that would mean a target of $8k. 
My avg entry is now 7400. Hurts I did not close it at 6400 but that's greed for you. Time to man up now and close some of it to have more bullets to reshort higher. Plus I rather use limits to close here than to be reactive, use a stop and lose another few %. 
Coffee is breakfast.

Nothing wrong with Nespresso. Snob. 😠
Downvoted you here, not because you are right or wrong, but because you have no arguments but a gut feeling here :/

Also I hesitate between shorting and longing and you didn't help me :)

Why not both...
THIS IS THE LAST CHANCE EVER TO BUY BITCOIN AT Bitcoin.CurrentPrice 



yall are some fucking bots man i heard this so many times
Heading back down to sub $7000 levels would not be a vote of confidence to investors, it'd be yet another confirmation to scalpers that you should indeed not go long but just look to short every bounce instead, imo. We have to stay above $7000 ($7200 even, ideally) for any kind of confidence to return, I think.

edit: I've been long since $6500 (and mocked by the bears for it, uh oh...) but I have stops just under $7200 and I would be much more inclined to short $6900 than re-enter a long at any subsequent low if we did go back down there.

How many times do you need it to bounce before you want it to sail? 
How many times do we need to go below 7k to gain confidence?? Why do we need to one more time? Isn’t it enough already? 
The first week of February was an interesting week. Managed to buy in at 6.1k, I wish I had bought more but I only bought $100 worth.
So ... if you bet... Go short then!!

But, be sure you got $$ to cover.


I agree with this logic. We went from 7.3k to 9200

Now we can easily go from 6450 to 8500

If we don’t make it to 8500 within the next week, I anticipate 6k to fall with conviction
Or some delicious news like “ Prince rises from the dead and makes a super bowl half time debut with his new song release “ I rise with bitcoin “ 
you know its coming
Looking at something similar

https://www.tradingview.com/x/50JoYZyX
Long on futures short spot? Or?
it was never their corn to begin with, they borrowed it
Given current channel and estimating that the bigger resistance point should be around 7800, i say 14 hours before the clash. 
It will already be below 7400 tommorow, if not in a few hours.
Has just began LOL
Your wish. 
Not going to happen now.

They want your cheap coins.

mr know it all.....pffff.... all the bullshit on this forum....
"Bears here are delusional. They have been smacked down more times than they can count the past few months, but still with each little retrace they declare the pain to be over. Watch this one go to $19.2k only to pump hard again (I expect $24k at first, and then well above $30k).

This bull market has just begun."


Not saying the bear market is over, just that youre full of shit.

Just remember it doesn't only go down- it's funny because the amount of people convinced this is a fakeout is very high compared to the other run-ups we had. 

Only a few people here seemed to realize the pumps were fake last time but these bubble pops don't just go down forever. 

A low below $6k would have confirmed that this thing is just going to goblin town quickly but we managed to stay above and break the double bottom neckline at $7.3k. I'd be careful about assuming this won't go higher for a bit
Part of me is actually kind of hoping for that. I'll just keep buying and lowering my average entry price.

"Cheap coinz! om nom nom"
That is not Mt gox wallet you ass. That's an exchange cold storage being transferred to hot storage due to high demand. Someone shorted his mortgage it seems.
Not Mt Gox but an internal Bittrex* tx I think

No activity on Mt Gox lately
https://www.cryptoground.com/mtgox-cold-wallet-monitor/
Gox coins are stored in lots of 2k on different addresses, will post a link to the list when I'm done with work.
Liar. Dude is just trying to make up for his underwater short. 

No Gox BTC has moved: https://www.cryptoground.com/mtgox-cold-wallet-monitor/
Not Gox wallet.

Saw this FUD circulated in every crypto community I'm in today, someone's short starting to feel uncomfortable or what?
...with a fee of $0.30
It'll be used as equity on a big ass leveraged long ;) ;)
oh god no
Damn you lads are quick
> Facebook group

LOL
this was rumored to be Mt Gox earlier which was proven to be wrong. don't know about the rest
Can confirm (I'm that whale)

and so is my mate Baz
Look, if someone wanted to sell 10k btc, the easiest way would be OTC, where they wont' encounter massive slippage on the price. This just sounds like nonsense. 
Rumor validated. Its true. Source: Whale.
If you were looking to offload $75,000,000 of BTC, would you do that on an exchange (and risk inevitable slippage), or over the counter?

There is your answer.
Exchange wallet, cold storage transferred to hot wallet due to high demand. It was not from the Mt. Gox wallet which are constantly monitored.
Heard a rumor that rumor was false, and that it was a Bittrex address.  But I have no source/proof to provide right now, so take that fwiw.

EDIT: A Bittrex cold storage wallet, just to be clear. 
I hope this going up will break the resistance upward
agree entirely my duder, i am opening a hedge short here and will make a big short at 7.7-8k.  but i mean it’s not just shrimp, plenty of stupid whales that will end up buying the top
> 1m

Lmao what
It should not go above 7550, but yes, i think its close.
I see no walls in particular, seems normal.
how much money did you make following your predictions? 
How can you squeeze money from a "hodler"?
This is gold. 
What happens after that? 
I take it that you're going to all in short 10x at 7.8 then 
> Bitcoin always knocks three times before coming through the door.

Every time I read someone saying this it turns out to be bullshit.
RemindMe! 1 month
Knock knock knock 11.8 - buyers aren't home. 

Knock knock knock 9.2 - buyers aren't home

Knock knock 7.5...  knock .. Ruh roh 

A general rule of thumb is about 3 tests of resistance before it's broken so it's actually completely normal. 
don't fomo in when it hits 10k
Just a giant dick tease. Until it actually happens 
There was a fuckton of spoofing involved, thats why. 
Agreed, I'm bracing for a drop if it keeps failing. Not a safe place to buy imho. (Even though I just dropped 4k on BNB).
yes it is you.
Old news

Wow such desperate!
Old new tho

You sure are a lucky guy, huh?
What u talking about
I don't know why or how people take an idiot named MagicPoopCannon seriously. It's probably a damn kid 
I'd like that June futures long to hold tight up to our ATH resistance line if we get there. I'm actually debating opening a separate long position (swaps) to scalp a push to 7700ish, which is where I expect heavy profit taking/new shorts to get serious. I should have done so under $7300 this morning if I was going to. This close to $7400 is terrible r/r for a long. Trying not to overthink or overtrade right now, though.  

I was on the trollbox last night when some whale dropped a $5M market buy around $7050 on top of his $13M position at $6850. Should have bailed right then lol
Reason? Arguments? Anything of interest for this sub for once, instead of pure hope based on nothing? Do you even trade?
$8K soon? I kind of doubt that. 7500 will reject us, as will 7700, 7800, and 8000. How far and how hard we're rejected will determine how long it takes to retry (if we retry) or if 7800 (or 7500) will be the new lower high on our trip to <$6K.
I almost wish I hadn't included that portion.

Look, $6,400 marks the 3rd or 4th "bottom" since $11,700 where one could have made the claim, "this could very well be the beginning of the end of the bear market."

There's nothing more compelling about this bounce than any of the previous bounces. Actually, the bounce off $7,300 that made it to $9,200 was far more compelling than the current one. 

"this could be the beginning of the end of the bear market" in the same way that "this lottery ticket could be the one that solves all of my financial problems!"

I'm saying *there's a chance*. But I wouldn't mortgage my house and go long on bitcoin here. 

I wouldn't do that ever, of course. But I really wouldn't say the bear market is officially behind us until $12,000+ honestly. 

I'd put like 100 asterisks and disclaimers around *might* there. 

Yes, the market *could* be done with the decline. However, we won't even have the beginnings of confirmation of that fact until $7,800 breaks to the upside. And again, that's just the **first** step of many important resistance zones that need to be overcome on the way to total confirmation that the bear market is behind us. 

The recovery will be resting on the edge of a knife pretty much for as long as it continues. 

$7,800 to $8,100 is a minefield. 

$8,100 to $9,000 is a clusterfuck

$9,000 to $10,000 should be next to impossible (especially if there isn't any significant pullback between $7,800 and $9,000). 

And EVEN IF the market breaks $10,000, that log resistance line will most likely be absolutely HAMMERED upon after it breaks. And since it's gradually declining, that's going to be a really tough breakout to trade. 

For example, the market could break out at $9,500, rise to $11,700 and then collapse back to $9,000 in the span of a few weeks. All while still technically maintaining as a "confirmed breakout" above the log resistance line.
Well, if you follow my commentary it actually shouldn't be *that* surprising that I'm a bit bullish here.

Generally speaking, I try to flow with the market and avoid maintaining a strong bias in either direction. 

I've gotten caught longing the top more than a few times between $11,700 and $6,400 as the market telegraphs a recovery that ultimately failed to materialize. I've also caught a few falling knives in the process as well (notably the bounce from $7,300 to $9,200. 

The market is bullish in the short term, so I'm bullish in the short term. 

If the market collapses at any point between now and $10,000 and resumes it's bearish decline, then my sentiment will shift as well.
If we reverse this quarter, it will be now

If we do break log resistance this run without going below 6500, then I am confident we will go up.

If any run fails significantly, I anticipate a new low
I'd imagine I've said the same thing on several occasions between $11,700 and $6,400. 

And it's just as true now as it was then. 

"the beginning of the end" is only going to be visible in hindsight. There will come a point in time where everyone will be looking in the rearview mirror and thinking, "damn, I wish I'd opened a long two weeks ago." 

Just as "the beginning of the end" of the bull trap from $6,000 to $11,700 wasn't verifiable until like $9,300. We all would have killed for shorts between $11,000 and $11,700, but at the time it was far too risky to do so. 

All one can really say about this recovery is that it shows some promise. A price point that was serving as resistance has been overcome in the short term. We'll know more in the next 24 to 48 hours as to whether this is just another flash-in-the-pan nothing burger or if there's some more significant momentum behind this push. 
Definitely true. 

My alarms went off, but by the time I checked my position on Bitmex the market was already recovering. 

It's a mixed bag though. Had the market continued to plummet, I might not have been able to exit until $6,600 to $6,800. 
I would avoid opening any position within the confines of a continuation pattern. It's just not worth the risk to short (or long) between $7,250 and $7,450. 

If the market can clear $7,500 or so, it should make a strong move to $7,800 and rekt any high-leveraged short position in this range. 

If it drops below $7,250, then $7,000 to $6,800 become viable targets. 

But ya, the risk is actually quite high for a short here.
Any investor that got in late last year or early this year and in the red but stayed have become that much wiser now. However my only concern is it might be that much difficult now to reach or exceed previous ATH because people now know they can't be too greedy and begin taking profits sooner. The next bull cycle will be interesting.
Sometimes sure.  But i mean there is so much negativity when btc goes down.   Or hate. Or trolling. Or people basically making fun other peoples trades.     Thats not how it should be.   And in all sure sometimes we get 3k comments. But that doesnt mean each comment represents a different individual nor does it mean that this is enough of a sample to represent the majority sentiment.     Sometimes i see a fine post here and there.   Lots of room for improvement here 
This, exactly.

This sub (specifically the daily) has become quite a good contrary indicator.  I don't trade on it alone, but it works as a reliable confirmation of other signals.
I earned a bit from listening to some people here, but only a few selected ones :D
Specially when i'm in a position and Chewy enters the same position, every time that happens it works out. Even when its against all odds like yesterday's long from @7000. It got beaten to death but stood firmly before knocking bears out for a while.

And lost out on opportunities    Preach

I agree! 
Yesterday was the first time I closed an indecisive position due to sentiment here and *didn't* soon regret it.  If I hadn't scaled out, I would have eaten a shitty SL over night.

Though this time we were also already broken out of all the bearish formations I was watching (except for the pennant/flag on the 1D that was still valid at that time), so it wasn't fully indecisive, just hanging by a thread.
Its okay you arent the only one.   We are human.  Its insane how much just chatter alone can affect us all.  
+1 
I'm guessing increased volatility as eventually these folks will open up a ton of longs when they think the bottom is in, and also likely get rekt. Could see an accumulation period with a WIDE range. 

In the short term, thinking of the craze, BTC still had a good bit of distance to go when everybody was getting into it before the crash. Everybody shorting means they're also not interested in buying at these prices. They may be forced to at various points via liquidation but they're not looking to put their full stack in yet. I think this will keep rises and runups from truly catching.

Who knows, we could see a crash, a quick overleveraged long rebound, and then another crash when those longs get squeezed.

Basically we just turned up the pressure in the pressure cooker.
spot on, I am also very curious about how it will play out. one question I'm now asking is, for the people who are newish and who are shorting, (the chad yolo shorters), if there is a reversal, will they start longing or are many of them net-bearish on BTC as a whole and will exit the market entirely. sooo many variables and possible outcomes, but fun to speculate. 

edit: /u/jarederaj and I were talking about these net-bearish people not long ago
that said, alts still pumped for a while when the herd discovered them

people getting into shorting also means the herd is not interested in making big buys right now
Do me and you work at same place? My coworker as well 
That's just where the indicators indicate. upper 8k tho.
It can break those levels of course.
yeah, frankly the way the price of BTC has crashed, its going to need at least a few months of consolidation in one range, before its ready to go up again.

now when you see the $7-8K range play out non stop for 2-3 months...then you can start betting on it going up. Any fast moves up will go down just as fast on the next round of dumping 
People were calling reversal at 7k lol. We're still only at 7.5, and ~8k is the top of the current downward channel.

I mean, it could be the start of a reversal? But I genuinely feel bad for all these people who are getting their hopes up so easily. I really don't think a double bottom is plausible. This is probably just some whales exploiting n00bish double bottom hope before they drop it again.
Yep it could dump back to 7.1 and still be "the" reversal. I just wonder how quickly sentiment will turn when the inevitable BRD appears. 
Give this man gold
I Guess you could thank me for setting the new local high there 🤷🏽‍♂️ wiped out quite the bit of my local profit, and it really hurts to see my tether value dropping earlier when bitcoin rose all the way up from 6.9k, and I bought in at 7.5k
One time i canceled my stop loss because i thought it would go my way so i wouldn't take the 2%loss. Ended up losing 30% of my whole stack instead of 2% on 20% of my stack... 
depends on where and when you put them.  They're great for locking in profits.
I stopped putting stop losses after getting slaughtered by some chop after selling right under 10k
Yeah on Binance lol I literally bought the local high, I put stop limit at 7520 because I thought it would be a decent place to enter already if it indeed pushed through 7.5k 
Yeah haha
Thanks! Though I'm still taking a long break. Just popped in to say hi :)
Good point. Of course it comes down to how much leverage you are using above all else. If you are using heavy leverage, you better not be married to positions often, because you won't be able to afford patience. If you are using low leverage, it is often advantageous to marry your position in a sense and be patient.
This is a very volatile market with large swings, better take profits some times and not figth the trend.
He's a bot
Me too. I picture him being driven around in the back of Maybach posting here on reddit in between meetings for multi million business matters completely unrelated to crypto.
I always imagined /u/_chewtoy_ to be a guy sitting in a bean bag with a laptop wearing a chewbacca costume with nerdy glasses on.

I should probably cut back on the DMT.
Ha, I'm a bit militant about my privacy, so I apologize but I won't describe myself here.
Creep
I've always imagined him as a large St. Bernard or something
ja. why
didnt theprice dip like 600 bucks though?
>wait, you held your long all the way down to 6450?

Yep. Stops of 10% would have hit around $6300. 

>Also, what leverage ratio? Even at 10x that still means you had 220k in BTC on BitMex.  Didn’t know people felt comfortable depositing that many coins to an exchange to trade with

10x. I have much more than that on Bitmex, being used to hedge my cold storage position. 
Yeah, it's one thing to ask for advice, but to advertise a liquidation price is just asking for it. Poor guy. Hope others learn from this life-changing lesson (srsly 60% of life[?] savings at high leverage...)
Nope. This figure includes those claiming a capital loss to offset future capital gains.
Maybe none of them have sold. Personally, I don't see any point in selling before holding for at least one year. Why not wait it out and only pay the long-term capital gain tax? This is especially true for people in higher income brackets. Why would you want to pay 30-40 percent of gains in taxes when you can just pay 15-18 percent? Plus, strictly by the numbers, you probably get a bigger gain. That's why I basically treat trading like a roulette wheel that spins 24-7 and just forget about the rest of my hodlings like I do my retirement accounts.
False. You need to report your purchases so they can be referenced when you do sell.
> That's one for every 5 million.

Wut?
>That's one for every 5 million.

No, 0.04% is one for every 2500. So they received around 100 for crypto. 
I'm guessing a lot of people sitting on gains so they are waiting until it is close to the filing date to pay their taxes. I would imagine people getting a refund will file sooner.

You mean the line should touch the candles, not the wicks? Which line are you calling the first?
Hah, yeah, I made a brain fart there. The lines are sloping down, so the numbers will decrease over time. Correcting...
A thousand times this. As awesome as it'd be if true, I really can't see any reason to believe this man. People see a verified tick on Twitter and assume "this guy knows what he's on about" I guess.

Keep in mind it's very much in this man's interests in Bitcoin continuing to be relevant for the sake of his work. 
Unless he is just saying what he saw and really did see several multi billion in *asks*, and we should all be afraid of the coming OTC dump /s
If he were lying/intentionally spreading hopium not based on truth, don’t you think he would have taken the time to learn the difference between bids and asks? The confusion of the terms actually makes me believe him more lol 
[Corroborated by Eric Meltzer](https://twitter.com/wheatpond/status/980953916572659713), who I think is more reputable (he does the [Proof of Work Newsletter](http://proofofwork.news/)). Meltzer [tweeted about this recently](https://twitter.com/wheatpond/status/978397371439767552) as well. Doesn't prove the OTC interest is *serious*, of course.
But Charlie Shrem confirmed it on his a Twitter. Shrem knows helluva lot about the market.
Yeah, they’ve been there for a while too. Sometimes wonder if most of them aren’t just orphaned orders put there by one high-as-a-kite rich dude. I just picture the guy, back in the heady days of mid-December during the height of the mania, going full-retard, gleefully clicking orders all up into the stratosphere from 76k to a million bucks … before his final cocaine binge took a frightful turn for the worse...  
Or they adjusted their bots to be less suspicious (load tinfoil hat)
Yep, that's why I use 2 exchanges for that :)
He probably meant this: https://imgur.com/a/YYpQT

(forgive all the noise from the other lines... lots of lines)
Wasn't stated explicitly but I think he's more or less saying that he doesn't think the next post-red-circle green candle will come.
I wanted to make sure I got my entry. We'll see how this goes, though. Turns out 7510 would have executed, so you're right on that.
Ascending wedge changed my mind. It does look poised to break above 7500, though. I probably wouldn't be taking this position without my long.
It wouldn't help his memory much.
Was just saying that felt a little different to me, wasn't just one mega pump... Was a few jumps separated in time without much pullback, and it crested some resistance points it had trouble cracking on its earlier bounces. The other pumps smelled like fake outs to me, but this one didn't. 
You're gonna lose a lot at first when trading. No one learns by winning a bunch at first, they'll just lose it all in the end. Beginner's luck is terrible.

If you're giving up because it's too exhausting then good- stay away, it's not worth it. If you're giving up because you think you'll never be profitable, then realize that even really great traders start out losing a bunch at first.
I was just giving my gut reaction to this one... it felt a bit different from the other pumps to me.  I mean I definitely wouldn't be surprised if it continued the trend and dumped, but for whatever reason this one felt like ti might have some more staying power.
Entry was 5x at 7k, closed out 75% between 7.6-7.8 so it's just a small amount riding. Liq not until 8.5 or so
Ha ha, I'm a permabull too, hence I only do long trades. When bears come in I sit in Fiat and then BTFD and STFR.
3k?. are we at 3K?
Well, predicting something and claiming to know 100% are two different things:

"a thing predicted; a forecast" - A weather forecast isn't taken as gospel right?

glad you find it awesome though :)
He isn't the smartest person ever so it's not really fair to talk about him, it's shocking how many of these people there are a lot are from buttcoin people 
so what? Do you think soy bean traders or coppper traders knows the chemical properties of those substances / metals ? 
Unless I’m reading you wrong I make BTC +680% YTD
When global market take a hit. People play it safe. They pull the money out of crypto.
You paid to protect your investment, there's value to that.
Agreed, i have a stop loss not too far from here. Testing 7.6 is very reasonable. 
7.25 was resistance. 7.3 doesn't provide any big resistance. It's an area for profit takers (longs) and scalp shorters. Ultimately there is a big volume gap here and above us and 7.8 will be the first real resistance. I've longed pre breakout and target 7.8-8. to exit my position and see what the market decides it wants to do.
I'm confused. Your "word on the street" sentiment is from December? Haha how does that help us now? 
What value does Bitcoin offer at 'less than $3000'? Why that number, specifically?
3K was the bottom in Sept during the week or two of China FUD, I can't see that BTC has less perceived value than it did then, it must have more, even if its just a little, due to a small amount of increased adoption and LN ect..?
>The primary reason is that the market has not undergone adequate price discovery in the area between $1,160 and $6,000.

But we spent 10 months of 2017 within that exact range with very hard fought battles to break 3k and 5k, each preceded by a major crash. If anything we went very slowly through that range (by Bitcoin standards) and experienced excellent price discovery with prior tests of $1800 $3000 and $5600. 

The fact that we had as many pullbacks on the way up in 2017 is what really baffles me about all the bears calling for sub 3k coins when really everything under 7k has already been pretty well tread and tested.
Going with your strong hand, weak hand theory. Could you not argue that strong hands could make up a much higher percentage of investors than the average asset class?

I mean "HODL" mentality aside, I personally view Bitcoin as one of the greatest technological advancements of our time (albeit one of many in the past 20 years) and I believe that as time goes on it will truly become digital gold (or more depending on 2nd layer solutions).

Given that although I didn't buy any at 20k, if I did I think my only action would be to buy the dip and wait (from a long term standpoint, of course I will trade differently). I can't imagine there are not MANY folks like this out there. My point being that if a long term holder was going to sell (a "weak hand") they would have done so long before 6k... accepting -70% is not much different than -90%...

I like the mental model you laid out don't get me wrong but I have been openly bullish here in the 6000s and I don't see reason to not buy anything below 6800. Yes it may dip below 5800 but I would only also consider that to be more valuable.... low 6k/high 5k feels like the point where the strong hands DCA like madmen... 



Great post. Very informative, Chew, thank you. 
Agree , alts are down like 80-90% sounds like a capitulation to me 
This. It prevents sustained downward pressure on the price during a market recovery.
I think most traders can agree that we're dealing with a very skittish market.  That doesn't necessarily mean that we're going to be testing lower lows NOR higher highs over the next few days though.  All it means is that the movements will be exacerbated - something we're all used to in crypto by now.  
The CEO of Bitcorn duh.
The house is the actual house in Seattle the Bittrex servers are stored in.
Bitfinex, cme futures, Bitcoin, take your pick.
probably the MMs/market itself, I guess? I don't get why he's saying "don't bet repeatedly against the house" because he's making it sound like BTC going up forever is the house's intention
Turning a bit optimistic but koreans love fomo ;)
A hong Kong exchange lowered its deposit fee from 2.5% to 0% in March, says a lot about the volume. 
maybe the wall street bonuses hitting the market
I couldn't agree more, [its very obvious if you know what to look for](http://www.mitchfrench.com/IMAGES/dragonhead.jpg) 
yeah, so what's an organic market then
Thats part of the fun
because that's the textbook bubble pop process. you know this 😋 


Because some people need more time to sell, some less. Every movement down shocks some people into selling into the next rise. This mechanism can only be stopped gradually. Source: thin air.
wHy NoT jUsT wRiTe LiKe ThIs... Your capitalisation is deterring :)
A little of both, to be honest :P

I have a few midterm longs that I'm confident about. What I'm cautious about right now is a long that I have on the June Futures. I'm at breakeven in $7600, but I'm hoping that the June Futures close above $10k. The rest of my longs, can hold indefinitely so long as the price doesn't venture south of $6k
From what I've read hidden bear divergences are still valid in consolidation phases, doesn't have to be taken from a local high. Although it may be stronger at a local high.
If you're telling me that a lot of shorts are being opened and we're still at 7400, I don't know what to tell you beyond that shorts should be moderately concerned. 
[deleted]
Don't forget your stop loss.
Don't waste your time in this thread. 

A lot of alt coin refugees came here in the last 2 weeks. 

This isn't the btc market that it used to be (not an og been here since sept 17), don't take any real trading advice from this sub.


Not really given that it's 48 hours on and there's now $400 worth of better entry points.
Ha. Recently you're no better.
I'm not overhyped, but there's no denying that right now 7k is a shitty entry point for a short.
That three-month dump is what's making me optimistic. There is a limited (shrinking, actually, in terms of what's available on market) supply of Bitcoin. These guys are bound to run out of coins at some point and will even have to cover if they've borrowed any.
Well the lower the price we bounce off the most likely it is we bounced off the true bottom. This one had some decent volume and follow through so far for 3 days. 
I've taken plenty of profits since shorting 10.8 a month ago. I'm only down profits right now. 
Yeah looks like the fractal predicted a bounce. I should have followed it more closely and closed my short at 6.4 but I would have reopened at 7-7.2 already. 
Aren’t many of the longs on BFX unleveraged? 
I use Cash to add.




Chances are it lands in between everyone's predictions, 3-5k is most likely too low, 6-7k being the low is looking more realistic by the day
Making up percentages is fun for the whole family!
Yeah you nailed it, people do not realize that this is exactly how $3k happens. It's not a capitulation wick. It's a slow bleed over time with bounces that restore faith and then destroy just a little bit more than was restored every time. People get frustrated and leave because they're tired of being faked out. 


So, we must do the opposite. Of what? I would call this move a Kramer, it comes shooting in and breaks your door, then eats all your food
Very very loooong back https://www.tradingview.com/x/qw34UyLn

It is not super accurate by any means, and when I see it now I guess i could raise it a bit, but it's just on my chart since a while
downvotes here are used to express anger at legitimate observations 
[removed]
OK, long it is. Maybe I'll fill one of your sells at > $8k!

(edit : that made no sense. I'll be selling then too)
Perma bears never give up. They sure are dedicated.
Don't bear runs usually end up with months of stagnation / side ways ?

100% will. this whole trade was a cluster fuck of mistakes. hoping to get it over and done with
I don't think it's going to break down so soon. It's a pretty steep wedge, but the lines don't meet until ~8.6k on my chart.

A break down at 7.8k would make sense, coinciding with support turned resistance.
Has anyone here sold for tax reasons? I haven't seen literally anyone mention it. I feel like I'd have seen someone mention it by now. 
Agree with you. 

This is a huge consideration for both individuals & corporations. 

It's the different between solvency & bankruptcy.
I was in below 7k during this recent dip because I anticipated DCB after oversold conditions. My FOMO would be to remove my limit sells as we move up higher in the 7ks. 
I went in at 7k. I do not think this is a dead cat bounce.
Thanks. Long term still bullish as ever, but I do think bitcoin continues to follow boom and bust patterns, and the market will continue to be speculative as long as noobs who don't understand the technology and the tools it provides continues to throw money at it only as a means to get more fiat out. 

I don't think the bear market will last nearly as long as 2014-2015 because dynamics and urgency to acquire stakes in the tech are ramping up, but this shit show is not over. Not like this. 

I'm waiting for a full onslaught of totally manipulated positive hype in the news sectors and Wall Street before I know the bull is on again. 
As someone who just made a pretty bad trade by deviating from the plan, stick to the plan.
DCB just means the price is eventually going lower despite a strong bounce. It doesn't mean it's a dead technology 
Pardon my terminology if that is incorrect. What I meant is since this is a bear market (I think it still is) you gotta sell the pumps until there is a clear reversal. 
> More spectators, more investors, and the other variables I discussed could speed up the typical market cycle time exponentially.

All the things you mentioned actually slow down the market cycle time, not speed it up.
I agree. It's a shame that the ATH was pumped so high that we now have an enormous range of uncertainty to deal with.
It's not official yet. I'd love for it to be, but wouldn't be surprised to hang around $5K to 8K until August. 
Definitely not a certainty. 
Your last sentence lost you all of your credibility. What in the world gave you the idea that 3-4k is "almost a certainty?" 
I mean ya, for now. It won't be super relaxing if it suddenly dumps below $7,250.
about to give birth I'm assuming
$7,450 was the resistance point. It's broken upward.

But the market hasn't moved up substantially since the breakout.

It's a bit disconcerting.
I really have no idea whether this was a fantastic exit or a premature one. 

Buyers may very well have pulled a Leroy Jenkins here and could realize at any moment that there's nobody behind them.
Not to mention that this entire rally has been done on poor volume. 
Your 4% is now 4.2%...
What is your problem.
If people are sure we go further Up.... .About time
Was that 5 days ago?
Honestly were getting close. u/binary-echoes has given up it seems. Just need a few more of the perma bulls in here to give up lol. 
Yes, there is some truth to this actually, but dumb money was buying Altcoins in December but that bubble still went on for another month. So... Just because there is dumb money shorting bitcoin doens't mean it can't go on for a while longer. There is a larger supply of "dumb money" than you think!
[removed]
I posted when we were around 6.5k that I was bullish in the short term because of it. 

edit: Oh and I should mention most people tried to rebuke me because they are dumb and think the price is going straight down. I am a truly enlightened trader, with 0 biases. It took me 10 years of meditation and prop trading books to get here. I am the chosen one.
I see it as 2 bubbles but that’s why I said who knows if we are on the brink of another bubble. 
Part of me believes their posted TA is contrarian to their actual trading positions.
Yeah not a fan of those two.
He said he loved me too. Bitch.
What's your target?
Interesting, how do you measure this ? Because on BFX; there is also a lot of other interesting pairs with action right now. Like EOSETH, XRPBTC,  or BTCBCH 
ETH has been brutalized on this bear turn.  I don't think it's going down much more, so hopefully you aren't shorting it for long. 
Check again... 
I want nothing more than  the bear market to end but it's nothing right now other than a bit of light relief.

Just as many times before, even this year alone, we could very well climb to 8k or 8.5k..most people get all hyped and the  we bleed down again. Back into the 7s and we repeat our most recent cycle.

Short memories lead to small wallets 
It's madness. I guarantee that if we do get to 7800 this place will be full of FOMO posts. Heaven forbid we break above 8k it'll be insanity in here. 

I'm for a bit of FOMO...but only when it's deserved. Now should this run keep going and break 10k and then 11k, well yea i'll be very excited. Right now, sitting at the grand old price of 7350 and a 4% rise through the night, no.. no excitement just a bit of hope.

Well at least everyone on ethtrader can be happy eth is finally decoupled from Bitcoin lol
bummer...i was thinking of longing ETH/BTC ratio...
On stamp it broke down for a few minutes as I had it drawn. Oh well. 
Bitcoin skeptic said bearish? Meaningless.
Posts talking negatively about bullish posts getting upvoted and bearish posts getting downvoted? Bullish.
I need more than metacommentary on this subs sentiment.

All you fuckers, stop being sentiment indicators and explain your positions.
I disagree.. but not calling this a reversal just yet either..
I thought it was because it was using bitcoin's test net and so the price movements there could be a all over the place
That sounds really weird, why would anybody be bullish when trading with fake money. I thought that Bitmex testnet orderbook is just a realtime copy of the real orderbook to make fake trading more realistic and to add liquidity.

edit: so that testnet trading doesn't influence testnet price in any way, since testnet price/orderbook is always equal to real price/orderbook. But that doesn't seem to be true.
Thanks for the reply. Personally I prefer realistic price movements over the ability to influence price with orders, but that is not my decision to make. Now that I get the chance, thank you for Bitmex, it's the best exchange out there!
No, my bottoms are not off yet. Thanks for asking 
B-rabbit delivers his rap punch.. !
yeah, and without a shirt, OP might get cut even worse.
Can you help me tie my tie? 
It tells me the price still hasn't gone lower than almost 12 hours ago and has been trading in the same $250 range.
Yeah. I will also switch my position to long at that levels. 
> Miner led hard forks are fine. They are the ones invested long term in making sure the chain has value, the rest of us can dump our coins if we want.

I don't think all hard forks are evil. I think hardforks without an ABSURD amount of consensus from everyone are evil.

Miner's aren't in the business of losing money. Miners don't dictate the protocol. If the whole blocksize hardfork fiasco showed anything, it showed that. Jihan effectively controls 60%+ of the hashrate, and is a vocal supporter of a hardfork to increase the blocksize, so why didn't he do that? Because he didn't want to risk his business becoming obsolete in a matter of weeks if the community did not support his hard fork.

Bitcoin Cash didn't even have the fucking balls to hard fork without the emergency difficulty adjustment. They couldn't actually trust in PoW and that the community supported their values. They had to have an emergency difficulty adjustment in there because without it, the PoW system would have destroyed their branch of the network within hours, which is how Satoshi designed the system to work.

"We have SO MUCH consensus for bigger blocks! Everyone in the community wants it! All the miners want it! Anyone saying otherwise was brainwashed by censorship!"

Then they go and implement an EDA because in reality, they knew they didn't have enough consensus on this change to keep the network running without that EDA.


Bitcoin is really the only crypto well suited to be used as the long term ledger.  The store of value.  You don't want your decentralized stateless money to have its properties easily changed.

This does not mean other crypto can't be useful... I'm just saying they aren't more useful as stateless cash.  They can serve other use cases.
Well when the protocols are systems of money and value, it's not quite that simple. This isn't linux. 

The value injected into both networks come from different ideologies and value systems. 

Changing supply cap implementation on Bitcoin would be a 100x harder feat than doing it on Ethereum. Do you disagree?
Segwit was a softfork: Backwards compatible, opt-in system. 

This is precisely why it didn't need a hardfork. 

Furthermore, immutability of the ledger means "if a transaction occured on the network and was confirmed, nothing will change it." None of a blocksize hardfork, segwit softfork, or ETH hard cap implementation affect immutability. The DAO hardfork was the example that affected immutability.
Segwit didn't change the ledger component. Quite simple when you know wtf you are talking about.

"Segregated Witness therefore is an architectural change to bitcoin that aims to move the witness data from the scriptSig (unlocking script) field of a transaction into a separate witness data structure that accompanies a transaction. Clients may request transaction data with or without the accompanying witness data."

Doesn't say anything about invalidating the ledger. 
How did segwit change the transactions before?

Homework: Read up the meaning if immutable in a dictionary. Spank yourself for failing basic english.
https://www.coindesk.com/9-biggest-screwups-bitcoin-history/

>The fix was the bitcoin equivalent of dying in a video game and restarting from the last save point. The community simply hit 'undo', **jumping back to the point in the blockchain before the hack occurred and starting anew from there; all of the transactions made after the bug was exploited** - but before the fix was implemented - were effectively cancelled.



#wooooops
Between this group and buying a ton of it at .04 it has brought me back to almost even since I first bought BTC plus 11k.  Their CEO has been around awhile and has stayed on multiple mediums just how significant their partner is.  Not like he is going to flee the country, so even though my gut tells me run, there has to be some legitimacy to it.  I bought because their base is loyal and I knew there would be an uptick.  I am pleasantly suprised on how fast and consistent it has been.  Back a bit right now.  Big volume.  Now I think there is actually something to it.  I think it will be 10 to 15 cents by the 17th. 
They apparently have some game changing partnership and asked for 75 million XVG in order to release the details.

Then they changed the date they would anounce the partnership to 2 more weeks away.

I got stopped out of my short for a painful hit to my stack (-18%), but I also have my long open from 6520 that's recovered more than half of that. My dilemma is whether to add to the long (if *and* where), open a separate swing trade long (so as not to complicate my entry/strategy), short the next resistance, or just sit on my hands for a while. The dip below 7300 an hour or so ago was probably the place to make any long movements. Shorting around 7480 makes sense under the resistance, but it feels like 7200-7300 was heavier than 7500 should be. The real test shouldn't come till 7800, where everyone and their mother will be shorting and a lot of longs will take profits.

My bearish bias is influencing my thoughts, and I'm not sure that's going to help me trade for the next few days. 
>Also a little tip, don't set targets based on how much money you want to make, set targets based on where you think the price will go or won't go.

Wholeheartedly agree with this tip. Lost a fair bit of money when I first started because I wouldn't close positions because I was desperate for it to go just that little bit further...
Well no, you don't need to have btc to go long or short on Kraken. The amount of the position is the amount borrowed from kraken.

https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/204585998-Collateral-Currency 
I’m not doing anything currently, considering I’m so fresh and just learning general TA and how to work the exchange. Just trying to get the basics down. 

( Sorry everyone ) 
not sure the exact market sell but 1034 BTC sold in a 1m candle on finex
Not even close to true.

In a bear market you can almost always SODL and buy back whenever you’re in the green.

Literally any point between 20k and 7500
Leverage.
Yeah the daily looks quite good, here it's just a scalp I already have a stop at breakeven
Yeah was thinking about a point where I’ll close it otherwise I’ll just wait , thinking about 7800 we’ll see 
Or maybe you're wrong. Maybe we're ramping up for another mega-bearwhale short squeeze. Looks to me like the twerps who have been trying to kill Bitcoin for three straight months are out of ammo. Question is, how many coins do they owe, and when must they pay them back?
Im a long term trader I don’t buy the bottoms or sell the tops I’m the guy who gets in between never losing on a trade but taking much longer to close it, I don’t use high leverage unless rare circumstances 
Yeah I just saw an opportunity to close that part of my short for profit and took it. Only about 1/3 of my position. Realistically I should close my entire position on a test of 7.2 if it holds but I don't want to miss out on the bottom falling out at any moment. 
Zoom out more and it disappears ;)
whats so special about 7800?
Well, the optimism isn't completely unfounded. 

The market reclaimed a very important support zone when it broke above $7,250. 

Although at least so far it's no different than the previous times the market has yolo'd above support-turned-resistance and then given up. 

$8,300 to $9,900 being the most notable. The market broke below critical support at $9,250 and then bounced back above it. And we all know what happened next.

If I had to place odds, I'd say it's a far safer short opportunity than it is a long opportunity. It's just that the r/r is pretty abysmal for a short right now. 

The r/r for a short does improve substantially, however, if buyers fail to hold support at $7,200 or so.
Right?! Looking at the 1d is still scary

Like the next hill up on a roller coaster before letting gravity take over
But a trend has to reverse somewhere. What is your timeframe for certifying trend reversal? 96 hours? 96 days? Why?
Four months? How do you figure?
Yeah. Personally I’m scared of not being able to buy back if this escalates to 8-9k. And of course a 15% push above resistance means something. 
From your own post,

"My bearish bias is influencing my thoughts, and I'm not sure that's going to help me trade for the next few days."
Yeah that sounds right. If 8k holds and we close above it then I will accept defeat and reevaluate my bias. Might even open a long after that. 
7600
You shorters seem to be getting euphoric, just sayin
We could stay within the down channel we're in and still make it back up to 9100. Be careful out there.
You have reading comprehension issues? Where did I say 6.3 would fall? 

All I said was that the sentiment would change to be much more bearish than it was at 7.4 when I posted this and that this sun would start doubting that 6.3 was the bottom.  

Thanks for pointing out I was correct and we are now 300 from 6.3 and 800 away from 7.4. 
[removed]
Oh Mikey Mikey ... my man, we need you too.
I'm 90% sure you have no idea what you're talking about, and 75% sure that you pulled those numbers out of your ass, and 30% sure that you will be rekt in the coming week, and 5% sure that you will cry afterwards on here.
I'm 100% sure you are salty atm
I like those figures.
No, you misunderstood, 2% is end of bear, 4% is where big money comes in.
Ofcourse it's not the end, but the fact that it climbed from 6400$ to 7400$ (seems to be our limit atm) against all the odds is pretty impressive. If you wait for key resistances to be broken before FOMOing in, you risk missing out on alot of gains.
No.. need more evidence. Need to stay here - 7K+ for 24 -48 hours. But it looks like it is a start. 
The end of a bear market after 3 months have to start somewhere / somehow.
Plus: this will help. Smart guys these Sachs. I have experience with them.

I can't believe that's upvoted..yeesh
I dunno, what do you call the guys who short after a 70% move down hoping to make another 50% profit?
Whales playing around man, that's why I'm not messing with this market right now.
Well I guess we can only just wait.
Anything north of that is my target entry, as it stands there is too many shorts. The amount of pullback is unacceptable in my opinion, but honestly we are clearly in a downtrend, it would make sense for shorts to reach far greater highs than we have now. Of course there could be a miracle and we break the top macro trend line and skyrocket to 20k again, but I will remain skeptical.
That's trading isn't clever boy. 

If it breaks 7150 i'll short, if it breaks 7500 i'll long. 

I'll wait for either. Simple concept
I did the same as you. My stops hit at 7250, so I closed my long and I’ve been HODLing since.

Thought 6500 might be a good long, but decided to wait it out.

At this point I am just looking to short the tops. If it goes up, it should probably come down. If it keeps going, then just have your stops ready.

Opening a long here seems insane, but sometimes insane is what you need eh?


I just noticed that if you have a winning long from some ridiculously low price point, you can just open a short for another instrument at any higher price point to manage risk...

Holy smokes...
Back to 6200 when the dump starts.
I'd wager that "new money" is the very smallest contributor of this rally. 
I was asking if there were any systematic drivers for the price increase.  If there aren't and this is just random fluctuations, then that's the answer.
No, please say less.   That is the worst trading advice posted in here in the last couple of hours, which is saying a lot.
Do you honestly belief this?
It looks really unreliable to me.
But then who am I?
Honestly anyone buying that much isn't looking to hodl to 100k. They're are going to dump for a 10% profit and take an easy 100m. Wouldn't you? 
Time to get out bucket of kerosene.
Define "a long time."
>[no defined trend](https://i.warosu.org/data/biz/thumb/0042/91/1510354833668s.jpg)
I've heard this or similar quite a lot recently. Isn't a bull run primarily driven by short squeezes destined to fail pretty quickly? It is by definition not driven by increased demand.
there is a sub for that, it's called /r/ethtrader
Can be.  But considering markets trend longer than they revert it should on balance be “the right trade”.   
I won't be surprised if we go to 5k or 10k. Nothing surprises me any more.
ETH!! 
2% ratio rise? 
I always use cross and match half my cold storage when shorting. Average around 7050 now. 
No, I literally just signed up and said I was from US and now my account is disabled. Will probably have to make another account
Wasn’t aware, thank you
You lost btc on bitmex when they found out you were from the US? o_O
I’ve logged on accidentally not having my VPN on but my plan for if they ever questioned it was saying I was taking a holiday in the US. Probably wouldn’t work but I’m sure there are people on there who travel to the USA and log on once in a while so I doubt they just go around banning anyone who logs on with a US IP. 

Obviously playing it safe and just using a VPN as a rule of thumb is best. 
would love to hear some thoughts about this, good comment 
I'm confused  what you're asking
I do realize they all seem correlated (in general terms, although not every minute). Sometimes the others lag by a few minutes, but this time I think they were a leading indicator by a few minutes -- since btc did indeed follow with another $50 drop right after the others all simultaneously fell.
by being a naive bull ofc
He finally gave in and bought some, and is now changing his tune? 
Woah! Hey, only I have the authority to allow or disallow it!

... ^(Yeah, I'll allow it.)
Won't be shorting? 
Remember 9.8 break when 11.8 was rejected for the first time, then bounced off 9.2 and just went through 9.8 resistance like it was nothing? It stopped right there, crippled to 11.8 again just to drop.

There's no FOMO in this market. Buyers start to buy and there's no continuation. Everyone fears that we didn't hit the bottom yet.

This either gonna be a slow crawl up, just like the way down or we really didn't hit the bottom yet. For now it looks just like bounce off 8.4 and 7.3.
Yeah gonna wait it out a bit, thanks 
Good bot.
It’s almost like people are intentionally trying to forget this event. Crazy
Need another to confirm. /s
Not really ? It was a v bottom at 150 wasn’t it ?
So we've already got 2 bottoms on this one.  At least it's happening faster.  
> If you are a passive investor, you don't deverse to get rewarded.

Passive investor here, I was rewarded with 5000% returns, am I doing it wrong?
Well selling above 10K is half the trick. The other half is buying back in below where you sold. Without the second half, those passive investors win. Some of those "strong hands" might find out that that is easier said than done. 
We are all here to get rewarded, I’m for everyone making money, weak hands or not 
You do realise that 50% of trades are a net loss, right?
So I don't 'deserve' to get rewarded for buying BTC at $xxx and ETH at $x because I haven't sold...I recognized the significance of these assets but I don't deserve my gains.

Meanwhile traders late to the game who just want to play the market obviously deserve their gains, especially day traders!

And all those folks who buy index funds and hold for 10 years, they don't deserve shit either. Only traders do.
I sold an ants portion at 12.5 - does that count? ;)
> there's still a pretty high probability

You just lost half the people in this sub.  Don't talk "probabilities".  It's either "buyers are fucked for sure" or "bears are fucked for sure".  Their pea brains can't understand anything else.
i have students loans man, and my parents have house loans. i believe in bitcoins *potential* but i actually need real money for real shit in the near future, you feel me? 
Had that same idea, on log graph I count 5 waves to the ath, and those three waves after that on a larger scale looks like correction, but on a smaller scale you you can count 5 waves from ATH
yea, usually these things bounce and then collapse.

but this one feels like it wants to stay here. 

took a lot of fire power to get above 7.2k, wouldnt make sense to collapse here if it hadnt already.

next resistance i see is 7.8k 

and after that 8.4k 

anything above 8 would be the perfect short entry . 


that's what i hope to avoid....getting bogged
Not really.  I have plans to buy big dumps and sell big pumps.  So it can go down for all I care.  I, just like all of you, cannot predict this crazy ass market, I can just react to it.  So I do that when I get some free time.  I don’t rely on this or expect it to make me rich.
Just being objective broski. This pump looks thick, solid, tight, juicy. 
Could also be 8.8k. Even I'm feeling the fomo. 
I'm very sure I've seen this type of bull trap play out over and over since 19k and I have no reason to believe it has abruptly come to an end and we are now on track for 100k. 

I'm confident I will be able to close a 7k short at breakeven or in profit, yes.
Yeah I expect BCH to go even lower than 300 if BTC goes to 3k (I think it will). 
i take profits

and always have 50% in reserve , 

i am short from 8.6k 

the profits i nvr touch, usually when random pumps like these happen, i just go fuk it. 

right now dca is around 7.9k 
Not a bad suggestion - the "scaled orders" on bfx are fun. But I was just going for a quick entry, and it's pretty rare that orders within 0.004% of the last price don't get filled.

I should really have done a market. I would only have lost 0.004% of profits.
Stops so tight I'm currently infertile.
If we break 7.7, next stop?
If you're going to FOMO best to do it stupidly early.
awesome feedback thanks a lot. I was surprised to see us above 7200 so easily, and holding strongly as of now. Figured we were on the way to 7400 and didn't want to miss out. What are the chances we are consolidating rite here to from support? 
I'd prefer to get a red verified check mark instead of blue while ya at it.  
new lows? yikes, wasn't the weekend discount enough for ya? How much more can the market take? I was hoping we were primed for a nice run to at least 9k over the next week. What lows are you looking for?
well said couldn't say it any better! Especially in these last few weeks, since they are hard to come by this easy. ugly win better than a pretty lost. 
haven't been in the game long but form the time I have been here, gains like this never last. Its only right to collect somthin. cant be balls to the wall allllll the time.... or can ya?
no regrets at all honestly. More like do can I be convinced that we WONT be back at this price or lower in the next few days. And I pretty sure we will based on how things have been going. But I am a gut trader so what do I kno
the smart solution is to separate your stacks

50% you hold on regardless of what happens

50% you trade with to try and time the market...if you are as genius investor as you think you really are, 50% is plenty to play with. But if you are mistaken, your other 50% will be waiting for you when BTC is trading at $1,000,000/BTC
Or there was an $8 spread and the previous order was on the opposite side of the spread. Which also points to low volume. 

Edit: I see this on futures all the time. But I'd be very surprised if GDAX actually ever has such a wide spread.

Yes, I believe if 7300 breaks and then 7200 breaks then we'll have more downside. 

That's a perfectly reasonable position to take. No need to be a twat is there
Skill 
i short both perps and futs.

i shorted the futs at  8.6 k and have left it as it is .

the profits i take and short the perps for scalps. 

i had closed my perps short at 6.5 k yesterday and still have my capital from futs at 7.8 now, which iam thinkin of closing now.

cant be writin everything .

the all in is just a phrase i like to use from my poker days, 

i do stick to a strategy and bankroll & never enter more than 50% of my origanal capital, the profits i sometimes go all in with . 

Yeah, anything under $7200 would make this look like just a little relief fakeout. $7000 could maybe be the final support, but if that breaks again for more than a few minutes of wicky action, I'd expect goblintown to be the next stop. Holding around the levels here could make a good setup for a potential continuation up for at least $8000 levels though so expecting bullwhales to put up a fight.
3am here and eaten all my food because i'm stoned. send help

We're breaking out. RSI is reversing. The framework that bears have been trading with is in danger of being invalidated (will change market composition while traders wait for a new framework). At the very least there's a good r/r. Just avoid a stop hunt and you should be GTG.
>Heading back down to sub $7000 levels would not be a vote of confidence to investors, it'd be yet another confirmation to scalpers that you should indeed not go long but just look to short every bounce instead, imo.

I agree. Staying above 7k seems hard enough with selling pressure  that's still not looking like it's decreasing.
Once more because he shorted it. We’re going to be at 8K by tonight bros.  
Are _you_ confident? 
Just because some fancy lines drawn on a chart.
Little and often does it. 
The time for him to rise from the dead to play the super bowl just passed.  Minneapolis would have literally made him the messiah. 
lol boom
both the futures, the premium can shoot up or down, any move up or down should be fine with me.

would actually be happy if it goes upto 8.4k to be honest. 

long on june futs and short on sept futs 
Thanks
I'm not parting with my coins, I can be patient for a good while longer. Doesn't mean that I'm oblivious to the trend.
Agreed, *bull*shit!
Bears have been smacked down the past few months? In what alternative universe do you live? Bears have been making huge gains and will continue to do so as long as they don't become overly euphoric.
The neckline is at $9.2k, not $7.3k... If we manage to break and hold that one I'll be become a bull as well. At this point celebrating $7.3k is extremely premature.
Does this have any affect on the price in real time?
[deleted]
That is not gox wallet
I'd go to the least liquid exchange and sell it all in one fat market sell
I mean you know shit is bad when the only hope of 8k is shorts covering. There isn't even illusions of new fiat entering the system. 

This market stinks like goblin shit and permabulls are eating it up like it's chocolate pudding.

edit: 3 days didnt log in I meant. bought low, sold higher, bought low and can wait now for a turn of direction I hope! anyways i delete this post
all the selling at 7500 and now back buying back in for another push up look like. Are is the end of the rally? I'm surprised its gone on this long. 
A kid or not, that account has quite a following, meaning that it may be able to affect the behavior of clueless "crypto investors". 
> I'm actually debating opening a separate long position (swaps) to scalp a push to 7700ish

I did that but on the Sept futs, with an entry at 7300.  It's not big, I set it to be a little smaller than the June long.  Was embarassed to say so because it seems pointless to open 2 longs like that.  But would like to manage them separately.  If this scalp long goes bad, I'll take the penalty against the other long to not end up in loss.

If I scalp short it'll be on swaps maybe.  Only time will tell if that was wise or not vs whatever the funding rates become, they keep flipping.

Dat hopium in the veins, bro.
No Trip to <6K
Haha! After looking at some of these responses I now finally understand why most politicians sound like media trained robots; just takes one loose sentence... :)
I see us bouncing off 7800 if we even get that far. I think we have one more deep dive into the sea before we rise once more like a majestic dolphin.
Absolutely. Buyers can't show even an ounce of uncertainty or doubt when nurturing this little recovery. 

They can *maybe* sustain a drop to $6,800 without a total collapse of the recovery. But providing sellers with even the slightest amount of momentum is a surefire recipe for a horrifying decline below $6,000. 

There's very little margin for error here. 
Fair enough.  But two weeks ago we had three green days and everyone was wanting to call it the end of the bear market.  Now we have another nice run up and everyone is suddenly high on moon juice again.  While I could see this going up for several more days I'm pretty sure we're not going to see a bear market reversal off a bounce without any period of extended flatlining.
6600 to 6800 no?
Yeah, it is kinda risky.

But I'm only at 5x leverage, so I'll be ok if the price moves up to 7.8. I probably should close it if it breaks out of that, though.

Even though I'm taking the opposite position at the moment, I do appreciate your commentary.
the next cycle will probably take 3 years and this will all be a distant memory
I think you speak for soo many people when you say this.This is definalty how I feel the market is rite now. Its best to get an ugly profit than settle for a pretty lost. I can see us being atleast 6 more month away from a bull market but I don't know since this is my first time around. But given the way things going its for sure going to be awhile. How much longer can you see the bears running things? 
Subreddits become worthless for discussion once enough users join i'm afraid. Upvotes are for confirming peoples' bias, not for content, that's just the way it is.

IMO loads of new traders here with no understanding of their emotions. Of course they get mad when they lose money
I have only ever avoided losing money by listening to chewy. His longs don’t always pan out, but his shorta generally do
I agree that selling now is a very very stupid thing to do

On the other hand, buying now is also not exactly a genius move
This is the big question, IMO. Someone who really has their ear to the ground is reading sentiment and understanding how market composition is shifting. I don't think I fully grok what's happening. My YOLO 10x long because of these ideas is paying off, but that happens with resistance is the whole story.
If we double bottom here, my elliot waves predict months of sideways and a dramatic runup this summer that fails to test ATH.

No, he used a stop limit buy to *open* a position. This is generally inadvisable. It falls under the "heh heh heh I'm clever....oh shi-" category. 
it just depends which time frame you're talking about. Day traders largely seem to get rekt. Swing traders holding onto their position for weeks isn't "marrying" it, it's just being  patient. And hodlers and longer term traders are just being even more patient

I'm a swing trader and I plan my entry/exit points before each trade. When there is no news or major change in fundamentals, I generally stick with them. This trade had a 10% stop, with a planned profit take above 4%.
Oh yes, you're right. Well that makes me feel like less of an idiot then. Lol

I had this exact mentality. It was the dumbest thing I've ever come up with, in retrospect. "Def gonna hodl for at least one year to save myself 12% in taxes. I mean, there's no way it's going to drop from more than 12%... 19000+ down to below 17000, that's impossible AMIRITE?! I'd be an idiot to sell now..." Whoops. Life lesson unlocked.
False.

> You don't report your stock purchase to the IRS, and you don't pay income taxes on your purchase transaction, but you still need to keep documentation of the transaction to help determine the cost basis of your stock for when you decide to sell sometime in the future.


They don't care about what you own, they care about your income.

You report the purchases when you sell so that your capital gain/loss can be calculated. 

it's called the internal REVENUE service, not the internal ASSET service. 
I was very wrong. Heheh, don't know what was going through my head. Bad math, apparently :) 
I divided 250,000 by 0.04 in my mind. Got something over 5 million. Dunno why I did that, though, now that I think about it.

He’s a VC and also founded Augur. Vitalik lived with him in California at one point so he seems quite well connected.

However, you are right that it doesn’t mean it’s true. Anyone who benefits from being a “crypto personality” has an incentive to claim they have insider information and it’s only a tweet.

Personally I think there’s increasing demand for OTC even if not true.

Could be, i would prefer a safer approach if that's the case and short if we break the channel bottom at around 7400. But like he said, low risk high / high reward. 50$ isn't that much to be risking missing the drop he's expecting.
I'm only right if it hits 7550 or so, anything less is noise.
Even 50$ is not so much to risk missing an entry, let alone 10$
Alright, encouraging words. Maybe I'll keep at it. I think I should open a short any second now but I've been saying that for 4 hours so who knows.
Different strokes for different folks, best of luck.
Well gee Buckyboy, I don't know. I sure thought we were at $7.3k but your thought provoking question is now making me question everything!
That whole thread. It's like a fighting a forest fire with a garden hose.
Yes, most people trading commodities were able to pass high school chemistry.
You are reading wrong, that's not how YTD works.
I can see arguments for both sides tbh
That's very conservative. We should be on our way to testing resistance around  8K. If your target is a $200 scalp then I don't think you'll even have to nap on this.
You're arguing about $50?
No, word on the street currently is MEH but interest may be growing again a little now the hype (and the price) has come down.
Just my experience, I can't help you in anyway i'm afraid.

I think it is interesting that I only know of 1 of my friends is dabbling in crypto despite most of my contacts being in a much better financial position than me (i'm an artist so never going to be rich :) )
Why are they not getting involved? thats the big question? and IF/WHEN they do we will really see the price/value flourish but a few major things have to happen first.

That's sort of the whole point, nobody knows what the value is. So why these magical threshold numbers, just psychology I guess but most of the trading now is bots (what TA/sentiment are they programmed with?

I bought the Feb dip almost perfectly (just luck i guess though) but it was much easier to predict being more of a flash crash than these slow bleeds which just pop back up seemingly randomly.
It doesn't have to be 3k. But as a speculative asset, and no more than that, 3k offers a much better risk/reward ratio to savvy investors than 7k (or even 6k, or 5k).
That is probably a strong support for the speculators to prop up. 

BTC offers less than 3k of value. International payment settlements is it's only real use case and even then you need a fiat pathway to make good of that feature. 
Most considered alt capitulation as abandonment of garbage coins. AFAIK, this has not happened. 
So you're saying 'the house' wants btc to go down or up? Or just that whatever the sentiment is leaning towards, that is the current house sentiment?
Nope, you got it wrong. All those shorts, thinking they can outsmart cme and bitfinex out of their money. That's betting against the house. The same is true when market is constantly going up and the number of longs moons.

I find it always so hard to distinguishe what I want from what the signs tell me.
Oh really? interesting. I saw chewy didn't consider it one yet so I was unsure. 
that i might agree. but not for too long. RRR to going long from here to maybe 7700/7800..is a bit low.  i would be taking some profits around here myself. but, i am quite risk averse so...
Those are just newer traders, not alt coin refugees. 

There are certain people here worth following.  Everyone else is noise.
in defense of newbies, at least they are posting their positions for public ridicule... and DYOR, including sifting through new traders and bad ta
Wut?? How? I didn't tell *anyone* to short at $7k...if I did, it was before it dumped below $6.8k. but I don't think I've told anyone to sell or short since above $8k, although I did believe it was going down. 
Definitely a shitty entry for a short, but also still risky for a long.  Shitcoins are still way overvalued.
Don't under estimate the number of coins available. When they dump someone else is buying expecting the price to rise, and thus making a new potential seller, not 100% sure he is in the hodlgang.
don't necessarily disagree with you, but what makes you think there is a shrinking supply of Bitcoin?
7.4 -> 9.2

It took couple of days before we went down again and volume was also there.
yeah but still, house money fallacy
Nobody knows

You’re basing this on what exactly? Bitcoin has never behaved like any other market, so basing your opinion of what Bitcoin will or won’t do on the past performance of other markets is wrong IMO

There aren't hardly any perma bears.  If the price drops to $2000 or lower, most of them will become bullish.

The only true permabears are on /buttcoin, not here.
Define 'usually'. This is Bitcoin
Yes.  There has always been a period were the price doesn't move much for weeks before the true reversal.  But that doesn't mean there won't be any giant dcb before it happens.
Not to say that you're wrong but we saw this exact same fractal on March 18 to March 21 which broke down.

Excuse all the random marks, just focus on the candles:

[Today](https://www.tradingview.com/x/DtisUPDV/)

[March 18 to March 21](https://www.tradingview.com/x/TLOzLDjd/)

Not saying that it's going to play out identically but the steepness of the wedge doesn't really dictate when it breaks down.  Really, all it takes is one whale to get bored and decide to take profits at the near top of a wedge.


I completely sold out and moved into fiat for the first time since late 2013 a few weeks ago to pay my tax obligations. Didn't have to sell everything but I needed a mental reset and also awaiting word from accountant on final tax obligation. I refuse to pay crypto taxes with anything other than crypto gains and thankful I am in the position to be able to. Knowing I have to give 1/3 of gains back to IRS definitely changed my outlook on risk/reward and I'm sure I am not the only one regardless of what tax bracket you're in.
I know many who sold for tax liability reserve purposes. Including a corporation.

I also know many who seek to buy crypto with their tax refunds.

If we're not going to breakdown to a new low here, wouldn't we expect a low volume push up that looks like it's going more sideways than it looks like it's going up? I honestly thought it looked like we were going up too fast and with too much volume.

Terrible indicator, I don't give up. Still buying ... not going to stop until I see a squeeze.
Exactly. It's actually been "dumb" to short the market for a while. Tons of good news, etc. But the market can act dumb to the downside for a while, just like it was dumb in December.
You need to buy bitcoin to buy most altcoins. 
That's both non-excellent and disgusting.
Based on previous bubble bursts, I expected/expect us to dip down to $3500.

Satoshi's short from $13k. 
Lol I don't have a position right now as I'm in fiat to possibly buy lower with a stop loss at 7550, I just think its funny that we're essentially at the local low on March 16 and we have people calling this rise as the absolute end to the bear market.

People have amnesia.
What do you mean bitcoins testnet? The price on bitmex has nothing to do with bitcoin tech, really. 

Bitmex testnet is simply another exchange for bitcoin. The coins used are fake coins but they're used to trade the real price based off spot exchanges. it's just that the testnet coins are worthless irl
No order book  is significantly less liquid. I pumped futures to like $20k one time for fun with a couple hundred bitcoin leveraged high.

The BCH fork was really lame yes, if they wanna scale on-chain with blocks, why not just lower block time to 1 m ? 
>Well when the protocols are systems of money and value, it's not quite that simple. This isn't linux.

It in fact, is. If a majority of nodes changed to blocksize X tomorrow, it would be truth assuming the chain with most nodes or network power is the real one

>Changing supply cap implementation on Bitcoin would be a 100x harder feat than doing it on Ethereum. Do you disagree?

No, but this do not change the core of my argument. I don't even know why to compare them, it's like to compare gold with oil

Indeed it will be harder on bitcoin because, sadly, every technical decision is now driven by politics more than anything... I'm not so sure it's a good thing that bitcoin "will never change" technology does not like to stay the same for so long.. 
> None of a blocksize hardfork, segwit softfork, or ETH hard cap implementation affect immutability.

It's extremely frustrating that this has to be explained.

God damnit people, what the fuck do you think we are trading? Is this shit pixie dust to you all?
Who said anything about transactions?

Immutable: unchanging over time or unable to be changed.

Bitcoin didn't have segwit before. Now it has segwit. Therefore it has changed over time.

If one feature can be changed, why can't the coin supply or any other feature also be changed?
True, but harsh.

Immutable isn't a basic concept. I don't expect anyone to know the meaning in casual conversation.
There isn't an alternate chain as a result of this decision, though. The bitcoin community was more unified back then. Today, we'd have the equivalent of ETC form.

This is a perfect example of how bitcoin, or anything, is not truly immutable. You're always managing degrees of mutability.

https://www.moonmath.win is technically an immutable architecture, but it changes every day at the same time.
So there was a major bug in Satoshi software that was fixed before anyone was really using the network. Whats the problem? 
Who hasn't complained about coinbase.  I am over a month waiting on a tranfer from MY vault to my wallet.  The gains I was going to take have obviously vanished.  Coinbase did not freeze him, they are just completely inept at performing the simplest of tasks.  Countless people have a similar story. 
Nah, that's not what bitconnect had pulled. XVG is more like NEO in hyping a yet to be announced announcement. Will see if they can deliver on the hype.
I think you have your answer.

Not only do you not **know** what the market will do, but you don't even seem to have a firm sentiment of what you **think** the market will do. 

And honestly, I don't have much of a firm grasp on thinking or knowing in this range either. 

So I'd say your answer is to stay out and watch from the sidelines.
That's right, didn't mean to imply otherwise.
ok so yes you have 1 BTC for collateral, you go 2x long, you are borrowing a coin against yours, price moves to 7800 you make 800 minus fees etc.
May I ask if you bought in December/January?

At $7.8K you risk closing at the top of a fake run up. $8.2K I think is closer to when we can start potentially calling this a real recovery.

A 25% jump in BTC price from $6.4K gets us to $8K. 25% was the jump we saw from $7.3K to $9.2K last week.
I can respect that but your timing is unexplainable. Hey profit is profit so if you decide to close it congrats for not closing in the $9ks.

I personally will not be shorting here unless we make it to $8,500. I feel like we're too much in the middle of the channel rather than the high side of it, and short interest is just too high for me. If we don't get to $8,500 with this rally, I'll just have to wait it out on the sidelines until either it drops far enough that a buying opportunity presents itself or it rallies again at a later date.
A break out of an established channel. Trends can reverse all the time on shorter timeframes, but to say the bear market has turned into a bull market can't occur until the downtrend channel from the ATH is broken. It's been attempted numerous times and been rejected every single one. 
I didn't say we're not going up. I took issue with saying this is a bull market. You can go up in a bear market.

People think a bear market means an elevator to B2. We can go to 9500 and still be in the downtrend lines.
only thing making me think this might be actual recovery

So would you say you're pro-LTC???
LTCUSD looks exactly like the BTC 2013 crash.

Seems like I've hit a nerve. Don't be over-invested.
It's your comment that comes off as salty, I'm just stating my predictions.
You're advocating FOMOing in on the basis of 7000 to 7400?
It didn't rise "against all of the odds".  There was significant probability that it would do just what it did.  High probability by some calculations.   A glance at the chart suggests a bounce was likely.
It's pretty nice, right? It's essentially like hedging your cold storage, though, except I don't have any cold storage anymore (unfortunately). That's what I'm trying to build again, though. I'd be thrilled (selfishly) with swinging $2k back and forth under the log line before a new bull market as the next halving approaches. My "accumulation" period is the next year haha. 
I wouldn't be so sure. Sideways more likely imo
Yes I do , as I know him 
Not necessarily. Look at the size of some of those hedge funds - particularly cash reserves from Apple (yes, they have an internal hedge fund - Braeburn_Capital) or insurance companies. A billion dollar is change for them (Apple size: 268 billion, there are way larger retirement funds out there).
Exactly, does ATH shorts not also signal that an increasing amount of the herd is not interested in putting a lot of their stack back in for the forseeable future?
yeah most likely, but it's bitcoin so you never know. If we can get rid off enough underwater longs by squeezing shorts we might be able to just sideways in the 7-9k range long enough to continue the bull run
What do yo consider "the right trade"
69k flat for month I would find very surprizing
WE ARE ALL GOING TO BE MILLIONAIRES!

I mean it did a similar rise, up to 5% over days, not even a week ago. Might turn into something but don't see it as particularly noteworthy rn
Or maybe you should take that as ample warning.  Luckily you didn't get a chance to deposit.
I wouldn't fuck with Bitfinex. I've read they will freeze your funds if they find out you're from the US 
No.. I lost because I used too high of leverage like a scrub . 
you may want to look into "counterparty risk" brotha
What I’m asking is why is the general consensus that bitcoin has to go down further than the 6800-ish from Sunday?  

The bottom in February was only 12% lower, and that was non-stop FUD for the 6 weeks prior.  What I’ve generally been seeing is nothing but adoption and/or regulation to try to corral the blatant market manipulation, so I’m confused as to why 6800 wasn’t low enough.
ETH led the way for our last major dump towards 6.4 by about 15 minutes. If there's enough selling pressure on it, it can absolutely tip the scales when BTC is stagnant
True in this case, but it's not worth risking a trade based on alts' movements. It will just lead to frustration.
lol nah I wouldn't be surprised if this is an accumulation phase in the end but we need more time to tell if we make a new low. $6.4k is dangerously close to a new low and right now we're still at risk of making a new one
I usually don't go through comment histories but his is pretty hilarious.
I might. We'll see how the market behaves following a breakdown (assuming there is one). 

This current downside push came very close a few minutes ago. I'm actually surprised the support line is still holding. 
Can confirm

https://www.tradingview.com/x/FWZHpphN/

Hit a V then confirmed a triple bottom before new ATHs
imo the real reversal signal is the part where it didn't move much for nearly a month from end of april to end of may.  
Heaven forbid anyone act as investor and act prudently and methodically over decades. That kind of thing doesn't reward anybody. /s
High5! ;)
If you didn’t sell above 10k, you are just greedy and lost 40% of what you could have won. So don’t think you are that smart.

Yeah definitely buy back but don’t fomo in, dca instead, this is still a bear market with a shitload of resistance on the way up. Don’t get overhyped with a 2 day bounce, “zoom out”.
More btc or more fiat, but don’t blindly hodl.

“Everyone get rewarded” lol that won’t happen, if someone win someone on the other side loses, this is how markets works.
Your problem is not selling in this bubble , not buying buying early.

Keeping this hodl narative to late comers aint helping them.

Well, to be fair, one of those statements *is* true. 

We just have no way of knowing ahead of time which it will be. 
No judgement from me, man. I had to liquidate 100% of my cold storage about a month ago (fortuitously executed at 11,300) for unforeseen needs. I left a small amount to trade, and my goal is to grow it back into a new cold storage stack. 
Everyone here cares about fiat in the end but some are so blinded by BTC that they don't see it. Holders don't hold to sell at $1 after collapse, they good to make big bucks. All the fanatics and fundamentalists care about BTC mooning just to have more money, but you know, saying that out loud just feels bad so they cover it by BTC religion.
Then you should be working on increasing your pile of both.  I miss the coins I've sold more than I would any paper money I sold them for.  I'd have tens of millions of dollars, but now I don't.

Good call bro my god good call
What about of ltc?
If you always have 50% in reserve, that isn't all-in. Just saying.
Risk management brother, don't burn out too quick. 
My bet is we might have a peek above 7.7 but then probably down to 5k.
Can’t argue with that
Bank it. Lots more opportunities to come.

I've seen it, too, even on gdax with low volume. Once saw a .01 btc order move the market $8. The "market spread" was only $.01, but there were only a couple very small limit orders on the books near the center of the market.

50/50
Yea, I'm actually finally less bearish than most of the people here because of this movement. I've pretty much missed a good exit for my short so I'll have to see what happens. I could close and just re-short under $7k but I want to see where it goes from here first. 
One word: rice

I usually have wild rice handy for moments like these. Tastes hella good with some soy sauce
Lol. Never crossed my mind. Probably will from now on though!!!!
I ask because I'm legitimately curious; what framework are you referring to?
What do you mean new framework? I've seen you mention this a few times.

Are you talking about bottom shorters getting rekt? Because these guys are the same ones longing $11.7k a few weeks ago. they're not real "bears" they're the hogs getting slaughtered. Nothing really has changed and nothing will change until we get to like ~$8.2k again. And even then, we still have a decent ways to go up. 

Any bear with a modicum of patience understands bitcoin will not simply go downwards forever. Nothing about this movement is particularly surprising or new, there have been significant bounces all the way down 
> tonight 

not sure.
<Record scratch> I don't short or use leverage. I buy low and sell high.
He's confident that we don't need to test it again, obviously.

Yah back under, there's another potential support forming for a channel between $7100 and $7300 in the interim to consolidate though, maybe. If that breaks, I'm out.
I'd argue you have this backwards. 

The premium on September futures has the potential to skyrocket moreso than the June futures. 

Premium is generally a function of market sentiment as well as time until settlement. For the most part, the farther out the settlement date is from the current date, the higher the premium should be. 

While one might assume that the September futures premium would decline more than the June futures if the market continues downward, this might not necessarily be the case. 
I should do this lol, i am too brainlet to monitor more than 1 position at once. Any tips on doing this?
I was making a point that the same idiotic phrase, just flipped, could be used at the top of the bull market in late december.
There's a small sort of double bottom at $6550 and $6450 with $7200 as the neckline. That's a target of roughly $8k


No! Mt gox wallets are constantly monitored. That is not one of them. 


No Gox BTC has moved: https://www.cryptoground.com/mtgox-cold-wallet-monitor/
So if you don’t trade then you must “hold” right? And if neither of those then what are you doing in r/bitcoinmarkets?
thanks, nothing controversial about this opinion, it’s what the majority of people in the world believe (though I personally think they are wrong) 
That's quite literally not the definition of a hodler.

I don't gild when my position is underwater. If we hit 5k before 8k then remind me and I'll gild this. 
There is news and there is rumor. The difference between the two is common sense
great observation, you're absolutely right
Like I said in my original post, $7,800 is right around the resistance line for the bearish descending channel. The market shouldn't really have the momentum to push through right now. But hey, the market shouldn't have had the momentum to push through $7,250 either. Yet here we are.
As always, the next weeks are crucial for Bitcoin
Yes, thank you
This is my primary concern. Not if I buy in at $5k-$8K but if we stay sideways for years. 
I have no idea and anybody telling you otherwise is lying. In Feb when we broke from sub $6K to over $11K and last month when we broke from 7.3K to over 9K it was euphoria for everybody outside of the TA guys. People have very short term memory in crypto. I am a bit biased since I literally sat on my hands for 2+ years during the last bear market and I just think it's too early for a market reset. Not saying price will go much lower or higher but we should stay in this range for at least a little while longer. A lot of people look at how much we already went down percentage wise and say it should be over soon but there were few instances during 2014-2016 where the same things were being said and we proceeded to go down. Again I have no idea what's going to happen but I do miss not owning crypto since this is the longest I have not had any in over 4 years. 
Very true, the I lost money so you should too attitude is very prevalent here, especially among the perma-bulls. Guys, you can still hold a bullish outlook long term but short term you should learn to be flexible.
ha was just messaging you, didn't mean to delete that one, ugh. my b

Big red dildo
I'm stuck holding bags now lmao, thinking of setting tight stop losses if we go down any further 
All depends on the kind of trade you are putting into.

But marying you position is sometimes a symptom of greed.

As a day trader I got rekted before for marrying my position and chasing that extra x% gain.

Since becoming more cautious, I’m up a shit tone lately, like 600% in the last 30 days. By not beeing too greedy.  Btc became so predictable lol.
If we are going to be creepy, I'd say younger as I remember a screenshot with snapchat notifications.
holy crap, so it missed your stop by like 100-200 bucks?
He runs a market maker bot on there so I'm fairly sure he's very comfortable with them. Afaik he also said he knows management? Or something.

Look at his name
That was five minutes in December. Obviously a lot more people were buying than selling throughout last year (see price rise). Presumably some took profits at the high, and they owe 2017 taxes. If you bought in April or January, the dip since December is probably not that daunting since you're still up hundreds of percentage points and looking at your IRA like... "Yeah, I think I'll just let this Bitcoin thing ride." Might see some organic selling later this year as people cash out some of their long term gains, but this dip of the past three months is weak hands + manufactured by ppl with far more money than brains. 

I didn't even start trading until I'd held for a year to avoid paying the normal income tax on my (very substantial) gains. But that's just me. I'm sure you're right and there are millions of people who bought in December just dying to lock in those losses for 2018. :))
False. If you don't document your purchase today, then you can't document your sale tomorrow because the latter references the former. You can't all of the sudden say in 2018 'I'm selling 200 million in bitcoin i minded in 2009.' having never mentioned the 2010 aquisition - without having a lot of other questions to answer.
OK, so the first line could be drawn a little different. It's still broken though, isn't it?
Yep, I think that's a fair assessment
Especially since it's equal in size to my long entry down at 6510. It's basically just foregoing the returns on $7490-$7590 on that long if I get stopped. 
Are you using high leverage?
We're cooling off a little right now... how much, I'm not sure. But as you noted we were overbought all the way up to 1hr.
Ha, I don't trade just for the money - it's something that helps me stay connected in the space, be part of the community, and learn a new life skill (as they say Trading is a life skill until you 1) enter crypto, 2) experience a bear market, and 3) become a degenerate gambler on Mex
it's what we signed up for, chief. somebody's gotta do it.
So basically you don't know but bring up a last straw argument :D Guess it proves my point a bit.

But anyhow, let's say they do and some don't(like you are saying and I do not disagree with) how does this change anything or is an argument at all in the trading context ?
Ah you're right, posting before I woke up properly.
Same here, thats why I'm saying it could be too early but it will be a hedge no doubt, only thing holding it back is volatility and I think thsst will get bettwr with time. 
And only time will let it go the moon 
I'm considering adding a small amount to my position here honestly. Bmex seems to be holding 7380s consistently on the 15m
If bears are going to get new lows these selloffs need to start working for them.
For someone who's serious about his trading, yes. A 50pts off your support/resistance levels makes a difference in your PNL and the goal is to have a positive PNL in the long run. I'd even argue that 7.2-7.25 was more resistance than 7.25-7.3. I probably would have said nothing, if 7.2 was mentioned as key resistance.
It's not 'a speculative asset and no more than that.' It's the primary instrument to trade altcoins with, and whether you think they're all shit or not, it is now a multi-billion industry with thousands of developers involved and lots of capital invested into various crypto startups. Unless Bitcoin is replaced as the main source of liquidity for crypto markets, it's going to benefit immensely from altcoin development, and in case you haven't been keeping up with the news, altcoin scene is only growing, 'bear' market or not. 
The use case for Bitcoin is crypto market liquidity, not international payment settlements. There's also the whole story with it being a store of value, but as a Bitcoin skeptic I don't really subscribe to that.

Regardless, at sub-$3000 prices today Bitcoin would have failed both as a liquidity asset and a store of value asset, so saying its 'value' is somewhere under $3000 is ridiculous. (A short term wick is possible perhaps, but an extended period that low... yeah, no). It's either significantly higher than that, or zero. International payment settlements are better done with XRP than Bitcoin. 
And there are Alts dying every day. 
I feel you. I don't think these people are manipulating the market as much as others seem to, but I get you. 
but the market is there for everyone to participate on their terms. If someone can make money from that, they will. The market just is and gives opportunities until it doesn't
Hmm, I could be wrong. Some guy on babypips said its still valid lol.

Makes sense as to why local tops are used tho. 
Pretty sure there are a lot alt coin refugees, other crypto subs have been banning some bearish poster and we end up her.

I'm never seen so much shilling of alts, ETH post were upvoted to hell and bashing ETH get you downvoted. 

Ex from my shitposting on ETH :

[deleted]
No but you're defending a permabear in troll mode. You two are the some of the most frequent posters and you both have the same skewed perspective on account of your position. 
Neither did I but I bet 7k will look pretty damn good soon enough. 
The shitty entry for a short is the only relevant thing.
Of course a lot of them are looking to sell in the short to mid term, but some percentage are no-leverage long investors who darn sure aren't dumb enough to keep their coins on exchanges. I personally keep about one percent on an exchange for times when I feel like gambling (because I suck at trading.... trying to learn something from you guys).
1800 coins mined each day, not all sent to market. ~80-100K bought every day with some percentage moved to cold storage as long-term investment. If it's even two percent held long term, the supply in market is shrinking, but it's probably much higher than two percent.
Maybe I've been oversold on this bounce lol. There seems to be a big shift in sentiment already. Everyone was a bear 3 days ago and now people are talking about escaping the downtrend at 9k. Lol
LOL You clearly slept through intro to prob and stats...
If you wanted to try and provide a probability of outcome your methodology could be to look at past instances that mirror today and see which way the market moved more commonly. 

That's a simplistic and flawed approach, but it's better than picking a number by closing your eyes and sticking your thumb up your ass.
> Dumbfuck


Name does not check out
Basing this on several things, at this point it's primarily from what I've seen and experienced so far. Also...2014 charts. Lots of bounces and run ups along the way. 2014 had several times where the daily RSI hit overbought. 

Note I didn't say $3k is guaranteed- I just said that's how it happens. It won't happen in three weeks with 21 red daily candles. it'll be a lot slower and more painful than that. 

You get what I'm saying? 


Not that it will play out like it did in 2014-2016 but after an initial drop that was a long slow bleed with plenty of fake reversals
Steepness makes it more likely to break down imo. Harder to continue a steep uptrend. Also makes me trust the pattern less though, could just go sideways out of it.

Fractals aren't useful to me past some fun facts. You never know when a fractal is going to break down. For instance, look at the weekly chart. We were fractalling pretty consistently with the 17k DCB and crash to 6k until sort of last week and this week so far.

And I don't really see the fractal you're talking about anyway. Looks like they're both just generic rising wedges.
Holy shit...1/3. Fuck man 
A thousand bucks in like 48 hours... maybe the cat's not dead (?) 

Somebody might dump a bunch in the next couple days, but I'd be surprised if this wasn't at least partially due to money being re-allocated from traditional markets which are very clearly in a bubble right now.

Already posted earlier see my reply to sloppy
bots want 20k bitcoin as much as the next guy.
With little-to-no regard for new money entering the game? Rash comment to make
Yes, that would be the scenario that I'd be concerned about.
The [OBV](https://snag.gy/FqfHZY.jpg) looks in line with the rise, don't see any divergence yet.   Seems that this volume is in line with what's going on, at least at the moment.  See how before the OBV was going up but price was going down then we got the correction to the upside, don't see anything pointing to a bearish divergence at the moment. 
lol the reversal has been cancelled!
Boo
I see, and yes I agree about overreaction in both ways.

Not saying you should look into TA if that's not your thing, but it might at least be good to consider to look for some trending indicators for you, to be able to see what trends and not, and then use this as a tool to get an even better entry on the sentiment decisions you make
I'm a bit shocked to see some people here already acting as if this is the start of something great. Over a 4% rise after tons of down.

Now if this goes 35% and there's genuine sentiment change across the whole space.. Hey maybe the bull is back then.


People are calling it all kinds of things. I think you may be mischaracterizing other people's positions. Maybe stick to explaining your own non-position?
Never mind, the coins used are generated on the bitcoins Test net, but the price action must come from the exchange.
Thanks for the replies. I can see why people would prefer this way of test trading instead of just copying the original orderbook, but for me it just doesn't work. For context: I'm writing a script that automatically converts a June futures position to a Sept futures position of equal size, in a way that minimizes risk and cost, and possibly even makes money doing it. This is impossible the do if the price of June and Sept futures are all over the place, and randomly switching from $7k to $11k. 
Lol.... I can't even...
> it's like to compare gold with oil

Agreed. Kind of my whole point here. In fact that is why I invested in ETH at all. I saw it as "truly not Bitcoin" or "not gold" as you put it. Every other shitcoin, from what I can gather, is basically "fake gold" or "gold 2.0". The radical difference in mindsets of the ETH developers, community, and investors was enough to make ETH something entirely different, and therefore I saw value in it that wasn't already covered with my Bitcoin investment.
It changed. We have Segwit and we also have Bitcoin Cash. It just didn’t change in the same way with the same approach.

If blocksize increase hardfork had resounding support, it would have happened. It didn’t have that support. That’s why Bitcoin Cash needed the EDA. That’s why Bitcoin Cash is much less valued. 
The most frustrating part of the 2017 bull run was the influx of new people who were mostly clueless about what they were investing in. Not clueless because they are dumb, just because the technology and the history is pretty complex and they are new to it. It’s hard to have the patience for others to catch up. At least they are paying to play. 
Segwit is the code, not the ledger.
when people say btc is immutable, I believe they mean the entries in the public ledger are immutable, not the protocol.
Bitcoin is just a list of transactions (legdger) and set of rules on how to create new transactions. The ledger, aka transaction history, has been recording since 2009 and hasn't change ever since - the start of Segwit did not change anything about that.

Segwit works with the exact same rules as pre-Segwit Bitcoin. People who don't use Segwit can interact with people who use Segwit, and vice versa, because everybody is following the same rules. Saying that Segwit changed Bitcoin is like saying that the new iPhone changed Facebook. No, the device you use to browse Facebook has changed, but Facebook itself is still the same.
No, it has not. See, the ledger as written ahs not changed.
This doesn't encompass the full scope of what's being discussed. That anything on the planet is truly immutabile is debatable. Matter seems to be immutable until you start splitting and fusing atoms. Gold supply seems to be immutable, until you expand your scope into extraterrestrial sources. Bitcoin seems immutable until you come up with a way to successfully execute a 51% attack.

We're not talking about software features, we're talking about supply. A hard fork changes supply in bizarre ways, and there's more than one way to do it.
It changes with every rease candidate from

0.1 original Satoshi release. Nobody claims the code doesn't change tho. 
No because no one mines it. It's technically possible to fork from that block i assume 
So like ETH when it was 1 old ? (:
Plus everyone on r/cryptocurrency thinks it is a scam.  That alone is reason to buy.  Also tells me that the growth is coming from somewhere else.  If volume and the price continue to shoot up there really might be something to it.  Insiders etc would be accumulating.  Who know though.  I'm going to ride that train for as long as I can with exit points already in place.  
Thanks sir. I greatly value clear-headed rational input.
> That means you pay for 1 BTC when you initiate the trade, and you will pay fees for borrowing another BTC

Don't want to be picky, but this wrong.

When you open a  2x position with 1 btc as collateral, you are borrowing 2 btc(short) or fiat equivalent(long) from Kraken and you still have 1BTC that you didn't sell or buy.
Great thank you 
I bought in the day after Thanksgiving in November. Made like 3,000% profit and cashed out a decent chunk. Now letting the rest ride, but slowly adding money into my alt coins unless I’m able to profit trading 
Why would you count in fiat.... count in BTC. It’s not all that hard. Just buy bottom and sell tops. I am down since the 20k top in terms of fiat, but I have more BTC

I only longed in the bull market, shorted and longed since February 

Kinda hard not to make money tbh, but if you doubt any of us, then I’m sure you have your reasons

But 8.2 is also where we meet a fairly reliable log resistance line, so that could be closing the top too: https://www.tradingview.com/x/foQV0uAt/
True, my mum's a bull, too.
Six months. We're not even in a bear market. That little run-up to $20K was just Big Daddy Bitcoin showing us what he can do, not an "ATH" by any stretch of the imagination. 
Lol
This is a very well-reasoned and intelligent approach.

Those antsy for sub $6,000 BTC, don't really realize that buying pressure is likely going to increase as price drops not decrease.

The risk of shorting anywhere in the $6,000 to $7,000 is already quite high. It gets a little ridiculous below $6,000. 

Because below $6,000, the bottom could realisticly be anywhere.
Where does that channel resistance put us at now is usd? 
That makes sense, I understand what you mean.
LTC’s returns on investment last year blew BTC’s out of the water. 
LTC will without a doubt be the adopted pure decentralized currency for the world that will work in conjunction with BTC’s store of value. To pit BTC against LTC is just irrational primitive tribalism. 
This shows how little you know about the Tech. Lightning Network is something people in this sub used as a basis for why BTC was not dead. LN is LTC, forget being faster and cheaper to send, LTC is basically becoming the coin all these apps like Abra will use to interchange currency. It's probably one of the only coins with actual tech instead of just promises. Don't forget LTC is the new favorite dark web coin.
Yeah I'm not sure why you're getting dragged through the mud here. You're not hailing 1k or something, but a number we had yesterday which we may very well see again lol
nah, just calling you out. you have no basis for your percentages and it's clear as day you pulled the numbers out your ass. your guess is as good as mine
I advocate FOMOing in on basis of the incredible support that has been shown at 6.5-7k
What process do you use to remember patterns, do you have a folder and keep screenshots handy?

What else do you look at? Ex: how do you know where the targets for 75% of the traders are? I want to learn basically
I guess it depends on how much "skin in the game" the owners of these leveraged positions have. Are they just making short term bets or are they interested a longer term investment?

I really don't know but I have the strong suspicion that this whole "bounce" is driven by people betting that there is some hidden mob getting ready to buy just around the corner, and I just don't see it.
Example:  Let’s say you capitulated and sold near the bottom.  Moments later the price pumps $200 on volume.  The hard trade would be to pay up and buy back, rather than concede and watch as the price runs away.  
If its fiat. because U.S banks don't accept fiat transfer from bitfinex. 
Looks like I’m going to Kraken
You can trade with VPN without a problem on Bitfinex, but you can use fiat feature if you are from US. Crypto-crypto is fine.
Oh lol gotcha. Yeah we all been there lmao 
Well yes, I've just never heard of anyone losing funds on bitmex due to them finding out they're from the US. 
Look up some traders on tradingview like: MarcPMarkets, TomProTrader, DLavrov, off the top of my head. They give decent explanations.

As for the common sense question, a thing I've learned in college is that common sense often doesn't match up with "objective evidence" and "facts", I think it's apparent in economics and sociology. Also, consequences from all the FUD news last some time, it drove people away, made them stop reading and following crypto. It takes a while for overall sentiment to change, that is why all the good news seem like they are being ignored. This is just my simple take on this, there are too many variables to give a good answer on the spot (or just too many for me :D).

I hope this helped even the slightest. It was all the noggin' juice I had left, sleepy time!
I shouldn’t say has to, but the overwhelming expectation is that it will go lower than the February low.
because it's a bubble. and anything past $2000 was basically exorbitant gains. No price discovery, lots of weak hands sitting on huge paper profits still etc. It's just how bubble pops and markets work

most bubble pops retrace 70-80% from ATH 
I think there is a MM interested in rising the price, whether is for an underwater long, to dump above or something else. The price will be kept high. Any other occasion we'd be under 7k already. Its weird 
In theory, that could correspond to the $5850 bottom (which was a decent V), followed by a couple more lows in the $6500 area. Not saying it will play out, but could be possible, I think.
still But trend reversals usually happens after panic and liquidation wicks which will still happen imo to something like 5k
40% now or couple more hundred percent in the future....hmm tough one.
>If you didn’t sell above 1~~0~~k, you are just greedy and ~~lost 40% of what you could have~~ won. 
Depends entirely on the timeframe. 
Of course both those statements are not true.  Not unless you live in a fantasyworld with your crystal ball, which I know you don't, but many in here do.
> Everyone here cares about fiat in the end

Yeah, but we are nowhere near an end. We are still at the beginning. I don't like religion.
I feel like no one knows what all in means...maybe they think it means like all in emotionally like "yea! I believe in this one!"
lo yes, 

i meant all in in my capital.

when you are euphoric you dont think through,.

was waiting the last three days for anything abobve 7.2k 
I don't see how other people cant understand this. 
I didn't say buy.

I said to sell now, just in case it dumps more. The 50% you hold just so you always have a bit in the game in case you sell and this really is the bottom(as unlikely as it might seem)
In your opinion 50/50. 

I believe if those numbers go there is a stronger chance of further down than more up
So you didn't close any of you short then :) good for you, still seems that further lows are much more probable than a long - term turnaround here.

Descending trend line. We'll probably break down from it, but that will start to paint the right shoulder of an iH&S at a crucial level. We're also looking at a good A&E double bottom that may push us through the local descending trend. If that happens we go neutral, which is very bad for bears opening shorts in this range.

Good for him/her...though I couldn't be confident based on a low volume rise, after a deeply oversold dump, in the middle of a bear market
was just waiting for both the futs to get to the same price point and seeing the market being stagnant, jumped right in, iam a bear ofcourse but this thing feels like it might go and test the upper log resistance. 

and if the bottom were to fall of here, will close my long at around the 6.9k mark and add that to my short,(hope this doesn't happen)

but the ideal situation is for this thing to go up on low volume, anything in the 8 k range would be awesome, this way my long would have doubled in size to my short and i can add this my short entry and get my dca way up as well as my liquidation. 

ofcourse, the bottom is gonna fall of now. 
I don't see how these situations are comparable at all. Daily RSI levels were close to 100 back then, everyone except the most euphoric bulls were waiting for a correction. Daily RSI is now around 40, BTC has still a lot of room to go down.
If you choose to look at the charts that way, we already broke the downtrend when we broke $9.5k on February 15th. How did that turn out?

All the repression downvotes are almost good as gold
lol yea I understand that seems fair. The 6k-11k bounce really me excited. Thought I was about to break even at least but then all hell broke loose. I hadnt been the same since. Crypto has become more and more apart of my day since then


Why'd you delete it haha 
Ah, yes indeed
Wrong. Only on sale or exchange do you need to report the gain/loss. 

https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-virtual-currency-guidance
You could always risk a bit more and let it go underwater until 7800. If it stalls there, closing the long and adding to the short for the ride down should be profitable (although every time i tried that approach i ended up panicking with a sudden move and losing on both sides...)
My pattern is drunk :)
Well done on your entry! 
No.
Yup and the B-bands too
I'll get my shovel.
It means you don't know how to evaluate fundamentals. There's more to a product and a company than a sticker price. Traders know how to identify the value of a thing and recognize when that value is in jeopardy. If one doesn't know that Bitcoin is immutable, and doesn't even know how to use the term then they don't have the ability to evaluate it's position in the market.

Commodities traders understand their markets very well, and they are very fluent in the relevant terminology.

Lol just use layered orders instead 
So tell me, what will happen to Bitcoin when the secondary altcoin market (filled with 80-90% scams and startups) collapses under its own weight over the next few months?
Are there? I haven't paid attention since I exited the alt world in early march. 
Market is always manipulated if it goes against you. It's organic only if it goes your way.
[deleted]
Oh no I know they're here, just saying the people here suggesting no stop losses are just newer traders, not alt coin refugees, necessarily. 
Oh come on. Yes I'm aware of that but please don't tell me you think there's some kind of hierarchy based on your position and when you entered it.
Oh hell yea. That's some real one shit right there man, I won't forget this kind of loyalty 😤 I got your back for life now


even I didn't remember I said that lmao look at me being all smart n safe
Sloppy was an enthusiastic bull during the run.  He changed to a dispassionate observer of the market willing to short during this  bear market.  He sees the market for what it is and doesn't post bullshit bear FUD or rose glasses bull hopium.  Good neutral contributor, imo. 
> on account of your position.

He predicted a prolongued bear market and/or bubble pop well before this most recent dump from ~11k. On my read of his comments, he has based his reasoning on the dynamics of previous bubble pops. That means his views are theoretically motivated, not based on his current position. He may have a bearish slant (currently), but that is not because he is shilling his positions or whatever.
I'm mainly fucking around because $7k is a pretty terrible entry for a short right now. just pointing out that he *does* have another day. 

I'm not really defending him because his comment was obnoxious lol but that's dushman for ya.

And I'm working on my bias lately, I don't think it's as bad as it used to be. 
I believe you will profit, just will take some more days. It "wants" to go at least to 7.8 but all this sideways stretches takes time. 
Man don't get me wrong, I'm long since 7030. 

But this is a bear market, with a shit tone of ressitance on the way up and no real support to draw on the way down.

Don't fomo on a long or a short, you will be underwater at some point.
Yeah. But it's kinda confusing. I didn't expect it to push it up here and now I have no idea. Going short may be profitable, but we may go back to 7.8 before next drop, if it even comes...
You know how quickly sentiment shifts here. Trend is still down. Until there is confirmation on a reversal, trade on that.

Exactly. Frogs have to be boiled slowly or they'll hop out of the pot :)
I don't put much weight into fractals either but I keep an eye on them to know what is in the realm of possibilities rather than predicting exactly what's going to happen.  The more times a fractal appears, I factor that into my r/r.

And just to show a bit clearer, I deleted all my lines (D:):

[March 18 to 21](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Gr0KPi3j/)

[Today](https://www.tradingview.com/x/rEjBrc3J/) with the scale adjusted.

Again, want to state this isn't what I'm expecting it to play out like but just to show that a breakdown here has happened before.
And that's just federal. There are also state taxes. Makes you see things differently right? People will say just hold for a year and will turn into long term gains but it's hard to do that in crypto.
zoom out and then wonder if this one is different. to me, it won't be, until it is.
So stick to your plan. Swallow the loss here or add at 7.7-7.8. which will you do? 
New money comes in and old money leaves. You can't base an argument on something that you can't even calculate.

Not even 35%, that might still be too small. Remember the 100% gain in Februrary from 6k to 12k? I do. I guess most of crypto has forgotten.
Short memories, small wallets. Well said.
I gave my technicals earlier today as to why I'm in fiat.

But just as you're calling out my joke post for not really holding much information / being a sentiment indicator, I'm poking fun at how it might not be the best idea to use sentiment in this small sub as an indicator for market movements.

I don't really understand why you have such a strong tendency of self-modding.
Bad for you 
Yes some then actually have interesting ideas too, like siacoin or monero 
*sigh...*

You're right about this, too. 
Right but even the ledger has been rolled back. See the comment by csasker above.
The ledger was rolled back in 2010 when someone created 92 billion BTC out of thin air.
It's technically possible to fork from any block. You need to give miners an incentive to do it. ETC was able to establish an incentive because the community was divided over the decisions of the development team. BCH did the same to Bitcoin. The block they chose was arbitrary.  The hard fork that BCH followed through on also exposed a way that Bitcoin is mutable. Everything is mutable. The only thing that's immutable, by natural law, is energy. We're always talking about degrees of immutability when we're talking about something other than energy.
1 old what? 
Good call, I'm in the same boat. Curious what comes of it, given the FUD around XVG is relatively intense.
You’re right. I suppose it’s better to say that those funds (the collateral) are not available for other positions while the position is open
You and I bought in the same day. 
> Made like 3,000% profit and cashed out a decent chunk. Now letting the rest ride.

You're doing very well so far then.  Don't get cocky, and don't treat the stuff you are letting ride as "house money" or it'll disappear fast.
Looking left on the hourly chart at around the $8K to $8.2K level shows me massive order blocks and resistance. I would be amazed if we can penetrate through all of that.

And if we can then I will swap to bullish for the medium term and assume we can get up to $9K+ levels.


Downtrend channel from all-time high is roughly $5680 (low) to $9600 (high).
So did ETH and you can make a much better argument for ETH than LTC in terms of a “bitcoin alternative” that isn’t a shitcoin 
this
why would LTC be any better for anonymity for darknet users?

XMR is what people are shifting to. Private ledgers.
Well... I find the word incredible in this context, quite incredible 
There aren't a ton of patterns, at least that I bother with. They're pretty easy to memorize/remember after a little while. All I really trade on are bull/bear flags/pennants, ascending and descending wedges, ascending and descending triangles. I skip all the fancy ones.

Targets to me and generally based off of channel lines and longer-term resistance/support lines. I fudge 1.5% off those lines to help ensure execution of orders. Most people who trade off TA have similar lines for support/resistance. People who don't believe in TA often still trade off those lines whether they know it / admit it or not.
Anecdotally it seems like it's from people who think it's guaranteed to go down and want to wait to buy back in but don't want to wait to make money off of it
Thank, It's a risk and profit opportuniny
Thank, It's a risk and profit opportuniny
I don't think that's the overwhelming expectation... but it it were, then it's worth remembering that the majority are usually wrong.
Oh yes, it certainly could be. I am of the opinion that 6k was not quite as low as we should go because it is playing out like the previous crash. A parabolic break should give a 85% retracement of the price, but this target has yet to be realised. I have been following this chart as a blueprint for a while now and its still playing out so far.

Updated: https://www.tradingview.com/x/UCNtchCC/

Old: https://www.tradingview.com/x/RFm9EpiD/

That said, I expected this push to go further to around the 8200 bearish trendline before further failure but BTC has been under preforming my bullish targets for the last three weeks so a wave failure before then would not be unexpected.

Position : Short Hedged 7450 XBTH18 (I would of much preferred a higher entry but this might have to do) 
5k? Sounds like a bounce I'd barely survive from. Let's do it! :) 
Keep the hodl strong 1m before christmas.
All in short at 7350*

*And by all in I mean psychological all in for so risky trade which is 1% of my stack.
Yea I've held this thing for so long I might as well just keep holding it out. I can't really see this getting past $7.8-8k anyway
Thanks for that - have to admit I have one - lived in Italy for 5 years ! I guess I have got lazy. But will perhaps dust it off and start again. Do not wish to be a cloonie under any circumstances! 
It's a case of glass half full, glass half empty. I don't believe we are in a bear market, rather a correcting market, there is no fundamental reason otherwise. So after the market has corrected, naturally we would resume a rise. A rise on low volume isn't always a bad thing as I have learnt here - it means there is plenty of money waiting in the sidelines still to buy in. And if we had an oversold dump, perhaps that is a sign of capitulation ? I myself am not sure whether this is the start of the next rise, or just another bull trap. But I agree with OP. that we have tested support below 7K enough times that we could go up without having to test it once more.

Huh? What you talkin bout? I'm just saying there's a double bottom.

Everyone seems to expect this to just go down forever and ever with no retraces but that's completely unrealistic- and I'm saying a double bottom to $8k before continuing down again wouldn't surprise me at all
lol. Get a life. Sorry you missed out on the btc train you lemming. 
Based on the amount of downvotes, it might be time to get your coat 
A hodler doesn't have to "buy every dip", you are just making that up yourself.

A hodler could also just buy the last couple of dips and then hodl forever.

Username on point.
"Ban dat commenter, fam"
And that prediction could be incredibly accurate, it seems much more likely than a straight line to bearish 3k or bullish 10k. It could only have been made by someone with no skin in the game. 
wasn't sure if the timing of the comment I referenced made sense, second guessed myself, itchy delete finger lol
Thanks! Now where to target. $7320 is my initial thought. I expect $7250 to hold with padding. 
Then this is a great opportunity to add to your position if you're really bearish. Doesn't mean it'll work out, but the best time to add to/open a position is often when it feels uncomfortable to do so
>Commodities traders understand their markets very well, and they are very fluent in the relevant terminology.


Correct, but my point  is that is probably enough to know that let's say Dell uses copper and why, and the economic reasons for it.  How much density it has or whatever is irrelevant. 


And also some traders do not trade fundamentals at all, but use for example trend following systems they fine tuned for most markets. 

You can of course trade on fundamentals, but there is no contradiction here
>not knowing the difference between traders and investors

Why do you think Warren Buffet was not interviewed in the Market Wizard series ?

That's not how statistics work.


Yeah, I don't know. But if traditional markets look shaky (they do) and Bitcoin goes up strongly, it's a correlation that merits scrutiny. Wouldn't go so far as to say that's what's happening, but it is one potential source of demand that has not really been tapped yet.
Swallowed part of the loss at 7.4 but given this rising wedge I'll be standing pat, and adding at 7.7/8 if we get there

>The Average Directional Index (ADX) is used to measure the strength or weakness of a trend, not the actual direction.
I just woke up.. 35% was a quickfire maths guess! I'd like to see 11k then I'd be 80% bull at that point.

That would break every key resistance point I think. 
Because reading the same inane joke over and over is boring.
If those ideas prove valuable or essential, Bitcoin can implement them. 

The harder feat would be shifting the mindset of the bitcoin community to that of ETH’s.
Yes, go see that comment and read the responses.

What does that have to do with Segwit?
So like when the network was small and had little value outside hobbiest and the impact was negligible? Good time for a devastating bug.

But again you fail to understand how consensus works, you can't roll back without near unanimous agreement or you end up with a worthless minority chain. When bitcoin was tiny this was feasible, today it isn't feasible unless it were in the interests of the entire network to do so. Seeing as it took years for what should have been non controversial upgrades, i don't think ot would be at all possible to get near unanimous consensus on rolling back transactions today certainly not in a short period of time time. 
yes
year
It will def be interesting.  I would never have invested in Verge if I was not confident their base would drive it up.  The CEO is screaming from the rooftops that this will be the biggest deal to hit crypto.  If it works the tech compares very favorable to other coins, they just released wraith.  I highly doubt they plan on taking the money and running, he has made himself to high profile.  So either the guy is simply CRAZY, the partnership is nothing to get excited about or there really is something there.  So much time until the 17th.  FOMO has not even hit yet. 
You're uninformed if you're comparing LTC with ETH. It's not even right to compare LTC with BTC in terms use uses. BUT ETH IS direct competition for ETH. 
That.
Something recently happened with XMR that exposed a privacy issue. I didn't look into it too much but apparently it was a big deal. Also LTC has a partnership with Monero 
For the ones you do use, what candles are you looking at? 1hr, 4hr?
That's my sense too. That means if it starts to falter it should shit the bed pretty quickly 
Been thinking something similar ...

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/7taZMmxm-Bitcoin-Please-not-like-last-time/

But also keeping my mind open that 19k might have been the pre ATH before the final Bull tard run ...

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BLX/gdMnQEfC-Bitcoin-Will-we-repeat-option-A-or-B/

Either way, if we are doomed to repeat history, we go doooown.
keep your 25 day reddit account stronger.
In the same boat, but thinking about eating some of it to have more dry powder if we go higher up. 
Fair enough, if it's a matter of outlook, we'll agree to disagree. However I'll just point out that there's no guarantee of further gains after a correction, it's a correction to a perceived fairer price after all. And regardless of how many times we go under 7k, it's still making lower lows and hasn't tested the low of February, so I wholeheartedly disagree with the OP
Yeah okay, I can see that. That's why I said that $7.7k wouldn't surprise me before heading back down. I'm just calling out the bulls who think we're back in a bull market after this modest bounce.
[deleted]
7400 seems to be holding, its a tough trade. I would set a profit stop @7390 before analysing the next leg down.
7290 should be another barrier (don't know why but ultimate resistance seems to be 10 or 20 bellow round numbers)
Fair enough, I think I'll do that.
Not knowing that Bitcoin is immutable is like not knowing that a computer needs electricity.
You've finally exposed Warren Buffett as a fraud. Congratulations.
Ya but there are a ton of ethtrader people here for sure. Lots of upvotes if you praise eth haha 
Cool, glad you're a fan of the show. 

But I don't think treating people as untouchables helps anyone. As the man himself said, everyone is biased. We are all able and justified to challenge those biases.
We're all biased, and personally I think there's a lot to be said for putting your money where your mouth is. Very easy to say bitcoin is going to $3k with no money in the game. 

Of course my position will influence my thinking a bit but I really do think I'm relatively neutral lately. like hotsoccerman noted I basically advised against shorting below $7.3k a few days ago. and a week or so ago I straight up said I'm generally advising people not to short anymore. Although that has morphed more into me just suggesting they don't trade at all 
Yeah but there's also 12k. If we break 12k then I might be convinced.
So start with the ones who start posting dumb crap like that.
On the other hand, ETH has already implemented BTC and LTC :P  https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ebtcnew/
So, in computer science, when we talk about immutable objects, we are talking about data structures that have a high degree of immutability as compared to mutable objects. We call them "immutable" even though they are not energy.
What are you talking about? 
https://www.google.com/amp/s/ambcrypto.com/monero-xmr-speaks-against-the-privacy-allegations-fud-to-subside/amp/

I don't know the legitimacy of this as a source, but apparently, according to xmr devs, it only effects transactions prior to early 2017 and has been resolved
For intraday trades, 15m-1h. For long-term entries, 1h-4h. A pattern should be clearly discernible on multiple time frames to warrant a trade, and no single pattern should dictate a position. There should be multiple supporting factors for any trade. 
> However I'll just point out that there's no guarantee of further gains after a correction, it's a correction to a perceived fairer price after all.

Sure, but what happens next tends to be: people notice that the price has stabilised and is no longer dropping -> bitcoin becomes useful again as a savings vehicle -> price rises slowly as people buy for savings -> speculators notice the price is rising and buy in as an investment -> price rises gather pace as speculators join in -> press notices the increasing rises -> new investors buy hoping to get rich quick -> BOOM ! -> smart investors take profits, price drops -> market corrects but overshoots, swing traders rock the price in each direction (where we are now), until the market finds a new, higher level -> etc..  

Note this is even without considering the natural rise in price due to increased transactions / awareness / usefulness, etc.  
Oh yea I feel you. If there *were* to be a genuine reversal though, this would pretty much be the place it'd happen. I can see why they're jumping for joy even if it is *very* premature 
"You hundred thousand guys who made $10,000 to $1,000,000 are fucking idiots because a million people lost money!"
I set a $50 trailing stop and a take profit stop at 7320. Watch it go to 7325 then trigger at 7375. Still, nice having a guaranteed win. Hopefully it doesn't faceplant past 7320. It was significant resistance, so hopefully it turned support 
You could wait longer to see how high it goes, or just stop it out quickly (although you will incur losses from fees). It's up to you really, you have to develop your own trading style, and making mistakes and gaining experience will help you determine what that is

If I were trying to open a short here, I'd have relatively tight stops and just keep re opening til it was clear I got the top. After a few tries I would stop shorting so as not to keep losing money on fees. But that might not be in your best interest, it's just how you want to do it
If Someone doesn't know Bitcoin is immutable and is purchasing it, it means they haven't done the barest minimum of research and probably shouldn't be purchasing that thing in the first place. I don't know why you're being downvoted.
Not at all was I was saying, but try to ignore and be funny instead of admitting you are wrong
Either way.. There really is still some way to go! 
Didn't mean to make you feel picked on. You're right... it was just one of many. Wasn't really directed at you, just needed to comment somewhere. If it makes you feel better, the top comment was the one I reported.
ETH forked when it was 1 year old, just like your argument about bitcoin forking when it was 1 or 2 years
Gotta love the logic lol. Made my morning! 
Thanks that's a good strategy. I'll see what works, I'm gonna be in the trading game for a long time I imagine.
It seems weird that a trading sub would unite against basic facts, right?

Some people have more than one account and RES. It lets them rapidly login with different accounts to manipulate votes. It's a persuasion technique that violates Reddit's TOS. I'm not saying that it's happening here. I have no proof. 

Oh, look, csasker has posted to /r/The_Donald . That's probably unrelated.

https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/search?q=author%3Acsasker&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&feature=legacy_search
You're the puppet.
yup
are you just making random comparisons or did you have a point? 
Just assume it'll be pretty rough for a while. You will likely be in the red at first unless you employ good risk management very quickly
I just figured out what's going on here. You're being downvoted by talking about trading on fundamentals because there's more newer entrants into the market. Bull Run in imminent. Going long! ;)
:D interesting, I must just have seen that pic somewhere and thought it would be fun to post, I have no memory of why.

anyhow I just wanted a discussion about trading vs investment and different trading styles, that's all...
oki

both forked when they was young  so i don' get the "bitcoin did it when it was early" argyment
Maybe... That's hilarious, but it's actually the opposite of what my TA is predicting. Seriously. 

I think we're seeing frustration because shorts are taking their profits and leaving the market. Basically, traders have made their money and they're staying out of position while the market figures out its own direction. Lack of traders means more horseshit. The remaining shorts are the dumb money.
Also, check out the daily chart. We've got a fifth wave of an elliot wave that may have double bottomed. The third wave is always the longest wave, too. If we're reversing the bear trend early, this is where it will happen.
What part don't you get? You brought eth into this not me. I don't give a fuck about eth.
Haha I just read your other post on that. I'm joking I bought in yesterday. I'll wait until BB bands tighten and we finish this bear cycle we started in January until I buy with the last of my fiat. Although anything under 8k is fine by me. 
well, you are right. I was writing that in the context of the post both of us was replying to
Moment of truth incoming today.
so 
> Bitcoin's ledger is actually immutable. That's something the Bitcoin community cares a lot more about than the ETH community. The DAO hardfork made that very clear.

You think because when bitcoin was worth about $250k market cap and had a unanimously agreed to hardfork to fix a critical bug in the core protocol, this is on the same level as bailing out via a contentious hard fork a shitty smart contract worth $55 million on a network with a market cap of a billion dollars. 

I'm not even sure how you can make this comparison.
Oooh I'll keep as eye out. I'll also watch for your Noob buy reccomendation as well for my friends. Should be fun to see what happens!
Between you and me... and whoever reads this. I'm concerned that I'll miss the window based on the scenario that I set up. If we bounce off that descending trend then I think the noob recommendation will get published again. If we break through that we may remain too volatile to ever publish it, or I'll have to change the criteria under which I might publish it. I'm not sure what that criteria would be ATM.
I thought that if we broke through we would be in for another 3 months to 8 months of downtrend for potentially a 90% correction from all-time high. But you don't see that?
No. I think Alts are in for that. Bitcoin will recover. If the market is able to identify that the dead weight is in alts soon enough then Bitcoin will probably go sideways or up. The market will stay irrational for some period and then the fat will be trimmed.
Yeah I guess I'm just not as optimistic. The reason being, when Bitcoin was on CNBC, even they were talking about the next Bitcoin or the Bitcoin killer Etc. At some point though a lot of them will go the way of bitconnect.
I think they were caught up in the story that dumb money was following, which is the alternative blockchains. I'm always operating under the assumption that media is mostly wrong about nuanced information 100% of the time.
