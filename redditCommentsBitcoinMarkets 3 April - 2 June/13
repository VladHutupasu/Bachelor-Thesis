Short from $8,390.

The rising futures premium was just too good of an opportunity to ignore.

EDIT: Stops above $8,500. A strong breakdown here could (and should) drop down at least to target support at $8,000. 

EDIT: Decided that $8,650 is a far better stop loss point than $8,500. Would be content to hold this short through a bounce back to $8,600, but if that point breaks up then I'll be ditching this position very quickly.
Hey just a quick thanks to all that add their .02 to these daily discussions it’s rather informative and entertaining, Keep up the great work and best of luck to you all !!
This just looks like a major accumulation period. Until 7900 falls or 9000 breaks, this is basically gambling if your going long or short with leverage. Buyers and sellers don’t seem to have the volume to make this go either way convincingly. This sub switches from bullish to bearish back to bullish about every 12-24 hours which makes sense because of all of these fake outs. Personally, I’m holding my 8400 long and won’t abandon unless 8100 falls. 
Closed my long at around $8,500 for a negligible gain.

I was expecting a strong, and near immediate push back over $8,500 when I entered my long, and instead I'm seeing sellers lining up at that area of interest. 

Will wait for $8,600 to break convincingly before hopping into a fresh long position.

wow check out the volume on alt coins..lot of them have not cracked 100 BTC in 24 hours..
Long from $8450 with stops below $8,300. 

RSI has cooled down and there's relatively strong support here at the moment. 
Wedges inside flags, inside triangles, inside pennants... Testing the cloud on one timeframe, while inside the cloud on another timeframe, and rejected by the cloud on another timeframe.

I'm really starting to become of the opinion that none of this stuff matters at all. Not one little bit. You can paint any picture you like with this stuff.

I find myself using less and less indicators as I learn, rather than more. Right now I use RSI, BBands and volume, nothing else. Im learning new ways to interpret the data from these few indicators rather than adding more.

I still draw lines on graphs to try and estimate where short term support/resistance is and what direction it's moving in, but that's about it.





Bearish div on the 15-min, 30-min and hourly charts. Volume a meager $5.5 bln (lowest since Apr 16). This doesn't look like much of a bull run. 
Long at 8400, stops at 8090. Still in the mindset until proven otherwise that 7900 was a higher low 
[So I only had to baby sit this position for a little bit. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ky3fx/daily_discussion_monday_may_21_2018/dzc2pnc)

Good luck yall
Reducing my position size here. Closed 75% of my short at $8288

I hit all my targets that I posted 1 days ago [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8kqeh2/comment/dzardpy?st=JHH27ONY&sh=f9ae1b06) 

I’ll be looking to open a long around 8100-8175 if the support line holds from our 10k resistance ( Green Circle)

Taking the night off and done shorting the corn for now 
Exchanges like Binance & Bitfinex made >$300M with 97% profit margin this year. Legacy institutions have taken notice. And believe me, they're coming. 

We'll hit a tipping point where the market will take off. 3-9 months. 

Custody is difficult, and it's what's preventing pension/endowments/sovereign funds from entering. It's a long process.

Until then, we'll go sideways.

Sand Hill road missed crypto chapter 1. They're not going to miss crypto chapter 2.

Wtf was this? 
Can somebody explain how decreasing volume can possibly be good? I see people saying "downtrend on low volume" "bears running out of coins to dump"... I'm still bullish because I made up my mind that I believe BTC will be higher this time next year than today so trying to ignore all the noise but it's hard to ignore the decreasing volume. Isn't decreasing volume = decreasing interest? Any explanation to counter this simple thought?
Closed my short at $8,280 for a small gain. 

Because I'm going to bed, and buyers are batshit insane today. 

Edit: !short xbtusd close 8280
Mex is strongly leading stamp, bfx and gdax.


For the last few hours you've seen +25 dollar difference higher on mex and this number gets reduced as prices increase on stamp and gdax.. then another spread by 20 on mex followed by more catchup on the lower volume exchanges the price is based on.


This is normally hard to spot when range is tight but on low volume days this lead-lag formation is clear as daylight.

It looks like we have a hidden bullish divergence on the 1h charts. I think we could see the uptrend continue.
Just wanted to say with all this KYC and AML stuff floating around that if you have made enough from crypto to follow the laws and still live comfortably than just do it. I live in California and have paid an exorbitant amount in taxes and I filled out all the Bitfinex FATCA and CRS paperwork as soon as it came in. But honestly, I stopped entertaining negative and greedy thoughts and just looked at how blessed I am and it feels so much better to live that way.
this thing looks like it's trying to explode. that was like an internal combustion. 

we went sideways at $6.5-7.4k for 13 days.

we've now gone sideways here for 10 days. 

that weird little volume spike is probably bots, but this really seems ready to blow the fuck up one way or another 
After these shakedowns, june futures premium back to increasing again.  Sheesh. Always weird when I see a red candle on finex corresponding to a green candle on mex.
Everything else to me is just noise until [this](https://i.imgur.com/u6Rgc4J.jpg) gets broken. 
Vol is at like 10-11 month low... https://imgur.com/a/98tzwFX 

I wonder if there is some kind of "technical low" for this or it can just go down and down
If you trade for a living, how long did it take you to become get to that stage? Was it a part time occupation? Did you dedicate period of doing full time before hand?  I'd be curious to know. 
New higher low has been set and bitcoin is looking to set a lower high on the 4H chart. Still all cash until a break is made in one direction or another.

Did anyone else see what I just saw on finex?  Giant up down osscilations & huge volume?  I missed the order book.... were there some massive competing market orders?
I am almost sure pretty much noone is actually buying bitcoin to use it or hold it anymore. Its just bunch of bots and gamblers trading with an occasional whale pumping or dumping.
Falling wedge inside a big symmetric triangle.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/3noULS2r/

Breaking out of the wedge probably can't break the larger triangle right away, but it will make a strong case for a massive iH&S on the daily if bulls are able to sustain a trend reversal for a week or two.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/1j1HOpnt/

Bulls don't even need to break 10k to confirm this pattern. Confirmation can happen as low as 9,170 if it takes until the middle of June. 

The daily ADX is showing the bear trend getting progressively weaker in this position.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/yZXbUrZ0/

Daily Stoch RSI is showing more momentum for the bulls, with a lot of room to grow at a critical juncture.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/MdjHWUYx/

Failing to make new lows despite the successive dramatic dips in StochRSI is exposing serious weakness in any possible sustained bear market.

Bulls failing to make new highs isn't ideal, either.

Zooming out to the weekly we see a familiar story.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/hHirbm7f/

Our indicator is making new lows, but failing to break the price down. Meanwhile, BBands are rapidly tightening; Weekly BBands haven't been this tight since the end of May 2017. The result is a chart that looks more like the rounded bottom of a handle than a bearish trend that's about to break down.

Bears need to dramatically increase available bitcoin supply or trends will continue showing strong favoritism to bulls on longer time scales.
Would any of you be kind enough to point me in the right direction of some resources that can help get me up to speed in the btc markets?

I have basic knowledge, and I've been fairly successful. But I don't really feel like I have any idea what I'm doing so it's only a matter of time.

Hell, I can barely understand half of what's being said here. Historically, I've always managed to pickup on things rather quickly, but I would like some help. 

I'm willing to put up some coin if you guys really think it's worth it for the knowledge. Anyway, I'd really appreciate any incite or references you boys can give me. 
anyone else noticed the clock drift from gdax api in the last week? Their websocket feed drifted past 1 second into the future compared to my server clocks (synchronized with ntp), while their /time endpoint appears to return the time from many different clocks, the worst of which is 5 seconds slow. 

I mention primarily because I know clocks are a security vector, but don't know enough about that stuff to know if this could be an attack. 
Binance coin up 5% last three hours while BTC and most other cryptos are down - I suppose it has something to do with its use as gateway coin? (Pardon if this belongs in the alt discussion.)
was this 800 coin volume on Bitfinex a sell into a buy wall or a buy into a sell wall?
That was a 2K magnitude Bitquake.
Here's something that I find interesting: [SPY](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/AMEX-SPY/) vs [BTC](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/)

The average chart sentiment is "BUY" for SPY and "SELL" for BTC, despite the fact that both price movements were similar in the last 5 months. Both charts have very similar peaks and bottoms, BTC being a little bit excessive maybe.
Stopped out at 8390 for a moderate gain from my entry at 7950. 

Anticipating a test of the 4H higher low at ~8190 and have set a limit buy at 8250 to regain position. Will re-evaluate if we set a new lower high and higher low on the 4H time frame. 
Hi all, I've written my own bot and got some advice here on indicators which seems to be working well but made the mistake of using gdax. The volume on EUR is terrible and the spikes are only arb bots not actual trades. Any one know of another exchange with a similar API and fees with decent volume? Margin would be a bonus nothing major 2/3* would be good. Just looking to give it 100 and see how it goes before throwing a bit more at it. 

Cheers
The volume on Bitfinex is interesting right now. Barely moving the price...

Edit: Oh, I see. I'm not the only one to be startled by it...
Damn, I reduced my short position when buyers managed to pop it back over 8.4 earlier - wish I had stuck to my guns but buyers were going ham. Even now they won't let it dump properly. Why is it that they trip over themselves to buy at 8.3 but won't touch the thing at 8.6? I wish I understood...

Edit: Swaps on Mex momentarily fell below mark price. Are people starting to come to their senses?
Fun but perhaps not super-useful observation; We’ve only had one 12H candle open and close below 8200. The shape of that candle is also favouring buyers quite heavily.

I have a feeling that the area around 8.2k will provide at least some short-term support.

I’ve been out of position (for me that means 100% fiat) since I closed my long at 8540. But decided to enter back-in at 8290 without leverage with 75% of my holdings.

I expect this to probably test 8.2k again, and possibly 7.8k. If the latter doesn’t hold, then I’m out in fiat again.
What do you guys think about Binance adding BTC-TUSD pair?
some thoughts on BTC here

TLDR - giant consolidation, likely ends bullish, needs at least 2 weeks probably before decision

https://bravenewcoin.com/news/bitcoin-price-analysis-consolidation-continues-2/
Support is holding like a champ for now, but buyers keep falling into that same trope of "ZOMG, cheap coins! BUY BUY BUY...for exactly 15 seconds before we give up."

The June futures premium is up to about $90 at the moment, and has been rising during the drop to test support (not declining as we typically see).

In short, a bounce from support is being taken for granted. 

They could be right, but things will get ugly quickly if they're wrong.
*In my opinion*, we just left or are about to leave the E wave of the corrective trend and are starting a new market cycle with Wave 1. 

There might be one more corrective subwave coming which would bring us between $7k and $8k, but maybe not. Low volume is an indicator for it, though.

>**Wave 1**: Wave one is rarely obvious at its inception. When the first wave of a new bull market begins, the fundamental news is almost universally negative. The previous trend is considered still strongly in force. Fundamental analysts continue to revise their earnings estimates lower; the economy probably does not look strong. Sentiment surveys are decidedly bearish, put options are in vogue, and implied volatility in the options market is high. Volume might increase a bit as prices rise, but not by enough to alert many technical analysts.

[My Chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZuOvlXdX/)   
What I see here is a big move up.  
Why: Descending weekly volume is reaching very close to its breakout point, most likely this week or next. The volume will probably decrease after the first week of breakout but it should for sure give us a nice fat candle first.    
Weekly MACD is about to flip, every time it has flipped we have pumped _hard_ , I'm talking 100%+ gains   
We tested the weekly Tenkan and it held as support for 3 weeks now, same for daily Tenkan as well as 50 day MA which has started moving upwards(currently 8.4k) which will push us up even more.   
Weekly ichi cloud is going to push us up within the next 2-3 weeks.    
Weekly bands are squeezing, signaling a big move soon.   
If we recapture 9.4k(weekly mid band) and it holds as support I think we will shoot straight up, as it was a [major support](https://www.tradingview.com/x/U9QtaXdT/) point in the entire bull run, which means a lot of people are looking at it. If we break it I would be careful FOMOing though, as we did break it 3 times in february but failed to close above it, the best will be to wait until the weekly closes and build a long term long on the inevitable retest.    
Tbh the current chart kinda looks like the mtgox chart from april 2013.   
However if we dump I will change to cautious at 8.1k and abandon all hope sub-7.6k as this is the 50 week MA. I don't think we can have any hope for a bull run below that MA. Either way decision time is coming soon, the range has tightened to $1.8k.   
Also please keep in mind this is mostly on the weekly chart, so don't be surprised if it dumps first..it always does when I post bullish TA for whatever reason   
Currently 50% btc 50% fiat   
EDIT: now 100% btc after buying 50-day MA, looking to enter margin longs at the weekly tenkan-sen
Opened a small short at 8490 on June futures (roughly 8410 spot at the time) on the bounce after we wicked through the line. 10% 5x. Will be adding if the support line breaks and we hold under. Will bail over 8500 spot.

About to complete symmetrical triangle on the weekly coinciding with 20/50/200 MAs.

I'm so excited for the massive ~~pump I mean dump~~ *nothing to happen probably.* 

###  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
I had quite a large long open from yesterday, it did so well after the mini rally, and overnight as well, that kind of influenced me to add to it quite significantly earlier today. I've been stopped out at break even, and have a small position left over...

Kind of annoyed at myself. Got greedy. Didn't stick to the plan \(which was meant to have my stop lower at 8300\) and have long term trade which I usually never do...

I'm wasting so much time with smaller time frame trades \(which is the majority of trading I do\). Anyway. Not too bad I guess \- got lucky and walking away at break even. Something to add to my lesson book. 
Looks like we are in a small descending wedge, i'm expecting another pump. Maybe not as high as 8650's earlier pump but around that. I will sell ly bags there and probably go short 
Higher low on the 4H time frame was set last night at 8436. We also set a lower high at 8582, indicating possible formation of an equilibrium pattern during consolidation. RSI has nearly reset in the 50's on the 1H chart. 

If we set a new higher low in the next 2 hours, it's more likely than not that the pattern will tighten and we will see a break upward in the next 8 hours or so. 

Current resistance: 8600
Current support: 8436

Bottom of our ascending channel tested and it bounced off only about 40 ish$. We now have our third point of contact if it holds.

A break under $8380 would be a break out of channel and possibly a good place for a short 

On that note, I closed half my short at $8406 and leaving the other half to ride ( entry $8587) 
The idolization of select users in this sub is real. You shouldn't be basing your trades on what they say/their positions. They're just as likely to be right as you are, given you're rational on fundamentals.
You know what, thank you Bitcoin. I was able, while running outside, to fund my online betting account in about 7 min, make a bet (outside my jurisdiction) to live wager the Celtics +14.5 after that awful start.

Edit: For anyone who cannot appreciate the ability to send funds, based on your own free will, and not that of your local Government, with infrastructure that validates in minutes, to a market that is liquid enough to consider it as good as any fiat deposit. Keep downvoting. 
Since all my buys were slightly under 7900 none of them got hit and I have been very patient and not chasing this rally. We'll probably still go down a bit but now I have to figure out where to move my buys up to. I'm thinking 8200 as that has proved to be a very strong support but I'm thinking I should also front run myself. Where do you guys have your buys placed?
Kraken just wicked 8535 out of the blue. Someone fat fingered the buy button?
The volume on GDAX has been absolutely abysmal as of late. When was the last time it was consistently this low? Has the trading just shifted elsewhere or is volume down across the board?
Model price based on tx rate: 7-day average: $4709, 28-day average: $5145.

Explanation is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2hyl9c/daily_discussion_wednesday_october_01_2014/ckxhy9y) with [historical graphs of price vs. model](https://i.imgur.com/HnZQ9rv.png) (last updated 2018-04-09) and [graphs of other correlations](http://imgur.com/a/7koaG) (last updated 2017-01-30). The code is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2oyrfq/code_for_tx_model/) if you want to improve on it.


**Accuracy of model and recent bearishness**

 Note, that this model has been doing relatively well if it is within *the same order of magnitude* of the price. That is to say, it is not a very accurate predictor of price, and to be within a factor of two of the market price (as recently) is effectively no strong signal. However, the prediction did dip just before the recent pop.

**Batching, UTXO count and so on.**

I have seen no convincing evidence that batching is currently a major effect to reduce the daily tx rate, and a cursory examination shows a similar dip in the UTXO network measure.
I am interested, long term, in alternatives to tx rate (given lightning etc) but I do not think UTXO count is a convincing alternative over, for example, unique addresses.
Parsing the blockchain directly for outputs per block is one possible alternative to deal with batching, payment channels notwithstanding.

Watching closely for a bounce here as to protect my short from 8510.xx. 

My next trade will most likely be a long term trade (7+ days) depending on which way we break. All I'm seeing is chop city the next couple days and I've already been lucky enough to scalp my last two trades this week. Don't want to push my luck on the short term.
Dumpy wins the round, Pumpy wins the fight.  That's my prediction. Good night, America.  Have a marvelous day, Asia and Europe.

ETH:BTC broke out of the wedge: [https://imgur.com/a/Clrl6Wv](https://imgur.com/a/Clrl6Wv)
Looks like the hidden bearish divergence is doing it's thing.  And the Inv. H&S we've been watching could just be the head of a much larger one yet to play out: https://www.tradingview.com/x/TReP7IQ3/

Im hoping to long the bottom of the currently forming shoulder!

EDIT: MACD setup looking super similar too: https://www.tradingview.com/x/hYO0NYxW/ 
(and just noticed there is hidden bearish divergence on the 2 hour MACD)
On May 18, around 12:00 UTC, Binance Coin spiked about 25% (I believe it was the best performing crypto last week because of it). This occurred just a few hours after BTC reached a local bottom and had displayed a sudden rise. Does anyone have an explanation for this? (Edit: These are only two observations, there might have been many other things happening simultaneous in the alt-coin space.)
It seems, we just had our "higher low". The slope of the uptrend has changed, but it's still intact.

We might even form another, bigger inverse h&s pattern here.
Falling wedge > Breakout > Bleed out to pre-break out candle price

Not looking too great. 
Chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/siKDU2Cc/

I'm underwater short from 8350. Not trusting this weekend move. High volume dumps during the week and then a dead volume bounce on a Sunday. Current stop condition is 4hr close above 8616. Seeking low 8k high 7k.
Weak volume under the major 8.5k support (turned resistance again?) is not a good look right now if long.  May need a test of 7.9k for a try at a double bottom since there are no other technically meaningful supports below 8.5 and above 7.8k.  But 1D looks like potential H&S which would now correspond symmetrically to a bart back down to 7.2k putting at risk the gains from the BGD in April if it fails to hold.
When do we get a DEX that allows margin trading? I would love to lend out my BTC to shorters and earn more BTC. Should be feasible to lock the collateral in a smart contract that would ensure the lender wouldn't get stiffed right?
Bounced right off the ascending channel support line.

[https://imgur.com/a/WgPGwoS](https://imgur.com/a/WgPGwoS)

If it holds, we'll still form a higher low on the 4 hour and prime us for the next leg up.
Okay everyone we'll all be valueing BTC at 8500USD exactly from now now. No deviation. This is the new Tether v2!
And there we go...there is our 100% retrace of the spike from yesterday.  

Not a surprise.
at least the stock market crash everyone(?) seemed so sure about a month or two ago seems to be totally removed from media attention now. And Dow Jones is up 1% in 20 min today.  If people feel more secure there, they might finally put those tax returns into risky stuff like crypto again.

Could have ramifications for the whole space?

EDIT: OH SHIT, the *flushening* has started
Long stopped for a pizza loss and flipped short at 8350.  Not a great ca for the short.

Sept long that was built with dca last week also stopped out in profit.  I had been planning to take it's profits if we got back below 8400.  Will start building a new one.  The previous buy orders are still there from 7900 and below, might refill it up to 8kish depending on how the next few days goes.  If we don't get low enough I'll just buy the position back.

Edit:  wtf is this shit!  Surprised that the original long would have still been able to have been closed at BE after we broke that support so decisively.

Edit 2: added, raised the ca a tad to 8375.
Let's just all admit it guys, nobody knows what's going on or where this price action will take us. We could be at $20k or $2k this time next year, either price point is equally as plausible and any prediction is no more than a guess at this point.

So in that spirit a show of hands please, by this time next month will we be closer to $10k or $6k per bitcoin?
Question for you guys. So when you all do buys and shorts for a low amount aren’t you all losing money due to the fees?

I use gdax so my fees are small but I have to make at least a certain amount in order to make a proper gain 
Looks like the dump is stalling exactly at a high volume node:

If it falls, the next big one is around 8100. We could see a bounce there.

Starting to regain confidence in the uptrend, looks like bulls might afterall maybe be spared from something that seemed to have been an almost possibility of things going southways. 
We will see a sharp downturn, these two wicks are to fill the order book downside and to prevent shorters from opening shorts by scaring themand to hunt for stops. We are also in an asencing wedge where the wicks perfectly make the resistance line. we brake out of the ascending wedge below around 8505!

In seriousness though, I'm happy to see a retest (as lame as it is so far) of the support line as resistance. The meekness of these movements is not heartening one way or the other, though. 
I think we're looking at a reversal here.

The swing previous to this one experienced a similar divergence (red line with breaks) and the result was a 10% drop.  So we could reach out to some where near the outer limit of the pitchfork which would give us a double bottom reversal point. 

I am hoping the higher low on the weekly chart is in and am looking for this (daily higher low) as confirmation.
Bit concerning in terms of network usage that we are still behind 2016 and 2017 (same time of year). Makes me want to short. Anybody got a take on this?

I'm gonna buy the fuck out of this at $7500, and send the coins offline the instant I can because I surmise somebody's selling coins they don't actually have.
Buyers had their fame and glory yesterday with the BGD. It’s the sellers time to step on stage. 

Just watched that mini attempt by buyers to break up above 8400 but the sellers just said “ sit the fuck back down”. Crazy resistance above 8400 on binance. 

We are flirting way too hard with the support line, so on that note I added to my short at $8390. Now have positions open from the high $8500’s and high $8300’s. 
I don't really know what to make of that shared neckline of the larger IH&S and the subsequent, smaller H&S that formed after.  We keep dicking around just below it now.

Between that and the rising TL from 7925 that squeezing in, any guesses which direction we go next?  Just a gut feeling, but I'm leaning towards the rising support to fail.  No rationale behind it really.  
An assesment Chewy posted about 10 days ago has stuck with me.    [https://imgur.com/a/hLYAEYi11](https://imgur.com/a/hLYAEYi11)

He thought that the longer we went without re\-testing the line but didn't break $11,700 was concerning.

Chewy!  I don't think we have tested that line yet?  Are you still concerned by this?

EDIT: Link and grammar
I wish I could view the order books right now. From the info I have available, it looks like this is a very weak dip? Considering closing my short from 8,545.

Edit: Damn, I am so unbelievably good at posting things like this just seconds before being proven wrong.
BTC is trying to enter an [old rising wedge](https://imgur.com/a/mrc6M9H). It's grinding against the lower bound testing a support turned resistance

Does this pattern still have any relevance since it was broken already and has only a few contact points?
The fractality of the current price action (past few days) to that of late March 2017 is fractalicious. 


Also, if you discount the wick to 6k we are in an inverse head and shoulders on the WEEKLY chart. That is BIGLY.


Here's hopin' Dumpy has enough left in him to bring us to my ultra-secret-algo-predicted third higher low of $7500. Gonna get me summore corn roundabout there, I reckon.  Yessiree
Just added 30&#37; to my long at 8530. Tight stops once again on this addition. Seem we're on the tip of the recent trend line. I'm holding my main position until at least 9k unless I get SL, though I think there is plenty of room to go higher.
Looka like we are breaking down, moment of truth for bulls. If 8370 doesnt hold, it could get ugly very quickly!!
bulls close your eyes...(seriously, I don't want to annoy anyone)

price action is boring as fuck so let's get a 2014 post going to rile some people up. 

I was curious to see what 2014 people were like when they were at our equivalent of $8200-8500 for the last time. Browsed the daily on September 04, 2014 and found a lot of stuff that makes me go hmm

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2ffb17/daily_discussion_thursday_september_04_2014/

The arrow points to the last day it ever hit the ATH % equivalent of ~$8590 ($8500/17.3 = ~$491

Didn't hit this price again until 13 months later (which, admittedly, isn't *THAT* long.)

https://www.tradingview.com/x/d6nXig4w/

##Below is the interaction I'm most interested in. 

It seems I've had this exact conversation with people over the past few weeks with the same exact canned responses from people who have been repeating the same things for years. Is no one else really worried about the fact that to the general public, almost *nothing* has changed since then? All of this institutional money seems to be going into exchanges...you know, those *centralized* things where they make money off volatility?

>So merchant adoption has been happening but with no positive effect on the market, we've learnt from Ecuador that a country is unlikely to adopt Bitcoin when they can just copy the model for themselves (yay open source), widespread adoption for payment processing seems unlikely other than in import/export businesses, is bitcoin's main selling point now as a store of wealth? Or is it possible we have hit market saturation?

in response to this someone said:

> It's really hard to observe day-to-day activities, and translate them into long-term perspectives. In five years, we'll be able to look back at 2014, and easily analyze it.

>**Merchant adoption is progressing, and I suspect it's very early on the adoption curve (i.e. not yet at the "hockey-stick" of the S-curve), but moving forward.** If/when it hits the hockey-stick, businesses will be scrambling to implement Bitcoin payments, like they were scrambling to get websites in the late 90's. But this takes time. **Fortunately, some trail-blazers (like Overstock) are out there, proving that it doesn't hurt, and actually can contribute to the bottom line.** That contribution takes time too. One week of proof is nothing. If Q3 is better than Q2, which is better than Q1, then people start to take notice. If it is better and growing, that will get more attention!

>I think Ecuador's experiment will fail. The analogy is the early-AOL version of networking, when it wasn't connected to the internet. It may help people get comfortable with crypto-currencies, but eventually, it'll prove to be a gateway drug, and it will only help Bitcoin.

>To take a longer-term perspective, look at www.bitcoinpulse.com, and compare now vs. one year ago. And picture what that might look like one year out. Or five.

another in response to the original comment asking about merchant adoption:

> Is this meant to be a parody? Are you making fun of buttcoiners? Or are you actually serious? Just asking.

he says: 

>It is possible to have a negative opinion without being a buttcoiner. I am genuinely serious.

then the guy says

> **Serious answer:**

>**We've not reached saturation. At work the other day, a friend showed me his personal site with a few open source tools for his field of expertise, and I jokingly asked if anybody is sending him donations through the PayPal button. "Isn't it time to set up a Bitcoin button?"**

>**He grinned and said that he needs to figure that stuff out at some point, and two other people nearby began talking about how PayPal fucked them over. These guys aren't queuing up at the diving board, but they do have a bathing suit somewhere.**

OP responds:

>ok but that's anecdotal, and how is bitcoin superior to paypal? bitcoin might fuck you over less as a vendor but it also means the consumer can be fucked over more easily (chargebacks are there for consumer protection). Bitcoin is also slow, it means buying bitcoin which itself poses difficulties for the average consumer, and there are still fees (exchange fees, transaction fees). I can see the protocol being used to transfer value but really it's best at both ends for people to have USD or whatever and bitcoin just be in the middle.

guy says:

>I'm not saying Bitcoin is superior to PayPal, **just that there are people (or at least, one guy at work in a field unrelated to it) who have heard of it, are interested, but have just been too busy to really look into it yet.**

Some other top comments on the daily that will make you question whether or not I'm taking comments from yesterday or 4 years ago:


>http://www.bfxdata.com/swaphistory/btc.php

>Shorts just recently hit 9k on Bitfinex.

>The last time shorts were this high was May 26th.

>Mother of Bull.... For those that don't remember, [this is May 26th
](http://i.imgur.com/BnCVyyF.png)

----
>Not all 9k will be squeezed, but it will be a big move for sure.


---

>Dont try to rationalize this rise.** The big investors have just been fucking with the small guys and laughing all the way to the bank. Let the price fall to build up shorts, create despair, then drive it up. Drive it up high enough to create hope and build longs, then drop it back down. Rinse and repeat, each time pocketing the cash from the weak hands.**

>There is no news. There wont be any news.

---

ahh yes, the rational bear...

>So is this the part of the episode of Bitcoin Markets where they play the happy music jingle as the price pops up $20 in a few hours, and everyone talks about recovery, before yet another slow painful bleed-down? This show is getting really predictable.

---

>**Shorts are playing a dangerous game.**

>http://www.bfxdata.com/combined/btc.php

>BTC swaps spiked back up right after this recent price rise... shorts are doubling down, if the bulls can manage to push things over 500 we could see some fireworks, especially if stubborn bears keep piling on shorts without price sliding down.

---

> Pure speculation here: I think this rise was the first step in a couple of steps up.

---

Emphasis mine in every comment

How does this not bother anyone? It seems virtually identical. What's so different about now?! People aren't using bitcoin, they're not particularly inclined to start using it, and exchanges are just profiting off of fees, not actual bitcoin adoption. I just feel like I'm going crazy wondering "can people really fall for the same thing again?" Is it really different this time...?
After the barting we  now have the long wicks, feels like there is a huge seller on the market for the past 10 days 
Is there anyone that has explored currency arbitrage together with crypto, or is it not worth to look at?  For example, let's say you bought 1 BTC in January for 1000 USD. Now,  let's say EURUSD is up 5% until today , meaning the "purchaing power" of selling for EUR is better than back to USD. 

Or do I think wrong, that the market is correcting this all along on the pairs/ratios so it doesn't matter at all?
Where can I find a sort of “index” or summary of different trading styles / systems. 
Bitmex swaps $30 above mark price, yeesh. 
I think dumpy wins tonight
I'm looking at the ETH/BTC ratio falling again as a signal we are going lower here, lately when the value of that ratio drops so has bitcoins price.
So i see that the price went up to 8650 ish but then down the rabbit hole. In the green again and still holding the short. Kind of getting too comfortable doing so. Seeing some finex & tether fud getting revived...  

Main sentiment not changed, still bearish, trying this «be patient» thing and cutting out this 8K bouncing noice. After a quick look at some charts it seems the direction is down. On mobile so no charts here, sorry.

Short entry 8360. No target for now.
Just a quick thought I had today about ICO "investment" vs trading. The size of all kinds of groups and youtube channels regarding that are magnitudes bigger than pure trading channels and groups. This is because people want free easy money fast, and not put the hard work required into psychology, analytics and risk management that trading requires.

The thing I am wondering about though is, why is not (or few) people considering trading like any other skill? Is the dream of catching the next 100x random crypto so much more fun and interesting ?
Approaching original support line. Crossing it would be very bullish and a sign that our higher low is in on the 4 hr timeframe
Question: when Gemini verifies your account, then do they send you an email? Or do you have to keep logging into your account to check the verification status? Thanks y'all.
Well, how about that! I come back from a relaxing extended weekend of fishing and find that my long from 8500 managed to close at a small gain AND I may conceivably be able to add to my hodlings at a discount. Noice. The best catch is the one you don't expect or particularly care about. 
Market is at 8395 right now. I think this is a great time to put a huge short order with a stop loss at 8410 and take profit at 8k. Will update as price action continues.
Does anyone see an inverse h&s on the 15?

Quite the slugfest. I think Pumpy will win on points.  Dumpy looks like he should have taken the TKO a couple rounds ago.
Could we be in [a rising wedge](https://www.tradingview.com/x/j1BqFuEk/) on the 4HR? 
Would be great to break out of this zone maybe retest 10k.
New week, new world. Good luck gents!

When the foundations of a pump are weak, expect that what it pumped to collapse sooner rather than later. Bears are in control and bulls can barely guard this price point, expecting the price to break down and test $8.2k within mere hours. This doesn't look too good for bulls.
Looks awfully bad for bitcoin, might have been a dcb afterall!
Cheaters never win, and winners never cheat. You can't cheat the blockchain, not the Bitcoin blockchain, anyway, the OG with more computing power behind it than any three governments on Earth combined. You just can't mess with that. The Bicoin market is all about understanding this fact. Dips are temporary attempts by cheaters to distort the market... that's not entirely accurate, but they ARE temporary.  
This is what you call a crash!! Looks pretty ugly for bulls, 8100 possible tonight!!
Somebody's getting their act blown soon..

Going with you on this one (skipped following you on the long because i noticed a line that could be resistance around 8500).

Stops set @8650 but just to try and escape wicks (on Kraken the most it got so far was 8600). Will probably close if we break that resistance line that held us from going above 8500 earlier. This should break either way 12 hours from now the latest when it reaches it's apex @8450 more or less.

Will probably add margin if we hit that line and get rejected.
I think support will hold but not a bad risk\-reward proposition
Was already small short, but I decided to go ahead and commit. We're bear flagging right now, it seems. A break down *should* drop us right to 8300 or so.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/fdPdwsr5/

!short XBTUSD add 8290 90%
Also shorted around the same price, but my target is $8150-$8200, then will reconsider
So did you short the Perpetual Swap or June or Sept futures. Sorry if a dumb question.  You said the rising premium, so I am assuming June.


unfortunately it looks just like distribution too, I think this sub is biased towards thinking everything is accumulation, but you can't really tell until after 
Yes. This is the perfect time for long term holders to buy in.

Buy and forget.
What price point/behavior would entice you into taking a short position?
I would expect a daily higher low in the 8200-8300 region before pushing 8880 for a daily higher high.

Bulls might need some time to recharge before pushing this higher.
How much fees do you typically pay for each buy/sell order? Do you factor trading fees into the gains/loss for each trade?
We got to test 8150 again, been short since 8510. But we do have one more large leg up (around 10k) before another 6-8 months of gradual down trend. This market is trading almost identical to 2014-15. 

Short term trades are super risky right now.
Yeah I tought I saw everything but altcoins bleeding slowly  after bitcoin BGD yesterday? What the hell is going on? Noone can trade because of exchange KYC stuff?
Nice entry
also quite clear pin bar ( http://priceaction.com/price-action-university/strategies/pin-bar/ ) on last two 1h candles, showing that all dips are bought up. 

The big question is , do we get a BGD or BRD when  a move comes :D


What do you think about [this](https://imgur.com/a/mrc6M9H)?
>none of this stuff matters at all

and afterwards it is always so obvious. "how could I have not seen that coming?"
defo, my most successful months of trading was just trading something as basic as horizontal support and resistances, literally two lines on the chart and thats it. But thats a little tough to do right now when price barely moves
I agree that less can be more (and certainly more time-efficient) in trading, though I want to keep an open mind and keep learning.

My "toolbox" has (so far) consolidated to: horizontal support/resistance, trend lines, volume, RSI, 50/100/200 MAs and Fibonacci retracements.

Only in recent weeks have I started to appreciate the latter two, but now I am firmly convinced that many price movements cannot be properly understood without also looking at MAs and Fibs.
I've yet to see long term oscillators lie. Formations painted by bots otoh...
What time frames have you been looking at?
If you place any weight on BBands, might interest you/us that they haven't been as tight since May 10, right before the $1,000 drop.
If we're continuing up, that was todays dip.
Me too, same spot.  Though I don't think we have far up to go if we go back up (maybe visit 8600 again).  I think medium term we still head to the bottom of the giant symmetric triangle before we meet its top.
I covered my short and went long here, but just trying scalp a short bounce.  My stop would be about $8399.  You are willing to lose 4% of your money if the price drops...not saying it's good or bad, but I would never do that.

EDIT: Ok that didn't last long and closed that out quickly with about 0.15% loss.
Sand Hill road is VCs, not pensions / endowments / sovereign funds.

But anyway, sure, pump it like a trumpet.
The thing is i imagine financial institutions are looking at this more like a gold rush. The exchanges are the people selling the shovels. It makes much more sense that legacy institutions would likely get in by taking a %age from people and giving themselves exposure that way. Maybe im totally wrong though...
Sauce?
I’d add to the above that this past weekend's edition of Barron's - which is read by virtually the entire financial community - ran a feature story on BTC titled:

"Bitcoin’s Price Drop Doesn’t Scare the Big Money" (linked, but pay wall)

https://www.barrons.com/articles/bitcoins-price-drop-doesnt-scare-the-big-money-1526688001

Agree fully with the sideways movement in price and same too with 3-9 month time frame. No matter how quickly these players want to enter/expand, they need to check a whole lot of boxes internally before getting the approval to actually move forward. 
I can't see pension/endowment funds touching crypto with a barge pole in the short or even medium term.
I’m not 100% sure but the way I see this is that it shows that selling pressure has subsided.
Here's a possibility: Maybe it's not decreasing volume. Maybe it's a more accurate representation of volume.  Maybe it's a deliberate deflation (fakenews) of the reported number.

I look at the trade history, and I see lots of trades scrolling by, some for large volumes.

I wouldn't put too much stock in the reported volume numbers. Your average coder will fudge them for a few grand.  Bottom line: you can't eff with the blockchain.  The record of real transactions is immutable.  The market will eventually reach equilibrium.  Don't keep your coins on exchanges. Buy and send to cold storage.
The bull runs have been preceded by long periods of sideways near local lows with low volume.

Some believe this $8k sideways with dumps to $6k is similar to going sideways at $200-300 with dumps to $160. 

the main difference is after the last dump to $160 btc went literally parabolic over two months which was a massive increase in volume. it wasn't up and down like now, it was sideways almost straight into a parabola blow off top to $500 
I was just coming to check if you had updated stops/status. I'm probably all but guaranteeing getting stopped for a smaller gain than just closing, but I reduced position by 25% here and set stops in profit up a little ways just in case. 
Smart move, chewy!  
What? Buyers are batshit insane?
This really doesnt mean anything as people dont buy or sell bitcoin on Mex. The premium (or discount) on Mex is taken into account when funding occurs every 8 hours.
So this means someone is either building a massive long or closing a massive short?
Bitfinex spiked to over $8630 twice and BitMEX stayed below $8600 both times.

But generally you are correct.
Holy cow, what is causing ze damp? Which one of u boys bought some corns?
Hopefully you will refrain from making silly price calls in the future.
The peace of mind is worth it.
are you still trading on Bitfinex as a corporation, or did they send that to former US customers as well?
California is so fucked, highest capital gain tax in u.s. yikes
I trade in Florida which has no state income tax. Feels good to follow the law and not pay additional taxes 
It's not about paying your taxes or not. It's about not having gov't officials in your business for trading digital tokens.  

And your advice to just "follow the laws" doesn't work very well for people in China and India...and Iran, and Zimbabwe and many other countries.  Because doing anything with crypto currency is illegal there.

It's great if you are fine with following all the current regulations and any that are arbitrarily created in the future.  But some people are not and they aren't necessarily "greedy" to think that way.

I pay all my taxes and do not appreciate being interrogated by exchanges for just trying to trade, when I am doing nothing wrong.
2300 BTC 3m candle out of bots?

Explode which way is the million dollar question.
Does finex or any of the other exchanges have a replay function so we can see a re-run of what happened?
It's a goddamn feeding frenzy over there. 

I'm personally sticking with the assumption that they're just fucking retarded, but that doesn't change the fact that it's happening. 
Extending the top line has it touch at 13k as well.

Also, !long XBTUSD close 8450

Back to fiat. Skeptical of the weekend rise and I've been away from charts so taking my profit and running. Going to reevaluate when I get the chance, don't really think the bear trend has been exhausted yet though. May end up just rebuying though.
That's fine and I'll continue to profit on the noise, as I have been.
Well you can imagine volume cannot decrease below zero.  With so many bots trading the space though you gotta figure there’s a bare minimum until their owners take them offline.

The low volume right now is no surprise though, ETH is nearing the end of a daily equilibrium pattern, market is very undecided.  This week is likely to determine the rest of the year for the market depending on how ETH breaks this equilibrium pattern.

If ETH and BTC break bullish, we’ll see higher highs in ETH throughout the summer and BTC will be leaning bullish on its weekly equilibrium pattern looking to break late summer i would guess.
I'd like to add to this fine fellow's question, is it even possible to trade for a living?
Yes part time at first to learn the ropes and then eventually quit crapy wageslave job and went to trading full time.
A higher low compared to the next low, yes...
What in the hell is happening on BFX right now? Price just whiplashed from 8390-8430 like 4 times, then flatline.

I accumulate more daily
It’s a bunch of “ bottom “ feeders that buy the dip and and sell when the pressure moving up stops.

The old bitcoin during bullrun was buy the dip, buy today, buy now, buy at any price, sell your soul and left pink toe nail to buy more BTC. Now, buyers buy the dip and when the price gets to a certain point there’s just 0 buying and sellers pounce all over it 
I actually still use it to buy stuff, I buy exactly what I need at current market price and then spend it all immediately.
> will make a strong case for a massive iH&S on the daily if bulls are able to sustain a trend reversal for a week or two.

I really think that bulls need to be really consistent over here (which seems so be the case in the past few days), so long they hold this for a little longer as you said, it will confirm the reversal of the pattern (which will be highly beneficial for the bulls).

The longer the bulls hold this, the quicker the market will move out of this uncertain environment.

Two of the best resources I've come across are: 

CryptoCred's stuff (https://twitter.com/CryptoCred/status/984888077150810113)

What exactly do you want to know?
Yea...it said my order was "in a few seconds"
Would like to see an informed reply to this aswell...
Performance of alts vs Bitcoin is random as far as I can tell. You'll always have a couple that out perform it when you look at short periods of time. Comparing on longer periods of time, only a few really stand out. Binance coin is no exception.

tl;dr; Zoom out.
They announced that those who hold over 500 BNB will get double referral payouts. There was a big pump yesterday because of it and seems like another small one today. 
yes 
It was sell into sell wall
2 weeks
It's sell for btc because of the excessive movements you mentioned. They trigger sell signals on moving averages. 
I've also noticed stocks and btc kind of tracking each other. But it's weird because btc kind of looks like it's leading and I don't see how that's possible so maybe it's just a coincidence. https://www.tradingview.com/x/1kAzxOtq/

I do think that a bear market in stocks would be bad for btc though, and it seems like the trade war is over so maybe stocks will continue their bull run which would be bullish for btc.
You're gonna have a bad time running a bot on $100.
I'd use Binance. Low fees if you use BNB, high volume. With $100 you may run into some issues with the 0.002 BTC order minimum, depending what you'd trying to accomplish. 
I think bitmex has a test net / api you can use so you can work the bugs out for free
I would recommend BitFinex for the kind of pilot test you want to run with your bot. Moreover, I think can offer the best environment for your bot to learn as it is the leader in exchanges. All the best! :)
Bitmex
It has almost doubled in 20 hours, was as low as 10K when I saw it.
it's frustrating innit? They're so eager to buy low but no one wants to take it  higher. it's like...what's your guys' plan here?! 


I'm hoping so. Futures premium might finally come back to earth. 
maybe Binance knows something we don't know about tether? Fuck....
next two weeks are critical.
Two weeks is like a crypto year 
You're referring to the rising channel support from the $7930 low right?  It's holding perfectly so far.
Chew, you in a position?
Interesting, seems like a lot of wave-1 is very applicable here, though I'm sure these type of scenarios can be flipped to fit various market conditions. 

is there any quantification for wave-1? Any particular price/percentage increase it needs to reach to validate itself?

*checks number of transactions and size of recent blocks*

Seems like Bitcoin Legacy is the big block coin after all.
>  I'm talking 100%+ gains

God I hope so, that'd be awesome. 

Really nice analysis on a time-frame not often used. Thanks!
Same here, although seems like it would be just as logical to open a long here - although I suspect the upwards movement if we stay above won't be nearly as quick as the downwards movement if we convincingly break below.
ya it's kind of wild how fast it's getting rejected. I really can't remember the last time I saw market sells so quick to act (multiple times in a row)
Or it's two great bargins before a large rally. Perhaps they know something we don't?
Maybe desperate bears try to show this uptrend as fake.
How did you draw your upper trendline? 
So that should signal a continuation of the long term up trend? 

Edit: wording
as one of my favorite traders Richard Dennis says, keeping strategy and psychology is all

>“I don’t think trading strategies are as vulnerable to not working if people know about them, as most traders believe. If what you are doing is right, it will work even if people have a general idea about it. I always say you could publish rules in a newspaper and no one would follow them. The key is consistency and discipline.”


I think for short term targets, it's best to avoid adding to it when it's looking good, unless it's near the beginning at confirmation time.  Missed a lot of profits that way.
This is a classic mistake I make.  When ever i get to the point where Im adding to a winning position is usually when i should be taking at least 50% off the table.

I now try to identify that *greedy* urge and do the opposite!

Like you say, at least you didn't lose any capital.  On to the next one.  If this continues down you should be able to get a nice long entry tomorrow or the day after!
I think my limitation is I'm just not used to trading large positions, at some point a trades changes my thought process and I become less analytical and much more emotional \- especially on larger positions which I've been trying to do more these days \(ahem hence all the tight stops\).

There is a point at which I start checking on the price more and more often, and get drawn in. And then I realize I'm getting a bit too obsessed. I never seem to grasp this transition point.
Short term trades require a somewhat different mindset. The take profit must be executed without mercy, even when you see the price rise another 5%, if it already hit your mark take it off the table.

Also, re-adding to a position on the 1h must be done at the 1m range not after the trade goes your way 3 hours later.

Its also hard to move from entering positions with a ladder of bids to a strategy of opportunistic market buying, and from stop loss order to "finger on the button" action. People believe day trading is like swing trading when in reality is/should be a lot more like scalping.
Is this the one you're talking about?

I was in a similar boat, closed my short at a loss at 8330 cancelled my orders between 7800 - 8000 and went all in. Sometimes shit happens bro :/
Or general lower liquidity.
Kraken has this quite a few times actually if you check the charts. One more reason to use manual stops there instead of automated. Large Buy/Sell orders can give some nasty wicks.
their volume tanked after they added bch (end of Dec) and they  recently increased taker fees. 

Not to mention a lack of interest in trading spot over derivatives (mex volume increased significantly since $5.9k, people realized u can make a lot of money shorting)

and just a general sluggishness in terms of btc interest right now 
Mind elaborating on this position when you get the chance? (Believe you’re supposed to elaborate more when stating positions like this, but what do I know). 
!short XBTUSD 8490 5x 20%
Went long here, super tight stops below the support line. I might regret this.

!long xbtusd 8390 10X 80%
Imho stay away from poloniex, heard nothing but bad things from them as many customers have complained about having their funds stuck and not being able to withdraw anything. A quick Google should show lots of their problems. Wouldn’t touch it with a 10 foot pole

Lolwut @ your last line

> im literally leveraging borrowed money 
are you trying to get made fun of right now?
the devil is in the details/fineprint... read last sentence
I'm not very risk averse myself. However leveraging borrowed money seems to be asking for trouble no matter how sure you are. Hope your right for you and your lenders sake. Good luck I wish I was as sure as you about the future.
Point 3 made me realise what type of post this is. Classic date antics. 
Kaktus dont be a dumbass and do the same mistake i did, at least cut the leverage. If you think youre rekt now, just wait until youre rekt with debt! Not fun.
how did you lose everything?
You should be looking at march 2018 
That’s a very bold claim.
The bottom was likely in February. The market is just still figuring it out, letting out some steam.
Lol was that insane wick a flashcrash on bitflyer or is that an artefact on the chart?

Wonder why bitcoin tries to juke you out every which ways.  How can we establish any trust if you keep breaking them?
Is that all those weak bears could do? Was hoping for 8170 at least, disappointed. 
High volume dumps? What?
It was 8k BTC on gdax while it was at 8.3k and when it dropped to 7.9k it was 8.5k volume on gdax 
Weak selling is not a good look right now if short either... Non-trading day.

Uhm, why should I admit to something that doesn't apply to me? I exactly know what's going to happen next and I always have known what was about to follow. I was and am usually wrong about it, but what matters is that in that moment, I knew. And nobody could or will ever tell me that I don't or didn't!
If you use limit orders on MEX, they actually pay you. 
I don't use any exchanges that charge a standard fee for trading.  They are all % based.  So low amount or high amount are all the same.  % is what matters.
Depends on your trading style/frequency and whether you trade swaps or futures which have different fee structures. For myself (and this is a poor trading style lol) I frequently open and close positions, eating the fees, until I land on a winning position that makes up for it. But I also trade with higher leverage than most here (and have suffered the consequences).
Many here are trading on BitMEX, where you actually get paid 0.25% if you buy/sell with a limit order. If you do that on the futures, you also have 0 rolling fees. However, you have the risk of a premium (or negative premium), if the future price diverges from spot price.
GDAX has 0&#37; maker fees.  Are you placing market orders?  
Can we name you? Our own very native troll? Like a Mascot?

What ascending channel? We just broke out of a descending channel.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/W4JxTlIp/
After longing the support and having it look like a nice entry, then flipping it to a short when it broke support, just to see it retest it as resistance and then break through on the second attempt, to see this seizure candle break back down, I could use some meth.
> oversold on multiple timeframes

RSI is like 50 on the 1 day and 4 hr and around 35 on the 1hr. That's not really oversold at all.
Also sitting pretty comfy on my 8050 long. Hopefully this new higher low holds, because it would be a great spot to move my stop loss up to ;)
You feel good about a $200 drop against your position?   I guess to each his own, but if was me, I would have been frustrated with myself for not selling that spike.  However, I've been guilty of overtrading before, I know many just swing trade.   Also, if you can't sit there and monitor the market all the time, that is probably a better strategy.
"whales are accumulating"? 
Anyone here think it's wash trading? i.e. place massive sell wall then place a market order?

To entice shrimps like us
I am making of it that I should stick with my short position here.  There spikes are being sold off immediately and totally.  
We might go higher first but Bears are still there and will try to bring it down at some point \- sooner rather than later. 
Where are you getting these values from? 
A shit post?

Buyers are coming back for more too, it would appear. This is nuts.
highly doubt it's going to work out this way now, yet of course it is possible 

RSI and STOCH look good/not that bad on almost any time frame, BBANDS don't look bad either

still think btc will go to 9000 first as it's the target from the inverted H&D before having any decent drop

edit: it seems to me as bulls are just taking a short break before pumping it up again; 8470 as of the moment of writing now and not expecting it to go much lower
Yeah I also still had the resistance from the symmetrical triangle for a couple of weeks ago and it seemed to perfectly coincide with the wicks  that got sold into almost immediately. 

I'm torn, things could go both ways again here, though I'm not considering a reversal until we break 8400. 

Nice analysis! 
I agree, am looking for low 8's to come soon before a move back up and a push into at least the 9's within the next week or two.
This could be fee related. Doesn't mean people aren't using the network, they may just be consolidating into fewer addresses to avoid dust-related fees.

>Actually there is a very good reason for Bitcoin-backed banks to exist, issuing their own digital cash currency, redeemable for bitcoins. Bitcoin itself cannot scale to have every single financial transaction in the world be broadcast to everyone and included in the block chain. There needs to be a secondary level of payment systems which is lighter weight and more efficient. Likewise, the time needed for Bitcoin transactions to finalize will be impractical for medium to large value purchases.

>Bitcoin backed banks will solve these problems. They can work like banks did before nationalization of currency. Different banks can have different policies, some more aggressive, some more conservative. Some would be fractional reserve while others may be 100% Bitcoin backed. Interest rates may vary. Cash from some banks may trade at a discount to that from others.

>George Selgin has worked out the theory of competitive free banking in detail, and he argues that such a system would be stable, inflation resistant and self-regulating.

>I believe this will be the ultimate fate of Bitcoin, to be the "high-powered money" that serves as a reserve currency for banks that issue their own digital cash. Most Bitcoin transactions will occur between banks, to settle net transfers. **Bitcoin transactions by private individuals will be as rare as... well, as Bitcoin based purchases are today.**

You seem like a smart dude. My order is set. Now it's time to sit back and chill and hope you're right.
Good timing.
We’re pretty much in no mans land. Gotta see if we violate the trend line with force before making any move. Lack of a bounce isn’t promising though
link don't work for me :(
Link still not working. 
The longer we don't break $10K is concerning as well...also $9K...at least if you are long, or if you are a holder.  If you are a trader, then it's not really a significant concern at all.
Dip hasn't started yet.  Keep an eye on the reversal H&S on the 1 Hour (we're in the right shoulder now).  If that completes we *might* get a dip.

I say *might* cos they can complete and then not follow through.  ETH's is much closer to confirmation.
hmm hard to say, would be interesting if it does manage to pop inside and then see how price reacts to the top of the range. As of now, while it's still below, I'd say not too relevant. 
wow this is a very interesting chart, thanks.
NICE spot.  On the other hand, if you're a glass half empty type of guy and you include the wick it could be an Inv. Cup with handle, indicating a continuation of the trend down from 20k -6k.

Tomato tomato
Yea, I don't think it works that way, lol.  We had a much better chance of iH&S on the 1d the last time we were rallying from 6k.
How are we in an inverse h&s on the weekly chart?
But seriously, how many coins did Bitfinex have in its wallet? Can anyone answer this?
Do the Bartman.

Looks like bulls could be in Deep Deep Trouble.

(Showing my age)
AutoMod took this down. Might be worthy of a self-post, anyway.
Long wicks are still barts on a 1 second graph.
After transaction costs at market rate its tough but some algos do it
Premium on June futures is also rising while index is falling. 

Futures traders are 100% certain this will bounce. More certain than I've seen them in awhile. 

Anecdotally, the more certain Bitmex traders are of movement in a given direction, the more likely it will move the opposite direction.
I think you're right. I think he wins this week. Hope so anyway. I'm in buy-the-dip mode.
Or bitcoin is starting to suck the alts dry
The ratios have been out of whack throughout this barting period or whatever you want to call it.  LTC/ETH won't move while BTC fluctuates, one will pump, no change to BTC.   Shoot me.  
I’m honestly a bit surprised to see BTC up here still at this point using alt performance as a metric. ETH/BTC ratio has been dropping for a full day now, and it seems the only alts outperforming BTC now are TRX, NEO, and ONT. Not exactly inspiring, yet we are holding up $8400 rather nicely so far.
Thanks for the comment, kind of helped me with my decision, went short at 8380 for 5x my stack and loving what the result has been.
Eth tanking seems like a sign it is gonna rekt. Eth ratio is going down pretty quick now too..
[deleted]
presumably the reason is because these people are hoping to find the next Bitcoin/Ethereum/whatever and get in on the ground floor, rather than trying to predict or guess the tops or bottoms of a somewhat established market.
I got an email
Just FYI when I signed up in December it took less than 24 hours to get verified. When a family member did so in feb, it took them over a month to verify.
Just a fyi, fees are high on Gemini now.
> time to put a huge short order with a stop loss at 8410

Look at this fish in a barrel. 
What makes you think it's going to 8k?
Yeah but I'm like 90% sure those are reversal patterns, not continuation.
I'd be wary of anything on the short time charts tbh. Make sure you look for other signals to confirm!
what alts are you looking at ? The top 5 on Binance are doing sideways if something...
I stil have some room in my wedge to go down, maybe test 8400-ish, but we haven't violated the trendline of our upmove yet.

Moreover if the IH&S plays out, we should be headed towards 8800 or so, and it would coincide nicely with the horizontal resistance there, plus overlap with the fractal of our descent from 11.7k 

Chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/Xcyvlo1d/
A scam. The trade range MEX will allow the market to operate inside of during the given week.

/s (sort of)

As best I understand it, in order to come out ahead, the market would have to overshoot the close prices by double-digit percentages. I don't understand why anyone trades them.

I don't understand the downvotes. While its actually a fact. 
imo Bitfinex is gearing up for a huge exit strategy, as they know they are not able to prove they are liquid on their Tether to secure all the value they transact and keep of their costumers in case of panic in the market..

That we made it through Sunday dip free was deeply encouraging.
If anything, the last 24 hours of movement has been less barty than what we have been seeing recently 
That moment when you can downvote without reading the comment :\)

You are my favorite bipolar trader.
##Rude!
lol what a bullshit analysis. Price is determined by supply and demand not hashpower which by the way isn't *computing* power just dumb  sha256 hashing machines, you can have the fastest network in the universe for some stupid isolated task like hashing but if people don't need it/use it or don't care the price will reflect that.

It's nice that the network is secure and part of it's fundamentals but you need use cases not hashing power to increase demand lack of thereof is what causes the price downward trends, not "cheaters" (whatever that is in your mind).
How strange it is that you sound just like DushmanKush. Same comment style, same mannerisms and same not-all-that-clever trolling. You've just tweaked it enough to make it not quite so obvious but still seems pretty obvious.
Do you honestly think this looks like a crash , that was a 1.3% drop x)
Buyers on June futures seem to be lining up to lose money here. It's uncanny.

Either they know something I don't, or they are protecting large long positions from farther down.
nice
For how much longer would be my follow-up question.

I don't doubt that there's probably a greater than 50% chance that this will bounce right now, but to what end? 

Perhaps buyers have enough momentum to push through $8,600, but there's still $8,800 to contend with after that. And then $9,000 and $9,400. 

These $200 candles that retrace 100% of the movement over the next 24 hours don't exactly exude confidence.
Im not expecting this to bounce properly until 1 hour RSI hits oversold conditions, it's at 40 right now.  It was just overbought at 77 for the first time since our peak at 9990.  
Yes, June. 

Although somebody else pointed out that the perpetual swap was trading $30 above mark price at around the time I shorted.
I’ve never thought about it as distribution
Buy and forget that you used to have money. 
[deleted]
At this point, I wouldn't feel compelled to short unless $7,800 fell with conviction.

Buyers are still frantically buying the dip with $11,700+ in the back of their minds. This may be a delusional fantasy, but they'd really need to have their spirit broken completely in order to make a short position really worth pursuing. 

Of course, I say that now. I could very easily change my mind if a good opportunity presents itself. For example, a strong push up past $8,600 that stops dead in its tracks at $8,800. That's a fairly likely outcome in the short to medium term, and might be a good spot for a short.
I'm still trading the Bitmex June futures, where the fee structure is negligible. 

Taker fees (market orders) are just .075%, whereas maker fees (limit orders) actually pay out .025%. 

I've been placing a lot more market orders than I'd like lately, but they still don't have much of an effect on my gains. 
I'm watching this support line for another touch point. 

https://imgur.com/a/OC5Q5x5

If it breaks, then buyers could be in trouble. 
I don't have the time to put together anything official charts, but I've noticed when BTC/ETH pump and alt coins pump, we are in a bull market and when BTC/ETH pump but alt coins remain stagnant/bleed out, we are in a sideways/bear market. Alts pumping when BTC/ETH gained was an indicator in early April that we were in for a decent short-term bull market.
Yep. But if you go throughh historic data looking at bull/bear flags, or movements into the ichi cloud etc, you can find just as many examples of them not playing out as expected.

Like, what use is an ichi cloud for example, if the price turns around and goes back out the way it came just as often as it goes edge to edge?


What use are bull flags when they break down more often than up during down trends?

I have noticed MA's correlating with bounces (only because Binance shows  them by default), but I haven't really delved into that rabbit hole.

Fibs sound like hocus-pocus to me to be honest, never really looked into them. Although I notice many here seem to like using them.
All of them. I was just ranting about the cloud bit, but I assume I can find examples of being in/above/rejected by the cloud right now if I have about 12 timeframes to choose from.


I close positions early if I think it’s necessary. I mainly just set it so I don’t have to stare at the charts all day. 
How does one trade BTC confidently with stops less than 1%?
Both Novogratz [and myself] have been on Sand Hill road. I'm aware. 

It's a standalone point.
you aren't wrong. they are just in it for your fees.
Probably the latest Unconfirmed podcast. I listened to it and that's basically the gist of what he was saying
It's probably more. During December, bitfinex was turning over >100 billion per month. 

These are the numbers for if they were "only" doing 70 billion per month.

https://i.imgur.com/nhwXgiR.png

= 90-140 million revenue, estimated. Per month.

If I had to guess, I'd say Bitfinex took home 400-500 million last year. And already cleared 400-500 million so far in 2018.

Unconfirmed.
It has not.  Somebody has a lot of coins to dump.  Where did they get them, and are they actual coins or credit on exchanges? That's the trillion-dollar question.
yes but how about the counter buying pressure? Captain Obvious says buy > sell for price to go higher
Yes I've seen with my own eyes, the insane wash trading going on at Binance. 
Thank you for you reply. Funny I held BTC through all those price actions but since I was so down and was ready to hold to zero, I never paid attention to the charts or volume. Even at $500 I was still down quite a bit since I bought in Dec 2013. 

Only difference that concerns me is BTC's parabolic rise has already played out mainstream and dissected by every talking head so the awareness is out there however we keep going down in volume which to me shows less interest. Hope I am wrong.
The bot isn't picking up my PM's or comments for some reason. 

But ya, I'm going to sleep a whole lot better tonight out of position than in one.


In general, there's nothing particularly crazy about buying btc.

Today though, the buying behavior was flat out bizarre. 

Buyers failed multiple times to break $8,600. 

Sellers pushed through multi-day support. 

Yet buyers persisted regardless. 

Read it as indisputable evidence of strong bullish support if you want. You do you. 

But I see it as fleeting and misguided fomo. 
We're breaking through support lines and buyers are ferociously buying the dips even though there's little incentive to here. They're behaving irrationally based on the data at hand. Regardless, they're doing it, and being short here is risky. 

These differences are not corrected by just finding rates, that just takes care of the residual. 

Bots and market makers position themselves in a way to profit off the divergence in price between the underlying exchanges. 
Likely not someone but masses of people, the price action sentiment and leverage combination feeds off itself. 
Better question: Who's selling?  Not me.  I'm rubbing my palms together hoping to buy at my expected fire-sale price.
Yes,I am trading there as a corporation.
If you are doing nothing wrong, then open your anus so they can see for sure. /s
idk, I really don't, but what are the chances dozens of traders decided to market buy and sell at the exact same time randomly like that. it looked like they were all reacting to each other

anyway I finally added to my short here. just a small amount, probably premature and I'll stop it out at $8650.  I was gonna add at $8530 last night but fell asleep :( 

hidden bear div 2-12h (even a tiny one on 1d), futures soaring while we go sideways, longs were at 24k at $9k before the first push to $9.6k and are now at 32k which means there are a decent amount of longs underwater
Bad algo someone just lost there stack.lol
You can pull the whole order history on finex but it’s not pretty. There may be a third party tool that’d make it easier. Tradingview also has a reply function built in somewhere. 
I wish. that'd be awesome. Someone really needs to stream 24/7 so we can have historical data. it would be so fun to watch. 
Finally maybe breaking down.

A couple of hurdles:

1. Variable income: One month you could make $10K, while the next month you could lose $5K. 

2. Grocery stores, landlords, coffee shops, etc don't generally accept BTC. So you're going to have to sell btc on a regular basis to pay bills and to fund your life. Depending on the country you're in, this would be a huge pain in the ass from a tax standpoint. 

3. It can be boring as shit sometimes. In order to be profitable, you might have to sit and stare at your monitor for 8 hours and do absolutely nothing. 
At least I'm not hallucinating.  (sometimes when I switch back to the cryptowatch tab, it does bounce around when the rendering kicks back in)
Same here. Little and often.
In fact, if you switch to the monthly chart this looks a lot more like a bull flag than a bear flag.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/dbYNHUBh/
well daily volume has been consistently decreasing since mid March and we’ve been in a  fairly horizontal channel since then. This could just be an indication of big movement in either direction. (neither bullish nor bearish until something happens)

But since this is following the fall from ATH in December, it could be seen as bullish since volume is drying up after months of correcting down.
You expect to see decreased volume in all formations as volatility drops, the symmetric triangle tightens, and BBands tighten. The drop in volume is irrelevant. It just shows that the market is uncertain.

If it's a bear trend then you need to see lower lows at some point. We haven't seen that in a long time.
Thank you kindly my good man, I've got those links bookmarked.
I've got some basic knowledge on how to read candle sticks...so basically nothing! Lol 
Genius way to get your customers to do marketing for you 
Just test money pal before I put anything behind it. Thought the margin would be an idea to simulate larger trades without actually risking money during development. What would you recommend as capitalisation ?
Cheers pal,
Just had a look through the API and it's very similar to GDAX, thinking I could just swap out the engine and it might work. Do they have a test net for checking API connections/commands?
Cheers pal, are they legit just read a couple of threads about a 200mhz server lol. I'll have a look through their API.
Found fair market, guys
Well that just means everyone is wising up to 8.5k as overpriced, right?
(?) It's just a Tether competitor with better transparency. Doesn't mean there's anything wrong with tether (aside from what we already know of course).

Yes, I currently have it drawn at around $8,370. 

Basically, if buyers don't step the fuck up immediately, it'll break down.
Nope, I opened a long this morning at around $8,450 but closed it at $8,500 when buying pressure abated and selling pressure intensified.

Yes, I could have. But I didn't.

Edit: Now I did.
> they're trolling for viewers in an attempt to stay relevant and avoid going broke.

Every cable news outlet is doing the same thing. 

For real news, watch PBS Newshour. High quality journalism every night of the week. 
CNBC is definitely pro bitcoin cash, they have ver on there all the time.  But novorgratz likes to pump bcoin legacy, so it's pretty fair and balanced.

I switched back to using BCH after the fork.  The mining fee is less than a penny and now you usually get confirmations in less than five minutes.  I had gone back to BTC for awhile, but was an easy choice to go with BCH again, at least for now.

BTC mining fees are very low (but not nearly as low), but confirmations take longer.  But it's not a nightmare like it was late last year.
Savage burn
thanks, weird you're getting downvoted. i think the bear-patrol just paid us a visit.  
hope people will let me know if i overlooked anything important in the weekly chart instead of just downvoting. i'm an amateur after all so feedback is appreciated.
Seems likely. I'm already basically back at my entry. As chew has mentioned, buyers are frenetic recently and pump out of nowhere, make shorting very difficult. At the same time we have abysmal volume and drops like the one we just had. At this point I'm basically just hedging some fiat value. 
Yeah, upward is a struggle back to 8.6, downward is speed to 8k or more.  Because where we are now is the potential higher low.
People market selling at 8560, and no one selling at 8530. wow, that's a pretty strong rejection
They are showing it pretty well then.  100% retrace of both of those spikes.  They are being shrugged off as nothing.

But price still holding at about $8500, so seems like a stalemate for the moment.
From 03/20/17, touching at 04/09/18 and last week. You could draw it starting from 07/10/17, but that makes it less of a symmetrical triangle and only garners an extra week for the pattern to exist, so I would consider this line more valid.

I'm not convinced that this pattern will actually result in any significant price movement, hence why I asked the question a few days back as to how significant this coinciding of lines was. Didn't get any answers which is disappointing as I'm pretty sure there's something to be learnt here. 
Good quote, that one!
I suffered huge losses when I was actually correct and picked the bottom, 3 times, but wouldn't trust myself. Search for "Mark Douglas" on youtube. Helped me out a lot.
My rule is that if I worry i am overinvested. If you have 1% worry it will influence your strategy so never be. Just sell 10% of the position, then 10% more until you have 0% worry. 

It's quite similar to sports like martial arts. if you ever are worried about getting hit, you will think more about avoiding to get hit that to hit your opponent and can not focus

True, but blow outs in Boston games 1&2. They have been home money for the entire playoffs. So who knows, but a fighters chance, for sure. 
Yes, but they usually follow the pump/dump from other exchanges.
Haven't seen one of this happening just on Kraken for a while
> they recently increased taker fees.

No? Their intro taker fees have always been .3%, unless you're talking about the higher fees that few people (bots) could get to.
Right, sorry I was a bit lazy. Double bottom at 8430, the neckline of the iH&S has been tested. Small hidden bull div on the hourly, and RSI has cooled off enough to revisit the top of the rising wedge.

Sounds plausible. Good find.

They can do the equal, it is simply that the power seems to have been shifted.

Plus, everyday is not Sunday. Seems like 8170 is long gone.
Right, but the sellers have the advantage that it is still a bear market; gravity and price bias is still downward on a macroscale (weekly/monthly charts).  Basically, the bulls have a much bigger onus to prove their case than short sellers right now until ATH is broken.  Longs need to create the bull market which will only happen with increased buying, shorts don't have to do anything, the market is with them as a whole until some large time scale bullish pattern finally confirms with volume.
I will look into it

Of course! These crash patterns do tend to follow a similar structure though.  Same thing over and over again *until it doesn't and we get the moonening instead*

It's an invitation to admit, not an order, so think what you like. 

I'm just making the point that everyone is guessing, and no matter how educated the guess is, it's a guess. Then I have invited people to guess high or low, without the need of backing the guess up with lines on a chart or jargon. Simple as that.
Thank you all for the replies and I haven’t used the limit and stops yet I’ve been doing it manually atm I wanted to see how everyone else was doing and see what I should do

Well I was reading the info about it and it said something about if it has to be spread then it won’t go through. So I feel like it’s not gonna be as good compared to allow taker? Or maybe I’m wrong

Could be an actual rejection here, potentially.

You don't even need a microscope to see it.
Just read the latest comments. Bulls everywhere. We are swimming against the current it seems. 
The Inv. H&S is legit. But the volume profile isn’t right. No follow through *yet*. I think a nice well defined higher low would give buyers confidence and make the next leg up easier.

Also, hidden divergence has been flawless in this swing from $6500. So I won’t ignore it because of a pattern which is inconsistent in achieveing it’s target. Having said that. A push to $9000 in the coming days would invalidate the divergence. 

We shall see. I am short and looking to long if it looks like a higher low is in on the daily chart.
Great text explaining why altcoins are useless (unless they dethrone BTC).
First Bitcoiner as in Satoshi 
Never say never
Yea not sure why I’m being raped with downvotes either. 

Guessing the bulls wore their skirts out today 
Yeah, from the looks of it, we could be waiting for a while before there's another definitive move.
it needs to drop below 8,436 to get confirmed, right?

Edit: nevermind \(I assume it confirmed\)
I think the first test would be if it enters and then checks it for support no?

Reaching the top boundary should take some time on such a big pattern.
I read tomato and tomato in 2 different ways...
What an album that was! :D
but it's just 2 trades or ?
Maybe, generally when I see the volume + price stagnate and ETH/BTC ratio drop it usually means people are cashing out Alts -> BTC - > Fiat
You forgot Decred, that shits damn near ath at this point. And I had to trade it all out.
Hi honestly a bit surprised to see BTC up here still at this point using alt performance as a metric, I'm Dad!
Yep, and this is then fueled by the "haha I bought ripple at 1 cent now I am rich" youtube 20 year old gamblers that are just survior bias. I think it's quite sad, I just want to be a better trader

This is because you have learned about risk and control, I am myself thinking of putting some ETH profits into some protocol hype ICO this year actually but I am quite aware of the risk and it's in a way(but still a bit house money fallacy)  "free money"
yeah, but then they will still sell too early and not go through the losses and so on to learn a solid foundation of trading
100X
price is now at 8376 on bitmex. We havent reach 8410 yet.
It was just there and this is a bear market, so not a big stretch to think the price could drop 4%.
Also it's forming a top on the daily; a peak, likely to be followed by a trough.
atleast to 8k. According to long term moving averages, the downtrend, the failure for bulls to hold the push from 8450 (i predicted a pull up to 8430+ from 8360, and I was waiting for confirmation of a drop back to sub 8400 levels to confirm a drop to 8k). 

R/R is worth it.
I see, thank you! 
Pretty sure that Inverse h & s and is a bullish pattern, and you’d look it is as the downtrend had started at 8600 and brought btc down to 8436 (head)

Anyways it’s on a small time frame and within a small range so I wouldn’t expect anything huge from it
Agreed. They got a bit carried away and pulled back as expected.

Thanks sherlock, I wrote in more detail because that info wasnt enough
well then its kind of hard to post the evidence everyone wants. 
it was like that with mtgox too.

every day some mtgox fud about them being scam or insolvent and then poof one day we found out it was all true and was true all along


it's now being confirmed by multiple people. 
I hope there is somehow a mellow meltdown rather than an implosion.  I don't want to get auto deleveraged from my BitMex short position because the market falls off a cliff.
its usually a bad sign when exchange executives quit working for them.

especially for an exchange as tainted as bitfinex 


The market will tell you.
Why?
Where are the sources? how does anyone know?

We do. But what if we want to see the truth, even if it shows us ugly realities about the way things are vs. the way things could/should be?
... but you didn't say "hi".
Indeed, holding 8400 today was nice. Let's see what today brings...
Haha, deserves gold!!

That said, I sorta miss u/dushmankush ‘s trolling for some reason. 
Rude
I think it was meant to be sarcasm. 
What would they be protecting? Hedging shorts underwater?
8440 support turned resistance?  That would be the highest I would expect this to bounce.
looks like its breaking down. Gonna add to your shorts?
Ok thanks, I wish I had a way to figure out the benefit of the quarterly premium vs the funding fee for perpetual when it is negative.  Although I suppose you can't see the future of the rate.

I just know when I have been short the quarterly in the past and the market turns around, I get killed as the premium rapidly grows.   I suppose the best time to use the quarterly is in an extended bear market and then can avoid some of the funding fees as well, because they are usually positive in a continuous downtrend.
why not :p
Why is that?

"Long term holding" is a perfectly valid strategy. Just different from daytrading.
Watching that too, at this point I think we'll encounter it with this continued sideways action.
That just break?
Yeah I've looked at that line, down to retest before trying ~10k is where I'm putting my positions
Regarding Fibs, I agree with you about the hocus-pocus regarding their justification. I believe they attain their relevance simply because so many traders use them in their TA.
The only "fib" retracement I like is the 50% , but that's not even following that sequence it's just I like it from psychology standpoint. And I think the market shows it, we are 150$ -+ from the 8200 range sine a week that is the middle of 6800 and 10k
By not getting rekt!
With your brain, if capable.
BFX and Binance both allow wash trading. GDAX does not. GDAX's volume trend has been troubling.
Look at the comments on any mainstream article about Bitcoin. It's 99 percent jealous no-coiners hoping for a crash.  This is the strongest indicator that we have not even begun to tap demand (derp. edited. orginally typed "supply") and that -- IMPORTANT -- we are not in a bubble.  

I know bubbles. I remember 1999-2000.  Back then, everybody was talking about new paradigms and endless gains and all kinds of bullshit. I was saying, "No, guys, this will crash." I had an Apple computer when people laughed at me, saying, "There aren't any programs for that. How do you deal with Word files, dude!?!"  I sold most of my stocks and bought Apple. In 2000.  Yeah. Call me stupid. Fuck you.

Point is: when the plebes mock it, buy it.  When they're hyped, sell.  They are not even close to being hyped about Bitcoin.

Also, ten-year rule: If you don't see a ten-year roadmap and can't afford to hold and accumulate for that long, don't invest.

Trading... yeah, I suck at that. I admit it.  Still fun though.
Most bots dont pick up edits since that would require constantly re parsing every reddit comment ever posted. They usually just work by scanning once on creation 

Perhaps try making a new comment
Not sure about the PM's but does it pick up edited posts? Probably not.
Maybe because they've had it hammered into them by so many to "buy the dip"
Be careful what ya wish for, amigo. South of here is no man's land.
Hmm, you are describing the inverse of the BGD formula.
oops 2300 BTC gone.. gotta fix that bug some time

Absolutely not. 
dip buyers think they're getting the best deal in the history of btc 
> It can be boring as shit sometimes. In order to be profitable, you might have to sit and stare at your monitor for 8 hours and do absolutely nothing.

As opposed to my normal job where I sit and stare at my monitor for 8 hours and do absolutely nothing...but pretend to be doing something.
So a 2300 BTC 3m candle whiplashed the price to wipe the orderbook, now 107BTC is pushing it downwards? What is happening here lol
Not a bull flag
[deleted]
You may not be aware of order minimums. Most exchanges are 0.002 BTC minimum orders...that's $16 right now. Unless your bot is simply trading a single coin in and out of fiat and not employing any DCA strategy, you're going to run out of rope super fast. 

0.05 BTC is the lowest I'd even bother with. 
Yes they are legit and they usually have the most volume.
that's how I interpret it but I mean it could just be more chop. 

the main reason I ever said 2018 would be a repeat of 2014 was because these bubble pops take forever. Euphoria and dreams of being rich don't just shatter overnight. Every person thinks the next dip will be the big bull run. 

This stops the price from going lower at any sort of consistent speed- people have to be convinced over and over that no, no one is going to bring this higher. 

people can only buy the dip so many times before they run out of money. With  a lack of surging interest in btc and a lack of new money the price will naturally go lower over long periods of time. 

miners are just going to continue to sell it consistently. this means for BTC to even go sideways for long periods of time there has to be new money coming in all the time 
You read that beautifully.. Well played. Proper legend!
Wow, seems a bit ambitious as of now, but good to keep in mind. would be crazy if we get to a new ATH in 6 weeks, but definitely something to keep in mind if we do break out of our symmetrical triangle. 

Thanks for sharing!

Lol, the joke went way over your head.
Dogecoin, Navcoin, Vertcoin, Myriadcoin and plenty of coins have mining fee less than a penny. Are they all better than Bitcoin ? Please, tell me, I need to know if I have to sell all my btc coins for better one.
What is your use case for BCH and BTC that you are switching between them for?
Doesn't mean it's not a total shitcoin. The only reason it works at all is because nobody uses it. It's easily the top shitcoin in the top 10 list. 
Yeah I saw bunch of downvotes on all posts few minutes ago. Some unhappy folks popped by it seems. Doesn't matter, here for the information and discussion, not internet points.

I don't think you missed anything, and I really like the use of the 50 day & weekly MA. 

I think 9.4k right now is still a bit far away as it would necessitate a breakout from the top of the massive symmetrical triangle, if we gain some more momentum here we might have a shot in the next week or two. (I also said 8600 was far away yesterday and look what happened, haha) 

Will be an interesting week, though I really hope volume at least picks up a bit, because right now it really feels like a bumpy slow-bleed reminiscent of the aftermath of the last hype cycle. 


I know I shouldn't be mad for the market "not reacting the way it should" - but it really feels like that's what it's doing. Very little follow through after big pumps, and yet buyers are eager to buy every dip/dump and don't really seem to care for lines/formations being broken.

truuu

damn nice call though.
great book too https://www.amazon.de/Way-Turtle-Methods-Ordinary-Legendary/dp/007148664X
I've actually read one of his books \- trading in the zone \- can highly recommend it. I should probably read it again haha.
Hm, I'm fairly sure they were 0.25% before. 


I just checked my order history and can confirm they were 0.25% a few months ago. 
I was on it like a hawk. Not super confident though, another dip like that and I'm out. But it's holding so far.
Just seems disingenuous to share the profit after margin.  A 1% move on 100 x margin is 100%, for instance.  The end % isn't nearly as important as the move % itself, especially in a public forum.  

Just one trader's opinion.
Didn't you also predict 100k in a year with a 10k premium on futures?
I'm not the sort of person who trades off somebody's reddit post. I hope most people here are not.

Either way, losing everything previously and then going YOLO long on BitMEX with someone else's money undermines the rest of your post, which is pretty flimsy to begin with. Who knows, maybe you will be right; and if you are, it will almost certainly have nothing to do with your original reasoning.

I hope you are not attached enough to your position to be all in and/or without stops, because that will get you to a margin call eventually.
This guy gets it.
Maker allows you to essentially lock up your ETH (not BTC) in a smart contract as collateral and borrow their DAI stablecoin token against it. You need to be careful where you set the liquidation point for your collateral. 

You can use your borrowed DAI to buy other tokens and go from there so it is a way of margin trading but not exactly in the Bitmex sense. 

Separately there are a number of projects working on the DEX margin trading problem - check out DyDx, Lendroid and b0x.network - my personal favourite is b0x which is a margin trading protocol that works with the 0x protocol for DEXes and it is also the furthest along in development. 
Haven't heard of that shitcoin, sorry. /s
It is tough if you are starting out and undercapitalized, but the trading fees really aren't the issue.  You just have to start slow and sometimes take a bit more risk than is ideal and you can grow your trading stack.  Then can make smaller bets (as a percentage of your net worth) and have profits enough to pay the bills and then some.


True.
Kush was so much better
I kinda figured that /u/coingurrruu was our default troll. OP is just a off-brand knock off IMO. Who else announces closing shorts to go bang his GF?

Much better idea.
as always, but you can read more from my post. 
Breaking a support level isn't generally a buy signal. 

It's a sell signal, or at least a signal to get out of the way until selling pressure subsides. 

We just saw the opposite. Buyers lining up like that dip below $8,400 was the last time BTC will ever be at those prices again. 

If buyers follow through here and keep pushing price up through resistance at $8,600 (doubtful), then it's not nuts. 

If buyers fail to continue upward here, then it's nuts.
Nope, no rejection here yet.
I'd argue the opposite. 

This is just another in a long string of fomo spikes until buyers actually continue moving up.
good points! let's see what happens

good luck in your trades!
I downvoted because I found the bulls vs bears commentary a bit irritating.
No chart no upvote :)
Also bringing bear predictions right after breaking the downtrend can have that effect
Because denial is overwhelmingly popular here 
downvoted for referencing the Binance BTC/USDT market... as if it matters
If we close an hour or 2 hour candle below the neckline.  Still looks like we could be in a bull flag though tbh
Ah yes sorry, that's definitely step one
try this one out: Potato Potato
Yes plus 2 follow up trades to balance it out.
But it's happening at every 5 to 50 cent interval cause the order books can be thin at a particular price point so you're doing several smaller trades in a short span.

Edit : spelling
This is why I track alt performance as a metric personally. If alts are dropping while BTC is stagnating, it means money is leaving the market. People generally flee to BTC first if they are trading alts since it’s more stable.
Ja but when btc remains stable and alts are trying to dump its gewd
bad bot
Liquidated in 30 seconds...
it's more like 500x lmao 
Probably shouldn't advertise your stops when they're <.25% away from the current price. I don't typically believe in stop hunting but if this was indeed a *big* short then you're putting yourself at risk by announcing it to the world.
I agree with you. I just added a bit after sitting on my hands for a week 

will be my last add 

if I were a 100xer, I do think now would be a decent time to do it


NEO is up 7% on USD, and 5% on BTC. Seem to be breaking thorugh the 7500 sats horizontal resistane too there... not agreeing with you
Over 1,000 words about each contract, with charts to boot. Bitmex documents pretty exhaustively. I suppose you might want to just read about options in general?
If it only exists on youtube then it probably isn't evidence of anything.
Lol, are you really citing Tone Vay's video as evidence? Lmao.

the fud was based on increased withdrawal times not just conjured out of thin air

It was like that with bitfinex too when they got hacked for $72 million and stole 1/3 of all their customers' money.
So, in other words, you don't have any evidence to share?


> every day some mtgox fud about them being scam or insolvent and then poof one day we found out it was all true and was true all along

This is actually true.  Still don't think it's relevant unless someone made off with actual Bitcoin and are now dumping it on the market.  Suspect it's more like a "sold more than we had" thing, in which case, the price could get a nice bump up.  Time will tell.

There is no fucking way anyone is getting autodeleveraged for a long long time.
Where's the evidence, bro? You said you had evidence. Post it up or troll harder.

Um, no. You think people should be obligated to work at the same place forever? You think the only reason someone would leave a company is because of "bad signs"?

Where's the evidence, bro?
Not really. People switch jobs all the time.  Now if he quit and said there’s a lot of shady stuff going on there and I don’t want to go to jail that’s another thing. Did the market tank when Charlie left coinbase? This is silly.

well if we see Gdax doing nothing or going down while Bitfinex climbs 5-10% then we'll know people are spooked since that's what happened last time  tether FUD came out 
big if true
They don't. Its theoretically possible for tether to be insolvent, and I don't like the fact they haven't produced a proper audit, but there is nothing to currently report beyond that.

As a result people with too much time on their hand make these elaborate conspiracies.

The minute someone produces something beyond tin foil hat bullshit is the minute I reevaluate my opinion.
All I see is the ROE on my short going up.
Why? The trolling wasn't even clever and most of it was just hijacked from other posters. He attacked people for no reason, which discouraged people from posting their ideas. He wasn't funny, wasn't clever and wasn't smart. He was just obnoxious and repetitive. He also sucked up to a few people (chew and sloppy) to gain credibility and cause drama. Definitely one of the most insufferable regulars I've seen on here. I fully agree with a few other posters who said that he seemed like a sociopath.
I'm getting around to appealing for him to bring him back. will write a long comment soon on it and hopefully he can get forgiveness from a few people here to justify an unban

~~oddly enough, myusernameiforgot has gotten two of the big personalities banned now. he got l14dy banned and now he got dush banned lol~~

Something no one understood about dush is he was actually a long term holder. he bought the top in 2014 and just held until now. 

Most of his criticisms and remarks were jokes and not actual judgments upon people holding btc. He has been long the entire time, although he's slowly cashing out now. 

his trading stack is significantly smaller than his cold storage 
I'm referring to the orderbook being stacked on the buy side despite the drop through support. 

The assumption would be that they're adding to existing long positions to prevent liquidation. 

Or of course they somehow see the break below support as bullish. They're basically treating this dump as an opportunity to buy the dip. Not as a signal to GTFO and/or switch to short.
nice predict
No, I don't usually add to my positions once I take them.

I generally just stick with my entry.

Also, buyers on June futures have absolutely lost their minds. They're clamoring to buy the dip here.
Welcome to the hornets 🐝 nest.  


Edit:  or perhaps bear den would be more apt. 
I'm expecting an outcome by about 10PM - midnight UTC latest.
Not really, no.

It may break in the not too distant future, but it didn't break right there.
Same here. The idea that 23.6% between one point and another somehow has special relevance because of 'nature' is hard to believe imo
Oh wow..I wasn't aware of that. I usually only follow GDAX charts as that is where I buy and sell BTC. However there were times in March where there were 1 hr candles of less than 10 BTC traded on GDAX so we're not quite back to that point yet. 
I sent a few PM's, but maybe a new comment will work. 

!short xbtusd close 8280
ya that's why I added. I don't think we have the coiled  pressure to explore upwards but we definitely have it primed for downwards movement. 

I could always be wrong and buyers could just continue to pile on slowly but idk, I think today will be an exciting day finally 
This is downright laughable. Wake me up at 81xx, I guess.

That low exposed hidden divergence... which is bullish.
Yeah all in on each trade at the minute between EUR, LTC and BTC trying to arb a profit. It's not the best strategy but the GDAX API is buggy as hell and seems to return old balances/holds every once in a while so I track my balance locally which makes dca difficult due to slippage and crapping out when the API returns an error. Seems to be when there's a good bit of profit on the table not that I'm cynical in any way. 
Cheers for the info bitmex seems to use a different structure the most other exchanges for their API. I'll have to read through later tonight as it looks like a completely new project. Do you know if theirs any good node/python docs for them?
Well, it's easy to report a trade after the event 
Very ambitious indeed. Hard to believe for me, as well. 

But the number of waves fits, the market sentiment fits the description. Many things pointing in that direction...

well I guess we could assume that the bitcoin blocks are filling up.



They aren't better for me, because Bitpay doesn't accept them on various sites.  You sound kind of clueless.
Using it as a currency through Bitpay payment portal on various websites.
It works better than BTC, so BTC must be a shittier shitcoin...by your logic, not mine.


Yep, I think volume is the most important thing to look at this and next week. Any move that doesn't have the necessary volume to break out of the descending volume pattern is probably a fake out. Looking at the daily volume I'd say the breakout should start early next week, around the 31st...
It does feel to me like we're still due a trip to the 7xxxs. There's a part of me that wants to just drop leverage to 3x and add it all. Short 8500 (June) and re-evaluate if 8850 breaks. Just sidestep the chop entirely and target a 7-14 day trade. 
Why bear trap if we are getting rejected from $8640? Is it not a bull trap then?
Great, thanks! Just grabbed the pdf.  Will burn through this next time price action is moving sideways !!
After a little research, I found .25% was BTC only, LTC and ETH have been .3% since they were added. I'm not sure when BTC was bumped to .3%.
Fingers crossed.

If not, a minimal loss and better entry on the way.

well on the other hand margin is basically a risk ratio, so knowing someones margin level according with their entry can say a lot about their risk thinking
Yes. Is that still possible? Yes.
Awesome thanks

>We will see a sharp downturn, these two wicks are to fill the order book downside and to prevent shorters from opening shorts by scaring themand to hunt for stops. We are also in an asencing wedge where the wicks perfectly make the resistance line. we brake out of the ascending wedge below around 8505!

I think this way of drawing the wedge is the correct one since you start from the bottom \(for the bottom line\). Which leaves us with more room to the upside
Ah yes agreed, if it's not meant to push through 8.6 it's idiotic. Tho it could just be bots playing 1H oscillators games too.

It was my sell signal today :/

You are still planning to hold this short if this moves above 8500, correct?  With plans to bail only if 8600 is breached?  
My last 2 posts have been TA posts with charts, didn’t want to post same charts again. 

I also predicted it 21 hours ago saying there will be a retrace to 8400 Ish with a possible test of 8280

I seriously doubt that a whale will put in the time and effort to make me lose my money by stop hunting. Not only will they waste their precious resources but also fail to make money because I would re-enter a big short position at 8395. I am willing to do this 5 times. 

A loss from 8395 to 8410 taken 5 times is still lower than the profit taken from 8400 to 8k.

Edit- I can do this 10 times and the R/R will still be worth it.
First time I've seen you mention 100x without sarcasm I think.
Lol shit, thought you were talking long for a minute there...
Moving stops to $8410?
good. Do me a favour and try and experiment.

short 100 usd worth bitcoin at 8395, stop loss at 8410.

See how many times you manage to make a loss before taking profit at 8k.

You will lose an insignificant amount of money if i am wrong. \(less than $3\)

Edit\- you lose like 0.0002 xbt if this happens 10 times \(so 0.00002 per time\) But if it goes down to 8k you make 0.0005

what if that 7k btc becomes 7m?
Add a few more 'bros' for emphasis.
charlie wasn't a major executive of coinbase and coinbase is shady but nowhere near the level of bitfinex shady
Well your regression analysis contains 1 data point.  I'd say if you were to take the event 'key exec leaves suddenly' and regress it back to year 2000 on every major stock or crypto.   Then come back with the results.




But is it true..?
From what I've gathered it's true but not big.
By the time you get the perfect evidence you want, its too late.

Plenty of circumstantial evidence that when you put it together you get 95% chances of massive fraud and scam.

Firing the auditor is a big deal

> he got dush banned lol

No he definitely didn't. He just said that for effect. DK was reported by half the sub here probably. Ongoing complaints lead mods to ban. 

Also, why do you want DK back? He literally had nothing of value to say and constantly attacked people for merely being in the opposite position. He discouraged posts because people were concerned that he was going to lash out. The fact that you want him back is pretty strange. 
> Most of his criticisms and remarks were jokes and not actual judgments upon people holding btc. He has been long the entire time, although he's slowly cashing out now.

So says a sociopath.

>his trading stack is significantly smaller than his cold storage

So says a sociopath. 

It's not like those types of people would ever lie and change their story when it suites them to do so, would they?
Oh, i get it now. They could be seeing this as a confirmation of the broken downtrend from 10k no?
I don't have that line drawn now but should be around this level.
lol this is such a shitshow $100 premium i.e premium increased with XBTUSD decreased
This is... the strangest thing I've seen in a long time. 
> Also, buyers on June futures have absolutely lost their minds. They're clamoring to buy the dip here.

I couldn't pass on the opportunity to switch from 5x to 7x with the premium over $100, and I was able to add at 8440 with spot at 8335. Absurd. 

!short xbtm18 add 8440 2x
Hm. I like this sub. At least for serious discussions about the market.

Yes, there are different schools here, but if you can make your case, you're acknowledged.

The daily in /r/Bitcoin is for having fun. The daily here is for serious, substantiated discussions about market trends.
We seem to be finding support with the first attempt at 10k on the 25th:  https://imgur.com/a/mxf1xsP

That would intersect with our current short term support line in 3~10 hours.  I agree with your projection of around the closing of the daily candle to see if the next notable move is up or down.

What do you have the breaking point at right now? About 8350?  
Seems like we dipped below it and are flirting with it hard right now, no? Not considering shorting here? I saw you wrote a longer post about shorting opportunities below as well but this trend line didn't seem to factor into it.
it's a bit like this http://www.learntotradethemarket.com/forex-trading-strategies/trading-50-percent-retracements-price-action

You need to check block explorers to know that BCash is processing ~50 Kb blocks? Have you been living under a rock? Do you not realize that Segwit is processing more TXs than BCash and the gap is growing? 

Who in their right mind thinks BCash is competitive in any way with Bitcoin? It's like over 20x less transaction volume. I'm shocked that you're not aware of this. Don't you wonder why everyone is always ridiculing BCashers and Roger?
You kinda first degree in terms of humor, right ?
Except it doesn't. The liquidity is orders of magnitude worse and it has no long term viability. It doesn't even have a single distinguishing selling point. It's worse than any competitor, including Litecoin, which is basically just a much better version that has organic network effect and distribution. Ripple owns BCH in terms of fees and speed.

 Holding BCash is like hold a potato that's literally on fire. It's literally processing the same number of transactions as Bitcoin was way back in 2012. Go ahead and believe Ver and Craig though, shill that shitcoin into the future, bro. I'm sure you won't be left with heavy bags. I'm sure of it.
It just seems inevitable to revisit the bottom of this https://imgur.com/rnKsujp
Seems to be quite the battle for 8.4 right now. I think we should know a direction soon, unless we just dip to like 8.3 and that gets bought up with no regard for trend lines.

I felt like we were due for the 7xxxs as well, and expected a bounce when we dipped below 8, but didn't really think we'd bounce to 8.6, so shorting kept blowing up in my face all the way up. At this point I don't know what to think anymore and also don't want to "expect" the price to go anywhere. If anything I'm tending toward the opposite and feel like predictions beyond 48 hrs are becoming impossible.
In about April. look up Gdax new fee structure

Oh I agree with that, but didn't see anything about it in the parent comment.  I would've enjoyed the whole trade setup/execution/close discussion. But this is all I saw:

> Got stopped out on my 8237 long at 8404, for a nice 11% profit. 
You don't get the jokes, do you? \^\-\^
I've never paid fiat for any of my crypto (trading fiat pairs doesn't count). 
6k can hurt, but if you ever become truly successful with trading, it will be relatively insignificant.   I remember early on, I was down $2K on a position and almost suicidal before it came back (in about 30 seconds).  Now that is barely a blip and carries with it no emotion.
Good on you, bro. make sure your gainz is big enough to cover formula and diapers in that case. ;-)
^^
coinguru is awesome y’all crazy
Yup. I'll bail at $8,600 and maybe consider a long above $8,800. 

Buyers need to prove to me that they won't crumble the moment there's the slightest hint of resistance. 
Don't worry. Mostly psyops accounts in here in the past 24 hrs. The rest are stupid. Few folks who know what up have been posting, which in itself says a lot of you know what I mean
Aye, lot's of terrible reasoning weaved into that comment, but okay if that's how to feel... I don't feel like getting into it right now. Good luck.
Hah, it wouldn't be one of the best I've thought of. There's a good chance it gets reallt really close or simply would get liquidated here

There are a few times I've thought to myself that "I'd love to go 100x here" I just usually don't mention them or I simply add on regular leverage. It turns out right more often than not but getting  it right 5 times then wrong once doesn't really matter because you're liquidated lmao
so far so good :D

I really do need to make a 100x account for fun 
$8396. they  have to stop me out 400 times before it's not worth it.

Crypto is not stocks. If you’ve got a history with market reaction to executives leaving crypto exchanges I’d be happy to go through it. And what’s suddenly? If he got a better offer or wanted to leave he is probably doing just that. You guys are making something from nothing. 
Your comparison makes no sense. We're not talking about Bitcoin CSO, we're talking about an exchange CSO. One of many. 

You FUDsters need to get your glasses prescriptions checked. 
And you know what, if you feel it's too risky to use it and want to steer clear, I respect that. What I don't respect is the rambling garbage that spews out of people's mouths on the topic that is 100% conjecture. 

Just say "I find it too risky, I'm keeping out of crypto until it resolves one way or the other" and I'll nod, respect your sensible decision and we can all go about our lives.
Thank you, I appreciate that a lot. I've had my moments of being rude/snappy but i try to edit or delete those comments before they are seen. It's hard not to get emotional sometimes but I try my best not to because it doesn't really help anyone. 

But thanks a lot :) 
oh, my bad. I will remove that.. 

Well because I think he can behave and he was funny.  I wanted you back too even though I'm sure you have a lot of haters as well.

I just think he took his humor too far and was trading emotionally and that he can act better now. Most of his sarcasm and criticisms were just him memeing. He has been long on BTC this entire time, if he truly thought holders were idiots he'd be calling himself an idiot 

Also, the sub is more interesting with more personalities and he offers decent insight when he puts effort in
That line is down at $8,200 though. 

I mean, I guess they are:

1. Assuming the market probably won't make it all the way down to confirm the breakout.

2. Assuming that, even if it does get down that far, the former resistance line will *definitely* serve as strong support.

I suppose it's not as crazy as I originally thought in that context.
It's like they're looking at their charts upside down.
There's going to be a lot of sad faces over on Mex if this drops below $8,200. 

Although I don't see the premium deteriorating unless $7,800 falls.

If anything, I imagine it'll continue to climb with every 2%+ bounce between here and there (assuming this does continue to decline).

I do find this sub interesting, but you have to have a strong stomach to deal with the overwhelming bearish sentiment here most of the time.  
Interesting trend line. Seems to be holding up for now, but the price is looking slightly heavy. Think a breach of 8400 will send up into a lower 8300 at least, if not lower. 

I'm just gonna step away from the charts today and set an alarm. Shit ALWAYs goes down when I'm not watching the charts, haha. 
$8,360 or so. 
Buyers have soured me on shorting lately. Their behavior is incredibly frustrating. 

Whenever there's a major breakdown, buyers pretty much disregard that it happened and buy the market right back up above the breakdown...only to let it drop again after.

We saw this at $8,100 most recently, and at $8,600 not that long ago. 

So sure, you could short this breakdown if it occurs, and perhaps buyers will actually capitulate and let price drop below $7,800.

More likely, however, is the market will bounce at some point between $8,000 and $8,300 and there will be a strong green candle to kick you out of your short prematurely.
that article makes sense. The author acknowledged my main grievance with fib retracements too that if you draw enough lines, you'll invariably get random touches that don't actually have any significance
I could actually go for that right about now haha
Hah.  

I don’t know, the buyers may be giving up, not seeing much of a bounce below 8.3 here.  

Edit: might have spoken too soon there 
Bitcoin cash has always had lower transaction volume it's worth 1/8th what legacy-core is.  I just assumed it.  Your comment made me think some recent event had disturbed that well-known status quo.

Not making a joke.  I realize people get butthurt here about the truth, but doesn't make it any less true.
I'm not investing in BCH.  I'm using it as a currency, because it is accepted by Bitpay where BTC is, and BCH is the better choice for reasons I have outlined above.

I never said it was the coin of the future.  I get that is your fetish to be obsessed about that, but I don't care.  I said it is better to use right now and that is the truth.
Distinguishing selling points of BCH (since you asked):

32MB block limit. that means, even with full segwit adoption (what like 3MB?) it still has 10x the transaction throughput as BTC. Sure, not very many people are using it now, but the point is THEY CAN. If we all of a sudden onboarded an entire country of millions of people, could BTC handle that right now? Not in hell. 

Bigger op_return size (how much data to be stored in a tx, like a message) and newer opcodes. Allows for things such as smart contracts and tokenization. 

More than one active implementation of the protocol. Competing dev teams. 

Yeah, let's just keep waiting, maybe the LN will work, and when it doesn't at least we were hodling our Litecoin Silver! Until their blocks fill up and then we have to put LN on that to fix it.

Many many many of the people who were in Bitcoin have switched to Bitcoin Cash, as the bigger blocksize makes developing services that use the blockchain much easier. 

Then you compare it to Ripple. lol dude. I thought we were talking about cryptocurrencies?
Indeed. Yet this dip buying is insane. It does feel a little precarious. If 8300 goes, it could move quickly. The same can't be said for 8500, though, as we were just there. 
Hmm, have a break even chance right here.  But I'm comfortable with the stop loss and potential loss there, and support still holding.  I wouldn't have expected a quick bounce.  I'll give it a few hours still before reevaluating.

Next iteration though, I'm sure the ascending wedge falls.

Okay, Ill give better reasoning.

If I find it reasonable to believe that whales are stop hunting (for orders that make up less than 0.01% of the market volume) then I would start posting fake orders to make the whales do what I want.
I did it once catching a huge red candle when I first got into mex.  Made a ton in less than a minute.  Got greedy and did it again.  On the same candle. Like 3 minutes later.  Because I was so greedy that I regretted not holding on to it a little bit longer.  Yeah that shit bounced and took back more than I had won.  Opening positions at 100x is just ludicrous, but I can see how adding to a successful position could get you there.
That must be how bots work.
lets say it goes to 0.00004 because of fees- still worth it.
I guess we'll all find out soon won't we. 
we don't have a large enough data set.
We could assume 

* 'exchanges act like other organizations regarding C-level execs', and derive consequences from the event

* 'C-level exec suddenly leaves organization'.

* funnel that output to 'exchange has good news' or 'exchange has bad news'

* funnel that output to 'bitcoin reacts to bad news at exchanges' or 'bitcoin reacts to good news at exchanges'.

Error accumulates along each assumption.. But it's better than no information at all.


anytime a C-level exec leaves any organization, crypto or otherwise, it has major ramifications.  Bitcoin historically reacts to major exchanges.  Because it's a frothy investment dominated by speculation.




There is more garbage spewing from the people who can't accept the fact that Tether WILL go down, it is not a matter of if but when. 
What insights did he ever offer? The few times I can remember him posting anything substantive were towards the end and he was just regurgitating TA that was posted a few comments down. Also, he only started to 'shape up' when he was blasted for being a complete dickhead.

I also just did not find him funny in the slightest. Literally his "jokes" were all the same format, which inevitably involved excessive use of the suffix "-tard" followed by really cringeworthy sarcasm or badly-received copypasta from somewhere else. How many times could that guy say the same exact thing and still get a laugh? 

Additionally, his behavior with his alt account was absurd. Proclaiming I was the worst poster in the sub because I posted a rather thoughtful meme? He was probably just upset because his "jokes" pale in comparison or appeal to a much lower standard of humor. 

I may have my detractors but by and large they're BCash shills that I've pissed off for being so forward regarding their nonsense. Or it's fake screenshot posters or people posting some other sort of FUD or unsupported garbage, which I'll inevitably label as such. Or it's just DK himself (or should I say UstorEst). I don't see how I'm comparable with DK, who, by and large, was a sociopathic, manipulative asshole with no redeeming qualities. I'm just a straightforward type of asshole and only to people who are trying to pass off bullshit as the real deal. 

IMO.

Now we just have to wait and see how this bounces. Above 8380 puts the price above what i think was  the support line so that would invalidate my pattern and make me starting to worry a bit.

Bellow i just have the old trend line as possible support around 8250 and some sort of horizontal support around 8180. After that nothing until 7800 (i don't think this is going that low with this bull mentality around)

I imagine the number of folks with liquidations/stops between 7800-8200 is stupidly high. The bounce off 8300 feels pretty weak, and it could't even retest the broken support as resistance. I share your theory of a BRD from 7800-6900 for cosmic symmetry. 

At least until *a wild pump appears* out of nowhere and we're back at 8500. 
The sub is bearish because the market has been bearish. 

If you go back to the fall of 2017, there wasn't a bear in sight. 

If anything, this sub has been overwhelmingly bullish the last few years (and rightfully so). 
Looks maybe about time for me to stop watching that trendline...
Thanks.  You going to short if it falls? 
What do you think about a long right here with tight stops?  Good r/r or The risk of getting stopped out just too high?  
I would be interested to know what, if anything, you take from this behavior.  Buyers seem stubborn.  They will buy on dips but don’t follow through.  
TX volume is trending down. Hence, Bitcoin has the big blocks. Not sure what's so hard to get about that.
You weren't but I was. That's what I said, so.
It's not a fetish in Bitcoin**Markets**, it's a statement on its value. Though I suppose this is in the wrong thread.

Either way, what are you using Bitpay for? Is it that essential to your life. Is it that important that you use it instead of plastic or just BTC? Are you holding it before you spend it, exposing you to its additional volatility? 
> 32MB block limit. that means, even with full segwit adoption (what like 3MB?) it still has 10x the transaction throughput as BTC.

This is nowhere near what the LN can handle for in terms of TX throughput and scale. And, obviously, Bitcoin will need to HF upwards to whatever degree at some point in time. Nowhere near that point right now.

>Sure, not very many people are using it now, but the point is THEY CAN.

But they aren't and BCH is losing lots of network effect to BTC (and many other coins).

>If we all of a sudden onboarded an entire country of millions of people, could BTC handle that right now?

The LN can/will. Also, can BCH handle scale? No. That's why this debate is stupid. On chain scaling doesn't work and there's no rush to get this *wrong*. Chain upgrades and layers are the answer, not upping a parameter and calling it a day.

>Bigger op_return size (how much data to be stored in a tx, like a message) and newer opcodes. Allows for things such as smart contracts and tokenization.

Turned off for a reason. We're trying to solve money here, not host crypto kitties on the chain. Ethereum is much better for this use case than BCash.

>More than one active implementation of the protocol. Competing dev teams.

Same with BTC. 

>Yeah, let's just keep waiting, maybe the LN will work, and when it doesn't at least we were hodling our Litecoin Silver! Until their blocks fill up and then we have to put LN on that to fix it.

Why *won't* the LN "work out"? Also do you not understand the economic Nash equilibrium that drives mining and network? The network follows what works. BTC will need to HF to up the block limit at some point but we're nowhere near that point right now. When the time comes, consensus will be reached and the coin will fork. Meanwhile, BCH will be a speck of dust in the past because it's a careless, contentious chain split that was merely mined into existence by Jihan and traded by BTC holders. It doesn't actually have a valid claim to legitimacy, it's just a pump and dump scheme, just like BTG or BTD or all the other forks. It was just the first of its kind and the only one to be front run by the likes of Roger, Craig and Jihan. 

>Many many many of the people who were in Bitcoin have switched to Bitcoin Cash

The numbers *really* don't bear that out. Sorry.
>

>as the bigger blocksize makes developing services that use the blockchain much easier.

Services using the blockchain? What does *that* mean? We're solving hard money here, not smart contracts. 

>Then you compare it to Ripple. lol dude. I thought we were talking about cryptocurrencies?

We're talking about use cases here. BCash has none. Ripple is cheaper. Bitcoin is more secure and has far better liquidity. Litecoin is faster. Ether is far better designed for smart contracts and already has the ecosystem and network.

You're out of you mind if you think BCash is a viable project. You've been sold a lie and/or are trying to sell a lie. Either way, to each their own. Good luck with *that* PnD!

I'm on the fence still, but two good indicators flipped both to sell. Haserfuld and Chewy lol.
Yes it is difficult to trade profitably in a consistent manner, but many people do it.  I am often dumb and make so many mistakes, but I have been able to turn a profit, each of the last 5 years.  

I tried to trade the stock market in my 20s and did great and then lost all my money...which was a huge mistake and disaster, but I didn't give up and now I could retire from my gains from crypto trading.

So my point is just don't give up if you realy think you can make it work. 
That’s why you just have sex with the exhaust pipe
That's fair enough. The bigger issue here is that your exit is so close and within volatility range even if the market *is* going to $8K. The fact that you would enter 5 times instead of just holding on is also just a good way to lose money imo.

Yeah I mean it as a fun thing on a separate account. I want to try it one day for fun. I think if you 100x'd then lowered leverage every time you won you could end up profitable

Well, if the error is that they sold more Bitcoin than they actually had, somebody needs to buy a whole shite ton of Bitcoin.  God, please let that be the error!
What are you talking about? This is so incredibly inaccurate. Look, for example, at Maxwell leaving Blockstream. Major ramifications? Uh, nope.
I really don't understand where it came from either.

Here's the strongest bullish statement that can be made at current price/time:

"Price isn't as low as it could be."
I believe this user took issue with Sloppy and myself arguing that BTC is not a sure thing. You can check his past recent posts to see:

1) Discovered BTC in December 2017  
2) Puts 100% of disposable income into it  
3) Never been more sure of anything in his life that in 4-5 years he'll have a yacht  

While that's entirely possible, the level of certainty was alarming, and Sloppy and I were trying to point out the absolutely non-zero chance that BTC dies in a dumpster fire down the road a spell.  
Unfortunately I wasn’t here back then to observe.        Ever since I got involved in bitcoin in January 2018 I find myself trying to fend off an onslaught of bears 🐻.  I’m ok with sincerely held bearish sentiment (although I think bears will be proven wrong long term) my spidey sense tingles when confronted by bears as there are some agenda driven fud spreaders on reddit which I find annoying.  Sometimes it can be difficult to distinguish them from each other.   anyway, speech over, I’m here to trade. 
Jeez, gone for 10 minutes and everything starts shitting the bed, haha. Might be a fakeout though, pretty high volume for a mere $100 drop. This could be bought up fast and back in the trend. Will wait for the hourly to close to see what I want to do. Uptrend line from 7923 low hasn't been broken yet, so thats comforting still. 
Probably not the breakdown, but I'd maybe short a random bounce that pops back up to retest the breakdown. 
It has better r/r than a short, that's for sure. But ya, you'd have to set the stops relatively deep to avoid getting bounced out by a fakeour. 
It's a recipe for disaster, and if there is a substantial dump in the near future then buyers will have nobody to blame but themselves for the "cheap coins" they'll "enjoy" as a result. 

"you can't lose money longing bitcoin" is a mentality shared by a lot of investors in the crypto space. And that's a logical fallacy that could potentially explain the behavior we've been seeing. 

Buyers want the price to continue higher so they can drown in a sea of lambos, but they don't want to put forth the effort to make that a reality. That's somebody else's problem. 

This type of buying behavior can gradually inch the price higher and higher, but it's not going to bring the market to $11,700+. And eventually, there quite simply won't be anybody left to buy the dip when the market needs it most.

There's a fairly strong potential for the market to continue to overextend itself and for sellers to finally get a chance at $7,800. Buyers who loaded up in the $8,000 to $10,000 range will watch smugly as their "sure thing" investment is being sold for a "delusionally low price" and wish they still had some fiat to throw at the market. 

And if $7,800 falls, they'll either watch in disbelief as the market continues to fall, or they'll abandon ship themselves and contribute to the decline. 

That's not a "worst case scenario." It's an inevitability if this lack of follow-through continues for much longer. 
tx volume on both are down quite a bit, i guess I'm confused about which you mean.  I guess you're saying bitcoin cash volume is down more than legacy-corecoin's volume (which is also way down from ATH)?

legacy corecoin was having major slowdowns back in december so it made bitcoin cash look like the bigger block sizes were a great innovation but they turned out to both be far overcapacity anyway.

And it wasn't even bitcoin cash's block size that made it a good alternative, it was just a less-used blockchain period, so it had lower fees, the block sizes were never relevant to bitcoin cash even then.



> Either way, what are you using Bitpay for?

Bitpay offers a payment portal on various websites.  Google it.

> Is it that essential to your life.

Yes it is essential to my life and that of all of humanity.  What a great question.
Hah indeed

Edit: based on his latest post, I'm trading a tighter time frame.
If you really believe that then why arent you scalping?
have you seen trading volumes recently
first off it's not even verified.. so there's like 50% error to start with.
'Phil potter is a C-level exec at bitfinex and he's leaving for unknown reasons' would precede the other 4.

reasons a C-exec would leave an exchange:

* they hate money/old/retiring/stepping down

* got a better offer (starting own exchange, most likely if this is true)

* idealogical differences (over KYC/AML?)

* distance yourself from a shitstorm about to happen so you have less culpability

* outlook looks bleak for future profits (losing customers, increased competition, regulation, etc)


blockstream wasn't an exchange though.

Broke 20k downtrend, broke 10k downtrend. 

If 8800 is broken it puts us back in the old ascending wedge targeting 11k or 12k.

Shorters scared by these random BGD. Even you avoided opening a short earlier after closing your long.

They must feel another 1000$ BGD could come again and push us through 10k and the FOMO would follow.
Chew maybe I’m overlooking it, but I see you comment on lack of follow through from buyers all the time but I don’t see this from you with respect to sellers (like right now.) I know you try to stay as objective as possible so just bringing this to your attention. 
Fair points. That was my most recent experience here, but there have been others. I don’t want to bitch about it. Just warning a familiar “face” that this sub is unlike his usual playground. 
I longed it...  ca is on top of the bear pennant that is now probably being drawn. Have a few orders at the bottom of the wick to grow it, and stop loss a little bit below the wick, under the support line.

This is basically what I was waiting for, though I intended to wait more for confirmation it doesn't continue to go down.  But I'm about to go back to being busy today and cannot deal with that.
Gonna sit out for now
Thanks for responding.  Could the same be said for sellers?
I'm saying that Bitcoin has bigger blocks, on average, than BCash. No matter the time frame. Therefore, "Big Blockers" that shill BCash are looking quite foolish, especially given that it's been almost a year and it's still nowhere near flipping Bitcoin on any metric, including block size. The recent fork is a perfect example of pump and dump hype but BCashers cannot be reasoned with about this or anything else. 
> Bitpay offers a payment portal on various websites. Google it.

Didn't really answer my question, now did you?

>Yes it is essential to my life and that of all of humanity. What a great question.

It is a good question because if it's not solving for a use case (read: disrupting) then it doesn't actually have value beyond speculative trading. Meaning that, when you hold it, you're just *hoping* that it retains its value for when you 'need' to spend crypto for some reason. Meanwhile, legitimate coins grow their network effect. Eventually something like BCH becomes completely worthless because it doesn't lead in any category. It's a hijack of the BTC distribution and nothing more. It's only has value because it was effectively air dropped to BTC holders. 

So, I'm still trying to figure out why you're even bothering using it or if you're just subtly shilling it. 
I don't believe anything. Could go up. Could go down. Could go up and then down. Could go down and then up.

Now we're talking volume? How many red herrings are on the menu tonight?
> anytime a C-level exec leaves any organization, crypto or otherwise, it has major ramifications.

Move the goalposts much?
Right, but price action following those two events isn't exactly bullish (particularly the action following the break of the $20K downtrend). 

True, the downtrend line broke, but the market also made a lower high following the breakout and then dropped to below the initial breakout point. 

As for the $10K downtrend line, gains have been mediocre so far on that front as well. Another 2% drop and the market is below that downtrend line again. 
Here's my personal philosophy:

The onus is never on the "trending side" to continue the trend. That will happen on its own in the absence of reversal pressure. 

When the trend is down, the onus is on buyers to reverse the trend and move upwards. When the trend is up, the onus is on sellers to reverse the trend and move downwards. Otherwise they're just getting in the way and wasting everybody's time.

Currently, the short and medium term trends are both down. While buyers have managed to break the resistance line and *potentially* reverse the trend, they're doing a piss-poor job of it at the moment. Essentially, they're in danger of dropping the ball at the 1-yard line.

Sellers, on the other hand, actually followed through on their intention to reverse the upward trend that brought the market from $6,800 to $10,000. They broke through the [support trendline](https://imgur.com/a/hxJT3ML) that had been propping the market up, and — most importantly — kept pushing the price down following the breakdown. 

Since that breakdown, every attempt by buyers to reverse the trend has been a failure, and ultimately a waste of everybody's time and energy. 

So that's why I'm generally more frustrated with buyers in the current market than I am with sellers. The trend is still down, and buyers keep lining up to stall a continuation of the downtrend when they should — in my opinion — stop wasting everyone's time.

EDIT: I'm fine with strong counter-trend pressure. But when it doesn't result in a trend reversal, it winds up costing me profits. 
it's forward-looking -
the assumption is capacity will become a problem as the crypto space grows

You are still obsessed with investing.  I didn't say anything about investing in BCH vs BTC.  Both are likely going to drop in price, so just becomes a question of which will drop more and I have no idea.  And I don't care.

BCH is superior to use for retail transactions right now, which is why I use it for that right now.
So, basically your position is that, I could lose a little xbt, or I could make a lot of xbt.

Btw, when I say large orders for something like a r/r for that size, I would mean large enough for the profit to be meaningful but small enough so that if the trade goes south that it wouldnt really matter.
Nihilists! Fuck me. I mean, say what you like about the tenets of National Socialism, Dude, at least it's an ethos. 
trying to establish a causal chain.. There's no definitive answer, if you wait until it's definitive, you've missed the trade.  I explained the logic in another post.  It involves 5 'leaps of faith'. haha.


This market is still undecided in my opinion, and heavily manipulated. Since i have no idea where this is going i just try to scalp crumbs along the way.

I've been trying to mimic your trading behavior and letting trades go longer waiting for that big move but each day that passes only reinforces the scalping benefits. 

Enter a position and once it bounces or gets rejected close and go the other way.
Thanks for the thoughtful response, and I see what you mean about onus. Apropos of your frustration with the market, I just can’t shake the feeling that someone has been sweeping up massive amounts of coins down here, and before you know it we’ll be back up around $10k, and he’ll be distributing them on the way to $11.7k. It could certainly explain who is buying and “stalling” a continuation of the downtrend. Would be interested to hear your thoughts there. 
No, the "assumption" (more like calculation) is that big blocks mean a very inefficient blockchain and centralization of miners and nodes, which eliminates store of value proposition, which means saying goodbye to hard money use case. 

Ever heard of something called the Lightning Network?
Do you honestly not understand how network effect, liquidity and store of value is tied to this? 

You're just *claiming* that it's better for retail transactions but that's really up for debate. BTC is still accepted by more merchants *and* that's not even the relevant metric. The relevant metric is TXs, which BTC is doing 10-20x more than BCH. 

By every measure except maybe fees/speed, BTC wins by a large measure. As do other coins.

Keep trying though!
No, my position is that your stops are ridiculously close and planning on closing and re-opening 5x is kind of ridiculous. Why not just move your stops somewhere higher or wait for a breakdown to begin to play out?
Could go up and then down and then up again. Could go down and then up and then down again.
can't disagree with you there. This is not a swing-trading market at the moment. 

That will become a profitable strategy again soon, in all likelihood, but for now it's a recipe for losing money on fees.
If there is any significant degree of manipulation, I don't factor it into my own analysis or make trading decisions based on a hypothetical "they."


it has its pro's and con's
There's a non-zero chance that LN won't become practical before capacity becomes a problem

* LN is untested at the scales the capacity problem becomes an issue

* LN may end up vaporware, infighting, key people leave, go onto other projects

* like segwit, LN may have to compete against legacy-bcore's existing network effects, aka, inertia, networks don't like to cannabilize themselves.





Read above.  I know you are in denial about the truth and I can't help you there, but I already explained it very clearly.  I'm sorry Roger Ver butthurt you, but it's not my fault.
Well I am also shorting futures with stops to 8750.

Basically, my point is that I wouldnt scalp this move, i.e, I would not place limit buy orders at say 8390 and limit sell order at 8410, so I am doing the exact opposite. I may give up pursuing such a tight trade if we dont drop soon or if the volatility becomes inconvenient.

Edit- I suppose I could just buy puts instead of doing such a small and tight trade
If that is the case one should only long and buy the dips
That makes sense. I’m following the clues where they lead me, (I could very well be fighting windmills here) will be very interesting to see where this goes in the next couple of weeks. Happy trading to you. 
LN is an additional layer that is completely abstracted from Bitcoin. What exactly is your concern with LN? How is it vaporware? It's already up and running.

Not to mention that Bitcoin has Segwit, will have Schnorr signatures soon and will also require HF block size increases at the appropriate time. 

I fail to see how BCash, which is just playing to endlessly increase the block size, regardless of consequences to the network, has any place. It's literally a shitcoin that only has value because it co-opted the Bitcoin network and distribution. It has no lasting value and is worse than not only Bitcoin but also Litecoin, Dogecoin, Ether, Ripple, etc. etc. Again, the only reason it has value is because it was basically air dropped on existing Bitcoin hodlers. 
Read *what* above? 

Using BCH to transact means relying on its store of vale. The two are inseparable. Plain and simple. 

What do you not understand about that? Saying BCH is "better" for "retail transactions" is not a factual or accurate statement.
And now the price is $8410.
That's assuming the next significant movement will be up. Which I'm not convinced is the case. 

I see a very timid market at a moment in time when buyers should be plowing through resistance levels left and right. 

Buyers should be in the driver's seat...but they're struggling to make any headway.

And it's not like they're running into massive selling pressure either. There haven't been any major downward moves in a little under a week. 

Yet here buyers sit, slowly climbing 2% at a time and collapsing under their own weight at each new high. 

The momentum could certainly shift at a moment's notice and buyers will find their nuts again. But for now I'm not super hopeful they'll be able to pull it off.
'up and running' isn't the standard software needs to succeed in today's crypto marketplace anymore


> Read what above?

I already explained it.

> Using BCH to transact means relying on its store of vale. The two are inseparable. Plain and simple.

Not it doesn't.  You are clueless.  I don't hold a significant amount of BCH.  I convert other coins to it when I need to use it for a transaction.  It is better for retail transactions than BTC, so I use it instead.

All crypto currency is a poor store of value right now.  Look at the chart.
Again, I said I can do it multiple times. 

Anyways, I’d rather buy puts if I can find a reliable website for if. 
> 'up and running' isn't the standard software needs to succeed in today's crypto marketplace anymore

So what is? You love to move the goalposts around when it suites you, as I've already noted, so how about defining some metrics that would lend credibility to the project.

Also, are you not going to address any of the other points? How convenient...
Wow, dude. You are just plainly wrong about this and yet you think you're so right. Liquidity and store of value have a lot to do with how you're able to spend your crypto or not. 

>I convert other coins to it when I need to use it for a transaction.

Ah, so this is a key piece of information that you conveniently left out.

Still, you're completely obvious to how these markets work. Everything from spread to security to merchant/processor confidence in value and liquidty is affected by network effect and store of value proposition. BCH is arguably *a lot* worse from this standpoint **and** its processing way fewer transactions. 

Saying "it's better" is just an *argument by assertion*. BTC has **far better liquidity, greater acceptance and is a stronger store of value**. End of story, stop arguing something that you're clearly clueless about. Your position is not well thought out.
im assuming it solves the capacity problem so the next important thing would be network effects.  

* Is it user-friendly - for the masses

* is it designed for easy integration with low-mid size players (marketplaces, small business)

* is it tested enough for large, extremely risk-averse players?  (amazon, big banks, whatever)

- your other points are segwit, which is just a stepping stone, doesn't solve the capacity problem on its own

- bcash being 'just another crypto'.  True, but if bitcoin goes over-capacity like it did in dec, people will use them, technology be damned.  If you can't catch a taxi, you're taking an uber.  Even if the car's a junker and smells.


>im assuming it solves the capacity problem so the next important thing would be network effects.

What the fuck is "network effects"?

LN is the same network as BTC, it shares the same blockchain. BTC network and liquidity = LN network and liquidity. It's one in the same.

> Is it user-friendly - for the masses

This is so obviously a non-issue. This tech can be abstracted into the most basic point and click UX.

>is it tested enough for large, extremely risk-averse players? (amazon, big banks, whatever)

And this means what exactly?


Note that you haven't actually said anything concrete. All you're doing is handwaving. I'm asking about specific metrics and proof of concepts that would grant LN plausibility in your eyes. What you're saying basically amounts to "it'll work if it works.." Yeah, no shit. What are the specifics that would cause you to believe it will work or will likely work? Or do we just have to wait until 8 billion people are using it before you buy into the idea?

Also, what the fuck is bcore legacy? 
*What the fuck is "network effects"?*  

adoption

*This is so obviously a non-issue. This tech can be abstracted into the most basic point and click UX.*

that's the software that could become vaporware.  Company's have risen and fallen based on 'basic point and click UX'

*Note that you haven't actually said anything concrete. All you're doing is handwaving*

I'm just pointing out risks.  These things may or may not happen.
Everyone assumed that bitcoin would be able to make minor changes like blocksize*=2; without problems, yet there were huge problems.  That's why it's called speculation.

*Also, what the fuck is bcore legacy?*

bitcoin core is another name for it





> that's the software that could become vaporware.

Dude, what are you even fucking talking about? What is software that can become vaporware? Abstracting the complexities into a simple interface? Is this a joke? Have you played around with the lnd? This is literally how the default mode works, it opens and closes channels automatically. And this is referring to software that's in early beta. If you can't see how this will be further simplified then I don't know what to tell you, other then you're clueless about how UX design works.

>I'm just pointing out risks. These things may or may not happen. Everyone assumed that bitcoin would be able to make minor changes like blocksize*=2; without problems, yet there were huge problems.

Again, what are you even talking about? Your arguments make absolutely no sense. All you're doing is concern trolling and hand waving, which I've seen you do countless times before. Perhaps, you shouldn't make such outrageous statements if you don't understand how the technology works in the slightest. No offense, but you don't actually have a substantive argument just a series of what if statements that are easily refuted. You're the worst kind of shill because you're technologically inept, as is readily clear from your comments. If you want to spread FUD, at least learn the fucking basics of Bitcoin, LN and UX. This is about as weak of an argument as I've seen. Try harder.

Also, please note how many points you've conveniently skipped over when you don't have a FUD-worthy response. An intellectually honest individual would address these points instead of skipping over them when they don't align with your narrative. Go shill BCash somewhere else.
*And this is referring to software that's in early beta.*

endless beta is a form of vaporware

*would address these points*

if they are separate points i don't need to counter them.  I may even agree with them, or have no opinion on the matter.

> endless beta is a form of vaporware

Are you a moron? The beta has been out for 2 fucking months. If that's too long for you then you spin up some code and put out a general release candidate. 

*You've gotta be fucking joking here*

>if they are separate points i don't need to counter them. I may even agree with them.

They aren't separate points. The unifying point is that you clearly don't know what you're talking about. Every comment of yours reads like the ramblings of a tech-illiterate 13 year old who thinks they're introducing thoughtful comments to the debate but, in reality, are just hand waving nonsense. Your points are not even points at all, there's nothing concrete to tie you down to because you speak in completely vague nonsense. 

Believe what you want about 'bcore legacy', but I'm positive that most people have you tagged as a 'clueless idiot', I know I do.  
*Are you a moron? The beta has been out for 2 fucking months.*

endless beta vaporware is a non-zero risk until beta is over.  If VC's had a 100% return on every $ for every $ they invested in betas, they'd be rich.  Bitcoin cash's scalability solution is on-chain and fully adopted by 100% of bitcoin cash users.

*Believe what you want about 'bcore legacy', but I'm positive that most people have you tagged as a 'clueless idiot', I know I do.*

Wow.. tell me what you REALLY think.

> endless beta vaporware is a non-zero risk until beta is over.

Endless beta vaporware? **It's been in beta for 2 months**. How is that endless?

>If VC's had a 100% return on every $ for every $ they invested in betas, they'd be rich.

What does this even mean? We're talking about open source software, you dunce. Go spin up a general release client if you want. Oh wait, you can't code.

>Bitcoin cash's scalability solution is on-chain and fully adopted by 100% of bitcoin cash users.

Lol, 50 Kb blocks is a scalability solution adopted by a handful of shills? How is that proven?

>Wow.. tell me what you REALLY think.

I think you're the worst kind of shill. The kind that feigns objectivity but seeps bias and sock puppetry. You're the kind of person who can repeat buzzwords but when anyone presses you for details, you can't give any. You're completely tech-illiterate, that much is clear, and yet you speak with supposed authority on these topics. It's amusing, I guess but, again, based on your typical vote counts and the responses you're getting most of the time, I have to think most people have you tagged as some sort of bumbling idiot. I know I do. 
*Oh wait, you can't code.*

I can code, but i think its irrelevant to bitcoin trading/speculation.

*tagged as some sort of bumbling idiot.*

madness and genius are often confused

*details, you can't give any*

learning details can be a waste of time, see the 'green lumber fallacy'.  If you want more details, do the research you feel is sufficient to come to a decision.  80/20 rule is pretty good.

> I can code, but i think its irrelevant to bitcoin trading/speculation.

I highly doubt that based on some of the comments you've written. Sure, maybe you can produce a Hello World, but anything substantial? I highly doubt it.

>madness and genius are often confused

No they're really not. They're not mutually exclusive and most people can discern genius like qualities in an individual. Also, actual geniuses don't tend to refer to themselves as such. But please, tell me all about your Mensa membership.

>learning details can be a waste of time, see the 'green lumber fallacy'. If you want more details, do the research you feel is sufficient to come to a decision. 80/20 rule is pretty good.

Lmao, real thinkers don't cite Taleb, the debunked pseudo-intellectual, at every turn. 

"Details don't matter" -- Lol! You're a dope, dude. Go shill that shit somewhere else. 
*Lmao, real thinkers don't cite Taleb, the debunked pseudo-intellectual, at every turn.*

never heard of him until right now, probably you hadn't either

*most people can discern genius like qualities in an individual.*

most people who themselves are highly intelligent, can

*"Details don't matter" -- Lol! You're a dope, dude. Go shill that shit somewhere else.*

they matter, but i'm not a teacher, I trade information, I don't teach.  And too many details can lead to 'analysis paralysis' and make you miss trades.  There's a law of diminishing returns on accumulating details.  At some point further information is not worth the effort to obtain it.







> never heard of him until right now, probably you hadn't either

You're citing Anti Fragile and haven't heard of the author? Right... That dude is referenced more than anyone else by BCash shills. But sure... You've never heard of him... Even though you're citing his ideas.... Sure...


>they matter, but i'm not a teacher,

Oh, *now* they matter. Good to know you're changing your mind over the course of 5 minutes.

>I trade information,

Do you though? I haven't seen you describe one salient piece of information that would be relevant to trading crypto markets. 

>And too many details can lead to 'analysis paralysis' and make you miss trades.

Not in terms of understanding the fundamentals of an asset. 

>There's a law of diminishing returns on accumulating details.

Not when understanding the tech, which you clearly do not.
*Not when understanding the tech, which you clearly do not.*

accumulating knowledge takes time, there's an opportunity cost for that time.

> accumulating knowledge takes time, there's an opportunity cost for that time.

Ah, more random platitudes from the likes of you. Do you ever have anything to say that doesn't read like the inside of a fortune cookie?
I actually take that as a compliment

That's rather sad. 

Though not surprising coming from the person who cites terms that Taleb coined and yet claims to have never heard of the guy.

It's almost like you're just regurgitating buzz words and phrases you heard on the internet. Haven't seen that behavior before....

Also, do you not understand how to markdown a fucking reddit comment?
