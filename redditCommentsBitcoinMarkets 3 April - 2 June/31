The lone red text on this picture tells everything: https://imgur.com/a/nsfvw8D

For the past several weeks, traders have been hype-cycle pumping EOS against BTC & ETH (note: their ratios). Since there's no viable fiat-exit pair for this shitcoin, they used Tether. Now that EOS is finally dumping all the the profit-taking (in USDT) is flowing straight back into the BTC & ETH markets (note [how GDAX is still lagging behind in price & volume](https://imgur.com/a/yGn8smG))

Here's where Tether volume primarily is: https://imgur.com/a/4hOsl8v

Bullish setup for sure and flawless victory by the whales.

Edit: 

spelling, grammar
Well, this is certainly a bit exciting. 

As others have pointed out, this move breaks the market out of two formations. First, and most importantly, the consolidation triangle that has contained the market from $8,640 to $9,750:

https://imgur.com/a/aEAXA5C

Second, the smaller ascending channel/wedge that encapsulated the bounce off of $8,800 the other day:

https://imgur.com/a/g8Da697

Both are significant, but it's actually the smaller formation that you'll want to keep your eye on if you aren't already in position. It's quite likely the market will test the former resistance line to confirm it as support in the not-too-distant future.

It's currently at around $9,350, and would be a decent place to long if the market bounces off of it. 

I wouldn't recommend a short here, despite short-term RSI needing to cool off. 

Yes, you could scalp $100 here or there, but you're just as likely to get steamrolled as the market keeps climbing. 

Things are looking pretty great on the medium to long term as well. 

[3D MACD](https://imgur.com/a/9hGmGQE) has maintained in the green for awhile now and [1W MACD](https://imgur.com/a/CpxmFmy) is looking like it's on its way toward a bullish cross. 

The [3D MA](https://imgur.com/a/tSHfAQw) is also looking like it will see a bullish cross. With the potential for the [1W MA](https://imgur.com/a/Xwmuodq) to follow suit in the not-too-distant future.

So the mid and long term are looking pretty great, and the only concern is in the short term. RSI is overextended on the 5m through the 2h and is approaching overbought conditions on the 4h through the 12h. There's still PLENTY of room to the upside as far as RSI is concerned on the 3d and 1w, however.

This is looking pretty fomolicious.

On the 28th I opened a long at 9450.


Yesterday I closed it at 9200, because I was expecting it to go back down to the 8900 range. Then I went to bed.



That's my sad story for you guys.
Anyone watching CNBC right now? They’re talking about “hodlers”. Lmao
lol @ the Bitmex $500 5min candle... thing wicked wayyyy deep.  

By some miracle, I was able to place a short at $9735 right as we fell off the line... I then market closed it literally 10 seconds later. BitMex awarded me the middle of that wild candle at $9560.  I'll take it. 


Just an aside, but it's pretty hilarious to me that Bitmex somehow managed to remain bearish throughout the entire pump from $6,800 to $9,400 and is deciding that **now** is suddenly the time to reverse course. 

Both the June and September contracts were trading in backwardation as recently as a few days ago (meaning less than spot price). Fast forward to right now and June is at about a $160 premium whereas September is at a $200 premium. 

To put that in perspective, this morning June futures went from $9,250 to $9,890 while spot moved from $9,200 to $9,730. 

In effect, anybody who longed either contract period this morning made an additional 1.5% to 2% * (leverage used) on their entry. Even more if you went long earlier. Even a modest 5x position saw an additional 10% in gains on September.

Conversely, anybody who shorted this morning got boned an additional 1.5% to 2% * (leverage used) on their entry.
My guess is that this will make another attempt at $9750 ... if it fails again to break upward, it'll pull back to around $9400 before the next leg up.

I'm short from $9730 and moved my stops to $9850

Edit:  Decided to close my position at 97% ROE and wait for potential $9750 retest
We just broke [upward from the large pennant](https://www.tradingview.com/x/pWbfDr2p/), and just broke $9350.  

I see some people opening shorts here...yikes...  I'd advise waiting until the $9550 range.
[removed]
This has to be a breakout, 9442, above all lines i have and stil going
Stalling @resistance, a big bear div on almost all time frames, a high volume shooting star once again, a potential double top, a high funding rate for longs as well as a hot RSI make me open a small short that won't hurt if we move up at all but is a good short to add to.

!short xbtusd 9795 stop 10010
This is the first time I’ve ever said this

Fomoed in at $9,536, and currently up for a profit. 

Should I take profits? Or let it ride.. I’ve never successfully fomoed before 
My brain is seeing patterns

I think the low Bitcoin dominance provides an opportunity for a large and fast move up if alt holders fomo into a btc break above 10k. We saw this a couple of times last year. Btc waiting to light the touch paper but there is enough fuel there to see a really BGD or a series of them that could quickly move us into the mid teens. Just some thought for those over exposed to alts. Measure your wealth in btc and take profits regularly. 

I don't use TA massively and think this could be an example of something that is not fully taken into account relying solely on TA.

Remain bullish and confident of new ATH this year. 2020 Halving talk (another very significant event not TA related) will start to take hold end of this year start of next which will help continue momentum. 
finex margin longs are increasing with fast speed. around 2.5k in the last 2 hours. 
consolidating pretty well at 9.6K so I'm guessing the next move up should come shortly 
The longer this stays above $9600, the less confident I feel in shorting... sitting on my hands currently... we should get a move here soon.

I still think there's a good possibility of another attempt at $9750... if rejected, I'll open a short.  Long if we push through.

Edit: Wedge just broke upward on BitMex

The next wave of new entrants hasn't yet begun.

Will $10k media be the catalyst?
I read the text book twice just to make sure... and this is 100&#37; a bull flag.

Edit: I read it a third time, this is still a bull flag.

\- TA Guy
That was quick, stopped by 15$ on kraken...

!short xbtusd close 9469
Any chance at all of this thing pushing straight through 10k? 

Bitcoin does have a tendency to defy expectation 
[removed]
Feeling the FOMO bad today, but it's the same magnitude as the dread I was feeling that the bottom would fall out as we were chilling in the 6.5k range not too long ago.

I'm not buying here as I still think we are on the other side of the 8k magnet. This hype is traders being traders in my opinion, but I'd love to be wrong here.

Buys at 8k and lower, 10% FOMO buy if we break 9.8k, and another 10% FOMO buy just past 10k. 


I am trying to understand what the LONG/SHORT ratio tells us. 

If we look at BTC its currently at 1.18. When it was under 1 we witnessed the recent short squeeze. It makes sense to me that this ratio should be close to 1.

Now looking at some other altcoins this ratio is 5 (EOS) or even 9 (XRP). So I wonder, how is this sustained without them imploding on a long squeeze ? What is preventing that?

I am not trying to start an altcoin discussion, just trying to understand how this ratio works.

 
Is it just me or is there only like 500 btc between here and 10k on BFX?
is the bull flag still validated?
Jeez, this feels like it really wants to go up, basically as soon as the 30m RSI dipped below 70 it just started climbing again.
Genuinely curious, anyone think the news regarding Goldman Sachs intentions on trading Bitcoin is helping drive the price up?
Show of hands, who just bought into [that](https://imgur.com/wfNTAZm) deception ;)

(I admit I just threw in a few more contracts, but nothing troubling)
Shorting $1mm @ $9681. Stops if we reach $9900+ with conviction, enjoying these swap funding payments until then.

!short xbtusd 9681 10x 0.05
I’ve accomplished like 20% of the stuff I was supposed to do today. 

#Thanks Bitcoin
5/3/18 UPDATE. My last update was on [4/30/18]( https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8fwtzb/daily_discussion_monday_april_30_2018/dy8f5hx/) where I had turned more neutral/moderately bearish on the market due to some of the longer-term indicators I use. I planned to take mild profits across BTC, ETH and some alts, but ironically enough the market dropped shortly after I posted, so I was only able to exit some of my ETH positions and held off on taking any profits in BTC and alts as I was unsure if the market had stabilized or would continue moving downward. I have since re-entered my ETH position (yesterday morning around 6am PDT, five of nine laddered limit orders were triggered). Additionally, after we broke through the pink resistance line, I accumulated some BTC in the $9,375-$9,425 range as I said I would in the [4/30/18 “Bull Case”](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8fwtzb/daily_discussion_monday_april_30_2018/dy8f5hx/).

I want to take a second to reflect on my prior forecasts and how the market has performed since then, as I think it’s important to keep score of prior accuracy. In my last update, I provided four scenarios for where the market might go. We have followed the “Bull Case,” which called for decisively breaking through the pink resistance line, which we just completed, but we also broke through the two immediate supports. I believe we will likely test $10,000 within the next 5-7 days, but it could be a bit further out (8-10 days) depending on how the market performs this weekend. In my second to last update on [4/25/18 PM](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8eqr52/daily_discussion_wednesday_april_25_2018/dxyoabr/), I provided four scenarios – Uber Bull, Bull, Bull Lite, Sideways, denoted by the four bright green arrows – for where I saw the market heading during the ultra-short/short term. We have stayed almost entirely within this range over the past 8 days and appear to be following a path somewhere on the high side between the “Bull Lite Case” and the “Sideways Case,” which likely indicates a test of ~$9,965 in 7 days.

Here are the updates to my chart: the new support line is black and the two supports from 4/30 (which were aqua and light blue) are now grey.

Here are the new charts:     
Here’s the [macro view](https://www.tradingview.com/x/vqr32wcu/).     
Here’s the [channel view](https://www.tradingview.com/x/W8xVmw37/).     
Here’s the [zoomed in view](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Nsb68WUc/).     

*Please note: I use log scales, but manually zoom in for the micro views. (Someone PM’d me specifically asking about this.)*     

For today’s update, I currently don’t have time to plot out four new scenarios, but I will try to circle back this weekend. I’m shifting my view from “neutral/moderately bearish” to “neutral/moderately bullish” for a few reasons, but the biggest one is that the pull back that started on 5/1 0:00:00 UTC was less steep than expected, which indicates less selling pressure and strong buyer demand. Further, we blew through the pink resistance line with a $260 candle (on the 4h chart) which isn’t exactly a BGD, but it’s still strong. Over the next 24 hours, I project further BTC price increases along with some sideways movement over the weekend and possibly a small pullback between now and Wednesday next week. By the end of next week, I believe we will be in the process of testing $10,000. Please note, I consider sideways movement positive after large upward swings as it helps build strong support. I think that healthy accumulation periods are a contributing factor to why our pull backs have become less and less severe over the past 6+ weeks. Lastly, if the price stays aggressive in the next 24 hours, we don’t repeat blowing off the top and we don’t have a pullback early-mid next week, we could see a test of $10,000 as soon as later this weekend/early next week.
Fun Facts(TM):

At this point in the late-2013 crash we were at $548 , or, 47.1% of ATH.

That would be like $9,267 today.

If things play out exactly the same we'll hit a second peak of $11,515 on June 20 before going back down. **




But but but... Maybe this is like the early-2013 crash - in that case we'd be at $8,590 today, and go straight up back to ATH on July 14!

** [10 days later Peter Todd freaks out and dumps half his coins](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/281ftd/why_i_just_sold_50_of_my_bitcoins_ghashio/)

Short from 9490 fully closed @ an average of 9422. It looks like we're painting a textbook bull flag and I don't want to stay in front of this rocket.
RSI Basicals:

Bear Market: Buy 30 sell 70

Anyone here bearish about btc/usd. If yes why? We're talking short/medium term ( a few weeks)
Just poking our tip through 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/6oTbznHp/

Resistance around $9,350 is ridiculous, currently watching binance 
If this is breakout tries to retest resistance-to-support I'll have to rethink the reentry point for a long, if at all.  So think I'm gonna set profitable stops a bit above the midway point of the larger pennant/triangle now.
Currently 1x long with my whole stack from CA 9150. Thinking about increasing leverage and adding some around 9400. Would you recommend it or just let the 1x ride? Seems pretty bullish to me. 

Edited: shouldnt have hesitated.
No chart, just some quick thoughts:

- Next stop for a consolidation or reversal could be 9.7k, which is a high volume node locally and even a small outcropping on VPVR more long term. Would be confluence with a .618 FIB retrace of 11.8k to 6.4k and horizontal resistance of our last local high.

- If that breaks up, it'll probably continue past 10k which, while a psychological resistance, doesn't seem to have ever held insanely strong. That could possibly confirm an iH&S with an admittedly weak right shoulder. Not many volume nodes to go off of past this huge node from 8k to 9.7k until the relatively smaller node in the low 11k range.

If you couldn't tell I've really been on a VPVR kick lately.
FOMO Long from $9,536 with not too large of a stack.

Would it be a bad idea to add again at $9,800 if it starts to act as support? 
Is anyone Tier 3 on Kraken? 

How safe is it to submit my SS #, Photo ID, ect.
So I just read one of the reddit cofounders thinks BTC will go back to 20k this year but more importantly ETH will go to 15k. So a 1.5 trillion market cap from its current 70 billion. Within 8 months.

Are these people really that stupid or just blatant scammers?
Sold some BTC today.

Damn, it's tough not to re-enter immediately. 

I'm not sure whether I'm more or less comfortable holding dollars at this point.
My FOMO-meter is kicking in again, the same that got me a buy at the recent high (around $11.3?), until we pass that high I think being wary is the best option, the bear is still here
Ugh I hope we can blow past 9700 just so we can burst a few egos in this thread. 
The manipulation of GDAX to create an arbitrage opportunity is pretty savvy by whoever is doing it.

By manipulation I just mean taking advantage of thin orderbooks, not crazy tin foil here... just basic money making tactics.

The fact that the order books are so thin on the buyside though... a little scary. Hidden buyers you better be ready...
falling wedge. next leg up to.... sub 10k. lol.
If this is a textbook bull flag yet some are calling for a cool off to 9350 ( resistant turned support ) won't that invalidate the flag?
Longs are looking at paying shorts .178% next funding period.... wowza
Sell wall on gdax can't make up its mind whether to be 62btc or 3.
Jebus.  This thing is on a tear.  I have a take profit setup at $9750; we may not slow down prior
[removed]
Closing my 10x long from last night here.  Waiting for better re entry. Still bullish.
I am surpised by this pump today, but I am more surprised how little volume was needed to get it up to here. If you compare it to the first 9.7k spike, the volume now is much lower. What does this tell us?
Closed 9765 short here @9657. Somebody pls help me to not flip floppening so often between positions.

Edit reasoning: I don't have one it feels like a mad bull is looking at me while I have a red sell scarf on my neck.
Looks like another textbook bull flag forming on the hourly. The previous one broke up, so I'm hopeful this one might too.
5 minutes to daily candle, its about to get exciting
The bitmex dump is insane, candle is having a seizure
Long from 9179 (1/4 of trading stack). Nice [bull flag](https://www.tradingview.com/x/sT3ojBvp/), ETH is leading, new [channel](https://www.tradingview.com/x/jJfQE65A/) should take us to the top of the triangle. If we don't break it now I will ad until the bottom of the triangle and eventually bail if 8.8k fails.
I'm much more comfortable with this BTC pump. Compared to the previous ones, it's not bleeding the alts as much, meaning more people are really buying BTC and less trading their alt profits back to BTC. I think this one will make some great moves. 
Move, bitch, get out the way.

Preparing to take profits at Target 3 ($9950) from my **LONG** posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8g5owl/daily_discussion_tuesday_may_01_2018/dy9xigj/).
I was beyond excited at 9600, infinitely excited at 9700, I guess this is the time to be uncountably infinitely excited.
We have an altcoin thread that's being ignored. Let's use it.

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8gnlzd/altcoin_discussion_thursday_may_03_2018

I'm giving out free day passes to the sin bin on new posts that ignore the alt thread and rule 2.
Risking a small short here, it's probably a kamikaze short but should be enough resistance above to at least test 9200 again. Stops @9469

!short XBTUSD 9337 5X 0.4 -sl 9469
Bulls absolutely fucking RELENTLESS. You fuckers! [I stated](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8g5owl/daily_discussion_tuesday_may_01_2018/dy931sx/) that I wasn't buying the pump lately, but after breaking out of this triangle, and yet another BGD, I'm starting to turn really bullish. I think I was flat out wrong.

On the next pullback, I'll YOLO buy all in, as I'm now fairly confident we're on our way out of the bear market. 

What are folks' targets for pullbacks? $9700 seems formidable resistance, right? 
I'm feeling a very bullish sentiment, at least for the next two days, right?
Can't seem to take my eyes off the battle for 9,300 on finex 

Edit - well that was anticlimactic 
Ok, my two sats here on the subject. 

Having spent way too much time watching the BTC price action in finex today - combined with normal tracking of the past weeks trading - I am left as though BYC is dog itching to be let loose. 
bitmex engine just made me throw my tendies all over the floor.  Adding more on the way up is purely impossible =/ 
Can't trade this, but will get nervous if 9.7 gets rejected. Have a stop loss set at 9.5 
Sold a portion of my stack from 9175 at 9650 for a decent profit. Just missed another Limit sale at 9730. Assuming that it doesn't just keep pumping, I'm targeting a retrace to ~9500 to reenter with my profits.
Bitfinex appears to have USD wire deposit / withdrawal options enabled again. Didn't see any announcement about that, but that seems significant. Anyone know when that was re-implemented?
It appears that the base of the previous pitchfork channel that took us here has *also been hit as resistance.  https://imgur.com/T99fHBt  (yeah yeah, too may lines, and 4hr (not 12) is the preferred display scale for these lines to fit the candles & wicks, but thought I would share this observation)
Does this flag pole start from 9.2 or 9.4?
15min RSI in a rising wedge with target of 110.
TA don't lie!
Swing short open with a stop loss @ 9899, it seems like 9900 will be the 10k point of no return.
Got some orders filled on bitmex that I didn’t think would happen within one minute. I’m happy about that.
When would be a good time for re-entry? It looks like BTC bounced off of 0.5 retracement, and anywhere from 9425(level support) and 9456(0.618 support) would be good. (But conservatively 9500)

EDIT:
https://www.tradingview.com/x/YbilsYr0/
I'm sure this has probably been asked before, but I was watching the recent trades box on Bitmex and I noticed there was a purchase order of 1 contract made every second regardless of where the market was trending.  Does anyone know what's up with this? I'm guessing it's likely a bot of some sort but I just don't understand where the value in making a meaningless trade every second and having to pay taker fees as well and what sort of value the bot maker could be getting.  I'm aware of the use of bots for automated trading but I just don't understand what sort of value someone could be getting by running one in this fashion.
Opened a small 5x short a little above 9600... 30M RSI is around 85 and I figure it'll have to cool down sooner or later (very overbought on everything from 4h down).  Will eat the loss if RSI resets without a decent pullback or if it blitzes past 10k.  No target at the moment, going to play it by ear.
I closed my long at 9740...I"ll wait till I see 9.8k go with conviction..too afraid of double top hahha
!short xbtusd close 9650

Edit: Going to bed. Hate sleeping with a position open.
We have the double 1d tk cross coming up and were soon getting a golden cross on the EMA. Good time to scale into a long imo. First target 10.3-10.5k   
https://www.tradingview.com/x/twzDXy8k/   
I wanted to add some rocketships but idk how :(    
[my target](https://www.tradingview.com/x/2sYuRGZo/) planning to sell 50% here and rebuy 200ma if all goes well
Gave it your all, bears. Now hit the showers.

**LONG** still in place. Target 1 hit. Confident Target 2 ($9550) follows soon. Look at that volume spike. 

Edit: Target 2 confirmed. Target 3 incoming!

Re-iterating [my comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8e8qok/daily_discussion_monday_april_23_2018/dxtmbf5/) from April 23rd:

> Altcoins are getting pumped so that sell pressure on BTC is reduced when the whales decide to pump it through resistance levels (9.2k, 11.5k, 17k) and altcoin bagholders will provide additional boost through FOMO.

Holy BGD Batman!
Aaaand... the dumps get weaker still. Will the pumps become correspondingly stronger? 

Magic 8 Ball: It is certain.
[removed]
Not gonna be greedy on the SL and watch profits disappear if this thing bounces or ends up eroding away.  Now set to *9400ish.

Edit:

Thanks for sharing that chart with me /u/haserfauld   I hadn't extended my channel line, it supports that one spot on the pump so well.  Have adjusted accordingly!

Prices below are fut prices not spot, unless otherwise noted.

June 8950: SL is 9388 to match a nice safe placement on spot price of the chart which would roughly be 9330, and the premium should help protect.  I realized that going 9400+ on that is pointless as it doesn't affect the profit much at all.

Sept 9400 Fomo long (been adding to it all day since we crossed the triangle) is harder to deal with though.  I already took 15% profit off it at 9900 but will save the rest for if spot goes 10k+.  I've set this to 9490 which roughly is 9390 on the spot chart. 

Used 13:30 utc candle, for spot/fut price comparison.  It's the candle where the resistance line of that little upward channel intersects.
should i close my long from 8940? i am getting greedy
Missed some nice trades today because Bitmexico totally went down. Still watching my triangle here https://www.tradingview.com/x/nlkA28uQ 
I didn't expect that so soon....thankfully got out of my mega hedge short with about 1% loss.  I did the right thing getting in and getting out, regardless of where the price goes from here.
So I just took profits from one long position who's ca is too close, while adding to another long position who's ca is far away.

Feels schizophrenic but the risk management is well insured. I don't have to give a shit which direction the price goes.

edit: at 9600
RSI-wise I think it's worth mentioning that we have a pretty large bear div on 2h and higher+ a pretty big shooting star on the 30min coming from the top with high volume. I wouldn't touch a long right now even if I immediately got 1% on top. Waiting for a breakout up is incredibly important here.

Edit: Also this second attempt happened on much lower volume. There are quiet a lot of parallels to the 11.7k double top BUT the candle formation on the daily has me hopeful.
Regardless the FOMO here, I will short if we get into the higher 9.7ks again. 

The volume is just not high enough to really make this pump highly relevant. What I read here:  [http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart\_school:chart\_analysis:chart\_patterns:double\_top\_reversal](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:chart_patterns:double_top_reversal)

**Second Peak**: The advance off the lows usually occurs with low volume and meets resistance from the previous high. 

My assumptions is that short time RSIs are too overbought to bring us quickly above 10k even if this does not fold out as a double top.
I posted on Tuesday that I suspected we were in the reaccumulation phase of a reaccumulation --> mark up --> distribution.

Still in my $9,040 long, trying to pick a target. Thoughts?

https://old.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8g5owl/daily_discussion_tuesday_may_01_2018/dyai5at/
Well I'm no longer excited
anyone else really impressed by how well BTC is staying above 9.6k? the case for a double top is getting harder and harder to justify.
Good news is that we've set a higher high. Bad news is that we're probably in for for a higher low, now. Another thing to note is that the premiums are back on the Bitmex futures.

On another note, I'm looking for a change in my price ticker app. Are there any you recommend? I'm specifically interested in one that lets me set the sound to the alarms I set. Thanks in advance :) 
How come no one is talking about eth and ripple potentially being classified as a (noncompliant) security?

What're everyone's thoughts on this? How bearish would it be for eth/xrp/alts? Would it affect btc as well?

What do you think, /u/fuckharvey? 

The meeting for the SEC and the CFTC is apparently on Monday. I'm slowly seeing people mention it but not on this sub.

Would eth being classified as a potentially noncompliant security mean tons of money flowing into btc? Or would regulations and loss of faith in alts and ICOs and stuff destroy the space as a whole?

At the risk of getting banned again:

There is a certain commodity that exists in the world which affects the bitcoin market.  This commodity tends to pump it's ratio a bit before BTC pumps.  It is doing that again.

Let's pray we don't get a double top at $9700.  That could prove to be really, really bad.   I wish the price would cool off here for a few days and then take out $9900 with confidence.
Alts pumping, Parabolic Trav shitposting instead of flipping burgers, unironic talk of new ATHs this year...you guys think that was *it*? That was enough pain, despair, and capitulation?

This feels like $11K did a few months ago: half of me wants to FOMO all in with the rest of you, but the other half realizes that up, up, up (with no major retrace) combined with the fact that the bottom is so far down that you need binoculars to see it means this is an incredibly dangerous place for a long. I watch the YOLO market buys at $9.5K+ and shake my head; l wish I could be that naively confident....
stop triggered. 100 USD difference loss... :\(
we are sitting exactly at the line that connect the two prevoius tops. 
Of course. Closed half my long position in the past days because funding started to get too expensive on bitfinex, and now it breaks out upwards. What else. Makes my tinfoil senses tingle too...
If we apply the classical price target for a symmetrical triangle:

> Price Target: There are two methods to estimate the extent of the move after the breakout. First, the widest distance of the symmetrical triangle can be measured and applied to the breakout point. Second, a trend line can be drawn parallel to the pattern's trend line that slopes (up or down) in the direction of the break. The extension of this line will mark a potential breakout target.

It gives us two potential targets: https://www.tradingview.com/x/6Bz4w89O/

* First is 10k (psychological number)

* Second is 10.5-10.7k, which is the 0.786 fib level taken from the retracement from 11.7k to 6.5k.

We'll definitely meet some resistance at 9.7k though but it will be our second try and I feel like 10k is like a magnet. 


That was a considerable pump, but the volume has barely moved the needle. 

Nothing near the volume we've seen on similar size pumps in recent weeks.
funding on bitmex is a 0.3 x 3 daily (almost 300% APR lol)..
but i dont think anyone has the ball to collect... very bullish anticipation of a breakout here.  Though betting on a breakout is never an easy bet.
I've not seen funding like this since the bull run last year.. and its the reason fuckharvey was able to survive as a bear back then.




I think whenever we hit $10k, fomo will ramp up significantly. Likely lots of media coverage will happen then. 
First time in recent times I can say this is a FOMO run. Everything else is diving.
u/MikeXBT you dodged a .50 cal bullet, good thing you closed.
The fact that everyone is waiting waiting for a double top might just mean its gonna blow past it (expect the unexpected)... I guess we'll see very soon.

Not being snarky, but who thinks $3k Bitcoin is still a possibility?
Is there a way to convert EUR to USD on Kraken? EURUSD is a complete mess and so is BTCEUR. I really would like to trade BTCUSD but it plain doesn't work, even if I use leverage.
On Bitfinex, some of my long is financed by (auto-taken) funding at 0.125%/day (the funding type is "daily"). The current rates are only 0.09%/day.

Is there a way to exchange my funding so that I can get it at the cheaper current rate, without changing anything else to my long?
650k contracts bid on OKEX quarterlies at 9950!!! woooot . Panic closing short or what?   
one contract is $100, fyi
alts are getting sucked into btc as we speak, the FOMO may bring it to 10 k easily

https://www.tradingview.com/x/BtOz2XO2/

I’m going to start layering buys between 9,415-9,350

Will bail if we break $9,300, as this would seem to be one ol’ big fakeout 
Small scalp short @9490. RSI is pretty hot on lower timeframes and breakout volume isn't that great. Targeting at least 9350 as retest. Stops above 9600.

Edit: Half closed 9425.
This is exactly what happened on the second re-test of $11.8k and how the drop started. (And yes it happened right before the close on the daily) Would be careful here longing - wait till a break of $9.8k or get your iron clad gloves on.
Short from 9210 USD, stop at 9310 USD. 
The spread btw finex and binance was like 150 during the last Tue dip, while 200 btw finex and gdax. Binance was way lower during the dump, and it's liquid enough on btc/usdt. Why wouldn't an arb bot mkt buy on binance and mkt short on finex at the same time to equalize the price? Plenty of whale bot money doing arb? I'd get into the short/long arb myself, but I can't see such arb opportunities lasting for very long as even more pro capital jumps into arb.
Well, now it counts. We need 9800+ to break out into a new high daily, (not all time high, i mean since we left the lows) - otherwise this may turn... not so nice.
Long from 8.9, SL at 9.4 in case this goes south quick but I'm praying this is the one. 
What's the significance of this 9750 price?  Why the hard rejection?
[removed]
Should we be expecting a dip when the next bmex funding period hits?
Is anyone worried that alts are approaching their aths? Most alts are up ~100% for the month, and I canmt imagine this bodes well for the king. Should we be expecting a big correction soon? Or is this organic growth 
for the past two or three months, the slow build up is really amazing. the support built up from this lengthy sideways/accumulation phase makes me bullish long term, although not Lambo bullish simply because it's too slow. I'll be happy with just 10k a year being added to the price.
Entered short 9600. SL:9850. Targets 8600-8400.

Gonna be interesting night. off to the shops to get some bread and biscuits, need some fuel
Went short 3x at $9621. Not my strongest position but I can see a mild retrace before we continue upwards. Target is $9200.

$150\+ premiums currently. It's time to start building shorts IMO. 
Morning gang.

Looks like today is just gonna be tight and choppy although that can literally change any second.

I'm still thinking we're gonna drop one more time before the next big bull run. Why do i think that? i tried to think from the perspective of a whale. if i was a whale rn, id want max btc accumulation and then btc bullrun.

how? i reckon, when we break the holy 10k then media will start to pick up on it. bitcoin will slowly be creeping into the mainstream again kinda like in december. but if i was a whale, i wouldnt want this to happen untill my btc holding are huge. assuming im some magic whale if total market power, id drop it down to 7600-7400. everyone shits themselves, alts tank. i buy cheap btc, cheap alts and slowly start raising the price like we did this month, we break 10k and go to Valhalla.

What am i actually doing? have a preset plan which i outlined in my last post so gonna stick to that, kick my feet up and enjoy the rare occourance that is sunshine in my country.

Good luck fam

Wait seriously wtf is going on... someone is definitely trying to force a price gap between finex and gdax. Am I turning into a tinfoil hat guy -_-.

One of the most annoying things in crypto discussions is that people can not differentiate between trading and investing. Not sure why,  but one thing that is clear is that if you do one and think you doing the other you will fail
[deleted]
I just dumped the last of my alts (previously 35% of my crypto) for BTC. I am 100% in BTC right now. It seems like the safest play in my mind. 

Scenario 1: We breakout soon and I see nice $ gains holding BTC. "Oh no, no big alt rally for me!" Whatever, pigs get slaughtered. 


Scenario 2: We breakout upward and alts lose BTC value meaning I increased my purchasing power to rebuy. (I do support a few specific alt coins in the long-run.)


Scenario 3: We breakout down, and alts typically drop harder and faster. 


Timestamped at exactly 36% BTC.


I simply don't believe any new money coming back into crypto will immediately invest in *insert shitcoin XYZ here*. They will have heard of friends getting burned and most likely hold BTC for a few months, and this will lead to a strong rally. That's just my guess. If the alt coin markets go 500x I'll be pissed, but I'd much rather miss out on that than have btc go off the rails and all my alts lose BTC value. 



***I don't want to be the guy who knew of crypto in 2017-2018 and didn't hold BTC, the coin most likely to actually keep value in the long-term.*** 
anybody else sitting on their hands? I think the prices will be higher by end of May if I just hold for a month but I just cant seem to enter the market right now.. Whales will probably keep moving BTC sideways and occasionally pump
IT's looking like a pretty solid pump here. Currently fighting the top of the pennant and I think we'll pop through. 
well poo, should have yolo longed lmao
Bitmex engine been frozen for the past few minutes.
Looks like it's helping to fuel this massive fucking pump as everyone is spamming market orders trying to get a position in and it's eating up the books.  Wonder if this is sustainable or we retrace.

Sigh. closed my long last night because i wouldn't be at the trading station until pretty much now.

I'm considering just opening another small long because of this bull flag potentially breaking upwards, and putting super tight stops just below it in case we can't break the resistance of 9700. 

Thoughts?

edit: sometimes you just need /r/bitcoinmarkets to slap some sense into you. i will wait lol

*what the fuck* 

Didn’t even have time to scale in buys

##FOMO IS REAL 

Edit: Fomoed in at $9,534. Praise the lord 
Bear divergence after that daily close. Could be reason for the sell off. 
Again I’m happy for the bull run made some money good stuff. In fact I could argue that it may keep running to 11.7k. Ultimately though this run was preceded by Gdax surpression and included low volume. Blessed to those who long here I’ve taken profits and will just wait. It is manufactured. I say this as someone who watches charts on a minute by minute basis. It's like they want us to think double top and will manipulate our emotions around it.... we need some regulation. Wash trading is rampant. I’ll ride it for my profit but to say this market isn’t being used is a lie... it’s too easy to use and to easy to transfer funds.

The internet lead to google and amazon. It also lead to trolls and YouTube comments.

If you aren’t long term holding just be aware, my advice.
would anyone like to explain to me why this isn’t just alt traders cashing out to BTC and the exodus to fiat is imminent. Bitcoin is rapping at the door of 10k and let’s be honet, this correction was weak af. 6k??? we were only ever at those price levels for days at a time. 20k was an immense blow off top, if you don’t count the wicks on the weeklies, the top was 17.5k, which puts 6k at 34%, hardly anything to cry about, especially when a simple hodler came out on top if they dca in more.

Im not short, 1x long (no futs), and I just don’t see how anything is different than 11.7k in early March.

A&E double bottom? Doesn’t that sound like a too perfect story? Yes, we could go absolutely parabolic this year, I get it. But why would we?

I want BTc to go way higher, but I just think the bear market is far from over
I think it is the first time that I see the 1m Bbands touching each other without the downtime of an exchange. 
Experts, can y'all provide some reading or explanation of shorting/going long using Bitmex futures vs spot product?

I'd like to stay in an extended short/long position but in times like these the fees on the perpetuals is too high. I read before that futures doesn't have the daily interest rate, but the comments were here and there. Does anyone have a definitive guide to spot vs futures on Bitmex?

Thanks in advance, during, and after!
Sorry that I keep mentioning alts, but I think it's very relevant for BTC: for the first time since the dip at 6400 alts are not following a BTC pump, which is pretty much like [how I was expecting](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8gelu0/daily_discussion_wednesday_may_02_2018/dyc7opb/). I'm very eager to see how this will play out.

Hey guys, I was wondering if anyone could give me their thoughts on this hedge play I just made.  So long term, I am bullish on BTC.  However, after the rise today I don't really have a ton of faith in maintaining its price in the short term.  So I went short with 1.5% of my holdings at 50x leverage @ 9440 and it's liquidation price is a bit over 9580.  My thought's are that if it reaches the liquidation price we are probably on our way to testing the resistance at 9700.  I'm still technically long overall and my USD balance would increase even if my position is liquidated however if bitcoin falls I a bit I would be preserving some of my USD value.  Any thoughts?  Are plays like this a good idea when you don't have a lot of faith in a rally?  Is there a way to make a play to accomplish my goal>
why is there such a massive spread between finex and gdax?
I covered 1/3 of my mega short for small profit.  Bull flag at $9700 is obviously....bullish.   But still betting a $200 drop is much more likely than a $200 rise here.

edit:  reshorted to full amount and avg entry is $9710 now.
It seems like we just can’t push above that $9700. This is like the 5th time we hover at this level, but maybe it will blow past tonight. 
Can someone check if I'm seeing this right? The site I use to check my tx confirmations says the last BTC block was over 2 hours ago?

Edit: Okay maybe not, [Blockchain.info](https://blockchain.info/) says the last one was 2hrs 11mins ago, [Blocktrail](https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/blocks/1) says the last one was 6mins ago. Just Blockchain.info fucking up again I guess
The price range and decreasing volume uncannily resembles 17-04-2017. BTC started its year long bull run and it was never sub 1K after that point.
[deleted]
I think if total cap closes above 500m here in the next few hours or days, it could officially be start of the next cycle. However, if it cant break that resistance I think were going to make year lows. 
What's going on with the Bitmex insurance fund?   It seems to have dipped sharply from 300 to 119 XBT.   There was a previous dipping event on April 26 where it went from 1076 to 173 XBT.
Double top again? Say it ain't so. I would love one more dip to add for lifetime hold, tho

Bump because of Goldman ?
I'm not a bear, but i still think price will drop below $6k. opinions?
Alas don't have much time to follow the charts these days. Are we now exactly at the new log-downtrend from 20k? This is how I have it (new log-downtrend = green line):

https://www.tradingview.com/x/IJj84BoQ/

And what do people think about this line? My gut feeling is that this new line is much less established than the previous logdowntrend (blue line), which got so strong from the 3 prominent peaks 20, 17.2, 11.7, and therefore the new line might be much less significant (?).

Also, the symm. triangle between the green and the red line (uptrend line from last year through Feb 6k trough) is closing in 4 days, so this should probably give a decision about the next direction?

All in BTC and holding my long so far.
What incredible levels of manipulaton and fuckery in this market.  That was a good reminder.  I said earlier could be a manipulated bull trap and that's what it turned out to be...seen it so many times before.  And I wasn't even thinking about the daily candle, but the timing was no coincidence.

so am i like a TA god for stating the obvious an hour ago that we would break 9350, 9400, with 9500 on the way?

or does it only qualify if i draw a bunch of stupid lines pointing down, circle some RSI indicators red, and make a bunch of if/then statements to cover my ass in case i'm wrong because i sat in fiat too long (with my $500 portfolio) and praying for $2K to come?
Super happy about the movement but it just doesn't feel right...
We gunna do it?!  I dont think so.  But boy it'd be a fun start to the weekend.

They will do the same with btc topping between 8.7 and 10k. Pick low ratio easily pumpabale alt(s)
> . Since there's no viable fiat-exit pair for this shitcoin, they used Tether.

Kraken has EUR and USD pairs since 2 months...
Thank you for the great insight and detailed explanation.
Thanks for your perspective!
It seems to make another contact on the line from 11k 7 to 9k7 no? 
Yes... while shorter time frames are overbought, price may continue up if enough fomo sets in... here's [one possible scenario](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Y8pJh943/) which mirrors the previous run and would take us to $10k
What is your take on the altcoin runs so far? Most alts are up 100% for the month, ETH is past the 50% mark on the ratio ATH (and shows no signs of stopping as people continue to buy that shitcoin up).

Isn't this all a little worrysome for Crypto and Bitcoin as a whole?
Yup.  It's even broken out of the ascending channel we took to get to the resistance line.
We found the guy that was stalling us!

Jokes aside, i've been there, and with a bigger loss than yours. My advice, stop trading for a day. Revenge trading is the worst, and i've done it more times that i like to admit. 

> On the 28th I opened a long at 9450.

I thought this said "on the 28th **try** I opened at long..."

I was like, damn you got lucky, takes me at least 300 tries.

Might want to go pick up a lottery ticket my dude.
Wow, for once futs gave me better wick protection than swaps.
I went to cash at 9778.  I'm still new and not ready to really trade.  Since you are on a hot streak, should I wait until 9800 holds to get back in or is there a lower number that you would expect a bounce?  Thanks! 
I'm all tingly inside because I opened long on the September futures at 6410 lol. 
I have no clue either. The real question is will the $150 premium hold if the market pulls back even 3-5%.

Also, if this just went sideways for 5 weeks from here, I'd be ok with it. Just pay me 0.65%/day for 5 weeks and I'll be a happy camper.
It just proves that no one on this planet with significant amount of money knows what the fair price of Bitcoin should be.
seems plausible, BTC is like a soda machine, you need to rock it back a few times before you can turn it over.
That's a really nice move. I wish I had the balls to hold a position for once. But why stops @9850? I'd think 10k would be the better stop especially since last recovery we got there and immediately dumped 500$.
Exactly... What's the opposite of 'catching a falling knife' ?  

volume is such poop for this to be BO

You said you had buys set for just above the pennant if it breaks..

Are you adding some longs? 
perfect timing
Noice one. 
Bot is stopped but will fix it in the morning. The syntax is a bit off, its missing the leverage and stack %. To add stop loss use -sl 10010. And thanks for using the bot. 
A true fomoer won't sell until badly under water, and in panic
i fomoed in at 9390.. 
I'm personally letting it ride for a while!!
I fomoed at the BGD at 7002 and close entirely at 7500. Little did I know... Let your winner ride and move your stops
How about half and half.  I've been scalping my way up too.

Edit: or set a SL in profit for a portion.  Or do a trailing stop.
9560 stop, sit back
I'd cut profits and wait for pull back but that's just me. 
Maybe I should go ahead and nudge that leverage slider up....

Haha good work, though, man.

I'm super impressed by how well it's held up so far. Some beautiful bullish consolidation. Certainly wasn't expecting to stay here so long.
Binance broke through

Edit: Above 7800
So are you long
$34 million dollars in three months.  You do realize that is next to nothing, don't you?   Bearish news.
I'm a lurker here, but this bothers me enough to post.

I think people who point to this chart tend to discount the effect of 2017. Almost everyone in the US now knows what Bitcoin is. Unfortunately (depending on who you ask), almost every the normie equates "bitcoin" with "investment". Because of this broad categorization, I don't think the price hitting an ATH will have much of an effect on the trend chart, at least not to the magnitude that it did last year.

As someone who has been in this space for several years, I'm disturbed by the level of ignorance about Bitcoin by those who "own" (quotes b/c coinbase) bitcoins.

IMO this chart will only change significantly if/when people start using bitcoin rather than speculating on it. Sure, another huge bull run will bring the searches up, but not like last year.

In summary, I don't think it's productive for the bears of this sub to keep pointing to this chart and calling for $3k BTC. Same goes for the "omg it's just like 2014" posts. The reality, as is often the case, is much more nuanced.
It hasn't been the last several times the price has crossed $10k ~~this spring~~ since the bottom in Feb 2018.
10k will bring more in... it might even light a casket of gunpowder on fire.  In fact I know many people making their first buys right now b/c they missed '17 on the side lines.  Demographics are varied, which means a lot for potential adoption.  These are ALL people I've been telling about bitcoin since 2011-13 time frame.  They've known about it, but last year changed something for them for the first time.  Throw in some GS news and various other reputable consideration and you have the 'normie' feeling rather comfortable with this scary strange shit.
Yes there is greater than a 0.0% chance of that happening.
Breaking 10k feels more like a friday thing.
highly unlikely, the buy support will disappear above $9700, so we'll need to spend a day or two at this range consolidating before making the push up
This isn't the moment of truth. The market is overextended and due for a pull back. Moment of truth will be once this settles down and has the ability to recharge. Will we muscle up and burst through 9.8 or will buyer's get cold feet. 
Alts historically have a very low number of shorts. People just aren't interested in shorting them.
USD is limitless compared to cryptos. Easier to long.
very much so.... nobody is selling this 
I would expect so yes 
Not because of Goldman money, just dummies who are putting money in like December hoping for a huge pump with CBOE and CME futures.
Right when I decided to buy back in, it crashed and I freaked out and sold. Quick way to lose $1k on the day lol. They def got me. 
/u/DamonAndTheSea posted this chart blow 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/nBZRsMiX/

He’s been relatively accurate today, and by the looks of it this chart is playing out as we speak. 

Buys set from $9,550-$9,450, patience will be rewarded 
take profit target?
balls
That's $1mm position size with leverage or is it just the collateral of a bigger position?
The last value is the stack %, did you mean 5%? If so should be 0.05. Will probably change the syntax to make it easier. Will add your position manualy since the bot failed to catch the edit. 
If you are using 10x leverage... and it goes against you by 3% ... won't you lose 30% in the trade? I always read how you only gain/lose  3-5% in a trade, but if you are using leverage then I would think those would rather be 30-50% in a trade (which is what I gain/lose when I use 10x leverage)
you got 5 hours before you can collect lol
by then bitcoin with be at 18k


Imagine, there are people who play HayDay or other farming games as much as we do this shit.  They probably lose more money too ;)
Been following your TA/updates consistently. Really appreciate the input and work you put into it all. Great stuff
Maybe this is the 2018 crash, which everyone will compare the 2022 crash to
oh man that would suck
Maybe we are making history instead of repeating history this time
and maybe this one will be the 3rd example for a post on /r/bitcoinmarkets in a couple years
I have a hard time believing we hit an ATH or even test it in the summer months of northern hemisphere. I’m imagining something closer to summer 2016 ( sideways and get weekly bands super super tight for new/test ATH in the late fall)
Closewd mine too. I was literally in the red the second my order hit and never got green
What timeframe though?
I'm still bearish because the last time the [weekly sma](https://i.imgur.com/czlugrT.png) dipped like this it went down [a lot more](https://i.imgur.com/9b2FGXb.png).
The only thing I’m worried about is altcoins pumping. It deff takes credibility from crypto as a whole, I mean golem (a project that has been around for more than a year and has yet to produce a single thing) is up 50% for the day. Iota is back over 2usd. I just get this really uneasy feeling that we are still in a bubble, and BTC is not going to save us from the fall.
External indicators (google trends, app download ranks) all still declining from the winter peak, overall volume low... Can't say for sure but feels more like a bull trap than a recovery to me.
If we can just consolidate over 9420, I'll be pretty happy.
That's exactly my targets as well. I expect a minor pullback at 9.7k then if it breaks I don't think 10k will hold very long and the FOMO will bring us to 10.6 which is the  .786 fib of the retrace you mentioned.
11k is a possible then
No it definitely wouldn't be a bad idea but expect a possible rejection @10k and also a likely double top still able to play out. A short seems to be the better r/r though with stops above 10k.

Currently we have not broken out convincingly. A wick doesn't count.
Yes. Don't.
Definitely maybe.
Add on pullbacks, not at the top. Unless it's retardedly obvious that it's breaking $10k 
Given its already for sale onnthe darknet from the equifax hack I think you'll live. 
I WA T3 months ago  - since then upgraded to T4.

Kraken is reputed, registered. You will not find any larger broker that does not implement KMS, which means they have to know you.
just because he cofounded a popular Message Bord doesnt mean he understands anything about markets. he Probl. just owns Lotta eth and wants to shill his Bags, like everyone does. but a scammer? no thats exagerating...
Not much more than one std dev given the volatility. Do the maths.
So entirely possible.
Didnt he sell Reddit for $10M, just for it to then be worth $1.8B?
[removed]
Lol right after I comment (before you) I see this. Could write an article on this subject but its 2am and I need to keep working. Thank you for inspiring me to get off Reddit for at least a few hours. 
15k sounds like hopium, but 5k for ETH doesn't seem so farfetched if you look at the 3D chart. Seems ready for another huge run IMO.

20k for BTC would not surprise me, although I expect heavy resistance at key levels such as 11.7k and ~14.5k.
What do people here think about a 'flippening?' Is it likely, what would Eth have to accomplish to surpass Btc market cap? It nearly did so last summer of course but then pulled back...
I'm heading to bed holding btc for the first time this week. Grinded up .5 btc in the past week and don't want to lose my position in btc. Not setting a stop loss either cause gdax has had spotty liquidity and I'm afraid of a flash crash lol. 
This kind of stuff is more useful than you realize, thanks for sharing and being introspective.


I do wish sometimes complete noobs here would tell us more often when they're itching to buy and sell. 
Check out that logic though, you regret buying a top, so you are waiting for a higher top.

Though I didn't buy (actually buy, not long) the first time we went to 6k but I sure as hell did after second then time when it started going back up.  I guess the logic is similar to yours, but you're upside down.

Don't feel too bad, the mistaken buy-high version for me is when I moved 75% of holding stack into fiat at 9k in between the 11.7k double tops and ate shit big time on that when it went back up and I bought back in, only for us to have much better prices soon later.  So the same spot got me too just like it got you.  I hedge via margin now.
Not mine, after that insane red candle the past hour. Insane.
all of /r/buttcoin has been waiting for years for the opposite to happen. I wonder if they'll ever get what they want 
it wouldnt shock me if gs juiced the market to try to generate interest in their trading desk.  Breakout here means 10k is assured. 10k is headlines for the public


Oh, don't worry. Need to entice a few of them to go short first. Then... boom. Bear traps are fun!
That's just a run of the mill bull flag, man.
Flags are characterized by the high volume on the pole (the strong push upwards in a short amount of time), and proceeding low volume consolidation... in other words nobody taking profit because they expect continuation. The actual flag can manifest as a pennant, ascending triangle, a small downward channel, or even just sideways. 

The only thing that would invalidate it is high volume selling that retraces more than half of the pole. 
no
Buy a fuckton of BTC with fiat, short the corn 1x, free 0.178%
More HOLDing, less selling? Lower supply, higher demand. Also OTC market is booming, that's where institutional investors make purchase not directly off the exchanges. All contributing to a low volume but positive price action.
That volume isn’t the only factor in price action? 
People who got in low enough aren't bothering to trade, which equates to a lack of supply. This explains both the low volume and the ability for the price to rise on low volume.
That price can creep up on low volume.. and then once seminal price targets are hit, the media cycle will bring in the 'new money' needed to pump to higher levels
It tells us a rejection from here could result in a textbook double top. With all the exuberance abound lately I wouldn't be surprised


It tells us that this market is very easy to manipulate, even if you don't have absurdly deep pockets.
think about the timeframe and goal of the trade before you enter. Set stop losses.
i.e. 
 
1. I will short here at X because 'technical reason'. 
2. My stop loss is at Z because I want to take that much risk
3. My target is Y and price should reach that in about T time because 'technical reason'
4. I am wrong when A, B, C happens and then I will exit the trade prematurely. > 

Write this down everytime you make a trade and follow through with the trade.
like chewy said, shorts are not very rewarding compared to long atm. The mindset has changed from short the pump to long the dips. The trend is your friend!
Great entry, but you just got too scared there and covered too early.  Although would have been fine if you reshorted at $9700.   

I shorted at $9755 average and a am fine with covering at $9800 or a little above if it took me that long to unwind the position.  This just looks too much like a double top being painted, so I'm hanging on until we either get a big drop or I cover for a relatively small loss.

And of course always the risk of the price spiking $300 in seconds, but still odds are in my favor with this one, however it works out.


So you lost money on fees? 
Nice!

Dancing with closing above the previous high of 9767.
Good plan. Just a vernacular point...that's a bull pennant, not a bull flag. Flags should be channel-esque, pennants are wedge-esque. 

I'm still holding my 9115 long hoping we pop through resistance today. 
solid plan
Wait, you’re saying you like slow and steady growth over parabolic pumps?! Madness! 

I remember the feeling of panic I had when bitcoin shot from, I think it was 17k to 20k, in about a hour and a half time span (probably remembering that wrong but that’s what it felt like). I should of had this elated feeling but all I felt was anxiety because of how unnatural it felt lol I’m really enjoying this slow and steady rise up. I’m sure we’ll go parabolic soon but until then, niiiiiceeee and easy bitcoin, niiiiiice and easy. 
If it breaks 9800 I think alts will dump to BTC for the ride.
I remember you posting this and thinking 

“ He’s crazy to long here “ 

Now, I wish I was you. Congrats.

 *Now,  how much for a haircut*
The sin bin sounds like a happy place.  You advertise it so well!
With all due respect (foserious), in today's market I think a little bit more leeway on discussion of btc-alt dynamic is warranted. There is definitely an interplay  where one affters another. Specific alts prob best be discussed in alt daily but if it touches on BTC I think you can let it slide. 
I think this is actually a decent short, but I would probably set closer stops (9425). If we break 9400, I don't see much reason we don't hit your stop. Still, you may get to manually close under 9400 even if we pop to 9430ish, so there's definitely merit. 
I just opened a short as well 

@ 9,348 

Rejected off $9,350, but not as strongly rejected as I would have liked 

Edit: Closed at break even 
Pretty solid entry, just keep an eye on the potential of painting a bull flag for another go at the top. 
Short 0.5x @9432 on September Futures

This is still a bubble
Bad idea bro. We're defending 9350 fervently for indicators to cool down before another leg up. I'm looking for 3 pushes at least
Most people don’t admit that they’re wrong

Congrats, one of the key aspects to becoming a good trader 
9360ish is a decent target, as it should be former resistance and now (hopefully) support. If it falls, this could just be a big fakeout, though. 
What if I told you... there is no pullback
I'm looking for $9900. The closer we are to large round numbers the closer the logic gets to: "gotta buy before it hits 10k"
Idk? You're the one feeling it?
Kanye vs Kobayashi
BearDAX the mentally challenged dachshund keeps trying to run the wrong way though 
just get your mom to make more tendies lol
Two things you HAVE to do in a badger market: Hold onto your btc and HOLD ONTO YOUR TENDIES
I think we'll get past 9.7.  It's 10k that concerns me
Mhmm... or its just a horizontal line drawn from the previous high lol
What does it all *mean* Basil?
I didn't even notice that at first (lazy), but was drawn the same on my tradingview chart and that, combined with double top, definitely makes me feel better about the wisdom of my short up there.
$9950 maybe. 

I remember sitting and watch BTC break $10,000 for the first time and was a glorious moment.  Obviously will be more a feeling of relief than exhilaration, this time around...IF it happens.
I’ll be making a partial entry at 9550 should we retrace that much tonight. I am currently all cash right now, and I want to at least have a small position in case we pump while I’m asleep. If we instead dump, then I still have plenty of cash in reserve to buy cheaper coins. Anyway, that’s my strategy. 
Wait a little to see whether that's a double top or just a stop hunt before the uptrend resumes. That's unclear for now.

I'm gonna put some bids here... gdax already tapped it and mex went all the way to the one below there but finex has yet to make it down there. 
Extreme DCA. Remember that regardless of the number of contracts, fees are a percentage. So a negligible contract size carries a negligible fee.

It's possible somebody is running this bot to muck with the server. Also possible they're testing the bit out with tiny contracts (better served with test net, but to each their own). Finally, it's entirely possible they're building a position. If you can't decide on an entry, have a bit do one contract per timestep until your position is built.

Very nice call!
Right!!
nice to see another long.  just broke 9350 looks like 9400 is next and 9500 shouldnt be far off.

wtf is up with all the shorts around here? just getting wrecked.

people desperate to scalp a point here and there when the momentum is clearly going up lol.  patience is a virtue.
Already heard that several months ago. And saw them again after that as well.
Looking at btc dominance  on cmc, taking dates when btc dominance is achieving a new low and looking at how btc acted after the dominance low, btc almost always drops. Am i missing something?
I want this to be true.
how does them trading an alt for BTC provide a boost to BTC?  Doesn't that only affect the alt's alt:btc price negatively?
$14k
It's more of a Big Green Butt Plug at the moment than a Big Green Dildo.
Tomorrow's gonna be fun.
What are you talking about, the dump hasn't even started yet.
It is known 
Aaaaaand time to short
what they said in December/January :)
Not with that attitude.
That's where I set mine as well, roughly. 
Chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/5gRA2Nr0/

If that upward channel becomes support, 9425 hopefully will hold as support. I've set mine just under 9400, and since I'm on futures, I have the premium working for me as well. It would be hard to see that much profit go, but I held this sucker to -20% ROE so I'm not about to let it get stopped out early. 
yes
Set up a stop @ 9500 and keep rolling my dude
id just hold it and set a stop. maybe take a little profit, then maybe add on the pullback
Take some profit now and maybe some trailing stops for the rest
I am short here, so you know my answer.  You can always close it and reopen at $9800 if you want.
In your opinion, do you see this breaking up or down? I remember you posted that chart earlier this week and it has played out nicely thus far.

e: spelling mistake
The top left corner of your wedge doesn't seem like it has anything on it
Agree with your conclusion on waiting for a breakout/breakdown, but as we've seen with the recent hidden bear div on the daily (who's high ended up just being chop in a possibly continuing uptrend) it's important to wait for true confirmation of a local high/low before trading the divergence.

Right now it looks like we're just consolidating right below/at a horizontal FIB resistance we were previously rejected from while RSI cools off. Could break up or down, but I'd be waiting for a true break of either before making any trades. Obviously bull flags have a bullish bias but plenty break down as well. Something else to consider for the bull case is how this approach actually seems relatively more stable - last time we got to it off a short term parabolic advance and had a mini blow off top. This time we had a triangle breakout up to it and are now consolidating.

9.7k also marks a high volume VPVR node for confluence as to it being an important resistance level.
The right time to enter a long in a bull trend is when the stoch rsi is sub 20 on the 3-6h, not now.
Could you clarify the bear div you're talking about?

I'm not seeing any bear div on 2hr chart:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/5rH7MYsh/

Well its been said the volume hasn't been high enough since 6.5k sooooo who knows
I keep seeing this shit about volume, but volume it's very relative. Volume decreasing can mean trend exhaustion, particularly in corrections, but lack of selling with buyers slowly pushing the price up its not exactly a bad market situation .
Futures or swaps? I'm long futures from 9115 and at this stage I'm setting 9240 stops and not bothering with 4-digit targets. If we are continuing the uptrend, swaps funding will be cost prohibitive, and I'd look to try to switch on a dip. 
I've got a long at about $9150 in the September Futures that I'm slowly exiting (small sell orders every $300 upwards). I completely cash out at at $10600. So that's my target, I guess. 
C'mon man, this drop is nothing and is holding strong! ^^^^so ^^^^far

There isn't even a double top until like $8.6k anyway 
Bitcoin ticker widget
Ripple is fucked.
They [Ripple Labs] are trying to claim that XRP exists completely independently of them and will "live on" after Ripple Labs is long gone.. but that doesn't make any sense.  XRP is useless if Ripple Labs isn't implementing its back-end systems into banking institutions.  That means that XRP is a fucking security.  End of story.

Eth on the otherhand, can and will exist without the Ethereum Foundation.  
If they decide ETH was a security,  then that ICO and every ICO from the ETH platform would have raised money illegally.  Not only would they have to deal with prosecuting everyone but they would have to try and recoup every dollar raised in all the ICOs.  No way they consider ETH as a security.  I think they will require regulated exchanges and go after past, present and future fraudsters.  It will be curios to see if they create a whole new asset class or do a mix of existing with depending on the structure you are either under the SEC or CFTC.  

Whatever they decide on the 9th, the market is likely to react to the extreme one way or the other.  I'll be 100 percent in cash by Tuesday. 
I don't think ETH is at-risk at all simply because they're 100% in-bed with the TBTF banking cartel (i.e. JPM a cornerstore of the EEA) -- and in fact, if you put your tinfoil hat on, one might assume the market movement we've seen this week may be driven by some actors who know something we don't.

No comment on Ripple/XRP -- I truly know very little about it beyond the pump'n'dump tactics & centralization.
If I were holding eth and something this big came out, id probably sell first to fiat, then to btc if/when I felt it was safe.  

This is good for Bitcoin™

/s
Cause the mod bans everyone who mentions an alt and deletes the post
Fascinating. Would it impact all EC20 tokens too?
ETH will likely be fine. From what I've seen, there really don't seem to be any higher ups in the space that are worried about this, many of whom probably have had conversations with regulators.
Microsoft, IBM, Apache, and EFF will step in for Eth. Ripple is probably going to get torn apart, though. I've been trying to figure out a way to model the impact of alts on the overall market. /u/mandy7 helped me think through this, a lot.

Generally, there seems to be liquidity that's generated through alt trading, but it's not as straightforward as classifying them as a source of credit. I'm not sure how to classify it, but fractional reserve banking proved to be a very unreliable simile. Something is screwy there, but I'm not sure how to measure it. 

Classification of alts as securities will probably stabilize the overall market. Long-term, regulatory clarity and industry compliance with those regulations is good for Bitcoin, IMO.
Lol, you got reported by someone for rule 2 already.

See my discussion that relates Eth to Bitcoin. I did that minutes ago. This mod shit is subjective as hell, but I'm trying to prevent people from saying things like "my coin is pumping on the alt/BTC ratio." I can argue that this post still does that. Get it?
Is that an alt in your name!? banned!

"wish the price would cool off here for a few days"

Unbelievably annoying when people say this. Good luck on having Bitcoin hover in a $200 window for more than a day.
This is nothing like 11k a few months back, times have changed 

1) Made a higher low on our double bottom
2) Potential Adam and even formation
3) Weeks of consolidation sub 7k VS rejection off 5.8k followed by a $6,000 pump in a short period of time 
4) Alts were bleeding during our pump to 11k, they are now reaching ATH levels 
5) We have continuously made higher local lows, and have broken out of a symmetrical triangle formation with a target of 10k+ 
6) There hasn’t been any FUD, and nothing but good news coming out of crypto 
7) Bears have tried to drag us down to the abysses multiple times ( 8.2-7.8k to be rejected at 7.8k) ( 9700-8.6k ) (9700-8.8k ) (9500-8.9k) 
8) Potential Invs head and shoulders on 1D

People here will be calling maximum pain all the way down to zero. This can't keep going up with already 5th weekly green on the horizon, but sure seems unlikely that BTC will go sub 6k any time soon.
We've had organic sideways movement for almost two weeks now. The price is stable. Combine this with the fact that half this thread is gambling their life away on leverage and screaming doom at the first moment of a retrace, I'd say we're holding up very well. This thing is headed toward for 9.8\-10K range by tonight, possibly even \>10K by the weekend. I'd say, this is a good time to open a long for some quick scalps upwards.
A few of the alts are hitting ATHs..not a lot, but a few and that is very bullish for crypto, in general, of course.

Technically it connects off the ATH wick too: https://www.tradingview.com/x/99VtT0DK/

Now have 4 points of contact, including the one we're currently sitting on. 
Oh yeah they're on to you mate. 
I will possibly buy on GDAX and short swaps for the funding fees. It's just too much to pass up 
> funding on bitmex is a 0.3 x 3 daily (almost 300% APR lol) 



[Funding Rate in %](https://i.imgur.com/aEED7Bo_d.jpg?maxwidth=2000&shape=thumb&fidelity=high)  

Why? We already bounced to 11.7K twice. 
Everyone knows that BTC doesn't deserve to be anywhere near $15K.  If it makes it over $10K somehow, there's going to be more and mroe overhead resistance.
pros will be pros
I sold all my bags. Too many [contact points](https://www.tradingview.com/x/QpoQTpOr/)

Having said that, I certainly hope we get a decent retracement to around 9400's. Otherwise, we would be walking on thin ice


Tacos on this guy.
bravo. now go get a happy meal
I missed you.
When there are so many people in the world with so much money looking to buy something held by so few, most of whom aren't looking to sell and may in fact want more themselves, it's hard for price to just go down, down, down - even though that is what most people would like to see happen.

Without fundamental news (major infrastructure problem like an exchange hack or massive fraud, major regulatory change with respect to Bitcoin, some security related issue with the protocol, etc.) I think $3k Bitcoin is very unlikely.  The day to day price path over the next few weeks will not change my mind on that.  People who can't tell if this is bullish or bearish until it moves a further 5% one direction or the other with a volume profile they find convincing, are really missing the very obvious bigger picture.
It is, in undefined point in the future.
if it gets really replaced by another crypto which goes fully mainstream BTC could reach 500 USD again 
If we legitimately double-top 9800 here and dump back to sub $8500, I still think it's on the table. 
Any price, even $0 is a "possibility" going forward. The more interesting question is "is 3k likely in the near future?". Not very. 
$3K is probably out've the question at this point IMHO, but still certainly non-zero probability. 

As much as it pains me and everybody to say/think about it, $5K is still very much a realistic possibility this year, especially in light of constant geopolitical risk and a larger stock market correction.
Three attempts to get there since last October. Each one has been a higher low. 50/50 we see $6500 again this year. 10&#37; chance we see $3k this year. My opinions only of course.
I see two options -- ath within a few (<6) months, or touching 3k/lower. I don't think the first is gonna play out, so I'm hoping I'm not missing out waiting for the second one.
I doubt we will see that again. I doubt we will see $5k either, during Sep-Nov we will enter the same phase like last year.
Not so long ago it was under $1k!! Of course it is. Bitcoin is on a bull run since (by a quick look) September 2015, we can't expect this to be undone in 4 months... 
Maybe... i think 5k is likely until we pass 11.7, even then i would be ~~weary~~ wary. Not convinced  we are done  with the bear market so quickly. Last year was a pretty epic bubble and i think its unlikely we'll repeat the first bubble of 2013 and keep going up from here until we flatline then we'll get big money really looking to accumulate
Personally I do, though I do think it is becoming less and less likely as the market stabilizes.

I still do not think the bear market is done though.  We will probably see under $6k.  The bullishness is still too hot, still too much volatility.
You might be able to use tether? Eur -> tether -> USD?

I don't use Kraken though so no idea. 
> EURUSD is a complete mess

Can you explain what you mean with this? There is no fiat currency pair on Kraken.

> I really would like to trade BTCUSD

I always use BTCEUR on Kraken for my initial buying from fiat, it's completely fine for that. What specifically don't you like about it?

Then I transfer the BTC to another exchange (I use Bitfinex) for trading BTCUSD.

Couldn’t you just per say 

Ex: Buy 1000 Ripple with EUR, then sell the 1,000 ripple back to USD? 
buy some btc with euro then trade with USD. Bitstamp has a EUR/USD pair. 
> EURUSD is a complete mess a

EURUSD is currently 1.2; it was 1.1 in May 17. It was 1.25 in December 17.

I don't know this market conditions very well.

I both trade BTC/EUR (spot market) and BTC/USD (futures) for hedging purposes. If the EUR/USD can change 10% this is worth to take into account (serious bonus profit/loss + extra risk).

What are people their estimation of the EUR/USD pair? Taking into account macro-economic state of affairs, what is the reasonable EUR/USD ratio to expect (I have the slightest clue how much it historically shifts, and what it "should" be on average)

Yes, go to funding and you can select any of your loans and return them. Finex will automatically replace them with new loans at current interest rates
Yeah make sure you stay on top of this. Sometimes they’ll renew at outrageous rates so you need to return them to get the lower rates periodically. 
Even the stronger less volatile ones are going in too. CMC top 10's - older coins.
Better just wait for it to stabilize for now and hope it doesn't bounce back up before you can make a decision.   Potential to reenter at the same price!  Don't get chopped up in the meantime forcing reentry!
8200 on the short term.
I still have bart syndrome from all of the "textbook" flags that broke bizarro on us
Which book would that be? 
God damn beautiful entry there son 
Smart play. The price was rejected right as it passed 70 RSI on the 1H and is sitting there right now. It will be interesting to see if buyers have the oomf to push above.
hopefully this will delay the pump and I can rack up those funding fees. I can close at $9800 not at a loss :D 

I should've added at $9830ish for the inevitable pullback to make some quick coin tho -_- Damn. Always so hard to pull the trigger up high. 
Hopefully just some healthy profit taking and we’ll be back on our way soon!
Whats your target? Seems to be wanting to go down but i see 9100 as support 
Hmm, could be a good trade but I'm not seeing any signs of a reversal. Trend still seems to be up to the upper boundary of the triangle which is around your stop. 

Might've jumped the gun a bit here. 
and since spread btw binance & finex is small when price is calm, then tether has nothing to do with it imho. Plus as I understand Bitfinex uses tether not usd, but just calls it USD.
The price is at 9700, now you discover that you are long from 8900? That must be nice. 
$100 drop after $500 rise is hard rejection now?
what hard rejection? RSI just catching breath
previous high from 2 weeks ago
I for one am definitely bailing on this yolo long before funding lol
Currently at 0.3084%, now a bit of a noob 'question' here: am I right in thinking the dip would happen just before funding to avoid paying the fees?
When does funding period hit? 
So many twitter experts are calling for a new and larger ‘alt season’ but dominance is at 35% - almost the lowest it’s ever been. Do they expect it to go to 5% or something ? I just don’t see much potential for an alt market bull run without btc having at least one of the same magnitude. 

The alt bubble is the real bubble that all the banks and Soroses have been on about this whole time. It’s mostly useless, extremely overvalued crap with the word ‘blockchain’ attached to it. >90% of it will fail just like during the dot com mania. I’m surprised this hasn’t happened already after this year’s correction tbh. 
I don't see it as a particularly good thing personally. If it were eth I'd be a little less worried but random coins pumping like this makes it seem like a DCB for the alt space as a whole

Either that or alts are slowly decoupling 

Neither are particularly good for BTC 
I'm not too worried about it and I think it has to do with the fact that downwards pressure from short-selling bitcoin is much higher than on alts as such an option is limited or non-existent.

Moreover, the alts market are more illiquid relative to BTC, making price movements requiring less capital. This makes it enticing for more gains, and I think this is exacerbated by EOS' recent pump, with people looking for other alt-coins that might be "undervalued" and provide an opportunity for quick returns. 

Whether this will have an effect on BTC I'm not sure, but there seems to be more decoupling of price movements going on in the crypto environment, which in itself is not necessarily a bad thing.
> Is anyone worried that alts are approaching their aths?

ETH is barely 50% of its ATH on the ratio.  What are you on about?
I dont know anymore. Ever since 2013 people have been chasing "the next bitcoin". I never imagined this much money pouring into mostly still useless copy-pasted code. Am I worried? Im just mildly annoyed at how rich I could have been... but I still dont believe in alts.

edit: So like Buffet says, don't invest in what you dont understand.
Huge correction incoming
It does worry me too. From what I read here and there, people seem to believe that this year will be the year of alts and BTC will lose quite a bit of its market share.
What's more worrying to me is that 90% of the coins out there have very weak fundamentals or even have none, which would lead to a gigantic bubble that'd hurt the market for a while when it burts. I personally don't think we're done with out correction yet, we're still in an obvious downtrend until proven otherwise, this is wishful thinking but I'd hope that some of these garbage alts disappeared in case the downtrend continues. But yeah, most of them tripled or so in the last few weeks. 
Not worried at all, actually!

But yes, there most likely will be a correction.
I don't see why it would have to hurt BTC. Alts can rise on their own and they can fall on their own. I, personally, would sell the alts for USDT or BTC if they began to crash so I think most other people would too. People in the space are trying to get more USDT or BTC or both. No one gives a shit about shitcoins.
Every reply on this seems to be "gut feeling". I just sold all my bags
They follow BTC
Does Bitcoin need to lead for crypto to thrive?

Alts are the new zeitgeist. Don't be surprised for coins like EOS, XLM, ICX, and ETH to continuously hit ATH's this year.

From the conferences I've attended the past few weeks, I can tell you the love for EOS is real. Panelist after panelist elaborated on why they loved using the platform as much as they did. Frankly, I was amazed they didn't all think it was a scam. I've since re-evaluated my position.

Platforms are what receive the attention and top investment interest. To them, Bitcoin is an important part of the ecosystem that lacks the ROI potential of the smaller caps. Like it or leave it--big money knows what it wants. 
If modern medicine doesn't let me down that means I'll see 1mil BTC at the end of my life. 

I'll take it!

Are you looking at the same chart I'm looking at?

balls of steel

I would get delivery 
I guess if you’re going to short, between 9550-9750 would be the time to do it. 

Good luck mate, but it seems like we won’t be knocking on $9750’s door this time, we are just going to walk right in.. 
target 8600-8400..? lol what?
SL:9850 is not the SL to set. 10k is honestly and I think you shouldn't short 9.6k given that we skipped that range entirely on the last run up to 9.8k. There is also no resistance left except a possible double top @9.8k.

Overall I would r/r while not bad isn't great here either. I hope your scaling in.
I wouldn't say that's a "mild" retrace.

That would be giving up 100% of the gains we've seen today.
too soon, brotha, too soon.

I personally think the lowest we'll see is $9400.  Consider putting stops above $9750 in case we break it in the coming hours
I'm really not a fan of telling people what they should do when it comes to trading, but I highly recommend rethinking this position. 
I don't think we'll see significant retrace after such a slow, steady push
Not to mention the price action and quick spike to double top land.  Price is holding up pretty well near $9700 though.  It is risk/reward calculation, as always, but I'm still short here.
By that logic you'd be shorting all the up in Oct, Nov, Dec and getting rekt all the time. Premiums have been much higher than $150 and the markets have not pulled back. Additionally, the premiums reflects market sentiment (and projected funding trends on swap), so if the market is ready to bull, you'd expect premiums to rise and stay that way for the duration of the run.
where do we have 150 USD premium?
I don’t know, I somehow think accumulation of big whales was before the big short squeeze. I think pushing price down again sub 8k (and 7.5k in particular) might do more harm than good in scaring away retail money from investing in the space, money needed to fuel the bull run. 

Guess we’ll see though.

You also a Dutchie?
I think you could be right that larger players would like to spend more time accumulating, but I think if we went below $8.6k the market would drop out and cause more longer-term damage.

The pattern we are seeing is steady price rises and then $200 dumps, followed by more steady gains. This does seem like the behaviour of something that wants to hold the price without killing it.
7600-7400 could happen but i don't think it can go lover than that. 6500 was too resilient and ended up with a short squeeze. Still upside potential is way bigger, you can just buy and hold.
Been going all ALL day
what could it mean? care to explain? are they suppressing prices or propping?
I have a decent amount of respect for Charlie, but a tweet like that takes it down a notch. These kinds of predictions don't tend to age well.
I wouldn't call crypto investing , it's pure speculation 
Just filled another limit sell for a portion of my stack at 9750. I have the rest in a Limit sell at 9945 in case it pumps, but I can't see us getting past 10000 psychological tonight with the RSI so overbought. 

Then again, I've got a Stop buy in place at 10100 if things go haywire.
Interesting you would close a long on the $9800 break, but makes sense, being close to $10K.
> I simply don't believe any new money coming back into crypto will immediately invest in insert shitcoin XYZ here. 

Correct, although it won't stay in BTC long, not with random strangers who I didn't know were in crypto post on their news feed 'EOS and AE have been good to me this week'

(Which a week later dropped off significantly).
I think a lot of people have been sitting on their hands, judging by the super low volume last couple of days. It's starting to go up again though.
Sometimes a good advice is to enter with half or a third of your stack now: if it rises, good, if it dumps, also good since you can buy some more cheap btc with the rest of your stack. 
Catch a knife and set a tight stop, so you're in... but minimal losses if things turn. Looks like the opportunity may be coming after rejecting off 9280 6 times on the hourly. 
honestly I still think we are not out of the fake out zone here. confimred break out above 9.45 or so...
some real selling on BFX too.
Earlier today when it was at ~9150 I was like "figure out how to leverage long here you idiot" and then I didn't and now I'm sad. :(
What the heck did you just say about me, you little honey bun? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Cutie Patooties, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret tweets on Daddy Trump, and I have over 300 confirmed snookims. I am trained in butter biscuits and I’m the top sweetie in the entire US sugar doodles. You are nothing to me but just another Daddy. I will cuddle you the heck out with warmth the likes of which has never been felt before on this Earth, mark my words. You think you can get away with saying that dookie doo to me over the Internet? Think again, cutie. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of Mommies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the huggie wuggies, deary. The huggies that wipes out the silly little thing you call your meanie doodles. You’re in trouble, Daddy. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can tweet you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in butter boops, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Cutie Wooties Fruity Tooties and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your widdle face, you little cutie pie. If only you could have known what huggie wuggies your little “tweetie weetie” was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your mouthy wouthy. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, honey buns. I will wiggle woop all over you and you will drown in it. You’re really sweet, honey.
On the plus side, when it **stops shitting the bed** you know the market has likely reached a local top and it might be a good opportunity to scalp a short. 
If $9,800 is broken to the upside, it's likely to serve as pretty strong support in the medium term — provided the market confirms it as such and continues higher. 

If you enter a long now, you are taking on all the risk of a double-top scenario, but your reward for entering now vs at $9,850 is just 2% in gains. 

If you have the option, it's always safer to enter following confirmation of a breakout. Not in anticipation of one. 

So just be patient and wait to see what happens. You'll likely get a better entry in the short term. At worst you'll have a moderately worse entry, but one that's "safer" than one entered now.
I always try to remind myself that CORRECTIONS come, even though it may feel like it's gonna keep on going up forever if you look at the charts all day. This is time for selling bags, not going long:

[tradingview](https://www.tradingview.com/x/QpoQTpOr/)
At least you didn't close it in a loss (I hope)
RSI can never actually hit 100, just converge to it, right?

Edit: Looks like mathematically it could not be zero nor 100, there's no way to get the [right hand side of the equation](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:relative_strength_index_rsi) to equal zero or a hundred.
I'm thinking so.
Yes, it's over.
The longer we linger at this level with the RSI this extended, the harder the fall will be. 
There has been a Bull flag for like 2 hours
Choo choo 🚂🛤️, all aboard the fomo train! 
I was going to write the same, bull flag broke UP and fomo is kicking in
Bear divergence would result *from* the sell off, not be the driver. Until we started selling we hadn't made a local high on the daily.

I'd very much argue we still haven't, there's basically 24 hours left on the daily. Lot of time for things to happen.

Divergence is becoming a meme. People need to go read the babypips stuff about it.
[deleted]
You seem to be so conflicted every time BTC pumps!
When we went to 11.7k the first time there had been no real attempt to push the price down beyond the 6k level since it bounced up so abruptly. The market spent alot more time Dilly dallying this time at 6.5 testing the buy support, which ended up being quite impressive.

I'd say that's the biggest factor that makes me consider this push up far more legitimate.
Most alts get traded directly for Bitcoin on the ratio.... so no effect on USD price. Yes there could be some profit taking but I think most of the market realizes that 10.3k and 11.7k will come in very short order if we move past this level so they may be holding on for now, should they decide to sell I think the market makers will gladly scoop up any and all "cheap" corns and keep on pushing. 

There is some profit taking going on now though that we've reached the local high. So I guess it will just be a matter of where we place our low as far as the probability of pushing through this level. 

I do agree though, this was all too easy and I don't think we're moving right on into another 2017 bull market, there is far too much euphoria going around already. This will probably be looked back upon as "The Bull Trap" and make it into the low teens if its lucky. 
The death stare I'm giving this chart right now: https://www.tradingview.com/x/a4NTizFz/
>A&E double bottom? Doesn’t that sound like a too perfect story?

No, they became named patterns for a reason.

>but I just think the bear market is far from over

Maybe stop dismissing facts that don't suit that view? I've seen very .....few people(maybe none, even bears) arguing the correction was only 34%. 
You know I was just thinking this. People dumping alts into btc. The question is will they now dump the btc?  The counter argument to bitcoin dumping is that money on the sidelines sees this move and fomos in. As usual, this could go either way!
Weird to hear that from you. I remember you being incredibly bullish but it's nice to see you being quiet the rational being. I agree with a lot you say but crypto is based on one thing: Greed. Nobody cares (or only a few) about the underlying asset and why it is revolutionary, they are all here for the money. That's why shitcoins without mainnet are able to pump. That's why garlicoin and dogecoin are being bought.
"34%, hardly anything to cry about" Bitcoin has warped your mind. I do get what you're saying based on previous movements but things really do feel different this time (tm...). Crypto has gone mainstream, at least conversationally at this point, and there is no major bad news as there always in the past. The bad news right now is that the price is down...
Why did we go absolutely parabolic last year? Fundamentals aren't there. The real world use isn't there (in a everyday practical, global sense). It's a speculative asset that people are betting on its future.

No one really gives a shit about it making sense. It's a bubble. And bubbles can last a lot longer then most folks believe. 
IMO, demand for BTC is about where it was in November. The big difference is that we're starting to see tooling that integrates Bitcoin, specifically, into established financial markets. So, same demand among normal people and enhanced demand from people with elevated socioeconomic status. Big block sales are removing supply and doing it off the books.
"But why would we?"

Because it doesn't take all that much for bitcoin to just keep going up in perpetuity, once people stop dumping out of fear and panic. You don't need sustained buying to prop the price up, it stays up in the absence of selling.

The first sorty to 6k was extremely hard and rapid. The second visit to the sixes was slow and it was clear that nobody was left who was willing to sell at that price. After hitting 6k we shot up dramatically, but too fast. This time we are going up at a sustainable pace, and the relatively low volume shows that there are many people who got in low enough to hodl comfortably. The last trade I made was when we ran out of sell pressure and made a U-turn at 8650.
Sure, we may go down again from here, but it'll be a higher low, preceding a higher high. Chances of revisiting the 6k range is less than 20% imo.
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
if you’re daytrading, it all comes down to

funding vs premium

If you short a future in backwardation, a pump could bring the future to a premium and you’re kaput. If you short a future at a premium, a dump could bring it back to backwardation and you won double-ish. In December March futures were trading at 24k+

So, if there’s a premium, usually safer to short futs if funding acts against you. If funding is in your favor, short swaps

Also liquidity on futs os trash, so don’t market sell anything over 20-30k
Its the same thing. Futures just have an expiry date which you should exit the position before and no funding fees. Liquidity is also doo doo on the futs so if you have a large stack you will spend more time DCAing in and out of your position or deal with slippage. 
What are you talking about. Alts will pump again once BTC stabilizes. Alts have been pumping for the last three weeks. While BTC has gone up roughly 10-15% over the past few weeks my alts have gone up over 40%. Alts dump every time BTC looks like it's going on a run, which is exactly what's happening here.
Watching the same, basically i can only long on Kraken to take advantage of that. If i short and it goes back to +20$ i lose almost 1% there...
You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.

How the fuck is 50x leverage any sort-of 'hedge'?
That's literally a gamble dude.  And you'll probably get liquidated before you end up covering.
Much too narrow. You'd do better to go 10x short with 10% of your holding if you want to hedge. Liquidation would be over 10200, which is really where the party is confirmed, at least midterm. 
hedging is never a bad idea if your goal is to maintain capital. but a 50x hedge isn't really a thing, more of a trade imo 
Get out of this position.
Not a bad move but could be similar to hedging at 7.9k.... fun could just be getting started
I'm sorry I think you're getting REKT, this is the pump to 10k
If you want to be a scalper yes it sounds decent. I personally prefer long term positions with lower leverage. Remember to have a goal on this short and stick with it. Don't get greedy, 9350 might prove to be good support and you should lock in profit at some point. But that's just, like, my opinion, man.
Whats your target for your short?

Hedging isn't a bad idea if you're unsure. You're not losing any money, if things keep going up you'll miss out on some profit. It's managing your risk based on how you see the market. I'm only seeing a good trading manoeuvre. 

Edit: thought it was 5x, 50x is too high for a hedge as sloppy stated.
That's a perfectly legitimate strategy if you expect a big move, but you're unsure of the direction. Whether you use 5x with tight stops or 50x with liquidation as your stop has essentially the same effect.

Oh, and ignore all the hysterical noobs here who don't understand how any of this works.
> owever, after the rise today I don't really have a ton of faith in maintaining its price in the short term. So I went short with 1.5% of my holdings at 50x leverage @ 9440

Hedging is a very common strategy to preserve value of an asset that is falling in the short term. However, the suggested trade among the big traders - if you want to hedge your entire holdings - is 10x hedge on 9.09% of your holdings
There's a lot of random theories but the truth is it just happens sometimes randomly when alts pump or just for no reason at all. 

Finex got all the way to $12.2k when Gdax was at $11.5k before the fall to $6k the first time. 

Everyone freaked out thinking it was cause tether was insolvent but nothing ever came out of it 

Before December (around when futures began) finex and Gdax were regularly 1-3% apart and during dumps they'd split up to 10-15% spreads sometimes
0.9% is not a massive difference. Plus not enough liquidity in Gdax to exploit arb
Trust gdax. They spend actual unleveraged fiat to buy crypto so when they go bearish or bullish it's a much better indicator than random dildo wick finex.
Seems like a high risk situation all around. I think you did the right thing. Sure, the air is thin here, but Bitcoin can surge 10% for no-reason-at-all around psychological numbers and the order books are showing support for this price range.

https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/books/USD
You know a thread is full kids when a mention of short is downvoted to -4
It can't go vertical indefinitely. I'm shocked the price hasn't retraced more yet. That it's holding **above** 9,7 on bitfinex is unbelievable. 
If is a very strong high from some days ago. If we break this, the way to 12500 and higher is free.

9K is the new 1K. 
Yeah the market is going so well that I'm getting suspicious. Idk what to do with this feeling.
We broke market cap ATH while BTC is at <50% ATH? Wow 
That 442 is Global INCLUDING BTC.
Percent dominance BTC is down in last month.
So basically MOON or DOOM...?

Love it. :)
Theres over 6,000 BTC in the fund...what exactly are you looking at?
Yeah, same position as you. Stupid Magic Poop cannon told me not to get in at 6700. Ugh Stopped reading tradingview opinions.
Last time when btc did a double top at 11.750 a double bottom at 6K followed, we will see a tripple bottom for sure. (volume is also lower compared to the previous bounces )
Even though I don't know if this will break down or not, by seeing the fight to keep going up I just realised why "Bulls" are called like this... it's because of the red colour of the candles... I know I'm a bit slow in the head but I'm going to drink to that.
Btc going to 3k...kuwait dinars!!!! It's 2898 right now 🤣🤣🤣


And when BTC goes up the bulls appear talking about lambo's / moonshots / prices from 20 to 50K , whats the difference ?   -nobody- has a clue about the BTC price in 3 months, it could be 15K or 3K.  In my opinion 3K is more likely than 15K.
Lol, it can still go sub 3k. 
No one said it was going sub 3k.  Unless the same geniuses who said it was going back over 9k.  People said it was likely to go below 3k and they necessarily weren't wrong at the time.
[removed]
Your chart is just looping back. It's the same date range on right and left.
Yea wtf is going on with that chart lol. Look at the dates. Seems like you just copy pasted or something.
Lol fake news. I didn't know January came after April. 
Wow

Edit - wait a minute, April to January?
Way too similar lol 

Edit: That’s not photoshop is it? 
lollercopter 
That is... almost robotic in similarity.  Makes you wonder.
Is this real?
I was like "omg", then "wait a minute, when did this happen", and then "aha". If was a funny experience.
There aren't enough pixels for this to be a "5 min" if you're taking it out 5ish months like this!

Smart people don’t panic buy 
Yeah right..
I think your right, but I hope your wrong
Anyone got the latest Avengers movie?
Im out of the loop, hows that relevant?
for freeeeeee?
wow where do you see this?
If you wanna talk long shorts, the longs have only just now reached the level they were at around April 28th (using BTCUSDLONG chart) when BTC was at 9.25k (and they subsequently started to close in droves, reopening when we got back into 9k recently). Number of shorts has been relatively stable since April 23rd. Long:Short ratio is in favor of longs atm but not crazily so.
[deleted]
I dont believe there was nearly enough shorts to squeeze 

Also if it was a short squeeze, we would have seen something similar from the BGD from 6.8k to 8k 
Probably the alts pulling BTC up.
Kind of agree, but for now I believe we are on the path to 10k and beyond. That panic selling BS will return later in the year. 
Seems a pretty bearish sentiment. What’s your reason behind it?
Can you give us some insight on why you believe it will be sub $6,000 ? 

Otherwise, this is just your typical below average: 

   **shitpost**
its possible.  nobody wants to think about that right after a pump but we could still be seeing [this](https://i.imgur.com/9b2FGXb.png) in the next few months, even if we hit 11k in the short term.  I'm long and hedged in alts for now but its important to remember that these alt runs don't last very long and you should always be prepared for the worst case scenerio.  You can see the mania here every time we get a 100/200$ pump and its highly irrational.  Market bubbles don't just start again right after they crash.
If you beleive the price will go down, then you are, by definition, a bear.
> I'm not a bear

are you a mammal? bipede?
Your new log downtrend line only has two touches, so yeah it has much less significance compared to the blue line, though it is significant as the upper boundary of the pennant we're inside. 

If we don't violate your red line and break up I think we'll be looking good for a nice gradual uptrend over summer. 
That's basically the long and short of it.


^^no ^^pun ^^intended
Idk didn't seem manipulated to me, profit takers gonna profit take. It was a measly $200 red candle. We went up like 6% today a 2% retrace is not very much

Oh I guess it was more on GDAX. Meh...low liquidity.. 
That's exactly what I was thinking watching the 1-minute chart, literally exactly painting a red daily candle right on time.
We get it, dude. You're a permabear, hate Bitcoin, conspiracy theorist or whatever.

If you hate this market and asset so much then why are you here?

I always seem to see Tether FUD whenever bitcoin is at the tail end of a rally?
Silly little penguin 🐧,

Please move your FUD someone else 
other than obvious fud what does this post/thread hope to achieve?
Bitcoin is illegal in a lot of places...no surprise Tether would be as well.
Downvoters and snide commenters: you guys know that Gox "FUD" got harshly downvoted in 2013/2014, too? Then the same people that downvoted did a 180 and said it was "obvious."

No matter how the Tether saga plays out, Tether and Bitfinex are a stain on the Bitcoin and crypto ecosystem. Honestly I wish they would just slip away into obscurity, but y'all just keep giving them your money so....

1 downvote = 1 ostrich
blatant FUD like this should be a bannable offense honestly. 
Nobody can “admit” that something is illegal.  That’s not how the justice system works (at least in the United States).  I can’t read the screen shot you posted so I have no idea what your evidence is.  I think you need to do a little better job of explaining the point you’re trying to make.  
What about it? It's there
do you consider this volume low or high?
ETH is leading, volume is not pathetic but not great either
Ehh. Could be. But the market can stay irrational longer than you can remain solvent, never forget that. Keep tight stops
my position is that I scalp the range until $10K goes down(and will just continue scalping with short term trades until at at least $12.6K...at which point I assume the reversal is real and start building out a hold position)


Yeah it’s super fucking annoying 
So is GDAX.
It went as low as 100$ (@9560) on this last dip. Low liquidity and more people willing to short than to long.
Placed a buy order @9469 just in case a flash drop happens. If it starts going down slowly will close it and see where it's going to bounce.
9500 is proving to be strong support. Hoping we dip below it so I can get a fill on a limit buy. 

We bounced right off the 0.50 fib line a few minutes ago. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/87ieT2EC/
considering your need for recognition I'd definitely say you're a god.
It only makes you a TA god if you used technical analysis to come to that conclusion. 

If you predict that there are multiple universes because you experienced some unexplainable deja vu, and an hour later we discover that there are — in fact — multiple universes, that doesn't make you an astrophysics god. 

It certainly makes you correct though.
you sound like an annoying kid either way so lose/lose imo 
It only qualifies if you're consistently right, not if you're lucky once.
What feels wrong about it? 

The market overcame a major hurdle when it broke above $9,200 the other day. 

The fact that it kept oscillating both above and below that horizontal resistance was a bit odd, but today's move is pure, unadulterated conviction so far.
Feels exactly right to me. Haven't made a single trade since going all in at 8650. Might not even until 10900 or even 11700.
Take a position and just sit on it. All I see is regrets from shorters since 6.5k on this sub. I'm sure people will remain skeptical until 20k and even then people will be like "idk about this man"
shhhhh, shhh. Just let it happen. 
Why don't you do a Ctrl-F for "Kraken" on this page: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/eos/#markets

Then go look at their order depth: https://www.kraken.com/charts

And let me know if you wanted to pump $100's of millions of dollars in EOS... you would wanna do it on Kraken.
The volume on kraken for EOS is nothing compared to huobi and okex. Bitfinex has a USD pair though with a lot of volume.
What do you mean when you say, "it"?
I posted about this yesterday. 

Others poked some holes in my argument, but my stance is essentially that interest in alts translates to interest in crypto — which includes BTC. 

If alts are on a tear, it just signifies that there's money flowing into crypto. Since bitcoin is the undisputed crypto market leader, that interest should ultimately translate into continued gains for BTC. Particularly when the alt run pump and dump reaches the "dump" portion of the cycle, and investors flee back bitcoin. 
ETH a shit coin? Lol 
> Most alts are up 100% for the month

Fake news.  Most alts are not up 100% for the month.
That’s what I’ll do yeah. Luckily it was not leveraged.
If we get to $9800 again I can't see a reason why we wouldn't bust past it. So yeah, you can buy then or buy whenever you think it's bottomed out. 

Which could be anywhere between here and $7800 really. 

Personally i think you may want to buy back in sooner rather than later but I could be wrong

Like Damon said, a good buy would probably be mid $9ks.

Sitting and waiting wouldn't hurt though, you sold at a great point. 
I'm waiting to re-enter in the $9400-$9500 range.  It'll take 12-24 hours for price to reset and settle.  I suspect we'll break $10k by the 7th.
Grats :)
Better close that before the price goes to 3k. ;)
Very doubtful if recent behavior is any indicator. 

While this is the largest premium I've seen in quite awhile, every previous attempt to remain in contango hasn't lasted more than 24 to 48 hours. 

The moment there's a 2%+ correction that isn't immediately bought back up, the premium evaporates and falls to neutral at best or a .5% to 1% discount at worst.  
Because if we break from $9750 resistance with some gusto, I see no reason why it doesn't move all the way to $10k.  I'll reopen a short from here if this happens
Jesus candle up your ass.
$6-7 billion a day is better volume than just about anything in the Dow. Not sure how it's "poop."
I'd urge you to focus more on price movement and direction... we're now at $9400... when will you feel convinced this is a breakout?
Although low, on gdax volume is 25-30% higher than yesterday.
My long triggered at the line.  I have stops just below the line should this completely turn around... but I don't anticipate this happening...
Ah okay thanks I just read about the bot but not about the syntax needed. Gonna try to post it correctly on my next trade.
Great entry 
No stops right now as I’ve just dropped everything I’m doing and staring at my screen. 

Just gonna let her ride 
Just gonna hold off, would rather break even then run the risk of this shooting to 12k and beyond 
Not gonna close, I’ve been taking profits recently to offset my greed.

But I think right now it’s the best time to be greedy with a long position, best time in a long time 
RSI is grossly high on every timeframe from 15-4H

But The RSI on daily / weekly shows it still has room to run 
Thanks! This is a bit fast though. Like Chewy said a pullback to the previous resistance line of the wedge could be likely. 

I know you're not a fan of fractals but just like then: https://www.tradingview.com/x/GOwM0KRC/

Longs are notoriously harder to squeeze than shorts, though. But yes, we'll see how this goes. 

I'm not sure why a whale would want to fight against a rally to squeeze the harder side of the market if they're actually a whale holding a lot of BTC. I mean, obviously shorting the market, but it seems like an uphill battle. The opposite of the wreckage we saw sub 7K.
Would take 3000BTC on Bitfinex to drop the price to 9200... That's a lot for just 500$ (if it failed to start closing longs).
If the price dropped to below 8800 than yes, it would be effective.
Same here. Last time we were around this level, it fell off pretty quickly.
my guess is they'll want to get above $10K just to have a massive way of short closers panic buys/and FOMOers at 10.3-10.4...then they can let it drop off and the price will be consolidating at $10K instead of at $9K
Actually I couldn't get a long position to take on BitMex and so waiting this out... will attempt a short if this moves towards $10k... eventually this run will end and we should see a couple big red candles
Not only that, but means people (probably hodlers) wanted to sell 34 million worth of bitcoin.
Absolutely not true, and bitcoin searches aren't just "what is bitcoin" 

I mean, 90% of people here probably couldn't explain to you how bitcoin works, so I really doubt people are even googling "what is bitcoin" before googling "how do I buy bitcoin" 

The trends come from "how to buy bitcoin" and related searches. These will always spike as bitcoin gets higher and higher. If you don't believe so, you're just lying to yourself. 

I didn't know what bitcoin was in December 2013, Googled it back then.

You bet I Googled it again in August 2017 right before I bought though. 

Google trends are always a good indicator of new public interest, even if it lags. 
What are you talking about with putting *own* in quotes due to coinbase? Shit, one of the first bitcoins I bought in 2013 was with a Monkeypak card trading with some dude on bitcointalk forums. Did I own those more than people who bought off Coinbase? 
BTC hasn't been over $10,000 once this Spring...what are you talking about? 
I lied yesterday, this community does like fun!
I could see this develop into an ascending triangle that’s knocking at 9750 over the next few days 
Right, but if there is a large number of longs and the price is not moving up, shouldn't that make them implode, especially since there are no shorts to be covered?
Agreed and that’s what I was getting at.  FOMO news for the general public.
Yes they have a big pile of my money from over the past couple of years. I still come out ahead, but not sure how.
I think I like this scenario. It would give RSI time to reset, it would be a good consolidation, (it would give me a good long entry). I'm not 100% sure if it will play out, I hope it does. I'll keep an eye on it though.

>The last value is the stack %, did you mean 5%? If so should be 0.05. Will probably change the syntax to make it easier. Will add your position manualy since the bot failed to catch the edit. 

Yes. OK, will edit to 0.05
>If you are using 10x leverage... and it goes against you by 3% ... won't you lose 30% in the trade?

Yes, with 10x leverage I lose 30% of my margin on the trade if the position moves 3% against me. 

>I always read how you only gain/lose  3-5% in a trade

I try to keep it simple by only mentioning the P/L on my position size. My leverage is usually irrelevant as my stops hit well below my liquidation point. 
Bitcoin reminds me ALOT of when I farmed gold on World of Warcraft. I actually made close to $20,000 doing as a senior in high school years ago. 

Would constantly stalk the market, buy the dips, sell at highs, accumulate low, ect.

I played nearly every day of my life, Bitcoin brings me back to the good old days, I think that’s why I’m so obsessed with it 

On my server, I was actually considered a whale where I could easily manipulate the market in the snap of my fingers. 
God that is depressing
Thank you for reading.
the trend is your friend?
You said the same thing yesterday while also completely missing the point that most of the alts are at 40-50% of their ATH just as BTC is. 
https://blog.golemproject.net/ready-set-launch-b14d73ca5400
Or maybe Bitcoin really is becoming that stable coin everyone wanted and the other coins are now where bitcoin was a year ago.

I've been seriously considering not using Tether and just diving in to Bitcoin instead. It's been so stable.
Confirmation bias. It's very hard to get rid of and form an unbiased opinion. I know you are a bitcoin maximalist and have a general pessimistic view of alts (we've been there before), IMO you really should give alts in 2018 a second chance. 
Five percent rise in a day during a three week down trend = possible bull trap. As we are up 30 percent over three weeks, it looks more like the little dips of late were bear traps. Quite possible that we see some heavy covering of OTC shorts today and tomorrow. Don't short right now, guys.
Those are lagging indicators.
What are you, Italian?
I cant short this anymore, the trend is your friend.

Shorting has diminished my stack way too much. I dont plan on shorting unless it’s an absolute OBVIOUS short 
Realistically, what’s a good point to add at 
Thanks, I wanted a new Identity anyway. 
Is this really that bad a decision? $10m is a life changing amount of money for most people, why would you risk loosing out on it.
Making $10m when you are 23 is very different to making 10x that when you are 35 (his age today). Plus he continued to work in a great job doing what he loved.

Being a multimillionaire must be an amazing experience but to be able to have that in your 20s is something different. I've been trying to make my millions in tech for a while now, I'm in my 30s, and I have definitely missed the opportunity to do things I fantasised about doing, even if I made $1b tomorrow.
If he wouldn't then Reddit could not exist today.

Elon Musk sold paypal to eBay, was it bad decision? Is he bad investor because of this?
Indeed, I'll be taking his 'prediction' with a pinch of salt.
History shows that time and time again people don't really "care" about data privacy.  

There is a breach/scandal, it hits the news, people come of the woodwork and get hyped up, it becomes fashionable to complain about it, and it then gets forgotten about.  

Then there is some reactionary regulation like the GDPR in the EU.  Which brings up another problem positioning blockchain as a solution for data privacy, it would go against GDPR in most implementations.

Nice work. Was that a large % on your overall position?
Congrats! I hope to emulate your success very soon, what strategy were you using?
No problem.
we do need some sort of fomo guage
Thanks for your input, and yes I know, I also bought the very bottom and DCA'ed a bit up and down, but still I fomo'ed in at a pinpoint moment as well, and I'm having the same feelings now that I had then. 
I just want a higher top to get a confirming change of trend, because increasing my stack at a more expensive price in a bull market is more attractive to me than buying all the way down to an unknown bottom (and both are way better than fomoing at $10k and see that order's value go 50% down)
Isn't as promising indeed, but the market as a whole is making me itch to buy more, and if it actually would pass 9.9-10k, that really pulls me to get in, which is buying at top albeit FOMO - even though I know this always ends badly 
whatd you expect? of course there was gonna be a massive attempt to sell off at 9.7-9.8k. i think its even more impressive how well we stabilized after it. mind you, we were under 9k literally a day ago or so.
Lol they're still active.. they should pivot to an ICO that's priced in FOMO butthurt. They'll finally win at something.
I mean in reality each faction gets what it wants every few months. Market cycles are great for reinforcing your own biases. Especially when they happen so quickly.
They already have what they want with retail.merchant adoption of BTC near zero and all of the other associated problems.  They don't seem to care what the price is.
Was 10K ever not assured? Next ATH will be in the range of 35K according to my calculations, probably within six months.
Awesome thank you.
yeh, short the swaps long futs thats over 1% a week if this keeps up.... :0 not half bad if you have a big stack 
You forgot to mention the transaction fees which will cost you more than 0.178&#37;
That's a pretty great checklist thanks. I guess my main problem is that I try to optimize evey movement. It's like perfectionism basically and it's hard to overcome that when you are already in profit and know that the price will turn around a bit right now, even if it only is a 40$ movement or so.
Confirmed, I did say this. 
Yup seems like there is a lot of "idk about this guys, going short" only for them to come back and be like "closed my short at a loss".

I've sat on my hands since 6.9k btc and 415 Eth and have been very happy so far
Of course, of course. I hate that I always try to optimize my trading. It's like OCD with every 20$ movement. I have a lot of sucess scalping movements, but am never holding a position longer than a 1% movement. And coming from traditional markets it all seems still pretty unreal. Combined with EURUSD acting up I gotta watch out for a lot.
> Great entry, but you just got too scared there and covered too early.

It's more like that's my trading style. But I really try to change that. I just don't have the patience. I am never affected by big moves which is both, positive and negative. 
Reading is hard isn't it. Also I don't remember being an ass to people is allowed here.
fees are covered by like $20 of movement...
When is "closing", curious as to how it is determined in a mkt that trades 24/7.  Thanks!
Stops still down at the bottom of the larger triangle/pennant?  Mine are, which is just a hair below break even.  Considering putting SL at the centerline which would lock in some profit, but if there is a fakeout...
Yes thanks i meant pennant but wrote flag. Looking good!
This is a parabolic pump, it's just very large and we're in the relatively level foothills
The world ain't what is used to be no no no no
*Shave and a haircut, two sats.*
Username checks out.
Use the alt thread to talk about it. Seriously. It's there for a reason.
Set alarms so i can decide later. Just trying to escape wicks 
On what volume, exactly?
I agree, support at 9350 seems to be building nicely. Not sure if good enough for a YOLO trade, but adding a bit there should be a decent bet.
Just straight up to 100k, right? =P RSI has plenty of room on larger timeframes, but short term we seem overbought. Therefore, pullback?
i'm on it. I just sent her off to canes to get me some more. 
Depending on the rejection, I wouldn't be too concerned yet. Overall it seems that we're returning to an overall uptrend and that the short squeeze was what triggered it. We probably won't steamroll 10k on the first go, but if we don't see a multi-day 7%+ downtrend to below 8k we should be in safe waters for the summer. 
Has 10k ever been a problem? I remember it being pretty solid support sometimes but not resistance.

Or might it be a support-turned-resistance type scenario?
I plan to tether up 50% at 9900. Not risking anything. Other than the other 50%.
That's actually what I've got going on. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/kzaLanqA/
I agree that horizontals generally superior.  

It's also a fib line for the 11.7~5.8 retracement.  

A confluence of all these things makes the 7.5k resistance, at that point in time, all the more stronger.
That was a pretty cool moment, def felt special to be a part of.
I feel that these small positions keep traders sane when there happens to be a pump regardless of how small the profits may be.. :) Many traders are probably eyeing the obvious 9400's, so 9550 is probably a good number
The intentions of the whales are quite clear since the BGD, I think. They want to go up! I think I will be making at least a partial entry at 9500s, if we retrace

Edit: I doubt whales would invest this much cash just for a fake out. Do you think there is still possibility of sub 9k? I would love to hear your opinion
My concern is that everyone is "opening their mouths from below" at that perfect price :(
Testnet market behavior isn't going to be the same though, so I'd assume it's not the best for tuning an algorithm.  Testnet would be of course the place to work out bugs and test a bots engine.
Took some sweet sweet profits on sept at 9.9.  Already had a june position open but opened a separate sept one just for fomoing to keep the 2 CAs well managed separately.  Thank you, premium!
Still just sitting on my hands. My stops are all below the top of the blue channel, but above green. I really hope I don't wake up to stopped out positions. I'll feel like a sucker for not closing the June futures long over 9900 :)

https://www.tradingview.com/x/VsW8ehtM/
HA thanks not sure if ironic or not but thanks if serious! It wasn't even legal for me to trade 2 years ago. Trading crypto since roughly 10 months now. 

Using TA since roughly 2.5 months.
thanks i try. hope you longed :D
We've had the, "We're living in 2014, not 2018" narrative crammed down our throats for awhile now.

Most bearish rationale these days ignores the fundamentals and relies solely on the (weak) assumption history will repeat itself. 

To each their own, but I prefer profit.
Yeah but one of these times will be the last time you'll see them, probably forever or at least for a very very long time. We're moon bound.
I don't have much experience to comment on how BTC dominance works, but the chart on CMC looks like a descending wedge in BTC's favor, no?
The market makers need as few BTC sellers as possible when they want to push BTC price up.

By creating mini rallies in altcoins, they are causing small players to move off from BTC to other coins. This will reduce number of BTC holders and will also let the whales accumulate even more BTC, hence reduced sell pressure for the [markup phase](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:market_analysis:wyckoff2).

When you alter the ALT:BTC price you create an arbitrage opportunity in fiat. Bots will resolve this disparity resulting in fiat falls/gains for ALT and BTC.

sorry, but lol... just lol
No, time to take a home equity loan out and go all in /s
bada Bing bada boom 
They were silly. At least this time we're closer to log trend. 
I called those people stupid then.  The sheer rate of growth was insane and we didnt get back into trend until we had fallen below 10-15k or so (dont quote me it was much below the highs).  Anyone thinking there would not be a 75% retrace has never actually traded through a bubble.  That said, anyone whose traded through a 75% retrace is beginning to get excited.  We're lining up to never see 10k again by all historic patterns.  Not there yet, but I give it an 80% probability within the next 2 months of breaking away in a way that will not return to <10k.

Edit: it was 11k on the down swing when we finally got back into the channel we might consider sanity.  Everything before that from the first break above 8.4k was just brainless hype and I warned about it numerous times.

> but I held this sucker to -20% ROE so I'm not about to let it get stopped out early. 

Btw, though I totally agree with your sentiment, and I think you have your SL in a good place and you have good justification about it... Them's position-marriage words!
Well I do not try to use my basic TA skills to predict movements,  it's just a tool for me to abstract the market to help me what to do next. As seen here, the 9800 level is a break up could occur, so then I would go long if this held for 4h or so. If it broke down, then I would wait for a test of the 8600 instead 
Agreed. I just mentioned not touching a long due to all the euphoria. Same goes for shorts if they aren't from the 9720+ range. 

I always viewed divs not as predictive but supportive of already existing predictions. On their own they are not all that great. But combined with some other indicators they seem to be a nice signal. 

>a high volume VPVR node

Never heard of VPVR before. I swear I get all my education on TA from this sub. Gonna look that up now.

EDIT:

> Something else to consider for the bull case is how this approach actually seems relatively more stable - last time we got to it off a short term parabolic advance and had a mini blow off top.

I kinda have to disagree a bit. Of course this rise was based on a breakout instead of advancing through no mans land, but coming from 8.8k two days ago to 9.75k is still pretty big. Also I would argue that it seems less stable because this whole rise happened on a lot less trades being made as indicated by the volume. If you are talking about volatility, then I agree. But if you're talking about price discovery, then I don't.



Never used the stoch rsi before. Will look into it. 
Problem is, in a *real* bull trend, you'll be missing out on a lot if you are waiting for that.
RSI hasn't been below 20 on the 4h chart since february 6, and that was the absolute bottom since the ATH...
I am referring to the last top around 9750. We managed to get higher to around 9779 but made a lower high on the RSI. Is visible on all time frames 2h and above. Maybe even 1h but didn't check. You can see it even better on the daily.

Edit: You could argue that this was unavoidable due to our parabolic advance 1.5 weeks ago but it's still worth pointing out imo.
That's what I'm saying people here who keep mentioning volume I feel like don't truly pay attention to it.

For example, for the people saying "this feels like 11.6k" no, in no way does it feel the same. 24hr volume on gdax was around 8k btc with that run up (wash trading to the extreme), we've seen three even four times the volume this past month with these rises. Granted the volume still wasn't huge, but crypto as a whole loss a ton from the overall market cap so really it's all realtive in terms of the actual numerical amount with the 24hr volume. Just need to see if volume increases (like a decent amount compared to what it was) with price rise to instill confidence.
Interesting, thanks for your input. You said you've worked in finance before? 
Same, but who knows, the market could react very strangely. Wouldn't be surprised to see btc pump upon this news. Wouldn't  really be surprised to see it dump. or both...kinda like s2x
Well I believe bitcoin has been ruled as a commodity, because there was no pre-sale or ICO like there was for ETH in 2014. So this arguably *could* be good for bitcoin given that ETH is #1 competitor. 

It could also be terrible, which is why I'm curious for more insight. 

I just haven't really read much about it yet. Did a quick search on here and saw nothing 
I think it is actually good for Bitcoin. ICOs are bullshit and ETH is a centralized piece of poopoo. I made the point months ago in ETHtrader that ETH is going to be made an example of by regulators because it's the first and biggest of its kind. Everyone lambasted me and said I was a moron. Let's see. 
It's a difficult grey line to judge indeed.  But note that a mod is in this thread, and efforts are being made to keep this on topic on how it effects the market and ultimately bitcoin.
issuance of erc20 tokens would probably be more problematic than ethereum itself. It will probably limit the ability of businesses to get funding through coin issuance.
> Long term, regulatory clarity and industry compliance with those regulations is good for Bitcoin, IMO.

Of course if they over-regulate Bitcoin's competition, it will be good for Bitcoin, most likely.  If they made all the alts illegal, but not BTC, then would be good for its price.
> Classification of alts as securities will probably stabilize the overall market.

They are not thinking of a blanket classification though, right?  I thought that only ICO style *token* holdings would count for that, and that other classifications are needed for *coins* that are for currency or utility.
I get it.  For me the eth/btc has been a good indicator on the 1m of late.  It isn't promoting eth, but is helpful if you are interested in btc.
You're doing great for first week on the job. Please do consider allowing btc-alt talk in here. Cuz sometimes the alt daily gets flooded with low quality alt shill comments. The regulars in here are higher quality posters and we all could stand to benefit from a broader perspective as long as it relates directly to btc
No, completely unrelated.  I don't even know what an alt is. 
if it really was gold i'd be impressed.  But of course he's a shitcoin shill.  Have fun 100xing with your random shitcoins because it's going to 0 eventually.



ETH I think, it's pushing ratio highs not seen since early March 
k
#
You mean...like it's done a half a dozen times in the last 2 weeks?
Believe it or not, this is a market and not going straight up is a good thing. I know it seems crazy to you because you're high on gains but if you sit back and look at it objectively- a larger pullback + strong bounce would be more bullish than simply up with almost no pullback. 

The market being overextended just to get back to the same point it was at before just sets us up for a more violent dump in the end
Uh, we do that all the time; it's called consolidation. We did it a bunch in the $8 and $9Ks....
It has done that many, many times over the past two years.
Even though we're on opposite sides of the fence on this one, I appreciate you bringing some ammo to your side of the argument; upvoted.
> This can't keep going up with already 5th weekly green on the horizon

Uhh have you looked at the chart before January?
BTC was 8k two weeks ago.
Does this mean it's make or break time?
just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not actually after you...
How do you have 5 upvotes a millisecond after posting already?

Anyway, you misunderstood. Manipulating the funding rates to get longs to close before a pump is not about just me.
I pretty much never watch swaps. 

In a case like this where there's such a massive fee, wouldn't there just be an overwhelming surge of shorts opening and longs closing just as the fee is set to be paid? 

Is the ensuing volatility localized to the perpetual swaps, or does it bleed over to the futures contracts and potentially the spot market as well?
is an arb play possible with bmex? they have pretty big fees and unreliable execution

Are you still short?
Thats what the funding WILL be. It stays once it is updated. The funding after that is projected at .33%.... that number however is subject to change. 
errr shi ma?!?
so can i earn 0.3584% in 5 hours if i short?
or is it diluted by all the other shorters?

FWIW, we had yet to break the major downtrend resistance from the ATH when we reached those levels previously. Now that it's not looming, perhaps that might make a psychological difference. 
We were still on a downtrend at that time 
Lol people have been saying that since $100 bud.
This reminds me Chevy longing the drop from ath. He added like 3 times and managed to go from big loss to exit at be.
> bravo. now go get a ~~happy meal~~ tuna sandwich

Have we forgotten who we *are*?
Im 100% with you but also remember this is a trading sub so I can understand if people here are uncertain. We witnessed a bubble in 2017 whether it has popped and the slow bleed is what have people second guessing. I on the other hand will buy and store a portion of labour in bitcoin. Being South African and hearing our neighbor s stories (Zim) im not that trusting in fiat or our economy... I can only really invest in offshore equities with 26% of my money the rest i have to keep local except for Bitcoin... I believe in it and I dont see adoption dying - its only begun 
Comment on point.  Big picture we had a classic capitulation bottom to $6k in Feb, rounded A&E bottom in April followed shortly by break of log resistance. More than this, billions of VC capital has been poured into the space this last year in the form of exchanges, services and infrastructure in preparation for the next wave.
I agree 100%.  
I do not think 3K is coming either, I am moderately bullish mid term, but until next halving there is another 1M coins to be mined. That is 10B extra fiat inflow (on the top of dumps) only at current prices.

This factor will be limiting fro growth and this factor will keep the alts bubbling. The main factor limiting BTC right now is POW that diminishes the natural network effect. Sadly, nothing can be done with it.
Happy cake day to one of the most sensible posters on here!
For you: https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rpqc4/daily_discussion_saturday_august_05_2017/dl80sc2/
HAHAHAHAHA, do you know how long I've heard that one for. 
0 USD is not possible, because I would buy all at 0.01 and hang them at my wall.
Exactly.  It always amazes me how so many people here think future events are either 0% or 100% probable.

And $3K is certainly less probable this year than it was several weeks ago.  But if $9700 is a double top and the bear market continues downwards, then certainly a significant chance of seeing that level again, especially with increased gov't regulation and banning of crypto.
Brb putting up massive buy walls at $0.
I have (perhaps misplaced) faith that if the banks decide to fuck everyone again the masses might just cotton on to the fact that the 'trickle down' bullshit is exactly that. 


I remember last summer when it took out $3000 and seemed like total madness.   Of course we could revisit that level...in a few months or in a few hours if things really went south.  
weary means tired
Wary != Weary
we may not be done with the bear market but the long/short ratio is way too bearish considering the price action.

There's still too much disbelief.

That won't work, as the only pair involving USDT on Kraken is USDTUSD.
I meant that EURUSD is extremly volatile (relatively speaking) right now and that is messing with the BTCEUR quiet a bit. Also liquidity is way lower on BTCEUR
Doesn't work that way sadly. Tried it already.
Awesome, I did not know it works so easily. So do I get this right: On the Funding page I just select "Return" for those loans with high interest rates and then it automatically takes a new loan for that at the current rates?
lol come on
Breaking out of the symmetrical triangle and making higher lows has helped cure my bart syndrome just a tad bit 
Those weren't textbook. Most of those moved horizontally or upwards after the pole. Flags should....you know...flag.

Thanks! It sounds better than it is though. BTCEUR seems to do its own thing lately 
My decision to short was not only based on the RSI but because "MUHH 9500". I think psychology was a big factor here too.

Edit: Also a nice shooting star is forming.
daily funding for shorts >+1% ... same advertised rate as biitconnecct
I think a dip is quite possible but it wouldn't be large enough to merit the risk of being squeezed.
He's re-iterating a previous post about his long. Lighten up.
On this recent runup there were three stops that sort of plateau before ascending again.  But this one is the inverted V.
Yes.. i am aware.. so you are saying the first rejection was just market dynamics and this time because of the last time?  Maybe i was expecting it was some fib level or something.
Probably a small one. Longs avoiding the fee and shorts wanting to make money off it 
in 4 hours 
but the trend is down, for each "alt season" it goes down more. and ETH has not even started to move on the ratio yet...
There were times when btc went up and alts went down. It wouldn't suprise me if dominance go 35->20->30
I'm calling for 20% dominance.

Since the time we've lost the 80-90% region I've been looking for the 20% region.


You could argue that this might be money entering into btc once the ratios are super good but yeah, i also have a bad feeling.
So you acknowledge that you don't understand it, but claim it's all useless, interesting.

4 green weeks in a row, all pumped with squeezes/huge market buys but no one of my December crypto friends even mentions a single coin. That's actually good for bitcoin although the next few hours will be critical (TM). /s
agreed
Yep. 10K+
I went to book a flight inside Europe another day. I chose to fly with AirBaltic went to see if I they accept paypal. I found that they accept wire payments, credit cards, paypal and even Bitcoin. I was surprised that I can book my flights with bitcoin now? That's cool. But then I though what I can do with alts? Speculate only? 
What fundamentals does BTC have exactly?
Bitcoin has weak fundamentals now. Constant fighting, slow, expensive to use etc. This is still the tech world. Bitcoin will be passed eventually. Hedge your bets.
thinking the same
Just sold my last 35% of my stack to get 100% back into BTC. Stamping this post at 36% dominance. People getting confidence back into crypto isn't going to lead to shitcoin XYZ going 500x, it will lead to BTC climbing back up. just my 2 sats.
Yeah but by then 1 million USD will only buy you a 10 year old Honda Civic.
Good r/r
not ballsy at all. position size less than 1% of my portfolio, early stop and no leverage
Double top target.
only 4.5% of the gains we've seen since 2009 though 😜
do you still see testing the resistance of the previous wedge as a strong possibility?

We did the same when  we broke out of the previous triangle :  https://www.tradingview.com/x/GOwM0KRC/
I'm going with gut feeling which I know is the worst way to trade, I'll probably take profit much higher based on the comments. I just feel that a pullback is likely needed here before breaking through $9700 with volume, and I suspect once we retrace to $9550 we might continue down $200-300ish.

Also thank you for the feedback everyone. It's a played out joke but I'm expecting a spike up past $10k any second now
I would cover most of my short at $9400, depending on how we got down there.
That wasn't slow and steady at all.
Right it's not free money by any means. It's just one indicator to look at that might signal the end of a bull trend. It's generally high risk and high reward to try to pick tops or bottoms.

If you did what I said in Oct, Nov, and Dec, there were plenty of places to close your shorts in profit. $7800 to $5500 for example. 

If we are indeed in a bull market again, the upward trend will continue. Premiums tend to get reset often along the way though.
I agree that it's not the best signal, but I assume he's factoring in the current market conditions and thinking it'll be like $11k. When did futures switch over to having a premium after the initial drop to $6k? 
Read my linked comment. 
Sept Futs
this is kind of a worry of mine. that all the accumulation happened in the first weeks of april (6400-7400 range) and im actually two steps behind. that would mean that any thought of mine about going sub 8k is actually just wishful thinking cos i missed out.

Still think we need to pull back a tiny little bit at the very least but yeah fuck knows, we'll see.

Not Dutch although i have visited from across the sea before :)
im not too sure about dropping below 8.6k doing damage. although i would start to wonder what the fuck is going on if we go below like 7.6k. i wouldnt get REALLY REALLY worried until we lose 6.8k

a small part of kinda believes that there's large players stress testing the market.
I think he means investing (HODLing) != trading
exactly, but people call it investing
Well it's not really a convincing break is it? It even looks like a bearish break considering how long the wick is.
I think this way of thinking is excellent for one's emotional stability! Unless all your orders get filled and start to really tank
caught some bit just now. Thanks!!!
Agreed, was only stating that it looked promising. Keeping an eye on where it lands in an hour or so. 
The volume looked good without pushing the price down too hard. 
Yep, decent volume on that last hourly candle. Real selling, real buying.
Oh no, /r/buttcoin is leaking again.
what did I just read LOL
Or go ahead and put in those limit adds 1% below spot. 
whats your position right now?

also, do you fuck with options?
Thanks chew, I should consider the r/r a little more. we have two 4h BGD's. The safer play is def buying as we retrace this run.
If $9800 is support then, $10K will likely still offer some major resistance.  So entering a long at $9850 seems like just $140 short term upside and a lot of downside.  However if you keep tight stops, then might work if going for a breakout of $10K which may not be as easy as many here seem to think.
nope, average buy was 9010 and i closed at 9250. so at least i have that going for me haha
Yes I think so
I’ve been busy making Log charts in my local library 

( this is not a joke ) 
This is different fomo than our first leg up to $9,750 too. We didn’t jump 300$ in under 30 minutes. 

We broke out $9,350 resistance, hit $9,500 and pulled back, consolidated and broke up from a bear flag.

This could be the real deal. 
All of the memes seem to die out quickly. Slowly the whole sub will be edumacated and there will be no more meme patterns :/ 
https://www.tradingview.com/x/yePJ7inS/

When you combine it with the hidden bear div, and huge funding rates... might give longs reason to worry, eh?
Fair. Ok let's spell it out fairly plainly then. Ahem...

Let's say you are a rich perma bull and bought 100 BTC at 15k on GDAX. That's a regulated FIAT gateway etc... USA gov knows you're opening for tax.

As a permabull lets say at 8k you discover Bitmex. Note that the Bitmex volume has increased on the decline. You are now BETTING you stack that BTC will go back up on leverage. So you can use even 10 of your 100 BTC to make another 100 BTC. 

Now you have 100 BTC which you can then sell on GDAX as a taxable loss. But then you have your original amount. At this point you would need to find ways to put your "extra" money to work. 100 BTC (or in the case of a whale 500) can be transferred around exchanges really easily. Easy meaning tax man has no idea... They can do BTC -> LTC and move 10m in a few minutes. From there, depending on the exchange, you are now at a no tax liability. Could be Binance, could be Finex (which explicitly says no US customers) could be anywhere. At this point you have huge weight on a low volume exchange you could:

i) Send back some to GDAX, sell for money and look like a tax loss. Now you have say a third (3m) in reserve

ii) You can put up walls on exhcange 2 (buy or sell) to induce pumps based on the dumb TA posted here

and most importantly

iii) Use decentralized and crypto <-> crypto exchanges to wash your money. Meaning you could have made 100 BTC on Bitmex then decided purposefully to take a taxable loss on LTC... Then traded that to XMR and gone on some web and bought something basic but easily tradable.


It is very very very easy to circumvent financial means via crypto as a rich person. Also as someone rich, illiquid markets just offer more opportunity for free money.

I have no proof this is happening at all, but arbitrage I know is a thing. On one hand BTC is a rare asset but on the other it is likely being used to take money from the idiot trader who is betting on a moon or a dip.

Yeah lets all put our money towards 10k for someone to use it as a tax wash on GDAX.

Rambling.. I'm happy for the bull run but it doesn't feel organic. My take... I could be wrong.
I just don’t understand why everything is so backwards. Why these pumps, why the hardcore dumps. Order books aren’t even that illiuid and I have no idea why news affects BTc so god damn much. It seems like this entire market is run by retards who will buy/sell as sheople as soon as the shepherd comes to herd.

Isn’t that exactly what a bubble is? Is Bitcoin just always going to be in a constant state of bubbles (positive and negative)?
Yes that's what I was thinking. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/i7YYFDcc/

It took us almost 4 times the time to have a reasonable attempt to break 9.7k (which is now). This is not only FOMO but legit accumulation in steps
there is an arbitrage opportunity if alts are sold for BTC, pushing the BTC price up
I meant 34% of ATH
I think BTC is great, and anything in the 7.5-8.5k area is a good price to buy right now, but these pumps are just crazy. I don’t think BTC will JUST go up or JUST go down, it will find its fair price and ossilate around those levels as the mean either increases or decreases. Its just all so strange 
I don't even know that people are betting on its future at this point.  The future of BTC is likely pretty bleak.  The future of cryptocurrency as a whole is probably pretty good though.

BTC market is heavily manipulated and most all the buying is speculation.  You would have to be crazy to buy and blindly hold it at this point.
Thanks man. Need to do some googling to fully understand it still, but thanks, appreciate the jump start
> Alts will pump again once BTC stabilizes.

Why do you think I emphasized that alts didn't follow BTC this time, contrary to other pumps in this alt season? Up to now they were going up even when BTC wasn't stable.
feeling a yolo long here >.< despite the overboughtness
 
[deleted]
it's not much different from selling here and setting a stop buy $200 above. It's not nearly as crazy as everyone here is making it sound...

people freaking out cause it's 50x leverage but he's just hedging...not 50x all in shorting 

hell, he's still 25% long technically 
It's a hedge because I am putting 1.5% of my holdings at risk to reduce my net long exposure in a price area I am uncertain of the upside potential and which would allow me to preserve some of the gains that occurred today even if the market was to drop back down to the 9200/9k level.
We gon see
Did you read my post? I don't really care if my trade gets liquidated because I am still net long.  My trade is to allow a little bit of protection of the gains that occurred in the move to 9400 in case things start heading back down.  If this is the pump to 10k I would be happy, sure I lose 1.5% but I would still be making money on the move to 10k.  Not as much if I was entirely long, but I would still be happy.
I generally trade long positions with lower leverage (normally in the 3x to 5x area).  I just don't really trust the gains that occurred today so I figured with this trade I could essentially "lock in" some of those gains with this trade. 
No, liq gets you 0.5% additional lose. Better have stops before liq hits.
It’s so crazy to think that spreads were >$1000 in December/January
It is obviously bullish for the market (and BTC) that these alts are going off like popcorn lately.  One is up 50% today and another one will probably be tomorrow.  EOS hit ATH recently and a couple of others are there or close.  So the overall market is getting more bullish and healthy.

The main risk of a long term long position is more bad news, regarding gov't regulation and that is likely to happen again soon and the higher the BTC price goes, the more likely it is to happen.
whats odd is why dont bots exploit the arbitrage fast enough, the differences have gotten pretty insane today. $70 difference at some point for BTC. even binance/gdax. i guess its the low liquidity. 
You wrote finex twice brudda
A few days ago GDAX was at $8600 and BFX was $8900. Little bit later GDAX was right back in line with BFX at like $8800 and moving up. BFX was the leader in that case.

The reality is GDAX can be misleading solely because of how low volume and illiquid it is, particularly lately. BFX is the most liquid spot exchange available, at most other exchanges can temporarily influence its price. I disagree that they're ever really "driving" it though. Plus Binance has higher volume lately and has been having a larger influence imo due to alt volume.
If I lose money on this short, I will be happy that the market is so strong.  I would certainly rather take a small loss on this position than make huge profits on it.


Yes, it's nothing new for this place.
We're still overbought on every time frame up to 4H, which is still right on the line, but there's room on the daily and weekly. A couple hours between 9600-9700 ahead of the 6PM ET volume swell could be interesting. I am surprised it's holding this well, though. I was just hoping we'd hold over 9520. 
Possibly people afraid if we get to $9,750 again we are going to blast through to 10k?

So anything in the 9600-9700 range is getting gobbled up 
hmm the battle for $12k will be much greater 

That will be actual self fulfilling TA. People will watch 60% ATH like a hawk for dozens of reasons 

triple top, that's where 2014 topped out mid summer, 60% ATH was the bottom of every correction in 2017, $12k is initially where we started when we dumped all the way down to $6k

If we pass $12k it'll be huge news. staying above $13k will likely mean new ATHs, at the very least we'll see some more significant upwards movement after that
20x return from this point on?  i'd sell one coin at $180k
idk we've been consolidating quite nicely the past week after flirting with 9700 BTC. quite a bullish sign though, volume is picking up again. still dont wanna get my hopes up until BTC breaks 12k.
These past few months have created a lot of battered bulls. Every rise is going to be treated with suspicion for a long time and there will be some that will be in denial until they buy back in at the top of the next bubble somewhere above 100k. Seriously. 
No. Not sure what he's talking about.

I was looking at the testnet.  D'oh!

That guy is, like, always wrong.
That guy has, more or less, has had some lucky guesses but not hard in a bear market. I don't think he's very good at TA and I don't like his attitude.

My paper trade was a buy in at 6800 but also sell at 8800 so, it is what it is. 
For sure eh? 
I'm pretty sure it's because bulls gore upwards with their horns and bears swipe downwards with claws.
This 'bull' run started on Bitfinex , BTC on Bitfinex traded at premium compared to other exchanges today.  We all know they have their own usdt press, they can print usdt out of thin air,  Bulls.. or exchange owners ?
Reminds me the celebration for the 10k JPY :p
That's exactly what happened. I put together a comparable-looking gross line chart and you can clearly see there is no such fractal at all:

https://i.imgur.com/AvzcPko.png
It also goes from 9000 to 17000 in several days.  It's a joke.
I do enjoy being able to say, "I told you so." Didn't realize it was a symptom of Tourettes.

Reasoning: money goes where it gets the best return.
Lots of smart people are terrible traders.
Why? No hodl stack?
Jeez people are wayyy sensitive here... If calling somebody an 'asshole' in jest offends you, I can't imagine the butthurt being around *actual* traders at a real prop desk. *shrug*

But yeah, "be excellent" I get it.
Shorts rose 2% when we hit the resistance line, then dropped 4% off the next leg up. It was a squeeze, but a reasonable one.

The BGD was likely a non-repeatable event. It took months of various factors converging for that to happen. Don't expect short squeezes or BGDs to look like that in the future. A 3% 1H candle  more than qualifies. 
[deleted]
Not enough blood on the streets. Too much optimism. 
shitpost is a little dramatic.  the bull version of this comment would be praised.  
Look what happened to gold. Around mid-2012 it looked like gold was out of the woods, rallying  after double bouncing off its panic low, and then proceeded to turn right back around and broke through major support in early 2013, and hasn't really recovered since.

Arguably a scenario that could play out in BTC.
"Market bubbles don't just start again right after they crash".

This is totally different market/time/season/pattern/fundamentals. 
This time is different (TM). /s
Not really, I'm a long term holder

I love this game! Are you an object or a person? 
3 points, now 4. 
It wasn't about 6% vs 2%.  It is about how it got there and when and when and how it retraced etc.  Anyway, it's all right there on the chart.

And no coincidence about the daily candle either.
That's today's candle, yesterday's closed up ~$500 from open.
Chill out man. The market is bulls and bears together.
Actually you don't seem to get it.  You actually seem to be incredibly confused
It's very likely real. 

That doesn't mean it won't get filled, as there's bound to be at least some legitimate interest in selling there.
I think so, there was a big hidden wall at 9630 too. Some people with big pockets are pumping BTC, and it's working as most alt ratios are starting to really plummet. 
Really risky my dude hope you have tights stops , best of luck ;)

He's a troll. Look his username. ethtrader kid 
If this goes full FOMO it should go above Bitfinex again. Just have to wait
The statement regarding short positions is incorrect.  Most of the "margin heavy" exchanges are leading the BTC/$ charge at the moment with massive premiums.  Exchanges like GDAX and Kraken, however, that don't deal with high margin and pair against "real" Dollars / Euros, have been lagging. 
aw,

too busy trying to become a millionaire overnight by turning the $100 bucks your mom gave you for your birthday after you lost 75% of it when the bubble popped and you tethered out at $6.5K?

Hah, of course it'll go back down!  SHORT, SHORT SHORT!
Feels good man
Just that we can have a line from 11k7, touching 9k7 and now 9k45. It should be another resistance line other than the ones from the triangles. 
Yes some of the hotter and more technologically advanced alts will drag BTC up along with them.  But not as fast, which is why you see the BTC marketcap % dropping more and more.  It's down to 36% now and will probably be about 25% or lower by the end of the year.

BTC will likely underperform in the crypto market just like it has the last two or three years, every year.  But it's a decent trading vehicle, with more exchange offering it and more trading volume.


Makes sense. So you don't think this is all one big bubble that just keeps inflating and then crashing? Because from where I'm standing, ETH has no busines being anywhere near 700 USD
He's so salty. 
He says that 100% of the altcoins are "shitcoins" and also that there is "zero practical world use" for 100% of altcoins.  Laughable, I agree.
IOTA, ADA, ETH (almost, but if you count the low on April 7th as “beginning of month”, then that too), BCH, XLM (same deal as ETH), ZEC close but no cigar
I just follow this group.  I'm positive 15% after being down 60 since I started.  I would be up alot if I had hung out here for a week before I bought my first BTC in mid January.  Granted DCA and timing entry and exit for some good ALT runs helped, but this place is hands down my number 1 resource.  Plus I enjoy the banter and everyone here at least acts like an adult.  Thank You! 
Went back in at 9600 with a stop at 9575.  Just felt right. 
I was eyeing 9400, so 9450 it is.  If that does not hit I'll jump back in after we hold 9800 for a bit.  Thanks! 
Changed my thoughts. Got back in at 9600.  
Full disclosure, it was a layered buy (knife catching special) from 6600-4800, and only 2 of 10 executed, and they were tiered as well, so it was a relatively small position. 2% of stack (meant to scale in to 20% of stack). 
Yeah I know. It's why I'm keeping an eye open but it's already evaporating quickly.
You're going to short it it breaks $10k? after closing at $9850?
Ah alright got you! Good luck!
agree I'd bet a break up from this level is straight to 10.3k

LOL !!
Am convinced now after that push over 9.4... MMs we're muddling around before then 
I can edit your entry tomorrow. [site](http://bitcoinmarkets.atwebpages.com) with examples
Fixed your entry on the database. Assumed 100% with no leverage. Next time you can set it if you follow the example. Thanks again. 
thank you!
only a little worried about a double top at the moment
If you are more risk averse, cash out 50% and let the other 50% ride. That way you get the upside if it keeps climbing and the flexibility to inject capital to lower your cost basis, if we pull back.
At this stage, a pullback to 9450 would be harsh. I'm just sitting here drooling at my position. It was -20% ROE two days ago. Now it's 58%. And I'm only using 7x lol. 
> Longs are notoriously harder to squeeze than shorts

I've seen this repeated a few times - what's the reasoning behind it?
To enter a lot lower?
I'd say about 30% of the longs nowadays are bitmex 20x leverage longs.. not hard to squeeze at all.  these ain't the hodlrs of yore.
though the institutions are hodlrs now.

3000btc on bitfinex and combined with 300 btc at 100:1 on bitmex can make u a mint.  Plenty of whales have 3k btc
You know how many stops would be triggered on such a drop now?
Ahh pesky exchanges. I was thinking this would end in the low 10ks. Alright buddy thanks for the reply. 
Not only that. It cost them 33.8 MM to implement crypto trading. Yes they profited ~200k
I'm willing to bet its mostly random people googling it to see the price.  I think the next time we hit AHT it'll start rising again and peak just as much at the top.
Hm, good point about "how to buy" vs "what is" searches. I've only ever considered the latter.

I do think a large percentage of the searches are/have been "what is". I would hope that most people don't just buy something that they are entirely clueless about.
I’m not sure. If they belonged to a private key you held, then yes.
My brain is old and full of corn. My apologies for the mistake there.
So he's technically right
The resistance from our previous little pre-breakout upward channel could even become support to this potential ascending triangle.
In essence you're right, such a high ratio *could* imply a cascading effect downwards if they get squeezed. However, longs are already closing and the price is moving down instep. A squeeze doesn't have to happen though if buying pressure is able to mitigate it.

Overall, I personally think that such a high ratio makes the possibility of downwards movement greater, though it's not a good indicator of an aggressive implosion in price. In other words, opening a short here provides good r/r, whilst opening a long provides bad r/r.
If most people are like myself (and evidence suggests they may be), then most alt longs are on very low leverage.
In any case I'll probably just add to positions at each tier of support we go settle at, until it converges with my ca and I bail.
how do you know?

Agreed. Alts crashed harder then BTC so it makes sense for them to recover a bit.
ATH in $ or against BTC tho? I guess you must mean BTC I spose since most don't even exchange for $ unless you mean indirectly?
They also got listen on buthumb and some other exchanges
hmmm, didnt know that
We've gone up 40% in a month. I think you've overdosed on altcoin market and become desensitized. 
Bitcoin stable? ROFL....
That would be nice.

That's not confirmation bias. That's him providing an example of something that's getting flooded with money for no justifiable reason.
*Moms spaghetti, knees weak arms are heavy*
That's pure fomo speaking out of you here though. While the trend is your friend the trend has its highs and its lows. I hate to predict the mid term cause my forte is shorting/longing movements that overextend for a quick scalp but you really shouldn't add right now because the breakout is pretty weak.

 It's not the worst idea but not the best either.
But isn't the r/r on a short here pretty good? If it's potentially a double top and we're sitting right below 10K, I feel pretty comfy short here.
>I cant short this anymore, the trend is your friend.

>Shorting has diminished my stack way too much.

It sounds like you're problem is your longing when you should short and shorting when you should long.
Now, or wait 15m and see where the price is at. 
From a purely numeric standpoint, $1.8B \> $10M. However, there is no doubt $10M is still a considerable amount of money. Good on him for creating the platform we all love and use. Im just saying he blew his load a little early, could of found VC to grow the platform instead of selling out. Hence why I think his business/investing temperament is questionable to say the least. However, we dont know about his personal circumstances at the time. Back to the subject, ETH will most likely not hit 15K per ETH this year \($1.5T for a network thats in it's infancy while Microsoft, a global tech behemoth with several products is valued at $600B\). He is out of his mind on this one. Thats for sure.
Yes, I believe Reddit would exist today \(and probably be better sooner\) even if they did not sell. Infact, he and the other founder had to come back \(after they sold\) to make Reddit what it is today.  Had they not sold, i believe Reddit would have been better, earlier. That's my opinion.
We'll see how it unfolds but GDPR i thought was surprisingly thorough. Even at the business I work at which wouldn't seem to be hugely affected at first glance is having to take large steps to comply 
About 10%
Yeah that's understandable.
A little over two days ago, but yeah.


I think I probably did overeact. It is a bit too early to tell, but maybe the fact that we haven't dropped even FURTHER down is actually kinda bullish? I'm not sure. I do not think we are hitting 10k this week though.
I think as long as bitcoin is above, say, $3k they will be generally unsatisfied. 


I can assure you they'd be much happier if the price went lower. Most of the disdain they have for bitcoin hodlers is that they (buttcoiners) feel they (hodlers) got lucky despite attributing their profits to a keen eye for revolutionary financial assets. 

Most hodlers I know believe they *deserve* the money, that they earned it. Buttcoiners feel the exact opposite. that's the crux of the entire spectacle imo 
co-.....could I see those calculations, please?
Short the swaps long the futs has been working out pretty well, but sadly 100 bucks is 1% of 9500, so if you get caught in a dump and the premium disappears, you lost all the benefit
limit orders have negative fees
I liked the snow analogy a bit more ;-)
I usually scale in and out of positions and that helps me, and also makes sense because the odds usually change slowly, not hugely at once.  I covered half of my mega short, but still have half left right now.

And if your trading style works for you and you are profitable, then sometimes not necessary to fight your basic nature that much and just go with it.
Yep. At Kraken I only pay 0.02 in makers at the moment so even better, fees are covered by a 4$ movement.

I have a 30% market stop under 9200 for some profit and the remainder is down at the bottom of the pennant, which would be a net loss. 
Damn you got me, I deserved that one!
Well, the only reason that btc is going up right now is because eth is going up.

If you want to make money trading btc, it's better to follow eth's charts, because they seem to be leading and they're easier to read.
Sorry, What do you mean?
I waited for a pullback from 8100 to 9700... RSI won't stay in the way of FOMO
Resistance is really 9800. Once 9900 falls, 10K is practically an inevitability. 10250 is the next level to conquer. 
The long term weekly moving average is at 10k.  Plus, it's a big number with psychological significance.  If we get past 10k, 12k is the next big milestone imo
No. I sold at 10k last bull run waiting for crash and bought back in at $11.5
200 day sma is currently sitting right at 10k, just FYI.  
I really believe 10k will be a problem as it's the first time we've been up against it for weeks.

If we blow past it though then the bear market is dead and you may as well strap in. (imho - this is not financial advice)
horizontals will always beat meme lines
Will never forget how much of a moon boy I was. I was so fucking ecstatic. Really felt awesome. Nothing after that really came close, idk why 

Part of it is I was asleep got the melt up to $19.2k on GDAX lol. Woke up to $17k 
10x short with 9% of your stack keeps you agnostic/sane.
So even if that's the case, you don't want to go long right before a further drop....before the uptrend continues.  At least people who care about money don't want to do that.

And of course it's not clear what their intentions are at this particular moment.
True, and the opportunity *may* have passed already considering other exchanges have hit. Finex might just be too thic for that kind of dip at the moment. 
Maybe too bad you didn't take any profits up there, but maybe it'll be for the best!

I'd be uncomfortable sleeping stops that high. Mine are below the bottom of the channel and I'm comfortable being under the 9450 support.  But I took a laddered profits totaling 50% around each resistance including the top on the june, and the sept fomo grabbed it's first ladder from 9800 ~ 9900, and then took an additional 50% chunk at the first fall to lower support.  So I can afford to lock less profits into the SL and give it more slack.  (though I'm only break even for the last weekish).  I brought the CA up a little too high on the sept fomo long here though.  Should have waited until the next *upward* support shift to add to it again.  Won't make any profit on again on that one unless the price goes up from here.  (but the main point of the fomo long basically to be unidirectional and have quick lock-ins, so whatever)

I still have 50% of the position, and less than half of that is allocated in lower 10k to take, the rest hopefully rides further after raising the ca there.  

After I see how far down we go, when we have signs to go back up I'll add to the June, and if we redip and that just kills it with no SL profit to be had, so be it.  

No regrets no matter what happens, I'm satisfied.

edit: flipped the months

I wish I had! :D
So.. 'this time it's different' ?
PS this can go very high before the bear resumes. Plus it can bubble again. But the end is always the same... 
The bear narrative about 2014/2017 is absurd on the surface. Anyone who was around for that period and buying can tell you that this is very different. They're painting a zebra, calling it a horse, and trying to race it in the Kentucky Derby
Moon was $10K, so yes maybe we are moonbound because less than 1.5% away.
Im saying compre the date if the dominance lows to how the price of btc behave after the lows
what if the ALT doesn't have a USD/USDT pairing though (most I assume?)
Exactly this :-D
No actually. Just pointing out that it's a bit silly to compare this breakout to the one from $6,800 to $7,800.
BGBP. Yes. Fully support this. 
I just posted a top-level comment.
Based on what ? ...  probably wishful thinking
Cashcall mortgage commercials are constantly on the radio suggesting you should "buy the bitcoin dip"
Home equity loan? That is so 2017. Sawing into the walls and removing copper pipes and wiring and selling the scrap is where we're at now.
this guy gets it.

-_- 

you're not wrong, sir. 
I relatively recently started using it but I really like it and it's not too complicated to understand. It gives a great idea of zones we could possibly blow through and zones to watch closely, especially when used as confluence with resistance/supports (particularly horizontal).

To use it on trading view you unfortunately need to have a membership other than the free one though.
I guess there's different ways to view it.

For me, this sharp rise makes sense as we've already crossed these levels in recent times and it was initiated by a large pattern breaking up, and volume on the last two 4 hr candles was the highest it's been since the blow off at 9.7k. This rise appears more similar to me to the breakout from 8.3 to 8.8 than anything else. It could definitely have a different outcome, of course.

Meanwhile, the last rise was overextending the RSI on nearly every time frame under the 3 day and the growth was accelerating to near vertical (on the 15 min/hourly). *That* was unsustainable in my view. This is more like markup -> consolidation; we didn't hang out in the mid 7.6ks for nearly this long the last time. Additionally, RSI isn't nearly as overextended on the middling time periods (4 hr to daily) as previously so short term consolidation would give room for further upward momentum.


Yeah, if and when BTC turns undeniably bullish we won't get another chance to enter lower 
Stoch rsi
Thanks for the explanation! Is divergence still valid with just two points? (I'm still trying to learn)

EDIT: Yes, it is! No need to reply to me. Thanks!
Who cares if there is a daily volume of 1 btc if there all buy orders matching offers? It just means there is less liquidity because people trust bitcoin. If anything its sort of positive. 
Yes, plenty of dealing with the SEC.  Most everything I did was Reg D, so accredited investors only.  In all its wisdom the SEC equates wealth and income with financial saviness.  Some ICOs will undoubtedly have to register as a security, unless they go with one of the hybrid plans that have been presented to them, if so they would have to follow those rules.  The novel concept of letting everyone participate would be over.  Retail investors do need to be protected, they also need a recourse if they are victimized by fraud.  Hopefully all the good things unique to crypto are viewed as part of the function of a new and vibrent asset class, with the regulatory insight desperately needed to truly open up the market for institutional investment.

I don't understand how anyone thinks ETH being designated a security is good for BTC.  Widespread adoption will not come with just BTC, it will primarily come from alts and the real world problems they solve.  I know the BTC purest disagree, but as someone who knows other markets, Alts and all their benefits, from liquidity to technological and social progress, are the key for crypto achieving long term sustainability. 
Yeah indeed, after I clicked save on that comment I wasn't even sure if I was joking or not, and almost put in an edit where I said "but actually it could be". With BTC all but accepted into the finance industry and its regulations, it's potentially the legitimized safe haven.

With that news around the corner I'm surprised of the ETH pump and that unkillable cockroaches like XMR suffered (but this is risking digressing to the alt thread)

If anything, it would likely be bad because there would be run on the crypto bank as people look to get out. Crypto's still overpriced so any serious FUD should cause a selloff.

Especially here since few to none have been willing to sell.
ICOs have been a shitshow.  But I do believe that holding stock should evolve to become like holding erc tokens.  For example, if you have options for the company you work for, you have little control over them and they are nearly intangible.  And if you have options, the company can pull the rug from under you in a way that a digital contract could prevent.
I think the issue will be with issuing tokens that act as securities for real businesses. The businesses are probably who will be prosecuted.
I think Eth will be fine. There are companies who are using ERC20 tokens as privately issued securities. I believe those companies will start being prosecuted in the United States later this year.
Just need to make that a explicit in the post, every time, the way you did in this comment.
mods probably need to do a better job in that thread. The conversation there is intended to be equal in quality, but focused more on alts.

Cleaning up those shill comments is essential. People doing that need to understand that shilling isn't trading and it's not what we're here for. If it's just a shill thread then we need to shut it down.
One can hope, especially with those 1d bbands tightening! However, I get the feeling that the recent reversal is based on the FOMO sentiment from alts, which will dump hard sooner or alter. I'm not able to call the top on this :)
I think the market just answered that question. 
Because of my Chinese vote farm, obviously. Just look at my history of insanely upvoted comments.
Because when major price action happens, people are sitting on Reddit constantly hitting refresh. 

Especially when you’re in a long position, up-voting a bullish comment on major price movement gives your pickle a little tickle. 
From what I've seen, there's not nearly as much as you'd think when the funding rate is about to hit. I know a few here have tried to collect the funding fees before and it's more risky than anything, especially because so much of the funding rate is canceled out by fees. Plus most of the "free" money is canceled out by other traders/bots trying to do the same thing.

The rate usually settles down over 3 or 4 periods rather than all in one go- at least that's what it did last time we were at this range and funding rate was at a ridiculous 0.3%. I've accumulated about 1.6% from holding swaps for a week now and most.of that was in the first few days. if I continue to hold and get these next two periods that'll be a ridiculous 2.3% 

But I really haven't watched carefully enough during high rate periods to be able to say definitively

/u/fuckharvey probably has more experience with swaps than I do
> In a case like this where there's such a massive fee, wouldn't there just be an overwhelming surge of shorts opening and longs closing just as the fee is set to be paid? 

Their recent spam newsletter even outlined a strategy on how to do this.  Here's the most relevant part:

> Last September I presented a simple mean reversion funding strategy. If funding is high in positive terms, short XBTUSD right before funding is charged. Receive the funding payment, then cover the short position 8 hours later. If the funding is high in negative terms, go long XBTUSD right before funding is charged. Receive the funding payment, then close the long position 8 hours later. Depending on your criteria for when you put on this trade, there is a historically positive profit.

How would you arbitrage a perpetual swap contract?
Yes I'd rather get pushed out of the way than close this prematurely. The funding rates are wonderful, too. I'm technically still up, I only am down past about $9750 on finex. 
ugh. im confused.  skip it.

Well that’s the *premium* prior to the interest rate adjustment: 
You can earn 0.3084% though, so it’s a sweet deal.  
I’m definitely grabbing it. 
To the media? Lol! The American mainstream media? Lmao!
We could still be in a downtrend here, a la 2014.
No they didn't say it back then.
***This*** right here is the future. A global currency which has true value because it is adopted worldwide. 
You are thinking about the right things.  And $10B isn't chump change... so yeah if you think there won't be $10B flowing in over the next couple of years you should lean bearish at least until the halvening...

What if you think over the months between now and the next halvening there might be an extra $100B inflow?

$100 Billion USD is a lot of money!  It would take 10 Million people buying $10K worth to see that happen... I could imagine that personally....  It would take 100 Million people buying $1K worth.... actually seems less likely in the short run, but very likely over a longer period of time...  It would take 100 funds, banks, institutions investing an average of $1B.... not hard for me to imagine.

I guess it just really depends on how big the pool of money is which you expect to see bitcoin draw from.  There is a lot of money in the world and they print more everyday.  Bitcoin doesn't need to attract much honestly, even with the existing inflation.  If it is relevant in the world's financial picture, it's still cheap.
Thank you!
I'm not going to say when the bitcoin bubble will pop, but I am convinced that it's the MySpace of cryptocurrency.

When we see a real stock market crash and there is a global recession: that's when I think bitcoin will die.
I'll buy them off you for 0.02
I doubt you would buy them all at 0.01 if they were essentially worthless.  That would still be a lot of money to throw away.

At 0.000000000001, I would perhaps buy them all.
And the bitcoin whales will be what? Benevolent? Not to speak of the fact that 1000 people/entities own most coins. They will fuck us too. It's a jungle brother... Make money, live well, and take it as it comes. 
The masses will never learn.  They don't have brains that are capable of such.  Trump's 40% approval rating speaks volumes.
Yeap, agree. Not on the hours part though.. This takes time. In my monthly I marked somewhere between august - september, let's see. Anyway looking at the monthly log chart all this looks like a small correction for now!
Huh... wary then, didnt ever pick up that there was a difference until you pointed it out. I would certainly be tired  of trading if we go back into parabolic mode  so quickly though
Corrected
We've had high shorts in the past and gone down though and a short squeeze is more risky the higher we go. Eitherway no one really knows until we go definitively in either direction.
Thanks for clarifying, now I understand what you mean.

I usually consider BTCEUR to be reasonably close to BTCUSD on Kraken for my initial buying.

However, for trading I agree that the liquidity of BTCEUR is much lower than BTCUSD, and Kraken is already the most liquid market for BTCEUR. That's why I trade BTCUSD after buying in via BTCEUR.
> I meant that EURUSD is extremly volatile

Which is great if you have a lucky limit order in when those low-liquidity spikes hit
Yes, thats how it worked for me. Maybe test it on a small loan first to ensure yourself that it works like this.
My bearish scenario entry price is even 50% below 8200, i think 8200 is a very reasonable short term price, we are still in a bear market.
Agreed, "textbook" was being thrown around pretty liberally 
Yep, I aimed a little bit higher than you (9500) with a limit sell on GDAX and am still waiting for it to play out. 
:o 

shorting btc is a ponzi scheme 
61.8 FIB retrace of 11.8 to 6.4

yes fib 0.618  of the retrace from 11.8 to 6.4.

zoomed out : https://www.tradingview.com/x/f1T8Axk7/
ETH is up almost 100% on the ratio over the past month-ish. 
Well yeah we all said that in January and then look what happened lol 
So you read what I said, but dont understand it, interesting. Was there a question in there?
You'll only see a huge correction if there's one with BTC. That being said, I disagree with the statement about ath's. They aren't near them, a few sure, but the majority are around 40% of their ath which is correctly in line with the current BTC price.
Fundamental: It is a minor global currency, with a monetary policy that can not be manipulated through politics of national governments.

Whether or not those attributes are enough to make it valuable to people is what is unknown.

The other other fundamentals BTC does NOT have is true privacy and fungibility - attributes that are usually valuable.

The privacy coins (with Monero as currently the one with the most established credentials) should gradually get revalued upwards based on these fundamental attributes.  Something to watch.

BTC is like Oracle or IBM of cryptos.  boring, slow  and stable but no one really likes i
What alt is better than bitcoin?
Don’t be such a cynic...it’ll get you at least a 1000 sq/ft apartment in a 2nd tier city. 
Completely agree. I think its a good trade but its notoriously difficult to predict tops on this beast
thats a huge assumption. plus OP even stated himself that hes only been doing TA for 2 months according to his history
I wouldn't mind if I'd buy then, but I didn't like a lot people here :-P
https://www.tradingview.com/x/TrMWTISp/

Just drew these not sure if it has meaning...

What would this be considered? A descending triangle ? 

Or nothing at all 
6 hours to move up $500? Not long ago we were doing the same in 6 minutes
Yeah that's a fair point, but the premiums could rise and liquidate you before correcting and resetting. 
> When did futures switch over to having a premium after the initial drop to $6k?

Looks like around Feb 11th, when we were starting to breakout from low 8Ks. So like a week after the bottom.

Josh Olsewicz has a nice TradingView script that tracks the differences between spot and various futures over time. I haven't used it myself but if I were more setup on TV, I would definitely be keeping an eye on that. Very nice visualization.


you in any positions rn sloppy? holding my long from 9040 rn
Couple days ago?
Even June.
Wouldn't worry too much. If it goes up there's always an opportunity to re-assess the situation and 10%+ chop will always be there to hop back in. 

Ah, considering the lack of sun thought the odds were there. Enjoy the northern European sun!
It felt pretty convincing with Bitfinex going up to $9875.  But could be a bull trap, of course.
Or what I like to call...February.  
It's like /r/CryptoCurrency, but opposite.
I've been long from $8,770 for awhile now. No plans to close it anytime soon. 

And I generally stick to Bitmex's quarterly futures contracts.
$10,000 is a psychological barrier because it is a whole number. The "real" resistance point is $9,800. 
Ouch, that was a nice position.  No revenge trading or greed!  All the profits I took today only paid for my fuckup from a few days ago.  No "big one" for me.
good for you, bud. many of my friends don't even know that you can download e-books/audio-books FOR FREE from many public libraries. 
I agree. Like I said in my symmetrical triangle post, this has the potential to reach 10600 before a pullback  (0.786 fib level).Hopefully we get there and then consolidate above 10k. I'm starting to get excited!
Someone just fat fingered past 9.6k. I'm grabbing the popcorn.
I can't even remember all of them haha. I think we went from H&S to Double Top to Barts to A&E bottom/Wedges to this? We could always just make up a new formation like barts.
Yes, I know what divergence looks like. But what if in 4 hours the current daily candle is green? Then your divergence is gone.

I'd say the same for that hidden bear div. Until we've made a decisive local high on the daily time frame, I'd say at this point closing below 8.6k, I'm ignoring that hidden bear div.

Trade your time frame. Don't make a daily formation call based on a 15 minute candle. That's not to say you can't hop on earlier, I mean there's bear divs on pretty much every time frame, but who knows which ones have played out and which are going to keep going and which are going to end up not being confirmed. That's the tricky part.

And regardless, it still didn't *cause* the dip. The bear div currently visible *resulted* from the dip.
> Isn’t that exactly what a bubble is? Is Bitcoin just always going to be in a constant state of bubbles (positive and negative)?

I don't know, that sounds like most markets, but BTC is certainly severe and very rapid.

I expect it to be severe at least for the coming years.
So your disappointed with a 66% percent drop when alts went to 80% and 90%.......seems pretty deep to me. Almost $200B wiped off the books. 
I think you mostly think that because BTC is one of the biggest (due to its global nature) bubbles ever. I love BTC too but what I love even more is the insight into the markets. That is incredibly precious knowledge and I am glad to be able to exploit and witness something like that.

Due to the rarity of these kinds of financial wonders it seems strange. And I think that is why we are all somewhat confused.
Disagree completely, but to each their own.
I said they never do though. Alts go up when BTC doesn't. When BTC goes up the alts go down. This happens every time. That's why I'm not sure what you are talking about.
ya I don't know if this thing is gonna give anyone a pullback 
[deleted]
Aaaand RIP.
You got liquidated.  And it's still very possible BTC retraces well below your entry again (anything in this market is possible) and now you have less BTC overall.  Not a smart trade my dude. 
Shorting below the 9700 resistance is reckless
That's good
Yeah I actually wasn't paying so much attention when I read your comment. I just read short 50x 1.5% portfolio. But for hedging now that I think about I, sounds like a solid idea. Good luck on the long mate!
Cause the mempool was so filled that you couldn't transfer to exploit arbitrage. 
Yeah it's actually wild to think about now.. We've all gotten used to incredibly tight spreads but...Gdax hit $19.2k when finex hit $17.2k lmao

it's just cause theres ample time to arb now and arb bots and bank setups have probably gotten more efficient 
I think it's because alts are pumping and people are using btc to get in and out. Btc slowly creeping up is due to btc being the on ramp to lots of alts. 


$70 is a lot now but compared to before it's actually quite small 

Also apologies for my comment earlier. 
The arbitrage opportunity occurred because of tether FUD. If you don't believe that USD is equal to USDT, you're not going to arbitrage. At that time people were worried, hence the premium for buying BTC with tether.
I meant gdax at the start. Hehe, good catch 😄
the binance price is in bitfinex funbux 
Like me, hard to resist FOMO'ing... Even more with Kraken @9610 right now...
The only people afraid of the price going up are stubborn bears in risk of liquidation from their $9,200 shorts. I've got my tarp and desalination kit to make most of the weather.
Saved this comment. 
Or because triple top?
I'd probably sell a bit at that point too, maybe like 10 percent of my stack. 
lol wut, are you saying we just finally surpassed the market cap when it was at $6500? 

it's not obvious because I don't pay attention to alts and the alt space is full of retards...? If you told me there's a coin called FuckYourMomGayCoin and it was worth $800 I'd only be slightly doubtful. I pretty much expect anything with alts 
testnet insurance very necessary

He’s also a condescending, egotistical asshole, definitely an explosive pile of  magical shit. 
I'm pretty sure you can find a lot of meanings in those words.

Ah and... bears also climb trees ;)
Bears eat beets.

And beets are red-ish.

Makes sense.
Can confirm, am smart person but a terrible trader. 
It doesn't offend me, it's just hard to tell if you're one of those guys that's actually mad that people short Bitcoin (they exist) or if you're just being colorful. 
Good insight, thanks.
The higher we get without people believing in reversal the more shorts will open.

But people are starting to believe. And this may end up in long squeeze.
No
I don't know, were you paying attention at the first spike down to $5800, or the 2nd slog through the mid 6000's? I didn't see much optimism.
You can be a bearish holder. Bears beleive the price will go down. Bulls beleive the price will go up. So you are a bear, even if you sent acting on it.
Op plz
You've never heard the phrase "bulls take the stairs bears take the window"???

I get that this market is manipulated but really, that wasn't particularly surprising. 
Yes we were talking the daily candle from today, not yesterday or a week ago.
I have no problem with bulls or bears but this guy spins any event or topic into bearish nonsense. Calls everything manipulation, says the top is in, says it won't go over 10K, that the bubble has popped, etc. It's just unfounded and obnoxious.
Then enlighten me.
Yes maybe I should set some stops on Bitmex.  I usually use mental stops, but that exchange is not reliable with getting an order through during times of heavy volume.  My liquidation price is well over $10K, so I should be ok.
I'm UK and it's ok again now. You can all relax. 
Lol wasn't talking to you but thats funny 
I didn't say most countries.  And doubtful Tether is backed by real USD, regardless of whether it is illegal beyond that.

Anyway why do we care what "flibbr" says on the matter?
fearmongering and sensationalizing like this is wrong though. he's making it seem like this has any authority in the greater market. like why even make that post? what's the incentive?
you're absolutely fearmongering, he's not even blatantly saying its illegal. not even that but its pretty obvious that if tether imploded the market would absolutely tank. its math, not a conspiracy. i dont understand the point of your post. its blatant sensationalism.
those are unproven assertions. Tether doesn't even sell to individuals KYC doesn't apply rofl.
I don’t care what they’ve said in a chat room, people admit to conduct.  They can’t admit to whether  conduct is illegal.  Assuming everything you’ve said is true (which I doubt it is) I have no idea whether American banking laws apply to a Hong Kong crypto currency exchange and neither do you.  

But even if it does apply, and even if they’ve violated the law, that wont lead to the conclusion you so clearly hope for.  It will lead to a fine.  It doesn’t make their business illegal.  Sorry to burst your dreams.  

Oh lol ty, just checked his history xD
oof

I get your point about TA, really, I do. The amount of random lines people draw and put faith in is kind of ridiculous. Of course some are useful, but most are noise.

But the rest of your comments are just garbage tier. go to the bitmex trollbox, it's more for that kind of stuff 
Should of asked your mom for more money 
Treat others like you want to be treated
I'd argue that's a bit arbitrary though, as there's a tremendous gap in price/time between the first point on the line at $11,700 and the 2nd/3rd points at $9,700 and $9,450. 

I don't think that resistance line will have any significant impact on price in the short, medium, or long term. 
Oh, that's 100% exactly what's going on here. But as far as BTC is concerned, I'm of the opinion that it's gearing up for another leg of the bubble (past $20K) in the next few months. Not at the top of another mini-bubble.
Lmao @ the salt. The second largest cryptocurrency that does everything bitcoin does better plus has way more features and way more developers on it has no business being at 700? Hah! Ooook. That may be true, but if that's true, then bitcoin has no business being at 9K. More like 1k because it's such a dumpster fire and the only thing it has going is first mover advantage. 
multi-sigs bro. Where is your rebuttal
funny, because I actually know how to use those shitcoins while all you can do is talk about their potential utility
There are something like 1600 altcoins.  Most alts are not up 100% for the month.
Wow that's incredible lol. Keep it up. 
Cool.. just be mindful that when we see these volatile candles after a big run up, it's usually better to scalp the bounces rather than enter a longer term position.

I'm expecting [something like this](https://www.tradingview.com/x/nBZRsMiX/).. but I will wait for the dust to settle before re-entering a trade.
This is disciplined investing. Good work.
I won't short at $10k exactly but wait for what seems like the peak of the fomo candle... it'll be real time

Right now we're rocking the biggest green 6hr candle since 4/12 when we broke from the $6k range, and so I think we'll see a pullback between now and $10k-ish


If I may ask: If I'm going to close my short I'm just going to post:

!short xbtusd close xxxx is that right?
Damn nice job!
It may not translate into crypto quite so well, but I think it's because longs are generally more robust because of their lower risk profile. Potential gain on a long is infinite, potential loss on a long is finite. The opposite is true for a short. With margin trading and liquidation points and stops, that becomes less of a factor. 
Upward price movement tends to be slow and steady, building momentum over time until a parabolic "blow-off top". Look at March-June 2017 for a perfect example. During the slow and steady phase, bears can build up shorts and as they go underwater slowly they can add margin over days/weeks and convince themselves it will drop. There comes a point when you have a bunch of shorts, literally all underwater, getting an epiphany that they are fucked, and they start closing. This is when it angles up and goes parabolic to the upside. The squeeze hinges on the prolonged slow and steady upward movement prior to the blow off, this initial phase allows the shorts to build and get underwater 100%. 

Longs generally do not get squeezed because downward movements are much faster. Longs either get liquidated right away or close in the negative out of panic. (Much easier psychologically to close a long during a very clear sudden crash than to close a short during choppy slow/steady up, when you are able to hold out hope that it will eventually drop for a long time)

On top of this, on the way down there will always be support levels that gaurantee some sort of bounces, while on the way up (if making new highs) there is no previous price history of resistance to stop the pump. This kind of creates the "infinite" upside and "limited" downside mentality, until new resistance is established. 
Simple math. The price can only go to 0. There is inherent value in somehting, then every % down gets harder. The price can raise indefinitely. YOu may not say "oh, but the value" but in a covering rally 0 is a HARD limit - regardless how much is sold, the price will never break it.

Also there are no short investors. Investors are long - so if the price goes down a lot, investor pressure is adding.
Because longs and hodlers are more often noob and dumb traders who will stubbornly hold on and take absurdly high losses.  People who short are more advanced and know how to get stopped out quickly.
BTC, unlike other coins, has a large percentage of coins in circulation in the hands of Hodlers who only want to buy dips.
With a long, loss is limited (unless you actually believe BTC will hit $0), and you can DCA / hold a position if need be until the market turns around.

Short = unlimited losses (up to your liquidation point)
it's just generally harder to squeeze longs in a parabolic asset. Btc has gone from $0 to $20000 in like 10 years, most people do not mind holding at a loss for a long time. 

It's easy to pump btc 100% very difficult to dump it 50% 
people cut their losses on shorts much sooner than longs
There have been numerous opportunities to accumulate significantly lower over the last month. A cascading dump at this point in the market will cue the double top "confirmation" and would likely be pretty catastrophic for 2018. Not to say that wouldn't give even more opportunities to enter lower, but at some point it may do more harm than good. 

Pure wild speculation on my part, but I think I'd want to give the market some FOMO/hope and not try to paint the most dire outcome possible at this critical juncture. 
BitMEX is not BTC and is a following price, not a leading price. 
No question about it, just find it hard to happen right now (unless we go sideways for a while). If it was me i would do it bellow resistance, like 9950 or so, because it would get amplified with longs taking profits and shorts opening.
Mostly just profit taking stops from longs open above 8800. And perhaps the FOMO longs opened above 9400. If there are hidden buy walls it could slow down enough for people to start buying the dip.
It would be more effective if price could be lowered to like 9500 and hold it there without rising, then dropping to bellow 9K. That first drop would lower the "buy the dip" mentality a bit
I actually used to do that lol, would google bitcoin price. Before I learned about charts and shit
You would hope. I'm a software engineer and I didn't even read the white paper before buying. 

I read it after it crashed LMAO

You'd be surprised how financially irresponsible people are, especially in this space. I mean you really shouldn't be surprised given the enormous swings we see
I was being a bit rhetorical, my point was that someone who buys off coinbase is just as much an owner as anyone else. It seemed like you were ragging on people just cus they bought off coinbase for some reason, but if you're talking about private keys, then I see your point.
Shorting tends to have more dramatic targets. 4k, 3k, 2k etc. Shorts usually go big
that's wc3 :p

but man I can hear the peon in my head 
To an extent yes. But there’s definitely a big difference when playing with in game coins and you’re own money. In game you’re willing to take more risks and sit on things longer ( position’s in BTC ). 

WoW gold trading taught me more about any market than my Macro/Micro Econ classes did in college 
I see, makes sense if it's a hedge. 
Except bear markets following bubbles last years, not 3 months.
Seriously...the North Korean Won is more stable than BTC.  
> We've gone up 40% in a month. I think you've overdosed on altcoin market and become desensitized. 

This may be true. My journey started in November though.
uncannily, i'd have to agree with the guy. it is stable. 
Scam or not, the US fed will never allow Tether to exist long term. It isn't - for me - a question of "if" only a question of "when". Thankfully the US govt is even close to operating at anything near functionality. 

Edit "isn't" 
Which can also be applied to bitcoin. 
Just gonna sit on my hands. Will not overtrade 
That's why I said 'could'. They came back with money to invest.

I don't know the story of Reddit but I know a lot of companies that wouldn't exist with original owners cause in the end somebody has to pay for servers.
Of course they would prefer lower price than higher, but they don't seem to care that much if the price goes higher, because they will say it is pure speculation and "greater fool" in action.  And also of course the real "hodlers" haven't profited at all if they haven't sold any.   I'm sure many former holders sold above $10K though and are long gone.


for science... I mean analytics 
No.
Or buy a bot. :)
I hope the guy I made that comment to closed his short in profit. 
$108. you read it wrong 
Thanks! 
Thanks!
Gah, how did that slip my mind to split it up like that.

Thanks for the reminder, think I'll go 50/50, for net profit.  If a fakeout takes that 50 and we breakout, I should be able to find a good signal at some point to reenter it higher.
We have a place to argue the **opinion** you are sharing. I'm not going to referee over it, either. It doesn't belong here because it complicates enforcing our rules consistently.
Volume seemed to be lower than it has been, but I dug into it and it seems pretty average at least for the last 30 days, BGD aside. Liquidity feels stupid low, though. Someone sneezes and GDAX drops $100. 
Ya, $10K has never posed any sort of problem. 

$9,800, on the other hand, was a major hurdle following both rejections at $11,700 as well as the pump following the breakout of the log resistance line when the market jumped from $8,500 to $9,750. 
11.8k and 13k for me personally before I strap in fully again, but yeah, I feel ya
I disagree with that statement, but there's absolutely validity to horizontal support/resistance zone. 
No, that would make me extremely bear-biased and not let me sleep :)
congratulations, that's called a cycle

rofl jeez permabears sound ridiculous.
Not at all. Moon is when other assets are denominated in BTC value. Tens of trillions of dollar market cap, at the very least. Replacement of previous metals markets.

We all get it though, you're a permabear.
Moon is relative 
Saw it. Cheers!
Sweet dreams, Aulico.  We shall revisit this subject in a fortnight.
It's ok to protect it, just trying to keep everything in check!
Yeah just looked it up. I think HVN and LVN are the better terms to use. VPVR sounded all funky. But I agree it will be harder to get through because of the HVN we have there.
I agree that the price has still room to move upwards, that's totally out of question. But skipping entire ranges out of Fomo is something to be mindful of even if we only revisit those ranges. A 120$ 15 min candle followed by a 20$ retrace does not scream slow and steady to me. It's simply a logical consequences - skipping ranges so that buyers have to open longs higher up and sellers see no reason to sell because we are advancing rapidly. While it isn't ending a cascade downwards right now there are two options:

We get into another parabolic advance (predicting 10400 here because of the weak but still present resistance at that level) and decline very fast. Or we trickle down a little slower now to regain strength around resistance turned support 9400-9500.   

I agree that critical mass hasn't been hit yet but it surely doesn't look incredibly fine either.
Are you calling a 5% pump on low volume the real deal? The market is bullish but it's not a very strong trend yet, retraces are to be expected.
Stoch RSI is always below 20, as it ranges between 0 and 1. Did you mean 0.2?
> With that news around the corner I'm surprised of the ETH pump and that **unkillable cockroaches like XMR suffered** 

What? XMR is awesome. You mean XRP?
Yeah, there has been a surprising lack of bad news or news in general lately...feel like we're overdue
True, but the fact of that matter is that almost all ICOs are created and sold in the interest of pumping and dumping. It's a game among traders and issuers and nothing more. In practice, this could be reworked to improve on the legacy model, but I can't see *how* without regulators stepping in.
Ah ok, that is what I am getting at, that makes sense.
Honestly I think Btc focused Alt discussion (for instance discussing how Eth or alts dumping extra hard with higher USD volume could be effecting BTC) should be allowed here. Mostly because when people that follow alts (like me) make those types of observations it's because we're interested in how more BTC centric people view it, and those people justifiably pretty much avoid the alt thread.

I agree cleaning up the alt thread could go a long way towards helping that too though. Every now and then there's a decent alt TA post or actual objective Alt fundamental discussion which I appreciate. And as it's really the only place to get some kind of level headed (if slightly BTC biased) PoV on Alt TA/mechanics/fundamentals I'd hate to see it go.
Ya, I actually agree with you, but thought it's important to keep in mind that this thing really can pump for weeks and weeks.
Indeed. Sweet.
Yeah I guess I'm still not used to the increased activity in here. 
fuckharvey didnt arb he just picked his shorts carefully and the funding fees added to his profits or bailed him out of losing positions.

its hard for any short to make money you gotta be a pro.

There's no way i'd try to arb bitmex the execution engine alone.. the fees, its not possible

Short swaps long futs.... your btc value stays (mostly) flat and you collect funding. 
Lol yes they did...at every major price level people would say the same thing you’re saying. BTC doesn’t “deserve” this level, it’s “overvalued”, etc
I hope so otherwise I have alot of explaining to do when the wife finds out how many dips ive bought up 
As long as it isn't created and distributed by a central government/bank
Yes, well 10B is needed for stabilizing current price + more is needed for the dumps of hodlers. But 10B inflow is not crazy to imagine; it is actually crazy to think less will flow in. 100B is a different thing and 100B would just stabilize 100K/BTC, if no dumps happen (ok if price jumped now to 100K which is not happening). But the dumps will happen if price spikes (even I will be selling small part at 50k+ and I hodl for many years), people will offload above 20K.

Also the depth of this 2018 dip is important for attracting the money. If we really saw the bottom, and I believe we did, then the btc volatility is not that bad and it will attract the money faster.
The masses not voting for Hillary indicate extreme wisdom.
disbelief is good for rallies off a bottom.. its called 'climbing the wall of worry'.  It's a bullish sign imho,


That works? I tried already but I can't sell BTC for USD.
Tested it small first, but now have done it on all the expensive loans. Works. Thank you so much. If only I had known about this earlier!
Hmm, I seem to have you tagged as "troll fud bear"
bro, even if the bear market isnt over, it's still better to participate and make some profits?
but still have a long way to go to ratio ATH
Well, good point. Nothing to counter that except for maybe a more positive sentiment since the short squeeze fest at 6.8k.
good point. still seems exaggerated 
I agree. But if you're not long then it's worth a shot.
That's enough to know what's double top. But I was just stating that if double top confirms then his target would be somewhere around the middle of a drop so it's not this unreal.
trading would be so much more fun if I bought before 2013. imagine sitting on 100+ coins. Would be really nice
a bit early to tell but it looks more like a bear flag now
If you are using a ton of margin like an idiot, yes. 
Thanks I'll look into that. I've been wanting to see it but TV seems to delete mex future historical data. idk why 
Still short. Exiting for sure at $9950 break, maybe earlier if it pushes really strong.. Funding rates too good not to wait for a pullback 
No the first time after $6k 
Look at the 1 min chart (sounds dumb but it will give you insight in which way we broke out). This simply is the order book being illiquid. We immediately retraced.
whats the downside of shorting bitmex futures? arent you essentially getting a free premium? I mean, why not buy bitcoin and short the futures? Isnt this arbitrage? (because the futures go down to index price when the expiration date arrives)
Yes, $10,000 it is a psychological barrier, which makes it a TA resistance point and very "real". 

Whether $10,000 or $9800 is more significant resistance right now is a matter of debate.  I agree with you that $9800 is more significant, but doesn't make $10,000 absolutely insignficant.
I fomoed in like a arsehole at 9536.

Shoulda have held my longs from 8906.

Our consolidation periods today are shorter than usual, if we breach 9.8k, all wheels forward baby
Also, this looks like it’s probably going to pain a second bullflag. 

Could be the pattern today 
Lol yeah I think you got it.

There's nothing wrong with people trying to learn though, naturally there will be lots of misapplications. Divergences are kind of confusing anyway. 


Ok, Ill agree alts got slaughtered
BTC still has the biggest network effect and could underperform every other top altcoin and still increase in value over the coming years.

Also it is easiest to regulate and trace, so it could benefit when many of the other coins are made effectively illegal.

But it is old, stale tech and just not looking great at the moment.  I am currently holding the smallest amount of BTC that I have in the last 5 years.
> When BTC goes up the alts go down. This happens every time.

But that's not true. Please open the BTCUSD chart and the BTC dominance chart of the last month side by side and examine how the dominance behaved during the BTC pumps. You'll see that alts haven't been responding negatively to those pumps - until today.
I took the long... going well so far lmao 
[deleted]
I was watching the market and I exited it prior to liquidation, and like I said, it was a hedge as I wasn't sure which way the market was going to move and I wanted some downside protection. Even though the trade was a loss it was still a net gain for my portfolio.
I'm not disagreeing just been too confident about a position before and gotten smoked. Anything can change in a heartbeat.

I'm not really in a position right now just holding old coins.
Ya, slow transfer plus major price volatility means risky arb
i appreciate the apology, thats mature of you. i should have been more articulate when i posted my original comment anyway. i dont really care much for the BTC market since my folio is all alts, so seeing the alt market pumping quite nicely definitely gets me excited. my folio just hit a ATH since the bottom so im in a decent mood. 

Should I be the first here to say that bitfinex doesn't trade USDT? 
even bitfinex shareholders swapman and flibbr admit tether is illegal tho so how is that FUD?

[proof here](https://i.redd.it/u9ztmsf2pdv01.png)
Lol that username.
I'm gonna cry tears of joy if we hit $12k. 


I just added all the reasons :p 

but yes, btc does strong trend reversals at triple bottoms and tops
He's saying the market cap is now the highest it's been since we bounced from 6.4k. Aka higher than it's been since BTC closed at like 9.7k.

So not nearly as significant as he's making it out to be. Still interesting how much higher the market cap is despite BTC being 5% lower I guess.
Only alt im holding is LTC. Their intention no to be the number one coin, but number two as the silver to bitcoins gold is genius. 
How low do you plan to ride that short bro

Indeed it could. It does sort of feel like the inverse of 6800-6400-6800-8000. I'll be hedging like mad at the 9750 double top
everyone here is euphoric from a $400 pump. 

I get where they're coming from but go read the dailies from a few weeks ago and you'll see people rescinding on their own word, predicting maximum pain and now believing  that this time is different.

I don't know why anyone expects btc to go straight down, that's never how a bubble pop works or happens.

If we surpass $12k and then $13k I will humbly concede and open my mind to new ATHs this year, until then I don't wanna be a chump. I can deal with having less bitcoin 

moon kids are returning, shit posting bulls are nearing capacity. just like all the buttcoiners coming in at $7k telling people to short the bottom, this thing will probably be obvious af and turn around at $11k again though 

alt coins are basically worthless and pumping to heaven right now, the bubble ain't done popping yet. If btc passes 60% ATH though I'll stfu 
why did it recover so fast then? Market sentiment can't have been that low if we recovered so quickly. 

Also i actually think the blood in the streets is just a good example of when to buy, but not necessarily when to think the trend has reversed. I think it's more likely boredom that will reverse the trend

Yes I have heard that phrase and really doesn't have much to do with that market action.

And no, it wasn't particularly surprising at all.  We see this sort of thing quite a bit.
I'm blaming Brexit
i don't give a shit who you were talking to, it's a public forum, PM if you only want answers from one person

When does the bubble pop then and how long will the following bear market last?
man, upvoted as it is most bullish comment today
username checks out

I put 2BTC into the crowd sale in 2015. Sold in June 2017

Plenty of salt to go around. For the margharitas bro... for the margharitas bro
And here is something ETH doesn't do better than Bitcoin:

Multi-sig addresses

Now go google what that is and find a rebuttal
You have said many times that 0% of them have any real world use and only Bitcoin does.  That is a very goofy assertion that most everyone here knows is absurd.
i honestly don’t follow the shit that floats to the bottom, just the top
I used to be a wholesaler for managed futures funds, so I am used to volatility.   One reason, given BTC's history, that I am not at all concerned about the current drawdown. I even have my Series 3, but have never traded.  I've just been doing the most basic trend following, the key is to not try and capture the whole movement, just bits and pieces of it.  I use this group to figure out best places to jump back in, and then move my stops up if it develops, I have a 50 stop from my entry point, so I limit my downside but am still able to capture most of the upward trend.  I was lazy when I first started having bought into the hype of BTC going to the stars, now I am really starting to enjoy paying attention and learning as much as I can. 
Only thing I am doing is going in and out of cash trailed by a $25 to $50 sell stop.  I thought scalping was playing a range?  Should have asked earlier. 
Thank you sir. 
Gotcha, I'm just thinking if $10k breaks we're gonna see $11k. low $10k has never been particularly strong resistance or support
Yes, thats it.
Until you use margin.

The truth is that longs are usually longer investments that can be driven underwater for some time, shorts are scalps or hedges.
Same is true of longs...with leverage it's the same as shorts. 

1x long (settled in btc) is the same as 2x short. both have liquidation points in proportion


1x long on bitmex has liqui at 50%, 2x short at 200%.

The real reason is that the market is generally bullish in bitcoin and people will hold underwater longs significantly longer and with more conviction 

Shorting...no guarantee bitcoin ever hits that price again. Longing...good chance you'll see the price again 
I would say right now it's exactly the opposite
Agreed. I was just answering a simple question.

Now the sentiment is more bullish than it was then. Pushing price down somewhere along the way to buy up dip is better when direction is chosen than buying it on the way down when we don't know where the bottom is.
I see some action that makes me swear some whales make moves just to stophunt there, using coins on other exchanges.   Odd candles.  But call me a conspiracy theorist.  I think this is a very trader heavy market right now.  Even the longs arent moonkids anymore, they're savvy fair weather longs.


they wait for volume to dry up.  It's an unstoppable move in an illiquid market.  Of course a lurking institutional or bullwhale can thawrt the play.


I bet that most people don't read an annual report before buying stock.  They like the company, track news and price, etc, but don't go heavily into detail.  It's normal.
do you think we might see bitcoin reach like $10 within the next 10 years? maybe it goes up from there\- who knows
Yeah all those peon soundbites will live on in my head for the rest of my life. I miss 4v4 in that game so much. Tanks and gryphons ftw. Never got into WoW.


You play wow? i know you play league.

Majority of my buddies left WoW for LoL 
I played Eve online for 3 years, i would to credit CCP Games for kickstarting my knowledge on scalping 0.01 trades. 
I dont know why people think anything about this is normal in any way shape or form.

This is still such an inflated bubble
I think 10 days or so maybe is not enough time :)
Plus we might see some real fireworks soon...
You're not exactly disproving his argument with that statement...
but more so to all the other garbage shitcoins out there.
Haha.  Yes, yes I did.  Apologies to OP.  Thought you were posting that you closed a short w/ a $10 differential.

Looking good so far. Yeah, I always forget you can set tiered stops too, don't feel too bad. I was going to bed last night trying to figure out where to set the stop, and I was like....oh. Duh. Stop(s). 
Alright, fair enough.

Ah I'm looking at bfx. They're clearly looking for fomo, not going to come this far without some fomo
I don't think $9800 is going to matter as much as the 200 day MA right now. I think that's the major line the market's figuring out whether to reject or break above currently (for the past ~10 days).
You can tweak those numbers (leverage,% stack) to match your stance. I personally go 10x 5% of stack. Either win 5% btc/ lose 5 % fiat or vice versa depending on where market moves.
If you see my comment history you will realise i'm long and i'm not perma nothing ;)
I guess we can agree to disagree about one thing: where we are on that cycle.
VPVR is the indicator style. It means it's a volume profile across the visible range of the chart.

A HVN is a volume outcropping/bulge in the VPVR (signifying high volume at that price point), a LVN is a volume valley/dimple in the VPVR (signifying the opposite).

They aren't the same as you use VPVR (or some other VP style) to find HVNs/LVNs, ya feel?
Different strokes, I suppose. Skipping ranges doesn't quite bother me since we've been testing these ranges a lot the past few days - over the weekend we reached the 9.5ks temporarily as well. Similar to the BGD - I don't really expect us to go retrace back to 7.5k just because we blew through the entire 7ks. We may, sure, but I'm not expecting it.

And the consolidation here is implying to me we aren't skipping it out of FOMO necessarily. If it was FOMO personally I don't think this consolidation would be occuring, we'd either be falling back or continuing to move up.

Also keep in mind skipping a 1-2% range that we've been in and around recently already is hardly a crazy large movement.

To me, there many more options than the two you mentioned. For one, we could continue consolidating within 9.6k (maybe revisiting 9.5ks briefly), markup to just below or above 10k, retrace back to find 9.7-9.8k as support, and then continue moving up. The point of us consolidating here is it's *not* a parabolic advance.
no lol just saying when BTC goes full bull 90% of people who sell will have to re enter higher 
XMR is awesome *because* it is a cockroach!  The harsher environment you put it in, the more it will be the one that thrives.   After WWIII there are only cockroaches and twinkies.
Given the upswing, I'd say we're due for some bad news.
Fully agreed.

And digitizing company shares in the traditional stock market would be a whole other beast to handle.  Room for a new platform I suppose.
BTC focused alt discussion is allowed. What is removed are, mostly, subjective assertions or veiled attempts to shill. I talk about eth and alts in this thread, if you want to see an example of the kind of thing that's allowed.
I agree with all of that.  I do think a rapid repricing higher at any point is possible though.  It's always seemed odd to me that didn't happen more often.  With the right news catalyst or proper competition between the right buyers (institutional FOMO) with the current liquidity on exchanges (very little) you could see a price melt up unexpectedly.
Why can't you sell your BTC for USD? You can do that e.g. on Kraken or (which I would advise if you want to do low-leverage trading with good liquidity) e.g. on Bitfinex, after sending your BTC there.
Don't feed the trolls.
Oh I know...I made a ETH/BTC trade at .9ish, rode it to .055, and am still holding BTC.  I actually made the decision to just hold the BTC to diversity my ETH holdings a little more.  I usually am around 90% ETH and wanted a little more BTC exposure...working great so far.  Hopefully I didn’t pick the only alt bull that doesn’t flow back to daddy.  
Well, not even necessarily liquidate you but they could rise a great deal and hit stops or just make you panic. Look back at mid December. The premium spiked to $3500. That did/would hit a lot of people who were short, I'm guessing.
Have no idea, not following mex lately.
A couple of things:

1. **Counter party risk:** you have to leave some amount of BTC on Bitmex in order to trade there, so there's always the risk that the exchange could be hacked, or your account targeted specifically.

2. **Liquidation:** if you short 1x then you have nothing to worry about and your account will never reach its liquidation point. But if you try to minimize counter party risk by shorting on leverage, you run the risk that your position will be liquidated. 

3. **Fees:** if you hold until settlement, there is a small fee to settle your position. Although it's negligible, it's worth mentioning. If you open your position with a market order, there's also a small fee that will eat into your profits. Same goes for the exchange you use to purchase your btc that you're using to hedge your short. 
A scenario where the market breaks $9,800 and bounces hard off $10,000 is certainly possible, but I find it incredibly unlikely. 

The market will confirm a double bottom breakout from $8,600 if $9,800 breaks, and simultaneously make a new local high. 

It's just not a likely scenario. 
Can't a rich person in here just go buy a little more Bitcoin to make it hit 10,000 so we can get past that point
Oh yeah definitely. I think *I* was the one to really start off the H&S memes lol and then went and got myself learned; I get where people are coming from. So I try not to come off as a dick when I'm critiquing TA, mostly just stay objective and comment on it (I do better at that sometimes more so than others). And still not claiming I'm crazy experienced in this market, but I'm pretty sure I have a decent handle on TA now at least.

[deleted]
Of course, nothing is certain.

I'm a hodler too, not trading at all
That's why I stick to alt/usd and alt/btc pairing arbitrage. Don't have to worry about transferring to another exchange. Always some good opportunities when alts pump.


Yeah I understand, and I was rude cause of something irl that irritated me, so yeah sorry about that  

And yeah, alts have been doing pretty well in general for a while now. I am curious to see what happens next with them, seeing as btc is just sitting still at an interesting price point 
FUD doesn't mean it's not true- it just means fear, uncertainty and doubt.

At least that's how I see it
sorry, when I said FUD, I didn't mean to say it was right or wrong, just that it was highest at that time.
you gotta admit the trolls have a good sense of humor lmao 

Bitfinex funbux 😂
It might be the lack of sleep but I’m honestly tearing up laughing
glad u liked it
Did it ever do a triple?
Idk man, getting bored of holding it lol. Funding rates aren't as nice anymore and this looks ready to break up. if it doesn't break up here soon after this alt pump I'll hold out longer though.

I'll probably close at $7800 at the lowest, maybe $8600-8800 if it looks like it wants to bounce again 
Dushman, my main squeeze! Back from your ban?
I like how you blame it on our reading comprehension instead of your writing. Also that's really not particularly surprising, maybe that's why we're all confused. Because it's not very interesting or unexpected and you wrote it like it is
It's not that remarkable. 9700 to 9200 is only a 5% difference and BTC dominance barely budged. 
/itradelikea4thgrader
Yeah. I was just genuinely not sure. The data point is definitely useful and valid. 
Don't think that bounce there will bring us much down. If this would want to drop we'd be already sub 9k hard.
I think at $13k, theres a good chance price might start to explode higher. But atm I'm just really cautious.
Uhhh yes it does....? it quite literally explains it. Go look at the overleveraged noobs on bitmex freaking out. There's a reason the price dumps like that. People who buy the top panic sell really easily 


This movement lately has been much more "organic" than a few weeks ago when we just barted around everywhere. it's incredibly refreshing compared to then. 
You're hilarious. Seriously though i don't care about what you have to say. 
"for one'...and that's probably the only reason.  And doesn't mean he has any special knowledge at all of what is going on behind the scenes .
seriously? swapman didn't even blatantly say tether is illegal. the guy above is completely inferring it through his own words. not even that but tether imploding would tank the market, absolutely. that's not even controversial. but i guess if it comes out of someone significant in the community all of a sudden its doomsday. its blatant manipulation by OP. that should be a bannable offense. so no, his interpretation of swapman's words isn't accurate. its sensationalist if anything.
Nothing in this article has any impact on what I said.  
You seriously need to do a better job explaining your point and exactly *HOW* Liberty Reserve is similar to Bitfinex. With sources to back up your argument.

Quoting a wikipedia article with zero explanation is not in any way adding to your argument.

>he said tether doesn't follow KYC on transfers.  

So? You say that's illegal. *How*? What laws are they violating?

>he said tether is a no-kyc paypal on the blockchain

What does that even mean? How is tether like paypal? It's a token. Not a company. Explain this.
That's an excellent question. And I have no freaking clue. 

However, one of the following is true:

1. The bubble already popped and the market is undergoing an extended bear cycle similar to 2014.

2. The bubble actually hasn't popped and the market action between $20K and $6K is just another run of the mill correction.

You and I both thought for awhile that we were in scenario # 1. And you may still feel this way. 

However, the market action we are currently seeing has a high potential for invalidating that scenario. Making a higher local high above $9,200 was pretty significant, and breaking above $11,700 would more or less put a nail in the "bear cycle" coffin. 

Well, if it's scenario #2, then the "blowoff top" to $20K could very well not have been been close to the actual blowoff top the market would see. $100K becomes plausible in scenario #2, although I'll be in an absolute state of disbelief if the market makes it even above $50K. 

You've shared great insight into the fact that the massive gains investors have in bitcoin are all on paper only. If there were ever a run on the bank, so to speak, then the whole market would collapse. 

So I'm not entirely sure how we could see $50K+ btc without simultaneously triggering a run on the banks...but I'd have said the same thing about $3,000+ btc if we were having this dicussion in the $400 to $780 range. 
I think he's just mentally adapting to the most profitable mindset he could have. if he's wrong, well, he's wrong and he will reassess. But if he's right, he'll be very right and it'll be extremely profitable. 

Just a few weeks ago he thought this was going to sub $4-5k and said it's possible we follow 2014 (which we still are) and now he is saying possible ATHs in a few months. 

I think it's just the trading "strong opinions weakly held" mantra. If we get rejected from $11-12k hard again I imagine he will go back to being a bear again 


Its a hyperbole. Im a technical person, Im not good at communication ;)
You can scalp in a range or in a formation like a bounce... it usually refers to a trade on a smaller time horizon and thus a smaller win in nominal terms

Nothing wrong with trading here if you feel comfortable with it ... my comment was more about building a long position for the next run (assuming things continue bullish)

Best of luck!
I don't agree...we've been in an uptrend since $8800 and now have a $500 6hr candle.. this won't go straight to $11k IMO

In any case I closed my position as this isn't falling off a cliff... will re-eval opening another short if we fail again to break $9750
Every person who shorts has it in their mind that bitcoin may never go below a certain price again. When people long, they are generally under the assumption that bitcoin will very likely be above that price at some point in the future. That's the main reason 

People are hesitant to hold an underwater short on a parabolic asset 
Sure but there's a difference between that and buying bitcoin and understanding almost none of it. 
I played custom games so much. Tower defense! wc3 paved the way for so many types of games that are insanely popular today...tower defense, moba, eventually mmorpg
WoW was absolutely amazing. They are actually releasing a updated Vanilla version of WoW in the near future where it will bring back everything from the Original WoW, simple remake with some twists. 
I played league more years ago. Been playing fortnite lately like a true FOMO pleb. I FOMO into the most popular games :p I played overwatch from like sep-mardh 2017-2018 haha.

I was diamond 1 in season 3 for league tho :D

I never played wow. Dad wouldn't let me, said I'd get addicted. I'm pretty thankful for it now lol 
They're bagholders refusing to take a loss. The problem is that in a normal market, people would simply go elsewhere once they cashed out. Most of the people who cashed out in December, poured their money back in.

Everyone's trying to game the market and not very many are actually trying to *use* these coins as actual currency. So you have money pouring in without any fundamentals changing.
Nope, rather generalizing confirmation bias. I'm not taking sides here in a bitcoin vs altcoin discussion
Correct. But its the buyers perspective that matters in a speculative market.
No worries :p 
Yes I know, no probs high volume VPVR node is a complete valid way to say HVN. I just felt like HVN and LVN are easier on the tongue. 
>And the consolidation here is implying to me we aren't skipping it out of FOMO necessarily.

I partly agree with this not being entirely due to fomo but volume is slightly higher and being right below the resistance line of course makes the market a little more indecisive and hampers fomo.

I hardly agree though that we are consolidating much. When had our parabolic advance we did consolidate quiet a bit too. The range was a tad bigger that I will give you. Bull flags are often accompanied by consolidation. If enough break up though I'd argue that we are witnessing a parabolic rise.

It's not too crazy skipping ranges we have already been too. But we're skipping ranges in the upper range of our bigger range (sry for using range so often. What I mean here is 8650-9750)
This seems quiet fomoish.

Of course there are not only two options. But I can't imagine the market breaking out through 9.8k and then not dropping like a stone after 10k is rejected or not advancing like crazy if 10k is broken.

I see we have different opinions. But I quiet enjoyed hearing yours and it helped me learn about a new indicator as well as learning a little bit more about divergences. Thank you for that. 
Indeed, don't fight the trend, and potential lost profits when there's a retrace, while emotionally disturbing can quickly turn into less profit than holding a winning position. I move stops below broken resistances turned supports as it goes up, takes some patience and keeping greed in check
Oh, I see. Still not exactly a term of endearment but I get your point.
Okay good to hear. I've seen it talked about a few times but I've also seen discussions I thought were BTC centric removed (but maybe I wasn't reading them close enough).
Yes I agree as well, but telling it here is almost a heresy. People tend to think 500, 1000 USD move is crazy. It is really miraculous that bitcoin is that much stable at this point of undervaluation vs. profit taking.

Market itself has more self-stabilizing factors than I thought.
I would use BFX, but I really feel safer with a compliant exchange. My performance at BFX was sooooo much better too. I really don't know why I can't exchange BTC for USD.
Indeed. The trick is to never be net short ;). I have a much smaller trading stack than holding stack.
I think it would have been better if I asked "Why do people pay a premium on bitcoin futures?" I know you have to pay funding if you long it in XBTUSD but sometimes you get funding as well. So funding changes in the long run.

Also, there are other websites that let you long btc.

Whats so special about paying a premium for futures since there are so many alternatives available?
I still think good chance $10K will offer strong resistance, but maybe you are right that the pent up energy from $9800 break will just slingshot it past there.

I certainly did not expect this kind of strength at the $9700 area.
What do you think of this movement man
[deleted]
honestly i think actual fud is people spreading false stories/false information to trigger panic selling

if you spread information that is true and provide evidence/screenshots that are not faked.... its not FUD
its impossible to arb risk tether because the tether collapse will be sudden and instantaneous 

they maintain the price peg with kraken allowing them (bitfinex) to wash trade the price and keep it 1 dollar or around that no matter how much someone tries to sell 


thats why kraken defied the ny state ag and then claimed 'people dont care about market manipulation'


well i call it bitfinex funbux because even shareholders in bitfinex admit tethers are illegal and could be seized at any moment
[proof](https://i.redd.it/u9ztmsf2pdv01.png)
Triple bottom in 2015 yes. Triple top idk.. In 2014 I think it hit ~57% ATH three times before going down for good 
You still so bearish?
Yeah, was he not there in December when we went from $300B-$450B in like two days? Now that was impressive. 
[deleted]
Definitely. if it happens I'll be super excited. I'm making sure to not get liquidated in the process :) 

But there's a lot of room between here and there and resistance upwards is only going to get stronger. 
It was a quick spike upwards followed quickly by an even bigger dump.  Both were likely 95% manipulated moves....painting the tape.
and yet you keep responding
the inference comes from the activity being banned in certain places - i.e. countries such as India, or states such as New York - but the lack of KYC still permits the flow of money into these regions.

i see how you can argue it, but calling for him to be banned is fucking absurd and makes you look bad, not him. aren't we all in crypto because we are fighting for freedom, not against it? we can win on facts, not censorship.
There was a massive growth at Nitrogen when the CSGO skin economy took a hit in August 2016. The account numbers jumped over 100% in under 4 months. Esports betting shifted into the crypto space, bringing with it a lot of commerce. That is pretty much what accounted for the massive uptick that held us up into the low $1000's. From there, it was the failure of the ETF and money flooding into alts which really put fuel on the fire to move the bubble along.

Once SegWit went through, the gates opened up and hoarding skyrocketed. Throw in more dumbass money coming in and everything went retarded fast.

Unfortunately the sports betting markets haven't really grown more. The markets I've seen grow are financial speculation. Those have just skyrocketed but the fundamentals haven't seem to change at all.
The chart shows pretty clearly that the "bubble popped".  Down 70% in a few weeks after a fast exponential runup is textbook bubble pop.

Whether the bubble deflates further or whether the price recovers more doesn't change anything in the past.
If we think of BTC as store of value, then I don't see why a run on the banks would be triggered.
This is fairly accurate. 

If the market were still on the south side of the log resistance line, then I'd absolutely still be calling for $3K BTC. 

If it drops below it again, I'll resume that mindset. 

But for now, there's simply no reason to be so bearish. Quite the contrary.
[deleted]
Oh I don't think it'll go straight to $11k, I just think $11k is a fairly sure thing past, say, $9950. 

If you're just shorting for a pullback before riding it up to $11k then I get that. I just think there isn't much  resistance between $9900 and, say, $10.8k is all. 

Also yeah, I don't know if it's going to pullback, but to be fair this is basically exactly what it did last time we were here. It was hours of sideways before moving down 
We've been in an uptrend since 6600 a few weeks ago. Is ADHD around here epidemic or something? Sometimes it pays to zoom out a bit.
I just liked the standard 4v4 matches. I was never really good enough to compete 1v1. I really liked just working alongside and relying on some better players to micro. I just followed whatever basic strategy fit with the rest of the team and sent my units to the right place, never learned micro or keyboard shortcuts that well. That feeling when the tides start to turn and you know you're going to win is quite addicting. 

Similar to playing monopoly (which most people seem to hate) and getting a few monopolies on the last 2 streets. You know you're going to win and everyone else has to just suffer through the remainder of the game. 

Quite the sadistic pleasure can be derived from either game.
I've only seen people play it and it sap up a lot of their time so I was wary to try it out. 

Also, I was pretty pissed that WoW supplanted the original Warcraft games and is likely the reason we never saw WC4, though I heard that WC4 is in the works. It's about time. SC2 is too complicated and fast for me. I need my WC3 fix but the servers are pretty much dead, I think.
And? Some of us are making good money knowing its not a traditional market, while permabears are whinin0g on the sideline its not a traditional market and btc should be at 1k a coin. Ya its mostly all speculation, ride it while you can amd stop cying about it cuz you cant stick to only shorting. 
not really, itms liquidity. because a sellers perspective can be a lot more important than a buyer’s when the liquidity is trash
Hey we aren't done disagreeing yet! But yeah I always appreciate different viewpoints (especially with decent rational discussion) and don't think either of us are too far off the mark. Personally I don't view 10k with nearly the same importance - historically it's been 9.8k (given the HVN) that has been the major sticking point. Also remember how many times we've ghosted above and below 10k in the past; consolidation there (upper 9ks, lower 10ks) could certainly play out with 9.8k as support even if we blow past it initially.

I made two pictures in paint to illustrate why I view this rise, even given the more rapid markup from 9.2 to 9.7, as more sustainable: https://imgur.com/a/lsGM6vC
It has already suffered so much, but the core values have not been violated (and cannot be?)
If subtext in the post amounts to shilling I'll remove and ban(1 day). I see a fair amount of shilling. Maybe 1 - 2 posts a day have a reasonable case to contest my decision. I'm prone to often reversing my decision when I see even a semi lucid argument. It's inherently messy and subjective and I make mistakes.
Seems like the market is inherently stable and growing when you ignore the periods of FOMO every year. 
bingo.  only short to hedge.  long term bitcoin goes to 1 mil +.  Almost all shorters are bitcoin bulls who are just trying to 'get ahead' in the bitcoin world and the only way to net more coins is to scoops a few on the dips with shorts.



Yeah, for real.
Unless the premium is ridiculously inflated, it's usually far cheaper to keep a long position open on futures than it is on a site like Bitfinex, for example. 

For example, yesterday the premium for the September contracts was approximately $200. With 150 days until the contracts settle, the effective funding rate for that period is .0138% per day. 

Compared to Bitfinex, which yesterday had a USD daily funding rate of about .09%, you'd pay about 6.5x less funding by longing the September futures and holding it for 150 days vs. longing on Bitfinex and holding it for 150 days.
Bullish as hell mate. 
I agree, this does not seem possible.
not as much as before. Thought about it quite a bit and decided that things are a little more complicated than I made them seem. But honestly idk, this is also exactly what I basically said would happen if we followed 2014 charts lol. People start believing again during the summer.

I'm basically waiting for another test of $12k to make up my mind. or a drop below $6k


It's not that surprising, or you have no concept of percentages. And you seem overly excitable. 
I'm as (reasonably) bearish as folks get around here, and even I think that was normal market action. Stairs up, elevator down and all.

Get a dozen people in a room and have them trade cotton balls for cash, and the charts of that action will look similar. It's just psychology (fear, greed, etc.) and its cyclical.
Hmm. I see it more as a failed push. Sellers always fall over themselves to get out near the top of a range. The super slow climb almost always results in a sell off. It's just a matter of when 
im not literally saying he should be banned... i was being half serious obviously. right, and you literally just confirmed what i said. he said tether was straight up illegal. its not even close to that and its legal gray area is limited to handful of contexts. 

his post was obnoxiously alarmist. we should also, as a community, stand up to people spreading misinformation or trying to manipulate sentiment by spreading fear. i mean he literally was implying that a key figure head of tether is saying that tether is illegal and was fearmongering that there was a significant chance tether is going to collapse and destroy the market. its ridiculous. 

it doesnt make me look bad, its my opinion. im sick of the sensationalism.
The perceived “fundamentals” in the space are also laughable. Everyone talks about what you can/could do with this technology, but no one realizes that there are far more efficient ways tl achieve the same use case. It’s all: Shitcoin XYZ allows for THIS use case, when in fact, you can do the same use case a number of ways. But oh well, guess we have to endure another shitcoin summer
Eventually, people need to do things with the value they're storing. 

Buy houses. Send their kids to college. Pay medical bills. Take vacations. Retire and buy food, clothes, and other common necessities when their monthly source of income (job) is gone. 

Also, when your store of value starts rapidly depreciating, most logical people would considering selling said store of value and moving to a safer haven. 
Actually today we'd be pretty much exactly right where we are. 

And yes, $12k is my flip switch :) 
Yeah agreed... lots of air above $10k... my comment was time boxed... as in, if we hit $10k in the next hour, I have a hard time seeing it hit $11k a few hours later
What is your point?
Last time I checked most of you are just "increasing your stack" but likely haven't sold more than 5% of it.

Paper wealth is meaningless until you move it to other assets. Everyone is just playing this game of who can get the most paper wealth without actually concerning themselves with "what happens if it crashes tomorrow".

At least with many stocks, you have dividends and voting rights with your shares. You have none of that with crypto. Just a number on a screen.
For every seller there is a buyer, and we are seeing more and more liquidity in the alts, institutional buyers portfolio are getting their fair share of alts. It's a new emerging market, BTC is the flagship but not the only one in the fleet. I see 2018 begining a paradigm shift in the cryptoverse, I've not been in this space as long as most of you guys but my perspective is less affected by old biases IMO. I'm not dismissing the importance of Bitcoin, but also cannot dismiss the alts as garbage as easily as you do.
I see what you mean. One side is pure BGD and the other is an well advance lol.  What I referred to with consolidation is the range between 9200-9350. We clearly did consolidate quiet a lot there even though it was no mans land. 

What I will not give you is the comparison with the 7k BGD. There was clearly more accumulation and a lot more leveraged shorts opened in the 6k range and also a mid term resistance line that we broke. Comparing that situation to this one isn't as fair I would say. If we only look at candles though AS MUCH AS IT PAINS ME YOU ARE RIGHT (DON'T SCREENSHOT THIS). But it wouldn't suprise me to find another example on the chart that proves the opposite too.

I think the better argument in your favor is that we are consolidating in a usually volatile range after a pump which favors a bull flag outcome, which gives the impression of more stability and upside yes. 

The importance I am given to 10k is the same I have given 5k in october. The public WILL react to this. And the public does not use TA that much.

I am pretty new to TA in general and enjoy being taken somewhat seriously so thank you for that. Also ever thought about becoming an artist? These microsoft paint skills are beyond even god.
What do you mean?
Yep, definitely appreciate the work you mods put in here keeping the discussion clean. I'm sure that's crazy annoying especially in the crypto space. If I came across as complaining about you removing good discussions sorry that wasn't my intention, I trust your's and other mod's judgement.
Yes, without the fomo and corrections it is really very nice parabolic curve.

Also is interesting that difficulty more than doubled during this year (so also from the time where we were at this price level). Mining now must be with very low profit => miners really do not like to sell now.
Hmmm I guess that makes bitmex better than the alternatives.

However, it does beg the question about XBTUSD vs futures. If its cheaper to long futures then why not long futures and short XBTUSD (and collect funding)?
Yup, hard range here but doesn't mean you can't take some scalps on the way.
It wasn't stairs up.  It was rocketship up.
Yes we were both watching the same market and we can agree to disagree on the dynamics behind it.  You think it was a total coincidence that happened right as the daily candle closed and I think the odds are very high that it wasn't. 
Pretty much every coin just offers a decentralized version of centralized stuff we *already* have. The centralized stuff is supported with ad revenue and/or investor money.

I'm just waiting for people to realize these decentralized services are *not* profitable. Steemit has no ads and people are getting "paid" cause other people are pouring money in to hoard the coins. Except that's gotta stop at some point. Need donations? Patreon does that already for content creators.

Just wanna do blog posts? Medium already offers all of this and it's free (supported by investor money).
That's definitely fair, think we agree then. I usually agree with your comments anyway!
I think a lot of permabulls learned their lesson to take some after the last drop.  I luckily took some at 18k and comfortable about it, I don't want to chance my whole stack on trying to time the bottom.   A lot of us see the big picture and think crypto is just getting started, millennials trust crypto over the stock market and more and more money will be moving to crypto over time, the big boys are now just starting to get in, I'm not sure why but the skeptics have been saying it's going to die a horrible death since I got in at $200.    I see the broken record over and over and yet here we are sitting at $9400.   

The stock market is what you should be worried about at the [moment](https://twitter.com/mBTCPizpie/status/992049600365129728).  The stock market isn't built on speculation as much as crypto but every 10 years there is a major correction/crash and it's due for it.   I thought about diversifying into stocks more with my profit but the charts are looking scary AF, would be dumb to go the stock route at the moment. 
>What I will not give you is the comparison with the 7k BGD. There was clearly more accumulation and a lot more leveraged shorts opened in the 6k range and also a mid term resistance line that we broke. Comparing that situation to this one isn't as fair I would say. If we only look at candles though AS MUCH AS IT PAINS ME YOU ARE RIGHT (DON'T SCREENSHOT THIS). But it wouldn't suprise me to find another example on the chart that proves the opposite too.

Fair, I realize that was pretty much an entirely different situation. Was just mentioning it in passing; there's (obviously) plenty of other price points we haven't retraced to again after breaking up post adequate price discovery.

To be clear, I'm not saying this is *definitely* going to break up without retracing to 9.4 or something. Just not gonna be surprised.

>The importance I am given to 10k is the same I have given 5k in october. The public WILL react to this. And the public does not use TA that much.

The very first time we broke 10k, maybe. But given the number of times we've passed it now (sometimes many times within a few day period), I think you could be disappointed when we do now. There'd maybe be an initial pump, but I definitely don't think we'll blow through it without returning to test 9.8k as support eventually.

>I am pretty new to TA in general and enjoy being taken somewhat seriously so thank you for that. Also ever thought about becoming an artist? These microsoft paint skills are beyond even god.

Yeah, I try to judge arguments based on their merit, not how experienced the person is. TA is the one thing you can really evaluate and determine its validity objectively, a bear div is a bear div no matter how experienced the person is showing it. You're definitely on the right track, just keep reading and learning as much as you can. Nuances like volume for patterns and recognizing valid divergence take time to internalize.

And thanks, I just put in my two weeks notice given your encouragement. Gonna draw circles in paint for a living now.
For one, Monero was forked from Bytecoin. The creator is suspected to be part of the Bytecoin scam, which involved a faked 2-year blockchain with an 80% premine.  Worst beginning ever.

Since then, ownership responsibility of the project has been decentralized pretty well but with drama.

Then there's all the Monero forks.  The most recent MoneroV one being handled fairly well.  Which is probably the reason for the recent dump as people had bought the news a while back.

There's also some sort of FUD about that you can't verify how many coins are actually on the chain.  I don't know details though it could very well be true.

(this post totally crosses the line for rules on this sub, but at least it is a far enough tangent from top level, but should definitely stop here)
Definitely. it's getting so boring I'm really considering doing some very small positions as scalps for fun. Holding a trade open for weeks at a time is quite boring..

I've basically opened 4 trades in like 2 months...
I don't think it's a coincidence. I think people watch carefully for the daily close. A confluence of factors caused the sell off. I don't think it was manipulation. 

But I get where you're coming from. I just think that was much more organic than things have been lately. 

Don't mean to be a dick but did you long the top or something?.
I know man. The only thing that needs to be on a blockchain is a currency. Anything else is just ridiculous (unless it is somehow censored). And once you have a decentralized currency, the centralized services can always adopt it to provide a good amount of decentralization by aligning monetary incentives.

But but Dentacoin
I'd trust the stock market before I trust crypto. The vast majority of the crypto space is full of coins that serve literally no purpose and/or compete with already existing products.

Golem, for example, is a direct competitor to Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud. Not only is it a direct competitor, it's inferior and more expensive than the other three.

It tries to sell itself as a product for computer that's sitting in the corner, not being used. However, that computer's not using electricity and the long term cost of a computer isn't the depreciation in the tech (as most computers these days are sufficient for 6-8 years of run time) but rather the energy costs of running it.

So if the major cost is electricity, then the three centralized services will most definitely be cheaper because they get electricity at commercial rates, which are significantly cheaper. Therefore Golem will most definitely be a more expensive service. It'll just come down to who is paying for it? The network users or the idiots supporting the backend (at a loss).

The vast majority of projects in the crypto space are exactly like Golem in their utter pointlessness. Decentralized sounds great and all but the reality is that *nobody actually cares*. People whine about Google selling data but aren't looking to pay for their email anytime soon (and there are a plethora of great email services for the privacy minded but they're not free or have severe restrictions).
Hmm, yeah interesting. I guess I don't follow it that closely. Actually I don't follow any of the alts that closely. I know the general value props for each and the basic tech ideas but up until last year I just didn't care. I still don't care but it's a bit more in my periphery. Still, LTC and XMR would be the only others that I would consider holding for any significant period of time based on my current understanding of the space. ETH seems constantly ready to collapse technically or leadership-wise. XRP sucks. BCH really sucks. EOS? Good God, no. Nano? Give me a fucking break... and so on and so on.
I've opened 4 in last 3 weeks ;-) I'm basically where I was in December in terms of USD and BTC stack. Of course valuation of BTC is smaller but I can say I've made almost all back (10% down on BTC so no big deal).

You've got nice short, you should've go long at 9k and leave both until market decides what next. Profit either way.
I didn't long the top. 

And seemed like classic manipulated bull trap followed by dump, even without the daily close.  That just sealed it beyond much doubt, in my mind.
That's what I don't get. If decentralized currencies were soo effing great, why aren't all of these sites picking it up? Why aren't people accepting bitcoin and everything else as payment?

Patreon has literally no censorship issues and it's their entire company message. Don't like YouTube? Post to PornHub. It's literally growing and picking up regular content.

Don't like WhatsApp and Facebook? People have been moving to Signal and Telegram for a while. Skype sucks? Discord replaced it.

I mean literally everything in crypto is already produced better in a centralized manner. The decentralized internet would literally be one where *you have to pay* to use it. There are paid versions of all the major sites and almost nobody uses any of them because they don't want to.
I agree that it's mostly built on speculation and will have an insane crash *at some point.   You're missing the hype and potential for people to get very rich, when chad hears about joe getting rich off his shitcoin chad wants to jump in and tells his family and friends. I agree the stock market in the long-run is solid because it's based more of real value, but in the short to medium I wouldn't touch it.  When the crypto hype dies down it will have it's crash but I don't think we're close yet. 

Crypto will see what the dotcom crash and boom will see, solid projects with real world use like Bitcoin & Factom etc will rise from the ashes and go crazy while all the shitcoins die a horrible death. Obviously anecdotal but 9 out 10 people I meet at party's or in real life know nothing about crypto and haven't touched it, I live in a tech area and a lot have heard about Bitcoin but haven't got in or know nothing about it.   I think people are missing how early we are and how much potential this space has before it implodes.  
That's awesome, I'm glad you're up. I could have 3x my btc right now if I closed at $6.5k lol. 

But whatever still up since I lost all that money. 

And yeah I'm thinking of longing futures
Possibly. If we get back to $9.8k I don't think it's a bull trap. And it's really not too far off

But yes this is how double top at $11.7k happened. 
I completely agree. And if these successful services wanted to incorporate crypto, they could do so in the next release, no issue whatsoever. they don’t. Why? Because their content is fucking free anyways! I have no clue why people don’t get it
But that bubble is still *years* off. We literally peaked not more than a few months ago.

We can't literally go into *another* run up and ATH all within 12 months. None of these projects have any real world purpose. They can't last another 18-24 months of showing *nothing* of utility, much less have skyrocketing prices as well.

That makes no sense. There are years worth of gains baked in even at the current prices.
I could've go long at 6.5 and be way up :-P

But didn't have time to watch the charts so basically woke up to high 7k and thought it's too late to enter.
Double Top at $11.7k did not happen this way.  The 2nd "top" wasn't $120 higher than the first top, at least not on Bitfinex.

Instead the second top was significantly lower than the first, which is what you usually find in double top scenarios.
RemindMe! 12 months "Well? have we already topped out"
True, although I'm not sure a 1% difference matters. It's still a case for a double top. 

First was $9.77k now this was $9.87k. Still can be a double top
