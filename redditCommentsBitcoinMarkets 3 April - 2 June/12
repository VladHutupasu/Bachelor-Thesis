In those silent days I recommend everyone to do some proper reading of trading books. If I had started with those 6 years ago when I bought my first BTC I would have done so much better. It's quite facsinating how the stock market in 1900 or commodities market in the 1970s is basically the same like crypto now. The same "manipulation" or "coin X will do 10X" memes was also then

I can recommend the Market Wizard series by Jack Schwager, Trading in the zone, Turtle Traders (good for crypto trending markets) and of course my favorite about emotions, biology and trading that helped me a lot the last 1 year  https://www.amazon.com/Hour-Between-Dog-Wolf-Transforms/dp/0143123408

Then also some books about poker mentality(you need to love to lose :D http://jaredtendlerpoker.com/mentalgameofpoker/ ), some behaviour economics and general risk from like Richard Thaler(when I finally understood loss aversion vs gains, wow!) and Nicholas Naseem Taleb are great openers to a lot of more academic material

Hello 8200 my old friend...
Interesting fact:  I have the Gdax UI and tradingview open all day on my computer while I'm doing my day-job.  Whenever there is a lot of price action going on the gdax UI starts pulling extra computational power from the CPU, which causes the fans to kick up a notch.  It's pretty funny, it's like I can hear the market.  I'll be working, not watching it, then hear the fans speed up and switch over to find that there was just a big move.  
It seems a lot of folks disagree with my short entry earlier this morning at $8,150, and they'd be right to do so. I'm starting to disagree with it myself. But here's why I opened it:

https://imgur.com/a/Iy2Uf79

The price action between $8,600 and $8,200 has formed a descending wedge on the 30m. 

When I entered, the market had broken down below the support line. For a short entry, it really doesn't get any better than shorting below a descending resistance line that's broken down. This is because, assuming sellers can hold the former support line as resistance, that line will continue to decline and improve the short entry over time. 

Unfortunately for me — and anybody who followed my entry — the market immediately bounced back above the support line. 

This leaves me in a pretty bad spot where I'm forced to:

1. Hold the position and hope to escape at breakeven if there's another test of the support line.

2. Exit now and reevaluate 

3. Hold the position until the formation breaks to the upside and I can be certain it's not likely to turn into a winning trade in the shot term.

For now I'm opting for option # 1.

I wanted to better explain better why I closed my short from \~8400 and opened a long at 7975, since some were saying it was ballsy or they would've kept the short open.

I was expecting to go to low\-mid 7900s but I didn't want to miss what could turn out to be an amazing entry since we've been rangebound between 7900\-10000 for what feels like forever.

[https://imgur.com/a/Uesbc4i](https://imgur.com/a/Uesbc4i)

7900 area has almost a week of support going back to 4/12, and RSI is oversold at this point \- I know one shouldn't put too much faith in it, but it's been playing relatively well lately.

Stops are TIGHT and market in case the server shits the bed on a drop. If we drop below 7900 I think there will be a bleed down to around 7000 \- the area we played around with from 3/30 to 4/11. We'd also have much more support there if not for the massive spike up on 4/12 \- then we'd have like 2 weeks in that range.

R:R is incredible here. Either the 7.9 area holds and my entry was great, or 7.9 drops, I lose some of my profits from 8.4, and I ride a new short down to the low 7s or potentially lower. You can also see we're back in the downtrend from 9950, look at that however you want.

Closing my short from 10k$ from a few months ago, won't be greedy like last time , i'll check back next month to check how things are going to evaluate my next trade,  no idea how you guys can handle the pressure of daily trading :)
An inverted C&H that failed to break down is substantially larger than the double top at 11,8

* iC&H fail: https://www.tradingview.com/x/7fqJ6uyU/
* Zoomed out: https://www.tradingview.com/x/8xRCeCIk/

I'm not sure how to interpret this. It's rare... and we're not in the clear. Confirmation will have us targeting 7,4. Failing to break down here doesn't flatter bear TA. I'm hesitant to call this a triple bottom, but if bears can't break the price down here then they deserve a reversal that's comparable.

I keep pointing out potentially bullish formations that aren't confirming. Consider the falling wedge:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/BJDhmOUn/

Confirming the iC&H breaks the falling wedge down. 

Looks like a coinflip to me.
The weekly support line that stretches back to 2017 is around $7400.  

I will be surprised to see going much lower than this. 
If 7800 breaks with conviction, the only move is to hedge everything:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/Al3xzaXf/

adding to my long until that happens (entered 8090 quarts, adding at 7980). Good R/R, should recoup losses on a turn around short, should this break down. Big move coming here.
Anyone else looking at the long term moving averages atm?

BTC playing with the 300MA and ETH with the 200MA.

Looking to long if we can close above, but this is pretty frightening tbh.
Remember: Maximum pain 
High volume node from here to mid 7800s, below that it's thin air until 7200. https://www.tradingview.com/x/KzDIrfrd/

We broke back into the 9900 down trend line and are currently hugging it, which is right above S1 pivot point. https://www.tradingview.com/x/sQhanjP2/

RSI is oversold up to 4H which is slightly crossing to, but no bounce yet. Room to go on higher time frames. MACD is bearish on most time frames.

I thought maybe at this level I'd flip my short to a long, but will wait for 7800. See if that holds.
The theme of 2018: I shoulda just kept my short open lol

Its getting impossible to predict the day-to-day but I feel great just leaving a fat short open. Gotta play those macro plays, as volatility has greatly diminished. 
closed 60% of my 10x shorts...last one has an entry of 8360 so letting it ride !

edit : we bounced off the .786 fib and the channel support, etc

peace
Guess no sleep for us Europeans tonight... 
Suicide hotlines memes looking very bullish
This is why I always scale out of profitable positions now rather than just closing. I just closed 66% (two limit orders of 33% each) of my short position a few minutes before the bear flag broke down, I still get to reap some profits from this latest little dump.

I used to just move my market stops to lock in profits instead, but the fees from those market orders really start to add up, and you can really get shafted by slippage during giant candles.





Interesting support I found when I was playing around with a line from the last local lows at 6.6k to 7.9k on a slightly longer timespan. Happens to give confluence with the *July* correction.

Not going to try to claim it's overly significant, but if you think that 7.9k was a new local bottom, watching for this support to continue holding is something to keep in mind.

https://imgur.com/a/dstOsWz
I had a small short opened at 8434 since yesterday, which I have doubled at 8215ish, giving me an entry of 8330 now.

My logic is, if buyers couldn’t push us up over 8.5, then 8.4, then why would this bounce significantly at 8.2? There isn’t far for it to go before it hits resistance again. I noticed several recent wicks upwards on the hourly, suggesting price suppresion.

I think we go down further first before any bounce. I will close half my short if we hit 8k, then let the rest ride for the week, with stops at break even.
We hit our channel bottom perfectly. This is pretty crazy. If our technical bounce can't even pass 7900, we might be in for a BRD mirroring the BGD after all: https://www.tradingview.com/x/Ok8HxK8u/

Anyone actually think $7,800 will hold? 

I’m not touching this thing with a long until we find strong support at a local bottom / consolidate there for some time .  

I don’t even trust longing at $7800 despite the fact the RSI is straight doody. Sellers have the floor right now. 

**Edit** To add it also looks like ETH completed its head and shoulders pattern 

**Chart** https://www.tradingview.com/x/zsvLj6P1/
Long $8190, stop just under $7800. Many reasons, strongest of which are the decreasing volume profile on the daily since May 1, weekly uptrend since Apr 1, shorter RSI's oversold territory. 

Fundamentally I can't shake the idea that this market is transforming with the likes of institutional investors. This is a multi year bull market, I don't think we can stay under the Weekly 20 MA for much longer.
All my trendlines cross at around 7800-8000 in less than 48h. Even an age old uptrend from before Dec. 2017 that provided nearly unbreakable support this whole year.

The lowest point before we bounce could be there. But I'd be *very* surprised if we went below that. I'd even be surprised if we went all the way down there.

Zoomed out...

I think all the TA has been beaten to hell already so I just want to discuss something else pertaining to the market.  If you are wondering where the hell did all the buyers go, it might be better to ask who would buy knowing a massive dump will happen to screw you over soon (see 10k, 9.3k, 8.7k for the latest series of dumps).  Then the big players try to incite FOMO by washing a BGD or putting up buy walls at key points and won't let the market fall - just to give Bulls that little hope.  I got no proof, but this shit seems so easily manipulated with the shitty volume we got.  I mean if this is the game now, so be it... we are all here as traders anyway trying to get a piece of the pie.  Just know it's not so easy when you scare away all of the easy money.

edit: /end rant
MEX, Binance, and GDAX all trading above Bitfinex right now. Shorts down 2% from this morning. Longs up 2% from this morning. Futures premium on MEX increasing (June currently $120 over BFX, $100 over swaps). Weird price action.

We're in a descending channel inside a descending channel, but we're right over a horizontal support/resistance HVN and also a bit higher above our former resistance line from 10K (yet untested as support).

Macro: https://www.tradingview.com/x/n1RqV1Is/  
Micro: https://www.tradingview.com/x/hjSKUznS/  

All in all, not the best place to enter a position, but I'm holding my short. Originally opened last night at 8400, took heavy profit on the first drop to 8300. Added it all back in on the descending wedge fakedown at 8195, so I'm very little below CA now. Right around 8280 CA (8395 June futs). Will be looking to exit on a significant break of our downtrend channel and chop zone with the intent to re-enter a test of the top of our larger downward channel. 

edit to add: I'm not an alt coin person either, but the ETH/BTC ratio is dumping hard, which I believe is often a precursor. 
Short 8230, target 8220.
The story since May 5 has been "lower highs, lower lows": 
5/5: 9960 - high;
5/9: 8960 - low;
5/10: 9370 - high;
5/12: 8250 - low;
5/14: 8820 - high;
5/18: 7940 - low;
5/21: 8590 - high
5/? :  xxxx  - low ...

Fuck this is stressful 
First thing I would tell my new to trading self is learn Ichimoku (at least for me it's been amazing), second is when we go on our next crazy run watch for the [chikou span](https://snag.gy/RK3MPW.jpg) (pink line) if we get that huge gap and it tops it's probably time to get out or short.  It's a lagging indicator but you can see it top when it happens.   

Far as right now I'm torn, we have our first kumo bearish twist off to the [right](https://snag.gy/RK3MPW.jpg) (hard to see here though) since 2016 on the weekly, BUT we also have the Kijun-Sen (brown line) which the price likes to gravitate back towards sitting at 13k which we're pretty far way from.  As bearish as it is around here I think we start moving up towards the Kijun-Sen over-time, this is a week time frame so this won't happen instantly but I think we head that way and then maybe back down if we can't get above the cloud.

Edit: Also look like [this trendline](https://snag.gy/eAmoWE.jpg) is holding up with a lot of touches, curious to see if it holds.   
[Buy or sell?](https://www.tradingview.com/x/TCqG5Qti/)
Looking to long in the next 3 hours on any bullish candle formations. [We are presenting an 8 of 9 on the 4HR TD.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/vfFi8zST/)

Within a broad 1:1 possible extension zone, between the .618-.786 retracement zone and wave 4 support. Oversold on the 1HR and approaching on the 2HR. There are longer-term bearish signs but with these factors lining up, I would expect a bounce soon. Despite falling out the bottom of the wedge it is not entirely unexpected to fall out the bottom before reversal.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/jw0sUJ0y/

Sorry charts and the price are already moving and I have made this post late.
What kind of an effing market is this where either everything falls or everything rises with no apparent reason? Is there any individuality in coins or are they all the same?
If you look at the past 6 months this is the flattest the price has been since the 6.8k low in early April. This is reminding a lot of that with buyers refusing to let price go down below a key support zone. I'm expecting flat price for a little longer and then BGD. Of course it's possible bears could take it below 7.9 but I just don't see that happening. 
The bounce doesn't bounce until enough people panic sell the bottom.   
If btc doesn't go below 79XX then i'd expect that btc is is finishing its second wave from 85XX. Btc perfectly bounced off fib 0.5.

The first wave would be from 79XX to 85XX.

If this is the case then btc is about to enter the third wave which would bring it to the area of 9000.

Good luck to all!

It's hard to look at this position and think that Bitcoin can drop more... but it can. DCA is the way to go.

We're about 17 days into the Noob DCA. 223 days are left to get into a position you'll ride out for a decade or so.
Long at 7920 because of multiple longer-term indicators and I don't want to be greedy but I'm a bit concerned that we are close enough to 7800 that a stop hunt is quite possible (maybe at this point likely?)

Sentiment in /r/Bitcoin daily (sky is falling) makes me feel a little better about the position though.
I've taken a small break from trading after a really bad streak over the past week.  However, for those paying attention, we seem to have just bounced off of [the former resistance line from our 9k drop](https://imgur.com/a/HVBNIMm).

If I were watching the charts this morning, I would've entered a long here with stops just below.  It's possible we get another re-test, although I'd be less confident in that line the second time around.

Still out of position.  Good luck out there.
This is worst than my performance on a tinder date.  Ya gotta get it up and keep it up if ya want to get anywhere, Bitcoin.
Closed 8400 short and went long at 7975. It either bounces soon or I'm bailing. Like I said before, I think if 7.9 falls with conviction we're going to bleed to 7 over a few days.
I was scanning the comments on the more popular trading view authors, and the bearish predictions are being bashed pretty hard by the community. 

Sentiment seems to be pretty bullish over there for the most part. 
Adding to my long from 7975 at 7900, still have my finger poised and ready to turn it back into a short along with stops in place for when the server shits the bed. Dangerous game!
Did that break everyones wedge to the downside?
With 8.2 down and no* immediate (substantial) bounce, I'm betting we will see sub 8k in the next 24 hours. Next major support is 7.8k. Not many bulls out to party today (at least not yet)

Edit: not to no*
Urhg stopped out from my 8235 long at 8180, ah well.  This slow grinding is hard but remember that it's not the hit rate of trades that counts it's the payout. 

edit: 1h RSI at 22, doing a high leverage relong here at 8069 with stops below daily low to catch a bounce
Wonder when these longs start to close..below 7.8?
Where do you guys put your stops now if you are short?
I cant't babysit my short and I don't want it to stop to soon.
Edit: Have my stop @ 8174 right now. 50x short from 8110. FOMOed.

That .991 on tether. Seems my fears were at least somewhat on point last night.

sigh... keeping half my stack in usd for longer; are we are now on may 4th if this is a repeat of may 6th
Closed half my short from 8330 at 7880, with a stop buy just over 8k to lock in profit on the other half.

Otherwise I’m letting this ride.

Still down from the BGD though, just gradually recouping those losses.
[deleted]
Closed my short at around $8,065 for a small gain.

Edit: I wanted out earlier today, and I'm happy to get out in profit, albeit only a little bit of it.
Warning, bragpost below.

I spotted the signs of the start of the sudden drop to 8,100 on finex a few seconds before Bitmex reacted. Immediatey hit market sell with a large chunk of my balance at 25x, and have now brought my profits since sunday up to 37.5% on my whole stack.
Long @7860. 1H RSI is trashed @17. This is almost a historical low.

Hoping for a bounce to the descending channel support.

Of course we're also dealing with horizontal support @7800

Hammer on the 15 min is forming as well and we're outside the bbands on medium timeframes.

Edit: I'd say this is as safe as it gets if you're considering longing. Below 7.8-7.75k there is nothing support wise though until 7.4k. And 7.4k is a bit of a long shot. 7.25k is the safer level.

Edit2: Exited half @7910 with the hourly closing soon. This seems very weak.

Edit3: Exited other half @7956.

Average Exit is 7933. Small but nice trade I guess. We're hitting the descending channel support. I assume it will have turned resistance by now.
Seems that bears are taking the stairs down. Looks like another bear flag as of right now. We have a small bullish div on the 1H and are holding on the bottom of the kumo. On lower time frames we are barely oversold. Expecting sideways for a while. 
https://www.tradingview.com/x/AujhK45K/

4H also showing some small bullish div, but we have a candle closing soon and I'll take a better look then. https://www.tradingview.com/x/cncyOzCd/

Also to note, we are at the bottom of a high volume node still, if we break through here next one is around mid 8100s. https://www.tradingview.com/x/fH6lAX7p/

Not really seeing any divergences either on other oscillators.

I'm short from 8380ish, took 25% profit last night on the first breakdown and taking another 25% here. Might add if we have a low volume rise. But targeting 8100s for the rest of this trade. Stops set 8300 for a smallish profit if we bounce hard.
Looking to buy at 8190.  That would put us at oversold on the 1hr RSI AND the bottom of the downward channel from 8600 AND just above the support level of 8172
This is going to be yesterday's 8400-hugging-the-support-line all over again until buyers run out of ammo. I bet we just go sideways to the top of the descending channel and just drop back down again. Or that is my hope since I'm short.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/cCi64rid/
Long, 7980 (8090 OKEX quarts):

https://www.tradingview.com/x/nNppRMTQ/

Hourly: https://www.tradingview.com/x/tiyCKaEJ/

Tight stop here, trading the support. Medium position. Premium  less than $100 also makes the trade enticing.

Also longing the Eth futures @ 645 quarts, trading near zero premium:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/0S82eb3X/


The whole market should have support here, and it's close enough to some lines I think a lot of people have drawn to warrant large risk/reward positions. Will cover below 7800, and hedge short (cover Eth below 635, also hedging those holdings)
Have the crypto gods forsaken us
I covered my short here and opened a small long.  If 8200 falls, I will just reshort, but this would be a natural place for a bounce.

EDIT...ok bailed on my long and went short, but still a good chance of a bounce off of 8140 for double bottom.
Anyone know where Joyrider has been?

The falling wedge appears to have broken down. Which is a bit surprising. 

Short from $8,150
I don't understand why people are so scared of a BGD. I mean, obviously anything can happen in a market like this, but if it does it's going to be for entirely different reasons than the one from 6.6k.

- Shorts are way less than they were at 6.6. The long short ratio is comparably very in favor of longs now. The BGD was, above all else, a short squeeze.

- Overall crypto market was showing signs of life around then. Volume was higher and alt/btc ratios were increasing.

- BTC had repeatedly attempted to break down from the support line that was holding (not just a few tests) and failed.

To be clear, I'm not saying we won't bounce here. 7.8k-7.9k is generally a strong support and high volume node. But it's a completely different situation than the BGD.
Wedge support is at around $8,120 right now. 

I've just set some limit orders to bail me out of my ill-timed short at around $8,130.

Here's hoping they're actually filled. 

EDIT: pulled my limit orders. As others have pointed out, this could keep dropping. Better to wait to see if there's a bounce rather than assuming there will be one.
And just like that we're back in the 9950 downtrend from 5/5. Absolutely brutal.

Guys https://twitter.com/PeterLBrandt/status/999057901317599233

ETH is below..just putting it out there
So... It definitely doesn’t look like 7.8k will hold. Given where the market temporarily stopped I would have expected a stronger bounce.

IMO, the sooner we test the ascending support (around 6.9k) or ATH trend line (around 6.5k) the better. I don’t think a true bull trend will start until that happened.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/hdpBQh40/

I’ll be looking for at least a small bounce soon to hedge. And got some fiat on the sidelines for the aforementioned targets.
This market used to be so volatile.... But now it's so rare and we're lucky if we see 5% fluctuations a day. Getting so boring, I only check charts once an hour now instead of once per minute. 
I know it's a bit quiet, but we're right on the cusp. As an update to my earlier post, we're approaching go time.  

Shorts just dropped under 20K  
Longs just rose over 32.5K  

We're forming a descending triangle (continuation pattern) inside our descending channel off 8150. ETH leading the charge downwards. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/NktwOlYC/

We should be getting a move quickly. If ever there was a low risk / high reward play, it's looking like a short from 8 with stops over 8260. 

edit: dip buying still in full effect. Let's see if the sellers push this hard enough to finally force buyers to get out of the way. I imagine 8120-8000 is liquidation central. 
Moved my adds from the high 8300s down and executed them at 8300 on June futures. At this stage, if we make it back where they were, I wouldn't want to be executing them. CA is about 8350. On spot that's probably somewhere around 8250. I'll be looking to bail if we break our downtrend convincingly.

Need more desperation exodus. 

Keep capital on the side, ready.
even if we bounce here then what, how is this not majorly rekt already. look at this shit
I know, I know, everyone says it but it just doesn’t feel like enough misery.  I want more blood before I throw money into this market again.  So for now on my hands with some small stakes.  I’m patient.  I think I’ll see a good entry eventually.  Game on whoever is playing this thing.
Bullish divergence on the 15min, oversold all the way up to the 12hr, we're at historical support levels, I think it's time to buy.
I can totally see BTC and ETH getting into a combo down spiral. I used to think that only BTC affected ETH, but I've been seeing lately (past few months) that ETH is affecting BTC as well.

It's one thing if BTC with a high market share is in a downward trend.. it's a whole different story when you have the top 2 crypto working in synergy (whether that's up or down)

This could get pretty ugly, IMO.
Still short. Still scared of a BGD. Still think buyers have shown themselves to be scared shitless by recent drops. I don't think there is enough faith in the market to sustain any significant price rises right now. 7.8k breaks this time in my opinion. Target is a weak 7.4k support then a strong 7.2k support. I hope no one gets rekt too badly, you are all alright in my book :)

Rage Quitting 101

Never do it at the bottom.
Here's what I'm seeing right now.

The pattern that was forming on the 4H broke down last night. I had a limit buy filled at 8227 this morning and will exit if we drop below the support at 8172. A bounce in the 8200 range would set a higher low on the daily equilibrium pattern.

The 4H MACD has flipped bearish. The RSI, though not oversold is approaching it, which would indicate that a bounce is in the near future. A large volume sell-off could push it into the 20's, but there has been a distinct lack of volume for a couple days now, so we may see another slow, meandering bounce back to the 8400 range.  

On a side note, I'm curious what caused this drop. I haven't seen any particularly bad FUD stories in the news lately. 

Current support: 8172, 8000 psychological

Current resistance: 8438, 8600

Guys - a question to those who are profitable trading with/without margin

I invested in November, followed the sentiment in this subreddit in January and sold most of my stack for decent gains.

Rebought somewhere at 7000-7200.

I am a young guy, who is ready to take some risks with a large part of my capital, have some math background.

I was wondering - realistically - if I put in about 1-3 hours per day studying TA and all other factors are in favour of trading (emotional stability and capital management), how long it may take  to reach "some" kind of proficiency??

Time has c
come to stop basing my trading decisions by refreshing this page :D

I understand this is basically an unanswerable question - maybe you can give me an approximate range?  Any other suggestions?


Thank you and good luck! Sorry if this was offtopic.

Healthiest part of this dip: $8000 capitulated once again, right into a double bottom. 

Let's touch down once again.
At this rate the mining profitablility will take a good kick in the nuts soon. Will continue mining though. Also just added some to my short as I think this might head more down following the breakdown of 8K and the support of 8250 and decending wedge. But also because its probably going for maximum pain and could make some nasty patterns if we go below 7.5K. The daily does look ripe for falling down to the edge of the lower BB and probably bounce, though it could be a few days if shit really hits the fan.

There is a few different ways to draw to ( Include the FOMO 8600 wicks or not)

https://www.tradingview.com/x/yOMxvdad/

On that note, we could have found temporary support in the $8230-$8285 range 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/sppGHZEc/

Opening a long here wouldn’t be the worst idea I’ve ever seen, I would look for an entry around $8250 with stops below $8160 ish. 

If the wedge breaks up, we could see a retrace to $8450-$8500 which we will find a dick ton of resistance at $8450. Buyers have been playing a pretty hard game today, wouldn’t be surprised if the follow through for another run. I definitely wouldn’t open a short here. The R/R is terrible. The next short I would be looking at is a break of $7800 
I was bored so I made some hopium for the bulls:

(The projected time frame for this fractal to play out would be 44 weeks from now)
I notice ETH is likely going to test the 637 support level for the 3rd time in 10 days, I mention this because I do not believe that a triple bottom is very common or have any reason to think that one is is in the cards (MACD is still ugly on 4HR and Daily).  That said, the biggest concern I have to opening a long BTC at a potential double bottom at 7.9k is that ETH will screw it all up by dragging it down when it blows through 637 on the 3rd test.  This is why the 7.4 may make some sense to me since ETH may have leveled off by then.

Edit: I wonder if there could be a degree of if BTC gets to it's double bottom first and rebounds strongly on volume, then ETH will recover before needing to test that level and everything is swell for longs.  Or if ETH gets to its test first, things will likely go south with BTC fast since testing 637 for the third time in 3 days means a failure of its own double bottom?
You know you're getting better as a trader when you used to be pissed about losses, now you get pissed about breaking even or making too small a profit than you're used to.
Went long at $7910, super low RSI levels and bolllinger bands touching the bottom on most of the timeframes. Feel like it is a risky move but we shall see what happens.. 
bitcoin is starting to feel like a 7 coin now

Still holding my short. I opened a scalp short on swaps from 8110 to 8020, then opened a new one at 8015 (stops break-even), but I don't want to touch my primary position at this stage. I have stops in minor profit, but we'd have to retrace the last 8 hours of drops. I do not want to get stopped out prematurely on this one. /u/SloppySynapses has taught me that BTC makes you work for the big wins on the short side.

Buyers are finally stepping out of the way. We will likely fight to get through the 7950-7800 range, and a strong technical bounce is possible anywhere in there. I'm betting 7860ish, as it's our channel bottom. We've broken through all major trendline support I can see except the channel bottom, so the fact that it lines up with a HVN leads me to expect a bounce there. It's my target for my scalp short from 8015--if it doesn't get stopped out first.

Good luck all. 

edit: Not sure if the downvotes were salty bulls or if it sounded like I was hindsight trading, but the [scalp I mentioned I referenced here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8l74h5/daily_discussion_tuesday_may_22_2018/dzeur9w/)
Okay any lower and things are looking even bleaker. We cant make a new weekly low. I dont really understand this premium and the amount of longs when its this anemic and bearish. I am slightly bullish but its starting to feel like an opportunity of a lifetime to short these overprices alts..
I know I know this chart says nothing, but the new data point is a 11: [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=&#37;2Fm&#37;2F05p0rrx](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=%2Fm%2F05p0rrx)

Almost the lowest point in the past 12 month. 
Getting close to the bottom. Let's hope we don't fall through, but bounce.

Might be looking at 7920 now. 7500, 7200 may slow it down a little but 6825/30 is the bottom support of the descending wedge on the daily chart. That is it's likely near term destination . . . https://www.tradingview.com/x/StPncdcP/
I’m long from 8500 because I couldn’t babysit this the passed few days. Wtf should I just go away for a few more days or bail now? FML

Edit: I’m reading mixed reviews. Some are scared now of a surprise BGD and some think we’re going to 6k. 

POLL?
4H MACD resembles the pattern we had between April 1 - April 12, just before we had the BGD. Reduced volume also points to a coiled trading range, which may be followed by an extreme move.

I would be very cautious shorting here, and would use tight stops.
This bad boy is heading sub 8k, I believe 7.8k will have trouble holding. All those who didn't take profits at 7.81-8.2 will be faster to the door, accelerating the downtrend. They will look to buy ~7.2-7.6. These are just my thoughts, not investment advice. Best of luck everyone. 
[removed]
7800 not going to hold. Shorting the f outta this. 7500 i am ready. 
Personally I believe the next 24 hours will define the short term trend. Flirting with the 8.2k support is very dangerous for bulls. I do not think another drop below 8.2 will be bought up quite as quickly as the drop a few hours ago. If we re-break down, I'll be looking for that entry in the 7.4-7.8k range within the next few days. 


On the other hand, this is a chance for 8.2k to reestablish itself as a strong support, although I don't think it will.



Current state: 98%BTC looking to reenter ALTs pending a nice drop. 


Good luck everyone 
Looks like we're stuck between \~7900 and 10k since the massive bump of 4/12. I'll be looking to close my short and go heavily long in the mid 7900s with tight stops. If 7900 doesn't hold, see y'all at \~7k \- around where we were from 3/29 to 4/12.

Will also close \(but not go long yet\) if we get out of the downchannel and stay out for a convincing amount of time; currently around 8300.
Last week I posted a comment about the importance of BTC dominance during these times to understand who exactly is leveraged (or taking more risks by holding alts). This can give an insight into what % of the market is more "at risk" (read: holding alts). This comment will be timestamped at 38.1% dominance. I believe alts will be on a firesale on this drop, and I'm laddering in accordingly. 
Took 40% profits from my short from CA 8260 right here, might add more if this rises with no volume or it stays stalled. So far no bounce yet. Stops around 8200 for a tiny profit in case of BGD.

I might take profits around this green box depends how we get there.

Bought some BTC with fiat on this dip.

Chart reference: https://www.tradingview.com/x/yaSY1hTy/

Holding short from 8350, small position size and tiny lev so its peanut gain but still gain so looking to lock it in. Having second thoughts as to where. Initial target was 78xx-80xx so i am in that range now, but....

Volume has been shite all may. only decent green volume day was 14/05, its always larger volume dumps followed by low volume consolidation. Daily and 4HR RSI still have a way to go. i can see 8k breaking and with 8k i can see 7.8k going quick as well.

probably gonna close the short and fish for longs soon, scattered orders 7.7-7.2k with a stop at like 6800

EDIT: a convincing close below 7900 means we have yet to set another higher low on the weekly and the massive green candle on 12/04 left a massive gap in the chart. Im super excited, gonna be some great buying opportunities soon

well the daily future cloud or whatever the hell its called is bullish, there is very strong support here and at 8k and 7.8k. Rsi is neutral to slightly oversold, so im expecting more bullish momentum rather than bearish
Hmmmm usdt/usd has strayed from 1:1 again, usually that happens from high volatility and is temporary but .999 is going for 24 hours now. And today was relatively quite.

I hope we don't get a repeat of may 6, that was not a good day.

Selling half my trading btc for 24 hours, I don't like tethers position in this market, and the last scares weren't kind; and I was to bullish last month I need to consider that we are headed to a sadness market
Managing a large short on bitflyer from 965k \(equiv $8330 USD\). Need to sleep.  
Putting stops at 975k \($8450\).  
Looking to ride down to 890k \($7750\) area in the next 24\-36 hours.  
Eyeing the same 7.7\-7.9 support as others, 7.4 otherwise.
We have a very slight hidden bearish divergence on the 12hr. I've been in fiat for a week now and it makes me feel like I'm not accomplishing anything but it seems like I'll stay in fiat a little while longer until I get my entry at 8k-ish. 
I said this before when we where at 8.5 and it's still relevant. There where 3k longs opened on this rise. The more we go down the more longs going to close the more we go down. I'm expecting 8k-ish to be a temporary bottom. Small rise and after that I have no idea.
are the charts indicating any possibility of bitcoin hitting 20k again this year?
When all the bears are circle jerking each other over shorting in to oversold rsi it's time for the oversold bounce play.
The higher low is in - 7986 on Bitfinex. Let the bull market commence! /s
Hmm, when I look at the chart I really can't find anything that makes sense trend/target-wise. The last support in the area I could find was at 8310, but we fell through it overnight (UTC time). Now I'm looking at a possible retest of the resistance of our wedge, which could take us as low at 8100, though I doubt it'll be still very significant at that price. (below breakout point.)

For now we seem to be painting a bearflag which might culminate into a right shoulder of an IH&S, but price is simply looking heavy and I'd consider a breakdown below 8250 to invalidate that. 

Chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/uURtwhzb/

Edit: shit bearflag broke down as I was typing this. I'll extent the lower boundary for the IH&S to 8200 as last resort hopium. 
Have a small short position. Waiting for 8300\+ to add to my shorts.

We're at the point of control. https://www.tradingview.com/x/wESsiiMP/

If 8.1 doesn't double bottom, the next long entry will be 7.4, or bottom of consolidation range: https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZdeztDjH/

If it were to drop thru buyer resistance straight down and hit the bottom of this descending wedge today that would be at 6900 . . doubt that will happen but if this pattern carries out it may reach bottom about June 6 at 7000. Look at the dates on the touch points . . . https://www.tradingview.com/x/HTglbJAg/
Still well below the key 8.5 level, I want to say there will be an attempt at 7.9k double bottom but even then the daily MACD and 4HR are not quite there yet (as in not yet bottoming out) as we can see selling accelerating.  I do see the next pivot support level on the daily is at 7.4k, if 7.9 does not hold that is the next target I have based purely on the calculation of this set of pivots, not my subjective guess.
Take care traders, some bigger moves are due. The 12h Bbands were tight and got expanded, 7.3k target def. possible from here. I stay in Fiat from here, although the shorter time\-frames are very oversold. 
BRD to complete the final big Bart at 7k?
Just incredible how noone is shorting and longs are increasing. Feels like I’m in crazyland. The delusion is real
The party is over right now. But that silence will not last forever. Only until deep desperation comes up. The sentiment is still to optimistic. See marketcircle. 

And now downvote me for predicting more bearish months. 
over 1 week without some nice fake news FUD. My FUDar is signaling that any second now something comes up
Macro 1 day H&S pattern still looks good, target would be below the "BGD" so mid 6k's. Expect a short term relief rally soon but if we break below 8k again I'll be adding heavily to my short in the anticipation of this pattern playing out.
Is it just me or are we on the verge of falling below the downtrend from 10k?

On my chart we are touching it right now
This 8200 is no joke.  Curious how things will shake out.
Unfortunate lack of bounce says volumes about us going much much lower .. pity 
opened a new 25x leveraged long at 82xx

seems like i'm going against the crowd

still have the same view as i posted earlier today

this is a risky trade and i can get liquidated if the price drops another 200 or so
I’m not sure about you guys but I would be extremely scared to go Long on Da corn right now. Beyond pathetic bounce off support line of descending channel. Mine wicked through.  

https://www.tradingview.com/x/9e5teC5L/

Plethora of longs open, buyers have been slowly failing over the last few days. Yes, they have done one hell of a job but they only keep BTC at a certain support point for a few hours before giving up and moving the next leg down. 

If we break below $8,000 again I dont see this stopping at 7.9k for a hot minute. Maybe a bounce but then back down to goblin town. 

I’m usually pretty optimistic when it comes to the price rising as I have a soft side for my inner bull, but alts have actually fell off the face of the earth and the ETH head and shoulders isn’t looking like clear sky’s 

Disclaimer: I’m short 

Edit: Out of descending channel  ( for now )

If this breaks $7000 and doesn't bounce back over then I don't see good things in the future and the bubble will continue deflating over the USA summer.

Looking at the 1hr candles, we've been dumped on for five hours straight, and the price has only gone down $250.  All in all, that's pretty weak.  If a similar number of coins had been market bought over the same period, we'd be bearing down on $10K right now.

I'm going to let them dump it down to $7.5K, then buy like a recent divorcee after her first alimony check.

So there's this wedge most of you are aware of I imagine. We hit the bottom Feb week 1 then the top March week 1. Back to the bottom April week 1 and then the top May week 1. Kinda seems like a natural pattern. Since the March top, interest/volume is gradually declining  so movement is going more sideways but still reaching the limits of the wedge as it narrows. Guess buyers don't see this they keep trying to push price up so IDK if the June bottom will happen on this schedule. I'm staying 100% out until the bottom happens AND there is strong sustained volume upwards from there. Unless there is some powerful catalyst, I can't see moving up to test/blow thru this wedge which would be at about 9385 today(not taking into consideration any other support/resistance formations or dildos). I'm tired of being whipsawed out of precious capital. I buy to sell high, don't have any interest in shorting nor do I have the stake to do it. . . https://www.tradingview.com/x/6qKojAZa/
Good morning everyone.  I'm looking for a way to track large crypto market buy orders in excess of 10 BTC.  Is there any way of doing so without viewing live order books?  Thanks.
Anyone else having problems with the bitmex site in terms of orders? I swore I took out a short at 8200 earlier today. Now it won't show me. But then it does show up sometimes but shows a tiny realized profit that can't possible be correct. And now I can't close it. Or I do close it and nothing happens. Anyone else experience this sort of issue?

Edit: I can see my short open position if I load it on laptop not my phone. But it's not tracking the actual price. Again, anyone have this problem? How was it resolved?
Closed my leveraged long, considering opening a leveraged short because this truly doesn't look good  for bulls. They are very indecesive and insecure, the longer we stay between $8-$8.5k, the harder the crash will be. It's only a bull market when there is constant positive price action. Negative or neutral (sideways) price action are both characteristics of a bear market. Expecting this to crash sub $8.2k - followed by a massive drop dropping it below $8.1k - within mere hours.
bullish divergence on the 15 min (stoch)

that must have been the bottom
If we don't bounce above 8k...see you at 7k
The only situation in which I can understand selling bitcoin at these prices is if someone literally needs to do it to pay for an urgent life-saving surgery for their child. Anything else is absolute degeneracy and high time-preference that would put even a goldfish to shame.
Keep in mind:

Bouts of extreme early-stage market fear are frequent.

Bouts of a market rocketing in price to reflect a societal shift coinciding with real-world adoption, utility and 'a new story around money' are brief & rare.






This will climb back up to 82-8300 before another ladder down
Damn, why did I cover part of my short

https://www.tradingview.com/x/JhicJB86/
oh yea, bring the 8,150 double-bottom action. /s
I keep trying to scalp these bounces and it's too tricky and then it tanks and I just lose more.   Maybe it really is good just to stay short all the time now, just like holding was the best last year.


ETH/BTC ratio bleeding out... Does this have any correlation with any recent BTC dumps?

EDIT\-\- meant to ask if ETH/BTC dump is a forecast of future BTC movements, based on our most recent BTC dumps... I'm guessing the answer is no
looks like spoofy wants to break the support trendline. 
What's an fiat-to-crypto exchange that supports US customers?
Tempted to buy, but I think we're going a bit lower so I'll hold on for now.

If ~$8k holds as a new bottom, we are definitely in a bull market.
Once all the weak hands have been shaken out, can we start to rubber band back up. Mark my words, this is no different than the dump from February and a massive pump to $10k+

I'm waiting for the dust to settle to buy back in. Also you monkeys calling for sub $6k is another great indicator to take a long position.
Shower thought: What if the mad dumpers are the exchanges themselves?  Bitfinex prints a bunch of Tether, causing a pump, sells a bunch of Bitcoin, dropping the price, then buys back at the lower price with said Tether... something along those lines.

https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/3D2oetdNuZUqQHPJmcMDDHYoqkyNVsFk9r

Get your coins off the exchanges, dudes.  Keep only what you are willing to lose on there.  Send the rest to cold storage.  At some point, one of them will get caught not having enough Bitcoin to cover what they've sold.
Remember the $1000 in an hour BGD back at $6.6K a little over a month ago? Yeah, that's what Pumpy can do.  Dumpy can spend 5x as much money for 1/4 the effect. If you think we're not in a bull market, you're delusional.  

That being said, if I were the shorting type, I'd be shorting right here. But I'm not.  I'm the, "Sleep tight and hope I got more cheap corn in the next couple days" type.

WHO.... IS... SELLING?
Third time to drop below 8190 today. This time will get very ugly, dont see this recovering. 
Closed my long for a small loss, this feels a black swan even is coming in. 
As expected and written mutileple tiems earlier today, my $8.1k target was broken and now expecting $7.8k. If $7.8 doesn't hold, the next target is $6.3k.
Looks like it stopped dropping when hitting the resistance (now support?) line of the falling wedge that was broken out of on the 20th.  ~~(sorry no chart, mines too messy right now...)~~  [here it is anyway](https://imgur.com/YRoiMCY)
Currently at $8200 on OKEX. Those who think $8190 is are the bottom are mistakin'... No way this won't drop more than $10 from here, just $5 away from $8190 target. Expectin sub $8100 within mere hours as predicted a few momehments ago.
Lol. Just checked the price. $7900 is feeble. Should be $7500 max after a dump of this magnitude. Here's to hoping I get some cheap BTC for the dollars I got selling my [luxury item] recently. C'mon short-bus! You got this! Give us your money! 
I will be back when $9000 is broken with conviction.

:) 
Oh well, there we go...new lows on both stamp and finex, breaking support.
Just a wild thought. Isn’t maybe that we’re losing buyers because the euro is in free fall?
opened a leveraged long here, bounce time
ah whatever, I enter a low leverage long here at 8235. Still think 8200 +-150$ is where the decision point is, then a bigger move up or down  

I also think it's time to start thinking more in sideways horizontal trading than catching big up or down trends and adapt
Looks like BTC is going to touch 8k right when ETH touches ~637. Next few hours will be ones to watch 
Great place to short, looks like we are heading to my predicted target of $8100. Once broken, $7.8k is almost certain, and if that doesn't hold, expect $6.3k within a week or two.
[deleted]
Tempted to open a 20x leveraged short here, shorting bitcoin hasn't looked this attractive since December 2017! Expecting the price to drop below $8.15k within mere hours, mainly because we failed to hold $8.4k yesterday - momentum is lost, bulls are losing ground, perfect storm for an epic crash. 
Possible H&S just completed?

anything under $8k is a dip buy-the-dip dip dip dip buy buy buy.
Looks like we will bounce once the new daily candle opens!

Good post.  I don't know your net worth, but if 2BTC represents 10 percent of it, I'd say that's a very good plan.
Great post!!  Really insightful charts.  Thanks

Risky option 4, to enhance option #1, for those with a smaller position and leverage to spare.  DCA if it bounces down from resistance, to either potentially be able to break even sooner, and give more buffer to be able to even just continuing to hold onto it when the break even threshold is passed.  This option can be dangerous though if it breaks up, so care is needed.   Then option 3 is plan B.
Recently it seems like we have been aggressively breaking down through support lines just to bounce right back in.

Example: When we broke below support line of ascending channel the first time around 8230 just for it to bounce back in 15 minutes later 

Yesterday: Broke below support line around 8350 just to bounce back in.

But the only difference is the buyers are having a rough time keeping the price above the support. It breaks down after a few hours of lingering above the support line that was recently broken back over. 
i'd be concerned if it passes 8250, otherwise nothing to worry about
I still think your short isn't a bad call, and your rationale is absolutely on point. However, I think it smarter to wait for confirmation in a rejection of support turned resistance, or to get a higher entry to minimize risk if things do head up again. Especially because volume has been so low, orchestrating fakeouts has become easier for the makers.

Personally, I think you'll be able to close in B/E or even in profit as I don't think this is the bottom, but it will definitely be a stressful one.

Ps: I thought you liked it when people disagreed? :)
At this point shorting feels like longing last year; Just hold it and you'll be fine eventually
i think u ignored the longer time frames for this small time frame trade. the price bounced on an established horizontal support: https://imgur.com/a/kpQLbDO
I agree with the trade and entry EXCEPT that BTC has burned me many times with a break below support without an actual candle close on the longer time frames below. I blame this on a combination of low liquidity and high leverage/Mex. Fake outs everywhere.

Almost everyone I know starts over with nothing or less than nothing more than once in their life. You will come out the other side of this stronger. Let the lessons you need to learn sink in over time. Don't regret anything. You've paid for an education that others cannot imagine.

Get up and start kicking ass.
Chin up, it will get better. It literally is only money, not family, friends, disease or anything that cannot be rebuilt. 

Please lick your wounds and then take long look in the mirror, reddit friend. Investment's are about managing risk, you will need to do this moving forward in any aspect of your life. 

Until then, you are OK. Consider posting this story in Bitcoin Beginners when you are up to it as a tail of caution for those who'd you like to help.
I sincerly hope you didnt trade with more than you can afford to loose, and that you have learned from this failure. I know I learned when I got liqed like 5 times in a row and lost 90% in like half a week but then traded my way back. Now keeping it small and trading smarter than before. But this is a golden opportunity to take some time off and focus on whats important in your life, bitcoin will be here when you eventually come back, a wiser trader.
Live and learn.  Better luck next time.

Next time, just buy, put it in a paper or hardware wallet, throw it in a drawer and forget about it for a couple years.  This is not a get-rich-quick scheme.  It's not for the impatient. 

And for the love of Pete, don't use leverage beyond what you'd be willing to put on a credit card at a casino.
Hopefully it's money you could afford to lose...

When did you start your long? 10x leverage?

The future is very bright in this space, I hope you'll be able to participate further \(without risking what you can't lose\)!

Fuck bro, I hope you are a young dude. Just try to live it up, find a nice chick and get laid or something. Live thru this to fight another day with the experience you gained.
lol on that leveraged long with borrowed money?

You lost money you borrowed by borrowing more money? Beautiful 

gotta be a troll, but honestly might explain the mindset of these mex futures traders 

e: in case you're serious. That really sucks and you have a gambling addiction. Please seriously consider getting help. You will be much happier without this in your life
This is really sad if true.  Guys, please stop gambling.  There are much more profitable and intelligent ways to invest in crypto.
I'm sorry to hear this. Aside from buying and selling some BTC back in 2013/14, I only got back into the market in Nov 2017. I had made 5x my initial investment and watched it all wither away back to break even between January and last month. Last month, when I dipped slightly below break even, I started margin trading and lost 90% of my stack in a very short period. I'm now trying to make it back slowly. There's not much I can say except:


1) There is more to life than money

2) You could still make it back if you remain level-headed

3) We're probably due for a technical bounce right about now 
> what have I done

fulfilled your destiny as a cliche? 
Sorry to hear that. No judgement. 

If this does not work out for gods sake don't even think of trading for a few weeks at least. Revenge trading will only lead to more losses as you desperately try to make it back. Been there done that.


Remain calm, keep returning here, people will support you. 
Shit, you okay man??
Words fail me sometimes to describe the stupidity which seems to happen within this sub on a regular basis 
Best thing you can do if this all goes south is realize that it happened, and train what you have: your body and mind. Go to the gym and the library, learn from it, and build it back. 
Your best bet is to work to make it back.

Don’t try to trade it back, it will most likely not work brother.

Do yourself a favor and just take a break from Crypto if this goes south.

Go out and get a second job (if you already have one) and start paying off that debt.

I really hope you learn a lesson here, regardless of how things pan out.
Troll?
For what it’s worth I’ve cancelled my trip to Paris just to buy more BTC, thinking we would bounce back to 10k this week. 
Long term I’m still confident, hopefully your situation will turn around
umm...

sigh...

my advice would be...

cut your loss...

start saving money...

wait for the next bull cycle...

we are going down imo.
Many of us tried to warn you about your poor risk management yesterday. Rekt by a margin call longing borrowed money... sorry for your loss. I hope you've finally learned your lesson. If you're not a troll, I'd walk away from the Bitcoin casino for a long while.

Just remembering how arrogant you were here a few days ago:

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8kae50/daily_discussion_friday_may_18_2018/dz7zcjh/

I'm guessing you're just trolling with all of this.
Brilliant analysis. I’ve noticed many large formations tend to fail with bitcoin. Recently falling wedges have been very reliable, although I am fearful of the symmetrical triangle we’re in being a continuation pattern downward. 
agreed
I will not surprised.
The question I always have is what is considered a breach. You wait for confirmation which means you are buying an oversold market, it drops 100 below but then slingshots back and you’ve actually shorted the bottom. 
You have balls of titanium to long here, dude. Respect.
so true and i've successfully bought every bull trap since 17k.  
Not to stroke my own dick here, but I made a joking max pain scenario couple of days ago, and it seems to be playing out quite accurately except for the timing haha. 

Of course I didn't take on it because I get high on the hopium.

TM*
Yes just like last year was the year of the "hodler", this is the year of the serial shorter.
well done if true
I am afraid so
Couple of thousand away from this not being funny
The suicide futures is now primed for x100 longing. Just as bitmex rekt must be on fire.
I think we are at panic atm
Is there a suicide rare pepe? How do I get in on this action?
Yeah, the, "Oh fuck! I just spent a billion dollars shorting Bitcoin and only drove the price down 250 bucks!" complaints are rampant.
I think it's a good call, I took 50% at 8250 too.  Missed a bunch of profits in some recent break-even trades not doing this.
Look my recent post a bit further down. It's a well known trendline and provides very strong support.
I did roughly the same thing, shorted at 8383.5, added to my short during a bounce very early this morning and closed it out for a little profit and then added more to my short at 8240, so my entry is now 8330ish but ive already locked in 1/5 or so of my paper gains.
My view is, *if* we can hold a higher low here it would give us a higher low on the daily chart.  And it would be a big deal as it would be the first step in confirming last weeks weekly candle as our "weekly higher low".  I think longing once it looks like the bounce is confirmed has a good r/r.  Im waiting for us to close over the 300 day moving average before entering.
I can't believe there has been zero bounce. Not one green 15min candle with substance. I wanted to add 20% to my position but this is ridiculous.
When do you plan on taking profits on your short? 

I assume you’re up a juicy amount right now 
What's brd, bgd, bgc?
RDs are small. They can only be small because Dumpy is a limpdick. 

We will see another BGD by Friday.  I have the feeling this dump is the, "Gimme my coins back by Chicago market close Friday" kind of dump.
i'm going long. Tight stop loss, low risk at strong support
I tripled down in the last bear flag, brought my small position to about 15%.  Manual stops didn't hit because I was taking a shit.

Doubling down between here and 7800 to take position to 30%.  Thats as far as I'm going with this as it feels too much like gambling.  Manual stop at 7600
Lol just posted the same thing you did below :-p let me know when you decide to YOLO
ETH to low 500 then? 
Look at all the shorters who got the same treatment shorting around 6400 last time. This market is no joke.
This is exactly why my money is on the sidelines right now. I don't trust this market, for right or wrong. Also, I am a swing trader, not able to jump in and out daily during work, a lot of you can take advantage I am sure, but not this guy. 
Welcome to crypto.
Charting ETH. It broke out of it's descending channel from local high and it's flirting with testing it as support like BTC.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/uScN0y3u/
Yeah it's all a bit confusing, though I'm seeing a nice hammer candle about to close on the 4H that could signal a reversal. Still some downside room on the 4h MacD, but RSI and stuff has more upside room, though not oversold. Think this'll be a waiting game again. 
Mex futures premium and funding rate continuing to increase as we move down doesn't really make sense. Honestly this seems like it's shaping up for a big dump now that most traders seem convinced it will never drop below $7k again. 

What are longs and shorts at? 


this is how 100x should be used
lower your expectations. don't be greedy !
Very risky trade. Good luck.
Congrats!
That is some sick gains you are trying to get there!
Updoot for bravery
Short 8230, Target 8500

I like pain 
That’s after going up from 4/10. Zoom out there is always a retrace all is not lost. We had to set a higher low on the weekly if we plan on going up.  If it stays above the 5/18 low this will have been a normal correction.  Even then if it dips below that as long as it stays above 6500 we are still in an uptrend.  Keep the macro view. 
Zoom in on any two-week period in Bitcoin's history and it will tell you precisely nothing about the overall market that month or year.
I know nothing about this, but it's interesting. I very much enjoy your charts/analysis. 

I'm just waiting for the kamehameha wave finishing move (BRD). 
How do you use ichimoku? I understand what the cloud and all of the lines are, but it seems so very unreliable. 

For example, it seems that edge-to-edge movements don't happen any more often than the price just turning back around halfway and going the way it came. Then introduce the different timeframes available to you and you have multiple sets of conflicting information.
The thing is, sooner or later we might see a macd cross on the monthly.


What time frame do you find works best with the Ichimoku?  I tend to look at the 4h or daily, but curious to see what other people find successful.
How is your chart showing a green daily candle there at the end (Bitfinex)?  My Trading View Bitfinex chart shows two red candles at the end.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/jQ7ITrdt/

And I just noticed that one year ago, we were at $2120.  That is a scary thought, for obvious reasons.
Trade Setup:

Stop 8130 - Break of pinbar low.

Targets 
1st 8440 - Possible HS formation.
2nd N/A Will let run on possible further continuation.

Edit: Trade Active - 19:08:17 GMT+0100 (GMT Summer Time)
Edit: Trade Stopped Out 8130
Everyone is gambling on what the other guy is gambling on.
Alts are getting hit really hard... Much harder than BTC. Diversified portfolios are taking big hits.
An extremely speculative one that has no real grounded quantifiable value
That's speculation for you.

Regarding your individuality question, I'd say BTC has the individuality and others are for the most part coupled.
Bots are running the show we’re just reacting. 
Sorry, what is BGD? Big green dildo?
Don't worry you will soon become a believer. 
You're right gdax volume hasn't been this low in consistently in weeks .
Panic sold everything. ;)
couldn't u say the same about not going above $8.6k? We're way closer to our local low than we are to our high too...
Thanks Jared! Like the look of that monster Inv. H&S.
Sorry but what is a "noob DCA" ?
Of course it can drop more, favourable lines on a chart doesn't change that

People have been calling the bottom since $16k using the same methodology 
A bit dicey opening a long on a descending support line. You can bleed into the red forever without breaking it. Much better to open a short on a break of it (in general), but that obviously hasn't go well either so far. 
The remaining buyers are running very low on little blue pills. 
sounds like you could use a BGD.

In terms of bitcoin, agree that buyers need to step it up
nice trade, I should have left my short longer open :\(
Good short, good long opp.... Good trades.... watching closely. Similar play from my end too! Kudos!
Ballsy AF.
[deleted]
I would have left the short open.
> bearish predictions are being bashed pretty hard by the community.

No one wants to be a bag holder, or sell for a loss. Many people are voting based on their positions, not based on logic or reasoning.

I was debating selling on the 6th. I held off till the 8th then started to  unload when it was apparent this was a prolonged drop. I looked all over tradingview and most posts were talking about a bounce and then a moonshot. I am pretty sure no one knows their ass from their face.


> Sentiment seems to be pretty bullish over there for the most part.

Try going to ethtrader if you want to see people in crazed bull mode  24/7. Very few bear opinions usually show up because they get downvoted hard.

I post in this sub mostly because people seem to have more logic in their posts, though sometimes bear comments do rack up downvotes.
Yup and everyone and their mom is longing $7.8-7.9k and they'll all close below $7.7-7.8k. 

Curious to see where this goes
Very nice move imo 
Yup my wedge is broken i cant figure out how to work it :( 
Yes by about $33 on Finex.
Yep, for the aggressive souls could be a good entry for a scalp long. There is a chance we enter freefall though for another 2-3%.  
7725 for me
depends where you shorted. are you in it to win it or are you in this for a short term scalp?

$8650+ is where I'd give up on shorting this. $8300-8350 would close some if not all but it could still turn around. 

but bitcoin doesn't let shorts off easy, you gotta work for it bub. There have been like 4 fakeouts now 
Depending where your entry is. 

I’m short from about $8240 on average and I would close just above $8200 ( $8225), 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/2PpXvAOW/

Breaking through where the arrow is pointing with conviction would be pretty damn promising for the bulls 

Edit: Bruh 50x Short at 8110. FOMO made you its bitch 
Where did you open it? 

Edit: 50x from 8110? Set that stop damn tight. 
Free money!
shorts are closing too
Everything is part of a cycle . . https://www.tradingview.com/x/SSgHDil9/
Well played! You'll get there mate
>I tried google but WTF is BGD? 

Big Green Dildo.

I may be greedy, but I'm setting stops higher. But if we do bounce, it should be here. Tapped the channel bottom: https://www.tradingview.com/x/CeJOTfo6/

We broke through enough meaningful support here though that I'm not convinced we'll go higher than 8125. My stops are going a bit above that. 

Edit: but I'm glad you had a green day.
Dude you close positions waaaay to quick and often. A break down here equals several red days. Why would you want to close when the impulsive move has started, while looking to position yourself for this move for days and getting chopped in the meantime? You are a good trader, but I really don't get why you would close a short now...
High-five👋
Curious why you didn't just move stops to break even? I know you've been wanting out all day (me too) but it feels like a good vantage point to be short from in case this goes lower? Or do you figure you'd just get uselessly stopped out on a technical bounce? I guess shorter timeframe RSI is getting a little hot. Debating whether to close my 8.2 short myself.

Edit: If there's one thing I respect about your trading style it's that it's (for the most part) calm and measured. Mine is desperate, which is probably why I lost so much when I first started trading, and why it continues to be (probably unwisely) as I try to make it back. So I appreciate that you're not too greedy and know the market will be there tomorrow to reassess and reposition yourself. 
I am thankful for your comments. If I don't know what the market is doing then I read up your profile and get a better picture. Appreciate that 
Congrats! now be careful about bragging.. bc the next trade the universe might want to seek balance.  :)
Those are always the best. I snagged 8135 at 50x on swaps (for pittance) but couldn't get my limit sell buy in (overload). I might just close here for a nice steak dinner. Beats a tuna sub!
We need to make a discord for 100xers and all create new accounts just to 100x. Link up in bitmex chat and see who can make the most BTC before getting liquidated. 

Or most ROE%. or just all start with $100 or 0.01 btc or something

it'd be very fun lol

yesterday I told veltrop I'd 100x short at $8390 if I was a 100xer...would've been a nice trade :( 

congrats btw 
Props!
Major props. It pays to be on the ball. Congrats man
Good on ya’ mate, for clicking that button very fast. Very insightful post ;) /s
As much as I want to believe your positions, they are extremely hard to believe. You always tend to find the top/bottom perfectly almost to the exact dollar..

The low on Kraken right now is 7860.3... and you got an entry within 3 cents. 

You’ve had some good trades in the past, but your entires just seem a little exaggerated. For someone to catch every top/bottom perfectly within a few dollar range is nearly impossible unless you’re a Chart god. 
yep, i just flipped switch cautiously from short to long. If we do see more downside from here in the very near future i dont think it will last long. Looking for a bounce up to 8/8.1 area and reassess there. 
I agree, price is crashing as I type this. Expecting sub $8.1k within mere hours. This doesn't look too good for bulls!
8195 on Finex may be as close as it gets.  Don't miss a bounce over $5.
Or just wait till $6k
Downward channel in a downward channel: https://www.tradingview.com/x/OHaF1IZ8/
at least you're honest in your motives.
Agree, looks like no buying steam. Few more hours max and we continue back down. Also short, and hopeful.
Yeah I'm also expecting a bit of a bounce here, nice trade!
I miss Dushmankush :(
Maybe he did like yolotrades? ;-)

That last peak is a higher high.

Current last peak is a lower high. 
if you are hunting small patterns on a larger patterns you can find an infinite amount although the timeline of bitcoin existence is not infinite. It is the small patterns hunting paradox.
This is so completely different, it's amazing someone would put those 2 on the same page.
Wait...there were Barts in 2016 too?
Mid-2016 market is hyped by halvening event. We don’t have it until 2020.
Does anyone have a version of this but with time/price scales?
I see a lot of bubble comparisons. But no one seems to remember 2011. That was crazy. From $32 to $2.
Seems like a bit of a risky entry. We're at the lower edge of the 4hr bbands, and we still have wedge resistance turned support at 8100-8000 right below us as (psychological) support. Plus StochRSI/RSI oversold on multiple timeframes. 

I have a feeling like this might be a fakeout to the downside. What's your target? And when will you cut it loose?
Shouldn't you wait at least for the test of the downtrend?

Or is it broken in your chart?
And the premiums are still madness. I ended up not getting stopped overnight, but I just readded what I took as profit last night just under 8200 (8275 june futs)
Short with a 1h RSI at 26? Wouldn’t you want to short from the top of the bounce?
Hoping for a sharp break below 8000, but I am skeptical that will happen today.  I think a bounce off of 8000 is more likely given the timid selling pressure and willingness of buyers to troll to catch a falling knife.  I know there is no technical reason for 8000, but I think bulls don’t like the idea of bitcoin dipping back below 8000 again.  

I kept my short open overnight with stops at breakeven, was glad to see I hadn’t been stopped out overnight.  
I did that too and did not expect this bounce as 8140 was broken.  I flipped and went long, but not confident about it.  I hate getting beat up from a lot of chop.
It has become a meme, a deus ex machina for underwater longs.
I can understand why people are scared, because this is Bitcoin, and the market is irrational.

Although this is lining up to go down further. We’re right back at the top of the BGD. Those with longs open before it happened are going to start thinking twice here to lock in profits. If you’re long from down there and not thinking about this, you’ve either balls of steel or forgotten you had the long open!
I agree, I was 100% alts as recent as last week and I started scaling out as I saw the ratio was dropping at an alarming rate and even sold some for a small loss. I'm currently 60% BTC and 40% FIAT and still in profit. If I wasn't somewhat of a permabull I would sell all my BTC as I think this is going to be a bad year for the crypto market. There is absolutely no reason why BTC will break ATH this year, organically. I thought the crypto market was getting slowly cleaned up with regulations but now it's apparent it's gone to complete shit as a viable investment. It's just become a game of if you can guess if price is going up or down. I think institutional money is coming in to play the same game but with higher wagers. Lots of people are going to get rekt. Bullish blockchain, bearish cryptocurrency. 
I agree. I’m just not seeing the selling pressure getting massively bought up like it was at $6500. In addition, even if a BGD did happen, it would either be much smaller or cost whales a whole lot more, since there are half as many shorts to squeeze here. If anything, people seem to be getting lulled into a false sense of security with longs. Maximum pain theory says longs get rekt, though I guess we’ll see. Accumulation and distribution can look quite similar.
Could pan out well for you, if it reaches 8130 i don't neccesarily see it stopping there.
So you're still seeing this as a wedge + fakeout rather than a descending channel?  

https://www.tradingview.com/x/QExVras8/

If you're looking to bail, it seems likely you'll get a chance to at your target. I'm still expecting this to keep dropping, especially if we get back there. 
I don’t understand this sentiment or your limit orders.  

So you entered a short at 8150 and it didn’t play out like you expected.  Fine, just close it.  I’ve seen you do that many times in the past.  It’s a tiny loss right now.  I Never thought you’d hold onto a position you don’t like just to hope to break even.

Then, if this does get down to 8120, wouldn’t you at least like to see if it breaks through support?  In which case your position isn’t so bad after all?   

Seems like putting a limit buy at 8130 and hoping it will fill goes against your general strategy of trying to be in the right position when big moves happen.  If that limit order does fill, isn’t there a pretty good chance you’ll be get out of position right before the big move happens?  

What do you think? Just doesn’t sound like your standard strategy here?

Only way this makes sense to me is if you want to reverse course and go long at 8130 because you expect resumption of the short term bull market and retest of 10k.  

oh, come on ( : 

so much drama around this sub, I felt like reading some older threads. 

August/September 2017 old. 

guess what. there was drama back then too. 

of course, general sentiment is not to be compared between the two, but come on - things like these are fluctuations, that, even when looking in the scale of months, are just noise. 
You're not going to tell us what the MA's are?
you will get rekt. ETH:BTC just broke out of wedge. the ratio will decline sharp from here. 
I hope its low leverage. If btc goes to 7800 then eth might test 600...
I think the head and shoulders pattern is complete: 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/zsvLj6P1/

This could potentially drag bitcoin down to XXXX 
It's going to take a lot of hopium to think that 6.9K or 6.5K is bullish once the price gets there. 
It’s for the better. After months of staring at charts it’s nice for a little break. Because when the next bull run is upon us, I know my productivity levels will be at an all time low.

Now you just set a few alerts, put your phone in your pocket and go do everything you wanted to do in November-January 
You can thank the continued decline in [Bitcoin Interest](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%203-m&q=bitcoin) for that. 
Yes the volatility has really decreased recently.  There were periods like this a couple of years ago, but last year was almost all volatile.  Maybe will return to that kind of action.  It was obviously better for trading.
>This market used to be so volatile.... But now it's so rare and we're lucky if we see 5% fluctuations a day. 

In any other market 5% daily fluctuations would be considered insanely volatile. The NYSE halts trading at 7% ffs
Man, after getting chopped up past few days with stupidities like opening two opposing positions at once, I opened a big short at 8210 this morning and was holding my breath all day. Can finally exhale a little bit and move stops to B-E. 
Waiting for 8150 on bitmex for fireworks.
And the trend continues.... buyers failing to hold support just to push above it and hold for a few hours... only to give up and let the bears take over. 

Shorting the bounce’s back into the channel and above support has been a pretty obvious move 
Looks like it broke
Good call. Eth seems to be trying to confirm it's h&s, if it's not already confirmed
Buyers are really reckless now. I won't be surprised if this bounces again just to drop later.

No, because you didn’t make any gains on it
It all depends on why you received the 0.15 btc.  Gift, sale of stuff, exchange for labor, etc.
yes you do, with a cost basis entry of $0 on the BTC
That explains the dump.
Good luck! 

peace.
Because it looks majorly rekt is probably why we can expect a bounce here. 
Well, if we can hold a bounce here it will be a higher low on the daily chart. That gives me confidence and I’d be happy to long that with a stop under last weeks low (7925).

A trade with targets of 8600, 8800, 9000 and 9300 that’s a decent R/R.
I'm waiting for real volume, or real misery.
Smart.  It's going down a bit more.  Somebody is extremely irrational and hellbent on giving us patient investors a bargain.

I'm buying at $7500 and lower.
What a LAD!
Then it's not rage quitting...
>On a side note, I'm curious what caused this drop. I haven't seen any particularly bad FUD stories in the news lately. 

Lack of FOMO between here and the 9ks. Plus giant market sells into walls every time we creep up (wash trading?).

It seems to me that both buyers and sellers are skeptical of every pump/dump due to all the barting, leading to a lack of follow-through in either direction. I think we are going to be stuck in this range for quite a while, moving mostly sideways.




Well, haven't we been falling since December? In the big picture, it's still that.

Maybe it's just me, but this latest pump seemed artificial as hell. No volume at all, then these 1000coin green candles. Didn't work at 8500 tho.

The dump seems a bit more "organic", if this can be said about BTC market at all. I mean, there are some smaller stairs down and gradual drooping, not only big red dildos.

But then again, my long termbelief is that this will go down a lot more before finding its "real" price, so my opinion is subjective. 
https://www.tradingview.com/x/Rom9Uua8/

Idk fam that seems like a solid 13 inch erect BRD to me. 

Not sure if we are gonna get another one that size quite yet 
Months to years for me.  But I rage quit on a yearly basis until this iteration and only stuck to it in bursts before, and am overemotional.

Breaks are good though, market did cycles during them which further helps hindsight.

Edit, and it's not off topic!  

> Quick questions that do not warrant a separate post

depends how emotional you are. basically the less emotional you are the quicker you'll get better at trading. if you sold the top and bought low you're already on a good path. Keep your TA simple, since it seems like your trades are already profitable
Read a lot and practice. Best thing to do is also to try out some trading on testnet or make a fake portfolio to try out strategies and see if you anticipated the market well. 


I got in at 400; I still feel like my trading is simplistic. But the days of 1/2 my savings disappearing into bitbond, or going long on bitfinex during bitfinex hack then panic selling their tokens are gone.

I would suggest fake trading for long past the point your comfortable 
Really depends on the trader. Took me a year and I have an obsessive personality. So it took less time for me than it takes others. To me, you can't be a successful trader until you have what I call a "deep understanding" of this market. That means you know how the masses react in certain situations, you know the manipulation that can take place and at what technical set-ups its most likely to occur at. You start to recognize when to use automatic stop losses, and in what situations to use manual stop losses because you notice its trading in a tight range with a high probability of stop loss hunting. All of this knowledge comes from watching the charts. And you don't even have to be in position to learn from it. First learn the book knowledge: chart patterns, indicators, general market theory. Then just chart watch. Draw up your TA and watch how the market follows  it (or doesn't follow it). You'll learn what works more than 50% of the time and that's where you find your edge in the market. The edge is where you make your living.
This week marks a year since I started learning TA (which was applied to the stock market, I didn't discover crypto until late August).  I've read books, forums, taught myself Python, wrote and backtested literally thousands of strategies, for probably more than 1-3 hours a day, and I still don't know what I'm doing.  The fact that I got into crypto when I did was both a blessing and a curse.  It is easy to think you have it figured out when everything goes up, but it just masks bad habits and thought processes that become painfully obvious when things turn bearish.

EDIT: Also, I personally don't recommend much in the way of paper trading.  If it works out, you'll just regret missed opportunities, and its easy to be ballsy with your trades when you know there is a reset button.  I'd only trade with a very small amount (enough that you'd be OK with losing) while learning.
Yes it is unanswerable, because depends on the market, which you can't control, and also of course how fast you take to it.   If the market isn't very volatile or gets more manipulated and more difficult to trade, then who knows.

It took me a long, long time to get profitable with trading.  I don't know that you need 1-3 hours per day studying TA though.  There is only so much to that and a lot of Occums Razor and if you dive too deep into it, it is counter productive.  

Anyway I wish could give you better advice, but you really don't know how you will do until your money is on the line and you have to try to think rationally. It sounds like you have already done some good trading though with selling near the top and buying back much lower.
I have no idea your mining setup, but I'm mining Eth over 1 GH/s (35 GPU's), and I am profitable to about $320/Eth at current diff @ 14 cents/Kwh. I've been mining since Jan 2017, although I sold half my equipment in Sept. 2017 (had almost 2 GH/s at one point).

If you're mining BTC, I can only assume you have a large operation, are mining on old equipment that already paid for itself, or are mining on newer Antminers that will likely never pay for themselves.


What do you have going?
Only to fomo back @ $8600 in <1week.
Long 8098.5 (Market bought cuz I’m lazy)

40k contracts

Stop loss 7725
good luck i hope you guys caught it...i am waiting for a retest but who knows maybe i missed the bus/rocketship !
Isn't it too early? What do you base your assessment on? I'm looking at 8000 if it will hold or not in the next few hours, as an important watershed. Edit: Good luck, whatever you do!
I thought that volume needed to decrease on patterns like this, but here you can see increasing volume. What would you make of that?
I'm curious as to why the R/R is terrible for shorts alone. We're still in the 1D price coil, and if it were to break down *or* up the potential movement could be extreme
Listen to this fella. The r/r is terrible. Do not buy BTC. Wait.
It doesn't matter where you open a short.  It either makes sense to be short or long at any time.  You are saying one should cover a short and go long here for a bounce.  That isn't crazy advice, but I am staying short, because more likely to drop $500 or $1000 than shoot up that amount in the next few days.
If you're willing to assume 2% risk, 7900 with stops below 7750 makes a decent amount of sense. 
Yeah I’m also keeping an eye on eth but it’s looking pretty juicy for a scalp long right now. 

I’m also looking at BTC but I haven’t seen the capitulation wick yet, so I’m going to wait for that. 
the real ascension to the next level is when you are more happy that a trade was right than the actual gains or losses from it
"Really? I spent 45 mins. looking at charts and drawing lines last Thursday just to make $200? Pathetic."
Most of the emotion of it has drained out for me...maybe too much, because I don't get frustrated about losses now unless they are huge or if i really screw up.


You might not have to wait long! I added a ton to my short against my better judgement and so far it's working out ;)
Well played dude. I still have 60% of my short and want to see this through before I take any more profits. 
Nice one there, thank you for the insight.
Do you have a target for your main short, or you're trying to ride it straight into goblin town?

Meh, the chart does say something as the price action and the trends in there do have a pretty strong correlation. Though it’s not the best indicator of coming price action, it’s still something I keep in mind 
Is the yellow line the Mcafee line?
I’m on mobile, where’s your trend line at?
Yikes, here we go.
2 more sentences and we will be dealing with single digit BTCUSD...
Are you short or long? How can you be up from 8500?

Why not cover part of your entry to lock in proft then let the rest ride?
I think as long as people are scared of a BGD it won't happen. It only happened because no one was afraid of it. Hence the 40k shorts...we're still under 20k on bfx.

June and Sept futures premiums have moved down like...0.1%

We'll probably get a small bounce here but really we can remain oversold on lower time frames for quite a while. I checked last time the 1h rsi was this low and it was after $13-11.3k. less than a day later it hit $9k...


Wait are you long or short? You said you're up? 
BGD possible but unlikely, I think we are heading to test at least 7.4k, maybe 7.2k.
I am not an active trader but there’s always a small bounce before plunging down further. May be wait for that? With a stop loss at 7800 since everyone seems here to be agreeing that it doesn’t look good below that.

Also I am not holding any position right now. All out in fiat since the BGD that brought us to 8k from 6.9k.

Long from $8500

Wow, just wow 
Biggest thing missing is the 40k shorts. That's a big difference.
Look everyone, it's the "This looks like the pattern of April 1-12" post of the day.

We have that kind of post absolutely every day for two weeks now..
It's the new trend after the "2014 bubble" same pattern.
feel like I've seen this comment several times in the past few weeks and it's never been particularly good advice 
6k will have trouble holding

this is ethbtc, your in a bitcoin thread.
People posting about BGD get voted down. People posting about 7500 get voted up. Looks like most people here are short and vote according to their position.

Otherwise why isnt this downvoted for not having an analysis to back up this claim?
So... you're saying the next 24 hours are critical.
the next 24 hours are the short term trend
Rip
Yes the alts are dropping so much faster than BTC, and of course the opposite will likely be true when BTC starts to move significantly higher (maybe someday).

But I am finding that I have to short about 120% of BTC to cover my alts holdings and still I lose money on these drops.
Cryptomarkets aren't zero sum. Plus there's absolutely no barrier to entry for spinning off or forking off a new Alt coin. Therefore market dominance is probably the least useful ratio in existence
Alts fall faster but gain faster, I think it comes out ahead for alts honestly.  And if you miss those few days where they zoom and take off when BTC shows signs of life, you miss a huge part of the gains.
Interesting...I had drawn a trend-based fib extension on what I thought may have been the first two waves down from the recent high at 8640...it gave me a target of this final wave of around 7940 which is my line in the sand before 7k possibility 
If this thing breaks back into the Channel i will question my existence 
It's back under the resistance line of the wedge it broke out of the other day btw.
yikes
Wait for the resistance to be broken before entering a long. I have it @8030 
I don't think it's a good time to enter a long (and it's almost never a good time to enter a short) so you should probably consider yourself lucky.  
I suck at explaining things, and there's been something that I've been struggling with for a little while as to what counts as a falling wedge.


Since I suck at explaining, I made an image which shows my thoughts.



https://imgur.com/a/g12KQm5



Can anyone help clarify or tell me that I am right or wrong? Because I think I'm right but I wanna make sure.
I do agree, though I wouldn't exactly call it momentum. There's almost no momentum either way. 
no it hasn't.

0.1% is barely exchange fees.

Been sad for nearly 6 months now. Bear market is long and cold and painful. Can't wait till I change my flair to Bullish if we break 11,700 with conviction. 
What's so special about 7.4?  I would have said 7.2.
Good luck man
There's a LOT of longs currently open that are underwater that were opened near our 10k top. They don't close as quickly as shorts though, so they'll probably stick it out and not close with a minor drop of a couple of hundred pnts. 
What are longs at now? 

but yeah...futures premium at $190 for September still...2.5%. 

like...at $16k that's an entire $400 premium. I think that's what futures were back then right?! it's insane how confident this market is sometimes
I bet a ton of longs are sitting with liquidations below $4k. Holy crap, just think of the cascade that would happen if we were to ever approach that level.
Charts indicate past, not future.

In December, people would have told you the charts indicate $250K by June 2018.
The path forward I see is this:  Since hitting the ATH and the low of $6000 in early Feb, we've been creating a tightening pattern with higher lows \($6500 in March, $6700 in April\) and lower highs\( $11,700 in Feb, $10k in early May\) ...now looks like we're going down to form another higher low likely around $7k.  If this pattern continues, we'll likely squeeze ourselves into a very tight range sometime in late June/early July.  From there a breakout would be very violent and if to the upside, could get us back to $20k.
I looked thoroughly at the charts and I can say with 100% certainty that there is a *possibility* that we hit 20k this year. 
It looks like the charts are neutral for now, and the destination is not written in stone but supply/demand will be tested for a while.
The charts aren't, but the tea leaves are.

Dried rabbit knuckles are unclear. 

(Hint: No one knows. No chart could possibly predict that.)
No one can tell you what the price will be in 6 months. That is fiction. Some make outrageous claims in part to bring newbies into this because it's in price action's best interest not necessarily yours.
Sure, also a possibility of it hitting 2k
no
Be embarrassed , We are fighting crumbs over here.  keep those dreams away!
No I dont see it unless custodial and AML issues are fixed for institutions 
No, 0.00000000000% possibility of that happening, according to the chart.
RSI on daily is not even close to oversold. Longer timeframes hold more weight. What timeframe are you looking at?
yeah I'm boutta get that sweet 1% bounce. bulls on Parade! 
What're you talking about? The bull market never ended! /s
u keep that short open?

and lol yea that's  actually the logic some ppl  are using here 
I'm thinking horizontal supports are probably more important than diagonals right now. The main support level to look at imo is the 4hr low of 8170, which is also near the .5 fib, 1h rsi is nearing oversold as well so we should see a bounce soon. If we don't set a higher low above 8170 then I think 7.9-8.6 was just a dcb. 

>Futures premium keeps on growing....

I wouldn't read too much into that. September futures on Bitmex has very little liquidity, and does not usually follow spot very closely. 
Eth is straight up shitting the bed atm, so I think we’ll get to see a retest of 8.1 real soon...

Walk through the trade possibilities on both sides, in your mind from both perspectives. 

Tell us why it is crazy to long support lines, while short traders (or long entries) hold off for confirmation of the move downward.

If we break below this downtrend it will be so ironical. Everyone was expecting an uptrend to 9k when we broke above it few days ago :\)
[deleted]
futures premium and longs are increasing the entire way down. I am pretty sure you are trading with the majority of derivatives and margin traders 
risky is an understandment 
I think both longs and shorts are viable now, if you time good entries and do not get to greedy. 
Small, low leverage long on both BTC and ETH, with the idea of a scalp and a flip into short at the top of the bounce.

ETH oversold up to the 4 hour, expecting bulls to attempt to protect the head and shoulders neck line.

BTC also oversold, but up to the 2 hour, expecting bulls to try and protect against a lower low.

EDIT: Tripled down on both at 7975. Tight stops!
What bubble? I think you vastly underestimate global demand.

Problem is manipulated or not, nobody wants bitcoin at these prices. Volume is my number 1 indicator
If we were in an uptrend, I'd buy the shit out of this dip with the indicators being this overbought. But, I got a feeling we ain't see nothing yet even after this massive rekt. Even if we are done rekking, I'm sure we still gotta consolidate for awhile before a real bounce.

I don't know shit though, so good luck catching the bottom.
Click the gear button and change theme to light.
Good stuff, this can get ugly on a dime, though there are some indicators that we might turn up a bit again too. Either way, definitely a place to manage risk and not be overexposed.

She was threatening to ride the largest roller coaster at the local theme park, and I just couldn’t let myself allow her to do it

You could say it was a life saving surgery.. She now has a penis, and I’m starting to wonder why all my long socks have been wet after her door has been closed for over an hour. 

That being said, if Bitcoin goes to 100k, her penis will be worth $1,500,000. I would probably cut it off and sell it to National Geographic for historical purposes

yes they're all connected. 

there's a theory out there that tether is used to pump alts so big players can dump their bags on noobs and then convert to btc, which they probably dump for profits.

Better than most, though. Better than I could expect for a random agglomeration of folkes betting on a mostly unregulated market.

Buyers really don't seem to care that much. 

Particularly on Bitmex. 

June premium was back up to $120 a minute ago.

There seems to be zero concern that this could do anything but rocket up from here.
Not one ounce of this entire range has been pretty

I think we should see a 7800-7900 wick with a good bounce back up to 8250 followed by a bullflag that touches 8100 before either breaking up or down
Good choice 
Ehhh wouldn't that rather mean that we're gaining buyers or at least that we're gaining sellers? 

If you would want to hedge than BTC or USD are good. Staying flat would be the dumbest thing in that case. Yes EURUSD is fucked right now but it's close to bottoming in my opinion. TA says 1.16-1.17 is support. Yes BTC/EUR is a shitshow but it does represent only a tiny fraction of the market.



Nah, wouldn't that mean there WOULD be buyers in some other scenario you could dream up?

Crypto isn't tied to FOREX markets in any reliable way, and if you think they are the burden of proof is on you, my friend. Pull some FOREX data and show how when a particular fiat tanks, it was directly related to crypto movement with some sort of statistical significance.

Even though I completely agree with you this doesn't help anyone trade right now. If you are trying to give yourself a pep talk to make yourself feel better I think doing something else entirely, e.g. playing a game or watching a movie, would do better at that then stress and tell yourself all the reasons why BTC will moon in the coming years.
Nobody's holding you back.

"Buy the dip!" - A 2014 movie coming to a theater near you.
I just added at 8350 (June). This will be an expensive one to cut over 8300 (spot) if we break up. 
Buying behavior has been pretty strange the past few days. 

Like you said, support is breaking down and buyers are ignoring it. 

Futures premiums are rising with every dip instead of declining. And then rising again when the market bounces. 

June futures were up to around $120 following that V recovery off of $8,119. 

And then buyers just give up without warning, like we just saw at $8,230. 
> Example: When we broke below support line of ascending channel the first time around 8230 just for it to bounce back in 15 minutes later

Yes I remember that one and it faked me out, just like this one did.

I miss the old BTC market where the price would break resistance and then plummet 10% in minutes. It was so easy to trade that drop and then the bounce.  Too bad I was so under capitalized back then and my big % gains were not really that much in BTC or fiat terms.
I do like when people disagree.

I don't like when they're correct in their disagreement ;).
Mex is freakin disaster. You can't wait for good entry, cause you won't be able to enter when you should.
I've been holding my short from 81xx for a week now. Never felt so philosophical in my life 😂
Until it doesn't go back down...
I was definitely thinking short term there. 

Although I'd make the same trade again given the information I had at the time.

Anytime I have an opportunity to short a breakdown of a descending support line (or long the breakup of an ascending resistance line), I'm going to make that trade 10 times out of 10. Short or long term.
At this point I'm likely going to suffer through option #3 and exit if $8,300 breaks up.
or an air traffic controller
are you flying soon?
People rarely learn from this. Have known enough gambling addicts to know that losing everything is just the start of the next fix. 

And hanging out in a community of addicts, who will keep giving you pep talks about "you will learn and be better off for it" doesn't help.

If what this guy says is true - that he lost everything today - the advice should be to get some fucking professional help.

trade from one swap will wipe out trades from other swaps and other coins so leverage is pulled from all positions and everything gets stressed till maximum and then it can go to zero in one shot.

He got in around $700 and lost all of it. I have a feeling he won't really be participating even if it goes to $50k.

Unfortunately he either has a gambling problem or he took "buy the dip" way too seriously.
Somehow that doesn't seem comforting, friend.
[deleted]
Technical bounce really? The charts look bearish as hell... Eventually, by 2022, I do believe we will reach a new ATH but that is a few years away.
>keep returning here

To be flung back & forth in the fickle sentiment? Whenever I'm trading heavily & following this sub it's like every candle is personified & skewed toward overreaction. I'm not sure that I would recommend this sub to someone with a trading addiction &/or finance management issues.
Or he could gamble a bit more
[removed]
Situation doesn't turn around quickly when you get margin called and your collateral was all borrowed money. OP didn't set stops, went all in and was overleveraged. Any one of these taken on its own is stupid beyond belief - combine all three and you have a bona fide gambling degenerate (no offence OP). He needs to solve his gambling addiction / piss poor risk management before he goes within a hundred miles of BTC ever again.
Titanium? It's just a position, man. Not over-leveraged, made with good reasoning, and with an exit plan in place.

Turned out OK, as of now. Starting to de-leverage, and leave open a sizable position with a stop at break even down at the bottom.
7600 with a small fast bought up dip around 7200-7350 could be a quite probble scenario yes
looks good so far!
all i can say is that my posts have shown my bearish read on the market...i will not be showing proof on this one

good luck out there 
Yup 
Don't worry, it will never not be funny. It will look even funnier a couple years from now.
Ah, just saw your post.

I haven't been paying attention to here as much in recent days so maybe its been more talked about, but I haven't really seen it mentioned too much before that. The less steep one from 5.4k -> 6k -> 6.4k is the one I've seen that's on everyone's charts. I still think that one, given its comparably low angle, is the more important support.
Nice trade. I’m trying to be more disciplined and not overtrade, so I’m going to try and hold onto this one until the end of the week. I should have held on since 9.2 a couple of weeks ago, but it’s always good to lock in profits!
Look at the weekly though. Stinks of a DCB to me.
We hit the support line and just sort of...whiffed into it. No real bounce, but we're moving sideways across it now. 
I've been scalping $100 movements on swaps. 8110 to 8020, holding one from 8010 right now with stops just over 7900. I'm not looking to close my main short for a while. 

Edit; stopped out of the scalp at 7906
I'm not him but I shorted 12500 contracts at 8383.5, as we have been going down I've opened more shorts after breaking supports and closing out before it reached the next support. Im at about .07 realized .08unrealized. Short 20000 contracts now with blended entry price of 8130.
Big red dildo, big green dildo, big green candle. Basically a large percentage change in the price within single candle width. Usually 3% or more within a 1h candle.

[This](https://www.tradingview.com/x/P2aAvAgg/)  Bearflag? 

Seems like we may paint one again. 
Hmm, it doesn't look particularly bearish to me yet as it can just be a retrace for a larger bullish swing to challenge the high again. I'm not buying into yet though as I want to see the horizontal resistance around $640 to see whether or not it pans out to be a large descending triangle or a huge bullish pennant as it's better r/r for me.

BTC is actually holding up pretty well compared to ETH as it's only responded to its down-move the equivalent of 70%, and I think only a move that breaks down ETH's neckline of the large H&S that might have formed can send BTC down below its current low at 7900. 

For a short-term trend reversal here and continue our bullish swing I'd like to see BTC close above 8250 today and ETH to stay above 670. 


Longs 32300 (and climbing, 31500 morning low)  
Shorts 20150 (and dropping, 20775 morning high)  

Not significant moves, but there are so many longs underwater here.   

On 5/2, we were at 25,500 longs and the price was 9200. Longs have gone up 30% as price has dropped 10%. 
Longs increasing, shorts decreasing 
Took profits too early.
Ya I mean nothing is fool proof, I would say edge to edge is probably my least favorite although some traders like it.  I think it's more about just learning about it and how it all works and then coming up with your system.   It's great for finding support and resistance levels, a big picture look and just kind of where the price wants to gravitate towards in my opinion.   Well different timeframes will give you different pictures because they're different time frames, so short-term could be bullish and long-term bearish.   Higher time frames will give you more reliable results, I trust 4hr and day waaaay more than 15min or 1hr, but you have to be prepared to wait out longer time frames, people get inpatient. Here is a good [chart](https://imgur.com/a/KqWZq0r) for timeframes.   
Sooner than monthly we will see a macd cross on the [weekly](https://twitter.com/GenghisSperm/status/998244460738760706).
Ya, I usually use 4hr and daily but like I said in the other post you have to be patient with those time frames to play out, they take awhile.   I usually go down to 1hr when I want to find my entry for my 4hr or daily play. 
its inverted and yes it is ! go back four months more and we we're down at 750 
True but the ecosystem has radically changed since then. Not that this is a guarantee that those prices can't be reached again, but the currently value exists in a rather different scenario.

To provide only one indicator is the expansion of the mining ecosystem: https://bitcoinwisdom.com/assets/difficulty/bitcoin-hash_rate-all.png?1526986203
Yes
Don’t you know that “critical support” is always 200 dollars under current price? That’s what I’ve seen from reading daily threads in past few months! Hope that’s true tho.
Here's the latest

Also, people who called the bottom at 5,8 have been right for over three months... not that it's relevant to what I wrote.
That's kinda a non-sequitur. Did you read what I wrote?
If you're looking for a long entry (which I currently am), anything that serves as a potential bottom is a good bet.  I would prefer not to short these levels, as trends in either direction haven't been particularly long lived as of late.

You could do worse than longing the low 8100s, with a 30min RSI in the low 20s, and having been at 8600 just 24 hrs ago.  The market *could* continue descending along the support, or even break through it, but the R/R is fairly solid if you're in a bullish mindset.
If you take a look at the chart with a little imagination, it looks like an ad for the product you mentioned.

Hey, thanks. I learned my lesson on the jump from 8.4 to 8.8. Bailed on it at 8.7 and shorted again at 8.4. If I had just held on, I wouldn't have lost what I did. I gained a large chunk back here. The long I opened is only about half of the short I just exited, though.

One thing to keep in mind is that in this market Bitcoin almost always gives second chances. If you miss a good long/short, you'll get another chance if you patiently wait a bit. Wish I listened to my own advice!
cryptowat.ch or tradingview.com 
Yep. I usually browse ETHTrader for entertainment, but the sentiment is just too bullish right now and it just seems a bit delusional to be honest. I've been spending a lot more time here, r/ETHTraderPro and in r/ETHInsider where people seem a lot more level headed and logical.
Oh, here we go with the "bag holder" talking point again.  There will be bag holders, but they won't be holding bags of Bitcoin. They'll be holding bags of traditional securities that have been pumped through corporate debt/stock buybacks over a period of ten years.
.... I'm confused, since when am I more bearish than anyone?
Got any read on this, Sloppy? Fell thru 8k like it was nothing.
I had it as a channel, which was only wicked.
Some for the entertainment, some for the learning. I'm new to this.
I think it will go down, so I'm wondering if I should have a stop in the higher 8100s, or leave it open and risk getting liquidated @ 8233.
Thanks. Yeah, I got a bit hot headed there. It's not a lot of money, but I still want to get thing right.
8110
Thanks man.
Long/short ratio was definitely still tradeable since I had been using it for a few weeks leading up to that point. It was used in many of the barts leading up to the BGD. However, I will say, people definitely became more aware of it after the fact. The scary thing for me now is that the long/short ratio has been increasing as the price continues to decline. If anything, longs are at the greatest risk of exposure here.
Oh great. Now we have PGC to add to the list. So many TLAs.
If it matters at all, this is the play I'd be doing as well. Good luck 
One thing I will say is that I'm increasingly thinking of people who are following my entries, which I never paid much attention to in the past. 

I'd much rather someone miss out on profit than wind up taking a loss. 

That certainly played a role in my decision to exit here. 
RemindMe! 4 hours
The bounce is coming.  RSI bottoming out.


It looks like he closed it right before the bounce started. He could reshort right now and get a higher entry than where he covered it.

What many people here don't realize is that after you close a position, there is no mandatory waiting period of hours or days or weeks before you can reopen a position in the same direction.
Because he hasn't got a clue what he's doing and just flip flops continually
I’m assuming when you absolutely hate a position and hate yourself for opening a position on a fake out, you can’t wait to dump the bitch even if it’s cutting profits early 
Thia is just the universe balancing out all of my previous complaining.
This again. I clarified 100 times already that I'm from europe and am trading BTC/EUR which is a bit more liquid. I give BFX data to give an overview of my entry.  I'm not gonna convert every entry to USD. EUR/USD is way to volatile to do that. Instead I just give the point I entered @BTCEUR that corresponds to BFXs BTC/USD price.

If you must know I entered @6693€. This was when Finex was @7850. I even gave a 10$ premium above that price because Kraken tends to have a 10-20$ premium @ the moment. I'm sorry if you think I'm lying. I am able to confirm every trade with a screenshot if that is an absolute must.

My entries are not always this perfect. But I have a knack to get in @really good times. You can even compare the time my reddit comment was posted to the price on bitfinex at that same time. They usually are within 10-20$ of each other. Due to BTCs volatile nature that is a given though.

> ...range is nearly impossible unless you’re a Chart god. 

This is not true at all. The chart is one thing. You also have to develop an instinct for price movements to catch bottoms and tops. Everyone can follow TA. Wicks below support and resistance are caught by some people based on gut feeling.
8k is the safer profit target. But if we pass through the descending support the odds are good that we'll see low 8200 again.
Do you have nothing better to do?
Bit-ception 
Sometimes trading is too easy.  I realize that I make it so much more difficult than it is...with dumb mistakes and laziness and lack of focus, etc.

And whether is bounces here or not, doesn't change the fact that it was clearly the right call to make.

I should have covered more of my hedge short at the low for a more aggressive long, but still have a bear bias here and the price could plummet at any moment with more bad news.  So I never open too large of a long, no matter what.
Agreed on that.
How could anyone miss a perma troll like that.
Sloppy said he was going to write a lil somethin somethin to see if the mods can lift the ban 


Can he Yolo back into this sub? 

I miss his pole and balls T.A 
Consolidation has a positive slope then.

Consolidation has a negative slope now
Are there different time frames do you have the time frames that they are fairly interesting looking fractal but I don't put much faith in it
because no one was here. if I bought btc in 2011 I'd be rich as fuck and I would likely not spend my time here unfortunately 
I'd cut it loose above $8,200. 

Since it's a wedge breakdown, my position either improves over time as the support-turned-resistance line descends, or the market invalidates the breakdown and I exit. 
A wedge breaking down is one of the best shorting opportunities possible. 

Because the former support line is descending, the risk of the entry is quite low. If the market pulls back above support, I simply exit for a small loss. 
Oh it's definitely the meme du jour. Seen a couple who are short scared of it too though.
I just want out of this position honestly. 

Futures traders are still in full bulltard mode. And that isn't likely to change even if the market drops below $8,100. 

If I want to re-enter a short, traders there should give me plenty of liquidity to do so – albeit at a slightly worse entry.
You convinced me to pull my orders. For better or worse :)
You are correct, it's not what I'd normally do. And I already removed the limit orders. 

As for why I haven't closed it yet, the market is still respecting the resistance line of the wedge. So I'm just going to hold it until it breaks for now.
This is a trading sub. Expect trend lines to be referenced. 
That's all well and good if you're a\) holding without trying to increase your stack through trading and b\) 100&#37; convinced the price will go up forever. In which case, well, I'm not sure if a sub devoted to trading is a good choice.

I, on the other hand, enjoy making more money actively than I could passively and increasing it through something other than blind faith.
sorry, they are 9,26 , also bitfinex default values  I have liked for a long time for some reason
Yeah I jumped on that short have profit targets down to .3 btc
Its nothing rlly but for some reason i dont think btc will test 7800 - gotta try your luck sometimes
https://www.tradingview.com/x/vsrjm2F7/

Then this would complete 
at 8k btc with 6% ratio, eth should be $480 right now. The fact that its still over $600 is a testament to how well eth has resisted dropping in price.

I assume we're going to see a 5-6% ratio again real soon.
That is a very true statement. But those are still some possible targets right now at least.
I remember being relieved at the deadness when we hit $6.5k to $7k. 

but now I'm just bored and miss it :(
You got it in reverse. Volatility -> interest
There's an interesting correlation with futures markets opening and reduced volatility.  Uranium and Gold off the top of my head.  Not into the tin foil hat stuff but the correlation is worth noting.
Yes, do that. Buyers are absolutely batshit insane right now. 
You sure got them.
I've done 3 iterations of adding to the short and taking profits in the last 30 hours :)

Didn't perfectly get every top/bottom, and did a some orders in the flats, but did well enough.  The week of paying for trying to get into a good position finally paid off.
Indeed. Now the technical bounce. Let's see if the insane buyers push this all the way back to 8140.
So is the car BTC's price or our ROE...
Cost average. You're basically right, though. If I have 4 entries, it's my average entry (weighted). 
[deleted]
yes true but what kind of bounce, can't imagine there will be much followthrough
yes i guess, just don't buy into it much anymore. every time theres some hope on the chart it gets squashed, every single time. im suffering from battered bull syndrome
Ya, that's a good point...

Rage Quitting 101

Don't do it?
Yeah I was meaning a daily candle/s the same size as the April BGD but in reverse
Thanks.
I have been trading with 10% of my stack most of the time I have invested. And 90% of trades I have won. 

But only because of 1 reason - I trade small volume coins with large spreads/swings,  without basically ANY TA knowledge, just getting to know a coin , the trend and trading..

1 good thing has come out of it - I can trade with no emotion 99% of time. Went all in fiat today at 8200 I think, reading the comments here to decide my next action lol

I want to trade with margin, like some of the profitable traders here,  but I know that my knowledge level is non existant for that.
I have a small mining rig mining ETH with about 100 MH/s. Its more of a selfpaying hobby atm. But after ETH goes below 500-600 USD i wont sell and just hold what I gain to save for the next bullrun. But for the time beeing i live in a student apartment with fixed rent and pay the same amount every month so I kind of get free ish electricity. i.e I pay the same anyways.
L Daddy back in the game.

Let’s make that .07 BTC gains again and make the taxi driver blush 
You got spunk, man, I like it. 
you probably did not ;)
the r/r, looking for a ghoulish bounce on a repeat bottom. also when everyone is calling for 7.8 it’s smart to play your hand a little early 
The wedge is on the 12 H. You can see volume is dropping there. The 1 H wedge is more of a fractal of the larger one, IMO.
Lol, this comment is ridiculous. Of course it matters whether you're short or long, where your liqui is and how much you're carrying on margin. How can you possibly argue that "it doesn't matter where you open a short" and have the gall to call *other people* confused.  
>It doesn't matter where you open a short.


Tell that to the thousands of liquidated shorts that got squeezed on April 12.
My game plan had been to long at 7.9k for a double bottom but ETH has shown that it is far from done shitting the bed.  I can't imagine BTC successfully confirming a double bottom in that environment when longs already greatly outnumber shorts.  That also said, yes I am still itching to get in long. 
the money is awesome but being right is the best

Yes good point and I am sometimes happier losing 2% than gaining 5%.  It just depends on how well I managed the trade and if I made the right decision.
We know losses are just part of the job description.
Holy s#!tsnacks
That was risky, but glad it worked out. I almost did it myself when we were hovering 8090. What is your CA?
If that was all the bounce off 7900 we're getting, oh lordy. 
It's a long play. If we break down hard (sub 7600), I'll probably cut it at 7800 if we come back through. 6800-7200 is my initial target if the BGC from 4/12 reverses. 
Dude if we continue going bear 2014 style most alts can go -80% easy
Kinda worried that if we do break those longs we would have to go down to 6-7k, and at that point I don't wanna long lol    
Hoping for a clean breakout this or next week, would save us a lot of pain and time.  
When did I post that? Must have been like 2 months ago :D
Yes 😇
The Mcafee line would look like a severed penis 
The green one? At around 7800.
You think so ;)
I don’t understand the terminology. I bought in at 8500 and am usually watching gdax every 5 minutes but life happened so I didn’t realize it dropped until today at work but didn’t have time to read anyone’s TA or here until tonight. So now I’m not sure what to do. 
I meant I’m up at 8500. Like I bought in when it was up. I’m new to this please be nice.
That’s a tough one because a few times I’ve seen people say we’re dropping and I went against the grain and held and wished I would have buckled. But other times I’ve seen doom and gloom and was in fiat and missed BGDs. So I’ve stepped back a bit to recollect myself as the passed month I’ve just been recking myself trade after trade. So here I am. Since I have been out of the loop the passed 2 days just wanted a general consensus. This sub is awesome! ❤️
Look everyone, its the "This is 2014 mtgox all over again because fractals" post of the hour.
We have that kind of post absolutely every hour for three weeks now.
From what i understand the ratio has a huge impact on Bitcoin's price action.  If it *is* reversing that could give good insight.
I feel like I'm not the only one who thinks general analysis of ethbtc and ethusd should be allowed.

Idk maybe it'd be controversial but ETH has moved the market so much in the past few months due to its connection to ICOs/alts that it's incredibly insightful in terms of sentiment of the overall market and future movements. 

ETH and alts are to BTC what BTC is to fiat, imo. 
Isnt alt / btc trading pair a subject for the altcoin thread ?
[deleted]
Yes, if this support holds, I will reevaluate my reentry point into my ALTs as it could be too low
Came here for this.   Was not disappoint
the Ken m of bitcoin markets 
From?
Yeah typically before these drops (or more accurately when I believe there will be a drop), I sell off my alts into BTC to take less of a hit. I very rarely go full-fiat as I do not like missing BGDs. 


I essentially trade the alts I know very well, using them to simulate leverage without having to pay extra fees.
At one point in time 99% of the alts will crash for good. The volatility is a speculative game for investors. The price is artifically inflated and people only buy in order to sell for a higher price. That's a bubble. Far more so than the BTC & ETH. If you don't like the volatility then don't participate in the madness. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. 
I should have mentioned that. You are absolutely correct. But ceteris paribus (holding all things equal), it is a solid directional indicator. 
True, that is why I scale in and out, and only buy below moving averages or during downturns. And ultimately only buy projects I truly believe in in the long-run

Yeah I think right now sellers are just pushing the price by attrition vs the buy spikes.
.1&#37; off is exactly the exact price I quoted and it looks like may 3rd to me, 

This is the chart I'm looking at [https://bitinfocharts.com/markets/kraken/usdt\-usd\-1m.html](https://bitinfocharts.com/markets/kraken/usdt-usd-1m.html)

May 6 was the drop to sub 9k
By sadness market I mean it only doubles once a year for an extremely long period of time; a crash everyone knew was coming does not describe a market 
True, longs can stay open a long time. This will create a avalanche effect when the price gets to low. If you do the math, you longed at 9k where would your liq point be when you used 3.3x lev?
At peak euphoria, the premium was something like 20% (24k vs. 20k spot)
yes expected it to hit minimum 50k by eoy
"From there a breakout would be very violent and if to the upside, could get us back to $20k."

The delusions get greater by the day.  So let's take a step back.  We needed mass hysteria, news outlets and papers having Bitcoin mania and every person in the office buying BTC to get up to that level.  

Now that interest has been evidently declining month on month since the start of the year, and many thousands of people got badly burnt since the start of the year, where exactly are the buyers going to come from this time to regain those dizzying heights?

Inb4 someone shouts "institutional money", that meme that has been "coming" for the past 2 years.
okk thx then its better hodling!!
daily rsi isn’t going to be a great indicator when we’ve been ranging for over a week
So legendary.
You bet. Lowered stops on it to just above 8150 but I'm not expecting it to even come close. I have to keep myself from adding to it here - it's very tempting. 
Yeah I'm a bit frightened by the weekly MacD turning down again.

I'll keep an eye on 8170 too for a bounce then, but right now it's price just looks heavy and slumpy. I'm starting to mentally prepare for more downside again, haha. 
Is your short still open? 
It was the 100 on june that got my eye.  Sept has increased much less in the same period of time.

And yes, I'm building an underwater DCA long on sept, so it makes sense that it is higher, probably many are doing this.
I actually shorted the ratio a couple days back around 0.08550. Only 1 coin as I'd never done that before, but it's done fairly well haha
It's a slow bleed. I have ETH falling out of the descending wedge right now at 670 and if it keeps dropping 666 (actually 665 but that sounds more ominous) puts it back under the local high down trend. So if there is a correlation BTC might break down as well shortly after.
Could go that way . . 
This could be THE short. Trying really hard to balance it being a good size while also protecting against getting knocked out of it prematurely. 
Straight into the negatives.

In a serious note though if we drop hard and squeeze longs, what do You guys reckon would be a good buy back in target be? Market will be quite shook I assume 
Line with one touch :-D
Yup, the delusion is still real here

Move beyond your lines drawn on a chart, and open your eyes to the state of the market

I can draw some lines on a chart to fit my narrative if that makes it more believable? 
Shorts dont add now...fine, but they dont add at resistance either, but longs do.. also are you not seeing how bearish this market behaviour is? Even if you disregard the longs and shorts
ah yes, that's some fine "random hipster guy with medium blog" FUD :D
8070 on mine, but I didn't update it after the first failed breakup on the 19th.

I'd consider it to be a fat line like that.
So we just bounced from it @8140 then. Let's see how strong that support is.

I think i'll close part of my short here just in case
This can still be the confirmation of the resistance turned support .

It's a normal situation, as long as it holds and bounces with volume. For now it's looking weak.
Ironical? 
It'd be absolutely cromulent.
I like this answer better. lol
We crossed above it 2 days ago, at least from most of the charts i saw and my own.
Could be 

Yet I was referring to the people on this sub 
Thinking about the exact same thing. Were is your entry level & aimed flip? 
Sadly, RSI has a lot of room to go down on 4h-1Week 

For BTC, if the bulls can pull through I think it could go as high as $8175, if it breaks through $8200, god damn good for them 
And how vastly overbought the alt market is. 25% of the crypto market cap is positioned to evaporate, and that isn't going to come out of an already lean bitcoin market cap.
global demand has been waning for months.  
> What bubble?

You can't be this delusional. Any definition of bubble that doesn't include bitcoin is completely useless 

It's not even a bad thing inherently. The internet was a bubble and look where it is now...to deny that this is a bubble...just....what do you consider a bubble? $1 to $50,000 in a week? 
No. I won't be happy until $7.5K as mentioned above.

Dumpy is losing his mojo big time.  Weakest dump yet.  I'm not even confident that this will hit my buy orders.
Having been in this since $50M was heavy volume in a day, I don't think it's an issue. Also, I don't trust the numbers given by exchanges wrt volume.  Lots of hinky shit going on with exchanges right now. I wouldn't keep more than a couple percent of my stack on one, personally.
I'd honestly be surprised if we go to 6k and below. 6k is still a 70% drop from the peak, which is pretty severe.
IMO, the aggregate crypto market cap is highly likely to be >$1T a year from now.

How that is disbursed is another story.
Aha..there it is.  Thank you.  

Now I have to figure out which one I truly like better.
A bright man, you are.
8200 is bullville. This is our house!
Pretty sure Peter Brandt isn’t ready to call it either.  
[Its totally a wedge guys](https://prnt.sc/jl3r1o)
To be fair to bulls it does look like a massive Bull Pennant on the weekly ((if you discount the blow off top) which is how these bull flags work and look sometimes).

Yes, I just figured that out with Tensor - the site /u/zigsquig suggested.  Never been to the site before but it seems useful for such tracking.

I'll take that into consideration, thanks

So the price keeps bumping the upper boundary of the short term resistance of this descending Channel.  

Someone a week or two ago told me if it tests resistance 4 times in a row without testing support, it will break through the resistance 99% of the time.  

I hadn’t heard of that before, but is there any truth to that?  

EDIT: well As I typed this, we dropped down to possibly test support in the channel, let’s see what happens 
> many of these investment groups bought in years ago for significantly less than current prices.

source/data?
Username checks out. 
Like analysis even work in this market lol. 
I was wondering if the ETH/BTC ratio bleed out now is an indicator of future BTC price movement over the coming weeks....but definitely looks like ETH will dump harder during this correction \(it also pumped harder too when BTC went from $6.5k to $10k\)
Don't really subscribe to the conspiracy side of that but agree with the result. I think it's just the market at work. Alts are generally another degree of freedom away from fiat, so when the overall market is looking bad people generally want to derisk, and vice versa.

Basically seems to go like people start thinking the bottom is in, move back into alts. Alt/btc ratios pump while btc/fiat pumps, compounding gains. People start getting skittish about all their gains and alt/btc ratios start falling more when btc/fiat falls than they gain when btc/fiat moves up and people panic because they're in a very risky position \(alts\) and want \*at least\* the relative security of btc. The good/smart traders exit in major profit. Then, as the drop continues, people start salivating at the alt prices \(if they went to fiat, they then profit not only on BTC being cheaper but also that BTC buying more alts\) and the cycle repeats itself.

Just normal market mechanics, it doesn't have to be a grand conspiracy. There's always noobs buying tops and selling bottoms getting rekt.

Fair enough. Doesn't invalidate the observation.
Gdax volume is awful 
I find it puzzling on why buyers have instilled so much confidence in the market. This thing isn’t screaming bullrun or massive recovery.

Yet, they continue to buy the dip like ferocious chimpanzees
They have no real reason to lose faith yet.  When they do lose faith, the big red dildo will come.

For now, they’re mostly right.  The market may dip 50 or 100 dollars and regain half of that.  But $8000 still seems like a good deal to them.  After all, the “bottom” so far was around 6.5k, so these are “cheap” coins to a “permabull”.  

All the quote marks are because I don’t believe most buyers who believe they are “permabulls” are really “permabulls”.  The vast majority of the so-called “hodlers” will fall victim to the FUD when it really hits.  We’ll find out how strong their hands are if/when the price drops from $7000 to $4500 in 48 hours . 

This might never happen, but history has a habit of repeating itself.  
Premium was also 200+ around 10k
rude
it is based on our data and extensive analysis. we can't make it public, but our findings has been confirmed by (undisclosed) trusted third parties, so you can rest assure it is reliable and confirmed. 
Would appreciate a chart if you already drew one 
Assuming this would be a s/l wick, where do you think people have their s/l's placed? 8100 or 8000?
I am not sure, $7800-$7900 could prove to be fatal for bulls. If we go there, then $6.3k is in the books again. Bulls should pray we don't wick there.
I know it isn’t tied, but why not cash out your crypto assets and go wild on forex. Just a wild thought not trying to justify what is happening here. 
It's a piramid :) 
It's an interesting point thrown out to encourage discourse. 

This has nothing to do with my perception of BTC prospects. If anything, it's more ETH bullish.
I don't see how that's a relevant reply!? I don't need anyone to hold me back, but I need someone to massage it. It hurts a lot, can you give a hand?
> If the blue line is the neckline then it would be a confirmation

Then no, it wouldn't? Has to break it brotha. Also, I just don't like it; shoulders are far too low.

Trade it as support/resistance, breakdown being below 7800. Same outcome then, just different reasoning.


This thing will "Space Hopper"
Yeah, I'm not convinced of my own idea, either.
The old still is active , the price hasn’t breached 8800 or 7899 , both have gotten  pretty close 
This premium behaviour is frustrating. I've entered way before you at 8.2 and I can bet we have very similar entry...

The only explanation that makes sense is the one you talked about. Buyers don't believe it can drop further.
Volume is so low, I suspect most of what you're seeing here is scalping and or "buying the bottom" in anticipation for a Daily Higher Low to be set.  It's what I've been doing.  Quick positions, never hold overnight, scalping $50-100 here or there on oversold bounces when I can.  Just finally went long at 8155 with 33% of my stack in hopes that we see a move up from here.

These kinds of antics are only possible because I don't think we have many retail buyers FOMOing in here.  BTC is appearing to be in a weekly equilibrium pattern, I suspect the next few months is going to be relatively low volume ranging between 7000 and 10000 before a break of the pattern in Q3 or Q4.
Does this have anything to do with the recent tether printing?  Whenever the price breaks an important support, then pumpy starts buying with tether to maintain it?  
Being undercapitalized blows.
Love this.  Never change, chew.
Haha, that’s absolutely true. I’m a little conservative though so I’d rather take no position than one I don’t want to have. 

Edit: grammar. 
I closed a short from 8100 @9100 a month ago, taking a hit of 50% to my stack. If i had held it open could have closed it in profit some days ago.

But i could also have been liquidated if 10K had been broken...

My advice is cut your losses soon, even if it goes back and you could have made money. That one time that it doesn't come back will destroy you much more than some small losses.


Quite the sharp V bottom there. 8300 is roughly my breakeven (assuming premiums hold as they are), and at this stage, I'm willing to see where this goes. 

If we break out of our favorite recent historical chop zone (green) and our downtrend line on this formation (red), I'll be bailing.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/kr1Jviiy/
If i follow you in the wins i'll hold on with you in the losses :)

Might close my short on ETH to compensate a bit if i have to close on the red.

Even on leverage you should be able to be absolutely *rekt*, and it be 10% of your crypto holdings. Drunk, maybe throw another 10% in a "good money after bad" sort of move. Sober up, re-ground yourself. Move on. Learn from mistakes. Get more Crypto.

And I've been rekt, a few times; trust me. Boggles the mind at a 100% yolo.

That is actually a valid point. I didn't sense anything about gambling addiction though in OP's post. Just an unlucky turn of events.
jesus
He just said it’s over in 50 bucks. Deff don’t yolo if you’re already in debt due to trading
Yeah I really hope that will happen instead of a slow bleed
Oh I get ya!  Thats why i'm waiting for us to get the 300 DMA in our back pocket before entering
You’re big short has potential for mega profits 
Some sexy shorts right there. Let that baby ride 
no target as of yet
Yep, that's the one!  If we go through 7600 will lose 8% of my stack.  That will be giving back nearly half my short profits. Damn, that escalated quickly.
lol yeah this is just setting up to be a massive fucking Bart. Can you imagine -_-
Agree, see that too. That said, it can flirt with crossing and do so much later. And when it does cross it does not mean a new uptrend. It's a corrective move. Cross up, cross down. 
Anyway price-wise I don't think it's going down now. If it does and bounces again on the long term support, that's bullish. If, on the other hand, it gives another failed go at 10k... The stars align for a summer of blood.
On another note the weekly bbands are closing, we might see big candles next month.

Wow, surprised hash rate is at ath.
Yes got to think there are many more holders now, but also a lot of BTC has been mined since that time.

So just not sure what the "fair market value" of BTC should be, based on fundamentals. But the market will let us know.
thx
Mindsets can be poison for RR ;)
All fair points. Given the last 35 days, a long from 8200 could have been closed in profit for about 33 of them. 
[deleted]
think we'll see lower lows lower highs within a choppy range until we drop below $7750-7800. 

We'll dump from there as there's basically thin air between $7200-7800.  maybe a bounce from $7500 to $7800

but I think everyone here is trying  to get the bottom and it's too obvious too be profitable. everyone is longing $7.8k.. they'll all sell at breakeven or at a loss if it starts to dump again or it  shows weakness upwards (which it likely will)

basically same thing that happened last time we were down here but a lower high

buyers have completely blown their loads buying every dip in this range. longs increasing, premium increasing (actually finally decreasing a bit), shorts closing. just seems like the market thinks it's figured  it all out 
there's a decent chance you get liquidated on a bounce but I'm personally of the opinion that this won't bounce nearly as much as anyone is expecting. we've bounced off this area twice now with lower highs each time. If we bounce again I think it'll struggle to even get past $8150. Which is what happend last time we dropped below $8k from $11.7k. 


At this point I'd set it really tight. Like 8131 tight. 50x is nuts 

Ironically I market sold a 50x short from 8130 on this drop, and my stop is at 8128. It was just a scalp short for me, as I have my full account short from 8250ish. 
Nooo!  

We follow you for the profits!  

You have no duty to protect people who follow you on your trades.  They are trading with their money.  You are not trading on our behalf, right?

Whatever you do to be profitable, just keep doing it and keep posting your positions.  That’s providing many people on this site a free education in trading.  
You are way too good, man.  Mad props to you.
You shouldn't. People following your trades should be interested in learning from you. The profits are a bonus.
The best you can do for us is to do what you think is better for you.

Each person is responsible for their decisions.

I doubted your reasoning and you explained what made you enter. I saw logic in it and went for it also.
Just closed 50% @8010 and the rest has a stop loss in profit. I only regret closing my other short on Eth... Closed @684 and its now @640... That was a bad decision and all on my shoulders. 
I'd like add myself into the list of people who follow your trades and thank you for what you're doing for this sub.
I’m an avid follower of your positions and they’re teaching me so many lessons, even the hard ones, I’m finally starting to be more confident in my own reasoning and maybe one day I’ll even try to contribute to the sub myself with some proper TA.

Even though I’m grateful you’re feeling more mindful for the people that follow you, I’d never want to, as a follower, weigh on your trading decision, especially if there’s the chance they’re in some way financially significant for your general wealth.


Not for one second I’ve held you responsible for my losses and I’m pretty sure that only fools would say otherwise.

Maybe the role we’re starting to play in your decisions isn’t really that significant and I’m worrying over nothing, but it was a chance to thank you anyway.


Also many, many props to /u/justanotherlogin for the bot and implementing it on Pushed, it’s been a lifesaver.

I'm loving this community, even though I'm a puny lurker.
Yeah posting positions and your personal analysis is great but it's not the best things to do as a trader. Especially if so many people follow you in your trades lol. It adds responsibility for others while the only responsibility should be your own money. It's why I mostly stopped talking about mine to my IRL trading friends. 


I have to say though. Many people keep getting fooled by these temporary reversals. It's 'choppy' for a day or 2 but the trend has been down ever since early may. There's clear market cycles, this cycle hasn't completed and we haven't bottomed yet. Getting in the right position before the cycle turns is the hardest part but once you are right... You can walk away and do nothing. 



4Hours is nothing, make it 3 days ;) 
Sure, I don't disagree with that, but what even more people don't realize is that staying in a position for days/weeks is not that bad either. You just have to get the reversals right. After that you can trade the position. Cover some when it dumps, reshort the bounce (or the other way around in an uptrend). There is no mandatory waiting AT ALL, much less stressful and it keeps your mind a lot less biased towards your own short term position. 
Why do you always assume people don't understand simple concepts? I'm pretty sure most people here know how to re-open positions. 
I wouldn't say *I* have no clue what I'm doing, but I will say I have no clue what *the market* is going to do in the future. At least not with any degree of certainty. 

I trade off of what the market **is doing** at any given time. Not usually what **I think it's going to do**. 

I don't see why that's so controversial for you. 
He manages his risk well enough to outperform many here over the long run, so he probably knows what he's doing....
Come on dude.  He is demonstrably profitable, the only trader who has consistently posted every trade since November in real time. you can calculate his profitability, which is something like 300% since then without factoring in leverage of any kind.  

Neither you nor anyone else in here can prove they are winning traders as easily as he can.  You might be good, but can you prove you are better than him? 
Its easy to criticize someone that posts every single position along with open and close numbers in real time. I don't think anyone on this sub is as dedicated to posting their positions like he is. 
And he's still in profit doing so
More like he's protective of his capital. He likes to enter on breakouts or bounces and likes to be in the green quickly. If it doesn't behave like he expects it to, he gets out and looks for a new entry.

But he also may not know what he's doing. The two aren't mutually exclusive. Who knows, but he seems successful enough.
lol ;)
Rude?
because around allall the trolling he was a person who never cared about the social/signaling value of his positions, keeping to his strategy and admitting when he was wrong. All 3 good traits of a trader
Who doesn’t like an entertaining trader that can provide comic relief when needed?

On top of being a good trader, he was sarcastic and trolled the trolls. I remember him going 100x short at $8000 and laughed at everyone who made fun of him saying he was gonna get rekted. Price went to 8.2k and back down to 7.8k and he closed for a gross profit. 


Maybe Sloppy can put up a straw pole so we can vote on bringing Cush back.. I know we're not a democracy but it would be interesting to see the results on way or the other. 
Nope. You would have sold way before 20k. Between 1k and 200$
Fair enough that makes perfect sense!

It's still looking quite heavy and as /u/l14dy stated earlier I think an aggressive wick down is increasingly in the cards. good luck on your trade!
I saw this formation as a channel, and the next touch with resistance would be around there, I was considering adding to short there.
since we are technically above 8200 are you cutting loose right now?

Personally, Im waiting for 8300\+ to add to my shorts and cutting loose at 8700\+
Looks like buyers are being cute again pushing the price back above broken support.  You think maybe this formation just changed to a descending channel?

[chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/fzz8drxX/)
where do you have your support line drawn at, 8200?
Lets go then. 
Same entry as you. Still have a smaller short on ETHUSD from this morning with 2% profit already but ETH is a loose cannon.

if u want out of the position just market yourself out the position. trust me i've been in your shoes. the price has neither broke up or down. it's going to fluctuate and you'll torture yourself needlessly.

there will be better days, entries and trades. if u think this is a messed up trade just quit it and analyze it later.
Uh oh...what have I done!?

edit: seriously though, worst case, you could bail if we get back up to 8200 again at your *original* exit plan. 
Well butter my butt and call me a biscuit. 
Alright.  I think that’s the right way to play this, but I am a noob, so I’m just glad my reasoning was in line there.  Anyway, let’s hope this resistance holds and the support breaks down - for both of us and everyone else who is short right now.   

I am short from around 8300 at the moment.  
fair enough! 

I was just under the impression that "absolutely brutal" meant kind of a radical disappointment with the general trend right now and that's why I commented that way. otherwise, you are, of course, correct. 


We could go as low as $7500 on this dump which would still be a bullish signal. If we stay above $8k until this clown runs out of coins, it could be a very quick and violent rebound, like a $1000 in an hour-type of rebound.
If that completes not even 500 will hold it. Thats a 200$ drop from head to neckline. 
Now we are looking at: 

-When Bart
-Release Korea FUD 
-Which Celebrity Will Predict Bitcoin 100k Next 
-Which Whale will get liquidated first 
-When will buyers stop buying the dip 
-Push up 300$ and the n00b bulls come out saying “ Bull Market has started”
-Comparing dick sizes 

I can make up reasons to better fit my narrative, as well. Doesn't mean its effective.
sign of a maturing  asset maybe? I've read that futures didn't reduce volatility with silver though 
these guys are just insane. they will not stop buying lmao 
Not my call though. I just saw it on the slack from the pros.
I’m too lazy to scroll through your post history. What’s ur current entry? 

Scalping these mini takeouts into the channel have been profitable as tits. You’re enjoying it as much as I am 
Buyers are insane, just saw 100 BTC market buy at 8.1 on finex
I'm counting on it. Hell I wouldn't be surprised if they bought it back up to the 8200 range, make mince meat of our TA and then let it drop again.
Insane push or not, I imagine 8140 is next on the resistance line's menu in 8~10 hours, whatever volatility brings it there (barring a breakdown of support within the next couple hours)
[Hoping for a steep fall, not crashing into a BGD straight on.](https://imgur.com/a/aGPNyoX)
If he was paid by someone for the equivalent of 0.15BTC in fiat, his cost base is the price he sold at.
yes but the gain part is 0% 
Up to the resistance of the downtrend is very high probability, but I do agree, I think buyers will be shaken again and unless some big whale decides the shorting party's over, we won't be seeing a multiple $100 bounce.
Getting to know a particular coins movements is really helpful.  
Ah, free electricity is where it's at. Don't get too greedy, but it sounds like you're good now.

I pay about $600/mo for electric, and bring in 2.2 Eth/Mo

I'm guessing you're around 0.2 Eth/mo?
🤙
Ok, cool, but if we bounce off let's say 8050, you can still buy in on the way up from the bounce, and if it doesn't, you can wait and follow it further down?
https://www.tradingview.com/x/twUnZNue/

Didn't we already break out of that one? 4 points of resistance on downtrend vs 2 now

Can confirm. Lost 4k in like 15 mins
I could tell that to them, but they would probably be just as confused as you are and not understand.
when trading on bitmex is the same feeling like playing diablo or starcraft and caring about resources and units the same way then one is close to reach the zen of trading, combined with a totally unbiased view of a short vs long position
The worst is being right and still losing money.  I manage that far too often.
Yes that too, a losing or winning when followed a strategy should be equal to the mind 
Or being stopped out of a long, and it just keeps going down, and down, and down. The satisfaction :)
Makes sense. "phew, 2% loss, close call, good job getting out".  "5% gains, puny, you can do better"
Right now it's 8171 (June futures) so like 8.1ish spot I guess? I originally shorted from 8210 this morning I think. I'm sitting at 200% ROE though so I'll probably have to close this sooner than later sadly but I really went balls to the walls on this one. Will have made back a good chunk of my losses from the past week so that helps. If this doesn't bounce much though and I can avoid getting stopped out... well :)
I wouldnt even long 7800 right now...
Thanks! 
...let's see where this lawnmower is going.
They already dropped 50-80%, so not sure why you would say it's the opportunity of a lifetime to short them now, rather than in late Dec/early Jan when they were much higher and about to plunge.

Cheers thank you good sir 
You have several options:

1. Sell all to cut your losses and buy back in cheaper.

2. Hodl until back above 8.5k, which may be a medium to long term play with the market as it is currently.

3. Sell part of your stack to cut your losses on some to buy back in later, but keep some in, just in case we bounce quickly back up.

4. Open a short to hedge the declining price, although you should have done that higher up and will need a much bigger short now to offset your stack amount.

The choice is yours though, nobody elses.

There hasn't been serious and substantial discussion that I'm aware of. It's one thing to say it and another to have a working model tht explains it or proves it. Until then, Eth/BTC sounds more like the tail wagging the dog to me.
Just wait until people get their father's day wall street bonuses from chinese new year's day.
its a meme.
In-depth research is what I trade on. Not anyone else's but mine. Many are in a bubble, but some will be big winners. VC mindset and look for highest risk adjusted return based on future cash flows. 
The thing that I'm wondering is if the first contact point on the lower line on that image actually counts as a contact point. Isn't that point still a part of the uptrend and not the downtrend?
There's also still quite some shorts open that will take profit as we go down and dampen the drop. I think the most important thing to keep an eye on is the ratio between the two, which is currently high, but not abnormally high.

Chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/wnqOC7zE/

Edit: just to clarify I do agree, and the high amount of underwater longs is what keeps me from taking a long position here, however, the chances of a squeeze are hard to gauge, and multiple people pointed out to me that they are a rather rare occurrence, and pushing price down rapidly here also becomes increasingly difficult.  
do finex users long and short with fiat?
fucking ridiculous lol imagine getting your short filled at $24k
not saying that it'll jump straight to 20k but a substantial bounce out of an equilibrium could set the stage for a bull run for the second half of the year.   
Outstanding point. I was just wondering on what timeframe he was looking at 
Don't. You need to get in the mindset of adding high not low. For shorting obviously. 

The time to short was $8300+

You'll ruin a good position. It could fall through here but you should be patient and sit on your hands until a better opportunity presents itself 

You should be greedy at the BEGINNING of a move. not After the middle or near the end

what you could do is long swaps and short futures. The premium will disappear slowly here I'm fairly sure. Then close the long if it dumps 
>Is your short still open? 

Yep. 
That knife-catching long could take a massive hit if the bottom drops out. Part of why it worked so well trying to catch the bottom at 6500 was it was trading at a $200 discount, not a $200 premium.
Damn. I wanted to add there. I had a tiny underwater one from 0.083. Just been waiting since it's so small. I wanted to double up at .086 but was wuss
I shorted the ratio pretty hard (25 ETH). I've been building the position since early may. I'm a bit surprised it held up so good but once BTC starts selling off again, it's going to fall like a rock. My initial target is 0.7 BTC or something between 550-600 USD. 
Nice! 
ETH about to cross that. 
you're gonna get knocked out of every single short you enter unless you have very strong hands or you shorted the exact top, that's why I try to avoid overtrading this chop 

you can honestly probably make more money just longing local bottoms and selling the bounce 
It's impossible to read from the front. BTC loves symmetry, though, and there's a compelling argument to be made for the following:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/54QV9KQI/

Still, impossible to tell except in hindsight.
If we mirror the BGD downwards...I'd probably start building a very low leverage long with negative premiums under 7K. 
Honestly I'm afraid after the initial bounce we will bleed right back and go sideways as we have been. Slowly ladder small buys back in I guess.
3 on the top, 2 on the bottom
SO FAR, MAN, SO FAR :P
There's some words there, and not all of them make sense,
You’re hiving them too much credit...any dipshit can post on Medium.  
[deleted]
That 8120 bounced from support on my chart ;)
Close enough to say that we bounced from it.

I don't know, looks like it won't hold, but I have no idea what this market is doing lately.
That depends on where you draw your lines.  But ok I see what you are saying and that's a valid read of the technicals.
lots of people in this sub are going long here but not posting about it. most people here don't post their trades until they're 1-2% in the black. 

remember, 66% of this sub thinks we're hitting $10001 before $5999

also i think a lot of this sub is underwater from longs above $8300. So they already bought in. check the daily from 2 days ago and you can see dozens of posts from people longing $8300+ a few even longed $8550 
Oh for sure (re:RSI)! Thats why its a small position with low leverage.  

Only targeting a couple % on BTC.  Targeting 3-4% on ETH because of it's obnoxious drop.

Interesting. You anticipate alts selling back into bitcoin soon? I have some fairly heavy alt bags right now that I’ve been considering selling into bitcoin - maybe it’s time I do. Last time I did this, it was the right move. It just took forever to build up my alt portfolio like this. 
IMO, this mistakes an overbought CC market for Bitcoin. CC has a long way to drop, yet. The whole thing is a bubble... but where any given participant is positioned in that bubble is relevant.
We're not in a bubble. I've been hearing that for many years.  It's never been true.  We may have had a momentary bubble in December, but we are definitely not in a bubble right now and arguably never were.  Bubbles pop fast and fall to zero (Think: Lehman Brothers).  That has not happened and will never happen with Bitcoin.

Before you parrot cliche talking points, look up what a bubble is, and see how they pop.  That has never happened with Bitcoin.  It has been called a bubble innumerable times, and that prognosis has always proved wrong *over time*.  Time is money.    
Neither do I but fact is you can't fake low volume. I see blockchain moving forward, cryptomarket taking a step back this year to be honest.

May want to call a structural engineer out to look at your foundation, lol
He can be blunt. Now that I see it I can't ignore it. Everything else is just noise.
Haha, dear lord if that plays out I'm gonna look real stupid to a lot of people. 
maybe, maybe not. i think to get to the bottom of that pennant we would have to break too many important supports for anyone to be bullish
Fair point.
Cheers thanks. 
Ergo, the likelihood of a bottom has increased, though I'm still a bit doubtful in this market. 
[deleted]
This guy gets it 
Yes
BCH went up like 350% during this run...
Yeah I mean honestly I believe most "conspiracy" theories about market makers and whales. I just don't think it's a conspiracy- I think it's the market doing it's thing lol. 

it doesn't matter what it is- you have to play the game and be a step ahead or get dumped or pumped on
KYC compliance.
Bitmex doesn't want to deal with the U.S. government. They don't need to.
i don't understand your question.
a bunch of dinks made the mods self conscious I think. that said I think this is fine content. it’s still a social community on a speculative asset, trading bias aside 
because bitcoin has only ever rewarded people for buying the dips and having faith since 2009. they'll buy until the bottom 
which is exactly why hodling is really a meme for most people. Almost every person who bought in on the bull run panic sells when the price comes back around to their entry. People who entered just 9-12 months ago have hardly had their hands tested
I held on tight in January-February as price dropped from 11.3k to 5.9k knowing full well it would bounce back.  We hodlers aren’t going anywhere. 
> $8000 still seems like a good deal to them. 

But how come they are so impatient they can't wait two-three hours to see if the price drops further?
But at least the price was going up during that stretch, and it appeared that the market had already overcome major resistance at $9,800. 

From a price perspective, there's really nothing especially bullish about recent market behavior. 
please don’t enable him
Going wild on forex? I mean yes the Euro has been volatile, but nothing comparable to crypto. If you are trading crypto, you probably are young and inexperienced (at least that is what studies support). And you're also here for volatility. I don't think you're typical crypto trader or "investor" trades forex or even trades stocks.

Besides, fiat is strongly affected by geopolitical events. And there are a lot of events that are happening that would cause people to sell or buy.
> I know it isn’t tied, but why not cash out your crypto assets and go wild on forex


Lmao, WAT?!

What on earth are you trying to say??? People are cashing out crypto to "go wild" on FOREX markets??

Oh holy shit, you're serious. 

>Just a wild thought not trying to justify what is happening here.

Yes, yes you are. That's the kind of thinking that made the ancients believe a fucking chariot god brought the sun across the sky. Just because it's natural, doesn't make it not retarded.
[removed]
Maybe the shoulders are too small also.  Yes, blue line was meant to be the neckline.
Ah yeah that's true. I just wonder if the downturn of the past two days has changed the balance at all, since I was expecting a crawl much closer towards 8800 instead of the two random wicks we got... 
well I personally considered $7925 close enough to $7899. and then we actually did hit $8600 albeit for about 5 seconds! 

Almost seems like someone was fucking with us all 😂 

I would like to poll again though, although I think it'll be abojt the same results 
ya, that's pretty much the only logical conclusion. 

They're all anticipating another 10%+ 4h Big Green Candle. And they're positioning themselves accordingly. 

This is not likely to change unless $7,800 falls.

And in their defense, they could be absolutely correct in their assessment of the situation.
But if it does...quite the bonus we'll received. 
It could be any number of things:

1. Buyers are still riding the euphoria of the break of the descending log trendline and are convinced the longer-term-bear-trend is over. They're treating any selling pressure as temporary and delusional, and thus are buying every single dip...regardless of what triggered said dip. 

2. Underwater longs are adding to their positions to prevent liquidation.

3. There's a mysterious "they" who are purposely driving through support to trap shorts into positions before pumping price in an upcoming Big Green Candle. 

Personally, my bias is toward option # 1. Buyers see a drop below $7,800 as absolutely impossible and are behaving in the only logical way one could behave if you assume that to be true: buy buy buy, at every single opportunity between $7,800 and $8,400.
If it breaks down you'd wish you'd have this one ;-)
Thanks for the advice. I now know to do so esp when the short term trend has been broken. Right now it's looking like st trend is down so planning on holding a bit longer to close in small profit. 
Actually my (just slightly profitable) sl on this short happened to be just about right at the top of your green zone there.  (already took profits on 60% of it below here)
Well, on the plus side, the longer the market stays within the wedge the less painful the loss will be if resistance does break to the upside. 

If it holds throughout the rest of the day, we'll be able to close at breakeven at some point. 
Heh, I had an ETH bag last night that was over 50% of the balance (that's what I get for tweaking settings on the fly). Manually cut it at -1% at 698 after I saw a number of indicators that ETH could dump. Almost could have been really bad.

Potential. We'll see if (1) the market drops that far and (2) I execute my strategy and don't manipulate myself out of a good position. 
The other alarming factor is the rate at which we moved from 6900-7800 without retesting anything below 7600. The sheer number of longs that must be in the 7800-ish range compared to the wasteland of 6900-7700 is worrisome. If buyers keep pouring money into these dips and we see longs break 35K while shorts drop under 20K, we really will have a near inversion of the BGD setup. Some whale could sneeze this thing back to the 6s. 
I just had a look at the chart, and though I hate to say it, this really does look more like a Lisa.

Source - youtube (no link because illegal methinks?): BTC Bitcoin Simpsonian Analysis - Is a Lisa Retracement Imminent?  
At current prices it's still profitable to mine, but only just. Annual revenue with an antminer s9 is about $1100 at current difficulty (US electricity cost @ $0.12), with a price-tag of $1010 (90$ profit per year). 

However, when taking into account discounted cash flow, and the risk associated with BTC volatility, I'd consider it not worth it at all. This equation does change a bit with countries that have low electricity cost. (China profit $1933 @$0.05, Iceland profit $1815 @$0.06) However, you also have to keep in mind maintenance, risk of changing electricity costs, and profit margins decreasing as difficulty increases. 
Well that's the joke, you can't effectively say what exactly the price should be as it's hard to quantify the opportunity cost.

Some things I use is Mining cost + a discount rate for the risk, Look at the NVT ratio, and see how it's valued using Metcalfe's law relative to other prominent crypto's. To be honest though, because it's so much TA/emotion driven, it's not immensely effective. 
not if you did it on the 26th of March, in our last downtrend, haha. That would've been a rough three weeks to sit through. 
tradingview has a little camera in the bottom your can click which makes a screenshot and gives you a link. 
Straight. Playing the wait and see here. Seems like it's just honeypotting us here before it rekt down some more.
And if volume doesn't pick up, buyers here will be sellers in the upper 8000's and we start all over again. Staying out of this unless we go down to retest the 6800 bottom of the descending wedge on daily.
Thank you. I'll move it up over 8150 then just, to be sure. 8K as we speak. 
I'm short without leverage as well. My small stack for leveraging probably won't last long if I keep this up though. Thanks, I think 8131 sounds like a good plan.
RemindMe! 3 days
It is more stressful for me to sit there and watch a bounce or dip that moves 3% or 4% against me.  

But Chewy tried to catch the local bottom and he did it successfully in this case.  Yes it is risky and I usually fail when I try it, but I would never say don't even try.
that's peacehere as I'm sure you can tell. I don't get why he has 87 alts lol 
Sometimes you're a bit vague or inconsistent with your reasoning, I think. I'm not saying you're a bad trader because I think it's clear you're not but sometimes the insight into why you took a trade is lacking. 
Yeah, honesty and transparency are as important as charts and predictions. He may be prone to the same impulsivity as other traders here but he usually has good reasons for entering and his timing is better than most. The fact that he offers what appears to be profitable trading advice to the sub consistently gives him additional credibility beyond his record. 
*actually* he's more protective of his btc. Since he only goes 10x to hedge he's only flat when he shorts. 

If price goes down here he's still losing money. 

it's the one thing I don't really get with him. I think part of it is that he just hates getting liquidated and would rather lose money than btc 
myusernameiforgot is a well known troll. its all he does
His strategy was just to short BTC 24/7.

TBH I never thought he was an actual person making trades. I just thought he was a paid BCH troll or general fudster or something. He would always throw in something like "have some buys placed around $1300..." at the end of his comments almost like his entire purpose was just to get rise out of people, not to provide real bearish insight.
You do realize that if you went 100x short at 8000 and the price went to 8200, you'd be liquidated, right?

Not even a question of what would win.

I think the Yes’s would far outweigh the No’s
I would've bought $30 sold at $4 bought $900 sold at $300 bought $16000 sold at $6000 
I personally think that waiting for the confirmation of the breakdown is a bit safer, and adding when we get rejected by 8200, as you're stating.
The move above $8,200 was pretty half-hearted. So I'm holding it for now.
Possibly, although there's only two points of contact on the support line if that's the case.
Eh, if it bounces off support and breaks through resistance, then it's only a 1% hit or so.

If it keeps dropping on the otherhand, the downside is far more significant.
Sure! Makes sense.  I'd heard that too, but never looked into it.  Was it volatile to the same degree as the mentioned markets, before futures do you know?
MEX is going crazy with buys. 
I'm making too many moves to deal with posting each thing.  8370 on june, which is roughly 8270, last time I added to it was just a bit before the last big candle down at about its opening, but 2 hrs ago.
$7M buy wall on mex swaps as well at 8100. I hope that's just a short closing. 
I'm not sure sideways is on the menu again this time. Not with ETH as an anchor. We'll see, but the finishing move to <8050 would be brutal right now. 
The only issue is that a short seems too obvious right now.
Correct 0.2 ETH / month ish depending on how often / stable the miners are but they have paid out them selfs so running on basicly pure profits right now. But it just isnt enough to actually withdraw the ETH from an exchange if the price is too low as it just is a too small amount to give a meaningfull impact montly. But it would suck to see the gains take a nose dive into goblin town.
Maybe this is a dumb question, I don’t know, but how is that a falling wedge? Those first two points of contact seem to be before the wedge even starts. Don’t know how to word this very well. Like don’t falling wedges have to have the first point of contact on the upper line instead of the lower one?
That's my take.  I think It's premature to say it has expanded into the next falling wedge and start basing plans off that.  (though we could get a third touch and then I'll believe it)

At this point IMO it has expanded into a narrow descending channel, and we already saw the pop out of the falling wedge which lost steam, which is what established the channel.
Lol, it's funny how you keep claiming everyone else doesn't understand and is confused. You did the same thing in comments below regarding the connection between liquidity and means of exchange. 

Perhaps it's *you* who is confused here. What, did you just get into crypto last week or something?

The fuck is your leverage, 25X? I know I shouldn't but I really want to add here and be 100% again. This shits going to bounce though, at least $100 more at some point and crash back down.
Nope. I wouldn't even trust a break of 8200 right now.
Because if this is going to progress as in 2014, 95% of the alts in top 100 marketcap will be gone in 5 years. They will go to 0.
Because there is a chance of a real panic later in this descendence of BTC. 
Thank you so much! I appreciate you helping me. I’m thinking about option 1 or 2. At this point not sure I’m up for babysitting all weekend as I’m going out of town so holding might just be easier even though I’m sure I’ll miss out on more awesome gains. 
Yes. I do understand google. But I have no investment background so for me to wrap my brain around that it’s still a little difficult for me to comprehend. Call me stupid or whatever you want. Just asking for help because I thought maybe some nice people would be willing to help those of us that arnt professionals. 

I upvoted you because I do still appreciate the gesture 😊
Ok thank you!
Good sportsmanship award for this comment. Good group in this sub.
This.
Yeah lol.

I actually think the overall market sentiment regarding gambling and trading shown in WSB and in this very sub is a reflection of euphoria in legacy markets. I'm probably completely out of my element here but I think the economy in general is overdue for a big dumping. 

DJIA looks like it's ready to pop like BTC did and it's just DCBing over and over. 

They could have ulterior motives, but even Goldman Sachs yesterday said Trump's tax cuts could cause a recession.

Generally bubble pops and blow off tops are preceded by financial innovation (cryptocurrencies) and financial liberalization (loosened financial regulation)

but I'm completely out of my element when it comes to more sophisticated markets and complex financial/econ analysis. so I could be wrong.

I'm actually considering going back to school for a few finance classes...
Anyone that filed a 30-day tax filing extension will be getting their refunds soon!
I didn't even think about that! 
Lol thanks for the heads up. Surprised I don't know this one 
There's almost never an actual need to use a blockchain for 99% of what these alts purport to do. The bottom will fall out at some point. I can almost guarantee that.

You can use both. But if you use btc(or alts) as colleteral for your leverage, your liq point will come closer faster if you longed when the price is dropping, since your colleteral is decreasing in price. 
Either with USD or BTC as collateral
If we're in dreamland, I'd rather have a long from sub 3k ;-)

yup I have done this many times in the past
Y'know what, that was a great reality check, thank you.  (*this* is why I love to post my trade plans here!)

This is designed to play the macro formation, and we are still in the middle.

I'm going to set the buys to begin somewhere in the 7ks instead.  It needs to be setup so that if we fall through 6.8k and keep going down, I don't get rekt.
Very good point, thanks for the reminder! I'm a bit weary of it this iteration indeed.

It's tiny still, only hit the first couple ladder rungs, I had planned to carry it as low as 6.8k.  If we don't bounce there though I'd have to take a decent hit.

Perhaps I should consider dropping the ladder between here and 8k, and starting it back up at 7.8ish. 

The one I built down to 7.9 k the other week was cashed out the other day btw.

Now we wait to see if it cascades or just the ratio plummets. This might get ugly(fun) soon.
Eth looks like it's about to free fall. Could be a tell. 
7k is where we break below the symmetrical triangle. I'd say $5-6k would be the place to long for a bounce back to $7-7.8k

but if and when I long that I'd be selling the bounce if the break below the symmetrical triangle is swift and voluminous (because it'd indicate a large move down to like...goblin town levels...$2-3k I think)
I meant support cut through half of the wick. You chart either whole or none so if this one is wrong then you have one point.

But that was a joke, market is behaving very strange.
Don't mind if this drops and you'll be right. 3 strikes in a row, need a win.
He's saying shorts are scared and gunshy at resistance but longs are piling on at support like hungry dogs. And he's wondering why the sentiment is so imbalanced since we've effectively been ranging for 3 months 
that was my point
> You're not shorting anything from Coinbase Vault my guy


What's up with you and Coinbase Vault...
 
You must be confusing my username with some other for sure...
Let's see how high this bounces
It's definitely not doing what it's supposed to be doing. I have the line lower though, at about 8080, but I guess it's more to do with wick cutting etc. 
That's because it's not a true market.
It's a handful of retards trading back and forth.
You can't analyse it and you probably never will.
Check out those who log their positions here https://www.anotherbot.info/index.php?type=long&order=0&curr_order=0&dir=asc

Longs are mostly in the red, most of the ones in green have CA around 6800s. So adds to your last point.
It's crazy that people think recovery from a major bubble happens in 5 months. I guess that's why it took 1.5 years the last time to find the bottom. Takes a while for people to give up on an immediate bounce up when the bubble hasn't deflated yet. 

Remember we went from 1.1k to under $200 in that time. We could easily drop another 50% from where we are. No one knows how likely that is, but it's a sobering thought. 
I closed out my alt positions last night. I have serious doubts about the strength of hands in that market.

I think a lot of it is going to fiat. Some will hit BTC. Even ETH is looking bad right now. I sold it all just in time. The portfolio value in BTC was dropping for a week before I did.
I mean the whole space is in a bubble. bitcoin won't pop nearly as hard as alts though. Alts are still in for a reckoning. I'd be super wary holding them now. they are going to truly capitulate over the next 3-6m 
Which is a 82% drop. From 20k 82% is 3600. If 6500 fails I'll short it with somewhere around 3600-4600 as a target. Kinda lines up with the 2016 trend line and the downward trendline that broke from 20k. https://www.tradingview.com/x/1MIDRcgw/

I kinda want to short a bounce now because I'm having doubts about any ATH rally this year but I'll stay in denial for a bit longer.
I know. I'm not saying that it's impossible for it crash 80&#37; or more, just pointing out that it already crashed a lot. Also, just because the last bubble unfolded that way, it doesn't mean that this one will. The circumstances are different from the one 2014/15.
The last bubble can go fuck itself
The last bubble was in COMPLETELY different market conditions.
City calls me, I don't call city.
I'm always doubtful. We're still in a downchannel.

All my trendlines cross at around 7800 in about 24h. Even an age old uptrend from before Dec. 2017 that provided nearly unbreakable support this whole year.

The lowest point before we bounce could be there. But I'd be *very* surprised if we went below that.

https://i.imgur.com/Fd8QUOI.png
I don't disagree that groups bought in years past, just wanted to know if anyone has any actual concrete current numbers, or not. 
Agreed. The issue is if you start actually believing it's a conspiracy/group that's controlling it, you start to think "well what if they change the rules" or "what if they decide to do something else this time" and get rekt, because, well, it's just \*probably\* not true. Occam's razor. The simplest answer \- that it's normal market mechanics exacerbated by illiquidity \- is the most likely one.

 Sure, there's ebbs and flows to whether the up cycle is stronger than the down cycle and fundamentals can change things up sometimes, but the rules aren't going to suddenly switch at the snap of a finger. 
Well, many other exchanges also have thorough KYC process. So why can't those serve US customers?
As in why doesn't big exchanges such as Bitmex, OKCoin, Huobi, Binance deal with US customers?
It's funny because a\) the mods shouldn't give a shit and b\) the vocal dinks are the ones that were clogging up the daily.
Has it bounced back?  I didn’t know we were over 11k now.  I must be looking at the wrong charts.  Let me know how your hodling is going in a year or two when BTC is “dead” and I’m buying in at 4-5k.  
They did, the price is lower now than it was 2-3 hours ago, so they’re buying.

This isn’t my logic, it is theirs.  CHEAP COINS!!!
'From a price perspective, there's really nothing especially bullish about recent market behavior.' 

No shit 
Ahhaahah ok
What's illogical is that buying power suddenly stops.

I think we have a lot more traders and a lot less average Joe's that just buy whatever the price is at the moment. Too many bots and people trading TA to cross lines convincingly.
However, if the market breaks up instead, then Mex traders could absolutely lose their minds and balloon the premium to 3%+ in a matter of hours.
There's a mysterious "they" on both the bear and bull sides. Ultimately, the little guys will pick the winner because the market will do what it wants to do over time. I happen to think it wants to go up as demand is still relatively small but growing all the time.
I almost fit into #1. I do believe it’s possible we could dip below 7.8k, all it would take is some major FUD to make that happen.  The news recently has generally been positive for crypto,  It seems like lack of interest in general is keeping prices low. Even Reddit discussion is low.   Then pumpy keeps maintaining the price (not complaining since I’m in a long).  I do think the tether printing is no coincidence. 

As you know I’m bullish long term but the lack of interest is turning me bearish in the very short term.  I hope that changes, but with prices staying low it would take something big like institutional investors jumping on board to significantly change the tide. 
[deleted]
Good luck then. I'm also short from this morning just above your entry so we are on the same boat :)

Will close if it breaks 8300 with conviction.
Seems like an excellent s/l location. Think we'll get another leg down making a new low or double bottom, where you might want to take some more profit, but that's up to you. 
Yes, usually my positions get worse over time. I start on top of the pattern and as time goes by, when the apex is reached i'm near break even or slightly under.
Closed my short on ETH for a small profit. It could detach from BTC if BTC bounces here but it will probably pump more if BTC rises.

Now i have some free margin to add to my short if this gets rejected on the upper bound of the wedge.
You clearly have a gambling problem that you need to deal with first.
tales from the flushmaster.
rebuild and flush again.
First you will be in a daze for a day or two though.
In the future you have to make money harder to get or you will flush it.
Keep the cold wallet in a safety deposit box.

Sometimes I grab a roll of 100$ bills and flush them down the toilet to get the flushing instinct out of my system.  Cheaper that way.

No. This is terrible advice. The size of the debt does matter. Are you insane?

He should work to make it back. You know, the honest way.

I’m going to report you for even suggesting this. You must have a gambling problem.

You draw a line in the sand and you dont fucking cross it. That line has been reached if he borrowed money to trade.

Otherwise, that’s how people lose everything 
This violates rule 1. There are some people reading this who might take you seriously.

26th of march was more than 35 days ago :P
close half at a small profit and you'll give yourself more room. This is either gonna fall through the floor or chop around more. 
Move it to 8101 now. Haha
3 days is nothing, make it 2 weeks ;)


Oh lol, no my radar is only tuned to DK. Did peacehere get banned?
I'm on mobile a lot more frequently these days, and I'm also entering and exiting more frequently. 

The mobile aspect isn't likely to change, but the trading frequency will once the market gets less choppy. 
That's an arbitrary definition of capital. It depends on how you look at it. Long/shorts are just multipliers of capital in one direction or the other. Protecting capital just means protecting value, it doesn't necessitate that you denominate your capital in fiat versus an asset, if that asset can store value. Being net long doesn't mean you're not protecting your capital it just means you're expecting the price to go up.
Nah dude he was long the entire time from a cold storage stack. 

Also he longs *all* the time. He scalped this range several times. I actually got annoyed and told him he should try to hold a short longer. 

He's basically shorted $200 down then re opened $100 up like 10 time in this range

not to mention he closed his $7k short before the BGD cause of the 40k shorts.. there's a comment about it in the daily where he says even shorters are delusional 
So what if he did ?  He made a lot of profitable short positions at local tops and held through fakeouts , more than most here can do
My numbers are probably off, but it was something like that.

I’ve had 9 concussions I have the memory of a midget mosquito 
we did it for L14dy several months ago. He had to write an apology though.
[deleted]
Sell low, buy high is also a strategy after all.
We're at 8200 now, but I'm not adding here.  I'll add if we go sideways for a few hours here and hit resistance.  Between 8250 and 8200 probably.
We should find out pretty soon. BBands tightening and putting pressure on the resistance line.

Price seems to be getting away from the resistance line but the support @8200 might drive this sideways until the resistance is met 
It's looking not
Honestly, I'm sceptical of anything at the moment, haha hence I'm barely trading anything. I'd rather go long lower in the pennant and short a bit higher up. 
> running on basicly pure profits right now

Yeah, wait until taxes my brotha. Actually, since you have zero cost nvm, but for the rest of us, a rant:

I don't even know what I am going to do this year. All of my mining profits I sold in 2017 I did at a zero cost basis (To protect my anonymity, and Eth basis was about 10 bucks when I mined most everything; sold at over $1000), but this year it looks like I just won't sell anything. Not profitable enough unless I start claiming as a business to claim electric and depreciation and shit. 

I have most receipts for equipment electronically, but am still mining to the same address I always have. I should switch it up.
I don't even know, to be honest man. Wedges are becoming the new h&s memes. I think the wedge I drew is the one he was  referring to, which is sketchy no matter how you look at It because of what you said. 

I think the real falling wedge was the smaller one towards the end and it already played out. Either way the breakout looks like it failed 
the endorphines should come from the strategy :D 
Hehe, it's quite a bit higher than that ;)

I get the feeling - this doesn't feel like the end of it at all to me, but all indicators are pointing to an incoming bounce. And yet... I added against my better judgement just above 8, hella risky, and it worked out for me, but I would say adding here is a little *too* risky haha ;)
So open a short position on 95% of the alts and hold it for the next five years.  I'm not sure what exchange allows you to do that...I don't think there are any, but at least you can do it in your fantasies.

I will focus on trading the current market..not my fantasy of five years from now.
The market today is completely different than 2014. They aren't comparable. 
There was already a real panic as BTC dropped from $20K to $6K and the alts dropped even harder.
I’d suggest before investing any more, that you read up and research on BTC and trading in general. There’s plenty of resources out there. This market is fucking mental and merciless, and will push your shit right in if you don’t know what you are doing. Hell, it still does this to those who do know what they’re doing!

Yeah that was dickish on my part but then again you are on a trading sub and you are asking very very basic questions. If you don’t do some research on your own and cover the basics people will be less inclined to hold your hand and teach you. 
I've been sitting in short term bonds for a few years, expecting a dump that never came. Meanwhile companies are so flush with cash right now that they buy back their stock with it. I really don't see the stock market crashing till 2020 or later because of it. 
Who files only a 30 day extension though? I've always done 180 anytime I've done an extension...
Very true. I am on your side, bar a few coins I do trade to accumulate. 
Well alright. I guess. I just see this type of falling wedge posted here a lot and I'm wondering if my thinking is flawed. It is what it is I guess, but that makes sense. 
FWIW, I'm holding my short and started scaling into a long on swaps for a scalping opportunity. Only two executed again, CA @ 8180. It's only 20% the size of my short, but it's basically like I locked in profits on the 20% of the short at 8180. Futures premium is going crazy, though. I may close my short here as the breakdown seems to be a fakedown. 
That premium will reduce by at least half if we see a quick drop to 7500-7800 range in the next few days.

note that expected funding rate is getting higher too which helps the quick price adjustments.

I'm with you on setting low buys, just do it at the price of perpetual but on the future so that if premium disappears you get the price of a future for the price of a perpetual; basically when they're close to equal price.  Then if a bounce comes you get the long plus the premium.  In any other scenario where you bought with premium you could risk not only your long but also losing your premium.
I see two wicks touch bottom. Confused . . 

Edit: OK on his Coinbase chart, yes. but idea is there.
Yeah, i redrew it better and i think you are right. It's more likely to be in that area,
Yeah me too.  That's the original line.  If you updated it with the failed breakup on the 19th, you get 8140ish. 
This shows how it *could* be done.  I don't believe we have this in our future. But it shows how you can only drop 70% after a 2000% move and still push forward.

Most alts are a bubble. This is true. Most will fall hard and fast to zero.  That is not the case with Bitcoin.
Yep... 4k is the target if we go under 6.9k. But market overreacts, so we could see 3.x possibly. 
market conditions might be different, but bubbles take time to unwind and to reach the various stages, just like stages of death. You don't bounce back from a bubble in 5 months. People still need to hit capitulation and despair. You have seen what the shitcoin market looks like, we are not there yet.

Once people give up on moon this year, we might be at capitulation. For that to be confirmed, people will quit talking about buying the dips.
Doesn't matter. You can line us up against the last BTC bubble, or the Microsoft bubble, and the price decay still looks the same. At least it was only 3 years to revisit ath with BTC, Microsoft look 20 years. 
Hmm, I'd also be surprised if we went below 7800 in 24 hrs, but in a longer term not so much if we don't manage to get past 8800 if we do start to trend up here. 
There are probably additional regulations to adhere to and/or they don’t want any exposure to the US gov. 
because freedom
It did bounce to ~11.8k in February. Then the mt gox FUD started in March and some mega whales sold.  And here we are.  

In a year or two?  Try over 50k bitcoin by then.  
that guy said he's never been more sure of anything in his life regarding btc going on another bull run 
Well their logic sucks. Look at it now. That's a $100 drop right there. 
True, although I'll be bailing long before that. Heck, I might even get lucky again and get to bail before futures catches up (got to exit under swaps on the last BGD). 
Offering incentives for market makers is nothing new, and is certainly not specific to Bitmex.

Bitfinex, for example, offers reduced fees for traders above certain volume thresholds. 

As I've said before, we should all be grateful that there are market makers on Bitmex who offer liquidity to the orderbook. Without them, nobody would be able to enter or exit positions without significant slippage.
I doubt it will. Doesn't look like bottom but it sure does feel close in terms of time
I think would wait for more profit taking on lower bottom, and lower the stop loss in that case, rather than rescalping the double bottom (because if I were to add again after that, the ca would be too heavily affected).  But it really depends on how things look like later.  I want this to have the potential to ride a drop down through the 7ks, this area feels march 11ish to me, and I can't shake the feeling that we must test the bottom of the macro formation before revisiting the top.

Then again, if I add to it, I probably should scalp the double bottom again.  Too many times I've lowered my CA just to ruin the profitability of the SL, while missing a profit taking opportunity.

I'm watching 8300 to break. My adds are below (8250-8290):

Just had the first one hit (8350 June futs)

Do you think he was kidding?
I think you mean /u/SloppySynapses
Yeah Lisa is definitely a sadistic dominatrix that loves to inflict max pain on us poor souls
haha, oops. Read over "the last" part. My bad!
Thanks, I'll do just that.
You think? No big bounce? 
No idea. I don't mean to rat him out I just have been confused seeing his prose everywhere. He has about 3 other alts lately as well. I can tell because he either mentions iq, not understanding something, not being able to see something obvious with your eyes, and holding lots of alts which drag his net worth down when they dump.
Looking to re open short if we break through 7800?
The trading frequency I don't think is necessarily problematic. It's easy to see why you're flipping positions quickly given the current environment. But sometimes you pull a Kanye and say some crazy things and then enter a trade, usually at 3 am. It's probably over-trading in some cases I think but that doesn't mean that opening and closing frequently is itself a problem. You definitely are trigger happy to some degree though, which is *potentially* diminishing your returns. But there's no way to know.
Well I guess I had him wrong then. 

Why did he get banned from this sub? One day he just wasn't here and I never knew why.

Yeah I totally took your comment the wrong way. Truth is I would've sold low bought high a few times. The ridiculous gains would make up for it though and I imagine after a while i would've learned to be patient and buy very low and just wait. 

I can only imagine how much more btc people had in 2011 and getting pissed at themselves for ever spending it without buying more 

Must suck looking at old wallets man...
what's funny is with btc if you just held after buying high you would've still been rewarded 
Yeah exactly, wait to see where/if we hit resistance. Resistance looking super heavy at 8200 on GDAX, so finex will have to pump on volume to force arb bots to punch through that wall, otherwise this'll sink back in. 

All that being said, if we do end up reversing strongly here, we could be looking at a huge IH&S. I'm doubtful, but if that thing completes we're looking at challenging our massive pennant. (This is my last bit of hopium to avert a year-long bear market. )
8050 held for now, and if we're going to bounce it'll be here. Tapped the channel bottom: https://www.tradingview.com/x/6zyUBXg4/
Damn dude, that took balls. Good for you that it payed off. 
you miss my point but ok whatever
the market in 2014 wasn't comperable to the markets in 2011, 2012 etc but we still crashed down 90% in those bubbles too. you can't say its not going to happen just because theres more people. look at the price today, its already super high up for someone who joined a year ago, even if we went down to 3k it would still be great
"this time is different" 

sorry dude, most shitcoins will die a violent death and will dump to insanely low levels. 

Even the people who peddle them around trying to get you to buy them know that. 

also there's a common misconception that bubbles don't happen in  more mature markets but...I suggest you take a look at the housing  bubble in 2008. 
alts are still ridiculously inflated, even such alts as ethereum. theres no real usecase for these things today. its all speculative. takes time for the market to realise that. 
I know. I’ve looked into crypto classes and seminars. I’ve joined crypto meetup groups. But thus far I just study this reddit sub. Y’all are all my BFFs and you don’t even know it. Lol 
Fair enough. 
Clearly everyone eager to get their funds and buy these dips. 
Coins that are not top 10? Which coins?

I just closed off my long at break even.
Good point on the price points to set.  Let the divergence bring the fills to me. 

If I'm long, and a premium is growing, I don't shift the targets up, I let the market take it to me.  It's fun when the target fills on futures but wouldn't have filled on spot.  (but I don't close out the whole position in that case of course, so as it rides I can continue to benefit from the premium.  for example getting my 10.3 sells filled a few weeks ago was glorious)

But I had made this new ladder overly aggressive.  Cleared out the position and buys for now, and will redo it starting 7800 to target the lower thousand of the macro triangle formation.
I have nothing to this idea, just commenting his chart.
Hmm, I'd rather keep it with 9400 as the second touch, makes more sense to me. That wick above was just a fat finger IMHO. If we fall back into this wedge below 8100-8050 I'll shed a little tear. 
I mean that's eth...which was a low liquid alt. In the midst of a crypto boom. Very different circumstances 
usa customers need to be protected from themselves.
RemindMe! 1 year "Was the-physicist right about BTC?"
Yep and I stand by that.  50k within 2 years.  100k within 3 years.   4-5 years buckle up - I could buy a yacht.  That’s my prediction.    

Although to be honest, I probably would just buy a small yacht and do something more useful with the extra money. 
Hah, well you don’t have to convince me, I am short currently.  But I am betting on a bounce from 8000.  

OMG LAST CHANCE WE’ll EVER SEE COINS NEAR 8K, BETTER ADD MARGIN TO MY ACCOUNT SO I CAN INCREASE MY LONG.  
Do you have stops in place?

I'm afraid setting such a setup and a wick filling them all and stopping me at once...
I wasn’t kidding. This is the play i think he should do if he’s deep in the shitter
Apparently he wasn't... that's why I didn't ban. It's his right to share that opinion if it's actually his opinion. I might categorize this as a rule 3 violation, in that case; counter-intuitive rambling without reasonable support. It's a stretch to call it a low quality meme... but I could make that argument. I can't ban for it, though. It seems to violate  the nature of rule 1 even if it is his opinion... Tricky one.

Tagging to watch for spam.
No worries, and you're right to point out a long from 8200 would have been underwater for all but 2 of the 30 days before *that* :P
I meant close half with stops, not necessarily here. Although I think if you close here there's a decent chance you can reopen it higher. 
Maybe, but you do not want to go negative on this position at this point. 
What is better? 0.5% profit or 0.5% loss? Close half around 8000 and set a stop in profit. 
Yeah I don't know why that wasn't obvious to me. There are probably only like 50 people here and 5 of them just have a bunch of accounts. 

I can appreciate the PeaceHere shtick, whatever exactly it's supposed to be. I don't know if it's trolling or what. It's good stuff though.
I wonder if/when the next bubble cicle happens the same thing is going down with people who sold at 6k :p

Not true if you buy the last high.
Oh I remember 2008 very well, I'm not some kid. However, there are more variables at play now than there were in 2014. 
Or maybe the thousands of people in the market are right, and you are wrong.  Just a possibility.
lol at the notion that *all coins except the one you like* are ridiculously inflated. 
I'm new to this too, in since late November 2017. Sounds like you might benefit from learning about fundamentals of bitcoin, crypto etc. I suggest watching Andreas Antonopolous on YouTube, lots of video. Start with earlier ones. Also Vitalik to get some insight into etherium and ALTs. I believe they are genuine people. Stay away from others until you have a solid understanding.

I found them very helpful and was surprised at the lack of views on their videos.

Ofcourse you need to be learning constantly to keep up with the ideas and depth of crypto. 
If you find you have no interest in its possibilities for the future I'd personally be very wary about investing anything further into it. 

There was something about a noob DCA strategy posted round here that makes a lot of sense. 
If your convinced on the tech the price you just paid may look very favourable in a few years time.

Most important thing is make plan and stick to it and be patient. If you follow this sub you'll be tempted to make loads of trades and 99% of the time that is a very bad move for people new to it.
Yeah I agree about treating it as an anomaly.  And since it didn't break out on that move, but closed at the resistance, I feel the wick has less meaning for the formation too.
For sure! I don't think it's going to happen, I actually voted sub $6k in your recent poll.

Just catastrophic over 8500 (spot). I'll market close on the inevitable retrace of the MEX overshoot if we BGD up here. 
Yeah, I have a stop @ 7952. Missed the last one. I'll watch and wait.
Thanks. I took profit on 35% @ 7991 and have my stop in the green.
I will now sleep and hopefully wake up to a BRD in the morning.
Yet
i didnt say that, but even the most bullish bulls have to admit that some alts that don't even have a product, a community or any transparency are not worth what they are today. it's just speculation that they might be worth something 5 years down the line because they have a nice presentation or whatever. 
You guys are seriously naive if you think even 10% of alts today will survive the test of time. 

They are all shitcoins that will die. If you seriously believe in more than like 2 or 3 of them, you are a bagholder and will be scammed out of money in &amp;lt; 6 months 


go look at all the dot Com companies that failed. that's the majority of alts
Thank you for the insight I’ll check them out. I got in early December magically right before the run to 20k. So had some decent luck which gave me the balls to day trade. Since then I’ve just rekt my gains, and then some. So I’m back peddling. Slowing down and needing to reach out for help. I appreciate you taking the time to reach out. 
Exactly. I fully agree. Nonetheless, it's looking like troubling times ahead in the crypto kingdom. 
yeah if we do break above this triangle we're in it'd be exceedingly bullish. but  right now I think we're headed to test the bottom of it
A stop? 
the fact that there are people on this sub who still don't realize alts are going to die a violent death is not good. it's insightful though. It means alts haven't capitulated yet. 

Most alts are completely worthless shitcoins and will actually go to 1-10% of ATH. I'm surprised people here can't see that 
5-10-15B cap is peanuts compared to what smart contracts platform could be worth. I mean, in terms of organic price a few years from now. Let the speculation go on, and of course profit from it.
Just to extend your early web analogy further, how do you not know BTC will turn out to be Alta Vista? Netscape? Excite? MySpace? In many tech sectors, the founder is eventually surpassed by a younger, sleeker alternative. 

What’s likely to happen in the coming decade is that different industries will utilize the benefits of  different, specific crypto currencies. There won’t be just one coin that will “replace the dollar” in everything from agriculture to P2P to IoT to gaming etc. 

And while you’re technically correct that less than 10% of alt coins will “survive” (this is a very easy prediction to make and I doubt many disagree with you), even if 2% survive that leaves **50** crypto currencies, assuming there are about 2000.  Fuck it, let’s say just 20 survive; where does that leave BTC? Can it compete with 20, on name recognition and decentralization alone? Can it market to industries? Can it do what ETH or VET or Nano can do? 

And frankly, it’s not necessarily up to the tech to determine whether something will “survive”. What if, for example, Starbucks announces its teaming up with fucking Ripple as their exclusive crypto? That’s what killed HDDVD; Sony picked Blu Ray. There was nothing inherently wrong with HDDVD. 

I guess all I’m asking is why is BTC “the one” but literally everything else is “shit”? In all likelihood BTC will survive as one of many interesting products. 
A "take profit marked stop" for half. Am I doing it wrong?
yeah it really reminds me of the dotcom bubble, its crazy how much delusion there is and how EASY people throw money at businesses that are nothing but a name and a pitch.   
I was listening to a goldman sachs podcast last night and even though they are snakes in suits with not much clue they do know what is required for this to go mainstream, and we are faaaaaaaaaaaaaaar from that. that said I'd buy some of these alts, but not at todays prices.
Well I never meant to suggest BTC will survive and thrive. I think everything is overvalued right now. 

in general most cryptocurrencies are problems in search of solutions. there are some nice use cases but none of them warrant their current price right now

the space needs a good cleansing  and time to actually grow before it can succeed. right now it's exploding with get rich quick schemes 
it's really fascinating to watch, especially with how convinced people are that this bubble is different. I'm uncertain of the future of btc although I am bearish, but it's very likely that most alt coins will fade away into nothingness
yup. one thing that stuck with me is something that flibbr(?i think?) said, the last bear market was filled with strong sell pressure the entire way down and lots of false hope, that THIS time it will turn around. kind of feels like that now. every time theres a hint of bullishness on the chart everyone jumps on it, longs skyrocket, and expect new highs, but it just ends up dumping through support and we find a new 'hope'...
