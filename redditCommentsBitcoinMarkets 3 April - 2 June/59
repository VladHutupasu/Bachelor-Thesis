Coinbase decided to hype not one but two nothingburgers at the same time
16800 buyer here, still dead inside
Closed a big short, 7600 --> 6800 a few days ago (from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/87ycpl/daily_discussion_thursday_march_29_2018/dwgkulc/)), and havent entered a position since. Too large of a position for me, I over-did it and it was weighing on me (hence me not holding it as long as I intended). I'm looking forward to futures settlement tonight to get my money off of the exchange (OKEX). Exchange risk+ high leverage+ making an emotional decision paid off *this time*, but I'm "smart" enough to know I am *not* that smart. Took profit.

I hopped in a small long at 6700 here.

I keep expecting sellers fatigue, and a nice bounce up, but $7500 2 days ago looks like it may have been it. Not sure.

I'm trying to scalp this range tonight. It is yet to be seen if violating the larger green uptrend line is significant (I'm not confident a bunch of people are drawing that same line, which is important). If it is though, I expect a big move down in the next week or two. Downside there would be $5k.

As for upside medium term, I would really like to see a break of 6900, and then breaking the short term resistance downtrend line about 7100. Could signal a significant bounce if that follows through.

In summary, I'll be entering a large position **Short** below $6400, and longing a partial position above $6900, and then full size above $7150. in the mean time I'll fuck around with the range, and likely lose money like everyone else.

Happy trading out there folks.

Just found this sub and I wanted to thank all of you for participating. r/cryptocurrency gets worse by the day
Someone just sneakily bought 150+btc on a red candle on GDAX on the daily close... hmmm... guess he's betting on the doji

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2018/02/07/winklevoss-twins-bitcoin-will-be-worth-40-times-current-value.html

“Tyler Winklevoss hit back at critics.
"You know the criticisms are just a failure of the imagination," Tyler Winklevoss said.
"Cryptocurrencies aren't really important for human-to-human transactions ... but when machines-to-machines trade economic value, they are going to plug into protocols like bitcoin and ethereum. They are not going to open bank accounts at J.P. Morgan ... those were invented by bankers before the internet existed. Trying to use them as payments or money on the internet is a square peg in a round hole at best."
The other Winklevoss twin described a world in which driverless cars may pay other cars, or large number of devices will be making micro-payments, in which case digital currencies will be very useful.”
I had a large short position that got stopped out at break even overnight. After going massively underwater on a short last weekend and eating a loss into the rebound, I decided to play it safe with break-even stops at 6900. Of course, that executed by about $20, but it was a calculated risk (with no capital risk). I re-opened with 1/8th of the position at 6800 this morning and layered up to 6980. Spoiler alert, only one of those executed. So I found myself holding a meager short as we dumped $150.

After re-evaluating some more, I'm not seeing any indications that this is going to bounce significantly. I went ahead and added back up to 50% of my desired position at 6680, CA @ now 6715. I'm holding the other 50% in reserve for a potential bounce for now, but it certainly doesn't feel like it's coming. 

There's a lot of room in our 1h bear flag for it, though, and I'll target a 25% add over 6900.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/baCN8VTO/

I expect 7K resistance to hold at this point. 

edit to add: desired position is only 40% of stack. Keeping 50% in reserve for now and have another 10% dedicated to sept futures long layering from 6600-5100.
I am willing to hear other things and kinda concerned I'm missing something but I don't see crazy volume. We didn't really retrace on any of our drops today. I just see a bear flag on the 4hr and 1hr
Has anyone considered that with the state of the US economy, the coming bear market could be even longer than has been the case in the past? Past Bitcoin bubbles have burst and reinflated during a 9-year stock market bull run. If/when the market drops and a recession hits, flight to quality is likely to happen, and the "wealth effect" will disappear. People are likely to shy away from speculative assets like Bitcoin/crypto.

Most probably won't even consider buying again until the economy gets back on its feet, which could take 2-3 years. Of course this is speculative, but it would be an ugly double whammy.
For those of you who have been following me, I’ve invested 66% of planned fiat into a two-year trade at $6,700. I have other trading BTC that I may scale out if we rise over the next two years. I’m adding 11% here at $6,675. If $6K breaks, I’ll add the remaining 23% in increments depending on the drop.

CNBC's analysis is that crypto is down primarily because of taxes....man are they shilly

One of the top 10 traders on BitMex, anybody that knows more?
Someone else already posted something similar below: https://www.tradingview.com/x/5aR9FUBs/

These higher lows* are spookin me and my short a bit. I honestly wouldn't be surprised to see this break up. I took 50% profit on my short from 7300 at 6700. Holding the rest, which is basically a hedge on what's left of my cold storage, until break even.

Of course i would be even less surprised to see this to break down, but i certainly wouldn't be taking on a new position until it breaks one way or the other.

The 4 hour is basically just a long row of dojis atm, which i find kinda freaky.

Of course nothing has generally changed and there's no real reason this should break up, and if it does i don't expect it to go far, but i'd rather take some profits while they're on the table, rather than having to break even again on a quite profitable trade.

One way or another, it seems a directional decision should be coming soon.
If anyone got data relevant to possible reasons behind the $200 up movement started at 3:40am UTC, please post for everyone's benefit. Funding statistics, leverage data, liquidation, short/long charts, whatever you saw. 
A week ago somewhere I've heard that current ABC correction was 5 wave zigzag from 12k to 7k and we will have one more identical 5 wave zigzag. https://www.tradingview.com/x/2M9Fe2wI/ so what I did I've cloned it and didn't touch a thing in it https://www.tradingview.com/x/zTMjwOXS/ so far it was super accurate. Currently my buy target is at 5.6k and sell at 6.2k. Even though I don't believe we can go bellow 6k but lets see if this mirror thing actually will play out. Target after it would be bellow 5k. 
Did Coinbase president really have to come on air to announce this kind of thing? This is just a blog post worthy news...
Does anyone have knowledge as to whether exponential decay or something similar can be applied to bear markets? Or if there has been research into creating a mathematical model of the natural progression of bear markets, I'd love to hear about it.
Wtf - https://blog.coinbase.com/adding-support-for-bitcoin-forks-to-coinbase-c4bee020898c

Is this news? They're going to help trigger another sell-off.

Edit: I waited for 5 more minutes to see if they'll announce something else, but complete dud. Basically, 1) they are encouraging more shit forks and 2) committing to give people their share of it (shouldn't that have happened in the first place)
Regarding the upcoming Coinbase news on CNBC, the lead in was: 

"An announcement that will have the whole crypto world talking"

giggity

edit: lol forked coin support, really?  looks like I gigitty'd too soon, unless Coinbase pulls the old crypto switcheroo and has another announcement in the bag. CEO hasn't spoken yet on CNBC.

edit: the actual news is that they are launching a VC fund that will invest in early stage companies
[Falling wedge pattern](https://i.gyazo.com/99d7bcca980f7cea163304b02e39836c.png)

What do you guys think? It looks very similar to our last drop from 8k to 7k. BTC really likes this wedge. Would set up a nice double bottom as well.
On future specific tokens to be added to CB:

- we cannot list things that have regulatory uncertainty

- we will list more when there is more regulatory certainty

- there is no existing regulatory clarity on ERC20 coins not currently listed
Feels like we have been stuck at 6800 for ages.... Do something already!
[Long-term chart](https://imgur.com/a/vKdnk), wanted to show /u/ozone63 and figured the rest of y'all would want a peek as well.

Ignore the spider web, those are shorter-term lines. I think that bottom line is "the" support line that the market is wrestling with at the moment. Three perfect points of contact at the lows (November, February, and this week) as well as the previous high. Also of interest is a fractal that might play out: I see the huge formation we're in now as the potential bigger brother of June/July of last year...if so, we're somewhere around where the crosshair is in my screenshot. As they say, history doesn't repeat, it rhymes (and also nothing is guaranteed, this is just wild speculation)...but if sellers really do get exhausted here and the support holds, we could see a nice bounce to who-knows-where ($8k? $9k? we might even breach major resistance). Though I suspect, like that previous formation, that buyers will get exhausted themselves way way before any new ATHs (and maybe not even into the teens) and we'll end up back at these levels eventually.
In case you haven't realized it, the whales throwing around ~$300 5 minute candles is a sign of decreased liquidity, which is another telltale sign of a bear market.

As a side note, realize these whales are not going long like this to "sponsor" new bullish rallies, they're merely stop-hunting those in an opposite margin position.  

Best course of action is to leave this shit alone.
What does the one and only Bollinger see, the market botton near? https://twitter.com/bbands/status/981935959242555392?s=19
You know it's bad when a $250 pump gets people excited.
Should we be concerned with the relative lack of volume? AKA could this be a bull trap? Smart people, please enlighten me on this.
closed my june futs from 7.1 k here at 6.6.

have profits, might as well as lock it, way too many times have hanged on to a winning hand and thrown it away.

will short this thing if it gets to 7k (i hope)

or after the bounce from 6k .

would prefer the 7k though.
Big squeeze there. Resistance just evaporated after it broke 6700 on GDAX. 
No way whales are pumping/dumping the market at non rewarding price points.

As suggested by the bfxdata, 50% of whales think it’s going up and 50% think it is going down.

This is very different than the 600s days when it was a 10/1 ratio in favour of longs.

50% of going up? Thanks, i’ll take the odds.
Does anyone have any insight into the average amount of leverage used on shorts vs average amount of leverage used on longs? 
Disappointing downwards price action, looks like 6600's are gonna hold for a while longer
"Coinbase venture fund" is the other piece of news
[This is what I am seeing today](https://www.tradingview.com/x/LYp3Ggtb). Gonna open a short just above the ema9, since it has been paying off for the last week, and have been profiting nicely from it. SL is quite close too.

I know trading before triangle breaks is gambling a bit, but it has worked so many times lately that I can afford to pay an eventual loss.
Something to watch for is a very large adam & eve pattern. Of course the bottom could drop out and we could plunge to 5k any day. But some sideways from here would look pretty strong, IMO, if it happened.

Classic Wyckoff accumulation phase waiting for selling climax (shortly) and following break-out?
All RSI levels cooled off for a breakdown
a little off-topic but just want to let you guys know that coinbase will have an announcement on cnbc @ 2pm PST. I closed my short at break even because we might see some pump.
Was expecting to ride this short a while longer, but the chop, rising buy pressure and hopium ahead of this coinbase announcement, even if it comes out to nothing, made me close my shorts out. Intrinsically feeling like I can wait for better r/r than at this moment in time. I don't like the uncertainty with a large open position and I made really good profits. Worst case I should be able to re-enter fairly soon.
With a few $$ Up and down it is tuff to stay above the 6800. 

5$ - 10$ up or down doesn't make sense to trade now.

Well .. for me.

Traders here? Need your opinion.

By no means I know how to trade, but I see what is called "double bottom" that's been formed over the last 3 months. What do you guys think of that? Isn't it usually a very bullish sign?

https://imgur.com/a/mZx0m
I had to take my profit and get out my long, I really like what looks like a reversal on the 4hr but I'm not liking that potential [TK cross](https://snag.gy/9O1Zj0.jpg) in bearish territory coming, plus too much resistance above for me to stay in but hopefully it can get through all that. 
If 6.4/6.5k breaks, what do you think will be the next support level to bounce from? 6.1k or straight to <6k ?
My sell got filled at 6935. The tip of the bitmex fomo on perps. Guess I'm back in a short even though I never saw the price go above 6.9. 

Thinking of setting stops at 7.1. 

Edit: not setting stops but might manually close above 7.4 if we get there. 
Dont like these long wicks on 4hr.

Feels like pressure is building up and soon something is gonna pop pretty hard.
People here say "no volume" but the Bitfinex volume seem basically the same forever: https://i.imgur.com/FLgkttj.png

Where are you guys getting your volume information from? I heard finex was the market leader.
I keep trying to get a conversation going about the fractional reserve nature of Alts, but I'm not getting a lot of visibility on it. I decided to make a dedicated thread, if anyone has a moment to help me think through this stuff.

It may have been asked further down, but I'm on mobile and it's hard to search.  If China decides to dump some of it's US treasuries as part of the trade war, do we see an influx of more buyers?
Of *course* it was a false breakdown, and of *course* I sold the bottom of it. We broke the support line of the flag, I don't know what the hell this market wants. If I didn't sell, it would have plunged $200 in a couple of minutes...sigh.

Unsuccessful test of resistance, textbook bear flag, literally zero buy pressure... I won't claim that I understand a shit about this market, but honestly at this point I'll be extremely (and pleasantly) surprised if this breaks up.
https://twitter.com/coinbase/status/981999680329428992 WORST ANNOUNCEMENT EVER
I'm starting to question the long-term  viability of bitcoin lately. I don't know if this Is an overreaction to the bear market or just a reality check.

If bear market persists, no vendor is going to want to accept BTC as a payment method. If we recover and continue growth, vendors will accept BTC but nobody will want to spend it.

Unless we have years of relatively sideways/ less volatile movement, I just can't see adoption increasing. Without adoption, this may aswell be a pyramid scheme or a day trading video game. 

I dunno, maybe the bear market is just getting to me.

Basically, it was a great period for commenters - some of them made a lot of karma and some of them lost a lot of karma. Keep on reporting shitposts, thats where karma should be awarded.
Back in my day, a proper bear market involved hugging the main resistance line for days/weeks (and even occasionally breaking through it, only to start a new line) before dropping like a rock. This bear market has a whole lot more of the dropping like a rock part, and not enough hugs. I'm not a fan.
Overall sentiment still bearish on weekly but we are forming a slightly higher low and a lower high. Still got a few days to go on this weekly candle but it looks like its tightening up.

On the daily, should be a quiet day after yesterdays dump imo.

Probably not gonna try trading today, too low to short with conviction but not stable enough to long with conviction.

However, if 6.4k breaks with conviction then i might short
Just see some big ass bear flags on the 4hr breaking down from 9.1 and a smaller fractal of it from 7.4
I got distracted at work when the price was at 6.4k, got back and it's fighting for 6.9k - those sweet gains I missed! Time to quit? :P
1hr bbands getting tight, wouldn't be surprised if it falls through 6600s within the next 2 hrs or so

sub is slowly gettin bullish again 

lol

but i aint shorting anythin below 7k 


After doing the maths I'm switching my miners off at 6k (if it gets there). As it's break even.
What’s the most amount of Fiat/BTC you have lost on a bad trade? How did you deal with your losses? 

For me, it was a $3,500 loss and i dealt with it by going to the casino and hitting my lucky number in roulette 3x in a row and making 75% back. ( DO NOT ADVISE ) 
(rewriting my last post since it was just as the daily thread closed)

That is a really nice hammer on the 4hr. I think we'll see 7k soon, but only to be rejected. (However, I was wrong about 7k holding so maybe I'll be wrong about 7k providing resistance.) I'll just hold onto my current position for now and wait to see where this goes. I don't want to sell now only to be miss another pump.
Im not sure if interlinking is allowed, but I'd like to point out the quality of this thread https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/89r79c/lets_not_be_naive_bearish_post/. Especially the longer sceptical comments there. Everyone trading here should read it, even if only to find out how strong their bullish resolve is in light of arguments like those. 

I personally especially liked the part where it was proposed that a use case for Bitcoin, or one of many, could be just what this sub is doing - trading, speculating. A perfected multiplayer game for traders, if you will.
Bear flag's gonna bear flag: https://www.tradingview.com/x/HzD9VDAT/

Hope the shorters and the long scalpers took that gift wick above 6900. I caught 6880 but my next add was about $20 above the wick.
Do people here attempt quick, high-leverage scalps for quick profit?
E.g. go 25x short, pull out after a 80-100 dollar drop - quick 25ish% profit. I'm talking about trades that only take around 60-90 mins.

Its not impossible to pick the short term price fluctuations on the 30 min. 

The main risk is getting bad luck with your timing and placing an order right before i big spike/dip in the opposite direction. Are there ways to minimise the risk of this or minimise the losses that come from it e.g. stoplosses.??
So many pumped coins for nothing, what a waste of everyones time. FU Coinbase.
would not be surprised if there was a small short squeeze here
Don't FOMO (either way), people. Still *well* within our bear flag. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/P4NJP0LV/

Know your targets, folks. One of my adds at 6840 hit. Got another at 6960.

Edit: for those bears who were on the fence earlier, here's your first short entry /u/thisismynsfwuser
so just wondering, its pretty obvious right about now, that the mm/scalpers/whales are the only ones buying btc.

they buy at a lower rate and sell at a higher rate ala short; rinse and repeat and basically make a killing both directions.

so whats the end game here?

is this gonna go on forever or something.

when does it become not profitable for the mm.

and am sure there are dolts shorting btc at the lower end and buyin btc at the upper end also known as shorting the bottom and lnging the top.

and am sure there are  way too many noobs in this space right now, that this will always be proftiable for the mm,.

but yep just wondering what the end game is as btc sole purpose right now has become a game of liquidations and profit taking

Failed to break through 38.2% resistance twice and now rejected at 23.6% (https://i.imgur.com/bGDB1VI.png). I think this is resuming the downtrend soon.
https://i.imgur.com/ec7LCcN.png

It will be interesting to watch whether we get a repeat of what happened during the March bounce, this is somewhat of a fractal. Could get pumped to 7-7.2K.
literally no one is buying BTC. Not Wall Street, not hedge funds, not mom and pop, not Mrs Watanabe, not dumb money, not smart money

But they will... Whenever the headlines are back, people will FOMO

I think we just made a higher low. But I’ve been saying that since 8500, so wtf do I know at this point.

But shorting here is silly IMO. We just dumped... we should be good for this week
This is looking like a complete breakdown headed below 5k.  
Is there some kind of indicator to see the positive/negative flow of coins getting moved into long to medium term holdings? I'm curious how many unique people are actually accumulating here. I would think if going sideways long enough, eventually the bears would run out of BTC to sell. Obviously the flip side is true for bulls and their fiat, but I'm surprised it's happening this far away from 6k.

Hopefully all that makes sense, this is my first real post despite lurking for quite some time.

The trader looks at the chart in utter shock. He jumps in his seat as he exclaims " That wasn't a real run up!? Who could of seen this coming!"

"No one" a redditor replied to the dismayed day trader.
Potential trade war --> China lets yuan devalue --> Capital flight from China increases --> Demand for BTC increases --> Price increases 

Several things have to happen in order for this to happen, but I think it's a plausible scenario.
WTF? Yolo pump before breakdown??? Wow
If I short with 1000 units at 5 leverage and bitcoin drops 10%, how much have I made? I thought I understood this but I’m getting confused now

Is this a fake out or breakout? Probably just an oversold bounce...
How long has the ability to short with leverage existed in the Bitcoin marketplace? 

Im asking in reference to its impact (if any) on price action 
This pump will become more convincing if it breaks through mid 6900s (38.2% retrace/high from the pump 6hrs ago). Even then, there is considerable resistance at 7k. Will wait for confirmation before entering/exiting any positions.
Back in my shorts basically where I left them, kraken can thank coinbase for the exchange fees
I'm liking my chances on this long. Basically breakeven already. Will close at 7500 tomorrow. No need to be greedy. Somebody obviously has a lot of coins to pay back, and they're now finding that Bitcoin explodes up a lot more easily than it falls down.
Nobody should be worried about the price or feel down. I am mostly talking to the noobs and weak hands. If you are in a loss. Stay strong cause the next halving is going to be beyond parabolic. If you think this was a big bubble you are in for a shock when the next halving happens. It usually even takes place 3 months earlier. Imagine the media attention... just chill out and ride this out.

Stoch RSI bottomed or low on all timeframes above the hour (except 12hr),  MACD is turning over like dominoes, MA cross has started hitting on lower timeframes and going up to hit the 30min next, last time shorts went up like this we had a 1k run.   Not looking too bad, but there is a lot of resistance so should be a good fight and have my stops ready. 
There seems quite a bit of support between 6600-6850, maybe I'll buy back in?  Naaa
so 25x long here and easy money right.

after all that bounce t o6.9 is just round the corner.

right?

edit: closed it here at 6.75 , very small long for kicks.

strange one the whales have made it very easy for degen gamblers to make money.

Watch it go to 7,100 only to massively dump again.
Lots of longs were closed today, meanwhile shorts are increasing. I'm expecting a short squeeze followed by a drop to lower support levels (~6,500).

Any thoughts on this analysis?

When in doubt, zoom out.  Or check your moon math update.
According to Wyckoff's principles this 6.x bottom might be a double bottom because we are experiencing a low volume retest of the lows.

[https://twitter.com/PeterLBrandt/status/981124346289774593](https://twitter.com/PeterLBrandt/status/981124346289774593) \(Possible to interpret chart as a falling wedge \(E&M\) , serving as a low volume retest of the low \(Wyckoff\) at least using volume from exchange \)
Taking a gamble. 4hr is getting tight, i still think its gonna pop and im betting its down.

Entry: 6754
Stop loss: 6933

Those Buy spikes are useless.. they are kicked down very fast. 
Oh well .. maybe it will create higher lows.


So this is it, Bitcoin is tamed. Move along. Nothing to see here. Let's go short the next inflated asset. Any suggestions?

I think we've reached an accommulation zone. I can see us trading sideways around these levels for quite some time (weeks to months) as the big players slowly load up.

As we keep moving lower i just think we are going to start running out of sellers. 

We've retraced all the way back to late November price levels. Most OG holders will be hesitant to sell this low, or they sold already to buy in lower.

I'm waiting to see if $6,000 holds as support. Seemed like strong support last time we tested it. 

Keep in mind there are a lot of people sitting on the sidelines waiting to buy back in. It's going to be harder to keep pushing the price down so why not keep it rangebound while you stop hunt and accumulate?




Edit: Because I'm being down voted for what I assume is lack of substance I have addied my reply to another user above after the break line.
Just closed my 6750 long from last night ( europe) with reasonable profit at 6838. Was looking at a retest at 7k as we had on the hourly a clear trend exhaustion downwards. looking for a short entry if we break 6430  
Edit: maybe closing too early... but can't babysit the charts today. 
any forecasting on price for the coming 12hs? 
Do you think NASDAQ-100 marketcap anyhow related to bitcoin price? It seems to be recovering today and bitcoin is not falling anymore even it feels it is doomed to reach 6k soon.
30 min MACD might be the flattest I've ever noticed. 
Noob question: I'd like to start trading with leverage, but after seeing whales go hunting for shorts/longs I'm wondering what a safe leveraged position would look like? 5x? 10x?
I plan to hedge but I don't want to see my position liquidated only to have the price reverse and put me out of position.
Any advice is appreciated
Is there going to be a stream for the coinbase thing?

 I feel like something like that could give us a bit of positivity and maybe a bit of a rally but if we carry on in the current trend they may just consider BTC to be dead in the water and throw out the idea.

Wow. This is the steepest pump for a while. Both bears and bulls are getting rekt.
I'm scaling into long term positions here on various crypto's and saving 65% of my fiat for DCA lower. I like these price levels, where I can by back almost everything I sold off and keep massive profits. (playing with house money). The amount of bear post vs bulls is a telling sign. Seems a lot like the top where everything was moon and it was going up forever. 
Not to get ahead of myself but my 7k sell limits dont have high prospects of getting filled now. Looks like a wonky HS on smaller timeframes breaking down. Target is yesterday's low. 
[removed]
This price action looks eerily similar to the one from 7.4-9.2. We made 2 runs at breaking 9.2 and  the first was stronger than the second (buyer exhaustion?). 

I'm looking for a lower high at 7.2-7.3 to short. Expecting sub 6k close within a week. 
[removed]
I see a nice doji on the 6h. Anyone else?
So... There seems to be two different wedges at play. Any thoughts on which one would be the stronger one? I tend to think it's the bigger/outer one here:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/demToQNK/

At this point, the outer wedge would provide resistance at somewhere around 7.5k. Considering that 7.5k also was the recent local top, I expect lots of resistance there. But should be a nice pop if we break that resistance...
Announcement is that Coinbase is launching a VC fund to invest in small businesses.
The current end of triangle appears to be tapering up. Is this what they call "projection"? (Or another term meaning it's signaling where it's tending to break)
Holy shit. I expected more downwards movement but lately there aren't even any notable bounces any more. Was hoping for $7.1k at the very least, but at this rate we'll be sub $6k before the weekend begins...

Bears feeling euphoric in here. Seems like time to long :)

Edit: [Long from 6624 :)](https://i.imgur.com/kjRY1wj.png)
Some people say that BTC is levitating due to FOMO rallies, I say it is the strength of the underlying asset.  So so strong.  It was a bubble, but now it is not.  We are not in the midst of a massive downtrend.
Really hard to be a bear at this point, the bullish patterns will complete, completing larger patterns mmm

People are expecting a v type bounce from a large fall to declare a bottom but tbh, looking at the price action overnight we'd have to go sub 6k to get that and that would invalidate a double bottom.

This confused the hell out of me and suggests a move lower. The bounce from 6500 wasn't much of a bounce either at $250.
Everything is moving sideways...
In the US, I always wake up to a big dip. Think this will happen again tonight?

I'm currently margin trading on Kraken but the interface and liquidity is not ideal. I would like to switch but I'm not sure if I should go on bitfinex or bitmex?  Any advice? Thanks!

Edit: thanks to all! 
6714$ on bitfinex and almost 20% down on Indian exchanges 
Kraken down?
I wonder what Coinbase is announcing at 5PM on CNBC?
I was honestly hoping for a pump to 9k or so, if we were following 2014 bear market. If we were to follow 2014, we'd see a pump to 9ish followed by a dump to the lower 5ks. From there, we'd be a bit sideways until we broke out of the downtrend channel to retest 9k and eventually make a new low, probably around 3k.

Just hypothetical.
[removed]
Daaaang bulls came out to play.
[removed]
If this level holds we found the bottom. I am sure that FOMO will kick in, if we would go up here past 7.5k. Told many people that if they wanna invest in crypto it is a good time now. r/R quite good.
usual sequence of events for bad news (like this indian news) is initial sell off as people react to news followed by a bounce as people buy the dip before they see the news, followed by a few days of selling as people finally see the news and sell
Anyone think we can hold 6400-6500 this time?
Am I the only one seeing massive volume spikes every 2 hours one way or the other on GDAX?
[removed]

[removed]
OK so my thoughts on the future here.. We are going to 6k, within a week but probably a lot less than that. 

I'd think we'll get another dcb off of 6k. Back up to roughly where we are now. We'll hold again and the  bleed back down to 6k.

We'll then break under 6k and the shit will hit the fan. If I'm right the 5k region is where mining could be unprofitable? So I'd be interested to see what happens there.

I'd love to think we bounce for good at this 5k mark, maybe going into the 4s a bit but I'm hoping that will be the end and we'll reverse like a bitch. 

If it isn't the end I've heard from somewhere, although I forget where, that somewhere under 2k is then the most likely price area should we break under 4k.
 I would be amazed to see that but I guess with Bitcoin the way it is recently it probably shouldn't be a massive surprised.

It's a big old mess right now 
Quite enjoying this 6500-6900 channel over the last couple of days, it's been too predictable, which is making me increasingly nervous...

Bitcoin Will See a Major Bull Run in 2018, Experts Claim

https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/04/05/bitcoin-will-see-major-bull-run-2018-experts-claim/
Been a good night at the casino.  I'm putting the cash I walked in with in a Trezor and going 3x long with my winnings 6649 should it get there. Wish me luck!  Imma sleep like a bay bay 2 night, y'all. &#9765;
Have shorts laddered up all the way from 7k to 7.5 k 

So if everybody is shorting in that range will we pump to 8k to liquidate all the shorts ?
who makes the most money traders or hodlers? Is it possiable to even tell?
Spoofy whales out in full force tonight it seems, highly highly doubt it would actually take 1000 coins to dump $50 (BFX).

Is this the longest the daily RSI has been below 30?  It's been almost a month.
Stay strong. Buy more on this dip if you can afford it. If not put in cold storage and go away for a few years.
Patience is virtue
Don't be the 6800 shorter 
man i still remebr 17k on the dcb, was long from 13k and was so confident that we were gonna make a ath, boy was i wrong, 

closed it at 15.3 or something.

feels like yesterday, that the default position on btc was a long. 
I bought from 900 - 1100 in 2013 and then saw the price drop all the way to 300.  I kept buying in 2014, 2015 and 2016.  2018 looks just like 2014.  Hang in there.
Ahh. You crossed over. Welcome to hodl life. 
Let me congratulate you on your strong hands. I was weak and sold my hodl stash, making so much profit i covered all the exchange fees, and bought a picture of a lambo.

But i am still dead inside too.
I'm thinking we're gonna drop some more until the daily or 6 hour is over sold which will put us in the 6k range.  There is a lot of potential for a huge bounce off 6k so shorting at 6.4k seems dangerous.  good luck. 
Great to hear from you...one of the best posters here. Wish you would post more often!

Congratulations on the trade, and even more so for recognizing your limits.

Quick note on the green line: switch to log, and make a line connecting the November low, February low, and the recent $6.5k low...it matches up perfectly! (And also hits a previous top, as well). That might be "the" line, and any bulls need to hope we don't test/cross it again or a bloodbath will almost certainly ensue.
So many people (myself included) are targeting 5000 as the next bottom that it feels like it's going to become a self-fulfilling prophecy.

I wasn't around in the past couple of years, but I wonder if there was a similar sentiment previously.
This sub has its share of garbage too, but it's mostly traders and not just HODLers, so you'll get a lot more knowledge and valuable insight here. 

Just be warned, even the best traders here are wrong very often - I've been watching for months here and many other places and I'm pretty much at the point where I believe NO ONE can accurately figure out which way Bitcoin is going due to all the manipulation.

The only thing that appears to work is the saying "the trend is your friend". We're in a downtrend, so the best trading advice is related to shorting - but the opposite will be true once the trend reverses (if it does)

Lol, you'll find that this sub ebbs and flows similarly
It was less, and I wouldn't read too much into it...I've been making some very poor decisions lately. This means we're probably headed back down.
The fact that this purchase (I saw it as ~98 coins) didn't even move the market substantially tells me that we can expect a move downward. Likely sharply. The RSI on most time frames has reset from today's sideways action. I'll be as happy as anyone if we have a break upwards, but I've put myself in position in case we take the big dive downward.

Edit: [We're approaching the top of the current descending channel.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/kLNNMzK6/)

Should be interesting.
Someone just sneakily sold into a liquijuicy 150+btc wall without causing a cascade downward spiral... guess he will keep doing it

Surprised that their price hasn't just completely tanked in the last couple days.
Already got my popcorn ready!
Lol by bugging it they prove they are dumb, by fixing it they prove they are centralized.

What leverage are you using though? 
Any profit taking targets for the short?

I'm taking 50% of what is remaining on mine around 6450 and will decide the other half later.
We don't need crazy volume, a lot of our rises don't have volume, just the nature of the beast.   This seems to be constant talking point but if you look at a lot of our rises they don't have any volume. 
What do you think about the hammer in your bearflag in the 4hr?
2-3 years is ok with me. It takes time for Lamborghini to release updated models.

On a more serious note, i think you are right, the last few month the press and media were pretty negative, everyone was talking about a bubble, bitcoin goes to zero etc. etc. 

In a recession normies will not run in the door to invest in crypto, everyone is scared to end up jobless or even homeless. 
I think a stock market correction that occurs in the midst of a strong US / global economy wouldn't be a disaster for BTC. But if Trump continues to drive a trade war and attack tech companies needlessly, and the economy actually suffers (the unemployment rate goes up, GDP goes down), I am inclined to agree that it could be brutal for BTC.
Did you know that btc got created because of banks greed in 07 crash?

"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks"

https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Genesis_block#cite_note-block-1 

Retail got double screwed on a potential stock market crashed. They got fucked in the traditional market and on BTC by buying in november on above 8k.

A stock market crash would have a short term bad impact on BTC (broke people) but still good for the long term(doesnt mean ATH any time soon).
Actually, we won't know if Bitcoin is a success or not until the stock bubble pops. 
If my memory is serving me correct, Japan recognizing btc as legal currency in early 2017 was a major catalyst in getting out of the bear market. 

I think there needs to be some great crypto news for the masses, other than market makers, to begin accumulating at these prices to get out of the bear market considering the state of the global economy. I think any bounce is just going to be a bull trap created by market makers. I think people are beginning to catch on to this and don’t want to buy only to get dumped on. 


might be an exit to safe haven and bitcoin pushed along with gold... who knows. 
Posted this yesterday but it's not the worst thing for the long term of crypto for the stock market to crash at the same time. It gives crypto a bit of a scapegoat as opposed to if its bubble burst and the markets went on as usual. This sets up nicely for 1-3 years of development time so that crypto is more ready for primetime usage and adoption

There will be some major altcoin winners and losers in this period, that's for sure.
Depends if people move into crypto as a safe haven asset. We might expect some sort of immediate hit, but thereafter who knows. Gold and silver also often drop in tandem with a market crash (at least at the beginning, as people liquidate their PM positions to cover margin calls etc etc). Thereafter the narrative changes depending on how protracted the crash may be. Crypto seems well placed to benefit as an alternative place to put money imo. It could go either way.
I bullish long-term, but we might not see 19000 again until 2020.  I will wait patiently.
Of course you are completely right but prepare to get downvoted for suggesting that Bitcoin isn't a life necessity and might be a primarily speculative high risk asset right now. 
There is a nature to FUD. It is tightly woven for profits and to show allegiances. When timed just right with other things like classic TA .. pivotal moments in TIME become very important to certain people. The news of this president being corrupt and basically reorganizing the entire govt to be pro-business is potentially good for bitcoin in the long run really.. not that I like the dude... But there is a reason many of the worst things on earth happen all around the same time. We could see some major change under the hood that could accelerate bitcoin's tripped up growth.
way too soon. why rush it? if its anything like last time, you'll have a year to time your entry. there is zero signs that the 20K FOMO will return any time soon. really don't understand this move.
Why would you add another 11% $25 under your 66% entry? Genuinely curious. 
the 11% add makes no sense... id put that in in case the bottom falls out of this wonky barrel
Do you have a point you would sell? Of it continued to fall
Seems they just tweeted it
Adding Support for Bitcoin Forks to Coinbase

Tom Lee says that there could be 25 billion in taxes owed for crypto gains.  

He also said that some exchanges are subject to US tax.  And they might be selling btc to cover taxes owed. 


CEO of coinbase said he doesn't know if it is the main cause or not, I never heard anyone said "primarily" did you?
Shocked that their crypto analysis is on par with their equities analysis.  /s
Seen him in the trollbox a lot. He's the guy I saw say "watch this" right before the $300 candle from $6900-$7200 a couple days ago lol
Have you looked at the leader board? https://www.bitmex.com/app/leaderboard

It is amazing really. Just within the top 25 the range is 282 to 4000BTC. The top 1 has won almost 4x as much bitcoin as the top 4
He’s been around a long time. Him and CryptoCobain and others made a killing through 2014/15 bear market and most likely through to the end of 2017 upswing. Most definitely got into ETH presale and pretty much killed it from there. 

Entertaining to follow though. 
I'm not sure why you're spooked by that formation. It's bearish in nature.
The shitcoin Tron is trading high volumes of BTC on Binance. A lot  of BTC has been pumped there lately and any moment they will start taking profits and the slushing those BTC back creating a big short squeeze in BTC USD. 
Edit: reason, added to Bithumb SK.
doesn't make sense for every high leverage short to make easy money.
I don't think the exact time was really a factor. Technical bounce seems the most rational reason, with volume on this leg up matching the last leg down. I don't expect this to be a significant bounce.
Bitcorn.
Good luck mate

Basically he did a good job shutting up the news anchors constantly asking about Ripple.

Also lol at saying investing in companies from alumni and not in coins to avoid "conflict of interest". Completely talking about Charlie Lee and LTC
I love how they made a big deal about adding all these new coins late last year, and now they've decided they just can't do it. If they are really waiting for regulatory certainty, they could be waiting for years...
yeah that's pretty big news actually
Mexican standoff-esque. 

B-bands are tightening. A break will come eventually. I'm betting on down.

76.4% fib right at $5k with support there.

If you don't believe the bear market is the end of crypto, the bear market can be understood as the accumulation market. Big money will not pump the market since they need time to accumulate, but neither will they let it dump to death.
Give it 3 - 6 months, and if the US has a recession pick up some coin on the cheap and lock it away
the responses are hilarious:

He also called the top at $5500 in late October, just before the CME/Cboe announcements lit the rocket fuse.
There aren't many alts I care about, but if we dump more and I can buy XLM at or under $0.10, I will drop an entire paycheck on it.

One that essentially mimics and in fact paints a lower high than one we *just* had a few hours ago
lol this is going to become a meme.  A couple days ago it was...
"You know it's bad when a 150$ pump gets people excited."
Looks like a bull trap. Low volume, bounced off 6600 and stalled at 6800 (previous support turned into resistance). We've been in the 6800 range for the past 12+ hrs, I can't see why the market would suddenly decide now is the time to buy back and push to 6.9k+

A shooting star/gravestone doji about to close on the 1hr also looks pretty bearish
Price movement has been stupid ever since the bounce from 7.3 to 9, good luck to anyone trying to swing trade. 
i closed my long at 6780 this doesnt look like "the one" lookin for a decent short entry now
Bull flag getting painted on the 15m..
U mean closed at 6.8k?
if it follows the previous fractal of 18-26 March, there will be another lower high here to 7200ish and then a steep fall. but i would not rule out a fall straight from here, RSI cooled down enough.
Are you referring to buy/sell ration? Because it looks broken on bfxdata.
> As suggested by the bfxdata, 50% of whales think it’s going up and 50% think it is going down.

What? Do you mean shorts vs longs ratio?
but whats the pooint in even going to 7k now.

everybod yis gonna short or sell and underwater longs are gonna close.

what gain is to be had for the whales from pumping it up here.

i personally think we will dump to 6k , hold there for like an hour or something so that all the noobs fall head over heels in shorting  the corn and then bang, upto 7k and liquidate the lot and then back down again.



Starting to feel like the 8k sideways action from March 26~28. 

If history repeats then one more day of this then the day after we go down. Convenient timing, people will reinforce their "weekend dump" confirmation bias.
What’s your profit target?
Yup, watching that, but confirmation is way up at 11.8.

We'll break downtrend before confirming this.

E: but if it's confirmed target will be at around 16.8...
He's back! Just in time for the bull run, how convenient... :p Glad you're back was wondwring qhat happen to your postings.
I've been watching this for about a week. I doubt it will play out but it would be nice.
When you say 'selling climax', does that mean... a dip and a good buy-in price? Cuz I would love that.
Your not kidding, even the five minute is in the 30's now

THoughts on what it could be related to?
the index fund had no effect IIRC but it was mid-dump while it was happening

typically good news doesn't move the needle much in a bear run
It will probably just address the ripple fiasco. 
could be announcing the date for the coinbase index fund to go live as I haven't seen a set date. has anyone else?

edit: info about the index fund: https://blog.coinbase.com/announcing-coinbase-index-fund-3925fbf548db
Well their last "major" pre-annoucement  announcement on CNBC turned out to be a flop.  

Was pretty funny to see the anticipation in here suddenly evaporate into noxious fumes and there were no consequences on the price.
Coinbase news be like "hey here is some more ways you can buy something that nobody is using". 

Would adding 10,000 ways to buy a bent tin can make you want it more? No? Me neither.

 IDC about this type of news, I only care about anything that helps with widespread adoption.
Bearflagception. It's like those stacking russian cup doll things: https://www.tradingview.com/x/o5FEjonb/ (not a serious chart)

But yeah, I'm going to be away from the charts for 4-5 hours tonight, including through whatever shenanigans coinbase is pulling, so I'm debating doing the same. Probably just going to reduce and ladder up.
Ladder up from 6.9-7.1. I closed out 2/3 of my position at 6.73. Have sells scattered from 6950 to 7100. 

On the other hand this news could be a nothing burger or a sell the news type event so I don't want to be completely out for now. 
not if we ask bitmex to add 1000x leverage.
It's only a double bottom if we break the level of the first rebound, which is $11.7k. Until then it's nothing more than a dead cat bounce.
The fact it doesn't bounce a second time gives a high probability that this time, the floor will fall out from under it. 
If we break upward it will be. Bottom of the second "V" may not have been found yet. 3% variance of trough #1 is standard for these.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/ydSXq6Yh/
commenting just to say your username made me lol.
Are you using crypto inputs for cloud or regular
maybe some hesitation at previous local bottom of 6k
We're about to find out soon.
I'm expecting a bounce from $5.8k to $6.4k (previous support turned to resistance). Bulls will think we'll reverse from there. Bears will short the shit out of it.
Lol who the fuk is fomo ing here 
I think up

Wouldnt the bottom have fallen out by now? Who is selling sub 6500?
I get my volume stats from whichever exchange supports my bias. 
That volume is in BTC. As BTC has dropped, fiat volume has as well: https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/volume/6m/USD?c=e&r=week&t=a&vu=curr

This is obviously to be expected to a degree, but flat volume in a bear market is decreasing fiat volume. Combine that with increased margin trading, and I think it's actually a steeper decline than it looks. 
Zoom in ;-)

Since this bear market, most volume came from dumps, the rises have practically no volume, hence people saying "no volume" all the time.
I'll be tracking the discussion I just don't have anything to add to it, thanks for the effort
Yes, because wat? 
We'd see the value of the dollar inflate, wouldn't we?
give it time
> I don't know what the hell this market wants.

Maximum pain
when did we break it, still looks intact to me
Do you owe taxes for holding, or just when you cash out?
Right before maximum carnage.
We still havent capitulated and entered the dispair stage of a bubble pop trend so I think we will be on the dark side of the moon until we have reached low prices. Somewhere between 1.2K and 3K ish. Could be wrong, but holding just fiat is very comfortable atm imo.

[Chart](https://prnt.sc/j170gm)
lmao worse than a nothingburger

r/cc rekt
why? BTG support was long overdue, as was BCH withdrawals.
You are correct, right now the actual use case for BTC is that it serves like a virtual currency for a trading video game. 

The "digital gold" narrative makes absolutely no sense as its value curve and price action doesn't actually behave like gold in any shape or form.

It's a speculative asset that needs massive liquidity to work as a monetary system. There will be a series of bubbles in conjunction with adoption. If it happens it will take a little time and a lot of volatility. 
> If bear market persists, no vendor is going to want to accept BTC > as  a payment method.

Wrong. They will work with an integrated provider that quotes the price and credits them the fiat currency, conversion and all done automatically - and fast thanks to lightning.
Out of a sense of decorum and knowing the audience of this sub I don't really get into it, but I am far more bullish on potential adoption of smart contracts than of Bitcoin. That's not to say that Bitcoin can't develop its own smart contract uses (Rootstock) but it is far behind in that game and it certainly isn't a focus. One aspect that appeals to me is the emphasis on enterprise use cases and for back-end efficiencies (not relying on any consumers to directly adopt or ever have to directly use). 
it's crazy how history repeats itself
Bitcoin needs to be less volatile to be used as a form of payment (or it needs to be fast/easy to go between fiat and btc, but even if super quick/easy the fact that an extra step is involved is already a big turnoff). Doesn’t matter where price settles, but it needs to settle...
I don't think adoption matters much for such a speculative asset. If we see another massive BTC bubble in the future, it will probably fueled by a "hedge against inflation" narrative.
>If we recover and continue growth, vendors will accept BTC but nobody will want to spend it.

So what do people spend instead? USD? Why wouldn't they convert most of the USD to Bitcoin in the first place if they are sure it'll go up?

You are right. If only I'd thought of this seven years ago instead of wasting my money. I can't believe it never occurred to me or anyone else in the marker all this time. I best get out now while I can!
Looks like this news is gaining steam..awaiting bloomberg, CNBC, rueters..we're dropping
Why can’t these governments let people do whatever the fuck they want with their own money. 
Copied from the other thread:

1) This isn't an outright ban. Most of the bigger banks had stopped servicing crypto businesses in the last few months. There's still a 3 month timeline for this current set of rules to come into effect - the exact time window required for point 2 below.

2) The RBI is looking at releasing its own fiat crypto. Could potentially be a way to regulate fiat-crypto entry/exit in the future.

4k!
MMs would be scared AF seeing a viral YT videos/facebook groups discussing shorting
[deleted]
Is it just me or was PeaceHere banned after those insult tirades the other day? They on to a new username?
Any updates on the new mod contest?
Which is why it will probably be over far quicker
just dont.

dont short 6.4, rather pick a stagnant price point and try deducing a direction and stick with it and have enough ammo in case it goes against u.

but shorting 6.4 is a bad idea, the mm/whales will swallow the bottom shorters in whole. 

and trust me, if you try shorting 6.4, you will prolly end up shorting 6.1 or something thanks to the frenzy and system overload and brain doing weird things in the moment.
To be honest, the daily looks like it is just setting up to take out the 6.4k and 6k support later today. 

The weekly chart also does not inspire confidence. We are now sitting on top of the 50 week SMA at approx 6680 without any evidence that this can bounce, and if we fall below that, would be the first time we are under the 50 week MA since Oct 2015. 
> However, if 6.4k breaks with conviction then i might short

 I see the same level based on the support line drawn from the last bubble high. Where do you get it from?
Whats the target?
I see 1-hour bear flag, target 5500~
You joke, but for someone like me, learning that missed gains are not the same as actual losses is an important lesson.
>those sweet gains! Time to quit? :P

No! It's time to double down! /s

In all seriousness, if you're on leverage, closing a position in green and waiting for the trend to become more clear might be a good idea. If you're just holding bitcoin, I say hodl. I think selling your bitcoin under $7000 is a bad trade. 
all the longer RSIs are the the coolest they've been for an attempt at 6500
i wouldn't be surprised if we see a little short squeeze produce a better exit to your long.  wait it out a little longer. 
So far lately. +/- 50$ Up and +/- 60$ Down. Unfortunately,  And on Low volume.
Let's see.

Yea it's like people get all excited for BTC to 3k the moment we get a touch under 7k, and all the late shorters dump the price into mid 6ks. Then whales buy it all up, push the price back over 7k, where overexcited bulls buy the breakout to totally ride it to 9k... then the folks that bought in 6ks dump it back down into the hands of eagerly awaiting late shorters again.

It's like people *still* haven't realized that the way to make money here is to buy bottoms and sell bounces rather than trying to join breakouts / breakdowns. 

Obviously at some point a move in either direction will stick, but a lot of folks are gonna be out a lot of money by the time that happens. 
It's every time the wave goes up a little bit.  
There is no Fresh Money entering BTC right now only leaving for Tax Payments, what we see is just the Circulating Bitcoins/USDT Moving BTC<->USTD based on Sentiment.
Can't you just hedge with a short?
Will you wait for difficulty to adjust and jump back in?

What are you mining?
Cool if more people do this and difficulty adjusts down noticeably I might fire up my miners again.
Why not just keep mining and see it as an investment as the price might go back up in another bullrun
Last november I was liquidated for about $20k. Felt like shit for a week or two then slowly started working my way back. Took a few hours to lose it and a few months to build it back with very low leverage. High leverage sucks. Never again.   
Last couple weeks I lost about $8k from a series of bad trades. Had to take a week off and reset my mind with very low leverage(0.x) to get my confidence back. Whenever I go on a bad trade I always do that. Just start trading with like 5000 contracts max then slowly increase it. 
I once lost 5000 euro on 2 hours. I was revenge trading four times in a row, doubling my position each time. I don't mind losing money because of wrong reasoned decisions, but my emotional behavior and stupidity was more difficult to accept. Punished myself by doing arbitrage slave-work all day, earned the money back risk-free after 3-4 weeks.

Lost 4btc on a trade on ICX a few weeks ago, made me close all positions and not trade again for 4 days. Came back fresh and slowly made it back.
You were here the other day saying you were about to make your first trade, and you had just set up accounts.  Did all this happen in the last 3 days?
Max lost was 4.5k on revenge trading. Valuable lesson that made me more disciplined and money after
20BTC (18 months ago, so nowhere as costly as it would be today, but still a major hit) one of my first margin trades, just watched it bleed down for weeks expecting it to bounce, it never did.

Lesson learnt
Your response to losing a bunch of money on a total gamble was to double down and gamble more? Might want to take a break.
I lost my whole Ltc holdings trading okc futures in the move in summer 2015, doubled my position at 20x leverage each tie and was up several 100% only  to get totally liquidated 
Presume you didn't let it all ride. Otherwise you would be at 43k from a $1 stake. Still nice bit of luck for you 
Crypto is absolutely game of traders.  It turned me into a day trader in 2017 and I had no intentions of being one.  It is a game.  Almost no one uses any of this shit, they just trade it.
Told you to grab the bounce ;-)

I'm still short from 7.2, didn't add here in case it'll go more up. Those random pumps may end up really high, I'm still afraid we can test 8 before dropping below 6.
That was just a small taste of what's coming.
There is no way to safely trade for quick 25% profits. Anyone who tells you otherwise is an idiot. Working with 30 minute price fluctuations on 25x leverage is not trading, it's gambling. 

If you want to do high leverage trading 'safely', you need to wait for perfect entries and build up positions. There were plenty of times to enter reasonably safe trades both long and short in the past few weeks, right now is not that time. 
Up 400% this from wednesday to sunday, long 6.7k ish , short 7.1k ish. Leverage 5x, inscrease to 25x when the moves intesifies, compounding everytime.

I don't recommend any one doing it now, this shit can pop either way. You will most likely get liquidated with a margin above 3x both long or short.
>The main risk is getting bad luck with your timing and placing an order right before i big spike/dip in the opposite direction. Are there ways to minimise the risk of this or minimise the losses that come from it e.g. stoplosses.??


Add more margin to cover below/above major price levels. So add margin enough to survive down to 6200 maybe
Thanks, I layered a few more sells on the way up as well just in case.
>  its pretty obvious right about now, that the mm are the only ones buying btc.

This is a narrative that is very popular right now, except I'm pretty sure it's wrong. Anecdotally, I've had a lot of people talk to me about crypto during the big bull run but none of them were interested in actually buying cus they felt like they're "late to the party" (even back at $2-$3k). Since March or so, quite a few of them have started dipping their toes into cryptos. 

I don't believe for a second that people are totally scared off cryptos by the big crash or anything of the sort, if anything I think more people than ever believe those prices that have happened once will happen again in future, and are gonna be scared of missing the train again. 
Curious.. What does this "mm" stand for? mucho money? mega marginers? Slim Shady? 

If you look at the price movements between pumps and dumps, the returns keep decreasing. Speculators/MM/whales will stop their very profitable enterprise when the juice isn't worth the risk or squeeze anymore. That is when the party is over. As long as BTC still makes multi-percentage swings, party will keep on going. Too much money to be made.
> the mm are the only ones buying btc.
> 
> they buy at a lower rate and sell at a higher rate

sell higher to who?
>so just wondering, its pretty obvious right about now, that the mm/scalpers/whales are the only ones buying btc.

Yep, LocalBitcoins and Coinbase broker services are reporting 0 trades. No retail investors are buying. 
Meanwhile, ethereum continues killing itself with the newest shit, pyramide scheme contract sites.
Guppies are no longer biting what the whales are baiting them with. They got burnt too many times. That price action seems to be winding down. 
Do the Bartman.

4hr bear flagging action
Thinking the same and since our last high was 7.5 we should peak at 7.1-7.3 this time around. 
Why are there so many fractals on bitcoin charts? Is it because of all the bots?

yeah made the same comment earlier, but i dont think the second bounce is coming tho. look at the current level, its almost as low as the first deepest dip was 2-3 days ago - thats a big difference compared to the March one. even less hopium these days, the price is ready to drop and harder to lift up by the bullwhale. 
[removed]
anyone who thinks this will go up to 10k, 20k or 50k again at some point should buy now, thats the definition of smart money.
Maybe not mom and pop, but how can you say for certain that Wall Street or funds aren't buying BTC? They buy OTC where spot prices aren't affected.
I dont get why shorting here is silly. Even if you did great trades and made lot of coins, any drop below 6k means you lose more than 10% value. So at leads hedge..?

Maybe people got used to 1k$ swings and believes it can shot up to 10k any day now
If nobody is buying...  then it follows that shorting here is not silly
Thanks I needed a good hopium shot.
People are just greedy as fuck, 2 weeks ago we were at 9k and people we aiming at a 6k bottom and ready to buy in. 

Now we are a 6k and you gradually see target go from 6k, to 5k, to even 1k.

BTC has a "hold my beer" style of trading. 

This is an intense trading environment and I seriously dont have a clue of where this is heading. 

Life is less stressful in fiat mode. Slow DCA is your best option in a bear market or hangover bull market, call it what you want.
I agree with the statement that FOMO may play a role in the future. I wouldn't call this a low right now though, it's a bit early. Hopefully it is though I would say.
This is no surprise really.  I have no problem with shorting or manipulation as it works both ways, but people have been getting burned since January.  I'll sit this one out like everyone else.
I have seen so many predictions during the past 2 months about going below 3k or back up above 10k. Few people have predicted that we would continue to trade in the band between 6k to 9k. The audacity of people who are consistently wrong to keep making predictions is incredible. 
See. I feel the opposite. Bears just can’t seem to get the price lower than this. This looks like a good sign to me. 
if you ever think bears are out of btc to sell just look at sell walls. those are all btc waiting to be sold 
> eventually the bears would run out of BTC to sell.

Not with margin and futures.
https://fork.lol/blocks/cdd
> coins getting moved into long to medium term holdings?

Fairly subjective to get exact numbers on that kinda thing, a metric you might be interested in is "Days Destroyed".

> Bitcoin days destroyed for any given transaction is calculated by taking the number of Bitcoins in a transaction and multiplying it by the number of days it has been since those coins were last spent.

https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoin_Days_Destroyed

hmm apparently blockchain.info has removed the chart, not sure where else has a good one.

> eventually the bears would run out of BTC to sell.

The other thing to watch here is the funding rates and amounts of longs/shorts. At some point borrowing BTC for shorts becomes too expensive and longs become the cheap option.
Put it this way: Big bears will run out of rare and precious BTC long before big bulls will run out of abundant and ever depreciating fiat.

It's really super-basic math, and I'm surprised these guys were so silly as to think they could kill Bitcoin by throwing a few billion at selling it at a loss for a few months.  If they borrowed what they were selling (and I strongly suspect they borrowed a large portion of it) they will need to pay it back.  When that happens, Bitcoin will see its most impressive rally yet.
China won't let the Yuan devalue to a point where capital flight is necessary. They have any number of secret measures to prop up the value; it is more controlled than you think
Interesting - I think China letting the yuan devalue is probably more dependent on internal progress in rebalancing away from investment-led growth to consumption-driven growth. If they're successful in rebalancing, I don't think they'll let the yuan devalue much...
whale who decided to rekt some shorts
Honestly, im not joining these pumps for the gains but im doing it to rek as many shorts as possible, before we crash into oblivion hehe 
No complaints 
I have a couple of questions for you if you'll indulge me. My goal here is to try and understand the mentality of those who are new to shorting. If you don't want to answer, I understand, but if you have the time, I'm curious. When did you first get into bitcoin? Why are you shorting bitcoin? How did you hear about shorting bitcoin? Do you know others in your personal life who are shorting bitcoin? What are your expectations for the price? I have so many more questions but will hold off for now.

Edit: Just to be clear, I didn't mean to give the impression that I think shorting is necessarily bad for bitcoin.
when in doubt, just take profit. Then do the math.

*using testnet
50% profit
You should have made 50% ROE. So if you're 5x 1000 contracts, your contribution is 200 contracts and your borrowed amount is 800 contracts. The 10% move earns you 10% on the position. You should have earned 100 contracts on your 200 contract principle. Of course fees, margin math, and using BTC as collateral skew it a little in practicality. 
100 units. You earn 10% on the full value (1000) 
Other way of looking at it is 50% of the margin used, in your case its 50% on 200 units
Your profit would be 50% aka 500 contracts, i think
There was actually some guy stating some theory like this on TradingView back in January when we were still at 14k or so. Went something like his whale friend who was in a group with a lot of miners and influentials were going to short BTC below 3k (seemed completely unlikely back then) to cast doubt into the market and load up on BTC themselves.

I found it, and still find it, highly unlikely, but 3k doesn’t seem that ridiculous anymore, haha.

 
Not bad :D
Death roll imminent 
it pumped right when BitMex funding came through... Now funding is negative, so shorts pay longs.

Looks like Maximum Pain to me
Bitfinex since [2012](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=119745.0) and Bitmex since [November 2014](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=869237.0).

edit: I think Bitfinex became much more popular after the first problems with Gox in [2013](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=229438.0) though.

At least 4-5 years 
i literally had the same question but was too lazy... would appreciate if some OG tells us whether shorting was a common practice in 2014/2015
Spoiler: You won't close at 7500 tomorrow. You might get 7200-7300, but you should have been DCAing. 
what?? you know we've been falling down for 3 months right?
Rather than respond with personal attacks, I’m curious as to why you think we’ll get to $7,500 tomorrow. What are you basing that on? 
Quick question:

Are you saying price doesnt matter because the price will go up?
Ooohhh. Halving talk. A little early this time. Didn’t start till later 2014 last halving. Looking forward to all the ‘halving is priced in’ talk. They were good times :)
There's usually a rally in anticipation of the halving. But it's real effect on the price is usually seen almost a year later, I think. The 2012 halving is part of why bitcoin's price could rally to $260 at the beginning of 2013, and why the floor was set at about $60 for that year. The 2016 halving is part of why we rallied to over $9000 in 2017 and the floor was set at about $1000 for that year.

Seriously. Everyone in a tizzy over a $200 pump. Just looks like another potential Bart to me.
Interestingly, this is the latest update from that user:

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/3RjQGYZp-No-resistance-till-15000-when-3500-will-break-up/

Same same... but different.
The person who made that chart has long since stated it has been invalidated. 
No it’s not, look again. 
To get back to ATH we need a pump at least..... 3 times this size!
yea, seems like the mm are lookin forl iquidity before the next leg down.

where else, otehr than over legd shorts 
6k is the new 8k. 
I'm waiting for sub-6k. I still think it's going to happen relatively soon, support can vanish very quickly.

For me it's just a question of whether or not we will bounce/reverse when we get there. TBH, I'm struggling to see why we would reverse the downtrend any time soon.
Can't tell if you're joking but the last 2 bounces off 6600 were rejected at 6900. The second bounce also had more volume but failed to reach the high of the first so I wouldn't count on it.
Every time I closed my short on 3rd attempt on support it broke down.

It may break down here.
Do you want to get liquidated? because thats how you get liquidated
Good luck, probability is not so high in my opinion.
25x with this variance, good luck.

If shitcoins weren't that expensive still, I would blindely get a 2x to 3x long on  BTC. But with that much bad actors, they can still dump here and be profitable.

Will glably get fully back in btc once ETH and any other shitty alternative goes to 0.
as long as ppl are there to fomo in 7100 range, 

it will happily go there. 

just a game of cat and mouse right now, liquidate the longs, liquidate the shorts, profit. 
Why should it MASSIVELYDUMPZ all the time ?
Probably some whale wants to dump his stash he forgot to sell earlier in the year. A lot of people haven't claimed BCD. 
Pumping because Coinbase announced you can WITHDRAW their value from Coinbase? ??
Aren't you excited that coinbase wants to make more money? My mind is literally blown.
Coinbase investing millions into crypto companies is not interesting? 
Maaan i was laughing, but the people here are super sensitive
Nah this is much more of an Alf-Alfa
Looks more like a Marge.
Bart got a Mohawk haircut
As accurate as every other analysis out there...
Thanks for posting this, eye opening post. Will revamp my strategy, will take a few weeks. Till then, cheerio!
BTC: the reclaiming of the position
It’s thorough. Some deep insights. Perhaps the Pros can make use of it. Certainly a whale from their confident analysis; might move into fiat until they do their thing. 
My life is a lie. 
Or some Xanax, bulls will see life in a more joyful way
I zoomed out to 2014 and it isn't helping at all.
When in doubt if you think this guy should be banned from this sub, look at his post-history.

Be a bear, be a bull, just don't be a douchebag.
You're looking at a single exchange, not the bitcoin market. A composite of 8 exchanges shows a very different volume story. Fair thought, but be careful with use robust data.

Edit : does Wyckoff's principles take into account that nobody is buying the corn?
I have your luck too.
Is it not risky to short here though when for awhile now we have had $200 or so candles up and down, and we just had a big red dildo down
That can’t be bitcoin because the price is going up.
Dude can't take a joke for his life. Every joke just goes right over his head or he completely ignores it lol 
I had enough of him to be honest. Really enough of his crap. 
Edit: I can't mention how many times he has been wrong its astonishing. Nobody can predict where BTC is going 
especially him and his nonsense. 
>After the ICO initial corn offering

Dying
He’s talking about corn 
lol, this sub turned completly bearish or how can anybody explain that fake news is upvoted so fast? Peter is talking about "July Corn" and not Bitcoin.

His last post about Bitcoin is this one:  [https://twitter.com/PeterLBrandt/status/981124346289774593](https://twitter.com/PeterLBrandt/status/981124346289774593)

He just noticed with that post that the BTC chart is drawing a nice falling wedge, which normally folds out as a bullish reversal on such a big time scale.
The guy trolls for hits. Self-promotion is all this is.
any attempt to bounce is being seen as a relief for underwater longs to close and/or the masses FOMO shorting it at a better entry
[deleted]
Short USD?
MJ sector? I have no idea
No BCH today?

Enjoying watching that piece of shit suffer and would get pleasure out of shorting it if I can find the right moment, but am not familiar enough with its movements.
Pshh we've seen this mutiple times this week. Looks like a bear flag that's going to break down as soon as the 24 hour volume on bitfinex falls below 40k. 
If so, this is good for ALTs. We might see major accumulation in that regard as well. A stable BTC price channel is very good for giving ALTs time to mature and catch up. 
What you're basing this feeling on? Whatever shit you ate today? 
Didn't you know for all the bag holders sideways periods are always accumulation zones before they pump to the moon 
I short term trade based on wyckoffs method. It has helped me in Equities and it has in this market. Been analyzing smart money action the past two months - picture adds up to mid-latter half of phase B
Based on the 4h and 1h bear flags we're painting I think today could be 6k day and then a mild bounce/chop instead of a big spike that most are expecting. JMO
I would advice to start with leveraged trading on kraken first (1-5x). BitMeX is a pretty aggressive place, everything moves faster and harder. There are also many more 'experienced traders' (and/or gamblers) on bitmex, which makes things a bit more intimidating. You might try out first testnet.bitmex.com, though. good luck (p.s. you don't need high leverage to make good profits, 3x or 5x is more than enough).
Just stick to 2x or 3x the first weeks. 
This should work:

Whole lot of nothing. 
VC program for small businesses.
Rebuff of any alt-coins until further regulation is in place.
There never was any panic, at least on the part of us who understand the tech. Still here.
Im here :)
Yeah the panic is done because we only dropped 10% in the past 24hrs and bounced 2%.  

If we had bounced only 1.5% then I'd be worried but i guess you can go ahead and call on the bull run once more. 
Since last night?
hahaha.. Where do we go now? to the bears or to the bulls?
>The amount of bear post vs bulls is a telling sign.

Has been said since 11.7k
Don't forget that it was the "top" for months and months and months during the rise until it became the final top.
> various crypto's 

RIP money
That's really wonky and small hs.
I hope no-one follows you with high leverage, in the last month you had a tendencies to short the "local bottom" and long the local top.
100BTC market buy on bitfinex would probably push the price $100 upwards. 


But you said 5k within a week? (a week ago..)  :)
anythin above 7k, am shorting.

i closed my hsort on the june futs just now.

fun shorting the futs, but a bit risky too.
"eerily"
Yeah, it looks very similar. Not sure if there will be another run to 7.3k tho.
I agree with you there and I may even get in sooner than that, maybe 7.1.
i dont think we've seen any attempt from the bulls since the 6k->11,7k run. Everything else was shorts taking profits and finding good entries to re-short.
That’s ridiculous... We bounced hard as hell off of 3k in September

Why in gods name would we go that low again
!remindme may 1st u/myusernameiforgot says 3k 
I feel some recovery is in order around april 15..moreso by may . i hope not to go as low as 3k or 1k though I see some still long term bullish scenarios turning out that way with recovery late aug early sept. Latest October.
7.5K is right. let's see when it is getting close there!!

It happens all the time, usually smaller formations will act faster and when broke revert to the bigger formation
Goddamn right. I'd rather hold to fucking 0 than sell now.
so what do you do with your bitcoin?
i think you gotta wait until the next halving.  At the very least theres no good reason for it not to be at least 25k by then.  
You are 10 mins too late, but feel free, go all in.

Oh look, he  traveled back in time and put a long in. Why bother with the Corn when you can just play the lottery?
lol 
All things considered, it is holding up pretty good.
I think you might be holding your phone upside down, man.
I'm looking for excuses to be bullish, but all I see is bear flag after bear flag and volume dropping off.Maybe I just need to zoom out. What time frame are you looking at?
> Really hard to be a bear at this point

It's incredibly easy
Aside from TA there are literally no reasons to be a bull right now based on volume and sentiment, which to me are still the two most important driving factors for sustained btc price growth. They will return with either great market news (doubtful) and or price dropping so low people begin to Fomo. Until then I don’t believe in any of these little pumps. We all know how these have ended as of late. If all we can hope for is a short squeeze for a pump we re in trouble. 

I’m just throwing this out there but just like last time I think Japan is going to lead us out of this bear market. The FSA is getting really strict with its regulations but at the same time the market and adoption is growing rapidly. 14% of young male professionals invest in crypto which is probably at least double the global average. Yahoo Japan is opening up an exchange next year which should be huge. Yahoo Japan is a huge entity in Japan with a great ecosystem and not to be confused with the Yahoo we know here in the west which is complete garbage. To give an example, EBay underestimated the Yahoo Japans auction site “Yahuoku” and by the time they got to Japan they couldn’t gain any market share and gave up. This was in the early 2000s. 

I think Japans regulations and the organic growth in the crypto market are going to be the blueprint for how G20 countries handle this emerging market. Might not be the Nakamotos vision but I think regulation and government support is what the crypto market needs to grow its market cap especially if they want institutions, ETF, etc. 


Denial?
the consensus is we're in chop-city, population BTC.
Do you mean bulltrap?
I think it was. I mentioned on yesterday's thread (to a few downvotes) that I think we're completing a [bullish bat pattern.](http://www.autochartpatterns.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/BullishBatNinja.png) I truly believe that if we can hold above $6400 for a while, we can enter a recovery market back to $20k.
The first night we sell, sure that we'll wake up to the usual dip, it won't happen :P
Ya think? In a bear market?
What news?
[removed]
are you using trade.kraken.com at least?  The interface is so much better than the regular site.
If you have 10k you should certainly go for bitfinex.
bitfinex is by far the best and most responsive site. Bitmex struggles during high load, but is otherwise great
I suggest bitfinex, they have a large no. of coins to cater your tradings and with the inclusions of segwit with them lesser transactions fees for bitcoin tradings. As far as the fund is concern, They actually use 5% in the hot wallet at 95% is stored in a cold wallet which is secure against any intervention on the net. It can only be accessed manually by their management 
Both seem OK, but I prefer Bitmex for day trading. The interface seems cleaner to me, plus I like the fact that they credit BTC after 1 confirmation. Useful if you need to hedge a position in a hurry.

If you are familiar with trading I'd suggest Bitfinex since their charts and tools might come in handy if you know how to utilise them.
Imo after I've traded on both of those sites I can say that the best if those two is bitfinex hands down. Easier to use platform, useful TA tools, etc.
While MEX is rocking a $30 premium on swaps and a $100 discount on futs. Weird.
Working here
up for me
Probably nothing special but damn some people are really stupid to fall for these shilled pump & dumps here on reddit
Going on the history of 'huge' announcements from crypto companies it's a new colour scheme for the privacy policy section of their website.
Which timezone is that?
I thought yesterday's pump to 6.9 was that pump. Even closed a short because of it.

Beartrapped. Shame on me.

No Volume.
Easy to manipulate price .. with 50 or a bit more coins, price can go down or up 100$ - 200$
matter of time and it will change. 


A lot of IFs...
People said that here too: https://www.tradingview.com/x/j7f7tnar/

48 hours of ping-ponging a range does not mean the bottom is in.

edit to add: "if it holds, we found the bottom" --duh. 
That's terrible advice.  You're a bad friend. 
Even thought I might be feeling the same way, it's not going to start climbing anytime soon. Lot's of sideways action for 6+ months. That's my theory.
I couldn't agree with you more.
Horrible friend you are. Nobody should be buying BTC right now unless we decisively break past 10k or we stay within a relatively tight range (+/-5%) for at least a few weeks. 

We're at 6.7 for 48hrs and youre calling the bottom. Seriously?
Interest from those who missed the first run is growing. I've had an increase in friends who missed, asking as well. 
Bad advice from a bad friend 

Edit: Don't tell me, down voted for a low effort comment? That's funny because u/CrapCloud below me put about the same amount of effort into his comment and got upvoted.

Lmao bullish bias
maybe we can get this myth finally out of the way

> Does negative news influence your BTC trading?

https://www.strawpoll.me/15439084
Have you heard of a quadruple bottom?

Me neither.
I like the 6666
err... 6800
I wouldn't say massive, but there are peaks every 2 hours visible on the 15 min chart.  Higher time frames blend in.
Don't mind it, it's just me selling bottoms and buying tops.

Sad state of affairs when the only hope of price going up is shorts getting squeezed. 

Remember when people traded in fiat for BTC? Yeah its been a while since they did so maybe not.
They are if you zoom in like that
Yes, because *more* people selling means the price goes....up.
Oh no, really sweating it here! 
Yes, we saw it.
guess what?

You have no clue what you are talking about. Or are you some valuation genius that has beem living on his mothers basement for all these years? Why didn’t you tell us the housing market was propped up on bad loans in 08?

Post a 5x short all-in and we’ll see if there’s hair on that chest of yours.

I’m not saying you’re wrong... I’m saying no one knows what’s gonna happen short term. So what are you doing? I assume you’re shorting. Entry, Leverage, stops
No, we're approaching the despair phase which means a drop lower then a speedy pop back up to where we are now.
What's the value to this? The poster himself said he gave up on this idea 3 days ago.
You're so nice. Hope I can get some hugs too.
There is no substance in that article. 

They cite exactly one "expert" (never heard of him) and he talks about new ETFs. Sure new ETFs can cause media coverage and so on, but we already have ETFs and other "regular finance" instuments available.
Good luck. If you're right the larger portion of my investment will make more money than the fiat I have set aside for the plunge to sub-5k that I think is coming. Hope I'm wrong.
I think you're from the same trust fund frat as /u/Crypto_Chad69
I'm laddered in the opposite direction (starting from $6670) so hoping that's the case lol.

Edit:
x15 leverage too so this will either end very nicely for me or be a horrendous lesson in poor gambling skills :)
Its probably something like 

top 10% of traders > hodlers > remaining 90% of traders
Depends at what point in time you're talking about. And honestly, the better question if you're asking from October onwards is: "who loses money slower?" 
in average hodlers, since traders pay trading fees.
You dont make money until you sell. Hodlers dont sell.
Here is the super top secret way to make money in any market: during a bull market you hodl and accumulate as much of that asset as possible. During a bear market you sodl and accumulate as much fiat as you can.

Think about all those people who bought early November and only held. Now they are back at breaking even with nothing to show for it.
Oh nooooo, they were such a big player in crypto that's bigger than the China ban we're dooooomed /s.

Gonna be honest here... I don't think we should be congratulating people here for having "strong hands" when they bought in so high. I don't think anyone here envies his position. We should definitely empathize with him and offer our sympathies, but "congratulating" almost seems like a slap in the face when we all know it turned out to be a bad decision. Because in the end, yes Bitcoin is likely to go back up past 16800 at some point in time, however in the mean time this guy not only has his money tied up in Bitcoin indefinitely, but he also inevitably has some degree of stress over his position.

Mr. deader2000, I offer my condolences for your position, and I wish the best for yours and Bitcoin's future. Things may be difficult now, and there are no guarantees of such a rebound, but you definitely deserve one.

EDIT: I know you were being sarcastic but I just get slightly triggered when I see the strong hands meme thrown around
Totally with ya on the 6k resistance, I have it charted:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/V23EoXPO/

Honestly, it comes down to momentum. If we even test it (and yes, I expect a bounce around 6K), violating the green trendline would then seem "verified significant" to me. Maybe a flutter around $6k-$6.4k, but ultimately down to something more established ($5K).

From a risk/reward, it makes sense as an entry. Stop loss on that trade would be around $6600, although it depends on how it looks there.


I'm hoping I don't have to enter that trade, with all honesty. It will be a hedge above all else.
Care to post the log chart? Having trouble lining up what you're referencing.

Is this similar to what you mean?

> even the best traders here are wrong very often

The irony

The best traders probably don't post on reddit
It's much better than any other sub, and if it seems bad here it's mainly because of so many new users still getting used to different rules and a (slightly) higher level of discourse compared to elsewhere.

This daily does seem kind of bad for fundamentals but the rest of the sub here is much more focused on fundamentals.. 

The daily is TA central, rest of sub is fundamental central. Both basically generally reject the idea of the other being a prominent factor in market movements
Not from everything I’ve read so far but you might be right. Can’t expect much more out of reddit I guess
It was timed like that purposefully to not move the market, because nobody likes extreme slippage (unless you're trying to make a splash on purpose).
What? It was a market buy into ask walls, so it was the other way around. Unless you're referring to something else?
Yeah what is up with that? Seems like bots are completely in charge of the price.
Can't deposit, can't dump it :D

really living up to that failure of imagination statement. Driverless cars are here. Micropayments ( LN) are here. Your lack of comprehension of technology is quite stunning. How did you make your way to this sub? 
“You  know the criticisms are just a failure of the imagination," Tyler Winklevoss said.
You do realize that autonomous vehicles already communicate with each other, right? And the US government almost made it a [requirement by 2023](https://www.nhtsa.gov/technology-innovation/vehicle-vehicle-communication)
Guess that answers that question, he's not banned again.
It's not a failure of bitcoin, just a failure of bitcoin governance. Bitcoin micropayments were present and could be today.

It's the result of a political conflict, not a technical problem. 
Shut up with that premined coo centralized piece of shit.
5x. Assuming you're asking regarding the long layering, but both are 5x. Long is also weighted bottom heavy, so CA if all executed would be roughly $5600 with liquidation at $4550. If we get that low, my short will be worth way, way more than the long and I'll probably eat the liquidation. 
That's roughly my target as well, though I'd probably bump that to 6470 or thereabouts and I'm only looking for 30%, which I'd probably look to add on the ensuing 6600 wick. 
The recent rise in particular had astonishing low volume though compared to other candles of a similar height. Not saying it means anything, just weird in its own right.

> Did you know that btc got created because of banks greed in 07 crash?

I have seen this said before but it doesn't make sense.

There is no way that Satoshi had this invention but didn't release it until after 08 and goes "You know what, I don't like the banks now, I finally have a reason to release this"
This would make more sense if, during a recession, bitcoin had more traction in everyday purchases as it would retain much of its buying power - but right now people will withdraw from assets on the whole. It simply isn't well established enough yet IMO
Except that speculative assets like Bitcoin are the polar opposite of a safe haven 
I appreciate the feedback, and you could very well be right. 
Totally fair question. I thought we would have dropped a lot more by now, and my gut is saying buy. Don’t need to catch the bottom 20%, or sell at the top 20%. The middle 60% is just fine. 
I hear you, and it’s entirely possible that this was a mistake. I’m comfortable reinforcing this position here and my gut is telling me buy. Wish there was a more logical explanation, but it’s mostly feel. 
Nope, two years minimum for this trade. 
This is quite possibly the biggest dud of crypto news ever. 

Other than the skateboard 
I'd love to see his research in coming to that number.  Seems a bit far fetched.
That was what the chyron said and focus of the piece but they did not literally say primarily
Thanks, i guess its a sign of maturing market, a good place to put your money when a global recession hits. 


Saw that, the aabtc is open about the shit he pulls, dont even want to think about how the top 3 traders are playing with us.
But this sub told me it's impossible to beat the market, therefore those numbers are fake /s
? it's an ascending triangle 
You will very much know when this bear market is over because we will likely have a significant bounce at the bottom. 50%-100%. Like the bounce from 6000-11700, or from 150 to 300 in 2015. Or like the stock market in 2009 that bounced 15% in a couple days or 35% in 90 days. Or 100% in 1932 in 8 weeks to give an extreme example. 

Bounces or rebounds aren't necessarily short and can go on for days or weeks because everyone knows the bottom is in so nobody is going to sell. That Wyckoff scheme is not how you will find it on any chart. It's a theoretical example that tries to explain the logic behind those movements. I very much doubt there's much accumulation going on. Sure some people are buying incrementally, some hedge funds might be slowly scaling back in.  But the majority is waiting and many long term indicators are pretty fucking bearish if you ask me. There's a lot similarities between now and 2014 in technical market structure and we are very close to a breakdown like in 2014 that really opened the floodgates. I don't think it will get as extreme or prolonged but 4000 is really not that far fetched as many think and the obvious lack of sustained buying pressure while we are at such a low price level says enough. The bears don't have to prove anything right now, it's the bulls who have to proof they are still alive. 

tl:dr This is not the bottom, nobody is buying here let alone dumping all their capital in this sideways shit. 

Edit: On the Wyckoff method. It's generally meant for single stocks (or coins), not for bear markets. A better example of accumulation is the period in october when altcoins looked dead and kept bleeding. That was when smart money was accumulating. Another great example was the Canadian cannabis sector in early 2017. 

Great link, thank you.
Awesome thanks for posting that.

Waiting for a bull market 
to clarify this was not the hyped news but his answers to CNBC's questions
If we don't see at least two big "Kobayashi"-style dumps in the next 24 hours, it means Big Shorty's outta coin and prolly needs to cover more than a few.  Any breaks down will be weak and very very tehm--po--rareeeeee 🎶 Last night's dump was limp-d!(k AF.
Great stuff! I like the spice! I'm terrible with fibs myself, so I always appreciate when someone does it better.

What's interesting is that everyone seems to expect a strong bounce soon, we're just divided on when. The more optimistic think it'll happen around here, others at $6k, $5k, maybe $4.8k. It seems to be a widely-enough held belief that we should expect it to be a self-fulfilling prophesy of sorts, right? Enough cash is on the sidelines that I would imagine buyers will have to finally show the strength that's been conspicuously absent for weeks now at one of these levels.

P.S.: You're a Crypto Chad now too, huh?
Pls tell me how i pump the price of BTC with 1 or 2 BTC. Thanks in advance.
They been doing a pretty good job of letting it dump.
And this gem from J.B. himself- "that is what happens in a bear market; everything goes into the dumpster then they set it on fire." We're just short a lighter at this point
so, his judgement was sound at the time

Didn’t know we have to go that high! 11.7k looks very optimistic for now, doesn’t it 
Thanks!

Just to clarify, by second time do you mean the yesterday drop?

Do we still have a chance to form a bounce from here to very high levels or all of the bullish patterns are broken now?

Sorry for being a noob!
It's possible we can have a rounded bottom for the second one. It's called an Adam and Eve Double Bottom and:


https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2sjia8/adam_and_eve_double_bottom/?st=jfm9prxp&sh=323dd556



It actually marked the reversal at the bottom of the 2014/15 bear market. I'm not saying that it will mark the reversal for this bear market but I am saying that they can work out sometimes.

I was using crypto but a trader I really like showed why he thinks regular inputs are better even for crypto but I'm not an expert on the settings, so many different opinions on it but ya it's regular. 
People that believe we hit a higher low and/or double bottomed at 6k.

I could see why people are longing here, I just disagree with their overall sentiment. 
>Who is selling sub 6500?


/u/SloppySynapses has been all over this but I will point to one relevant comment of his from the other day on this

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/89m6zm/daily_discussion_wednesday_april_04_2018/dwtx3yu/
Looks like it's down.
Cue the dumpening
Who's buying sub 6500?
Denied.
This india news has me worried that it just adds the minimal down pressure needed. On the otherhand if the news is ignored it would be a little bullish sign.
Same here.
i confirm, with strong bias.
Ah okay, that makes sense
Hm but to me the volume just seems proportional to the velocity of the movements, regardless of the direction. I don't remember it being any different in the good old days.
That's why you're the GOAT. Looking forward to you chiming in if things go off the rails.
I want to model it, but I don't have a deep understanding of the issue and I'm looking for methods.
The exact opposite is what would happen.  Sucks for them because all that would do is increase the competitiveness of US manufacturing.

Support line of the bear flag with a bunch of touches over the last 6-8 hours. Visible on most markets but more pronounced on Quarterlies.
only when you sell, use or mine crypto

I don't know, $1k prediction seems to me as the bearish counterpart of "$100k by the end of this year!" but we'll see. Personally I'd never wait until that level to buy.
lol... are you seriously posting this chart to support your argument..? 
Do you think this 'dispair' stage will also coincide with a bigger % of BTC dominance on the total marketcap?

Is this chart Upside down?

Press F for those who FOMO'd into ZRX today
True but it’s not just vendors we re talking about. What about me? My bitcoin I want to use for everyday purchases keeps fluctuating so much in value that I have to stare at charts all day to find the optimal time to spend it. Also as of right now, the US govt wants me to report any gains if the btc I just spent was higher than what I bought it for. 

As I wrote in my last post regulations is what we need for growth. 
If the only reason they are accepting bitcoin is to immediately flush it out for "real" currency, how is that good for Bitcoin?
Matters much for what?
Would you accept BTC as a payment option right now if you were selling products on a tight margin?

Would you spend any BTC on products and services if it's price was doubling every year?

Your dick-ish reply isn't really relevant to what I'm saying at all. You may as well have just commented "supply and demand".


You have a lot to learn about the world.  
Because their money isn't Bitcoin yet.

Put your money where your mouth is and show that 100x short, it's free money, right? Some of you doombears are as silly as 100k BTC in few months moonkids.
I saw a new guy that writes just like him the other day...that probably explains it. Honestly, given his history, a perma-ban on sight wouldn't be too draconian at this point.
what users?
yes, currently waiting on moderator votes.
Shorting 6.4 seems weird, we were there already and that level provides little new information. Shorting when that level is convincingly broken, however, is something I will do (add more to my short, to be precise).
to be honest, i probably wont do shit, safer to do nothing

but... if we break 6.4k, re-test as resistance and dont break above, would it not be a good short entry?

i really doubt anything like this would happen but arent resistance rejections decent short entries? https://www.tradingview.com/x/xxANZ2H1/
for me its 01/04/18 daily swing low. also pretty active level but back in November from there my next stop is 6k swing low from feb
I think (only) 6k for the smaller one, a day or so of chop, and then the bigger one to 5k

Just speculatin' 
haha, true. And considering how much I hodl, I doubt I would've convinced myself to sell when I saw 6.9 come up and I'd be right back to where I bought... or lower if this keeps up
Thanks. Will do.
> buy bottoms and sell bounces

 I suck at that. When I buy a bottom, it ends up not being a bottom. When I sell a bounce, it ends up being only like the first leg of a larger bounce. One of these days, I'm going to get the timing right!

don't under-estimate the power of the masses. same herd behavior propelled btc to 20k.
Ok. So you mean tax payments in USA?

And when is this done? these tax payments?
If this would be relevant. We should be picking up before the date because of anticipation. I hope but doubt that it has any influence. But let's see.
I'm mining Zcash, converting to Bitcoin then to USDT. Considering it's the most profitable thing to mine (overall) for the last 6 months I think a lot of other people are considering doing the same. I'll be keeping the kit, just not mining until things improve. Either via difficulty or prices increasing. The latter I don't think will happen for a while.

because they run loud and hot. he can just buy bitcoin with the money instead and save himself the trouble of mining.
> Why not just keep mining and see it as an investment as the price might go back up in another bullrun

I've considered this, but from my standpoint every penny counts right now. (I'm buying a house) so all the time I was in profit it was worth it. Running at a loss with a view to the future isn't something I can do (right now). If I had spare funds then absolutely I'd take the gamble.

But at the moment, lack of knowing how low we'll go and for how long means I could be spending twice as much as I earn for the next 18 months and even if the market was to turn we could be looking at 3 years before break even.

I'm still trading, buying the dips, selling the bounces and that's working for me with an allowable trading stack. But no more money is going in to replace anything I lose.

Sounds like you could use a risk management strategy to automatically increase your trade size following wins and decrease following losses.  There are many such systems available to maximize performance.  Do a search on Turtle Trading.  It's an automated trend following strategy that you don't have to use, but pay attention to the rules for increasing/decreasing the number of contracts traded.
Did you get confident by making a nice profit on a high leveraged trade previously, then got a little cocky and over leveraged another trade just to have it bite you in the ass? I would have stopped trading 
No, I made a bad trade at the February 6k bottom and wound up buying back in between 9-10k with intentions the entire time we would drop back to those levels. Only if I waited 2 months I wouldnt have lost anything. I didnt have the mental stability to do that 
Ouch. I will forever feel sorry for you. 
Same as the stock market? Or do you think those people invest because they like a certain company
Liquidation above 3x is silly. 10x is the highest I'd go for high risk scalping. Above that is liquidation city. 5x is still plenty safe though.
I've got one more add layered in at 6960. That would be up to 75% of my desired trade. Holding the remaining 25% in case we break $7K, with an add target range of 7120-7360. 
Yeah, human greed trumps everything, no MM will be able to stop that, people just don't want to miss out, again.
 Market makers.

I'm not sure why popular opinion / conspiracy theory blames them for the price movements...they just provide liquidity and profit off of the spread. It's the whales, noobs, and everyone else that move the market and set the trends, at least as far as I know.

Bart's about to barf 
If this has to look like last time we may actually break above 7.5 before going down more.
If you connect 9k to 7k5 and use it as resistance that puts the top around @7200. That should be a nice short entry, but i don't see bulls having so much fire power, only if liquidations help. 7K is doable since we got to 6k9 today
Market makers figured out how to squeeze us shrimp again and again.
the repeated patterns on charts reflect aspects of human herd psychology that play out more or less the same in similar situations

Yes, we have predicted it wrong. Too many losses to the traders right now. I hope this market recovers from this slump
Honestly dude?

Take a look at a chart that isn't 15 min, they have done a pretty good job.
I would see the price not moving up more of a negative indicator than not going down as a positive indicator. 

We've said these kind of things often enough at around 10k, 8k, etc. "The fact that we're not dropping is bullish". 

Seems more like it's just about a matter of time before the buy pressure in an area dries up. Sell pressure really hasnt' let up at all in the last months.

Those are not bears, those are people bailing out of BTC.  New money dries, BTC dies.  Of course the exchanges will continue to prop up the price to some degree, but there will always be FOMO, so they can make money regardless of the price level.
The cost of mining is a constant, perpetual sell pressure. Where's the buy pressure?
That implies that every large sell wall has the intention of offloading in the short term. Some might be using accumulation tactics or just trying to spook the market 
Bingo.

But don't tell this kind of thing in the boards now, they're trying to control the narrative too.

Capital flight in China is also pretty dependent on internal investment products - the worse the housing market / the Chinese stock market does, the more capital flight goes up historically. 
you don't think it would be in China's best interest to allow the Yuan to devalue?
the fact that it is so controlled is exactly what leads me to believe it will be devalued

No complains. I would like to short BTC at 6800s again.
>When did you first get into bitcoin? 

2015 when it was 250$

>Why are you shorting bitcoin? 

to get more bitcoin

>How did you hear about shorting bitcoin? 

here

>Do you know others in your personal life who are shorting bitcoin? 

nope.  They are all hodling.

>What are your expectations for the price?

another drop to 6200-5800 followed by a short term reversal to 8k or 9k.  Then a long slow bleed to new lows, possibily in the 4k range before the next bull run.
I got in interested in bitcoin in June 2017 and obsessed in October. Im shorting it because I think it’s going to deflate further before we find the actual bottom. I always knew about shorting but heard about shorting bitcoin in this sub actually, which I found when I was looking for a more rational alternative to r/bitcoin. Nobody in my personal life is shorting bitcoin, and very few even own it or know what it is. I think the price will go to 100K at some point because this industry provides the perfect conditions for a truly global speculative mania. For now I think the bottom is 5K
Another interesting discussion point is that shorting is *actually* good for bitcoin and price discovery. A quicker downtrend results in healthier price discovery (instead of a 2 year bear market maybe it will only be a 6 month one) and eventually a more liquid asset. There hasn't been a particularly easy avenue to short over the past few years and people have theorized that this is partially why bitcoin has trended upwards so strongly for the past 9 years

People profiting off of shorting means they realize that yes, the price *can* go down and yes, you can make money off it! It's healthy and a great way to strengthen the underlying value of the asset over time because it results in a much more genuine price range
Hodl off* sorry couldn’t help it
Is this profit on my actual investment or on my total stake including margin?
We are being downvoted like hell even though we are right :) 
This is false broski, it would just be a gain of 100 contracts.
Weird thing was that he said, before the dump, btc gold will be pumped as a signal. That's exactly what happened  before the dump lol. 
Thank you for such a comprehensive response, really informative 
>i literally had the same question but was too lazy... would appreciate if some OG tells us whether shorting was a common practice in 2014/2015

Yes, but mostly through OKCoin futures and bitfinex margin. Bitmex had very little liquidity at the time. 
"No need to be greedy"
Yes it always goes up. Research about Bitcoin Halving my person 2 cents is that it will be in the 6 figures.
I'll be the first to say that the halving is *not* priced in :P 
If you ask Reddit, everything is priced in.

It's never priced in.
Less supply with same demand = moon
the daily amount of "new" BTC that gets mined will half at some point in 2020, reducing the daily supply of newly minted BTC by 50%
Woof. Reward for mining a block gets sliced in half. This means it costs twice as much to mine a coin. As such, the value of all coins rise a bunch to compensate. At least, that's how I think it works.
> halving?

Halving = 2 x quarterings

when the price is divided by 2
yes, in one week we know :)
source please?
yes look at body vs wick
Yet we have higher lows
What I'm hearing is that I need to close my short so it can break down again.
Don't ask me why, it's just what's been happening over and over and over again.
they just saw "[feels positive] news about [coin]"
correct...please see 21 inc.
They'll be even more serious when I dump 0.2 btc for Tether.
It may be helping more than you think.
Sorry that I hurt your feelings.  Sometimes the truth does that.  If the comments are such that you cannot interpret them, then just ignore them.
Adding bitmex is a bit iffy, nah? It does muck things up quite a bit. What did Wyckoff say about volume increasing due to casinos letting people gamble with btc? 😋
Adding fake\-volume exchanges is just nonsense. 
6 billion volume in last 24 hours but nobody is buying, yep.
Lmao just look at the comment after yours.
I remember he talked about how he was trading XRP and then said in the same tweet that he "did not trade 8hitcoins", censoring the word "shit"
Its a joke broski
Yes, literally. 

That's the joke.jpg
is that you Peter?

You missed the joke as well 😋

People call bitcoin bitcorn sometimes. That's the joke 
Pretty sure everybody who clicked the link realizes what he's talking about. Even the twitter replies where poking fun about "bit"corn if you cared to look. Sorry if we thought it was funny and upvoted

Edit- Apparently I was wrong. Looking at the comments here some people really are dense enough to click the link and still think he's talking about bitcoin :/
Did you read the tweet? He was referencing corn futures going to $4.
Thx

It will change... soon

So you (and a lot of people) say all the time there MUST be a dump. Why the hell it should dump without any FUD or some due correction ?
This shit is called price discovery and is absolutely necessary. It's not like price needs to go down, pass an arbitrary checkpoint, and come back up. As price bounces around, the market learns about the assets perceived fair value as volume, traders, and positions interact. 

You're totally misunderstanding how prices work, and failing to recognize that price and volume transmit information. 
True version or tether version? 
Not much to comment on today, seems to be settling into a bearish consolidation zone.

Personally, I would be rather cautious about shorting it depending on your time frame. Its been drifting lower on such low volume relative to its major bull runs. When it finally finds support, the bounce will have to be sharp to form a proper reversal.
I honestly think he's right (even though I already thought the same when we were 1K above), I can't add TA in this argument because I don't know how to, I just feel (and I know this sub doesn't want to hear anything related to guts feeling) that nobody wants to dump BTC at 6k because everybody wants to buy around this price : 5.8, 5.9, whatever. 

I know everybody is going to say "no volume" but big moves are finally rarely correlated with big volumes periods, only on spikes. And volume can appear anytime. I do think I don't want to short at 6k or below, and I think that I'm not alone. 

Still, it doesn't mean that smart money won't short below 6k, I just think it would be a dangerous zone to do so.
Yeah this looks like your standard bear flag, so being bitcoin it will probably pump to 7150 then dump below 6400

https://www.tradingview.com/x/qxYs5Bqf/
Nah, this chart:

http://d.stockcharts.com/school/data/media/chart_school/market_analysis/wyckoff3/wyckoffaccumulation.png

As we keep moving lower i just think we are going to start running out of sellers. 

We've retraced all the way back to late November price levels. Most OG holders will be hesitant to sell this low, or they sold already to buy in lower.

I'm waiting to see if $6,000 holds as support. Seemed like strong support last time we tested it. 

Keep in mind there are a lot of people sitting on the sidelines waiting to buy back in. It's going to be harder to keep pushing the price down so why not keep it rangebound while you stop hunt and accumulate?
 


I assume you're talking about all the suckers holding bags full of dollar-denominated assets but no real money?
This, you want to keep your learning to trade tuition as cheap as possible
Nah. This pump happened in couple of minutes. Faster than others.
To the Bar!!!
Liquidity=/=Volume... but you're right
Might have and i'd be wrong if i did but can you link me to that comment?

I had a pretty good call about people regretting not shorting 7k within 3 days and was right almost to the hour. 
i dunno man, way too many shorts opening up in this range.

noobs too, the whales cant let that happen, the dip to 6.6k was basically over levg longs gettin liquidated.

would be strange if we gave up the ghost here,

 i think one mre foray into the 7's is on the menu.
I disagree, when we went from low 8s to 9.8 there was a good amount of hopium running 
Why wouldn't it? Every single Bitcoin bubble in history has retraced to its previous ATH. I fully expect a drop to near (or even briefly below) the $1200 range.
[removed]
Is this the last chance to buy under 7k?
Hodl, obviously
Pay for my coffee in layaway micro-installments on the lightning network. Is this is a trick question?
Don't worry, posters like these *always* miraculously longed the local bottom or shorted the local top. They just can't tell you about it until after the market movement.
[I went long after i posted this my dude :\^)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/89wnoa/daily_discussion_thursday_april_05_2018/dwuj7f4/)
People said that at 15k, 13k, 10k, 9k, 8k, 7.5k....now 6700 is 'holding up pretty good'?

At what point is it no longer holding up well?
Doesn't get any more bullish when you zoom out...
From like 1 minute to 4 hour is what I was looking at
But TA is all I need, why speculate about volume and sentiment when I can read it from a price chart?
population: BTC, LTC, ETC, ETH, BCH, etc

What timeframe and scale? I can't see a pattern resembling this at all, but perhaps I'm just looking over it like an idiot. Can you please chart it for me?
I agree with this... if we can hold above 6k for a week to a month, without any ridiculous bounces to way overbough territory... Just slow and steady holding above 6k with plenty of taunting chances to test support... The more the better

Then we have truly bottomed out IMO...

Personally, I would prefer if we stayed in the 6-7k range for at least 4 weeks and then intiated a reversal... But BtC never does what I want it to do
I don't see how our current formation matches that, can you draw it?

Presumably those who want to see a world currency that knows no borders, you xenophobic ass
Go back to /biz/ ya cunt 
no! thanks for the tip :-)
why 10k? Because of deposit/withdrawal limit, of security, or because of reliable withdrawals?
Although there are some delays on their transactions, I always prefer bitfinex. they have the most accurate date in real time as trading movement is concern. As far some of the problems about withdrawals, I think One factor is the AML and KYC protocol which is being required by law to implement, so if it happens you will have a large amount of withdrawal, expect a longer processing time
Nobody wants to pay that ridiculous fee lmao
That discount is untradable for shorts and risky for longs :-\
Well you weren't far off
EST, so in like 5 mins
if its like 2014 it will be the mother of all dead cat bounces.  6k to 9k within a week.
That sounds like a list of CNBC article headlines.
i'm not touching it until next halving and then a bit more. 
lets see.
lol, so many bears here. yes wait for 10k and buy and see how your investment goes back to 7k, very intelligent trading advice. 
Interest is actually [still dropping](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=bitcoin).  By the time the bull market reversal gets here half the people here will have left and the other half will be saying bitcoin is dead.  Thats when the smart money will start buying.
It might not influence your individual trading but there's no doubt it badly affects the market. People sell because they think others will sell and it just causes a massive cascade.
Exactly this: the notion that news or a Mark Karpeles AMA affects the buying/selling decisions of people/bots/companies around the world, simultaneously and on a daily basis, is one of the biggest and most ridiculous myths around. If anything, it tells me more about the people that actually believe that. It tells me that *their* whimsical trading decisions are affected by news and hype as much as anything. 
lucky number in China!
Don't over leverage that short, buddy.
Holy shit dude. You change stance faster than a politician. 2 days ago you said something about btc sub 1000. Yesterday though, you said a couple of hundred dollars above us was the bottom. Now you go back on it. Which is it going to be? Better focus on you comments against tyrant Erdogan because this is where you're actually being beneficial.
This post evokes fond memories of the buttcoin crowd telling us about how bitcoin was dead after the crash in 2014 and how $200 for a bitcoin was crazy expensive. Sometimes I wonder what they'll think looking today at our cold wallets from us the holders of those years...

Volume? look at how many times we spiked without volume. Volume is def. not a catalyst for me to enter a trade but rather to stay in one or get out. waiting for volume will never get you on Pole position. 
Selling is not shorting.
You still out of position? I took profits last night and added thinking we'd hit 6.4 but my SL got hit at breakeven. Not comfortable shorting from here.
2x short all in from avg cost of about 7020 I believe, don't believe in this mini pump so we'll see where this goes. Stops at 7120 
>I’m not saying you’re wrong... I’m saying no one knows what’s gonna happen short term.

I'm starting to become less and less sure of what's going to happen long-term, nevermind short term.

[deleted]
Oh, you are most definitely wrong. :) If you don't buy tonight, you will regret it for the rest of your life. Big Dumb Shorty is having intensely stressful meetings at this very moment trying to figure out how he can cover without driving the price to a new ATH.  He can't. It's mathematical certainty. If he has two gray cells to rub together, he'll eat his losses and accumulate if he has any trash cash left... and he'll do it soon.  Or maybe he'll make it worse on himself and try to drag it out.  In that case, get ready for your ATM card not to work by late summer, but Bitcoin to still be fully functional.

Bottom line: trade, buy, grovel -- do what you can to get some BTC or you will regret it for the rest of your life.  I don't care. I got mines.  And I got dollars to get more too. :)
Anything over 10x is just insane and even 10x feels insane sometimes lmao 
top 10% of traders > people who vary between hodling crypto in bull runs and switch to holding fiat in bear runs > hodlers > 90% of traders
Math of Normal Distributions says 95th percentile of traders will perform well compared to the mean. While just as many lose everything and more, while most simply churn and get chewed up slowly.
just seems like to me the only way to make some money is to trade. Weather it be once a week or everyday the money is there to be made. While holding mite be less stressful, its takes away from the possible profits you could make when compared to the number of times we often loose value in prices but quickly recover it and plus more only to repeat it several time a day,week, month.  Still new around here so this is just a gut thought. Still looking to find my strategy in all this
>  "who loses money slower?" 

lmao. So true.
If you see crypto as money, you make money \(or lose it\).
My take is actually the opposite. During a bull market, you take profits every so often to buy yourself something nice, and make sure your principal is safe. During a bear market, look for easy opportunities to accumulate more of the asset to sell with crazy profits in the next bull market. 

Like, why would you try to accumulate fiat when BTC is $6k per coin, if your strategy was to accumulate BTC when it was at $15k+ per coin, that makes no sense. 
you picked an awfully specific slice of the HODLer demographic there lol
ewwwwwwwww yea the way my bank account set..... Glad it works for you tho. You should try buying tether since its always in a bull market
I don't understand the downvotes. Just sharing the news here. I respect your contributions on this sub a lot so please accept this posting as relevant as these stories were last year:

https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-06-20/bitcoin-surges-back-above-2700-india-legalizes-cryptocurrency 

http://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-boom-india-digital-gold/
 
Didn't India make up like 10% of all crypto money? 
I generally don't look for patterns in anything smaller than the 6h candles.
My bad...I was looking at my ETH charts.  Maybe constantly keeping them open next to each other is a bad idea

Also false: was below 30 March 29th - April 1st
You're confusing me, it was or it wasn't below 30 in the last month? 
It was sarcasm. (didnt see your edit before posting)

 I hate the strong hands meme. I almost fell for it, i saw my profits melting and all the advice i got is to HODL. The BTC community comes off as cultish and some times it scares me.

Early adopters that are in the green big time, tell the noobs to buy, buy, buy. It can only get up right? Look at our resident permabulls, posting everyday that they buy more, i wonder where their money comes from? 

Look at this sub, it is a trading sub and people are still mocking anyone that sells for profit, or even worse, for a loss because they cant take the stress of being underwater for months. 

I always thought the point of trading is to make money, but the advice is always HODL, because it worked for them. Same people tell you "dont use the past to predict the future" when you post TA and it shows the 5th huge bear flag.

I hope he got my sarcasm, but look at the other comments, telling him to HODL. I am sick of it. It is not good trading advice.
Hear hear

The "hodl" meme is what JUST fucked over a ton of people. In a bull market it makes sense, and in less volatile investments, but it caused SO much myopia in crypto. Sad to me that people still perpetuate it in a bear run.
I approve of this message
pretty cheesy response imo

edit: check his username you rubes
Yep that's the one!

I actually posted the chart to the Daily right after I replied to you (see above) since I figured my text description might not be very clear. I also added a few comments. Let me know what you think about the line, and also the fractal? It's even more clear on your chart, that second dip in late June. That whole thing looks identical to where we are now, with a similar struggle (do we bounce? or break support?).
You can be wrong 90% of the time and still be in profit, risk management is key.

Let your winners run, and cut your losers short.
Been on this sub since 2013.  You'll quickly find out who the veterans are.  Also, sort by top and you'll see posts are either insightful or funny.
Not sure why (or how) you would make a large purchase like that and not want to move the market. Care to explain?

There's no seemingly elegant solution to micropayments yet, is there? LN, from what I understand, seems like a solution that works it's way backwards to be more like a traditional payment system than an upgraded version of bitcoin. 

And of course BCH has its own issues with the block size increase. 

If it weren't technical, there wouldn't be a political conflict, nah? The politics arise from a disagreement on which technical solution to use because neither are elegant enough to silence criticisms.
Just saying it reminded me of it, shut up with the circlejerk shit. BTC isn't as decentralized as you think it is either, hasn't been for a long while.
Bro, do you even read?
it's tiny, even at 20k, from what i see, lots of news, but serious money is reluctant to go in. 
i agree with that, but every 10 year old asset is speculative, even gold itself, before Christ. 
Do you have a reason to believe it will? Any insight/analysis?
Understood, but it seems like you're doing that well with your 66% entry. 20% below your entry is $5360, which is pretty dire, but certainly possible. I would probably have scaled 2 11% adds at 6280 and 5880, and held that last 20% in reserve. If 5800 falls, we'll be in some trouble most likely. If we bounce hard and you get that last 22% in at 7K on the way to a new run, it wouldn't make that much difference. I'm long-term bullish (2+ years), but I would be surprised if we see 10K before 5K. 

edit to add: in 2 years, I do suspect a $6xxx entry average will be envied by most. But the difference between a 6700 average and a 6100 average is 10% more BTC.
you are just doubling down with no reason. keep your bullets.
Yeah, I have no appreciation for numbers like that.  He said total taxable crypto gains in US was around 92 billion.

https://www.thestreet.com/amp/story/14546582/1/cryptocurrencies-tax-payments-boom.html?__twitter_impression=true

There are lots of crypto bulls out there that sound like fools.  But to me, Lee seems like he knows what he’s talking about and he has a good resume.  But who knows, right?  

Edit: 92 billion in taxable gains, not 89 billion.
The market is more mature now than it ever has been, can’t say the same for many of the participants lol 
As liquidity decreases, it will be easier and easier for them to make movies on exchanges. For example, do a 100x leverage short. Then dump or short a bunch on exchanges that cause a big win of the huge leveraged position. 
Well, if you look at the numbers outside of the top 5, they really are not that impressive. I mean, out of everyone trading bitcoin the "top" people on the highest volume exchange won the bitcoin equivalent gains of a million or so bucks.

You can see how fast it tapers off too, so being the top 100 probably is something like a 30 bitcoin improvement. Not that impressive.
So it is. I stand corrected. I was thinking it was a wedge, but the layout is all wrong.

Edit: That being said, why would you cut off the wicks on one side of the triangle, and not both. Not very consistent. 

[here](https://www.tradingview.com/x/IlVQvgmO/) is with wicks. 

[here](https://www.tradingview.com/x/FeIBOUSw/) is with no wicks.
Ascending triangles are generally continuation patterns (for a bullish movement, I'd presume). I'd say it's one big classic bear flag, given the pole formed by the preceding dumps. That said, bear flags break upwards with BTC when you least expect them to, so...
[deleted]
it was my biggest takeaway from the segment though 
.....last night pumped. 
It's less about dumping than the fact that nobody is buying. Just pumps here and there to prop up the price but overall it's just following the downtrend. Look at the order book. 
Bags getting heavy, huh?
> P.S.: You're a Crypto Chad now too, huh?

Lmao, I even deleted my bookmarks bar from the screenshot (had work stuff), but ya picked up on my google account. Took me a second to see it myself. Welp, ya got me. Doxxed myself, ya'll know my name now.
100x leverage with 2 btc
Dumped but not dumped to death yet.

Sounds like a strip club or something.
Of course
Is there a rule of thumb where one of the three flags takes precedence right now?
Save travels.
how do you even do that i just watch the charts all day like an absolute madman
Good luck!

You'll cave and pay for the wifi ;)
I feel you, I have just 20% of stack, was thinking mid 6.5 like you or splitting it with another target at 6.4 see if I can catch a wick. But honestly I would not be surprised to wake up and find we are $200 higher. 
Wow that link is actually really interesting, thanks!
Wow. Not oversold?! I would have thought after dropping from 19k we were quite oversold. 

Anyway I give up on this market.
Ahh so, you’re saying it’s not overbought?
Either that or they’ve listed Verge. 
ripple bribing US exchanges to list them.
Pretty sure you'll get it. 
LN came out and we moved about 3% up and down. Idk why anyone expects a random coinbase announcement to do anything 
Don't be sorry, you're doing the right thing by learning and asking questions while staying humble and friendly! Keep it up! It's the noobs that come in here with ironclad predictions, an arrogant/combative attitude, etc. that should be sorry.
Also I'm not OP but they have a good point, a good double bottom bounce should have probably happened when we went up to $7.5k recently (if we kept going); the fact that we're back down here is not particularly promising, and if we turn around and retest $6.5k yet again, there's a good chance it won't hold this time and we could quickly fall through the $6ks and beyond as panic sets in.

Personally, I'm still short-term bullish until that happens, but that's at odds with most of the posters in this sub right now.

Also, the part about confirmation at $11.6k is technically true if you go by the strict definition of that formation...but in this case, it wouldn't make sense to wait for the price to double to confirm that bullish formation (you'd miss out on a big chunk of the gains). It would be better to ease into a long as you gain confidence in the reversal and as resistance levels are breached on the way up. Just my $0.02 though, don't take investing/trading advice from strangers on the internet!
I am having doubts which settings to use on Ichimoku also. I see that a lot of people are using crypto settings, it reduces noises and it is easier, but there is a reason why TA has standard Ichi settings I guess.
This is a calmer and more measured Dushman that I'm used to and I don't know that I like it
sloppy has been urging extreme caution to anyone shorting below $7,300. check his comment history

also, for what it's worth, I polled the room and asked people who bought at $200 if they would be selling now or if it dropped to $4K, and it became clear very quickly that the answer was no. totally anecdotal though.
I think selling at 6500 is silly, look at all these bounces.

If it goes below 5900, maybe it dumps to oblivion.
Lol the india news is nothing
For a better example of the discrepancy, look at the drops and then chop from the most recent 7.4 to 6.5. Drops had volume, the rises/bounces had zero buying volume.
Clearly
So, dollar deflates, interest rates go up, savings lose value. BTC would probably go up in that scenario, yeah.
I've got my line touching at 6664 on the hourly chart. Gdax hit 6674
Thanks.
Probably but then its going to be a bigger piece of a smaller pie
Ha, I made 0.07 btc, bought at 8500 and got out at 10500.. this is the only reason I keep some minimal btc on binance..
Isn't ZRX an decentralized exchange? Why would they add competition?
How is that relevant? The questio nwas whether bitcoin will still be USED - not whether this use is appropriate or good for bitcoin.
It's price.
[deleted]
No. These people have a lot to learn about fighting for their freedom as opposed to being pushed around like docile sheep. 
I'd buy the shit out of 2k
[deleted]
There are so many I've lost track and now mix a couple of these idiots together into one person.
I'm sorry if that came off condescending, I didn't mean to imply its "easy" or something -- but it's literally the *only* way to make money trading right now. Trying to buy in because some 'resistance' level broke or shorting because the price seems to be 'freefalling' just doesn't work because there's no continuation whatsoever on most of the moves in the recent weeks. 
I feel you, bro. I've experienced that also LOL...
After Chinese New Year
Tue	Apr 17	2018	Tax Day	Observance
https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/us/tax-day
[Tax Season 2017](https://i.imgur.com/n4q5jGm.png) mostly Sideways (there was no Mega Bubble right before)

Thanks for the tip, seems like something I could use.
Yup. Greed and overconfidence is a bad mix. Learned my lesson though 
Ah got it.  Feel ya. 

I hedged at 8k before the 6k drop, and reentered perfectly at break even. I had a stop buy for a small percentage of that near the bottom that missed by like $20.

The fuckup i relate to was when I hedged on the next drop at 9k, and that ended up being the local bottom. Bought back for a nearly 10% loss on the *holding* stack, all of which was in the hands of the exchange during the trade. 

Since then, I have a dedicated trading stack committed to only 5%, and use margin as needed.  The other 95% holding stack stays in cold storage where it belongs. 
That is a game too.  Just more established and accepted.  I think a lot of stocks are overvalued though.  I have some Microsoft and it paid 43 cents a share dividend recently.  That’s a pittance compared to share price.  I won’t day trade stocks but I own some.  Crypto on the other hand did turn me into a day trader.   My point was just that crypto eventually will probably be utility of these tokens and block chains but for now the only real utility is to trade them and try not to be the sucker hodling or eating losses.
5x safe lol, tell that to anyone that shorted at 6.4k lol. Kraken had a wick on ETH to 510$ (5x got liquidated)
I'm currently only 20% in, I could see this doing another spike up, range and comeback down. So I'm unsure about adding more just yet. If we get above 7.2 then I would definitely go heavy.
That makes sense. Didn't think of that one... Well, I mean, whoever is dumping and buying several hundred coins at once, causing the panic and liquidations, I would consider the "mms" myself. So I can get on board with that idea that they are moving the price up and down several percent, several times a day, in their favor...


More volatility less volume shorter time frames. 
Yeah i actually got a sell filled at 6935 today. It's todays high so far, pretty great feeling :)
When you connect 11 to 9 then it's a bit higher
Thanks for the advice, but sorry, I'm not advocating anything. I'm just pointing out the simple error of logic in the OPs argument 
So you mean someone making random predictions would also have the same success as you?  I agree.

They would also only be wrong "every now and then", I mean you have a 50% chance of being correct don't you, the price either goes up...or down.
Yes, all predictions here - even from those who are consistently wildly off - are of equal quality because we can't predict the future! 
and then you're just getting into all sorts of conspiracy theories because I definitely see lots of those walls get sold into 
Yup. And every time somebody pummels it, Bitcoin will laugh at their bloodied, broken knuckles and rise to a new ATH... until even the dumbest of the dumb figure out basic arithmetic. Throwing energy at trying to kill Bitcoin just feeds Bitcoin.  Every bearwhale finds that out the hard way.

Good night, sir.  May you exit your trade with more BTC than you entered it with.
if we follow this logic, how are we feeling about the future prospects of the Chinese stock market and the housing market in light of a potential trade war?
Only up to a certain point, as I said, once devaluation causes issues, they will magically prop it up again
Over margined 10x, 25x etc. It's free money for whales to play on over margined noobs. This whole down trend seems to be just playing against margined longs and shorts.
Plenty - a lot of ~~gamblers~~ traders over leverage late to the movement
thanks for the response. how long have you been shorting? when did your friends who are hodling buy? I assume none of them have sold, do you know if they intend to if we continue down?
thanks for answering. I completely understand what you mean about finding an alternative to r/bitcoin. are you holding bitcoin and then shorting as a hedge or just shorting? 
First, we've had shorting since at least 2013/2014. Granted, fewer people were shorting back then, but then again fewer people were longing and trading in general. It didn't stop us from having a multi-year bear market anyway, in which for at least six months everyone and their grandmother was shorting it down to below $300 for 'guaranteed profits.'

Second, I know I'm weird and in the minority on this, but I think shorting in general is unnatural/nonsensical and shouldn't even be a *thing*. Obviously it exists and there's no going back on it, but on a purely theoretical level, it's silly: you're giving people who should have no say in a market a strong voice. I may be old-school, but I think a market should be limited to people who have an asset and want to sell it vs. people who don't and want to buy it. I think price discovery works just fine in this classical model. People who don't have an asset and think it's overpriced / going lower should only have one option: don't buy it.

Margin trading in general is a bad idea IMO, but at least margin longs have a realistic analogue in the real world: people borrow money all the time to invest (eg. borrowing to buy a machine for your business, or to buy a piece of real estate). Whereas, what's the analogue for shorters? Say I think my neighbor's fancy Mercedes is overpriced. My only recourse is to not buy a Mercedes (and maybe heckle him). I wouldn't go and borrow a few Mercedes in the neighborhood and sell them, so that I can help drive the price down and buy them back cheaper later...that makes no sense.

Sorry for the mini-rant. And I've always thought this way, regardless of the asset of the type of market we're in. Margin trading is silly/reckless, and shorting is completely asinine. And yet here we are....
Just to be clear, I didn't mean to give the impression that I think shorting is necessarily bad for bitcoin. 
initial investment. If you risk 1btc and have a 5BTC position(5x margin) then you gain 0.5 BTC from a 10% move in your favor. 
Actual investment. You went 5x meaning you put $200 on the line. Your position size is $1000, and $100 profit means you made 50% ROE 
Actual investment 
I thought it was Bitcoin Diamond.  Regardless, that shows how much stock you should put into the theory.
Ah yeah that’s true! I forgot about that part. 

Weird, guess it really is time to put on the tin foil hat again 
Would you still have a link to the chart/theory ? A contact of mine said this about btc diamond.
thx
There is no guarantee it will go up again. Please stop with this nonsense 
I mean... it could go down to 1k before then. Then we get a halving and a glorious pump to 2k... good for traders maybe... bad for anyone hodling from now.
Thanks. Here is hoping your prediction comes through. It is really sad that people are selling their coins instead of just HODLing. We all would be rich.
Thank you. The 2020 halving is now officially open for business. Be prepared to see 2 years flash right before your eyes ;)
Only 18 more months of grinding.

Reminds me of high school.
You are correct.
Happens in about 2 years from today, right?
This guys charts... It's really hard to comprehend how they're both so right and so wrong at the same time. I see these and I puck in my mouth a little. It's effectively magic to me.
I closed mine so it'll probably break :-P
Since december, maybe, but that wasn't the case all BTC's life. It will end soon or later. Don't be fatalist, even if you're bearish right now.

I don't think you have anything to contribute to this community (probably /r/buttcoin is a better place for you). Just keep the floor open for people who actually want to discuss the market. 

The sad thing is that many of the quality posters (posting TA or market analysis) are leaving this sub. People like you should not become the new 'standard'. I don't care if somebody is bearish or bullish, as long as a person takes the time and effort to start a proper discussion.

But all of this doesn't matter anyway, as a troll you succeeded in your goal, you provoked some people, you got your response. Try again tomorrow. Enjoy your life, you should feel good about yourself.

Ahh the old no true scotsman
People are only selling, nobody is buying. /s

I think traders prefer to hold their fiat because up to this moment this market is getting boring and the changes in prices are very minimal. Monitoring it for a while at bitfinex, and there is no significant movement on the wall
so volume *isn't* low? 🧐
Lmao yea i never got that.. TBF lots of finance guys like xrp and consider it one of the most promising coins. 
I know bro, its just his face and his god damn charts I seriously had enough of that disgusting bugger.

You've been saying the exact same thing every day for 30 days, maybe it's time to change?

Like, "It will change... eventually"

I know, that's incredibly innovative.
Price discovery 
Yeah I've been afraid to touch the potential bottom. 
if everyone wants to buy here why have we been here for days?

I remember a particularly egregiously wrong user here saying "volume comes after the breakout" at $11.7k. that guy also lost all his btc again shorting low. 

I don't see why people think going sideways down here is bullish. If we sit here for weeks to months then sure, until then this still looks incredibly bearish 
If everyone wanted to buy here BTC would be moving up. People will want to buy at 5k
Resistance Bar!!!
Everyone can be right eventually if they make enough predictions, and you make a lot of predictions.
I only recall from memory. Would have to search.

Though, I've been a bit unfair picking on you. My point really is that lots of people seem to be posting X in a week. Then I see them the following week posting Y in a week. (after X didn't happen)!


*skeleton meme*

selection bias at it’s finest

Before the 2013 bubble, what was the ATH of the previous bubble? I would argue it was 250+ in April 2013...

The last bear market bottomed out at 160, which was the middle of the bubble during the Cipriotic bailout in April 2013

That would put your bottom somewhere around the 2700 range bro... Because the top of the April “bubble” was 3k... not 1200

Don’t be ridiculous, because you sound ridiculous.

3k is the lowest we go. Maybe even 2600, if we are reeaaallllyyyy lucky


A drop to 1200 would mean the end of bitcoin 
edited my comment
Can you list out a basis for the 1.2k prediction? Maybe a time frame you see this happening in? 
It’s ridiculous to assume there will be no hype cycle... Bitcoin died a million times before
> Chances are a new FOMO/hype will never happen because we are down over $13k

LOL. that's like saying Bitcoin is not volatile anymore
Does it anger you that people sometimes make good trades?
Then put in writing. Now you look like a joke.
Check his comment history. He comes in everyday saying the same thing. Its a joke.
At $6,600.
We're about to put all those points in the rearview mirror again in the other direction. 

After the billions of dollars that were thrown at trying to drive the price down, 6700 is pretty dang strong.
hopefully chop-city is not like the hotel california.
Are we calling that yesterday already? Man, I need some sleep.
I'm willing to be wrong and I'm googling more info and it has to do with Fibonacci levels, he didn't really explain himself in yesterday's post or draw it either.

This is a cleaner example someone posted of that would have completed earlier, which broke up to our recent 7.5--and if this is the one he was talking about, it would have been a great call if it kept going, but it went back down

https://www.tradingview.com/x/4qOtOVZm/

If he's referecing a more recent formation, the two peaks I see aren't really close to double tops, it's 7.2 to 7.5 that I *think* he's talking about?

/u/BlackSpidy any clarity of what you see would be welcomed here
I noticed an M-like formation. And I did some googling on formations to come across the [Bullish Bat Pattern.](https://imgur.com/a/dl7vF) It's steep, but it seems to fit. 
This makes sense to me. 

I consider the "bottom" to be sideways movement for months for an extended period of time. 

I noticed an M-like formation. And I did some googling on formations to come across the [Bullish Bat Pattern.](https://imgur.com/a/dl7vF) It's steep, but it seems to fit.
it’s not “over”, but it is most likely coming to a close before June IMO

Plenty of blockchain hype to go around
Minimal deposit to allow trading.

They had problems with ddos on december hype and created this limit so that it'll be hard to create fake accounts to kill infrastructure.
To be more correct. $10k is in order to get verified on Bitfinex so that way you can use the fiat pairs. You can deposit crypto and trade with it but you can't exchange or withdraw in fiat.
Limit.
Let's pray it isn't. I'm counting on hodling to become a millionaire, my trading skills certainly won't make me rich.
Give me your btc, I could make some good moves for you. Double or even 10x your money. C'mon lets just see.
You think we're getting through the titaniaum ceilings of resistance all above us on the way to 10k just to shit the bed and drop dead again? 

Anyways, no need to worry because we arent going to 10k anytime soon.

Not particularly. I thought that we would bounce up to 7800 before falling back down to the 6000 range. We didn't even make it past 7500, so my guess is that a drop below 6000 is only a matter of time. 

All of this sideways action has only served to reset the RSI, so a sharp move up or down is inevitable at this point. My guess based on trends and a lack of bullish news is that we'll move downward, but anything can happen obviously.

Yeah your indicator is super screwy, 4 hr RSI is 38 right now.
Didn't say it was, but shorting is selling. 

With a promise to buy later. 
To short you have to sell, so selling is not shorting but shorting is selling.
On Bitfinex it might as well be. Keep in mind people FOMOing back in after selling low has, quite literally,  the same effect as a short squeeze. 
I layered in a new short from 6800-6980 in 8 entries, but only 1 executed (at 6800). So I have 1/8th of my desired 40% entry short at 6800. I was trying to be patient and not FOMO in, but this dropped fast, and I'm not comfortable adding here either. 
This is a good plan!

I assume liqui is at 14k? Stop might be better a little higher, but it depends if futures or swaps
long term is always a tough one. I think you just need to believe in either doom or gloom

Welcome to my blocked list.
Yup. No defense here. I was bored and fancied a "seat of your pants" play.
I vote for this one.
Totally agreed. Smart money accumulates near the bottom of bear markets, dumb money accumulates near the top of bull markets.
Because say you sold 1 btc at 20,000 then it goes to 15,000 and you buy some, then it's goes to 10,000 and you buy some, then it goes to 5000 and you buy the rest. That is less BTC accumulated than just waiting for the bottom and buying then.
Your take is the correct take.

I didnt downvote, this has been posted a bunch lately and really not a huge deal IMHO is why the downvotes.

That's too far the other direction, IMO, unless your trades are designed to be longer than a week. You're giving up excellent 1-3 day trades with 1h/4h patterns. 
ETH is massively oversold. When Bitcoin reverses, the ETH bounce is going to be epic.

Most here on this sub are HODLERS and not traders. It's annoying
I couldn't agree with you more. HODL is a poison that justifies FOMO positions. Holding is a respectable strategy when you've found a great entry point, but it also needs to be paired with a willingness to take profits when euphoria strikes.
I always hope the HODL people dont understand where their profits came from, because if they do, it is an asshole move.
eh, I prefer cheesy to insensitive
Well, hypothetically speaking, if you wanted to buy or sell a large amount, you'd want to avoid [slippage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/slippage.asp) as much as possible. This means executing your trade at a period of peak liquidity in the direction of the trade at the time of execution. Otherwise, a two- or three-figure BTC buy/sell could result in you getting very sub-optimal fill price for your order. On an exchange like GDAX, an ill-timed large buy or sell could move the market >$50 for a trade like that, meaning you'd be buying or selling some of that BTC $50+ higher or lower than you'd like to. GDAX is especially finicky these days in this regard, because the MM bots are so quick and aggressive; once a move starts, good luck getting more than one or two BTC filled in that direction within $20 of current price.

Moving the market is unavoidable at times (during peak periods of panic and FOMO when you need your trade executed right this second, price be damned) and desirable at times (for example, if you want to be the hero that breaches and surpasses a key support or resistance level on high volume, and you want the whole market to see it)...but for the most part, minimizing slippage is the name of the game. That's why you see whales taking out each other's walls at key price points (because one wants to sell a lot at that price while the other wants to buy a lot, and both of them want to execute their trades at that price instead of $50-$100 more/less).

I don't know enough about the politics to have an educated opinion, but it seems like there are two parties at play here. One thinks bitcoin should be used as a currency. The other sees it as a store of value, like gold. I wonder if this has affected the development with regard to increasing block size and making more tx possible. LN is a 3rd party as far as I know, so maybe the "currency" party is hoping that LN becomes a solution to make BTC more viable as a currency. 

Personally, I see a future where BTC is the gold standard and once ETH and other shitcoins become defunct, a more fluid coin such as LTC (not necessarily LTC, but something that plays well with bitcoin) will become the defacto currency to Bitcoin's gold. 

Consumers will purchase LTC with their fiat, involving a combined purchase of BTC that is then converted to LTC on the fly, but it all stems from BTC's value. 

/tangent
So... You're saying it's political? 
I don't have any reason to believe we will return to any specific number, including 20K. I'm interested to see what happens on the way to the next halving though.
Great advice and I’ll take that into consideration for next time. 
looking pretty good so far! ;) good advice though, I'm not going to touch the remaining ~25% of fiat unless we drop below $6,000.
Okay, Dad.
Even the 25th place ROI is extremely impressive.

Bitmex was founded in 2014. Even if you bought at the lowest possible price of 2014, 25th place still beats you more than twice.
What they said vs reality. How else would you do it? If I were B Armstrong, I'd wait until a bull market and list those that have upside and liquidity. What if they add something today that does not have demand next year?

Also, Armstrong has no credibility on what he says, IMO. 
Oh yeah, sorry, two nights ago. That was super weak. If they can't pull a Kobayashi in the next 24 hours, sayonara bearwhale of the month.
You might think so, full of Shorty's gold as they are.  But I'm strong as a bull so... no, not at all.  In fact, I look forward to taking a few more of Shorty's bags off his hands if he's strong enough to push it to $6.6K again... but that's looking unlikely.  Hey, a guy can dream.
You should sell that idea to some cryptobro with a 9-figure portfolio living down on PR right now.

Can't wait for this comment.
It's about what time frame you trade on, I mostly swing trade so I look for multi-day patterns to play out so I give more weight to larger patterns. But one doesn't necessarily invalidate the other, this 15m bull flag could break upwards and still keep the shape of the larger bear flags
No but typically higher times frames play out then lower ones
Rule of thumb - the higher the timeframe, the more important the formation.
All I can really do is set profit stops and loss stops or else roll the dice. My liquidation is above 8400, so that *should* be safe, but I'm still hoping for a clearer move off my entry by tomorrow afternoon. 
Haha, I genuinely find flying quite scary for this reason.

But with that said, I would genuinely maintain that you should not do that. I've found that I have far more profitable days when I don't focus on charts too much and try to trade on a longer term basis. 
I don't even want to think about the MEX engine on airplane wifi 
Thing is, we are at a point (I think) where it could go 500 usd up or down, and neither would surprise me. So, we are obviusly gambling like the degenerates we are. That's why you either enter with a very small position, or set tight SL's. Preferably both.

Unless you are really savvy and experienced (and I am neither), you can only ask for small profits that slowly build up your monthly earnings. But we are not going to make a big trade here. It would take too much of a commitment, and I might be a degenerate gambler, but I am not an idiot, and I love my money.

Even if it turns out to be a nothingburger, taking that risk off the table = better r/r
Coinbase embodies n00bs-- means FOMO.

LN was cool for people who actually follow the tech development. 

Plus, 3% up would give me a cleaner short entry haha.
To be clear, I'm expecting nothing to affect BTC--maybe an altcoin (ZRX is pumping hard). But I agree w/ haser below and it just messes with the r/r having this unknown variable/potential short risk. Also while this is very bear flaggy it is still at a solid support level. Unfortunately I don't have a sick entry with as much beautiful cushion as you!
3% pump would fill my short entries beautifully. 
Thank you! ;)
That is very clear now, thanks for your explanation!

It feels like people on this subreddit are much more than just strangers on the internet ;)
The way it was explained to me is you don't catch trends and moves as fast when you double the settings for the crypto settings, it reduces the noise but you want the noise so you can catch moves quicker, the guy showed a lot of examples to show that but I guess test it on your own to see what you like, looking at past moves helps to see the difference. 
>sloppy has been urging extreme caution to anyone shorting below $7,300. check his comment history

has nothing to do with answering the question of "who is selling here"

What about people who bought at 3k? 4k? 5k? 6k?
Selling (I.e. closing a long) is different than shorting imo, and I think it made way more sense than shorting. But I wouldn't advise as strongly against shorting here, it would be a good entry if it does fall through $6k.

The buy pressure is receding and this is our third time below $7k, it's much safer to short here now. Although shorting this chop near the bottom of our range $6600-6700 is kind of silly.
selling at 6500 isnt silly. if you think itll drop to 3k then why not sell at 6.5k and buy at 3k.

Im not saying this would happen but if you THINK it will go lower then it does make sense to sell imo
appreciate your comments bud, I agree on both points
literally 0
Thus asking for help.
You need to read an Econ 101 book.  Literally everything you’re saying is wrong.  Interest rates going up, again, would have the opposite effect on the value of savings.  The relationship between interest rates and inflation is much more complicated but, in a normal market rising interest rates would be used as a way to reduce inflation.  It makes borrowing money more expensive.  So, who knows what the hell will happen to the price of BTC during a financial panic.  The last one gave birth to it so...fingers crossed it’s price acts as a store of wealth like gold.  
to be clear, selling for other crypto is a taxable event, and selling but keeping your USD on an exchange is a taxable event

So true. Precisely how/why Bitcoin was started. 
Nobody uses Bitcoin yet you are in a Bitcoin markets forum posting about Bitcoin? Yeah must be dead 
Well, you're doing exactly what he was, trying to call nonsense figures with no arguments.

Again, just show me your short. Clearly, BTC is done for and it's time for you to make bank off this corn.
Oh no no, you weren't condescending. I was just poking fun at myself for not being able to do what should be easy: Buy low, sell high. I get it right most of the time, I just end up with much smaller trade gains than I could have if my timing was better ;)
Thx
Also whenever you make a trade write it down in an excel spreadsheet or something. this way you can keep track of what went wrong, what you did right, etc. Someone I know who has made a lot of money told me to do this, it helps you get consistent and not make the same mistakes over and over.
If someone went all-in 5x short at 6.4K and rode it to liquidation, then they learned a valuable lesson. This isn't for them.
If someone went 5x at 6.4 they didn't get liquidated on bitmex at least, and they've had ample opportunity to close with a small loss since then 
i was driving when it hit 6900. i put an order expecting another wick to 6900 but never came... next time is market sell... for 20$ i missed a great entry... damn greed
Nice aim bro. Got filled at 6925. Whats your exit point?
Lets break 9k to 7k5 first and then see where that leads :) 
Could go either way - China has a history of loosening restrictions on shadow lending when net exports drop (in 2009 / 2010, when exports dropped dramatically, the country allowed a lot of shadow banking to pop up and lowered the interest rate for housing). 

Generally, the Chinese stock market is more driven by the PBOC's policy on letting retail investors into the market, rather than pure domestic economic growth. Recently they had restricted retail investors from investing because people had been taking out loans to make risky, speculative investments. So overall I just think there are a lot of moving parts and the government has a lot of levers at its disposal to prevent capital flight (which is what you said as well). 
what are you basing that opinion on?
>how long have you been shorting? 

Just recently at 8600.  I also tried a few times during the bull run but always waited too long to sell or rebuy and gave up deciding it wasn't worth it.  But now that I'm going through my first first bear market I'm realizing it works much better in these market conditions.

>when did your friends who are hodling buy? 

one of them at 18k.  others at 7k and 3k/4k.  

>I assume none of them have sold, do you know if they intend to if we continue down?

no.  they have a love/hate relationship with bitcoin since the bubble popped.  But they will hodl forever.  This is why I think its unlikely we'll see prices much lower than 5k.  So many hodlers left over from the last bull run and ever dwindling supply.
I don’t have enough to bother with hedging. I’m just a broke college hr student trying to teach myself to trade with a few K that I made in the altcoin boom. It’s such a steep learning curve though and I’ve spent most of it hating myself for being such a noob
Interesting take and analogy. I agree it feels somewhat unnatural. But the Mercedes analogy is a little problematic because a Mercedes has completely different properties that skew the analogy here (the wear and tear on your friend's specific Mercedes, etc).

I sold bottles of water outside a concert one time to pay for my tickets (dirty hippie). Let's say I didn't buy this with my own money but borrowed money from a friend to buy bottles of water to immediately sell them on the open market. (This analogy is also problematic because I got the water at a store, where it was inconvenient for people to obtain, and made money by selling it for where they were more convenient.) This allowed me to then buy more units of the same water. And my actions, mulitiplied by other water sellers, drove the price of water down.

And if I had tried to sell them but found out that the price had risen above what I paid for them, I would have had to eat it and lost money, like is possible with shorting.

Okay the more I type this out the less my specific analogy makes sense. But it was fun to think about. But borrowing money to immediately sell products that you never intend to use, with the intent to buy more of the same product at a better price because you think they're presently overvalued does naturally exist in markets.

Man things are looking desperate if people talking about halving already
Highly unlikely but halving doesnt mean double in price.
lol seriously I think the best way to extend one's preceived life is to get into crypto. you won't be doing anything else with your time, but it will seem like it is going by much more slowly.
hahaha so true, though I got my ass kicked way less in high school
I know you were around in 2014 under a different alias. You must remember all the halving talk and ‘is the halving priced in’ etc comments. Care to make an early predication ;)
In theory.
Although I don't think it will present itself as a doubling of the price.
Same. This should be fun. 
Well, obviously. But big dumps after each bounce are the trend. Wake me up when we reversed!
While I don't disagree that people are possibly leaving because of a lower level of discussion, part of it is that it's really easy to stick around when the price is rocketing up. 

90% of the "good traders" and quality contributors stop posting in a bear market because they're actually not nearly as knowledgeable as they thought and trading in a bull market is retardedly easy 
Good point. But you could have just given a warning and said to check his post history and put in a quote, rather than publicly calling for a ban and calling him a douchebag. 
Noted and agreed. Remember to use the report button for things we may miss in between having to remove or ban 1 out of every 5 comments.

I certainly agree that a lot of people are holding fiat right now, but saying that 'nobody is buying' is just silly. For every seller there's a buyer and all that.
It's lower than before thus fitting a typical accumulation pattern volume profile but high enough to make anyone with half a brain understand that yes, there are in fact people buying? 

Do you really need this spelled out? Jesus. I'm not even in any position right now but the endless shitty trolling attempts by bears are goddamn obnoxious in their circlejerkiness. 
We all know he's not talking about bitcoin, that's the joke. 
I used to be annoyed by bucky years ago, but honestly he's such a cheery Dutch weirdo permabull that I can't help but like him. He's the only "shitposter" (not to imply he does so intentionally) that I've ever found myself giving a pass on reddit!
You're right, but leave Bucky alone...he's our resident Dutch permabull mascot and the only ray of sunshine in this whole damn doom and gloom sub these days!
it will
Everybody wants to buy right under 6k, because they're all expecting a bounce. By accumulating right above that limit, you've got a bunch of people with fiat but no bitcoins to pump the price back up once interest starts to increase again.
Lmao who? Was it a play device of eastern europe wanderer from South asia origin? 
Yeah, but who wants to sell at 5K ?
Ok link to my prediction in the past 2 weeks bud
Ok ill make the call right now: we will close under 6k within 7 days.
How do you justify splitting the 2017 bubble into two? I see $700 to $19k as one long movement. 

If you look at 2017 as one single bubble, then based on your example, after the last bubble we dropped to $160 despite our previous ATH being $250. That would imply a drop to $768.

> Don’t be ridiculous, because you sound ridiculous.

No offense, but haven't you pretty much longed very drop since 11.7k? I think you've got a little too much hopium. I really don't understand why it's so hard to reconcile a short-term drop with long-term gains. Amazon dropped from $100 to $10 during the dot com bubble, and now it's over $1400 per share. I expect the same of Bitcoin.

Anyway, time will tell. I do agree there's HELLA STRONG support at $3k, I just don't think it'll hold - or at least, I don't think it's a foregone conclusion that it will.
Pretty sure this has been said for about every price in the history of bitcoin.

Moreover, do you realize that bitcoin would run just fine with a thousand people doing the hashes on GCU?

The end of speculation does not equal the end of bitcoin FFS.
That's what they said about Bitcoin at sub-$200. Want a good laugh? Read Mark Hearn's ragequit rant...probably the best "Bitcoin is dead" rant ever.

$1200 won't kill Bitcoin. Neither will $500.
maybe not the end, but it would deff be really bad at this point.

It probably won’t happen. I don’t see it going significantly below 6k
Bitcoin bubbles generally retrace 100%, all the way back to their former ATH. See /u/_chewtoy_ comment yesterday. Previous high (late 2013) was 1100 - 1200 range, depending on your exchange.

Of course, we don't HAVE to follow the usual procedure, but I wouldn't bet against it.

There was a discussion here a couple weeks back about people posting their entries and exits to improve the quality of the sub.

I'm happy for everyone who's in a good trade.

Thank you.
lol... it’s yesterday for me.

Just do what I do: I sleep for 45 minutes to 3 hours at various times throughout the day. Works like a charm... usually get woken up by price alarms, so I switch up the ring tones every couple days
Oh, you have the left corner at 6k on february 6. I saw that and thought "hmmm *MAYBE* he's talking about that one but idk".


Yeah I'm not sure if that will complete, but it would great.



Do you see a broadening descending wedge on the 1h by the way? 
> /u/BlackSpidy any clarity of what you see would be welcomed here

I noticed an M-like formation. And I did some googling on formations to come across the [Bullish Bat Pattern.](https://imgur.com/a/dl7vF) It's steep, but it seems to fit.

I would have produced these charts earlier, But I started drawing the pattern on paint, and just stuck to it because I was already partway through creating the images.
I agree. In my understanding, the bitfinex platform was made for professional traders. That's why they have the $10k initial deposit to get verified and to be able to use all the features of their platform. And nothing bad with that, You can also withdraw it right-away after you deposit. But make sure you're not U.S citizen if you want to withdraw fiat. 
Yea because you are short LOL
The fact that he is getting up voted so much makes me think we are no where close to the bottom. To much hope left
We've all noticed that but thanks for pointing it out.

Yep liqui is there, bitcorn has honestly fucked me over a lot, erasing much of my gains the past year, when does shitcoin season start again?
Everybody wants to make that big trade I don’t blame u at all bro 
Yes, which is why I don't accumulate coins when the price is at $20,000 or $15,000 (during a bull period) but rather wait for clearly established lows that are significantly lower than my selling points from the bull run, and only then consider actually putting back / adding fiat to the party. 

I mean, by your own 'super top secret way of making money' you're not even selling anything until you're in a bear market, how is that any better than even a shitty mistimed buy the dip at $10,000 after selling in high teens. How do you even make any money if you buy during a bull run and sell during a bear?
OK, cool. Thanks!
Thank you!
Yep. I’ve had a BTC/ETH trade going since 
.09ish with about 50% of my trading stack.  Hoping to bring it back home in the .03-.04 range.  
Yes but facts like that are dangerous to hold around the religious fanatics
You're right, sorry. Was also referencing Bitfinex but it was <33 in that period.
This really killed me TBH until I learned to trade decently (and I paid a nice learning fee). I didn't have a plan for my coins just buy and accumulate because it worked like a treat since 2011 but there is some real fear that comes with that insane fomo when you have a large holding. I always tell people if you are following the HODL meme then have take profit targets for a fraction of your stack. If bitcoin goes to where some believe it will be worth a shit ton so your not going to really need loads of BTC, if not then who really knows when one of those peaks will be the last...
loved your response bud, couldn't help myself with your username being *Provolone*_Jones
Thank you for the explanation. Why wouldn’t they just buy otc then? Why risk market buy, even judiciously executed?
Fascinating. Thanks for the explanation!
This is my favorite thing to do on alt coins. Usually a dude trying to put sell pressure on and then he's like fuck there goes half my stack haha. Works well if you want to take a larger position in a low volume alt that's bottoming out.

I didn't say it wasn't. My point was that it's not a political conflict in which one party is clearly wrong, because the technical solution isn't obvious. 

That was it really. Sure, it's definitely political. 

I just wouldn't say it's a failure of bitcoin governance because either way the technical solution is insufficient to appease both parties. 


Seems like you have a plan, and sticking to the plan is the most important piece. Great strategies on paper fall apart if the user deviates from the plan (I'm guilty many times), and often simple, finite decisions are best. My scenario has variables and the potential for quick decisions being necessary. I expect you'll come out fine. Good luck man.
get off my lawn you deadbeat 
What makes you say that? It is all based on notational gains. So, if someone was betting 1000BTC and made 25% that basically puts them in the top 25. They only made 25% over holding.
The moon boys will be out in full force. Ruh Rho 
Ya makes sense. That's what I was kinda thinking.... Ok, if we have a bull flag on the 15 min at a resistance point then even if we get a pop obviously zoomed out we are still in the downtrend bear flag or whatever. I jump into alts a lot if bitcoin pops even a couple hundred so I'm trying to get better at timing it as well as minimizing risk with stops in case I guess wrong. 
I have a decent short open but I don’t want to meddle with it trying to set stops in case I mess it up. Married to the computer for the next while I guess

Hah, funniest part is that mex is *still* the weakest link in the chain by an order of magnitude. Didn't really notice a difference. 
Well said man. Rather be a degenerate than an idiot. 
ostensibly not but who really know. They could have just paid in crypto.
Agreed. I put in an order to reduce my position by 40% and put layered adds back in from 6920-7180. 
Lol so this is your hopium! 

I think even the noobiest of noobs know what LN is, though. Or at least they knew its release would be good news
Thanks :) 
I bought between 5-8k.
I sold 50% of my stack from 8300 to 6880. (Hate myself for not selling rarlier) I am still green. Will buy if we near 6k and further down. Will sell some more above 7300ish if the pump looks weak.
I have no reason to believe that people who bought at 3k-6k are/will be selling here. What data do you have?
yes, but it is not good risk management IMO.

If you really think we go sub 5k, then yes all-in short now, or just sell.

But I would put the probability that we go lower at less than 50%
If we go to 5600, i.e. below 5900

yeah, then we are fucked

below 5500 is basically a technical ko at this point
OK I like that.
'I have been asked, 'Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong questions, will the right answers come out?' I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question.'

You're starting out with an insane hypothesis that has no factual or even logical support and a whole host of confused misconceptions. And your plan is to "model" that gibberish? It's like saying you want to change your pet turtle's catalytic converter, it just makes no sense at all so no, you cannot model it.

Ya I have seen the UI it looks great but why would they add that it makes no sense, they're the most in lock with the government and laws they're not going to add a decentralized exchange coin.   Plus those are all ex-Coinbase guys, I don't see it possible but who knows I guess.

Historical moves of the PBOC and their general opinions on where the currency should be

I am Chinese, also that
my friends are the exact same way. they bought some and just don't care enough to sell, they aren't all of a sudden going to check the price (they barely check it once a week) and say "oh no I need to sell now!". I agree with you on the price for the same reason. thanks for confirming my bias ;)
you're being downvoted by some salty people, but forget about them. also, don't feel bad about being new, *literally everyone* was new at some point. 
What do you think is more likely right now: $5k or $20k? Just curious. 
how is talking about the potential impact of a halving of the daily supply of BTC in two years desperate? not sure I follow, sounds like an extremely important thing to consider in terms of supply

edit: I'm a long term trader, so what is important to me might not be important to all
I did not think it would make a difference.  It did.
I would not bet my house on it.  But it does have an effect.
Indeed!
There was a top level comment today about "what has been your biggest loss" or something along those lines. People posting there mentioned their (quite sizeable) losses, but surprisingly often also said how fast they recovered said losses. Whereupon I found myself with these two thoughts:

- there might be some good traders here

- the good traders dont really care about participating in philosophical discussions (or, writing anything at all), they care about making money and getting information whereever its offered 
> rather than publicly calling for a ban

I have been reporting him for weeks. He gets -15 downvotes on average on his daily post. But nothing is done about it. So what more can I do?

> and calling him a douchebag. 

The 'douchebag' part was not directed to him directly, but more generally, to clarify that I don't have any problems with people being bearish, only with people who on purpose act in a bad way and try to disrupt this subreddit. I probably could have made my point without appealing to such strong language, though, and have set a better example myself.
Didn't mean to set you off or circlejerk, I was asking a legitimate question. The low volume lately has actually caught my eye 
What joke?
Thank You!!!

Upvoting incoherent and baseless shitposting bulls is symbolic of so many problems with Bitcoin. I'd rather live in a world of reality, rather than one where gibberish is posted constantly by a few in a naive attempt to prop bitcoin up. 
Thank you!!. 

This Mascot was in Bitcoin since 600$. 
And don't we have fun here!!. Learn from each other etc.!!! Pro's and Con's 

Great!!!. 
Haha I exactly think of him as a bull mascot :)
if "everyone" truly wants to buy right under $6k it'll never get there. So far so good. until it goes below 
We pumped to 2700 in one day and then dropped to 1750 the next

A few months later 1750 held as support and we pumped all the way to 2900 again

Then we stayed below 3k for a month or two

Then we pumped to 5k and dumped back to 3k

It is HIGHLY unlikely we dump below 5.5k, but it is even less likely we dump even close to 3k

1200 is a fantasy
Also, I have longed every drop since 11.7k, but I keep my stops tight and switch to short quickly... so not really sure what you’re on about
Let me rephrase. The end of the idea of bitcoin getting mass adoption. Something dropping 90% does not come back to dominate the market this late in the game.
Bitcoin is a globally distributed fully replicated PoW based hash-chain
LOL
Wait are you serious
Not really, not enough points of contact IMO
Gotcha thanks for the reply
Tbh, has me thinking, pretty surprising that it hasn't once overcooked since 11.7k
hahaha touché
OTC is great for investing / hodling / long-term trading, but if you're day trading / swing trading / etc. I imagine you want to be on one of the major markets instead (Bitfinex, GDAX, Bitstamp, BitMEX, OKCasino, etc.).

The other perk is that you can get your order completed in seconds, instead of going through the whole OTC process...which is important if the market is moving (or about to make a move) and you want to get in or out quickly.

So it's a time preference thing, I guess.
Thought you blocked me bro? Wtf? Well since you're still here can you tell me why my driveway sensor can talk to my garage opener and my garage opener can talk to my home lighting but somehow cars talking to each other is completely impossible?

(I don't expect a real answer as you are non technical) 
And codecs and email frameworks and prototypes *definitely* underwent radical changes over the years. 

like peace said, 9 years is enough time for significant improvement. I'm not saying bitcoin will never succeed, but I'm saying if there is no solution to micropayments except to move backwards towards legacy payment systems, perhaps that's not meant to be it's purpose? Or perhaps there needs to be a fundamental change in the underlying software infrastructure? 
Not sure why you feel the need to attack me personally. If you think Ethereum serves a purpose, then that's fine. I don't think it will stand the test of time as evidence by its precipitous fall in the past few weeks. It's too centralized to be a store of value. *maybe* it's useful as a platform for other tokens, but that's debatable. Even Vitalik can't seem to decide whether to cap the total circulation. And if that's even something that's able to be changed, I see that as a major red flag. Just my opinion, mind.
I think the technical solution is quite clear - market supply and market demand should meet to make sure there is no loss of economic efficiency.

The question is not technical, but one of political capture of the governance by a single-party politburo pushing development toward certain favored entities. 


thanks bud, good luck to you too
Fuck i missed the obv. Soccermom joke :(
Oh I forgot it's counted in BTC, not USD. So 25th place has 16000% ROI in bitcoin? in USD that's insane.

I'm talking about the second chart, where it shows ROI
....can I short the plane?
You'd be surprised, man. haha

I've got an acquaintance at work that bought BTC because he heard Ripple was a good investment.

Like...he actually thought all crypto (which Ripple isn't even...really) ran on the BTC blockchain. 
Nobody has any data but that's why I linked one of sloppy's posts because his rationale is pretty decent, and it also mirrors mine with ETH.

I bought in 40's on up with ETH but sold in the upper 500's in this most recent bear. The ethtrader moonkids said I was crazy for selling then but A) I wanted and felt like I needed to protect the profits I had made incase this was a multi-year bear run B) by that point it felt a matter of time before I would be able to buy back lower, and I was right.

If I had bought later and been sitting underwater with a sizeable chunk of my assets I would have felt even more pressure

It is always a rational choice to sell if you really think the price is going lower. When you add in fear of losing the big paper gains you just spent the past several months enjoying while envisioning how your life would be different, it's always going to be appealing to hit the eject button. ESPECIALLY once you think the price could be 30-50% lower than what it is now.

Again, echoing sloppy, it's EASY for people who bought at 200 to have strong hands. They still have 30x gains for christ's sake.
if we drop down lower than that, I'm selling my Zenith Chrono for BTC lol
I hear you, but I need a starting place. Where does it first go off the rails? Why?
They also scan your retna through the comp and can tell when you're thinking about selling crypto, thats taxable.
CB announced support of ERC20 tokens (without specifically mentioning the names ofc). ZRX, albeit decentralized, enables trading of ERC20 tokens. My reasoning here lacks solid research, but the argument is that if they take ZRX and integrate the protocol, that could allow an efficient route to list ERC20 tokens. It's a classic business case of Build yourself or acquire.
So you’re salty? Ok got it 
Why are you on a trading sub, then? Trading a speculative asset that makes 30% weekly moves is the definition of reckless.
Was aiming for the low 6.x too. GL
Last run was supposed to take us to 7k8 to test resistance. :)
Lets start with baby steps 
cool, thanks for the input. if I may ask a hypothetical, what scenario *would* cause China to allow the Yuan to be devalued substantially, or do you not think that is possible ever again?
Sloppy, I'm surprised. I know short term you're bearish, but do you honestly think we'll *never* break $20K? If not, care to make a small wager with me? ;)

edit: wording
[deleted]
Come on! Its not even supposed to happen for what at least another year and a half? It's desperate because you would hope there will be other catalysts for price to increase right now but there isn't so now people have resorted to talking about an event probably won't even happen in 2019. 
can you expand on the specific effect it had and why?
Or, this the internet where people like to boast. Take everything with a grain of salt, especially question about profits, stack sizes, anything that can prop up someones ego really. 

I am new here, only a few months, but i try to read every comment in the daily thread. 

I saw straight up lies, faked screenshots, people that are travelling back in time to open positions before a big pump/dump etc. etc.

A few days ago we had the topic of noobs figuring out how to short BTC, one user claimed his 78 y/o uncle mortgaged his farm to short bitcoin because a facebook group called "The bitcoin bearz" told him to do it.

Now, when you ask him for a link he deletes his comments...

The volume is only low compared to December / January madness. There's still FAR more volume than we've seen through most of 2017, and there are far more trades going through local exchanges, OTC desks, Localbitcoins and so on, too. The whole notion of 'nobody is buying teh corn' is absolutely ridiculous. 
Thank You!!!
Hell, I hope you're right. I must say that you sound like those late-January folks who were saying there was no way we'd drop to $8000, since everybody was expecting it.

The market went WAY too high, so there's little reason to believe it won't overcompensate just as much on the downswing. I think it is likely we stabilize around 3k after we hit whatever the actual bottom happens to be.

Put differently: The price before the CME/Cboe news broke was right around 5500. It seems likely to me that the entire pump from 5500 to 20k was FOMO based on that news. So you could just as easily say that 5500 was our last non-hype induced high.
I didn't say you got rekt, just that you happened to be wrong a lot due to your perpetual bullishness in a bear market.
It’s a doomsday scenario, yes... and 1k would be dropping 95%
No, he's L14dy, and I'm Shirley. Are you serious?
I have two points of contact on both the upper and lower lines. I thought that would be enough but if it isn't then alright. I guess I'm trying to find hope.
Once again thanks :)

do you think my username is Hotsoccermom? look again lol
Yes, BTC. The leaderboard for highest ROI is quite impressive. However, it is misleading. You will notice there is not really overlap between the ROI and Notational leaderboards. This indicates that those people are dealing with extremely small amounts of BTC.

So, basically, it is due to 10s of thousands of people going on there with 0.01 BTC and does a 100x long. Most of them have total losses. However, there is that one guy who did it at the bottom so never got liquidated and he held it. It turned into a few BTC for him and now his ROI is astronomical. 
lol it's called life insurance

Yeah but 5xing the recklessnes isn’t a good advice for noobs.
I know, took a small loss on my long there :-P
If for example the Chinese economy suddenly gets worse from an unknown possibility, and the PBOC didn't account for that, they would have to protect domestic industries and devalue it. Such a disruption would hugely derail the transition in the economy. 

Other than extreme circumstances, China only minor devalues and revalues the Yuan for political gain, and in the general trend they want the Yuan to be stronger. Capital flight is becoming an even bigger problem as lots of corrupt officials and their wealth are disappearing. 
My point to him was that $5k is more likely than $20k right now. And if we hit $5k the bearishness and despair will compound and increase upon itself. This will possibly result in yet another prolonged bear market.

But as to whether we will *ever* hit it again? I actually think it's possible it could've been the last bubble. 

The 2013 bubble was riding on promising tech and smart nerds and geeks putting money in an emerging technology. 2017 was a bunch of get rich quick morons who have no idea what they're investing in. 

There's really a cap to how many fools you can manage to invest in something they don't understand. 

I think blockchain will stay in some form but with the fracturing of the community, the interest in alts, and the lack of elegant solutions for bitcoins very prominent issues, I'm not sure bitcoin will be the one leading the charge. 

If it happens I wouldn't mind - free money and I'd still be on the early end of investing in it. 
I guess for some people if that is the only thing they are clinging to, then sure it's desperate.  I understand what you mean.
The impact is had was to limit the growth of supply.  So, as more people buy or mine, they will have to work harder to get that next incremental unit.  This means that you will need to exact a higher marginal price in order to maintain a profit.

Over time, the supply of coins will balance in the market.  The halving several years ago impacted the supply more significantly--just as a percentage of incremental coin coming on the market.  Each iteration impacts the overall market less and less as a percentage of new coins hitting the market.

If demand sucks, this theory doesn't apply.  This works in a market where the extra liquidity is sopped up.
So you think the Wyckoff double bottom theory is incorrect? Genuinely curious because I can't decide whether or not it's low 
I did say there’s no way we’d drop to 8k

Been around since sub 10usd and I guess sometimes the hopium do get to me

I think 5500 is the non-fomo induced high. I would be very surprised if we dropped below.

I would be floored if we hit 3k

But to me it’s still moon... 
it’s ok. Usually my longs turn out ok, and I short at the right moments

I’m up in BTC, so I’m not some stupid HODLer, but yeah... would have been better to keep my short from 11.6k open :/
I mean that's the minimum and it could still play out that way I just don't see it, it's kinda narrow as well
And yet you don't defend or explain why you think it's absurd. I'm waiting.
Ah, so my *wife* is shorting the plane. Good for her.

He was throwing 25x out there. If I can talk him from 25x down to 5x, I'm happy. 
I stayed out and shorted 7250 on the way down. Got lucky and made a nice profit. 
> I actually think it's possible it could've been the last bubble.

So do you think this was the last bubble and we'll never get to $20K again? I think everyone agrees that it's *possible* lol

I'm not an expert on Wyckoff theory and don't trade based off of it, but as far as I can tell, either we're in the very tail end of the accumulation phase, or the 11k doubletop was the 'failed rally' part and we are yet to see another, bigger sell off before real accumulation phase starts which would likely be quite a bit lower than this. I'm not sure I believe in possibility of the second scenario at all, but who knows. If the second scenario was in play, we should see volume taper off much, much lower than this - down to like 1-2billion daily, tops. 

My personal bullshit opinion is that pretty much everything sub 10k was / is a massive accumulation play though, Wyckoff or not. Trading volume has declined significantly since the all time highs, yes, but there were still a lot of buyers at every price level down here and we still have way higher volumes than we've ever seen before the crazy autumn. I don't know if I believe it's all due to retail hopefuls trying to buy the dips, I kind of feel like retail is getting shaken out while bigger / more experienced traders are slowly building their stacks while gently (or gently caressingly) keeping the prices from going too high up. The multi-thousand BTC market sells driving this down every time we seem like we might actually break an important resistance point are silly, especially in combination with multi-thousand BTC buys propping the price ever so gently whenever it looks like the floor is about to fall out. 
That's true it's pretty narrow. I don't expect a instant bull rally to 20k anyways, I think we need to go sideways for a few weeks or maybe even months.
classic husband hedge
speedy? whats a defu
I flipped to short at the same price, just closed at 6.7. not the best exit but took some profits.

Now waiting for a bounce. It's really hard to short now and too risky to long. Trend can reverse any minute :-\ I don't like that ae scenario.
Sure, I know better than to say it's impossible. I know how many people have been proven wrong before. 

But there *will* be a top at some point in time. 

if bitcoin ends up solving its issues and is adopted for actual use then I'll rescind my statement. until then i don't see what else a bubble would ride on. 

Bubbles occur when people perceive an asset to be worth way more than it currently is, the 2017 bubble was possible because early 2017 there was actual good news that encouraged price growth and adoption. That was the hump to get over before the bubble like asset growth took over. Past ~$3-5k and it was pure speculation and greed, you'd have a hard time arguing otherwise with even long term holders on that point. 

The thing is, in order to get to $20k we need actual, good news now. Not just hopes and dreams of being rich. The bubble sustained itself towards the end on futures hype and mania. Both of those have dissipated and we're at $6.7k. What's going to carry us back to $20k? It's surely not "because it happened before"


There's definitely buying going on, but it's calculated. Based on the ATR of longer'ish timeframes (+6h), price action has been relatively nonvolatile. From this, you can assume that the market still has a mixed bag of traders and investors with different investment horizons. The short-term traders will trade the trend (down) and the long-term savvy investors will let them do so to accumulate at lower prices. If the players with longer investment horizons had exited the market, the sell offs would have been on significantly less volume. I guess what I'm trying to get at is bears need bids to sell into, and since we've been having decent volume, I'll take that as bulls being smart about their accumulation tactics and using the trend to their advantage. 

tl;dr - There is buying going on; smart buying.

My problem with the bounces to 6k9 is that after enough tries it actually goes through so i'm afraid of setting limit sells. With work and sleep i miss the times it actually gets there 
All god points.  The only thing I’d add is that if bitcoin solves its problems it’s going to be worth may more than 20k.  

Waiting for the scaling issue to be completely addressed is like saying in 1999, “Amazon isn’t worth buying because it only sells books and cds. “ Now, you may think the scaling issue won’t be solved.  That’s a reasonable position to take.   But saying the price shouldn’t rise before the issues are solved is not something I agree with.  My 2 cents.
All good and I understand what you're saying, but your position is that you don't *think* it will ever get to $20K again, right?

edit: let's say within five years because "ever" isn't fair. Your position is that you don't think BTC will get to $20K in five years, right?
Same here, but it may break either way.
You're using Amazon because it succeeded but there were plenty of companies in 2000 you could've bet on and completely regretted later. 
My position is that I don't see any reason it'd go to $20k right now as opposed to everyone who assumes it's practically inevitable.. You feel me? 


Agreed.  My point isn’t that it will succeed.  My point is that prices will legitimately rise before a business (or a technology) has reached its potential.
