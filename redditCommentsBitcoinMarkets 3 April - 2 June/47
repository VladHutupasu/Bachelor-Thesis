Blog post (appeared yesterday) by IMF Director Christine Lagarde. Worth reading. One more encouraging signal that policy-makers are becoming increasingly supportive and open-minded about crypto, and also appreciate the potential benefits of diversifying the financial landscape.

"An Even-handed Approach to Crypto-Assets"

https://blogs.imf.org/2018/04/16/an-even-handed-approach-to-crypto-assets/

> Just as a few technologies that emerged from the dot-com era have transformed our lives, the crypto-assets that survive could have a significant impact on how we save, invest and pay our bills. That is why policymakers should keep an open mind and work toward ­­an even-handed regulatory framework that minimizes risks while allowing the creative process to bear fruit. 

And this:

> In my view, the fintech revolution will not eliminate the need for trusted intermediaries, such as brokers and bankers. There is hope, however, that decentralized applications spurred by crypto-assets will lead to a diversification of the financial landscape, a better balance between centralized and de-centralized service providers, and a financial ecosystem that is more efficient and potentially more robust in resisting threats.

Welp.  I went broke with my trading stack. -8btc in a matter of a week thanks to being on the wrong end of every single one of these massive random market orders.  This is why you don't trade micro-movements in bitcoin. 

Wow I just want to put this out there: just received €1.84 intrest on my bankaccount which contains 23K €, fuck yeah. 
Venezuela localbitcoins payments now account for 2.5% of all Bitcoin transactions: https://anacoinda.github.io/localbitcoins/VEF.html

Venezuelans turning it up a notch, trend still going parabolic in both tx# and dollar volume (only 700k daily, but up 3.5x from last year)

In my view this is the best evidence of Bitcoin at work - even in a highly oppressive country, it manages to thrive. 
Point and Figure https://i.imgur.com/M88yQHH.png  We have moved into a column of 7 O's.  Our move up on the 15th has cleared the last remaining unretraced long pole of O's, which was from 3/27.  This 'clears us' for new lower lows (<6k).  Doesn't have to happen though, of course, it just means our bullish mean reversion has completed and bear market can now continue.

On 4/13 we had a column of 22 X's. A 50% retrace of this column would put under 7399.  I see this is fairly likely.  Sorry for the bearish post.
So much complaining about this "stop loss hunting". Well it only works until it doesn't and that's the reason markets never can be 100% beaten like a game with fixed rules. The observer trading effect is real and as long as you adapt and have a plan to get out from the unprobable, you will succeed.

But STILL having your fixed 5% stop losses when hunted down 3 times, that is just stupid and stubborn
1000btc market sell on bitfinex started this
Shorts seems to be growing in the retarded style again. 
Dump was almost entirely on leverage (shorts increased by almost 1000 BTC):

Before I go into my analysis, I'd like to caution traders getting too caught up in random sentimental / whale / manipulation ideas and actually making trades off of it. That's not TA. There's no way to quantify it. All you're doing is trying to justify what you want to happen with random thoughts that have very little/specious logical backing; that's asking to get rekt. Every manipulation type argument can be twisted into whatever outcome you want so it's not going to help you predict the market.

That said, my updated chart: https://www.tradingview.com/i/4Ea9Ezj8/

Essentially the same chart as the last one I posted because we've been chopping and it's important to maintain medium-long term perspective. We have some confirmations to go off of now. Three blue lines: ATH Log resistance, Nov-6k Suppport (held so far), Sept-6k Support (broken and confirmed as resistance).

1: Bounced off daily BBand (golden circles). We briefly pierced it, but have now started to fall back. Every time we've done this in the bear we've gone down a significant amount.

2: Daily stoch RSI cross (yellow arrows). Similarly, these crosses in the overbought region have not been good signs for the bulls throughout this bear market.

3: Hidden bear div on the daily (white).

4: Log support-turned-resistance. Again, we just came back and confirmed it as support - turned - resistance. That's bad, and could be a classic throwback pattern where we break a significant level (out of the large triangle this support and ATH resistance forms), go back to test it, and then turn around and REALLY move lower. Doing so would involve the ATH - Nov/6k triangle breaking down.

There isn't much hopium for bulls on the daily chart. However, it's worth mentioning that the first three things I mentioned have been bad signs throughout the bear market. I would wager that one of those will be invalidated / inconsequential if we're really starting to be at the end of the overall bear market. So the hope for the bulls is that even in the face of all these bearish things we move up again very soon and test/cross the ATH resistance. That'd obviously be a very bullish sign imo. I don't think it's likely. We also haven't yet SIGNIFICANTLY fallen off the Sept-6k support we tested. Maybe we'll move back up to test it again.

Other than the unlikely chance we move back up in short order, in gray I've given three possible outcomes I see as fairly likely. As a caveat, they are by no means the only outcomes. In the first, and most bullish, we find support somewhere in the 7k range to consolidate a bit over a longer time frame, giving the daily stoch some time to reset before making a push at the log ATH resistance when it's a bit lower and try to break up out of the triangle formed by ATH resistance and November support (less steep one that has held so far). In the second, we fall back to again test the Nov-6k Support line. If we manage to bounce, it'd likely result in the same situation as the first.  Note that both of these don't require us to reclaim that Sept-6k support line as the log ATH line will cross it this Friday.  

But as everyone has been saying, if we break through the Nov-6k support it's bad news.

As for me, still hanging onto fiat after selling at 8.3k. Will be making sure I enter in profit but I'm not entirely sure where that'll be, going to keep letting things play out for now.
Alts ain't moving at all, this dump seems fishy. Setting some bids @7700 and 7600s tho
We should get a direction confirmed soon on the shorter timeframes, but I'm leaning long based on the wicks on the lower trend line. I'm going to set some bids on the lower trend line expecting one more sell off before breaking up out of the triangle.

It is so strange to see shorts rising when price is falling. It should be opposite. So many bad entrance points in my eyes.
Right on schedule...that's the third time in a week that we've had a pump at *exactly* 0700 UTC. It's not every day, but it seems to be timed for when we're on the verge of breaking a local short-term resistance line.

Seems effective, not necessarily for longer-term price effects but to buy up all ask-side liquidity at once while breaking through local resistance (and probably sell back to everyone else on the way up).
15-min B-bands haven't been this tight since just before the monster spike last week. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/cuDZGPOu/
Putting a little short here and then more on the next bounce I get a decent stab at. Should have trusted the Daily stoch RSI crossover yesterday would be more fruitful. Think we go a lot deeper before a bounce here.
Does anyone actually have a clue what’s going on? I honestly don’t even think bitcoin knows what to do.

Everyone recently has had an extremely bullish sentiment. Even though I am short waiting for the impending dump down to 7500-7900, my inner bull is coming out and thinking we won’t reach those levels. 

We have hit lower lows and higher highs, the 8050 mark on shorter timeframes is holding up extremely well considering out 3 dumps down to there in the last 24 hours. We are sitting in a beautiful channel rising up that could play out well for the Bulls. There is little to no selling pressure besides the typical well that will throw a 1000+ market order sell and cause a decent size BRD every here in there, but besides that every minor dip has been eaten up. 

As for the bears, we have failed to break through the 8450 resistance twice, and as for recently we haven’t been able to break the 8200 mark. Volume is stale, people are waiting for the market to make a serious move. The head and shoulder’s pattern is about 70% formed but it’s too early to make an actual call weather or not it could play out. We are nearly repeating a pattern we saw from the last run up from 7300 where it could play out the same.

I’m fucking perplexed. 
Another day, another over-leveraged trade. I always start out small, then read comments here (not blaming anyone, my fault of course), look at the charts, start to feel FOMO, and increase it either at the last second or DCA at small price differences that don't even matter. What is wrong with me. Liquidation awaits at 7.5 so my I'm holding my butt cheeks together on this one.
We are holding right at the neck line on the head and shoulders. RSI is oversold on the 1H-15 Min. 

Say the Neckline holds and it doesn’t break. 

We could see a bounce correct? 

Edit: it broke 
I'll say the same thing I said when the market suddenly dropped away from $8,400:

Chill out, there's no need to panic yet. 

Watch the support zones at $7,800, $7,500 and $7,300

If $7,300 breaks down, then you can start being a bit concerned.

If $6,800 breaks down, I'd be very surprised if $6,000 didn't follow close behind.
I'm not so sure why everyone is so obsessed with bull flags and bear flags. They seem to be the most unreliable pattern by FAR in crypto. Any time someone mentions a flag it seems to do the opposite. I almost never trade on flags anymore. 
If I chart/graph the amount of coworkers and friends who’ve recently resparked their interest in crypto (after getting shrekt in January) does that count as TA ? I kid you not the folks are requesting 401k loans “while coins are still cheap” 

Mind you some of these folks got destroyed in January, swore they’d never stick their dicks in again. But here we are, they want more. We don’t break bear market until grandma calls for bitcoin purchase help, though. That’s the real signal.
[https://imgur.com/a/YTdKc](https://imgur.com/a/YTdKc)

I don't for a second think that a bull flag would/could form for this length of time, in this direction or size... But it's nice to dream for a bit ain't it? A convincing blow through the ATH downtrend... Ahhh to dream.

Honestly it's a barmy idea, but if I didn't share it I'd be really annoyed if it happened. Been working on making 'prettier' charts so again, just an excuse.
Someone just figured out they have to sell a shitload of bitcoin to cover their taxes!
Biggest rise in shorts since the BGD, just asking to get rekt tbh. Opened a big long from 7870.

And that's why you don't close your short early! Alas.
I’m currently short from 8015, and have been for a couple of days riding underwater.

Considering closing here, but looking at the macro trend makes me think we may go lower first.

What would you do??
I'm trying to create an indicator to determine longs vs. shorts outside of BFX. Can someone help me determine if there is something grossly/inherently wrong with the following formula:

longs = ((high-open)/(high-low))*volume

shorts = ((open-low)/(high-low))*volume

The idea is fairly rudimentary: anything above the open would be considered (+)volume (longs) and vice versa; both canceling each other out if longs and shorts are equal. Critiques graciously welcome.
Interesting 1 min candle the one at 23:21 on finex.
From being in a bear market for so long I still can’t shake the feeling of a dip. I feel like the dropping of volume and google trend statistics make a dip seem highly plausible after such a large run up, but who knows at this point. I am waiting to re enter the market, how does everyone else feel?
Scaling in buys from 7850-7775. 

Expect more consolidation day tomorrow as we set a lower high and higher low. If we can maintain above ~7550 we should start a nice recovery late tomorrow into Thursday (U.S) as we approach the ATH log trend. 
Folks, zoom out. We're in a giant pennant going back to December, and this was either a break or bounce point. Freak if we drop below about 6200. Oh, log, not linear
Tom Lee of Fundstrat just came on Bloomeberg and cited tax season as major reason for weakness in Q1, with the US IRS set to receive a huge windfall this year (relatively massive for cap gains). Points to BTC dominance of crypto and 25k at year end. 
If Exchanges are screwing with you (i.e. not releasing rightfully owned funds), don't be afraid to lawyer the fuck up.

 I've been seeing more and more posts on Exchanges doing this type of shit. It's not legal and they as a regulated financial institution are obligated to be responsible with your funds/deposits. It cuts both ways, don't let them treat you this way.

P.S. thanks for the 1-day "oh no Teeird your words are too tough" timeout. Really good stuff! I didn't know this was a Disney/Pixar style forum. EDIT: ok I jest, I did know this, I'm just being a sarcastic ass. I just change for no one but myself.
This drop so far is a copy of the one on April 13 from 8100 to 7850
https://imgur.com/a/MiROT

So we completed the right shoulder and broke through the channel i had drawn, current at the neckline and it doesn't look like we want to bounce too much.
I fell victim to the 8180 wick overnight. Ironically I had charted an ascending triangle, but figured I'd set my stops high enough as we were under 8K when I went to bed. I'm taking a step back from trading for a couple days, as I've gotten badly chopped up trying to short this thing. I've had a couple good trades, but most of those have gains have been negated by stops--even wide stops. I've taken a 25% hit to my stack since the 6400 bottom, almost all of which came on a stop on the BGC. I have a small long from 6410 on Sept futures open and a slightly larger long from 7920 on June futures, but both only combine up to 10% of my trading stack.

I'll still be charting, but not really looking to open anything new in this area. I will probably short >8300 if we get there, and would definitely short up to the resistance line if we get there, but the market is displaying remarkable resilience to hold over 7900 in the face of some significant red candles. 

You've got to be rational and emotionless when trading to trade effectively, and I'm right on the cusp of revenge trading right now (i.e. YOLO long). Sidelines = HODL trading stack for me, so I'm long by default when out of position, and that's the best place for me right now.

Good luck all.

edit to add: FWIW, I still see an ascending triangle + bart fakeout forming. Could also be considered a bull flag, though it's waving upwards, which is odd. Last time that happened, we dumped hard after (3-18 to 4-1). Shorting 8400-8600 with stops around 9K is still my only confident trade, after zooming out: https://www.tradingview.com/x/iE6Iv8ue/  
https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/ag-schneiderman-launches-inquiry-cryptocurrency-exchanges interesting times


If this thing bounces to 8k+ I expect a lot of people in the 8050-8350 range to be taking profits on their shorts or shorts that opened in 7800 range panic closing. 

Aka we could go higher. 

But being bullish before got my slapped in the dick so I can now forever be bearish 
Every time shorts on finex have hitted a rsi higher than 85 a big green candle of at least 3% followed closely 

I have no fucking clue if its just coincidence or if the rsi is even aplicable to that, but, who knows. 
Short-to-mid term upside scenario is still looking strong. On the 6h the tenkan sen gave brief support and a retest is now under way. Chikou is clear of the kumo and momentum lines nicely separated. The green cloud is quite far ahead but it should rise up once the BGD falls 26 periods behind in a handful of candles time.

6h: https://www.tradingview.com/x/iLbo2x9e

The 12h also looks like it's about to cloud burst to the upside as we move forward. Not sure about how much the chikou will be able to pierce the cloud top, but momentum lines are looking bullish and a wild smidgen of green kumo is appearing.

12: https://www.tradingview.com/x/QW8x9QD7
Remember last year when people said the bubble would pop at 10k down to 5k? The price was like 2200 and we all thought this was crazy...

8k... 8k is holding remarkably wel for now. Sure it might go down, but for now it seems ok
https://imgur.com/a/grIhL  
Potential fractal in play. 
I bought at 7,878. I hope this works out.
I think I'm going to close half of my long here. 

We spent too much time at ~$8K without up further and we are sitting at 20% gains so I think people will start losing their patience here.

I'll sell the rest if this breaks below $7,800 or gets above $10K 
If this is the end of the bear market, then I have to admit that [this](https://www.newsbtc.com/2017/04/17/bitcoin-price-technical-analysis-04172017-reversal-pattern-forming/) feels eerily similar
Morning guys. Resistance is now at ~8700. We are getting closer. Only a 7% push to test it.

chart: https://imgur.com/a/LUmvd

edit: potential W bottom formation: https://imgur.com/a/VmQbQ
I have a feeling this is a bulltrap. If you’re holding a short from before the pump, I would hold it.

when we pumped from sub 7k, we quickly dumped like 100 bucks and then slowly recovered.

I anticipate the same could happen here again. A hedge here is surely not a bad idea

Anyone got a zoomed out log chart? Where is the log resistance at?
[removed]
Decided not to take a position while I sleep for the first time all week. Felt great being able to actually close my eyes. BUT, just woke up to alarms and now thinking about shorting from here.

We broke up from the rising wedge which adds to the handful of times this week since we broke away from the 6k range that a bearish pattern had a bullish outcome. We are in this repeating cycle of “ Does nothing for hours “ follow by a 100-250$ candle in either direction. 

May start stacking small shorts here all the way up to 8400, will most likely bail if 8500 breaks and consider re shorting in that range until 9.2k. Thoughts? 
Monthly futures expire tomorrow? Any thoughts on whether it’ll trigger a run or pull back? 
I am longing futures from 8030. Why ?  First ma cross to the upside in 1 month, someow bull flagging on 1d, the mid term downtrend line at 7200 was broken with a lot of action and held up so far

And also because I am bored.  https://www.tradingview.com/x/g91IQz4k. On the other hand, a lot of alt action on Binance today ! Interesting to see that more USD pairs are coming 

stops below last 3d candle

edit, 1 min later we dump. of course :)  Still have my buy on 7900 on swaps waiting to be fished
Finally, movement!
[removed]
So, if you are long-term bullish, if we can hold 7800 for the next few days, wouldn't that be an indicator that now would be a good time to buy a HODL stack?
Well. Always trust your gut. Was bearish all day and went bullish last minute and opened up a long and got fucking REKT. 

Wipe her clean and start fresh. 
Do you folks have a fixed risk/reward ratio and calculate stop loss from that?

How do you folks factor in the potential risk from stop loss hunting when deciding on a stop loss for your risk reward calculation?

EDIT: more questions
https://www.tradingview.com/chart/2fHwIr1l/

Can someone just give me clarification of this pattern? I’m confusing myself way too much. I researched it and it’s either a descending triangle or a symmetrical  triangle which could break either way. It has a 51% chance of breaking on the up side.

Is this correct? 
This 1h RSI hits 30 after a dump and a small bounce start movement is as sure as a atomic clock
When the price seems totally flat on bitfinex like the last mins, does that imply a hidden buy/sell wall? Or just an awkward silence ?
Eerily similar patterns... Maybe this time it's different!

4 Hr charts:

Finex: https://www.tradingview.com/x/mR0SxsIc/

Stamp: https://www.tradingview.com/x/nzCKQt2z/

Let's take a look at the finex hourly zoomed in a bit:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/XDLnXzXk/

I don't know if everyone was getting excited about a possible H&S on the hourly, but I'm not entering a **short** until it breaks down from 7750. That's the neckline, and a good R/R entry. 

Until then, it's just chopping in this range. I entered a long at $7850 on that short term support. Good R/R, stop is where the R/R is good for the short at $7750. Target exit is 8180:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/6U4KzTpV/

I don't have a lot to say longer term. We walked out of that big downtrend line, but it is yet to be seen if it is significant. A break up of $8250 will have me longing big again.

Happy trading out there folks.

Hi guys, been away for a few days, sorted my paperwork, made some changes to my regiment, hopefully now I'll be a lot less sloppy.

Watched a bit Cred's stream last night (guys smart af) and something he mentioned thats very simple yet i never thought of, keep track of your R:R and strike rate. Logically, the more data you have on your own trades the more you can analyse where you go right/wrong, deffo gonna start doing this.

anyway, here's a chart im looking at https://www.tradingview.com/x/lwt7Myl4/.

the general view im seeing is that we've had the bottom, the rest of this triangle is accumulation (potential alt season) and the triangle breakout should pop a BTC bullrun. At this point, i'm probably done shorting unless we break the weekly higher low at 7k. this sort of tightening whatever you want to call it, is just not worth it imo. rather wait for a decent break on either side and ride that.

Whilst btc accumulates, I'm picking up alts. until we fall below 7k i think alts will keep popping and even if we do get rejected at like 9-10k for max pain, thats more than enough time to snatch up some alt profits and potentially short again sub 7k.

also, the general mood seems to have turned from "this shit is going to 3k" to "what if this shit doesn't go to 3k, i dont want to miss it". i think the FOMO is slowly creeping in. combine that with alts being bottomed, TA formes its own self fulfilling prophecy and im really starting to believe that we'll have a fantastic rest of 2018.

OR, this is a massive bull trap, we get rejected at 11k, drop down to something retarded like 1k and have a crypto nuclear winter, we shall see when this whole thing hits climax in like mid may.
[removed]
Closed out 50% of my short from 8400 after watching that dump attempt get absorbed. If we move much farther north I'll close out the rest of it and wait to re-enter again higher starting around 8400.

edit: went ahead and closed the rest of it after seeing the slight increase in buying strength. Really wanted to let this ride but that feels like wishful thinking. I'll be happy with the profits I did make for now and keep my hodl stack in fiat as a de facto 1x short.
this is an archetype Head and Shoulders pattern!
Watching the 3D MACD on bitcoinwisdom. 3 squishys now since ATH. Will this one be rejected too? The last two rejections came with approx 15&#37; dumps. I can only find 1 other squishy that was rejected, back in April 2014.

Squishys that make it have repeatedly resulted in short term rallies. The "gentlemen" rally was one.
This is looking trappy and the meme formation is close to completing. Wouldn't be surprised to see a retest of 7800.

Short @ 813X.xx, target 785X.xx.

Let's see what happens, I have tight stops set up.
We're at the mercy of the global markets, right now. Stop reading tea leaves on the BTC chart to see where it will go. If the SP500 continues up from here, so will BTC, and we'll all look back at this as an Adam & Eve. If the SP500 goes lower, we'll probably visit $5k, and we'll all look back at that as a 5th wave completing.

[https://i.imgur.com/6kWyaRa.png](https://i.imgur.com/6kWyaRa.png)

Purple line is SP500 overlay to show the correlation. Blue ghost bars are my silly hopium scenario.
Well today I’ve lost 600$ trading. 

This marks 4600$ total lost trading  since our first crash to $5800. 

Most of its profit, I made nearly 3000% profit during the bull run but it still fucking hurts. 

What I’ve learned is to be patient. Too often I sit on a position and then immediately close it to just immediately open another one. Another lesson I’ve learned is to have a game plan. For example I had a short open today at 8140 and planned to close at 8250+ but I decided to close due to all the bullish posts when I knew in my head this head and shoulders pattern could have played out. 

Time to build back my empire from the ground up. Best of luck to all. 
How should I interpret the low volume on this pump? 
Back 50/50 at 8087. Bitcoin continues to hold above the 8050 support level, so I'm back in position but with tighter stops. Not going to bother trying to trade this range, but I think it's likely that we continue moving sideways until the range tightens enough for a break. I will be keeping an eye on the Bollinger Bands. Stops set at 8250 and 7850 in case there's a break while I'm afk.
Holyfuckin Rekt. 

So happy I went short a few hours ago. 
alts are not getting sold at all yet.. im not convinced this goes much lower as 7800, but lets see.
We bounced at 7.8 as prophecy had foretold. Its time to close your shorts and go long. Ignore the fact that this bounce has been no different from every other bull trap since 19k. 

Long this guys. 
Shower thought: 

What if the “whales” that initiated the big short squeeze will dump the coins they bought before the pump (at ~$6800) when we correct down to $7500? Everyone and their grandma / uber driver thinks we’ll bounce from there to form a bullish lower high.

Wouldn’t this be the perfect place for another bart formation, but in the opposite direction aka long squeeze? 
This looks promising. I'm kind of hoping if it touches 8k we'll get another 1k BGD.

Which would be nice. 
What qualifies a 100-150 pump as stop loss hunting? Not denying it, just want to try to understand the strategy. The big green rocket from 6.9 I can understand - but can these small pumps really be liquidating that many positions (I suppose the high leverage ones)? What would be the benefit to the pump this morning, let's say? To clear shorts to prepare for a move down? Or for another move up?
Just got my Web invite for Robinhood. I found this interesting:

>Is cryptocurrency trading part of my Robinhood brokerage account?
No. Your brokerage account is with Robinhood Financial LLC and allows trading of equities and options, while cryptocurrency trading is done through an account with Robinhood Crypto, LLC. Robinhood Crypto is not a broker dealer and is not a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Robinhood Crypto is also not a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), which means your cryptocurrency investments are not protected by SIPC.

Has anyone else used their site for crypto trading? I tried, but when I clicked on their little Crypto Disclaimer link to agree with their policy, etc. all I got was a blank page. 
BART! Why you little.....!
2.5% drop. everybody panic now!
Why is there never mainstream commercials for crypto by the exchanges? Trading websites like Charles schwab always have them.
Anyone holding a short from 'Bart's' hair still (8320+), are those hands still feeling strong? How close are people prepared to let it get before they close it out.

This is what I am looking at now, I appreciate that a HS formation is not confirmed but its target would line up with other matrices I am using if it confirms.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/Bev2D8HK/

If we retrace to my position at 8320 then I would really hate to have to close it since we have not yet realised any of the technical downside targets.
Further to my [previous chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Bev2D8HK/) this https://www.tradingview.com/x/lho5PbOV/ is now fully in play. Which for the retest of the neckline if you are daring it might be an opportunity to short if not already. I won't be since I am already fully short from higher.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/lho5PbOV/

Targets 7340 - 7250
I didn't noticed any whale involvement in the last 24-48 hours (last one being the pump from 8100 to 8400). I think the whales are waiting for the right moment, which is not too far away. What I noticed is a lot of organic trading.

My prediction is that the market is going to break upwards as it did from 6800 and 7800.

The price movement we have been seeing in the said period is very natural, there is a lot of organic trading going on, I didn't really noticed any manipulation. What we know is that there have been several failed attempts made to bring the price lower than 8K range. It is just a matter of time that traders start to realize the upward direction. Shortly afterwards, the green whales will follow.

Traders who are sitting on the sidelines will FOMO in, those shorting will get their stops, they will also FOMO in. The price will hit 9K and from there onward it will continue to 10K. 

All we need right now is people to start buying instead of sitting on the sidelines (at least trade, buy or sell); and; a whale or two to eat sell orders at just the right time and we will be heading to 9K. 

I am bored since I opened my long almost 36 hours ago, didn't closed it even when it stayed red for sometime, I think I have a good entry. Please come and let me know what you think of above scenario, do you see any limitations, what is your current trading status and future plans!
 
added to my short @ 7929
So I reset my phone with Authenticator on it. What do I have to do to regain access to my accounts
Damn. I'm on a bad luck streak.  Opened a short 2 minutes before that pump.  Fuck.
Based on previous movements this could even off around 8120 and then chop around until it breaks up or down again.

Still holding my long that i opened 2 days ago @ 8080.

Kind of regret not closing it when we pumped to 8.3, since i was 30% up at the time but I got greedy. Will probably close it this time arround.

Also have a small entry with my hodl stack, where i bought in for 20% @ 8320 (pretty much bought close to the top here). Down 5% on this small investment but not worried because i don't mind holding this for months and i have 80% to add on lower buy-in oppertunities. 

I currently feel verry comfortable with my positions so i'll just re evaluate whenever we pump or dump again
Bloomberg about to run a segment on BTC...
June futs looking cheap on Bitmex. If we pop back up over 8K then that's an easy $200 - $300 profit.

Weak pump, low volume. Lets see how this goes. Knocked down by 1h 50SMA.

Got an alert at ~3am and sold my remaining crypto at 8148.  I think this will be heading downward after bouncing off the ~~200SMA~~ 50SMA again. Stop loss at 8425.

Planning to re-enter at ~7600.

Feels like we're just getting propped up by low volume pumps, but we've seen it take us further before.

**Disclaimer:** The below post is about as BULL as it gets. Keep scrolling if wild speculations of future riches upset or disturb you. I don't have evidence. I have *feels*.

I understand many subscribers here are predominantly short-medium term traders, but this game is 4 decades long--we're only through the first quarter. By 2050, cryptocurrency will be ubiquitous; a necessity for everyone and anything who engages in commerce. 

Ever been frustrated that you weren't alive during the Land Rush of 1889? Me too. As lucky as those folks were, I believe our fortunes are greater still. Crypto presents an opportunity that spans state lines, national borders, and societal fences.  

There are people *not yet born* who will need these things. When the class of 2050 comes of age, cryptocurrency will already be an integral part of their lives. They will begin to generate incomes denominated in crypto. Their productivity will grow the global economy. Again--denominated in crypto. Those folks citing moons of $1,000,000 or more using current GDP statistics of ~$78 Trillion forget that both our population *and* productivity are increasing at ever-growing rates. With AI, these gains are in some cases exponential. This productivity will need to be quantified somehow. How? You guessed it--cryptocurrency.

Evangelism aside, this is the real deal, folks. It might not be Bitcoin, but it is certainly cryptocurrency. Cast your eyes to the horizon and don't lose sight of the ultimate stakes. But more importantly, have patience and live a balanced life that allows you to take full benefit of your investments in the future.

Thanks for your time.
So the fact 7.9 is holding reasonably well for now and we can’t seem to break 8.1 with any conviction, where do u guys think it’s going to break? I know a number of us here think it’s going to retrace back further to 7.5-7.7 however isn’t that exactly when the opposite happens...!
I am glad I didn’t open a short. I was thinking about it for a while but never did. 



:)
looking like 9.1k is medium term resistance with the obvious 11.7k being long term.  Need to break with conviction and volume. The resistance that became support  7.9K has held well.
i’m seeing a descending wedge that’s about to break. Anyone else see that?
~8550 would break the long term down trend resistance. We are within striking distance, but I wouldn't be shocked if we make one more move down before breaking through.
What do you think about the clear head and shoulders pattern on the 6 hr, starting from the 1k burst on 4/12?
Made this chart on 3/4/18 and it is still accurate. I think we are due to go down to ~$3k before resuming the uptrend. The recent pump is a bot circlejerk IMHO.

Noob question:
When you do TA on the charts for shorter timeframes (e.g. trendlines, channels etc.), do you use the chart of the exchange you trade on (bitmex for me), or do you use tradingview USD/BTC pair chart?
Now the question is, are we back to the previous ascending channel or just pierced it and about to fall from it again 
Any advice on what I can read to start understanding TA? What I know now is close to 0 and I’d really like to improve it. Anything helps, really. 
Thanks! 
BitMex margin question. 

If I enter 1000 USD and margin is set to 10X and click long I receive 1000 contracts. 

Are those contracts trading at 10X? Or what I really need to do is click margin 10X and buy 10000? 

Thanks!

Caught that pump in the low 8Ks. 

Daily stoch looking like it may reject that crossing it attempted. The daily candle is a bit early so I'm not quite changing my long term outlook yet but stoch RSI currently doesn't look quite as awful as before. With those two days, the center of the Sept-6k support line (now resistance) band has gotten up to around 8500. Daily BBands are right up there as well.

A plausible scenario currently is that we continue to chop slightly upwards upwards for a few days and take a possibly ill-fated shot at the ATH resistance around in the middle-upper 8ks.

It's early in the daily candle though, I could definitely see this ending up a doji that just ends up continuing the local downtrend. Tight stops at break even - bought in as risk management as I was confident the pump would continue a bit.

Another strawpoll; is it the end of the bear market https://strawpoll.com/273b174y
I'm going to give trading one more short, but these stop hunters are brutal. I had stop-limits on both sides of the consolidation, and price went one direction to trigger one stop and flew the other direction to trigger the other. I set those stops up an hour ago. I lost my money faster than if I was in Vegas. Anyone that says they have a win rate of over 2% in this chop... I find that hard to believe. Markets are way too illiquid for any TA to actually work out.

Edit: And these illiquid markets give rise to uncertainty and any serious buyer would rather not join "this party" while whale bots decide to play these games. I guess I'm bearish because of that, and should trade as such, but these bots could probably liquidate me at a measly 5x leverage anyways.

Need your opinion guys. If we see a drop in bitcoin in the next couple of days to 7400 - 6600 are we going to see drop in altcoins as harsh as it was when bitcoin was dropping before? I see that people become greedy in alts now and btc dominance drops. And I see that when market goes sideways some alts kind of don't care and still go up. What is your opinion? If I believe btc will drop in the next days shall I stay in cash or I can keep alts meanwhile?

I dont see a lot of selling or a lot of buying. The volume is too low, i think bears failed to crash bitcoin so it will go up.

Look at the volume since the BGD last week and compare it to any movements since when it retraced.  Basically there has been 1/10th the sell pressure as supported by volume.  It will probably oscillate over the next week between 7820 and 8400 until the huge resistance at 8500 finally cracks.

Of course she thinks that. Because if it *did* eliminate the need for brokers and banks, the entire global financial system that she leads, run by a group of elites and impoverishing 99% of the world and turning the planet into a giant garbage dump, would be under threat.

Sorry to hear mate - lately, the sub has been a good indicator of the direction we are heading. Moment we hit 8350, a lot of people on the sub opened shorts. I followed the plan as well, however, after couple of sideways, decided to enter back and in red now with this dip.

Any bullish indications from P&F? What scenarios do you see as possibilities should the retrace to 7.4k happen?
So pretty much wait until 7800 hits, open up a baller long and make dolla’s 
Bullishh
It's nowhere near the insanity it was, but yeah, if we can maintain this range with ever increasing shorts that should once again make a tempting prize. Too early to say though.
That too in the wrong range if I am not mistaken. 
Upvoted for the first paragraph alone.
> As for me, still hanging onto fiat after selling at 8.3k.

Should move to an exchange where you can short. No idea why I haven't before after trading BTC/USD for 5 years; currently profiting off this downtrend. Is pretty swell. 
Thanks again for your always balanced and clear analysis.
Great write up. Another indicator to add to this: Every time this year the daily RSI has approached ~60 we have seen a big pull back.
I don't see it specifically mentioned, but your chart gives us a reasonable chance of a bearish double-top at 8400 if we take several days to rebound here and approach 8400 as the log resistance descends to that same level (I think Friday-ish?). Then, we'll either need to pound through 8400 or we're in for a significant drop.
past few dumps..alts have not bled..could be a sign sentiment is shifting..
I think I went up a bit in sats.. what the heck is goin on
Not sure what your standard for not dumping is... on gdax, ltc bch and eth are all down 2-3%, btc down 3%. On Kraken GNO fell 6%, EOS fell 6%, etc... compared to btc 3% down.
Everything's already green on bitfinex. ALTS are all up, even if BTC drops to 7500 most ALTS would still be up given the current ratio. I am only adding this since usually when BTC is going up with such low volume ALTS barley keep up with the ratio then when BTC drops it takes the alts to a lower low. I am willing to bet that if BTC is going to pump to 9k or any target we won't see any significant drop before hand
Shorts open on breakdowns just like longs open on breakouts.

In this case we saw a 4 hr H&S breakdown, so it's not a huge surprise to me that a lot of shorts opened up, since the target for the H&S breakdown would be around $7400 (length of neckline to peak of head).
Auto buys? The volume has been low, maybe an small extanage doesn't manage that sort of thing intelligently
200$ explosion up or down. 

Place your bets. 
That image makes me pretty nervous lol
Is there any "game controller" formation analysis on b-bands lol

nice Bart formations there
What are you targeting for the bounce?
Totally agree. Everything in me says this should go lower, but I continue to see bullish sentiment and patterns everywhere. 

Longs are currently outpacing Shorts as well.
I think you nailed it when you said people are waiting for the market to make a serious move, but noone is willing to take the lead.  
You have to wait for that inner fullish confidence to fully bloom.

Then it will drop.
We're getting to the end of a huge pennant. This is called chop.
I feel the same exact way. Been trying to learn these markets and this recent sideways action is really not what I expected after our run up. 
Perpelexed too but we have been "bullish "for 11 days so far and tested the 8k for 3 with ATH Log resistance upon us. 
Apart for the short timeframes i don't think these movements do have so much importance on the big picture.
Either we break through the log line with volume and keep the price over it or we go test again 6500 and then ... who knows?

The problem is most of the volume is pumped by short/long hunting, otherwise it is stagnant.
I don't think new money is coming in/back honestly and also the sentiment out of reddit is basically non-existent.

The odds are against a break through in my opinion but let's see.
Umm don't say everyone. The people who got downvoted to the bottom / banned for alternative opinions called it correctly. 
Google trends for bitcoin keeps going down. Traffic on exchange websites keeps going down. Medium term its not pretty.
Been there before. Try coming up with rules that you stick by for *every* trade no matter how good it looks, write/type them out, and posting those somewhere around you.
Where is the neckline?
I'd say if 7.3 breaks, then 6.8 is very likely to break and I doubt 6k will hold up this time.
Sub $6k is still my view.
Do you think 7800 will hold? 
The important thing to remember with any formation is they are only a *potential* flag, head and shoulders, wedge, etc until they complete. 

And even then, your mileage will vary when it comes to the ensuing follow through. 

There have been a small handful of flags that have broken up or down but ultimately failed to meet their targets, but for the most part what we've been seeing is a series of failed breakouts in the direction one might expect.

Potential bull flags breaking down.

Potential bear flags breaking up. 

It points to indecision in the market, which shouldn't be too surprising considering the levels the market has been trading within when they behave differently than expected.

The bart formations have all been potential bull flags that failed to break up. They've almost all come at times where breaking up and meeting their upside targets would push the market above the log resistance line. So it does make sense that they've failed to complete.

The reverse has been true for recent bear flags that failed to break down. Had they completed and met their downside targets, the market would have pushed below $6,000.

So far the market hasn't had the momentum to reverse the bear trend, but it also hasn't had the momentum to continue it. The result is continuation patterns that, quite simply, don't continue.

EDIT: to add, you really should **never** trade within the confines of a flag formation. Trading the breakout is fairly low risk, and the rewards are near instantaneous when they play out as expected. 

If we assume that the current market action is forming a potential bull flag, then the target for a breakout would be approximately $1,400 to the upside (the pole extends from $6,800 to $8,200). If you enter at $8,100, there's still a significant possibility the flag could break down and the market would fall to $7,500 before hitting the next significant support zone after $7,800. 

If you waited until $8,500+ to enter, you are missing out on $400 in potential profit, but you'd eliminate a vast majority of the risk by entering at $8,600 with targets of $9,800 and stops below $8,400 (in the event of a fakeout to the upside).


The multi-month or even year long ones work. The small ones are 60-70% IME, less if they're on super short time frames.

*e* - The main problem I've seen is people not knowing the actual definitions for these chart patterns.
> I'm not so sure why everyone is so obsessed with bull flags and bear flags.

Because they're easy to spot everywhere, looking at different timeframes you can almost always find one forming to confirm your pre-existing bias on where you wish the market would go in the future.


Looks like they learned from their mistake (buying the top), but are well on their way to making a new one (401K loan)
No more sentiment analysis, which TA abstracts in itself by things like volume in your case
They are buying low, that's what you are supposed to do.  Much better than the people buying at 19k.
Personally I call it sentimental analysis, others probably do too.

I have a few SA indicators (friends and people i know from school, work, etc.). One asked me last week where he could sell his bitcoin and litecoin, because the price is bad. It's purely an anecdotal coincidence but that was only 12 hours before we had our giant green candle hahahaha.


The issue I have with this interpretation of a potential bull flag formation is that there was already a far more compelling formation that broke down:

https://imgur.com/a/Laf8a

While it's true that the market will often invalidate formation x only to create formation y, I'd be hesitant to open a long within the confines of the formation you've drawn.
Slanting up is not a bull flag. It's a bear slant on a bull pole. It's meaningless. Zoom out and see where it fits within the giant pennant we've been painting since December.
Nerve cracking!
Stops? 
No one goes broke taking profits.
same boat, keeping it open, got a limit close on it down below to catch a knife but no stops 
I would keep it with a stop loss at break even (+ fees). This has great potential to go lower
I would keep it open (I just opened more shorts after closing at 8100). Buyers look a bit stunned/anemic compared to how they had been. You would need to decide if you're prepared for it to go breakeven or be slightly underwater again.
Sit and wait; probably sleep too. 

Short from 8080 ~
Wait it out IMO. I’m trying to get a long position around 7600
Take the profit. Dumpy's done for the day. He'll dump again tomorrow, but the price will rise in the meantime.
Cheers gents. It’s sleep time where I am, appreciate your inputs. Will let it ride overnight, no stops.
The more I think about it, even though your indicator doesn't represent shorts vs. longs, it might have quite a bit of value as a weighted down volume vs up volume ratio. To be accurate you would need to break it up by 1-minute candles or maximum 5 minute and then aggregate the results across longer periods, since you could have mostly up volume in a day but still end down (and vice versa). Are you going to code it up?
Create an indicator and then backtest it over many data sets.

Careful to not adjust the indicator so that it is good for only those data sets (this is a very common pitfall in back-testing).

Also, make sure you define what makes your indicator "good", from a *statistical* perspective. That is, you are confident your indicator did not yield positive results due to chance alone (or rather, you have determined significance within some sort of *confidence interval*). This can be done by testing over many data sets, and also including some variable for randomness in your positions. Read up about your stats.

Finally, test it over new data coming in, and see how well it performs (again, verifying statistically).

This will take a fair amount of work.
I don't think this works. You can have a lot of selling volume that isn't shorting, it's longs from wayback exiting.

There's some flaws in these, just think about it.  
If I buy 1000 bitcoins from a wall and the price barely moves and afterwards it goes down, the formula would take that buy and put it on the short side and vice versa.  
However, I liked this and will test it to see if I can get any insights.  
Thanks
Your post and that candle just caused me to rush over to my account and close out my short. It remains to be seen if that was the right thing to do, but if you trade like me and are short, that candle is not what you want to see.

I am shorting anywhere we touch the blue and orange lines (old log support and ATH log resistance) which will most likely be ~8400

If we break above them I will re-enter a substantial portion of my hodl stack into BTC and ETH and my trading stack into alts as they seem poised to have a strong breakout.
Google trends tend to be more of a lagging indicator, rather than leading. I wouldn't put a lot of stock in them. They're interesting at the macro level only.
I think the mempool being empty is also an overlooked indicator of where we are.
Every time it breaks upwards I am pleasantly surprised.  The feeling is so foreign.

It mentions a head in shoulders pattern. If the current price consolidates on the 4H and we get rejected back down to the 7800-7900 range it could play out. Yes I know you can’t call this formation prior to it being complete ( I got down voted into the ground earlier today for pointing it out ), but just pointing out what my eyes see. 

That being said, a short entry here could be good. 
I just remember the last time when we were going directly trough the log trend line at around 11k and everybody was celebrating that and then it turned out it was just not important. At some point we will go trough this line, it is in the nature of things, but it does not mean we go back to 12k... why should it mean this?

Here you can see that we already broke this line once: [https://imgur.com/a/u8Ier](https://imgur.com/a/u8Ier)

8700 was mentioned as confirmed reversal ( a few weeks ago )  - when passed off course.

more like a bear trap to me.  trying to get more shorts lined up for the next pump 
Depends on how you draw it...using Bitfinex I'm seeing as low as $8.5k, but including the wicks we'd have to break $8.8k on volume to be safe.

Even then, we broke the existing line by $100 or $200 on March 4th and then plummeted right after...so I'd have to see $9k+ (and holding) to really feel that familiar tightening in my pants again.
I have the feeling it's the end of the bear market 
Was looking at that same pre-pump movement, certainly seems like it could be an inverse of that, maybe a stop hunt. Similar volume too, ~2.3k, at almost the exact same time of day

Log resistance is at ~8.7k if it rocketed up this minute
About 8500 on finex, a bit lower on Kraken.
Fake out possibly? Before we continue ze dump 
it's silent... almost too silent :)
Meanwhile inexplicably I am gaining SAT value so my portfolio is still in the green BTC wise. I'm beginning to think the alt holders who get ridiculed mercilessly in this sub might have a hand in propping BTC price up.
I shorted from here. I don't think we will make it up to 8400, but if we do, I will bail. I don't even think we will make it to 8200, but hey... what do I know.

Short from 8107 and stops at 8600+

Will bail manually if it rises slowly
0 effect
what monthly futures?
Hopefully we pump.

I think a lot of people are waiting for "tax" day to be over.

But the futures haven't really been positive in the past.

The downtrend log line will be at 8K on 4/30. If you're bullish and you expect to break it sooner than later, <8K is a decent spot to open. I'd never just "buy a HODL stack" though. $79xx probably isn't a terrible place to place *a* buy, though. But what do I know, I don't have a HODL stack. 
I guess most people is waiting to break the long term log downtrend resistance.
I feel for you mate, you are the first person came to my mind when I saw this happening. Keep your long open.
Any decent tradint strategy that is not manual (!) will have a fixed risk (in percent of account size) that is based on a VAR analysis - this is called optimal R.

The stop normally is part of the strategy. Many have it static, some have it smart. Risk Capital and Stop determine position size.
I usually set stops at wherever I would obliterate the last days of profit. So if I had. X BTC a week ago, I set stops to make sure I have X BTC if I exit this trade
I would not call that a chart pattern.
Looks symmetrical to me. 
I’d say descending wedge, and it has a potential to break to the upside. 
Your looking at a 12h slice of data, in a highly manipulated market. I would suggest zooming out so at the very least your not seeing different time zones having different opinions.

Also probabilities are on an s-curve, the jump between 50 and 51 is much smaller than 98 and 99; if your not 70% sure just don't do it. It takes a tiny amount of evidence to get to 70% accurate between 2 options.
It's not a triangle because it barely has any touch points. Short timeframe also. Just noise IMO.
It's not *completely* flat, so no, it's not due to a hidden wall. If there are big hidden walls holding price in place, you'd see it stuck at precisely the same point at least in one direction at least on 1 minute chart, but that's not the case here, it's moving a dollar or two all the time.

Hmm, already had it in my mind to wait for a drift up, then fakeout down, then do a long. Had forgotten that that's just how last week played out. 
I hope the volume difference is a key indicator of a different pattern emerging
Problem is any significant moves are gonna be sudden bgd or brd's, no time to think, only stop limit buys will let you catch some of the moves(if any). Danger to that is they're also stop hunting us. Best is to place your bets and hope for the best or just sit it out.

So, we can go either down or up. Noted!
Football episode I'm pretty sure where homer is the coach and just starts cutting people.
I'm starting to think going 1x long with half of the stack at $8K and setting a 1x long limit with half at $4200 and walking away for a few months might not be a bad play. :P

edit: oh, and 20x short with 5% at the ATH resistance 
Ugh I wanted to go short at 8400 but went 500 instead of 5000. Shorted at 8015 and unsure as to whether I should close now, I still think we might head down to around or below 7000.
Can you put it in a n00bs terms please. 
yeahhh im long but it feels like its barely holding on

Nice, SP500 is following Bitcoin.
Actually, billionaire Jeffrey Gundlach (CEO investment firm DoubleLine Capital) does believe the [stocks follow bitcoin](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/23/jeffrey-gundlach-says-if-you-want-to-know-where-stocks-are-going-next-watch-bitcoin.html).

> Strangely, bitcoin seems to be the poster child for social mood and market mood .... Weirdly, I'm actually using the sentiment regarding speculative assets like bitcoin as a guide to maybe what the future will bring ..

Of course most here would think "*bitcoin so small, stocks don't care*" or "*bitcoin is a bet against the traditional financial market*" but it is an interesting theory.
Is there actually any real correlation between BTC and SP500 performance?

Edit: didnt see the image.
[deleted]
> but I decided to close due to all the bullish posts 

half the reason people here are contrarians is to not let this shit get to them. It's much easier to hold a position open when you believe that the majority is wrong (which they often are)

the only time you should let it affect you is when *smart*, good traders are saying that stuff. if all the good traders here are flat or long, there's a decent chance you shouldn't be short. 
You’ll work your way back up and be stronger than ever homie. Keep that chin up, and keep the tenacity. This market may give us a lot of losses but i believe its the only way to really win in the long term (for me at least, made some bad decisions in life)

It does not take much extra buying to move the price quickly.
the waning volume of the already low volume bull flag is intriguing... gonna breakout but which direction?
Knowing bitcoin you’ll get stopped in both positions before it makes a proper move up or down 
For the sake of discussion, doesn't a margin long and a margin short at the same price make sense? Price is simply moving +/- $100 from the $8100 range. 
D'OH!

Not sure why I went long when it's obvious the people doing this live for these meme patterns

Imo I think the price gets propped up to firstly, liquidate over-leveraged shorts, and secondly, to incite some fomo and pump the price up further, whilst also bringing back confidence which will cause more longs to be opened, ready for the next BRD to liquidate them all.
I was highly anticipating using Robinhood for crypto but after I tried it to trade ETH, you can't buy/sell in the same day, you can't see the order book, I don't think it's free - double check that for your state, and I don't plan to trade crypto there anymore. I think it's great for stocks.  I do enjoy their referral stocks as well.
Hey dude. I use the phone app to just fuck around, i don’t think its possible online yet.

www.crypto.robinhood.com is where you want to look up info.

Also, out of the 4 exchanges i’ve used, Robinhood is still 2nd to GDAX (Binance and Polo being 3 and 4) when it comes to trading coins for now. Right now the main problem is limit orders aren’t really free because of the market collar they use forcing you to buy a few bucks higher.
It's not about this drop, it's about how the market behaves, and how this behaviour is indicative of a market that is unwinding from an influx of literal dumb money that is still allowing these ridiculous movements to be profitable for a certain subset of traders.
In Canada we've been getting Coinsquare ads during the NHL playoffs and billboards here in Toronto with "FOMO is a MOFO" as the tag line. Never used them but they're making a push.

Bittrex was instantly swamped when they reopened briefly. Maybe they're busy enough as is. 
English Premier League games have a lot of crypto commercials around the edge of the pitch lately.
1) They are busy enough trying to scale as it is 

2) If you're talking about the US, there aren't that many exchanges that comply with regulations across many states (see Finex ending service to US customers, many others)

It's kind of funny. If you're a US customer and want to trade leverage on a legitimate exchange, your options are very limited. If I can't short (hedge or otherwise), I am not interested in trading on the exchange. So they make a liar out of you. You have to trade unverified accounts, maybe through a VPN, etc. 
That's when you sell the lot
FWIW, Chewy is short from 8330 if I recall, and his stops are breakeven. I'd ride that short. I know 6 days in crypto is an eternity, but the ATH downtrend line will be at 8400 at midnight on 4/23. We should either bust down hard in the next couple days or finally break free of that line. We can't chop around this zone for much longer without encountering it.
I closed mine. Really wanted to ride it out but seeing two bart sell-off attempts get eaten I'm not convinced sellers have enough to get it done without another rise up to 8400.
Still holding my short with CA of 8367. I've been debating just taking the profit today since it pushed back to 8100. The fact that it has been creeping up since 7900 and any selling momentum seems to fizzle out pretty quickly, certainly makes me second guess my hopes for this trade, but I'm trying be patient and to stick to my original plan here. 

My original plan was to ride this down below 7800. I don't have a specific target price in mind yet, but I was going to evaluate a more precise exit plan below that point. On the flip side, I'll bail at a breach of the ATH resistance line. I still have a couple more sell orders up to about 8550 in case of an attempt at that resistance line. 

I'm still in the green, and funding isn't hurting me, so I'm just testing my patience in the no mans land zone of my trade for now.
I closed mine and the price is now above where I. closed. Had a short open from a higher price point, but I accidentally closed it thinking I was cancelling a stop
Do you have any statistics on this organic trading going on? What constitutes "organic" vs "inorganic"? What percentage of volume has been organic compared to the slide from 9k -> 6.4k? What evidence do you have that traders will "realize the upward direction"? What if they "realize we're in a bear market"? What statistics do you have to back up your manipulation claims? You say "all we need right now is people to start buying..." why is that any more likely to happen than people starting to sell?

Idk man, none of what you said seems very analytical to me. Appears like you're just on that hopium and tilting at windmills.

Reality: Bounced off log support - turned resistance, daily stoch RSI is still crossed, ATH resistance sitting in the mid-upper 8k range, hidden bear div present on 4 hr through daily time frames, bounced off upper daily BBand... it all screams "retrace." Obviously if this is truly the end of the bear market all that can be invalidated, but we won't really know that's the case until it happens.
The "price going up is organic, down is whale manipulation" cognitive dissonance is something that needs to stop.

Onward to 10 k.

It's interesting, at the start of April there was a post about end of April price.

I collected the responses... 340 or so of them and the average predicted price was $10,043 for end of April.

You seem to have it under control but you should always make a plan for your exits before the trade otherwise you’ll never close and take the gain. 
Did you close it?

gotta love how optimistic shitposts get the +votes, while any realistic or pessimistic posts get the -votes. hope y'all get fking rekt in the next dump.
Not sure about that stop buy. Even if we break 8400, the next resistence is our good old longterm log resistence, currently at 8700, which we might fail and drop afterwards. I would either put my stop buy at 8250 or 8800 tbh....

Don't mind the downvotes. Most people here have substantially less imagination than even the current global policy makers. Time will prove you right.
With all due respect... you need some perspective, badly. This entire post comes across as frankly a bit unhinged. You've provided zero logical reasoning to support your perspective beyond buzzwords - you even *acknowledge* this from the start. No offense, but take that shit back to /r/bitcoin. This sub is the last bastion of semi-rationale discourse in the crypto space, stop ruining it with your moonkid hyperbole. 
Why would crypto be ubiquitous? The benefits that cryptocurrencies have are irrelevant to most people and the drawbacks they have are a big deal.
It's going sideways IMO, barring any negative news the ultimate direction will be up. Alts are going up, it usually happens when BTC is consolidating for another leg up.

It's actually 8725, roughly. Holding 8850+ would qualify. It will be 8550 by Friday lunchtime UTC.
I think we broke it (at least on the 4h, don't have 6h on tradingview) and that we will retest the neckline a few times from below before going down more
> The recent pump is a bot circlejerk IMHO

Anything to indicate this? Actually curious.
Good luck with that one.
Honestly you can make a lot of "trend lines" look like they work when you zoom out that far. I don't see any pattern recognition from 3/04/18 to now so it basically looks like you drew a line and zoomed out until it fit. Not much significance, charts like these remind me of what people actually see VS what they want to see.
I believe you're missing a verrrry important trend line, my friend.

Exchanges that use the tradingview plugin (bitmex, bitfinex, not sure of who else does) are the gold standard. Being able to drag and move orders is the GOAT feature. 

I doubt most people use it for more than an occasional doodle, just use the full tradingview suite for your actual charting IMO

1,000 contracts at 10x requires a $100 margin (in BTC). 

If you reduced the leverage to 5x, you would need a $200 margin.

Took long enough

Depends where your from. I'd say a capital gain with a zero cost basis (its all profit).
The money is taxed as ordinary income and you report it on your US tax return as interest income.(edit: you can also just call it all capital gains with zero cost basis, IRS doesn't care too much as long as you pay the proper amount in taxes) Bitfinex accrues and pays out interest daily, whereas poloniex only pays out the interest at the end of the loan term or when the borrower closes the loan.

Regardless of when you receive the interest, you are taxed on the FMV of the interest at the moment you receive it. If you sell your interest earnings at a later date then  that is a separate tax event and you must report a capital gain or loss.
Just curious, what kind of returns are you getting?
Bitcoin.tax doesn't automatically handle this? I didn't provide funding so I don't know...

I think you're getting too cute trading anything but this range:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/CnZqc8rD/
> market is too easily manipulated

Maybe instead of making excuses learn where you went wrong? 
How and why do you say that? Don't even want to roast you or get into a fight about it, I'm legitimately curious as to what the signs of manipulation are, other than saying the price moves up or down too quick.

On 30m and 15m BB's were suuuuper tight, and they've shown themselves as such before most of our large price movements recently whether they are up or down. I wasn't in position for this mini dump so it might be easier for me to look at it this way, just my thoughts. 
Guys... your stops are too tight.

How are you getting stop hunted? I havent gotten stop hunted in weeks.

My current short has a stop well above 8600 and Im thinking of moving it up.

2 days ago I shorted at 8250 and the price went up to 8400. Closed at 8022 (too early, I know).

You need to be prepared to lose some money if you wann make money
precisely the reason why I moved to longer term mostly-one-directional trades with layered entries and almost no stop losses.

which did get me rekt during the BGD.. but otherwise has worked well.
Gotta be patient and play 4h+ if you want to make money.
I don't know how anyone can identify a H&S formation until after it has completed and hit it's target.

If you change your timeframe and zoom in, there are H&S (and inverse) formations all over the place. There's almost an infinite number of them depending on how you set your graph up. Very few do anything of note once they hit the neckline.
you're cutting all sorts of good stuff with your neckline I think. But it could happen, volume kind of concurs.

It could still happen like this: https://www.tradingview.com/x/EGhnEe4Q/
it’s not showing clear signs of a dump. Wouldn’t be surprised if we bounced off it
on coinbase?:))
I think if Bitcoin tanks, alts will tank with them. BTC represents cryptocurrency confidence as a whole, which is still very low. It's returning, but when BTC looks wobbly again, all the alts go down.

I think we need to reach $11,600 before this coupling will break.
If BTC drops that much alts will drop too.  But will BTC drop?
If BTC drops, alts are getting slaughtered IMO. Alts are literally useless right now.
Got stopped? or closed manually?
3D squishy is all good if we find a floor around 7600. 
Could be, but having only two point of contact (one being the current candle) does not make a compelling argument. You could have drawn it higher with the second point of contact at the last green candle on your chart, and it would now be broken. 

You are onto something with the rising wedge, but the bearish case made by other indicators makes me think that the bottom trend is lower. 
That's what shorters have been looking at since 8300. Due to the violence of the BGC upwards, it would be a rising wedge until we break under 7300 or so. 
Good eye
I've noticed the same there for many days at different times.
I'm definitely very bullish. Yeah short term we could drop more, but long term I don't see this going any way but up.
yes. SL @ 7800 support. If it falls, 6700 is next. BTC candles are so easy to read these days right? 
No.
how to make the bears and the bulls happy with one comment
*and a hero was defeated this day*

Seriously dude i looked up to you man. Why not just shift slighlty from overweight to neutral weight to underweight when you feel bearish and then back to neutral and then to overweight again when you are bullish?

Yea the gains aren’t as much but the losses aren’t as much either. I dunno... I guess do you. Good luck dude.
It's sad because bulls never learn. This is the n-th time they've fallen for this. They even say it's alt season again (aka pump each other's bags then get out before everyone else does because no new investment is entering the space to prop it up long). The whole space is a giant casino and everyone is playing high leverage musical chairs.
Its pretty clear we barted here. Now, will it be a succesful test of support to a new high, or will it be the first sucessful H&S pattern for bitcoin in a very long time? 
haha i just went here and wanted to write exact the same  thing XD but we had a complete bart when it dropped
This is total and absolute horse shit. Let's not even talk about the fact that the Netherlands are a nothingburger in Crypto to begin with.

I have been in this space for a long time, and I have seen people buy obscene amounts of Bitcoin, but NOONE is buying 200k BTC at once. Noone. No Hedge Fund is putting 1.6 billion USD into BTC. Let alone double that. No pension fund, no billionaire, no noone!

This is bullshit

Anyone who bought that many BTC bought them last year. And it probably took them months.

Moreover, of course there's no sellers for 200k BTC. When has there ever been that many sellers? Maybe at 20k? Maaayyybbbeeee

Under 8000 if you walked away....
They are on the verge of collapse.
Some bear whales just want to offload their BTC without crashing the price, because they expect the price is going to drop with or without them. Not all bears are trying to manipulate the market to make bank on their shorts.
I think people have just been generally more sceptical to short/sell this bounce so far, while those people that were caught off guard and didn't get to buy the 'bottom' have no option but to either buy-in, or wait until it drops again - hence not selling.
It's not the 18th yet, it's all horseshit but if your a believer in it it would naturally be on the 18th the day after the last day for declaring taxes - not day of.

 0.001 BTC = 1 tuna sub. Tuna is whales favorite food.
I have to watch it at 2.5 aggregation. .01 is mind numbing.
I'm sure everyone will have different theories. My guess would be that someone has a bot to split their buys/sells into a bunch of small orders and the bot exits/enters their position whenever it is supposed to.

Maybe only 0.5 BTC gets filled or maybe even 0.1 BTC. Either way, by constantly trading right, they might make a good amount of profit daily that is variable.
What’s the significance here? Small time retail investors? Bots?

Maybe, but the news is legit.
Theres something called prices law that describes the 1% phenomena. If you think bitcoin will be better in terms of wealth distribution it really isnt (and we already know this anyway). The distribution the law describes seems to be a part of nature and can be seen in many systems that involves networks of people and complex systems. Theres a train of thought within btc that traditional finance is evil but programmable money will come without these flaws but the truth is that the distributiion seems less to do with economic policy and more to do with just how things are. Even if btc does become mainstream and dominant it would just mean that that we create a different 1%.

Which means smart people should start hoarding Bitcoin now, in case their country goes to shit. This is why Peter Thiel is hoarding. That guy preps.
It's not thriving because of the oppression, it's thriving because their fiat is worthless.
It's amazing how many times in history a currency has just suddenly become worthless.  

Never forget that the Greek government just took money out of people's accounts during the last financial crisis.
But it still is interesting that (a) it is 2.5% - something that tiny. We really need llghtning and (b) it is being actually used ;)
Parabolic increase in volume for a particular market isn't interesting?  You have a very myopic view on the purpose of bitcoin.
Agreed.
indeed. But growing 8.5% of the shorts with no apparent reason and with little impact of the price is just insane.
What do you mean?
I've thought about it, but not a fan of the exchanges with leverage available in the US. I'm perfectly happy just sitting out and being in a good long term hold position once I'm comfortable saying the bear market is over (or at least won't return to where my average buy in is, currently ~7.2k). I realize there's tax implications, but given that my position up until the 6k crash was relatively tiny (I DCAed into a position 10x my original investment sub 8k and then sold everything again around 10.8k) I'm not really putting the clock back on the being able to exit with long term capital gains too much.
Thanks, glad you enjoy it. I write these out for my benefit too - helps me stick to my plan and avoid getting too caught up in short term movements.
Yep, didn't mention that but it'd definitely be a possibility. Would say that the double top in that case wouldn't confirm until we fall past whatever local low we make here. I would also say failing to break the ATH resistance would be a more important bearish sign than a double top at 8.4k confirming, but it'd definitely provide confluence like the two 11.8k attempts.

That said, personally I think that if we do hold up in the 7ks or bounce again off 6.6k there'd be enough bullish signs/sentiment to break the ATH resistance. Resistance doesn't seem to hold at a 4th attempt very often (support doesn't either which is why I'd expect to break down if we do go back to testing 6.6k). Would obviously be evaluating TA when either of those attempts occur of course.
Yeah, I remember in pre BCH fork days alts did that too, just stopped reacting to BTC dumping and went sideways.
alt season? 
Happens when the people trading are looking at the USD value, normal IMO. They'll catch up and drop with some lag. 
I'm taking about didn't bleed in SATs..you must be looking at USD value?
True im already selling percentages of my alts to btc. 
Thanks for heads up on H&S, I've started ignoring this pattern I didn't even see it any more. It looked to me more like flat ABC correction is going to happen. So break out would have been bellow 8250. A proper entrance for a short. Lets see if H&S will play out this time around. I've stopped believing in this pattern in crypto a while ago. 
rien ne va plus
$200 down followed by $1000 up? :)
good that ETHorse launched today! https://www.reddit.com/r/Ethorse/comments/8cydk7/ethorse_is_now_live_on_mainnet/
If I had to say, another trip to 7.5ish seems like a decent candidate for a bounce as that's where an old log resistance (that the mega green candle broke through) will likely be tested for support.
Since you have been around for quite some time, what do you think the outcome will be? 
[deleted]
I have it at 7858. We are holding above that by a string 
Ya, it's definitely time to be concerned below $7,300. But at least for now there's no reason to panic. 

I wouldn't go opening a fresh long anywhere in the $7,000 to $8,800 range...but it's not time to panic either.
I should really edit my post to make my sentiment more clear.

"If $6,800 **breaks down**, I'd be very surprised if $6,000 didn't **follow close behind**."

Follow close behind here means, "will break down also."
Not for much longer, no. 

Buyers have proven time and time again that they want the price to move up...but they want somebody else to do the hard part for them. 

They're happy to buy what they view as "cheap coins" during small dips, but they can't pull together the momentum they need when it comes time to push through resistance. 

So sure, $7,800 might hold right now and perhaps there will even be a few more pushes to $8,100 or so in the next 12 to 24 hours. 

But eventually sellers will get tired of waiting for a better opportunity to unload and they'll just plow right through what little buy support remains in the $7,800 zone.
It's interesting that we're only a week or so away from the downtrend line dropping under 8400. Granted, we were below $7k a week ago, so there's that. But that downtrend line feels more aggressive than before. It will be interesting to see what happens when that line hits $8k, if we're not over it by that point. 
Really appreciate these longer posts you've been sharing the last couple of days. Very insightful.
50% of the answer is that they are easy to spot. 

The other 50% is that the moves are explosive and short-lived. If you enter at the beginning of a breakout, you can do so on high leverage and exit for a small loss if the breakout stops short of its target and reverses in the opposite direction. 

To use a gambling analogy, trading a flag breakout is essentially like playing roulette and placing a bet on black just as the ball looks like it's going to settle into its final resting place. And if the ball happens to bounce unexpectedly into the adjacent slot, you have the option to pull 90% of your bet back off the table.
That's probably exactly it.

I call it "peer sentiment analytics". I've had one friend agree to buy bitcoin with me, but never put aside the money for it and couldn't buy when I bought (that was last year); and I have a friend that was talking to some other guy about buying bitcoin from their acquaintance, and looked to me for guidance... but he hasn't brought it up since (that was a few months ago). And a few months ago, a cousin of mine wanted o buy bitcoins from me at a family discount, to which I declined.
Hesitant? You'd be downright barmy to open a long here.

Although maybe I'm bias, because apart from hedging any position could be interpreted as nutty right now.
Well, they needn't have worried.  The IRS web site is down.  No rush now.
7500
I like your style. Was totally working too before the BGD. 
Prudent to set alarms and an emergency stop just in case.
Outside of Trading View, I haven't. If you're going to move forward with it, let me possibly give some ideas further...

If we know the difference between the "shorts and longs" as a percent change and compare that to the price percent change, it may have some value in determining if price is being "propped up" -- in other words, being set up for a Judas Swing.

Not smart enough or have the skill set to further develop this, but if you do, I hope you can make something of it.

Cheers!
His/her question wasn't, Does this create winning trades? His/her question was, Is this indicator a correct representation of shorts/longs?
Similarly, you can have buying volume that is caused by shorts exiting, thus reducing the number of shorts but not increasing longs.
Can you show or describe what you mean?
Looks like it was the right thing to do. Congratulations, at least someone uses my brain to do good trades.
Probably depends on your value proposition of Bitcoin. If you base your fundamental valuation on speculative uses only (e.g. store of value) then I agree.

If you want it to be a currency (which involves spending, everyday transactions) I can hardly imagine it to be successful and growing when Google Trends point down.
Ding ding ding! This is a very good indicator. 
Could you elaborate?
He/she is referring to one of these two possibilities:

It's honestly not as nuts as you might think.
It's not as stupid as you may think. Taxes and the uncertainty of the bear market was the perfect reason for me to not only sell what I needed to pay my cryptogain taxes but to sell everything for mental reset and re-strategize. It turned out in my favor because I sold everything higher than current prices.

I am sure I am far from the only one. Had it been a middle of a bullrun, I would have MAYBE paid taxes from outside funding but that was not the case this year.
yes, cant we just explain that crazy profits mean people sell them. Think about it. X buys 10 btc at 2k. Like a lot of people. He can afford it. Why exactly wouldtnt he take 230k of life changing profit while he can? Not everyone needs a lambo.

Hell, if you invest that money in some good company you can get a super helpful extra income in dividends alone.
Hahah sup. Dat 7 day ban fucked me n you over big time ;)
It is what it is. We aren't in control of the bias/censorship/juvenility that goes around here, all we can do is have self awareness of the issue!

To name a few: HitBTC, Cex, and also Stamp.
Are they? I usually am fantastic at attracting mod attention and I have gotten nothing.
Thanks man. I had a similar situation back in February where I lost 30% and took a week off. I then proceeded to triple the stack in March (all 5x-10x trades, no crazy leverage). Comes and goes.
Haha thanks, man. It hasn't really been consuming me, but I just feel less confident on my decisions since the 6400 bottom. Stepping away and zooming out feels like the right call to me. 
They'll fud it, but the inquiry does look to have consumer's best interests in mind and seems constructive and not anti-crypto.
Could be the proverbial straw to break the camel's back right now. 
Pretty much this.  The exchanges that are under the NY dfs jurisdiction are already complying as much as possible.  The exchanges that aren't don't give a crap what NY dfs says.
They probably won't agree with the stance of "1.2$ billion fiat equity is totes stashed somewhere. Trust us." Not that they can do much.

Sorry for any perceptions of FUD spreading by noting this.
For real, what kind of a retarded bulltard thinks shorts have to close at any point. We're shorting this shit all the way down to where it belongs (which is $0), so really, just sell now before it's too late.
The volumes only low until it isn’t...
Just hedge if you’re worried
Depends on what exchange you're on - I'm checking two and seeing some rather different things. That said, I'd just stay out for the time being.
Im thinking of hedging if we don’t see any movement, but the fact that we are stuck in this tightening wedge is somewhat unnerving.

I think we blast off pretty soon. Downside has been tested enough. Time to aim for the log resistance line

EDIT: lol... looks like I was right
buy low sell high
I think if it was going to happen it would have happened by now.

I mean it can still happen, def lots of shorts around to rape. But I think this is more of a case of someone using the hope of a BGD to unload on people

i.e. get suckers to buy in thinking, a BGD is coming and they can get out at $9K while the suckers wait for $10K 

basically if this was a true reversal, I think we would have seen $9K by now 
Noob here.  I am sorry, what is bgd?
that's not what i see on my chart. the last two times we hit this line we failed to break and made lows.
https://www.tradingview.com/x/UPUZ0H3u/

Not broken on Bitmex. I didn't check for the sum of exchanges yet though (easy to do on tradingview, sum up prices of BFX / stamp / gdax / kraken / whatever and divide by number of exchanges)
Linear not log
beartrap?
~700 longs opened while about ~400 net shorts opened (~200 closed, ~600 opened)
yeah, Im thinking of shorting soon and setting stops at 9.5k
We will probably find out soon enough
not unheard of ;)
seems like that, we were so close to dropping yesterday and verge went up like 30%, bunch of alts up 15%, such cushion
That is a very popular opinion , 
literally no selling at all on bfx.

If we bounce off the bottom of the channel, we could be looking at as high as 8435 before being rejected. 

I’ll probably add on the way up 
hahahhaha :D Maybe my buy will hit at least !
This made me laugh out loud haha
no I am fine here


edit: NOW it got hit, I actually wanted to move it like 3% down but Bitmex died :) well well. At least I feel alive now, it was worth it
It's not stops, it's Mark Price. People are getting liquidated left and right because June Futures Mark price went from $8,030 or so to $7,700 while the spot market went from $8,100 to $7,850. 

So the premium dropped from -$70 to -$150 in the span of a few minutes.
No it doesn't. it shows how highly leveraged people were.
I am very interested in becoming selenite.
Thanks for the advice.
Got a long Open from 7865. Probably a stupid idea but the neck line is barely holding on. 
So pretty much we are flirting with the resistance line, if it breaks the upside we should see a relatively large pump. 
this is what I mean https://i.imgur.com/93cA6ij.png 

But there is  no volume, so that would be the indicator i guess
good bot
Nah. You're ridiculous.
What is BGD and BRD meaning?
Isn't that always the case? There's 3 scenarios: up, down or sideways. Only things that change is the probability of the 3 right?

The way i always play this is that i never know which way it will go. i can have general market feelings but be prepared for all 3 scenarios with an emphasis on the, what i see is the most likely scenario.

Overall though, id think that my post is mostly bullish no? "probably done shorting", "picking up alts"

with a sprinkle of healthy skepticism, "bull trap".

Idk, its just the way i think about it

EDIT: guess what im tryna say is that id rather have the opposite view in the back of my head as being perma anything blind sides you
Ahh shit yeah that's it.
Finding a good "set it and forget it" strategy gets sexier to me by the day, but I hate doing that when I'm not convinced we're done w/ the bear yet. At the very least I've got to hold fewer positions and only make 1-2 trades a week/a few a month at excellent r/r's. Shit is killing my sleep.
Flair checks out
I had a pretty heavy short from 8400 and set a SL at 8150 last night that got hit. So I took a small profit and lost a great entry. It was silly of me specially with us hovering 8050 by the time I went to sleep. But I opened another albeit smaller from here at 8100 and I'll add if we go higher unless it's a BGC.

I'm keeping my eye on this rising wedge. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/1tPlSGWP/
So a long time ago some of us called the macd histogram turning green a "squishy" on longer time frames like the 3 day. Almost always they were the beginnings of bull rallies. But since January 2 have been dumped on. Wondering if this one will get dumped on too, or will proceed like it used to.

There was a big rally in November 2014 we called the gentlemen rally that turned into a nasty bull trap. You'll just need to read the daily sub from like November 11th or so to understand.
What are your stops? Bellow 7800?
n/\n
sideshow bob formation
the bart
In seriousness, he probably means the so-called "bart" formation, or else the head and shoulders, both of which are thrown around here endlessly. It could be both, if the right shoulder is a bart :P

(not a serious chart, but what they could be referencing): https://www.tradingview.com/x/lgz59HVC/
The "Bart"
Or, they both map to the risk appetite of big players in some kind of indirect / messy way that we're now seeing in the charts more strongly because a larger proportion of the money entering bitcoin is from traditional markets versus cryptokiddies.
For those who don’t know, Jeff Gundlach is a top financial manager. He ran a big fixed income platform at TCW then opened his own shop. Very smart manager. He one time caught an art thief because they googled a unique phrase in a foreign language that was on the back of a painting that was stolen from him. Not sure why I wanted to include that, but I feel this guy is really an outside the box thinker.
Sometimes yes, sometimes no. It has a history of coupling and decoupling.
Why? Why would they be following their crypto trades by the SP500?
I was fairly confident we would drop. Last second switched from a short to a long and 15 minutes later the crash came. 

I only seconded guessed myself because I’m new to trading. Sometimes unsure if I’m making the right called based off my crappy TA. 
Just going to play smarter now. Less looking at order books and more smart trades ( 1 or 2 a week ) instead of a trade every 6 hours. 
Wow mean guy
If you don’t care, why do you care to comment on my post? 

Good day sir. 
Be more excellent in future.
Oh alright sounds good.


Interpreting volume is honestly a huge thing that I can't wrap my head around. I'm sure I'll learn eventually but for now I'm clueless.
That's why I never have two stops. I can live with getting boned once, but not twice
Yeah, until it doesn't. This falls under the "clever on paper" category of trading that usually just ends up losing money. It's generally better to scalp one side of a channel in the direction that matches the current trend, or else open long at the bottom of a channel and short at the top of a channel. 

In other words:  
1) Long 8000
2) Short 8150  
3) Ignore the chop and close once there's confirmation  

Or, if you're bearish, short 8100 and close at 8K, repeat. If you're bullish, long 8K and close at 8100, repeat. 
Sorry if my response to your "$200 down followed by $1000 up? :)" pulled you in. 

I'm still long btw, took my CA down to about 7900 as planned.  


Stupid question, where is the definitive place to see okex futures?
Just google “Bart Simpson” and take a look at the shape of his head and you’ll know what I’m talking about...

The massive, vertical (up, sideways for a bit and then down) spikes in price lately. 
'Big Green Dildo'
Is it a purposeful technique (stop hunting), or is it more of a dick move? Serious question.
except when it goes up, then it's always organic buying
I thought that might be the case, even though they say you don't pay more than the price displayed (hueh, hueh). 

Guess I'll stick to GDAX. Thanks for the info!
Cme and cboe
This is what concerns me, the chart is hammering in lots of lower pinbars as buyers come back in on the dips. Looks fairly bullish in the very short term with a potential bull flag.
First thing, I think you need to relax. 

The point of my post is to put forward my opinion and share my experience and knowledge with others, rather than proving anyone wrong. 

Moreover, I am sure there are more than one TA experts who can answer all your questions, I can answer only one.

> You say "all we need right now is people to start buying..." why is that any more likely to happen than people starting to sell?

In the last 15 minutes, almost 250 BTC are sold, price is back right at where it was. If I was one the the traders who sold in this period, I would regret on my decision of selling. This is simply human psychology. 

There is a lot of evidence that this is the case. Price drifts upward on low volume then some dummy dumps millions of dollars worth of BTC over a 15 minute period.  Parent is wrong though: Whales have been active in the past 24 hours, just not as obvious. Bear whales becoming increasingly desperate and ineffective as supply dries up.

That's my take. Don't go short if you know what's good for you.
Seems about right, then a doubling in May.
I didn't noticed that particular post, predicted price looks good and logical but how did you analyzed the responses? 
What was the median predicted price?  Would be more interesting imo
i believe i never got a prompt for a recovery key.
Thanks. I went ahead with their recovery on the exchanges and sent them my ID and a pic of me so hopefully they get back to me soon. Also I’m in no rush I’m not selling at these prices.
Wha-? 


No, it's still open. will cash out instantly if we reach above 8.3 again
Why is that prime fuckery time? TIA
I'm in from 7k, so I'm all good brah.
I'm not short, just sitting in fiat at the moment. I do plan to buy back in further down, but if we break 8425 it's likely that we will move further up, so I'll take the small loss while regaining my position. 
Misread my chart. It should be the 50SMA. It's currently at ~8600 on the 1D chart. 
It's the white line on this chart. 
https://www.tradingview.com/x/CbsHJkcI/

I'll admit it's not the strongest indicator, but my feeling is that in order to have the momentum to break through the ATH log trend, bitcoin will have to consolidate some more and revisit the mid 7000's.

The way I look at it, if we don't retrace a bit, we'll fail to break through the log trend so we'll be heading down again anyway.
https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/17/17247946/bitcoin-new-york-attorney-general-eric-schneiderman-investigation
NY AG said he's starting an inquiry into exchanges.  That's all I gathered.  
I'm just reading the market response in other subreddit and social groups. I know it's not FUD and the market is past the point that even a strong FUD could initiate a significant downward movement IMO. I think it was not a coincidence that sudden market sell was in line with that news coming out. 
Makes more sense to me than TA mumbo jumbo that ALWAYS works in this market
Yep, now comes the fun part of the H&S, the drop.
H&S target is the length of head to neck... around 7400 which is the .618 fibo. I'm on about 6x leverage so I may close 80% for profits and hold the rest as a hedge. We'll see. 
I've become a Buddhist and released all antipathy toward bears. Short away, my friend--we'll be together in the end.
Only if you buy haircoin.
I'm providing the best-case Bull scenario. There are plenty here who provide the polar opposite--Bitcoin goes to $0 and the crypto space washes out into obscurity.

It's fine if you disagree, but start by addressing my points instead of calling me an unhinged moonkid. 
>The benefits that cryptocurrencies have **(today)** are irrelevant to most people and the drawbacks they have **(today)** are a big deal.

I agree. That's what makes us early investors. Many of the benefits are theoretical and still in development. This will not be the case in the decades to come.
Why would crypto be ubiquitous? Quoting from IMF director Christine Lagarde's latest (yesterday) blog post:

> [...] decentralized applications spurred by crypto-assets will lead to a diversification of the financial landscape, a better balance between centralized and de-centralized service providers, and a financial ecosystem that is more efficient and potentially more robust in resisting threats.

https://blogs.imf.org/2018/04/16/an-even-handed-approach-to-crypto-assets/
Most alts are really really far overextended. I don't think they have the juice in them to take another big leg up. Some have been going up for over two weeks without any meaningful pullback, can't last forever. 
same... thanks to alts low timeframe charts
I see a descending triangle on the 1Hr, I may close my short for a small profit.  

Edit: https://www.tradingview.com/chart/2fHwIr1l/
When you google  head and shoulders pattern, every chart generally shows the neckline breaking, then a strong bounce to the neckline just to get stopped there,  soon to be absolutely fucking dumped. 
> That’s saying if we don’t break the resistance line from 20k/ 11.9k

Totally true.
H&S and iH&S are often wrongly called in this sub so it is downvoted  on sight :) but this one was pretty textbook (although we need more volume now). 7900 seems to be defended a little bit and it is possible that we retest the neckline from below later on. I'm short from 7920 with a price target between 7600-7300
not sure if this is what you wanted

https://www.tradingview.com/x/bCCFazWu/
https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/head-shoulders.asp
wanted to see if the buyers had it in them to cause a short term reversal over 8k for a higher price entry - doesn't look likely. If it happens and i've missed my slightly higher entry? meh.
Thanks, I’ll definitely look into that! 
I got this one and TA of stock trends by Robert Edwards but was wondering if there’s something people in here find exceptionally useful for understanding charts. 
That's my first thought too. I'm from the US.
Thank you for the detailed info!
In December I was pulling 1-4% daily with doge. I doubt it's that way now, but it was awesome at the time.
I have no idea. For example, for poloniex or bitfinex, can you import funding?
In the US, you can use poloniex and Bitfinex.

However, be aware that if you want to provide funding on Bitfinex, you need to create a corporation or LLC because Bitfinex only allows US institutional accounts. Source: I have a verified US corporate account on bitfinex
deleted comment I’m gonna stop looking at charts for now 
People need to understand the trading metagame. If the "obvious" stop is 5% below current support, place it at 10% , and so on
Or just don’t use any stops at all and stare at the charts all day long 
Yesterday i longed 7950 and set SL@7935 because it was a risk trade and i thought the support would hold. Of course it dropped to 7910 and went up :)
Almost made it so my entry was really good, at least i'm getting better at choosing my battles 
why would you want to put a stop 7% above your current position? you have basically already taken too much losses and will only make it official by setting a stop like that. unless you are a position trader with a month long target or something.
8400 would require some serious volume IMO. We’re all used to the fakeout by now.
You might be right, 8.1k doesnt look like it wants to break yet.
Bounce off the neckline do you mean?
The only decoupling that will happen if Bitcoin reaches 11600 is alt ratios being slaughtered. It's happened before, and it will happen again most likely.
Your a smart guy and know better than to put all alts into the worthless bucket. Many, yes
All, no.
[deleted]
Got stopped out, I thought the stop loss below 3 days of candles would be enough but this time it was not :D  But the biggest problem is lack of patience as usual. aH well
Good points, there are too few points of contact on the bottom I guess. Maybe I was just looking too hard. 
+1. I stopped stressing about getting back in after buying some at $6900 and then the rest around $7850. Bought some alts so now I am up over 20% in SATs so that will serve as a hedge in the event bitcoin goes back down below $7K which I don't think it will. I am long and would only consider selling if we go below $6800 which I don't think it will. 
What he said.
Can't imagine not becoming a multimillionaire from hodling Bitcoin. It's my inalienable right and an assured inevitability. 
Told ya
Looks like he pissed em both off.
He is trolling every time he does this. lol
Sometimes he drops an /s. Not sure if it's the case this time, but I'd guess that it is.

Why would the current retracement invalidate a bullish scenario? 


Retracements were also present in the bull run of last year and can be found even in the most bullish of charts. I am not saying this is the reversal but dismissing an upswing like this after a small retracement is foolish. As long as we stay above $6500 a bullish scenario is in play.  

We had a 25% increase in merely 4 days with hardly any retracement on the way up. So now that we've dropped roughly 7% the permabears are back and prematurely spouting I-told-you-so's and "bulls never learn". Some of you guys are really stuck in your bias.

We're $180 down and it's the end for the bulls?

1k down then yeah, absolutely.
I hope you guys are kidding. Usually cycle is 9 days up, 4 days down. Or if you're not joking short the hell out of the market. Place your money where your mouth is.
do you mean we clearly barted from 8100 or we're barting now?

Also, just go back a few weeks to find the most textbook h&s 
https://www.tradingview.com/x/U0yCWgXB/


The first half of that red candle finished the previous bart, the second half begins the next potential inverted one.
you are wrong. someone probably spent over 0.5bn to buy 440k of bch. https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin%20cash/address/19hZx234vNtLazfx5J2bxHsiWEmeYE8a7k

i'd not be surprised if the same is tried for btc.
*bull*shitting... interesting 
dyor, this is not some random guy.
It's more than 1%.

17 million BTC mined

.17 million BTC is 1%

Consider the fact that maybe 20-30% of those 16 million BTC (remember Satoshi has 1M coins) are unspendable... this is just total bullshit.
Yeah. Price is too low - it is impossible to move a billion or so into crypto. The float just does not allow it given current valuations.

Agreed. Sorry for shitting on your comment. I can't tell if this is good or bad for bitcoin. Obviously it's bad for some but this could take away the bad money laundering stigma that localbitcoins brings.
No, I don't see btc specifically as the solution to the wealth distribution problem - it is far too concentrated - but I see the path we are on with it as a huge part of the solution. Currency control should not be in the hands of bankers; in fact, the rules and any changes to them are far too important to be in the hands of any small group, including software developers.

Price's model can fairly describe the 'rich get richer' phenomenon when you have a culture and economic system based on hierarchy; so sure, it works within a certain set of constraints. But it need not be like this and it is no more natural law than the political science that we call mainstream economics.
Never let the feds in on your long con :D

Na, she played golf at the same golf club as my parents. I went there when I visited them and saw her there.

No we don't? Unless you correct for inflation, then you are correct.

As far as I'm aware, negative interest rates is definitely an idea floated by the banks, but it is still only an idea. 
In these doomsday preppers TV shows you always see people with guns and underground shelters and canned food, but you never see someone with a solar powered Linux server with a torrent client, Bitcoin and a backup of Wikipedia.
Someone like Peter Thiel wouldn't have to prep if his country went to shit. He's all set. It's the 99% who would need to prep.
I mean opening shorts in 7.9 range when there is too much resistance at 7.8. Not much room for profit. I'd say rather risky.

I think successful shorters opened their positions in 8.3 range. 
Bitmex?
Maybe ... maybe just some alts closer to breaking   above log down trend. They may fall yet, but it doesn’t feel like it, and if not then alt season is almost certainly on imo
Close my short an opened a long. I need to just stick to a god damn position. 
I wouldn't mind that. I think 7800 will hold and have some bids there. 
I think it's more likely to break up, barring anything Gox-like. I would be prepared for it to go either way, though. Even in the stock market  bull pennants can break down. When you get to the end of patterns like this you need to wait for confirmation. One could argue that there's some time left (a month or so), but the last big one like this broke early as well. That was the one that got Goxed.

Breaking up does not mean we'll enter new ATH territory, BTW. We could easily break out of this pennant into a longer term pennant.
You can kind of estimate it by the trading volume I assume
There are engines on internet that estimate the popularity of web sites. Just Google it.
We are below it on my chart. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/lGACWmrH/

Idk how you're drawing it?
Did you keep your short from 8.3 or have you closed it?

I added at 7.7, 8.0 and 8,030. So I'm primed for some selling.
Why would a push back to 8.1 not be considered bullish? Because we couldn't break it meaningfully the first few times?
One thing to keep in mind in regards to that line is that there's no question that it will ultimately break. 

Could be here. Could be in the $6,000s. Could be in the $3,000s. And yes, it could technically be lower.

Your goal should really be to secure both of the following positions:

1. Enter a large short above the resistance line. This requires entering a short below the resistance line and waiting for the line to gradually descend below your entry. This is what I'm hoping for with my current position.

2. Close your short and enter a long just after the line breaks to the upside.

This will allow you to weather the remainder of the bear storm as low as it might take the market, and also capitalize on the ensuing trend reversal that breaking above that line should usher in.
A few weeks ago I expected us to be on the other side of that old support line meeting the downtrend due to the indecision to form a big ass triangle. That we broke it so decisively and have now rattled off against it makes me think this market still cheats bearish. At any rate, as we've talked about that sweet ~8400 entry for a short, I can feel confident putting tight stops on that whenever it comes, knowing if it breaks, it ought to get fairly bullish fairly quickly from at least the traders in the market, if not mainstream retail. 
While this looks like a short lived bump, how far historically does it retract after? Losing has more impact than gaining, so spotting the top is just as important. How confident are you about spotting the peak?
I'm not down on BTC, I'm just averse to screwing with your 401k.  It may work out great for them....just doesn't seem like a wise move at face value though.
I think he's more so talking about taking a loan out for crypto.

Oh that's rich.
After googling "barmy", I can say that I concur. 
Thanks, I’ve set one.
Right, that's possible. That's the part that would have to be backtested to see if your theory holds.

I may do something with it, if I do it would be in Pine in TradingView. It'll be a few days minimum before I get to it, and if I (eventually) do I'll post a chart here.

Good idea.
Ah, my mistake.
Notice also that the buying volume has started to pick up after that candle. I do not see this as mere coincidence.
It was a very high volume red 1-minute candle that had very long wicks on both sides (long-legged doji). We were descending for a few minutes before it, which suggests to me that someone tried to dump and push it down, but they failed as someone else just as big bought, but then they *also* failed to push it up. The order of events could be reversed here, because I haven't seen the order book to know what happened, but, the next 1-minute candle was a bullish engulfing candle on low volume again, which suggested to me that the seller gave up, at least for the time being. 

I don't know how long the effect will be but it was enough to scare me out of position.

Edit: Bullish engulfing candle not including the wicks, which may not be technically correct.
Well, thanks for posting it.

It was good that I closed out my short but now I wish I would've had enough conviction to go long with it. Lesson learned I guess.

Edit: I would have missed it for sure if you hadn't posted it; I almost never look at the 1-min chart.
I'm just talking price. :)

yea man.... and I was about to throw 35k into new skins too.  Deal got held up while negotiating and BAM that update hit... so I sorta got lucky.  Only about 10k in skins atm.
This is just my opinion but from what ive seen things have gotten like a god damn dystpoia, im seeing so many things getting removed and a couple bans i just dont agree with, it is what it is tho
We're giving temp bans pretty much the second someone has three rule violations that resulted in post removal. You're at 2, by the way... ;)

I do try to tell people when I've removed their post and why, but some days that's just not possible.
Yea nice.  If need be, you could always get back into things on limited budget and without margin.  Helps manage losses until you're feeling confident.  I'm kind of shit in bear markets, so I make very few trades, all non margin, and on limited budget... and I never short the corn.  Just my personal rules atm.  It's been successful I'd say, cuz I've been hella wrong multiple times and I'd say I'm down a max of ~5%.
Had two really good short entries, did not take profits and got stopped bi wild pumps. Don't feel comfortable trading this at all. Too many mixed signals

What kind of retarded sarcastic bulltard thinks we're going to hit ATH with complete lack of interest by anyone outside the gambling addicts and long term hodlers just because shorts cover. 

Ps. covering a short doesn't result in more Bitcoin bought than was originally sold. 
Where would you hedge? 
Yes this.



Also I'm probably gonna sell if it goes under 7.8k (because I think we would go further down from there, with buy target at 7.3k or so). If we go up, I'll have to see when I'll take profits, but it will probably be at the resistance.
Thanks. Makes sense.

Big green dildo = green candle = upwards movement in price
how can you say this? I just posted my chart here and you can see that we broke it \(not only touched it\)...

I connected the ATH and the second 17k DCB top with each other... that was the original line people were speaking about.

show me your chart.

Also: you can see that the volume is going down more and more down. This is what I read about volume on investopedia: " A rising market should see rising volume. Buyers require increasing numbers and increasing enthusiasm in order to keep pushing prices higher. Increasing price and decreasing volume show lack of interest, and this is a warning of a potential [reversal](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reversal.asp). This can be hard to wrap your mind around, but the simple fact is that a price drop \(or rise\) on little volume is not a strong signal. A price drop \(or rise\) on large volume is a stronger signal that something in the stock has fundamentally"

I have us right above the resistance now, shorting here is too much of a risk for me. Either above 8300-8400 or below 8100 no? 
There was hardly any buying either before this little 'natural' pump came along.
Yes, but it will need to rise for people to not start opening shorts
yeah, looking like up is the way. May bail on my short here using limit orders and add again.
I snagged a small long add at 7680. Not sure if I'm happy about that yet. 
Yes just noticed that, crazy.
I think some people use high non-cross leverage as a forced stop.


Actually, after looking at the trollbox I realize I was being overly generous.  
Everyone's on 50x to 100x and they sound like they're going crazy.
> Selenite can evoke protection from the angelic realm and also dispels negative energy.

Cool.


If we can break above the log resistance and maintain it for a day or so, then that would be huge. After that we have to worry about the Moving Averages and historical resistances, but our chances of breaking those rises greatly if we can hold above the log resistance. 
Yeah there's less than 10 BTC changing hands on that period so probs just small sized buy/sell orders colliding on low volume. Wouldn't look into it too much. 
iirc, those flat candles are a registered trademark of spoofy.

Whatever algorithm spoofy runs on likes to induce a few flat candles before unleashing its chaos.

It's actually been a long time since I've seen that at work, but it's definitely been back in action for the past week or so.
Big Green/Red Dildo
The above scenario was sort of a joke, but it's actually not a terrible play for someone looking to step away from trading. The 20x 5% short at the resistance line (8720ish currently) liquidates around 9150, which is a clear breaking of the downtrend line. The longs don't liquidate until 3100, which would be pretty dire indeed. A 10% 10x short at 8400 would server basically the same purpose, and have a much better chance of executing. The risk in my joke scenario is dumping <3100 without holding the 20x short from 8750.
If you add up to the same dollar amount, you're basically just short from 8350, which is still a great entry. The rest is psychological. 
2014 must have been torture with all the bull traps and the false hope of recovery. Lots of people probably thought it was literally, actually dying. 



I hope I don't have to go through that.

Sounds like you're you're the one reading tea leaves if you're so sure BTC will follow SP500 movement this time around.
economic instability? Following the global markets 
This may not be a popular opinion around here, but typical TA will only take you so far in this market. Don't get me wrong, it's important to learn it and have an understanding of it; but then you have to go beyond the indicators that others are using or you will have no edge.

A lot of people just look for the pattern and then trade on that, without paying enough attention to secondary indicators like volume and what that really means. But because this is a whale-dominated market and the whales are typically exchanges or individuals rather than money managers or ETFs, it's important to understand what it is that they are trying to do when they buy/sell/short. The fact that some folks on this sub belittle that effort because it's not 'real TA' truly puzzles me.
Definitely. I was trying to time every single up and down as well lately and realized i’m just being foolish at this point. Going to reduce to a few trades a week as well, and mainly just put my faith in the long term hold.
He's just salty.
Thanks. 
Good point. Canceled the stop at 8250. I'll just fomo in if it breaks that level and sustains.

GDAX is great for their $0 fee limit orders
Yup! I do love RH for stocks though, so it will still be good to get on the waiting list. Once the volume improves and they get more people on it i’m hoping the limits for crypto will truly be free. It is really fun to trade on still and seeing your portfolio value going up. I’ve been with Robinhood since 2014 and was one of the first thousand users, i really support them and how they changed up the entire commission game in the financial markets.

I actually started the sub r/rhcrypto. Would love to have you join! Unfortunately the original robinhood subreddit still hates crypto, and the crypto subs don’t like robinhood. 

Take care man! Happy trading :)
My entire point is that those questions are unanswerable. You can't prove or even provide quantifiable evidence for anything you said, making it no more than a pipe dream.

The people selling 250 BTC at this price are probably taking a much longer term view of the market than the past 15 minutes so no, they probably don't regret their decision. To them, the short time scale is just noise and the risk/reward to them favors selling. They probably recognize the risk of the market going up above whatever resistance level they're eyeing and made a risk management decision to sell a portion in case we get rejected. 15 minutes to them doesn't matter jack.

Yesterday 30,000 BTC was traded on *one* exchange (BFX). And that was actually relatively low volume. And you're trying to make macro market conclusions based on a 15 min time frame where a measly 250 BTC are sold? Why?
mandy7 sounds relaxed.  When you post predictions based on thin air they're going to get picked apart.  I'm glad they were.  Even if more analytical predictions were made, it's still good to have someone pick them apart to make sure emotion and myopia weren't at play.
So then what do you call the mega green candle from 6800?
> Bear whales becoming increasingly desperate and ineffective as supply dries up.

True. I am waiting for the bull whales to come, as the current price is still good provided we are heading to 10k by month's end, that would yield 20% easy.
I did not check that... I still have the spreadsheet... I'll check after work tonight

then you should withdraw your coins from the exchange
It's when the daily candle closes.

Not sure how valid these points are but:  So either it's people rushing to help the chart paint what they think it's destined to look like.  Or it's whales forcing the price in a direction  to paint the chart.  I think there are bots too that react to candles closing and daily is significant.

Also, confirmation bias to the extreme.  I bet you could probably statistically prove it as (in)significant as  another candle time frame closing.
Daily close can be highly volatile relative to the surrounding hours, presumably due to whales painting candles to favour their positions. 
Understood.. thanks
fair point.
So why wouldn’t you short here? Im pretty confident in my short from 8140 
Nobody ever says it works everytime, use it with good FA, and increase your chances. Your comment is based on a wishy washy conspiracy theory
Hope so! This was a tough short to hold when it ran up to 8400 lol... glad to see it in profit now. 
I like you.

>I'm providing the best-case Bull scenario.

No, you aren't. You're providing moonkid fever dreams that you openly admit are derived from feels > reals. If you want me to address your points, start by making some. 
That assumes that this tech will not just fail like thousands of ideas have before. I'm not saying it will fail (or else I wouldn't be here, so obviously I believe in it) but you shouldn't be 100% sure that it will succeed because there is no guarantee of that.
Thing is, what benefits are these? To clarify, I know that Bitcoin has benefits. I genuinely do support the concept, but equally I really can't see your average person caring other than to make "mad gains". 

Lightning network is interesting but flawed in more ways than I can count and not even remotely user friendly. Not to mention that Bitcoin's capacity is still pretty damn poor compared to other payment methods and truth be told I suspect many of the issues that people have with current payment methods will be resolved by increased globalisation.
Also, i forgot, using trend analysis you can see that there has been barely any rejection when rsi hit overbought conditions, so thats a really strong bull signal.
They did the same in the way down. Alt holders have adamantine hands
The question is however whether this is one hell of a fakeout like when we pumped on that huge green candle
Here's what I'm seeing on the 4H for GDAX.

I wasn't trying to be a dick at all. That is just my thought.

What leverage were you using? That stop is super close to your buyin
4h support was at ~7850 so shoulda put it there
You can exit manually if you need to. I usually keep stops for big moves while I’m asleep. I highly doubt we pump to 8600 in an 8 hour time frame 
you're probably right, i'm actually targeting 8200-8300 
yeah
I mean.... I have my picks for technical reasons, but other than Monero and ETH, none of the alts are actually used for anything at all.

Just based on the tech, my list is

Bitcoin, Lightning
Ethereum/ETC, Cardano
Monero
Stellar
There has not been one drop where BTC performed worse than any alt
Oh please.

Name one alt and tell me what I can do with it.

And don’t come at me with this Snart Contract bullshit. Give me one real use case

At least I can use BTC to top up my Bitpay CC, or to buy some drugs on the internet, or to pay for my VPN, or to buy some shit using LN.

I can do some of those things with ETH.

On ETH I can gamble on Etheroll and buy crypto citties to place on my mantle next to my fedora collection.

Anything else?
I'm still breathing underwater, have my stop bellow 7800 because that was where it stopped last time. So far it is behaving just like April 13. Same start point, same slowdown point, so my last hope is the same bounce point @7820 
Stop being a sarcastic smart ass. It's like the 5th time today I've seen this from you. There's nothing wrong with believing price will go up long term. Nowhere did they say this was their inalienable right as a holder or trader... no where did they say they'd become a multimillionaire. Not like they said "100k EOY is a 100% certainty".. If they did I'd say your comment was justified.. 
Oohh lol. Ok. Damn i’m way to serious lately i gotta lighten up
It's funny, because in previous days you can find comments about people saying how they'd be more bullish if we retraced and tested the mid 7ks and came back up, setting that as a higher low since 6.8k.
It’s all projection. Finding reason to justify their own desires.
$500 down, but yeah, doesn't mean this can't retrace a bit in the short term at least.
I agree — let’s be reasonable. Some posters in here can be so dramatic.

I’m fairly new here but consider 2% at this point mostly noise. 
Uhh... where are you getting that cycle from? Not true at all in this bear market.
I don't consider that a h&s to be fair. Too different shoulders and head is almost the same as right shoulder.

It could be someone or a group of people just moving their BCH to that address (many have speculated it could be Jihan / Bitmain).
440k bch is worth 10% of the same amount in Bitcoin.

And I'll bet you whatever you want that was not bought using fiat, but using BTC.

Also, there are idiots all over the place. This guy was probably some big blocker, not a hedge fund

That does not make any sense.

ofc not. If it falls to 6k level (veggie sub), Bulls will have a feast.
What? Nobody remembers you or your BCH comments.
No.  Back in your cage. 
It also takes away the chance for those of us not in the US to avoid the ridiculous fees of transferring back to fiat in European countries. Some of the banks and exchanges charge extortionate fees and local bitcoins was a great way to buy or sell using bank transfers within your own country.  I suppose it doesn’t take away that facility with kyc but I also hate having to give the kyc details required by some of the exchanges away.  It makes me really uncomfortable sending passport details and photos to any entity. My address proof and bank account number should be enough 
Heh, don't play holes...
Okay I see, wow. Hope you get some good luck on the next swing.
Retail bank deposits do not have negative interest rates. But that’s not what I mean. When you deposit to a bank, you are getting paid because the bank mobilizes your capital.

I’m talking about Interbank rates

they will bleed think if BTC breaks the log at 88-91..
I know the feeling. Closed two shorts today. One by accident 
Been building a long today. Hoping for a fakeout to fill some bids. 
alexa.com. There is also other indicators. For example, bitfinex lowered their minimum capital requirements from $10k to $1k, which is a sign of them having to be less choosy due to decreased interest.
We are below it. Scratch that. 

Baby bear flag on the 5 minute too. 


I still have it open and have no intentions of closing it unless the market breaks $8,300 again. 
Banging your head against a wall over and over again isn't super impressive until you break through the wall.

There's nothing particularly bullish about revisiting a previous resistance level. If buyers push through the $8,000 to $8,400 resistance zone, then that's a different story.
Last night there was around 1.5k in buys and it only moved the needle by 2% max. Wasn't an iceberg order either so the buying is running out for sure.

The sell an hour ago was 1.2k and dropped the market 2%. I don't see any news on the horizon to move the needle further up but I don't see anything specific to move it down either.

That said, takes less to scare people than to get them to come back in given where we are.
Interesting. Thanks for the insight. It seems like this scenario is a straight hedge short. I have nothing to hedge, though, except the actual trading stack. I'm sure everyone not already short is looking to enter short above 8300, but I'm wondering if we're going to get there again before we break that line. If the goal is a large short position, opening $600 below the line (here) feels unwise. $300 below falls much closer to risk tolerances.

Additionally, since I have no cold storage, even $300 below is a tough pill to swallow. Layering into one is the most appealing option to me, but that leaves me with a high probability of only getting 10%-20% of my desired position size open before a major drop. This is the quandary I find myself in.

I have a small long open from 6410 and a slightly larger one from 7920 currently (on Sep and Jun futures, respectively), but both only add up to 15% of my trading stack. Stops on the June future below 7800.

Thank you for taking the time to share this
Interesting to see the next 4 hr candle
No-one using would be bad
Bear. If BTC is not being used, that's not good. And that's a cold hard fact.
There's some question as to whether OP identifies as male or female (not that it matters either way as far as this particular discussion is concerned). But "he" might not be the preferred pronoun in this context. 

Anyhow, bull flags and pennants have an inherent bullish bias. While they don't always complete to the upside, they do break up more often than they break down in a bull trend. Which, despite the medium-term bear trend, there's still a strong argument to be made that the long-term trend is very much bullish.

So, to make a short story long...yes.
I actually don't know, and it's fairly misogynistic of me to assume an anonymous user is male instead of female. 

I'll change to he/she and try to be more mindful of that in the future.

Thanks for pointing that out!
Whoa, this spawned quite the discussion. :D Women in bitcoin do tend to be pretty outnumbered. I've never had much of a problem, but I've tried to be at least a little circumspect.
230K is life changing money for just about everybody on this planet even if you're a multimillionaire. 
I guess it depends where you live. 

With your housing prices, i guess no.
Damn you lucky. All my skins I was holding for various reasons got melted and lost over $40k. So it goes my friend, so it goes!
[removed]
Haha, I hold a bearish bias, and made a killing shorting (i.e. had a great March). I may drop margin, but I'd probably rather just paper trade if I'm going to do anything during this time. 
They've all got plenty of customers in New York, that's why. To me this just shows New York gov being ahead of other states that aren't getting involved.   And I'd rather see stuff happening at the state level and see the feds follow suit than the other way around. 
It's almost as if there could be other possibilities than zero and ATH in the near term. Crazy!
I hedged just now. Going to keep an eye on this one, but seems like good risk/reward
We need to break through on high volume to confirm
I don't consider that a breakout. maybe a failed breakout. By breakout i don't mean going a little over the line but breaking it by 10-15% on high volume. Lines are not religious so i'd not obsess over them.

I also do not take volume in bitcoin in consideration. it is different in the stock market because the stocks are only exchanged through the stock market though there are different brokers. So the volume is the volume. This is not the case for bitcoin so there are no reliable sources for volume (ie: the volume could be higher now but we have no idea about it)
yeah, makes sense. Imm up quite a bit from yesterday’s action, so thinking of shorting and setting stops. My profit from yesterday gives me room to breathe

missed your 20x short edit before my comment, interesting setup. I use kraken so those options aren't available to me but maybe I should sign up for bitmex.....is this how it ends?
Had a short from 8105, got excited when we dropped to 8050 but the way that bounce was absorbed spooked me. Closed my short with enough to cover fees. It's a weird region to make a long-term play - below 7.9 keeps getting rejected but so does anything above 8.2. 

8.4 seems like it might be a place to make a decision - whether we retrace and explore the 7k range or keep on going and break through 9. 
Yeah, just mad at myself that I could be sitting comfortably with a better R/R and wouldn't have to deal with my emotions when I see green candles.
Oh indeed it was. I became so hardened I forgot my goal was to aquire btc for the future not just  dollar profits on individual trades and ended up trading away 26 coins!!! I try not to think about that.
Ah, for the sake of their portfolios?

Edit: downvotes for these questions? r/bitcoinmarkets has turned strange these past years.
yeah, I doubt it would just shoot roght on up to the moon
Thanks man
We have no vegeta but we have british piccolo ready for some action. 
Mate I opened a long @ 8000 about two days ago. It is still open and I am not playing with any emotions neither am I making predictions based on thin air.

Being an average Joe trader, whatever was said above, went over my head. If I were to be such an experienced trader as the person you are referring to, I would rather be trading in FTSE 500 companies like Google and Amazon.

My predictions are solely based on my understanding of this market and my past experiences with it. Perhaps it is my strategy and I am being continuously successful with it, so why should I care about things I do not understand.

I am a successful trader, I trade based on market trends, consumer behavior and as said above, most importantly my past experiences with the market.  

I hate criticism!

How do you create this copy ?
I only have a small amount on there, I have most of the goods in cold storage.
You ever re open your short? Or are you holding off 
I don't do margin trading. I only trade with limits on GDAX. 
Right now FA and TA doesn't work on bicoin anymore, so wishy washy is best I got. Anyway, I don't trade bitcoin anymore for this reason, alts are much more profitable and safer right now.
Nice trade man, i'm dying to get back on the books... been stuck studying for some exams these last few days
The quote is actually "No, I am your father."
Cryptocurrency supplants fiat currency by 2050.

Sorry I don't have a chart that stretches that far out.
I think it's fair to say most predictions that stretch 40 years out rely on numerous bold assumptions.   
Most have bounced 75%-100% already and are at resistance levels from before the last big leg down, there will be some profit taking eventually. Stupid not to do IMO, unless you just want to hold. 
Yeah, even with this BGD, I have absolutely no idea what to do. Is this a bull run? Dead cat bounce? I don't have the first clue. I'm staying out of position. 


Also, what do you make of the low volume on this pump?
I’m confusing myself, this should break up correct? Or should it break down if you go by the books

I also thought it might be interest income and be treated like a loan. However in that case you are supposed to know personal info from the borrower which is not possible in my situation.
Under the 'Income' tab and the Import Income section, there is a button for Poloniex as well as one for a CSV. I don't see something specifically for Bitfinex.
I know you weren’t sorry if the comment came off with a bit of sass. You’re just putting in your input and I appreciate it 
5x, not worried about getting liquidated, just didnt want to lose much 
That would put me at almost 2% loss. I just wanted to risk 1% because the expected profit was low 
Bitcoin - Hold my beer 
ok, thats different then, more like a "catastrophic stop". been reminding myself to use those too, after the BGD event.
Yeah thinking i will close my short around there and reopen if we see a bounce, unless we go straight through it. Anyone's guess.

You're mostly right, with the exception of January. Eth and others hit ATHs while BTC tanked.
[removed]
OK I'll bite. If you're buying drugs on the internet, why not use Monero?
One example; VeChain. Was under 1 dollar in december and was still up 100% when btc went down. No use case? All i can tell is DYOR ;). VeChain is getting REAL life adoption by big companies. But stay in your bitcoin bubble dream =)
You can have Monero to exit scam from ICOS and move eth there. Joking.

I completely agree with you dude. Alts are very far from adoption (bitcoin is a bit closer).

Im serious friend
Easy to be crabby today with taxes due. That suuuucccckkkedd.

Side note, was in Nashville this weekend, underrated city. Spent. 5 btc, but it was damn fun. 
Methinks you are missing the subtle yet notorious why-are-you-afraid irony.
Do you call bear market from 19k to now or this WXY correction period? 
Doesn't matter, shoulders don't have to be symmetrical for the pattern to be valid. Volume is the best tool available to confirm. Don't have it on the chart though, but feel free to check.

But people want to move large amounts in if you read (and trust) the tweet.
Yes you are correct, as someone quoted above, it should be the other way around.

>It is so strange to see shorts rising when price is falling. It should be opposite. So many bad entrance points in my eyes.
Everything is saying up, but I’m feeling down.

Don’t want to miss the chance for a short above 8K if shit hits the fan.

Are u currently in position? 
What’s ur DCA? 
I would be careful with identifying bear/bull flags, especially on that low of a timescale. Recently we have seen a lot of flags play in either direction, so i guess just watch for that is what i mean :D
Flags wave the opposite direction of the pole. ...like a flag. I'm not sure what it's been doing recently (like it is here), but it's not really a flag. 
nope, not a good idea. If someone asked to take out a loan to buy "Facebook or Tesla low" I'd say the same thing. No dough, no show. 
"It's not a bubble..."
That won't do much for them if bitcoin goes thru a longer bear market. This isn't my current sentiment, but why would you take out a loan regardless of the rate to put into crypto? Just seems like you're asking for it at that point.
"make a short story long". Nice.

Damn... EZ come ez go, or so I tell myself!
OK, dude, that's rule 3! I don't really want to ban you... I hate banning people, even temporarily.
The OP posted the accurate number 8.7k, if this is a flex number we can also say we need to go to 9k to break it. The last time the line was sitting at 11.4k and we went to 11.72k...
You made good profit yesterday?  Fair play.
Are you fully hedged from 8160?
Would you mind giving a little detail as to why ripple isn't a good choice for you? Points other than personal bias would be perfect. Thinkin of buying some myself 
And I didn't know that lol. Ripple bust the nuts. 
Come to the dark side. We have cookies.  

By cookies, I mean "order cannot process. system is overloaded"  

Kraken maxes out at 5x? I mean, you could to 40%/40%/20%. You could close that 20% 5x hedge over 9200 since liquidation from 8400 is over 10K. 
If we hit 8400 again in the next day or two, it's a must-short IMO. The similarities to the 7400-9100 double top (3/18-3/24), proximity to the ATH downtrend, and sitting under the log support-turned-resistance is too juicy: https://www.tradingview.com/x/RQMIbEVi/  

This is my optimal target: https://www.tradingview.com/x/nVmTXDIw/ 
We all make mistakes. I hope you managed to recover.


Here's my big mistake: I bought at 17k and have continued to hold until now.
Lol mate you and your words. Btw what kinda organic compound is it, your handle?
If you hate criticism don’t post online. 
well you need to provide ID as well, but on some exchanges they dont take kyc at first so it's funny how that works out =/


You’ll have to send them a selfie with a passport etc

I reopened it at 8127, but I accidentally closed it when I wanted to close my stop... lol

right before this little dumparino. No biggie, not worried for now. Lost 80 bucks though...
You may be right on short term trades, but do yourself a favor and zoom out... https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8bnetl/comment/dx9q51e?st=JG43W1DH&sh=8ad34f82
People are taking profit. See those giant red candles in middle of pumps? Altcoins have more holders compared to bitcoin which is mostly traded, shorted/longed or bought to buy alts. The general direction is up, alts are leading the bull market this time, BTC plays the catch up game. Remember that giant green candle? Popped up after alts were going up. 
Do I have to remind you the market cap of verge and Tron? Or ripple...
What you drew is a descending wedge, a bullish formation. A descending triangle has a horizontal support line and is a bearish formation.
lower leverage or dont enter. entering and putting stop so close is gambling
the play yesterday was to just scale in a long down to 4hr support and close it if support broke. u got in too hard too fast
Which is why I have the stop
That's why i like going > X50 leverage.
No stops can save your ass then.
same. trading is a lot of guessing anyways ;)
tps is a shitty metric though.

Most dnms and merchants still don’t accept Monero.
Also, VeChain dumped hard when BTC tanked. The ratio got slaughtered
lol

VeChain is the future. Of course it is. Real adoption! totally! Let’s put all our True Religion Trousers on the blockchain so we can all prove we overpaid for it.

I had VeChain last year. I sold in Jan. I’ll be fine in my Bitcoin bubble dream. Been dreaming since 2011 ;)
I dont think alts are total garbage, at least in terms lf technology. I just think Bitcoin is better. Maybe alts find their niche adoption, like Monero is looking to do. But I can’t put a substantial amount of money into something I feel is worthless

I don't do much EW stuff so not going to comment on it. But yes, I would say so far that 19k to now is a bear market.

I'm just more commenting that that 9-4 rule of yours just hasn't worked since 19k.
Think, we could be on the cusp of completing our first 1k marge, it would be amazing.
so do a market buy then
hodling, after I accidentally market closed, shit hit the fan
8070ish on Sept futs.  So I guess that's 8100ish on spot. 

Too bad I missed that red wick today, was before I had any limits set. When I saw that I decided to take a shower and think on doing a market buy, but it already bounced back by the time I got out. 

Edit, that's the current dca.  Will take the dca down as far as I can of course. Under 7800 I'll reevaluate. 
probably part of a larger one on a higher time frame?

I was actually referring to how I turned a one-word answer into a multi paragraph one. 

However, it does also work as "to make a bearish story bullish."
Perhaps misogynistic is a bit of a stretch, but it's at least a bit insensitive. 
It's really not relevant or necessary to speculate. 
While "they" may be preferable in a cultural sense, I have a hard time standing behind it from a grammatical sense. 

(s)he or he/she are more grammatically correct, but are cumbersome to write and read. 

Would be nice to see Ze or Hir gain more popularity in literary circles.
If I were a woman on Reddit, I don't think I'd want to either confirm or deny that fact. 

The general consensus from any female redditor I've spoken to is that revealing their gender ultimately resulted in this: https://imgur.com/gallery/QgJUL
Here in the Midwest USA, 230k would pay off your mortgage, cars, and student loan debt, and probably give you spending money on top of that. Not "lifestyles of the rich and famous" life-changing, but still what many would consider a very positive change in fortune.
I just do the Wild and scream out RIP SKINS. XDD

3! = 6


OBJECTION!

I was stating that I like shitposting along with the meme, and therefore was not solely comprised of dank maymay
more like 9.5k but that's early. let's test it first.
Yeah, the price is now above where I closed my short, so I have room until 8350 (I opened my short at 8250 on June Futures)
No I am not. And now there is some type of funky upward slanting bull flag that we have been seeing recently on the 5/15 minute ( If u cut the wicks ) 
First is the fact that a lot of people buy it thinking that its going to be the next bitcoin and go to 20k, because its worth so litlle.

Dont cry for the stupid, you know. 

But most important of all is that, in the ripple product, which is good, XRP is absolutely optional.A settlement layer. 

This is not exactly pullitzer writing but it gets the point across : 

https://hackernoon.com/4-alarming-reasons-ripple-might-not-be-what-you-think-9debc3c86985

Now, in traditional stocks, ripple must be an awesome risky buy, changes of getting a big bounty years later.
true. mostly the idea of doing any kind of long term strat freaks me out besides hodling in a bull market/hodling fiat in a bear/DCAing in between. I'll have to think on this. thanks. keep the cookies though :)
Wait let me rephrase, I once held 26 coins. Not all were losses. I spent many taking profits. I stopped trading at 590. All in long term hodler. I add to the stash every month. I too bought more at 17kish. Just wait. Someday a few millibits will carry the same power. I sound so old recounting war stories to the next gen. In bitcoin time moves fast.
Looks to be an explosive.  Cool looking molecule.

on BitMex I think they ask you a bunch of questions about your trade history. Therefore, its smart to export your trade history every now and then
Opened a short seconds before this little dump. Got excited but we rallied back pretty quickly, don't know what to think. Is Bart running out of coins?
I see the sideways movement as consolidation before a leg up, if that's what you're getting at
Nah dude red candles during pumps is not what to look for. The daily candle that's currently forming on Cardano is profit taking. It means the impulsive move has likely ended and consolidation is coming. 

I expect to see a green monster dildo on BTC as soon as it gets above ~8500 and holds, but that doesn't mean it's impossible to see a pullback first. Especially because alts are leading the market and they are so extended. Bear markets don't go from bear mode to bull mode in one move... A bounce this strong is sure to be followed by like a 30% - 50% retracement of that move. 

And seriously, I don't know where you got the idea that altcoins have more holders because every time BTC drops, the alts drop even harder. Many people just trade alts to get more BTC. 
You are right, it was pure gambling.

Dream added it a few months ago, afaik the most prolific DNM. DD vendors generally accept it--it is better suited for this purpose.

is surely an overstatement?

It really depends on situation. But bigger impulsive waves take 9-11 days, correction take 2-6 days. I'm not big on time analysis. But come on each wave up or down retraces 30-70% every time. This subreddit is meant for TA talk and people can't even understand that correction will always happen it doesn't mean market direction is changing. At least not yet.

I've got one at 7920 on June futs, but it's not a large position. I'm resisting the urge to add and ICA. Still have my 6410 on Sep futs haha. 
Trading on Margin assumes I don't need to take a loan to do it, IMO.
Just a happy little accident.
> I was actually referring to how I turned a one-word answer into a multi paragraph one. 

Isn't it what females does? haha.
"They" works perfectly fine in grammar. I use it as my go-to confidentiality pronoun when discussing clients. 
XD +1 to that
...uh-huh.
I just want to mention that the original downtrend line \(not the adjusted one, because we broke it once\) is sitting at 8.4k now. 
Once i colect profits i rather not risk it all. I also shorted 8300-8100 yesterday for a profit but lost some yesterday. Sitting on my hands or risk a scalp long if this line holds some more 
Yeah, I bailed on my short in the 8120s, so no biggie for now
great feedback thanks a lot. Didn't realize XRP was optional. Will do more research. 
8050 seems to be the short term support while 8088 was the short term support ( 15/30 min chart). We broke through the 8088 and bounced off the 8050. 8145 Seems to be the resistance ( short term ) if you don’t include the wicks. 
it’s impressive to say the least
"Many people just trade alts to get more BTC" That's where I think the general consensus is wrong. Maybe it was like this a year ago, but alts are getting more and more traction/adoption/publicity. With more fiat/USDT/stablecoin pairs, they are beginning to move independently from bitcoin. Many alt roadmaps have big things planned for 2018 and I think we'll have a thriving alt market. BTC is somewhat stagnating. IMO market is undergoing a paradigm shift from BTC to Alts. Time will only tell.
Incorrect. tps is completely irrelevant IMO. You can increase tps trivially on Bitcoin by bringing the the block times down and increasing the block size. Obviously, this has trade-offs in security, which is why it's a stupid metric to begin with.

A gossip protocol with a timestamp server will of course achieve higher tps, but has no security guarantees. Hence, these DAG coins just do the same stupid thing by adding PoW to it. It's not that innovative.
[removed]
Maybe an overstatement, I’m not a dnm expert tbh
Tell me the last time a parabolic advance was violated with a 70% correction while remaining a bull market?
[removed]
Impressive hold on the 6k Sept!  I finally let the last third of mine stop out just under 8k. Even though I trust 7.8 to hold, I decided I didn't want to end up taking profits in that area on a wicked SL. Had taken profits on it all the way up to 8.3 so no regrets. 

Since then only did a short that I bailed on with good timing at BE avoiding the recent green candle, losing the fees. 


What does ICA exactly stand for?  My Google Fu didn't suffice.  Yeah, I just couldn't resist getting into a position here!  Though it's way too small still. 


While most grammarians would agree with you, my own personal bias is that "they" implies more than 1 individual. 
Yeah man. Good luck with all your future ventures.
OK, dude, thats rule 3; if we are all going to break it anyway and you don't want to ban anyone the clear solution is to just allow shitposting in the daily.
I agree with you, and posted a few days ago when we were at about $8400 that we were "right on" the *non-adjusted* downward trend line, while the adjusted one was still above.

I do think that "fake breakout" last time is a warning for this time to not get overly exuberant until the breakout is either very substantial or until it retests the log resistance as support (which unfortunately is also a rapidly decreasing trend line).
No, but seriously, as a stock company, its much more worth risk/reward to invest in their stocks. I don't know why you never heard anyone talking about that.
Now that´s some micromanaging of res/sup right there.
[removed]
I had a typo, should have been "add and ICA" -- increase cost average. Right now I'm just planning to hold unless we climb back to 8300, where I'll probably set a $300ish trailing stop on my long and layer short in this range: https://www.tradingview.com/x/KgIFD4XV/  


That's a strange stance to take while promoting odd new pronouns but hey you do what you like man. This is BitcoinMarkets anyway. 
You as well - Always wish the best to the OG's in it way before my time.
Haha, true! TBF I tend not to moderate downstream posts much at all. I just remove them if they're crap, usually after seeing a report, and don't make a note of it. If a fight breaks out then I'll actively moderate it.
Jus now starting to learn more about alts. Up until now I have been sticking wit btc eth and ltc. 

How do you feel about stellar? It seem pretty reasonable but not sure it can hang with the big dawgs.  
Sounds like a decent plan.
