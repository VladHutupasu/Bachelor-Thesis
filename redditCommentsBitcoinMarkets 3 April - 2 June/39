Note: In the time I spent putting this together we're trying to bounce off the 9.2ks, the highest of the support zones I mention here. Not super confident in it yet, would prefer a further bounce from even lower, but could be a good sign. Stops to buy back in with a slight profit from where I sold.

UPDATE: Bought in at 9150ish. Annoyed I didn't set low price alarms so I slept through the initial 90xx drop. Oh well.

UPDATE 2: Stopped out on that. Going to let the market figure out what it's doing for now. GDAX/BFX price difference is confusing as hell to me.

UPDATE 3: Taking my medicine and overtrading a bit, realized the log support mentioned below has, thus far, held. Feel like I let emotions get ahead of me on update 2. Back in, stops below the log line. Overall I'm up crypto stack wise since I sold so I'll take that as a small win.

Charting time! Cranked this out fast while trying to simultaneously watch the charts so forgive any errors or things I missed. Apologies for the wall of text, also wrote fast. Album:

First two images are the daily chart. Yellow arrows depict the major hidden bearish divergence forming. Hopefully the market's reaction to it won't be as bearish as the magnitude of it might imply and we manage to bounce off after a retrace somewhere.

I've also drawn the FIB levels from the ATH -> 6k. The main one I want to point out is the 0.786 level (actually 0.236 - drew it wrong) at 8.9k that could possibly provide support. It's also in the vicinity of the 9k horizontal resistance turned support.

The next chart simply shows the log support from the Sept crash to the 6k crash that we also wicked when we initially went back down to 7.2k. We then broke through it on our way to the 6ks, and bounced off the zone a little in the low 8ks before managing to reclaim it at the same time we broke the ATH log resistance. Immediately after that we tested it to confirm it as support again. That's currently hanging around the 9k zone as well. If we do fall past it I'll probably stop drawing it since that'd be support-turned-resistance-turned-support-turned-resistance which... lol. That's basically nothing.

Moving down,  I have the 4 hr chart which I've drawn the wedge on (now redrawn a million times). I'm especially skeptical of it after the most recent peak but I guess you could still draw it. Breaking down soon would have it breaking down around... 9.1k.

FIB levels with the 11.8k -> 6.4k movement also drawn on the 4 hr. Writing this I realize that I drew them opposite the direction they're supposed to be but the lines are the same. I'd like to point out that we bounced off the 0.786 FIB retracement as resistance, let's look to the 0.5 level for support at... 9.1k.

Bringing it all together, the hourly chart. The two boxes are where I expect to find support. Notice all the times I've mentioned low 9ks? That confluence (Sept-6k log support, multiple FIB levels, horizontal 9k resistance-turned-support, wedge bottom) should mean that that area, maybe even extending out to 9.2k, should be a good bounce location. The lower box is the horizontal support from when we broke the ATH downtrend. That should also provide good support. The tiny yellow arrows are the bear div I noticed leading up to this retrace.

Overall outlook: in fiat since 9.5k, looking to the lower 9k/uppermost 8k area to hold as support. If it manages to do so I'll buy back in there. Otherwise, hope that the mid 8K region holds strong post log ATH resistance breaking. If *that* doesn't hold, the hidden bear div that will be present on the daily will be looking awfully ugly.

If we manage to bounce in the lower 9ks (most likely scenario imo) I hope we continue consolidating in the 9ks for awhile. I didn't like that parabolic upswing, made me nervous and rightfully so. If we go down to the mid 8Ks and bounce I have the same sentiment, while if it goes lower I'll have to reevaluate then. It doesn't necessarily mean lower lows but that'd definitely be in the cards.
I had a dream that Apple payed Ireland the  back taxes they owe them in bitcoin and Ireland was dumping their coins. Like 17 billion worth. It makes no sense but that's what I get for reading about it before I went to bed and staring at btc charts all day.
Hello r/BitcoinMarkets! Some of you may remember that three and six months ago I made surveys looking at the demographics and opinions of crypto redditors and comparing the results across different subreddits as well as how the results have changed over time. Now, three months later, the cryptocurrency market has corrected very sharply. ***Has the user base changed throughout the correction?*** That's what this survey is going to try and find out!

**If you would like to fill in the survey, you can do that [here.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfhkUsvWO4xAHnXQ1kjOl9tvmubEw_NquQNb3gwCMQN7LJLVA/viewform?usp=sf_link)**

For those of you who haven't seen the results to my previous survey, you can see that [here.] (https://redd.it/848snp)

Live results of the new survey here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Xhw-pnaJrYZ_zizH46Sxz6hoccY4vfTstzz_MZ2ekaM/edit?usp=sharing

Thanks for your time!
Like clockwork, the opposing factions show up to beat their chests about how they saw this coming from a mile away. Yes, the market lacks liquidity, so big players can manipulate it from time to time. But the market was obviously overextended, and those traders who could see it made the appropriate moves. Some didn't, but what's the point of coming in to dogpile those people when they're at their lowest? It's just weak, low-effort, and childish. 
Kind of passing the point of a "healthy correction". 12% in one day is NOT a healthy correction. 

Feeling like I got pumped and dumped again, losing faith in crypto tbh.

On the bright side I'm still in my 25x short from 9k
[deleted]
I just looked at the recovery to 11.8k from Feb and I realized something that has me feeling bullish:

After we first dropped to 5.9, we meandered around 6k, then pumped to 7k, meandered in the 7-8k range and started a bullish reversal to 9k. We then dropped from 9k to 8k, and pumped back up to 10k, dropped to 9k, then 11.8, 9k, back 11.8k

Currently, we are experiencing our first (semi-) major pullback. If you draw a parallel to Feb, this would be equivalent to the 9k to 8k pullback. So even though we didn't make it past 10k, there is still plenty of room to go higher. This insight has me feelign that if we dont go retarded (pretty sure alt FOMOers learned a lesson they won't forget in 2weeks time), we may be on a steady path back up to the holy land.

I'm no permabull, I'm no permabear. I try to be realistic about Crypto and keep my expectations in a realistic territory. Let's just get to the moon this decade, it doesn't have to be this year.

Please be careful out there guys. Buy when everyone is screaming "To The core", sell when everyone is screaming "To the moon".


Closed my short at around $9,080. 

Edit: this could, and should, go lower. But I'm not going to be greedy. 

Edit: opened a long at $9,073. Stops below $8,800. 
An Infrequent PnF Update

The price rose to the down trend line from the most recent high in March.  This line is what I labeled the “last resistance” because the next resistance up from that line is the ALL TIME high resistance…and similar trend line down from the December ATH.

Both of these lines are going to be tough to cross.

One the down side, we blew through the breakdown point under $8,750.  This decline, while it seemed insane this morning, is really not that horrible.  At this stage the “worst case scenario” would drop the same number of boxes as the last decline—34 rows.  This would put the price target down at $8,000.  

Since it bounced pretty well this morning, I am thinking that is probably not going happen this time around.

All of this movement (the column in blue) is tentative until 12:00 UTC.  IF, it keeps going right back up to $9800, we will add a box and the whole movement will be moot. The downturn would never have happened on this chart.  It is rare, but that is why this is a swing trade chart, or at least a "set your targets" chart.  It is not a day trading chart.

I think if you look at the resistance line coming down from the upper left—and the support line coming up from the bottom right, those are usually the boundaries of the “pennant” or “flag.”

Lets be honest, the price went up like a rocket for a few days.  I was surprised at how quickly it went down—but not the fact that it did.

[Nasdaq is open to becoming cryptocurrency exchange, CEO says](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/25/nasdaq-is-open-to-becoming-cryptocurrency-exchange-ceo-says.html)


We now sit at an 8% retrace from the top. This is about what I thought *should* happen, but just hadn't come. It's good that it's taken 12 hours to drop this far rather than a single 8% 4h candle. There's no need to panic, yet. We have long-term log support below us in the 8720 range. Holding above there is key, IMO. Obviously, holding 9K as support would be good as well, but I'm not going to be shorting anymore unless 8700 falls. 

My last post last night was me bailing on my June futures long. I actually opened short at 9500 for the same amount as my Sept futures long from 6410, just to hedge profits. I closed that short out this morning, probably prematurely, at 9180.

We have a falling wedge forming off the top as well. A near perfect bullish scenario would be a continued bleed down to the log support line, followed by a break up out of the wedge: https://www.tradingview.com/x/MwMG3epE/  

Support line zoomed out: https://www.tradingview.com/x/VFi9KJJN/  

We're battling for 9K right now, and 89xx is being bought up with reckless abandon. 

I'm remaining out of position for now, aside from my Sept futures long. I will hold that until log support breaks. 

I will be looking to open long in the 88xx range this afternoon (4x with 2% stops), unless things move extremely rapidly. Otherwise, I'm watching from the sidelines. 

Good luck all.
In the current dip/dump, most alt ratios are actually higher than they were than when we bounced from 9200 earlier today from our daily high.

I assume the majority of traders have taken their profits from the last 2 weeks, with ratios not really moving much now. 

Overleveraged and overeager people who FOMO'd into a long position were punished hard, unfortunately, but if it were that easy everyone would be rich. Shorts aren't really increasing, but instead covering today. 

Coins will change hands, people will get shaken out. I honestly don't know how far this dip will go, but I've bought in using the remaining tether I have and sent those coins off to cold storage. No more leveraged trading for me, I haven't been burnt as hard as others but it's not because I was a good trader, I was just lucky. 

Good luck everyone. 
South Korean Company Nexon may have acquired Bitstamp exchange. That is very bad, Nexon is the worst greedy gaming company I have ever witnessed.
So the GDAX to 8.6 thing earlier was pretty ridiculous, but it most likely just stemmed from some very large market sell orders (thanks?), which threw off the arb bots and put everything out of whack. Outside of that, this really isn't a bearish situation at all - at least not yet. It looked like 9 would hold, it didn't (ok, nbd), but next in line (8.8) picked up the slack and we've bounced nicely from there and continue to recover.  Consolidation in the 8.8-9.2 range over the next couple days would be bullish AF imo. Don't forget we literally climbed about 50% in 2 weeks lol. 

Should be an interesting next few days, whichever direction we go.. *your move bitcoin.*

Breaking down bear flag has target of 8.2.

Log-downtrend from 20k is currently at 8.25.

Reading opinions change every ten minutes and TA terms I never knew existed to validate your opinions is making my head hurt. If you came here for the first time and read the comments from the past couple hours you'd think everyone here is insane.
crazy how the sentiment can change in a few candles in this sub. I have long orders layered from 9200 to 8800
Definitely I'm a useless trader, yesterday I knew a reversal was inminent, but I couldn't pull the trigger and go fiat at 9750, and today I panic sold at 8820

I'm gonna find the most interesting/cheap alt, put all my stash in it and forget all about this for as long as I can

Good luck everyone!!
Funny how sentiment changes on a pin yet this retrace was harked days ago.
I'm long from $8800.  We've got a nice capitulation candle and have now more than fully retraced yesterday's gains
Highest volume in the past 12 days and we have 4 hours left to go. I'm feeling pretty bullish given that even with all the dumping today, the price didn't even retrace to the 38.2 line at 8610 (except on GDAX which shot right back up). The last 6hr candle on finex also has a long lower wick, evidence of support from 8780 and up. The current run might still fall ultimately, but I'd bet on another test at 9.6k-10k before that happens
From the lending books on Polo and Bitfinex, nobody is shorting this, everyone is going long.

There are nearly 2k coins on offer below .01% daily on Bitfinex.  Simillar story on Polo.

There is only 6k (yes, $6,000) available to borrow on BFX below .1%

Edit: For reference, the was 10M USD available for borrowing below .1% 24 hours ago.

Panic closed my short from CA@ 9720 last night around 9475 on the bounce like an idiot. Couldn’t have woken up more angry as that short would have nearly covered all of my losses I’ve ever made trading. 

Lesson learned: Have a game plan and target in mind and don’t panic close on weak bounces of a double top :) 
Lots of big buy walls here being hit and not pulled, idk, have a hard time feeling very bearish
We are now piercing and maybe breaking down out of that rising wedge, and will for sure with another sustained drop. edit: the bottom of it showing support
After closing my short at 8830, i've opened and closed 2 Fomo longs for about a fish tacos profit (one in small profit, one with small loss). Obviously over trading now, so gonna back off.

The sell pressure at this level is still pretty high though and i'm considering this bounce a bear flag for now until we break above 9/9,2 again. Would short here, but r/r is shite for a short right now, so gonna sit it out. Do think lower is in the cards after some consolidation here.

Also sold some coins at 7500eu this morning that i had bought back at around 6500eu. I don't know about you guys, but i generally feel much more comfortable having my money in btc and just hedging on mex when i expect downside. Having money on the sidelines just makes irrational feelings of fomo so much stronger. Considering buying back in with fiat for that reason, since i can always hedge on mex if it goes sideways.

(also officially doubled my mex trading stack today. yay!)

This is only in 4 minute span. Doesn’t include the rest 
Bullish divergence on 30 min and 1 hr, bullish hidden divergence on 4 hr
So last night as I went to bed I had a short at 9010 with stop buys at 9150 and limit sell at 8765, thinking it would go down but wanting to play it safe in case this took off again. What does Bitcoin do? Goes up to trigger my stop buy before plummeting below my limit sell!

Bitcoin the bastard I shall christen it now. Clearly sleep and trading don’t mix!
I've been out of the loop for a while and was hoping you gentlemen could fill me in on what's been happening regarding a proper bitcoin ETF. I'm considering making a move from holding BTC to holding GBTC for various reasons, but would like to weigh the possibility of the market price returning to the NAV in the event of a proper ETF issuance.

Is a proper bitcoin ETF all but dead right now? Anything promising in the pipeline? I remember Silbert was doing something in that regard.... but then they opened up private placement in GBTC again after they closed it about a year ago. What about the Winklevoss ETF? Totally dead? The calendar on the side doesn't mention anything about any upcoming ETF news... so.... what's the scoop?
looks very bullish so far, barely had a dump after hitting 200MA which makes me to think we are going to retest it sooner or later, but i dont feel like trading this chop so no trade zone for me until direction becomes more clear.
Added a short at 9450 when I woke up this morning. If we break 9200, I might actually make some money for the first time in a while. I’ve been playing it very safe and missed the ship that left at 6500. Let’s see what happens. 

EDIT: And thar she blows!
Went all in long with an avg cost of 8660. waiting for gdax to catch up to bfx price lol
When sanity returns to exchanges (price parity, really) -- the remaining opened longs should be an amalgamation of traders who are deep in profit who have exited above 9k to open lower (before the $100+ price difference in the exchanges occurred) and recent bulls who longed late and bailed fast to buy in lower. Ultimately this will provide a basing/price consolidation at levels that had been devoid of serious tests. The fact that so many more longs opened at these lower price levels means the price floor has been 'raised' so we SHOULD experience less volatility when sanity returns. We are still above the key resistance level of 8.5k -- if BTC tanks below that on volume, then it's time to be concerned as a bull.
woops looks like everyone here was wrong again
This either* breaks back into the downtrend or is the best dip you will ever see, what a polarizing moment. Best of luck to all
Perfect bounce off an important fib line right now. Would be incredibly bullish if that was the depth of the retracement. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/654mzqva/
Closed my long at 9550 and took a nice profit. Also managed to pull out with decent profits on the few alts I was holding for the past week. The markets are definitely seeing a pullback here. Especially alts.

Edit1: Long on BTC again from 9.3k. Let’s see how this goes. Don’t feel super excited about it. We should pull back more here.

Edit2: Closed at a small loss.
The bear reminding us that he is alive and will strike at any time. 
Buying this dip, GDAX @ $8764, Bitfinex @ $8900.
These are my current big picture thoughts:

Daily (log view) now shows a nice new trend line from Dec ATH. We're still in a sym triangle. ~$9.8K local top was end of impulsive wave 1 from $6.5K local bottom earlier this month. Now we do a wave 2 correction (confirmation wave 2 has started once the current or next 4hr candle closes below about $8930). This will eventually take us to somewhere around ~$7650. Then we either break down and continue bear trend or we break up and out of sym triangle (i.e. setting a new higher low on the weekly, initiating impulse wave 3) and begin mega bull run towards $12K and beyond.

I doubt btc will remain on the doorstep of $10k for long.

Expect major volatility in both directions.

Sorry for non-serious post but my favorite thing about the last couple days was that crypto_chad69 was raking in the upvotes right and left. This isn’t meant to be bear gloating because I honestly think there’s a non-trivial chance the parabolic travs might be right for a while, but it’s funny watching Poe’s law in action as sentiment swings
Funding on bitmex right now is the largest I've ever seen it     .375  That's right, not .0375.   .375

Meaning in 50 minutes when funding hits for every -1m contracts you hold you get 3750$ in funding. 
Below double bottom. It's all over. ;)
Just looking at the weekly chart...

Thoughts?
4/25/18 PM UPDATE. After an incredible 8 day run from $7,823 to $9,745 (+24.57%) the market has pulled back to a low of $8,784. This retracement was expected, it was just a question of when, where and how severe. Today at [8am PDT](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8eqr52/daily_discussion_wednesday_april_25_2018/dxy1rp5/), I accumulated via GDAX when BTC hit $8,764. (FWIW, I also bought some ETH in that range at $599.)

Based on the sustained volume of the run up, I predicted in my last post on [4/25/18 AM]( https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8eqr52/daily_discussion_wednesday_april_25_2018/dxxesfr/) that we would stay within the ascending wedge and bounce off $9,088. I was wrong. In retrospect, when we broke above the ascending wedge at $9,572, I should have sensed the pullback would bring us below it as well. Additionally, my last "big update" was on [4/24/18](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8eho8a/daily_discussion_tuesday_april_24_2018/dxvaepn/) if you're interested.

I’ve cleaned up my chart as things were getting chaotic. The ascending wedge that we broke out of is in purple. The new channel is in black. I show three possible bands of resistance in gold and four short-term scenarios in bright green. Three supports are in blue, the most important is the dark blue log support from 2017 prior to ATH. Invalidated or expired channels, supports and resistances are in grey. Here are the updated charts…

Here’s the [zoomed out, macro view](https://www.tradingview.com/x/hFTxlqfd/).     
Here’s the [new channel and four scenarios](https://www.tradingview.com/x/zJvOZtDN/).     
Here’s the [super zoomed in view](https://www.tradingview.com/x/lwP7nHsD/).     

**Uber Bull Case:** This assumes we replicate the 8 day run we just completed and lands us in the upper range of the new channel. This gives us a price target of $10,850 by May 2.     
*Probability of Occurring: 15%*     

**Bull Case:** This assumes a steady climb that keeps us within the lower range of the new channel. This gives us a price target of $10,500 by May 6.     
*Probability of Occurring: 45%*     

**Bull Lite Case:** This assumes the market’s upward trend continues, but also accounts for the possibility that we have not found the true support for this channel yet. This gives us a price target of $10,000 by May 8.     
*Probability of Occurring: 30%*     

**Sideways Case:** This is still overall a bullish sentiment, it just assumes the market will be choppy for the next two weeks. This gives us a price target of $9,350 on May 10.     
*Probability of Occurring: 10%*     
I knew it. I knew old me would have FOMO'd when we broke 9500, but I remained discipline. That is also why I knew this was going to happen (based on previous experiences), because I would have been burned. Let's see how this goes.

Edit: I sit in fiat waiting for the dust to settle.
Getting too old for this shit.
Stopped out of my short for a moderate loss. Remember folks, stick to your plan.

Rational me this morning post summary: "Don't panic yet. This retrace is needed to cool down. Log support at 8750. Planning to long 88xx."  

Reactionary me this morning post summary: "Screw it, short 8960"  

Be like rational me, kids.
Bitcoin is annoying as fuck
wow more than $100 difference between bitfinex and binance currently 9260 vs. 9130
Went long at 9150 but my stop loss at 9250 got filled.. It really sucks because I could have taken profit at 9700..
waiting to close my short from 9.3k yesterday.  I think we might get to 8.8k.  stops at 9.25.  I shorted a little too early plus opened up a small 5x short on bitmex and watching it go parabolic last night felt like I was shitting myself for 2 hours straight.  

Remember not to let yourself be influenced by randos on reddit. 
 There were people opening longs at the top and thinking it was going to go straight to 11k when we were insanely overbought.  If anything thats a good sign that you should sell.
So my accidental short turned on to a 3% profit position, not bad. A real test of 8600 before the weekend would be healthy i think 
I think Bitcoin is back, volatility I missed you
There's at least some sentiment we are near the local bottom... longs are opening at a ferocious pace.
Ah, screw it. Short 8960 June futures stops at 9120.

edit: Panic selling at crazy high levels. Seems to be stabilizing, but one more market sell might push this off the cliff. If not, I'll take my hit. This is a 5x position with 40% of the stack. 
I badly misread gdax trailing the others, thought everyone else was going to fall to gdax, but instead gdax was just an anomaly. 
Okay, these might be reallllly stupid questions, but please bear with me and help me learn.

I have $1000 I'm going to dedicate to learning to trade.  I'm going over some things trying to learn the terminology and make sure I am understanding the math for loss/profits and the risk associated with them.  This is what I'm considering doing.

  * For the next month I'll attempt some trades with $100 USD values.  I'll set a price target limit order, as well as a loss limit order.  As an example, today we are at 8900~ on BTC.  Lets pretend I want to go long.  I'll use $100 to open a position (no leverage), set a target limit at 9100, and I'll set a limit stop loss at lets say 8700.  This way I either make $2~ or I lose $2~.

  * I'll open these positions attempting to make that $2, but if I lose the $2 no biggie.

  * I was thinking of being slightly more aggressive with my profit targets if I believe I'm being too conservative.

Is this a good way to go about it?  Am I an idiot?  Is there a better way to go about it?  Am I being too safe or not safe enough? I accept criticism!

Edit:  I just wanted to add this to my top comment since it would be hard to do this individually.  I appreciate all the help I'm getting in the comments.  Thanks for dealing with my dumb questions.

GPU prices finally coming down

They’re saying that a lot of their big clients, such as distributors and mining farms, have either suspended, or cut, their orders of graphics cards.

> It all seems to be down to a combination of a general slowdown in the cryptocurrency market overall, as well as a growing trend of companies holding back on graphics card purchases because of the Bitmain ASICs set to arrive in the third quarter of this year.

I've come to the conclusion that the opportunity cost of having a life is too high. How do you get the balance right between being there to get a great entry / exit without staying glued to the charts?
Am I the only one not margin trading here? Everyone talks about longs and shorts all day long 
Exited my long for a moderate loss at around $8,760.

A bit surprised by how rapidly this dropped. will wait and see how this plays out in the next few hours/days.

EDIT: I'd expect a bounce here, and I potentially just closed the local bottom. But still, happy to be out and observing for now rather than standing in front of the bear train.
This thread gets funnier day by day , everyone was asking for a pullback to cool off the market , we had one and now everyone is a perma bear 
Too emotional imo
Descending wedge broke down, 1H RSI pierced below 30, that's very bearish in my book.

If I had a leveraged long right now, I'd feel like I had a target on my back with this long:short ratio.  Wouldn't be surprised if we saw a bear whale take advantage of this situation sometime soon.
Some brave soul on Bitfinex taking the whole "buy the dip" thing way too seriously...buying 100 BTC every $20 down ($9,501.50, $9,481.50, $9,461.50).

Another at $9,451.50....

This is absolutely, positively guaranteed to work (*unless you run out of money and it keeps dipping*).
Interesting. Will relentless "buying the dip" continue once again?
what's up with bitmex prices??? $70 premium over gdax?! $40 over finex?
sorry for the noobish question. trading on bitmex yesterday on leverage (i was scalping since 8.5k) i bought (LONGed) somewhere around 9.6k and was about to sleep when the price exceeded 9.7k. i set a stop limit SELL to trigger somewhere around 9680 so that i could still have gained. 

when i woke up, my whole stack was liquidated because the price crashed to 9.3kish i am just so mad right now. should i have used stop market? 

EDIT: i had the reduce only tickbox checked.

update: my remaining stack of 5% i have just opened a 100x long. gonna ride this for a $100. no stop limit/market this time. it's a do or die kind of thing once you lose 95% of your stack. 
I'm thinking profit-taking for near term. The alts are getting demolished


edit: called it
Worth noting that after bull running hard, alt ratios stopped and reversed during the last BTC legs up to 9750 before this reverse. I believe the inverse happened at the BGC at 6.5 too. Will definitely be keeping an eye on this in the future
this week, the altcoins lead the charge going up and going down. right now, some alts are trying to be in the green. i hope they lead the charge again to go past 10k this time. 
If you like EW, it looks like impulse wave 1 from ~$6.5K finished just shy of $9.8K, so we are now in to a corrective wave 2.

0.382 fib retrace of that wave 1 puts the floor at ~$8500 (would be very bullish)

0.5 fib retrace puts the floor at ~$8150

0.618 fib retrace puts the floor at ~$7750

0.786 fib retrace puts the floor at ~$7200

Could take until the weekend to play out. Good news is, once wave 2 correction is done (and assuming price stays somewhere above $7K), we are on to a nice big wave 3 impulse up :)


Edit: for completeness sake: one other possibility (super bulltard interpretation) is that impulse wave 1 has not quite finished yet and has a final leg up (invalidated I think if price drops much below ~$8950).
Rising wedge solidly broken down now. edit: but not far enough that it couldn't just be simply redrawn
A bounce from 8.7 range to 9.2 would be soooooooo freaking bullish after a 1k retrace that didn't come in just one or two BRDs. 
I would not be shocked by a bullish hammer EOD, unlikely but I would not be surprised.  There is still palpable buying pressure outside of this morning's fiasco.
Wow, I didn't expected this at all. Closed my long from $8,955 just above break even, didn't turned out to be a good trade, yet technically closed it in green. Things to be learnt from it. Opened my eyes to $9,610, but never closed it that time..

I was expecting $9,200 to hold, if not that, $9,000 (we had huge chunk of buy orders there), but none of the two held up so I reviewed my trade and decided to close it just in time when I realized the opportunity of a better entry.

I have re-entered 3x long from $8,817. I am honestly not sure where we are heading now and whether or not we will see more red candles or will start going up again.

Anyhow, market right now is looking good for buyers. I think we saw almost a 10% pullback. Is that enough to take the market forward or do we need to pull back further?
Weak bearish TK cross on the 2h, just avoided on the 4h.
8800 looks like solid support.  Going long here.  See you guys at 10k. 

Also,  I'd like to see BTC move up like 2-3% in BTC dominance as well.  
Any advice on what the next entry point I should be looking for is? After making good gains yesterday I just got completely wasted today, erasing everything and then some. Underestimated how low we would go, had buys set up at 9.2/3 last night and then closed them at a loss in the 8.8 range earlier and then did some good old revenge trading that lost me some more. Seeing the price now makes me not feel great. 

I'm thinking 9.2 would be a point of interest to see how hard we get rejected? Good place to scalp a short or better to see if we get by it first and open a long from there?
The bear in me thinks we're almost at the C of an ABCD (although that still assumes the bigger picture is bullish). The Bullchad in me thinks this just wants to badger onward and upward. Went all in on the way down at 9100, hands were only just strong enough not to sell on the dip to 8700. On the one hand want to sell some here in case this is an ABCD - on the other hand, I don't want to risk decreasing my BTC stack by even one satoshi. Lets see.
So was that the bear flag? Does that mean it's played out or can we expect more damage?
Trying to paint today's candle close in pair with yesterday's open...
If we stall out at ~8750 is that bullish? Is that a "double bottom" for the day or is it meaningless?
Hmm, ALARMS, alarms everywhere too bad I fell asleep have to be up early tomorrow.

[Target kind of reached](https://www.tradingview.com/x/KEuCPPdD/), was hoping for a little more only one of my ladders got filled but oh well. This now gives us a triple confluence of targets at the 8200 level and a little clue on the time scale. If it takes till around the evening UTC tomorrow it puts the 1:1 Extension, 0.5 retrace and log downtread line all within $80 of each other. At that time we well also get a TD9 Buy signal on the 4hr chart to coincide with a possible reversal.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/wJqTdPiC/

Will be closing my short fully around 8.2k, provided we get there of course.

Edit: This is the time chart https://www.tradingview.com/x/rNpI4sH7/ for those interested, the daily is giving a sell signal at these levels but its not coming off a 9 sell. This is a weaker signal to trade off so take at your own risk.

Edit 2: Oh man the stars are aligning for it, volume profile matches target at 8.1k as well https://www.tradingview.com/x/JEDwgVyd/

Edit 3: Bull case anyone? https://www.tradingview.com/x/3k9jnjwO/ This is how we did it back then, will we do it again?

8875 support turned resistance
/u/_chewtoy_ Thanks again for the great call. 

I’m not sure how you do it, but the last few weeks your calls have been on the dime. To all who have followed have some some decent cash. 

You have some wicked form of TA  wizardry. 

Edit: Closed my short from CA @ $9720. Most likely closed too early like usual, but ide like to sleep and lock in profits. I tend to panic close easily, need to learn to not 
This dip was brought on by the longs that got into the wagon late on this run.  The drop was irrationally driven by fear by these bulls caught with their pants down trying to defend their capital.  Price will stabilize, arrive at parity across exchanges then move back up.  GDAX is the posterboy for front running noob traders so there was a big gap between it and Bitfinex, it would be truly dumb to sell now unless you are arbing.

This is very good for bitcoin.  Drop more please.
Interest is now maxed out for the foreseeable future...when the price is *dropping*.

Color me stupid and confused.
[removed]
god I need sleep. 
Again seeming to bounce off log support (Sept -> 6k -> 7.2k)... temporarily.
I'm seeing a hidden bull div on the 4h and lower timeframes.
Horizontal support on the 4h, 1d , and last weeks high at 9040.  We all been waiting for a dip to buy in and here it is, I’m long af. 
Breathe. this was so obviously expected and needed. there was too much money to be made by rekt-in’ shorts the last two weeks for that not to happen. binance led the dump, alt profits from the last few weeks won’t go back into them, but into bitcoin. I’m looking for another BGD so large even McAffe, his guard dogs, and his hitmen couldn’t eat  it on live televison. 

In terms of position, I bought ripple at half a buck and sold at 96 cents. feels good to get that out of my ‘portfolio’.  finally own over a coin for the first time in years not about to be wasted on things I shouldn’t be buying anyway online. I’m feeling ghoulishy bullish about the future. Thanks for all the love and advice guys. I don’t post TA or anything but with all your help I’ve turned a 4K investment into a coin, and my first buy (post .tor days) was ohhhhh at 19.7k. Sheesh. 

After larger BGD in the mid 11s I’m expecting pull back to 10 and then all systems go 
Cmon vegeta memes hold the line
After hitting my [previous target](https://www.tradingview.com/x/WdvC2wTh/) almost perfectly this could be the start of the larger pullback we are looking for. What happens at 9k will be the tell. If 9k holds and we push back past the local high expect a much bigger move on the horizon. It means last night was just another warning whipsaw. My take is we are going to see a mini crash pattern form where we hold 9k for a little then it breaks. If that happens valid targets below that at various fib levels expecting a larger ABC correction to take place.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/bozoF9S4/

Once this completes I am bullish af as we will likely start a larger degree wave 3. Ready to commit the remaining fiat to BTC again, I want to see the log downtread line confirm as support at the 0.5 or the 0.618 later this week. Other options are we grind down the down tread line as before until we really see final capitulation or we bounce off the 9k 0.236 and overextend further.

Disclaimer: Short 9500 XBTM18(2x Trading stack), stops above local high.

EDIT: This is what I am looking at comparing the recent run to the much larger run to 20k https://www.tradingview.com/x/YFz8N0YK/ just preparing for the possibility of it. 


Almost full retrace on a daily, should consolidate here now for a day or two before going back up.
My short got liquidated at just over 9,700 last night. My liquidation / stop points are always exactly at reversal points lately.

Also, the only exchange which I can use has stopped processing deposits / withdrawals, so I now have no way of adding more fiat or cashing out in any case.

Unless I can build some kind of stack from my remaining 0.0099 BTC (lol!), I'm pretty much forced to give up on crypto entirely for now. What a shit month this has been.
My lesson for today was you do not always have to be in the mix.  Lost about $400 per BTC when I sold virtually at the bottom this afternoon.  My mistake was the long at 9150 when it had shown a tiny bounce of recovery.

Where am I now?  On the sidelines.  Feels good.
I'm having a serious issue with gaining huge profits one day then sinking most of it the next. In the last two weeks I've done (four times) 25% on my whole stack in a day, and then -15 or once even -20% the next 24 hours.

The obvious answer is just "don't trade for a day", which I won't, but I would rather get to the heart of the issue. Do you think that it's just hubris mixed with happy hormones causing me to make bad decisions? Or maybe it's greed causing me to stay with a position long after it is profitable? Or maybe its erroneous thinking where I gamble more because I am so much in the green, ie I can "afford to lose"?

I realize this screams unexperienced trader, and I don't mind admitting that. I'd love to hear your thoughts or advice on this.
It may be worth noting that in the recovery from 5.9k in Feb, we bounced off 9.75 just like we did this time. Came all the way down to 9k and climbed back up to 11.7k, dropped back down to 9k and then subsequently climbed back to 11.7k

In the last run, the alts were valued slightly higher than they are now.

I think 9k will hold for now
Alright... so. In case we keep going down, where's the next major support?
Peer pressure is strong in this market. One big buy/sell and everyone follows, then take heavy dents in their stack and then complain how they lost the money.

I think if one is to make money, he will have to do it on his own without these external factors influencing him.

I will be away for the hours to come, so all the best to all traders. :)
ok so my channel of  [yesterday](https://www.tradingview.com/x/LeUu43q0/) is working pretty well:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/I8Y2otVQ/
Was in fiat waiting since that small DCB, now betting on good support @9200(for the time being) so I went long 3x @9270.
Small leverage because i'm still unsure where it's going
Is this valid hidden bearish on a daily?

https://www.tradingview.com/x/UIsv3oIU/
Tempted to take profit here and re-enter a little higher at 9400 with my short but feeling inclined to let it ride. I'm maybe too married to the daily stoch RSI crossing in overbought but that has ~80% of the time signalled a multi-day bear run. Still not even close to oversold on most time frames.
placed buy orders between 8.8k und 9.0k, I dont think we will rebounce here.

Of yourse we could, but r/r is not high enough for me.

\(we will retest the support of the falling wedge and break out of the wedge to the upside to test the resistance of the big ascending wedge, my wild guess\)
playing with fib retracement:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/oxeASJvJ/

those levels are pretty spot on, strong support at 8800? (0.5 fib). 

Disclaimer: take this with a grain of salt as I don't really know what I'm doing.
$800 drop in 14 hours. Really? Will be very surprised if we don't see at least $300 bounce right now.
BFX 8866 GDAX 8728 as I type this

Was hoping to open a long around 8800 as I thought it'd provide resistance. BFX has done so but GDAX just blew through it.

Going to wait for a convincing 9k or drop to 8.6k I think. Would rather like the exchanges not have $100\+ differences as well.
I'm not entering long here, despite my earlier post. GDAX just got wrecked by a market sell and it's pushing a $150 discount under BFX. It's flirting with the 8-month log support line, but I chart off BFX and we've still got a ways to go.

GDAX is absolutely pooing the bed right now. I'm out of position and plan to stay there until this resolves. 
gdax overreacts whether up or down, but this is crazy. gdax made it to 8625 vs 8825 on bitfinex.
Lmao wtf is GDAX doing? That
Exchange is always so emotional
Bouncing off the bottom of a high volume node. Literally wicked off the box I drew a few days ago. We are clearly outside of the wedge now, but I am not trading off of that structure. We want to get outside of the box (over 9000), good chance we congest here for a little while before deciding on a direction.

https://imgur.com/a/WWuYz6z
old log support broken. as has been stated, old ATH resistance is at 8.2 and seems like the next likely strong support to test
Potential descending wedge on the 1hr https://imgur.com/AxdOG0D  I dunno, the drawing seems forced.

Edit:  For the next move I'm guessing it'll bounce off of 9000 on that diagonal resistance line based on the current trajectory, regardless of if there is a wedge or not.   Or maybe it bounces of 9k but it was just psychological resistance.  Or from the horizontal resistance of the 21st to the 23rd. 
Closed 60% of my [open short position from 9523 that I took yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8eqr52/daily_discussion_wednesday_april_25_2018/dxxdwed/) at 72% profit. I'll keep 40% open for downward hedge protection.

I don't like trading this short term but two things just happened that change the equation:

* Tether putting out another 100mil in leverage out today 

* Nasdaq news is very bullish actually from the perspective of expectations for future fiat inflow, if not for the decentralization and unregulated nature of Bitcoin. 

I've been thinking a lot about the nature of retail and whales/professional traders in the Bitcoin space, and just how different this market is than any other. Nothing else behaves like it, and you have two clearly different groups who either create the market or serve as liquidity, which means understanding the type of people buying and selling at any point in time ends up being critically important information. Yet most retail investors don't look at it at all, they simply end up using TA tools transfered from the equity markets, tools which are meant to be used for long term trading over vastly less volatile markets. I'll do a little write up when I get home later, its been something that I've been thinking about this entire week watching the drive past 8.7 and just how disconnected the perp swaps, futures and spot markets were getting and how so few of the retail investors saw that something's gotta give.
Ah yes, maximum pain before the end of the daily candle.
How does buy support just fall out like that and the price tanks...?

Unless if it's a bear trap, but you would think the bulls would be smarter than this.
I was so close to closing my short at $9700
Feeling a tad more salty about my short getting liquidated at 9.7k last night now....

Need a bear-hug
25x short the June futures with 5% of my trading stack. If this was a big DCB then this premium is a joke and will be free money soon. 
I think the R/R is great here, my liquidation is north of 9350 but i will cut this at 9.3. At worse i lose 90% of the gains from my earlier short of 9.7 but i can live with it. Dont want to be left exposed if this the start of a 3k death spiral. 
This is looking kinda bullish to me. 8900 held (no hourly closes below) and now we're grinding at 9k. I think we'll bounce up to 9400 if we can break this 9k level.

ETA: Just broke 9k. Vegeta will take us to 9.4k now.
Wow, 24hr volume on GDAX is almost 33,000 BTC. Can't remember the last time I've seen it that high.
Only people getting rich in this market are whales finding liquidation points of folks who like to gamble.

Liquidated long on XBTUSD: Sell 3,718,632 @ 8874
 
https://twitter.com/BitmexRekt/status/989285176919445504
Seems like a weak hand shake out along with some healthy retrace.  If we stay above ~8750, we consolidate and then continue the move up.  Lord help us if we drop into the low 8ks

Edit:  The 3 day long term moving average is at 8750.  However, the log and linear downward resistance line is at 8k and 6k respectively.  We broke the linear trend long ago, so the old log resistance is the price to watch.  Going as low as 8k again would break any sort of adam and eve confirmation IMO, but we could still bounce up off it
That Nasdaq news...wow!
the volatility in bitcoin is unpredictably amazing... No 2 days are ever the same! Truly millennial!!
Funny... 10%+ up in 7 days. 

300 - 500$ drop in a few hours and people posting that the world is ending.
Looks like we are falling off from the 23.6% Fib (˜9.3) of the drop from 20k to 6. It has acted as support for some hours. We are also below our super-steep ascending wedge now, obviously. I am putting in buy orders around 9k.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/nZVUclrt/

(Edit: Pulled my buy orders. Gotta learn to be more patient and not make a trade every day.)
Waiting to see if 9k breaks.. I don't think we'll bounce off it. After the upward action of the recent week I can see a big ass red daily to redress the balance a bit.


Rising wedge support here not looking particularly feisty. Think a solid breakdown is imminent to the mid 8's

edit: when chewy contradicts me I am just going to listen to chewy. closing short
and longs keep going up more....seriously wtf..does noone look at the longs and shorts?   
I was thinking maybe 8.6k would be a good target, but now I'm thinking maybe 8.2k
I hope you all were buying the dips and averaging down this morning. I had a feeling the tree would shake and we would pick it right back up. no free rides to 10k!
Low content:

I've been looking at the graphs for some shares I've been holding for about a decade as I'm thinking of selling them soon. It is so strange looking at graphs with big gaps between the candles.

Ita so strange that in todays connected world, the largest markets are open for less than half the day, for only 5 days per week. Crypto exchanges are doing a pretty good job for a niche market imho.

Jesus, not even confident 8.2 will hold after that violent dump.

Also, 3 day stoch RSI crossed down
Buy support weak 
Time to go long
Preflight checks are just being completed then we will be on our way shortly 
I was here today asking lots of questions, and I've grabbed my first margin position today.  To hold myself accountable and allow people to tear me to shreds even at the expense of possibly sounding stupid, I'm going to post my positions as I take them.  Learning through blunt force I suppose.  

I'm long with 10% of my stack @9132 with 2x leverage.  Stop at 8950.  I'm scared, hold me.
Highly likely to retest the downtrend we broke out of i think. The bounce off that will determine if were bear for the next 6 months or not. We gotta clear 12k on that bounce for sure before we are bull again.   
Edit: keep an eye on longs for this dump. If they keep adding all the way down to 8.2k we are f u c k e d.   
Edit2: i love how whenever i post something bearish i constantly find myself on top of Controversial, but if i post something bullish its insta 10 upvotes. this market is way too optimistic still.
Quick update on the Bitcoin market versus the US Dollar.

[You can find the chart magic here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptosignals/)

We can see that the price action above $9000 pushed us to about $9600 before we saw the sellers stepping in.

Both of the indicators confirm the current selling momentum, however it is important to note the RSI is still above 50 on the 4hr candles and the PPO indicator is still in the positive.

It is normal to see a correction after a good bullish run in any market, I am looking towards $8800 – $9000 for shorter term support.

Like I mentioned in the previous report, it will be wise to follow the trend until a reversal is confirmed.

A word from the eternal bear, should we fail to consolidate above $8800 going into the weekend we could revisit the previous support zones between $6800 – $8000.
Firstly, I would like to apologise to the mods and everyone on the sub for my low effort posts over the last few days! I hope this analysis will be considered of decent enough quality.
  
Really simple stuff here, but consistently effective.  This method involves Andrews Pitchfork and the theory behind it. And thus, even my bullish scenario involves a sizeable pull back. Why? Because as it stands right now we are touching the top of a pitchfork with pivot points of 1) December ATH ($20k), 2) Feb capitulation low ($6k) and 3) March Bull trap ($11.5k).  As I am sure you will agree; the 3 most important points in defining 2018's price history so far.

For a visual of what I am describing see here: https://www.tradingview.com/x/72M6UwEy/

Now, Andrews Pitchfork theory states that in order for price to exit a pitchfork there must be a "Price failure".  This means that the price attempts to return to the "Median Line" but does not make it all the way there before turning around and heading back towards the pitchfork boundary.  Price Failures are often an early indicator of a trend change. This would be very healthy and bullish for the rest of the years price action.  A pullback to around $8k would be sufficient here.

My Bearish scenario would be this: We are currently in a corrective wave, searching for point 'C' (Point A being Feb low and point B being March Bull trap).  And again using Pitchfork theory: 80% of the time price will reverse at the pitchfork boundary and touch the median line.  By this time next week the Median Line will be around $6k.  If we were to reach out to here it could be the start of a bearish impulse which would help us find our 'C' point somewhere under $6k.  I’m not an advocate of these $3k bear targets.  But if this scenario plays out I will start my DCA strategy at somewhere around $5k.

Huge price difference (~$80) between Binance and BFX, why is that? And why do arbitrage bots do not close this gap?
I currently have it around the lower edge of the rising wedge on Finex charts. 
We're gonna have to redraw that big wedge again with this new support point expanding it, aren't we ;)
well that 500 coin buywall just dissapeared in 30 secons in bfx. things are happening.
How can you tell if a price point is being well defended by looking at the order book? I'm watching the fight for 9000 with my finger on the button ready to close my long, but even after that 1000 btc buy wall went away, it seems like smaller orders popped up and are defending the price just as well.

What kind of flow or patterns should I be looking for?

Glad I took a break after closing my long last night. Re entered lower at 8900 10x sept futs.  Currently short term play not confident this will hold.
Some crazy shit is going on right now.
bounced?

I closed my short from 9738 at 8935 and started switching to a long under 8900. I quickly bailed on that long at break even after seeing GDAX dump $200 below finex and mex. 

My plan had been to set up my long around 8800, expecting a bounce from the September log line at about 8775 on my chart. 

I'm sitting out of position for a bit until the exchanges move a little closer together. I hope I didn't just close a good long entry, but I'm playing it safe for now.
GDAX and Bitfinex price as of this posting are now $25 apart.  At one point today,BTC at GDAX was at a $200+ discount.  Nice recovery.  And holy hell there were a lot of panicked noobs.
If we get a few hourly candles in a row over 8900 is it safe to say we've found a floor? Or should I be looking at different indicators?

Edit. Sorry just seen it was posted below.
https://www.tradingview.com/x/n41wUF1O/  Bit of a bull div on 1-2 hour, decent size wick on 4 hour (just confirmed) so I'm thinking some relief for bulls here over next 2-4 hours then go lower later today.  Would not long here, preferably you are already short and holding it. 
I love how people here happpen to be well positioned every fucking time.

Just before the drop everyone was talking about 10k, now everyone is talking about 8.2k.

Someone pass the memo to bitcoin please : the crypto market is bullish, you look like an idiot and are only hurting yourself.
[https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/25/nasdaq\-is\-open\-to\-becoming\-cryptocurrency\-exchange\-ceo\-says.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/25/nasdaq-is-open-to-becoming-cryptocurrency-exchange-ceo-says.html)
Reposting since I posted at the end of the last daily. Will try to update with charts later if I have time. Still in fiat since 9.5ks.

Binance appears to be heavily leading this latest retrace with BFX trying to keep it from falling. Overall, double top on short time frames essentially confirmed with a possible throwback in progress and a bear div on the hourly plus multiple bear divs on the 15 min. Hate short time frames but with this volatility looking at them is somewhat justifiable.

Daily hidden bear div still in progress of forming.

This is speculative but given the alt ratios dumping this could be alt profits fleeing to fiat. The fact that binance is leading gives that some credibility, better to discuss that theory in the alt thread though I suppose.
Was short from 9.7 with only 1/2 my usual size. Added another 1/4 at 9.2. Looking at how the alts are getting railed it's pretty obvious this is going to be more than a minor correction. A lot of panic hands must have fomod into BTC and alts in the last few days. 
Looks like we are entering consolidation mode. This should lead to higher movement if we can maintain this range (9000-9500) for the next couple of days. The goal is to form an equilibrium pattern with tightening range before the next break.

On the bright side, today's dump was another good test of the rising trendline from Sept low, confirming that as support.  (2nd image zoomed in)

https://imgur.com/a/ax6CExc

After a 50% increase in the past 3 weeks, some type of pullback was to be expected.
FWIW, that's a gigantic hidden bull div on the 4 hr with before we first broke into 9k. Maybe someone else already pointed it out, I've been away from charts for a bit. This violent drop did a number on medium time frame RSIs.


The fact I am seeing many posters saying they are "buying the dip" at 9.2 k which is barely a 6% pullback after a 50% move upwards is just increasing my short term bearish disposition. People are buying without any reversal signal, [longs are increasing](https://www.tradingview.com/x/6qaBGXeM/) as price is dropping. I am of a strong conviction we are in a [crash pattern](https://www.tradingview.com/x/YFz8N0YK/).

Remember wave personality if we are the start of a correction this is the first A wave.

> A Waves unfold as 5’s if the beginning of a zigzag, or 3’s if the beginning of a flat or triangle.  Arrogance and complacence is lingering.  Most are convinced that it is just another pullback before the larger trend continues, although they are often sharp, and can retrace more than the previous impulse wave.  A waves following extensions on commodities are often crashes.  A waves do not kill the hopes associated with the old trend though.  MACD will be deeper at the end of A waves than it was during the previous waves 2 or 4.

> B Waves unfold as 3’s, and are sucker plays, especially in expanded/irregualar flats.  The masses believe the up trend has resumed.  Wave B’s are usually zigzags, and the next most likely is a triangle.

> C Waves unfold as 5’s (unless part of a triangle, or rarely a diagonal), and are strong like a wave 3.  The illusions held through A and B quickly evaporates into fear.  Near the end of C, the corrective phase will be widely mistaken for a new overall trend.

I know many think Elliott is all a bunch of crap but the psychology part of the process really rings for me as human nature never changes. 
Could we be seeing a [Bump-and-Run Reversal](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:chart_patterns:bump_and_run_reversal_reversal)?



Average decline: 19%



Pullback rate: 62%

I am going to open a long, but only *if* and when we go down to 9100. This currently is looking fairly healthy I think. I have been waiting for a proper retracement for the last week, it looks like we are finally getting it. 


\>inb4 you call me out for basically saying "this is good for bitcoin"
looks like we may be heading back toward the daily kijun: https://i.imgur.com/mZbw0ga.png

hopefully to confirm it as support--if not then there's daily cloud resistance and the daily EMA 200

edit: binance btcusdt bounced off kijun: https://i.imgur.com/todbPBK.png
was surprised by the massive discount (9120 usdt on binance vs 9300 on bitmex) -- picked up some  cheap corn for a nice arb opportunity
Closed my positions. ~10% return on my total investment capital.

This double rejection this night makes me believe we topped out here for now
Honestly this feels like a bear trap before we resume to 10k, but who knows in this market. Stop loss under 9k$ set
Cue the 2014 fractal memes. At least yesterday's BFX low is holding so far.
What have I done.  Ladders filled.  5x long with 66% of stack with ca 8950.  (had been trading at 2x with 40% of stack lately...)

Existing short only hedges like 10% of that.  

Edit: I reduced half of it at just a hair under BE.  More comfortable now.  Those lower buys that I just unloaded were nice to get the ca down at least.  I'll probably rebuy that if we see 8600.  Short is increased a tad and now hedging 25% of the long.
I'm expecting a minuscule bounce, then I'll open a short (with $100-$150 sl)
I love swimming in stormy waters with no life jacket. 


Keeps me sane. 
1k market buy on finex trying to defend this log support and/or stop hunt
[deleted]
If I were trying to implement Max Pain it would look a lot like this.  First stop out the FOMO longs, then get some shorts on board, give them a little profit to get them feeling bold, wait for the shorts to build again, then pump back up again, blowing past the previous ATH.
ok we're breaking out of the bear flag and we have a W bottom, so that's bullish
OK - so we've retraced the entire dump. Anyone care to offer up some analysis here? Is this hugely bullish? I can't help but feel this is gonna dump any second but maybe that's denial setting in.

My short's gonna get stopped out at B-E any second now and I don't know whether to open a long from here or stay out of position. Why I didn't take profits I don't know. But I think something should be said that everyone was screaming "8.2!!!" and that didn't materialize. Of course, that huge market order and subsequent buy wall in the 8.5-7 range might've helped things... But I think I need to check my bias, which is leaning towards "the price is being propped up" when maybe it should recognize that this is bullish?
Buyers are letting the sellers sell. We all know whats gonna happen when this cools down.
4k longs opened since our drop from 7.3k. They are already underwater. I am already hedge short from 9k, but thinking about adding just because it seems like the path of least resistence  that we get a long squeeze. Thoughts? 
Preview of changing 'influencer' values: https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/989184815340535808

The 'truth-seeking' social feedback loop is getting stronger. It's resonating.

When values change, financial incumbents change. Gradually, then all at once.

With search interest so relatively low, it won't take much of a catalyst to evoke the next wave/ath of global crypto interest. 

I've learned the hard way to *never* underestimate the power these peak influencers yield.
fuck this is really a bullrun isnt it? It seems the bears just could not push it down to continue the trend. Next resistance at 9.7?
Turning away from key level on volume: https://imgur.com/a/RowrVng

We did close the daily above it, but only one 4 hour and then a strong rejection.

I don't know what will happen. 8900 is the previous resistance turn support, so good chance we test that.
putting buys 9030-9130(1d kijun and bottom of cloud), hoping for a bounce there, if not i think it can get quite uncomfortable and we might see low 8ks and consolidate in 8-9k range for a while, but we might have seen bottom already tbh. looks strong
[deleted]
All of those chunky sells on finex going through, someone is unloading alot of BTC
wow that 140 btc buy wall @ 8900 on finex got eaten in 5 seconds..
GDAX leading the selling with almost and sometimes over $100 discount off finex
Did someone just panic market sell a shit ton on DAX? Shit had a 200 dollar difference for a little while there.
What's with the large spread on Gdax??
now RSI on 1h chart is at 26, like 4th April when btc dumped to 6600$. veeeeeeery low.
dax $200 lower then bitfinex?
While trying to close my longs... 

I accidentally opened up a 5x leverage short at 8936..

Second time I’ve accidentally opened a position and in profit.

Fat fingers are good for more than one thing..
Guys how do you put stop orders on Bitfinex. I am 3x long from $8,817, say I want to put a stop at $8,900 in order for my position to be closed automatically if it gets there, how would I go about it?

Currently I close the positions manually. There are a lot of order types on Bitfinex that confuses me. 
Got a long entry at 8975, 5x. Lets see where this goes, will be looking to close at the slightest potential of downward movement. 

edit: stops are very tight, don't plan on holding this very long.

edit 2: manually closed it for null gain
Can somebody please eli5 the bitmex funding?
I just reminded myself why i don't scalp trades on really volatile days. Made 2 good scalps an hour ago but just got stopped out to basically cancel out the gainz. On the other hand, the ascending channel we're in on the 4h is looking very promising at the moment.
Noob question here... I am new to Bitmex and I am confused about a trade I just made. I bought 8500 contracts at $8967 at 25x leverage. I sold all 8500 at 8990.00 In my mind, this should be a roe of about 6.5% . However, it shows a loss of  -0.00258608 XBT. Shouldn't that be a profit of .002425 XBT?

Edit: Thanks everyone, I understand now. It was the funding fees. It didn't realize how expensive the funding for longs is. Also, I held through the funding hour.
was that a bear trap, bear raid, or something else?
It's interesting how thin the resistance has been on this deliberate move upwards on GDAX. Reasonably large (30btc) sell walls have been evaporating with hardly any large market buys. 

It's hard to know what is a real order on GDAX any more with all the spoofing that happens there.
Has BitMex ever run out of their insurance fund?

I'm wondering how profitable/risky it would be to make funds lending on BitMex by shorting XBTUSD (and getting the funding rate which is generally around 0.07%/day for the past 60 days) and then going long bitcoin elsewhere.
Trying to figure out whether there's legitimate support here or not... not taking much volume to drop the price, buyers are apparently just not showing up.
If this bounces back up into the 8800 range I'm not going to know what to think.

Edit: How is this happening??
So now finex longs are going parabolic. Up 10% today while the price has crashed 10%. I truly believe that whenever one side goes into long/short the dip/bounce mode it's a great indicator to countertrade them. Expecting a lot more downside from here simply because that seems to be the path of least resistance.
K. Guess that's an official first rejection at 10k. We'll get it on the fifth try, don't you worry.
Dead Cat Bounce?

Im expecting 9500 to act as resistance. Thinking of shorting, but could be a noob move after we already dipped. Alts have more room to dump imo
Got stopped out yesterday at 9590. Opened a short again at 9390. Same small position size. Initial target 9050, then maybe 8800. Second attempt!
So what do we think guys, will 9000 hold?
Chikou sen is back inside the 12h kumo despite the bounce on the kijun sen holding for now. Might need a few more candles to know where this is going.

12h: https://www.tradingview.com/x/Y7SdhZkm

The daily is more telling however as we see a clear kumo rejection of the lagging span so, now bullish outbreak here for now indeed price is falling back into the cloud. If the tenkan sen doesn't hold here, then there should be some nice bearish action.

Anyone else seeing a giant bullflag on the 4HR? 

My TA isn’t the best I’ll post link in a second 

Or is it too step for a bullflag. Not sure if steepness is a factor 

Edit; Target 8200 for a bounce 

Edit Link: https://www.tradingview.com/x/DYjSEQK2/

I made this in mobile, disregard the terrible quality 
i don't think it's time to freak out quite yet, we are still ahead where we started today... this is a correction and hopefully we can move sideways for a bit now and spike upwards again and start the train again. 
Long@8805

Historically I've never managed to catch the bottom, so we've probably got some pain to come. Glad I've stuck with the plan of 8.8k buy in, even if GDAX was spazzing me out.
Tempted to consider this the bottom, high volume buying there. 

That or the edge of the cliff. 
[removed]
I said a few days ago (the day we broke past $9k) that we were not setting steady footing above $9000. That we would have a local top before testing $8000s again. That was my gut feeling, and I shared it. Looking back, the momentum after breaking $9k wasn't "right", it seemed too slow. 

With the benefit of hindsight, what could be some TA signals that could have been indicative of the local peak above $9k? Something I could have pointed to?

edit: fixed typo.
It is so interesting how ferocious the buying was at this level 3 days ago but now nobody seems to want it. Amazing what sentiment can do.

Edit: From a TA perspective the 12hr MACD has turned red which, during this bear market, has always led to a greater sell off. However, we have moved down very fast so I expect another DCB to maybe 9k before we continue downwards. I, personally, would love to see mid 7's again and see it hold. If we see mid 7's and bounce from there that would be another higher low and would be very bullish long term, imo. It would definitely give credence to the A&E double bottom at 6k. 
NASDAQ news getting viral over web. Volume going hell high. Bear can't resist more.
We are back to the wedge and already bounced from the top bound after the first drop to 9500 used it as support.
This wedge just doesn't give up. 
Interesting that a lot of shorts closed during this dip and aren't reopening. And who can blame the shorters?
My long stop loss turned into a margin short because I was too tired for having the right order amount inside it. Ah well, I will put stop loss for this above daily high and maybe hope 

Also shorting BTCBCH ratio from 0.16, 5% profit so far
So who thinks the BGD man will come back and save us?
volume is running insane on some alts. this movement is going to determine a lot.
longs still increasing...bounce is fueled by them. careful here. lots of potential downside
placing a small buy order at 9025 an the larger ones below 9000, just do not want to miss out completly. Anyways, I guess we will se 8.9 before we see 9.2
G'morning traders. Just got on the charts, (won't make a trade for at least an hour into the day, little rule i have) but on my charts i have 8200, maybe 8600, as our next horizontal support. 

Gonna be playing this safe again, like yesterday, after 4 green weekly candles I'm expecting a decent pullback with some sideways action for at least a day or two. 

Stay profitable!
[deleted]
Although I made small profit during these crazy last days I want boring bitcoin back now.
[deleted]
I think 9600 is going to be retested.
The 1hr RSI is still up at 40, the longer time frames still more overbought than oversold
Shit, amount of longs increased significantly during this dump. Same happened before the BGD at 6900: shorts were increasing, while price was stable. Are we gonna have long squeeze (or stop hunt) or something? E.g. towards 8800s
I've made some bad decisions in the last 16 hours.  I should have finished my long at 9700 last night, instead I let it ride and then stopped it at 9450 this morning.  For some reason I then opened another long at 9160 thinking we were gonna bounce straight back.  N00b!
Now I feel like I am in no mans land.  BTC can bite hard, hey! 
I bought the dip, expect a hard drop incoming!
Longs are 3:2 to shorts.  Probably not going to end well.
Nothing like a healthy correction in a post cryptowinter run.
To what degree will $10k memes/social media sharing influence BTC interest/price?

Many acquaintances of mine are still under the impression BTC is dead/crashed.
It's the old "let's drop BTC a little so all Alts can tank" trick...works every time, it seems...
Today I’ve managed to;

Open and close MULTIPLE shorts between 9030-9140 for a loss. My adrenaline rush of gains from the previous trades absolutely made me over trade. Had a game plan go bail around 9250 if it broke, but got worried and panic closed all of them between 9075-9175. 

I’m officially an addicted noobie trader. Yes I’m admitting to my FOMO trading problem. I feel like i ALWAYS need to have a position open. If I would have left my positions open, I would be up a significant amount of profit.

I feel like I’m a fucking broken record. I tell myself to do one thing, hold to it for 30 minutes then panic and run the other way. 

I suck. Crypto REALLY tests your patience.

Any advice on how to prevent yourself from making irrational and emotion trades? 
Looks like the daily is about to close with a bearish engulfing candle.
[deleted]
Woohoo. Closed my short at 8845 \(8800ish was my target irrc\) \(from 9350 earlier this morning\). That was a pretty good trade that  I followed through with. Scaled into it quite nicely.

I know folks here think anything related to being critical of tether is FUD, but this is comical.  130M created just as the bottom was about to fall out.  https://www.omniexplorer.info/address/1NTMakcgVwQpMdGxRQnFKyb3G1FAJysSfz
Boy, and I thought I was being smart by laddering buys at 9.2/9.3 last night. Liquidation awaits at 8.2 (I know, I know) and I'm going to guess if 9 doesn't hold this is going to get ugly fast. 
Well let's see at what number the panic sets in again. Just like every time this has happened before.

If it was a DCB.. Then anyone who got fucked on a long didn't learn a goddam thing.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/KLfAN8Xw/

The forth wave  dropped below the first wave for a little while this morning. That's not supposed to happen. There's probably more resistance around 10k than the recent runup appreciated.  Breaching the 23.6% fib caused a wave of exuberance from the bulls. Buy pressure is there, and bears seem to have become more timid. We're seeing a market that is deeply uncertain.

I expect to complete the fifth wave just a little above where the third wave ended and then go through another correction that will either bounce off 23.6% or dig deeper, perhaps to 8,500.
Seems as the BTC price has had a reality check while i slept. Holding my short from yeasterday to see where this goes.
If max pain is in play, this is going way lower. BTCUSDLONGS is actually increasing while BTCUSDSHORTS is decreasing.  This suggest people are leverage buying, and deleveraging their short.  Simply put max pain is when the two even out making and the market goes MUCH lower.
I call for Goblin Town in Mai. We just got hardly rejected at the 23.5&#37; fib level. weekly hammer formed now...    
[deleted]
Got in a hedge short at 9523, that 3% drop was the first real sign of weakness for a while now. FOMO may continue but we are so overdue for a pullback that I don't feel comfortable having no hedge position outstanding anymore. The delta between swaps, futures and spot makes no sense, and I'm not sure enough time has passed for people to just forget what blind FOMO has lead to not too long ago. Something's gotta give.
Been riding this bull wave but I'm shorting down from 9530 now. What a day!
4/25/18 AM UPDATE. Keeping this super brief. I expect us to bounce off ~$9088 within the next six hours. Per my post on [4/24/18](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8eho8a/daily_discussion_tuesday_april_24_2018/dxvaepn/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=user&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=frontpage), I was aiming to accumulate on Tuesday late night/Wednesday early morning Pacific Time. I will be watching to accumulate over the next few hours. Will post a longer update with charts in the next ~20 hours.
At lot of 0.001's on both sides of order book GDAX
BASTARD! Had an order at 9200 at bfx - missed it by half a dollar!
Entered a long at 9250, closed it at 9350. Scalped a little before as well, on the way down. I am sitting this out for the time being. 9200 held. Let's see where this goes
Breaking 9200 would complete a H&S pattern on the 15m with a target of 8,6/8,7k.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/bBthbP2M/
If the price stays above 9k until this time next week, we'll see a golden cross on the 3 day charts.  Be careful if you short here.
50 million$ Tether were issued to Bitfinex this morning and they are all gone so expect another issuance very soon. This has been fueled by panic on alt traders with Binance dragging the price down.
interesting [paper](https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/2018/02/13/the-case-for-central-bank-electronic-money-and-the-non-case-for-central-bank-cryptocurrencies) published by the federal reserve bank st. louis.

abstract: "We characterize various currencies according to their control structure, focusing on cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and government-issued fiat money. We then argue that there is a large unmet demand for a liquid asset that allows households and firms to save outside of the private financial sector. Central banks could offer such an asset by simply allowing households and firms to open accounts with them. Finally, we conclude that a central bank will not issue cryptocurrencies in the sense of a truly decentralized and permissionless asset that allows users to remain anonymous."
So I don’t know technical terms but I’ve been trying to learn. I’ve been holding a little bit for a few years and decided to see if I can increase what I hold by messing around with a little. With how much it jumps up and down would it even be realistic to try and make a little gain hoping it would drop into the upper 8000s? I sold at 9.5 so I would make a little profit but am I just getting greedy? Also any recommendations on where I can trade since I’m just using coinbase?
Coming from someone who stayed short and medium term bearish for too long and thought last week's run would reverse any minute, I'd be cautious about staying bullish and knifecatching. The same rules apply to overselling as to FOMO--the average person is not looking at RSI (though they are still not oversold on 4hr levels on up), but is looking at how this just dropped $1000 in 12 hours. Coupled with the fear of "Maybe the bear run isn't done after all" this could stay ugly for a while. 
So update on the picture with two warnings.

1. Low time frame
2. Predicting and trading corrections are tricky.

Expected retrace, that could be a valid Wave A for now came off the Wave 4 Support and a impulsive 5 wave count confirms for now. Is a small possibility of one more push lower but very small.

Looking for a retrace to the .5 from the high which would align with the new support turned possible resistance. This should happen as an ABC upwards. Plan to add to my shorts (Short the bounce) there. Added warning, B retracement of A is the hardest to predict and will dictate the rest of the structure.

(Extrapolating Predictions)
If that runs it will set us for a final C leg downwards towards the log channel where I anticipate a reversal once we confirm the old resistance as support, then MOON!

See a very messy chart if you wish, it might not make a whole lot of sense but putting it out there https://www.tradingview.com/x/KEuCPPdD/ 
So, what do we think? We bounce off 8600 and now we are around 8900. Just a bear flag?
So I had opened a new long at 9300ish and closed it at 9150 for a small loss.  We went to 9k and held, so I reopened it at 9150 but bigger.  I had buys down to 8800 that filled, doubling it down, and it was looking horrible.  But thankfully ca is below 9k though because of that.  So I closed half at BE and it's more comfortable.
 
Question remains to keep it open now or take this chance to close it all around BE.  (june swaps, which just lost its premium so these numbers are a little sloppy but trying to compare to the spot) 

Edit, closed that shit.  Red candle just told me to go away.  Still have a small short.

Buying that drop and reselling its bounce was really lucky that it let me close all this near BE.  Very asshole clenching.  Not sure if I can call that good RR or not, it was really just doubling down to recoup losses at the casino.
Well, we hit 9000 again. Decreasing volume, 1h MACD still bearish, but 1h stochastic RSI is oversold and has plenty of room to go up. I'm not bullish right now, (I'm basically just neutral), so I think that this might be a small bounce before we restest 8700 or so. Would give me a good short opportunity.
At which point do we determine that 8600 was the bottom?

[Peter thinks we are back in the game ](https://twitter.com/peterlbrandt/status/988930495433007104?s=21) 
Wow we are going down very fast. I'm starting to think that maybe I should not open a long at 9100 like I originally intended. Perhaps at 8600, but if we go below 8600 that's gonna be really bearish in my opinion.



Edit: Also horray, we haven't had any barts recently and the price movement is looking less staircase-like. I enjoy natural downwards movements more than staircase-like upwards movements.
DCB confirmed now?
I'm gonna keep buying till the premiums dry up at least. I think we'll bounce here or at the 2 hour cloud near 8870. stoploss 8500
Longs up 4200 so far. Adding to my short on any bounce

Longs up 400 more before i finished typing this comment looooool
closed my long at break even this is too scary! 

dont want to be a bag holder here. 
Don't think this drops through quite yet and we rebounce up to 9-9.1 before the fall through
This appears to be a dead cat bounce that'll run out of steam and fall back down.

[deleted]
Closing my long here from 8970. Betting on the further slow retracement till 9k due to profit takers (we were up for ~50%) and more brave new bears. 
This feels like last year all over again... i couldnt believe when i saw it climbing past 1200, then came the retrace to around 800 and i thought well as expected, but the bullrun after that... i wasnt around 2013, so that was my first major run and the buying pressure feels the same this time around.
i wouldnt long with leverage, but im certainly not selling a single coin.
Well, look i was right for once, very bullish how strong the 9k line is.
I sold. I think we're really pressing our luck.
this seems to be such a perfect bear flag! both lines cross in 10 minutes. 
The 1 Day RSI suggests this has much more room to go down before going back up.  Perhaps to 8k?
Do you guys remember that alt season after which BTC didn't retrace significantly and kept on going up instead?

Yeah, me neither.
Are we moving upwards with kinda low volume? 
longs are going retard again. closed my long and opened up a small short

**Scam Alert** KoinVX Discord Server and Mutual Fund Buckets

I was a part of a discord group called KoinVX from December of 2017 until early this month (April 2018). What I found out is sickening, and people continue to get scammed. Please, if it sounds too good to be true, it is. Although I never put any money into any of his MFBs, I know plenty of people who did and got either a small % or nothing back after asking for refunds. A prior mod exposed John Karl Robin after finding out what was really going on. Here's the proof. Protect your crypto, guys and girls.

Is there a trade option on Bitmex which allows you to close a short and open a long at the sametime using the same funds? 
[removed]
Woke up to long having been stopped out at 9300.  Some ups and downs later, I'm gently scaling into new small long at 9350.

Edit: closed that just above 9100 for a small loss I won't sweat.  After being in the red for the week until yesterday, then half a day in the green, I'm about break even.

Edit 2: we went lower, then 9k held.  Reopened long almost exactly where I closed it.   This better not turn into a cycle of losses in chop like last week.

are we still in the rising wedge?
Nope. Nope Nope. Wanted to short big at 9.4k. Ofc i didn't had the guts since my liquidation @ 7850.
You guys are great.  Noobie trader for sure, have not delved into TA, just keeping it simple until I have some time to study more.  I at least know to trade for satoshis now.  BUT,  I sold all my Alts and went 100% BTC at 9200ish...probably not the best strategy, but after losing so much early on, I was all about preserving gains, just moved my stops up, got stopped at at 9675....

I've been using basically that same strategy since I started following this group, just using your collective posts to figure out entry and exit points.  I've left alot on the table, but could not be happier with the results....so far.

I have my 7, 3, 30 and 66.  I know all the terms etc, just almost  nothing about TA.  Any advice on where to start?  I'm not for sure how much better I can do other than putting some leverage on what I come up with from the thoughts of this group. It has worked really well.  
If this doesn't bounce now, the 1 hour MACD will likely pull the 2 hour MACD into negative.  If we just bear flag another BRD could be on the cards.

Buy the dip or short the bounce, this is where you decide. In other news I wish the discount would come back on futures :D
lol, wth is happening on gdax
At 8660 we'll meet the ascending trendline from last year through 6k (red line). I'm kind of tempted to bet on it holding and buying back in there. But then this is dropping much faster than I had anticipated, and I'm not sure if buying in means catching the falling knife. On the other hand, I don't want to miss out in case 8660 will hold.

What are you guys planning to do here?
150$ bounce on Kraken. 
Margin Long ratio vs short has gotten pretty intense. Shy 60% longs vs shorts. Bullish sign? Haven't seen that so stark as a correction plays out in a while.

Interesting analysis in [this video by Real-Crypto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBOwPhLvQu0) where he discusses the similarities between the top at 11.7k on February 20 and today's local high of 9.7k. The volume pattern is quite similar and he makes a compelling argument as to why this may not be the start of a new bull run.

What do you guys usually set your stop losses at percentage wise? 
Tether printed 130 million more. Whether you believe it is real or fake money it doesn't matter. People treat it as real so that is 130 million injected in to bull this baby out.
Seems like the wedge is about to be broken if bulls cant get this above atleast 9.2K as that might serve as horisontal support for sideways consolidation. If that fails, my guess is retesting the low 8Ks or high 7Ks. Whatching this very closely and setting stops for my short above 9.2K
Whoever called bulltrap nice call.
[removed]
Bears are still chickens even in this situation. Are they waiting for better entry? Or do they think that this is little dip? Also buy walls constantly appears at finex with rising long leverage. I guess without those walls, the price would have been much lower. 
Incoming long squeeze. You heard it here, folks.  BRD back down to mid to high 7’s.
Brutal sell off. If we break down from here it looks like 7800 will be tested again. It does seem like we are finding some support at the bottom of the range, maybe we can chop between 8.8k-9k for a while. I would expect us to spend a little more time in that range before choosing a direction, but it appears we are just melting through it.
Did BTC developers resolved the "transaction stuck" problems or are transaction working just because no new people wants to buy BTC? What would happen if there was a buy run again? Maybe nothing, because transaction will get stuck as before.... 
funding pump time

we just broke 9000 (coinbase)

Is it only me or there are others who bought in back yesterday and sold today?

14% loss (held alts)

Edit: since the beginning of april was 50% up, so it's bearable. Don't want to rush now and "buy the dip" just yet, have a feeling we might can go lower 
[removed]
The amount of wild speculation going on here makes me believe that the bear/bull fight is on. What does that equal to? sideways movement until one gives in?
FINALLY interest rates are in favor of shorts and *massively*. Why did it happen when BTC fell though? Should be against shorts...
I'm just going through the babypips school and learning about forex. Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask but there's a lot of traffic here and you guys know about this stuff.

I'm not sure how it works with the going long and short. Long = buy, Short = sell. Ok. But in the tutorial it says something about just going short and locking in profits when the price goes down. Does that mean I can "sell" without buying first? I'm super confused and I hate it when tutorials aren't ELI5ing stuff that is obviously new to people.
Looking like a mini A&E bottom on the 15m, maybe?
[deleted]
Failure to break 9,2 sup/res feels like it doesn't bode well  for a bounce. 15m looking a bit bear-flagish to me.


That being said there's pretty clear hidden bullish div on 1h/4h.
https://www.tradingview.com/x/cdGQN7CH/

Nonetheless, I'm back into hedged short at 9180, will close if we hold above 9,2.
~20% of my fiat reinvested, but feeling like i'm catching a falling knife atm.


MACD very low. Methinks a small pump is incoming, perhaps back near 9500, before the market decides a long-term direction for good. Which could be up or down, who knows
closing my short form 9300 at 8800.  I think we'll go up some more before we fall again.
anyone actively trading today must need a xanax.
this is the time to sit back and let the market come to you.


now that it's cool off a bit, should expect to test 9.1-9.2k before going down further. like the bullrun we had last couple weeks, it doesn't just go up in one go
Back in at 8720 after getting stopped out at 8800 earlier on GDAX. I think this NASDAQ news will provide a big boost to the price today. Hopefully I'm right.
Stupid question, but how do I margin trade on Kraken using BTC as collateral. I don't want to have to covert to USD first (as its a taxable event) just to margin long on BTC. Can I convert some btc to another coin and use that? I'm in the US so not many options for margin trading.
lol @ that finex stop run on 8950, lets see what happens now

Is this not a typical bear flag, albeit small?
Incoming!

Looks like the big guy has some cashing out to do this morning.
I would expect to see a drop here to 8200/8300 where we will bounce hard from the resistance turned support line from ath. When it breaks through resistance as significant as that log downtrend from ath, it will have to check it as support before continuing upwards.
I'm currently underwater on a 5x long from 9581.  (also net positive on other larger unleveraged longs from lower down).

I'm expecting some bounce here as those who just sold the dip will start FOMOing.  Any advice for an exit point?

Thanks!
Has the bear market returned?
The pump was getting ridiculous anyways. Next level of support is at 7.8k, after that 7.5k. I would be surprised to see it break.
[removed]
The more volatility & panic pre-$10k the more sustainable the subsequent bull run. Welcome it.
Anyone else real salty they got stopped out of a great entry because of that GDAX bullshit and having the stop loss triggered based on the "mark" price which is half based on gdax. It's so hard to find a balance between with stop losses.

Need some advice: underwater long from 9.25 - if it hits B-E should I close?

And there goes 8800. Time to reevaluate and hopefully accumulate on this dip. /u/wardser, You were right. It looks like you were spot on your crash prediction. This could be going down for a while.


You have to give these big bears credit for trying.  Guessing they run out of coins before they get it to $8500.  Grateful for the discount. Buying with no leverage at $8600.

Tax hangover is real, this is still tax related.  Just like 2001, go study an old NASDAQ chart.  Early May saw ATL post bubble crash. 
Thanks for the insightful write up! You always post some pretty good stuff. I hope you are right about the low 9000s serving as support, I intend to open a long there, however I imagine that I will be slightly hesitant to do so, because you never know what could go wrong.


Has the last two weeks just been a big bull trap? I hope not. It doesn't seem like it is. But it's still possible.
you know that apple is gonna take their trillion $$ and just buy bitcoin with it.  What else is there to do with cash in the funny money economy?  It'll slosh around buying real estate commodities and bitcoin.  Trillions of $$ chasing a few 'stores of value' with nothing else to do.  You can only buy so many t bills.  Thank god steve jobs and crew all colluded to keep engineer's salaries in check, and used child labor to make their shit,  so all those profits can be put to good use.



The most annoying part is these people never come back and admit they were wrong. 

Well said. 
Over the past week the moonboys here did the exact same thing you describe.

"Opposing factions"? Get over yourself. This isn't a video game, this isn't politics, and it's certainly not sports. It's finance trading. Quit with the divisive bullshit. Seriously.
Well there's no way to have a healthy correction after a 43% rise with virtually no pullbacks. 

Just wish I added at $9.2 or $9.5 :( I forgot my "be greedy at the beginning of moves" rule 

I told you it'd visit $9.2ish before moving down :D I'm getting lucky today! lol 
Nice position. I was lucky to squeeze a tiny short in there at 8.9 before it fell off the cliff. 
This is not looking at all like any of the correction breakouts in previous years. Compare the Jan or Mar 2017 dips, for example.
Cool man!  Thanks the chart and comments 
> We can see here that we fell through the rising wedge on the daily

I already see the analyst coming out of you. Congrats for learning charts. 
Nice analysis. I'm long from 8990 with tight stops at 8930 just below the ascending channel you've drawn. I think if we fall out of the channel it won't just be for a quick hello. 
good analysis thanks! what do you think about this channel?

https://www.tradingview.com/x/HmyOdJH5/
Yes, I am always amazing how short sighted and fickle people tend to be in these markets.  A small move in the other direction completely shifts the outlook of some. 
Nice trade, I bailed on mine a little early, I got out after the first drop at 9210, I didn't want to leave it open after I went to bed
What support level do you have in mind/ do you believe the 9k level  will hold? 
Well played
Cool, going to keep following your calls. 
You are the man. 
Nice gain and good close.  Hourly RSI is approaching oversold. Already lowest since 4-17  
Did you get stopped on that long? 
Would you donthese more often, please.
Thank you for taking the time to do this TA. This is why I’ve been spending more time in this sub.
The obvious choice is to buy Coinbase/GDAX and integrate it rather than start from scratch.  Coinbase/GDAX adds AltCoins... helps write regulations, complies with regulations, and then Brian Armstrong buys Zuckerberg's island and burns it to the ground.
A couple of things I'm watching:

- the descent was much sharper than last nights ascent (this is also visible as the wide 1h MACD spread currently passing down the midway point)

- falling through 9000 here would confirm falling out of the ascending wedge/channel for the first time after BGD

- as already mentioned here, longs are rapidly increasing, buyers are expecting this to recover fast. If the increase in longs stops or turns to a decrease instead, it could be a pretty good indicator of a sentiment change from "buy the dip" to "this is actually a serious consolidation"

- alts have fallen 5-7 times more than BTC at this point
very poised
nice analysis, I have the same view

edit: didn't see the falling wedge though, nice catch
Great info ~ thx a lot!
When you say 2% stops do you mean 2% of the price movement or 2% PnL?
The dip's over.  Volume is falling off and price is going up.  Might be one more desperate dump, but it's time to cover pretty soon.  Lots of forced buying.   

If you shorted the dip, congrats on your luck.  Buy yourself some champagne.  Trend is still up.

Bullish.
Btc was heading to 10k yesterday and now it’s going to 3k. Bless this place.
you have to know who to listen to...and that includes who to listen to as a contrary indicator. 

if you listened to the smart bulls and smart bears here you'd generally have some really good entries

lotta people here calling for imminent massive bull run and ATHs yesterday...should've been a signal for at least a local top. 43% run up with only a tiny pullback is not sustainable at all.

When the moonkids start asking "but *why* do we have to have a pullback?" you should probably prepare for a dump 

but yes this place is a shitshow because people over trade wayyyy too much. the space is full of very impatient people, that's why we're here and not putting this money in index funds :)
I really don't think there's any issue changing your stance a lot and quickly. No use sticking to a bad position just for the sake of a prediction that has become invalidated, even the "best" traders here do it.
This was me a while back..

Hangout here enough and look at BTC charts enough and you will have a “ General “ idea of what’s going on. After a 10% drop you should never sell everything considering the trend is up right now, a bounce was imminent, and we had a 8750 support level, selling wasn’t the best idea 
That was me on Feb 6th, education isn't free.

It was a lesson that cost me 20k
> Definitely I'm a useless trader, yesterday I knew a reversal was inminent, but I couldn't pull the trigger and go fiat at 9750, and today I panic sold at 8820

Honestly I think that's how everyone starts, you learn from your mistakes. Putting it all in cold storage is ok too though.
Wishing I put my in fiat at 9750 as well but it was moving so well I figured I'd let it go. Even if it retraced I didnt think it would be that much. I still kinda feel we're going to blast through $10k soon.
Check out VEN and AMB for alts, they take up 65% of what I hold.
Putting your stash in an investment and then "forgetting all about it" is even a worse strategy than not selling as the price slowly drops 10% before your eyes.  

Anyway, you probably would improve as a trader over time.  I have made every dumb mistake possible, but over time, the frequency of those screwups diminishes.   
Eh, I had this drop charted as well and didn't act on it either. But don't give up. It's barely above where you sold, You could get back in right now with only the teensiest of losses. Or set a buy at like 8815 and wait to see if a little low wick catches you soon. 
Were up 100 from your sell. I wouldn't encourage fomo buying back in right now. 
For now is just caution, if 8500 falls sweating starts, 8000 will bring doom and thats when we start climbing again :) 
What about the other two weeks of gains?
Usually I have more contrarian tendencies, but in this case I have to admit I'm a bit reassured I'm not the only one

FWIW, high volume is often an indicator of a reversal.

How do you know the volume is an individual seller? When I sell > 5 bitcoin, the orders get filled in many smaller increments unless the volume is there at the time.
Really enjoy these posts, thanks for keeping them coming!
Interesting, thanks
This leads me to believe there's way more down coming.

There are a lot of dumb retail shrimp clamoring "BTFD!!" right now.
What you've just described is the mechanics of institutional order flow (essentially how bigger players engineer liquidity for their buys or sells). Really nice introductory/explainer video here if anyone is interested: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ffxSdX48VI

Thanks for sharing this.

Another lesson, taking profits never hurt you.
Never worry about taking profit. What ifs are a real killer
That wasn’t an idiotic move. It was a smart move to take profit. Greedy people get burned, u made a good trade! :-)
If the move is only smart in hindsight, it wasn't smart. But, you're right. Have a target and stick to it.
this dump is going to be decisive again: if it bounce decently from here, given the volume, we are going to see a new high.
MEX just had $6bn in 24h volume lol. Crazy 100x yahoos.

Stop shorting, go long
Hey yolotrades. The sub certainly misses you. I don't know why you want to get exposure at the GBTC. The premium is too high, the fees will eat significantly your profits over the years, you have no control over your coins (ie: they sold bch)

Is it taxes or just worrying about holding raw BTC?
Christ, thought you're dead or something.

Welcome back.
As of the last review of it (6 months ago or so), the SEC was holding it's original position.
I made a topic about it some weeks ago: "[Is there still hope for a bitcoin ETF this year?](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8a7ii3/is_there_still_hope_for_a_bitcoin_etf_this_year/)" Just bitcoin future ETFs though. And I do not really expect an ETF this year, but there is some "hope" left.
Post more often bro, BTW barrys etc fund ETCG just listed and trading at a massive premium.
Been a lot of pushing and shoving between 9000 and 9200 over the last 3 hours or so. If we break below 9000, it’s gonna be a long drop. If we move strongly up beyond 9200 with volume, I’ll close this short and open long. These next few hours (or days?) are very important. 
nice play!
Looks like that might be happening now.
All in huh...

If low leverage I like it though.
Wrong about what?
Who was wrong? 8)
10% (buy the) dip is far from the best Bitcoin has seen. 
you have a chart to show me?
the pullback on alts with this much BTC volatility (up and down) is quite normal. I'm 100% in alts right now and my only concern is BTC. 

Everybody knew this pullback was coming and much needed. 
A lot of people are expecting bounces imminent but panic selling could just as easily start picking up. Most people expected one one at 9.1/9.2k
Alterantively we may see a relatively flat ABC and a large wave 3 from that, due to upward buying pressure.
Thanks, indeed a new downtrend, with 3 contact points. That's a very compelling scenario. With this in mind, probably gonna sit on my hands for the rest of the week.


This is fine.
I like him because he's more self aware than he pretends to be...but it's a good cover. Pretend like you're a perma bull for jokes and when it goes up you get to say you were right. If it goes down you just say you were fucking around
short swaps, long futs and hope that discount doesnt appear
I opened on swaps precisely for this. Awesome! 

Does the predicted funding rate generally hold true? or will that change? Because it's 0.3% in 9 hours as well 

0.675% in 9 hours would be cool
Y'all got any more of that free money?

Edit: In their last digest, bitmex outlined a strategy: Open a position before funding and close it 8 hours later.
we still have a few days before it close.. anything can happen
It's only wednesday. I doubt we are at this price at the weekly close.

ETA: I do think that we have rejecting from a key level that is very significant on higher timeframes though. I just don't want to read into the structure of the incomplete weekly candle.

https://imgur.com/nZXYL7J
We set a lower high, if we set a higher low this week then we will be tightening the equilibrium which will lead to a strong break. Most would consider this a good thing, though it can be painful in the process.

Agreed with /u/Trk-

Good post, but 100% of your scenarios have us going up. This seems like an oversight. 
Nice great post once again. I'm weirdly proud to have the same channel as you : https://www.tradingview.com/x/ucvAF8ld/

No bearish case though? 
[This](https://s3.tradingview.com/f/fxgzeQKA_mid.png) is how I read this chart.
Can you specify the exact reasons why you think we won’t be seeing lower levels than now? 
[deleted]
Very insightful. With all the above probabilities, one can conclude that the market is starting to get bullish again.
I'm still old me.
It's easy to say "I knew it"...after the event has happened...
LOL!

This is what I have been working on in 2018, sticking to the fucken plan. I could count at least 5 individual times where my strategy would have ended my positions in profit, but the old brain takes over and says otherwise. 

Last night for example, closed my long wayyyy to early and missed out on some nice potential gains. But tis a learning experience :)
Yes this 100%. I've been sucking quite a lot with my trade this week because I was acting on impulse and not rationally. Yesterday while watching this thing pump to 9700, I resisted the fomo and established a plan: I put a lot of small (0.1 or 0.2) btc longs from 9200 to 8800. They all hit. I was a bit afraid right there but told my self that I would close at a loss only if 8700-8800 broke. 

In the end my average entry is 9000 and it could have been better but I don't really mind, if I had waited for the bottom I would probably have been afraid and I wouldn't have go for the long, and I would have fomoed at 9050.

I'm going to put a stop loss at 8890, and I will also close my longs in layer from 9800 to 10k (which is the top of my channel).

Stick to your plan!
Remember folks, stick to your plan....oh man is that true.

Not sticking it one, cost me several thousands of dollars today. 
Dude you got trapped in your own trades.
This to be confirmed reversal has stop hunt on all the directions, it’s like whales decided to rekt everyone either long or short.
Bearnance?
I didn't realize binance was so low. I thought gdax was leading it. 40 bucks below bfx
was even crazier before: binance 9120 bitmex 9350

needless to say, many tethers were spent
use trailing stops. you could have taken profit at 9700?? what does that even mean?
You are aware that makes no sense. A long at 9150 should not have a stop HIGHER than the entry - that would be a stop for a short, not a long.
Just look at the mex perp funding. Pretty good too indicator. Bull euphoria was reached. 
GDAX is about to break under $8600 and it doesn't look like it's letting up that much.  This is nasty.  $1000 off the price in like 12 hours is pretty brutal.

I guess I would be going long here but I don't trust anything right now.
lol
This is typical for GDAX. They lead in both directions, but they aren't pulling hard.
GDAX has the newer, less experienced people trading on it. Emotions run higher there. Assume Bitfinex has the more accurate price, and assume GDAX is overreacting.
So did I. It happens. 
I got so lucky, was sitting on the sidelines and checked it when I walked into work. Got back in at 8690 when binance and finex were at 8850 already. 
Whatever you do; do this too: take an imaginary $1000 and pop it into Blockfolio app or delta. Then in one years time, compare your strategic trading with simply holding. Note the results and move on accordingly. 
Don't try target trading. It's not very effective. If you really want targets, look for resistance zones on the chart. Use them to calculate your risk to reward ratio. 

Scale in and out of positions, don't take the full trade at once. I often buy at support zones and don't even use stops or very low ones where I know I have to get out of the market. For example today I bought a bit of BTC at 8600, sold a bit on the bounce, will let it ride down to 8200, repeat to 7800 but I will get out if it goes below 7500, while keeping my short open from 9700.  

It's more important to learn to get a feel for the market than using TA formations to know what the market is going to do. You should know that you have to get out when the market goes parabolic and full fomotard like yesterday. I don't need to know it's a rising wedge or w/e. Markets always reverse to the mean, that's why moving averages are actually pretty useful. The more you get extended, the higher the probability it comes back down (or up in a downtrend).
start with a test account and then trade
I'm fairly new to this too, but I'd steer clear of using a pre-determined profit/loss as your basis for entry/exit. I tend to get too emotionally tied to a position when I approach it that way. Using the numbers you proposed, I'd be more prone to let a nice exit at $1.75 profit slip away only to take the $2.00 loss because I was paying more attention to my profit goal than the market.

I think you'd be much better off taking the time to learn some basics of trends, support, and resistance to plan your trades. It will help improve the timing of your trades and allow you to set more realistic goals for profit/stop loss. 

If you stay away from leverage while you're learning, trades with 10% of your stack (edit: and reasonable stop losses) aren't going to make or break you. Assuming it's all money you can stand to lose, I think live trading is much more beneficial than paper trading so you can learn to control the emotional side of it.

Good luck, have fun, and may your tuna subs be plentiful.
you can always play around with bitmex testnet to get a feel for things. If you're trading with 2$ profit targets you're probably just gonna have your profits eaten by fees, tbh.
Yeah it’s Safe and good for learning.

Also rule of thumb to keep in mind is to buy into aggressive red, sell into aggressive green. Don’t give in to fear or FOMO 

Also learn to draw lines and analyze charts from people that are more  experienced on here. 
Decent plans, but if your R/R strategy is 1:1, either the trade is bad or your management of it is insufficient.  Try to go for situations where you think you can get 2:1 more easily.
You want to look for trades that have good risk reward. That means if you risk $2, you want to profit more than $2 when the trade goes in your favor. 3:1 risk reward is good (some people go for 2:1 but many trades offer 5:1 or better)). So if you bought 8900 and stopped out at 8700 you might want to have a take profit of around 9500. Or you could stop loss at 8800 and have take profit at 9200. So the key is to look for trading set ups where the entry, stop loss, and take profit all line up to give a good risk reward. Then, based on your overall risk tolerance  (typically 1-3% of your trading stack), you decide your position size. So if the stop loss is wide you take a smaller position than when you have a tight stop loss (keeping your total max $ loss per trade fixed).

I'm confused. You waited for this channel to break before going long but somehow managed an entry of $8800?
Yup. That level of bounce is what I'm expecting as well.
Same on 'mex, just dwarfs all recent candles (ie the last month)
the open interest hasnt changed much at all though
944 for apr
1.15K for may
it was about the same yesterday
maybe its just open interest for the contract on my brokerage

This is great. Time to build a new PC. 7970 not cutting it anymore.

They are on a bit of a lag. At current prices mining is a very good ROI. (If you think BTC will float above 8k longer term)

Take a longer view on the market, invest rather than trade. Get your updates daily and remove constant access to market data. 

Time and time again in markets of all sorts I've never been able to beat just doing good upfront research and picking a solid company\asset\cryptocurrency early and sitting on it for the long-term.

Also don't put all your funds in at once - i.e. keep 50% of the money you have invested in BTC on the sidelines so if it dips hard you can drip some more in but if it takes off then you win too.

Hedge and\or diversify.
Zoom out and work with higher time frame charts (e.g. daily).
Yes.
Have a longer plan and have stops set. Chasing the bottom and the top is what keeps you glued.

That's what gets me.
You don't get the perfect position unless you obsess over charts. 

Set alarms for important price points and set aside an hour a day to study charts. When alarms are hit, evaluate signals and act accordingly.

Or enter on low leverage when the market enters the general vicinity of your signals. If the move event happy goes your way, increase position size and walk away with stops at BE or whatever. 

If it doesn't go your way, add even lower (or higher) and watch charts for 24-48h. Or just wait for it to go your way. 
Learn how to code and write a bot.

You can also 'invest', but be prepared to lose it all.
You have to much at risk if you feel that much anxiety.  I'm playing with all house money; so my risk is technically zero, BUT it's still a large amount and enough to stress me during periods of high volatility. It's just part of it and for me the rewards have been worth it. Like all things in life, no risk no reward. To be clear though, this is still not rent, collage or retirement money. If I lost it all, I'm still in a great position. Get use to massive ups and down and/or lower your risk. It also gets easier if your losses are not money you've invested, but just "profits" going up in flames. 
Swing trading has reduced stress and allowed me more time away from charts. Find your entries/exits, set limit orders and stops and just walk away. 
people who margin trade have a lot more to say from day to day. Me,  DCA in and sell high. Not much to speculate about, not much to say in a comment.
Best advantage of margin trading is not putting all your coins on the exchange. Typical use case, with 5% of cold storage on the exchange, you go 10x short.

* Price up 10%, you lose the 5%, but the 95% cold storage appreciates 10% (~4.5% fiat gains, 5% BTC loss)

* Price drops 10%,  you end up with 5% more BTC, BUT in fiat your 105% BTC depreciated by 10% (~ 5.5% fiat loss, 5% BTC gains)

You can chose different numbers for the trading stack % and the leverage to achieve a particular target (maximize fiat or BTC) with less exposure to market movements and exchange risk.
Technically buying is going long.

Some people substitute shorting for selling, too. Like afaik chewy says he's short but he's actually flat

But yes, given the pitiful volume on GDAX (although increasing lately) you're the minority now 
margin trading brings greater profits or worse losses. But more important it also amplifies stress. So if you get stressed sometimes i don't recommend it. Also be aware being a bagholder without margin isn't usually that bad with Bitcoin as long as you keep your trades small, eventually your trade will make profit again. I find this an excellent strategy if you suddenly lose due to a huge swing and cutting your losses is hard for you...

Edit: I'm just saying there are great benefits margin trading, but there's also a huge risk with it, limiting your investing options. There's no shame in not margin trading. 
i thought you were short. also you panic sold.

I think more downside is possible, however Bitfinex only allows 3.3x leverage, so a liquidation squeeze isn't really on the table. Beyond that, longs have proven notoriously hard to mentally squeeze.

If GDAX had margin trading then yeah, the price could've flash crashed to sub-$7k this morning.
We shall call him.. *The FOMO Enforcer!*
swaps can do that. Also, if a lot of shorts are closing and/or buy the dip mode, then it could be expected
Bitmex is not an exchange.  The swap market tracks the exchange rate by design, but there will be lag in certain situations.  
Overleveraged traders with >10x dont want to close their long positions with huge loss, and waiting for some kind of miracle to get at least breakeven. 
Yes, you have to use stop market if you want to be sure it executes.  Otherwise, your limit order may never get executed if the price falls straight through your stop. 

The stop market may have significant slippage in that scenario, but it will execute.  
I think your order just could not find any taker when the price crashed. I'm pretty new, that's why i just use stop market orders that should not fail. I think next time you work with a stop loss limit order you should also put a stop market order below, just to be on the safe side and avoid liquidation.
My guess is that because you used a stop limit rather than just a stop market the price exceeded your limit in one way or the other too quickly and you were unable to get filled. Use stop market for stop losses.  
did you have post only selected or something? 
ETH ratio just got hammmmered in the last day
I'm glad I wasn't the only one who noticed that. It was like the opening scene in Pulp Fiction when Bitcoin (the woman in this case) stands up and screams 'Nobody move this is a robbery' and everything just stopped except for btc.

Like water on a pond motionless while bitcoin raged on.
Also noticed that and pondered setting a stop loss on my eth stack just below yesterday's high. But you can take a guess whether I actually did it.
The way I see it, alts just experienced their 100% move.  A rally that BTC got in February.  Alt ATH came during BTC's bull trap move to 17k in January.

The alts seem to be 1 cycle behind BTC at current time.  After the 50% BTC run the last 2 weeks i am expecting an alt run of 50% in the not too distant future.  If the pattern persists ETH will make a double bottom similar to our recent one and make a move up to around $550.
do you have a chart for this? 
Looking horribly bearish on the daily right now though. Full on bearish engulfing.

Here's to hoping, though.
A bullish hammer would be a hanging man, which is not bullish.
We bounced off rising support, so that’s a pretty good sign. It was a little more than 10% actually. I’m glad we got this pullback though, that growth was unsustainable I think.



In my opinion we might retest that rising support one more time, that would confirm it as very strong support and also act as a double bottom.
I’m personally looking to either 

Short at 92-9300
Or
Long at 8750-8850 
Can't believe I could've just left my long open. Lost so much closing that. 
It is hard to say right now what a good entry point might be. For me a good entry point is something where I know that I will be in green shortly after opening it.

I had a long from $8,955 from two days ago, which at the time of opening wasn't a good entry, but then it caught the green candle and I rode this trade all the way to the daily high, ended up closing it just above break even today. So yeah, it is difficult to determine. 

Monitoring how the market has been behaving in the past 6-12 hours could give you good ideas.
I wouldn't trade around 9.2. It is a possible bearish rejection point (so permabears will short there and scalpers will take profit), but it's not really a significant level. It's pretty much the middle of the range.
Sit back and wait for Chew to drop a post in the sub 
I've been scaling in sells since 9080. I like you hope this isn't the beginning of a silly bullwhale dork.
exactly how i read it.
I think this wants to test 8.8, the old log support that held up on the most recent bounce. And then I wouldn't be surprised by either a bounce up to 9.2/9.3 or if heavy selling picks up and drops us through.
Yesterday's open?
And Tweezer tops
Looks like a bearish engulfing to me, with higher volume
If we fail to go lower we can continue onwards in a parallel ascending channel, but my gut says we'll go lower. I think we need to retest the descending log line, or at least come close to retesting it. I think the magnitude of the dump from 9.7 will end up being close to that of the green candle that kicked this whole thing off.
Yes it would be pretty bullish, but no the timeframe would be too short to really call it a double bottom.

EDIT: Note that I mean it would be bullish if we actually reversed here, not if we just linger here a while. Reversal wouldn't be confirmed until solidly/convincingly over, say, 9250.
So a bounce back to 8975-9050 then next target 8.2k? 
I would depend more on the descending log at 8.2.  Wedges that aren't a week old are a coin toss lately.
You mean short?? A win is a win man. Night 
What do you make of longs going parabolic during this dip?
Seriously. Top-3 holders on OKEx *added* to their position...

Healthy growth? Madness! In all seriousness, that would be great to see. 
That sucks! Sorry to hear that buddy. Just out of curiosity, did you lose most of your stack from a few big bad trades, or was it a lot of small bad trades that stopped out that ate away at it? I'm a bit of a novice so I want to know what to watch out for.

Best advice is that in the future you don’t make a move after it dumps or pumps. You canmt go wrong if you’re a spectator. Make moves before thye happen
Bad trade is when you take huge risk on small reward, not when you lose money. Your entry was a bit high but still was good r/r, break of 8.8 was a good stop. From TA point was proper trade, it just didn't make profit. It bounced but it didn't have to.
Take today to really solidify the lesson learned. You will come back stronger with more discipline and experience another day.

It's not a bad trade if it makes you a better trader in the end.
[deleted]
Generally you will have a lot of trades that are equally profitable and loss inducing. 

You make your money by:

1. limiting the size of your losses
2. taking profits on small wins to offset small losses when the move is looking weak
3. most importantly, let winners ride. These will generate the majority of your profits in the end.

This is the core of trading, asymmetric risk/reward trading.

An example of how a trader generates large profits by cutting losses early and cutting weak winners early. This is generally what a more experienced trader with good risk management trades history will look like:

+$300

-$300

+$300

+$300

-$300

-$300

-$300

+$7000

-$300

-$300

-$300

-$300

+$3500

etc

Notice there are more losses than winners but you'd still be up $9000
Move your profits away, trade with the same amount every time.

F.ex. if you trade with 1k and make 250 profit then move it so that you'll have 1k visible. If you lose 250 then trade with 750 until you're back to 1k.

Psychologically you won't afford to lose.

This is bitcoin.
That is how it rolls.  It doesn't matter if its $12 or $12,000.  It has done this since the beginning of our journey.
Change your strategy and study what you are doing wrong 
Sounds like you have a high variance strategy.
Easy. There's no excuse for you to be having a double digit drawdown from a single loss. First, start using stop losses.
All of the above! Try to internalize that winning multiple times in a row is an outlier event — stop yourself before reversion to the mean kicks in.
> "don't trade for a day"

I found this to be a very good strategy that minimizes the errors in your decision making and avoid impulsive buying (which is mostly not beneficial). Set your targets, try not to open more than two trades within a week, or just be yourself and follow your heart.

At times, I have lost more money just by opening and closing more trades in a given day.
Are you trading your entire account every day?

Pick your time tables and amounts with care, there should be days where your like "nah I don't like the look of this chart" and you do nothing
Day trading is white collar gambling.  You are no more likely to improve your day trading gains than you are to do well at the roulette table in Vegas.  The quicker you accept this, the better.  There are patterns to price movements, but there is no sure way to predict what 100k people in this space may do tomorrow or what news will break.

Good value analysis, however, is very likely to yield great returns over a long period of time.

That run also had several 10+% retracements, while this is our first major one and it hasn't even been 10% yet. Something to keep in mind.
9200 might hold

Edit: if not then its 8900
just bounced off the top of the 30 min cloud. if we fall thru, the bottom of the 30 min cloud and top of the daily are 9150ish. should offer some relief

also, i think the ascending wedge people have been talking about for the past few days sits around 9100
8.6, 7.8 I guess?

Hard to call it major but I don't wanna admit 6.5
everyone is afraid after taking a four months beating by bitcoin
I still bet on the wedge even though it broke yesterday, should have been a fomo induced fake out. If it goes up again we Will see if its bound by your channel or the wedge 
Good. Matter of time.
We've broken the bottom line now on my version, yours too?
I think we'll see a little bounce from wedge support here before continuing the descent, let the shorter time frames cool down etc etc. 

I'll be opening my short then i think, hopefully it doesnt keep falling without me :l
Ah geez, I didn't even see that falling wedge.  It's tip lines up with some log support (which is same support as feb 6th 6.0 and march 18th 7.2 lows) so that would support your idea.
If that's fib support, it also coincides roughly with 8-month log support. That's an excellent long r/r position.

> which means understanding the type of people buying and selling at any point in time ends up being critically important information.

> just how disconnected the perp swaps, futures and spot markets were getting and how so few of the retail investors saw that something's gotta give

I think you've identified two really critical questions that we are going to have to confront again and again going forward. The market behaves very differently depending on who's driving it at any given moment, and it's really important to infer who's in the driver's seat, and to recognize points where there's been a changing of hands. Unfortunately, its almost impossible to read these things straight from the price charts with any certainty -- we don't get separate charts for institutional and retail investors. Still, it seems likely that the activity at the beginning of this rise was driven by different types of investors than the activity towards the end of this drive. To me it looks like big-pocketed investors goading along a rise by buying away any potential breakdowns until retail FOMO takes over. There was a similar pattern in the rise from 5.9k. Although, I'm sure there are alternative explanations (interested to hear any).

I see interactions between spot, OTC, margin, and futures markets having growing market effect with time, as we've seen with (a) massive squeezes and (b) decoupling between futures and more-FOMO-driven spot prices. It will be helpful going forward to catalog the types of interactions we see and to predict other possible interactions.

Eager to hear your write up.
TA is not "transferred from the equity markets," it's been used across many types of instruments in financial markets for several centuries, not just equities.
Looking forward to your write up, your post are very insightful.
Great assessment. The entire crypto market including BTC trades like penny stocks of old, though with (generally) more liquidity than the pennies had. Volume and volume indicators, along with an attempt to empathize with the various whales and their aims, are paramount to understanding what's going on. Instead I see most people trading off of TA that should really only be used for forex.

Looking forward to your writeup.
That's what happens when the price goes up too fast, you run out of buy support.
profit taking. longs from way below and underwater longs will both be quick to take profits when they're threatened 

that's why pullbacks are good, it gives longs a chance to take profits and take a breather without feeling like it's going to collapse all in one second
because once a blow off top happens, the bottom for the movement can be anywhere.

essentially all the pump chasers are waiting for a better price...and and everyone else is now waiting for a bounce to take their profits 
> would think the bulls would be smarter

Perhaps it was Europe waking up and selling off. Hopefully North America will pick up all the cheap coins when they wake up in the morning.
Me too if it broke $10000 i was out, short from $8060
congrats on your strong hands!  Where are you riding that one to?
I closed mine from 9.2 at just under 9k. Don’t want to get greedy, and I’ve been brutalised over the past day so taking gains where I can.

Nice work by the way.

That's the reason I don't margin, you need to be correct on time scales smaller then what your actually trading on

We pumped 50% in 2 weeks. A pullback is normal.

You will never get a lambo from Crypto, if you bought anywhere even remotely close to here.

Can you all just act like adults
Why here? :) Not saying it's a bad entry, but it's a good idea to write down why, even just for yourself.

That way if it goes right or wrong you'll be able to add it to your arsenal of knowledge and experience 
Well, i'd say that worked out nicely, you managed to hit the top almost exactly! ;)
Kinda of an interesting entry point. 

I cant really talk because I’ve been over trading like a MOFO and have erased nearly all my gains + some in last 3 days today. 

Take my advice with a grain of salt, being new I advise to wait for an obvious entry point instead of just yolo positioning something ( not sure if u yolo’ed or have indicators you are trading on) but right now seems like not so good of a place to trade 
Legitimate question: Did you follow through with the stop at 8950?

I struggle so hard with following through on stops, it's my biggest weakness trading.  I usually manually stop so i'm not caught on wicks but then i hold for much longer than I should hoping it'll turn around.
congrats you just made a 50/50 trade like the rest of us do.  Next time try tails.

> The bounce off that will determine if were bear for the next 6 months or not. 

6 Months? Where's that number coming from?

> Edit: keep an eye on longs for this dump. If they keep adding all the way down to 8.2k we are f u c k e d

Honestly, that's what worries me most at the moment. 4000 BTCs of longs have opened alone on the first phase of this pull-back.
No Tether left on Bfx
Some big shorts closed into it.
Staring at an order book will do nothing but drive you to make the wrong decision 
One thing to note is that there can be hidden walls (on BFX). If there are a lot of sells at a specific price point and no movement, that would indicate a bigger hidden buy order.
Better to watch 15~1 minute charts and look at the inertia IMO for that.

Not necessarily. We're in a downward channel off the top: https://www.tradingview.com/x/gEkikbmZ/

Purple is the 8-month log support line and what I'd consider the floor zone currently. If it falls, it wouldn't be good. It does feel like we've bottomed for this drop, but the bounce has been mild. 
This is what i'm eyeing as well. as of typing this the current 1h candle is flirting with the last green candles high
I tentatively think so. But time will tell. It's a full 24 hour retrace anyway.

What do you think? 
you are on about 5x leverage; currently have about 25% loss. 

If you are trading with your whole stack (and lost 25% of your portfolio on half day), this is already too much, and sloppy risk management; in this case, I would close position before more damage (9050-9100); you can always re-open if we consolidate for some while above $9000 and it has proven to be solid support (this is not a certainty at all right now)

if you are trading with just a small part, this is not the end of the world, just keep it open; personally I would be surprised that we go below 8750, very surprised if ge below 8500 (previous breakout point), and eat my hands if we go below 8300 (+/- current downward log line). If you are trading with a small part of your stack I would take the odds of this not happening; personally, I expect us to be higher than 10k in the next couple of weeks (but prepare to be wrong).

in the end the choice is yours, I am only saying I would never risk losing everything, even 25% is already too much (your risk tolerance may vary)
If you think the price is more likely to go up, then hold.  If you think it is going down, then sell.    I am long here and my entry price doesn't matter at this point..neither does yours.
sell that shit now.  you made a leveraged long at the top without stops and got boned.  its time to cut your losses at this point and salvage what you can.
9.2 is the old support of the rising wedge so most likely there.
Both make a lot of sense. 
[deleted]
9250
Ide assume some type of rejection off 9.2k but to be quickly bought up since we found the local bottom. 


I think 9.8, inch by inch towards 10k, because round numbers are magic and we haven't really done the song and dance for a new digit. 
8.25

He makes it look a lot easier than it is, but it's quite effective if you have time to watch the charts. 
I would note that in 2014, the breakout/fakeout was from a descending triangle, but this looks more like a falling wedge .

Same again lol. 

Long 9044,9075,9101! 

We always seem to have the same trades 
Breaking below the log line support of 8.5 is not good for anyone but a bear looking for sub 6k. 
So I guess the NASDAQ news today didn't make a damn bit of difference. Bizarre.
'Ceo said he may also have Frosties for breakfast tomorrow'
Yep, it stopped me out for a modest profit from ~8800. Gonna stay in cash for the time being. The rejection came lower than I expected, but there should be an opportunity to re-enter a bit lower. 
If any of them will have half a brain, they have kept their fingers on the triggers. This sub has been waiting for the correction for 3-4 days now. So might become a kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Looks like a flat bottom on the candles. While still true, it’s usually a weaker signal. 
> People are buying without any reversal signa

We just broke the log resistance line from December, that's pretty significant.
If we consider posts around here a contrarian indicator, this shit should be off to 100k in a jiffy. People have been clamoring for a dump to hell ever since the first green dildo, and apparently no matter what the price does it's not good enough for the bears to even consider that a reversal might be possible. Big green dildo, not good enough. Slow sidewayish grind up, not good enough. Breaking long term downtrend resistance, not good enough. Seriously starting to get 2017 flashbacks with people refusing to believe this thing can in fact just go up for a while.

The dump so far has been a completely normal and expected technical correction and unless at least 8900 support zone goes, no reason to think otherwise and spread doom and gloom. 
The old Hit-It-And-Quit-It Reversal.
Gave it a read, wouldn't we need another bump twice the size of the initial BGD during this run phase? Or are you looking after the initial spike? May have read that wrong but interesting nonetheless. He should have named it the Bump-And-Run-Trend (BART) that way we could all put on our tinfoil hats. 
I can't draw any of the angles it discusses. They're either too shallow or too steep in comparison between lead\-in and bump.

If I measure the lead in from the 20th April and then the bump from the 24th I can achieve 31/54. That's over the 50&#37; increase.

The 'pattern' is there but I'm not convinced the numbers add up. I'm not sure I'm buying into the idea of a bull trap this long and extended, with increasing volume.
Informative link, thank you
90$ discount on GDAX, no buy orders there, it's going down there's no cooloff imo
I agree.
Not gonna call you out. This IS good for bitcoin
9100 is a bad spot in my opinion. Either above the bottom of the wedge @9200ish or short bellow @9000 if it breaks down with conviction 
Basically we have a lot of potential areas of support, and we can bounce off of any of them. Will we see sub 9000 today? Chances are looking higher, but I don't think this is the end of the bull rally we have been in.
rip
Ide like to short around 8950 with target of sub 8750 

Edit: I was originally thinking to short around 9200 but not sure we have legs to get there yet .

I’m probably just overtrading 
[deleted]
The one time I was happy to have a good position and this guy has to go and blow it for me.
Where do you see log support?  The old log downward resistance line is now at 8k.  The 3 day long term moving average is at 8750, which is where we are as I type.

/s, right?

Going down again already:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/1AFULy3Z/
Something like this would be painful: https://www.tradingview.com/x/Qm5dFDgP/

But that's not max pain IMO. This is max pain: https://www.tradingview.com/x/b99IoRvJ/
The aggregate of human psychological weaknesses that make up the market will induce maximum pain itself, no need for you or any other boogeyman to do it. 
It would make sense, but longs are up ~~7%~~ 9% in this dip vs 2% shorts.  Bears are biding their time, bulls are over confident.

EDIT: updated percentage
Yup, closed my short for a very small loss. BFX not reacting to GDAX panic selling should've ringed a bell, oh well.
W is for wombo 
It is a bullish formation breaking to the upside
> so we've retraced the entire dump.

Can I please have some of what you are smoking?
Personally I’d be looking at 9150 from a few hours ago. If we push beyond that, then it would signify continued uptrend. If not, and we turn back downwards, then we could very well be up shit strasse.
Bitcoin is bearish but can it really tank on its own while the rest of the crypto market is showing impressive strength? It has, even reluctantly, to keep up I suppose. Alts don't care that much and are not waiting anyway so it's either lose #1 spot or do something eventually.
But what happens when the buyers cool down? 
I personally don't see it that way, I think this sub is a tad over-reactionary.

We are at 8900 after having blown through 9100. 9800 was rejected pretty harshly and I think many folks had bought that local top thinking 10k was a certainty (hence a lot of stops hit on the way down).

I personally opened a sub 9k long because the fact remains that the short term sentiment is bullish without any major public pressure (and I am bias to longing anyways). 

FOMO just got a little too intense these past two days so we are blowing off steam. Nothing goes up in a straight line.

My 2c I personally think being at 8900 still implies more folks are buying than selling in these climates. The buying just got a little ahead of itself.



Longs are notoriously hard to squeeze, but ya, price moving contrary to the margin positions going up seems to be a reversal signal lately 
[deleted]
more 16 y/o's burning their trust funds on bitmex? Awesome!
Coinye is going to make a comeback. 
I'd really wait for $10k before blowing your load. 

Personally, I don't think a hesitant creep upwards after a huge dump is indicative of an explosive bull run. 

An explosion upwards would be much more bullish, this slow climb stuff is generally bad news. 

At the very least wait for $9.3 to break, this is pretty normal after a dump regardless of which way it goes. 
I don't see it.  This is mid march all over again.
Looks to me like a bear flag that could have us pushing down again before daily close
''today 130m tether got moved from the treasury into cirulation'' so expect Bitfinex will prop up the price for a while.

Yeah wtf is going on!

Guess we know where to get cheap bitcorns
I am watching this spread right now. good indicator of things to come.

sweet arb for someone who has funds and coins at both places.
you are on kraken right? I don't know if it's the shitty engine or me but I always end up opening position I didn't want.

For example if you are on trade.kraken, and you select a current position and click "close", I've noticed that sometimes the amount for the close is not the same amount as the position opened. I had a 1 btc long position, clicked close and I saw that the amount for the close was 1.5. No idea what's going on, It's better since they changed the engine but there is still a lot of room for improvement.

/u/kraken-jpj 
might be a decent play actually lol
So you're looking to take profits at 8900? You can just use a sell limit order.

If you're trying to do the opposite, eg a stop lower than your entry, you'd use a stop limit order, which lets you specify a price which will trigger the limit order.

You should also read the docs: https://support.bitfinex.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003451049-Bitfinex-Order-Types
Use a limit sell order to close your long position. Stops are mostly for when the price is going the other way against your position. There is a very helpful support center you can use too, and look they even have a section on this very subject. https://support.bitfinex.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003451049-Bitfinex-Order-Types

It scares me how many people I see asking this question on order types actively trading. I can only assume and hope they are using pennys to test the waters with before they go with any large sums of money not even understanding the ordering system. 
If it's like any other exchange you're looking for a stop limit order. 


I know everyone's skittish now and I'm certainly not interested in even losing another penny at this point but I think you've got to give it a little more room to breathe. But better safe than sorry I suppose.
[deleted]
Leverage determines liquidation point, not contract/position size. 

You opened a position of a bit less than 1 BTC worth. For every $1 BTC went up, you earned ~$1 (the ratio would be 8500/8967) 

The ROE would be 6.5% on the amount you put at stake, which would be 8500/25 = $340.. 6.5% of $340 is $22.1.

The price moved only 0.25% and taker fees + settlement are 0.125%. 

that'd be $10.6 so you should have made a bit less than $12 after fees (0.00127 btc at $8990)

Are your entry and exit numbers exact? Because you may have incurred slippage. 
>I am confused about a trade I just made

.... facepalm. Just a hilarious statement.

Perhaps fees are what is making the difference.
I dont know Bitmex but it could be the fee? 8967 to 8990 is like 0.25% increase and it certainly not enough to covers the involved fees. 
Market buy and sells to enter and exit a trade (fees) I would guess
I'm not sure how you're getting that many decimal places to even show on Mex?
The funding for longs was quite high today so that's probably why. 

(so the amount of interest you had to pay on the XBT you borrowed to go long) - ...fees man :/
Fomo losing to round number fallacy.

I remember 1k, it felt like forever to earn that digit 
I used to look at gdax order book and thought the buy/sell action was suspect. You want to look at Bitfinex since they are the price leader and highest btc volume exchange. All the other exchanges tend to follow. There was lots of action on BFX side.
You can just long futures on there if you want to do that 
nah and they never will cuz some many people have gotten liquidated lately where a bunch of "profits" from these fake out liquidations ended up in the fund.
If this dropped from here at least we'd get the "maximum pain" narrative over with. All the fresh longs that opened between 8.7-9 would take a beating, that's for sure.
There's a lot of noobs on the short/long game now. A hangover from the bear market where people wanted to find a way to milk bitcoin on the way down.
How do you see Bitfinex Longs/Shorts?
Just as people didn't see the reversal at 6.5 and kept shorting, people don't see the reversal and think the bull will resume anytime soon.

Meanwhile retail is in full panic dumping on gdax, at 50$ (edit : now 90$) discount vs bfx. More pain to come for sure.
[deleted]
Wait & see imo, enough gains made these last days to take a day off and watch where it goes
Sentiment talk, no TA:

environment still 'feels' so bullish to me, there is relentless buying pressure, this thing just doesn't want to dip hard in my opinion

Maybe, just maybe we should consider last nights drop as a real pullback, but it just got absorbed by the bulls. 

I'm quite sure we'll get a real pullback, but in my opinion it will be after a FOMO-fed run. (thinking around 11-12K)

I'm not trading this, but I'm 1x long since 6500.
No. Not a dead cat bounce. 
Let's see first 10K and then we see.

Yeah, I do not think that the pullback is over. Perhaps we will go down to 9100, maybe we go lower to 8700. We have a lot of potential areas of support I think.


I am also waiting to see if we can bounce strongly off of support. if we can then I will be one step closer to saying that this bear market might be over. However I am not prepared to say that yet, because it is still possible that the entire rally from 6900 to now has just been a May 2014-esque dead cat bounce.
Your are very brave my friend, trading against a strong trend.
I think it will.

If only because of the sheer buying power from the last few days. I don't think it has just vanished but instead, waiting to go in again. Looking at the chart we had a decent dip, dcb then a less sharp drop. At the time of typing we bounced twice from 9000 and are heading up to 9200.

If you were waking up in the East coast in an hour or so and saw that, what would you do, sell? or buy the dip?
chewie's action says yes
I think the 'Kraken whale' that bought up 2000 coins at 6.5k will be unloading them here (and will probably be opening a similar sized short).  So will a lot of other big players.

EDIT: At this price Kraken Whale is up $6mm

That's how the game is played.  Smart money sells into retail, they're always one step ahead.  Can the price go up from here? Absolutely, we could go up to 10k.  But any buying pressure now will just be filling the big boys shorts.
The support is slowly melting and the bounce looks more like a bear flag. Let's wait and see.
edit: sub 9k is likely.
[removed]
Pretty sure you just made up a bunch of words.
I see a blow-off top, but I'd like to see what you've got.


Wouldn't 8200 bring us below the previous ATH downtrend line? That would be bearish I think.
[deleted]
I *think* a flag is the validated when it travels to the bottom of the pole or very close to the bottom. I think I read that it gets progressively weaker as a signal after about a 50% retrace. I would welcome any confirmation from more experienced traders.
Way too steep and high volume for a bullflag. We also broke the 4H higher low pattern so no it's really not a bullflag.

Want to see a possibly epic longterm bullflag? Look at the monthly BTC chart on logscale.
idk man.  Its a 100$ red candle into a 300$ red candle drop.  It doesn't just bounce back from that.  Its likely a signal that its time for the real correction.
Is there an indication or strategy that makes you think 8.8k is a good place to long?
Let's wait to see if 8500 holds well enough
Wouldn't say defenseless. They have thousands of coins they bought up that brought us here.
[deleted]
[deleted]
i think somebody posted a chart the other day showing the entire pump from 6.8K going parabolic over 9K
Who knows if it will hold but tbh I'm amazed it seems to be finding some kind of a footing here.
Just like this news in January...

http://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-price-explosion-wall-street-spends-bonuses-2018-1
>Interesting that a lot of shorts closed during this dip and aren't reopening. And who can blame the shorters?

Nice indicator of the general sentiment. While I think it's somewhat positive, if the mood turns sour there's a lot of rope to hang from.
nice

I hope it doesn't - I prefer the continuous growth any day.
Guilty. Though, failure to break the price down below 9k is on bear apathy. Bears should be able to break this down easily.
[deleted]
Could see them getting squeezed soon.
Yes
I honestly miss sideways Barting. I was trading it gloriously. The run up the past few days actually lost me a minor amount of coins. Paper gains up, but still annoying.
Yeah I noticed that too. part of that is order book is worth 40% more than it was a month ago, but I have a feeling it's partially cause people genuinely are unsure of where this is going. $9k is right smack dab in the middle of the $6k-12k range we've been in for a while now so my guess is people are simply unsure and don't want to provide liquidity for huge pumps/dumps. But I don't know. Maybe a few market makers are taking a vacation 
noone wants to get scalped on expiry

right now 9300 is getting tested
shorter time frame needs a cooldown 
Wouldn't shock me....people get locked into the narrative of the past several days and get overconfident that a reversal is temporary. Not saying it's a given to keep dropping but psychologically setting up similarly
Easy target due to head and shoulders

TV shows 29k longs, it has been between 28-40k for a few months.. so it seems relatively low/normal. Is TV lagging behind or am I a missing something?
well, you can close it now, it's again at 9160$.
Yep...it is "funny" when you are Trading... 

Maybe you should take a longer time frame then 16 hour?!!

Yeah probably, look at the nasty bearish engulfing on the daily. 
oh jesus...

EDIT: exited my long from 8700 with negligible gain. May try to short from 9100-9200 on the usual support-turned-resistance check from the rising wedge
[deleted]
3.5 degrees
The nth degree.
Don't forget MSM attention
damn Bogs reking everyone
[deleted]
I've been fighting the same issues recently. But I've made myself a little checklist that is stuck to my screen. I'm being really strict with myself to go through the checklist every time before I enter (or exit a trade).

Everyone's checklist will be different. But my personal checklist reads something like this:

1. Don't enter or exit between support zones, or in "no trade" zones
2. Wait for confirmation of support or formation to happen
3. Are there good re-entry positions if I exit here?
Trade smaller. It's the only way. 
Quit the margin. Or write down why you entered on a piece of paper first, identify a good stop, then get busy with something. I find the less i look at the charts the better i trade
[deleted]
I’m the same way. I find I’m much more emotional actively watching charts vs checking in occasionally and assessing the situation with a clear head. Being too involved gets me every time I do it. I did the exact same thing yesterday. I got out of my long at 9600, and opened a short at 9650 and added to it down to 9550, once it started going back up I panicked because I was watching it so close. Had I just left it I would have had a handsome profit this morning instead of eating 30% of yesterday’s gains. 

Edit: clarity
Why does something being obvious make it invalid? This is classic resistance turned support. Also looks like alts are pumping again . Take that as your indicator. 
idk the sellers seem exhausted. shorters are nonexistent. alts pumping again. personally waiting to see what happens at 9.1-9.2k.
I covered my short and went long at 8800, and looking for a bounce to at least 9200.
grats, nice trade.
[deleted]
You make this sub completely intolerable.
How can anybody seriously consider this as the premier currency of the future when the price fluctuates so much? Sure it's great to trade when you know what you're doing but I'm becoming less and less of a maximalist seeing this volatility and uncertainty. Sooner rather than later, even the lemmings will be smart enough to not FOMO in to this.
lol people yesterday were already starting the "we won't see it below 9k again" nonsense and getting tons of upvotes.  The way people try to justify their FOMO is hilarious.
Don’t completely understand the implications of this, but doesn’t this just mean that a bunch of sellers cashed out to tether during this drop and they needed to print more because of increase demand? 
Could have been created to create FUD. Why do you think you know the answer.
them were created on 20th march (300 mil in total).
https://omniexplorer.info/address/3MbYQMMmSkC3AgWkj9FMo5LsPTW1zBTwXL

sent to tether treasury wallet that is sending to bitfinex when thy need them.

i don't trust bitfinex yet, but hey, i don't care. these are game rules, let's play with them. i guess we are here to increase our btc/$ stack, not (only) for ethics.

i write (only) because blockchain projects are amazing and that magic number close to "btc" in our wallets is not 100%.
What is interesting to me is that they printed 50 million. Then, they were like, oops, we need 80 million more a few hours later. This kind of destroys the narrative that they print in "batches". I mean, wire transfers take time. On the wire form you input how much you will be wiring. There is no way there was an 80 million difference that needed to be filled immediately within a few hours after printing.
stop loss 8800 should be fine. If 8800 doesn't hold, I expect all hell to break loose
I'd suggest going down to 2x leverage in general.
Set a S/L? 
Was in the same position you were but luckily pulled my buy orders before they hit and went short instead.

If your not too much in the red maybe cut your losses and go from there. I'm not sure we'll hit your liquidation price but it might be close and theres opportunities to make money on the descent imo.
Did you panic sell?  9k holding so far.
Just curious because I am not an expert on Elliot theory: Do you have to use the tops and bottoms of the wicks, or could you just ignore those and use candle close?
[deleted]
> bears seem to have become more timid

Almost too timid....
Why would the price go down if longs are increasing and short are decreasing?
> weekly hammer formed now...

Week is only half over and there's no hammer in sight.
Create the illusion of support, pull the wall and dump on everyone?
[deleted]
For now it should stay above 9200ish unless the wedge is broken, but i'm not seeing it happening today. 
I’d love to be as lucky as you.....
You were close, it bounced from about 9.150. 
That's normal, it's just a market making bot (a *true* market making bot providing liquidity to both sides of the book, as opposed to those jittery opportunist "market making" bots that stack one side of the book based on momentum).
Always use random end digits
Set bids above round numbers and asks below. Round number support/resistance is real.
Had a long order at 9230 at bitmex. Usually bitmex overshoots but this time it only got to 9240, damn.
I'm riding this down to the bottom. 
Interesting possibility but doesn't look like a true shoulder on the left to me though
death cross didn't do shit, why would a golden cross do anything.

if anything death cross meant +43%. So golden cross? bearish lul
Is that a lagging indicator though?
> we conclude that a central bank will not issue cryptocurrencies in the sense of a truly decentralized and permissionless asset

Ya don't say. 
I've lost a lot trying to be greedy. If you are confident bitcoin will go up in the near future, take the extra btc now and wait. 

No one really knows the direction it's going to go, we're all grasping at straws. I personally bought back in at $9k. Made an extra .2 bitcoin and I'm happy with that.
Transfer your funds to GDAX, which is Coinbase's exchange. You can make free trades using Limit buys/sells. Check youtube for how to do this and also look into how to set Stop Loss orders. 

You sold at a good time. We are likely to stay in the 8800-9400 range after the recent run up. If 8800 doesn't hold, we can expect to retest 8000. 
If it's your first trade, I suggest taking profit sooner than later and then observing what would have happened if you held it, over multiple time frames.
always take profits while u can so if ur goal is to accumulate more btc, maybe buy back in now with x&#37; and wait what happens with the rest
very probable, for me it's actually a given that we will revisit the low 8k before breaking through 11.7. I think for playing this game the biggest quality is patience really. 

Also, use gdax! You can make a gdax account with your coinbase account. You'll pay less fees.
IMO you will lose a little in the short term, just due to inexperience.  But if you persist you will gain a skill: Trading.  And in the long term you will be able to use that to make more.  Best to start small and think of it as building a skill not a stack.
I dont trust bear / bull flags right now. 

Volume is too strong, FOMO is too high, too much bullish news in last 24 hours and our recent Bart’s/marges From 6400-8500 have proved they are pretty much invalid 
8600 anomaly isn't worth considering.  Look at bitfinex chart for decisions.


More than likely it breaks down.
When we break 11.7
if we breakthrough 10k?
Does Peter see the current charts?
a few weeks ago he said falling wedges tend not to be long term reversal patterns as well. 

Just remember he says a lot of cryptic (heh) stuff and a lot of it is "up for interpretation" basically. Markets change and he changes his mind, but from that tweet I'm reading that he's just saying it's better to be long right now, not that we're back in the game
How does he infer that it's "going up on bids" from these rectangles?
Screw him
don't catch falling knives in unsure moments like this. I would recommend waiting for this to settle down and then reassessing the state of the market.
I think if we dip hard into the 8s..then yes. 
I don't think it is, just a much needed cooling down.

This is not financial advice.
below 9
This belongs in the alt thread.
Why would the bitcoin market care about an ETH bug?

If anything I'd expect an issue with ETH to fuel interest in BTC.
Hey, can you move this to the alt thread?
You mean the hard fork?
Nah this is going to take several days. The market had a good cycle. The moonbois, rate my portfolio posts and FOMO returned. It's time to crush some illusions. The market is definitely recovering, the price action yesterday was something I didn't see in months. But we aren't just going to blast through every resistance as if nothing happened. 8200-8500 is where i'm looking for. 
Pretty good support at 8.9-9.2 and nice looking cloud support, I see it drop back slightly to those levels and start chugging up slowly. 
% is way off from back then. 
"very bullish" is usually a long wick and a strong bounce, I'm very cautiously optimistic here but far from certain tbh.
You would think so, but look at how fast that latest $100 down is gubbled up to unchanged.
Careful: https://www.tradingview.com/x/7bey25Ok/

edit to add: I'm not in a margin position currently
15m - 6hr says we've found the bottom for now. People are going to keep wanting to accumulate BCH before the fork on the 15th, I'd imagine it goes up to 2k, and BTC touches 12-13k in the week leading up to that before a big sell off brings us back down to current levels. 
My guess, considering the action so far, is that we are not going to be stopped by the ascending trendline through 6k (currently ˜8.65), but rather will at least retest the previous log-downtrend line (currently at 8.3).

Btw, note, as someone else mentioned, with the sharp drop-off from yesterdays peak we have defined a newer, less steeply descending log-downtrend line from 20k, under which we now are (while still above the old log-downtrend).

Short-term from now on, I assume we'll paint a bear flag here for the next day(s) – 1h and 4h are oversold. Then, further down.
If we go to 8000 we’re probably going lower. But I don’t think we will hit 8000.
RSI is useless during strong trends
Do you guys remember that alt season where things were green for a week and then collapsed after a single red daily candle?

Yeah, me neither. 
Do you guys remember that alt season that lasted less than a week?

Yeah, me neither.
It it too much trouble to look at the charts?
Yeah, it could be a bear flag forming on 1H chart.

currently touching its support

edit: now breaking down?
Lots of weak hands who recently FOMOed.  Just wait till it stops, you'll see the rocket pack engage when they want to get back in.
Maybe open half of your long there and hold the other half with tight stops at 8.3? I too think 8.6 will be a key number long term. I'm long from 6.6 I don't trade often. I had planned on closing at 11.5 and sit in the sidelines once we broke log line resistance. However, if we didn't turn support then I'll close my long at 8.3 and open a short. 
Got crazy lucky there, bought at 8790
This is an arbitrage heaven and I don't think my fiat will arrive in GDAX in time to play but i sent some this morning.

Indubitably. 
Market isn't moving much, everybody who had something to say about current state of affairs has, so there's not much to do but wait and see.
fees
Either funding fees or taker fees. 
Funding
theres a funding cost every 8 hours or you opened your position with a market order instead of a limit
we're fighting the bear flag : https://www.tradingview.com/x/TWtEplhY/

Impossible , Bitcoin markets are not manipulated.
Sorry noob here. Can someone ELI5 how does printing tether helps bitcoin?
Hahahahahahaha!  The market is so rigged and I love it.  It will be a fun day when the crypto world get's black friday'ed like the online poker world did.

This was the most obvious call in the world. I think not one of the old timers in here expected this to be the real deal for now
I don't see any reason for why we should go that low, especially within just 12 hours.
Sounds about right..
SELL SELL SELL. Am I doing it right?

Most bitcoin are bought on exchanges, which does not require using the blockchain to transact. Stuck transactions doesn't directly impact the price, but can be something people keep in mind when valuing the coin.
Lightning
Just for fun, I played the opposite side. 1x longed 8925 at 2min til, closed 8990. That was actually pretty funny. Obviously I closed too early, but still. I'm good on tuna subs for like 2 weeks. 
don't see one, can you draw?
It's a lagging indicator. Or do you see a predictive value in it?
sorry, indicator for what? 
More like people just have no idea what's going to happen.
Isnt the fight always on, technically?
mex is still over index right now
I do see shorts are closing quickly. Is that why?
USD getting more expensive too - I've still got 10 days of 0.009, so hopefully it doesn't blow out a lot more than it is now
yes, you basicly barrow btc from the exchange and you sell at x price. then when it drops you rebuy the btc and give it back, (= closing your short) but you keep the profits (you made more money when you sold the barrowed btc before giving it back)
Picture? Link? At least give a timeframe?
Why do we have to bounce?  Why not consolidate, maybe even for days.
Not at all. The market has done what it has done many times before and was fairly easy to predict.  
like the BGD a couple of weeks ago, one buy order ate everything between 6.8k an 7.8k

dont think it cannot be like this, everything can play out. it would be a black swan of them, but Bitcoin just is a black swan... ;\)

I don't think you have to do anything special. Any XBT (bitcoin), ETH (ether), EUR, USD, CAD or JPY are automatically counted as collateral. You can also pick your preferred currency for fees (you can chose XBT).
well converting BTC to another coin is also a taxable event so....
You can't use bitmex?
$4000 in less than a week, seems legit
Looks like it. It also looks like the $8700 resistance is at play, maybe turning to support. Hard to tell what's going to happen next. Be careful. Personally, I think it's more likely that we test the low $8000s than going above $9000 once again. I'm thinking we test $8200 soon.
Large bear flag on the 1H.
That's Huobi's cold wallet. Nothing special.
This wallet started accumulating in January... reaching 100k bitcoin in just a few months. Interesting..

https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html
That's one of the next possibilities in line.  But it hasn't behaved at all as support yet, we went right through it.
9k is horizontal/local descending channel/psychological resistance.

Much above that and you'd probably want to hold that long till it balanced out. The smart thing would be exiting around 9k but if you're sat on other unleveraged longs... Well. 

Strong FOMO on that long last night I guess? ;\)
hope for a big dead cat bounce right here and close out at the top  anywhere in the 9.1-9.3k range
hope that we are here

Sell into [any] strength (in this case, a bounce).

You're gonna eat a bag of dicks on your position, but capital preservation should take priority.
Ouch. You didn’t have stops in place? 


What if I told you it never left

serious answer: I'm inclined to think this last week was a big DCB but I have been having a bit of a permabear bias that made me mistrade most of the last run.
Why are you getting downvoted? We are most likely still in a downtrend a la 2014
We were never out of the bear market 
yes
Yup. Absolutely 0 support from 9k to 7.8k.

Nothing but thin air.....? 
why so low? there is the previous log support at 8700 before that, and the previous long term resistance at 8200 that should act as support
The Dump was getting ridiculous anyways.
i take it you're talking € price here?
[removed]
Wrong discussion thread.
That makes absolutely no sense.
So a crash to say 5K would be super bullish ? right...
Not quite the same, but I had a long entry at 8840 which I promptly bailed on at break even. I got spooked when GDAX was running $200 below the other exchange, so it was more of a self-inflicted stop based on the same metric that stopped you out.

I wish I would have stuck that out, but I had just closed a good short and wasn’t ready to risk the profits with GDAX potentially dragging us off the cliff. 
Same cat or different one?
Noob question but what is a DCB

Edit: thank you kind sirs
A cat has 9 lives, so yes 
> Can you get a DCB after a DCB?

It never goes straight up, it never goes straight down.
No. If we recover to 9250, the falling wedge broke up.
Yes. Im guessing this will bearflag so if it does id try to get out top of the range. That means youll have to take a loss.
I would say no, strong support at 8800, falling wedge can break up, maybe we are in this [channel](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ldrkSnbh/), maybe we're mimicking the run up [from 6k to 11.7k](https://www.tradingview.com/x/YXX7IGJm/).

But idk, maybe this is going down to 7.8
Not at all. We'd have to essentially make a lower low for a "rejection" but it's not really a rejection because the pattern hasn't formed yet.
No. Wait for confirmation. That's the point of the A&E in this position. We are in a deeply uncertain position. 60% will break down.
I’m not either of them but I think no, not yet.

Oh come on... I know if people cant explain why a market moves this way or another or it moves in a direction they didnt anticipate they are looking for reasons and make up "whales" and "them" but seriously... Point 1 of your 12. point agenda is already just a guess. People dumped at 20k and people buy again at 6-9k because thats what people do when they think they are getting a bargain, they fucking buy it, no matter if they need it or not, they just buy it. How is that so fucking hard to understand? 
One way we know for SHO your prophesy won't play out is that "baby Jesus" is no longer a baby. He died at age 33 (historians agree), rose from the dead (Christians agree), and uh yeah, is no longer a baby...

ridiculous as always
Consolidation.
My alt indicator is that eth had no real hessitation about going back below its ATH resistance a few hours ago.  As that does not bode well for the fomo energy, and BTC has been following ETH moves, it makes me think that BTC will fall through a few levels of the weaker support and bounce back up later than sooner.
stop shilling shitcoins noone cares about your chinese knockoff coins only reason they have volume is because corrupt officials use em to get $$ out of china.

Altcoin Daily. Neo is literally a nothing burger shitcoin with barely 250M in 24 hours volume.
Nope, looks like we standing on the cliff side peering over the ledge
Not at all. Accumulation was $6.5-7k. This is just profit taking and dumping 
It does. Just like the past month felt like accumulation at 6-7k. I feel like the support will be so strong at this level.
Strange line to quote from that book... The next few paragraphs immediately after this go on to provide ample evidence as to why this hypothesis is false.

CME is in 2 days: http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/us-index/bitcoin_product_calendar_futures.html

CBOE was last week: http://www.cboe.com/framed/pdfframed?content=/aboutcboe/xcal2018.pdf&section=SEC_RESOURCES&title=2018+Cboe+Expiration+Calendar

Neither seem to have any effect on the market.
on the 27th you have to rollover your contracts.. i use the futures market on CME to buy bitcoin.  I'm lazy and liquidity dries up as you approach expiration making it a pain to close your position.  So I don't wanna buy, etc.  You get scalped a little everytime you roll over.  I think we might go down until expiration.


Starting to wonder if it's a shake-off or if we're just breaking down here

Edit: Might open a short if we fall below 8950 again

You have to give the bears credit for 12% gains in 12 hrs.
If someone doesn't know that crypto is volatile by now, they won't ever.
The 5% drop after a 50% gain ?
Hell no. So long as it's confined to 'just a dip' rather than a retrace to 7k.
I have consulted the Satoshi, the Blockchain and the Holy Whitepaper, and they tell me that there's strong support above $7600. Very strong support. And that we might test $8000... but that we're going to set steady footing above $9000, soon-ish.

We never even retested 9200 on this little dip.
We may (likely) revisit the line at $8300 in the coming week... but nothing moves in a straight line.  Short term I think we're going to see a reversal here.  8 red hourly candles in a row followed by a large capitulation candle putting 1 hr RSI into the gutter.  Generally this is the formula that precedes a short term reversal.
Am trading Mex which only went to $8715 briefly
you can buy now at 8611
Another trader I use to follow once told me "When it comes to bets, I don't like to be in the minority".  That phrase has always stuck with me.

ELIm anidiot?
Lent bitcoin goes toward shorting bitcoin (not necessarily longing usd).  Lent usd goes toward longing crypto (not necessarily btc).  That's just how it works.  

I am staring to track lending order book depth.  It seems odd that 3000 btc of low offered rates would suddenly just disappear off the books when occams razor would suggest someone has borrowed that bitcoin.  That seems more believable than hundreds of people simultaneously removing their offers.
[deleted]
Most definitely.  Looking at the charts, it's pretty clear that the pump from $6600 to the low $8,000s was a short squeeze.  Then the public say $1,000 gains in a day and took it up to $9,700.  When that happens it's really easy to turn limit sells into stop sells.  I fully expect the price to cascade down to $8000-$8500.

Just stupid of me to think we would reach 9.7k again after a double top. 

But, it’s bitcoin so you never know 
My target was 9k.. ya live ya learn
Likely will, already almost oversold rsi on 1hr so downside is likely very limited
Those are swaps, not futures. Bitmex's futures were 200M in the past 24 hours. In the past week they were somewhere around 70M.

Swaps and futures have a bit of an important difference because of how they're treated for taxes.

Yup, I agree. I just decided to take some profits at this time. No trader ever got poor doing that ;)
Definitely possible. This is why I'm not in a trade atm and am waiting for clarity as to when wave 2 finishes (or has indeed begun). Once I'm confident, I'm going to go very big leverage long.

Currently just patiently waiting for true market sentiment to reveal itself.
Totally agree. It made it even more funny because there were tons of genuine “right all along” posts streaming in at the same time.

 I also lol every time at whoever it was who used to post “this doesn’t look good for bulls/bears!”
Yeah it'll be somewhat accurate, it depends on the action of the last few minutes how many new shorts get opened and how many longs decide to close and not pay the fee
It updates over the period, but is never far off.
I don't have a bearish case in this instance and the reason is because these posts are short to ultra-short term forecasting. I fully believe we could dip back into a bear market in May, but I think our likelihood of doing so in the next 7-10 days is slim. In my prior three forecasts, I hedged and included bear cases. They turned out to be unnecessary. One of the comments I've received and seen similar posts receive is: "This isn't super useful, you're giving me a shotgun scatter assessment of 90% where the market could plausibly go." I wanted to be a little more precise about exactly what I'm thinking.

Could we go into a bear market? Of course. Could we go into a short-term bearish trajectory? Of course. That is always a possibility, especially with something as volatile as Bitcoin. But, I'm following what the charts are showing me along with my own trading instincts. As a refresher, I spent several years working at a global macro hedge fund and in alternative asset management at a major U.S. bank (if you want specifics I used to price, trade and hedge fixed income, forex, commodities, derivatives and interest rates).

We had a meteoric rise the past several weeks, this past week in particular. While I think some of that is a natural result of having decisively broken through the ATH log downward channel that we've been trapped in for 3+ months, I also think it shows buyer strength. In an ideal world, we'd see the purchasing strength being spread out among the exchanges a little more, but I believe the market appetite is there at this level.
It's a great channel!

I'll repost this under /u/haserfaul's comment as well:

Ha, fair enough. I think in the short to ultra-short term (which I consider 7-10 days), on average, Bitcoin will move up. In my last three predictions, I included bearish forecasts which I didn't think were truly necessary, but I hedged and included them anyway. I'm not forecasting anything north of $10,850. No new ATH's, no absurd Q4 2018 forecast. This is just where I see the market over the next week.

On a side note, I think you are subliminally shilling XLM via that chart.
Yes, that being said, I'm at the office so I will circle back late tonight or first thing tomorrow to discuss exact reasoning. I will make sure to tag you in the post as well. Please see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8eqr52/daily_discussion_wednesday_april_25_2018/dxyqxu3/) as my reasoning for why I didn't include a bearish case in the main post.
BTC can only go up or sideways apparently
LMAO aw fuck wait where'd you buy :(

I remember you saying you fomod in at like $9600 :(
I had the same long earlier today. The great buys lower down only got a final ca of 9k.  Closed it near BE. 
Hence me using myself as a PSA.
Not enough tethers.
yeah I should have put a stop way sooner when it was around 9700. I guess that is what i meant. 
I also almost pulled the trigger at 9700, so that is also what I meant. I don't think I had a good trading plan in this trade
I guess he went long at 9150, watched the price rise and rise yesterday all the way to 9700, then set a stop loss at 9250 and went to sleep. At least i can imagine myself in this scenario. Maybe a trailing stop loss would have been good.
Oh I see. Basically my plan was to let the break out run and see what would happen.. I put a stop at 9250 so I could have more breathing room and see if BTC would breakout past 10k. Idk if that makes sense.. still pretty new at this
He put in the stop loss at 9250 after the price rose to 9700.  Then when the price fell to 9250, his stop loss triggered and closed out his position for a small profit.  

He’s just saying he wishes he sold at 9700.  Hindsight is 20/20
This is probably a bad call, and the opposite of what I was planning to do this morning, but I haven't seen panic selling at this level in a while. It might reverse on me, but I'll take the hit if so. Edited original post for more clarity.
Bitfinex also has one of the most experienced players participating in that exchange: Bitfinex.
Gotcha.  I have my long term holding stack that I don't intend on touching, but I get your point.  Figure out if I'm wasting my time or not.
All three points are very important advice.
Trying to understand but part of it lost me slightly.

Being so new I feel like I should at least have a stop loss set in case my market barometer is completely off.  Are you saying maybe don't set a profit target, instead reassess the market and figure out when to take the profit as I go?
Considered it, though I thought I might not be able to realistically hold myself accountable to making "real" trades on the test net.  As in, I might open positions on the test net that I wouldn't do in real life, thus I wouldn't learn a lesson.  Does that make sense?  
Gotcha.  So basically, keep some kind of stop loss incase I've incorrectly assessed the market, but as far as profits go I should be learning to assess when to take profits and when to let it ride.  Sometimes I should realize that my $1 profit is all i'm likely to get, whereas sometime I should be reassessing that my risk/reward looks good to target higher profits.

Is that an accurate rewording of your comment?
Bitmex limit orders pay you
Sorry can you expand on what you mean by red/green.  I assume you're in a way saying, buy low sell high.  Meaning buy more aggressive when the market has gone down/red.  Although I'll assume you also mean to do so with caution and don't try to catch a falling knife.  Am I understanding correctly?
Ya, obviously noone would do this when they are trying to make money, but I figured I need to test my internal compass against the market.  That's why i mentioned I might be more aggressive on my targets.  Should I also reduce my stop loss?  
I see.  So if I'm only targeting a $2 profit, my stop loss needs to be much less, like $.50 for example.   If I am targeting a larger profit, then move my stop loss out slightly to account for fluxuation?  
What is your strategy involving the cloud and heiken-ashi, if you don't mind sharing? 

I haven't been trading much lately, but I have been fooling around with the cloud with doubled settings: 20, 60, 120, 30 i believe. Thanks.
Would you post a chart? 
No I went long at $8800 when the last 1hr red candle sunk RSI into the gutter.  This break is a small confirmation of a local reversal
Yeah probably. There's some more stuff in there relating to btc a bit though. 

It's turning slowly into a weekly...
digitimes report says a 40% drop in shipments. There's no confirmation of price dropping but what effect do you expect that will have? 
I disagree, I made a 9.6 call 4 days ago and made a very nice return based off some very speculative lines on charts.
I do the same. Technically it is shorting cause you're shorting futures and/or swaps to hedge the value of your coins.
Yes that is what I do.
I shorted from $9,650, closed at $9,080.

Then I longed at $9,073 and closed at $8,760. 

So I turned approximately $570 per btc in profits into approximately $250 per btc in profits. C'est la vie.

Still profited decently from the movement.

And again, with the utmost respect, go fuck yourself.
I had a plan and I stuck with it. My line in the sand was $8,800 on bitstamp, and the market pushed through. 
Oversold for one day after being overbought for two weeks..
I did essentially the same as him. Market is moving too weird right now for me to be comfortable in a trade.

[deleted]
he will NOT miss out.. he will NOT miss out.

haven't seen that in a while, it's usually stuck to bfx
Yeah it was just for a while. 
noobmex :(
So better to set a stop limit higher, and just in case there's panic selling, i'll set a stop market that's a point lower than the stop limit, am i getting it right?
Yeah this is the strategy I use. If you're gonna be setting a stop limit its very likely it won't get hit when there's a huge price movement, especially if it's a tight stop to the current price. It's always a good idea to have a fail-safe stop market some way away from your stop limit to protect yourself, but even then you could take a big hit depending on the size of the dildo. 

Another option is to use a trailing stop, but these take a bit more work/patience to set in the first place. 
yeah, that could be what has happened. there were no buyers and my order was skipped completely? i didn't know that's possible. 

so traders be careful out there. one wrong trade and you could get rekt. 
no i didn't tick post only :(
good. BCH too
nice analogy. I noticed because I opened a small and short lived long on the ETHBTC ratio. RIP
Here you go (rough round the edges but you get the idea): https://imgur.com/a/U1PLpBW
In traditional markets I would agree.  But in BTC (with its 24 hour cycle) these have usually been quite bullish -- it is FOMO momentum visually represented within a single candle.
> We bounced off rising support, so that’s a pretty good sign.

Was lucky enough to catch it after closing my previous long. Moreover, it really felt at the moment that it might not go any lower and that it may be a good entry. 

> It was a little more than 10% actually. I’m glad we got this pullback though, that growth was unsustainable I think.

So am I with this pullback even though it made no sense to me until recently lol. I hope we can move forward in a much more sustainable way.

> In my opinion we might retest that rising support one more time

Looks like a very potentially scenario.
The ranges are good but I am afraid with the current movement, we will have to be sticked to our screens to find out whats the right entry to short/long which will only come with time. 

It may go deeper than $8,750 or may even overshoot $9,300, who knows.
Feel ya, me too about closing with this new hindsight.
Sounds good. Made 5x thanks to that.

I'll quote him 'with all do respect...'
Hahaha he was finally wrong in his last long call. Not bad though, probably hit on  12 outta his last 13 
Tempting to open a short here just don't know if it's worth it
Yes thanks.
I mean in the time you wrote that clearly it didn't happen. The 2 in that chart was not a price target only a structure.

There could be a slight retrace upwards but it depends if that was the end of subwave 1 or if its still to come. There is no way to know. 

The bearish momentum is clearly picking up speed, so it might blast through where hardly any retrace putting in a deeper 1 and then we see a larger bounce.

Christ that dip was only $100 dollers off my first buy order on xbtm18.

Edit: Ie that jump could be the retrace, was the first one to hit at least a 0.382 but W2 is often at least 0.5 could be the start of a tiny ABC or that could be it before further down. https://www.tradingview.com/x/m29SYXyC/ charting on this low a timeframe is very tricky.
[deleted]
Edited, I’m not sure why I do that so much. Guess my tides have shifted from bear to bull. Catch y’all in the AM
When sanity returns to exchanges (price parity, really) -- the remaining opened longs should be an amalgamation of traders who are deep in profit who have exited above 9k to open lower (before the $100+ price difference in the exchanges occurred) and recent bulls who longed late and bailed fast to buy in lower.  Ultimately this will provide a basing/price consolidation at levels that had been devoid of serious tests.  The fact that so many more longs opened at these lower price levels means the price floor has been 'raised' so we SHOULD experience less volatility when sanity returns.  We are still above the key resistance level of 8.5k -- if BTC tanks below that on volume, then it's time to be concerned as a bull.
traders are buying the dip real strong. Just hold and don't panic.
I love the choice of Dildo colours.
Agreed, bears trying to push through it here.

Snapping the line exactly to the bottom of the Sept and 6k crash on the daily puts it practically right at 8.8k right now.

Not that it really matters - it's a band not a line so yours is probably equally valid as well.
I chuckled
I thought divergences were leading indicators, not lagging. 
Cool man, here you go:

r/iamsosmart
Don’t you put that voodoo on me 
Nice call my man, how’d you pick out 8700?
Yes
Speaking for myself holding a 5x underwater short from 8100, it was because i didnt want to lose 2%. After going under i had no plan, was always "lets see what happens @8xxx" and boom, BGD. Not closing now, this has to retrace! 8800, 9200, 9500... Ok, now i'm in to deep, its make or brake and be liquidated...
Always have a stop plan and stick to it, even if it flips and goes your way after. 
I'm already forced to go OTC, with fees and the shitty spot price I'm effectively paying an approx 10% premium. It looks like they are having difficulty finding a bank who will do business with them, deposits and withdrawals have been suspended for a couple of months.





Thanks.  It seems so obvious when you put it like that!
Remember, someone has to sell at that price for the price to be that low. It's not always stupid, and it's not something to make fun of. In hindsight, everything looks clear.

There are valid reasons to sell and not sell at those prices depending on the strategies the trader follows and what they think the market will likely do next.
Absolutely nothing like that.
Hmm, I never thought of it this way. This is very interesting, thank you.
is that based on 1 bitcoin with 3-5x leverage?
Good idea. I follow the same strategy whenever it is applicable.
This strategy works in a choppy or bull market, but will bankrupt you in a long bear market!
It's never a single loss, it's multiple bad trades in a quick order.
I flipped my position multiple times in profit. Sometimes it's good to enter, but you need to count r/r. If you enter bad trade just because you can afford to lose then it doesn't matter if you go with it today or 3 days after. You still can afford to lose.
My commitment varies between 0.5x and 4x leverage on the whole stack. But there is definitely some overleverage going on "the day after".

He never left, he's been posting this hold time. Doesn't mean he's trading. 
Good point
We go down there and it'll be a deviation from the solid bull flags we've been witnessing. If we go that low I'd bet we're going lower. Probably test 10k first.
Yup..swing low bottom is around 7.8... also where the .618 fib retracement region. It also is an area of high price action. If we don’t bounce of the higher swing low positions or trend lines, 7.8 range is the next stop before a 10k break. 

Still a healthy correction for this amount of movement in a short amount of time
I thought we were more confident now than ever.
yes on small time frames but i would like a confirmation on the 4h before making any decisions, but if doesn't hold next stop would be previous log support (turned resistance for a bit) at 8730.  You have that price target as well?
yeah that's what I'm thinking as well. I would need someone more experienced with fib to confirm my chart though.
gdax touched 8800, damn

I live in North America. We aren't asleep yet. We've probably been the ones selling actually lol
Are you short again?
Longs still increasing rapidly while shorts decrease. This makes no sense.
Never understood this argument. Couldn’t that just mean that people deposited 130m recently to BTFD? 
Tether was needed because of the lack of liquidity on binance (https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8eqr52/daily_discussion_wednesday_april_25_2018/dxxf0xx/). It's not a fiat onramp. Stay away from idiots who don't understand why there is demand for tether.
An eternity in crypto 
As in yesterday? I remember it being around 25k
I can’t imagine what would happen if Nasdaq starting offering Bitcoin or other cryptos. I’d guess a ton of new money would enter the system, no?
It's nothing more than an expression of being amenable to the idea of being an exchange some day if crypto sorts its shit out. Plenty of wiggle room there. 
Once more regulations get passed, it seems like it’s going to happen. Who knows how long that could take. I can’t imagine it would take longer than a few years though. 
Gemini sent out an email.

You sound mad homie, don’t be bitter 
Man I'm not even going to try and pretend that I have a technical reason.  The reason I chose to get in today has more to do with me reading sentiment here and the market over the last few weeks.  I've tried to make my market feelings known to my gf outloud over the last couple weeks because I've been trying to convince her to grab a few coins for long term holding.  I told her last week that I had a feeling the market was going to do well.  I told her  I expected a slight drop over the weekend and if the weekend held up well I expected a good upward spike.  I finally convinced her yesterday to set up her accounts to transfer money in and get ready to enter the market because I expected a slight rebound after the sharp spike this week.  After we had the drop this morning it gave me a little confidence that I'm on somewhat of the same wavelength of the market right now.

So, there is my reason.  Nothing technical.  I'm going over some technical courses and such trying to learn some TA, but its not in my arsenal at the moment.
I got caught in a wick at 8966ish. This taught me what wicks are. I had no idea. 
Lol.  Eh, its all an experiment right now.
Well at least you're friendly, right?

Dude I might be wrong, and I expect to be wrong.  We'll see.  We've blown through resistance all week before this blow off.  I'm not too worried about resistance right now, maybe I'm wrong.
That's like just your opinion man
be nice, don't scare the poor kid. Well, idk, maybe it'll be good for him. 
From the time weve spent getting here and the past bear market
And every single one is underwater and hodling cus this is going straight to 10k amirite?? Fuck i just wanna 50x short so bad its almost sexual ughhh
How do shorts close by selling more?

The buy wall may have been shorts closing.
yeah, it's widening.  weird to see the biggest fiat exchanges with such huge spreads.
I'm guessing the arb bots must have run out of fiat/btc, allowing the price to deviate that much.
we are currently out of the channel correct?
It's likely that individuals are rushing their coins onto exchanges enmass.
I wanna hodl at all costs :D
my trading stack is always just 1 btc using 5x. it's not really the end of the world if i lose it all but still would hurt emotionally since it has never happened to me before. My take is similar to yours. I think the overall trend is up and would be shocked to see it going below 8000. 
I realize it's just a typo, but boy would I ever love to test $96k soon. :)
$96k! Wahoo!!!!! I know what you mean, though. :)
It was your post and chart I cought a bit below.  Many Thanks.
his buy targets maybe
In general my color scheme is: purp=volume profile node, gray=weekly level, yellow=dynamic level, blue=significant fib level (usually 62% fib), orange=break out confirmation downward, teal=break out confirmation upward.  For lines blue=weekly, green=daily, purple=short term or untested, black=parabolic with at least 5 touchdowns.
Yo you still didn't answer my question from yesterday.
I have to take a break. Lost the whole stack. 
A thousand times this. Every time I've lost money I've found the best thing is just to take a week or so away from Bitcoin. 

It's hard, I admit, when you're seeing all of these amazing opportunities to short / long and make money, but often the best strategy is not to play. 
My take on it is that it doesn't matter how the price gets that high. I mean really, it's just a result of poor liquidity. 

The main thing to take away is that the sellers are real, doesn't matter if the buyers weren't all legit. 

If willybot tanked the price and real buyers showed up to buy it up, would you consider it a fake bull market? 

It doesn't matter *how* the asset became overvalued, it just matters that it is. 
[deleted]
I also caught quite a few small longs from 9200 to 9050 :) let's hope this [channel](https://www.tradingview.com/x/XyrmhvjF/) holds, I don't really trust the wedge 
[removed]
Why should it? It's not confirmation of anything. Just an air of legitimacy to the market. No one is immediately going to change their mind and buy based on this.
Good news doesn't do anything in a bear market.
Most of them don't follow this sub. They follow CNBC or permabulls on twitter, not chewy or sloppy so they never get the bearish view. It's all moon talk. Even this sub was euphoric last night. 
That would be fine as long as we don't break 8800 and flush to lower lows. Set stops and react accordingly.
I seem to be sitting right next to you. Or maybe behind? In front? Deff close by
Yes, agreed there. We *almost* got one with the more defined local low at 7.9k, but not quite. Mostly just noting that drop definitely cooled off those mid term RSIs.
I was talking shorter term reversal signal such as a pin bar of known support area. The break of the log resistance certainly was significant and the push through the line showed that and great but that was back at 8.6k. I want to see it confirmed as support before we are off to the races.
A lot of the bears have the same mentality the bulls did on that slow bleed down from 20k-6k. People ignore all the signs and find one TA that supports their bias. 
Hey, I'm totally fine with that. I would prefer not to have a bearish reversal. If this doesn't play out, then awesome, but I thought I'd point it out.
There's no leverage on GDAX, for now.
Yeah this discount should have been devoured long ago.
if btc went under 9k i think i'd cream my pants from my 9.7k short

but yeah, agree that this probably isn't the end of upward movement
It looks like we made a lower high again on the 1H.
not inciting any dip buying yet but it got my short stopped out for sure. sitting out until at least 9k to reenter
light blue line that we broke through on the way down to 6.5

https://www.tradingview.com/x/pUhqSevG/
Lol, good point.
The alts have had a good couple weeks after literally getting the everlasting piss beat out of them for 2 months straight (80-90% drops almost across the entire board). They were bound to get a bounce everntually, not a big deal and not that bullish imo.
Haven't seen them cooling down in the past two weeks from $6,800. 
It's just worrisome because it looks like a blow off top now. not just a pullback. We'll have to keep evaluating 
> I think many folks had bought that local top thinking 10k was a certainty

Who the hell thought that? I'm a hard bull and I thought sitting in 9k was expected 
Tradingview, compare BTCUSDLONGS and BTCUSDSHORTS from bitfinex.
lol there are people asking him to mention bitcoin so it'll pump 
Only in bitcoin terms can a 400 dollar retrace in 6 hours be considered hesitant. You've got to love this market! 
the bounce after that dump was decent though, don't you think?
I disagree. Confidence takes time to build, and bull markets usually don't start off crazy explosively (past the initial recovery phase). At the end of 2016 (Aug -> Nov) it took 3 months to rise 20%. Even corrections usually have a period of slower growth that accelerates later. I'd personally love to hang around in the 9Ks for awhile and get some sustainable growth going. And if you just look at this as a large correction in an ongoing bull trend (debatable) it's about 3x as long time wise so could see a longer period of consolidation before growing.

I mean I'm not saying this *is* a bull run, just saying that slower growth is somewhat appealing imo.
You sense a trap?
tether boys are out today in full force. 
Yep seems like a solid place to take profits, up 50% on price and God knows how much on margin. 
Whatever dude. Unless you believe this is the last time BTC will surpass 8800, it's a whale sized panic market sell that moved the market. 

Your answer also has nothing to do with my question. Main curiosity is the premium/discount. Which is now back. GDAX is full of noobs.
It literally sucks. The closing / stop loss / limit and everything always winds up fucking you. 

I’ve always been having issues with opening positions at per day .5 BTC, and it coming up as .1 BTC and I think i put a .1 amount in there. Then it will say I only have likr -$20 underwater but when I close, I actually closed for a -100$ underwater loss becasue it was actually .5 BTC not .1

Stop-Limit order just doubles my already 3x leveraged value when I click sell maximum as said below.

EDIT: I think I figured out that I do not need to be distracted with collateral/double amount. I placed a Stop-Limit and it looks exactly what I needed. Cheers!

I will read the link, not that too helpful other than explaining the order types. 

You shouldn't be scared for others and making assumptions without information are wrong. I have already made a lot of pennys without the knowledge of different order types. 

Anyway, appreciate your feedback. I still haven't found my answer though.
I see Limit, Market, Stop. Stop-Limit, Trailing Stop, Fill or Kill, Scaled Order and Token Manager. 

Hardly know how these works except for Market. 
nope
I'm just being an idiot scalping small trades out of boredom. my stops are basically my entry. just picked up another entry at 9002.

edit: for anyone wondering, i closed in about the same profit as the last trade before we fell down.
Ah ok, thanks!
He also may have held through the funding hour, based on those numbers.
You actually did the math...

Man, get a life.

I did my own math, I believe bitmex rounds.

I closed out my long from 7988 this morning, and now I'm wavering about opening a short. The movement over the past two and a half hours has the appearance to me of unmanipulated, honest-to-goodness selling. It just looks weak. 
https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSDLONGS/

https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSDSHORTS/
I'm pretty sure the 'retail' investors who aren't holding for eternity would have sold on our visit to 6500.
Brave? Not really. I just started shorting on the signs of the trend imploding / reversal. I've scaled out to a larger position size now.
One could argue that we are still in the general bearish trend.
Just woke up to this and that is the exact question I asked myself. I will be looking for one more retest of 9k before being confident in going long
I'm actually not hugely confident in $9,000 holding indefinitely. 

My long position is mostly a "this should bounce a bit here, and could bounce a lot here, potentially."
"There is 0 chance"

How to sound like an idiot
Can you stop trolling on every post you make? that's not useful content at all
Lol
Posted it 
Thanks I’m just charting things to see if they are valid 
We will see. I exited any sort of margin but I’m not selling any of my bought coins from before yesterday. 
normally the drops happen in waves of 3 which is what we see here.  Plus the giant volume spike means the sell pressure is getting absorbed.  That doesn't mean we'll stay above 8800 by any means, but its a good spot to expect a short term bounce until the MACD stabilizes.
Not anymore.  Once those are gone, they're done.  A million coins changed hands today.  This was the biggest dump we've seen, and it barely budged the needle.  Bullish AF.
If it's a rising wedge, do you think that a reasonable target could be $7600? You seem to know more than I.
Exactly. When we broke *upwards* from that steep ascending wedge, I thought this is going to end badly (of course I immediately regretted having sold between 9.3 and 9.4, but now I am ok with that).
[deleted]
and after the chinese new year
Well, in that case it was an expectation, the money to enter was much smaller than the money interested in exiting (buyer exhaustion, typical of bubbles), and the simple fact that the new wasn't received with a pump is a very bearish sign. 
[deleted]
something to keep an eye on for sure if you're short, but almost no shorts added so even if it spiked up theres nothing to squeeze and its likely going to be a tough fight from added resistance of closing longs and bears opening shorts betting on a double top
>I honestly miss sideways Barting.

I personally would not go *that* far lol. I stopped trading during the barting.
[deleted]
I bought that dip this morning, now three hours later I get to see it again!
So, previous resistance is now support?  That would seem very bullish if we hold.
> people get locked into the narrative of the past several days and get overconfident that a reversal is temporary

You'd be forgiven for thinking we'd had a 2 month+ bull run, not a 6 day parabolic pump...
Good advice but arrived too late.
^ this
lol what a comment. think he made a writing mistake. 
I’m thinking exact same thing 
That was far from a 'phoenix rising form the ashes' context.
Sorry i dont follow, can you express that in radians?
I actually opened a short because of the bear flag / you’re continuous talk of this not recovering and crashing for a new bottom.

You were right from the beginning and so was sloppy. 
Wrote them down and taped to desk. Thanks 
Looking at charts and order books too much hurts more than it helps 
Even when you put your stops on a short above a resistance line, for some reason i find myself closing them before we even hit it. 
Yup. If i would have went to bed I would have made nearly $1200, instead stayed up till 2am watching charts and panic closed my shorts from 9.5k+
Wouldn't call alts pumping just yet, they are recovering with BTC, and that will always happen.
[deleted]
I had resistance at 9.7k - check my post history
[deleted]
The maximalists response is usually that volatility will decrrease over time with higher liquidity and more market participants.

Personally i don't really buy it since btc is volatile as ever and bigger than ever. 

But gypsytoy usually has a good argument for this. 
I was heavily downvoted for pointing out the rally (or rather, lackthere of) above $9000 was suspicious. Yeah, there was one last push to $9800, but the drop under $9000 was somewhat evident, I think. I was close to shifting buy orders upwards, but decided against it. It's a good thing I decided to set them a little lower than I usually would because of my suspicions. 
Yes. I don't get why this is so hard to understand. They destroy tethers as well...
I know that every time tether has been created, btc prices experienced a pump.  
[deleted]
I sold a very small portion just to be safe - I'm surprised it hasn't  revisited 9000-9100 but if it doesn't that's fine with me. 
Elliot waves describe market psychology and trends. Wicks matter. That's why breaking down below the first wave is substantial. I should rethink the way I'm drawing all of this, probably.
Here's another interpretation I made after my last comment to you:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/x3kt0jOb/

This seems more correct. Notice the fourth wave extending almost all the way down to the first wave. Also notice that I drew a cup & handle as the extension for the fifth wave. It's a combination of the best and worst case while sitting within the theory.
I went back to the drawing board.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/x3kt0jOb/

That seems more correct but less focused. The projection is as wide as I could reasonably make it. The forth wave makes the fifth wave too large... but I expect market action will establish a more practical range when a bottom is confirmed.
Because both longs and shorts are margin positions.  The price is currently going down.  The market that operates on margin is betting that market will go up so the bulls are supporting the theory market will recover, so they can borrow money and buy btc then sell it when the market gets higher.

Meanwhile, the people who shorted thinks it's an opportunity to NOT add to their short position, instead they are covering their short, meaning there won't be a short squeeze when the price does go up. So in this case, the margin longs will eventually need to cover (ie by selling btc) and the shorts that covered might short more when it becomes more attractive.  This might turn into the opposite of a short queeze, which is a long squeeze.  As you can see the market was heading downwards while this happening meaning it's mostly the margins playing these positions, not people actually organically buying using their own money for cold storage.  That's how i see it anyways.
so you reall think we go in the mid 9s here? that would be the only possibility to not have a weekly hammer. we just made a V top here, we climbed and dropped from 9k to 9.7k in 2 days.
[deleted]
Don't be a numpty, man

Do you think that was THE bounce?
Thanks for explaining that!
Lesson learnt

9250*

I know this as I missed it by 7 USD. 
Death and Golden crosses are only working when price are close to it atm it happens.
It is, but if it is to happen next week, it's relevant now.
read the entire paper...they are making a case for a central bank cryptocurrency...not necessarily that there can't be others that are decentralized in the private sector.
And then it drops $100 right as I post that :p
Yea took the advice I gained a little over 4% so I’m happy with that
Yea my real goal is to accumulate more not really concerned about the profits since I kind of got it all for free trading in game currency in like 2012 haha
Thanks I’ll be looking in to that later!
Look again. Volume invalidates the "bart/marge" meme. That doesn't work when volume and liquidity are high like they are now.

3 weeks of weird movement do not invalidate established patterns.
That’s fair. 
I was wondering this myself. I think it has something to do with the wicks? 

When the wicks coincide with the direction, you want to jump on the trend, I guess? Dunno 
No idea actually 
Or just scalp these swings, as long as the exchange is functioning.
I thought I was in the alt thread when I read this. Yes, 100% the wrong place.
Not sure what the psychology is of the average crypto 'investor'; could go both ways.
You can't necessarily say it was caused by it but BTC's reversal was preceded by alts and their BTC ratio halting and reversing as people sold into BTC. With MyEtherWallet having issues yesterday and now this, a significant hit to ETH can lower confidence in the whole space. 
No, there is a bug that supposedly allows essentially unlimited new ERC-20 token generation. Okex has disabled all deposits due to it.
[deleted]
So many people waking up to the importance of immutability.
Bring it on I say! I have mentally prepared myself for a dip, I've been doing so for over a week. I am *READY*!
First 10K and then we see.

This is the reality of things right now. Everyone got too uppity the past few days with the large pump. Time to the moon kids back to reality.
I mean, long term. The longer we stay here, the stronger 9k will hold. 

Unlike V bottoms that can pump very hard to then go down again, like with 6k.
A B and C waves in there, too.

I took out a long here because of this
Daily RSI called this top actually, but RSI can reset with sideways actions so I wouldn't project a bottom price point based on the RSI
Well, every end has a beginning.
precisely 
It's certainly lasted more than a week. For example ADA bottomed more than a month ago.
longs are up almost 3000 btc in the past 4 hours and price is barely moving. funding is also kinda expensive.   
tells me bulls are way overconfident and are likely being trapped by the whales. no spot buying and lots of margin buying is very bearish.
Such a deep and smart analysis of the ongoing situation; "Longs are going retard again."
Much thanks!

I’d be careful— you didn’t hear it from me but there’s a big mayo shortage coming down the pike 
Someone posted one down below. It’s the most god awful head and shoulders I’ve ever seen. I dont think it’s valid 
Its usually skewed one way. Right now its deadlocked 50/50 imo. 
Ok that makes sense. I'm also very confused with the writing. There is USD/CHF for example. Is there also CHF/USD? Does it matter?

When I go long on USD/CHF does that mean that I BUY CHF? Do I buy anything? Do I buy USD/CHF?
[deleted]
Fair point.

For one, i'm thinking about the kind of buyers that pushed this fomo run up yesterday. My assumption is that most of them were looking for quick gains with unreasonable expectations. Not exactly strong hands, most of which are now underwater and will probably be spooked by a lack of continued run up.  

And also I'm still under the assumption of this being a DCB until proven otherwise, so for me consolidation here below support would be a bearish signal.
Seriously if you read the daily, most people who know what they're talking about said this would happen. It was only a matter of choosing when to exit (close your long or sell).

Ofc it's really hard to exit if it looks like the climb is unstoppable. 
Ugh, fixed. I think I have a rare case of number dyslexia. This isn't the first time I've put in the wrong price on a post. 
I'm new, but this is my understanding as well.  It uses all of those as collateral and you choose which currency the fees are taken.
This is the correct answer. Any BTC you have in your account can be used as collateral for margin trading.
Ok I'll try this. Thanks!
Another dumb question. Can I use this BTC as collateral to margin long BTC. Like for example using 1BTC to go 5x long on BTC?
Depends who you ask ;)
No one can use bitmex when there is price action going on.
Rather not use a VPN, but they are an option.
Don't think they'd want to sell yet then lol
I think it is the most likely of the possibilities.  I think the chances that we have broken the down trend are good, and I also think that a test of that line as support needs to come before any major rise.
>Strong FOMO on that long last night I guess? ;)

Yeah, also I had been successfully taking profit and re-entering on dips.  My leveraged trading stack is a smaller portion of my overall.
To be honest I've had a bad time with stops.  i.e. I set them, go to sleep, and a huge candle wicked it then the market went the way I wanted.  So, of course, when I don't set it you see what happens...

How do you handle this?


lol @ the downvotes
There are the fib retracement levels but we haven't tested them yet. The pump this last few weeks blasted through without truly testing support.
I don't trust diagonal support lines which have been broken in the past.
No, USD.
It makes some sense.  If we suddenly saw 200M in volume daily for the next few days due to the volatility, that makes for a very bullish case.
yea it’s not the end of the world, i only lost my profits from last nights short
Different cat.
The most misused term in crypto. There are no dead cat bounces in this market. 
http://lmgtfy.com/?q=dead+cat+bounce
dead cat bounce
[Dead Cat Bounce](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deadcatbounce.asp)
Dead cat bounce.  It's what a rally is referred to once it has failed.  Bull traps are the selling climax of a DCB before price goes back to test/break support.

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deadcatbounce.asp
This cannot be overstated.
So break under 6k or break under 6.6k?
Seems pretty significant in terms of market risk and fundamentals.  If it was about any other exchange besides Bitfinex, I have a feeling it would not have been censored.  Anyway I see he crossposted it on r/buttcoin.
Sure is, I read this a few days ago. Nothing is going to happen with Bitfinex or Tether, they can continue to pump it if they want and I will continue to make money moves to profit accordingly.

What? By no means has the EMH been "proven" wrong. 

It's an economic theory, so like all the others it's fuzzy as hell and there are times where it seems to hold truer than others, and it's constantly being attacked and criticised.

But "proven" wrong or abandoned? Not yet. 
next time I post in alt thread. but it is a general comment about crypto and not about THAT altcoin. just weired how such drops can happen. 
Last time it went $100 up in seconds
Can someone plz explain how the delta between futures price and spot price is calculated? Doesn't the futures price pretty much match the current spot price? Or is the futures price set at a certain time, acting as a magnet to spot price as expiration nears? Never understood why the magnet effect, can someone plz explain?
Thanks you for the reply. Much appreciated. I remember reading it but it slipped off my mind what it was exactly. Bears chasing their losses with the downvotes. Lol
theres a bear flag. close to breaking down
Huge volume, high tx counts, low search interest/conservative trading on $10k media frenzi doorstep makes for a very interesting trading context.

I'm doing swing short trades, but I do not want to miss the >9700 run & will long it heavy.
Time is ready.
i was ready to all-in thank god i had a wire that needed clearing.. as i watched i thought this is just too much FOMO so I'm holding off.  Bitcoin isnt just going to come roaring back because apr 15 is past.  A lot of money that left the market will never come back period.  Mania is like love it hits hardest the first time.   Sorry the days of 100,000 new users on coinbase every day are gone forever.



Absolutely.  Kudos to anyone who went short last night.  It took balls to do that.
i exited my pants and shorted my shorts (for the summer)

oy, haha, be careful. although I totally feel that 😂
And it starts with your mentality ->> out the door!
I didn't really make my point clear. I wasn't really saying this is unhealthy even, I still think this is the better case for bulls. it sets up a potential very strong  bounce from low $8s or high $7s. If we strong bounced from there I'd be quite comfortable longing. 

I just mean that after a 43% rise, the pullback will generally be violent and seem/feel unhealthy until it isn't. 
Well wasn't your plan to ride it to liquidation? 

If you close it here will you reopen lower? 

I can't give you advice because I'm not you. I personally would've closed it after $9150 got rejected. You're kind of in a weird position now because $8500 to here is where it might turn around. But...ya know, it also couldn't. 

If you don't know what to do, I'd start scaling out 

You need to make a plan and stick to it. Could you stomach missing out on being able to close higher?

What's more important to you? Not losing more money? Or not missing out on the chance to make more money or at least close higher? 
I would think at some point it's going to surpass 10k - not sure when but I would hold on to it if you can afford to. 
Very good. Learning never ends and try to learn as much as you can. Will be looking forward to your charts as I don't know how to create one, perhaps they might help me in learning the same as I expect them to be beginner charts! :)
Well apparently Bitmex hit 8930 earlier so I was already stopped out without knowing it lol
congrats on the last few weeks of trading - been on top form. And of course thanks for sharing with us as honestly and meticulously as you do.

A small request if I may. I've managed to set up alerts when you comment - I imagine I'm not the only one - would you mind replying to your comment as a comment when you do an important edit, like above? As it is impossible to set up an alert for a comment edit.

no worries if you don't want to, but would appreciate it hugely!
Are you looking at any particular entry points right now Chew?
Why regrettably? I know it bounced but it's getting hard time keeping above 9k.
Thx.  Yeah after I posed the question I realized the answer was a bit obvious, SL on an 0.5% price movement wouldn't be great.
We need low 8ks. I hope we will get it. 


Fixed for you. 
I hope you're right, but I think we're about to kiss four-figured Bitcoin goodbye forever.  That dump today was the biggest one yet, and it was absorbed very well.  If you can't tank the market on a day when over a million coins changed hands, you can't tank it.
At best i see them incorperate btc into micro transaction for their games. 

More adoption, always a good thing
Google may start google coin
Hah indeed
Which averages are you using?
Did you redraw lines to fit your narrative after the price went up? Just ensuring it’s legit. 
lol everyone over trades when they start. Smaller positions (unless all your signals have been hit and you're confident in your ability to manage your emotions) and longer trades will be more profitable in the end
The best bet is trying to find confluence. i.e. a mix of different TA approaches that come to a similar conclusion (e.g. fib levels and EW wave counts mixed with SMA/EMA lines; volume charts; trend lines and order blocks). Plus a few indicators to give you a feel for market velocity (e.g. RSI, stoch RSI, level 2 order book).

Ultimately, experience is what counts I think. TA is an art not a science.
Holding/forgetting is the worst possible strategy in the cryptocurrency markets, and most others as well.  Lack of diversification isn't really as much of an issue here.
> Not true in general otherwise IRAs, 401Ks would be completely and utterly meaningless.

That's great but he is talking about putting all his funds in one altcoin not S&P 500 Index fund.
Not saying it will drop, just mentioning some levels that might influence sentiment change / agravation.
Still think the wedge will play out until 9800 (maybe a bit less since the rejection yesterday might cause profit taking and shorts opening) 
8 minutes after you posted that its 8800 on gdax now
Did you not see the 15k short squeeze from $6800? That advice would have gotten you completely shrekt.

also, majority sentiment is a tricky thing. It's extremely right until it's not, and then it's suddenly extremely wrong (but no one knows it yet because a reversal seems innocuous at first) and then it slowly goes from being extremely wrong to extremely right again. Then it goes back...in a big cycle. 

Like all the permabulls from $7k to $19k were very, very right. and then at $19.7k they had no idea how incredibly wrong they were about to be. 

Same with bears from $12k to $6k
I'm not sure that statement holds in recent times though. Whenever we've seen a significant increase in longs or shorts, the price moves in whatever direction would liquidate the most orders. Not saying it will happen again but it wouldn't surprise me.
I'd like to be bullish but on bitfinex we're looking at 30k longs to 20k shorts. I certainly hope sentiment prevails but I would not be suprised in the slightest if this gets dragged down into a bigger squeeze on longs before we recover.
i find it hard to reconcile this with the "be fearful/greedy ..." buffet thing...

edit: maybe what matters is the majority of "market makers"
Many indicators suggest a local top where we have just pulled back from. It would be unusual for this type of pullback to last only 1 day, or to not continue down to confirm resistance-turned support at the log-downtrend line, but margin longs have been accumulating as the price drops. This increases the risk of those longs being liquidated, driving the price down further.
Cool, thanks!
Thanks
you gotta admit, the market has been conditioning us to buy the dip this week so you did the right thing closing a short in profit
you consider 36 rsi oversold?
Did not know about this tax difference, can you give me a brief rundown or link?
Nice job. Taking profit is something I need to work on. Greed is like a muscle you can't work out
Cool. Gib me that btc baby! 
Thanks for the excellent response. Makes sense. I appreciate your take.
Got it, thanks for explaining the reasoning behind your scenarios. Looking forward to your next post!
I'm upvoting both of these comments because you are right, there is always a chance of a bear market occurring spontaneously because of a black swan event. Hell, the BGD in early April that lifted us out of this mess was a black swan event. But, in the very immediate term, I think we will see higher levels. What happens after that, I don't know. We very likely could run out of steam and see lower levels again.
9400
I was just laughing at the “fuck it” portion

We’ll do it live. FUCK. We’ll do it live
Pretty much. I know for a fact that my dumb ass trading has lost me thousands of bucks. Some people are better at it than others, granted, so holding isn’t everyone’s best bet. But I find that unless I dedicate almost all my time,I always lose when trying to time the market. 
Setting stops because you could be way off on your analysis is redundant because you're only trading with a small amount for that same reason. You should definitely have a stop loss or alarm set, but base it off of your analysis rather than fear of being wrong. Maybe you will be wrong, but since you're trading with small amounts, it won't hurt.
Yes you always have to have a stop loss or at least a point where you will exit your positions to cut your risk. Look for horizontal support and resistance levels to find your entries and exits. Markets are attracted to these levels. ~9000 and ~9800 were a couple of important levels. It's a good idea to take profit here but don't try to close it all at once in 1 order. Chances are you won't get filled and miss your 'target' or the markets keep running and you lose out and eventually FOMO back in. Stack orders around these levels, keep your position open for a while and let the market take you out. For example if you have an hourly higher low uptrend, place your stop higher after every hourly higher low. Breaking the uptrend is the first sign of consolidation, if you want to be more conservative increase your stops every four hour higher low. 
It does makes, but there's also a practical approach that needs to be automated. If the mechanics aren't there with no pressure, then they're defo gonna lack when adrenalin is pumping.
Pretty much. There is certainly some validity to the "stick to the plan" mantra, but you have to be nimble enough to make adjustments when necessary. Setting pre-determined profit/loss points like you originally suggested is the opposite of being nimble.

Learning how to spot trends, support areas, and resistance areas will allow you to make more informed choices in where to set your entries, targets, and stop losses for a trade. The market's reaction to them will also help you determine if and when you need to consider adjusting the plan.
On TV there's a long/short tool that allows you to adjust your risk levels and it gives you an a ratio. Assume you use 1/20th of your stack on each trade and your correct 50% of the time then you want to look for trade 2.5:1 or 3:1 so that over time your profitable. SL should be just above/below resistance (depending on your position) and your target should be support or resistance or just a little shy to ensure your more likely to get a fill.

Here's an article on it. https://www.tradeciety.com/how-to-use-reward-risk-ratio-guide/
The way he was wording it it sounded like he was gonna trade spot.
Let me get this straight... if the price is $8k and I set 1 BTC to sell for $8,001 and it fills, I make 0.025% instantly? For real? Why doesn't everyone do this lol
Yes it’s all a little ambiguous, but overall the odds of prices going back up are higher when they’ve gone down drastically compared to buying somewhere near the top (lot of green).

It comes back to risk/reward and someone else posted a pretty good description of different R/R ratios and what you should be looking for.
Don't trade based on targets of profit/loss.  It must be based on where you think the market will move or be stopped.  But yeah, you gotta start somewhere to see the causality.  Give it a try like you are where you'll lose minimally by making tiny trades.
Your stop loss should be chosen based on your TA. If you are targeting 2% profit the TA needs to show that you can use a 0.5% (to use your numbers) stop loss. If it doesn't, then you simply don't take the trade. If you are targeting more than 2% profit, then you can afford to take a larger stop loss (but your position size will be smaller if you do).
I use Elliot Waves for forecasting, Ichimoku for basic TA, and Heiken-Ashi for trending. To answer your question though, I don't have Ichimoku strategy, I use Elliot Waves for that.  

The real secret for trading is to learn when to sell. Remember as a professional trader, you are dealing with two emotions - fear and greed.

You've got to overcome fear when you are buying low, and you've got to overcome greed when you are selling high.

Check out this hypnosis thing really helps a lot. 
https://www.hypnosisdownloads.com/personal-finance/trading-psychology

And take away your bullish label, it is going to cloud your thinking when things go down. Trust me. Don't associate your self with a trend, read them, make money from them. Don't create a self-image around them. 

Good luck.

The reason you are a winning trader is because you stick to your plan.  It’s not about making all the right moves.  It’s about maximizing the winning moves and minimizing the losing moves.  You do it as well as anyone, and better than most.  Keep it up.  
You're one of the few very disciplined traders I've seen. 
https://redditenhancementsuite.com/
Well, they used to. https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/22/ethereum-price-crash-10-cents-gdax-exchange-after-multimillion-dollar-trade.html
You have to have a lot of market power to count on the market going down 15-20% if you start selling
Considering we're already down 9%, the cascading would probably start <8500. Certainly could happen. 
I think GDAX actually got really close to pulling this off for the broader market today, even without a margin liquidation cascade. Had the price gotten in the $8,5's I think it would've been significantly more noticeable on other exchanges.

Who knows, maybe this limp consolidation is actually accumulation of shorts by the big guys while retail is still willing to provide the liquidity they need to unwind.
I'm sorry...but what?
Yeah you can do that.  I just use stop market all the time to simplify because of how often the stop limit fails to fill.  The slippage is usually (not always) next to nil.  And if there is significant slippage, then you can bet your ass the stop limit would have failed to execute, so I just keep it simple and use stop market only.  
it was a stop sell? 
Holy crap you're not kidding. ETHBTC down 8% in 24h, BCHBTC down 14%
I'd loved to know what the hell was happening there. It was eerie.
thanks!
Last daily hanging man we had preceded a major sell off, hard to find any more in the past (maybe some that were followed up by inside bars that retraced a good portion of the wick). So I don't think you can say they have usually been bullish.
Based of Jared’s post, it seems likr 8500 May be the target. I’ll evaluate there but I’ll probably wind up opening up a fat long there 
Not wrong, just set stops too tight. His long would be in profit now. 
I got a small short in at 9100 and am layering in adds to it between here and 9.2
I agree that horizontal is superior.
In fact, that line has many more contact points going back to May 2017. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/BlTSVuqA/

But I agree with your point regarding clarity – it is certainly not as strong as the more obvious lines.
Quick chart: https://imgur.com/a/Qm2LhEg

Recently it's been a decent line to watch. It's certainly not insurmountable - we broke down through it (though it needed crazy volume) on our most recent trip down through the 7ks. Just a good place to monitor.

After reclaiming it recently at the same time we broke the ATH log resistance, we've since touched it three times (this being the third).
I see, thanks for clarifying!
The market could dump below the price where the divergence starts and it'd disappear

If we popped back up to $9.2k-9.3k over the next 8-12h then I'd say it's legit 
Hahaha. Funny
Thanks for sharing that. I the takeaway is stops are paramount for every trade. Risk management seems to be key. 
Don’t listen to them. Your strategy works if you’re trying to insure yourself against big moves. 

So we dropped from $9600 to $9k and you started shorting. That’s fine as long as you convert back to a long at $10k and take advantage of the momentum. 

I shorted a bit at 9600 and took profit at 9k and am long atm but that doesn’t mean your trade was bad. Your trade was okay if you were insuring yourself against a big drawdown. 


pshh you sound like you panic sold at $17k. 
Np. General rule of trading is that it's easy to make money - hard to keep it. 

Find your signals and sweet spots for buying and selling. If you don't have your own personal criteria for signals to open and close a position, you shouldn't even be entering a trade. 

Ignore other people's signals. Develop your own and use them. Don't over complicate things, you want to *reduce* the amount of noise you get from multiple signals, not increase it. 

Some people look at WAY too many factors to open a trade and it ends up leaving them confused and frustrated.

Find what works for you and your emotions/risk appetite and then act on it. Refine it over time and like I said, look for the strength of your personal signals while reducing the amount of signals you look at over time.
It doesn't matter, my point is that you can lose more than you win - it's the size of each win and loss that matters
That's the issue. Quicksand. You're trying to recover losses, but the harder you fight the more you lose. Don't rush back into the market. Have a goal and stick with it. If I were you, I would make only 1 trade every 24 hours for a week (note: this of course includes taking profits/losses as necessary, no time frame required for any of that). If you do stick to 1 trade per day, you'll begin to realize that your actions are limited and can't be reversed, therefore you'll (hopefully) be more careful with how you deploy capital. 

Perspective is always good. It never hurts to sit out for a few days,study the market and even simulate when you would purchase something (keep a written journal and keep it honest). Good luck.
> r/r

Is an important aspect. As long as you are in control of it, things should most likely work in your favor. 
.5x is insane for your low end, really there needs to be some days where your confused by what's happening and you have 0 leverage going just to see how it plays out. My best decision of this year was to not trade until the bear market ended.

And if your into that high of risk you could up your 4x, but if you're inexperienced maybe you don't quite understand how quick money can disappear when margining.

“ Dead Cat Bounce?” 

“ Im expecting 9500 to act as resistance. Thinking of shorting, but could be a noob move after we already dipped. Alts have more room to dump imo” 

Quote from him on daily earlier today 

- LI4.. Just messing with you this means no hard feelings lol 
That's because hold time goes 2x as fast as regular time.
I'm not going by that log support line, but rather almost the same approximate line which is drawn with Feb 6th 6k and March 18th 7.2k, which is at 8.65 for me.

Though my next support is 8900, which is a diagonal that supports all the lowest since april 21st.

As I typed this, we went back into your channel.  I might regret panic closing my new long just now.
I noticed you stopped posting those screenshots here (though you still do in /r/cc), so I guess you're acting more like an adult yourself. Good.

Source on the equities thing? As far as I can tell, you're completely wrong. BBands and RSI is used extensively in options trading, for instance. Candle patterns are used across all financial markets.
I am not gypsytoy. I swear I am gypsytoy.
LOL, me too. Volatility like this really interferes with my sleep.   And, I think most of Europe is still sleeping anyways...
I’m short from 9978.. terrible idea? 

Edit: 8978
Yes from ~$9700. err like $9675 but who's counting. 

of course we hit our local low while I slept :) 


Tether should only follow receiving USD to their bank account via their own whitepaper. Binance is not a USD exchange. They have no USD on exchange to trasnfer to tether. So, when did the USD hit the banks of Tether?
No the way down from $11k, Gdax decided to participate in the market again 
I'm not really sure. Could completely obliterate it or send it to the moon. I don't think it would sideways for long.
o yea i agree. regulation, stability a lot of stuff has to happen and they might do it. but it is better than being closed to the idea. 
Thanks for the link!
Thanks for the swift reply!
I'm envious, got my ca down to 9000 with buys in 8800, but I chickened out and closed at break even.
i hadn't either but they started a 2 for 6$ deal near me.. and i can't resist a deal.  Of course my stomach wasn't accustomed to it like in the old days and .. doubling up on them, well..  didn't have a good result later..

you cannot be seirous
i’m not bitter, Im furious. All these morons looking to get rich quick. It will never happen
You really might want to start learning some technicals before you start trying to trade. Trading on sentiment will get you burnt. 
It's ok to try to guess what the market makers and the whales are thinking and why certain trades will make sense for them, and why you believe the market will go up or down at any one point as a result of your analysis of that (especially after looking at certain indicators that can back that up, even if they are basic); that's not necessarily TA but it's still valid reasoning. But be careful about having feelings without any solid reasoning to back it up; mostly because if it turns on you, you won't have any idea what your exit point should be.

A lot of gamblers have gut feelings about the next card or the next pull of the slot machine too.
Your transparency and self-accountability are to be applauded. Not many (myself included) are brave enough to be fully transparent about how we are trading. I will be checking in to read how things develop. Best of luck with your first margin position!
[deleted]
So you think that going below the downtrend line would signal for 6 more months of downside? I just don't see the reasoning there.
> Fuck i just wanna 50x short so bad its almost sexual ughhh

If I may suggest, find a less costly, and –almost– equally satisfying substitute.

In this game here, we need patience and a calm mind (I suck at being patient, but trying to learn).
Yes, ever so slightly. Enough to stop be out of my short though. 
Doesn't seem to be the case based on Coindays Destroyed.

https://fork.lol/blocks/cdd
then why are you asking? Do it :)

I personally say take a tiny bit off the table so you're not liquidated early. The lowest we could go imo without invalidating the reversal so far would be like ~$7750
By entry target did you mean where I would short from? I shorted from 9500+ added a little more higher. Cover some excess short at the dip around 9.3 and readded it when can back down. Blowoffs are hard to target as they are driven by fear, but the outcome is (mostly) always the same. In the end it did reach my charted target I had in my comment.

I actually sent coins to the exchange to increase my liq price which was already at 12k because I didn't want to get caught in some ungodly wicked liquidation in the event it went mega crazy.
Ouch, really sorry to hear that. Better times ahead though.
I'm going to talk from a personal experience here \- so I hope it relates.

I started trading BTC last August. I was a noob, but everything was going great, I was averaging my way up \- first buying at $8k, then $10k, then $16k, as we were getting close to the magic $20k, I was a 100&#37; sure the market will continue to grow, I started taking out loans, borrowed money from family, opened 5 credit cards, to buy some more at $18k. Most importantly, I started to give up on school \(I'm in my mid\-20s\), thinking we are going to be rich in this bitch.

Little did I know.. I was in for a surprise. The price started to go down, *quickly*. I kept holding, thinking it will go back up, but then the reality set in. Combined with the panic and "crushed dreams", I started to trade against alts. That did not go well. The market was bleeding badly.

"What comes next?", you might ask. Next comes leverage trading, my friend. The best and the worst thing ever invented by the nazi scientists \<\- \(don't quote me on that\). Without knowing shit, I started to trade, losing BTC, and putting in more, thinking I can make it work. By the end of January, I lost all my BTC \- all $75,000 of it.

Depression, panic, uneasiness was introduced into my life. I lost all the money, most of which was not even mine. In those quick 9 months, I went through every single stage of grief.  *Denial, anger, bargaining, depression,* and and the end \- *acceptance.*

You have to accept that your actions led to where you are now. It is not going to be an easy ride. Talk to people, explain your situation, listen, but most importantly \- don't hate yourself for that. There are always people that are in worse situation than you. My biggest regret \- fucking up school. I have to go back and retake those classes again, hoping to get better grades.

I took 2 months off from trading \- it looks like a long time, but when you consider the state of your mental health for the rest of your life \- it was helpful. I picked up extra shifts from work, cut down ALL of my unnecessary expenses, started learning about the market, worked on my health and healthy habits. I made sure to save up some cash and ONLY then I went back to trading. I just made back $20k over the past two weeks, but it took a lot of self control, discipline, and internal fear of fucking up again.

The truth is \- unless you experience this yourself, you will never ever listen to what anyone is saying. You could listen to your family, friends, be in private chats, and even this subreddit, and yet \- you will do what you want. The reality, however, is that there is way more to living a happy life than owning BTC. This is my first time venting out, and I apologize for the long comment, but you and me are not alone. It will get better!

TL;DR noob trading BTC \-\> got cocky \-\> lost $75k of \(borrowed\) money \-\> went through hell and learned my lesson by working hard \-\> came back and made $20k back by being smart and patient \-\> stay smart people, it will get better

You exited the long? 
Operation avoid dead cat bounce. 

Last night Li4 called a dead cat bounce from 9110 to 9475 where I opened a short at 9465 but closed because I wanted to sleep. 

How far down are you adding too? I have more guys set in 8.9k range 
Not exaggerated. I'm actually bullish, but if we didn't turn log resistance into support, then we haven't reversed the market to bull and we continue the down trend putting us below 5.8k. 
[deleted]
Haven't closed an hourly below 8900. Support is holding for now.
you had a take profits stop/stop set below break even just in case? you were short from 9.1, no? 
They certainly may not, but are *you* going to buy at $8700? $8500? $8300? $7800? 

We're due for quite a correction, it's very likely you will get the chance to buy at a few of those price points
We sure saw them cooling down from $12,000 to $6,800....
What characteristics give it a blow off top rather than a pull back at this stage? Interested in your perspective.
FOMO man.. 9300-9700 was almost a straight line.

The buyers there thought it, not you but they did hence the price increase.

Also by local top I mean the 9200-9700 range not 9800 the exact top.
What TV does not show is, a significant portion of these shorts are hedged:

So, in reality margin long positions are almost twice the size of (naked) margin shorts. This does not bode well for bullish case atm.
Kinda blows. I sort of resent this era where long/short ratio is the main indicator that matters, even when its making me money.
Wow man, this kind of shit makes me more confident that we are looking at a massive DCB. 
Price or global interest/intrigue?
Haha right? 

I would've been more surprised if we kept going down/hung around sub $9k for a bit.

the market is still way overextended and a slow climb retrace is just setting itself up for a big fat bear div and double top. 

A larger pullback and bounce would be more bullish than a slow climb to $9.7k, imo. But if we get past $9.7k it doesn't matter so much. 

 I'm just saying right now I wouldn't be interested in longing until seeing more. 
its ok but you really want to see > 50% retracement to be confident its not going to keep dropping.  9.3k would be a good sign.
I mean, we kind of agree. I'm talking about on the shorter term. I don't think this is necessarily a reversal of upwards movement just yet, but my personal prediction is that we won't get past $9.3k before retracing more.

A move to low $8s or even high $7s with a very strong bounce would be exceedingly bullish and would "reset" a lot of the euphoria and hysterics here, which is good for sentiment and sustained upwards movement. 

A double top at $9.7k would be more bearish than simply continuing to move down here. 

e: meant high $7s

Krake support here.  We definitely want to hear more about this.  Please escalate a ticket with a description of this issue to us here with a request that our trading and dev teams review it as part of the body of your ticket: https://np.reddit.com/r/KrakenSupport/comments/6n4qfn/new_way_to_escalate_your_kraken_support_ticket/


It does scare me because I don't like to hear of people losing money. 

If you are long from 8817 for example 2 btc, and you wish to close this position once the price increases to 8900. You would put a limit SELL order in for 2 btc at 8900. To completely close you position you need to sell the amount you are long.

If however you want to close the position once the price has gone against you the other way, for example 8700 top stop you from losing more money. This is when you would use a stop SELL order. 
So you want to use stop limit. 

Stop price = The price the order will initiate at. 

Limit price = The same as a regular market order. 

So you want to protect yourself if we push down? Set stop to 8,899. Set limit to 8,850 or so. It should get triggered immediately and sell at like 8,897 or so. But you set it lower incase the market is crashing hard and you want to be certain that you get out. 
You are right, this is exactly what I didnt account for. Thanks!
Math is fun :D
Haha, I normally wouldnt but I'm trying to learn. 
Yeah just whichever direction he thinks it'll go eventually. 
they did and then they bought back higher

> I’m not selling any of my bought coins from before yesterday. 

Me neither.
I just noticed when I read the article again, it seems like the article was written because "The director of the Digital Currency Group (DCG) predicts a bitcoin "buying frenzy" when the bonuses hit."

DCG = Blockstream Investor

Truth
yeah, I don't really know why. it thinned out considerably over the past three days.

It went from 3k bitcoin for 3% in both directions to <1.5k on both directions 

on finex, at least. 
Did I? What I am implying is that 9160 is a rubbish entry.
A multi-week slide from $12k to what is still "the bottom" with a 100% bounce in two weeks? 

Just because it was a fakeout doesn't mean it wasn't about as bullish as it gets, narrative wise.
0.0610865 rad
Even though, yes, this is dropping right now, its also helpful to avoid moon/crash dichotomous thinking. Over-extrapolating like that is the #1 cause of reckless FOMO. You need to realize there will *always* be another profitable entry in the future. Don't worry about missing the big one that always seems to be lurking around the corner.

I am just giving this advice because I have been where you are before and I imagine many people in here have as well.
certainly does. my best trades have actually been while ive been on vacation or busy with work
Except when it didn't and we ended at 6.5 k. 
true that and the 12h-1d doesnt look very tempting
[deleted]
Damn that's a good call actually. Time to sell I guess.
The dildos are getting larger and those hurt since they go in deeper, no matter if they are green or red. I'm just disappointed that what I thought was a technology adoption curve ended up being a classic bubble formation like all the old clueless people around me said it was.
They destroyed tether one time due to media backlash. It was 30 million worth. Shortly thereafter they printed 300 million.
I know that every time you have commented, it's negative towards btc.
What you are saying does not even make sense. Neither Poloniex and Binance accept USD deposits. So, where would they get the money for those orders?
That was a good call.

Personally I had entered a new long at 9.3kish, earlier today, after waking up to having the previous one stop out around the same level.  Then closed it at about 9.1 fearing a dump.  9.0 held so I reopened the same position back at 9.1.  Sheesh.
Are you confusing a *shooting star* with a hammer? Either way, there are still 4 more days until weekly closes. Talk about jumping the gun.
yup, agree with this, this dump is just crazy and there are still people out there screaming buy the fucking dip
Jesus, I'd be pretty spooked out of opening a long if I saw 4000 coins sold lol
Thats like the 5th time I've seen a 9.2 call.... mine was entirely on instinct, what the hell is everyone else basing it off of 
Watching it drop like that makes me want to wait but man feels bad losing 
Nice trade
Overall, no. Bearflags and bullflags can still play out. Can you trust them right now though? I wouldn’t put my money on it. We watched bear flags break up 9/10 times and vise versa with bullflags. 

I’m just pretty much saying as of right now, they aren’t the most reliable indicator to trade off of 
I was thinking it was because the price was moving very quickly upwards with little pullback. I guess that might suggest that bids are struggling to get filled and chasing the price up. Still, Peter isn't that insightful and I don't know why there aren't green boxes around other parts of this chart. 
Oh snap! I remember looking into this earlier in the year. Couldn't crack it.

Holy Moly, Christmas came early gents.

We saw this shit from 11.7K and 17K if I remember correct. Longs increasing price dropping like a rock.
we aim for the best analysis here
[removed]
BD? sorry, don't speak the lingo 
Well, it looks to me like ETH and BTC experienced local bottoms after the pullback/correction/return to the bear market, whatever you want to call it.

I only mention ETH here because it seemed like in this recent run up over the past two weeks ETH was leading and the ETH/BTC ratio has been having its strongest recovery really since the crash first happened back in January. So, it has seemed like a good leading indicator for BTC for some reason, not proclaiming to know why.

Right now it seems to be recovering, possibly into a slow uptrend again. Obviously it's very soon to proclaim that, hence why I'm watching it on the 5m and 15m (under a microscope).

Edit: Also I feel we are still in this short to mid term bull run. Everyone was clamoring for a pullback, but then once the pullback happens everyone shits their pants? This is what we wanted to see for healthy movement people!
That would seem obvious, no?
Sounds like your trading perpetuals on bitmex. Every 8 hours either longs pay shorts or shorts pay longs depending on how much above/below the market price is above/below the index price. So above index(premium) longs pay shorts and vice versa.
thanks for the compliment. It's the light theme on tradingview but I tweaked the background a little bit to have this grey-ish color. For the trend lines I just used the smallest thickness. I'm a bit color blind so I need color that stand out!
When more tether is printed, who owns them? 
Or create fake walls, wash trade, manipulate the market....so a bit more than straight up buy crypto.

Yes you would buy CHF for a particular amount of USD.

Same principle applies as long/short BTC. Going long implies you expect the value to go up, after which you can sell the CHF for more USD.
In simple words, there's only one USD/CHF pair. You can do both things (saying/thinking/predicting USD will go up or CHF will go up) with it.

By going long(buying) on USD/CHF you're saying that price of usd will increase in respect to CHF. By going short on this pair you're saying that the price of USD will decrease in respect to CHF, or in other words the price of CHF will increase with respect to USD.

So you can say both things, i-e price of USD will increase or price of CHF will increase on the same pair. So you don't need another pair such as CHF/USD.

Hope this clarifies something
Ah yes, a profit taking slump does seem probable versus consolidation here.
Yeah indeed, there's a strong argument for not holding here.
Yes of course.  It was classic chart formation and market action.  The fact that it is confusing so many people here shows how many newbs there are who don't have much trading experience and/or have short memories.
Yes, that should be the case, although I use Kraken only periodically so others may be able to confirm this.
yea its the worst. It just wont take your order. Any other issues with it? just started using it. Fees seem reasonable?
Set stops further out, or have them staggered. A very common issue is having very tight stops that doesn't give a position room to breathe.
Guess the green made people delusional  and everyone’s convinced we are in a bull market now? 
Fib support levels are still higher at 8.9...just wouldn't say the next level of support isn't til 7.8
Support-turned-resistance and vice versa are very commonly a thing...
Bull run, yes. But I don't think it would be sustainable. A sustainable bull run requires long term price consolidation prior imo. 
woot
If it gets down to that point there'll be more pressing factors to worry about rather than a pattern that hasn't even formed.

More than you can imagine
You are basing the price of Bitcoin on the price action of Neo. Seems ridiculous
Read about 3com and Palm stock split for example http://jill-carlson.com/how-to-price-hard-forks/

"Intuitively, the following inequality should therefore have been true on the day of the carve out:

Price 3Com > Price Palm x 1.5

This is assuming that there is some fundamental value to 3Com in addition to its stake in Palm. Since equity cannot be priced negatively (and really rarely trades at zero), this is reasonable.

But this is not how it went down.

In the words of Lamont and Thaler:

“The day before the Palm IPO, 3Com closed at $104.13 per share. After the first day of trading, Palm closed at $95.06 a share, implying that the price of 3Com should have jumped to at least $145 (using the precise ratio of 1.525). Instead, 3Com fell to $81.81. The stub value of 3Com (the implied value of 3Com’s non-Palm assets and businesses) was minus $63. In other words, the stock market was saying that the value of 3Com’s non-Palm business was minus 22 billion dollars!”"


And just look at the bond market, one of the ones with most perfect information flow since governments issue them. It's also one of the biggest traded ones. Why would this be needed in a perfect market? ANd what is an effective market anyway?


Crypto belongs in the alt thread.
Oh you meant when funding ends?

I thought u meant we’ll get a pump for funding. my bad
you have it drawn on a chart? what's the bottom?
look out below.   Skittish shorts will mostly miss this down move.

is the volume real though?  Seems like it takes an hour just to actually buy a few bitcoins on GDAX.  The book just evaporates.


Hah, it's funny, a few weeks ago I said falling in love is a bubble. It really is true. You tend to go back over and over and fight and break up again and again until you finally quit. The only way you can "fall in love" again is if you take time away and let things reset, just like the mania/bull run. 


It didn't take balls at all.  Shorting at $9700 was a no brainer.  How much % do you think you can lose if you do that and you set a stop loss or watch the trade?
It's true, I am.
It's not helpful for you to do risk management though.  You can't use the support line to help you choose your exits if you are also thinking that it could go 100 below and jump back in.
Thanks bro, didn't know it was on TV. I never really understood the Delta, the price right now of the futures is 9375 which is just about the price of BTC. Is there usually a lag for futures pricing and we just coincidentally happen to be the same right now? Or is there another Delta?
Just joking because it said “SWIFTRE”

Dude...  Let him be.
I'll reply to your comment here:

"I opened a long at around $9,070 after I closed my short."
how do you set up alert? I need it too
Well, I'd be able to close at breakeven now, instead of an ~3% loss.
maybe. i was more confident when i wrote that, but we'll see. currently looking at the mid-bbands on the 4hr. a break over that should perhaps let us retest the 200MA, but i would be very cautious with any longs right now
Have an S top forming.
I’ve been over trading way too much and panic closing too often . I guess it comes with being a new trader. Staring at charts and order books all day definitely plays a major factor in my decision to open and close positions. I HATE IT. 
This is quoted directly from a Peter Brandt tweet from March 28th, which I found very surprising and interesting .... "For me, over-trading would be entering more than three trades in a week (When I enter more than three trades in a week usually ends badly)"
Agree there's a possibility.
i remember at 15-20k we all worshipped this long term chart which showed a retrace to 12.5k sometime in the future, and all of a sudden going 'wow thats gonna be brutal'.  Literally noone could believe we could go back to 12.5k.   This chart had 2 targets bitcoin 40k and bitcoin 100k.
I remember the sheer terror when it fell to 14k the first time and then later to 10k.  I literally thought it could go to 0.  That was the sign something was wrong.. sudden drops for no reason like that.

fuckharvey was going insane during that bull run.  Every day we worshipped the daily moon math.  It was glorious.



I've seen numerous short squeezes and long squeezes in my years watching the charts.  Going with sentiment isn't a sure deal and hopefully I didn't make it sound like it was.  

Also, 6800 was early to mid April?  Lending rates on Polo for BTC during that time were near .01 (same with Bitfinex), and USD wasn't anything special either (also staying near .01).

I keep charts of lending rates.  I've also recently begun keeping records on lending book depth.  I could provide some limited back testing on lending rates vs. pricing if anyone is interested in a specific range.
Why do longs accumulating as the price drops _increase_ the risk of those longs being liquidated? I thought if you're longing, then you're not liquidating it?
it was 34 and i said almost if u didnt notice
Swaps are treated like all other derivatives and equities. Short term for under one year and long term for over one year.

Futures, because they can't be held for longer than a year (by design), are taxed under the 60/40 rule: 60% long term capital gains + 40% short term capital gains.

This make the top rate be around 28%, which is much better than 39.6%. Since few crypto traders hold positions for more than a few months, at most, futures are better for them than swaps. The only thing swaps provide, which are better, is more liquidity.
that's not bad 
Hahaha basically. Probably salty I closed my 9740 short last night. 
Haha, gotcha.  Well I figure if I make 100 trades over the next month, worst case is I lose $200~.  That should give me sufficient time to figure out if I'm hot garbage at this or not.  Hopefully I'm quick to learn my lesson, or maybe I'll figure out its too much stress, idk.  I figured the only way to find out is to get in.
Makes sense.  Thanks.
I'm sorry, that's kind of confusing to me.  I feel like you're saying use the testnet to get the mechanics down, but you're agreeing that mechanics are pointless if you can't perform under real pressure.  So I think you're agreeing with both of us? Haha.
Thanks!  I'll look over this today.
I don't know the terminology you're using so hard for me to understand.  My plan is to use kraken.  I don't think I can technically trade on bitmex as US person can I?

Kraken seemed like the most legit place for me to do margin down the road when I'm comfortable.  So I figured I should learn on kraken for now so I'm comfortable with the platform.
Because a limit order is suppressing price. In order for this to be worth it you have to guess the market correctly. Or you simply do it both ways and provide liquidity- which is what market makers do. 
there's easier ways to throw away money than that, just give it to me!

jkjk. Although you could technically keep opening and closing positions for the fee rebate, it's a fairly null amount and I don't think anyone could be that consistent/quick. Bots on the other hand I would assume could, but my knowledge on bots is limited. 
Thanks for this amazing detailed response! and as for my flair, I forget i have it most of the time lol

There's a reason toddler bikes have training wheels. 
3800 ETH for 10 cents each. I remember. Pretty incredible. They honoured that trade as well and made good everyone else from their own purse.

Thank you great help. 

Stop market stop market stop market (i just have to type this out so i remember next time)
Stop market stop market stop market
Very good advice.  Stop limits are really risky.

The slippage is worse on low liquid stuff like the futures on mex.

Worst slippage I ever had was 3 or 4 stop markets layered about $30 or $50 away from each other.  A huge market order blew through all of them and all of them executed at the same price almost $100 lower than the lowest one.

I've found a fairly reliable way to close out at a more specific price point is to manually adjust your margin to liquidate there.  But that's tedious, and has a different way of slipping because of the fair price thing.
after i opened my position for a long, i created another order for stoplimit sell
Music to my ears
just think we hit a blow off top of sorts for alts and they sold into BTC. when BTC stagnated, sold into fiat.
Sounding good, will have to monitor closely or stay out of position lol.
Stops were good there, he just didn't count the wick and bounce.

But this could get lower. Sometimes it's better to lose a winning trade than let it go too far underwater.
Ahh gotcha. It would have to dump below $7,900 before its invalidated. 
Another great point. I have to get better at resisting the feeling of missing out just because I'm out of position. Of course I know I shouldn't be in a position if I'm not sure. It's just become the default to be in a position, rather than the opposite. Trying to reinvest the gains, I guess.
Yes, reducing the amount of trades I have made is pretty much what caused me to end up in seriously profitable positions. Good advice, all of it, thank you. 
Oh yeah, I mean I'm not always in position. But when I am. And I only do higher leverage with fairly tight stops.
Yeah whenever I try to take a step back, if I stay attached to the information feed the most I can last is about 4 hours before I take a position, or at least have a plan for the next one.
I think about it all the time, but I have not been trading. Thought about shorting when BCH led the mini dump yesterday, but thought it was imprudent. Went to bed with BTC below 9500.

 Woke up to the dump, otherwise I probably would have shorted above 9500
It's all groovy like a 2 dolla movie
It is now 7am here - so we wake up and see the mess right now. 
Obviously not, just be ready to cut losses no later than 9.5. If your leverage is too high then rip.
Do you mean you have that position open already or you have a limit order set there?

If it's already open I would absolutely keep it open.
You cheeky git.

Well done. Doubt it will stay our local bottom, but I suppose it might. 
Binance itself does not order tether. Market makers do because of the insane arbitrage opportunities.  Learn how tether works and why there is demand for it or you will continue to be hopelessly confused.

Wendy's is a Store of Value (Menu)
Under normal circumstances, I would agree, but the mayonnaise market is just too volatile right now and — I assume it goes without saying — heavily manipulated.
Ok, for the record I’m not one of them I was just jesting with my original comment really.

Also, if it’ll never happen then no need to be furious. Any get rich quick folks will be disappointed so it kind of sorts itself out anyway 
Take a break. 
I appreciate it.  I'm working on it.  I'm really not risking much money.  My stop loss will trigger a $2 loss. Heh.
From what i've learned over the last few months is so many people are looking at the same charts and seeing completely different things.  I'm following a few people and viewing the work their doing and checking my thoughts against theirs.  I'm going to put some work in to learn some chart stuff.
I have no shame in learning.  I asked all kinds of dumbass questions to people much smarter than me in the networking field in order to get where I am today.  The way I see it is the real dummies are the ones that are too proud to ask questions and learn. 

Either way, thank you.  I appreciate the sentiment.
Dude, i'm maybe going to lose $2.  Why are your panties in a bunch?  I've protected myself, I'll have one less snickers this week if so be it.
No a lackluster bounce off it
Definitely man, patience is key. I never do more than 5x nowadays but some days like today its tempting as hell to bet a lot more.
Oh alright. Do you think we'll retest the 8.2k support? (That is where the old log resistance was). Personally I think there is the chance that we have been in a big dead cat bounce (like in May 2014) which sucks because I'd like to break even on my investment already, but oh well, nothing I can do except short it I guess.
I really appreciate the feed back. I should have been more careful. I thought I had a 10k buy on mex but in actuality it was 100k. At the end of the day it’s still all my fault. I was using way too much leverage to begin with. It’s just going to be a long time to work back up the capital. 
It was a limit order set at 8158 set last night. 
Yes, I get you and I thought about that as I was writing it. The tricky part is the time frame being  used for considering it undervalued and overvalued. 

Is $20k overvalued right now? Yes. will it be? Who knows. 

My point was that the selling has been spectacular in the same way 2014 was. And thus the bear market is real in the exact same way 2014 was: btc was/is extremely overvalued, leading me to believe it could play out the same way. 

Thinking willybot changes the ramifications of the *selling* doesn't make sense to me. It certainly changes our understanding of how we got to such a ridiculous point in the first place, but the enormous selling and bearishness to come was legitimate regardless of why we were there in the first place. 

do you get what I'm saying? 

People come up for a bunch of reasons why the bubble burst in 2014 and how it's different this time, to which I say: well why are we selling off in an incredibly similar fashion? Isn't that *worse*?! 
I will add until the previous log support (on which we bounced at 6k and 7.2), hoping that it will bounce there as well. I have it at 8700 on finex. 

If this doesn't hold then we might visit the bottom of the ascending triangle  (it crosses the log downtrend from 19k around 8050)

https://www.tradingview.com/x/9ebSb23f/

Crash?!? ROFL
You are correct, this is a tight range.
I took profits at 8.8 then had reopened one after we broke through the support, which just got stopped out
> are you going to buy at $8700? $8500? $8300? $7800? 

What if it never gets there?
Parabolic advance -> Falling off a cliff.

Maybe it was a small blow off top though and we'll get caught by newfound support.
The bearish engulfing on the daily. 

Basically we need to blow through $9ks now or we'll have all sorts of bearish and hidden bearish divergences and double tops everywhere. 

A low volume/slow rise would not be good, and I'm not sure the exuberance is here to push us through $9k with ease. 
Thanks for the replies gents, much appreciated.

Would it also be worriesome how easily 9k fell considering the resistence it provided? Surely a solid support should have been there since it took so many attempts to slam through it?
Yeah it's kinda ridiculous. I remember back in January when longs opening meant the price  was going up in the next day and shorts opening the opposite 
Price, I believe. 
> To completely close you position you need to sell the amount you are long.

Yeah I just copied and pasted the exact BTC value and just placed a Stop-Limit Order, Stop at $8,900 and limit at $8,890 taking into account that I would want to close my position at $8,890 if the price hits $8,900.

I think I am right? What do you think?
I know how Stop-Limit works, used that quite often long ago on Poloniex. 

But when I choose this option on Bitfinex and click maximum amount to sell, it shows double the value of my already 3x leveraged position. This is where it gets confusing.
If you want to learn then don't go 25x for $50 move. It's crazy.

Go 5x, let it ride, then add if you're in profit and think it'll still go your way.

25x will rekt you sooner or later.
Grow up.. 
exactly, had no real evidence backing it (although it made sense) and it failed to trigger FOMO, clearly an unload signal, in retrospective of course.
you choose than to write here about your rubbish entry, than just closing your long at the same price and make the trade not existent?
I find myself Always trying to trade every dip and run. I’m not sure why. 
I mean, what do you classify as a pump for alts? There's nothing big going on from what I can see. 
https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8dtgp5/daily_discussion_saturday_april_21_2018/dxqllg8/?context=1
Yeah. :( I was disappointed and felt like a chump, too. 
Some fancy pants physicists say it can be both:
https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05663
https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/88earr/research_paper_on_bitcoin_bubbles_the_bitcoin/

>"Using a generalized Metcalfe’s law based on network properties, a fundamental value is quantified and shown to be heavily exceeded, on at least four occasions, by bubbles that grow and burst. In these bubbles, we detect a universal super-exponential unsustainable growth. We model this universal pattern with the Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity (LPPLS) model, which parsimoniously captures diverse positive feedback phenomena, such as herding and imitation."

That means tech adoption curve with FOMO and panic bubbles overlaid. Price could go down quite a bit without violating Metcalfe's law. 

In short, don't measure growth relative to FOMO driven ATH, measure relative to the underlying trend hidden beneath boom-bust cycles.
Somebody needs to create a side by side chart of tether printing/burning cycles and compare it with the BTC pump/dump cycles. In theory they should be correlated, no?

Print tether during BTC dumps and burn tether during BTC pumps , or at least that’s how it should be right?
Nope.  I'm commented several times that I think BTC is a million dollar token.  Just not now.

9.0 held but it might not hold again if someone gets an itchy sell finger. Not sure if it's a good strategy but I have laddered stops now, some at 9 and some at 8.8. My long position is from 9.25 average. I think if we bounce off 9 we'll bounce hard, so it's tempting to add to the position around there, but if we really are in a bull market then I guess I won't care about the difference between 9 and 9.2. But if we fall below 9 then I'll really care about the difference.

Yeah I felt uneasy about the growth, so sold at 9.7k. I was planning on setting a buy order at $9k before bed, so just bought when I woke up lol
Yea that'd make sense too. I jusy don't get the boxes as well, lmao. Yeah the more I listen to Peter the more I realize he's like a blank slate. It's hard to take him seriously if he's not posting trades. 

To be fair, he said his factor community thing closed ETH at like $670 after opening a long at $450. 

I find his trades to be much more reliable of his sentiment

Also nice to see you back, you seem to be in a better head space and are posting some great stuff. Hope you had a nice break from beetcoin.
 
Also thought your insight into how 2014 broke through the log line just to ride it downwards to be particularly interesting, we'll definitely have to watch out for that. 
Eth might be a shitcoin but is storing your net worth in the hands of miners in Communist China any better than running smart contracts on a platform micromanaged by a 24 year old tyrant? 

Probably not tbh. But then again fiat is even worse so I guess we're just screwed. 
Yes it is. Check USD price, check the ratio, look at a chart.
Which is extremely surprising.  But at the same time it's not...
Sorry, I should have clarified that I meant the BTC value.
i dont think you can compare november/december to now..that was just straight up irrational fomo all the way from 8k. anyway my point is that if longs are piling on in a bearish formation its time to gtfo

That lingo means Big Deeldo, either a green or a red one.
I've found the same. I suggest to also watch ETHUSD.  Noticing the ebb and flow between the 3 as they equalize seems to help get a feel for the divergences in momentum and direction. 
Very interesting to know. You are right, still early to say anything.

It is. I actually want somebody to study the relation between the two.
Tether / bitfinex owns them so they can do pump and dumps on 3rd party exchanges (otherwise if they only did it on the bitfinex exchange it would look weird that no other exchanges responded in kind).
aight imma check it out, thanks 
So nice of you

I forgot about packets. Possible game changer. 
sorry, can you explain what exchange/site this is? Im swiss and i did not know there was a swiss trading tool avalable.
Ok. And do I need a particular currency if I want to do either of those? I mean on the broker.
Reading this comment thread makes my fucking head hurt.

"It was only a matter of choosing when to exit".  Uhh... no shit.  Did anyone in here know when exactly the price was going to drop?  Or that it would be -$1k in a matter of minutes? 
You guys are kidding yourselves.  Put your money where your mouth is and show me your short position during the run up where you entered.
 
You have to spam the button. Might take you 10 times but it always works. 
Fees are amazing (you get paid for limit orders). It's really just the impossibility to get orders in during price action that is the problem. When shit gets real bad the whole site can go down and you can't even close your position. That only happened to me once though, but I was locked out unable to close my position or cancel bids for the $700 death candle on march 7th. If you are taking a high leverage trade you should put in at least a deep stop in case you cannot manually close it out.
Yeah, I need to work on that.  It just sucks when you put stops at -3% and it gets wicked then goes +7%...

I've been considering just trading less of my stack and putting in layered buys to keep entering into a position at better prices, but I'm pretty sure that is also a way to get yourself screwed harder.

I've also considering leaving exit stops AND re-enter stops at further prices to try to dampen the loss on downward trends without completely exiting.  I'm trying to work the math out on that and understand how it compares to laddered stops or layered entry orders.  I guess the main difference is that it would roughly maintain the net size of the position vs. layered stops which takes you progressively out of the position or layered entries which can get you stuck in a small position if the market moves the way you want right away.  Probably all of those are options depending on your overall feel for market direction...
I really think people who are buying in now or at 6k have 100% unrealistic expectations of what will happen.

When I bought at 2-3 dollars, I expected 10 dollars max. Hell, I sold a fuckton at 10 dollars

When I was buying last year at 1-2k, I was expecting 3k max.

Now I hear people expecting XRP to go to 100
True, I'm watching 8.4k and 8k as well, but these are not levels I would put my trust in to hold.
There are many definitions and variations, but it originated in the stock market where it actually makes sense. First, the securities have poor past performance. Second, the decline is "correct" in that the underlying business is weak (e.g. declining sales or shaky financials). Along with this, it is doubtful that the security will recover with better conditions (overall market or economy).

A "dying" stock doing a dead cat bounce is not the same as a crashing crypto having a (temporary) recovery. 
He updated it with the new tether information from this morning.  But I will look for his other post.
I'm not here to argue how correct any theory is across every single stock ever issued, or to claim that a theory published in a magazine in 1970 is still 100% valid in a world where algos do - what percentage is it now? - of the trading.

I'm just reminding you that words have meaning, and if you want to dispute something as entrenched as EMH, you can't just post that it has been "proven" wrong. It hasn't been "proven" wrong. 

Being WRONG about how long the price of a stock will stay above your buy price, or about whether the stock price will immediately continue to go up, down or sideways, isn't the same as being irrational. The price is still only responding to new information.

In the case of Palm, the article in your link omits a few pertinent bits of info:

- 3Com was going to offer the stock at $16 but had to raise it to $38 due to demand
- Only 5% of the Palm shares were tradeable on that first day
- The 1.5 share distribution to 3Com shareholders was waiting on a tax ruling, so those shares weren't immediately available.

From my googling, it was widely reported that not enough shares were available for trading and this led to the surprising but not inexplicable valuation.

Sure, everyone was surprised at the time that Palm ended up valued higher than its parent company, but there were plenty of explanations for it - this was eight days before the NASDAQ peaked, Palm had a 68% market share in PDAs, dot com fever was running high etc etc.

You can still make a bad buy. But it's not because of irrationality. 


No problem.  
Like last time, it went up $100.  
I opened a small long just to test that :)
Thinking 8.2-8.6k if were bullish. Hard to say. Depends on the long situation, I will close out when they capitulate.  
It broke down but i can upload the chart in a sec so u can see
https://www.tradingview.com/x/ic5TVBiH/
A lot. If you don't believe me, try it in the next 72 hours.

[clarification: you'll only lose your stop, but you'll lose.  Do you want to lose? Short at 9700 in the next 72 hours. Someone smarter will obtain your money.]
Exactly my point! "Dump -> consolidate, bounce up a bit and try to climb, repeat" is not good for long term upwards movement. 

"dump incredibly hard and bounce even harder" is better imo. 

Capitulation wick are better than "try again" over and over and over
sorry, I'm asking if going forward you could reply to yourself (or post again even) rather than burying in ninja edit. I've had a few pm's asking me how to get notifications from you, so im indeed not the only one :P

thanks though! 
Zapier
But would you?

I'm thinking about longing here. Bounce wasn't so good but it bounced where it should.
I feel the same about shorting.  I wouldn't short this right now, but I've done pretty well longing lately.  Good luck either way.
This has happened to everyone. Honest advice: take a break because there’s a decent chance you’re on tilt. You don’t always have to be in a position. Better to only take a position when you’re confident. You will be more successful and your head will be clearer. (Easier said than done, I know)
I figure if more than 3 trades a week is "too many" for Peter Brandt, than it's probably too many for me
remember parabolicTrav drew a chart that's parabolic/vertical/ bends time-axis backwards,
I'd be interested. You pick the ranges, let's see if there's any predictive value in it.
Sure I'd be interested. Is lending rate not correlated generally to, say, amount of shorts open on bfx? I'm not super in the know on how lending rates work for bfx
I'd be super interested in that data. 
Since margin longs require borrowing bitcoin, the exchange that lends the bitcoin may choose to liquidate the long position if there is a risk that the borrower will not be able to repay their debt obligation. As the price drops, there is more risk of this occurring.
Thanks a lot! I did not know that
Completely agree. Good luck!! 
Yeah, you would have to use a proxy service to trade on Bitmex, so you are correct, kraken is your best bet if you want to use margin down the line. Though i think most people in the US do just use Bitmex with a proxy. Not sure on that one.

Bitmex is a derivatives trading platform, which means you're not actually buying and selling bitcoin, but buying and selling futures contracts instead. Just google futures trading if you want more info on that.

Trading the actual USD/BTC pair is called trading "spot" as opposed to trading "futures".
You're welcome. I hope it helps you. 
I agree. I don't really mind cutting wicks on the 15 though
Would you consider shorting a lower high around 9.2-9.3 if we get up there and then just kind of hang and do nothing? 
Absolutely.  By the way, was that short from 9650 based on RSI going crazy or was there known resistance at $9800 that you thought we would bounce hard from like we did? 

I know you were saying a retrace was imminent at some point, but that had been true for a few days, and plenty of people shorted on the way up and got REkT.  How’d you know when to short there? 
You secure your short position before you crash the market.
I closed today my 5x short from 8100 @9100... Should have used stops on that one. Cost me 30% of my stack. Revenge trading with too tight stops cost me another 10%... 
Got stopped from my 8825 long @8869 when the lowest it got was 8865...
My hope now is getting my long from 9000 to 9500 so i can calm down, get a grip and working to recoup my losses 
Yea so bit of a stretch...but there will be bearish divergences as well, unless it explodes upwards. 


Kill that feeling quick, because you will burn out from trading very quickly that way. 

Trading is about patience and discipline- this is why HODL is so prominent as a trading strategy:

The people in crypto are extremely impatient and undisciplined- they remove those qualities from fhe equation and disallow them from destroying potential profits by literally not ever touching their position after entering. 

If you can develop patience and discipline- you will likely outperform these people in the end, but it's extremely difficult. Which is why most people here shouldn't trade. Because they're doing more  high risk gambling than trading. 
He means 8978. The number of trades this guy makes per hour dictates there's no way he has a trade from there.

Plus we never even got there. 
It’s open from there. Prob stops above 9200 I’ll add on way up 
it was difficult to pull the trigger but that feeling is almost always when I make my best entries! 

I even let my limit order for $9680 on futs hit after we visited $9500. Feels good man
You can read the whitepaper. Tether only can create new tethers when they have USD in their bank account. So you are saying a 30 minute price difference on binance made it so 130 million dollars hit the Tether bank accounts and thus allowing them to print according to their white paper?

You are delusional. 
And here I am currently scaling into a new one...
from what? I'm just pissed off by this shitcoin pump and moonboy talk.
Yeah, that may be true. But i assure you the learning process will be much more rewarding if you can actually find solid reasons to enter or exit the market.

If you keep jumping in and out at seemingly random points you're gonna have a bad time and will most likely start revenge trading. Or worse, you'll be right and feel like you've got this trading thing covered, start using higher stakes and then get extra burnt.


Don’t forget about the .26% fee .

They fucking hurt 
Lol yeah you're going to be fine. Keep it small and simple at first. As you get better, increase position size so it stings just a bit when you lose. You don't learn unless you learn how to lose :) 
Fair enough. One more thought, be careful about roping your gf in before you've even gotten rolling with it and learned how to lose as well as how to win. If she's somewhat reluctant, you convince her, and she loses money, that will not go well, trust me.
That's a great mentality to have. Keep up the hard work.
He's trying to help you, don't take it the wrong way. From what I understand, he lost a lot on a margin short a while back (although I'm sure he's up significantly despite that) and advises against it now. Which is really not bad advice. 

Especially for newer traders

Ok, either way, how does that spell out 6 months? Where are you getting the 6 months from? Other than comparisons to 2014, which would be longer than 6 more months anyway.
As you can see from the [many charts I have already posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8eqr52/daily_discussion_wednesday_april_25_2018/dxz21e6/), yes I expect a retest of the support at 8.2k.

The tricky part about shorting now is where is your stoploss and the potential gain to 8200 is now only $600. The R/R is fast decreasing the lower we go.

It could be one giant DCB and chewie found the [scariest case](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8dbx5s/daily_discussion_thursday_april_19_2018/dxmy338/) a few days ago. Where we now slowly roll down the log line until final capitulation. My opinion is the last runup was very bullish overall and has changed my medium term outlook to bull. We just moved too much too fast but the signs the market is bottoming are here.

Funny how things come back around here is a perfect example of how we bottomed in 2013/14 https://www.tradingview.com/x/3k9jnjwO/ (Ignore the long cascade liquidation wicks, it was a different time back then)
[deleted]
I’ll bail sub 8.9k most likely.

Did u add on that dip again? 
So conflicted whether I should take profits here or if it'll keep breaking down. If I get stopped out at b-e I'll really be beside myself.
then this shit be cray. But have you considered the possibility that it does? 

It's easy to imagine the trend continuing but we rose 43% with no more than a 5% pullback, it's gonna happen at some point 
It also bounced off the [Tekan-San](https://snag.gy/qmfDMw.jpg) and good support below.

Still bullish trend [overall](https://snag.gy/ZfeA5j.jpg) we have [going](https://snag.gy/G3b7sX.jpg). 
I'm not so sure.
You don't need a 'stop limit' order here, just a 'limit' @ 8900. Stop limits are for something else and you don't generally need to use them.
I've no idea then sorry. 
That's taking into account the leftover collateral to open another position. So if you have a short from 9K with a target of 6K and your limit at 6K you hit the green button to max out the order when that order fill it will close your position and open a position up using your full balance(+profits) the opposite direction. If that makes any sense...

EDIT: So just set the value of the stop or target to the current open position or use the OCO order types (has a stop and target and will trigger whichever hits first and removes the other order)
I absolutely agree. However, I am using funds I literally could care less about losing.  I never use more than 5x leverage on my main trading stack. 
Probably addiction, chasing lost profits, or mental burnout. All are recipes for disaster. You may need to ban yourself from trading until your head is on straight. I guarantee you opportunities will still be there when you come back.
Most im tracking have been are being rejected on the way up with bitcoin. 
Very interesting. Thanks for the encouragement!
as said there only was 30m tether ever burnt if im not wrong.

They never "burn" tokens.
They print Tether to keep the price at or slightly below $1.   The crypto space is growing in terms of users.   If people continually want Tether, they need to print more, or else it'll go up to $1.10 or something.
And how does that work? There is no USD at either poloniex / binance. What you are saying is that they just print tether whenever there is demand for it and not when they actually get new USD into a bank account to back it.
Yeah this is really shitty territory.  8.8~9.0 might get gobbled up too, but you need to set a limit somewhere for the loss...  No easy calls except staying out, probably need to mitigate the risk closely but I really don't know here.
I looked away for 20 minutes and it dropped hundreds haha feels bad buying back in so early 
What exactly can Miners in China do to your Bitcoin? Censor a transaction? They can't double spend, they can't take your coins. They can't really do anything except refuse to include your transaction in their block. Which is why there are plenty of other miners out there who don't care about you and will happily include your transaction
ETH classic?
meaning... a more down reaction.
Oh well ... lets see. Bugs always will be fixed
ok, but that was a freakout imo. it bottomed out over the past 5 weeks and started pumping 2 weeks ago
yep i am feeling the same, im into fiat 100&#37; of my trading stack since 9300, targets to buy back are 8,8 or 8,5 depending on momentum
Figured, just never seen it without the respective colour in there haha

Well, i have a small short open. so i'm spamming f5 for downwards movement ;)
I used to think your posts had merit but you're actually just full of shit. 
Username checks out.
My dream is to be like this guy:

“Former teenage soldier hatched millions from Chinese egg futures”

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-markets-eggfutures/former-teenage-soldier-hatches-millions-from-chinese-egg-futures-idUSKCN0Q703M20150802

Apparently 150x leverage was available in Chinese agro futures lol
Freakin Ver and his chicken salad sandwiches.
You just need your money deposited with the broker. You can buy any pair with it. Doesn't have to be in the currency you deposited.

If you deposit 100$ with your broker you can buy any pair worth 100$ , or more if you use leverage.
>  Did anyone in here know when exactly the price was going to drop? 

I shorted at $9700 and covered at $8800.  If that makes your head hurt, then I can't do much about that.  And if you think you need to "know exactly" what the price is going to do, then you are beyond help.  Shorting at $9700 was a slam dunk, no brainer.  

Read "wardser"'s comments for the last 18 hrs.  He called everything almost perfectly, because this is classic market action that we have seen many, many times before.  Not everyone is so ignorant and clueless.
some people here shorted $9600+...
Shot man - thanks for the advice. I recently had such a bad experience on WhaleClub. I took some of my BTC over there (approx $2,000) - read through the fees "example" which stated that leverage fees are charged at 0.15% every 24 hours. So.. opened a X10 short over night which turned a small 10% profit next day - only to find that the financing cost was ACTUALLY 9% per DAY!!! Thats like 3000% of something a year to finance BTC through them. Actual fees cleverly hidden away. Didnt even think that it was possible for exhanges to charge that much... ALL other exchanges ask a fraction of that. So yea... my entire position was liquidated due to financing - even tho I made a "profit". They are the WORST!!! 2k down the drain. 
So what's even the point then? Markets never have perfect information or behaviour, so the use case for it is just academic made up
well donr
You'll only lose your stop, but you'll lose.

And why would that loss be "a lot", genius?
No, I totally hear you.

I've had numerous requests to do that in the past. I just hate to post two top-level comments right after each other. This is the first time somebody has suggested this solution, and I think this one is fine. I'll start replying to my own comments afterwards if I open a new position.
no, probably not. I'd probably keep it open at this point.
I remember.. lol so on Dec 12  the closing price was both 16k and 18k because it circled back.

Lol you mean during the first week of December when the price began going [hyper-parabolic](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iadwp/bitcoin_chart_has_broken_al_barriers_now/) so much it started going [back in time](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7i7qch/latest_projections_show_btc_will_break_the_time/)? 
For the moment, this is the best I can do:

http://www.polobot.net/ratehistory

I could fill a database table with daily high/low values of BTC to overlay on the chart to make it an easy comparison, but I don't have that at the moment.  Doing a manual back check, rising rates on BTC tend to indicate future price downturns whereas rising rates on USD lending tend to indicate future price upturns.  
Hmm, I assume that is what is happening on Kraken?  Spot?  That was one of my questions.  When I'm opening a position on kraken I was having trouble understanding precisely what I was doing.  Was I buying BTC with my money?  Am I putting money in a fund?  Am I buying a future? 
Depends on how the market gets there. If the market bounces off of the log resistance line and confirms it as new support, I'd likely be hesitant to open any shorts in the immediate future.
Yes that's obvious. But who is gonna buy the profit again? 
I know the struggle, been there.

You're rushing it. Don't force yourself into position.
True, we’ll just have to wait and find out. 
check pm's
Yeah typo lol.  I say I’m going to make a lot of trades and get cold feet. I usually make 2-4 trades a day 
I see. I was wondering if it got there on some crazy low-liquidity exchange
Solid. I shorted 9750 as well last night. Exited 9680 I think lol. It's 11.7K all over again.
Just looked at the omni explorer. The merely moved the tethers, they didint print any new ones since 3/20/18.
Don't ask bitcoinmarkets to admit tether is a scam.  It's not going to happen.  "It doesn't look like anything to me" 
You are really fucking stupid. Exchanges send and receive tether when they have excess and deficiency. With the amount of selling that's been going on today it's only natural that reserves need to be replenished.

Now, on behalf of r/bitcoinmarkets, I have a message for you that reflects your downvotes: 

Fuck off and stop posting.
I guess I would understand if I was risking a loss of hundreds or even thousands of dollars.  I'm literally putting $2 on the line.  I am reading his criticisms and trying to understand his points, I just wish he was a little cooler about it.  Thats all.  My feelings aren't hurt.  I'll learn one way or the other! :)
Sometimes hunger is what drives people! :)
Its just another way of saying a long time. We would probably bulltrap first for a few weeks then bleed down very slowly. If its exactly six months or not idk, but its my opinion it would be at least that when I look at how the market has behaved this year.
If you haven't already read this paper, these guys basically argue that the 20k price was overvalued simply because of the super-exponential pattern of the runup to that price: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05663.pdf.
yes
Could take 50% out or some other percentage to hedge it
I have not really considered anything below my entry.

I know the growth was very quick. Not really sure how does this growth and retrace works.
> just a 'limit' @ 8900.

Wouldn't that close my position straight away as there are buy orders above this price. I am going to try it now, please confirm. 
I think I cracked it mate, thanks for your input! :)
It is making sense. What I just did is I chose Stop-Limit, set my stop to 8,900 and limit to $8,880 and clicked margin sell. I also copied and pasted the exact value of my position in BTC (thus ignoring the collateral/double)

The order has been put into place. Do you think it will work in my case and will close my position when it hits limit? Cheers!
So why even bother?
Uh huh, literally 1-2% ratio gain on most, our definition of pumping seems to be different, but oh well.
so what  you say they print money from thin air? ;)
Oof! 
Still up for the week, so I can't complain yet
They can stop mining right now and you will be lucky to get 5 blocks mined per day until the adjustment. 
Correct, I'd consider 2 weeks is an acceptable duration for the parabolic phase of the alt season. And it makes sense for this one not to last as long as the December/January season considering how violent that was. I expect a longer accumulation phase before another major alt season like that one.
It only comes in two colors, sizes may vary. Check the 30 min chart and you will find plenty.
So I can deposit 100 CHF and go short on USD/CHF which essentially means that I sell USD instead of CHF? That doesn't matter?
I don't believe you executed that trade.  Can you post proof?
Also I checked some of wardser's posts from yesterday.  He literally said, "I think this will go past $11k" as well as, "I would never short this market".


The use case is that the claim that Stock X is "undervalued" is not based on anything actually fundamental or analytical.

And if you run around trying to buy "undervalued" stock and short "overvalued" stock, you won't *necessarily* make more money than passive investment funds. 

And if you DO make more money, it's not because you applied some cool theory of stock valuation or whatever. It's either because you had *new information* or you were lucky.




A loss is a loss and a loser is a loser. i don't want to be a loser so I don't short things when they're clearly trending up... and I never use stop losses, by the way, even on stocks.  If I believe in the value of the investment, I double down if it goes down.  Stop losses are guaranteed losses for guaranteed losers IMHO.
You are the best, thank you 
A few more stalkers and you can front run your own calls ;)
Thanks, as always. V Kind of you.
Finally :-D

I could swear I suggested that one but it was so long time ago that I might be wrong.
I never understand the difference of opening a new position and keeping an old open. It is just the negligible fee isn’t it ?
Yes, Kraken trades spot. You are buying Bitcoin directly. You're finding someone else on Kraken who wants to sell Bitcoin at the price you want to buy at and Kraken exchanges the money on your account for bitcoin on his account. You now have bitcoin he now has Fiat.
Not that we will, but I think we could be range bound between $1k and $20k for years.

Greedy, illiquid market that likes to keep its profits on paper.
That long also close red... Closing in on 50% stack loss in a week... 
Yeah it's hard not to exit so quickly after entering like that. But as I said [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8eho8a/daily_discussion_tuesday_april_24_2018/dxwzz3e) it's generally what $11.7k did so it helped me hold through the bounce and second rejection 
He's assuming you're losing that much because believe it or not, that's what some newer traders here put on the line when they start margin trading. 

Anyway, it's nearing your stop- if you take a loss here it's a good thing, genuinely. Every new trader I see here that goes on a win streak at the beginning ends up blowing it all and more later. 


[deleted]
Good stuff boss. Already in green 
What's your entry? Very dangerous not to have an exit plan, if it gets close you will panic. Not trying to scare you, but you should plan now vs later just in case 
Yes sorry the price is on the move. So now you want to protect your position if the price moves below 8900. This is where you use a stop order correct. The stop limit you previously suggested would also work as you intend. 
So what happens then is once the price hits 8900 then a limit order will be put into the book for 8800. If you have a long with that setup then it sounds about right. If there's already an order in the book at that price it will be executed as a market order if not you will have to wait for someone to fill it. This can be an issue if you get a BGD or a BRD where it blows 1K one way or another so your stop price hits but your limit is never filled. The only way around this is to use market stop I think which can still screw you.
that’s the dumbest argument I have ever heard

And I’ve heard a lot of dumb arguments
Yes that means you're selling USD.

Basically sell doesn't mean selling currency in real terms. That's what you're confused about. In USD/CHF pair sell is a term used to signify that the price of USD will go down with respect to CHF. Buy is a term used to signify that the price of USD will go up with respect to CHF.

So yes you can deposit 100 and go short and you will be selling(implying that the price of usd will go down) USD instead of CHF
> I don't believe you executed that trade. 

LOL.  Believe whatever you need to, in order to make it through the day.   

I know it may hurt to accept that not everyone is as confused as you, but clearly that is the case.  Just as true that wardser and chewtoy are much traders than I am.

> The use case is that the claim that Stock X is "undervalued" is not based on anything actually fundamental or analytical.

Yeah, like my example. ANd most stocks, since they do not pay dividends based on the price.

However if something is well below their mean value(regression to mean theory) vs high above, probably its better to buy the lower one, if as you said all fundamentals are the same


>And if you DO make more money, it's not because you applied some cool theory of stock valuation or whatever. It's either because you had new information or you were lucky.


Or you just are good at reading the price action

It's funny sometimes how even simple solutions can be overlooked. I post comments on reddit dozens of times a day, yet it never occurred to me to just reply to my own comment to solve the problem. 

I believe your request was always to just post a new top-level comment, which to me was less than ideal.
There is no difference. 

But I already closed my previous long. 

He was asking if, hypothetically speaking, I'd have closed it at $9,070 a few hours ago if I still had it open. 

My sentiment at the time was no. I'd have been wrong. 
Cool, that was my assumption but wasn't sure.  Thanks for the info!
No, what i mean is , there was a freaking whale that crashed the market. And now it is even more loaded. I know well enough that i will move on from that day. 
Don't rush it, don't revenge trade.

I really been there. You just need to calm down and wait for good r/r position with good stops.
So....I'm leaning going long for another run up to 9.7K for a double top. I'm not sure I count a double top an hour apart on the 15m chart. 

edit to add: double top possibility, with interim targets of 9250. I layered in small buys under 9K, but I may pull them. I knew 87xx was the place to pull the trigger. 

edit2: well shit, I just caught an 8985 wick on June futures. It was just at 9070 and wicked $80. Guess I'm in this now. 
Haha.  Ya, we're getting close.  Hoping it holds!  Ya I wouldn't want to win too hard too early, would just ruin all the fun right? :)
I figure there are some mechanical lessons to be learned before I get too crazy. As others have pointed out I've gotta figure out how I determine when do take a position that had some meat to the reasoning. I wouldn't want to risk big money until I develope that. 
Hopefully it holds! good job on that short btw
not anymore :(
> What's your entry?

My entry is $8,955. 

> Very dangerous not to have an exit plan

Agreed 100%. Actually I do have action plans in place just in case. However, the bottom line for this trade is that, I am not going to close it for the next four days (my target is not too and I will try my best to stick with it). 

> if it gets close you will panic

Even if it plunges more, or goes below my entry (I don't see a highly likelyhood of that), I am still going to ride this trade. I have my 11.15% gains from last week which are acting as good support and helping me make non-cloudy and improved decisions.
I see. :) 
Yeah it is similar to Poloniex Stop-Limit. It is just that the UI is different so I had been hesitant all this time to try it. Thanks mate!
Ok. I got a clearer picture now. Thanks :)
Yeah, except I've been trading these markets for two years now and am getting sick of LARPers trading a .01 btc stack and talking shit like they know what's what.  You're gambling.  In the old days you couldn't even comment text posts regarding trades *unless* you posted an accompanying screenshot.  I see no reason why you can't post proof.

Maybe, doesn't really matter right now. Just happy you won't edit ;-)

BTW, nice call on that short, but not sure about this long.
Last try, we are at the top of the flag. Short with stops above 9100.
Thanks for your help, i know you are right, but i'm too much of a gambler...
If fails i'll stick to following chewy for a while (another mistake there (following another trader blindly ) but its either that or quitting trading) 
I also think a run back up to 9.7 could very much be in the cards. Seems like traders are a little too certain that the bear reversal is a done deal and this is a setback compared to what I think the general public is feeling. Will most likely still be shorting 9.2-9.3 with stops at 9350
I didn't mean to imply that was a double top on the 15m, it was just me justifying holding through a short revisit so I didn't close early. 

I think it's very possible we revisit $9.7. 

But I don't know if we have the momentum to blast through.  a larger pullback + bounce and strong run up would help.
 
Trying to break $9.7k from here will more likely fail imo. 
Haha yeah. Basically it just teaches you bad habits and you never have to self evaluate, which is crucial to getting better at trading. 
You gonna close? 

I’m 91$ under water nothing crazy it would wipe out a good part of my gains from yesterday 
Yep it's the same thing I think... Anyway good luck!
> I see no reason why you can't post proof.

Maybe because it's a waste of my valuable time and I care absolutely not at all if you believe me or not. It's actually more entertaining to see you have a fit because you can't believe anyone would have done a textbook trade that you still manage to miss and screw it up.
Ya, looks like I had more confidence in the fomo buying pressure than I should have. 

Technically speaking, this could fall a lot farther.
I left my buy orders in from 8950-8800 on futures. If they hit, I'll hedge the same amount between 9200-9300 on swaps for funding/profit lock. 

I actually think we might get a dip here on mex due to funding. Normally it's immaterial, but the funding rate on shorts is insanity. 
Not sure if you're saying I'm positive we're not visiting $9.7k again but I wouldn't be surprised at all to revisit $9.7k here.. Oddly enough I think retrying $9.7k from here would be more bearish than, say, going to $7.8-8.3k and trying again. 
Oh, yeah, I doubt we'd break 9700. We'd legit double top and then on to goblin town :P

But seriously, I'd be a little surprised if we get back 9300 if we climb there now. A bounce off our channel bottom (8550) back to >9K would probably be needed. I'm not sure anymore. But you're sitting pretty raking in that funding. 
Ya my stop loss got hit even though I didn't see the kraken price go that low.  Lowest I saw was 8966 and it triggered my stop.  
not closing until 8800 breaks
Thanks for taking out your time and wish you the same!
You're just another larper.  Enjoy pretending like you're Gordon Gecko day trading with pennies and soapboxing about perfectly predicting btc price action intra-day.  The absolute fucking state of bitcoinmarkets lol
You still holding till below 8800?
Not sure if you saw /u/arsonbunny's post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8eqr52/daily_discussion_wednesday_april_25_2018/dxxyqfw/) but if he's correct then the big guys are unloading into the FOMO.
Well, I would enter this one with stops below 9k if I could sit and watch. I couldn't so I didn't. Good trade in terms of rr so I think it was also a good call. Market just decided to go other way.
I wish I had kept my shorts open from 9650. Closed them out at the chop at 9100 and reopened at 9050 and got a little extra profit but would have loved to just let them sit pretty. Currently out of position. That said after a bad week last week it is nice to be making some profitable trades again. 
Nah I wasn't saying that, I was just saying I thought it was possible
Stop losses are notoriously annoying for that reason :) That's calling getting wicked out 😅 


The nice thing? Looks like it was a good/smart stop so far. 
ya, not worth it to cut it loose between two support zones. Might as well wait until $8,800 falls with conviction.
For fun, I just went 1x long at 8925 at 3:58 and set a limit sell at 8990, which executed. Dat funding swing. 
Hope you realize I was kidding, lol. 

How's everything? You still taking a break? 
Interesting.  I'll have to do some reading on that. Do people normally put their stop loss below the actual price they want to hit for that reason? 
Interesting.  Closed my long from 9050 at 8995.  We’ll see.  This wouldnt be the first time I regret being on the other side from you.  Maybe it will be the first time I don’t regret it 😅
Waiting to reenter a short, Shorted from 9650 to 9150 and again from 9100 to 8900 but out of position for now. Glad to have a few solid trades in the green now.
Definitely. I like to set my stop losses a good 2-3% past what I'd set ideally and adjust position size accordingly
Ah. It looks like I would've got stopped anyway but that's a good lesson I suppose. 
like I said much better you lose st first anyway. You would have learned nothing if you won
