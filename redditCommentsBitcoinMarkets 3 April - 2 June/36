man people really love to buy and sell their bitcoin in the $9k range
The bounce back to $9400 was impressive. Of course it won't be that impressive until $10K falls, but if we can hang out above $9000 for a week or two, I would be thrilled.
That you closing Mike?
Something just occurred to me... 

Almost everyone in crypto is trading to accumulate either more fiat or Bitcoin. This notion is fairly widely-subscribed to but most people don't follow this path to its logical conclusion. 

Think about it, where is this fiat and Bitcoin going to? Where does it end up? Why do people *care* to acquire more fiat or Bitcoin. The answer, if you think about it (open-mindedly, without bias and with great critical thought) is very straightforward. People are acquiring these two items only as a means to purchase lunch from subway, which in the *vast majority* of cases is a 6-inch tuna sub. 

Now think about it. If there is *consensus* that this is the preferred asset for those that enjoy lunch *and* all crypto and fiat is eventually directed at these purchases, *it clearly makes sense* from both an investment and culinary standpoint to hodl tuna and bread as opposed to fiat and Bitcoin. 

So, with that, it's been a pleasure discussing Bitcoin trading with you folks but I've decided to trade up for a boat, a reel and a field to grow some wheat. Some people can't foresee obvious market trends in advance. This is what separates good traders from bad.

Good luck to all. 
Just incase you don't read down below, here are the ETF dildo's from Finex on March 10th 2017.

All I will say is, a lot of people thought that would be the end of that run once the application had been denied.  

/r/Buttcoin started heavily jerking each other off, yet here we are at 8x the price a year later. 
Just looked at the market for the first time since yesterday afternoon, what happened at bitfinex?? That's one of the biggest 1 min candle I've ever seen.

Anyway, I got stopped out of half of my long (layered buy between 8780 and 9050) at 9050, still keeping the 2nd half. 

Update on the multi-lane channel I posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8f8uou/daily_discussion_friday_april_27_2018/dy2637x/): https://www.tradingview.com/x/EqpJF1lL/

Apart from that giant  1 min candle, it's holding! Nice bounce on the bottom black line. We're certainly making higher lows. If we bounce off of it once again I'll be thinking of adding to my position. 

Have a great week-end everyone. 


I don't know what to do anymore. Closed my long from 9.2 at a loss yesterday and wake up to this. I'm just broken. Long/short, I don't know where to go from here. I can't keep losing my stack like this. I'm just whale food.  

Edit: Thanks for the advice everyone, I appreciate it. It's like I know what to do deep down but I really need it told to me over and over in order for it to sink in. 
**tl;dr opinion: fundamentals are strong**

Localbitcoins transactions still trending upward with an ATH almost every day: https://anacoinda.github.io/localbitcoins/all.html. 

Way faster than the trend in in 2014 (if you can read the chart).

USD volume at 50% below peak but stabilizing. 

I keep repeating it, but *these are the fundamentals you're looking for.* More and more people are willing to pay a full 1% for a transaction, which means they're not short term speculators. In my opinion, these are mostly small-time buyers trying to get in while Bitcoin is lying low - perhaps as a means to buy alts & tokens?

Going off the volume, and particularly the currencies associated with this volume, *over 10% of all Bitcoin transactions* are developing-world peer-to-peer transactions: RUB, NGN and VEF alone account for 75% of all Localbitcoins transactions.

**This is where the action is, no margin trading, stop loss hunting, whale watching, just plain old peer-to-peer trading.**

A nice year for Bitcoin market impacts. First we had the new chart formations Bart and Marge, and now we have a new candle stick style(compared to shooting star and whatever) called dual lightsaber

We are winning in the TA space guys!
We should get some nice volatile bullish movement soon, [4hr BB's](https://snag.gy/2bklis.jpg) tight and starting to go opposite each other. 
_looks at gdax_ what the hell are you guys talking about??

_looks at finex_ oh.
I missed whatever nonsense happened on Bitfinex live...does anyone who watched it live have a more detailed play-by-play? Was it a huge sell followed by a huge buy of similar size?

I'm wondering if a whale fat-fingered a sell, and then quickly market bought their coins back at a loss before the market ran away from them, or something. Could be our favorite spoof whale accidentally setting a limit sell for $930 instead of $9,300 (having it execute instantly as a market sell) and then scrambling to buy the coins back.

Just a theory, it depends on how the price action actually went down second by second. 

Or really it could be that a cat ran across some whale's keyboard and we're all here looking for deeper meanings for no reason....
Following a conversation yesterday about a bot to track Chewy's positions i started playing around with a simple logger that tracks the positions and will have the possibility to check the history of a users positions.
[Simple open positions interface](http://bitcoinmarkets.atwebpages.com/index.php).

I'm testing on a test subreddit [https://www.reddit.com/r/justanotherlogin/comments/8fkk5i/daily_thread/](https://www.reddit.com/r/justanotherlogin/comments/8fkk5i/daily_thread/). 
There are some examples there and the bot is running so if you enter a position there it should update on the page within a few seconds.  

This way everyone could use the bot to log their positions and later to have their trading history as well as the history for the other users. 
Will add a link to the original comment so people can check the reasons behind each position and judge for themselves. 

I'm open for suggestions. 
Note: this is still under development so its pretty simples and might have bugs
hidden sell wall on finex at 9,425.

Can't say how big, but it's been soaking up buys for a couple minutes now.

Edit: aaand it's down, everyone fomo!
That [candle](https://gyazo.com/31578bb4d3c2badaa510062498616876) be lookin' like a [double-edged lightsaber](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Double-bladed_lightsaber?file=Darth_Maul_lightsaber_reveal.png) yo.
someone more intelligent then me needs to explain this to me...wtf
Another ridiculous candle on BitFinex, 2K sold in a minute at $9,412.
People talk a lot about low volume / high volume. 

How do I see the volume of trades? I’m mostly on GDAX.


And what numbers are considered high or low?

And generally speaking what does volume changes tell you about predicting price fluctuations?

Thanks!
Buying the rumor: 

- Nasdaq offering Bitcoin trading 

- Bitcoin ETF approval 

- Hype over 2020 halving 

- Major central banks allocating % of reserves in BTC 

- Major merchant adoption when LN becomes viable 




But nah guys, these will never ever happened. Bitcoin has probably peaked.... lol

--- 

Seriously though it's so fucking easy for the price to explode in the future it's not even funny. I've seen the days when even hearing the word "Bitcoin" on TV would create a mass circle jerk to now where we hear it everyday and CNBC and hedge fund managers are shilling BTC 24/7. Things are moving fast, and a lot of people don't appreciate the unique position bitcoin is in. Longest history, longest up-time, best developers, best security, proven resilience, most liquidity, largest network, most reputable by the public,  blah blah blah... you've heard me beat this dead horse already and I no longer care about educating the idiots who don't get it. Even little things like the futures market, not only legitimizes bitcoin as an asset class, it provides hedging options for institutional traders that isn't avaliable with alts. Some people are under the impression Bitcoin is threatened by altcoins with "better tech" .... I don't think anything has come even close to threatening Bitcoin. Bitcoin is where everyone else wants to be, while the rest hasn't even grown out of their crib yet. [Decentralization](https://medium.com/@Bitcom21/the-long-game-in-crypto-why-decentralization-matters-fd681ff5ed0) in a global banking system matters. And decentralization isn't easy... getting to where we are now wasn't easy and it took a bunch of miracles imo. I think Bitcoin has surpassed its biggest hurdles, we're at a point of no return and it's smooth sailing until the rumors come true
Added $1MM to my [$2MM short @ $8722](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ezv0s/z/dxzqcd4). Current position $3MM @ $8895. I'm still expecting substantial downward movement, but will consider this trade lost if we break the $9400 range with conviction. 
The daily chart looks rather good for the bulls: 

- it’s hugging the upper band for the first time since late 2017
- the big bearish engulfing candle happened but the price didn’t even get the middle of the band before reversing (might be too soon, but it looks that way) 
- last time the price was over 9400 we were screaming about ~~oversold~~ (overbought) rsi well guess what ?

i was just reading up on the bitmex fees.. is it a pretty safe bet that most bitmex traders quietly gamble away all their funds and disappear?  I wondering if their user base is shrinking.

This is the most epic stop hunting candle I ever have seen https://imgur.com/a/CRD9FXF

I love this market
Wake up this morning with 2 of my stop buys triggered. Bitcoin went up and triggered the last buy at 9410 and dived back in, not what I was hoping for but whatever, this thing is going up.   
To sum up 400k@9330 25x.  
Limit buy @9171   
SL@9040  
Good luck yall 
A nice by-product of the high lending rates is that this rise is driven exclusively by unleveraged buying; margin longs and shorts have stayed constant (actually, longs have even slightly decreased).
The interesting thing to take from the full retard Finex 1min wicks was it broke 2 upper resistances but none down. 

ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED.
8.9-9.9k continues to provide resistance (see my previous posts) and this is what results:  https://www.tradingview.com/x/bClk6wPO/

Purple & Green ascending triangle is invalidated when the resistance line breaks.  The price touches 62% fib but fails to confirm break of fib by clearing a new higher high and psychological resistance at 10k.  The price breaks below green support trendline.

Coming off of 62% fib resistance, the black curve which had over 6 points of contact finally broke.  Breaking this unsustainable short term parabolic trend growth was inevitable and not surprised it happened here against strong resistance.  That was our best short entry, especially since it broke right where pink trendline failed to act as support.  As usual, it is possible to redraw the curved trendline, I drew it as grey.  However, important to note it has less points of contact with the price.  Now that the grey curve has broken there is no way to redraw curved trendline.  

Coming off the failure to hold our grey trendline, we have some serious price discovery as a guardian angel buyer saves us from entering a short term bear trend.  

In other words, the price recently looked like it was failing, but it didn't.  That is bullish.  

Despite that, it's really tempting to continue shorting with a 9.8k or 10.1k stop loss.  The risk/reward seems to be in the bear's favor even if the chance of success is not.  I would recommend it.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/9EAO9Tl9/  With a 2 hour RSI Bear Div confirmed 30 minutes ago this would be a place for bears to act.  My sense is a lot of bears have already shorted and their exhausted.  Most likely scenario, bear exhaustion eventually leads to a break in 9.8-10k level and bears will take a loss giving us a nice push up to next resistance level which is 11.5-11.6k.  But that is not a recommendation to long here- what are you going to risk your long off of?
So who's officially bullish again? Here's the evidence I have for the bull case: 

1. On Balance Volume hasn't been this high since more than a month ago, however it's trending up unlike the previous few months.

2. RSI is holding pretty steady around 50.

3. MACD on the 3 day has been showing a consistent rise over the signal line for the first time since the crash.

4. The BTC price looks like we've completed a market cycle and we're now ranging sideways until the next real rally.

5. "Good" news seems to be coming out daily again. Market sentiment seems to be getting bullish. My more casual crypto friends are starting to talk about their portfolios again.

Are we setting ourselves up for maximum pain? Find out on the next episode of Dragon Ball Z
Closed my unleveraged long from 9150 (a couple days ago) at 9314, 9388 and 9414. Nice little profit. Since exiting my position it's looking like the FOMO train might be leaving the station. I won't be getting on board as a matter of practice. My cold storage will enjoy the ride though. Good luck out there.

We are forming an almost perfectly symmetrical triangle with a median @9050, and even the 1h RSI is at perfect 50. Short-term this could be a good high-lev shorting opportunity from 9100 to 8950 or so. Medium-term this is a continuation pattern and the price will most likely burst out of it within the next 15-20h or so. 

But up or down? Is it a continuation of the more recent drop from 9700, or a continuation of the rise after the BGD? Smarter people here can probably answer that from TA perspective. 

Edit: ok scratch all that, random green spike once again to screw the TA.
LOL  WTF happened on Bitfinex
WHAT ON EARTH IS THAT?!!
This is fun.
9k bitcoins traded in 2 minutes

I've been wanting to short but the this thing doesn't look like its gonna fall.  Its recovered from the dip and holding.  If this keeps up its only a matter of time before it breaks through.  Might be a double top at 9.7k.  Its doing that thing where it keeps climbing up on really low volume.  If it actually does drop through the [support](https://i.imgur.com/wyra3hS.png) at 9k then its time to bail.
I was bored, so bought 1000 contracts on bitmex at 9330, sold at 9420. The legacy of the tuna sandwich guy lives on through me.
I've been thinking of 8k as the gravity point for price for at least a couple of months and I still see it that way until a new big story or wave of hype gives us further direction.

We hovered just above 6.5k for a while and now the same just under 9.5k, equidistant from 8k. Just pointing this out because I wouldn't be surprised if we chop in this range a few more times. 

I'm mostly in fiat with my stack because of this.  Main buys start just below 8k for me. Best of luck y'alls. 

This sub's quality is way up which is why I'm posting a lot less. Keep it up!
I was smug af this morning when I woke up an a load of staggered sells had hit, pretty much at the top. I reset them as buys lower down, a reasonable amount too and then a BGD comes along on a Saturday and makes me question my sanity.
Entered a short at 9130 before the pump to 9300. Was lamenting the fact that I set buy limits staggered to 8800 but no stop exits above. Then this madness hit. Someone just saved me about 20% on my stack when my limits hit.
Tonight I got stopped by a short squeeze at about 3:30CEST on Kraken, before the squeeze had <4% profit, got out with a 1,5% profit due to volatility. This wasn't new on kraken and, given all the other problems and limitation this platform has, I decided to GTFO and use it just as a GW until I get approval on GDAX. This morning I moved to Finex and shorted again, you know the rest of the story. I think karma owes me something now, a bit frustrated right now.
What the hell happened at 2 am? Did bitfinex bug out?
Dang the trailing stop I set last night to lock in profits on my 10x long (From 8980) barely got triggered at 9080 before the jump... really regretting not just setting it at BE after closing half
2500 btc buy wall at 9400 on finex

edit: gone now, saw it flash 2000 and then 1500, not sure if it got chewed or what

edit 2: 990 now... and gone. what the hell is going on
[Ascending triangle](https://imgur.com/RqLwWhP) or [ascending wedge](https://imgur.com/1pyS3g2)?

Both nearing tip, one says buy now, the other says sell now.  The wedge hasn't touched the top and gone back down ever since establishing the support line, so it doesn't seem as valid when I look at it.  Though if the wedge is valid, it is larger and higher priority than the triangle.

Not sure of my TA.

Edit: If the triangle breaks up and doesn't go far, it could draw a pretty convincing wedge.  Was considering opening a short but will hold off on shorting until then.  (already have a long open, which I decided to manually take one ladder of profit on here just in case this is a local top)

Edit 2:  June futs is currently on the fence for the last hour.  When spot goes up its on a premium, when spot goes down its on a discount.

Edit 3: Triangle broke up.  Resistance on the wedge is at 9600.  Next support-resistance lane on the multi-lane ascending channel is 9650.
Well, horizontals have been working very well lately, so this will either hold above 9400 or will try to reach 9700 before deciding what to do next.
Jumped in on this fuckery FOMO and **longed a scalp trade** with a trailing stop distance of 50usd will let it go til stopped out

I have a feeling that bulls are over-extending by emptying the lending pool, **would enter with caution**

EDIT: Should have mentioned this was ment as a gambling long. I see that the lending pool is beeing emptied and several indicators are bearish, like the daily macd, and what i think is a great lack of volume for a substantial rise. Also the fact that there has been several BGDs in the past when popping past resistance this was ment as a scalp, with **Target @ 9.7K, where i plan to go short**

**EDIT: Closed scalp early at 9560.**
Decision time again, trust my plan or my gut?
Miiiiiiiiiiiiike
WHAAAAAT THE F*****K JUST HAPPENED !!!???

Well i mean, just look at that 1min candle
If this were market buttsex, I feel we've spent sufficient energy toying $9,400's rim. The market is nice and loose; time for a vigorous push.
lending rates on bitfinex getting to 0.5% daily or about 50% of a ponzi scam interest rate
Having a little zoom out today and looking back at the last two times the weekly kumo was challenged in dowside movements (which is now due in a month's time, whilst we're below 11.7k).^^Apologies ^^in ^^advance ^^if ^^you ^^hate ^^'if ^^this ^^then ^^that' ^^statements. 

First case was autumn of 2013, where a strong intra-week move to the downside found wild kijun support and ended in a massive rally. Then in the spring of 2014, the attack on the kumo was relatively lower on the shoulder, and the short-term upside was once again strong but insufficient with the kijun this time providing resistance. 

1w ('12-'15): https://www.tradingview.com/x/3YR36qOM/

In both cases, there is a similar pattern in terms of the height of the lagging span attack on price. It doesn't have to exceed the ATH, but it does have to emerge on top.

---

Here's where we stand now. I still think it could go either way, and, of course, before we get there we'll know a lot more. The bearish scenario (*cf*. 2014) starts with a rally at an organic rate, a horizontal cross of the cloud and an upside wick of the kijun (which will be resistance not support) or – worse – the flat underside of the kumo. In the bullish outcome, we rally from here at an exponential rate and go parabolic off the shoulder (*cf*. 2013).

1w ('16-'18): https://www.tradingview.com/x/IFg1nTUl/

Bullish targets for the coming 2-3 months are therefore 10.7k and 12.5k based on the lagging span staying above the kijun. Bearish targets are 8k and 6k on the basis of the lagging span getting stuck under price.
Hi again, r/BitcoinMarkets! I'm still in need of some more responses for the quarterly reddit cryptocurrency survey! I'm planning at looking at how the community has changed since the cryptocurrency market has corrected sharply.

**If you would like to fill in the survey, you can do that [here.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfhkUsvWO4xAHnXQ1kjOl9tvmubEw_NquQNb3gwCMQN7LJLVA/viewform?usp=sf_link)**

Yeah, no... Didn't expect that.
Lol, nice chopping
guess someone have a fat finger
Day 4 of trading?  Day 3 of learning TA.

Been watching some Ichimoku cloud videos.  I'll be honest, the cloud changes rapidly based on which timeframe you're looking at so I don't know what to think.  However I'm going to use [this](https://www.tradingview.com/x/GDuTVbyt/) and attempt to make some trades.  This is a 4hr chart.  Green line is a line I've drawn from Jul 2017.  Grey line is line that is drawn from Apr 12ths BGD.

I believe price is above the cloud.  Tailing line is also above price.  This also aligns with some lines I had drawn previously.  Staging 2 limit longs with 5% @ 9300 and 5% @ 9275 with 2:1 leverage.   Both limits were hit while typing this up.

Long at 9300 and 9275, 2x leverage, stops set at 8808 which I believe to be support.

I'm a noob and a dumb dumb, I don't recommend following anything I say.
Despite all the volatility and whale games, nothing really changed on the daily chart. 

We still haven’t broken below the 38.2 support line at 8610 and also haven’t broken through resistance at 9500-9700 since the fall. 

It’s just been sideways chop these last 48hrs which doesn’t matter except for bots, scalpers, or those trading on lower time frames. 

The 1k+ 1 min candle on finex is pretty hilarious though
3D, which has been fairly reliable during this bear market, looks like pull back from resistance. The close was bearish. I'm very interested in how the weekly will close. https://imgur.com/a/nw8GJYV

12H nicely shows the increase in volatility that came with the breakout of the rising wedge. https://imgur.com/WdOoMD2

I believe this will consolidate and choose a direction. The 3D has me leaning bear biased, but this could easily consolidate in a bullish formation and then move up. It might be wise to just sit on the sidelines until the volatility simmers down. That said, I think taking a short from over 9.5k (exact entry you would have to decide in real time imo) on a high volatility pump not too bad, should be able to extricate yourself breakeven and go long if the consolidation turns bullish. A long target on a move up would be 10.2-10.3k (with more subsequent upside) and short target on a breakdown would be 8-8.1k. 
I was going to long if the 12hr closed above 9450 and as soon as the 12hr closed it got pumped 100 dollars as if to mock me. I'm sticking with my plan for now and staying out in fiat until 9800 breaks. I'm staying out because the 12hr MACD is still red and we've always had bigger drops after the 12hr MACD turns red. I'm looking for low 8's before I go long or a break above 9800.
One for the bears, despite this market action being very bullish.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/WqNOogn7/

Going to speculate this possible formation, which would fit a W4 profile since we are not fitting a larger W5 complete profile. Already scaled 50% into this position but hope to hit the 9600, since its a bit of a guess am only going 1.5x trading stack.

The top treadline is a extrapolation from a 1:1 ABC and the bottom is only based off two very close datapoints but it 'looks' good.

Entry 9600 Short 
SL 9770 
Target 8.9k~
R.R 4.3
literally untradeable
Always use stops, they said. You'll save a lot more money, they said.

I have the last laugh though because my $15 long position still going up with the whales.
I don't know guys, last big lightsaber candle was 10th of March 2017 on the 1D.
Few days after, BTC dumped. 
The only difference now is we don't know yet if it will be Darth Maul (red lightsaber) or Bastila Shan (green lightsaber)

EDIT (corrected my date)
Patiently waiting for the BGD to 9.7k. I hope, at least.
Shot through 420. Either a sign I should  smoke another joint, or buy more BTC.

USDT funding is empty on bitfinex. usually means rekt   
edit: only 4 mill for 6% a day now. 
First time posting, i don't trade bitcoin (atleast not yet) - thoughts on a potential double top at 9400 on the 1hour chart? Decline in the short term?
I'm going to be up all night staring at charts I think. 9.4 says "I'mma going to test 10k" to my inner perma bull
Do you guys think the /r/Buttcoin guys are just destined to be negative close minded chumps forever?  I have been arguing with them since 2014, Bitcoin is way overpriced at $200 they said, no value they said, governments will ban it they said.   It's always an excuse and yet Bitcoin just keeps moving a long doing it's thing.     Sounds arrogant but some people are meant to see the big picture and some are meant to be stuck in a negative loop where everything sucks and mean't to fail. 
Just saw a 470btc chunk sell, shits getting interesting on finex
There is also 2-3K in buy walls apearing now and then. I think the whales are preparing for big movements as the buy side of the orderbook is getting thinner sell side not changing and huge 1min volume.
Whats the deal with the 12K volume spike on Finex trading between 8750 - 9500?
Ahh, nothing like the sweet smell of panic on a Saturday morning.
Watching the crypto space at the moment keeps bringing back vivid memories of the web circa 1996-2000.

2013-2016 in crypto was like 1996-1998 on the web: tiny, fun, new, exciting, lots of interesting/weird people, under the mainstream radar, open to anyone that discovered it and few nefarious motives

2016-2017 in crypto was like 1998-2000 on the web: mainstream breakout, influx of new people, still fun, bigger entities from the "old world" start taking an interest yet lots of "frontier" opportunity remains for the small guys.

2017-onwards will be like 2000 onwards on the web: bigger players with more resources take over and begin taming the frontier, individual early adopters/enthusiasts pushed to the margins, centralization of market in to fewer and fewer hands, original utopian/egalitarian vision inevitably corrupted by commercial desires and the necessary introduction of regulations to protect the unwashed masses in this new medium/sphere.

tl;dr I am bearish for the little guy seeing _easy_ x100 returns out of crypto going forward. Moments in history like that are rare and I think 2018 marks the point in time where the game changes and crypto bends its knee (like everything eventually does) to the well connected, well resourced and powerful. The little guys will be left some scraps but nothing on the scale of what was possible during the "frontier" years.
I'm long from 9250. Reasoning: Stop buys executed and manual breakout traders bought in once the symmetrical triangle broke up. They were then met with a large sell that cascaded stop losses and liquidated new margin longs. The books have been cleared. More people are out of position than before because they were either forced out, or they jumped ship due to the uncertainty in the air. These are now sideliners who will buy back in if we push up. (Fuel) Now we're sitting right above the triangle's boundary line, just consolidating there. That's my narrative and I'm stickin' to it. We'll see what happens.
Maybe I'm late to the party , but - what on earth happened to all the usd funding liquidity on bitfinex? It was some time ago since last I checked, but I remember there was like $100M available for borrowing at ~0.01%/day. It was there for quite a while and I just gave up - "welp, I guess finex usd lending rates will be garbage (for lenders) for the foreseeable future" and I stopped looking.

Now I see it's all gone, rates are almost 0.2%/day and there's only $20M total in offers in the entire order book? I'm confused.
The fight for the kijun on the double 1D chart is intense! https://www.tradingview.com/x/B2pv8dbs/

I'm trying to build a bearish case here, to consider closing a long position that I have averaged into at 8.8k. But mostly failing on the bearish case.

- The market have seen some much needed cool off on RSI
- We've closed within the 1D cloud for 3 consecutive days now. This slowly building the case for edge-to-edge.
- 12H tenkan is providing solid support on candle close: https://www.tradingview.com/x/yIOWRpst/

The only bear case I can find is the 2014 play where ATH trend line broke but price continued falling. But in my opinion, people are looking at the wrong time scales for that case.

Here's my interpretation of the market cycles for 2014 and 2018 bear trend:

2014: https://www.tradingview.com/x/KjjNvW5T/

2018: https://www.tradingview.com/x/JyNcESyB/

All things considered, I have fiat set aside for another test of 8.6-8.7, since we're still in re-accumulation within that range. 12H tenkan provides support in that region as well.

Edit: Recalculated and corrected my average long entry.
This is beyond manipulation, intended to liquidate ALL margin positions. This is beyond f'ed up. I watched the price action live and it literally went from 8700 to 9500 to 8700 to 9200 now..
Guys, I know we are all expert money makers. With that being said put aside, I have just one question, how is it possible to clear an order book of all buy/sell orders?

**BitFinex's order book was wiped out of all buy and sell orders placed between $8,750 - $9,000 within one minute (2018-04-28 08:59:00 UTC)**. How^how?
u/mikexbt do you take into account people backseat trading for you in this thread and if so how has it worked out for you?
New BTC trading terms for 2018 (so far):

Bart(s)(ing)

Lightsaber candle(s)
As the current funding fees are on finex just putting a fundung offer for some usdt out there at 6-7% daily doesnt seem like a bad idea, that is a very good profit for literally no risk. And if it doesnt fulfill, then its ready for trading later when we decide where to go.

Although its very unlikely to actually get to offer, but you never know, cause this is crypto

Question for you guys. I'm in a situation where I can let my BTC earn 4% interest yearly (1 BTC to 1.04 BTC a year) or I can cash out and let my dollars earn anywhere from 9-20% interest a year. Which one would you choose?
That's a seriously fucked up dump on Bitfinex.
Just as i was trying to hit the short button...lag...BRD, bitmexxed :D
When I reentered last night I guess I was too tired to set profit taking limits, damn.  But at least I also forgot to set a stop loss!
Hi guys, looking for some advice I currently coding a simple bot to look after my BTC on the exchange (gdax due to free limit orders). I have coded up all required modules and have full access to the order book but other than a simple macd strategy I'm not sure what to look for. Anyone willing to share insights into a more viable strategy I could attempt to code? If anyone has any good reference material (books etc) they would also be great.

Cheers
Just so happened I was refreshing my price tracker as this happened, got a [screenie](https://imgur.com/gallery/6D6HSHf) but it's tame compared to the differences it showed across exchanges as I repeatedly refreshed. So glad I'm not in a position!


shorted yesterday 9280 and im still holding but im keeping a close eye on the situation. feels like someone is cleaning the books out before making a big move.

hopefully its my way but either way, i expect volatility this weekend so enjoy

EDIT: further supporting my bias https://nypost.com/2018/04/27/bitcoin-has-become-boring/

edit: these dont usually play out and i have no clue how valid it is but also keeping an eye on it https://www.tradingview.com/x/riE7Yoak/
someone opened a big short and closed it, https://tr.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSDSHORTS/ look 1d
Really strong resistance and important points around this zone when you zoom out:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/Id3RC9iv/
What are the key resistance levels upwards from here? 9.4, 9.8 & 10?

Or just one solid chunk of resistance from 9.4-10?!
Moved my asks up from above 9500 to above 9600, too much low timeframe consolidation around 9400 for this not to get a ~200-250 pop at least (imo). 
So, based on bart patterns on the 5min and many of our more recent significant dumps happening around this time of the day, and that we have tested 9400 a few times and dropped back slightly, plus the funding issue on finex, I'm short with 1/3 stack at 5X at 9352.

I'm going to add 1/3 as a limit short around 9397, and maybe another 1/3 higher up.

A. Bad move?
B. Where should I put my last 1/3 stack limit sell?

Thanks!

Edit:  Are down votes because I have a bad idea, if so tell me why, I'm trying to learn.  Or, are you long and don't like the idea because bias?
On the sidelines for now. Got orders stacked from 8300 - 8700. Plenty of support down there  and mid term goal of 12k is still on my radar.
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-buying-bitcoin-not-investing-110702015.html when not even the finance section of a popular(?) website can differentiate between trading/speculation/investing you wonder why they even have a finance sector. 

>“There’s two kinds of items that people buy and think they’re investing,” he says. “One really is investing and the other isn’t.” Bitcoin, he says, isn’t.

Ofc it's not investing, exactly like shorting EURUSD is not. But this doesn't mean there is a lot of money to be made. See George Soros or Bill Lipschutz

But to be fair, he says that later but it's just the Yahoo angle that annoys me 

>When you buy cryptocurrency, Buffett continues, “You aren’t investing when you do that. You’re speculating. There’s nothing wrong with it. If you wanna gamble somebody else will come along and pay more money tomorrow, that’s one kind of game. That is not investing.”


The volume on this 3 week pump has been pretty damn low. Is there a bullish explanation for it?
someone really wanted out
I recently thought about a certain strategy and i would love some opinions from you guys. The strategy implies that you own btc and can trade on leverage, bitmex etc. 

So what i thought about is you place some low leveraged long orders, starting under the recent local high (in this case 9.8k). You ladder them in the following style: 9.4k, 9.2k, 9k, 8.8k, 8.6k, 8.4k. If your first order (9.4k) hits, you do nothing expect for putting a sell order at your local high (9.8k). If the price rises again, you get a small gain and repeat. 

If the price keeps dropping after your 9.4k order hits and your 9.2k order hits, you set a limit sell at 9.3k for the number of contracts you bought at 9.2k. You however keep the contracts you bought at 9.4k. Your average entry will then be 9.3k. You place the limit buy at 9.2k again. If the price keeps falling and your order at 9.2k and 9k hit, you put a limit sell for the contracts you bought at 9k at 9.1k and again keep the rest. If the price keeps rising, all good, sell the contracts you bought at 9k at 9.1k and the contracts from 9.2k at 9.3k etc etc. 

I am not sure how to explain it any better, its basically an idea for an advanced DCA strategy where you lower your entry by scalping downwards. Of course, if we get into a huge flash crash, you are screwed.

The good thing however would be that you are absolutely resistent to FOMO since you are technically always long. For avoiding the funding, i would use the futures. I think it might especially worth if we consolidate in a certain range due to the constant scalping. 

Any feedback? Thanks guys!
If Mike is speaking truthfully on here, it's not sensible AT ALL to post that kind of positions out in the open for everyone to see. And that's me putting it mildly.
What good is TA when something like that happens almost every day?
Opened short CA 9357...

Wicked through resistance level 5+ times now on the hourly and have a bear divergence forming that could play out soon. 

Spoofy also got his bluff called and I think that has potential to add to sell pressure if we start dropping. 

100x so I will get kicked out quickly if things change on a dime. 

TP 9050
**Shorted this puppy on 9300** without stop atm. The fact that there is panic and that the daily macd is turning bearish and the fuckery earlier this morning doesnt inspire confidence in this move up. So lets see what happens

**EDIT:** Adding to more leverage and amount to my short

**EDIT2:** Watching this [wedge](https://www.tradingview.com/x/nXMWhnQ5) [INVALIDATED!]

**EDIT3:** Adding more to my short, and sticking to it
Well my short got stopped, another 2% down the drain.
Back to B/E.  

Waiting this out because i don't have a clue anymore
With this upwards breakout from our symmetric triangle on the 4h, do you expect another retest of 9.7 over the weekend, or even today?

The RSI looks much better now than during our previous attempt 4 days ago when it had already been overheated at where we are now.
Absolutely disgusting on Bitfinex. Either this was done by the exchange themselves or someone has access to their internal data where the stops are. Huge spike on XRP on bitfinex yesterday as well that wasn't on other exchanges. So if it wasn't the exchange themselves then they seem complicit with it.

Unless someone can give me reason not to I am going to withdraw my funds from them.
Hmm the strangest thing about this is we ended up at the same price as before the double ended lightsaber. And my bfx transaction history is messed up. Maybe it was some sort of a glitch? Strangest shit really. 
I'm guessing some long-term-hodling whale from 6 or more years ago who knows little about markets sold a fat pile in a far-less-than-optimal fashion.
Who has the balls to open up a margin position now? 
Without too many indicators and explanation here is my [TA](https://www.tradingview.com/x/T0ErrRZq) for opening a short on 9.7K ish

Could break local parabolic trend, rising wedge, could bounce off either 2017 channel or the previous ascending wedge resistance and more. TA is kindof messy, be warned.
He who is cynical or stands on the sidelines, will not own the future.
What happened this morning? Foul play? Smells something fishy. 
Tested 9400 too many times on mediocre volume, looks like we will see a jump to 9500 before the day is over.
Wow. I feel like an idiot now lending USDT at .18. Lending is at .35 now. This isn't looking good for the bulls. However, I can imagine the sell off because of the high rates only push us down to 9.1 or so, but that may be enough to kill confidence. We'll just have to wait and see.
WHAT
lmao anyone seeing this?
I'm really only watching gdax, stamp and finex and none of them seemed to have led that push. Was there a giant market buy on another exchange? And this just goes to show how illiquid this market is that a single person can market buy a huge amount and move the whole market 2.5%.

Don't have coins to sell and I'm trying to not short bitcoin anymore but I still think we'll move down from here.

Edit: And as I'm typing someone market sells a huge amount on gdax. People often will say manipulation but I don't think there is any manipulation. Whales are obviously real since they can do shit like what just happened but they don't have any more of an idea of where this will go then we do. 

Edit 2: LOL. Look at the 1 min candle on finex! That is one of the best candles I've seen in a long while, lol.
Market sold for the first time ever. Got TFO out of that.
I just don't know anymore... https://www.tradingview.com/x/hfGPub42/ draw all the lines!
Anyone has information about how big that initial market sell was? 
running out of cheap bfx money (0.009) in 10 days :(

FFR now 0.07+, and 30day-fixed going for over 0.11

Does this have any significance? Maybe trying to kerb the amount of longs?

Does it work the same on other exchanges?
Is it normal for the price to dip below your trailing stop (albeit by only a dollar) to not have your position closed by the exchange?

Obviously, not upset that it didn't get stopped out, just a little nervous for future stops...
[removed]
can someone ELI5 this funding deal on bfx and its potential effects? I'm seeing it mentioned. I understnad what short/long interest is, is this the same thing?
Red candles definitely standing out up here. 

If I had to guess MMs couldn't find the liquidity they wanted in that pennant thing but this fakeout formation seemed to do the trick. 

I think we are still in consolidation mode and this will head down again before long. First support I would look at is 9050.

Stamp and Dax lagging behind pretty significantly makes me feel like we won't be riding this to 10k. Can't help but think this is trader fomo and not so much new money fomo.
bart simpson is back?
Red candle at :58 while green candle on :59 indicate that someone is trying to paint the chart.
Just had a good search and can't find the formula. From what I understand ALMA is a average with more weight applied to more recent values. Is this right?
Hey guys, what are you favorite indicators to use when trading? I’m writing a algoTrading bot in C++ and I’m trying to figure out what indicators Should have what weights. :) 
I knew I'd come up, even if it took me several no' votes.
It's nice seeing GDAX participate in price discovery again instead of just bots following finex
Is anyone actually scared off by the bearish divergence on the 1 hour (and sort of on the 1 day chart)? 
Is it possible this was an attempt to prevent the market from breaking upwards out of the symmetric triangle by dumping on Bitfinex (leading spot market) to defend a much bigger short e.g. on CME or CBOE futures?
I have sold my positions now, expecting a minor correction. As someone mentioned on this sub, whales seem to be re-accumulating within this range so they probably will push the price down
https://www.tradingview.com/x/BlXKz10G/
Expecting a huge pump coming up on Monday. This is a typical weekend scenario we have at the moment. 
Can someone explain to me why Bitfinex lists 'USDT' as 'USD'? They are inherently not the same thing. It's incredibly deceitful and should be illegal.
Yeah they just took advantage of the liquidity and stops on BFX and unloaded bigtime. Time to GTFO
[2014 comparision chart](https://i.imgur.com/n7NwlZx.png)

Price action is looking pretty weird today.  It looks like we're consolidating but I have no idea which way its going to break out.
good way to spook/liquidate everyone in the market out of a position. Calling this a shakeout before climbing further sometime soon.
the funding dearth on bfx is a great setup for a flash crash. So I am out until one of 3 things happen 

* a flash crash to reentry targets down to 7200

* above 10k with more funding fuel

* above 12k
ADA is breaking upwards - pre-signal for BTC?

Looks like the market is finally maturing and volatility is hitting new lows. Sooner or later we will hear about the first country to adopt Bitcoin as their national currency. 
Day nth of trading, Day nth of learning.

6 hours on and we are all still acting as if nothing happened, don't we expect some answers?

WTF IS GOING ON?!
Supply vs. (demand + heros trying to hold the price up)
[removed]
Been struggling with 9400 all day. I'm not a margin trader, but this seems like a no-brainer to short right now. And that's why it'll probably go up.

I'm still sitting 50/50 fiat/bitcoin until this thing breaks 9500 or drops below 9000.
[removed]
So, by my calculations, right now is a good time to come in?
In all seriousness: this is why the market needs regulation. Big players (possibly exchanges) just getting people rekt for $$ like this is absolutely criminal.
The sudden buys and growth in price (as we see it now on BitFinex) is by the computers. The selling afterwards is real.

EDIT: I am sure all others who trade on BitFinex knows exactly what I mean. There has been extreme manipulation to keep the price upwards. I sometimes wish to record the screen/trades as they happen so that you guys will understand. 
$8790 vs $9220? that's quite a difference. most exchanges follow the higher one thou
whats the point of 'investing' in this its just a trader's shark tank it's a 50/50

TA guys, appreciate your quick feedback on the below:

Do you we see any kind of hidden(or visible) bearish divergence on any chart?
[removed]
I don't think there is much to be learned here, just thought it was interesting how we've followed [this](https://www.tradingview.com/x/PIE5fYXH/) line I drew earlier in the week.  I think I drew that on Tuesday, the grey line. 
We should just call it "8-9k coin" instead of bitcoin at this point
Alternating dreams of 6k and 12k with each $20 price movement :)
https://i.imgur.com/nUPvuxA.png
ITS (just barely) OVER 9000
Sounds like the market considers $9000 to be the accurate price for the asset at this point in time
Yeah what the hell, we blew right through it the first time in november!
Well, I'm usually very suspicious and rational, but at this point I'm pretty excited. 10k is only a matter of time and I think we'll see 40k this year, there are many, many weeks left to achieve this. I'm on par with hodling in my trading but I start to wonder if it's really worth the stress.
that would be upwards buying pressure. unless you're implying the wall is his (also he's on bitmex, not finex)
This is the quality we desperately need but don't deserve. Cheers

That was a hell of a day. Thanks for bringing back the memories!
That was only a year ago?? Jesus. I suffer from Bitcoin market temporal displacement syndrome.
Wow, I never heard about that. Looks absolutely insane, with how the market is overleveraged today that would have liquidated so many positions.
is that...down to $500??

also I heard a rumor that "etf denied" being typed in chat caused a bot to initiate the selloff, lol. Sounds silly, but it's a fun lil urban legend. 
I think someone was trying to find where hard support was after this tweet:

https://twitter.com/ronniemoas/status/989879740042563586?s=21

The implied rumor is that there's 25 billion USD buying anything that approaches 8750.
Is there a way to see bitfinex charts without registering? Their charts aren't open like GDAX is it? 

Edit: Actually can't even see the charts after logging in unless I send them 10000$ worth of btc. 
I think the upper blue line on your multi lane channel could be shifted up a tiny bit.
One of the biggest mistakes I see from people entering this space with the intent of trading is a volitility in their trading that resembles the market. You don't have to trade multiple times a day. And you don't have to enter every position.

How's this, I have made less than 10 trades this year and my last one was opening up a long at 6.6 that I don't intend to close until we either break 9.8k or we go below 8.4k and I decide to open a short below log line resistance turned support.

Losing money as a beginner is the price you pay to learn how to make money. Best of luck. 
Maybe try longer term trades?

Or try just buying/selling instead?
Sorry for your loss (no, seriously!) - but this is why "HODL" isn't such a bad advice *for a lot of people*. People scold hodling around here, but it *is* a valid strategy, and for many people the most profitable one.
this market is simply a mechanism to transfer wealth from the impatient to the patient - something like that 
Relax and sit on your hands. Take a time off until this settles.
Its hard but its the best option now.
Was it just one loss? You might want to scale back the amount you trade and place tighter stops. Then a bad trade or two won't break you
[deleted]
Why not just DCA? It's slower but less emotional.  
My stop went too, take the loss and decide when you feel comfortable  enough to make another re-entry
Sounds like you are over trading, less is more my friend
Whatever you lost, I would suggest you re-buy and just hold for a few months until we're back over 20K.  It's easier to trade after the pressure's off, and you're playing with house money.  One thing is for sure: you will dearly miss that BTC if you don't get it back soon.
It's called a spinning top everywhere else, but hey, this is crypto, so why should we consider what other people call this stuff.
Let's see how it goes. After being on this forum for nearly a year, the bbands seem to be the most reliable indicator of a movement.

It could be a confirmation bias, as I usually miss the big moves when they happen, then come here to find out whats going on.

I really should look into how to read them so I can make a better quality post in the future 
How can we discern whether it will be bullish or bearish volatility?

Stop loss hunting. Pure manipulation. Plain and simple. You guys all act like this is the first time you've seen it.
More likely it was a bot isolated to bitfinex. Also I think someone knew that bot would do a large market buy and sold into it. Whale wars

This has to be entirely honor system, I guess. I could !openlong 5800, right? Just would provide a link to my original post where people would call me a fraud.
I think one should ask user (i.e. chewy) if it's cool to create a bot to track his movement. I would love to see such a thing but I think it teeters into invading one's privacy even if they make their position known in this sub since it may bring a lot of exposure to said user.
It's Mike dampening conviction!

stop hunting...not sure what else it could be. I have no idea why someone would market buy up to $9500 from $8750.

I genuinely wonder if someone has access to the internal order book for stops on bitfinex and they abuse it to their advantage
There are two visuals for the total volume on gdax.

First visual, is they gray bar on the bottom of the trading window, and the second is the "V:" number on top of the trading window, when you hover over any particular candle (you can adjust timeframes to view their volumes. Ex.: 5min, 15min, 1h, etc.)

If you are trading BTC, the volume will be shown in BTC  only, but you can also switch between currencies.

It does not distinguish between buy(green) and sell(red) volumes (you can view it in the order book), but rather shows the total amount of BTC that people threw at the market during that particular timeframe.

For me personally, volume (V) acts as an indicator, together with some technical analysis (TA). More volume "usually" equates to a more stable trade. 

Too much volume might be a pre-indicator of a pump and dump occurrence, when a small group of people artificially increase the price by intentionally throwing money at the market, waiting for more people to jump in, and then taking all the money out of the market (together with the profit from other people).

Too little volume, for me, means a build-up or an accumulation period - when not as many people trade, but rather watch the price to see which way the market will go. Periods of no volume are usually followed by periods of too much volume, until the volume stabilizes itself.

Unfortunately, there are no good or bad volumes, only high and low, and everyone interprets them in their own ways. People compare volumes from 2015 to 2018, from April of last year to April of this year, from last bull run to new bull run, and from 5 min ago to now. 

The human brain thrives off looking for patterns and making connections - that is why trading and gambling can be so addicting. The reality is that any pattern can be overthrown by some outer factor.

The most favorable scenario for a bull is a slow price increase with a steady volume increase, showing that the market is mature, but this is crypto - the market is relatively new, and we are faaar away from maturity, my friend.

Sorry for the lecture, but I hope it helps. I'm also on mobile, so apologies for spelling errors. Good luck, everyone!
they're just talking about the volume bars on the bottom.  high/low volume is relative to whats around it.

A high volume pump out of nowhere means it will keep going for a while and vice versa.  

When price is dropping you'll eventually see a weak dump with high volume.  this means the selling pressure is getting absorbed and its pretty close to the bottom.

On large time scales increasing volume over time means more buyers coming into the market and the run will continue.

Sorry for asking... do I interpret $3MM @ $8895 correctly that you have 3.000.000 USD short at an avarage rate of USD 8895 - meaning 337BTC short?
> Added $1MM to my $2MM short @ $8722. 

Yikes dude.. 

Just for curiosity’s sake - on a scale from 1 to 100, how confident and/or comfortable are you in this trade? 

I don’t know, the market looks pretty determined to me..$9400 isn’t giving yourself much MOE/wiggle room. But then again the time horizon on my end is pretty far out. 

Either way, this trade sounds terribly similar to one of mine one or two months back. Wait- or was it the time I blew myself up attempting to weld the (apparently) not-adequately-clean gas tank of my motorcycle with an acetylene torch?? I can’t remember. 

Results were pretty similar in both cases = I got sh’rekt.  
Interesting to see you’ve still got your position open Mike. I got stopped out of mine at 9350 yesterday at a hefty loss, but made some back shorting 9250 to 8950. A lesson learned for me is to use trailing stops to keep my trades tighter.

I will consider re-entering short if we break 8900,or long if we push above 9350.
Rekt.
Rekt.
Rekt.
 Why do you think there could be substantial down on the movement?
I would never post such a large positions, good luck
rip
Holding the wall with you sir 

I'd take a break from shorting, my friend. You've been consistently burned on these calls over the past few weeks--I imagine because of your prolific success since January. Every gravy train comes to an end, eventually, and it seems you're trading on nostalgia these days.

Thanks for the insight, regardless.
Why would you short at 8895, instead of ... 9750 which is daily 200 SMA and we were at 90 RSI?
How substantial? Sub 6k?
I feel bad for you. You're trying to trade rationally yet a certain something that cannot be mentioned in this thread is leading this charge. Really depressing to watch.
I think you should consider entering a short position much quicker while the markets like this. Shorting at 9700 was obvious, or it seemed to be for most here. 
What does the amount of the position matter?   You could be a billionaire and $3MM is nothing to you.  Someone with $100 position could be risking much more, in a practical sense.

I mean I guess it perhaps makes it seem more risky to those with average income and net worth, but it really isn't the case.
You mean "overbought", right?
chart?

Edit: i was asking because i didn't know what was meant with "upper bands", if it was an ichimoku thing or whatnot. Reading other comments i'm assuming  the BBands are meant by this?

Probably. Online casinos bait people back in with bonus deposit but bitmex has nothing to bait people back 
I would argue that their user base is only getting bigger based off this chart alone.... https://www.tradingview.com/x/5LihiAbw/
Use the futures if you want to go for a long time position. Use the swaps if you want to go for a short (they most of the time give you funding for shorting). Use limit orders to get into a position (they pay you for doing so). Absolutely no problems with the bitmex fees. 
Yeah I thought about it and it's clear why spot buying is so much more bullish than longs. 

There's a clear intent to close a long- spot buying does not have that imminent intention of selling hanging overhead.

If I buy on spot, it's to hold the coins or move to bitmex to trade or something.

If I long, I have 0 intentions of holding it indefinitely, unlike spot. 

Same with selling in reverse. Shorts intend on closing- selling on spot is a "I'm out of here"

Not always true, but in this big traders market lately it seems to be. 
What's all that indicators

Morale of the story: don't trade Bitcoin with leverage unless you like gambling.
Stops within 10% if a bad idea in my opinion, this is why I think long term it is impossible to be profitable trading lower time frames. Unless you are the causing the stop outs
no it was fucking insane- pump from $9100 to $9300 in about 3 minutes. dump to $8750 in 10 seconds. pump to $9500 10 seconds later. Price swung around and settled at $9200. has been crawling upwards ever since. 

If you look at shorts, it seems someone opened a 3k btc short and closed it about 10 seconds later
nop... it was that crazy
Spoofy strikes again!
Today's high of $9,437 has just been rejected. Looks like desperate measures to keep the price up.
I'm seeing these orders flicker in and out of existence still...

Anyone have an explanation for why someone ( or a bot ) would do that?
Oh. Easy. It's an ascending triangle. The reason I know is because I'm currently long. /s
All I can say is be careful. 

edit edit: go with your instincts mate. lol.
> Jumped in on this fuckery FOMO

Cool!

>would enter with caution

What?

Man, make up your mind :(
You get stopped on this volatility?  Not a high volume moment, wasn't really the time for fomo.
Why would you long now then?
I didn't expected you to FOMO. :(
Plan.
Always plan unless market conditions drastically change and shit is going haywire 
Always trust the plan.
Trusting your gut often ends with what just amounts to a pile of shit. So, you know, dont. Unless you find a reason to justify that feeling. Its a good exercise to do, how much trust you can place in yourself.
What's your plan?  9.8 top?
>Miiiiiiiiiiiiike

LOL no worries, my position is intact. 
He has a 7% SL, only closes if it goes above 9400. If you entered a position with him you must be able to endure the same conditions

Thanks, this sort of analysis is what brings me to /r/bitcoinmarkets
I wanna see us gape right up to 9700

>lending rates on bitfinex getting to 0.5% daily or about 50% of a ponzi scam interest rate

Quite a bit for sale under 0.2%, I think you're looking at spikes? 
Is that for USD or BTC?
So what happened over at bitfinex?  I keep seeing references and I dont have the context b/c I dont check in that often.
last trade is seeing 0.35% for 60k.. this is over 100% APR.. wow.. now i see why people are willing to risk giving them money for tether printing.   hell 100% APR i wanna lend.  covers a 50% default risk.

I'd say this is a pretty bullish indicator - people are gonna jump in to lend at these rates.  As long as there's not some liquidity issue stopping that $$ from getting into the lending book.





there's a large spread but the bid is 0.11% and ask 0.18%.. also a lot more demand than supply out there.  Longs are really maxxing out leverage to FOMO in haha.  Time to print more tethers.



Me neither, and I'm bullish, wtaf.

Edit, actually I don't believe it. Saturday, in Europe? BGD?
I tethered at 9100 expecting a drop lol, glad i managed to get back in at 9115
I find the ichimoku stuff pretty useless. Depending on your settings and timeframe, you can make the cloud appear just about anywhere you want. 

But then, I'm still in the red overall. So what do I know?


Right there with you. I'm done with trying to anticipate the chop. I'm waiting for a bull/bear break, then I'll watch the 1H chart until the RSI gets into the 70s or 20s before taking a position.
4hr has green TD5, if it is TD9 in 16 hours around 9700 it would seem good to be holding a short.

Though for your target, might need to look at a higher time frame?

Asking you since I have you tagged as using TD, and maybe it could strengthen your case or not.

why is your stop loss so low? I would expect resistance right at 9750, so I would put a stop loss above resistance, maybe 9820 or so.  
Zoom out, go long. Easy trade.
[deleted]
I closed my long position because volatility has me spooked. I'm really not sure how to interpret this.

It's either brilliant and true hype, or an epic Machiavellian bull trap. I'm not sure which. Either scenario has me in over my head... When I was already feeling like this was a bad place for a leveraged position.
yep
I'm actually gut scalping with 1x.

Go in when I feel comfortable and close when I feel endangered.

I think I'll become bullish again after 10k.
Angry whale with small genitals " I'm going to waste my money just to stop out other people to be a cunt" unless it was the exchange.
I don't religiously use stops. Still in the game after 6 years. No money spent.

Shit like this whale who intentionally sold to trigger losses is why you should be very careful with stops.
Hey, if you opened a $15 long at $300 in 2015, you would have $435 profit now \(minus funding expenses\).
Hm? It was March 10th and definitely caused by the ETF speculation and eventual denial back then.
If we go to 9.7K I think I would short some BTC, betting on a BIG RED DILDO to give bulls a reality check.
Yeah that makes sense .But a BRD to 8800 or even 8400 it's also on the table.

its 75%/25% for me, (if a GD happens) 
I would first smoke (but not just one), then buy. You might make the best deal of your life. Also add some Vodka to the process
Go smoke another one, by the time you are back it might be shooting downwards through 420. 
Way to scare off a follow through
Thi is crazy, for the first time in 4 months I have absolutely no idea what is going on. These price movements are mind fuck
I think so too
Long from $9299. Last trade today (made 3/4 in last hour scalping minimal percentages but hey it's fun).  

Close at $9750, think we'll go test $10k again but not before some people take some more profit before 5 figures. 


May come back later to the opposite but my position is so small my liquidation is under $8k.   Come hunt that stop you shitbags. 

Good trading all, my only real day off, I'm not spending it in front of a screen x 
oh shit lol finally that motherfucker gets his bluff called
Right there are the 2K sold. 
[deleted]
that's gotta hurt
but why would someone do that - just for the sake of of the 'gotcha'? Because it didn't move the price at all, so it's not like this guy can buy back in cheaper... yet
Meanwhile, $80M EUR available at 0.013%. Lol, what is going on.
Can you explain how usdt funding being empty is bearish? Just curious. Thanks.

EDIT 2:

Hmmm: https://imgur.com/a/mmLmHZ3
we're just ranging right now. could argue its a pretty bullish formation so far
I think the real question would be a double top at 9700. That's what I'm waiting to see play out. 
would have to go below $8800
if it doesn't go below the previous drop at 9.25k it means nothing.  if it drops back down to before the pump at 9.08k then its probably a good idea to try and short the top of the bounce and put a stop loss above it.
double+ top/bottom aren't working great on short time frame from what I've read; I'm no expert but I wouldn't count on a double top on 1h
I mean, lots of them are pretty smart and have good points. I've found that in general most of the people on /r/buttcoin have a more intricate understanding of bitcoin and blockchain tech than the majority of moonkids on /r/bitcoin. I'm pretty sure even Vitalik spends time reading /r/buttcoin. Not cause he's the ETH founder but because some of the euphoria in the cryptospace is kind of ridiculous

Of course they circlejerk a lot, but there are dozens of valid criticisms of bitcoin that have so far generally gone unanswered. I'd say most of them will remain negative about bitcoin until it's actually used for something in a meaningful way. 

It's not hard to be skeptical of bitcoin, really. If bitcoin didn't make anyone here any money over the past few years, I think it'd be fair to say there'd be a *lot* less people advocating for it. It's still basically a purely speculative asset and while awareness continues to grow, usage for anything other than moving it between exchanges hasn't really gone anywhere.

Hell, I remember in 2013/2014 seeing a tip bot that you could use and I thought it was awesome. Now it's gone. There's nothing like that anymore. Over the years I haven't really seen an increase in people actually using the coin except for waiting for it to moon. Which I guess is fine, there's a decent case for the digital gold thing but I personally would be hesitant to put any large sum of money in it as a long term investment when the space is still basically the wild west in terms of regulation and manipulation 
That's where you go to talk shit or get a reality check.  Ain't nothin' wrong with that.

(when I say reality check, I'm not implying they are right)
Their views are an antithesis to Bitcoin maximalism. Both parties are stuck in their own loops. If you are sympathetic to one party, you should understand the other.
I had a friend who's been shit talking bitcoin since its inception...  If only he bought some instead of making fun of it lol.  Dude would have been retired now.
it's obviously being pumped so some big guys can unload.  But the volume isn't coming back.


Clearing of all buy/sell orders placed within this range. The question is who ~~could have~~ have done it and why!?

Crypto for me is more like people scared to even send email or register on a bbs in 1991. At my job with several 100s of coders, maybe 20 know about crypto
[deleted]
way less than 10% (that is being generous) of world's population is/has invested in crypto. We are really early. 
It’s still almost entirely speculative at this point. 

Barely relevant real world uses. 

Crypto is still just a wish. 
I totally agree with you, but just like internet we are free to do "almost" what ever we want. It's just that the mass don't want to be free perhaps. They are confortable with their little life. For the rest of the world, for the free mind internet still is an amazing tool. I'm always kind of Shock that people dont realize that even if internet is used for bad things, its still the biggest human revolution of the last 100years. 

Crypto will be the same, if Bitcoin bend the knee which is very possible, (maybe by becoming the world reserve currency), we will all be rich, and if you dont agree with what it became feel free to go with monero, like you are free to not use facebook or youtube.

I totally agree with what you said about Mainstream, but it make me totally bullish.
There's still a small window of opportunity for the little guy, maybe a few weeks.
Except that the actual number of longs on finex has stayed exactly the same and the number of shorts by about 700. What you have is exactly that, a narrative. The numbers show that even more people are in a long position after that craziness and even less people in a short. 
Because more people were in fiat during the downtrend and have now bought back in? 
The timescales here are wildly different.  You're drawing these graphs as if what happened over 3 years in 2014 will happen over a few months in 2018.
What's re-accumulation? What about distribution? Isn't Wyckoff's theory a price **cycle**?
>This is beyond manipulation, intended to liquidate ALL margin positions.

We spiked within a 9% range, such a move only liquidated gamblers. 
manipulation → bey^o^n^d^.^.^.^.
stophunting i bet that's the last time mike posts his stop on here lol
was a deuche move whoever did that to him

remember that sudden hike from 7 to 7.7k? isn't this whole bullish trend a market manipulation? that's why I'm not buying back in...yet.
I wanted to close my short but didn't knew when to click it. :O
Easily. If there are 3000 BTC in limit buys between 9000 and 8750 and the price is 9000, I just make a 3000 market sell (thanks /u/thekraut). 

Done.

>u/mikexbt do you take into account people backseat trading for you in this thread and if so how has it worked out for you?

If enough volume followed my trades, I would obviously see higher gains. I don't see that happening as a result of my reddit posts, mostly noise here. 

Some people enjoy watching larger trades, likely for the same reason many of us watch high stakes poker on TV. I don't have a particular agenda here, not like I'll be selling access to my PewtiePie style YouTube where you get to watch me bounce up and down on my chair, staring at charts and posting on social media. Maybe. 
He's a whale. This is all noise to him.
Has that 1m lightsaber candle happened before? First time I've seen it.
AFAIK, funding at rates >0.75%/day has to be explicitly taken; it won't be automatically picked up if someone opens a long, even if it would be the cheapest remaining.

I may be wrong, but I thought I had read this somewhere.
Shorting and selling are the exact same thing, at least in the context you are talking about.  If you think the price is going lower, then of course you want to do both/either.

If you are saying, the market is too unpredictable, so don't have a position at all right now, that is different.
yeah but its going to go up because of short covering.. we're not seeing the volume for new buyers and a sustained run up.. some bull will take profits and it'll go back down
Both sound risky. I don't know of any fixed income assets giving rates like that, certainly not cash. Who would you be lending to? How credit worthy are they? Are they subject to regulation? I wouldn't make a decision or even an opinion on such scant info. 
>Question for you guys. I'm in a situation where I can let my BTC earn 4% interest yearly (1 BTC to 1.04 BTC a year) or I can cash out and let my dollars earn anywhere from 9-20% interest a year. Which one would you choose?

I advise cashing out most of your btc to take advantage of your fiat opportunity, use leverage to go long on btc with the remainder as you're worried about opportunity cost. 
BTC. Besides that you likely won't get 9-20% risk free - the BTC ALSO will likely grow in USD value. Would it not be idiotic to cash out 100k USD and get 20k - while the bitcoin rise to 250000 in value?
Where can you get 4&#37; in a safe way?

As for your situation, it depends on how badly you need them right now and if you can afford a loss if Bitcoin goes down. You could split half and half if you are doing it just for the interest and want to hedge some losses if BTC goes down. If you think, BTC will go up, obviously the 4&#37; option is way better. Because BTC will go up much more than 10&#37; if there's a serious bull run. 
Also there's places that will give you over 8&#37; a year for your BTC so 4&#37; seems a little low.
AND a pump. it hit $9500 dude what the fuck
Some suggestions:

Moving average crossovers on different periods

RSI oversold and overbought bounces identifying support and resistance levels.
What's your rationale for that pink line? Doesn't seem overly significant to me, the low 9Ks/upper 8Ks for sure seems to be a significant horizontal zone but I don't see much reason to put it up around 9.4k. Same with the black line, it seems like it only has two touch points (including 9.7k just a few days ago) 
Set hidden buy wall at 8750, and hidden sell wall at 9500.

Dump coins down to 8800.... 

All stop orders and liquidations sell into your 8750 wall... instant profit 

Buy btc over 9400.

All stop buys and liquidation’s buy into your wall at 9500...

Profit?
It'll take just one BGD at this point to initiate some major FOMO and test 10k again. Sideline money still salivating from the taste of that last run-up.
I would put the last third long when you add the next time. Then wait for it to come down to flip the long to short. 
I think that it's so freaking obvious to do that an squeeze it's inminent. 
Since when has buying a currency been considered investing. Like, yeah... my portfolio is 20% EUR and 30% GBP, the rest is diversified over currencies all over tge workd.

Just like Forex investing really isn’t investing, neither is buying BTC
Buffett doesn't understand the value proposition (better money controlled by its owners, not banks) so he doesn't see it as an investment. He's been wrong about Bitcoin for several years, and I really don't care what this dinosaur thinks of the meteor that's about to hit his smug little financial world.
Buffet wouldn't understand the investment thesis for bitcoin even if it was explained to him very patiently. Also sad to see that he lazily asserts that speculation is akin to pure gambling. Speculators have to be savvy to make money just like investors and they provide needed liquidity to the market.
There's been a bullish explanation for everything recently.
The volume is same as oct/nov/dec 2017, so I do not think that it is particular low last 3 weeks (looking at Bitfinex)
http://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/volume/6m?c=e&r=month&t=b
volume was the exact same on the bullrun from 200B MC to 500B MC, volume was only ever above 30B consistently was during the massive increase during mid-dec to early Jan. that's it. historically, current volume is massive and is literally 2.5x more than the "bottom" when the global MC was 230B or so a month ago. 

volume is also steadily increasing, we go up a few B or so per day. so not sure where you're getting your damn low metric from.
This type of strategy is much much better than the "Wait for it to break up to buy or wait for it to break down to sell" strategy which is most often advocated on this board.

The downside risk to this strategy is a deep price dive with no volatility on the way down which doesn't recover for an extended period of time.  For example with some sort of negative news.  You have accurately acknowledged that risk and to some extent any long biased strategy has exposure to that type of risk.  You can use really loose stops for that, or just try to stay on top of fundamental news.

If you believe, like me, that absent major fundamental news, Bitcoin price is very likely to be higher in the future, massaging a long entry like you are describing is about the only trading methodology that makes sense.

This strategy can also kill it on stop run wicks.  You may not even get the sell orders in before the price has ripped back up.... you simply sell and replace all the orders.  You hope they run the stops 10 times before repricing higher, and sometimes they do. 
this seems like a long way of saying 'DCA' or staggered buys or 'averaging down/up'
What's advanced about it? You're just DCAing and keeping an even exposure. And I'm not sure exactly what you stand to gain from it. If you are "technically" long why don't you just stay long? How would your position be any different than if you just bought in at 9.4k and HODL? Fees and slippage actually worsen your position.

Who would stop hunt one person on mex? They would have had to go through 10's of millions of dollars just to hit one person with a $3m position? That would be very, very risk imo.
well he was on bitmex which didn't spike like bitfinex did, so idk. I thought the same as you but someone else pointed out bitmex didn't even really get close to $9400
Even in the biggest markets of the world like bonds and FX, there is always a bigger fish. Or a swarm of medium fishes to eat you
I'd assume the SL (which was at 9.4 if I remember?) of his short was hit during that insane spike?
Just out of curiosity what is wrong about posting your position? Obviously there is the risk of peple trying to steal your funds, but apart from that what else is the problem?
why not?
Well, what if I told you....
Well you could also argue with TA here: We hit our ascending support line while the 1h RSI was 36, in rather low territory.

If you consider the drop of the past 4 days as a correction rather than a turn-around, then all that together makes for a good buy signal.
Good call catto, be patient and get the most out of it.
The only panic I see, is panic buying. 
> and the fuckery earlier this morning doesnt inspire confidence in this move up.

Some traders have dared to but they've been neutralized. I have similar thoughts however. I am in the same position as you but I opened it way too down the chart. Hoping to get some profits from it.
The wedge you are watching was invalidated with that first green candle before the chaos. 
Btw, a new larger wedge formed.
To be honest, this looks like a completely random spike and not sustainable at all. Gut tells me to short this, but I've decided to sit out instead to see what to make of it. 
We are upset because we have this preconceived notion that the market should exhibit fairness. The earlier on we accept that this is not a fair game, and that there are people playing cards with us that can see our hand at all times, the faster we can adapt our strategy to this market. 
>Unless someone can give me reason not to I am going to withdraw my funds from them.


Their trading engine is better than all others together and they have a lot of altcoins open for margin trading.

Won't try to dissuade you, Bitfinex has had a terrible reputation since even before their big hack and haircut. Some traders are just like battered wives / gambling addicts, rationalizing why they keep trading there after everything that's happened.
Rekt short spotted.
Absolutely no doubt about it. Staff will have access to the database with the order book stored. When there’s a need for a bit of liquidity, BANG! Trigger a shit load of stop losses either way and soak up the fees. If they continue this fuckery and drive the market away through frustration, there may be no fees left to soak up in the end.
You are 100% right, prepared to get downvoted though, somehow this sub enjoys blatant manipulation.
bart, marge, and now a darth maul saber formation! bitcoin truly is paving the way for new financial paradigms
Huge market selling that got bought up immediately, with tons of stops triggered on the way.
Someone found an old laptop
or one of the whales pumping this up from 6K
Very probably 
I think if you accept that the people who have been influencing the market recently are basing their moves on what the majority of people are doing, it would make sense to do the opposite. I for one would have been wrong in almost all of my calls recently, if I had played.

It’s fair to say that I and a lot of people have no idea what’s going on so going against common sense/ common indicators may very well be the best strategy. Who’s got the balls to go against gut feeling?
Someone with no problems of going without stops. 
Like a gambler. It's 50/50

I am in one for the last two days. :/
To support your short zone hypothesis, our multilane channel has a line coming up at *9.7, which has acted more as resistance than support so far.  https://imgur.com/BKD8iO1

But looks like your 2017 channel was drawn linear and you're in a log view?  What are the connecting points? 

I like the short entry (already got 1/3 of my short filled). I'm not sure about the parabolic support line or the wedge support line you have drawn though.
Plus its a rater strong horizontal. Definitively would short .
Fuck someone is pushing poorly grammared asian mysticism. Sell Sell Sell
last chance to sell bitcoin before it hits 2k?
"He who" is such a dumbass, guy is constantly screwing up.
Fine. Long 100x, 9170. 
Whales out on stop-loss hunting for longs and shorts
Maybe too many times, usually after a couple of times resistance/support breaks, but in this case, 9400~ holding firmly. Interesting price point, I think this can even define the short-medium term and movement of BTC


There's 9500 on perpetual and swaps on mex.

Volume still sucks.  Funding rate for longs is getting high on mex and bfx which spells trouble.

I feel like they need another print of tether /s

Out of positions.  While I still like 10\-12k in the summer I think we could see a retrace to \~8k first. 
Dude, you remember what I told you earlier right? It doesn't raise any suspicion in your head? 
As long as it doesn't break $10k to major media headlines/interest, which, based on the sudden surges of buy volume as of late, could occur at any moment.
Rates are going down... Does that suggest that this is normalising? 
are you the guy offering 500k at 0.33? 100APR?  lol.
will lend 500k to make 500k!  Damn if only i weren't a US citizen.


WHAT 
What price did you get? Lmao

that was an 8.5% swing in literally 2 minutes
9k coins in about 2 minutes. I think it was about 3k coins for the big sell, 3k for the big buy, then 3k more for the volatility after
Just looked through the order history on BFX and can't find anything much more than 20BTC so hard to say if it was a flash crash or what.
Minimum 2K as I had just zoomed out the order books to check how many coins it will take to sell to reach 8,700 (where I plan to close my short) right before it happened, and there were about roughly 2,000 coins.
I noticed this earlier. It's a relatively free market so it reflects where people want their money, in their own trades or in someone else's. It will certainly make people think twice before opening a margin long (well, maybe not **all**). BTC rate is now 0.015% by comparison.  
Is it possible for the stop to have moved since the wick? 
Do you have the stop set to trigger on mark, last or index?
Rule 1
On **Bitfinex** there is a thing called funding which is where you can lend your tether or crypto away to others while collecting fees (they pay you to borrow your money). The money you want to lend out is offered at a certain price and duration. But its not alone out there, and others like the exchange has a bunch of stuff the want to lend out. So when all is lent out, no one can borrow anymore, therfore one cannot open a margin / leveraged long. Then alot of buy pressure dissapears. Making it easier for bears to push the price down, also it might signal that the longs are over leveraged. The fall hight is substantial.

Even though I am in favor of $10,000 and beyond, I think it would require some more time for it to see the light of the day.
Very hard to see on mobile, could you give a little extra input? Thanks.

Well, none of this is new money fomo. Old money will be the one that restarts the bull run, new money will bring it to new heights.

But yes, GDAX looks significantly more bearish than finex. Already under $9400 with finex at $9470...

I've never used it or looked into it, but it appears that the purpose is to filter out the noise.

The formula, if you don't want to click the link, is:

// parameters
// Window = 9
// Sigma = 6
// Offset = 0.85
 
Price = Close
 
m = (Offset * (Window - 1))
s = Window/Sigma
 
WtdSum = 0
CumWt  = 0
 
for k = 0 to Window - 1 do
Wtd = Exp(-((k-m)*(k-m))/(2*s*s))
WtdSum = WtdSum + Wtd * Price[Window - 1 - k]
CumWt = CumWt + Wtd
next
 
ALAverage = WtdSum / CumWt
 
RETURN ALAverage

Should you maybe train your bot on historical market data so it can learn how to weight the indicators and which trading strategies to employ in different market regimes?
Can you expand on this?  How is GDAX participating?  Any theory why?
no. I would be scared if we dropped below 8800 for more than 24 hours (because that’s where my limit stop on my hedge hit)
you realize the price pumped to $9500 right after?
CME is closed today and im short and if i had a big stack i'd be defending it too.. i wanted to close but missed the bell.. so stuck short til sunday.  So big miiiiike keep pouring in those shorts until sunday 5pm CST.


Cme cboe are too small 
Could be anything. Could just as well be someone trying to break upwards. Could also be forcing buys at higher prices due to triggering long stops and removing sell side liquidity by liquidating shorts.
Not impossible. I've also noticed that big pumps or dumps on BFX will affect e.g. Bitstamp, while a big move on Bitstamp will have almost no impact on BFX. 
why would they re-accumulate if they were going to push the price down?
Please elaborate
I disagree, the darth maul saber formation is completely new. I'm excited to see what else the whales come up with. They could truly draw some fantastic stuff. Can't wait for when they figure out how to bend candles and give us a dooku saber
Because they don't trade tether pairs on bitifnex, they trade USD. The kind of USD you can send to your bank via a traditional bank wire.
So you think the balance you see on your online banking is usd instead of Wells Fargo Coin, Bank of America Coin, etc?

The only way to hold usd is to have cash in hand or a credit on FedWire afaik. The FDIC just insures the value of your deposit 
Because they are not separated on their platform, you can withdraw the displayed USD value as actual dollars if you want.
Oh oh oh dear. I smell lawsuit ;)
Why does everyone on here constantly compare this to 2014. That was 4 years ago in a rapidly developing space. Shit is different now. There was like 1 exchange and 1 blockchain back then...
so stupid, bears are so desperate to spread FUD by citing 2014 while the market chugs along and i make money.
I remember everybody buying in over 9200. Bears will just keep raising their “buy in” price.
And EOS hit new ATH earlier today.  That is bullish for crypto in general, including BTC.

Man, story to tell, I sold 10,000 of these 12 hours ago. When I decided to gtfo in to Tether.

I don't know why ADA breaking up would lead to btc moving? What's your thought process there?
Read up on M1 supply
I thought it was that guy's Niece 
At this point, anyone trading crypto is probably aware of the risks/rewards. Bitcoin could go to $20000 or it could go to $700 (assuming exchanges don't decide to do a rollback)
Sorry, what did I miss here? 
aka "I made a bad trade, who can i blame aside from myself?" 
Supply + Whales accumulating vs demand. 

Now explain why what i just said its different.

When it's going stubborn on a resistance all day and not going down it means it will break it. Sfyl.
That's called an ascending triangle, and it's not when you short.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/eWDk4LSa/
a run up to $9700 is still very possible. Even if it just double tops 
I'm not sure it's a no brainer. As was mentioned below, we're hugging the upper band on the daily and 4hr bbands are getting tighter. 3 dumps in the past 24 hours (the aberration on finex notwithstanding) have been absorbed with 9200/9250 being the floor. I think we'll see a pop shortly. Certainly the best entry for a short if we do go down, but I'm not so sure it's gonna go in that direction.
Seems she was writing this joke too... 
typical Chad
When the last several 4 hour candles are green its not a good time to buy.  You want to buy when they're red.
What are your calculations?
calculations out of your "cul"?
it gives some minimum standards, just like the stock markets. When bigger money pouring in, the potential cost to economy is at a higher stake. bitcoin is still relatively small comparing to the global stock market, so there's still some time to go.
The market lacks liquidity. 
Lmao. First of all, how can you tell which sells/buys are by humans and which ones are by bots? Share this amazing knowledge with us. Second, why is buying/selling by bots not "real"? Bots are programmed by humans who wish to buy/sell at certain points or when certain conditions are met.

Here's a screenshot of [what I'm currently hodling](https://imgur.com/a/4oAQw6E)
Interesting thing to note: hashrate top right corner - was just over 3 billion GH/s.  

Currently nearly 9 times that at 26 billion GH/s. 
Nah, 1069. The 500 is the volume y-scale.
take one look at that guy and tell me you'd trust him to watch your tater tots in the cafeteria while you take a leak let alone what some news about 25 billion.   I know they tell people not to judge people on looks but there's a reason we evolved the creepy vibe.



I think it is very clear that some entities out there are accumulating a lot of Bitcoin
Right... Not only they told him but also he announced it to the world because he wants to help. Let me guess, it makes some people more confident to buy, right? (To put it mildly...). And then the pareidolia begins... let's explain the market action with this. BTC may well go much higher, but these tweets are just an attempt to manipulate people. Good luck to all.
Thanks for the information, if it's true that's insane and incredibly bullish.
First, there's no mention of what number they are bidding at. Second, there's nothing I've seen other than two or three Twitter personalities making outlandish claims with zero evidence. Why are we assuming numbers, and why are we taking wild unsubstantiated rumors as fact? I know some people are long and *want to believe*, but still....

If this was about any other coin, we'd rightfully call it blatant shilling and baseless pumping. But because it's BTC, we take it as gospel and run with it....
Saying "I know someone who knows a bunch of people" seems pretty explicit to me. It's during a bull run losing steam that you might expect to hear rumours like this. BTW, where do you get 8750 from?
Brb, setting buys down there.  (even if it's just a rumor, if enough people do this....)

(j/k, I'll see about it if we get there, no more knife catching for now)

Anyone against holding is a fool.  
>People scold hodling around here, but it is a valid strategy, and for many people the most profitable one.

For the large majority, actually.
It has been a valid strategy and very profitable, but doesn't mean that will continue.  And it's actually the MOST RISKY strategy of all if you don't use a stop loss.
HODLer here from 2013.  I have said this before, but if I tried trading at anytime since 2013, I would have been REKT so many times.
This is very good advice. Its perfectly fine to hedge yourself from time to time and just sit in fiat while you wait to take a position you are comfortable with. Crypto will still be here in a week.

I think a lot of people burn themselves because they are constantly jumping from position to position. If you are not confident in the position you are in you should probably not be all in it but slightly hedged, and you should definetly not be leveraged. 

If you base your positions off certain TA criteria wait for that criteria to actually happen before you enter. 
I think reducing the size of trades is the best advice in this thread. 

Not sure about the tighter stops though, could just lock in losses, really depends on the situation. But reducing cost is great global advice.

Good bot.
Sure, and there are plenty of scenarios where that's a likely explanation (huge dump after continued downtrend, huge buy out of a multi-day consolidation pattern, etc.) but the timing of this has me scratching my head....
It's weird, I hear this all the time on here...does anybody actually know any bots that market buy or sell 1 BTC, let alone 3,000? There's plenty that'll do 0.0XXX buys and sells for arb, etc. but I don't know of anybody that has bots market buying or selling amounts that would move the market. Limit orders, sure (due to a lot of market making bots stacking up based on similar signals) but not market orders. Genuinely curious about this.
Open source the code.
Will add some controls ahead to check if the value is within the actual price. But since BTC can change so fast the allowed interval would have to be like 20% or so. 
Other control would be a ban list since i save the open date/time its easy to check this later.
The bot will only act if the user enters his trade in a special syntax. 
It will act on any user using such syntax so only uses the system the users that really want to.

I'd be a bit surprised if he closed it instead of adding to his position. 

He seems a bit entrenched in his mindset
Maybe to ensure their own limit sells get filled? We're flirting with the bottom of the distribution range.
Of course they do. It’ll all be stored on the databases that are accessible by staff. If the exchange needs a bit of liquidity, bang! Hammer some stop losses and pocket the fees.

Edit: Apologies for the repeat posts, my phone had a shit fit.
Great reply. Thanks. 
Thanks
I don't know about major central banks, but I believe a few countries have said they're doing this, Estonia, Ghana, and Costa Rica at least.

Anyway, it's a major lever of demand that hasn't even begun to be pulled. The OP is correct that the bullish case is very strong, at least on slightly longer time frames. I would not short this right now. Any gains made through shorting will be pure luck.
A solid majority of Square merchants said they would accept Bitcoin in a recent survey. If you think widespread merchant adoption isn't just around the corner, you're kidding yourself.
It's called buy the rumor sell the news numb nuts. These are points I'm anticipating is possible (even likely) which is why I'm holding for the long term. Bitcoin will scale w/ LN, 2nd layer, sidechains and other protocol upgrades and as the network expands and market evolves out of the speculation phase we'll see more adoption by merchants and users and more use beyond SoV. If you think that's far cry where's your proof?

I believe I've had two losing short trades this month. My last profitable short was one week ago... Are you thinking of another trader?

EOS is on a parabola, we all know how parabola end. Watch it break apart soon.

How is BCH "leading" the charge? It got pulverised in March/April and now it is recovering. What's the mystery here?
People don't become billionaires by treating $3MM as "nothing" regardless of your net worth.
It's not million and you should really not judge people posting insight and having actually a very good aura on this sub because of his good TA skills while you're just posting "hey I'm shorting" as nobody care.
‘Millions’ is chump change to nobody, and somebody prepared to put that amount on the line on a trade does not do so lightly.
Or... And here's a thought... 2MM = 200 ;) Seriously... If you have 2 million to throw around and you're still hanging on this thread, something is not right. Surely someone with that much weight to throw around would value time over money, and if posting trade quantities on a thread on Friday night is at the top of that priority list...
Yeah my bad
Yes. 

Ichimoku lines each have their own names 
ok now hear me out.. i remember the no limit holdem craze.. and i do remember online sites used to be rich as hell and easy to beat but the fish slowly gutted and fileted over time and it became a shark tank.  Are we entering the shark tank phase of bitcoin?

they're giving fee discoutns now.. and coinbase stopped reporting exact amoutns on users (just 10 mil+)

Typically not signs of growing businesses.  They used to brag daily about their new users now they obfuscate it.


That is what I asked a couple of days ago.

I am trading on Kraken, and it is not good to hold positions since rolling fees, so Futures are a better option? I registered on Bitmex and they are not requesting any authorization. Is it possible for non Americans to trade on Bitmex
The main reason I went there first was for the negative maker fees, not for the margin trading.
longs pushing the climb can lead to very "fun" market effects. As buyers can push the price a lot more, they also find themselves with a lot more of profits, when they take those prices, they also push the price down a lot more, so its basically the market doing the same it would have done but multiplying the volatily.
That is bullish for sure. Average people talking about crypto is not bearish.
Absolutely. More demand.
LOL, that's insane. Although, I should say, something very similar happened to me at the 17k DCB... (ominous music)

Today was a good day.
Sorry but this has nothing to do with gambling. Even in dog fights you have some kind of rules and can evaluate R/R.
>Morale of the story: don't trade Bitcoin with leverage unless you like gambling.

If a 8.5% move can liquidate you, you're already gambling. 
It was a market stop and volatility coupled with their slow engine did the rest. But after being rekt too many times by BGDs in these 15 days (and basically, only by sudden BGD) I am evaluating to move to higher time frames and ranges.

Haha, ya that is what I'm noticing.  It kind of felt like I was trying to find a cloud to fit my feeling, which I don't like.  Though I haven't found a lot of TA that is exempt from that so far...  Either way, we'll see how it works out.  I probably messed up with these entries.  Technically i shouldve waited for a cross over, but I went with it.  Idk.
I did look at the TD but since the daily is price flipping its telling me its going to be choppy. Also if it does play out as a triangle TD is not typically very helpful inside them.

Yea its meant to be above the high, sorry was watching charts while drawing charts and typing fast. Once we break the high I know I am wrong, no point letting it continue. Have corrected.
What does that mean? Or is this an inside joke.. 
lmao you really think its just a whale trying to liquidate shorts? right, thats why the entire market across the board is pumping. alts are shooting up like rockets which signals that buyers are willing to take much more risk. it signals buyers confidence. alts gaining market share rapidly is probably the easiest way to indicate a bull market. these price movements aren't even surprising. there is no conspiracy.

The price didn't collapse because who sold only sold enough to stick it to the wall. It was a deliberate move to sell without changing the price.

You can't just print more. It needs real money in the BFX account to back it up.
> I mean, lots of them are pretty smart and have good points. I've found that in general most of the people on /r/buttcoin have a more intricate understanding of bitcoin and blockchain tech than the majority of moonkids on /r/bitcoin. 

Granted I haven't checked in with that sub in years (/r/buttcoin), but all I can remember from a few years ago is "this is a ponzi scheme, this shitcoin is going to zero, you are a retard, faggot, loser, piece of shit." I never *once* saw reasoned or civil discussion on that sub.

>I'm pretty sure even Vitalik spends time reading /r/buttcoin. Not cause he's the ETH founder but because some of the euphoria in the cryptospace is kind of ridiculous

Well, dApps are seeing some use. 

And while it's market cap is pitiful (ranked 388), ever since Gridcoin was created the participation on boinc scientific projects skyrocketed : 

https://boincstats.com/en/stats/-1/team/detail/118094994/charts

And now im not sure if that is a good argument, because one of the top 10 coins in making a real world impact has a market cap of 20M ... 
I guess we move in different circles. Most of my non geek/tech friends know about crypto (and even hold some LTC, ETH, BTC via things like Reovlut).

In any case, that's sort of my point. The guys in your company are so behind that by the time they figure out what's going on the frontier has well and truly been tamed. They will simply end up providing liquidity for Goldman Sachs (who will probably be running the exchange behind the scenes that your colleagues use to buy BTC with their savings via the crypto app their retail bank offers).
This is actually pretty accurate, except I think more people know about it than 20% of the population. By the mid 90's a majority of people had heard of email, but there were few that knew how to use it and even less that actually used it on a regular basis. 
> way less than 10%

There's only like 20 million Bitcoin addresses with a balance. It's way, way, way less than 10% (even knowing 1 address doesn't equal 1 person).
You could be reinforcing his point.  In late 90's people mocked buying books, food, and clothes on the internet, as well as using it for the news source.

Companies that made websites in the mid-90s took a speculative risk, but for most it paid off and they expanded their business.
> Crypto is still just a ~~wish~~ desperate fantasy.

Improved that a bit for you.

And certainly there will be some uses for cryptocurrency in the future, just like today, but they will be extremely limited.   

It's just getting old for the past 5 years, hearing dreamers fantasize about widespread adoption of BTC for use in retail transactions.  The number of businesses accepting it has decreased over that time period, or at least most of the major corporations have stopped taking it.



Is it not the *total value* of long positions, and not the *number* of long positions? 
If I recall correctly, those huge offers were there already even when the btcusd price was higher than right now. Their disappearance can't be explained with a large increase in longs either (we've had more longs than now and those lending offers were still there).

Wykoff's first principle says that a market never behaves exactly the same way twice, but rather similar on different time scales and extensions.

go ahead and check the archive. it's all public. he knows it is, too. he even asked the other day if Bitmex had any way to delete his trollbox history. "just curious". he's 'TheBoot' btw.

ye be stophunting whales

True
Cheers pal, I have looked into RSI seems to catch most of the larger swings and pull backs but then something like this morning happens lol. What would you recommend on crossovers? I currently use 12 and 26 EMA on 5 mins as anything below that seems to end in a stairway to hell.
I am just pointing out that the price bounced from this zone 10 times since December, and it is a strong point. Breaking this upwards would be strong bullish signal and I think that 9750 was just a fakeout in bullish momentum. Bulls were not able to hold the price for a half a day when this point broke.

Edited: Black line is pointing to hidden daily bearish divergence, not any kind of resistance

Yeah it's just risk spreading, but it's also risk spreading to not have your wallet, keys(not the crypto ones) and mobile phone in the same pocket of your jacket :D
You'd be surprised. Take the Japanese yen for example. It's a haven currency. Same as the Swiss franc. I've seen many a portfolio with a good stack of currencies (Hell, even my pension fund does). It's also a classic hedge strategy. 
If you would actually watch the interview maybe you'd understand what Buffet means by the word "investment" and why bitcoin ain't it. But instead you're looking to feel smug while projecting the same sentiment onto him.
dinosaur?  the guy's a genius.  I dont care how old he is.
Wizard of omaha. And he doesn't seem to have lost much with age.  He may be wrong but you'd be fool to dismiss him like he's some relic.  I bet he understand the financial models around bitcoin better than 99% of us 'young tech-savvy investors'.



But in general an investment is INTO something, so I think I agree with his wording here.   Crypto is more like hedging/risk handling than "I want to buy Tesla because they will sell a lot of cars". 

Then of course both can give great gains, but for different reasons
Here is the investment(==holding longer time frames) case for crypto https://www.ft.com/content/fe71505c-474e-3204-803d-fb085794c82c

>The S&P 500’s lengthy bull run began in 2009 as the Federal Reserve fired up quantitative easing. Suppressing bond yields and financial market volatility via QE has certainly been a boon for equities.



>Now as the Fed looks to start reducing its $4.5tn balance sheet this year and the European Central Bank discusses tapering bond purchases in 2018, equities will soon need to reflect a reduction in the so-called punchbowl.


Thanks for taking your time. Yeah, you are absolutely right about the bad news drop without green spikes to the "middle sell points". That would be the worst scenario. But i think that especially in these times of stop hunting, it could make a small fortune. Another problem is of course the bitmex engine during these times, literally not usable.
Not just one person though, they'll hunt lots of leveraged shorts (and longs) this way. It's risky, but if it works it's easy money.
Well then he lucked out. My point still stands. People with lots of money often think they can afford making stupid mistakes. Until they run out of money that is.
Not on mex so he would be fine still.
He had set the SL at 7%, which for sure was hit in this spike (9,300 - 9,400).
Play poker at all? You don't show your cards to the other players, no matter how cordial the atmosphere.
Exactly that, becoming a target. Being doxed, blackmailed, threatened, harassed, whatever. Pointless headache. You can get all the credibility of making good calls without sharing your personal volume of trading.
Because a whale could just take your $3 million just like that?
Read up on stop loss hunting.
It seems to be viable on the 1 day or 3 day but this kind of shit makes it pretty much void on lower time scales.
100x is a good call?
That hasn't started yet, but yes, that's where we're going.
Iknow, holding the short
No one expects markets to be fair.  But they hope exchanges will be. In a regulated market shit like this would be investigated. I'm not calling for regulation but I will use exchanges that have proven to be more trustworthy. 
Well said!
Good points but I'm too scared to use stops on Bitfinex because of candles like these. A couple of months a go I got caught out by that $1000 candle crash. I had a stop that triggered $500 lower than where I placed it because of ridiculously low liquidity. Would have happened to lots today. Whats the point in having margin trading on all these alt coins if I can't trust that any stops will be filled at a decent price and I know from past experience shit like this WILL happen.
For this too happen organically then the liquidity would need to be ridiculously low. But wait the volume was massive.  So it was an organised attack  would you have the balls to do such an attack without knowing the exact order book?
Not a competent one, as it was a bullshit, wasteful trade.  Maybe they fat-fingered.
We discussed it yesterday if you remember, I am still hanging. lol.
Underwater?
Ponits are 890 and 1850 ish, but the line drawn was actually the 6k dip bottom (5980 ish) and 890 ish trend line.
You're about to be rolling in tuna.
this market's all sharks.  It's gonna be a bitch to make any $$.
I miss last year.

Whales, could you elaborate please if you will?
That there are whales and market manipulation by exchanges? I take that as a given.

If you're small fish then it should not affect you as much.

 There is still a very real market for this regardless so there's opposing forces.
>are you the guy offering 500k at 0.33? 100APR?  lol.
>will lend 500k to make 500k!  Damn if only i weren't a US citizen.

Lendee isn't locked into the duration. Would cancel as soon as a more attractive offer shows up. 
finex chart.. random spikes
Insane. Was quite comfortable just hodling with the price movements the last days. This kind of obvious manipulation makes me hedge short w/o stop here.
Highest trailing stop point was 9393.4 after the wick, then market price dropped to 9392.0, bypassing the trailing stop order at 9393.4.

Does it have something to do with needing to cover the trading fee?
Whatever the default is on bitfinex :p

UPDATE: Position was closed out by the exchange at 9372.4 - exactly the 0.2% trading fee from the original 9393.4 order
I'm not a margin guy so correct me if i'm wrong, but I fail to understand why lending drying up is a bearish indicator. If there's no money to borrow that means that both leveraged longs AND shorts are not feasible at this time. All that should do is make the market less spiky as there's less ability to swing the market with huge buys and sells.

At face value it seems like a fairly neutral situation.
Time to change my flair to bearish
lol you really think Bitfinex is going to let that happen? They're just going to print more tether. 
Maybe because the way you worded it is a rather confusing/unclear way.
Yeah, I don't know.  Here's an upvote.
Basically, ascending triangle with very big candles up and down, a candle with very long wicks in both directions and breakout followed by an immediate test of the resistance turned support. 
Even 12.6 is a massive hurdle. Let's break 10k first yeah?
My gut tells me we're gonna need new money just to get to 12k in the first place, which is also the reason i'm still leaning bearish short/medium term.
Totally anecdotal but I'm going by my father's ca of 10000 for when the previous new money is confident to do toilet-buys with coinbase app again.

And on the way up the second 11.7 double top, when we hit about 10k happened to be when my father-in-law asked me to get some bitcoin for him. (which btw I told him to wait, and did a dca for him spanning 11~8k)
typically a rally starts with lots of short covering.. I'd say thats what we got + old longs getting desperate to leverage existing $$.

I'm stuck short because of the lame CME trading hours.. but I'm not comfortable with that.  bitfinex lending book is drying up this might give me the dip i need to escape on sunday


I had the idea of backTesting it with some form of neural net to figure out the weights for each indicators itself, seems kind of daunting though

They are selling when bitfinex is not. Generally since January (3 days after BCH introduction) GDAX mirrors bitfinex within about 0.1% at any given point in time, with most moves following bitfinex delayed by about 5-10 seconds, which mainly seems to be bots.

People selling on GDAX while bitfinex is pushing is indicative of it coming back to participate in price discovery again. It would just be nice to see GDAX making moves, either up or down again. 

It's a sad shell of what it used to be in Nov/Dec
> How is GDAX participating?

They're leading the price it seems.

> Any theory why?

People buying bitcoin/selling on the toilet with their phone app.  (actually probably not there yet, I'm mostly joking)
Well, in fact the price oscillated like crazy, I looked at it while it happened. it was not simply a dump followed by a pump.

I imagine the initial dump hit a lot of stacked buy orders, driving the price in turn to these crazy heights, triggering in turn some stacked sell orders, etc.

I have no explanation, just genuinely curious, as this has been a really unusual event. What's your take on it?
Could be someone discouraging all of these BGDs by sending a message 
you read OP's comment wrong. OP thinks the whales are gonna push the price down and then re\-accumulate 
you can't push the price down unless you have a lot of coins. unlike fiat, which you can bring in from wherever.

I don't particularly buy his theory- but a few times I've seen accumulation at the top of a range and afterwards someone will dump very hard on the market
I got rekt :(
Typical weekend scenario: 

Saturday, Sunday, and ending by Monday.
>I disagree, the darth maul saber formation is completely new. I'm excited to see what else the whales come up with. They could truly draw some fantastic stuff. Can't wait for when they figure out how to bend candles and give us a dooku saber

Bat'leth formation incoming. 
No, its digital USD on a screen with massive regulations in place to ensure that.
So when you sell BTC on BFX, what is the individual receiving, USD or USDT?

Edit: for clarifying, I mean is the user receiving an IOU of USD, or USDT?
It is funny to me as well.  It's the most bearish scenario which ever happened in Bitcoin (longest bear market every).  And I have to think if anyone could actually go back to 2014, the smartest and easiest thing would be to go back and buy Bitcoin.  Sure you would have to hold it a few years, but the returns are still huge.  

So if this plays out like 2014, one should be building a huge long position to hold for a few years.  If it plays out like any other correction in the history of Bitcoin, one should be building a huge long position to hold for a few weeks or months.
This feels like Groundhog Day.
Markets are markets. Gold used to be pan-handled. Only thing that changes is the price and the volume.
This time its different ™
You've been making money off holding in the past 4 months? lmao 
I know, it's impossible to time. I'm trying to buy/sell smaller chunks over time, but I'm often too impatient.

Edit, just saw your question:

Nothing specific about ADA. I have only started watching some other coins and it seems to me they often anticipate a move in BTC, especially if the same motion can be seen in a number of coins.
FOMO is like a virus, it spreads infecting other traders
haha chad aside. No seriously, I expect a statement from Bitfinex.
> Bitcoin could go to $20000 or it could go to $700

This is the underline. Exchanges decide.
The order book of BitFinex was cleared of all buy/sell orders in ($8,750 - $9,500) within two minutes
Actually, it just improved my short entry, but thanks for the drive-by sass!
If I was accumulating, why would I buy at each point of near-breakdown? I would wait for the price to fall and buy then.

EDIT: Prime accumulation strategy -- buy 2000 coins in 1 minute and produce $750 worth of slippage
Thank you. People getting banned for idiotic posts but this idiot still posting
He's clearly being sarcastic. 
Starting to think 10k is inevitable at least for a test. What's your outlook sloppy?
Yeah this Humor is kinda sad
What happened here?
What happened here?
What happened here?
Are you trading on BitFinex?
never saw a chart go straight up.. or down.. so how can being perma anything ever be right?

Interesting. Can we have some charts to back it up? Fellow traders can you help my boy CatPizzas32 please, some lines here, some lines there.. Please!

Meh, mostly for points of reference for myself. Trend lines.  We've been on a linear trend mostly since the short squeeze happened on that date. 
As the price nears new local highs, people believe a bull run will occur. It makes sense, but in terms of financial and emotional risk/reward, it doesn't seem prudent.

For me, it's the opposite- as the price near new local highs, it's smarter imo to become more bearish. 

I did this on the way up to $11.7k the first time and it was very profitable.

I believe it's best to become more bearish until an entirely new high has been established ($12-13k).. Before that, it's just asking to get disappointed.

This should be the same for local lows. As we approached $6k people should have really gotten more bullish and kept "buying the dip", expecting a large run up.

I guess as time goes on people expect these resistances and support to be broken and it'll be smarter to be bullish as we approach $12k and bearish as we approach $6k.

For me, due to fundamentals right now, I don't believe another bull run is imminent, so I remain increasingly  bearish until we blow through $12k. 
if enough people want to see 40k, we will see 40k. 
I don't understand this sub, bulls upvoting bullish nonsense and downvoting objective and good TAs. If bear wrote that we will visit 5k this year without any explanation it would be downvoted to oblivion.
theres no fundamentals for anything in this market, its all a fucking crapshoot. no one knows whats going to happen.
I don't fucking care, I trade you idiot. Everything points to it and you're just too close-minded to see it.
Quiznos had the original Tuna Sanwhich, Subtard. Quit shilling and gtfo scrub

It's not clear at all; I've seen nothing apart from two or three Twitter personalities claiming outlandish levels of OTC demand, with literally nothing of substance to objectively back it up.

Here, let me try:

I have it on good authority that Warren Buffett and Bill Gates are going to divest all their assets and go all in on Bitcoin next week. Buy in now!

it's just total smoke.. the guy's full of shit.  he said she said.

The market sell this morning came after the tweet. Someone called bullshit on the tweet just like you, but they put their money where there mouth was.
The bottom of that freak wick
Thanks!
Ah yes, I feel that fits better.

Here's what I'm currently looking at https://imgur.com/nsjKrAL
I lost a lot when I started trading and I've been trying to make it back quickly as opposed to accepting that it'll take me a long time and I'll have to grind. I was really lucky on Thursday, made back 15% of my losses in a singe trade only to lose half of it yesterday. I know I'm trading too often/with too much on the line/too much leverage and that huge red candle incident shows me I probably would've gotten caught anyway, so I need to have lower liquidation prices as well. It's just too easy to get destroyed in this market.
Exactly same, plus fib retracements
you dont need a bot to market buy 3000 BTC.  you type in 3000 click and click market buy.  you need bots to TWAP etc.


5% would probably be safe, but that's a good call. I'd honestly want like 3% personally. Lots of people wait for a 2% break and then say "long 9060 a couple hours ago based on mah TA"
Ok cool!
!short XBTUSD 8900 5x 0.33 -sl 9000
I would agree with him that it's due for a pullback, but I don't think this market cares right now.

edit: idk where his liquidation is but he's won these trades by holding out before. I'd consider holding even if we test 10k. Don't think we've got the juice for it and if that's the case the pullback will likely be steeper than the last.
Number one mistake for me and when I take the biggest losses is when I get married to a trade and stubbornly can't let go at a small loss. Or even worse, I add to it. I hope he closed.
You said that you wouldn’t be surprised upon seeing 10k this weekend. If it breaks 9400 with conviction and hits 10k, would you expect all time highs?
Yea, I think it's very possible. 
> I believe a few countries have said they're doing this, Estonia, Ghana, and Costa Rica at least.

Source or gtfo.
Numb nuts? Swallow my entire nutsack buddy. 
Respect @MikeXBT
We're at 9150, so it's impossible to have been leveraged 100x since 8895, liquidation would have already happened. Difference between understanding margin trading and not understanding.
You’re rght, but trying to trade less chop and less frequently, and more around support and resistence lines when they are breached/rejected. Trying to avoid chop as much as possible!
technicals don't lie. 200 sma on the daily is very strong resistance, almost never breaks on the first try. bitcoin was also way overbought on the RSI on all high time frames. if you never take profit you never earn the profit, that is why it dropped 1k USD in 2 days. fundamentally bitcoin has not changed why would its price be worthy of a much steeper move up without any sort of pullback?

No its not that one.
i sold all my BCH the day it hit GDAX.. best trade I made in my life.  I love you roger ver.   If andreas popadopolous and roger ver combined forces bitcoin would hit 100k this year.




i think no one talks about bch :))
Try to stay focused and on topic, if you are capable of doing so.
>  Seriously... If you have 2 million to throw around and you're still hanging on this thread, something is not right. Surely someone with that much weight to throw around would value time over money, and if posting trade quantities on a thread on Friday night is at the top of that priority list...

Saturday afternoon here, on vacation. Takes a few seconds to post a trade, certainly not at the top of my list. Appreciate the advice all the same. 
>Surely someone with that much weight to throw around would value time over money

If I was a millionaire I'd still play on my phone while waiting for the chefs to cook my gourmet noms
I have high 4 figs of BTC + other assets and still read this thread. Yes, it was irrelevant to post how much he is gambling. Even US president is playing with twitter. Are millionaires supposed not to talk with plebs on Reddit? We should form secret whale groups and rule the world or something like that. I think something is not right with you.
I said a few months ago i didn't think the gambling aspect was particularly good for the space, although a lot of people disagreed and said that was always a part of it all. 

I think it'll be good for price discovery- not for upwards movement. Now that people actually bet on bitcoin going down there's more actual price discovery occurring

Over time this dead dog will die tho smh 
Ah the days people would shove any pocket pair preflop all in and you're holding the the aces.

I made such sick returns during that poker craze. Funded me extremely well while i was about to enter the adult life
>they're giving fee discoutns now.. 

Maker rebates are not a new development at Bitmex. 
Yes, and in fact americans can only use it with VPN. If you want to let your positions roll, do it on the futures. I think they even removed the settlement fee, although i am not 100% sure about that.
Yeah, which would explain the ridiculous volatility we see lately
Cheers , I feel old.
fucking brilliant man, that's awesome. Grats
Hey man I trade as well (not with leverage but still), but saying it has *nothing* to do with gambling is deluding yourself, come on.
Didn't you have a stop loss of 7% earlier today?
Yeah after seeing that I feel like it is a blatant attempt at manipulation- there is no good reason someone would market buy from $8750 to $9500

It's not hard to think someone has access to internal data for stops and liquidations 
It could also be a bigger institution checking for liquidity / testing algorithms. Now that we have some of the bigger boys coming in to play, they do things like this to improve their trading data.

Though with finex’s sketchy history - malfeasance is also very possible

Thanks!
You don’t see that ridiculous candle on the Bitfinex chart?
...did you see what happened last night?
That 1m candle stopped out both longs and shorts, not sure what else you're talking about.
Others feel free to correct me where I'm incorrect, but this is my understanding...

Traders are borrowing USD[T] on Finex to go margin-long everything. Also of note, top trading pairs on:

* BTC: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/#markets
* ETH: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/#markets
* BCH: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-cash/#markets
* EOS: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/eos/#markets

Are all Tether-denominated. There's little to no USD[T] left to borrow in the pool (hence the high daily rate).

Thus, one might *assume* longs are over-leveraged. Unless there's organic buying demand, traders would have to borrow at a pretty steep rate to continue pumping.
Every dollar available for loan is loaned out on leverage long positions. It means no one can take new long positions without paying high rates. 
There's lots of really shitty discourse on there and tether conspiracy theories but there are some valid criticisms there as well. It's just the normal stuff, nothing you and I haven't argued over, they just present the arguments better than I do generally

Vitalik mentioned /r/buttcoin in a tweet once. I think he said "I think I saw on /r/buttcoin that lightning network is starting to seem like an ICO for bitcoin" or something, it was like #13 jn a series of 20 tweets 
they keep pitching his narrative that institutions are 'just getting in now'.. whats more likely the 100 hour a week coked up finance and MBAs from wharton at the institutional desks are just learning about bitcoin or they bought last year and havent been able to unload this dead dog because joe retail went bankrupt too quick.. and now they're not coming back.

Because the movements since we broke the downtrend are people loading up, not unloading.  
To me it clearly looks like the exchange, BitFinex. Otherwise, please give me plausible scenarios as of why someone other than the exchange would do something like this.

I was just going by recent survey in US and Japan. I think US was around 7-8% and Japan in low teens.
Good points 👍🏼
> And certainly there will be some uses for cryptocurrency in the future, just like today, but they will be extremely limited.

Naivete

>It's just getting old for the past 5 years, hearing dreamers fantasize about widespread adoption of BTC for use in retail transactions. The number of businesses accepting it has decreased over that time period, or at least most of the major corporations have stopped taking it.

That was never the point. Getting excited about retail adoption was exciting because it meant more exposure. People who think deeply about the role of Bitcoin in the future are not elated by merchant adoption but rather tech and infrastructure. The ones who are most excited about this project are not excited with the prospect of buying nick-knacks with Bitcoin, but rather the implications of decentralized hard money on the global economy and state.

This is so much bigger than you're making it out to be. I encourage everyone who's obsessed with the idea of buying consumer goods with Bitcoin on their phone to trade up for BCH, XRP, IOTA or the like. Means of exchange is but a piece of the puzzle for what Bitcoin is trying to be and obsession over this small facet of use is short sighted and misaligned with what this emergent technology is on the path to becoming. 
Makes me think back of the early 90s, when everybody was buying a PC that only functioned as a glorified typewriter. Entirely speculative, no real world use. But watch out, just as the internet turned all those PCs into gold, there may just as well be an application around the corner that will do the same for crypto. 

Edit: And do note, crypto is not just BTC.
That’s just *bitcoin* though, and the idea that it will “replace” the dollar. I don’t see that ever happening. Instead, specific industries will use specific coins (ENJ, IOTA, VET etc). ETH smart contracts are brilliant for efficiency. 
It is, but considering you can't tell the number of longs \(only total value\) that he is talking about total value just wording it incorrectly. Currently there are 29422 BTC worth of longs and 20388 BTC worth of shorts.
Its taking a 3 year chart and squish it into 5.5 months.  Come on.  Maybe in 2022 the entire 2014 bear market will play out in a day.  Wykoff's first principle says it could happen.
6x faster?  nah.
So where do you see distribution beginning? 
Look at the orderbook on bitfinex. At any point, there are a large number of limit orders on the books waiting to execute if the price reaches that point. The depth chart visually displays all those orders as a growing pile. If you had a 10 BTC limit order every $1 between 9000 and 8750, you'd have 2500 (250 * 10) BTC on the books between 9000 and 8750. 

Now I can come in and make a 2500 BTC limit sell at 9000, but I'm only going to get 10 of my 2500 filled. If I want to sell *all* my BTC right now, I do a market sell. That buys up every available BTC at the best available price until my order is filled. In this case, it wiped down to 8750 where there were more limit orders on the books than coins remaining in the market order.

No he's not. Unless you can change names or he has a different account or something. 

He just showed me his position size last night, he /position'd in trollbox, asking for Sloppy in chat. 

He was hedging all his coins on June futures and shorting on XBTUSD for the $3MM position- which had an entry at the exact price he said on his account here ($8890 or something). 

I asked him if I could post the archives here but he said he'd rather not link usernames from here to there so easily, which makes sense, honestly.

But anyone here who trusts me should know that he did show me his position worth $3m in the chat last night and it was at the exact entry he said on reddit.

I think you're confusing me with someone else. I've never been close to being wiped out trading crypto. 

>go ahead and check the archive. it's all public. he knows it is, too. he even asked the other day if Bitmex had any way to delete his trollbox history. "just curious". he's 'TheBoot' btw.

 I'm not TheBoot. 
That was on the 1d.

> So there is a lot more risk, a lot more pressure, and each spike makes you panic

Speak for yourself.  Not everyone reacts so emotionally, while trading.
5% of cold storage 10x short is perfect:

* Up 10%, trading stack gone but cold storage up 10% and BTC above major milestone $10k
* Down 10%, trading stack 2x, btc holdings+5%, 

Can't complain either ways.
i have no idea what drives that volume.. exchange shutdowns or regs can drive people into OTC markets I'd have to know the real drivers.
>Thanks, best advice so far. How much do you recommend? I don't wanna cash out 90%, go 5x long with 10% of my BTC, get liq'd and then have BTC run up to 100k lol

My 8 figure hedge has maintained around 25% margin for the better part of a year. That's my recommendation. 
$8750 to $9500 down to $9200 in 2 minutes. lol this shit is retarded
Try using the ALMA indicator as it uses a double EMA and is more smooth and responsive. There's various ways to trade with ALMA whether that be ALMA  upward and downward crosses over standard MA or EMA, or you can use two ALMA indicators with different periods to get buy/sell signals from.

Read about it here (check out number 3 for double ALMA crossing method):

https://tradingsim.com/blog/5-strategies-day-trading-arnaud-legoux-moving-average/
Yeah I'm just arguing it's more that we bounced off 8.8-9.2k long term more so than 9.4k.

If you want to be conservative you could expand it to include the resistance we'r
e at right now I guess. Just think this resistance is somewhat less important than the zone we're just above currently.

Edit: I don't view that div as particularly valid since they aren't exactly clear local highs on the time frame you're looking at, just some volatile chop. Same overall result but I'd say drawing it from 17k is better charting.
>Hey that brings up a great point. Over the years of following this tech and market -- have any of you previously had no insight into the world of finance -- and now know so much you probably know more than most back-office people in banks, exchanges, etc?

Yeah, very good point. I did not know much about heding, doing triple pair trades(long BTCUSD, long ETHUSD , short BTCETH because trending down in relation)  or funding rates until a few years ago. Then I learned that of course it's not a crypto thing that market moves together, tech moves together, commodities move together and so on.

And then more interesting stuff like what is a swap, what is a future, what is a option and their difference. and to learn about contango/backwardation and what that means for the mid term market. 

Another fun thing is that the good crypto exchanges are like 20 years ahead of my stock broker web sites. they look like something from 1996 and have basically a "buy and sell" button. No charts, orderbooks, advanced order flow tools and so on. 

I assume if you buy a real software it will have that, but to be a big stock broker and have that low level of tech compared to Binance or Bitmex is quite laughable
or to use a rubber
I know that some portion of a portfolio is generally invested in a currency. A lot of it is sovereign bonds though, because you generally don’t gain any returns from holding cash. You can speculate on exhange rates, but I don’t consider that investing. Buying bonds is
I agree with this, my main point was against yahoo
Genius? No. He didn't cure cancer or invent Bitcoin. He's a salesman. History will not look kindly on him and his ilk. In fact, it will revile them.
I want to buy Bitcoin because it's a superior form of money and therefore the inevitable future.

Much, much, MUCH better investment than Tesla, and I've been saying that for years.... and, well, the results have proved me right.
Yeah, the equities market is an obvious disaster waiting to happen.
I'm sure Mike knows what he's doing, if he's being truthful about his trades (which it seems like he is). 

~~Also, big players know that other whales could very easily lie about their positions at any point in time, and they'd be stop hunting effectively nothing (or even putting another whale in more profit).~~

~~I personally wonder if Mike is being truthful sometimes solely because when he posts, the move tends to go the other way by about 5-7% first, and then later it comes back around and puts him in profit. It's possible his entries have just been relatively unlucky a few times, but it gives me enough pause to think that it'd be pointless to try to stop hunt him because you have no idea if he's being honest or not.~~

~~He also kind of randomly started posting his trades when he never did before. For me it's a bit sus- the guy is really nice and seems legit but if I were a big player I'd be very wary of trying to stop hunt him.~~

He's legit, he just /position'd in the trollbox for me. Dude is a baller!
Didn't make it above 9.32k
>He had set the SL at 7%, which for sure was hit in this spike (9,300 - 9,400).

Didn't spike high enough on Bitmex. My position is intact. 
100x is awesome for minimizing losses and improving your ability to get a solid entry. You just don’t 100x your whole stack. I’m usually 100xing 1-2% of my balance and promptly setting stops at breakeven. Puts my max loss at market fees with unlimited returns. So I get stopped out of quite a few of them (like this one) but when I get the right entry it pays off.
> 100x so I will get kicked out quickly if things change on a dime.

He is well aware of his actions and where they might lead him, thus, good call.
really risky. should cut your losses.
Give me tips. :/

We already know that Bitfinex staff are allowed to trade on their own platform.
yeah but with proper position managment you don't get hurt. it's a part of the market you need to live with if you want to trade, you can just use stop limit instead of stop market to protect against it too.

But BFX is not perfect, but there is no better alternative

Bearish.
People already in position is understandable. Opening New positions now is gambling unless its long term. Short term positions will get chopped. 
Yes, 6 feet deep with no SL. 
My 890 1850 line is way higher, like 11.5.

I had some approximation of that line at one time using the 6k point, but I don't remember what it looked like and what the exact points were, but i remember deleting it after finding it unreliable.   (but also I still think there is something funny about your log/linear there)


Is that the same as sleeping with the fishes?
Market is run by these whales and exchanges, and when these whales are most active, I will avoid making assumptions that there will be a jump when you can see those whales unloading thousands of coins.
still 1 day at that rate beats citibanks entire APR.
8 days at that beats the vanguard mutual bond fund.. and no interest rate risk.


no i know im like what the fuck. dump to $8750 pump to $9500. What is this bullshit?
Yea, this stuff is kind of ridiculous. Wary to hold many coins anymore :(
When I was trying it out looked like they don't include wicks, trailing stop is trading price, so wick won't execute if somebody did huge sell, it will execute when market gets there and you have slippage from there. It's like normal stop but it moves.
There's a drop down in the order box with these three options. Each one has their pros on cons.
To short you need to borrow BTC not USD. Shorting is still possible at low rates, longing isn't. Thus less potential buy pressure more potential sell pressure. However, if the market is bullish and cash is buying not on margin, this might not really affect price.
Shorts need Btc and not usdt 
> Time to change my flair to bearish

Here we go. Moreover, being short term bearish favors my current position

I don't think he meant to suggest we were going to any time soon.
That's totally anecdotal but I agree that 10k is big from a psychological standpoint. So many were awakened to crypto gains in 2017 that I can't help but imagine there are many waiting with bated breath for the next rise. I think this is further supported by the expedited market cycles we've experienced compared to 2014.
> typically a rally starts with lots of short covering

really? For bitcoin or just for general markets?

I also read that a descending wedge is rarely a reversal as well. Typically we'd see a triple bottom or so as the reversal for bitcoin, I think.

And damn, that sucks. Why do you trade on CME? Less counter party risk than other exchanges?

The dip is inevitable, I guess it just depends when. Could be at some ridiculous heights.

This thing is going to start printing bear divs pretty soon though, so I wouldn't expect a push past mid $10s /low $11s without a pretty significant pullback. 

Buyers on gdax are drying up pretty quickly. Buy walls are thin as hell, falling an entire 1% behind bitfinex which is odd given they're pretty tight usually. Seems ominous honestly. 
Yeah, I hear that. It's why I'm still wasting brain cycles watching charts. Thought I'd soon have enough from trading to quit my job and write a bot, but Q1 2018...oh well. Good luck with yours!
GDAX = bullDAX, taking the lead would be a super bull indicator but i dont see that happening yet.. why do you say this?  I see them 40$ under bearfinex as usual



No idea to be honest. I'm inclined to just ignore these things now as it just gets too confusing otherwise. It's more insightful to see what the market does in reaction to this bullshit than paying attention to the actual bullshit imo

Also yes, it did oscillate quite a bit, I saw that too. It was basically just a frenzy due to low liquidity in that range after having been dumped and pumped on
Would it have been possible to close a (large) short in that small time? 

I'm curious to see if such a play does prevent the symmetrical triangle from breaking up...? Seems like I crazy amount of resources to waste if it doesn't work 
ah ok thx.
No, it’s not
On bitfinex's platform, they are equivalent (assuming you trust BFX to have enough _real_ USD on hand to honour your withdrawal - so far no signs to think otherwise).
Some people are full time traders and can't afford to hold until they're in the green. People look for patterns to explain things. And right now, this pattern looks similar to 2014. I will trade it as such until it proves otherwise (breach of 11.7k).
not the past 4 months no, but ive been holding since mid last year so im quite in the green. all the losses from holding in the past 4 months ive already made back this month and more because the coins i hold have been going up quite substantially. ive never have gotten close to touching my original investment. 
The implication it's that you are suppresing a breakup .

I don't believe in that, i just think your point was stupid. 
I’m bearish on sarcasm detection in this sub. Myself included 
I generally think it will *eventually* just don't know if now or after a more sizable correction 
it went up.  might go up some more.  but wait until you see how much it goes down.  then you'll learn why you don't buy at the top.
Does it really matter? I trade on several exchanges, BFX being the largest it's safe to assume that I do.
Depending on the time frames yeah you can be a bull on a 3 year time frame if you think the price will increase in that time frame 
[removed]
Trend lines generally connect lows to lows and highs to highs and don't just go straight through the average of everything.

I would recommend you search around tradingview a bit and see how other traders draw their lines and maybe try to emulate what they are doing to get a feel for what works and what doesn't.
I certainly plan to 100% hedge my long positions at 9700, but if we break 10K, I'll cut the shorts and let it ride at least until 11.5K
I like you and respect your opinion, but I think you're wrong and will be late to the party. Yes it can go a bit down, but if you don't overleverage and have liqui below 7k you're golden.
Yes of course.  A "bull run" will probably occur.  A bull run to $9.9K.

And yes, people will be selling/shorting like crazy above $12K (if we ever get there, and probably won't).

Bulls should be praying that Bitfinex gets into more trouble, because that's probably the only way the price is going to be manipulated significantly higher than we are right now.
It sounds like you understand it perfectly.  
Are you kidding? The bears were chortling and predicting "capitulation" and "despair" and "3K in three weeks" for months with zero rationale beyond someone dumping mass amounts of coins, like that person wouldn't run out of coins at some point. 

We have a shrinking supply and growing demand. That's all the TA you need. 
Of course there are fundamentals.  BTC transaction volume, exchange transaction volume, levels of retail adoption, how many countries have banned Bitcoin so far, etc, etc.

> its all a fucking crapshoot. no one knows whats going to happen.

Some very wealthy traders would disagree with you about that.  But you can pretend they don't exist, and they will continue to count their profits.
I do. It's going to go up just like it always has, and everyone who sold will kick themselves hard.
subway tuna is the real tuna sub, it follows tunoshi subacamotchi original vision.
i edited it.. you are correct.  it's not a fair assessment.  I was taught the same lessons, its universal.



Then who is responsible for these Barts bro? Someone has been accumulating since 6.5k
Thanks for the info.  Thats insanely bullish.  Buying it up right now.
I'm not saying it's bullshit at all. I'm just curious to know more about it. For example, the tweet clearly says 'off the exchanges', how does that fit in? 
buy FUD and sell bullshit hype.
just like when cnbc released that 'even grandma's buying bitcoin' to try to signify a top in their oh so subtle manner.  I went all in.


OTC?
> I was really lucky on Thursday, made back 15% of my losses in a singe trade only to lose half of it yesterday.

Y'know, that's pretty normal to me, don't be too hard on yourself.

To try get over that psychology,  I divide my trade logs into batches approximately a week at a time.    If a batch was in profit and then breaks even, I try to close it out, and start the next batch from the perspective of starting fresh.  If a week has passed and it is in profit, then I stop the batch and start fresh.  If it ends in a loss, I might keep it open until I break even, then close it, or use the next batch to even that previous one out.

There isn't a real science to how I track these deltas.  But splitting them up like this  helps me not take the losses too seriously, nor to abuse the gains as "house money".

> I know I'm trading too often/with too much on the line/too much leverage and that huge red candle incident shows me I probably would've gotten caught anyway, so I need to have lower liquidation prices as well. It's just too easy to get destroyed in this market.

I can get away with trading too much, though it can add up.  Too large positions or too much leverage is doom though.  

For small fish amateurs like us, IMO the more often we trade, the smaller our positions should be so we don't just burn it all away.

Keep it small for awhile, and then you'll get a feel of what moments are better for you to go bigger.

Right now I'm 50% allocated in a trade at 3x leverage  (will add more to this position if it goes up)  This is after a month in the dog house maxing out at 50% at 2x on any single position (so actually 100% at 1x, but with breathing room in the margin for orders in the book etc).  Though there have been times I was in a really comfortable spot where I went above these ranges in adding to positions.
I feel ya, I'm still in a recovery grind since a big February mistake.  Just started scaling trade size back up after noticing that I had reached a new level of consistency. 
Seems like you are doing revenge trading or try to focus too much on the money. Generally very bad ideas, since it will make your mind think less clearly
Yep fib retracements for me too. Just helps to get an idea where things will bounce/hold/drop
Is TA short for trend analysis?
I could also save the current price so people can judge for themselves whether to believe or not. Checking the user history and seeing his posts are always after a big movement makes it easier to weed out the fake ones.
There is also a question on where to get the prices, right now i'm using Coindesk, so there could be some difference between exchanges. The other day i was watching Bitfinex, Kraken and Bitstamp and on a BGD Bitstamp got behind 60$ for a while. If someone sets limit buys/sells they can catch a wick and in those cases it would be very hard to validate a price.
[deleted]
That's getting about 10 steps ahead of the market. 

If the market clears $12,000 and holds it for a week or so, then it's reasonable to start speculating about $20K+.

Until then, it's best not to get too excited. 
He might soon be Mike ex-BT
there's enough of a gulf between 30k and 13 mil to illustrate my point.  I know enough not to get margin called or to pay exorbitant taker fees.  What else do you really need to know?



Haha, my mistake. Whenever someone says "I can't mention THIS COIN here" instead of "I can't mention ALTCOINS here" I assume they are being prissy about Bitcoin cash.

Pretty sure we are still cool with posts like "guys do you think EOS is leading today's BTC action?" ... right? 

Did you sell at $2.8k or $4k? Was retarded that that was in the same day lmao
Happy vacationing then, good sir! Hopefully it's somewhere surrounded by turquoise waters. 
I'd still be checking these threads even while two chics were doing me at the same time.
Yeah. You should close yourself in your castle and swim in money instead of talking to plebs. /S

Posting how much is relevant. If I know that his kinda big position is around 10m then I know 3m is rather small and he's not risking much on that trade. It helps to follow if I want to do so.
/u/japanese__cat with 4 figs of BTC...  ok so you're Tibane.
First of all, what you shouldn't do is call non-millionaires plebians. It gives us millionaires that asshole reputation we're known for. Secondly, being a member of the world ruling bunch requires a lot more than 4 figs of BTC. Trust me, if you think you belong, you clearly don't. Thirdly, don't disclose your BTC holdings. One day, you may just wake up to see that one of these "plebs" now holds all your bags and you're left wondering why you didn't take my advice the first time around and simply kept your wealth quietly to yourself. ;) Ok there, Richie Rich?
not before we increase our leverage so we can kick it around a bit and make it look like it came back to life for a few months

Actually i have a different explanation for that, but doesnt necesarily contradict that. Bitcoin is pushing against 50$ lines, not very defined that have been points of resitance and support. Scalpers move a lot of money from bottoms to tops, and when it breaks the buying pressure (or selling) its immense . made this a few days ago, (yellow triangle) https://www.tradingview.com/x/HCrCi8XK/
Pure luck though. There's nothing to learn from this, actually worse because I made a mistake (no stop exit) and got paid.
Black swan events happen, sure, but we call them black swan as the odds of facing one are very low. Can you tell me you have seen things like this happening any day now? Do you assume a 8,5% volatility  with 9k BTC traded in 2m as normal? Me too, I say come on... if you were long with some stops you would have been stopped as well, leveraged or not leveraged.
>Didn't you have a stop loss of 7% earlier today?

Stop vs liquidation. One is voluntary at a pre determined threshold. Mine, for example, wasn't hit. 
Could be fat fingers or a bit gone haywire
(I'm not OP btw)
Thinking you can blame a bad trade on someone else is a fools erand. You and you alone take the risk, and reap the rewards and stand accountable for your trades.
I hope one day I can be that guy
I see it, kinda hard to miss. I thought "buying" means getting some sort of special access maybe. 
yeah i saw that candle. so what
At one point even them highly priced USDT is going to get used up. When that happens, and if there is not a substantial organic buys (no leverage) then this honey badger is going to roll over and die. ish. Its like stacking bricks on top of each other and having a bear nudge your tower down.
Thanks, another indicator I'll be monitoring closely
Nope, there is no significant change in Bfx longs associated with this funding shortage.

The likely explanation is that less and less traders seem to be willing to lend their USDT for 2-30 days (you can't claim it back early once it is taken by someone), which is obviously a bullish sign.
Just drop the price bellow 8k and that money will pour back in. 
It could be a good strategy to rise it a bit more to enjoy those high rates before dumping.
Yeah I glanced through it a bit yesterday. It's a lot different than it was years ago. For one, the hate now spans all of crypto (which, imo, is valid criticism). Also, the comments are much more balanced and reasoned then it used to be. 

It used to be complete circlejerk of repeated doomsday predictions that never came true. Claiming that people were buying the top at $40, $100, etc. I suppose those people either learned from their mistakes or a new generation has supplanted the old.
haha I find it funny.
Stop loss hunting could be a motive. Seeing as how sketchy Bitfinex has been, it would not surprise me if they were the ones doing it, or at the very least don't care.
Mate I watched it with my eyes open right after my morning coffee.
>  People who think deeply about the role of Bitcoin in the future are not elated by merchant adoption but rather tech and infrastructure.

Moving the goalposts.  And when that fails, you will just make up something else.

And I certainly do think that blockchain will revolutionize some industries and some gov't sponsored cryptocurrency will grow, so the gov't can track all your spending and you will have zero financial privacy.

However,  Bitcoin isn't going to grow in adoption much.  It is inferior to many other cryptocurrencies in most every way and it has already had its change to gain significant retail and consumer adoption and it failed.
China and India (and other countries) didn't make typewriters illegal.
Yes that is just Bitcoin and I disagree that Bitcoin is going to take over the world.

I agree that other cryptocoins will find their different niches over time.
The timeframes don't matter with fractals. You can compare a 15 minute chart with a 3 day chart and see the same pattern play out - that's the whole point of fractals. It's arguable whether what he posted is similar enough to really warrant much consideration, but if you are looking at fractal patterns in general you disregard time.
The cycles don't have to follow immediately after each other. The next start of a major bear trend (i.e. distribution) could happen at $50k. Who knows. It's just important to study the patterns of the market so that you're ready when the tides are turning.
> That buys up every available BTC at the best available price until my order is filled.

Very clear.

> Now I can come in and make a 2500 BTC limit sell at 9000.

So from what I understand is, you sold 2500 BTC because you think it is the right price and time to sell them?
Wow, he said that to you. Amazing.
He /position'd in chat for me last night, called out my name and showed me the position size with the exact entry he said here. 

He definitely has a lot of coins, showed me his hedge on futures, too.

I do agree that following his every word solely based off of his position sizes is generally not the best idea, but he's not lying about them or anything
In my own subjective experience, I found TA in to be more effective on the way down. I didn't sell much into fiat, but managed to increase my btc stack substantially more than had I sold and rebought it all, through shorting spikes with tight stops. I think I'd have found it more stressful sitting in fiat trying to catch the knife. Unlike on the way up last year when I grew impatient waiting for dips and longed a few tops. Maybe I'm just getting better at it with time but the indicators felt more reliable to me in a bear market.
I "short" by not buying so in that sense I was short from November to the $6k low which I got lucky and caught at exactly $6k. I'm short right now with a buy order at $8.75K that looks like it might never execute. But generally, yeah, with Bitcoin the point should be to get more Bitcoin because it goes up over time like nothing else.
then you should buy and hold for 366 days

Nothing wrong with that if it works for you, but you are leaving a lot of potential profits on the table.
[deleted]
That's called hedging . 
Exchange shutdowns in a particular currency area will give a single spike (like what happened in China when the exchanges were shut off). But those are rare events. Regulations apply to exchanges as well as OTC brokers.  Perhaps you meant P2P trade instead of OTC? On that note, Localbitcoins recently made identification of users mandatory.

Localbitcoin has a 1% fee on trades, and the spread is way bigger. Much more than exchanges. Even if you don't have access to an exchange in your currency area, you'll only use LBC as an on-ramp. Not for day (or even week) trading.

In my experience as a trader on both LBC and Paxful, 95% of my customers are less than 6 months in crypto.
Looks good any idea what the formula is? Had a quick search and can't seem to find it. Cheers for the advice again
Just looking at my pension fund annual report now, it clearly distinguishes between bonds and cash. If you're wondering it's managed by Lombard Odier, you might have heard of them.
I'm assuming you are still holding your position?

$9,400 was broken, but I wouldn't say it was broken work conviction. 
Yeah mate I figured that out by reading comments by fellow redditors.

I remember we both opened at the same time with a price difference of only $13. 

Do you think we will revisit that range anytime soon?
could, should, would. Sticking to the plan for now. **No pain No gain**
Ouch. Small position i hope?
More like making love to whales.

You could also argue that there might be other whales buying these coins. If you were a whale and wanted to sell alot of coins, would you crash the market with a market sell, losing a substential amount of fiat due to slippage?
>still 1 day at that rate beats citibanks entire APR.

Substantial counter party risk. I earned 35% over a substantial period of time  by lending USD, before BFX got hacked, stole 33% of my usd and forced me to enter their token scheme. Look at risk adjusted ROI. 
big boi SL hunters is my guess. I wonder if mike is okay
thanks for the clarification.
Looks like we're being downvoted for having a different sentiment than other people. 
True. I didn't fully read the OP. Just used to permabulls interjecting with wild speculation so I took it in that context.
Which is good, the longer we crawl up a wall of worry the better. Once FOMO kicks in the less time we'll have before a major pullback again.
there's a lot of shorts and a lot of people stuck in the 'short the rally' mode right now.  So most of the moves up are short covering.. i havent seen the new money FOMO in yet.  It may not happen.. but short covering alone is a powerful force.

Thanks! It’s been a real pain choosing C++ over python but I’ve finally got it all setup and am able to backTest it :D right now I’m just running it on a UNIX server I own backtesting away on a stupid algorithm that just looks at RSI of 5 min charts but the framework is all setup just need to implement many more indicators into the algorithm 
They were about $80 under for a few minutes about 15 minutes ago. They hit like $9362 while finex was at $9440.

It's nice for the funding rate on mex :)
yes take a look at the order book graphically it shows you the depth chart.. on GDAX right now i could cover 332BTC or a 3 mil short and only raise the price 80$.. others have more liquidity.



.. Wouldn't it be fair to say that anything the FDIC insures is USD more or less? At least up until that 250k number? The FDIC is basically saying it is by insuring it no? You're certainly not getting any insurance on USDT lol
Yes. It is. They're just numbers on a screen denominated as USD (or informally known as IOUs) that's FDIC insured.
It's not, you have FDIC + the faith of the US government to bail out the banks. Which as of today is near certainty. Banks were allowed to fail in 2008 in rare cases, but no consumer assets were lost, really.

You could argue that economics have changed, but for the US banks, that is virtually guaranteed, inflationary US dollars that they have access to. We could discuss fractional reserves all day, but it is what it is.

If you do not understand L14dys point, you probably should not be trading. 
That doesn't answer the question. 
A big spoof wall appeared trying to stop the breakdown of a rising wedge, which was itself part of the breakdown of a larger rising wedge, which was itself part of the breakdown of a larger rising wedge. At each point of near-breakdown, there was a similar event. Please tell me, am I stupid or are you biased?
i was a bull til i came back and found out its become a giant casino for degenerate gamb..traders and a bunch of institutions pretending like they're 'just coming in' when in reality they bought a year+ ago and are deseprately looking to dump to the waning volume of retail buyers out there

[removed]
Thanks, and that's fine, I can totally see why you'd think that. I'm definitely a bit less sure than I used to be, and like I said, at some point you become more bullish as it goes higher rather than more bearish because of factors that change over time. For me, I'd rather get burned trying to short up to $12k than dumped on by going long. If we break $12k I can see much more significant movement upwards and will likely more than make up for losses by going long 
So you're saying that BTC will never get to $12k? Wanna make a 1 BTC bet?
i really dont care which way the market goes, im bullish long term so im holding long term. ive made healthy profits since i started so i dont care what happens short or medium term. so far fundamentals are indicating quite a bright future, just because a few 3rd world countries with relatively insignificant economic activity banned the use of bitcoin doesn't mean its going anywhere. i dont care how whales play the market short term, im not ballsy to day trade in this market with any significant capital.
The one on BFX earlier today (9500 & 8750 in the same 5min candle)
I think a big part of my problem is finding entry and exit points. I had a long from 8.9 the other day that I closed out at 9.25. Great trade for me, made a good profit. Since then we've been to 9.4 and back to 8.75 (albeit on a wick). When we are 8.8 yesterday I bought into the doom and gloom and didn't go long because I thought it was real possibility we would test 8.2. Now we're back up at 9.2-9.4 and while it feels high, if we're going to 9.7/10 then this would be the place to get in. 

Of course, I could've kept my long open but it was high leverage, with liquidation at around 8.5 or so - so closing it seemed to be the smart thing to do.

Now here we are, dumped from 9.4 down to 9.25 and it's already back at 9.3 - should I open a long here? I don't know, I feel paralyzed. And as a general rule I try not to go short too often, the r/r doesn't seem worth it from my perspective and I'm not as confident at reading those situations.
Yes. Which I believe in. But I don't generally believe people that say they opened a winning trade hours or sometimes even 15-30 minutes earlier
It stands for teaching assistant, which is an euphemism for a young female assistant to an older person in a position of power and an interesting sexual arrangement

So in this context "mah ta" is an hope for future wealth to fund a torphy wife
I'd probably lean bitfinex or bitstamp, unless you could average them easily. Reporting spot at time of posting is a good solution. Great idea. 

Outside of a giant candle situation, we don't often move so fast that 5% ($480 right now) would be an unfair cap. 
Agreed. Observers should take notes on sticking to the plan.
So I assume you’ve closed your long position?

Also, it seems to me that $10k would be a good place to short; stop loss at 13k and take profit at 5k; would you agree?
Unless the rules changed again, alt discussions belong in the alt thread. It sucks because lately alts have been the leading factor to btc pumping.
i sold in the 3k's.. i kicked myself because i knew he was gonna pump on CNBC at 5pm that day and was a no brainer to hold until then but i couldnt believe the luck.. it was like 800 the week before.   So my eyes grew wide and i lost my cool.  I dumped my entire cold wallet lol.  Never bought a single BCH, all fork coins.


> Happy vacationing then, good sir! Hopefully it's somewhere surrounded by turquoise waters.

Thanks! Beautiful view from which to post on reddit: https://imgur.com/a/SA1zCcb
The value of stake may be relevant or may not. Without other factors included it is quite irrelevant. Look at Ver, for whom his net-worth is almost the main argument for anything.
The plebs and ruling of the world was an irony aimed at people above IQ 65. I can disclose whatever I want anywhere. There are much richer cryptohodlers, who try to piss off many people and do it under their own names. So if you want to give security advices, talk to them.

Yeah, I mean more like "I'm glad you got lucky and made money" rather than "nice application of skill!" lol
Trading has an element of gambling in it because you have no control over the market (provided you're not a MM). Sure there are lots of strategies to optimize your R/R, but still is a bit of gambling whichever way you slice it. Nothing wrong with that.

Although as you increase your leverage, it resembles gambling even more. With crypto, most people who trade with leverage get rekt eventually. I'd be careful.
It also depends on if you're talking about your entire stack or a stack specifically allocated to that trade. In the second case, there's little difference between a hard stop and a liquidation. 
Can you imagine fat fingering like $30m worth of coins
Then I definitely won't blame you at all, except if you wrongly translated OP's mindset :P
Wow, chill. It's not because you don't get how humor works wherever you are from that you can patronise people for having some fun.

I was OBVIOUSLY not even making the point that I could ever blame anyone for a trade. Maybe you were speaking generally but that sounded like you misunderstood my childish humour.
Don't. It wouldn't surprise me to learn that the same person who just pushed up the price had been lurking here. This is why it's ill-advised to post position size and entry point. One or the other, but surely not both. 
Oh really?

Explain this chart then: https://imgur.com/a/mmLmHZ3
>Just drop the price bellow 8k and that money will pour back in.

Why?
Yeah the one thing that kills almost all arguments for me is that anyone cocksure now is the top will possibly look as dumb as the guys saying it at $30, lol.

And yeah I enjoy the alt criticisms the most because that stuff is just ridiculous

Nope, I never set these goal posts and neither did a lot of people who were thinking critically about the issues and solutions at hand. That's not to say that a microtransaction use case wouldn't be awesome and I'm confident that the tech will converge towards that point (through layered solutions) but it's clearly orthogonal to the whole point of immutable, decentralized, censorship-free hard money.

>And I certainly do think that blockchain will revolutionize some industries and some gov't sponsored cryptocurrency will grow, so the gov't can track all your spending and you will have zero financial privacy.

There will undoubtedly be some variety of government-sponsored "crypto" projects but these are vastly inferior to what Bitcoin offers.

>However, Bitcoin isn't going to grow in adoption much.

Oh, I didn't realize you were clairvoyant.

>It is inferior to many other cryptocurrencies in most every way and it has already had its change to gain significant retail and consumer adoption and it failed.

Oh brother, please explain. From my point of view Bitcoin is vastly superior to these centralized shitcoins that you're likely referring to. Would welcome a discussion on the merits and demerits of the tech though. What is your argument here?
were you in china in the 90s?    You'd be surprised what they made illegal, or heavily restricted.




The same pattern on 15 min and 3 day is what I would consider a fractal.  Here we have a comparison with both on daily charts.  Its not a pattern like a H&S or cup and handle.  Its a whole 3 year bear market plus recovery and start of bull run being squeezed into dec. to now to make it look like we're about to take off. [This](https://i.imgur.com/n7NwlZx.png) is a real comparison to what 2014 looks like.  Its not as bullish so if you post that people will say its a bad comparision.  But if you can make it look bullish by stretching it into ridiculously opposite time frames and call it a fractal so time frame doesn't matter then its legit.
He explained the how, which is what you asked. The why is a different story and up to speculation.
The "why" doesn't matter. If you have 2500 BTC in your account you can do with it what you please. Sell it in small chunks with market orders, place limit sells, or sell it in one big market order which would clear the orderbook all the way down to whatever price the order is fully filled. 
You sold and probably re bought right after to clear the books up to 9500 triggering stop losses / liquidations
I think the whales care about us more than we could ever know

>I do agree that following his every word solely based off of his position sizes is generally not the best idea, but he's not lying about them or anything

Shouldn't follow anyone's trades blindly. While I may have a bit more experience and deeper pockets than the average trader here, this does not translate into a perfect crystal ball. Not all of my trades will profit as planned.

I'm human, after all. My assistant puts my pants on one leg at a time.

> everyone reacts emotionally 

Nope.  You are so far from being capable of that, you can't even believe that it exists.

I was like that for many years (decades actually), so I get it, but I don't remember believing that no one else was capable of more than I.
Hmmm, interesting. Inwould have thought that cash is just stuck into a sovereign bond. 

I know Lombard Odier. Are you from Switzerland?
>I'm assuming you are still holding your position?
>
>$9,400 was broken, but I wouldn't say it was broken work conviction. 

Yep, markets still struggling to stay in that range. Still waiting on that conviction. 
What are your thoughs about last couple of hours. I think that if 9350 holds we will atleast test 9750 again, if not break it on the second attempt. If bulls do not break it that could be trigger for massive dumps 
All of my trading stack, but yes not a very big position. It is short and I am ready to wait more given the fact what we saw this morning.
Making love or getting fucked??
> If you were a whale and wanted to sell alot of coins, would you crash the market with a market sell, losing a substential amount of fiat due to slippage?

Yes.
Only after unloading 90% of my bags at the top =)
yeah its not exactly FDIC insured.. i guess that explains the high rates. 
You realise all it takes is one guy with like $10M to restore the interest rates to normal levels? You realise bitfinex themselves can do that on a whim, using their pocket change?
I care about the moonies and I go where it goes!

Thus the urgent need for a short list of the more promising indicators.
> choosing C++ over python 

but why?
The point is that you are not holding usd. You are holding an iou that js guaranteed to be worth the face value if it’s value does not exceed some nominal amount. USDT is not that different, except that their deposits are not guranteed by anyone except Tethery/Bitfinex
I understand how this works, I messaged a quick response before watching my show as a quick summary as I didn't have the time to explain all of that. I know they're ious... holy cow get your pretentiousness out the fucking door. The banks work like that because that's the laws in place. You're all doing Bitfinex's work by letting them act this way, and giving them countless excuses. They cannot operate the same way Banks do. They won't for long anyway.

USDT is not FDIC insured.
??
When you withdraw from bitfinex to your bank account you're obviously getting dollars.
For each of those wedges i can draw you an ascending triangle breaking up.

You can't just draw some lines and call it TA. 
> A big spoof wall appeared trying to stop the breakdown

It has been happening everyday for some time now, no you are not an idiot!
Also, this prediction i made a few days ago : https://www.tradingview.com/x/HCrCi8XK/ Horizontals are much more solid than diagonals. You should at least use RSI or bbands to get a basic idea of what its happening. Even EW can be helpful in some cases. 
LOL, someone definitely got liquidated. 
Never said that.  Your reading comprehension is kind of poor.
> theres no fundamentals for anything in this market

> so far fundamentals are indicating quite a bright future,

Umm...ok

>  just because a few 3rd world countries with insignificant economic activity banned the use of bitcoin doesn't mean its going anywhere.

China and India
1m candle actually
Good call to take the profit there.  And yeah, right now seems pretty sketchy for shorting.  I'll hold out on a short until we go parabolic.

I did regret not taking more from a position the other day.  But I did not regret that I stopped it out in some profit at least when it went down.  Thing is, I didn't want to take more profit then because I wanted to leave some open for potential higher pushes.

We can't call the tops or bottoms, let's not beat ourselves up over that.

What I *can't* do is the all-in all-out trades like chewy where you can get a big dose of profit. (or loss).  The only way I can lock in profits is by laddering, otherwise I will keep holding out and end up breaking even or taking a pittance in a SL.  

So from one perspective the ladder makes me see smaller profits than that on a per-trade basis, but from another perspective I probably wouldn't make anything at all otherwise.

Have to really not focus on what could have been after you have the hindsight of what the potential range of your trade became.
Why would you assume that? I still have it open with stops at breakeven and no targets in mind as of yet.  

I didn't say that I don't think the market will make a new all time high. Just that there's a long way to go between here and there, and it's not worth speculating about either way at this point in time. 


you still sold BCH at $3k dude. That's wild. 
Got it! My misinterpretation of "brilliant" =) 
You guys should understand there are humans in reddit, not bots. Humans usually deals with emotions and sometimes type with sentiment. "Nothing to do" was a bit too much, I give you credit there, but you did not know my leverage. I was 2x because that's the minimum. I was not gambling, I was following a rising wedge that had just broke down. I was following the trend with a 5% sl. Then a black swan happened. Let me be salty and keep you morale for yourself, respectfully. Oh and, were you in when it happened?
>It also depends on if you're talking about your entire stack or a stack specifically allocated to that trade. In the second case, there's little difference between a hard stop and a liquidation. 

On Bitmex, you are liquidated at 0.5% and lose more money, than with a stop loss. Okex I believe takes 1%. There is a very big difference between a hard stop and a liquidation.
It's Bitcoin. Stranger things have happened. 


Something similar happened on Gemini when it first launched.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3sqjrf/gemini_2200_per_bitcoin_are_they_out_of_bitcoin/

I apologise if it came forth in a bad way, it was meant as a advise nothing else. And i can see the sarcasm/ humor in your comment
Longs would start closing and returning the funds used to open the positions. 
What do you think what happened?
> However, Bitcoin isn't going to grow in adoption much.
> 
> Oh, I didn't realize you were clairvoyant.

You are right.  "Bitcoin is not likely to grow in adoption much".  That is better and it was lazy of me to speak so absolutely about it.

> From my point of view Bitcoin is vastly superior to these centralized shitcoins that you're likely referring to. 

You  apparently think Bitcoin is superior to every other cryptocurrency (1000+ of them).  I disagree.
Ah yeah good point, now I understand what you were saying.
thanks u/haserfauld for explaining how it's possible. 

**Why** to me indicates a clear bearish outlook.
They really just want what's best for us.
If you believe in bitcoin long term and are patient then yes that is a good plan, but you should look up how to set up a hedge short. I'm expecting the cycle to repeat eventually, full parabolic bullrun followed by bear reversal, and if we ever another obvious bear market, a short hedge with wide trailing stop would protect your gains on the way down without your having to actively trade or time the bottom. 
Personally, the market looks like it wants to continue the short term uptrend. 

I wouldn't be surprised to see the $10,000s this weekend. 
My brother, if your bet was right and we were over bought and it went to 8500 you would be getting pats on the back.

We win some and we lose some.  Even if this is all your trading stack, my guess is you can move from storage \> trading if you see the right opportunities on a r/r basis.

Good luck.
Why not both
So why don't they? What's the intent behind letting margin long funding dry up like this?
BitFinex has some explanations to do!!!
So change flair back to bullish?
On one hand I feel like you are technically correct.  On the other hand, we might have a major crash and everybody will talk about how they saw it coming.  On the third hand it might be a self-fulfilling prophecy, where the actual funding doesn't directly impact a drop, but the market drops anyway.
Yes and no, the bot is shockingly in the green for over a month now with just RSI algorithm, but I refuse to believe this is more than just luck, thus I want better indicators 
I'm a uni CS student. I have an interest in trading, and I have a huge interest in systems programming and "lower" highlevel programming. So my background is in C/C++. I've done projects in python before and its a cool language and all, but I don't feel challenged. I MUCH prefer writing C++ code to python and in THEORY C++ code should run a lot faster than python code. 
I should clarify. Is the user receiving an IOU of USD, or USDT?  They're very distinct differences.

On Gemini, the same "IOUs" denominated as USD is FDIC insured.
Sure but I feel like that's a pretty huge difference ahaha... I get that technically neither of them are real USD, but I way rather hold an iou backed by a US gov. corporation than Tether which is backed by... Nobody..?? For all intents and purposes anything up to 250k in a bank may as well be USD. I hope (but can't really be sure) that the same can be said with tether.. 
USD provided by any non-american bank is also not FDIC insured, just saying
I'm not sure that we disagree on anything. Your short response did not indicate that you knew.

Bitfinex may end up being Countrywide and end up failing, who knows. It sounded ridiculous at the time, now it seems amazing that more did not end up like them. The laws put in place protected American citizens of cash loss, but nearly wiped out the global economy. 
They're not equivalent. A user should know if they're receiving USD or USDT. They cannot be the same thing.

Edit: an iou based on USD or USDT. Sheesh, I thought this went without saying.
>You can't just draw some lines and call it TA.

I guess you're right, in your case you have to draw your own chart, too.
i cant close my shorts they're on the CME and its closed today haha.  I missed my shot.

"if we ever get there, and probably won't"
bitcoin wasn't banned, all that happened were that local exchanges have been massively regulated and banks are making it difficult to inject capital into the market. yeah it sucks but its been this way with China for a while and it hasn't slowed the market down. India's activity in the crypto-space is pretty paltry. 

i'll start to sweat a little if a 1st world progressive country decides to outright ban bitcoin (which is impossible, but lets just entertain the idea). 

regardless, none of these countries have outright banned bitcoin. they just restricted capital flow into the market by regulating intermediaries like banks and exchanges. people still use OTC markets and peer-to-peer trading like LBC. plus its still possible to route money to exchanges by not directly depositing money into exchanges. theres nothing stopping anyone from those countries from depositing money into a paypal-like intermediary and then sending that money to an exchange. you can restrict capital flow but you can never outright ban crypto unless you live in a tyrannical dictatorship shit-hole.
My bad. You were talking about not speculating and not getting too excited so I assumed that you closed your position. 
almost all the bitcoiners did.. lol.. we all hated bcash back then
it was like roger's gift to bitcoin.  It actually froze at 9000 on GDAX open.

I like to pretend I'm english sometimes. I think that's how they use it. at least that's how they did in harry potter...lol
Alright I'll let you be salty. Take care.
Really? It was my understanding that whatever is remaining in your maintenance margin is refunded to your balance but tbh I've never actually checked the numbers after a liquidation. Where does this money go otherwise? To the exchange or the Bitmex's insurance fund?

edit: I believe I answered my own question with a bit of research. The funds do get allocated to the insurance fund on Bitmex. Is it the same at OKEx?
True, although, I could be wrong, but my gut is that the stops for longs are lower than the stops for shorts.  i.e. shorts are more for quick scalps while longs are more long term bullish.

Yeah I get that you disagree. Care to explain *why*?
Or someone testing the resilience of the market. The fact that we jumped right back up form this and then even continued to go up further could be a testament to the confidence of the market.

I'm sure there's a bunch of ways of interpreting this, personally wouldn't try to read to much into it.

> pats on the back.

Not the case as we all know haha.

> We win some and we lose some.

Very good advise for all of us. But as far as it goes for moving my stack from cold > trading, I don't see that as an option anymore. I am still in good gains for April, which I will post publicly before the closing of the month. Thanks brother! :)
I really don't know, that's why I'm puzzled. Maybe they want to bump up the FRR? Maybe they do want to rek margin longers? Could be anything. But it is an undeniable fact - rates are like this only because finex allows them to.
tl;dr: you have 3 hands!

Wow, that's got to be encouraging!
I doubt performance will be important, but I suppose it will make you more employable for this sort of work. So fair enough.
Tether is not covered by FDIC (nor any other type of insurance provided by any organization on any exchange, AFAIK). Tether's own TOS state that it's not actually worth anything at all - but this is lawyer gamemanship to avoid regulatory attention. FDIC does cover your USD on Coinbase, though, for example. But *only* the USD, not the USD value of your account.

You're totally right that it is a huge difference, you guys both have valid points.
This is ridiculous. The user has no concept for usd vs usdt. Also, only anerican banks are legally permitted to hold usd, because they receive deposits from the fed. If you have a usd account with a foreign bank, all you hold is ious
The above poster has correctly answered your question.

>You're receiving numbers in your database entry that says you are entitled to withdraw that much USD or USDT from them.

In essence, it's neither, it's numbers on a screen. You can sell BTC to someone who has tether in their account and then withdraw it as USD, or vice versa. 


Why ask if you just want to hear what you want to hear...oh your flair 
Show me your TA and i will debate it. 

Anyway, i think for the moment we should use horizontal ranges. The chart i posted before has been accurate for the last few days for me, A breakdown out of it will probably put us on 8400 levels. And considering we are fighting horizontals between tops and bottoms, using triangles makes a lot more sense than wedges. 
Google the word "probably".  It can be your word for the day and you can learn something new.
It's a matter of public record what was done.  China and India both effectively banned people from buying Bitcoin in their countries...about 3 billion people.

No, they didn't ban Bitcoin from existing.  No, they didn't ban the use of the word Bitcoin or ban people from thinking about it.  They effectively have banned 3 billion people from buying it (and using it in commerce).  That's enough for me.  If it's not enough for you, then great.
GDAX halted all selling meanwhile sales were going through at 3-9k.   Tin foil hat says it was clear insider trading, but we will never know.  So dumb I was trying to sell it at 4k and wasnt even able to do it with GDAX "down" besides for employees or insiders or whoever was making those trades.
Correct and you had me fooled you were English once. 
>Really? It was my understanding that whatever is remaining in your maintenance margin is refunded to your balance

Not on Crypto exchanges, that's why Bitmex has 6200 bitcoins in the insurance fund. I'm sure that many of them also didn't read the FAQ/tutorials and have been using liquidations in place of stops. 

>edit: I believe I answered my own question with a bit of research. The funds do get allocated to the insurance fund on Bitmex. Is it the same at OKEx?

Yes, though Okex takes 1% while Bitmex only takes 0.5%.
Yeah, on bitfinex the Max leverage is 3.3 so its hard to get liquidated either way. Shorters are always worried of a Bull run so they have tighter stops. 
It is boring to explain the obvious...sorry.
Cheers mate, your information is of great value. :)
Well; I am of the opinion that interpreting it as a possible test can provide a lot of insight into why this market behaves as it does. So therefore, helpful that you mentioned it.
thanks!
It is but the algorithm is literally:
If(RSI is under 40 and we don’t currently hold this coin) buy coin 
If(RSI is over 60 and we hold coin) sell coin 

I REFUSE to believe that that dumb of an algorithm actually works it must be luck :P
Yeah in my bots case it definitely won’t effect performance, but I graduate in the fall and I have a serious interest in algo trading/high frequency trading and all job postings I find for these things require years of experience in said programming fields and also want the experience to be in C/C++, so I’m just trying to learn/do what I can. 
But muh narrative.
The reason I bring this up is BECAUSE I understand USD vs USDT. And I'm not hasty to just "go along" with their platform and procedurals. Nice try though. It's gonna be great when this all collapses. Really, it will.
You also think “accumulation” belongs on the “supply” side of supply vs demand. I think I’ll forego the debate 
Want to take that bet and *probably* make an easy 1 BTC or not?
lol okay buddy, then short the market or capitulate. the market will chug along.
Hahaha wait are you serious? 😂 
Good to know. Thanks.
Yeah I guess I shouldn't have given you the benefit of the doubt that you actually had something substantive to say. Another day, another mindless troll.
Have you tried it in both bear and bull markets?
How far back have you backtested it?
O no, thats just because you can't fucking read.  
Yes makes a lot of sense to make a bet where the conditions of the bet never expire.  And how do you think I could possibly ever win that bet...when it never occurs and you pay up.  Such mental giants in this sub.
I do short the market quite often. I also go long quite often.
"troll" = someone who disagrees with me.
Well, it’s definitely been through last months bear market, and it’s still running, so if you believe we are in a bull market atm then yes, if not then no. 
I'll make it easy for you. $12k within a year from the start of the bet. We could do it with an ETH smart contract so there'd be no way out of it for us. I'll definitely take this bet. You *probably* won't.
Lol, the gall. You're a troll because you have nothing of substance to say on the matter. Just "hurr durr, adoption, hurr durr, blocksize." I gave you more than one opportunity to explain your argument if you had one but you apparently don't.

Maybe try /r/bitcoinbeginners or something.
I don't know how to do ETH smart contracts and I don't trust you in this deal.  You already accused me of saying something I didn't and don't trust those who create straw men.
Just like I thought: more bullshit and no balls.
