[Daily Discussion] Friday, May 04, 2018 -- TITLE
#New post: [\[Daily Discussion\] Saturday, May 05, 2018 →](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8h53jf/daily_discussion_saturday_may_05_2018/)
So..

Really love the idea of posting trades and tracking everyone’s moves/positions, etc. But, I’m a little concerned that the entire thread is gonna become clustered with going long, closing short, etc. (kinda like we’re seeing now..). This would take away from the commitment to market analysis and discussion, while also making the daily quite a mess. 

I’m wondering if there may be a better way to go about this? A second daily dedicated to constant positions being posted? A sticky at the top of the daily where all positions are commented below?

Thoughts? Thinking out loud here. 
[BitcoinMarkets Open Positions](http://bitcoinmarkets.atwebpages.com/index.php)

I believe this bot can help traders check theirs and other users active and closed positions. 

Changes:
* Added new options to check position history from users.

* Change syntax to make it simpler to use. Stack % now can be placed like 50% instead of 0.5

* Changed the bot user to use my own since the other one didn't have enough Karma to post replies

* Created a protection so examples can be post and not be inserted in the database. Just use xxxx for value. (!short XBTUSD xxxx 5x 25%)

* Multiple positions are allowed for user, i can have a short on ETHUSD, a long on BTCUSD, another short on ETHBTC, etc


Known limitations:

* Edited comments are not parsed by the bot


Any suggestions or bug reports are welcome.
Ok, that is ridiculous. 11,500 BTC buy on OKEX quart futures. holy shit. Got sold into too, down to around 4,000 bitcoin. They stopped indicating if that was a margin call I think.

Either way, $112MILLION buy, even at 20x, thats a 5Mil+ buy. Wowza wowza

**Edit: Based on how much it got sold into almost immediately (7k BTC were sold into that order), I can only speculate one of 3 things were going on:

1) A wash trade from someone trying to play the premium

2) Arbitrage.... but trust me, not easy in that market

3) A huge long (or several) saw an opportunity to get out with zero slippage, and took advantage

Either way, some crazy action over there. Fun times. Glad I was able to get a bit more long just before that.\

*Edit2:

or 4) There is some insider news, that buys like that would flag the fucking SEC if this shit was regulated XD

I bought some more, whatever.


[ahem](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8f8uou/daily_discussion_friday_april_27_2018/dy2zvzm/?context=3&st=jgsg9thb&sh=aa121de1) 
I've been obsessed with Bitcoin/crypto since the "Cyprus bail-in 'bubble'" in spring 2013. I'd heard about it before and vaguely knew what it was, but I thought it was complete bullshit and never dove into it before that. Seeing ~$150 prices and thinking about how anyone who had invested in 2009-2012 could have made generational wealth on a tiny, tiny initial investment gave me pause and led to me reading everything I could find about it. 

After doing my research, I was one of those annoying jackasses in fall 2013 talking about crypto to all of my friends and anyone who would listen about how it was the future. I guess I kind of believed it back then, but mostly I just wanted to encourage interest and be able to discuss it with other intelligent, open-minded people that I know. As anyone else involved in the scene at the time knows, this wasn't an idea that anyone other than software folks and/or anti-government folks was amenable to. 

Based on my own experiences and observations of a significant proportion of people currently involved in crypto, it is my belief that you have to be cognizant of 2-3 bubble cycles before you really sit down and think to yourself "Bitcoin, wtf is that? how do I keep hearing about this and how does this keep happening? Maybe this is something I should look into". 

EVERYONE heard about it last fall. When we convincingly pass $10,000 again everyone is going to hear about it again. A lot of people who wrote it off are finally going to do some level of research to see what it's all about and realize that they were wrong. Even if they don't fully grasp *why* they were wrong, they'll throw a couple hundred bucks at it hoping for another "bubble". 

For the last 5 years (! where is the time going?!), I've had a bitcoin price widget on my phone's homescreen and I've spent roughly an hour every day following developments in this space. I'm not at all claiming to be any kind of expert, but between being accustomed to the usual price movements and closely following general sentiment (both online and amongst people I know in real life), I'm thoroughly convinced that this about to fucking explode. 

I very well could just be drunk, but this just feels so blindingly obvious to me. Does anyone really think this experiment is fully played out? There's just no fucking way that $9,600 is the highest price we'll ever see. I've diversified into some other cryptos (mostly ETH), but my fundamental message is that I'm all in on this as of 5/3 and I'm more confident than ever that it's going to make me rich.  

Wish me luck.

Planned to long the green box but mex only made it there for 2 seconds and no other exchange made it down there.

Now I'm just gonna DCA everything under 9.7k after LTC broke out of the same formation on 6 hour chart. 

Expecting BTC over 10k in short time. Probably around daily candle close. 
Really looking like $11,800 is a target here:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/OPbydY85/

This is absolutely not the best entry here at 9740. However, I've been building a small/medium position for a while in the high $8k's to low $9k's, so I am willing to open a bit here as my avg price (and more importantly, my margin call price) will still be low. Low enough to know if/when I am wrong, it will be without significant risk.

Also curious to see if the BTC pump lags the alt pump as before. It's a tough thing to call, but I am moving around my portfolio to buy more BTC (mainly Eth ---> BTC). That ratio has ridiculous growth:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/IUCEnmxY/

In the past year and a half, I have been 50-60% Bitcoin, 30% Eth, and 20% XMR. Just for perspective. I moved some around into Eth on the large dip (which turned out to be a nice move), and am thinking to go around 70% BTC here. let's see how it plays out.

I'd appreciate any charts folkes have, as this isn't a typical "Entry"/"Exit" post for me. 

Happy trading out there folkes.


Bulls have spoken and up we go.  Really impressed with the momentum these past few days.  
Is the new normal on gdax 8k-12k volume daily, or is the volume extremely down on all exchanges except Bitmex? Even with these pumps, gdax only has 10k volume.
I have no idea if GDAX is really having much of an effect on BFX since it's running about 1/5th the volume (on this hourly candle - some others got to 1/3 to 1/2+ the volume) but damn it's being such a party pooper these past couple days. I realize under 1% isn't that large of a difference in the grand scheme of things but it's odd since it was pretty much in lock step up until we broke back above 9.2k. 

Most other fiat exchanges (Kraken, Bitstamp) are at around a $30 discount compared to BFX/other USDT exchanges while GDAX sits at $60. On CMC tether is currently at 0.998 USD (not sure how that's calculated) which would put Kraken/Bitstamp right in line with BFX. GDAX is just being strange, maybe just illiquid.
Are we going up or what?
So I started writing this post last night, but got distracted by the brief madness surrounding the $200 drop 1 min candle and scrapped it. Anyways, since we're still kickin on $9.8k's door, here's a little (LONG) write-up on its significance to where we stand in the "bear market" and some similarities I see to $11.8k.

As somewhat of a preface to this post, I'd like to say I'm a pretty strong believer in the significance ofhorizontal resistance/support levels and often place more importance on those than other market indicators. So, although the break of the log resistance line from the ATH is a somewhat substantial development towards moving out of the bear market - I'm not placing too much faith in it. This has been stated by others, but for 2 explicit reasons. One, it was going to be broken eventually and two, a similar scenario played out in 2014 - where the log resistance line was broken, yet this only amounted to a brief delay in the price dropping before ultimately continuing lower. 

Since the massive BGD from $6.8k to $8k, the price levels that I've had my eye on for this run have been $9.2k and $9.8k, as these have been notable levels of resistance that we've ran into before. $9.2k is rather insignificant for the time being, as the market has had no real issues pushing through that level of late. $9.8k, however, is proving to be rather tricky thus far and continues to validate its strength. 

You may remember, after our second failed test at $11.8k (in early March), the market quickly dropped to a low of $8.4k over 4 days. The market then made an attempt to push-up again (more of a DCB than anything) and failed at $9.8k. The failure at $9.8k last week and subsequent drop to the high $8ks marked the second time we've been stifled at this level and we're now on our third attempt (and it hasn't necessarily been smooth sailing thus far). The inability to push through $9.8k over the next few days would be very telling imo (as it could lead to another clear double top) and would greatly heighten the odds of a continued bear market for the foreseeable future. 

When looking at the similarities to $11.8k and the price action at that level, there's a few things that stick out. First, $11.8k was not simply a double top. Before our capitulation spike to $6k we consolidated around $11k for about a week. We then appeared to breakout, only to get caught up on $11.8k (on GDAX, reached higher on Bitfinex and others ~12k). 

I wrote about the $11.8k level a couple months ago actually on our first re-test on the bounce from $6k (and somewhat accurately predicted its eventual signficance), if you're interested: https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/7yt28a/daily_discussion_tuesday_february_20_2018/duk07h5/

Thus, $11.8k had acted as resistance prior to our re-test from $6k, somewhat like $9.8k has (although a rather different scenario), and before the evident double top. $9.8k is also now in a position to depict a clear double top (yet, like $11.8k could be interpreted as a triple top over a long time frame). Additionally, the double top at $11.8k came after an extended bullish run - ($6k -> $11.8k -> $9.3k -> $11.8k -> double top leading to large drop). Here, the market is once again in an extended bullish run - ($6.5k -> $9.8k -> $8.6k -> $9.8k -> ?). 

So what's the play? Well at the moment, the market appears to be consolidating nicely between $9.5k-$9.8k. This has me optimistic that we'll crack $9.8k, as it gives us the ability to recharge and initiate a serious push towards and potentially through this resistance level. At this point, there's no reason to go long until $9.8k cleanly breaks imo - just too much downside risk and we're right under resistance. There's plenty of thin air above $9.8k and *another* test of $11.8k would seem pretty likely as there's no real significant resistance levels until then (maybe high 10s, low 11s) and I'd expect the market to pick up some serious bullish momentum on a move through $10k. A short here isn't the worst play either from a R/R standpoint, with a stop above $9.8k, but this introduces the risk of a fakeout if you then planned to long. 

TL;DR $9.8k is a serious resistance level (that in a way mimics $11.8k) and has some very bullish/bearish implications at the moment. A move through $9.8k likely puts a test of $11.8k back on the table (the ultimate, de facto resistance), while a failure here would be a pretty clear signal that the bear is here to stay for the foreseeable future. 

Cheers fellas

Edit: just posted this and realized how long it is (holy hell lol), apologies

The spread between exchanges has narrowed quite a bit, shorter timeframe oscillators have been reset and the previous resistance of 9500 is holding as support. I think we will see a strong push to 10k over the weekend.

One of you who has way more free time than I should go back and analyze this to hold this guy accountable! :)
Funding rates have essentially put my short position at $9928. 3% higher than the entry...

But I got shafted on XBTM18. I'm glad I went 67% swaps 33% futures! 

Anyway.. No clue what the fuck is going on. 
All eyes are on the chart right now.... I can feel it. 
So I’ve been out of trade all day. I haven’t been able to take any confident long or short positions based on the charts. My bias is that we’ll move down further a bit before a potential attempt at 10k. 

Trend lines intersect at ~$9.4k and ~$9.2k and I think these would be good long entries with break even stops after the bounce as a conservative measure in the event price reverses.  Buys above 9.9k are likely to benefit from exuberant price movement above $10k into the $10.3k range. 

No trades. No stress. Sunny day in Paris. 
Would like another rush to about 10.3k and consolidate there for 2 weeks or so. 9.7k is much too hot, double-toppy, slightly below 10k, and everything.
Heads up, tradingview.com stopped updating btcusd and ethusd from bitfinex about 12 minutes ago.

LTC just rose a 4%, buying pressure is strong and i fell like some money from ETH ratio gain will come back to btc once we get really close to 10k or break it

Forgot to post that I closed my long from $9,040 last night at $9,650. 

Not sure what my next move will be.
Just for the record.

Nice candle about to close on the hourly above resistance and it seems some buyer have showed up to play... This could start the climb.

Expecting a significant pump after BitMex funding comes through in 52 minutes
I'm scaling into another long here. I see an equilibrium pattern, lower highs and higher lows on the hourly. 15m bands are tightening up and we're going to make the pop up or down soon. 


Flirting with the breakout: https://imgur.com/a/1a1urWT

*"Next ______ hours/minutes are critical for Bitcoin"* ^tm 

Is gdax trying to breakout? LTC brokeout on GDAX tho other alts r struggling. The last third of this minor rising wedge seems to be curving upwards. Imminent breakout or am I looking for things?
So, the bears say we are in a bear market because BTC had a +50% correction. What % rise puts us back in a bull market? It's up 53% from the bottom.
And if you look at a 1 year time frame, I just don't see how a 67% pullback on a 2100% gain = bear market. 
Just decided to hold open a long. Last time I was comfortable holding open a long, we dumped hard from 11.7k. The market is being so exuberant on such low volume, this feels how it felt like in May 2014 to me. This market is so seasonal, it's rediculous. I don't think you want to be on the wrong side once this cycle ends.

I'm guessing many of these coins begin topping out beginning of June at the latest.
Finally closed my 4+ month old position for a 15% gain, before the interest payments were just about to get way too hectic.

Happy I held on this long, and made some decent cash for all of the anguish I've gone thru hodling a leveraged position since January. Thank god for almost literally free money (highest rates I was paying was 0.009/day - as opposed to 0.12 now)

Waiting for money to get cheaper to look at getting into another 4-8 week long position.
The slow climb... this is eerie 

cont: who will initiate the fomo first? bears or bulls...
Looks like we broke up out of our bull pennant we have been forming all day 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/eWLotYB9/ 

Best of luck to people shorting. 

Welcome to the bull party, bitches. 
I think it's very probable that we consolidate in the 9.8k-9.5k range. Horizontal resistance at 8.6k and (probably) support at the resistance of the wedge: https://www.tradingview.com/x/Lxy363EA/


We did the same before breaking 9k : https://www.tradingview.com/x/PiYKFI0O/

EDIT: I plan to close my long around 10.6k (FIB 0.786 of the retrace from 11.8k to 6.4k).


I'm seeing a smaller pennant forming from between 9500 of yesterday and the high of 9875. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/XTdUJqTP/
Daily discussion comment counts here on r/bitcoinmarkets are certainly increasing.
Friggin' gorgeous equilibrium right now on the hourly. RSI is getting reset. Perfect condition for another move up to challenge 10000. Support is ~9515.

Stop losses at 9500 in case of fuckery. 

Edit: GDAX
My account is pretty new so I haven't been able to post my chart, but there is a hidden bullish divergence on the 2H. Not massive but definitely there.

Closed my short from 9750 at a minute profit because that was one hell of a bounce. Not fucking with buyers today
BTCUSD{LONGS,SHORTS} on tradingview seem to only capture Bitrfinex. Is it somehow possible to get a sense of the action on Bitmex too?
Anyone keeping an eye out on this?

https://www.tradingview.com/x/XwYXOJIL/

Seems to be playing out nicely 
high funding rate keeps increasing my liq. price on my hedge short to safer levels. Imminent breakout as overall funding situation doesn't allow too much sideway action..

!long XBTUSD 9620 5X 100%

Closed my long from 8900, that I held for a week last night when I thought the dump was imminent watching that long wick. Shitty R/R for a new position but degenerates gonna degenerate. 
So...I just realized it's very possible the reason for the large premium on futures is actually because people are trying to avoid longing on swaps. Or do we really think bitmex suddenly got bullish during this period of consolidation?? 

I mean June is almost on par with September...

It's slowly going to keep creeping up as long as funding rates suck for longs. Or until people are too hesitant to long at a huge premium 
I closed my long that was open earlier for ~3% gain. Given my entry and a few failed attempts at 9800, it is safer to close here than risk it going south.
With the long/short ratio at 1.5:1 currently, i'm a little hesitant to be super bullish in the short term. We need some real buying to fuel a big rise, because there aren't that many shorts to squeeze. 
No sell volume. The last few times we pumped $150 in the last 30 hrs the pump was stopped by sell orders to cool indicators down. We're just getting started, lots of room for RSI/MACD to run. Sell orders on 5m order flow are decreasing. Buckle up gentlemen we're going to crush 10,000 like most of the times we've crossed it.
This could go to $10k within 15 mins.  


will the nonfarm payroll coming up in the next 20mins or so affect the btc prices?
Macd now looking bullish on small timeframes.
Feels like bears are about to blow their load once this hanging man closes on the daily. 
was this a fat finger on finex?
I've been successfully only trading long positions since last year, including our recent bear months. (I'm only on GDAX) This may be a dumb question, but is shorting "easier" or "harder" than going long? For lack of better words, if I'm a good "long-er", would I have equal success with shorting as well?
!short XBT/USD 9672 1x 100%

A lot of 15m candle sticks with long wicks down, showing they are bought up fast. My nice ascending triangle still holding well on higher time frames , going long here on swaps 9627.

My spidey-senses are tingling.

What was once a near-impenetrable barrier, we've teased the lower $9,700's frequently the past few hours. Usually when this type of action happens, it signals that bears are losing their grip on both the market and reality.

Today's the day. $10k.

Edit: 3 more hours until I'm completely wrooonnnnnngggg.

So we just gonna keep poking the resistance on poo poo volume? ok den. 
That 150 green dildo when it was already in the thick of things.

We are one more sudden movement away from a true test of 10k. I give this tension 6 more hours before it breaks through or drops down to 9.5ish
BitMex whales pumping the price right before funding to make sure the poor sods who shorted at 6650 get rekt
I'm bullish medium (and even short, as in like next 7 days short) term, but I'm a bit surprised by the amount of people thinking we're gonna go up right now and stay up. The ratio of longs to shorts on Bitfinex is absolutely terrible. Gotta wonder how sustainable this move can be. 

Or is everyone just playing the, 'long and take profits $200 higher before the other suckers do' game here?
We all know what's coming next.

/u/ozone83 any idea what happens if that liquidation isn't sold into? How does the exchange handle the losses if the price never goes back down there again? 
What has happened in recent weeks every time the price has gone flat for a period of time? Hint: it's big and green.

Just woke up from my alarms. I wanted to long after a resistance break and did @9800 exactly. But I already closed @9850.

 Call me a chicken but this no volume stalling @resistance (well this should be resistance... I'm not sure whats going on anymore but this is not a usual breakout.) is exactly what happend last time around 11.8k. 

I can handle missing out on a 1% gain on our way to 10k but not another 5% out of nowhere red candle.

Definitely going to wait for the retrace to make a decision..
It seems to me that /u/justanotherlogin's bot is an invitation for people to stroke their ego with a bit of revisionist history. I'm all for the idea but there is certainly lots of precedent for certain users making wildly successful trade calls long after the fact (I won't name names, lest I get banned again for 'harassment'). Is there a way to enforce adherence to real time calls? Maybe dictate that entries fall within a range of the current index price? 

Also, is it possible to add an additional "notes" column for statements like "I'm gambling here", "No idea what I'm doing rn" and "Desperately need a winning trade soon so that I can buy lunch from subway"?

Also can someone w/ coins up the wazoo tip this guy for his hard work? (cough cough MikeXBT cough cough) (I guess I'll start by passing along the minuscule BTrash tips I've accumulated over time. I guess there won't be any tuna sub for me today!)

edit: seriously, who downvotes this and why? Have I really made *that many* enemies on this sub?
Did anyone here successfully withdraw fiat via wire transfer at Bitfinex? I see that option but never tried before. 
So did we break through the major resistance at $9.7k?!
WTF Bitmex? I wake up to find I've been stopped out because the price plummeted to 9.3k and back in one 15 min candle.

Got absolutely fucked because of the slippage too.
Closed my long. Will enter at 10100+- based on the 10k mental barrier, stop at 9900.

Either that or entering at 8900+-, reason being its a bit above last support level

Just holding on to my short from yesterday (small 5x from 9605) in hopes of collecting one more wave of funding before closing (unless there's a big move one way or the other soon).

Long with target of 10200, will probably be shorting over 10300 if it gets there on a fomo pump without consolidation below. If/when the price holds above 10300, 11.5 is the next target.
https://imgur.com/a/9YqmeoS

noticed a dump on ltc/btc(gdax) right around the same time btc got out of consolidation around the 12th of April. is the ltc/btc trade more profitable? is this where the cool kids hide their btc?
Typing up another one because this is not related to my post below but with the super high rates on Mex it's been pretty obvious what happens around funding time. Price gets suppressed because everyone wants in for the funding rates and then we pump immediately after. So I think in about 52 minutes, after funding, we'll start pumping again.

Edit: Nice. It seems like people were ready for the pop this time so there was enough liquidity to buy into. I think that was a mistake on the sellers part though as I see us going up from here. Finex has some good walls to 10k. It will probably be a slow climb for the rest of the day.
[I'm glad I changed my sentiment a few days ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8gelu0/daily_discussion_wednesday_may_02_2018/dybeegg/) I've been wanting to type this up since then but haven't had the chance. [Ever since we rejected our breakdown of the symmetrical triangel](https://i.imgur.com/Q53AUdt.png) I knew that this thing wasn't going down. It made sense though. The only reason why I wanted it to continue downwards was so I could get a long term entry in the mid 7's. It also would have helped us make a higher low and confirm our trajectory but that breakdown failure, to me, was also a confirmation, so I changed my sentiment and went long.


We are probably heading towards 11k before we start turning around and have a multi-day descent to actually make that higher low. I'm still wanting a trend line to make from 6.5k to see where we should be by the end of the year. The only other trend line I'm looking at is [this one](https://i.imgur.com/10jEAMQ.png) which isn't very steep and has us at 10k by EOY. If we ever do start crashing again for w/e reason I think that line will hold really well and would be a strong buy. But for now, let's just see how far the bulls can take us.
this little spurt is looking pretty dumpy, volume is meh with plenty of profit taking going on

will probably have to consolidate more

Long from 9450. Woke up to see that my part of my order got filled, I'm sure I had one at 9355 too which most likely would have got filled too but it's nowhere to be seen. Maybe I fell victim to BitMex overload when placing it but didn't realise. 

Seems like there were a lot of buyers ready for this dip and we're ascending nicely. Going to see how this one plays out, 10k could be breached today. Stop alarm set below 9200. 
Anyone else keeping an eye on this ascending triangle forming? Drew this on stamp so as not to change my standard chart (finex).

https://www.tradingview.com/x/ktHCeBCa/

We've got a shallow ascent that's started to intensify. I dropped the third steeper support line because I don't think it's sustainable unless we bust through in the next hour or two. 

Just something to keep an eye on in terms of targets and expected consolidation ranges.

I'll be using this to update when I make major buy/sell changes (fiat <-> crypto) but it won't be accurate as far as ROI since when I'm bought in I'm usually somewhat in alts. For instance, my BTC amount on paper is currently 50% higher than it was when I first bought back in fully at 7.2k. That said, the amount I have in alts and which alts can fluctuate until I truly decide to long term hold, so without tools for that I'll just be updating when I move portions to fiat. Positions will always be >50%; if I'm over 50% fiat I'll be "short" and anything over 50% crypto "long." Leverage will always be 1x, just know I'm accepting more risk/volatility than that by being in alts.

Considering moving to kraken but haven't done that as of yet.
I know a lot don't want to hear it but remember, it's pretty damn likely we aren't out of the bear market yet. So don't let emotion get the better of you here. 

We've been in this situation a fair old number of times, regardless of the big old trend line break.. there are still big obstacles before the bull market is back. 

Manage expectations in case we get one all mighty pullback in the coming days. 

For what it's worth i'm not bullish yet, over 12k and i'm certainly feeling it but right now nope
So was this '''breakout''' just caused by some OKEX short liquidation, and now everyone's sitting in the 800s wondering what to do? Boring.

BTC is hanging in there, but alts are selling off quite a bit...will probably drag BTC down before long.

Ugh it's literally washing whales doing their usual bullshit. Funny thing is, they leave such blatant traces of their manipulation, but no one cares to look for it. Damp has been prepared boys. Look at this ;)

This illiquid market is held up by washer walls which own too much of the distributed supply. Their orderbook liquidity is that which they pull before doing their big candles. Easy to bruteforce thru a pulled orderbook full with holes. Same as last month boys, we haven't hit the bottom yet, but we did hit top, this bearish market is still empty.
TA people, how low can we go right now?

I have targets of 9500-9450 but i'm a noob and I'm likely to be wrong, so don't even bother to pay any attention to my targets

!short BTC/USD 9755 5x 100%

Reasoning: Time to pull the trigger, I don't believe the bear is over. Tight stops on this, if it jumps over 10k I'll short again.
Whales have no reason to buy 800 BTC's in one go other than to break what is established to the shrimps as resistance levels. They can buy so much cheaper if they use bots and place 0.01btc orders. It goes same for breaking support levels.

That's just my theory. Don't listen to me :)

!short XBT/USD 9711 10x 40%

Too impatient
double top?
Daily volume is pitiful, is that concerning to anybody else. I don't know how bulls are supposed to break resistance. 

What is the best time frame for the Nishimoto cloud?  There seems to be huge differences with different time frames.  It would seem the more data would be in the longer time frames.

On Kraken, does it limit you from opening more of a leveraged position on a long than short?

Example: I wanted to open another position, It says I have 500$ of free margin available, but I cant open a position. When i try to open it, it says margin allowance exceeded. 

If you have per say .1 BTC on there, You could long .5 BTC with 5x margin correct? 
Why is 9700 so hard to stay over?
Just out of curiosity how far away do you set your stop and limit from each other when you are just long?  I know they are sometimes ran right through.  What you typically do and when you think the market is going violently in one direction or the other?  Thanks!

Interesting observation.

Total market cap (excluding Bitcoin). https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/ is about to hit the shoulder (@$310B) soon.
Are all conversations a copy when we were at 7K?
On the 2 hour it looks like an ascending triangle formation, which is bullish, right? But, I've been seeing bearish divergence popping up here and there, and a lot of talk of double topping....

This is probably the most stressful time in crypto I've experienced yet
Having missed the opportunity to enter a long around 8.8k on the dip day before yesterday (feel like kicking myself), I am now sitting on my hands trying to find the next safe entry. 

What do you guys suggest is a good opportunity to enter into a good r/r position? Does a fresh long on the next dip to 9.3-9.4k or a short on the next rejection at 9.8k makes sense?
Pretty strong candle close on the hourly, not nearly rejected as hard from 9.8k as I would expect for a double top. 

~~It's looking pretty okay, but~~ I'm expecting some tomfoolery....BTC might've made me too suspicious.

So ... has the bear market ended? Is this it? Never seeing sub 7k again? 
another attempt to break 9.8k, if it fails I see a pullback inevitable.

build up a nice short position here, hope we break down, otherwise my unrealized small profit would be gone, as I close at break even...

alts are declinging. hope this is an early indicator here, many might sell there alts for BTC which they exchange for Fiat = Btc selling pressure. 
I think mods should start a '[Daily] Alt Alt Discussion,' for those who think their coin of choice is the real deal and BTC is an alt. 

I've heard many voice this opinion and they don't currently have a space to express themselves.

edit: why am I being downvoted?
Another weak little morning dump... maybe they'll get it down to $9600, then it's up again.  Must be getting frustrating for these guys.

Ok guys I have my own specialized technical analysis that I am willing to share exclusively with this sub. It's a very under the radar esoteric method and I hope it can help some of you. 

My pepe mfi just gave me a signal that has confluence with tensor chart trading flow that my sensei taught me. i use this confluence to look at the klinger that is about to cross on a specific horizontal at $9038.4 which means btc will dump to exactly $8353.7 where the whale has been using his X10 algorithm with 37 dual modules that work fluently with my slack chat connected with 26 sensei's and 1 big whale that warns us before big moves. 

This means that the vwap will flick at exactly $50 below the $8353.7 stoprun and trigger another algorithm from a different player; batmanx1. batmanx1 will use his ultrafastppi to pump the market to exactly $8736.36 where he will hit one of my 1000 horizontals that i have drawn on the 58 minute chart that gives a 2 minute head start on 1 hour traders while pinpointing exact modular counts on different algorithms in the game.

In short, we are probably going up. 

!long XBT/USD 8992 3x 5.5%

Anyone knows how to deposit to zb.com? I do not see a deposit/payout button. Maybe it is possible only after verification?
was gonna say this. The guy should just hotlink a short, easy URL to a comment in an old daily. Or post a comment at the beginning of every daily that we can all respond to. Pretty simple solution
Whales like that. It's not like they don't have access to Internet and are only blue collar in a high rise building not taking into account any social media. Especially when I see people posting 10x 20x leverage with their stop loss included... I mean it's not like this market isn't overly manipulated, so let's make their life easier with some clear numbers :)
Yeah, and there's a bot recording everyone's positions and aggregating them into a new site. Sounds like a lot of fun to analyze positions, but I feel like all you guys are doing is offering yourselves up to whales on a silver platter. They'll countertrade you and liquidate everyone.

Should be more TA focused, which can include some vague positioning, but the "I'm long, full stack, $3M in contracts, 100x leverage" basically screams "LIQUIDATE ME!!!"
The previous rule was that you had to post your reasoning behind a trade...
we should have an aoutomodpost at the top where everyone post the trades.
Am I the only one that finds ,Position saved with success, a bit clunky? Shouldn’t it be ,Position saved successfully, or ,Position successfully saved,?

I used to walk past a strip club/brothel where the sign outside said ,Hot women for happy end,. It bothered me too.
Just an ongoing sticky thread would work (outside of the daily)

I think it'll pass. Now mostly people update their history by positions they're in, so there's no reasoning behind it.
This is awesome by the way, thanks for taking the time to set this up. 

You might want to add a column for exchange used, as the entries will vary significantly whether you are trading futures or spot. 

For example, someone longing Bitmex June futures now is doing so at $9,840 vs spot at $9,640. 
Let's say I was bored and had a lot of time on my hands. 

Could I start a new thread on /r/bitcoinmarkets specifically for backfilling old positions to get my historical data into this tool? 

Not saying I'm going to take the time to do that (although I probably would), but is your bot monitoring all of /r/bitcoinmarkets or just the daily?

Nice one. What would be handy is if the columns could be sorted by clicking on their headings. For example, sorting by open value would make it easier to interpret the relative distributions of longs and shorts in a given price range.
If you want to update positions with edits you could store the comment id with each position and as long as it hasn't been closed just parse all comments still attached to open positions to update at regular time intervals..?

I can't imagine it'd be that taxing for a while. and you could always just increase the time interval upon which it refreshes

Column sorting functionality,

i grew up watching the internet go from nothing to taking over our every day lives.  for me it was/is easy to see crypto will do the same thing as i've already whitenessed it and am already open to change.  for other people it isn't so easy. or i could be wrong, but every day that goes by makes me think i'm more right.

the frustrating thing is talking to family and close friends about it.  i want them to see the gainz too, but they're either too stubborn or don't want to take the risk.
I've been here since 2013 as well and you summarize my thoughts exactly. Hell knows what role in the world it's gonna end up having, but the notion of BTC not reaching ATH ever again is honestly ridiculous. We might see half of today's prices before that happen but I am, just like you, very confident at the moment and I'm in no way a hardcore holder without emotions.
I agree wholeheartedly.  A lot of money to be made on bitcoin long term. 
I started cryptos at the exact same time, 2013 end of year, and I have globally the same feeling. But as you said it's just a feeling.
Gimme a price target, megabull.
All i have to say to your big block of text is, how tf did you get 17 upvotes in 40 minutes????
make a new daily thread for bot trades
until then I think people should find a second level comment and just reply to that. Can even respond to themselves 
Can mods auto-hide the bot commands?
Just hide the confirmation comment at least. It kills the flow.
I can sticky a comment at the top of the next thread. Should be posting in a few minutes.
what is the /u/The_OPs_Mommy-ening prediction?
Everyone new, listen to this. This is gold. I only heard 3 things last year that stood out. A Yolotrade advice at $5k long that would have been a historic trade for me. I didn't listen. This is one of the other two things that resonated, followed and it increased my 2017 profits, bigly.

If you are new, read this multiple times.

Nice work sir. 
Are you still favoring your "MM's are riding Eth up to put gains into BTC before it pops" theory?  I quite liked that.
$11.8K is a long way away..not really a realistic "target", based on the current chart.
Volume is low lately. For a while now. Gdax is generally 8-12k of volume 
subtract OTC volume prolly
I keep watching it as a good sign of a bull run is new Money entering via the fiat exchanges for first time.  I also think people getting turned off coinbase a bit
I've said all week this looks strange: https://imgur.com/a/pCcKsZA

GDAX all the way down @ #15: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/#markets

Edit:

How does TRUE/BTC have $150MM+ in trailing 24H volume? I mean c'mon.... :|
Could it be due to the fact that the average masses are still bearish/sceptical? I mean gdax was having a super premium when aunt betsy and average joe (me) were fomoing in in november/december.
Imagine the btc market is a swimming pool.  There is a big group of teenagers at one end, splashing and making big waves (bitfinex).  At the other end is a fire hose, but it's submerged quietly under the surface (gdax).  The pool is about half full. No matter how much they splash, the teenagers will never fill the pool.
I feel like it should be breaking out by now. I thought $9800-9900 was the resistance o_O 
Good write!
Great write up. 

I 100% agree with you that the danger of $9,800 mirroring $11,700 is very real. There are a few important differences though between where the market is now and where it was then:

1. 3D MACD saw a bullish cross earlier in April and has been holding steady since. When the market collapsed from $11,700, 3D MACD was just beginning to cross up (and ultimately crossed back down immediately after the rejection).

2. Support at $6,000 was only tested once at $11,700. The subsequent bounce off $6,400 creates a stronger support base to push the market through $9,800 (and ultimately $11,700) this time.

3. The 3D MA has just seen a bullish cross. Whereas the 3D MA was still bearish during the $11,700 double top. 

In short, there's more underlying bullish strength to this move than there was to the previous trip to $11,700.

Of course, that will all be undone if the market collapses here or at $11,700 and the inverse will be true. 3D MACD will see a bearish cross, as will the 3D MA. *shudder* 
We have the 128 & 200 SMA cross at 10K(and it's printing a death cross as of today) which should provide some decent resistance considering how the 128 SMA supported the market so well on the way up and the 200 is so widely used. If you were to short I would put stops just above that. That's where I'll be closing my hedge and just holding spot with a stop(or maybe a 1x long with a stop that triggers a hedge/short) looking for around 11.7K to sell and maybe short opportunity.
Not really, i expect a dive below 8750 this Sunday.
Fuck ya, this is like the most helpful thing ever if I do decide to backfill my position history. 

Many thanks!

EDIT: Oh god, it goes back to 2015 when I had the absurd notion that the upward movement from $200 to $300 was potentially caused by a bearwhale masquerading as a bullwhale, whose ultimate goal was to buy up all the coinz in order to dump all the coinz. 

I was not a smart man in 2015.

Thanks, i'll look into it.

Since we are with this subject, [/u/_chewtoy_](/u/_chewtoy_), don't start commenting on old posts before i have some time to upgrade the site and do some tests. When you enter a close post it should close the last open position, so it should be fine and your current open position would be the last to be closed but i rather test i before.

The best way should be editing this CSV file and leave just the posts when you open or close the position. I have all the dates and links needed to link each position to the matching thread / post

You didn't open that long? :-\
Mine certainly are. The Bollinger Bands on the 1H are very tight. 

My guess is we'll all be wearing gold-plated diapers by morning.
> Buys above 9.9k are likely to benefit from exuberant price movement above $10k into the $10.3k range. 

This can't just be wrong, agreed 100%, only if it has the momentum to get it there.

> My bias is that we’ll move down further a bit before a potential attempt at 10k.

I also think the same to the extent that we'll move down further. However, I have different views regarding the target price range if it drops from here. 

We are at a critical stage in Bitcoin Market. I think this market has already seen its introduction, growth, and now being in maturity state (where we will evaluate it true price). This might be followed by the last stage, decline. 

This I think is the third time we are at almost 50% of all time high. We have struggled past two times and eventually fallen down. This time things looked different in a way. However, the time that we have spent in this $8,750 and $9,700 is alarming. And in no way it could be compared with $6,500 and $6,800 range.

For what reason? 

Why didn’t you set stops just below $9,450 or just take 50% of profits and let her ride 
Assuming you're not thinking we're done climbing, maybe set a limit buy with the profits you made at 9650 (maybe 9660)? Then you can continue the position on house money and just set stops just below support (9440ish IMO).

Excuse my ignorance, what funding? 
Somebody's watching TheChartGuys
The pop down will be massive.
so.. up or down as always?
You were absolutely right, breakout time is here.
BTC actually had a 70% correction from ATH. Bull/bear isn't decided by percentage retrace exactly. It's a combination of that along with time. 

Most traders that aren't spouting belligerent tribalism have been watching two things to confirm a bull market:

1) The downtrend log line from the ATH, which we have definitively broken  
2) A higher high since the last significant drop (11.8K to 6400)  

If we can break into the 12K+ range, almost everyone would consider that confirmation. We're halfway there, in more than one way. 
To be fair pullbacks can never be more than 100%, so this type of percentual comparison is a little ambiguous to say the least.

I'm not confident to make any statements regarding bear market or not, because as with many things, hindsight is 20/20, and it's too early to tell.

The current situation is that we're a little below 50% from ATH, and have been here for quite a bit. Short-term we seem to be trending up, but we still have a lot of barriers we need to pass. Instead of giving a particular price point at which a bull market is confirmed, I'm looking for continued green candles on the 3d/weekly. That doesn't mean there isnt opportunity here to make some profit.
Time will tell. In 2014, BTC fell 60% from peak (1100 to 400) through April, then it rose 60% from bottom (400 to 650) through June before stalling and resuming its slow decline to the 200's.
BTC timescale is in dog years and is rapid (by that logic a bear market cycle is *potentially* behind us indeed, but comparing current gains to last year isn't a good measure of saying a bear never happened)
Thats because you're assuming the worst is over.
So you also do assume the 2y, 2013/15, BM was not a bear market since we were up something like 10000% since inception in 2009?
These guys don't even know the definition of a bear market (two down quarters) so I wouldn't waste your time trying to dispel their delusion.
Bulls can see the finish line... they tiptoe gingerly forward... no bears in sight... could it really be this easy? Or will a stampede of bears jump out of nowhere
Waiting for the BGD to push us over 
Let's hope we get some real follow through here. Feels like the future is being decided right now.
I drew the support line a bit differently.

That's not a lot of wiggle room for fuckery. 

The $9,200 to $8,750 1m bitfinex candle is the level of fuckery you are up against.
Don't believe the orderbook on GDAX (or anywhere). That 100 BTC buy wall is a lie. Yesterday GDAX wicked to 9451 off of 9800. I can't blame you for using tight stops in this game, but you're begging to get wicked.
Good trade. Market absorbed a firehose of inexplicable sells today. Pretty much nowhere to go but up in the short term.
Guys is this some kind of cruel joke?  It looks as though most exchanges are dropping hard and fast.  Freaking out a bit over here
It's a lot bigger than that. Getting new highs on a divergence like this is bullish AF.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/Mie7b2TI/
Starting to look like a decent set-up for a move to 10k in my opinion.
Buyers seem thirsty today. 
Don't know if there is exact data, but you can atleast see it in their funding rates. Right now it's at 0.2%, so quite alot more open longs.
With the absolute buy pressure sub 9700, I’d bet this will break up something major
Damn. Good luck. This is aggressive even for my tastes. 

Market hasn't kicked it back down below $9,700 yet, but it's been 5 minutes. 
Pics can be faked too. When it comes down to it, if someone is going to lie about a position, then there's nothing to be done. I also don't think there's anything wrong with paper trading and posting those positions either.

There are users who chart, post analysis, feedback, and trades. A few weeks of following this sub will point users to them. If someone wants to lie on the internet to make it look like they're a good trader, then whatever. 

There's also been discussion on a few options to make it easier to identify phony positions.

this entire run started from a retarded short squeeze, I'm not sure if that's a great foundation 
looking at LTC, it has had a break up, could this be a sign for BTC aswell?
If its happening its happening now, we're starting to break out of the pennant i have drawn.

although i don't wanna jump the gun or fomo in anymore. I'm still holding my long.
Or could go to $8K but both are extremely unlikely in the next 15 min.   
Plot twist: its a bull trap and we will hit 9150$ soon.
Only for stocks and forex, BTC does not care about economic macro indicators.
what is a nonfarm payroll? why today?
177 BTC market sell yeah I guess so.
Sure wasn't a pinky

It all depends on which direction the trend is moving. 

In a bear market, shorting is "easier," insofar as your position is likely to be in profit *eventually*. If you shorted at any point between January and April, you had an opportunity to close it in profit.

The reverse is true for a long in a bull market. If you longed any point between bitcoin's inception and December 2017, you had an opportunity to close your long in profit. 

Since the genesis block, bitcoin has continued to make gains in the long term. There have been periods of decline obviously, but a long position has always been a winning trade *eventually*. Although somebody currently long from $19,000 might have a hard time agreeing with that statement.  
Shorting is much more difficult imho. 

It's far easier to spot local bottoms using indicators like RSI than it is finding local tops. Bull runs seem to be able to remain overbought far longer than dumps remain oversold.
I think as a general rule shorting is harder because you have to catch the bounce and FUD hits the market before the general day trading public so its harder to jump. Going long is just a waiting game especially in this market with multiple support levels. 
I short 1x, which is exactly the same as buying and selling.

Buy bottoms, sell tops
Technically they are no different. The way you personally look at the market is a factor which might cause issues. Ask yourself how well you timed when you closed your longs, right?
Turn your chart inverse, if it looks like it's about to bullishly breakout go short (because it's inverse).

you just gonna trade the 9600-9800 range or are you filled with hopium.  Though bullish, I still feel this is a trader's market.  People are loving the swings.



Not that I don't want to see it happen, but even if this pennant breaks up past $10k, it could take until late tomorrow night to play out.  I'm not hodling my breath. 
whilst I agree with you on that tingle thats usually a good sign that the top is in 
Why should it hit 10K ? 
Draw an even bigger one. 
Your hypothetical dream line became reality 
Could you explain this?
That’s what she said -Michael Scott 
My understanding of the weekend is volume usually decreases, so I feel like unless there are some big players battling it out to hit 10k over the weekend, we're probably going to stall out and drop back to 9500-9600 until next week.  Though I'd be very happy to hit 10k over the weekend, to start making headlines next week and bring in new money.
People who shorted 6650 already got rekt. 
I just opened a long at 9,650 with the sole intention of scalping these shenanigans.

My plan was to add to a position upon the breakup.  I just missed it, had fallen asleep. When I woke up just now to that green candle I was a little pissed that I missed it, but actually it was a good thing.
One solution would be to insert the price at the time of the post as the entry, rather than allowing users to inject their own entry price. 

EDIT: So if you shorted at $9,750 this morning but hopped in right now to post about it, you'd be short from $9,630 as far as the bot/community is concerned. 
I log the post datetime and i have a table that stores the average price (xbtusd) each minute so if something smells fishy i can investigate.
Since i allow for multiple pairs to be used, someone using futures or swaps (or what the hell those things are) that have significant price differences can be penalized without a reason.

I understand clearly your point of view, just can't think of an easy way to do this without doing more harm than good.
For now i think that if such cases appear (and they will), i'll just create a banned user list and disable the bot for them.
There's like 10 entries so far.  Let's not get ahead of ourselves on validity heuristics and first see if there is any traction.

Notes column is a good idea but maybe for now providing a link to a post is enough.  It's already overcomplicated enough to make an entry.

did the price on bitfinex go down to 9.3k?  Or is it a pure bitmex phenomenon.  Truth is 9600 to 9300 is like a 3% move it's not unheard of for bitcoin to fluctuate 3%



Good trade! Better to wait out and see what happens.
A wall like that is business as usual.  No idea what you are talking about about a link.
which exchange ? cryptowatch is very broken on some exchanges for orderbook (ie gdax)
Oh man, I'd throw in the towel on that one the second it turned green by 10 satoshis.
Banks don't hold much, if any, Bitcoin at this point.  If the market tanked, Bitcoin would do what it did yesterday because people would look for a better place to put their money.

It's a safe bet that we're going to see higher highs this month... and next month... and next year.

> For what it's worth i'm not bullish yet, over 12k and i'm certainly feeling it but right now nope

but what about the double top at 20K? Surely we must be worried about that. We can only be sure the bear market is over then... Why must being bullish/bearish be such binary things, and why do people say they will completely change if some magic number will be hit? People said it was over after log down break. Some people will now say bear market will be over at local high at 12K. Others will say we need to make a new high at 20k. Do people expect some sign which gives them certainty it is safe to enter at these prices and nothing can go wrong? Spoiler alert: things will never be safe (there is always a bull vs. bear case to be made): you could easily be buying a fakeout at 12.3k, if you want to wait till 13k for more confirmation things are probably overbought and will pullback, etc.. If you are unsure -- and we all are unsure -- why wait for some magic number like 12K to be hit, why don't you gradually scale in and out positions in light of changing market conditions. The last months we had our first run from 6k to 11.7k with almost 100% gains. Since 6.5k we are up 50% or something. These are just too much potential profits to miss. From a risk-management perspective it is also much safer to gradually scale in, then wait for some magic number to go all-in and stop being bearish.
You'll sit out a 100% move to buy one of the most likely reversal zones, what is this logic? How does buying 12k give more r/r than buying 6k?

There's plenty of 3k bears left with money to waste on shorting and apparently y'all give up at 12k.
I'd argue we never entered a bear market, we had a correction after a $20,000 raise over the period of just under a year. 
This sub is back to dec 2017 where every single bearish comment was downvoted to oblivion. Line of sight stops at 2017 and basically any post talking about the past is discarded with a this-time-is-different-ish like post. Not happy for this but lot of people will get burnt (again) in this kind of we-just-go-up mentality... upvote for you for what is worth.

In what world are we not out of the bear market?
By the time we hit 12k we will already be at 14k

Okay so whether or not you agree or disagree with this guy's conclusions, you have to admit that if you want to talk about market manipulation/whale theory this is the *exact* type of post to make. At the very least he's looked for evidence to try and support his view. Thanks for being the few people I've seen actually try to defend "but muh manipulation" with some actual data, even if it could be articulated a bit better.
The moment the gap opened on gdax I was a bit concerned. That said you need to clearly explain each graph in words here vs those screenshots.

For all I know you could be short and just salty... Explain yourself more in words. 
Don't forget the exchanges making fake trades to fake the volume and manipulate bots.
Buying and selling in itself is not manipulation though. They are doing what they want with their stack just like you do.
Bearish market? Uh... no. Sorry.

The rest of what you said is a little true. It's easy for whales to temporarily push the price in one direction or the other, but they can't move the market which wants to go up. There are millions of people around the world buying and selling little bits 24-7-365. They will decide which way it goes, ultimately. In January, they were freaking out and selling. They've been buying more since the low in February. We're up pretty substantially since then so calling it a bear market is just flat-out wrong at this point.
That crazy candle on bitfinex on the 28th: was that whale washing, or something else?
The market is still rangebound between $8,600 and $9,800. 

While it certainly appears that it's preparing to break out of that range to the upside, a drop to $8,600 is still a possibility. 

Getting too caught up on movement within that range is a recipe for getting chopped up in the short-to-medium term.

EDIT: The closer to the top of that range the market sits, the riskier it is to open a long. The closer to the bottom, the riskier it is to open a short. 

Either wait until the market revisits $8,600 - $8,800 and long the bounce (if there is one), or wait until the market breaks $9,800 with conviction to open a long. Alternatively, short right here and now with stops above $10,000 or short the breakdown of $8,600.

EDIT: Just to clarify, I'm not recommending a short. I think shorting at all right now is just too risky. However, if you were hellbent on entering a short, then my suggestions above are the way to do so while minimizing risk.
I think I saw a pennant with 9600 as support earlier.
Depends on what ETH does considering it's been leading things.
What is TA?
9500 would be a tasty entry point for a long.  Going short for a quick scalp also might work right at this moment.  Someone's hellbent on giving us a discount today, it seems, but I still think we might see some big covering at some point today.  OTC contracts tend to come due on Friday at market close.
Well technically speaking anything above $0 is fair game.

Most probable though is: 9600 as bottom of pennant/ 9550 as previous low/ 9500 support turned resistance.

as I'm finishing up my comment it's already bouncing, sooo, not very low i guess.
Essentially we can dump forever.

But $9,600 has been showing decent support. Next stop would be $9,450 
Any lower than that and we might not come back up. We could only end up going as low as 9.6 - we'll find out momentarily it looks like.
9540 is the closest point that's been retested.
9250 has support. 
9450-9550 would be my low target long entry. Below 9400 I don't think I'd want to be entering long any more. If I weren't in position, I'd probably be looking at 50% at 9560, 50% at 9460, and stops at 9360.

What about liquidations and covering?
Sometimes they have another reason, but most of the time, it is to manipulate the market price.  To lose money on that trade, but push the price to a certain level that will lead to greater profits for them in the future....or on a different futures position, etc.

And of course there are corrupt exchanges that do stop hunting and such.   

But it's not just your theory...it is accepted fact for anyone with a brain who pays attention.
Whats with the downvotes?

If it falls back to 8.7k it would be a confirmed double top. Could just as easily be an giant ascending triangle if it finds support around 9k.

This is actually indicative of Kraken's margin pool being empty. If the issue was on your end, you would see a message like:

> Insufficient margin
You can get the message if their margin pool runs out - as in, they have no more $ to lend you to long BTC. 
Ya the lending limits are different for USD (long) than for BTC (short) and they are kind of out of whack. Solution is to get a higher level of verification 
I can answer this question with both a bullish and a bearish bias:

**Bearish:** Sellers are shorting the moment buyers poke their heads above $9,700 because there's a huge drop coming and they want to load up while they still can

**Bullish:** Buyers are trying to accumulate as many coins as they possibly can between $9,500 and $9,700 before they bust through $9,800. So once the market breaks above $9,700, they ease off the gas.

Both are pretty much equally plausible at this stage.

I don't see this going down, considering closing my short from 9820 last night. So greedy not taking small profits for the third time.

Buyers eating every little sell-off, higher lows and bears nowhere to be seen. 
Doesn't feel natural to me to ignore wick on that potential left shoulder, which then pretty much invalidates h&s. Would rather label this as 'natural' equilibrium.
I'm pretty new to TA but that doesn't seem a H&S, even if it was a iH&S it had to be on a low to work as reversal.

no
I wouldn't stress too much about the double top yet. It's only really confirmed if it breaks the neckline which is around $8,700.

We'd need to see a pretty substantial retrace from here, blowing through a few support zones. If we drop through $9,200 I'd start giving it some clout. 
I'm expecting a retest of resistance turned support at 9.35k, but am unsure of we'll get there is this grinds much higher.

Depending on the scenario, I'd say keep an eye on 9.5k 

otherwise just keep waiting it out until a dip.
If it goes down then entry on a bounce 9.3-9.5, if goes up then entry on the way up before 9.9 or after it bounces above 10k.
making a lower low wouldn't be very bullish, so i dont think i would enter a new long there. i think your best option right now is to short resistance or wait for a confirmed breakout then long resistance turned support
Just Buy and wait 6 months... then is doubled. 

Easy!!?
This time around has this weird alt pump/dump dynamic happening concurrently. Not sure what to make of that, but if I were to pick a side I'd gauge that its a bearish indicator. It seems to me that a healthy contraction for Bitcoin would entail parallel moves for the alts, if not just a total collapse for some of them. Instead, the repeated pattern of wild fluctuations relative to BTC that we keep seeing makes me think that this whole space needs more of a wake up call than its had so far. There's just simply not a reason for many of these coins to have any substantial value, let alone flirt with very significant market caps and ratios. It's odd and unsettling, so I'd learn towards more downside but recent price action is certainly making me question.
Here's a better question: Why do you think this time will be the same?
Hopefully $18,500 so I can start making a profit.
We don't know yet. 
Just wait for the recession...
Agreed, but the fact that mini dump was instantly bought back up over 9.7k says to me that bulls don't want to quit. 
I just can't shake how similar it looks to sub $7k.

longs increasing with price not moving up, strong resistance at a critical juncture, lots of sideways...like  week's worth, overly bullish moon boys calling for ATHs, etc

Most of the people ecstatic here are alt moon boys and newbs (sorry guys but I just gotta be honest about it. Most of the more experienced traders/early adopters seem to be completely absent lately), I don't see a bunch of the smart people from 2017 coming back and saying "this is it! we're back in the running boys!"

it's the same thing in reverse. 

I want to short this really hard so fucking bad but I'm sitting on my hands. when it's hard to pull the trigger like this is usually when it's the most profitable. Then again  that could be true of a long -_-
Nothing is inevitable in this space 
Stop shitposting, please.
Longs are extremely high compared to shorts tho. Looks a bit worrisome. 
Alts fell a lot yesterday/overnight, but have recently started to recover back in ratio. I think if they were going to have a large impact on BTC on that drop it would have already happened.
I'm about 90% alts spread out between top 10, top 20 and small caps and even at the lowest I only lost 4% BTC value and already recovering. To be honest I think BTC and ALT are SLOWLY decoupling and every alt dump comes back with a higher pump. I think all the alt bagholders from Dec on have slowly changed the BTC vs ALT game and it's not going anywhere. If they didn't sell in March, they sure are not going to sell now.

Yeah if your position size is significant I think posting your stops to an easily scrape-able website falls into the category of Bad Idea.

I've already thought on a couple occasions that I was stop hunted, probably by the exchange, in some thinly traded alts I was holding. I don't need to add to my paranoia.
Well Mike already did that and he was fine. 
there is no need in posting the SL.
It only makes sense to specifically hunt the biggest positions in $ and only the % of stack is given by the bot. And those who submit big positions would also submit it in the thread so not much of a change (and don't use high leverage).
Hey, that was my post!
That’s kinda what I was thinking would be best. That way everyone stays in the daily, while still able to quickly access/see the positions/trades if interested. 
I think this is the best idea so far. I assume you're talking about the same type of post as the "New Post available" post that is made to close out each day. Each trade is posted in this sticky-post, and those interested can simply expand the post to see the "comments."
It should be "position saved successfully" for the least clunky phrasing.

!long XBTUSD -sl 9380

Users can check my post history to see I've been talking about this long for a while. Was 5x at 9115 originally. Added to 7x last night and 8x this morning.

Thanks for this project! It's pretty cool, and a great way to check current positions of common traders on here.

I could not believe how much it got sold into. Maybe a wash trade from somewhere that was trying to play the premium??

I also didn't see the "yellow/orange" color indicating a margin call, and havent in a while so not sure if they still do that. I trade there every day, but haven't seen it since the UI update.
Only exchange insiders and true whales who are connected to exchange insiders really know any specifics about premeditated market-shifting moves. It's all speculation here in the cheap seats, with a healthy dose of tinfoil and inexperience.
Yes. 100% what I'm saying. To be absolutely clear, while brand recognition is a huge component of my  bullishness on bitcoin, I'm not all in on btc or eth, just crypto in general.

 Anyone who hasn't read Antifragile by Nassim Taleb should do it asap. While it's not about crypto at all, philosophically it covers why you should diversify: I know decentralization and disintermediation of financial middlemen is completely game changing. I know this is the future. I *don't* know that Bitcoin is that future. I think it's *likely* to be the future, but I'm not certain. Therefore, it's wise to spread my investments across all projects I believe in (or at least ones that I think the general public could believe in) given that I can win by betting just a fraction of my overall capital on a coin that does eventually yield 10,000% returns.

Well Eth ratio topped out this morning and trending down all day.... its almost like they know something is about to happen =)
Yes, that's what I've noticed. To clarify, I'm wondering if btc volume on Binance, Kraken, Bitfinex, et al is also just a fraction of what it used to be... or is it simply that gdax is dying.
OKEX volume is known to be fake

It feels like neither side knows quite what to do.
Damn I was about to complain about you using 128 (pretty random time frame) but then I looked and wow it's been a pretty good MA to watch. Bounced off of it in January correction, then basically only wicked below it in March, then bounced off of it pretty perfectly in July, September, and our first trip to 9k post ATH.

On the flip we didn't really seem to care much about ghosting around it on the trips back to 11.8k, though the low 11ks on the way back down from the final 11.8k DCB had pretty high volume in the vicinity of the line. And I still think it's a pretty random MA to choose.
What do you see that indicates a big drop coming? I'm definitely open to hearing bearish analysis but it seems like we rejected 8800 earlier in the week and now we are good to go up. 
Okay but what's the reason why
[deleted]
Quick question(s): ( hijacking your comment since most users will see your posts rather than mine :) )

I am calculating PnL like this: 

* (OpenValue - CurrentValue) / CurrentValue  - 0.0025 (to simulate fees) but this only gives the PnL of the position regardless of stack % or leverage.
Would it be better to multiply by the leverage and by the stack % so that it would give the PnL of the full stack?

Or have both values at the same time?

What % should i use for fees? Kraken is almost 0.5%, i have no idea what's is the average on other exchanges.
> But damn celebrity worship is cringy

Meh, it is what it is.

There is for sure at least two fuckers from Goldman that lurk the dailies and I know for a fact many more from various prop/flow desks that're involved now. All of these cats could squash anybody here with their stacks, so don't get too caught up in the whole eCelebrity Crypto Trader thing.

Edit:

And just for clarification, I mine ***everybody's*** comments (for a separate purpose), not just Chewy's. 


I really don't get this run up. Doesn't make much sense. Seems like traders trading. I would love for BTC to moon but it just doesn't really make any sense right now. 
From where? No lol. I already told you this.

I'm fine accumulating funding for this, it's quite nice. I  should've closed my futures position at breakeven earlier, it was there for a bit. 

Plus I really don't know if this is going to pass $9900. $9875 should have been a breakout. 
I’m not sure I agree.  BTC is meant to be sound money. We’re not even close to a maturity state. It could still fail (price to zero) but if it wins it goes to a million per coin. I don’t say this hoping to get rich; I’m fine as I am. But I understand the starting principles of the project. We’re closer than we’ve ever been to finding out of this experiment really takes.
Nah... from California. Lived 10 years in SF working in tech and then got sick of it and left. I spent 2 years alone in the Russian River and got into running and meditation.  After this I spent a 3 year stint living all over the world in 2 week intervals which was really good for my mental health. 

I finally landed in Paris because it’s beautiful and they (France) grants US citizens a 1 year visitor’s Visa so I don’t have try and rope a Euro woman into marriage just to stay ;)
It's being updated now again. It just means that people depending on tradingview.com to show them the short-term price movements are getting incorrect information. They were looking at charts that didn't show any movement at all for about ~20 minutes. Most likely due to technical glitch somewhere.
you can view charts of lots of different exchanges on tradingview.com. for some reason, it's not updating for bitfinex. at least on the btcusd and ethusd pairs
Honestly, it was a relatively large position and I didn't want to sleep with it open/risk a wick down in the middle of the night. If I could watch the charts 24/7, I would have left it open.
Nice job on the web page. I have one possible suggestion for ease of determining longs/shorts... perhaps consider either background shading the entire "row" a green shade form long, and background shading red for short.... or using green/red text on appropriate lines, or some other visual way to determine?
:')
Lmao. 
That's what the T stands for in USDT, they'll just print more.

Yeah, well, I do.
Bitmex volume is now the largest in the entire market. Movements in futures effect the spot price as people will defend their positions & adjust risk on other platforms.

BitMex swaps
It will be massive if it pops down. But I've learned to hard way too many times that the trend is your friend, right now it seems to generally be up. Most would say we need to consolidate for another leg up, but this is bitcoin and it don't give a shit most of the time.
Cool.  I've been sitting on fiat for a couple weeks hoping for one of those.  The market seems to be slurping it up nicely when someone turns on the sell faucet.  Not sure why you would expect anything different with no bad news on the horizon.

As an aside, I don't mean to criticize you because I'm sure you're a really cool guy IRL, but FYI when you say stuff like this, it comes across like a kid saying, "My daddy has a kazillion bitcoinz, and he's gonna dump 'em all and beat your daddy up! Just you watch!"  
Well obviously, he is saying it is forming an equilibrium where supply and demand come to equal each other. This makes it so there is a 50/50 on direction on the break. So you can set a short if it breaks below equilibrium or a long if it breaks above.
I always consider the 50 SMA as my Buy/Sell line on any time frame. Right now the Monthly. Weekly & Daily price of BTC is above the 50 SMA so for me all these time frames are bullish. I do like to see the 50 Day SMA flatten out and start rising which it now is.

Gox.

It is.  Any dumps now are just giving away free money.
Potentially *any* movement could be considered a bull or bear market; it all depends on your time frame. For most people bull/bear applies to trends that are clearly apparent on daily charts, but there's no universal definition.
yes but stock exchange are generally open from 9 to 5 but crypto is 24/7, so it moves at least 3 times faster. Two quarters in the stock market would then be 43 days in crypto.

Also, you should try to be less condescending. 
1 day in crypto = 1 week in stocks so make sure you're converting units correctly
a wild bear appears...
More like bulls gore the silly bears every time they try to attack.  We're out of the woods.  Here in the meadow, bears get gored.  Trade accordingly.

Seriously, though, the only thing preventing this from going up faster is that the big bulls are very patient and smart, waiting for the dumpers to sell into them rather than pumping the price up.  The bulls are definitely playing a smarter game right now.
I truly believe we are. We are flirting with 9.9k hard 
Yeah mine wasn't a very strong one just small uptrend. already got violated so it's gone.
True, it's not. But it would indicate a new lower low and the stop loss would put me at a small profit (bought at 9135). At that point, it's fair to expect the downward movement to continue, where I would (hopefully) reload on more BTC.
As long as the market remains below $9,800, there's the possibility of a double top at $9,800.

There's no strong support between $8,800 and $9,800, as the market has seen both strong buying and selling pressure throughout that entire span over the last 10 days or so. 

Since we're at the top of the range, I'd expect more sellers to see this as "the last chance to short in the upper $9,000s before the bear market resumes" than buyers to see this as "the last chance to buy in the upper $9,000s before $10,000+"

So it's dangerous territory to be holding a long from anywhere in the $9,000s, and arguably suicidal to be opening a fresh long here.
Deep breath: https://www.tradingview.com/x/7MtQyWZH/
RSI is no longer overbought on *any* timeframe from 15m-1W. 9550 channel support held (so far) and we're bullflagging into a falling wedge. If ever the pieces were there....
I was looking at the higher highs on price, with the lower highs on RSI peaks - that is bearish divergence if I'm not mistaken.

However, the higher-low on price, with the lower-low on RSI is hidden bullish divergence. So, we have a mixed bag as I see it.
I'm confused, bullish divergence *and* hidden bullish divergence? Edit: as if that's even possible, I need to review some basics. 
The last pennant we had in the $9,100-9200 range broke up pretty aggressively.

Whoa, just saw. That might be consumer buying.
The ratio isn't really that high though, relatively speaking. I consider LTC to mostly have ranged .018 - .022 in recent times. It it were pushing .022 that would make for a more compelling case, I think.

Most traders on this sub only know the bull market, because they've never seen a protracted bear market. Even the multi-month decline we've seen is really just a medium-term trend. 
Not to mention that shorting profits are limited, while longing is unlimited in theory. 
Also you are paying to borrow whatever you short.  So you have to make that up too.  
So why call it shorting?  Is it just that you're more comfortable using trading terminology?

JEEEEEBUSS that's a giant position.
Thanks for telling me.
This would be bad. Sometimes slippage could be big. If I'd post now I would be long from 9.6 which is way off.
Yeah that's a decent idea. Either way, holding people to an accurate accounting based on the time is imperative imo. Otherwise it's just a shit show of "look how amazing and rich I am".

Step 1: Post fake trades and become one of the top performers on /r/bitcoinmarkets

Step 2: Weed through comments in the daily and target new posters with limited grasp of the market 

Step 3: Direct Message those posters and offer to trade on their behalf if they send you bitcoin in exchange for a percentage of the gains you produce for them. 

Step 4: Profit

You might not even need to do step 3, as people would most likely be propositioning you with that offer rather than you needing to seek them out.
Well if there's an opportunity to hold them to better account, why not? Yeah, I have a good understanding (I think) about who is reputable and who is disreputable, but not everyone pays that close attention and knows everybody by name. Just a suggestion for making the system work as well as possible. 
Yeah that's a good idea.
Yeah I've also made such a scene previously regarding users falsifying data and spreading fake TA (plus leveled a lot of ridicule and criticism towards shitcoins). I've certainly made my fair share of enemies on here and a handful of people absolutely hate me.

At least I got in at 8.9 and still closed in profit I guess. No idea what to do now, probably best that I just stay out of position until I'm no longer tilted by this ~~bug~~ feature.
Bitmex only. It dropped from 9740 to 9350 and bounced back up to 9500 in one 5 minute candle. Finex didn't even drop to 9500.

Definitely don't listen to me. I'm a terrible trader. I had closed a long in profit and thought there might be some pullback or a full breakdown based on the fact that the daily closed at 8:00 pm EDT as a 'hanging man' candle (small body at the top, relatively long wick down and little/no wick at the top), the fact that we're flirting with a double top situation (previous top was several days ago around 9.7/9.8) and I think this market is not necessarily ready to recover from the downside we've seen in the past few months (also the behavior of alts is concerning [they just keep pumping and dumping], which makes me bearish overall). There are many reasons to be bullish though, I think right now it's a coin toss, probably not the best time to enter a trade in either direction (although there's almost never a perfect time, always somewhat of a gamble). If you're a noon, don't listen to me, don't trade more than a contract or two at a time to get started and watch and learn from those who provide routine TA updates that are reputable). 

Good luck.
Think he was expecting end of day shenanigans + saw that btc market sell 
The intensified support line has support around 9350, which would also be bad IMO. I could see something like this happening though: 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/vs6Ecfx8/
I think he's implying it's October again.
the horizontal is my target if it rejects right here, which it will. These are fib channels, we're rejecting as we speak, and are gonna roll over to the fib lower than last bottom.
every bear and bull has had a great opportunity to make a lot of money. We literally went from $12k to $6k to $12k to $6k and are on our way back to $12k.

Sure you could really try to get all of the movement- but just being solely bearish or bullish has been rewarding in its own right.

I don't think there's much wrong with watching out for $12k carefully. Of course it won't be free money but there will likely be a large breakout past $12k if we do manage to get past it
because you can't buy at $6k right now? unless you're offering...
It's a fair point. You zoom out enough and keep in perspective the magnitude of last years growth, the past few months don't look so bad.
Just a month ago this comment would be downvoted to hell. Interesting to see how the general sentiment is that accurate of a counter-indicator.

By the way I agree with u/Richyboy33. Until proven otherwise we're still watching a bubble in the process of violently popping.
just arguing semantics...majority of people call a 70%correction a bear market 
[deleted]
we've been here before and dropped back to 6k
In what world were we ever in a bear market? A two-month correction is not a bear market.  Zoom out.  There was never a bear market, just another "crash" off an ATH.  It's happened a hundred times.  
Maybe...wouldn't be the first time, but crypto usually moves up and down together.

Where are the posts claiming that gravity is why things fall if you drop them???  I want to see charts and graphs or I don't believe it.
You're right. But the purpose of my post was to give a quick and direct trace of the ones driving this market. And you can extrapolate their intentions, simply from comparing and combining order-flow data, charts, volume, margin positions, bitmex fundingrate, mark price exchanges, futs, quarterlies, and all that jazz. The changing configuration of all these variables will show you the direction they are preparing to move the liquidity too. Agnostic for bear or bull, they are always on both sides of the orderbook, and dont care about corn-price, only care about return on liquidity and on spreads. Based on this current configuration, they are calling top here. This is the same way I shorted 11.9 june futs double top, by cxombining these patterns, find them in action, and joining them at the top. 

Their algo's are stronger, their washing patterns and rhythm is more aesthetic, fully in control, they got deeper pockets than other players. And that means this market is still in decline. There is no dynamic action distorting the architects, or interrupting. 
There is merely a trend of drying up spot liquidity, and a consistent decline of volume since december. https://www.tradingview.com/x/dyuKvZio/  ( also visible on monthly, with april being the weakest month of 2018 volumewise: https://www.tradingview.com/x/4NxzwRsI/) 
 And sadly, bearmeme is not over yet. it's still not time for 10k https://www.tradingview.com/x/vZ6RMKP9/ 


yes just say no based upon the assumptions that they are just not doing it. Strong argument. Meanwhile their signs are all over the data.  
Washing liquidity can be corroborated so easily by using multiple sources as orderbook, last trades, charts, volume, margin position changes etc. there are moments where the market is more random, but this special type of manipulation only happens before bigger swings such as reversals. I've seen this play out so many times by now. an you can watch it too if you care to look for it, instead of just assuming the opposite.
Oh i even posted it here, but got lost in the crowd. "https://www.tradingview.com/x/eLnsCyJj/ Wipe-out candle to shake-up liquditiy, happened by pulling liquidity of orderbook and market selling 2x700 btc. Then market closing it in one time."

Thanks Chew! Appreciate it
Technical Analysis
Is short covering more likely than a long unwinding given the funding rates right now? I don't really know much about either so curious to hear more about how one would gauge the likelihood of either scenario.
That is more like the aftereffect of the mass orders, isn't it? I'm seeing a general trend where price rises to just below the resistance level and suddenly hundreds of BTC get bought at market price
Thanks for the reply! I forgot about futures / margin trading :)
>But it's not just your theory...it is accepted fact for anyone with a brain who pays attention.

Fact?

/r/conspiratard 
It's a user / bot hybrid. The guy didn't even bother getting a separate reddit account for the bot. He's probably hosting the script on his desktop, as well.
Could be fine or an incorrect rating, but just wanted to give a heads up as it looked pretty spammy / suspicious + red ring of death.
Stop hunters know where the stops are likely to be. They don't need to troll /r/bitcoinmarkets to decipher that.

Previous areas of resistance/support are common locations for stop orders. $9,200, $9,000, and $8,800, for example. 

People also change their minds on the fly or their stops aren't precisely where they claimed they were. For example, somebody trying to stop hunt /u/MikeXBT 's short from $8,700 the other day at $9,400 would have been sorely disappointed. His commentary suggested his stops were set just above $9,400, but he either cancelled them and set them higher or they were higher than his commentary suggested. 
Because a dozen people posting positions of unknown dollar amounts, some long, some short, on a subreddit, will direct market movers where to squeeze. I guess they'll find this long before BTCSHORTS and BTCLONGS.
I don't think that a few open positions will cause market makers to invest the time to hunt here. Even so, a lot of  users are posting their stops in the comments anyway. Doing that is not new. Now there is just a website that filters out the posts without positions

WhatWhatWhat!?!?  What is this?  This is cool!  When did we get this!?
We're not exactly bouncing off the top in a hurry so doesn't look like it'll play out - so that 's good if you're long
strange chart. I do not see 10K+?
I'm out of position right now ready to make a move if need be.
Volume is not significantly lower than when we broke out of the previous symmetrical triangle and made a bullflag between 9k and 8.5k. It think there is less volume because there are less sellers but everything below 8.6k is gobbled up real fast. 
I believe I read that on their website, so essentially their margin pool is all dried up? 
OMFG this has been driving me crazy all morning. I assumed I was just doing it wrong.
oooooh so that's why
I sent over more BTC to Kraken with intentions of me being able to add to position, I was literally only able to add an extra .01 to my position which is actually nothing. 

Yet, I dont want to submit my personal info to them for Tier 3 verification 
It's also plausible or maybe more, both powers are at work causing this stale mate.
And from what I noticed, there are more sellers than there are buyers right now.
I don't know why you're getting downvotes, that's a legitimate position. I actually think we've been in a long correction in an underlying bull market, but I'm sympathetic to bear views.
I set a market stop behind a limit stop. 

The limit order rarely gets filled.
Bitmex is open 24 hours a day
Nah, casinos don't lend you money so you can lose your own quicker ;)
I hadn't considered that it would need to be on a low, that's interesting. It may be a foregone conclusion at this point. The market seems ready for another move up after last night's consolidation. 
OK thanks I'm not trading any of this but I'm definitely trying to learn so I appreciate the input
Bought in Nov. What happened?!??!
Crypto is a game. Just like the stocks.  Its what people believe. As long as their is money to be made people will come and there will be losers. But the attraction of fast gains will keep people coming.  It can become addicting
Like the answer-with-a-question reply.
Here is a better question to your question: 

Why the 20k bubble burst acting like any other bubble?
But for real tho... I’ve been sitting in out since 6k. Fuck sake 
Nope, no smart people here, just us dumbasses. 
> when it's hard to pull the trigger like this is usually when it's the most profitable.

This so much. It's always because we are just an inch away from resistance before we begin to free fall. Sometimes we even peak above by 40$. Also BTC rarely double tops afaik. But this could be an insanely profitable short. Especially since alts have gone 2-3x in a month already.




I'm still in a short from yesterday, 3x. I'm underwater (mildly) but not concerned exactly for the reasons you articulated. Even though all signs are pointing to a breakout I'm just not seeing us not retracing at this point. Reluctantly bearish.
[deleted]
If you are on the sidelines a short seems almost blatantly to be the reasonable choice.




I didn't know smart people could see into the future.
it's a trader's market and we're in a bullish trend.. its not going to be 2017 where you just hodl and count your money all day, lol..

The reason you see no smart people saying we are back in the running is because we are all waiting to buy in below 4k.
Where can I view this?
Historically it isn't that bad. I've seen longs to shorts at 35k/15k and we were still going up. Given that was last year during our bull run but given our current momentum and low funding rates we should *not* have a long *or* short squeeze.
Damn, 90% alts? Even in my alt craze days, I never dipped under 50% BTC. Yeesh.
No, you're misunderstanding. That discussion is for people who think that BTC is the de-facto standard and that their coin is an 'alt'. I'm talking about a thread for people to discuss Bitcoin, without implicitly ceding the point that Bitcoin is the so-called anti-Alt, the crpyto standard-bearer. 

We should try to be as inclusive as possible. It's 2018.
I was crushed with downvotes. Some people...
Great point! Maybe I'll name it /r/ItsCalledAJoke.

Please God we need a bot that auto-replys with this. 
Why so angry? You shouldn't be scalp trading. Margins are 100% manipulated.
it sure seems like the action is back though

By real I mean "meaningful" if their volume is 0 from their monthly storage fee's existing. It having ln doesn't mean much to my internal timeline of bitcoin taking over the world.

my turboencabulator needs a recharge
Keeps capital free for other trades?  For example, half of my stack is tied up in LTC futures right now, maybe this guy has 90%+ tied up somewhere else?

Or it could just be not wanting to expose 15% of his stack (I know this can be managed with smart stops and such though)
I can't borrow fiat or coins from the exchange at 1x. Has to be 2x or more. I'm not trading millions, the lending costs don't add up to much. I prefer to just keep my buy and hold stack separate and swing trade with borrowed funds off the exchange.
that way you can pay lending fees, and show how boss you are, duh
Friendly suggestion: have the bot PM users confirmation of their entry/exit being logged, instead of clutter the daily thread with these.

Otherwise, pretty neat; fun project for sure could go many ways.
februari was entirely in their supervision. Three-week bulltrap is actually a good chart timeframe for a proper bulltrap.
Bullishness will attract new entrants, big boys waiting to get in on the first sign of bullish trend. These boys are beyond BTC players level, strong quants who can't even join btc market for now due to weak trading infrastructure. This is probably a strategy from the current incumbants. keep barriers of entry's higher due to bottlenecks like that. Assymetric warfare m8. Bitmex probably is supposed to overload, so sophisticated trading algo's are impossible to introduce, and current leaders remain in dominance.
I feel we should have automoderator delete any H&S or IH&S post automatically. It's a meme at this point.

Typing on my phone, don’t know how to do ,quotation marks,.At least I was consistent throughout, got to give me that. 
I will say though, however, that adding an exchange is going to confuse the hell out of people no matter how you slice it, because Futures is super confusing for people who aren't familiar with it.

The reason I always reference spot when I open and close the position, is because the alternative is to explain Futures Trading to a half-dozen people everyday.

Because if I open the position now and said short from $9,820, there will inevitably be a few people asking, "how is that possible? Spot never broke $9,800."

Well I was suggesting more that you manually check if the position is open. Just a sweep of every open position to check every comment it's attached to.

I used the reddit python api a while back and remember there wasn't an edited comment stream, only a "hose" they called it for all comments. So you can get new comments from bitcoinmarkets easily but getting edited ones is impossible without checking all stored comments over and over again. 

Did they change that? 
Hey mate, please delete this position as I added coma in the value which is giving wrong numbers. I have posted it again in the right format. Cheers!
(☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞
Hmm. What about manually adding a timestamp to the posting string, for older positions that didn't just get created?

EDIT: Also, can it parse more than one position per post? https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8gwh5c/daily_discussion_friday_may_04_2018/dyg3q57/

EDIT: Looks like a .5% position breaks it, shows up as 50%.

EDIT: If I have multiple positions open, how does it know which one I want to add to/change?

So in my case I'm long from 9450 5X 25% and say the current price is 9646, it gives me 2.03 for the PnL figure. 

So the calculation is (9450 - 9646) / 9646 = 0.0203

What does that 2.03 actually mean?

Edit: Ah I think I've worked it out, it's the percentage difference the BTC price has gone in my favour from my opening price.

What does it mean got sold into? I know it means someone shorted those futures he bought but does that mean there's that many looking to short?
We actually have a good way already to compare these assets. They're open source after all.
Take this statement to be true: In 10 years time there will be cryptocurrency of some sort.

Now ask what ones are around now that will be around in 10 years time. Bitcoin is *by far* the most likely. It will always be the first crypto, *no other coin can ever take that throne.* Diversifying is on the one hand cautious, and on the other hand just super high risk gambling. Bitcoin IS the killer app. Job done.
That's what I was going to suggest earlier but the issue there is people will not see the trades unless they open up the sticky. I like seeing when certain traders are doing something and I like seeing it as a new top-level comment. Perhaps just requiring an explanation below the trade otherwise delete or auto-delete.

Damn that would be awesome. 
Volume across most exchanges have fallen I think, but Gdax has suffered the most afaik
That's what makes this even more eyebrow-raising.
LOL I used the 120 personally during the rally because it was pretty close. I was watching Bitcoin Morning Brief earlier and Tone Vays mentioned the 128 and it does line up pretty perfectly. It doesn't seem like it's done much on the downturn as you said but you have the 200 there as well so I thought I would just mention it because we may just wick into it if we don't go above 10K but ye it is a random ass MA. You could pick a random MA to work with whatever your theory is so I understand your reaction there but it's interesting because of how well it does line up on the bull run.
Well, we all had to start somewhere. 

Reviewing my comment history between $200 and $1,160 is like flipping through my high school yearbook. 

The cringe is real.
We know, you are everyone's stalker, not just Chewy's :)
I don't get it either.  If this was normal, we'd have some sort of pull back by now.  But it's just up up up.  Doesn't seem sustainable to me, but btc doesn't give a fuck.

Looking over the spring 18 bubble, kind of seeing a lot of similarities.  I just don't get why so many alts are pumping, you'd a bunch would be cratering by now.
We've talked about opening a hedge long, not about closing a short. You could still accumulate funding and profit from long...
The thought that it could still fail and drop to zero scares me. 
was thinking about snagging a plot in Forrestville... I too am getting the urge to leave the city. 
Nice trade soccer man, 

May the balls be with you 
You did the right thing - I closed my long at 9.6 yesterday as well and regretted it when I saw it bounce back, but then I heard people talk about getting stopped out on wicks last night, so you might've gotten stopped out even lower.
Added in the ToDo list. Should be easy to do.
range still 6k"-12k"
Arb bots aren't even strong enough to close gap between Dax/Stamp/Finex over lengthy time frames, i highly doubt arbing a derivatives exchange due to a very short term funding pump would have us see a "significant pump" on the spot price. Seems unlikely.

Ofcourse as i type this it's actually pumping, but i would be more inclined to see it as a coincidence unless there's previous data support this.
Bro can you look at my reply to CrypitcallyDodge, is that the same as arb?
Thanks but still don’t know what that means 
The trend could be your friend but i don't trust the trend, Bitfinex is moving massive amounts of usdt out of the exchange, Bitfinex people and shills are deleting lots of tweets, so i think we will see something soon.  (remember, Bitfinex is still under investigation by the us government)
> FYI when you say stuff like this, it comes across like a kid saying, "My daddy has a kazillion bitcoinz, and he's gonna dump 'em all and beat your daddy up! Just you watch!"

No. It does not come across like that. That's just you.
i don't even bother responding to comments like he just made lol
Not gox. Gox was announced after the bubble popped (although there were signs that were pretty clear at the time. Gox also wasn't the only exchange around it was just the most established. It happened on mostly good news (US Congressional hearings) and a China ban. Sure there was willy bot but no one knows the real impact of that and if it could be done then it can be done now, there was actually pump and dump bots sold on bitcointalk in the early days for alt coins because they were easier to pump and dump.
not the point of the conversation lol 
thats what everyone said on the pump after all the previous drops.  I hate to break it to you but we're going on 4 weeks of green candles and the most we've ever had without a big correction is 5.
lol i have no idea why people like you can be so cock sure. why do you think you're right? did god himself tell you??
Don't forget the weekends. Makes it **more than 4 times faster**!

    24x7 / 8x5 = 4.2 
OK sorry about being condescending.

If 43 days is correct, we exited the "bear market" at the 6K low in February.
Shoot it. It’s coming right fur us!
Bears are gonna try to throw us down the stairs here.
I think we're in a for big drop soon, the recent action has just felt like nothing more than massive manipulation to try to get some fomo back in the market.  

Based on nothing other than a gut feeling.
*If* this is just another bull trap, a la 2014, do you think it's more likely that we would double top here or triple top at 11.7K or something in between?
Can you not just say the idea maybe please, I have no idea what these lines mean, to me it looks like the yellow triangle is indicative of where it should go next - which seems like down!  But everyone else is saying up.  I'm trying to breathe but not my bunny or a glass of wine or a bath is helping right now
With the falling wedge + bottom of the pennant holding up VERY well, I think we are due for a breakup here soon 
IMO it makes some sense. It implies that on the highs, the bulls are getting higher highs but are peaking at less momentum - they're losing some momentum to the bears. On the flip side, the bears are gaining some momentum relative to the bulls but are unable to translate that momentum into lower lows.

This happens a lot, especially when the bulls get a lot of momentum with RSI being heavily overbought on a given time scale (as RSI is, by nature, a rational function that moves down much easier the higher it is and vice versa). It's hard for the bulls to hold that much momentum.

Overall, though, it's somewhat bullish - despite the bulls losing momentum relative to bears, the price is moving up still, and if the bulls start gaining relative momentum again the price could start gaining fast. The caution is that if they continue losing momentum to the bears eventually the bears will have *more* momentum (absolute, not relative) and we'll start making lower lows.

TL;DR: https://imgur.com/a/loHfqMs
Here's another look at it:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/WCbsHD13/

Little bit longer period. Say we bounce back down to the bottom of the flag. As soon as we do that we'll move into oversold territory. We've got a huge buy signal for the bulls because it's likely bears will run out of steam before they're able to break down. Not only that, this wedge is likely stalling bulls here because they started taking profit, so we know they have the money to continue buying. Meanwhile, shorts opening in this range aren't making a lot of progress driving the price down, despite RSI momentum being in their favor.

One way or another, RSI needs to start pointing up again, and it looks like it doesn't take much of a change to trigger a large bullish move.
The bottom line is that bull momentum is shown to be falling (lower highs and lower lows), yet the price is rising to new highs (Higher highs and higher lows) on the same period. I'm not sure how to properly characterize that, but I don't think it's common to have the price rise when the bulls aren't even pushing that hard. That describes accumulation to me.
I have no idea how to describe this. I'm interpreting it as accumulation, pure and simple. Supply is leaving the trading desk, so bulls don't have to push as hard to make the price go up. Something along those lines.
Ohhhhh oh.

Living on a prayer
Just out of curiosity what does the dark blue line represent 
except that was legit, unleveraged spot volume.. go look at Gdax volume and check out what happened after the dump from $20k to $13k. Volume fell off a cliff. 

Ever since $6k the majority of volume has been on Bitfinex and bitmex...both leveraged exchanges 

Gdax volume came back on the second fall from $11.7k (wow!) and has slowly declined again 

Liquidity on GDAX is awful lately. Volume is sub 10k on most days

This entire bull run started when Gdax fiat volume started to ramp up around March 2017 at $900. it increased exponentially over time
Yeah, LTC often gets a payday pump on Friday. It's the workin' man's coin.  It's actually the only non-Bitcoin cryptocurrency that I trust will be around in a few years, primarily because of its excellent utility and Lightning Network readiness.
I just like to see ltc break up, this means the buying pressure is still holding strong. It just shows the sentiment of the market imho.

But i could be wrong and we go back to 9k.
Every dip has been bought since $6k. 

China dude has bought 10,000 Btc, you don't tell people that at the top.  

GS starting a trading desk.  

For those of us that have been here since 2014 some of the things that are now reality were a long time dream back then, including $10k Bitcoin.  

In 2014/2015 $1000 Bitcoin was moon.  We are now walking around on it daily (10x that dream) and forever look to the stars as to where the next moon is.

whoops my b. Yes we could stay in here a bit longer, which is why i'm not adding to my long yet. I could have this drawn incorrectly too lol
plot twist, usd is dead but the copper in pennies has skyrocketed; so bitcoin equalling pennies ain't so bad
The nonfarm payroll is seen as a leading indicator in the legacy stock market haha. No effect on the new world, can be ignored as many legacy indicators for stock markets
I'm not in America. Generally get paid on the 30th or last working friday of the month. At first I thought about miners payouts and "nonfarm" thing got me confused.
I'm not suggesting it changes the market, but I think it certainly meets the definition of a bear acting bearish at the close of the daily candle.
You're right. I only have about 6 months of experience.

Every time I've seen the RSI go oversold on a dump, even on relatively short timeframes, it has been followed by a bounce. It has made for easy long entries (exits are still tough though).
yeah, itms only shorting if you short more than the notional value of your BTC/Crypto portfolio, in which case you are naked short the difference.

I call it shortinng because I am not selling my Bitcoin. I am selling a derivative product which is collateralized in Bitcoin. I still have my Bitcoin, but when I close my position, I have to balance the books
If you have no BTC to sell you have to borrow some. That's my case, i'm on FIAT full time and just long or short temporary positions.
Based on current fundamentals and events a huge dip is more likely, there are zero reasons why bitcoin should be valued at 9.7 or 10K. 
I don't know how I was confused. I think the numbers confused me 
too early
The break from log can move us to the $12k range before moving to a new low (likely to be about ~$5k by mid summer if we follow OP's chart)
yeah agreed, we STILL aren't above $10K and its been weeks.


> we are currently rejecting the previous fib channel.

As in falling off 1.272?
He is, just teasing sorry. 
To be fair you have talked about 2014 happening a lot, BUT I would never rub it in or brag if you were wrong.   You have really good content, comments and screw the haters.
This. A 2014 repeat is still in play. Still though, I think it's definitely possible that we are writing history instead of following it. But I'm not ruling out a 2014 repeat as a possibility, in which case I am prepared to hunker down for the next 2 years and just hold (because I would be too afraid to sell and then miss the next spike.)
That's a bit of an outlier though (since he just created the tool), and I guess you'd just have to weigh slippage against accountability.

Using the current market value at the time of posting as the entry is really the only surefire way to ensure that all entries were possible at the time they were posted. 

A middle ground might be to ignore entries that fall outside of x% from current market price. So you could enter a long here from $9,400 (for example), but not $9,000.
Yeah I think a better solution is manual entry that must be within a certain % range of index. This still opens the door to users posting better entries/exits than they actually got but it's better than nothing. Either way there has to be some sort of system, otherwise all the pyro-maniacal rabbits will post fudged trades.
Well it just means the faster you post after opening a position the more "true" your trade looks. Nothing wrong with that. that's how it works here anyway
I have very high hopes for this position.

If $9,800 breaks, then I'd potentially hold it until $11,700. Longer if $11,700 doesn't put up too much of a fight. 

I could tolerate a bounce off $11,700 that goes as far down as $9,800. 
Made more with that tip than my last 8 trades :)

You didn't have to, but i appreciate it.

I really just do this for fun and to help people here. That's why i won't put any ads, banners or whatever on the page.
I often wonder how much btc the changetip guys are currently sitting on.

I know I never bothered collecting it when it was still active, and I easily had $10 or so in random tips that people had thrown me over time. 

Well, that $10 in BTC is now worth about $500.

and that's just one user who couldn't be bothered to collect $10. Seems there's got to be tons of people with abandoned btc.
Jeez is 100% really the best default for stack percentage? I'm pretty much never all in.
One other question: do you want to restrict this to XBT for now? 

If you're interested in other coins, can I post those trades to the alt thread for BitcoinMarkets? I'm guessing that if I posted my alt trades on this thread they'd get deleted and I'd earn a day ban eventually.
That sounds good!

I'm wondering now how to handle a position that ages and gets profit taken and added to and an adjusted ca.  Perhaps keep the initial entry and then update a linked comment. But if the entry its self was done with averageibg in the shorter term then I guess some sort of updating feature could help, but that's tedious again. 
Yeah a btc address near the bottom is unobtrusive and allows for donations. Should really add it /u/justanotherlogin

Don't think you don't deserve anything cause you did it for fun. Let people donate! People like to reward efforts like these 
No I upvoted this one :P 
I brought this up with /u/justanotherlogin when he first was talking about this bot. I think including spot price at the time of posting next to the position is a good solution. I also argued for disallowing anything over 5% off spot. Having a link to the original post helps as well.

At the end of the day, people are going to lie about how good they are at things, and there's no way to *really* protect against that, with this bot or with general posting. Frequent users should know the reputable posters. 
I've replied to Chevy on this.

Really read the sub. I often see people posting long after they're in profit.

Doesn't really matter. I think the site will mostly help to check if trader you watch is in position now.
> Step 3: Direct Message those posters and offer to trade on their behalf if they send you bitcoin in exchange for a percentage of the gains you produce for them.

People actually do that? Color me naive

Something tells me you've been propositioned in the past...
It would be fun if there was simple demo trade system on here where people could post their trades on a leaderboard of sorts. Everybody starts with 1BTC and we see where we all are by the end of the year.
You're probably right. I pay an unhealthy amount of attention so I have a very clear sense of who is reputable, but obviously not everyone does that lol
I like you!
IIRC, you falsely accused me, even when I had linked the post of my original trade in the post where you replied and accused me. So you earned my downvote here.

A reasonable question for you to ask yourself (and others who are thinking along the same lines as you) is, why is this so important to you that you err on the side of falsely accusing people? Are you looking for a way to 'follow the expert'? Are you angry that some people lie? You ought to know that will happen no matter what. What's the real issue?

When I have done it, I have posted my trades here as a way to kind of hold myself accountable. I am not interested in having others begin following me because I'm doing well, in part because this is a shortcut to thinking for yourself, and then it becomes a way to blame someone else if a trade heads in the wrong direction on you. Following the expert creates bad trading habits.
guess we need more buying power for that
ya broken. use bitcoinwisdom 
Good luck, man.
Has Bitcoin performed in any way like a traditional asset... ever?  We're in new territory here, and I think Bitcoin could come to be seen as a safe haven since it is detached from the traditional financial system.  Time will tell.  There will be a meltdown in the traditional markets at some point.
That is true, but I can't see them selling it in a market downturn.  They're probably looking at it as a hedge.
goldman's only a bank when its time to get bailout $$.  When its time to follow bank regulations, they aren't a bank.

I never said that.  I said we are about to go parabolic a few days ago.  And I stand by that.  Wait a couple of weeks.
Ah ok.
I would. Easily. I have been busy so I can't but a few times that I was at my computer I closed my long, waited for funding to pass then re-opened. It has saved me quite a bit of money, actually.
Watch the bitmex post funding pump on the 1minute candles on FINEX and you will be scratching your head... obviously someone with huge bags is using both exchanges and doing some manipulation around the funding window that works to their advantage
thanks for responding bub. I don’t fuck with margin yet but heard and thanks. I’m waiting a retrace like everyone else. I think it would have fallen off a cliff there in a normal market but this feels like some big accumulation buying up the sells. 
I'm also checking ETH and it's on a steep channel, almost hitting BBands on the 1D and 3D. If it breaks down (and BTC going to 9500 or so could help that happening) then BTC might start being dragged. 
It could still rise and only impact the ETHBTC ratio, but since this area is pretty heavy on resistance it would add to resistance.
I really want to go long, but this area is pretty hard. Had my eyes on 9450 yesterday but it never broke 9500 so my alarms didn't trigger...
We've had 20 weekly candles since the top of Dec 13th.  9 have been red, 11 are currently green. 

Last time the weekly MACD flipped green was back in April 2017 and price opened at $1200.  If things continue as they are now it will flip green in 2 weeks time.  I can wait. 
But if it's immediately followed by another strong bull run, was it ever really bearish or just a pause from the action. If you zoom out to weekly or monthly candles and look at an index back to 2010, if looks like just one massive bullrun with a few pullbacks. 
Now. It was -9 when I posted. Happy to see it up now.
yeah but we got all the TA stuff proving it cant go down anymore

We've also been here before and shot up to 20K.
yep and we were here before and pup up to 16K+
not true at all.. when BTC makes major moves people funnel capital from alts to BTC. alts were bleeding non stop last time BTC went up to 12k from 6k.

I agree, that's what I was essentially saying. He's doing actual analysis. But imo the line between wyckoff and gut fear is pretty blurry when you aren't showing your evidence or using data at all.
Well, yea, you can mathematically show that gravity is a thing. Da fuq do you think Newton did? Throw an apple and say "ta-da!"?

Even so, nice straw man you got going there. Universal law of physics =/= highly speculative theory in a chaotic market.

The major short covering will happen OTC.  The people who are really cleaning up are the ones lending 10,000 coins, knowing they're going to be dumped, and using the proceeds to buy more at lower prices.  The rich get richer, you know.
Not really. Stops, liquidations or covering can occur when the market appears relatively quiet. I'm not saying that what you're indicating *isn't* happening to whatever degree. I'm just noting that the market is a confluence of a variety of different actions. 

I highly doubt that one party is "in charge" to some significant degree. Big orders and such will test the liquidity of the books (the actually liquidity, not what the order books *look* like [they are obviously completely dynamic and often spoofy]). When a critical tipping point is reached the market can breakout/down or shift directions. I don't think it's reasonable to expect that a so-called *un*manipulated market would somehow just be smooth sailing with little-to-no volume fluctuations across candles. These are relatively illiquid markets on barely-functioning exchanges (look at you, MEX). Choppy waters and fast movements are par for the course. 
He did set up a bot account, but it has insufficient karma to post replies, so he switched it to his main account. FFS man, pay attention. 
Should have been more clear. I mean the link spamming is coming from the bot not from the user behind it. And it only posts the link when someone is using the bot. So the frequency will increase if more users are using it. I don't see much wrong with that. 

I don't think /u/justanotherlogin is actively spamming a link here so I don't get what the fuss is about. The bot could only post "position saved sucessfully" instead of also linking the website, but honestly I don't think that counts as spamming.
I do have a bot account but like i said in the previous post (and other users stated as well) it can't post because of insufficient Karma. I think it's important for users willing to use the bot to know if the position was saved to the database. I could refrain from linking the site, but i believe that helps spread the word and get more users on board.

The site is raising red flags because it's hosted on a free hosting server. I have no problem in setting up a domain and a shared host if i see real interest on it being used. But for now i think it is sufficient.

The bot itself is the weakest link as it's hosted on a raspberry pi at home, but even that can be upgraded if/when i decide to host the site on a new server.

Who cares?
WOT has a lot of incorrect ratings. I wouldn't count on it. Privacytools.io has a lot of Firefox extensions that keep you safe and private and are also open source. AFAIK WOT isn't open source and similar to Adblock you can probably buy ratings. 
It's probably for being hosted in a free hosting site. 

Will go away as soon as i register a domain and have it on a shared hosting. I have one of my own but don't want to worry too much about security so i don't want to host it there. Rather pay a new host + domain to host this site.


Agreed w all of this, not to mention if Mike or someone else ever did get hunted he could easily turn it around on them and post a fake stop loss where he has a limit order set to get a better entry 
Actually Mike used stops like you do. He said what he will do, didn't set them on auto.
some of those candles on bitmex though.. lol.

XBTUSD long $100 x5 -sl $90 please stop me out whales, give us a chance to buy btc for $99
today
Have a read of the earlier comments on this daily, there's a lot of them related to this bot. 
The bot is recording the leverage wrong.

it says that MikeXBT is long with leverage 10x but this is not true. just as an example...
wut? I'm not showing projections on there... i just keep those in my head
Regardless of how much you have in your account they won't lend you more than $5000 if you are tier 2
But do they have comped drinks?
actually, many casinos do. They give you a 5 dollar roulette chip but you can only play it if you double it with 5 of your own dollars. Its almost exactly like doing leverage.
No problem man. 
As long as you bought in early November you are still in gains, heck even the end of November is starting to see gains 
Except that there's a distinction to be made between shitcoins/scams/ICOs and honest to god commodities, like BTC, XRM or LTC. There are clearly at least two different classes of projects were talking about here. Bitcoin has a real proposed used case and its possible that it succeeds in the way that many think it will/might. Can the same be said for [insert shitcoin]? Probably not. So many of these are just blatant pump and dump schemes. So yeah, people are attracted to gambling on these things, apparently, but that doesn't mean that the actual legitimate projects are in the same "game" category. I think it's reflective of the phase the market is currently in. Ultimately, I suspect that this alt craze will die off completely (or close to it) and we'll be left with a handful of legit coins, one being Bitcoin. I used to be more sure this was happening sooner rather than later but now I'm less certain. Still, the bottom line remains that 99% of these coins are completely worthless and yet they persist.
Lack of selling on the way up, results in a large amount of supply (holders) selling sentiment increases, buying dries up price drops.

Is that a bubble? why/whynot
If it was a h+s formation would you be using the same logic to draw conclusions?

My answer to your question is: I have no reason to expect that it will be the same. So what's your reasoning for thinking it will be the same? 

I don't mean any disrespect in any of this, if its coming across like that.
Can confirm.

Source: Yes
lol I mean there are some smart people here but they're not saying too much or it's generally split pretty evenly 
No he definitively told me he's bullish. And I definitely don't think chewtoy is dumb, I just know he trades purely on trends and breakouts. He also longed $11.5k before closing it pretty quickly the second time around. 

Not saying it was a bad call, but he has a specific trading style, you know

I don't trust the diagonal nearly as much as he does, and I also still think there's way too much greed and speculation to allow us to move up too much. 

Idk, when I see the moon boys come out and talk about fundamentals I just basically get a ptsd flashback to every single time that's basically been near the local top 
In the book 'symmetry, causality, mind', author Michael Layton presents a definition of intelligence defined in terms of ability to predict the future.  

Readers here may be interested - from the overview "Leyton observes that the mind assigns to any shape a causal history explaining how the shape was formed. We cannot help but perceive a deformed can as a dented can. Moreover, by reducing the study of shape to the study of symmetry, he shows that symmetry is crucial to our everyday cognitive processing. Symmetry is the means by which shape is converted into memory."

Relevant to trading in the application of shapes on charts for anticipating future conditions or interpreting past events, and for the generally scientific approach to understanding the human condition.  
buffett could

eh never said they did
Btc don't do small trends tho, idk. Maybe we really will just range up and down for a year.

I'm not saying this is it, this is the top, I just don't know if this is the **bull run** 
Lol maybe. Probably not.
That's gonna be a long wait.
On Trading View, open two tabs and type BTUSDLONGS and BTCUSDSHORTS.
I don't want alt talk to leak in here but I don't/can't stomach trading BTC so trading alts is the only way I can increase my BTC stack. I hedge by leaving fiat on GDAX to buy any significant BTC dip. Haven't taken profit yet but I'm up still 60% BTC in 3 weeks since I got back into crypto and I only make 4-5 trades a week, if that. 
being inclusive is not the same as catering to delusional people.

Bitcoin is the crypto standard bearer. That's not going to change because some people were late to the game. 

Here is a nice chart showing how bitcoin has no real competition.

I pay less than 1/1000th of a BTC per day to hold my positions open (https://i.imgur.com/m0gs2yK.png). The two I currently have open are up 4 figures.
Thought about it but some users like to see the info when another user opens/closes the position . It's a tricky matter...
That's not how bull traps work.  There's no whipsaw here.  Three weeks and (actually I think the parent is wrong -- it's more like) a 50% rise would be a bit large if your goal was simply to fake people out.  I think bears are smoking something really good if they've convinced themselves that this is just some kind of massive long-term bull trap.

Is it legit? I like how the price change arrows point up but the font is red. 
I can add the exchange, but i see the possible confusion. Even my price checker is averaging Bitfinex and Bitstamp to try and reduce the differences between exchanges.

Agreed.  If you are going to give your positions to this bot, it’s probably best to just post as you have been, as though you are buying or selling at spot, and just continue to use the spot price.  

I have switched to futures recently from swaps.  but seeing futures prices referenced would have confused the shit out of me before I made the switch, 


How is PnL calculated then? It has to reference spot price for the selected pair, doesn't it?
Dates would be for perfection also, for now i don't even show them on the site, even though i'm saving them. Could be interesting to show position duration. 

For now the values will suffice.
Done
It track by position type (open/long) and trading pair. As long as your positions are different in these values it should work fine. If there is already an open position i'll probably have to ignore the newer position

Will correct the 0.5% bug, i knew it could be an issue but didn't have the time to fix it.

The timestamps will be from the original post. So if the bot didn't get your post, you can go back and comment your own post and it will assume the main post (will be implemented soon, for now only my user has that ability)

A dominance chart over time per coin based on the volume each exchange has for trading that coin... that'd be pretty sweet. Hmm maybe I'll tinker with that... does any site offer anything like that yet?
So what is your interpretation?
Now you got me interested...

Gonna read those when I scalp some free time :-D
Oh yeah I should have done that. Too late for it now. If futures go to a discount again I'd lose lots of that money. 
I get it man... I was really close to buying a plot of land out there with the intention of building a home when I was going through my ‘man in the woods’ phase. Decided instead to use that money to travel. 

That whole area is one of the most peaceful and beautiful parts of California and the perfect remediation for the insane stresses of city life

thanks bud
Dax and Stamp have trash liquidity, so Finex and Mex are the only option for arb bots nowadays
Basically, due to funding, Mex gets suppressed before funding (like 100 bucks) and then you can arb by selling on finex and longing on Mex, so Mex leads Finex to follow down. You see 100 bucks is 1% of 9750, and the funding rate is <1%, so you can go long at 9650 and close at 9750 and it will outweigh the funding.

Basically, a bunch of bots implement some version of this, so the price dips before funding, even spot prices
Bitmex charges interest for holding shorts/longs every 8 hrs. Currently it's very expensive to long on Bitmex cuz there's more people going long than shorting, so borrowing costs for long positions is high. THerefore the few people who are shorting are making bank on the interest, which pays out in about 8min. When their interest is paid to them, they'll close the short, pumping the price up.
> Bitfinex is moving massive amounts of usdt out of the exchange

Where can I read more about this?
OK, well, it comes across to me like that.  Does that reflect poorly on me?  I mean, I may be a somewhat arrogant bull, but at least I offer reasons when I make statements like, "BGD incoming."  (Incidentally, I'm usually right when I make those statements.)  This guy's like, "Derp... it's gonna go down hard" in a market that's up over 50 percent since its February low.  
This is a copy pasta I made just to help enlighten. It’s amazing people forget you can use basic economics to make decisions.
Now, I wasn't in crypto in those days (I wish I was), but I gather that, while a price correction from BTC hitting 1K+ for the first time (in late November 2013) was already taking place, Gox gave it a knockout punch, starting a multi year bear market. 

On 7 February 2014, Mt. Gox halted all bitcoin withdrawals (but anxiety regarding Gox liquidity was rampant among traders before this, since there were numerous red flags in days prior). BTC price on Feb 7th closed at 700$, hitting a high of 763$. Since that day, the price was in free fall and it would take BTC two and a half years to reach 700$ handle again (price hit 700$ in June 2016 for the first time since Feb 7th 2014). In the next few days since that announcement, price went down 50% (and continued to go down for more than two years, bottoming out below 200$).

Wikipedia states that in 2014, Gox was handling over **70% of all bitcoin transactions worldwide**, so it was by far the largest exchange at the time, with most users and most funds. 850,000 bitcoins belonging to customers and the company went missing, and when the exchange was shut down in February 2014, it was a **tremendous loss of liquidity**, that struck almost a deadly blow to crypto, while it was still in it's infancy.  

Having said all that, to me there is absolutely no way that collapse of mtgox didn't have a crucial effect on the market, and in essence caused the bear market that ensued.  

Chinese ban dude, then Gox, two huge triggers. On today's scale it would be like tether collapse I guess
It certainly is. The point is, since no such event happened recently, comparing the potential price action in this year with that of 2014 is not adequate. 
[deleted]
That's just wrong. Just one example: the move from 1k to 3k.
I'm good at math.
Of course, thanks for correcting my oversight.
It can be longer than 2 quarters though. I thought 2 is the minimum.
Backup bulls at the bottom of the stairs ready to catch us. 
Massive manipulation as a concept is overrated. The market is clearly hungry for some upside.

However, there are a couple indicators to keep an eye on for some pullback:

* Bitmex funding costs
* Kraken's empty margin pool
* ETH's parabolic ascent and potential for a blowoff top (SEC "security or not" meeting next week, anyone?)
* Potential for a BTC double top at $9,8k (or triple? this was also the last high off the bounce on Mar 12 before we continued down)

How would you distinguish manipulation from actual fomo though?
Triple tops are an extremely uncommon event in the Bitcoin space.

I'm away from my charts at the moment, but I'm struggling to think offhand of a triple top that's ever completed to the downside. 

A triple top at $11,700 that subsequently confirmed with a drop below $6,000 would be nothing short of disastrous for Bitcoin. The technical target for that breakdown would be $300. Although I'd argue that's following the letter of the law rather than the spirit of the law as far as setting targets for breakdowns goes. 

If the market is going to lose Steam and continue the bear Trend, I'd expect it to happen either right now or actually following a breakout of $11,700 to the upside.

If the market makes it to $11,700 again, I'm pretty confident it would have eventually breakout above.
Dude of your bunny isn't helping, not sure I can.

But seriously, I was showing a falling wedge (which often comes before a breakout up). We're above previous support, although it's not strongly tested. Basically this move doesn't need to cause concern as long as 9520 holds. It's fairly normal / expected volatility in our space.
What's wrong..? it sounds like you're way overinvested


did you buy at $9800 or something 
It looks like profit taking and accumulation from bulls and hesitancy from bears. Still a deeply undecided market. If accumulation is happening in this range, and that's what's driving the price up, then I think we'll see a significant breakout.

This happened just before we hit our first ATH in years, at the end of 2016.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/Ja6Y7aEw/
My personal expectation of a bounce/support zone. It has no meaning unless that scenario plays out, as it only has one actual contact point haha

I basically averaged the previous slope with the unsustainable steep slope. 
That doesn't seem like low volume to me.  10K BTC valued at $9k apiece on one exchange?  Man, a couple years ago that would have been more money than was changing hands on all exchanges in a week.
Or it's just a pump. All alts, even ones that I would consider legit, are far more prone to these pump fluctuations (which often occur in parallel with other alts) than Bitcoin is. I'd be weary of assuming buying is so-called organic in this case. Perhaps you are right though. Who really knows in the end until after the fact. 
> GS starting a trading desk.

I love how this is "bullish" now. No one remembers the last time an institutional investment group opened up bitcoin futures?

I think you need to decide if you're going to use wicks or ignore them, because your resistance line uses the initial 8.8k + wick and then decides to ignore the next.
Plot Twist: Exchanges are using Chain^TM, a blockchain that's pegged to copper reserves but it's unclear whether Chain is solvent. 
I would think the farm payroll would have a bigger influence on bitcorn. 
I was just thinking it’s been a while since you came on here and said bitcoin is worthless lol.  Welcome back.  
So you imagine we could get to 12k on this movement alone?
:p sorry if I took it too seriously. 
Teasing is OK, no worries 
Yes but I generally try to say it with a tentative tone. I have never once said that I am positive it will turn out the same. 
That's actually better idea.

But I think that credibility is earned. F.ex. if you won't post your entry before $1k green candle then nobody will accuse you that you lie. If I do this then there might be some people who won't believe. And with your solution none of those trades can go into this tool.
This is doable.
I could also change the text when someone closes their position to mention the Open Datetime and the Spot price at that time, so people can easily check for differences between opening value and spot value
And nobody will even bother to check their trades... I bet that there will be like 5-10 traders that people actually are interested in, others will be just statistics.
Yeah, also unless you're just scalping with 100x leverage, the precise values aren't all that important. It's more about whether or not the trader made a good decision than the exact ROE they made or lost, right?
also this would mean you only have to post if Long or Short and no other inputs. This makes everything less complex, no?
There you go! you just made my day with that shit.
I originally closed my long at 8900 from 9470 and then re-longed from 9000. That's how much i believed in this too. Let's ride it up this whole month! 
Lets say that you expect bitcoin to go to $11k\+, wouldnt it be better to long ripple or ETH instead?

If bitcoin sets ATH around $20k then ripple should go back to its ATH price of $3\+ representing a 300&#37;\+ gain as opposed to a 100&#37; gain of bitcoin
Did it go through? I just queried my balance and it's only a few cents now but I don't see any sort of confirmation. I was concerned that the money disappeared. 
Yeah I don't think I ever collected mine either. I think I had upwards of .1 if I remember correctly (not on this account). 

Quite the exit scam.
The best i can do is to use the same settings as the previous position.
The first one you must set leverage and stack % and on the next one the bot will use those values if none is specified
I would have to run another bot instance in the alt thread, but should be doable. Just have to wait until my bot gets a better server (its on a rasperry pi 1, single core) so it won't crash.
You can add already, will create a profit option and will log every change since opening till close. Each with a link to the original post so everything can be tracked and the profits get added to the final PnL
Yeah. Sloppy keeps making bank shorting BTC so he's like our resident George Soros. He'll cover you. :P
Ok, will add it in the last position in the ToDo list, so when i have all working properly i'll look into it.
> I think including spot price at the time of posting next to the position is a good solution. 

Yeah, that's a good idea, plus maybe displaying and tracking the difference between spot and claimed entry/exit. 

>I also argued for disallowing anything over 5% off spot. Having a link to the original post helps as well.

Yup.

>At the end of the day, people are going to lie about how good they are at things, and there's no way to really protect against that, with this bot or with general posting. Frequent users should know the reputable posters.

For sure, but there are ways to make it harder or at least more obvious.
>Really read the sub. I often see people posting long after they're in profit.

Yeah. I think most of us know who these people are but still, this is just another avenue for them to lie and brag about money they didn't actually make. I would hate for this to just make this problem worse.

>I think the site will mostly help to check if trader you watch is in position now.

Yeah it's definitely useful and worthwhile just for the sake of this. 
Someone here offered me $10000 to trade with. They even sent $1000, I realized it was really stupid and potentially litigious and sent it back lol 
I'm actually not sure if that's a common occurrence, but I know the inverse is true. 

Every now and then somebody will shoot me a DM asking if I can manage trades on their behalf. 

Nothing crazy, but I'd say it's possible to scam someone (or several someones) out of a few $100 or possibly a few $1,000 in that manner.
Actually, I've been active on /r/bitcoinmarkets for about 3 years, and nobody has ever messaged me with an offer to trade on my behalf. 

Good to know! I figure most of the good folks around here either like me or at least don't mind me. I've certainly received a handful of 'thanks' from members that I respect for some of the tirades I've leveled at liars and shills. It's mostly just the liars, shills and assholes that don't like me, especially DK (i.e. /u/ustorest - who's since had his new account suspended, though I'm sure he'll be back soon with another account).

Thanks though. It's appreciated!
> IIRC, you falsely accused me, even when I had linked the post of my original trade in the post where you replied and accused me.

I vaguely remember something along those lines, though I don't remember you providing evidence. Happy to admit I was wrong where I was. I have to imagine that the vast majority of times I call someone out it's a well founded accusation, but I can and have certainly made mistakes. 

>So you earned my downvote here.

Why? What does one have to do with the other?

>A reasonable question for you to ask yourself (and others who are thinking along the same lines as you) is, why is this so important to you that you err on the side of falsely accusing people?

I would hardly put it that way. I'm usually not going to call someone out unless there is good reason or a pattern of behavior. Again, there may be exceptions, but I'm not just trying to start shit for no reason.

>What's the real issue?

Accountability. Someone's should stand up and point out bullshit when they see it. I seem to be the most natural candidate to do so, so I do it. 

>I am not interested in having others begin following me because I'm doing well, in part because this is a shortcut to thinking for yourself, and then it becomes a way to blame someone else if a trade heads in the wrong direction on you. 

I'm not interested in that either. I'm only interested in deriving trading ideas from the reasons offered, not just the win rate.  

>Following the expert creates bad trading habits.

I agree if you mean following blindly. Gaining insight into the reasons behind good and bad trades is the worthwhile endeavor. Following blindly seems like a bad idea.
Closed for lunch money, basically
Look at a YTD chart. Does that look like a safe haven to you?

The idea that BTC is a safe place to move traditionally-invested funds during instability would be considered absolutely batshit insane by 99% of the world, including me. 

Note the qualifiers I used above. I am bullish long-term and have funds in it, obviously. But if I have half a million bucks in an IRA and the market starts tanking, do you really think I'm going to put it in bitcoin?
straight /r/bitcoin hopium...

not to mention bitcoin has performed exceptionally well in line with the stock market. it has never proven itself during a bearish stock market 
But...if everyone else does that then it doesn't work. You'd have to sell earlier than everyone else and buy back immediately after. it would result in losses quite frequently, nah? 
How much are the reopen fees to do this? Thanks in advance
yea I mean it's definitely dependent upon the time frame you're looking at it on. If you look at it from a 12-18 month perspective it's pretty definitively a bear market- it's a "correction" in terms of gains from 2009, yes, but that kind of skips over a lot of the despair, bearishness, low sentiment, etc that is assumed when calling it a bear market

in terms of sentiment alone 2017 corrections didn't even come close
Yeah, and if you think that will happen again, I have some waterfront property I would like to sell you
Which was a DCB
No they weren't bleeding. ETH was stuck at $300 for quite awhile, but not dropping/bleeding.
I don't need gravity proven to me at this point.  You do and that's where we are different.
I did "https://www.tradingview.com/x/eLnsCyJj/ Wipe-out candle to shake-up liquditiy, happened by pulling liquidity of orderbook and market selling 2x700 btc. Then market closing it in one time."
LOL no worries bud. We all have to start somewhere. To be honest I don't understand half the shit that gets said in here so this was my one and only opportunity to help!
Do you have the source code publicly available for the bot? No worries if not but I was thinking of doing exactly this a few weeks ago to track my own trades. I've just been lazy because I haven't done any programming in about 2 years (and I need to update my python knowledge for the differences between py2 and py3) but webscraping and data parsing in python is something I need to get back into soon for work and just thought it would be interesting to have a read through the code(and I've never written a bot on reddit before either but I'm guessing there are open source projects for that).
I don't think he meant it as a bad thing...? 
I'm sure it's not 100% perfect, but it's extraordinarily effective at helping avoid scammy sites.
That makes sense. Stop losses are rarely your friend, more often than not they're your enemy (because they kick you out of position when liquidity is likely to be low and RSI is overheated in the opposite direction of your trade).

However in the rare instances where they're your friend, they're **really** your friend and save you from catastrophe. 
Chew usually closes way before his stops hit though 
care to elaborate? I haven't been watching the orderbook today. 

Or are you referencing past wicks?

You do realize criminal shitcoins are going to banned off all fiat gateways within a year and pretty much be worthless right?



Is that one you posted a bubble? Not really given the timeframe but it plays surprisingly similar to my images (sorry for the handmade red lines, nothing better in this Mac):

https://www.dropbox.com/s/dc1nbrbetsgwgb6/Schermata%202018-05-04%20alle%2019.37.32.png?dl=0

Then, an H&S is very different from this pattern, however if that was an H&S in formation I would have been waiting for it to complete before giving it as a valid pattern.

Same applies to this movement, off course I do not predict the future, I am not sure it will play like the previous bubbles and we need to see what happens at the first serious correction (we didn't see one yet in the last 4 weeks) but I have my reasons to think the current bullish movement will not translate into the end of the BM, not today at least.
Quoting myself:

History does not repeat but usually rhymes, please check previous bubble’s chart and other market’s behavior after speculative bubbles popped;
usually markets do not recover in strong V shape, it takes some time for the average Joe to heal the wounds and start investing again;
so far we retraced about 68%, statistically there is some room down to at least 75%; 
current bull trend started following a huge short squeeze and most of the BGDs we have seen are due to huge market buys within an illiquid market (and further short squeezes);
volumes are still low and interest, outside reddit, is nowhere near the same during similar price levels in November; 
no wedge on the 1D significantly broke up since the beginning of the bear market, and the one we have been in the last days does not look good; 

Heard to much "this time is different" in December;
a new asset that should have played differently;
the fact we did not believe it could go to the moon was our fault and moonboys would have laughed at us delusional permabears (lol, I'm not even negative in life nor so bear); 
lot of institutional investors and banks buying in (ripple?);
a new paradigm!!!!1111!!!!!11!

17-22/Dec/2018: pop! It was not different, as it is stilla a very speculative asset in a very speculative market with very few use cases and, basically, very very low to zero adoption.

I am super-bullish long term, but not convinced the BM is over and have at least some sideway movement ahead.
To say the BM is over i think we should keep rising with prices (above previous ath at@11800), see an increase in volumes, see an increase in normie's interest.

I don't know, man. I'm sitting on my hands too, waiting for a pullback. But it doesn't seem to be giving in just yet.  
Do you think bitcoin is going to go up? 
what do you consider the bull run? when it hits a million in 2025?

I just...this is playing out too perfectly idk. 

I straight up said a few months ago this would be the way it plays out if we follow 2014, I said a few weeks ago that the only way we'd break below $6k is if we made another attempt at $10-12k and came back down. People aren't defeated enough to sell sub $6k

Where do we go after $12k?

is btc REALLY going to make new ATHs this year? 

Trend lines and diagonals are cool but really, just think about who tf is going to be buying bitcoin all the way up to $20k+. It's going to need massive mania and frenzy, more than we had in December. Either that or serious institutional accumulation. 

And when you really look into the institutional money and fundamentals you'll quickly see it's mainly just a meme for moon boys. Most money is just venture capital, nothing game changing or anything. Institutional investors who thought bitcoin would succeed would have bought in by now. 

Is it really just this underground thing that only new age millenials with too much money understand? 

Idk mate idk...
I'm patient
I'll be back here in 3-6 months to say hello.
Thank you!
Lol, I was making a sarcastic joke. Anyone that knows me here knows that I'm about as BTC maximalist as they come. These folks do actually exist though. I'm just mocking them though. I fully agree with you. I'm not even sure why the mods added the alt discussion and I'm not sure I like it (it just draws in shitty folks from the likes of rbtc and ethtrader)

That's a really interesting/useful chart though that I haven't seen before. Bookmarked. Thanks!
Yeah I'm sure 2018 is the year that Tron takes the throne.
it still is wasting money, unless you need the remaining capital for other investements , otherwise it's pure non sense
Well, I'm not a product manager but the easiest way to know would be to ask your user base. Just put up a Strawpoll and you'll know what the consensus is. :)

Also... semi-related, I feel like yourself, /u/jarederaj (MoonMath guy), and I should collectively build something seeing how we're the resident misfit engineers of /r/BitcoinMarkets hmmm....
Yes sir, keep drawing memelines and gamble based upon a RSI output. Meanwhile empirical signs of bigger players are all over the place and their intentions always leave traces.

it’s as legit as a glitchy-as-hell Chinese crypto market website can be. 

Meaning there’s a fair chance you could try depositing some Litecoin, but instead your car gets repossessed. 
Chinese have reverse colors. Red is up and green is down. That's because in Chinese culture red is positive. 
why not use the exchange_contract name for the contract.  KRAK_XBTUSD, GDAX_BTCUSD, etc..

Just an idea.
Nice catch :)
I am averaging BTCUSD Bitfinex and Bitstamp. I could try to pass the pair to the function that gets the price depending on the pair. Would have to check Bitmex for the futures probably.
Cleanest thing to do would probably be to just go back to the original comment that I made in the daily and just reply to that comment with the position open or close. 

That would also add legitimacy to the claim, as otherwise I could potentially just backfill whatever entries/exits I wanted.


Cheers! All well now, apart from the fact that I had opened a bad position lol. 
Nice work man. I'll keep looking for bugs and such. :)

Thanks. Why'd you get a downvote???WTF IS UP WITH THE VOTING
An important clarification:

Only the perpetual swaps contracts are fee based. 

Their other futures contracts do not share that fee structure. But instead rely on a premium or discount against spot to incentivize long or short entries. 

When traders are bullish, futures will be trading higher than spot. When traders are bearish, futures will generally trade at a discount compared to spot. 
Great, thanks for the explanation

Agreed. simple equilibrium patterns like this have been the origin of all my most profitable trades, not some wacky TA prediction. 
Have a read of this link below and then look at the charts. It describes 2013 (and even the recent price action) pretty well considering it's not actually about bitcoin. I think people like to make Gox out to be a bigger issue than it actually was price wise because then it means this time is definitely different (it did have an effect just not as much as most people believe IMO). I had an account at Gox but never used it because it was so sketchy - and back then everything was bloody sketchy! - I used Amir Taakis exchange britcoin/intersango and then bitstamp to buy my BTC.

Thats what I said but maybe I wasn't clear. The China ban is what people say caused it to crash. In reality we went from sub $50 BTC to around 200 and then over a few weeks rocketed to 1.4K so it was going to correct hard anyway. I don't think Gox was the cause of the bear market at all because it wasn't until after the top that it was known(thanks Roger...). It may have made it slightly longer but in fairness bitcoin grew so fucking quickly in the early days there was always going to be a bear market like that sooner or later.
No one is discussing why. Just that it's possible. if you think it's truly impossible btc doesn't make a new ATH again I'd love to make a very high stakes bet with you 
there was a correction there.  multiple red weeks in that time frame.  and thats right before the end of the bubble when we shot up to 19k.  Why label me a liar?  Is it because I said the price might not always go up? 
we were already in an uptrend during that time frame, in that case you should count the red weeks. During 2013/2015 (1175->162) downtrend the most you had on finex was 4 green weeks in a row.
any other examples?  that looks like the most contrarian one I can find and it still dropped from 3k to 2k on that one week in may 2017.  and then had another big correction 2 weeks after that.

Interesting, yeah most people are confident that a break above 12K would signal a path to new ATH, so bull trapping above that would mean maximum pain, which sounds just like something Bitcoin would do.
[deleted]
phew, ok Thanks
9377..
 Just trying to pre-empt,  more than 3 red candles still gives me mini freak out.  Hahaha might take a while after the massive " correction" that we've had
I agree, but was just expounding upon what hidden bull divs coupled with regular bear divs mean in a more abstract/market sentiment sense without reading as far into it as calling it accumulation or whatever. And we'll probably have a lot of similar occurrences on various scales, microtrends or macrotrends, on the way up - it occurred throughout 2017 as the bulls would get heavily overbought, sometimes forming a bear div -> correction forming a hidden bull div -> further move up when bulls start to regain momentum.
Yeah but...it's now, not a couple years ago 
what about compared to a few months ago?
3 years ago Bitcoin could have been stopped. 

Now...
I agree it isn't drawn nearly correctly. But the green bitfinex wick and bitmex wick (the giant 1m dump candle) both technically invalidate the pennant. 

I still see it as lower highs and higher lows
Plot Twist: There is a mysterious entity playing the stock market now, making fuck tons of money to buy up all electronics materials, crashing the usd seems to be related to ending america's military power; I for one welcome our new ai overlord
Thank you, i reappeared from my salt cave.
I do.. within 2-6 weeks.  I don't think this move up from log break is over quite yet.

In the immediate short term we may see a small pullback from $9.7.. but $10k is in striking range.. moving above it would likely bring enough enthusiasm for a $11.7k retest

All the other bubbles followed this kind of behavior... a 50% or greater rise in price from log break.. then a long period of consolidation/hovering while the market decided what to do next.  2014 was the only year that price made lower lows. 
Ya I agree, I'm glad we have guys like you not circle jerking the bull runs. 
I think this is a situation where you could wait for it to become a problem before you brute force a solution that might not be ideal. 

You have complete control over the data, so if somebody abuses the tool then you can simply lock them out of it — if you are so inclined. 
I actually see a lot of value in the data. 

If it caught on, you'd know the following at a glance:

1. What's the overall sentiment of /r/bitcoinmarkets right now? Long vs short ratio

2. As a collective, are traders on /r/bitcoinmarkets in the red or in the black?

3. what percentage of useres are lurking vs. actively sharing their trades?

4. Are the most successful traders the ones who hold for longer, or are scalpers doing better?

If someone starts doing exceptionally well I don't care who they are. 
Yup I agree. Plus, anyone on 100x isn't trading, they're gambling.

Also im fairly sure anyone opening a 100x position will be watching it like a hawk, not posting on reddit. 
Keep in mind, I'm more than willing to close this position at breakeven if I have to. It won't be a huge deal for me if I miss out on my existing profits. 

If that's not the case for you, and a drop to $8,800 would be devastating for you, then this is a pretty risky place to be holding a long.
I try to stick to what I know.
ETH could be declared a security on Monday. I don't think it will be just remember nothing remains the same. EOS now threaten ETH's value prop. Ripple is being sued and BTC is getting lightning, which threatens Ripple's value prop. Nothing repeats indefinitely.
I got the notification you sent 12$, so i think it's here (although never use it and will have to look into it later).
Thanks
I know it's less information, but what about NULL or N/A as the default? It's reduced data but reduced data is better than bad data.
Ok, thanks - please post when you're ready for that.
Cool thanks.  I'll give it a go on the next positions I open!
Lol I wish. I only made huge profits on that one short. And it only barely made up for a bunch of retarded trades I made before that. 

This one's already basically at breakeven 😭 
You can always ban them from using the tool. I think he can exclude people easily.

Good job. Better than taking a loss.
If I look at the YoY chart it sure does, especially compared to my IRAs, CDs and everything else in my portfolio.

You won't take money out of your IRA, but you will watch it waste away as your Bitcoin holdings save your butt.  That's my prediction.
probably, but imagine if bitcoin as a hedge to reduce exposure to your country's financial markets becomes a self-fulling prophecy...
Genesis block.  We won't even find out if Bitcoin works as intended until the traditional markets get themselves in a pickle again, which they will.
It works only if the difference in price you buy back in is low enough that it makes up for funding. For example, if I'm long 10BTC at 10,000 USD and funding is 1% then I'm paying .1BTC or 1,000 USD. If I close that, wait for funding to pass, the price spikes like we expect but as long as I buy back in below 10,100 (if the price moves 100 USD, at 10BTC I would have gained 1000 USD), then I end up saving money. 
More than the fees you receive...so it doesn't really work.. max is like 0.375% and lately features are 0.2-0.3%. open + close + settlement fee total is like 0.2% total...so I'm not sure how it's profitable, really 
The fees on Mex are negative if you limit buy/sell.
Yeah in terms of sentiment and "bearishness" that might be true, but from a technical perspective it's tough to call something a bear market when, at its worst, we were still up 600% year on year. In any other asset class it would be unthinkable to somehow frame that as bearish. Up 2000% and then down 70% is crazy but is it bearish? I dunno.
I've been looking for a beach house.  Do you take Bitcoin?
So 16k is still bear market?
thats ETH im talking about the entire alt market. ETH does its own thing half the time.
Where did I say I needed gravity proven to me?
Why? 

Don't they lose money by removing liquidity?

Also what do you think about the fact that lime 1.5k btc was added to the books down to $9.5k today on Bitfinex and 500 on GDAX
Thanks. What is the top and bottom charts of? Middle one is price I can figure out that much 😄
I can send you the source code without a problem, just think it's not the best source to go by.

It's my first time with python and my first reddit bot. The code i use is still py2 since its the most common available on web hosts. And it still needs a lot of work, exception handling and such.

I'll upload it somewhere and pm the link to you later.
Oh, maybe. I read the rest of the post as critical so I assumed this part was too. Can't tell really

the btc swap one that went from 9800 to 9300 last night.. only happened on bitmex.. no matching with reality.  I assume thats why you protect your orders with those lowball limit orders

Can't tell if you're being sarcastic but you're agreeing with me, yeah?
My viewpoint is more the opposite. Bullish untill about 14k and then looking to break new lows. I don't expect a new ath ever,  but that's a long time. 

the breaking of trend-lines shows momentum slowing, after long enough it will be flat and then reverse. But you could show this with any number of trendlines .

I'd call the chart I uploaded a bubble, because buy/sell relationship over time is the same. The drop from the ath to the bounce some week later might've appeared as the bubble pop, then the sideways action continued and it was really a precursor to a larger burst. Do you think it's possible that price is progressing in preparation of a bigger burst?

I feel alot of people seem to think further moves up are inevitable, to me that seems like somewhat of an echo of the "this time it's different" hysteria. 

Yeah. for me personally I just wouldn't trust a breakout but id trust a dump. You know what I mean?

For me it's like...where do we go after $12k? This thing really gonna go to $20k+?! This fast? Just seems bonkers 
I think so but i'm pretty sceptical about this run. If it continues past 10k I still think it could come back down fast. 
https://www.tradingview.com/x/VhihW8h8
I still can't comprehend how the market always paints the charts to be so ambiguous all the time.
new ATH is all 

Maybe I should stop seeing it that way and just trade this retarded thingy 
I mean, I sort agree? I have a pretty comfy entry right now but I definitely have one eye on the exit at all times and am fully prepared to hedge back to USD.

But then part of me is also kind of like "BTC has done crazier things."

I *definitely* think it's kind of moon boyish to be calling for 4k BTC at this juncture though. It's definitely still not out of the question, but calling it *now* is crazily speculative. Predicting a revisit to the low 8ks or something, sure. Maybe seems unlikely but so does breaking 11.8k. And then if 8k doesn't hold and then 6k breaks? Definitely could see 4k.

There's so many things that would have to happen for that though... Idk, doesn't seem realistic *atm* to think like that.

No Sir, fully hedged. Up or down, I'm riding the wave.
what's your take on okex #1 position being liquidated?
One time you closed a position and there was none open and the last one was missing a parameter so it also ignored the post.

For now i only posted the success messages, will be adding some now with errors / invalid parameters.
None so far, give me 20 minutes and that should be taken care of.

I mean as long as they don't credit your account with BCH then it doesn't sound too bad.
It's not a bad idea, could allow for later sorting by exchange and to cross check prices from the exchange while not changing the syntax.

I'm trying to keep it as simple and short as possible.
Yes, that should work. 

Try it and if it works great, if not let me know so i can see how to help.

!long xbtm18 close 9600
Do you trade both when you post your positions or are you mainly on swaps? 
I probably don't understand the significance of this. Maybe large clients are nervous and trading their USDT for USD?
I get what you're saying. Interesting links, thanks. 
We misunderstood each other. I believe BTC will reach a new ATH much faster than it took it to reach Nov 2013 peak (1K) again. I hope to see 20K this year again, as do most people I guess. 
No, I believe targets for patterns aren't log related, it's flat $ amount. So a $5700 range in the triple top would mean a $5700 drop from $6000

I really doubt we'd get there but really, a triple top at $11.7k with confirmation below $6k *would* be disastrous. 

A triple bottom started the bull run in 2015, a triple top would be about equally bearish as that was bullish 
No, I actually mean $300. 

The formula for the target of a triple top breakdown is:

Neckline value - (top of formation - neckline value) = target

So $6,000 - ($11,700 - $6,000) = $300

Like I said, $300 is just a "by the books" breakdown target. It's more than a bit absurd.
If you're freaking out just set a stop loss in profit or take some profit now and don't look at the charts for a bit. Set alarms for $10.3k. 

You're a girl huh :p 
Still better volume than any Dow stock.
December is a horrible baseline.  I ignore it except as Bitcoin flexing its muscles and showing us what it can/will do.  Draw lines either from Early November or February.
I'm not saying this is the case right now, but if bitcoin just becomes a token for fatcats to bet on, it would be deader than we ever could have imagined.
Salt cave.  Lol.  Classic.  
But we do agree that there is no way that was the bear market, no?

It feels like if that was it, this was just too easy.
I just hope I don't miss it :P

I'm doing my best not to get liquidated before it happens, lol.

I'm very slowly turning bullish. I need to be able to switch it up- it's better for finding good entries. If I always think like a bear I will never want to long (which I haven't) and I miss out on tons of gains. Especially the gains from the next bull run :P

I have thought of just setting aside money for cold storage and using 10% as trading stack. right now all I have is my trading stack. It would be an actual *investment* you know? I would be much more comfortable with it
That is my approach so far, putting it to work first and solve problems later
I care cause you can get lucky in couple trades in a row. If guy is tossing a coin then I won't follow.
This reminds me of our disagreement over Warren Buffet. If the user pool gets big enough, probability dictates that someone *absolutely will* start to do exceptionally well, and it will look completely non-random, whether it is or isn't. That doesn't mean that following them is the right idea or will pay off.

Small example: for a very long time shorting VIX futures was the right idea, and then suddenly it wasn't, and the funds doing it went under in a single day.
yes I'm definitely aware of that too. I will probably close mine at 9500 at breakeven and long again somewhere in between this range a few more times with tight stops. 
Just out of curiosity, once this thing goes to 11.7k and pulls back, do you plan on holding your long down till 9800? 
Great!

Yeah, since it's BCH, you should probably just disregard it entirely. :)
I need those values to calculate the final PnL of the entire stack. If they are not mentioned it will fail in the end.
Actually it should work as long as the thread has the Word daily on it. Will try it later or you can do it 
With great power comes great responsibility. And I don't want that responsibility :). 

I realize that a certain number of people do follow my trades when I post them, but they're the ones pulling the trigger ultimately. 

I'm fine being indirectly responsible for somebody's losses, but I don't want to be directly responsible for them.
I think I misread your original comment. 

I've probably received maybe 10 requests in 3 years from people asking me to essentially serve as a broker and make trades for them. 

Nobody has ever requested the reverse though (where I give them btc and they trade for me).
Can't lose money if you win every trade :)
It would be incredible, yes. Unfortunately no one know how the btc market would react to a bearish stock market. It'd be interesting to say the least 
A currency collapse is an interesting scenario. Hyperinflation is a whole different ballgame, and BTC could certainly benefit there. I can't imaging that occurring to a major currency, though (USD/EUR/GBP/etc), and if it did, you better believe the convenient onramps to BTC in those countries would meet the boot of the state in question. 
Well yes, I understand how the math works. if everyone else is doing it though you're not only going to get a worse price, you're going to pay a bunch of fees.
that was literally the start (after the initial dump) of the bear market
ETH was doing the same thing as the overwhelming majority of the alt market at the time.
no they make use of illiquidiity to move the chart easier. Pull orderbook liquidity and use it to bruteforce into the orderbook you left with holes etc. Opening a 2x700 btc long helps to get where you want to get, before pulling buyside liquidity and closing the 1400btc longs into it and getting where you want to be next. However that was probably this MM showing his fangs, by defining a range to other players. 
Awesome cheers dude. I'm pretty well versed in python2 but it's something I tend to pick up, learn a few libraries for a task and then not use for a while. Code looks easy enough to understand though. FYI not sure how much data scraping your doing but I used beautiful soup with lxml library for DOM querying/parsing and it's really a piece of piss. Congrats on getting your first python project up and going though that's awesome, great first project. 

I've been thinking of building a trading dashboard to host on my rPI using Django, BS4 for data aggregation from multiple sources and linking BFX API and bitmex API's so I can submit trades. Like I said though I've been lazy AF the last year or so but if I get it up and running I'll post it here for you and anyone else to use. If I can get write a good BTC news aggregation I was thinking of writing a bot for here with links to news stories as they come out with a summary. Just need to pull my head out and get back into the swing of using python. Thanks again for the code!
It's my first bot so i'm still learning and probably not doing it the best way. Will look into showing at least an average of the PnL of past positions when a new position is open.
Ya, anybody short who had stops set prior to the Big Green Candle should be very thankful they did so. 

Anybody long on the perpetual swaps in the past 12 hours who set "reasonable" stops below $9,350 got fucked hard.

Hahaha I like how you combined both words basically

It's par for the course if you're going to trade on Bitmex or Okex. 
Bitcoin usually moves fast...seems to be more the norm than slow, controlled movements.
Eh $4k is like 9 months ago man :p it's really not crazy.

You sure are. You have done a fantastic job with the BitcoinMarkets Open Positions webpage!

>  :) I had 7 or 8 bad trades in a row...

I am sure you will pick up on trading as well. Try to avoid the similar actions/errors you've made in your past 7 or 8 trades. I had a good previous trade (11.15% gains). But this one's been pain in the arse so far. uhh.


I've actually never traded swaps. I generally stick to the quarterlies. 
Ya, it would be abandon ship time for a lot of long-term investors. 

Recovering from that would not be an overnight accomplishment. It could be months or even years before the market made it's way back above $11,700 if it's rejected again and falls below $6,000 to complete the pattern.
Just realised that I already set alarms, I forgot about them... duh, sorry.  And here I was stressing for nothing 
It's really too early to know for certain... OP is suggesting we have another leg down to 144EMA on the weekly which would make for an extended bear market. 

Other bear cycles had more precipitous drops in terms of percentage... sort of got it all out of the way quickly

I think a lot of us are scared by the long 2014/2015 winter and are expecting more pain... but it's obviously a different environment today.  That being said, it doesn't mean price won't make lower lows.  

Personally I'd feel more confident in the bear market being over if we were seeing a wellspring of new use cases for crypto, but I think we're still a few years away from this and so the market continues to be mostly propped up on speculation.  

Lastly, I think bears often underestimate the ability for speculation to keep prices higher than FA would suggest. 
It lasted from December - Mid April lol. You think that was easy?
Sure but you can make that judgment on your own. If I see someone make 20 trades and is pretty profitable idc who he is. I'm paying attention 
I'd argue the chances of that happening are slim to none, considering Warren Buffet is one out of 7 billion whereas here it'd be 1 out of what 5,000? 

The chances of performing exceptionally well purely by luck are very slim. 

In which case I would be wary, actually.. Personally I'd follow someone with a decent amount of losses that they closed early on good risk management. I'd probably end up looking for people with 40-60% win rates who have a lot of trades over time but are fairly profitable. 
Ah, I see.
Ok thanks I will try it.

edit: Looks like the altcoin discussion does not contain that word.
Lol, gotcha.  I figured you would have been contacted.
You're a much better trader than I if you win every time.
Fees are negative on Mex and I do and have bought back in at a price that would save me money.

Edit: Ah, but I think I understand what you are saying. That this is just not a thing that everyone does so we shouldn't expect the price to spike after funding. That's possible, but that doesn't make sense to pay the fees when clearly you don't have to as I have. So I'm sure I'm not the only one. Maybe not a majority do it but I wouldn't be surprised if a large % do.
Surely if 16k was DBC 20k was the start of the bear market. Best wait till we get there before you buy in.
So what makes you think this is the top? 
[deleted]
cme didnt fluctuate 500$.  Funny how that is.. a regulated exchange must not have the same 'market forces'.


I mean, a lot can happen in 9 months with crypto. Just think people get a little ahead of themselves. I guess I'm just a little more conservative with how insane I expect things to get while paradoxically trying to recognize that *something* insane could very likely happen. I'm much more of a "one step at a time" type of guy, especially in this uncertain market. More of a let's see 9.2k break, then 8.8k, then 8.5k, then 8k, before seriously considering a lower low type of person, ya know? I'm the same way with upside movements too. 11.8k is a pipe dream to me atm, first want to see 9.8k then 10.2k then 11k break.

That's not to say I'm going to scalp at all those points, more so that I try not to let my emotions cloud my judgement. For instance, if we do fall off here, I'd hate missing on buying back in on a strong bounce at 8k with 6k truly ending up being the low point just because I was waiting for a 4k that never came. 

Like sure, 4k is a *possibility*. But right now it's an unlikely one imo. It sure as hell could turn into a likely one quickly though, and that's the fun part about crypto. 

I know you aren't calling for 4k yet, but my original response was to someone who was.

Since i allow multiple pairs, the only restriction i can put is that the value must be greater than 0 and less than 25000 (so far, once bitcoin rises i'll change the limit)

Everytime we get optimistic again, the market shows it's true bearish face. Do you think we really are done, with this disgusting 9k price action? Why is it so volatile? Don't you wonder why the chart became a mess? That's because of the massive unrolling/unlevering of positions/portfolio's. 
Oh my sweet winter '18 child...
That's why you should let people fill their history, if someone is cheating you'll know and he'll be banned from this tool.
> Personally I'd follow someone with a decent amount of losses that they closed early on good risk management.

That makes sense.
Updated the bot. It now works with Altcoin Discussion. For now the real time PnL will be way off because it will compare to BTC price.
The most decimal places i have is 4, so it's limited for now to the more expensive alts.
Haha I lose so often, but if I won every time I'd be very very wealthy
I have been holding Bitcoin since 2011. I have sold more Bitcoin in my life than you can ever dream to own
I have a field in the database that is reserved for the stack % after the position is closed. 

For example, if i open a position with 5x leverage, use 50% stack and i get 1% PnL, for the first position closed will be 100% (initial value) * (1 + 0.01 * 5 * 0.5) = 102.5 % (increased 2.5% from the initial stack)

On the second trade, assuming its the same result would give:
102.5 *  (1 + 0.01 * 5 * 0.5) = 105.0625 % (like you were saying).

I can post only the difference from 100%, in these cases 2.5% and 5.0625%.
Will try and set this field to start calculating to show this ROI on each position entry / update / close.
All it takes for an exchange to fluctuate wildly is a single actor with enough btc (or fiat) available to tear through the orderbook. 

A thin orderbook helps too. 

With $100,000 worth of btc at 100x leverage, I'd say it would be pretty trivial to drop the June contracts 5% (provided you timed it when the spot market was already making a small decline). 

But you'd be saying goodbye to that $100,000, as you'd be almost immediately liquidated on the bounce. 
>cme didnt fluctuate 500$.  Funny how that is.. a regulated exchange must not have the same 'market forces'.

CME has less than 1% of the daily volume of Bitmex, with a much larger minimum order size and substantial difference in available leverage. More than just a regulatory difference. 

I like to trade on longer time frames so I try to catch the exact bottoms and tops within 5%. So far I actually have some pretty amazing entries all things considered. Ive had a bearish bias since about $13k but so far that hasn't exactly been unprofitable. Calling for $6k from $11.7k sounded stupid and too premature but that's pretty much what I did lol.

And I soooort of get what you're saying about the first few sentences but...it really is kinda contradictory. :p if you can see $20k happening, you can see $4k ya know 
I would suggest:

1. the price is 24h range +/- 50 dollars

2. leverage is <100 and >0

3. percentage of stack is <100% and >0

Well we went through a 4 month downtrend and just broke log resistance a couple weeks ago... so yes, I think we'll continue heading up in the short term. 

Are we out of the bear market?  I have no idea... won't know for sure if/until $20k breaks.

If history repeats we'll see $12k-ish by EOM, then consolidation along with associated volatility drop... by the end of the summer the market (1.618 fib on your chart), we should know if the market wants to resume the bull or head back towards $3k-$5k

Of course these are my back-of-the-napkin predictions.  I'll be trading whatever the market actually does in any case. 
Well, 'grats on the small gain today.  It's a super tough market to short right now.
Well done
more volume = less variance.  chewtoy's answer was correct.
lower liquidity, all else being equal would lead to larger, not smaller spikes.
the reason is the maximum effective order size is larger on bitmex, with the leverage.
But still, large players should be accumulating/dispersing not doing those large moves unless they're stophunting.




I'm right there with you trying to trade longer time frames and I've been bearish since the same point but flipped to short/medium term bullish post BGD and log ATH breaking. Waffling now on switching back to bearish.

But like for example, while I held in my mind that 6k *could* happen from 11.7k, I kept that as just one of many possible outcomes. Ended up scalping from 7.2k -> ~8.8k when we rose to 9k, then reselling (with a few other bad entries in between from flip flopping). In the end, I was right there ready to buy back in on the most recent low with the same amount of fiat as when I sold originally.

My main trading philosophy is to try to get a good entry on a medium term move and hold it to see if it turns into a long term one, maybe with some short term scalps/hedges along the way for risk management. For instance, if this pennant we're in breaks down, I'll probably hedge to fiat, set break even/slight loss stops, and see what happens at 9.2 then 8.8. If those break I'll see what happens at 8k, and plan to buy in at the first sign of life while keeping in mind it *could* be heading below 6k.

I could *see* a lot of different things happening. But I try to limit myself to taking action on what *is* happening.

And trading is stressful so at some point I want to have a nice comfy entry for a long term hold.

Edit: sorry for the wall of text. Hard to explain my view, but in the end it amounts to moving with the market and not predicting it while trying to limit trades and get longer term entries

For point 1 i needed to check the price of all the pairs possible. Imagine someone using Futures, or Swaps, or ETHBTC for example.

Some pairs are only available on specific exchanges. It could be done if i restricted this to BTC prices.
Added some restrictions. You can test in yesterdays thread, it doesn't have to be this one.

Sorry, not trying to be a dick. Just a lot of people mix up being cautious or rational with being salty. I'm not salty, I'm just very careful calling this a healthy recovery. I just hope noone gets banned.
Unfortunately I'm an asshole :3
