[Daily Discussion] Monday, April 30, 2018 -- TITLE
#New post: [\[Daily Discussion\] Tuesday, May 01, 2018 →](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8g5owl/daily_discussion_tuesday_may_01_2018/)
4/30/18 UPDATE. It’s been five days since my last update on [4/25/18 PM]( https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8eqr52/daily_discussion_wednesday_april_25_2018/dxyoabr/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=user&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=frontpage). I offered four scenarios for BTC guidance in the ultra-short to short term. We’ve actually done a pretty good job staying within that range, mostly staying between the Uber Bull and Bull Lite cases (you’ll see this on the charts below). Despite this, I more or less got slammed by not offering a bear case, which I tried to explain [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8eqr52/daily_discussion_wednesday_april_25_2018/dxyqxu3/). I remain mixed on whether to hedge with a bear case (or a vice versa a bull case when I provide several bearish scenarios) but would like to hear what you all think on the topic.

The reason I am prematurely updating my 4/25/18 forecast is due to our actions over the past few days and how that’s translating to some of the indicators I use to monitor the market. I am shifting to neutral to moderately bearish in the short term and will be looking to lock in profits on some of my BTC, ETH and some of my other alts in the next 24-48 hours. This is not to indicate I am exiting the market entirely, I just believe we are due for a major move in one direction or the other and it *feels* likely that that direction is more likely to be downward.

Here are the updates to my chart: I have added three new lines (all of them are thick). The pink line is a new downtrend from the ATH with two points of contact (4/25, 4/29). The two bright blue lines are the immediate support. I normally don’t cut off wicks, but in the case of the aqua line I did because I consider the massive market buys/sells from 4/28/18 08:00:00 to be the one off actions of a single investor (whether it’s a whale, a hedge fund or an algo testing liquidity). That said, I have also included a version that does not cut off the wicks in a slightly darker blue. While I have kept the 4/25/18 scenario arrows in bright green, the broader channel (which was black) and the ascending wedge (which was purple) are now both grey.

Here are my charts along with four new scenarios.     
Here’s the [macro view](https://www.tradingview.com/x/D9bZcOMI/).     
Here’s the [channel view](https://www.tradingview.com/x/4a1vIigh/).     
Here’s the [zoomed in view](https://www.tradingview.com/x/nHbEZwgs/).     

**Bull Case:** We decisively break through the pink line ($9,470-$9,360 depending on time frame) in the next 48 hours, while staying within the immediate channel (support indicated by the aqua line). This would indicate that the market has accumulated and is now ready to continue moving in an upward fashion to likely test $10,000+ in the next 5-7 days. Please note, if we do this, I plan to accumulate in the $9,500 range if this happens.     
*Probability of Occurring: 20%*     

**Sideways Case:** We maintain sideways movement puncturing the pink line on 5/3-5/4, but in the process of doing so, we drop out of the immediate channel while staying within the broader channel (support indicated by the bright blue line). This would indicate the market does not have enough conviction to break through the resistance, but still does not turn into a full bear trend.     
*Probability of Occurring: 35%*     

**Bear Case:** We fail to pierce the pink resistance line and drop out of both the immediate channel and the broader channel on 5/3-5/4. This isn’t doom and gloom but it means the market needs further time to consolidate before meaningful, upward growth can continue. There are two black lines of support, but I don’t know how well these would hold if they were truly tested with serious volume in a downturn.     
*Probability of Occurring: 25%*     

**Uber Bear Case:** We decisively sell off, falling out of the immediate channel and the broader channel within the next 48 hours. This would be bearish as it means the market needs to pull back and all supports since 4/9 would be called into question. The hope would be that the market stays above the light grey line (~$8,028) as that is the original ATH downward resistance channel.     
*Probability of Occurring: 20%*     

There's two formations I'm watching in the short term, and unfortunately neither of them are super compelling. They both require cutting off wicks and essentially ignoring the jump from $9,500 to $9,750:

https://imgur.com/a/rTGuAt0

This is one of those cases where the resistance line is less clear than the support line, so I'd be hesitant to open a fresh long following a "breakout," as the breakout wouldn't really be clear until the market makes a new higher local high above $9,750.

The support line is far clearer, however. And I'd consider closing my long if it breaks down with any conviction. If $8,600 falls I'd potentially open a short, but we'll see how the market behaves if/when it starts moving down into that zone.
I'm so bad at trading, i can't even buy high sell low, because i never get to sell, i just get liquidated.

Scalp long from $8880.  Looking for 50% retrace to ~$9100

the "trading" space of crypto is turning into a bunch of morons that like pretty pictures and arrogant fools. Man, how do people actually think these guys are insightful?
the long/short differential is starting to close.. market sentiment getting a bit more bearish

The monthly candle just closed.


After an absurdly boring and low volume weekend for BTC, we sit very nearly where we did Friday morning at this time. The one bit of good news over the weekend was that BTC made a higher high off the 9380 high of Thursday. Still, Wednesday's high of 9800 still stands in the way of continuation.

Our upward channel was breached this morning slightly (wicked on the 4H), but reversed 1% below it and we're trickling upwards again. Volume is up slightly from the weekend, but not markedly so. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/Nl5OM1gW/

We're going to have to definitively continue climbing in a hurry today, or else we'll break out of our 3-week uptrend channel. A break below 8900 at this point would be a little alarming, and that's where I'd be looking to exit my long position.

I wasn't really active over the weekend, but I hopped into a position at 9280, de-risked at 9420, added at 9350, then had some lower adds execute at 9190 and 9240. I de-risked some more this morning when I saw the channel faltered overnight, but I'm currently CA @ 9250 on June futures with room to add. 

Good luck all. 
Getting bored again by this market chopping around this range. So here goes another **gambling short @ 9250** with stops around 9450 to spice up the waiting time
Oh noes, the prophet has spoken: https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/ETsf4M8H-Midterm-picture-looks-bearish/
Currently sitting out having scalped a short this morning.

We’ve made the first lower high since the big drop last Wednesday. Key now is to hold 9.2k to prevent a lower low and then try and make a push above 9.5k.

Current strategy: Long above 9450, short below 9200 with trailing stops either side.
When I had mentioned [yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8fp2ur/daily_discussion_sunday_april_29_2018/dy5te04/) about having submitted verification documents to Bitfinex (mainly to be able to send USDT), a number of people warned about long waiting times.

So, quick update: I just received an email from their compliance folks — i.e. within 1 day.

They told me all docs are fine except for the selfie photo (which requires you to hold an ID, plus a text note that includes the date and a signature). And well – I did in fact forget to add my signature on the text note.

With the response time of 1 day, and with their very specific follow-up request there is little to complain about so far.
Retesting the previous uptrend line (rejected immediately upon touch just now)

https://www.tradingview.com/x/E7ZYVlTX/
Closed my short from 9400 at 9000. Will re-short the bounce unless it is magical 

Edit: sorry, forgot to give my reasons. RSI is too low from 15 min to the hour, and this is meme support, so should bounce. Basically just going to try to scalp a better re-entry after the channel breakdown. I’m expecting a confirmation of support turned resistance
Looking at the 6 month chart, where do you think we're headed from here long term? We've been slowly but surely heading downward from ATH since January. There have been small recovery bumps every now and then but they're lower each time, which I took as very bearish. But we seem to have leveled out a bit now, and I think this is the first time i've felt that we *may* even look to be starting a slow upward trend (looking at the last 3-4 weeks)? I'd draw a chart but am on the work computer. 

Thoughts?

Could someone ELI5 the new bitmex up contract? I seriously don't get it. Thanks
Exited my 9250 long from this morning, here at 9220. I had my stop loss set at the breakdown of this sym triangle (~9170), but decided to go ahead and close for a smaller loss instead. Market seems weak to me. That's a mix of TA and experience.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/fEmOt6HD/

Edit: I'll definitely be going long again if we break 9400 with volume. 
The fact that it held above 9k over the weekend and has been setting higher lows for week is far more bullish than over analysing micro movements on smaller timeframes. 

This is where common sense needs to be mixed with TA in order to see the woods for the trees

Venezuela offers India crude oil on 30% discount - only if it agrees to pay in cryptocurrency

Wow, it's news like these which are significant in this sector. Have we ever had a G2G cryptocurrency request before? 
This selling is beyond pathetic. Impress me bears or get out of the way, the fight at 12k should be actually interesting.
Is anyone scared by this?  Looks like normal testing of support to me.  Going to try and grab an entry around the bottom and take profits on the rebound, bad idea?  Eyeing 9200~.  RSI is in the 30s.

Edit:  Kraken only made it down to 9210, so my limit didn't hit.  I have a feeling that ship has sailed.
So is that pennant that everyone was screaming about breaking down?
Here's what I'm looking at; https://www.tradingview.com/x/tfiAZxFM/

Closed my trading stack an hour ago, I'd rather be out than in right now. 
For those like me scalping right now, Quarterlies is the one to watch. 450K+ contract ask wall at $9K pushed this last leg of the dump and turned out to not have been a spoof...almost chewed through now, 175K left. Should pop a bit if it's eaten. Might get your 50% retrace then.
Hello all. 

The multi lane channel I posted a few days ago is currently [breaking](https://www.tradingview.com/x/N49RYxEa/). I'm not verry worried and still bullish. Perhaps it's just a wick, or maybe the bottom of the channel is a bit lower like [this](https://www.tradingview.com/x/BI4xAcL6/), or maybe it's not valid at all.

Anyway we're still making higher low. Current formation looks like a [symmetrical triangle] (https://www.tradingview.com/x/NFq0d16e/) or an [ascending triangle](https://www.tradingview.com/x/8tecxzsk/) if you don't count the FOMO parabolic advance to 9.7k. Or maybe it's [bigger](https://www.tradingview.com/x/EvLaAmbq/) than that?

Sorry for the uninformative post I guess. At least short term the 4h cloud is acting as support and we just had a bullish TK cross: https://www.tradingview.com/x/tKzqml2p/.


So I was comparing the 2014 bear market with the current one and I noticed something.

This is the weekly log resistance of 2014. The price broke through it in may after a round bottom (not unlike what we're experiencing now), but it lost momentum and continued the downtrend juste above the logline until 2015.

* https://www.tradingview.com/x/WSOgOCWY/

However, if you draw this logline on the monthly (weekly in black, monthly in blue), you can see that the moment the price broke through this monthly resistance was much more indicative of the start of a new bull market.

* https://www.tradingview.com/x/BNq1kjiZ/


Now if we were to apply the same logic to the current bear market.
We definitevely broke through the weekly resistance.

* https://www.tradingview.com/x/VMGZxsvj/   

But we are not even close to touching the monthly, and actually the monthly candle barely touched the weekly logline. 

* https://www.tradingview.com/x/ycwJkpRf/


So it this any indication on how the price is going to behave? I have no idea, but I thought it was interesting. 



Hi!
We have launched Bitcoin Open Interest report recently. It is based on CME and CBOE reports. Updated weekly.  https://bitgur.com/chart/interest . It can be interesting for thoughtful traders. Tell me if something unclear. We will add more explanations. 


Somehow it wasnt until i draw it that i saw a interesting correlation (which may be casual) with the price pre pump :

If 9150 breaks right now, do you see a bounce slightly above 9k?
I almost never write there although I love reading this sub, one of the most respectful and less-biased. 

I don't write there because my TA skills are limited and my english is not native. Therefore, I'll try to stay within the rules but I'm quite sure that what will follow is more a sentiment than an argument. So, downvote me if you want, I can deal with it.

I usually don't short bitcoin (with margin), especially because I'm long term bullish and because I'm not comfortable with this kind of move. 

Still, I'm currently short because I really don't feel that there's enough people to push this further right now. I know that organic purchases or sells are not the reason to big moves, that's why I don't really give attention to volume. With bitcoin (but not with alts), volume comes as a confirmation after a move. 

Fundamentals have not changed, it's a fact. But it's not a negative opinion. Bitcoin is still a great asset. Yet, it doesn't mean that the crypto market has great fundamentals, besides bitcoin or monero. There's still a lot of vaporwave and the goal of this game is still accumulating a lot of bitcoin. The thing is most of people now know that. The next bitcoin is still bitcoin and since a lot of people have been burnt with alts and ICO promises, a lot of them probably won't risk the same amount of money in alts. (I guarantee this is not an alt topic). 

What I'm saying is that a month ago, bitcoin was at 6K or 7k, a lot of people cried because it was way less than in December but honestly, it was still way more than last year. What has really changed since last month ? Nothing. Just whales moves able to shake the market and push it up after three months down.

We all know that exchanges create themselves most of their volume, it's an illusion, we all know that bitmain create itself the price of bch, it's an illusion, we all know that a lot of icos still have a lot of coins to dump, etc... and a single actor is able to move the market in a direction with a single move.

It's the first time I'm really bearish (about the price), I should have been before but I was naive, but I'm still thinking : I have bought bitcoin at 150$ and I'm far from being the only one. I still want cheap coins but I'm far from being the only one, the only difference is that there's people with way more money than me able to push it down. We are now 9X the price of last year, it's still an amazing price. We moved from 6k in a month : it's still an amazing push. But why have we moved ? What's the reason ? I can't find one.

The mining can be more expensive but miners always adapt. Will bitcoin be way more expensive in two years, probably. But is it now ? I really don't think so, although it hurts me to say that. 

I'm really sorry because I don't want to mess with you with such speculation and sentiment and I know I will be targeted for this but I just wanted to share it with you because it's one of the last space with real brains on crypto subs. 

CFTC Chair Giancarlo is retiring, introducing an element of uncertainty if his successor is less crypto-friendly.
Could we maybe see a double bottom at 9200? I'll be watching this closely but right now it isn't looking very good.


**EDIT**: *Nope* looks like we aren't gonna see a double bottom.
Looks like we're up against the [rising (bright green) support line](https://www.tradingview.com/x/BReyrkHY/). We've wicked below before on the 2h. A solid breakdown to ~9000 would probably mean a trend reversal?
Bitfinex FRR for USD well over 50% annualised. This is not healthy and indicates a shortage of cash to fuel longs.

I am concerned.
How on earth are [longs](https://www.tradingview.com/x/v421PcSO/) still so much higher than [shorts](https://www.tradingview.com/x/cXCguqs2/)? TA is an interesting way to help make predictions or analyze the past, but no matter what the charts say right now, I’m just still not convinced we’re out of this bear market yet. Call me a dreamer, but I’m *still* calling for sub $6k. I’m not going to be a sucker for these whale games. They’re going to try to make us believe what supports the narrative they want to see. This whole BGD pump feels like straight up bullshit (no pun intended).

u/xbtmike hey did you still have your position open? :)
If we get a strong bounce at $8900 or $8700, I think we might still have a shot at going up higher in the next week.

But if we breakdown through these support levels...

Model price based on tx rate: 7-day average: $5220, 28-day average: $4577.

 Model price = 10^-0.638 \* (tx per day)^2.181 / # total coins.

Explanation is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2hyl9c/daily_discussion_wednesday_october_01_2014/ckxhy9y) with [historical graphs of price vs. model](https://i.imgur.com/HnZQ9rv.png) (last updated 2018-04-09) and [graphs of other correlations](http://imgur.com/a/7koaG) (last updated 2017-01-30). The code is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2oyrfq/code_for_tx_model/) if you want to improve on it.


**Accuracy of model and recent bearishness**

 Note, that this model has been doing relatively well if it is within *the same order of magnitude* of the price. That is to say, it is not a very accurate predictor of price, and to be within a factor of two of the market price (as recently) is effectively no strong signal. However, the prediction did dip just before the recent pop.

**Batching, UTXO count and so on.**

I have seen no convincing evidence that batching is currently a major effect to reduce the daily tx rate, and a cursory examination shows a similar dip in the UTXO network measure.
I am interested, long term, in alternatives to tx rate (given lightning etc) but I do not think UTXO count is a convincing alternative over, for example, unique addresses.
Parsing the blockchain directly for outputs per block is one possible alternative to deal with batching, payment channels notwithstanding.

Tone Vays still calling for 3K BTC



Just goes to show you... even the best traders (he's pretty good) get it dead wrong (knock on wood, but [A&E](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DcDgvLNV4Awd_CL.jpg) looking real strong).... and even when they're wrong they stubbornly stick to their initial view, convincing themselves the *market* is wrong. (Ie [MagicPoopCannon](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/sd34bWHf-I-Wrote-A-Lot-and-You-Should-Read-it-BITCOIN-BTC/) on tradingview)... got popular w/ a few good calls in the bear market, but has been dead wrong since the price left 7K and still believes his H&S is valid. This is why you don't follow anyone, there's no expert in this market. Stick to your gut, and if all else fails just buy Bitcoin and shut the fuck up. By the way, they can still end up being right IF we fail between 11-12K, anything before that bears are grasping at straws

Looking at the daily chart, I'm seeing downward trend, hidden bearish div, declining volume, similar rounded bottom precursor to previous DCBs, declining OBV.

What's the likelihood that the last 2 weeks are a dead cat bounce topping out?


(basically a shitpost)  I'm watching the same large channel as everyone else, and I'm getting the vibe that we might just be meandering in no-man's-land for the next day or two before there's any definitive movement. Preparing for a pretty boring day today.

Rising wedge played out. I think we bounce from near the green line to near the red line. https://imgur.com/a/rCwFQEG

Fair play there is a lot of panic in this thread.  One drop of $150 and people start rolling out low 8000s or lower as a target.
[removed]
Hedging now that we've lost 9200 level with conviction. 
I think it's safe to say the next few weeks are critical for bitcoin. We'll probably chop sideways for a while, and if this bubble plays out like 2013/2014 the breakout will decide if we're beginning a new bubble. The bear in me wants to stop my dca buys but I've been looking at the 10 to 260 bubble for the bullish perspective. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/OltldTpB/
The whales did it.  Major long squeeze in action.  This will be fun to watch.
let’s touch 9.1, go long and bounce to 10k by the weekend. 

E. If 9.1 falls I’m out til 8.7. good thing it won’t 
Is it just me ??? Bitmex seems really fucked up today. Impossible to see the order book , chat not working etc....

Just looking at the charts, didn't an almost identical fall occur at almost exactly the same time yesterday too?
Target Reach [on trade posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8fhion/daily_discussion_saturday_april_28_2018/dy59rxc/) here so short closed. Will update post with new picture shortly.

Update: https://www.tradingview.com/x/tf2ErhgP/

Will try and keep it simple, a confirmed reversal here would pretty much confirm a W4 triangle setting up for a final W5 before the larger overall correction. The way the selloff and rally were forming started to confirm my suspicion that it was going to be a triangle rather than a larger correction. I have noted some of these on the chart.

Target a W4 triangle would take us too could be from 10300 (Measured Move) to 10600 (Extension and Fib Retrace). Until the triangle completes it will be hard to know but buying the breakout on that one is likely the smartest move with the warning a we still need that larger correction.
I had almost given up on my $8750 limit order. Now I'm hopeful. Come on bears! Come to papa, baby! Would be awesome to wake up with more Bitcoin tomorrow.
looks like we might have a [reverse A&E](https://i.imgur.com/9EYv3HE.png) forming.
This is like the 3rd time we've bounced off $9100 - $9200 in the past 24 hours. Bullish pattern but it's such a small time frame so I'm not giving it too much weight.

I'm starting to think this still may not be the real rally and another trip down to 6k is needed before the next leg up. Hope that I'm completely and utterly wrong about that though.
Not trying to fud, but, after hanging out in the 9k range, unable to break 9700, realistically this could play out like 2014 and go back down once more to sub 7-6k. I think it is a high probability 
With multiple all-stars coming on to mainstream media saying that the bitcoin bear market is over, how likely is it that they're actually trying to trigger a minor rally to get out of underwater positions?
In my opinion, a double bottom at 8900 is likely.


8900 is actually a pretty important horizontal level. We've either bounced from there or hovered there several times the last couple weeks.
Although I have sold all my positions, I can't help but to think that the 9100 level is very hard to break and that I might wake up to $9300 BTC..
Sorry for offtopic.  
Doing my taxes right now and I'm not really sure how I would calculate the tax for my bitmex trades.. Does anyone have an example of how they did theirs?

Quick question about margin trading on Bitfinex. 

It seems like all trades are leveraged 3.3x. Is there a way to only do 1x trades (shorts) ? It seems like they do not allow that?
I am wondering if the ATH resistance line can now act as support where it is about 7900. Seems to be a logical area to retest support.

Edit: 7900 on the daily Bitfinex chart
The symmetrical triangle we were in just broke down. The measured move for that 8.1-8.3k. There is support at 8.4 so it may not make it down there that far but I expect to see that target within the next few days.
How to know when a bounce is legit?

I'm not trying to troll,  but I see a lot of TA on this board. Wouldn't a computer do a better job of TA given that it can process all past data so much faster and doesn't have the cognative biases and emotional decision making of a person? 

I'd be happy to read any articles that contradict my assumption.
All bearish posts with logic are getting downvoted right now... Who else knows what that means?
Sold at $9,150, looking to rebuy at ~$8,800.

Seems we've hit a top for now and we firmly left the upwards channel initiated by the BGD. Will retest former support levels, perhaps even as low as $7,800 (but too early for that, first let's see if we can get to 8,800).
Who is shorting BTC at this point? Surely that’s a crazy  move given the current trend lines etc...

Seems to me that the only people trying to drive price down are those trying to accumulate more

wtf cme futures premiums through the roof who's buyin?

Someone bought up 500btc right on 9300 in the last 20mins or so on finex. Saw one order go through for 308 corns. Market Buy/Sell volume was roughly equal all night until those orders went through. Wonder what his end game is.
Aaaand... another round bottom forming. 

The fun begins when this dumper covers because he definitely borrowd a lot of those coins.

This descending triangle seem legit?  https://imgur.com/qntoDWS  Doesn't seem quality, but my gut is saying to listen to it.
Currently short from 9445, take profit buy set at 9067, then laddered long orders starting 8996 down to 8700.

Edit: 5X on short with 20% of stack.  1X on limit long orders.

Don't long yet. Wait for the real dip.
God damnit I was so focused on analyzing BTC's MA that I completely forgot to unload my shitcoins. People who trade for a living: What's your sleep patterns like? Definitely pushing a mad deficit right now. 
Looks more like an alt dump than btc.
I don't want to shake anyone out of longs here, I think we're gonna bounce to 9200.

Hidden bear div on OBV: https://imgur.com/a/hzD3ogQ

I just check OBV from time to time to look for divergences, didn't spot this one until just now. I am wondering if anyone wants to share opinions on the strength of this signal.
9100 alarms going off. There's been strong accumulation under 8900, should be a safe area to buy if it gets there on this push down. 9200- 9300 is resistance.
we are breaking [out of the ascending channel and wedge](https://i.imgur.com/xJ4xtMQ.png).  This might be the start of a breakdown.

Looks at the charts, sees bitcoin $100 lower than when I went to sleep, finds this sub freaking out.

Edit : It appears a lot of buying still taking place, (lots of long tailed hammers going up along the horizontal support).
Looks pretty bearish right now. I'm thinking 8.5ish before 9.8
Anyone notice this ridiculous looking candle on the 1h Bitfinex charts? (4/28/18 4pm candle). For some reason I don't remember this happening.

https://bitcoinwisdom.com/markets/bitfinex/btcusd



Interesting... I dunno about you guys, but I find it hard to read the market short\-term. Long\-term, I'm a bit of a perma\-bull. Let's see... $8600 is the support we're closest to, which I'm not too sure it'll hold. The 12th, we seemed to have set a solid support at about $7800. The way the BitcoinWisdom 12h chart looks on my screen reminds me of [a ball bouncing off of the floor](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/fb/5e/a9/fb5ea9f2e42a0451d2dd25dbcdd7fb73.jpg). So I'm increasingly confident that the long term bottom is in at $6000. 
BTC and other major coins like ETH, BCH started to dump few mins ago. Why is this place still so quiet? This time all have started to dump sharply which may be an indication of a bigger dump to follow... or maybe it’s the dump before the pump but I highly doubt it. 
You gotta give these big bears credit.  They sure do keep trying even though they're losing badly.  Zoom out. Up trend fully intact.  Great time to go long.  That dump was pure, pathetic desperation.
Starting to look like a descending wedge is forming.

Right now, the only thing that is holding up the price are the whales. There are numerous big traders (30+ BTC and 150+ BTC) who have already exited their positions in the past two to three hours as I've seen them myself. There are more leaving. The price is not moving, it hasn't even breached $9,350 for a long time now.

Whenever the price is about to go down, the whales place big buy walls (ranging from 50 - 200 BTC). By putting these big buy walls, it is keeping the traders with current open positions from selling their coins.

It is a matter of time, when more traders make a move at a similar time and we will see these buy walls disappearing or being chewed up. This is my speculation and I believe Bitcoin itself is speculation. I also respect everyone else's speculations.

And by the way guys, just like all of you, I am trading to make money; I also had some bad trades in the past; I like the idea of the price going up rather than going down as I have mentioned it before just like most of us here. The only problem right now is that the market is mostly being controlled by the big players, that include individuals and institutions. Now is simply not the right time to trade, we need a break!

Wish everyone good luck trading and making money. :)
BCH taking a much needed selloff - far from over IMO, far too much dumb money. 

This bodes well for BTC.
We have been consolidating for a week at our medium term resistance turned support (9.1k) Looking on the daily chart there hasn't been a period in the past 6-8 months were we have consolidated like this without further downward movement. 

Still short term bullish long term bearish. Still expect retest of 11.7k and a strong rejection signaling a summer bear market and panic sold mining equipment for the whales. Real pump wont start until halving.


I guess if we pump $300 that'll be Mike closing his short.

More hidden sell walls, the pattern is the same. $9,349.7, $9,349.8 and now at $9,349.9. 

EDIT: Guys, a humble request, stop lying to yourselves. Ignoring the fact is not going to earn you any Bitcoins!
Question to the community: 

Do you notice inorganic upvote/downvoting? A few of my previous non-FUD factual comments got more than 6 downvotes within 30min of posting, sometimes during low activity (US is asleep). Just curious if anyone else noticed anything weird on that front.

Dear Whale,

Lets see for how long you can pump to keep the price above $9,200. There can't be an eternal pump without a dump.

More people will start to realize and it all will come down.

This is like the gold standard format for TA posts. Informative, articulate, well-reasoned and ends with a cliff hanger.
Is that at about 9180 currently? I'm holding my long at 9250 (June futures, so really closer to 9210 spot), but I'm thinking I'll be looking to bail if futures hit <9175, which should mean spot is under 9150, assuming the premium doesn't dry up that quickly. 
You need this:

https://testnet.bitmex.com

Get bitcoin on the test net and transfer it in.

Break up your trading stack into portions. 

The fact that you're losing money is a good thing right now. You're learning that there is a lot of risk. You paid for an education. Try not paying for a little while.

Weekly BBands tightened by about 10%. So have daily. If your goal is to make money off BTC long-term, I'd DCA into a position with your coffee and lunch money.
Try using lower leverage or bigger stop loss wiggeling room.

Also you can try the bitmex testnet trading feature to practise.

I'd be a bit careful here, we've been up in this range for a longggg time (in BTC terms) and we're semi due for a big move - the floor could fall out quickly imo. You've got a great entry, just wouldn't be cute with it.


Great scalp entry.
Smart move, I wanted to but bitmex sucks ass. 15m rsi was at like &lt;15...

Nice job derisking and taking some profits. 

Got stopped out with tiny profit when we exited our channel this morning. Reopened the long higher, at 9240, when it was looking strong again, but with a position half as large since not as confident this time around.

Wish I would have locked in more profit around 9350 yesterday, it would have been a good amount, but was a little greedy and I didn't think we were gonna chop back down below the channel so soon. 
(back at a pc) I've got slightly different slope than you on the channel. https://imgur.com/nsjKrAL Though I like how the lowest line of mine supports the start of this as well as where we currently are, like a last line of defense.  It cuts the the tip of the BGC though, but the part that it cuts is the initial fakeout that started all this, so I'm ok with that.

These lines serve best on the 4hr timeframe.  But on 1hr and below actually where we currently are is fitting really well with my slope.  https://imgur.com/uqculdX  https://imgur.com/VXMHxuY
Our trendlines are different. I guess there is so much leeway when drawing lines over such a huge time interval
Just make the trend-channel wider and we are moving nicely on the centerline... https://www.tradingview.com/x/2swmbJqc/
seems like most trading is done off-market now, just a bunch of whales tossing bitcoins back and forth OTC.. the markets are there for bots to determine what price the whale's OTC at.  It's ridiculous.

I saw the word gamble and got excited, only to see that you've probably taken the distinctively more likely outcome \(for today\). Booooo, sensible trading. 
We also faced a nasty sellvolume at the resistance (4-25). If we can't make this week a higher high, the trend will remain bearish. 
His prediction is based on 2 observations:

* Weekly SMA-20 is pointing downwards
* Weekly BBands getting slightly tighter

However, consider that 20 weeks ~ 4.5 months. So the dramatic rise of the past year has been falling off the left end of any 20-week MA, and is almost completely out of it by now.

Therefore, no matter where we go from here, the 20-week MA is bound to point downwards. He might at least have mentioned this basic fact, and also discussed the choice of 20 over other common time windows for MAs.

The BBands are also fundamentally based on an MA, so the same comment applies.

That's a bit thin, even for a prophet, isn't it?


By saying "prophet" do you mean this guy is usually quite accurate? Or is that sarcasm?

I think that if this breaks down then trailing will probably stop you out prematurly. Its is probably going to dive hard and vice versa for a breakout
I've found response time quick too at Binance, but verification still pending. At Bfx I've been waiting for months now (although the instructions weren't clear, and something was missing from mine too, but I had to work that out myself). 

Who would have thought in December that as we move into May there'd still be a backlog. 
I've been waiting for months.
you just described the log downtrend line verbally 
I look at the daily and see the ATH trendline has come down from 11.6 to 7.9 and see that if it was not for the legendary BGD on 4-12 we would probably still be below that trendline going sideways. Sure i'd ride BGD's all the way to 20K but we can't seem to get there without them. Even these bounces don't have much "bounce" anymore. I buy into every upswing at some point but end up eventually dumping out to save capital. Hate to come off negative but it  feels good to get my thoughts out.
That seems to be where a lot of people are right now. The ultra bulls think we're already heading back up to previous all time highs and beyond.

I think a lot of people are expecting another fall down to around 6/7k levels and then finally a true beginning of the next rally.

Then there's a smaller group that thinks we're heading all the way down to 3/4k or even possibly the death of BTC.
Seems likely, good old consolidation atm
We've also been grinding on the 50MA on the 4h chart (which has been good support thus far). Last time BB were this tight we had a nice cushion from the 50MA and broke up. I don't know if that has any significance but I'm kind of leaning towards a break down.
>  hugging the upper bands 

really?
First time I've ever seen a 3h chart cited here.  Don't think there are many people watching it, thus there is less strength in its self-fulfilling prophecy.

I've only got one app on my phone that will even display a 3h.

Don't see any blast through 9.4k nor a lot of time spent in 9.5s in recent history, not sure what you are talking about. I do see many attempts at 9.4 before barely holding above 9.5 for only a few hours, then failed attempts at 9.4.
Spent about an hour yesterday over 9500 on Bitfinex. We haven't spent any meaningful time there in 6 days that I can see. 
>Longs are low

uhhh..
It's really just a call option, except you can't write your own call options or enter a lower bid - you're only able to buy at what is being offered, no ifs, ands, or buts (at least for now). There is only one de facto market maker for these contracts and you would assume it's Bitmex (unless they gave those privileges to another entity/party, seems unlikely imo, but maybe).

Here's what a call option is if you don't know: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp

In short, it gives the buyer the *option* to purchase the underlying asset at a given price in the future.

For the current "up" contract available, you can purchase the *option* to go long .1 xbt at $10,250 (1 contract is equal to .1 xbt) on May 4 for .00723 xbt (premium being paid). 

Here's the math on that: Buying .1 xbt at $10,250 costs you $1025. And .00723 xbt at the current price ($9300) costs you $67.24 (this is the premium you are paying). Thus, $1025+$67.24=$1092.24 (this is your breakeven price). THUS, BTC would need to be equal to or above $10,992 on May 4 for you to breakeven or profit from this trade.

I'd advise against trading these contracts for the time being.

Edit: this is my understanding (only glanced over the explanation page briefly), please correct if wrong
People are saying it's a call option? I didn't read the specification yet, but I'm puzzled \- if it works exactly like a call option, why didn't they just name it that? :|
What's the reason BitMeX doesn't allow people to short this product? To long the product you don't need margin (you pay fixed price in advance), but to hypothetically short the UP product, you need margin (potential loss is infinite to upside).

Maybe there is a technical reason they don't allow people to be market makers. If some gambler shorting UP gets liquidated at 15k 

> K=10250, option price C=750 USD, longing party has 15000-10250-750=4000 profit, shorting party has 4750-750=4000 loss

so if shorting party has only 4000 usd margin, the opposite side of the party gets stopped out of his option contract. But maybe bitcoin goes to 20k in the next 4 days (for the sake of argument) and the buyer of UP cannot profit from this 5k extra profits.

Would this be the reason BitMeX doesn't allow people to short the contract, because (a) you need margin, (b) if the shorting party gets liquidated the contract must be stopped, (c) the opposite party gets screwed because he can no longer enjoy profit to the upside, (d) defying the whole point of the call option contract

Somebody below said harshly that bitmex is introducing a "scam" product because they will be market makers, but maybe they are doing it only from a technical POV? 

edit: but if the shorting party would get potentially liquidated, wouldn't he just sell it on the market, and somebody else would take over the burden (such that the longing party can continue to execute his option at settlement) -- still don't understand it 
It allows you to participate in rallies without going massively underwater if the market tanks.   If you're long the contract, you get all the upside after the strike price and none of the downside.

One immediate strategy that comes to mind would be to short perps and long the UP contract as a hedge if you believe a price decline is imminent, but are uncertain.
This is the first movement like this in the last week where I am *not* closing at break even.  Because all that has gotten me lately is lost fees and reentering higher (watch this be the one that I eat shit on)
The fact that this was mainly accomplished by spot buying makes it even more bullish. Also the RSI is nicely cooled down for a potential break upwards.
Absolutely nuts. I have pondered to myself whether we'll see these same instances of crypto migration elsewhere in the world and whether Venezuela is essentially a 'first in a long line'. 

Shame they're asking to be paid in their own currency. Would have seemed a tad more legitimate an offer if they'd opted to be paid in BTC or a more established/decentralized coin at least.

You probably meant support
ummm...yes.  A glance at the chart confirms that.
Looks like the whale means business. Breakout denied; wall refilled. Based on the behavior, I'm guessing it's the opening of a massive short position? Not an expert on Quarterlies so would appreciate feedback from anyone who is.

Side note: I'm talking about one whale like some other folks here...but note the subtle difference: I'm not attributing *all* price action to a whale, but specific walls and positioning. There's a big difference.
Thanks. 
Yep. Need to break the 9500 -9550 Then road is clear to 10K and more.
Comparing 2014 to 2018 is simply ignoring reality that they are fundamentally completely different markets now. I have zero faith in any TA based on 2014. None. Zero. Zilch. Sorry.
I saw the same earlier.  BGD incomming

Edit:  it appears I got the color wrong
I think we won't see any significant bounce before 8.8k. But the market is hard to predict nowadays, could be another fake-out.
Decent comment, thank you for posting. You are struggling with the same things a lot of us are, I think. So while most of us probably cannot answer your questions satisfactorily, know you are not alone in thinking about them.

But, I have to criticise one part:

> We all know that exchanges create themselves most of their volume, it's an illusion, we all know that bitmain create itself the price of bch, it's an illusion

[citation needed]

No, we don't know that. Just because baseless speculation is repeated enough times, does not turn it into fact. While I don't doubt that some exchange somewhere, at some time, may have inflated volume (OKCoin comes to mind), that is not enough to pass such blanket statements about all/most exchanges as fact. Same for Bitcoin Cash...if you think the price is artificially high, you are welcome to sell your actual coins at the current price to see for yourself whether or not it is an illusion.... 
well said.  this place is the only bitcoin subreddit thats not just a permabull echo chamber.
Isn't that BitcoinDad?
Noooooo fuck we don't need any more uncertainty
nice observation, thank you - this is why I come here
Fuck... not Bitcoin Dad
BRB, getting popcorn.
I'm inclined to say yes, the tails are so long from 9180

https://imgur.com/a/qCy2PO3

If it does bounce up and is seen as a double bottom I'd call that very bullish.

(and a bear trap) - Edit, I take it allllll back.
I think it'll fall within 2 hours. Could be wrong though.
I ended up entering a 3x long at ~9170 with stops at 9000. Seemed like good r/r.
Lenders are rejoicing though.
> They’re going to try to make us believe what supports the narrative they want to see. This whole BGD pump feels like straight up bullshit (no pun intended).

Yet people don't want to believe it and they think the price growth is organic, which is not!
With a breakeven price of 11.2k lol

Long term forming a weekly lower high is better, right? Otherwise we go screaming up without enough gas in the tank. 

Glad I missed that dump on a plane.... I think 
its rising again isnt it?

Thats nice, hope this becomes a trend again !
tx rate may increase the value because it creates in-transit scarcity.. LN may actually make the value of bitcoin go down.  Your model might be more robust than you thought.

Wrong thread

Letting go of your own personal bias is one of the most important aspects of being a successful trader — it's also one of the hardest. 

For me it helps to have a line in the sand to say, "once the market does x, then the trend has changed and my sentiment needs to shift as well."

I was right alongside Vays calling for $3K BTC just a few weeks ago. But when the market broke the log resistance line at around $8,500, that was my line in the sand. 
> This is why you don't follow anyone

I actually think this is a reason to follow many different commentators, hear multiple points of view and decide if any of the arguments are compelling or supportive of one's own thesis.


Hoping for new ATHs as every other BTC long termer here, but they just may still be right!
You're talking in absolutes more proudly than the people you're criticising, it's gross.
We're only 4 month into an potentially protracted bear market.  You'll have a bit more credibility once this thing goes over 12k, and even more at 17k
> knock on wood

superstitious?

> Stick to your gut

type one thinking?

> just buy Bitcoin and shut the fuck up

price only goes up?
I wouldn't trust Tone Vays' opinion on ice cream flavors, let alone Bitcoin price. His 15 minutes should have been up in 2014, not sure why anyone takes his opinion seriously....
When did Tone call for 3K? Last I heard he was eyeing $4900. Both seem totally possible to me. You shouldn't falsely ascribe predictions to people and then criticize them. That's slander.

Well you might want to change those Ichimoku setting to more crypto related settings to understand the massive resistance we are still facing. Those are default settings.
dat hopium
In regards to hidden bearish divergence, it's more or less a foregone conclusion that there will be at least some amount of hidden bearish divergence on meaningful timeframes during a trend reversal. 

You'll be able to make an argument for hidden bearish divergence all the way up until the market makes a new ATH. Whenever the market makes a move that pushes RSI higher than it was during the move to $20K, there will be hidden bearish divergence on that timeframe.

Like all indicators, RSI divergence works...until it doesn't. 

For example, there was hidden bearish divergence on the 1h all the way through the 1D going back to the bounce from $7,300 to $9,200 in comparison to the bounce from $6,400 to $9,199. But the market ultimately resolved the hidden divergence when the market made a new local high above $9,200 and pushed to $9,750.  
Be cautious with that hidden bear div - kind of hard to frame the lower high as something other than chop at the moment. See rule 1: https://www.babypips.com/learn/forex/9-rules-for-trading-divergences
the likelihood is non-zero. Obviously providing a number is ridiculius, but at this point in time, we need to break below 8600 and hold there for any chance at this being a DCB. If we remain in the 9200+ range, I anticipate noone will sell below 9200 unless a whale barts us down.

All this is price discovery. Let’s be hoenst... noone knows what the fuck Bitcoin should be worth. it’s why we shot up to 20k in the first place, jt’s why we shot down to 5900. Valuation is hard and retail investors are not qualified 
High. There was a clear strike of the 0.618 fib line and attempts to attack it again appear to be lacking.
What is a DCB?
Interesting, thanks for the chart. 
Very good eye. It is still possible we go a bit higher.
The striped line is our support now, so I'd say we are still mainly in the buy zone. Over $10k it gets tricky.
is that a bad thing?
The triangle you posted broke down, what are you praying for now?
Not as irrational as bulls have been, last night people were getting excited about 12k without breaking any resistance (and making fun of me for being short). 
[removed]
this is how you lose money man. You should have shorted before all of this. We could easily pump back up to 9200+. best to sit on hands imo
Do you think we'd go sub 9000? I have trouble seeing it.
9.1k is another big support if I draw it correctly. Bounced off a bit right now (not *very* convincingly, though)... Tough call, though... Could very well break down today.
I have my short take profit at 9067, then new longs spread from just under 9k to 8.7k.  I'm wondering if I should lower them...

On one hand, don't want to get left holding the bag, on the other hand don't want to miss an awesome entry.
> I think it's safe to say the next few weeks are critical for bitcoin.

Lol, feels like it's been awhile since I've read a "the next X time is critical for bitcoin" comment.  Was seeing them multiple times a day in feb and march.

Hope you did a double dose of your DCA back when we were at lower 7k!  (even if we revisit there and go lower, it's really a great price imo)
same same, but different
I'd long @ $8600 & close my short there. Hope it touches.
Been sitting on a limit buy on GDAX at 8650 for 3 days. Starting to think it will get filled. I decided to change my trading strategy to projecting/waiting for the trade to come to me after getting eaten up by chop previously.  Can’t recommend it enough. 
I agree. It's fun to watch 8000 btc worth of longs close over a week's time with no substantial shorts also closing while the price of btc doesn't drop an inch.
Yeah, good thing you know what's going to happen.
no issues here at all
Barely functional, maybe they´re getting doxed again?
Just logged in, Same issue for me!  
[removed]
It was a bit earlier, but they're very similar yes.

I'm not too worried about the drop as of now, and I'm seeing it as a potential bullflag. 

I might add to my long at 9.0-9.1k as I think we'll find good support in the lower edge of small clag, 0.286 fib, and fractals of a 3-wave motion. 

I'm thinking of putting a s/l around 8.89k.


Yep, but that was / in weekend. 
High was 9500+ in weekend. Lets's see if we can break that again.

People talking about that A&E and the large 6k A&E is the same thing as talking about a head and shoulders forming on the way down from the head. It's just scribbles on the chart until it's actually formed.
It's called a double top.
If it were a potential iA&E it would have a 64% chance of breaking up here. It's not a potential iA&E.
6k could still happen of course, but there is a mountain between that and where we are now. 7.8k should be firm support, and perhaps we need to test it sooner or later to instill the confidence needed to push to 12k+. 
Stop hoping.  It is so annoying when people hope for anything in markets.  That’s how you get burned.  Personally I don’t give a shit what the price does.  
Yeah, or lower. I'm thinking we see the 5000s before breaking the bear market. 

Edit: I started with Bitcoin in early 2014  right at the bull trap around $800 and rode it all the way down to sub-$200. This feels like it's playing out the same way, imo. Not trading advice, just my opinion. 
Such as who?
since no one knows anyways, its just bulls vs bears
Machiavellian tactics push and pull. Interpreting the market on these glimpses isn't going to go well.
I don't think they themselves have underwater long positions lol. But yes, what mainstream media has to say about BTC and markets in general is very often for a reason. I expect them to all become super bulls and very positive towards crypto as soon as institutions have positioned them well enough. 
When are you planning on waking up?
You have to take the individual transaction data (in trade history), sort it by type and date (so you can organize by funding, quarterly series, and swaps), then compile the transactions into the trades (that match the trades on your orders history in account records). You have to do it this way and can't use the orders history because the orders page doesn't list auto-deleverages or liquidations, both of which are important as they're position exits. It also fails to list the commissions for your trades (which deduct from your taxable profit).

From there, you then calculate the USD gains by doing SUMPRODUCT of the prices column (for the entry) and the size column (for the entry). Then you do the same for the exit and divide by the size of said position to figure out average entry and exit. Don't forget to add a column to convert the trading fee from BTC to USD (using the BTC price for the trade). That way you can get the exact fee paid (in USD) for each transaction.

Then you can use that to figure out the USD P/L and calculate the P/L in BTC by the average exit price of the position. That is used to calculate your P/L for the year.

Next, you have to calculate the cost basis for each coin (important for any realized losing position since you have to pay the difference in cap gains from receive to lose) which is a much bigger pain in the ass and I got someone else to do for me cause I'm lazy.

The entire process, minus the cost basis calucations, should take 3-4 hours if you have less than 1,000 transaction lines in your trades section of your account page.
I left them off mine (all $500 worth of trades) because I wasn't sure how to classify force liquidations.
The margin account is cross margin with max 3.3x lev so use 1/3 the account . If you want to hedge 1 btc put 1 btc into the margin wallet and short 1 btc(it will allow you about 3 but short hedging will leave you without a liquidation price)
I'd wait for the bounce to see if it closes below or not
Wait a month and look back. 
when it retraces more than, hmm, say 2/3 of the dump and stays above 1/2 of it. I'd say a bounce above $9150 would mean this "dump" was just noise

No matter what, you're ultimately going to be confined by the biases and emotions of a human. Because the bot is going to be programmed by a human, and it's up to that human to decide what elements of TA to use to program the bot's decisions. 

For example, there are going to be times where the bot has conflicting buy and sell signals on the same timeframe, and will need to decide which to adhere to and which to ignore. 

For example, let's say you programmed your bot to sell whenever 1h RSI is above 70 and buy whenever the 1h MACD has a bullish cross. Well, what happens if they occur simultaneously? Or at least close together. 

A human needs to make that decision before the bot is set free and implement that into the code. 

The bot might be superior when it comes to analyzing historical data though, and give you an edge when trying to make that decision. 

For example, you could run an analysis of "how often has 1h MACD cross been a strong buy signal" vs "how often has 1h RSI above 70 lead to a sell off." 
The market is somewhat organic and will burst from these robotic molds now and then.. When that happens bots can lose a lot of money. Manual traders have advantages and disadvantages when it comes to bots. Best to do a little of both really.
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical\_analysis#Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_analysis#Software)

The section below the stamp this links to.

TA is \(also\) about understanding market sentiment and human psychology. A computer can't comprehend a great number of issues which affect price action reliably. TA done by traders is in part an attempt to capture this component.

Lots of TA/trading etc. is done by bots and computer systems. Which is 'better' is tough to judge. Remember, those "cognitive biases and emotional decision making" components influence the market, so good TA will include such components. The TA formation that occurs seemingly randomly, vs the TA formation that occurs due to FUD. They might play out differently based on human psychology \(oh that news isn't real? FOMOs back in\). Can a computer reliably do that?
Most TA strategies aim to remove cogn**i**tive bias and emotion. They don't require a computer although having one is certainly less work. Pulling the trigger is of course another matter, but that's what bots are for. 
TA does not provide hard and fast execution parameters. The intelligence and non-binary rational of a trader is sometimes what's needed to know whether an entry makes sense, whether or not TA dictates that it is. This can go poorly too, of course.

And yes, computers do it well. They're called bots. They make 1-2% most days. Many days it outperforms me, but I've never seen it hit a 20% stack increase. 

For clarification, do you mean trading TA or drawing TA? 
Not really, there are nuances, psychology, and fundamentals that need to be taken into consideration with all TA. Computers could calculate things based on price movements, but this is what indicators are.
A human would have to write the code. Of course it could be done well. Maybe it has been done, and done quite well already. It would not be shared with the public for obvious reasons. If I was a programmer with some spare time I would work on making a smarter trade bot all the time. 
It's mostly because recent bearish posts with "logic" have had glaring flaws or zero evidence and no actual data-driven analysis/TA. There's very little to go off of right now (for both bulls and bears) so people seem to be grasping at straws waiting for something to happen.
[Not all, this one is below yours.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8fwtzb/daily_discussion_monday_april_30_2018/dy8f5hx/)

Just the shitty fuddy ones, the conspiracy ones, etc.
Investor optimism is peaking?
? You sold the bottom. If you were planning to sell, 9400 was a much more attractive option.
you're supposed to short at the top of the trend.  with the price struggling to make it back to 9700 theres probably plenty of people thinking its about to go back down.
Selling would be a pretty dumb way to accumulate. The people trying to drive the price down are probably old-fashioned bankers who feel threatened by Bitcoin. Not very smart of them. There will be plenty of money in banking/vault/exchange services in this space. Smart ones are preparing for it (eg Goldman buying Circle/Poloniex), dumb ones are fighting it.

Moon Prevention team probably runs out of coins sometime this week. Looks like they're losing power every day.
Perfect timing, this sub is getting more and more viewers, nearly 5.5k this morning!!!
I've been watching that as well for a long while as a sign of possible institutional long positioning. May be way off base on this given that recent contract just expired, but given that there's been no material correction in the price of BTC it is possible that groups are taking on derivative exposure as a hedge. 
Where can you see the premium ? Thanks
go on...
Thats alot of bitcorn, enough to make a small bitcorn farm. Wonder if they want to expand or default on their farm idea
buy high sell low
> The fun begins when this dumper covers because he definitely borrowd a lot of those coins.

Yep, it's just one guy. He's been dumping non-stop since $20K. I know because he lives next door to me...I can hear him yelling at his monitor every time the price bounces.
:O
On which exchange has the seller borrowed them?  BTC lending book depths on both Polo and Bitfinex haven't changed much in the past 24 hours.
Which indicators are you using 
Another version of that uptrend line though where it became support and has seen 2 rejections...   https://imgur.com/uINOYmr

Not saying that my line is the right one.  Just that with such small waves there, and that we should treat lines to be zones and not hard things, I don't think we can accurately say "4" rejections over the day  or take meaning out of the count of rejections like that.
From 9k?
From where? 
Close when it's opportune. This dip isn't over.
2500 is achievable

I don't know about 8.4, but in general, I believe the high USD rate from bitfinex was an indicator of a lot of exuberant longs, where they were willing to pay too much to get into a leveraged position, which I believe would also indicate someone willing to exit a position quicker than typical.

But, I literally am not somebody to listen to...yet :)
Bloody Monday... Hahahah it is getting Funny here. We drop 100 -200$ and it is named Bloody Monday..

Look at 7 day chart. is this Bloody Week Up?

Certainly possible, but the market has quite a ways to drop in order to confirm it. 

If $8,800 breaks down, then the target for that breakdown would be somewhere in the vicinity of $7,800 to $8,000. So shorting anywhere between $8,800 and $9,500 is a bit of a mixed bag from an r/r perspective — especially the closer the market gets to $8,800.
i just see a symetrical triangle. Even a bull penant. Both would be bullish.
Nice catch.

My spidey senses are tingling 
arrogance tone of this post -> bearish
maybe everyone just needs to realize that BTC doesn't always have to be bearish or bullish. maybe it just... chills out at a price range
Why do you keep posting this comment over and over 
You do realize we can’t hold above 9500 for more than 2-3 hours at a time. Not exactly bull run material. This could drop like a rock
*Be excellent to each other*

No bearish/general trader works in absolute terms of 'bull/bear' market. They are also \(funny this\) normally only a lot easier to spot in retrospect. 

We are very much in will it/won't it area of trading right now. Most sensible traders identify levels of resistance and trade with caution accordingly. 8.6k, 9k, 9.2k, 9.8k and 11.6k are \(I believe\) the levels at which we would expect resistance and most traders expect to see pullback/resistance around these points.

This is why you'll see a lot of decent TA here splitting up sentiment into short/medium/long term. it is possible to see today's price action as pretty bearish short term \(we could revisit 8.6k\) whilst still believing that long term our break from the log downward trend resistance and move up from 6.5k to 9.5k was still bullish. 
Imagine that....traders are reacting and adjusting to changing market conditions.  How very odd.
If you are in a bullish position and not feeling some bearish pressure and doubt if this is going down you should stop trading. 
Why not both?  What's your target for the real dip?
I think that was it for now.
Waited waited waited... and missed it again! 
Someone tell me how/when to catch a decent  dip for a long entry pls...
I sleep soundly by never holding any shitcoins.
Yikes. Sleep & reduce exposure mate.
This whole pump from $6.8k has looked more like an alt pump (DCB) than btc, so I'm not sure if that bodes well
Hidden bear divs tend to be continuation patterns, if I am correct, not reversal patterns.
Don't look for divergence within chop.

Question here.  From where do you trace the ascending channel? Because if you trace it after the legendary green dildo (which to me its a much more logical thing to do. it has not been broken. that channel was unsustainable anyway it would had put us at 100.000 by September 
Everyone has their own style. Day traders will close of an evening, swing traders not. For me (*mainly* swing trading), if my target hasn't hit it stays open, but it will depend also on the exchange and funding. 

I've held positions open for a week or more on 'mex during consolidation when funding was in my favour. They recommend opening for 8 hours and a few minutes for that purpose but really I just trade for the shits and giggles to take my mind off how stressful my job is.
In a bull run, most of the time, yes. Trading short time frames just cost me money.
Generally I keep them open - with alarms, limit exits, trailing stops depending on the circumstance. It gets a lot easier to sleep when I am deep in the green on a position, and much more difficult to sleep just after a position is opened.
Normally I don't, but did last night. Missed the local top for selling and woke to the farce this morning. Another lost op to profit.
Belongs in the alt daily.
Do, your definition of bearish is my definition of heavy bllish with dip coming for buying ;)
I was thinking it looks really strong actually. Unless we break down on the 4h I just see this as chop. Think the lowest we would go today would be a wick down to 8.9. 
It happened. That same basic candle is in the 1m if you find it. Massive market sell/buy in about 30 seconds. 
[deleted]
This ian't really a dump. It's just ranging between short term support and resistance. No concern unless 8800-9000 levels start being tested and broken.
What dump? It's less then 100$ 
You're calling it a dump, I am just glad to see some action after the weekend
Yeah real epic dump.  -$100 in 75 minutes.
ETH hasn't even broken support and the volume is really low. 
> blowing your load over a $50 bounce 

also when is the uptrend not intact? $1000? Is that when you'll short/sell? 
Do you have a chart?

Post a chart please.
Omg 30 or 150 is a big trader. I am not reading more.
with all those mentioned in your post left and price still holding 9.2k+ => bullish
As long as the hive mind keeps treating that button like a "I disagree" button and downvoting you, I will keep upvoting you. Your posts are not the most factual or convincing, but you share your opinion and reasoning and I do not believe you should be voted -10 or more for that just because that opinion isn't bullish.
[Alt Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8fwu0k/altcoin_discussion_monday_april_30_2018/), please.
Put it in the alt thread.  You could say any alt selling off is good for BTC, but you would be wrong and also off topic here.
BCH is just a pump n dump at this point - has little to no implications for BTC or the broader crypto market imo. Play with it, make money off it (if you know what you're doing), but no need to talk about it. What happens in the pump n dump stays in the pump n dump.
The 1-week consolidation period between $7,800 and $8,400 was certainly in the past 6-8 months...and the market broke up.
"Further downward movement" -- what downward movement? That idiot dumping all those coins back in February? That's over, man.

Literally unfounded FUD.

But sure, caution and exit strategies are always good.
Quite literally FUD. Unfortunately a day will come where someone will accurately signal this sort of thing (not necessarily Tether) but so many false signals along the way means it's not worth listening to.

P.S. Great timing. What next, China bans crypto?
Maybe a coincidence, but BTC is diving right now on finex and the ETHBTC ratio isn't tracking it as it usually does.
Can we get a permaban for this obvious fudster here please?
Well it's always a good idea to keep your eye out for bad news in general, but I'm not about to be changing anything because of this comment. Business as usual for me, until something actually does happen.
A few opinions of glorified internet bitcoin traders will not dictate the direction of the price. 
Where has Peter Brandt been bearish recently? He just tweeted last week that it'd be better to be long 
all these people's opinions don't matter as long as my gramma is bullish
Has Peter Brandt gone bearish on BTC? I don't see anything indicating such on his Twitter.  Looks like he's still calling for a re-test of 11.7
God damn this fulls gold!

It's literally a call option contract man.  They've just only released one with a strike of $10,250 and an expiry of 5/4.  If that's unappealing - don't buy it.  

How is that a scam? None dared to call even bitconnect with 100% certainty til they exits-cammed.
What are you rambling on about?
Thank you, I really appreciate this. These posts are never easy to put together (this one has a few more typos than I'd like), but the regulars in this sub are equal parts smart and supportive, so as a community, you have made me step up my game. My hat is off to you all and the mods for keeping it that way.

Ya, it's right at about $9,185 at the moment.
If someone would send me 1MM$ (a-la-Mike) worth of BTC, i would gladly go with low leverage.

Meanwhile, here i am, bashing a few bucks here and there with x25-x50, hoping for a BRD/BGD on my way.
It's your opinion that alts matter that much to daily BTC price movements. You guys begged us to make a daily so you could talk about that opinion here. We made you a special daily thread for it. Now you don't want to use it.

Show us you care about the toys you have.
Both 15min and 1hr at the bottom.. falling off the line means this thing may go lower over the next few days... but will try to optimize this bounce
I'm with you... will close once the bounce looks like it's losing steam
I know man... Mex sucks these days... hit the market buy button like 15 times near the bottom and got lucky 
It's not lol. I don't know why he's obsessed with them. They're all terrible and nothing close to head and shoulders
lol most of it is useless, I agree. I do like some of the simpler stuff, mainly for getting more optimal entries and exits

but ya after seeing that...it's clear most people just like thinking they have any idea what's going on and TA gives them that feeling

now what you gonna do for me?  you owe me.

Thanks. All in all, I haven't had a great 5 days of trading since the 9800 peak. This low volume is scaring me, especially how close we are to the bottom of our channel. 8900 should hold, but if we dumped to it quickly, I'm not sure that it would.
Interesting. I'm sure it's just as valid as mine. I'm treating it as a 1%ish zone at the moment anyway (>14-day line), which fits both of ours. I'm still pretty beat up over exiting my all-in 5x long from 8750. That's just killing me. 
Yours is cutting a number of wicks and candle bodies (not counting the BFX shenanigan wick). Can you post it zoomed out more?
I reworked it a little bit and I have this: https://www.tradingview.com/x/m00rugmq/

but in truth I feel like there is more to this channel, we have yet to find the most accurate bottom trend line.
The bottom of your channel has 1 point of contact. Mine has 3 as support and 5 as resistance. You can't just move these lines, man, haha
plot twist: it was 100x leveraged
you're basically just describing how a moving average works. i guess he is aware of that. it's more about the implication of it, that he i refering to. And in the past that indicator described a severe downfall.
No sarcasm. Eerily accurate predictions!

Just look and tap 'play' on this prediction from early 2017: https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/YRZvdurN-The-target-of-current-bubble-lays-between-40k-and-110k/

Or late 2016 even: https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/MrwPhbog-Long-Term-Bitcoin-price-extrapolation/
Either interpretation of your prediction is unlikely:

1. They both go to $0 - no.
2. BTC goes down and BCH (or whatever alt) goes up inversely - not going to happen.
You mean Doge?

I would say thats the transaction amount something needs to be recognized as a crypto, anything below is just a b(it)ch.
That's a good point. Will probably let a short ride and keep a long tight as we approach 9.7k.
Btw, I got verified by Binance within 1 day (a few weeks ago). Maybe worth another try?
I feel like this is decision time on whether to go full fiat and buy back in later, or just buy in now before we start the upward trend. The chart looks like the downtrend has stopped and we are just sideways for now, in which case i'd want to buy in now. But I just can't shake the feeling that this isn't the true bottom of the bear market. 
Well those are the only three options really so yes those would be the camps.
$3k would be nowhere near the death of btc. 

3 digits is where it'd start to look dead, and even not so much then

> Don't see any blast through 9.4k nor a lot of time spent in 9.5s in recent history, not sure what you are talking about. 

Probably a 100% MEX trader. It was above 9500 much of yesterday on futures. Heck, Sept futures hit >9650.
3h and 45m are often very revealing. What that reveals remains to be seen. For some reason 'finex's site skips 2h and 4h, going from 1h to 3h to 6h, which makes sense doubling to 12h, daily etc.

Thing is, and why I changed my original post, is that you can go long or short this contract. So, if you're short, assumedly, and BTC's price fails to reach the strike price - the premium, you're ITM.
So they can name the put option DOWN.. don't have to spend time in the future explaining difference between put/call. Kinda hilarious, since it shows they think most of their customers are retards. :D
The reason why they probably don't use the term "put option" and "call option" is because there is legal baggage to selling put and call options in certain jurisdictions
FYI, I just checked and there was a DOWN contract on the testnet.  It's probably coming soon
you get the downside of actually pying for the product. You immediately realize the price - traded value as a loss/gain
I don't know why you got downvoted for saying that. It's completely true as far as I know
You can steal your own premined "crypto", not bitcoin
Lol
Where's 2k?
9200 has been violated!
To me, it looks like every bounce off support has been weaker than the last. I'm often wrong.
I did mean support.  Thanks.
Wall just pulled. (Edit: as pointed out, eaten not pulled)
Possibly someone hedging coins after making huge profits in alts? 
Could not have said it better 
The markets are different, but human psychology and bubble theory remain the same so it is worth investigating in my opinion. 
The parabolic rise, the crazy few days of unprecedented growth, the huge correction, and the dead cat bounce. None of these will ever happen exactly the same way twice, but bubbles can bear an uncanny resemblance to one another. I just don’t feel in my gut that the long bear market will repeat. However, if I saw the price go vertical again, I would bet my life that it will correct back down to 25-40% if the blow off top. In those kind of days nobody on here will accept that it’s about to happen. 99% if the sub will pretend that it’s just going to do 10% daily gains forever and ever. It’s maddening to see the denial. 
Groundhog Day again...seems like it's mandatory to have at least one of these comments a day.

If I had a dollar for every "this time is different...no, really" comment, I wouldn't need to speculate on crypto anymore.
I'm in agreement with the 8.8k line. I think we'll bounce off there for a short while, but will fall below. Could be wrong though. We'll see.

Fair enough, you're totally right, this writing (probably like the rest) was just pure speculation and you're right pointing the fact that it's possible to sell bch at $1400 so it's not an illusion. Thanks for your understanding.
Yes it is 
One can only get so uncertain
The target would be 9320.
I'm a lender but also long btc up the arse.
either the current price does not make sense or the time period doesn't (I think the contract period should be at least 1 month), you pay 780 USD price for 10 contracts (1 BTC) for potential profits only > 11.2k within 4 days; 

maybe market makers get less greedy (instrument only open for a few hours) and price gets lower
There's **one** at the moment. At least for me there is. It's for later this week with a strike price of 10.25k. Currently it's trading at 0.00721btc.

Edit: or at least, that's what it looks like. As I said, no info on it. 
>/u/MikeXBT

Thanks. Yes, I still have my position open. 
Woops! Haha
Possible. Also velocity arguments may make it cheaper. But we have no data.
[removed]
But what is your current position?
Glad to hear you say that. It fits my swing trading. When BTC double topped I knew that it was game over for the bulls. That was the final straw. A few weeks ago when ETH held above $418 and other alts were rallying, that was my go long signal (even woke up at $2:30 am to place the order). 
If we get into a real bull market you'll see him here everyday with a wall of text about how he talked his girlfriend or cousin into buying BTC in 2015 and how are they now sucking his dick for it. You'll get used to it.
Over time, yeah, it goes up. I've seen it crash so many times only to come roaring back. 

There's no Gox, just some whales with an irrational hatred of Bitcoin selling at a loss. They're almost out of coins. We will see a new ATH soon.
[removed]
Actually it's libel, since it's written instead of spoken.
> That's slander.

I watch his videos almost daily. The last 30 days, I would estimate he called out 1.3k about 15 times, maybe 4.5-4.9k 5times, 3k maybe 10 times. Rough estimate, u can verify yourself.

His stubborness is based on the following premises

- he doesn't believe in double bottoms 

- he thinks we are doing a fractal of 2014 where we went above log down line, but still went down afterwards

- he needs a TD 9 count on his weekly chart for his random number generator to work

- he thinks the short-squeze was fake and we must return (confusing cause&effect, effect=1.2k pump; cause=no more panic seller at 6.6k only margin shorts and people were buying it up for one week)

- he called 7500 USD the 2017 top, anything higher right now will be somewhat overvalued in his own eyes/bias

> You shouldn't falsely ascribe predictions to people and then criticize them. That's slander.

Excuse me, he threw out 3K as his low target as well... I think his best case bottom scenario was 4900 and worst case 3K. Doesn't matter either way, he's still calling for the bear scenario unless he changed his opinion in the latest morning brief or whatever. I even complimented him, he's a great trader, but he was wrong when he called for 9 weeks of downside a few weeks ago and it seems like he's gonna be wrong about 3-4.9K. In an interview I saw with him very recently he was still adamant about the bear scenario 
sad that OP's garbage getting 20 upvotes
Do you agree with joyrider, who said (I think, from what I remember) that normal bull divs during a bull trend are the strongest divs?
So is there a timeframe / price action over which the effect of a hidden bear div can be expected to play out?

Eg. After the hidden bear div I've highlighted, there was a dip to 8600s. Was that the div's effect being resolved and now it's not relevant anymore?
Rule 1 appears to be specific to standard divergence, and Rule # 1 does not apply to hidden divergence. 

In the case of hidden divergence, Rule 1 would need to be rewritten to include:

* Lower high than the previous high
* Higher low than the previous low

For hidden divergence, RSI and price are still diverging, but the market behavior is the inverse of what you'd see in standard divergence. 

RSI is making higher highs, but price is making lower highs (in the case of hidden bearish divergence). Or RSI is making lower lows, but price is making higher lows (in the case of hidden bullish divergence).

There's an absolutely beautiful hidden bullish divergence on the 1w, for example. As the 1W RSI dipped lower on the drop to $6,400 than it did on the drop to $6,000. But price obviously made higher lows there.
Cool site, thanks
I'm happy to bounce around this 9100-9600 range forever.
Dead Cat Bounce

Not necessarily. Especially if you've got other things to do besides staring at a chart.

E: spelling
Instructions unclear: hands in pants

_____

On a more serious level, been sitting on my hands for almost 5 months. When should I stop?
> We could easily pump back up to 9200+. best to sit on hands imo

My current situation. It's not exactly diving off a cliff (yet)
We posted a lower high earlier, and if this doesn't push back up over 9.2 it would represent a lower low.

Also knowing that 9.2 is a key support/resistance point, surely the correct time to short would be when it is broken downwards?
You're 100% right on should have done it earlier but wasn't able to watch the charts. Stop is break even though so not to worried and its only a hedge. If I get stopped I'll just put another order higher up. Not going for a big short here even though I see the potential for one. 
I'm waiting for a retest of around 9200, if it fails i'll short there. 
[Support / Resistance lines](https://imgur.com/a/mZ82lE0)

Is there a point when you will switch to bear and if so, will you short, or watch in fiat, or....HODL?

It seemed like 9200 was everybody's number.
Looking to close at the 8.3-8.6k price gap. So yes. Have a tight stop though as always. Nothing is guaranteed. 
9050 is the important mark, that is the support of the channel we are in, if we break it with conviction I guess the bull market is over.     
Would hold short until 8.6 and low lev longs under there personally. 
How so?
Fair enough. Not even sure why I’m bothering even looking at charts. got a sick twisted gut fart of a hunch the going rate of bitcoin is hardly represented by the public price on exchanges. after the maul I don’t trust in this market except the chain. thought we would be publicly much more bullish than we have been today 
Only privileged clients have usual service it seems

Yeah exactly. It's okay to point out that it's *potentially* forming but to *assume* that it's going to complete is really counterproductive. 

All you gotta do is blindly backtest this for a little while to see how many times these various patterns look like they're forming but nothing ever comes of it. The point is to trade the pattern once it completes and confirms. Some like to call it early but that's called gambling.

edit: not saying this of /u/lvl_3_caterpie, just more broadly speaking. 
I agree. I love formulating plans at the last minute. /s

Great write up, thanks! The trade data on 'mex is byzantine.
Thanks a lot. When you say individual transaction data you mean the Trade History right?   
I just checked and I have about 10000 trades last year fuck. RIP weekend

How do you add the USD price data for each trade ? 
And does someone probably know a small program for exactly this case ?
Bitmex btc trades into regular btc - usd trades so you can add them to bitfinex data for example.
Cointracking doesn’t use Bitmex yet 
Forced liquidations count as losses.
Thanks. I am trying to figure out how to think about levrage. 

Suppose I want to sell 1k$ worth of BTC, with stop loss of 5%, that is, buy BTC back if the price goes up/down for 5%

 How would I have to go about setting up this trade under the 3.3x framework if I want to expose myself  to the same risk/reward?
The bottom of the symmetrical triangle is all the way up at 9150. If we do get back up there then, yeah, that would be super bullish, but I'm already out and my plan is that entry point. Gotta make plans and stick to them otherwise I'll overtrade.
lol
^ This or just 8851. Front run that round number support.
I am a programmer but have only written an arbitrage bot which doesn't use any past data. I'm wondering if it's worth the time to do any sort of predictive analysis. There are tons of courses/jobs in machine learning currently.
We'll see. I'm trading on long time-frames mostly, I bought in before at $7,720, last few days sold parts of my stack between $9,350 and $9,150. Whatever happens, I took profit.

I'm still expecting $8,800 and possibly lower, although the market sure is unpredictable at the moment.
You figured it all out!

Price goes up = organic demand

Price goes down = moon prevention team, one bearwhale selling and suppressing the whole market, etc.

And we would have gotten away with it, too, if it wasn't for you meddling kids!
Current active members metric is bugged, I would not give it much thought. 
Where you can see this? 
A fun little additional piece of info - circle is doing $2B a month OTC now.  If you're a US institutional investor, you're using them.
you can't hedge with futures though only reason to buy them is take a position or maybe arb.  there are no bitcoin options. premiums comin' down now.. man some whale just bought in huge and was eager to do.. chasing the bid in the illiquid cme market and chasing a 40% run up like it's 2017? lol..  talk about an ape.




road to riches 
I didn't know we were neighbors!
It may be a few guys... not many.  It's definitely not organic, just some senile old farts with a lot more money than brains who get off on market selling tens of millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin and driving the price down for a few minutes.  Doesn't matter.  They're done.  They blew at least $50 million on this dump and barely moved it 3%.  LMFAO.  Moving price != moving market

Smart money is definitely taking advantage of the discount that dumb money is giving us right now.
They borrowed them OTC in large quantities.  When they cover, they will need to buy large quantities. 
Hmm thanks for a different perspective. You're absolutely right :)
8900, but that’s out of the picture now 
On Friday we crashed and made a higher low. Recovered to 9570 ( Binance) 

Who said that couldn’t happen again? 
People are joking, chill 
I said if we lose 9.2k level... obviously nothing has happened just yet.

But yes, I think most would consider a $1000 drop fairly bloody.  
For sure there's a long way. I was thinking more along the lines of the difference in the peaks, with the rounded eve portion being considerably lower than the adam portion
I see those too.  They would seem to take the scale priority.
Been breaking down from it though.
Ugh... I'm going to end up closing at break even... again.  (not yet, I'm at least going to sell half this shit off at the top of the triangle. edit: and will deliberate more, not convinced one way or the other yet)
Mirror Magic.

You do realize we can’t hold below 9200 for more than 15 minutes at a time. Not exactly bear meteor material. This could ascend to Valhalla.
> No bearish/general trader works in absolute terms of 'bull/bear' market.

I don't think you ever met DushmanKush.
> Why not both?

...Go long and not go long at the same time? What? (lol, sorry don't mean to poke fun, was just funny comment to me.)

The bounce off 9200 the last few times were fakeouts. You can tell by the relative ease it came back up with low volume. The next support line on the ascending channel is 8800. Wait for that one to be tested. If it bounces (confidently) then go long. Otherwise, it may fall back to 7000s and then 6000s possibly. My bet, personally, is the latter case. Unfortunately.
For me it's looking for horizontal support. It's the third time it's hit (around 9200), so assuming you are a bit bullish you'd buy there.
Yes they only have outperformed BTC in the last year, two years, three years, etc.  You wouldn't want to hold any of them.
I have a friend and she always says "Don't be a dick, get 8 hours of sleep and be nice to animals." 

She's always onto shit. 
I don't know how that could bode well. Just more signs of irrationality in the space, taking advantage of hype and technicals to pump shit. Will the markets ever learn? Find out maybe next quarter or the quarter after that on *All My Bitcoins*. 
you are not. hidden divs are early reversal patterns....when identified properly

> I just trade for the shits and giggles to take my mind off how stressful my job is.

How ironic


Yeah same thing happened to me. Had a take that was just missed and the rest were too optimistic. Is there a methodology for optimising this sort of scenario?
The alt daily specifically says no discussion of ICOs, so I thought this was the right place instead. 
yeah I agree not expecting far lower than 8.5 if it manages to get below.
Same, this looks bullish for bitcoin generally. There's a distinct lack of fear it seems.
On the 4 hour the move up from the lows on the 26th might be seen as a bear wedge ending right below those earlier highs.You could say that the attempt to continue the bullish move has been pretty bearish.
It wasn't on the hour, these are my limits that got filled https://i.imgur.com/CCGVqwx.png 
EOS shit show has started, its tanking like a hero
Yes but alts like ETH, BCH and LTC have hit the lowest for the day which does suggest a start for a wider move and can drag BTC along...
I was confused too.  BCH got it's ass kicked proportional to its price, BTC is just seeing normal range of volatility, maybe caused by BCH.
for bch? cause that's $667 for BTC...
$7000 would be the third higher low I've been looking for before the next big run up, but this weakling won't get it there.  Third higher low looks like it will be aroud $8750, and -- yes -- up trend still very much intact at that point.

This guy will go down as one of the biggest morons in financial history.

[Edit for clarification: Bitcoin usually has three higher lows before a big run up.  I see $6k, $6.6K and now maybe $8k if this guy wants to blow a billion trash-cash dollars or so]
Yeah lol. Doesn't exactly look intact.

Can you show us your 150+ BTC position, then? Since it is not even that big after all, according to you....
Not anymore.
Appreciate your understanding and support mate. :) Apparently, the hive minds only want to listen price going up and all that. I have received many upvotes in the past for posting such posts when I had different opinions. 

At the end of the day, I am trading for my self and any gains or loses will go to me only. So I do not get very sad with these downvotes. Whats saddens me more is the ignorance of some of us here. 

Thanks for a positive comment. :)
BCH is Satoshi's vision. BTC belongs in the alt threat.

^/s
Where does smart money funnel those BCH pump n dump profits? 

BTC+ETH 

Of course it has implications in today's context.
Not according to shills. You honestly expect me to believe *you* over shills?
True, but besides that usually consolidation like this with a failed attempt at resistance 9.8k leads to downward movement.
Further - as in resuming the trend that we seemingly broke out of on April 12. I don't see any brouhaha about making such a statement. 
Yes, I am implying this is a huge bull trap that started on the 12th and  has reached a top now as shown by the consolidation.
Short term resistance seems to be 9.8k. We attempted once this past weekend and broke back down to support. 
What's yours?
it was 3 million. and he announced his stops - its upper bound of what you can talk about and not sabotage your own trade.

I don’t really get it. What can you have as “an exit strategy” from that?

Theoretic question: what if, let’s say, we will get a confirmation that tether company has half of usd in their bank account of the amount that they supposed to have. Will each usdt worth $0,5 or will it crash the price completely and make it worthless?

What does that even mean?

I agree. Don't forget someone bought approx. 35k coins a few weeks back. Let's say there was 18% slippage: that trader is still up 30% on average and the retail market has stalled. I'm pretty sure I know what will happen once all those coins have been sold (absent a follow through).

I’m long from about 9150 right now, would you recommend closing if it gets below that 9185 support for any length of time? 

Currently my stop is set close to $9000. 
That’s not trading, that’s gambling. 
You'd be surprised how quickly your profits can rack up, even if you stick with relatively low leverage scalping. 

Let's say you start with $.01 btc and successfully scalp 2% worth of moves on 5x leverage each day over the course of a month. 

Assuming you were successful each day (which is a big stretch, but still), you'd be at .13 by the end of the month. Or 13x what you started with.
Slow and steady does it. I went from 0.1 to 3 btc on my bitmex account in 3 months or so using max 5x, but mostly 1-3x. You’re only going to lose everything using such leverage. Its gambling, and not the smart kind.
Have been able to turn 0.03 into 0.5 over about 6 weeks.  We have some great resources here, especially chewtoy.  Pay attention to what his position is and avoid going “against” his position and you will do well.  Cut losses early and let the winners ride and you can turn a small stack into a nice one if you are patient.  

Don’t use more than 10x leverage and probably 5x is better.  25x and and higher will liquidate you before you even find out if you were right or wrong.  
1st make the million with your own work. That is the point.

Exactly 
I've been in financial trading since 2011 and can say with 100% confidence:

I don't have a fucking clue what's going on right now
noone owes you anything lol
Yeah just sharing, not saying yours is invalid.

Indeed, I think of resistance lines as zones where the closer we get the more likely the momentum of the price will be impeded, and not as a hard strict barrier where the exact crossing is meaningful.

That really stings about your long.  It was the *perfect* position and size to be holding right now :(

I can't be particularly happy with my management lately in terms of profit, but at least I haven't caused horrid losses.  A couple gambling trades, plus attrition of <1% losses have outweighed all profit since the 19th though.  So much wasted effort.
Sure. here's mine
https://www.tradingview.com/x/AdzFQ8sP/
Haha, yeah... This is the standard "regression trend" in tradeview. So far the general inclination looks pretty aligned. I am not a TA expert. 
No, I am saying that the choice of time window is critical for the message, and that a time window of 4.5 months is a bad choice in our current situation (for reasons mentioned above).

For example, here is the 30-week MA – which is also often used – pointing upwards:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/kCYkZeVl/

(E/S)MAs are one class of indicators among many, and should be considered alongside with resistance and support lines, and with other indicators to get a balanced perspective.

Simply looking at two MA-based indicators (that's what he did) with an arbitrary choice of time window won't give you much insight here IMO.
Ahh, I see now. Thanks :)
It appears that I am now indeed level 2, but no trace of the process...
Valid point. There's no doubt we've been very bullish these past few weeks. I'm just being a little more cautious now lol.
Agreed 
> Both bear and bull cases are valid here.

Absolutely. Subjectivity often shines through is all I'm saying.


Hmm, interesting.
What I see on finex's chart, is that since the parabolic push to 9.7k, the only time we've spent at 9.4 is in Bart's hair and we've only tasted 9.5. https://imgur.com/Zf39vnF https://imgur.com/49wjZz8 

9.4 and 9.5 resistance is legit.
I am.
Look at the daily interest percentage. 
Longs are much much higher than shorts.
If you believe the swap market is also relevant, check out the funding rate on bitmex.

Longs far outnumber shorts right now my man.

Really? Bc I would sell the current contract all day at that premium..
In their defense, that's not an unfair assumption to make. 

I'd imagine that the most common search terms that new sign ups use to find the site are something along the lines of: 

"How to short bitcoin"

"How to long bitcoin"

"What is Leverage Trading Bitcoin?"

"Bitcoin Exchange"

I'd imagine that the majority of their users aren't experienced day traders looking to move to bitcoin. But instead just average Joes and Janes trying to get rich quick.
thanks for the observation

for the impatient, their help page seems to suggest it is a knock out barier option:

> The fact that this was mainly accomplished by spot buying 

Tautology. Downvotable? Maybe not.
Each drop has been proportional smaller too though right?  Just painting a symmetrical triangle as far as I can tell.
It's because we are drawing a bull penant here. But a lot of it seems to me pure manipulation. Not like I'm gonna get in the way of whales
I thought so, too...but looks like someone market bought 180K contacts in one shot, actually.
That is true
..or can they?
> The target would be 9320.

Agreed, I think it could go to 9300, plateau, then fall further. That's what I'm looking out for. Might sell a little as a hedge (if) it hits 9300.
The problem is the market maker has no competition.(bitmex itself is the only entity allowed to market make currently)
Interesting. Could you write one?

Sorry not able to look for myself rn
what stops you from manipulating the market on bitmex?

Just long and short big orders and move the markets for a few minutes.
Winner winner, tuna dinner!
[removed]
I'm still long from $8,773. 
That can be said of pretty much any asset that's ever existed. Investment in the stock market is based entirely on the assumption that values generally go up. 

But it stands out to assert it when we were at 20k a few months back. People choose to trade with a view to outperforming the market, which means buying **and** selling.
> just some whales with an irrational hatred of Bitcoin selling at a loss. They're almost out of coins. We will see a new ATH soon.

I'm sure you have some strong evidence to back up those strong opinions of yours, right? Want to share with us? Otherwise it just sounds like you have a bullish bias, overactive imagination, and lack of experience with market cycles and human psychology....
Hmm?

> I watch his videos almost daily. The last 30 days, I would estimate he called out 1.3k about 15 times, maybe 4.5-4.9k 5times, 3k maybe 10 times. Rough estimate, u can verify yourself.

No he didn't. He said that Bitcoin *could* go down to 1.3K. That's very different than what you're claiming. It's dishonest to say that he's saying that this scenario *will* happen.
Yeah I've caught a few of his trading videos recently and he said he was still bearish but sounded somewhat neutral. Still, it seems early to call him wrong. The A&E hasn't even come close to completing yet so you're really jumping the gun. This could easily just be another DCB, in which case it seems very likely that 6K will not hold.
When it comes to any trading decision, it's best to go with the philosophy of "the trend is your friend." 

If the market is trending up, looking for excuses to trade with the trend is generally going to lead to more success than looking for excuses to trade against the trend. 

So in that respect, I'd agree with him.
No - the chop is just saying calling it a true hidden bear div was slightly premature as a local high on that time frame hasn't quite been confirmed. A break down from this range (~8600) would give it more weight.

It wasn't so much the div's effect being resolved, more so that it was just saying it isn't really divergence. *Yet*.
But is it really valid as RSI is based on close and that week closed at +-8000 ?
Yes, I agree. I'm referring specifically to the overall sentiment of rule 1, in which divergence during chop/consolidation isn't an especially valid signal since the price could just continue (in the case of a hidden bear) increasing and invalidating that particular lower high.

Edit: Heavily disagree on hidden bull on 1w. Open/close prices for RSI divs are the most important - when the price was down around the 6k low on the weekly, the weekly RSI was much much lower.
agreed
if it stays in this range, it can ride out the overbought condition and possibly avoid a crash/major correction, then shoot up.
Trading sideways is the best it can do.. tahts why im short.
It either consolidates (bullish) or crashes..

I would be... but I keep holding out for 9700+ and not cashing in the positions opened from the bottom of the range!   And keep hitting stop losses for pittance profit at higher lows.

When I feel the range is contained, and I'm not going for a longer term thing, then I *love* being ranged.

So next time we go up (if we do) I'm going to sell off more of the long than just a couple ladder rungs like I had been.  Of course, the time I do that will be the time we break 10k ;)
Ohh Thank you!!
Not yet....if you do it for another month and then trade, it'll feel like somebody else is doing it for you. 
I think the best is to make moves before thye happen. Nothing wrong with shorting at 9350 yesterday and holding it instead of closing now
just out of curiosity, but what is your end goal?  Are you attempting to short this to zero, or just until you think it is no longer overvalued?
ill short, but after a pump, not a dump
Most of this is noise until we fall below $8.6k and even then it's still a bullish trend until we fall below $7.8k 

I don't believe in that upwards channel thing, far too steep to be valid. I'm looking at the breakdown of the pennant and 9180 support here. Believe it has potential to drive sell *momentum* as we move into tomorrow and America wakes up.
Honestly the price action + volume here tells me the bull run is over. No matter what price we hit, it's only sustainable with about 4x this volume, or if we consolidate for a couple weeks. Seeing as how so many people bought into $9.2+, fiat is probably exhausted, so it's highly unlikely there is spare money lingering around. Also, we're coming out of the tip of a bull run as well as a insta-recovery, so that adds to unlikelihood of more sideline fiat. 

A couple weeks of consolidation puts us out of the bull channel for sure. I'm thinking we're going to head for 8.8 in the next 24h, but if we hit 8.2, bear market is back in action. Yikes!
Next 2 weeks are critical
It's true, I market make on bitmex. $10m in assets on there 
they clearin stops.. system was gettin clogged with stops so a few super accounts log in and clear em out.

You can certainly plan for something *if* it happens, I'm just saying you can't make current decisions based off them. Like saying "If we break 11.8k I'm going to go long with x amount because of the A&E bottom" is fine. Saying "I'm going to go long now because we look like we're forming an A&E bottom" is just bad trading, even if it ends up being right.
I absolutely do and I’m fine with it going to zero.  Play safe.
What'd I do?
Yes. I had around 4k and it took me around 5 hours to get the individual trades out then another 2-3 to get the P/L.

If you have any programming skills, I'd write a python script to do it for you. The method isn't hard, it's just tedious and time consuming. I was too lazy to script the process and fucked it up the first time, having to do it all over again. Wasn't fun.
Nobody does Bitmex, you have to do it all in Excel/OpenOfficeCalc/GoogleSheets.

The formula is:

> ((exitPrice/entryPrice) - 1) * position size
Oh I think you mean the price for each trade? It's on the trade history section. Use the "lastPx" in the trade data CSV you download in the trade history part of the account page.

For transactions that don't have "lastPx" (like funding transactions, for swaps), you should use the "price" column.
Margin increases your risk so if you short 3.3x your entire margin account every % point it moves it's 3x more profit/loss. Short 1BTC @ 9300 with a limit to buy back if it goes above 9500 would lose you roughly $200 per BTC if it gets hit. If you short 9200 and buy back 10% lower (say 8200) with full 3x leverage you gain 300 (10% x 3)
You got it, buddy. Joke's on you. Only people with a grudge agains Bitcoin are selling. They will regret it, just like everyone who ever sold a large amount.
Should clarify, what I meant by "hedge" was a desire by someone to get into a long position before prices rise. Not saying they are, but that move - to me - is quite indicative. 
I *knew* it was you!

Quit the yelling, man...and while you're at it, turn that damn music down. I'm tired of hearing "Highway to Hell," "Get Low," "Drop It Like It's Hot," "It's Going Down," and "I Need a Dollar" at all hours of the day and night.
Got a shred of proof to back up that rich imagination of yours? If not, please stop with this line of thinking. I'm tired of reading fan fiction in every Daily thread.
Large-volume buying: organic, gluten-free demand.

Large-volume selling: "senile old farts" driving the price down.

Insert Morpheus meme:

*What if I told you...the people selling large amounts now are the same people that bought large amounts earlier?*
To somewhat counter my trolling (which is regrettably necessary because there are still way too many people who think like you do): there are reasons for this kind of market action that have little to do with conspiracies, suppression, and senile old farts. There is a reason for the age-old saying that "the market takes the stairs up and the elevator down." When there is weakness in the air, people start tripping over each other to get out while the getting is good. This turns into people mashing the sell button as price begins to collapse. The effect compounds upon itself until knife-catchers overwhelm supply, and price consolidates. And yes, this effect happens in reverse, especially in bull markets. But for some reason people don't complain about it as much then (unless they happen to be short, in which case Soros market bought *all* the coins).
In any case, I relate to your feeling that we could be either re-accumulating or working on distributing to the abuse.
You're okay for now. Wouldn't hold through another dump below $8900 though personally 
It certainly can.
$9.2k will probably fall. If you look back at the support at $9.2 around 14 hours ago, it held on really weak volume. Reeks of disguised support to give people false confidence hitting it here. I'd wager it'll fall in 1-2 hours from now.

Edit: Gone in 9 minutes. It'll probably bounce around here before we go below $9k. I'll be generous and give that one 1-2 hours.
At the end of the day, ta its just a tool that gives a hint about market sentiment. If you see a lot of bearish formations falling it means that the market its bullish and viceversa. 
Not really. 9175 its the middle.
Honestly closing at break even when a trade goes wrong is a privilege. I Have a bit of a bear bias lately but this looks pretty bad to me.
What’s ur DCA? 

I may close too and sit it out for a bit. 
I’m just saying that claiming bears are wrong is biased and foolish. Im bullish, Im not naive
Eh, if bitcoin goes sideways for a month, I suspect eventually more people will sell than buy.
I meant go long now for 50% and buy the other 50% if/when we go down.  But with those targets of yours that would not be recommended!
I was eyeing 9200 so I barely missed it. I've missed a couple entries due to being just a few dollars out of reach.  I think im going to start splitting my entries up to catch them a little better.  Little money is better than no money.
Hot potato is a shitty game. Also, this just in, low market cap, shit liquidity, manipulated pump-n-dumps "outperform" well-established market leaders. Whodathunkit?
Days of our Coins
I coulda sworn that was regular divs
Yea.  I mean, you have to be a bit delusional to think that could be sustainable long term . if anything it acted more like resitance than support. 
Honestly I'm not sure. Right now if you're assuming a bull market then it's definitely a risk to sell at any point. I had this all of yesterday, sold high expecting to buy lower and it then continued to go up. To the point I thought 'screw it I may as well hold' - Then it drops overnight.

If I was how I was a few weeks ago ( neutral / bearish ) then I'd find it easy to step out and wait for a dip. But right now there's a lot of buying strength. The only thing that's flipping me slightly bearish is that we've not got to / past 9500 lately.

If anything if you aren't sure sell half rather than all. Loss or profit it won't be as much or painful. But cashing out is always a win. Even if the price goes up.
In this case, you're explaining that an ICO, or series of ICOs are a scam. That would be allowed there. Shilling ICOs is what we're trying to prevent.

If those are buys, congratulations!
EOS will bounce , lots of hype around it 
I'm sorry I don't understand what you mean.  Maybe I'm a bit lost...

I was posting the price delta of BTC since this drop started.

Edit: nvm I get what you mean now.  Yeah BCH got a high proportion drop indeed, but I was talking about BTC.
that's fair- I'm eyeing $7800. Just for this run up at least.

Did 2015 bear market end after 3 slightly higher lows? 
Check mate.
I just hodl. What do you expect? Screenshot of my wallet? You would say it is photoshopped and I do not have immediate access to it anyways.

150 BTC is small money itself, 150 position is simply nothing. 
Send me 5 eth and I'll send you back 10 eth.

*Then you'll believe*
That's a pretty damn important outlier though. 

If you are looking at a trend as strong as "100% of the time in the last 6 - 8 months when x happens, y happens" and suddenly Z happens instead, I don't see how your reaction is, "well that was obviously a fluke" instead of, "hmm, perhaps sentiment is shifting and z is the new expected outcome." 

I obviously wouldn't completely change my outlook until Z perhaps happened a few more times...but I wouldn't go recommending everybody expect Y again either. 
Yeah, sure, a three-week bull trap... top... uh huh... tell me more.
Tree fiddy
Bitcoin is one of the fastest moving, volatile, and also profitable assets our there. You'll have a hard time finding something this quick and exciting in the regular financial world.

This ain't no casino where roulette wheel only spins for 30 seconds. (Luckily!)
So if anything less than 2000% gains per year are happening it's boring to you? Even though we've been bear, 2018 has had great trading opportunities. We've had multiple 30-50% moves which on leverage could have made you double or triple your stack. Or more. BTC is still one of the most volatile assets out there, opportunities are always present, it is far from boring.
It'll definitely dump, but tether doesn't hold up the market by itself. Bitfinex being insolvent would be a huge deal and would trigger 2014 bear market again for sure but it wouldn't mean btc goes to $1k in a week 
I mean, so many traders were calling for 6k after breaking through/testing 10k.. guess they had a good chance to be right eventually calling it throughout the whole bull run..

I just did. 

Ta. Trend analysis. Ta it's a tool not an oracle. 

If you can't see the smtriangle (you could consider it a bull penant) then I'm not sure why you do ta.
There it's more to it than ta Voodoo. Particularly if you just draw two lines and call it a day. 
As you can  tell by some of these comments, some people aren't here for discussion, they're here to feel superior to others.

I don't put much weight in it though.  Vanteyx has been a redditor for 3 months.  Snarky comment, 3 month redditor, basically auto-ignore.
So you're just spreading crap to support your position? 

Not cool.
hey bro i still have my long from 9470. What would you do if you were me right now? lol
"When's this dead dog gonna give up?"

Thanks for digging out the link!
Well, it's far from a bad spot to consider closing a long. 

You'd be getting at at roughly breakeven, which is generally a good risk management strategy to employ when trading within an uncertain range.
This is pretty much what I've been doing and it's going well so far. I've found an amount and leverage that I feel comfortable with losing when it's not going my way but is still high enough to justify the effort/stress involved to get a decent return when it does go my way. 

Hopefully I'll continue to do well and my new gained experience will mean as my stack grows I'll be able to increase my position sizes without feeling like I'm too exposed.
I think this is what I needed to hear. I keep feeling like if I'm not making massive trades, that I'll never "make it" in this market. But your post helped put things in perspective, so thank you for that.
 "Steady wins the race"
I assume that happened in a bullish market, but now i don't think it's that easy anymore.
I like it too. Let's encourage people to stop looking at it as a less important place.
This isn't an argument.
Well, it is the most common reversal pattern.
Lmao this shit really is ridiculous. a range between $6-12k like it's no big deal swinging back and forth 50-100% every two weeks 
Then you are good, I guess.

Actually if I remember well I had also not received a message and instead only saw the new status on the Binance profile; it entitles to withdraw value of up to 100 BTC/day.

As long as longs aren't 1.75x the shorts they aren't high. 
I'm not mocking them, I just found it funny since a stock trading app did the exact same thing not long ago and for the same reasons. The reasons are clear and very understandable, saves them time.
longs can push the price up 
Oh damn you're right. Was watching the orders and guess I missed it, should have checked the candle volume too.

Interesting to see if that was actually keeping spot price suppressed and we move back up now.
It's just a tradable instrument at the moment, appears alongside futures and swaps:

Have nine years of enormous gains not convinced you that you can't outperform this market? Then I can't help you.
Proof is in the puddin', pal. The market wants to go up, and the people who have been spending money trying to drive it down are semi-retarded losers.
That's why I said he could still be right... but I don’t understand why he’s still leaning bearish based on the chart and all the info we have now
The weekly candle that saw RSI fall into the low 40s closed in the $6,000s. It wasn't until approximately 2 weeks later that the market made its way into the $8,000s.
Totally agree. 

Relying on hidden bearish divs now is potentially the same as relying on hidden bearish divs in the $7,800 to $8,400 range. 

Within that range, there was a super compelling argument for hidden bearish divergence from the 1h through the 1d. The Big Green Candle created a situation where RSI was well above what it was during the bounce from $7,300 to $9,200. 

And we obviously all know how that turned out for anybody shorting based on those hidden divs. 

If the market breaks down from the current range, then the bear divs will be more compelling and a continuation of the downtrend will be more likely than it is now. But until there's a breakdown, it's best to just assume the bear divs are just waiting to be invalidated.
If BTC went even remotely close to zero, my short would be worthless. In fact, if bitcoin went under even $100, my position would be worthless.

This is because I'd never be able to liquidate the coins so the paper value of my stack would be meaningless.
What position are you in (if you don't mind the question).

I'm mostly in fiat, some short from 9445.  Waiting to exit short and get in some good 1X longs.
> too steep to be valid

steep? it is the least steep movement we had since october/november
As always :))
Unfair advantage...
No offense, but color me skeptical. Unless you were joking, and my sarcasm meter needs calibration?
Every time bitcoin moves lower for a couple hours it's doom and gloom. Was also here in 2014 and doesnt feel anything like that at all. 
Thanks again.
last to the party... there's no greater fools left..




Yeah, the dumps are quick, and whoever is selling is clearly not trying to get the best possible price.  They're clearly coordinated and may even be orchestrated by a single actor.  Sorry you can't see that very obvious fact.
So perhaps you can explain why someone would market dump a large amount in a short period of time rather than doing it OTC or over a period of time using limit orders.  Perhaps you can also explain why the market drifts upward except for these great bursts of emotional dumping.
It's not the market buddy.  Look at the volume spikes.  If it were a natural selloff, it would be more consistently going down, but, in fact, it consistently goes up.  There is no reason to dump a large quantity of Bitcoin on the market in a 15-minute or 1-hour period at market prices other than to drive the price down.  Or maybe you think people just mass panic for 15-minute periods, then buy, buy, buy steadily for hours, days or weeks on end.  If so, you're wrong.  But I think you know what's going on here.  

Or perhaps you can think of a reason to dump 10,000 BTC in an hour rather than doing it over a period of days and weeks at the highest possible price.  If so, I'm all ears.
Or, now...
yeah finex just keeps on selling into this one... usually see a few big buys at support but none here yet. MMs may be finished passing out expensive coins 
GDAX hasn’t quite gotten there yet, not Bitmex.
You're right.  I'm just salty that I've had that privilege a lot over the last week for trades that didn't go wrong that I failed to take the vast majority of profits on.  And "break even" just meant <1% loss which actually added up enough to notice.
A craptastic 9260.  Still sitting on my hands.
exactly, since people don't invest in btc, they just speculate. Lets be honest, no one buys to use it 
Oh, by "going long" that usually means with buying with leverage. Meaning you take 50% of that money as collateral to borrow lots of cash to buy Bitcoin. So if the price happens to go the opposite direction, you get liquidated and lose everything you put in. So if you "went long" with 50% and the price moves the other way, you will lose every penny your money put in.

I think what you mean to say is buy and hold, right? That is distinctly different than going long/short. FYI :)
Doing everything in ladders really upped my game.  By everything I mean opening, taking profits, and stop losses (sometimes fully in profit zone, sometimes above & below the position ca).
The numbers don't lie. 
C.O.I.N.S
I guess the logical thing to do would be to redraw the lines until it doesn't break the channel.
Thanks for the clarification.
Thanks! Very lucky.
I'd have to check it but probably over a period of months.  I was looking for 6, 6.6 and 7-7.5 but it's not going to 7.5.
Sounds like your bullish and protecting a long. Does the daily starting from the 12th really not look like a long coordinated bull trap? If this blows off sentiment will be at an all time low especially if we retest 6.8k levels.  
In the same ballpark as Mike's then, right? (Not that it matters much)

Are you just hedging 1x your stack or naked shorting? Impressive anyway, always looking forward to your comments regarding BTC fundamentals.
cuz you're bitmexing it up with 100x leverage.. I'm stuck on boring exchanges...


Isn't it that tether only will dump and coins will rise? As people are going to buy coins to withdraw to have some value as tether has zero value? Or i'm wrong?
Thanks, but no thanks for your invaluable input! 
Who said I can't see it?
That's a strong ideology you got there 
And you think by spreading the crap I can get to my position? lol!!!
What did you do to your long?
Same, I entered at 9467 lol.
hold til 40k then sell or just hold to 100k and ride out some bounces.

I would lock my losses to max 2% otherwise I feel that the price is going to go up, which I don't, perhaps 5% probability of touching that range and coming back down. Cheers!
Massive trades are actually a lot easier to get wrecked with. Higher emotional investment and bigger risk of market slippage. Players making 7-figure trades on MEX have a heck of a time trading futures due to liquidity, so they risk brutal market slippage in any dynamic movement or else have to pay exorbitant fees. 
You just wanted to hear something that sounds easy but is impossible. 2% per day consistently is exactly such a thing. It was just an example how the positive ROI can add up.
No. January to april 2018. Much easier to make btc in a bear market.

Everyone keeps saying institutional money was buying in the 6 range but if that's true, then they got over 30% in under 3 weeks.

I don't know *any* serious fund manager that wouldn't cut *some* of their position on that kind of move.
I'm bias to bullish at this point and holding a long targeting 10k.   Just trying to be balanced and keep reality in check.  Keep that optimism in check!

That we hovered on that line around 9.4~9.5k, and not hovered on the lower areas, and have been making higher lows, has me optimistic too.

I overall agree with you, but:

> we did blast through it yesterday

That just plain didn't happen.  It was multiple barts testing touching 9.4k, not blasting *through* that range.
Calmed down?
It (the 'mex funding rate) literally doubled in favor of shorters from last funding period.

The way you interpret data is baffling.
Yeah, it went by fast!

And, funny enough, after all that excitement...the walls are gone, the orders are filled...and we're still waffling on either side of $9k all indecisive like.
kinda lame, hopefully they improve/alter this over time
[removed]
What info?
He's talking about the initial candle you're comparing to.

We never made a higher low on the 1W closing price. Instead, RSI made a lower low along with the candle closing at a lower low. 
Short from $9650 swaps and $9680 June futures, profits from funding rate puts my positions essentially at the exact top  

just waiting to close at breakeven or on a very strong push past $9.5-9.6k. since I got the very top there's no reason to fuck with this position until it's in great profits or breakeven yet 

your position isn't bad right now at all. I doubt there will be that much more chop here but it's possible. If we stay below $9250 ish for a bit then I'd say just hold that position open until we see a more moderate correction 
Just go look at 2017 bull market and try to find a "channel" that held for an extended period of time like that one. We will either parabull out of it, consolidate for weeks, or bullish dump. Channels tend to work in bitcoin but they must be drawn over many more candles, weekly candles even, and will be less steep. 
lol was a joke, flattered you even considered the possibility 
After all, even if this is 2014, it should already hit the bottom. The peak in % was lower, so the bottom will not be that harsh. More money is in so not so extreme bubble and not so extreme corrections make sense. Also since more money is in, everything flows faster, so we are already in 2015.

In short if 2014 occurred we are out of it. On the other side the next run might be just shallow and halving will bring even smaller % gain, so we will see that sleazy guy to eat his penis.

> But why would institutions be buying into the crypto scam after the crash?

Why would anyone buy into internet tech after all the dot.com scams?

Its almost like not all tech is made alike.
No sure about that at least to me. Far too much public movement by players and institutions looking (or at least claiming) to jump onto the crypto playing field. And for me there's the iceberg concept meaning if we see that much public commentary on moves by large players then it's reasonable to assume many more are already getting into position. I've been looking at the options market and the OTC market as the latter is really the only way for these groups to get in without making waves. For what it's worth, any news on the volume out of Circle is a key indicator. 
Ya, been there for sure. It’s just been more choppy than expected and nothing seems to fully play out in either direction. I’m sure you’ll gain it back under better circumstances 
Little high, ideally in the 9100’s would have been better but day late dollar short. 

Closing at break even sucks. The fee’s add up disgustingly quick 
Eh, some people do buy things with it.  Just check out the top post on r/bitcoin.
Also, I though this was a good post on why the price will go down if bitcoin simply stagnates:  https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8fqqm4/a_reminder_about_a_bitcoin_fact_during_the_price/
I actually was suggesting to do that under leverage.  Could do some at 9200 and again at 8800.  Or you could bail out earlier and try to reenter lower which risks getting chopped up, especially in a range of 400.  10x covers 9200 to 8.5.

7000s and 6000s obviously wouldn't be clever to do 50/50 from here heh.  But if we get to 8800 and start heading down, it could be good to spread a set of small long orders on a ladder spanning a 1k range.
The topic was about sleeping at night, was it not? i.e. not a fan of holding something that has virtually zero intrinsic value and hasn't been proven in any meaningful sense.
diagonal lines are not very trustrable. But you want to draw channels using a period of consodilation as your basis, not a pivot point. 
nice dude - don't sell yourself short, you had to put those limits in there in order for them to get filled!
I am bullish and holding a long, but my position doesn't have much, if anything, to do with my criticism of your analysis. 

As for a "coordinated bull trap" I don't really subscribe to the notion that there's substantial coordination or manipulation going on in the market, so I simply see an organic rally sparked by a failure to make a lower low below $6,000. 
No, it doesn't really. We broke out of our down trend. While this could be a bull trap, it's premature to call it one until the market demonstrates it. Most experienced traders I've seen are watching this zone: https://www.tradingview.com/x/Tq3rfoKn/  

Also you must be new here if you think chewtoy pulls ideas out of his ass to try to justify a bad position. 
Bitfinex being insolvent would make even the most bullish of bulls question the genuineness of the bull run and the ensuing panic would definitively cause a dump and bearish trend 
The idea of you considering the possibility of a parabolic descent when it is drawing a much more likely formation and acting like it is valuable insight? 
Look at all the comments you've ever submitted on reddit.  Not a single one of them is a genuine discussion, or even close to it.  You haven't contributed something useful to a single community on this website, and it only took me 30 seconds to make my way through your comments/posts to identify that.  If you want to be taken seriously then provide something substantial.  I guess, prove my "ideaology" wrong.
No, I don't. I just think it's destructive to the sub. 
damm how you been hodling up? do you have any stop loss at the moment? what's your plan?
Well, good job to you Sir, then!
What was your overall strategy during this period?
Pitch it to the rest of the sub. If the alt thread is a problem we'll remove it.

You'll have to live with mods subjectively arbitrating over what is and isn't related to Bitcoin if there is no alt thread.
Yeah, I've thought about that too, anyone who accumulated at $6-7k isn't going to just hodl it forever, they're going to take some profits on it fairly quickly
[deleted]
Ah, that is a good point and you are both technically correct. The best kind of correct. 


Thanks!
wha...? bottom for 2014 was $170ish...170/1150 = 2950/20000
you can get some enron shares DIRT cheap if that's you're thinking.  I thought this pump was to unload bags?  Is there something coming up?    they must know something.


What options market?
I was 9100 yesterday until getting stopped out at break even this morning.

And that 9100 had started at 8900 but I fuckin added to it, and then took less profit than the size that I added so it was pointless to have even done that.
Glad to see this. But the ratio of people using it /price is now so disproportional, either the price has to come down or the users have to pick up. 
Ahh gotcha. Thanks for the clarification. Makes sense!
The full conversation is above and I'm a fan of having more money, rather than less.
Analysis means seeing past the obvious and exploring all options no matter how improbable. 

Edit: you can tell from the first four letters of the word.
Thank god I have better things to do with my time then going through your comments/posts.
I do not disrespect anyone here, neither do I trade based on what other people are saying on this thread.

This sub has taught me a lot which I didn't know.
Oh I'm perfectly fine, it's no worry. It's a tiny amount, it's not leveraged, and I still think we will end up going higher than 9500 sometime in the next couple of days.
Bought horizontal support and sold horizontal resistance on 1d, also used the daily ichimoku with (20,60,120,30) settings. Bought the tenkan, sold when i touched cloud etc etc. Really simple tactic. Was patient with my positions and just let them ride for a few days at a time, but with hard stops. Big mistake a lot of people do is micromanage their trading.
?????
The funding rate is just a representation of supply and demand.
What do you mean by "helping the cause"?


Just to add, doing a rough estimate based on the previous weekly candle and the amount the RSI fell on it, the RSI could have been in the mid 30s when we were bottoming out on that candle.
Yes that is exactly the mistake you are doing. It is not about 2014, but 2013. Jan 2013 was 20. Jan 2017 (it is approximate having 2012 was not in July) was 800 after a not crazy year of gradual rise. That is the point here. 20 to 1150  (to 200) vs. 800 to 20K (to 6K). Those numbers have to be compared if the argument is that history repeats itself [not convinced it is the right approach].
Sounds like famous last words. My point stands.
True. And what you just did its i draw 3 lines, if it matches my prediction im a genius. If it does not, either "anyone can be wrong" or "the market is wrong, fucking whales man" . At the very least you should search what happened the past times it behaved this way. 

What happened was a pump btw. 
Obviously hasn’t taught you not to shit post
Damn I’ve never seen someone’s Reddit rep get tarnished so fast, theechonomist is so rememberable  to. 
Ok, what does any of that have to do with you dreaming up conspiracies and posting them like they're fact.
Nice, man. That's a solid strategy. That's a massive ROI for a short time frame.
Ya, I wasn't really paying attention to it in real time. That's a reasonable estimate though.
And so do the numbers.

>f it matches my prediction im a genius. If it does not, either "anyone can be wrong" or "the market is wrong, fucking whales man" . 

ever heard the words, "it may go up or down" .Being right once is not that hard. Selective bias is bad. Plus this doesnt really fit what a parabolic descent looks like.
