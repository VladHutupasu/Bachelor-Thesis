You know the market is all messed up with Centra which was exposed as a scam by SEC and founders arrested is up 80%+ today
Resume panic.
In the last wave of euphoria smart talent in every domain *considered* leaving their jobs to work for companies with a blockchain/crypto component.

In the next wave of euphoria, smart talent *will* leave their jobs to do such.

I witnessed this 1st hand working in the social bubble of SV tech. Some of the most prodigiously talented devs I know are quietly working on/integrating dx protocol tech into their endeavours.

&nbsp;

The next wave will have an order of magnitude greater economic impact. Most lose sight of this after a 'crash'.


Just popping in to say I was terribly, horribly awfully wrong about my long. Carry on. 
Anybody else here thinks no one knows what they're talking about anymore?

Interesting.  Have people seen this?

>I don't want this. I don't want this billion dollars. From day one I never expected to receive anything from this bankruptcy. The fact that today this is a possibility is an aberration and I believe it is my responsibility to make sure it doesn’t happen. **One of the ways to do this would be civil rehabilitation, and as it seems most creditors agree with this, I am doing my best to help make it happen.** I do not want to become instantly rich. I do not ask for forgiveness. I just want to see this end as soon as possible with everyone receiving their share of what they had on MtGox so everyone, myself included, can get some closure.

Most important part of his letter. This would mean the original owners of the bitcoins would get them and Mt. Gox Trustee would not have anymore to sell, nor would they all be under Karpeles' control.
I think this downward pressure may have more to do with what the stock market likely going town today. I have no evidence to support this, just a hunch. 
https://www.tradingview.com/x/d9PVF06z/

edit2: this buy pressure is utterly embarrassing. Bulls aren't even trying. re-entered at 6870. Ignore the below. I'm also wrapping up the work day and am going to be away from a computer for a while. I expect any violent move to be downwards and screw trying to do that on mobile. Sorry for the flopping. 

Exited my short (from 7030) at 6875. Will re-enter anywhere above 6900 if we don't break 7k. 

Spidy senses say this will burst above 6900 at least briefly, and if it doesn't, I'll happily re-enter around 6850. 

edit: typically this is not my trading style. I usually hold (much too long), so I'm stepping outside my comfort zone a little on this trade.
My top tip of the day: the last 20 posts or so are wrong

(Taken from my upcoming book “how to make friends online”)
Dragged down by european markets and DJ futures today? Showing -1.5%

This quote comes to mind :D 

> Trade wars are good and easy to win

If 7k holds today I will look for a new long entry
Target Rising wedge met. I expect a a bounce to at least 70xx-72xx anytime soon.

The GDAX arb bots have gotten quite ridiculous imo. Go from 50+BTC on the ask to 50+BTC on the bid in total flip-flop fashion. Don't get me wrong, I get the game - play MM, make money, etc etc. But this just makes me think that one person/entity has a stranglehold on the operation and that there's no real competition. And/or at least it's clear there's no other real big players on GDAX. 

Not really sure what I'm getting at, but this probably isn't a good presence in any market? Idk
Anyone else looking at the S&P 500 and bitcoin charts side-by-side? Eerily similar with bitcoin as a leading indicator
Here’s what I’m thinking:

1. Bitcoin has reached mainstream. The next time we roar up, it will be heard globally
2. Bitcoin is completely usable again, scaling is in with LN and SegWot adoption is creeping up
3. The global financial markets are teetering
4. Blockchian hype is at ATH

What am I doing? Well, I can’t sell... we’re too
low. I’ve got my trading stack and I do whatever I feel like with that... but what am I really doing?

I’m saving...

I’m living my life the way I want to, but I’m nit going for the expensive butter, the good noodle, and I think twice about ordering the nice beer st the pub... I have it at home anyways.


If we really bottom out... I mean rrreeeaaaallllyyyy bottom out... Maybe 2k... Maybe 1k... but not waaayyyy lower than that.

Think about it... Is Bitcoin really going to never go to ATH again? After the next global financial crisis, and QE, and automation, and worldwide internet via 5g, and self-driving cars, and IoT, and .... wait for it.... blockchain!

The clowns in industry have been trying and failing for years to bring innovation. Only the tech companies impress. And guess where the worlds best and brightest look...

Bitcoin, Cyptography, Distributed Systems, Hardware Acceleration (ASICs), and Machine Learning....

I’m saving my cash from here on out, because we are either in the middle of a bear market with a bottom sub 2k, or we are in the middle of the calm before the next big storm.

I’m buying... little by little

But Im also saving... for when we might bottom out... maybe it’s now, maybe it’s today... I dont see us going sub 6k this week, and we should bounce at some point (most likely violently)

Good luck gents, but I’m sold... Bitcoin is going to the moon. Its too useful not to
I quit margin trading last week because I'm not very good at it, don't really have time for it,  and get married to my positions / go on tilt too easily. Finding entries is easy, picking exits not so much.

I decided to buy a HODL / cold storage stack. Spent 50% of my fiat at 6.8k, now I'm just waiting for a visit to sub-6k to buy in with the rest. I think we're in for a much longer chop / slow bleed at these levels than most peoole seem to think. It seems sentiment has turned bullish far too easily.

The hard part is deciding where to start buying on the way up if it turns out I'm wrong. 

TLDR; I quit margin trading, but DCA is equally difficult to judge when acquiring a HODL stack.


Psychologically, for those who have held this long, there is nothing to gain by selling here.
bitmex fills me 30 seconds after clicking market order.. so late that i clicked another.. then i try to get out and i end up getting whispawed against my will to try to EVEN my position.. BITMEX SUCKS! total incompetance that they cant provide solid interface.
The key level on my PnF Chart is $6,250.  That is the current location of the trend line.

What happens when we hit it?  I have no idea.  The book says that we should be bearish at that point until it reverts.  It would revert somewhere in the $8,000s.  The last couple of trend reversals were quick (a matter of days.)

So, lets see how we do bouncing around down here before we go off the rails.  (And yes, we have been off the rails for about three months now...but you know what I mean.)
I have been selling all what I had from 8.3 till 7.7, then I have bought back @ 6.6, then I panic sold 3 days ago everything @ 6.9 and finally today I have bought back @ 6.8.
Gents, I know the bottom is not here but I could not stand it any longer. Full btc mode on. Good luck to everyone!
Since we have a lot of bears here right now, I gotta ask for one thing. I've got nothing against the bear but at least be rational about it and admit that the capitulation is well underway, and the despair is very close. 

A remarkably high number of bears are actually defending that this is the denial phase, which is among the reasons why their otherwise reasonable opinions are widely downvoted and dismissed tbqh.
Awwww yeah paycheck hit today, you know what that means?  Going to take this fat stack of fresh fiat and........ put it in my savings account lol
I was debating scalping a long here with stops below $6,700...but the r/r profile is incredibly weak despite the fact that RSI is laughably low on medium timeframes. 

Mostly because the upside target is just as laughable. Even $7,000 seems incredibly optimistic for a technical bounce off of $6,800. 

But ya, the market *should* bounce in the not too distant future. 

EDIT: Translation: nobody wants to "buy" here, necessarily. They're just tired of selling. 
Looking ahead to 2022. 

Will I want to posses more fiat $, or more BTC+ETH?

With devs/engineers now being the underrecognized true value@scale creators, I'm pretty darn confident I'll take the latter.

From there, it's a matter of timing, which: if you're not in the 1% who's connected to insiders, good luck.
There was one thing preventing me from entering a long and that was a descending triangle but we just bumped up past the previous high invalidating a descending triangle. I've put staggered buys down to 7k now but they are low leverage. If we start heading back up I'll add more at 7.2 and if we break below I'll sell for a small loss.
Looks like old downtrend line from 9K might be acting as resistance turned support.  [4H](https://www.tradingview.com/x/JuJv9Z5o/)

2H bottom of the Kumo seems to be acting as support as well. TD sequential already hit 9 on the [2H](https://www.tradingview.com/x/VIgPlllf/) and the [1H](https://www.tradingview.com/x/F1dwNwIZ/) which combined with RSI oversold makes sense for a small bounce. If that happens the bottom of the 1H kumo might be first resistance at 6.900, which would be a good target to add to my short from 7.300.

Feeling good about BTC as it continues to hold up well above support of 5800.
Since I emptied my Bitmex account and quit margin trading, it's like I have a crystal ball.

It's so much easier calling market movements when you have no financial interest in it. 
Closed my short for a small gain at $7,350 and entered a long at the same price point. 

$7,250 held. Will exit if it breaks. 

Edit: exited at $7,200 for a small loss. Why do I trade at 3:00 in the morning?
Closed my short at 6560. From down 700% to closing at 500% profit. Will re-enter soon enough but 10% drop in a day is steep.

Over ~ 15 million liquidated in a few minutes. It is insane how over leveraged the Market is. 

This one had to hurt:

>Liquidated long on XBTUSD: Sell 5,438,618 @ 6848
Taking profits from my shorts opened at 7k yesterday that got stuck underwater and leaving the ones opened at 7.3-7.4. Think there's a solid chance we could make a tiny bounce up to as much as 7 or 7.1, where I'll be adding them back, or putting them back in under 6.7.
4h and daily timeframes don't look good for me. That's why opened short at 6850 with target around 6400s. Can't wait to see the result of the trade.
Since the new fiat market additions on Bitfinex their cold wallet has hit 192k Bitcoins.

https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html
We keep breaking lower lows and we already past the 6.7 resistance. I'm confused why this isn't plummeting faster right now. 
Am I seeing some volume or have I just been staring at the charts too long
Well I bought the dip at $7040. Is now when I start trying to persuade everyone that the “bottom is in” and come up with some other shitposting so that they will do the same ? /s

Disclaimer: I did buy at $7040, 25% of stack. 
Not going to speculate on whether this will continue to decline or reverse here.

What I will say, however, is that the complete and utter lack of buying pressure is staggering.

It really does appear that absolutely nobody is interested in buying bitcoin at these levels. And certainly not in the $7,000 to $8,000 range.

If $6,800 falls, I could very easily see this breaking $6,000 today.
I used lightning for the first time today to buy a couple of shirts from HodlMonkey from my Samsung Galaxy S7 Android smartphone using the newly available (Beta) Eclair Lightning Wallet on the main net.

It took 9 cents to get 0.05 BTC into the wallet.  It took 1,082 Satoshis to set up the channel with the vendor (just over 7 cents).  These steps are necessary to get you connected to the Lightning Network, but they should not be needed often.  You would need to do another onchain transaction to empty the wallet, and you may want to have a few connecting channels depending on how well connected your first one is.

Anyway, after that my transaction to buy a couple of shirts had a 0 Satoshi transaction fee (ZERO, Free) and it looked instantaneous to me.  It was really cool!

The wallet worked pretty well overall and wasn't super technical, although setting up the channels right now isn't totally intuitive.  I could imagine having a few more defaults for that eventually.  But seriously better than my first wallet experience years ago with Bitcoin, and it should only get better.

I'm not suggesting that there will be an immediate price reaction to this infrastructure maturing, but I will suggest that it is happening faster than I expected this year and I do think it could impact some of the narratives relating to Bitcoin tech being usable for smaller payments.  I don't expect massive adoption by merchants overnight and I don't think many people really want/need to spend bitcoin for everyday things (there's not any advantage for most purchases), but I think it will be clear that when merchants and bitcoiners are ready, the tech will be suitable for that use case.
Short-term looks pretty good, we have a reversal TD 9 on the hour, stoch is reset and RSI oversold on the 1 hr plus decent support at 6.7, the daily has a bearish engulfing, so maybe a short bounce to resistance and back down.  The daily also has a OBV bull dive but those can take forever to kick in if at all. 
Still holding my short from $7025. I'm hoping this is one I can hold for a while. It's not nearly the weight I'd like, though, and consolidation under $6700/breaking under $6600 was my target to add. We appear to be bear flagging again, so I'm increasing the position by 30% here at 6615 and waiting for the next move. New CA @ $6901.

Eventually this has to stop: https://www.tradingview.com/x/npwQy546/

Since I'm heading the bed, I set a profit-taking close at 6440 as well as a stop up at break-even. This could go poorly, but if my only two options are "lose nothing" or "take 75% ROE" -- can't really go wrong. This move is probably due to getting rekt on my last short. Don't have the stomach for it tonight.
Bullish scenario:
https://www.tradingview.com/x/tGNgkmge/

There is bullish channel, from which we may continue last days upward movement. In this scenario, we have to breach that bearish channel, after which we may consolidate near SMA50 levels, which is $7800-8000 level. 

Bearish scenario
https://www.tradingview.com/x/3ovqkeN2/

On the other hand, from daily timeframe we can see that we reached resistance line on RSI and abovementioned downward channel upper line. This may bring us to sub 7k levels in day or two.

Good luck. 
So far so good. I'll be opening a long if it holds for a few more hours or if 7.2k breaks first. 
I know its OT but but go check out VERGE sub to see interesting developments about their network being hacked. 
So little volume here. One big market sell or buy will have a huge impact.
[Still trading this chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Q8yFcuNH). Opened my short at the light green line around 6885 and holding until the red line, which is about to happen, at 6636. Quick, decent profit trade.

Sad that We have to go short, but... trend is, indeed, your friend.

EDIT: Target reached, position closed, daily profit locked. Made more money here than at my dayjob. Same yesterday and the day before that. Maybe I'm just REALLY lucky.
1h oversold and a green tall  1h after some serious REKTosaurus on Bitmex, and in just the range for the move beginning a few days ago. 

This makes it enough for me to long from 6840 with stops below 6700 https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZRzedKa8

Also my favorite long term indicator moving average(9,26) turned to the upside on 6h which makes me think if this is not a "fake" one like the one at 9.3k his could be the beginning of a nice move up mid term
Placing the recent advance start at 6.4k and end at 7.5k, any retrace back to 6833 (61.8%) is still valid. It wouldn't be failure unless it closes below 6.8k. EVEN THEN, a crash back to 6.4k or less would just make BTC oversold on every time interval and trigger mass buying again, bringing us probably back to 7k or higher. So idk what either bulls or bears are getting excited about, there's not enough buying/selling pressure to push above 7.5k or below 6.4k. We are in no man's land.
I'm normally just lurking, but my trades recently are so bad I feel like sharing. fomo'ed in at 7503 yesterday, expecting run to 7800. Sold at 6775 just now, expecting 6400.
Bitcoin is goddam ruthless. that drop wicked below my liquidation price but I'm still alive. taking my 99% loss and going away for a bit. gg bears
Last time wasn't different ;__;

I'm so sick of the bear market, I'm getting ancy from not trading until its gone, but I'm reminded over and over why I'm not.
This is not looking good for bulls, the last support  line for the 6400-7500 advance was at 6600 (78.6%). Now that the price has fallen below 6.6k, even briefly, this certainly looks like a short term reversal. 

A retrace of the current decline off a technical bounce (maybe when 4hr becomes oversold) or a DCB, might happen at some point, but I see it finding resistance at 6900 and ending there before resuming the downtrend. 

After breaking through 6800 and 6600, I can’t see why 6500 or 6400 would last long. But, there appears to be lot willing buyers in that range so I could be wrong. 

My personal belief is that the next major rally that can even attempt 7500 will be triggered when the daily becomes oversold. 

While there are some scalping opportunities here, I feel more comfortable sitting on the sidelines until clear signals show up. Certainly don’t feel like catching any knives. Good luck people. 
5-6 AM Eastern Time like clockwork
Had added to my underwater short at 7400 and again at 7300 bringing CA up to 7200 from 7k, just added more onto it. 6.8 to 7.1 has shown to play as support and resistance recently, we'll see how bulls react to a significant punch to their efforts.
I’m starting to think more there is a correlation between crypto and stocks. China announced the tariff stuff and we dropped like a rock.
Looking like a classic breach and then recover of support imo, but we'll see. SL around 6.7 seems like decent R/R given how oversold we are here. 

Edit: Oversold on shorter time frames and should be decent support here at 6.8 - kinda expecting some chop between 6.8 and 7 for a bit
Finally closed out the last of my short from 7k after the better part of a week.  At this point the RSI is pretty oversold on shorter timeframes, and I'm just tired of tracking my position.  It feels like neither buyers nor sellers have had enough energy to push past meaningful resistance points, so I think I'll sit on my hands for now.  I think we'll eventually push a little lower (minutes? hours? days?), but I don't feel like sitting around and letting my gains potentially bleed out in funding fees.
I would love to go long here, although only for a scalp to 7k, but i am confused af about the number of shorts still dropping and longs still high. Anyone else feeling the same?
When alts get pumped like crazy 40%+ higher than btc why does that happen?  Is it planned by whales or rumours/news that trigger that?
It's acting like it wants to bounce off support here, but I don't see any support until 6.4. Am I missing something?
Hourly RSI is getting butchered! 4hr RSI & daily RSI values still got a little way to go.
How might one risk-adjustedly optimize their returns on a 'crypto following a networked power law' thesis?


i.e.

How does one bet on solely BTC + ETH (battle for #1) surviving in the top 10 while all other top 10 whither into obsolescence over the next decade?


Added more to my short at 6870. Significant consolidation/cool-off period without breaking 6900 or even attempting 7K. Added as much as I could to keep CA above 7K, currently $7030. Not planning to add more until we break 6700 and hold below it. 

At this stage, there is still potential for a bounce over $7K, but I'm not really expecting it. The velocity with which we moved from 7100 to 6800 didn't really give adequate time for that many shorts to open in the 6900s. Most newer shorts at this stage are probably either >$7K or <$6900. 

On the other hand, this downtrend line is STUPID steep. To confidently short, we need slower movements and better bounces, or else we'll end up with a very tight descending wedge.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/2SiQyr4s/

Good luck all. 
Massive sells are biting, volume very frightening.
Lessons of a bear market:

When you think you are sure the bottom is in... You're wrong
Was long from 6.7 to 7.3, but to be honest I was a bit skeptic of the whole breakout. Just compare it to the previous fall to 6k on Feb 6th, its clear that the volume is very low. I believe that we'll hit 5-5.5k first, then possibly 9k in a few weeks.

Honestly at this point I just don't care, trading this has been brutal. Gonna just put what I have in cold storage, wont be putting fresh fiat in until 0 hope left
[deleted]
I hate to say it, but I’m seeing another H&S forming on the 1hr

Neck line at 7k... this is make or break. 7k must hold
https://imgur.com/6tj2o5S
Hoping to exit my long at cost average pretty soon. Forget this trade. I just need peace of mind. I’m irritable. I can’t even get a good workout in because I’m thinking about my losing position. I feel pretty lame that a market on the interwebs can so drastically determine what my day will be like. 
[removed]
We spent ~5 days undergoing accumulation in the 6.5-7k range, then marked up to what was painted as "re-accumulation".  Fit the mold almost perfectly & should have led to a small bull run.  Due to the price support failure, we are now back in the original "accumulatoin zone" - which is a horrifically bearish signal.  

I was long, all closed and sitting out for a bit to observe.  Not catching any knives.  
6hr about to close and looks like MACD might cross below the signal line by end of daily if things continue. 4hr MACD also crossed below signal and zero line not too long ago. Neither time frames look oversold enough to expect a bounce.

On the other hand, there is clearly some support at 68xx (61.8%) and if that falls, maybe support at 66xx (78.6%). Still, I can't really see enough buying volume to suddenly materialize to bring it back to 7k+ let alone 7.5k. 

I think we either go sideways between 6.4k-6.8k for the next several hours while people scalp or just fall to a new low soon before next advance attempt. 


Don't see bulls having the conviction to hold 6.4-6.5 again
Haven't done a large amount of TA aside from the odd pattern or two iin awhile, I decided to do something for both the bullish and bearish side to give myself a littler perspective.

First off, reasons to be short term bullish: https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/WMroFVut-The-Bullish-Side/
First off, this is only one side of the coin here; there's some bearish signs medium term as well that I don't talk about (possible hidden bearish divergence. 

Here I'd like to talk about reasons to be at the very least short term bullish . I've drawn two bull flags; the larger, purple, one has an uglier look but for a larger formation it's at least plausible. On the other hand, both it and the blue flag would break up on the same movement so maybe concentrate on that one first. The blue one still isn't perfect, but it's definitely more reliable looking compared to the purple one if smaller. 

The more convenient thing about these flags is where their normal targets would lay. The band I've drawn is the 7800-8200 region, which has consistently acted as a barrier to price movement more or less ever since the 11.8k double top . The main takeaway from the circles is to show how the price tends to be reluctant to enter these zones, with their edges acting as a resistance/support. In two cases, most notably immediately before the current crash, the price has been stuck in the area between the flag targets (sometimes it has gone right through though). The confluence there though coupled with it being a psychological resistance makes me think the price should be somewhat magnetized there to test how strong those two resistances are, in particular the bottom 7.8k zone, to at least confirm it. 

7.8k is also the area of the 38.2% retracement of the 9900 DCB and the 50% retracement of the 9000 bounce: https://imgur.com/a/Dmq8f and https://imgur.com/a/iK13w. 

It seems like such a significant level that the market should magnetize towards to test before continuing downward. 

Also pictured is the 4 hr RSI bullish failure swing that preceded this move.

Now, bearish side:

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/NnR0A8Yl-Bearish-Side/

So we fell out of one rising wedge , however you can redraw it to have us still be in a larger ascending wedge if you like. Still some upward mobility there before turning to break down (if it's going to). 

More importantly, no matter where this turns around (even if it already has) there will be hidden bearish divergence on the 4 hr chart. If it makes it to 7.8k there could be it on the daily as well. 

Not to mention all the overhead resistances from fib retracements, log support lines turned resistance, and he ATH log resistance. Overall, the market still hasn't provided much reason to think it has turned/bottomed. We're still within the overall downward channel, let's not get carried away.

TL;DR: like many, short term bullish, long term bearish
Today is a day I'd avoid TA.
 There's no TA for a President doubling down on trade wars while sinking Wall Street. No smart money is coming this way in this climate
lol at people who think this is going straight to your resistance line. remember: maximum pain. We are just consolidating as far as iam concerned.

wake me up but only if we break 6500.
Drawing elliot waves. I think we're about to start the second wave of the local pattern, which is part of the first wave of a larger monthly pattern and the fifth wave of the six year pattern.

Just when Bitcoin gets your hopes up! I went short at 7315 and now am not entirely sure what to do.. There are a lot of contradictory signals everywhere. 

Will the bulls let us break below 7K (if they can help it)? Breaking under 7k wouldn't certainly once again embarrass a lot of the famous TA wizards who i've seen pretty damn confident of 7800. 

Anyway, i'm going to exit my short around 7050 if I can. Then I'll wait and see if we break under 7k before going again. 

What a pisser Bitcoin is 


How is it correlated that the number of shorts fell below the 24hour low, and the price is falling too?
For all those who trade with a trading stack and have a holding stack separate what's the split between the two for you? How much leverage do you work with in general?
Interesting place to knife catch. Shorts closing?
Any info from Kraken as to their trading halt 24 hrs ago?  It marked exactly the top.  Why the huge green wick on reopen?  
34.3k Longs vs 27.3k Shorts, i guess there will be some long hunting
Nearing 2018 crypto market cap low once more.
That is a really nice hammer on the 4hr. I think we'll see 7k soon, but only to be rejected. (However, I was wrong about 7k holding so maybe I'll be wrong about 7k providing resistance.) I'll just hold onto my current position for now and wait to see where this goes. I don't want to sell now only to be miss another pump. 
barted again. without new money coming in this is how the traders get fleeced, deep pockets push the market hard one way and traders bet it will continue but it reverses
Is anyone else thinking that once we get past April 17th, US tax day, that we'll start to see the price to increase?

What are your thoughts? Do you think there is selling pressure because people need to free up money to pay their taxes from last year gains?

Even long-term hodler might have taxes to pay from the forks(Bitcoin cash, bitcoin gold) that would require them to sell some to cover those gains.
Just in time as US wakes up and takes us even lower. 
Got to love it! Every single time.

Good thing I bought on 6.5 area and sold at 7.4k.  Although I only recover my 80% of my total loss from the previous dump.  All in all I am not making profit in this market.
Ouch...and the 4 hour MACD just flipped. I think 5800-5900 is the true double bottom from back on Feb 6. Last one was a fake out to see who was really paying attention lol
Am I the only one that thinks we will stay around this mark as there is some solid, pre-parabolic price history here? 

Seems to me that sideways(ish) is the most likely outcome for the coming months 
Here's a potential play that I'm not putting money behind but thought I'd share since I follow intraday charts for fun.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/PReOmPMO/

We've been bear flagging for the past month, and there's no reason to believe we'll stop here. As I currently have it drawn, we're at the bottom of the flag with a possible move to 7.7k which is an area of resistance supported by Ichi, pivots, VPVR, and your mom and dad who vowed to short at 7.8k. You can tell if it breaks upwards out of the flag that there will be relentless sell pressure based on volume profile above 7.7k all the way to about 8.8k where price would start picking up some FOMOmentum. Keep in mind that we're approaching goblin town and traps, wash trading, stop hunting, and the likes are all fair game, and specifically designed to take your money in this chop. These bots are relentless.
ok guys again all bearish and again I am going long ,,

If anyone got data relevant to possible reasons behind the $200 up movement started at 3:40am UTC, please post for everyone's benefit. Liquidation, short/long charts, whatever you analyze. No trolling please - we all would benefit from this reddit being higher quality.
Short $500k @ $7350. Expecting to profit from a 3-6% movement. Stops set at 10%. May add to the position. 
A wild 8K sell wall apeared on finex. Seems like a grizzly bear just came out of hibernation

70% fiat. Closed short & re-entered long @ $6800. (too much nerves for a tiny short profit).

Yesterday revealed that despite the crash, crypto still has big $ with their finger on the buy trigger.

I suspect many are waiting for a catalyst/for tax season to pass. I expect turbulence for another week.

Looks like only the 1hr RSI is oversold currently

edit: not anymore!
Couldn't even touch 7.8k before plummeting again. The bulls are getting weaker and weaker...

I just bought one Bitcoin with cash that I worked for

At this point, I think I’m done trading until we see clearer. Maybe we go up, maybe we go down, but this range is weird and I don’t want to be trading.

I think I’ll withdraw soon and not worry about the price for a bit.

If there’s a dump, thank me later

Whenever I see bearish price action I get excited about the CC market cap; there are 19 CCs with a market cap over 1 billion. Stacking CCs by asset over the last 3 months, we can see that BTC is slowly recovering but that smallers CCs are still increasing their market share.

* https://imgur.com/a/ssX6a
* https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/

I believe that these trends will likely continue because these small alt coins have effectively become fractional reserve banking for the CC market. As the market drops in value these reserve currencies are able to buy up their own supply in order to preserve their exchange ratios. 

If I'm right, as long as these fractional reserve currencies (alts), currently 20% of the market cap, continue to grow in relative value I think the overall CC market will remain bearish.

Edit: retracted a spurious claim

Well my bear fear respect yesterday was real, and happy I took profits. Sell the pumps and either wait for breakout or break down to buy in again or short directly if break out fails is still the strategy here

And today Dankush or what the name i I can't remember might be happy for riding out his short :D

Edit :Dushmankush it is!
[This morning before going to work I posted this chart with a clear HS figure on a short timeframe](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/89m6zm/daily_discussion_wednesday_april_04_2018/dwsb4ju/), which formed after breaking the channel I shorted yesterday.

Didn't have the balls to go short since I knew I was not going to be able to follow the trade at work, and when I came back home [I found out that it had indeed broken and hit every single resistance I drew days ago](https://www.tradingview.com/x/awYmJVn4).

Happy my TA is so accurate this week so far, sad to see my cold storage suffering.

Seems like we have another leg down, at lest down to 6640. If it pops to 6840 I'd consider it a good entry and would short. Hope I am wrong.
"Dow heads toward 500-point skid after China fights back with tariffs"

go tell me it doesn't correlate now.
7k to 7.1k is current support. For those of you who think this is going up now is the time to buy. If it does hold I would expect 7.8k within a few days, maybe even low 8's. This is what I expect to happen and then we continue on with the downtrend back to low 6. From there is anyone's guess if 6k will hold or not. If support doesn't hold right now then that would even be more bearish than I would have thought and we'd probably see low 6's soon. My short is closing in this area and if we hold I'll open a good sized long. If it doesn't hold I'll be reshorting.
Looks like we might break 7K. Bulls beware
Can anyone confirm: there's only $75k worth of BTC locked in all the lightning network?

There might be more than that locked in ETH payment channels....
So if we break 7k I'm guessing that's pretty bad, right?
Honestly it wouldn't be a bad thing for crypto in the long run if the stock market crashed at the same time. At least there could be a scapegoat; it would be far more damaging to crypto if it collapsed in the midst of a raging Dow bull run. Not that I'm rooting for that, but a silver crypto lining.
Added to $7.3 long at $6.59. Target close Friday at $7.5. If it goes down, I'll dip into my trash cash and replace what I lost on the cheap. So basically can't lose. Never trade more than you can afford to lose. Also never keep more in a bank than you think you'll need to buy a big Bitcoin dip.
I’m not going to lie I’ve been out of position for awhile but it seems way too easy to make money shorting at this point. This feels like it did in December for bulls just in reverse recently. I’m going to start building a long here.

and this ladies and gents is why a few days ago, when people were pissing their pants at the 4% pump.... We don't get too excited!!

We are in a big ol bear market, the grand trend is down. Yep we'll have peaks and spikes but the trend is the trend until it is categorically broken. 

It's shit because i'm sick of it now but I still don't think we are close to ending this situation. Summer time still seems a fair bet to me. Maybe June. Fuck knows, all I know is a piss load of longs just got smashed there. 

They won't be the last 
is this range (low-mid 7000s) a short-term equilibrium or do we have another jump to make soon? (either way)
Not sure I follow [this](https://twitter.com/peterlbrandt/status/981124346289774593?s=21) . Can someone elaborate? Thoughts here? Although a falling wedge is a reversal pattern (bullish in this case) Isn’t declining volume a bad thing?
moment of truth do we bounce off 7250 ish or go straight through it 
Ugh, $90 of slippage on the execution of stop market on september  futures.  That was expensive.  Still, in that rapid volatility not sure if a stop limit would have even properly executed.

Edit:  closed my other long that was CA from 6500 to make up for this loss a bit.

And it happened right as I was about to click a market close a couple hundred higher but I hesitated heh.
I meant what indicators / TA. And if it was so obvious how much money did you put where your mouth is :)?

Can anyone recommend me some books/videos/resources to learn more about trading? Doesn't have to be specifically about crypto, anything that covers TA, FA, strategy and psychology is useful.

I'm working my way through babypips and currently listening to an audiobook about Richard Dennis and the turtles, but will be finished soon and am looking for more stuff to learn.

Cheers!

Still holding short as we didn't break through that long term downtrend. Had we broken comfortably through that 7.5 mark I would have covered.
wow, set a buy at 6680 above that huge buy wall, had second thoughts, pulled it, stepped out for a smoke and came back to 6580. just going to wait at this point, 
So, my guess is either we gonna pass through 6500s, or we'll go sideways for a while between 6.5-7k.
Volume always picks up on the downturn :/
Bulls need to show up to fight back here. Multiple days of gains all erased in one hour.

This is reminding me of when we were teetering at 7.8 after some chop at miniscule volume and then suddenly ETH starting dumping and tipped the scales.
I'm currently a bear but I would much prefer to be a bull. However, most (not all!) bullish posts lately are low-effort, noobish posts by users who clearly have never traded before in their life. Comments which are even remotely bearish, no matter how well written, are constantly downvoted. This makes me feel that the bear trend is not ending for a good while longer. Too much easy money to be made by the bears still.

I don't like shorting and I still have a substantial hodling stack. So please, bulls. Don't get slaughtered so easily. Wise up. The faster you adapt to the market, the faster we can reverse this painful trend.
Just two days ago the SEC filed a fraud case and federal authorities arrested the founders of Centra:

Today Centra (CTR) increased by ~~76%~~ 100% 

There are still far, far too many greater fools in this space. There are far too many in denial downvoting bearish comments, in fear that others seeing these comments will sell and cause their bags to get heavier. There is some ways to go before despair.

Do we think this is just a squeeze to weed out over-leveraged longs, or does this point to the end of the DCB.
Going down and shorts closing... :/ Interesting and not boding too well for a bullish case.
Trading bitcoin this last month - cheat sheet

https://www.tradingview.com/x/u3ozMU9p/
I traded a channel yesterday, shorted at 7485 and closed for a very nice profit.

What I am seeing today is a VERY obvious HS pattern on most timeframes. [Here it is on 30m] (https://www.tradingview.com/x/VA5JVdzr) and [here it is on 1h](https://www.tradingview.com/x/icfYrwIP) and [here it is on 3h](https://www.tradingview.com/x/vOw6RerM).

Mind you, I "drew" the pattern on the 30m and it fit quite perfectly on other TFs.

For now, the base is holding, and my short is closed already, but not looking good lads...
I longed at 6870, simply because of 15M and 1H stoch RSI's being oversold, wouldn't be surprised we climb back up ~$100 before the next drop
Wow, that Bitmex orderbook.

Did you see that? 9 million contracts for sale at 6740s, while bitfinex was pricing 6780-6790s. That was eaten in a halfminute I guess. Closed my short relatively low thanks to him, but couldn't open long due to overload. But anyways, this seems bearish af in medium term. We didn't break that downward channel at 7400s, and now paying the price. 
Funny how the sideways bear market actually is more psychological demanding than just longing dips and being angry when taking profits to early. More things to keep in the head here, and of course shorting has the limited upside meaning it's more dangerous.

But I an still grateful for good learning opportunites
i got a feeling is almost time for some nice shorts covering.
going long @ 6750

EDIT:
SL at 6380
going to sleep ... see you guys 7K in 10 hs 
There is such low volume on this candle. Any experienced traders here think that means it's going down soon? Cuz for real I'm tryna learn here.
....2000btc candle, and 1.8 or 1.9 of that was a single sell I think.
[deleted]
If people are so sure that the price is going to 6,5,4K... why not just open a highly leveraged short and be done with it rather than continuously opening and closing?

I get that profits compound but everyone seems to talk about it being a dead cert so surely it’s riskier making multiple buys in the chop given how much price fluctuates even in a bear market,

By the way, I’m not trying to be facetious. Just don’t get why you wouldn’t if you were as confident as many seem 
There is one unbearable thing and cliché so many posters at this forum seem to repeat over and over. "Healthy pullback" (or retrace). Why on earth would it be healthy to constantly drop? Why this complete and utter disillusion persist here so much? This is just beyond any common sense. 
That was a cute bounce off 7k. Adorable. 
$500k long @ $6688. Expecting a chop to bring a 3-6% short term profit. Stops set at 5%. May add to the position.

Edit: Increased to $1.5m, average cost of approx $6610.

There's a bear at the door, shall I let him in?
I hear a lot of people asking about new lows, etc. Are you guys opening new shorts here? Seems super risky to me, don't believe in this drop personally.
I think it's funny how people personify the market.  Don't you guys understand that for "bears" to sell, someone has to buy?

This is shaking of the weak hands at its greatest. 

...And a lot of margin calls.
I'm from Russia and today a friend of mine called and asked me whether the recent crash  from 10k was because of our presidential election , he gets it.
This isn't a bull or a bear market, it's a manipulated market. Organic gains or losses interspersed with big pumps and dumps. How can anyone trade effectively like this?
Held my underwater short from 6828 and doubled down last night at 7400 (avg price of 7.1).  Was starting to get a bit scared at -90% ROE but held overnight and woke up a happy camper.  Where we go from here is anyone's guess.  I'm sure angry TA noobs will downvote me though because they magically know every single future move of BTC.

Painful to watch, I'll do the contrarian trade and open a short here because alts (looking eth and bch) have been painting a clear bear flag while btc was going sideways, and as there's only bots and no real buyers it will drag btc down if nothing is done.
Just entered a small short at 7300, I think we will see more down side following this [Rising wedge breakdown](https://www.tradingview.com/x/eXk3mQYt)
The market and the chart seems to be repeating the exact same pattern with DCBs, one after the other, but people don't want to recognize that obvious fact.
Looks like a confirmed H&S on the 2h. Target 7000.
Short from 7260. 
So then people, where do we see this ending? I'm a tad surprised we haven't bounced up a bit and held longer around 7100 or above but that's the way it is.

Break under 7000, I have absolutely no idea where the short term low is. Unsure whether to short or not..

Usually this means I shouldn't. So I guess I won't.

Damn it
down with no volume..

and off course when it is at 6900 we got some volume

Alright guys, so I'm slowly learning TA and starting to recognize things and overall just be more aware of price fluctuations and indicators. I made a Trading View account and I was hoping to get some suggestions for people to follow maybe the lesser known guys that have been fairly accurate. Twitter or youtube as well, just so many god damn crytogurus it's hard to weed through.

Think that will help me if I try on my own and can compare and look back and figure out what I saw right or wrong. Also, is there a way to see most recent or is it just jumbled up in the "today" section for charts? I'd be nice to have something less uh macro to go off in situations like right now while I'm still learning. Thanks sorry tend to be longwinded hah
6680 was/is a crucial level on the hourly and forms a probabilistic ubostructive “harness” for the fifth Elliot Wave. Shorts may be long (or pretty darn close to it) narrowly skirting within a hair’s breadth of a coiled market trigger. Doesn’t happen too often... let’s see how it pans out guys.
Absolutely no buying pressure at all. At this point lets just hope the bears run out of steam soon.   
Would this initiate BTC buying from Japan?

Well there we go.. We tried to hold 7k but oh well.

Now let's just see how bad the damage is. No knife catching for me.. Just gonna take a break and check back in later tonight . Need to let the market settle down a bit after this mess.

I would say onwards and upwards but well, we all know for now that's just not true!
So, is it now the time I shall refer to my comment about prematurely  calling out people for their positions trying to make a point and maybe the market will change according to their plan or timeframe for that trade? (:

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/899akt/daily_discussion_tuesday_april_03_2018/dwrdyxh/ :))
Right, but I don’t think these “bulls” and their 1 btc are the ones driving this market right now.
Bulls were cocksure we would at least hit 7.8 before a "healthy retracement". Looks like the pump couldn't even get past weaker resistance at 7.5. 

Seems to me like this bounce was the 6k double bottom attempt which actually exposes the real weakness of bulls. Anyone expecting another double bottom attempt in the low 6's is going to be in for a shock. 

Tldr: bulls need to ~~hold~~ close above 7k here or BTC is <6k bound

stopped frequenting this sub as the noise sometimes affects my psyche.

was in a very profitable big short and i eneded up closing at 7.3.

o wel, be it a bear run or a bull run, things can get overwhelming here if you are trade is against the run.

and btw am short june futs from 7.1k 

lets see where this goes/ 

these futs are a frikking double edged sword though. 
Man, permabears must be getting antsy.  Takes a lot to move the price down a couple hundy but barely a nudge to move it up the same.  Still thinking about opening a short here though.  Somebody seems to have a lot of money to burn trying to bring the price down.  I'm thinking more leverage than usual.  Still kinda chicken though after my last trade.
Finished forming another Bart pattern, great...
Closed my June futures long (from 6510) at 7090 this morning (futs price 7050). Currently have a short position open from 7133 (hedge against the long, same weight). This thing is sniffing for sub $7K, and....there it goes. 

I was planning to write up reasoning behind my expectations of a drop, but the market rendered that moot. We may bounce around $7K for a while here to cool off, but this is now strongly appearing like a lower low is coming, or at least a retest of the low. There's a reason you don't often hear about quadruple bottoms. $7250 failed its retest and $7000 just failed its retest. $6900 is important to hold, and it may short-term, but it's becoming clear the bounce was not a reversal.

This is what I meant when I took issue with people calling reversal or bull market after 48 hours of climbing. The potential was there, but we were so far from any sort of confirmation. We bounced *well* within our downtrend channel. We didn't even make it past the halfway mark. We didn't even get to the downtrend line from 11.7K, let alone ATH. This bodes poorly for the intermediate term.

All the bears are awake after dropping 500$, yelling I told you sooo. Wait for 7k to break to be more confident please. We need to set a higher low in order to set a higher high. You can’t expect it to go to 8k without one big correction underway from 6500$. Big support at 7000 and is 50% retrace from 7500. So wait for a confirmation...

I'm young, no experience investing/trading all that. Majority of my money is in crypto, mostly BTC.

I'm considering moving it to metals. Macroeconomics is a massive entangled web. Everything is connected and i think the global macro picture is not looking great.

But then i look at the returns on crypto, even just 2017 to now, 668%.

But at the same time, bitcoin hasnt seen a recession. I dont really understand the bitcoin being a hedge argument, when macro starts to crumble, retail investors (they're a majority in crypto) will surely pull their money out of the riskiest asset first?

But then i look at the returns on crypto, even just 2017 to now, 668%......

If i did pull out, i doubt i could do it fully but i feel like having a majority of my money in crypto is a pretty shitty idea.

I was curious so I pulled up the daily thread from the sub 6k touch in early February. A taste of what capitulation sounds like?
Are buying and selling btc/satoshi recorded realtime on the chart? As in the moment I bought btc/satoshi right now will it instantly brought to the market chart?  I was thinking of a way if there is a process time delay before they are counted/circulate in the chart that we look everyday.
Just closed my 6750 long from yesterday with reasonable profit at 6838.
Was looking at a retest at 7k  as we had a clear trend exhaustion downwards. looking for a short entry if we break 6430
Ugly ass market. Problem is, people are still too bullish. Until that changes, we going down.
[deleted]
Hoping for a retrace to 6500 and below. 
Nobody is buying anything. The only reason why prices might go up is that people are closing shorts and taking profit. 
Just blasted through 7 and pierced 6.9 like nothing. Buying volume has been completely non-existent since 7.5 was touched.
Down again like a clockwork. Just why?
Ok, bullish scenario which I posted earlier today didn't work. However, bearish scenario did work. What we have now. For bulls:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/2vs7Bvkp/
Watch out for next 4 hours, if the candle will be green, there is a probability that we may make nice little bounce from here in 24-36 hours towards $7100-7200. RSI just touched the upper trendline, which may be the save heaven for bulls.

However, if the 4 hour candle breaks downward that RSI uppertrend line, we may see $6500 in near future, which is lower bollinger band. 

Overall, from daily chart the situation looks pretty bearish. We didn't break the downward channel at $7400-7500, so the next major low is not even predictable right now. 

I guess that the probability of bearish scenario is 2/3 if not higher.

Good luck, guys!
Right now at 6770$, how do you decide if it will go down or up this time?

Permabull hoping to see $4k flash crash. I'll be buying.
I think what's going is the movement is being drawn out as long as possible per rally/decline so that it requires the least bit of resistance... obviously as time goes on movement becomes amplified from a TA point of view and it seems like neither side / or 1 side that has enough influence to decide the fate is willing to move until they are 100% certain they have enough resources to move. Moved down a time frame to see what's going on faster.

I was spamming buy at 6750 with a massive 5x long but didnt get it in because of the lag lol. Like fuckkk. Atleast I didn't long at 7k and get stopped out i guess 
[deleted]
[removed]
So I was wrong about it bouncing at 7k but as I stated previously I had only opened low leverage longs there and got out of them for a loss when 7k broke. Now I'll just be playing the chop to try to get back the USD I lost. I'd rather be short than long now so every tip I'll be selling more than I'll be buying on a dip.

Edit: Furthermore, we lost 10% in a day. As I've stated before those usually don't happen without a small retrace of some sort so I could see us touching 7k again, but only to be strongly rejected.
Bitmex is acting incredibly bearish right now. Not insignificant premium to short compared to BFX spot price. 
I certainly feels like we're en route to a season of price discovery and once at the 'bottom', be it 1k, 2k, 3k, 4k, 5k, 6k or wherever I'm expecting a long period of horizontal trading with a 1k range.

At 7k it's still expensive for the public to 'make a punt' on bitcoin and the lower it goes the more convincing it is to put money in. I think that's where the next bull run comes from.

Until then, down we go.

Went away for a week, and what really changed? Crypto fundamentals are stronger and more promising than ever. Adoption, mainnets, enterprise integration. The only "negative"? We're down from an ATH. We're also experiencing, on average (counting crashes), more than 300% growth annually. It's necessary to allow the skeptics brief periods of respite before redistributing more of their wealth into our portfolios. It's the polite thing to do.


This is a trading sub, but there are some around here who *actually* think this technology/asset class is without value. This belief will lead to the greatest missed opportunity in many of our lifetimes.

Cast your eyes far down the road and get comfy. Whether you paid $.10, $100, or $19,000, you're an early adopter bound to see significant returns in the years and decades ahead.

Just one bulls opinion.

Well guys been a crazy past few months. To all those that got out in December or January mad props. Like everyone here, I don't know if this coin will go up down left right or upside down. But what I DO know is that no one here does either. 

The more I read from some louder users (mostly bears but some bulls) the more I realize how little knowledge of the space exists. One user doesn't understand that shorts have infinite potential loss while bulls can only lose 100% of their investment. This should concern everyone here. The loudest users tend to be the most ignorant. 

Don't listen to these people who don't understand basic finance. Get some sleep folks. Gonna be a long year.
So the market optimism and hope lasted exactly how long? Two days? Oh gosh, starting to really regret I ever bought BTC 
Bear trap, i'm not buying this (figure of speech)
Could it be that we are going for a [diamond bottom](https://i.gyazo.com/797293d492707aabcac6bc24188d2b8d.png) ?

You can tell stuff's getting serious when the bigger alts are in double digits down (Neo and LTC)
Come on bulls hold this together and dont let it plummet.
Gdax down? 
Did anyone see if the buy wall at 6680 was a spoof or it got chewed up? Was 151btc on binance.

Looking to add to my 7300 long at 6600 but increasingly doubtful that Mr. Black-eyed Panda Bear has the strength to get it there. It's taking a lot more money to drive the market down as of late. At some point, he runs out of coins/has to cover. I'm thinking April 11.
how many successfull 50x short trades today?? 100x?
[deleted]
Total Crypto MC now sits at $260B, BTC dominance at 45.1%.  IMO, this is the metric to keep an eye and I think the BTC bear market would end with BTC dominance of at least 70%.  Alt money needs to flee into either fiat or btc quite a bit more.

Just one question , who is selling ? You could have sold at 11k-8k , why the fuck sell now?
Mark CEO Of Gox caused this dip today by starting an AMA.

Noticed this little [wedge](https://prnt.sc/j0os0c) on the amount of open shorts on finex
large scale wedge: [https://imgur.com/a/fW4Pv](https://imgur.com/a/fW4Pv)

the downside was already violated once, so not a perfect wedge.
The more crypto that changes hands here, the better.

it's sad how small this market is and how easily it is manipulated by big players (whales)

Lol @ big buyers/sellers being able to move the price hundreds of dollars

BTC is a joke and the drive to 20k was pure manipulation and news hype


It is funny to see how bulish this sub was yesterday :) We have a long way to go down with many traps for noobs.
What's going on right now? Do we have a whale selloff?  Holy crap.

When those 160k bitcoin get redistributed through the market...
Good lord, if it wasn't for my looking I wouldn't of believed you.
not a bubble™
Same happened with Bitconnect, textbook dead cat bounce and some pump groups of course
Yeah I think so too but it could be a year or two.  I actually started seeing people drop from my company last year and had suspicions.  The market likely needs to grow a bit more to provide more opportunities, but I think we see it and hell I might be on board for a job change by then.
That's kind of you, most people come around to brag only when they were right. Good luck with your other trades! 
Takes a big man to admit when they were wrong. Respect
im still sure that in the long term bitcoin will surpass its ATH.
I have thought this from the first day I ventured into this sub and have been vocal to that effect.
anymore? 
Yep, not a clue anymore.
Once this action has resolved (couple of weeks?) then we will all suddenly realise how right we were back on that one day we said that one thing about what the price would do next.
Maybe? I don't know. 
When we go sideways it’s anyone’s guess, current price action inspires little confidence from either side.
In a bull market it is easy to be right.  In bear village anyone can get mauled at any time.  Welcome to bear village friends.  That massive list of alt coins still have a lot of supposed value and people are not done flipping to bitcoin or tether and exiting positions.  Along with that smart players play safe and know the market will bounce, like it did over the past few days and they place bets and try to extract capital from the market and then wait and try again.  So I think the combined forces of market overvaluation, lack of new money wanting any part of this market, and smart traders using tether and not holding lots of positions so they can focus on a few at most smarter is not looking to increase their amount of crypto.  They are looking at sucking capital out of this market and there is still a lot left.  Play safe people.

I admire your optimism.
No :( I feel left out.
I was nice enough to answer ;)
Yes, reported it.
yes
Yes. Blanket message 

as an arbitrage-trader I can confirm that gdax bots have been stealing more of my lunch money the last months; either some of the bots became smarter and more aggresive, or more 'stupid' people have left (i.e. "people buying bitcoin with their coinbase app while sitting on the toilet"); either way, making money has become harder. Such is life.

also, cf. possibly: https://twitter.com/GDAX/status/956547432568963073 as an explanation for new influx of professionals
I see up to 150 btc sometimes 
I can't see how bitcoin can ever lead the S&P. Especially when one is manipulated by whales and the other is one of the largest markets in the world.
Hey, good catch.

When there's strong faith in the economy, risk-taking increases and vice versa. This is the most speculative (and risky) market pretty much everyone access to, so it would make sense if people pulled out of here first on news that cause wide-range uncertainty (Trump&Tariffs?) 

Whatever, I'm just guessing. Will keep following the relationship between those two though. 


They were talking about this on Bloomberg yesterday, host was like yeah I have no idea what this means 
Inspiring but I would be careful about Bitcoin being the hegemonic 'superpower' of crypto forever. It has many advantages but it will likely not forever be the dominant fiat onramp and offramp. I think it is very vulnerable to the first successful smart contract platform, which I anticipate will lead the next bullrun with a potential media narrative of finding "the next bitcoin". 

>Think about it... Is Bitcoin really going to never go to ATH again? 

We already know the tons of examples of first movers in tech that ultimately never returned to their peak hype. So this is more a possibility than some may want to believe. 

Respectfully, and IMO.
Something that is often overlooked IMO is that Bitcoin is the globalisation of money. Although capital and money flow has largely become borderless, the control over money is not. The nation state is still king. 

The power of states has been getting weaker and weaker for a couple decades under market forces but also through ideological and cultural pressure. In my view the resurgence of nationalist parties is a logical reaction to the dismantling of state power. Bitcoin is just another step towards creating a free and borderless world. It can take a long time before the true meaning of Bitcoin is found, but that's how it goes with most paradigm shifting technological innovations. 



My gut feeling tells me the same, but also that  there is a much more painful  road ahead, and that the bottom is yet to come. Though, somehow, I am not able to put my money where my mouth is ( short my BTC stack and recoup it later on... )

Speaking about the innovations that you mention, I don't think that other than Bitcoin and LN there is anything innovative (machine learning is basically IT guys doing statistics, ASICS things are nothing new, etc...)

The true "innovation" would come from a mass adoption perspective. No matter how we put it, Bitcoin has yet to see a proper and widespread use case. Perhaps how we we may see it happen is after some form of a bank crisis, for example a sweet bank run.

Ironically the birth date of Bitcoin was precisely at the time when banks got bailed out in 2008 and failing to do so, would definitely show us a lesson in how fractional reserve banking works.

The infrastructure around Bitcoin is now much more robust and sound - exchanges, people knowing how to use wallets, meta exchanges (Square,Robinhood,...) so that if this happens there is immediate widespread exposure to Bitcoin.

The recent bull run was fueled by moms and pops trying to make a dollar out of 50 cents, but the true way in which Bitcoin would shine is if  moms and pops would be running away from a bank run..

Until then, owning Bitcoin is like owning an airplane and use it to be taxied around in it.




nice comment dude, I feel the same way and am taking similar action
If you're ever in Seattle, I have a great noodle joint I want to show you. Don't worry. It's cheap.
Or Bitcoin never recovers to ATH prices. Anything is possible in such a speculative market even if you see the possibility as remote. 
I agree and you're rationale is why I also invest mostly in big tech stocks

Are you planning to do smaller chunks with your next buys or unload the rest at once?
Same thing here. 25% left of my fiat to get in when we go sub 6k (target at 5.7-5.8)

Long term this is a verry good price
I disagree. Relief can be had at these prices.
At least it fills you, I usually get the famous System overload those days

fyi, some traders time breakouts based on bitmex servers overload/latency

Just learn to trade properly. In your case it seems a simple "reduce only" would have done the trick.
This channel doesn't feel sustainable: https://www.tradingview.com/x/mstddjnM/

edit: on the other hand, this is just 6400 by midnight. Does that feel *that* impossible at this point? 
Buy a hardware wallet and pull those coins off the exchange if you're serious. Best way to truly go hold mode. 
I think the classifying it as "denial" is because I think most bears expected the bottom to fall out in a capitulation wick earlier, but bulls have been stubborn. Hence denial.
A couple thoughts:

a) I'm personally not expecting a V bottom to mark the end of the bear, which is what most bulls seem to be looking for. As in, Phew, the capitulation wick! Now we get to run back to 12K and a new ATH right after. That sure was a tough patch but we stuck it out! That's not really the way I picture this (long-term) bear ending. Remember that we had *never* seen price levels *this high* just six months ago.

b) It will take time for the conservative investor to enter/reenter this market, not just a brief price runup. So that means new money flows have been set back immensely by what's happening now. By way of personal example - and I am *not* a very conservative investor, I trade - I first thought of buying BTC in 2014. Then Mt. Gox scared me away. I thought about it again in 2015. Then the 2015 decline had me sitting on my hands and then forgetting about it until late 2016. I first thought about buying ETH in late 2015 (really wish I had) but didn't touch it until March 2017 just because I never quite got around to it.

As I see it, most bulls' timeframes are still way, way too short. That, to me, resembles denial. 

Edit: Most bulls' timeframes for an end to the bear.
Capitulation isn't when people are sad about losing money. 

It's when they completely give up hope on the asset and sell what little they have left or treat it as completely lost, useless money. 

This sub has a bit of a higher level of discourse than other places on the internet. There are still lots and lots of people all over crypto twitter, reddit subs, and facebook groups who still think BTC is going to the moon. Even here, there is a huge underlying assumption that BTC will moon again eventually. Even the biggest bears here hold the underlying assumption that it will moon again. That is *nothing* close to capitulation. That's **much** more like...hm, denial? :P Seriously, how can you talk about capitulation when 90+% of btc investors are virtually *positive* it will moon again? 

We're not talking about people who bought at $17k buckling and finally selling. We're talking about people who bought at sub $3k finally realizing that they might actually have to sell because "BTC is dead". That's capitulation

**Capitulation isn't when euphoric fools sober up and realize the price is going down. It's when they think it's never going to go up again**
How are we defining these things?

IMHO, Capitulation is occurring when people who said "I bought at $20k, but I don't care how far it falls, I'm in it for the long term" end up selling because they think btc has failed.

Despair is what happens afterwards, when it levels off because there's no one left to sell.

My more personal definition of denial is whoever says that btc is a "store of value".
More and more I'm thinking the best approach may be a weekly buy for 1% of your bi-weekly paycheck and check it again in 2021 lol 
It’s insane how weak the upwards price action got...

But every now and then, Bitcoin does surprise
I keep waiting for a pump out of nowhere to at least propel this up to 6950 and grace 7k. But man the buying has just been absolutely anemic in this 8% drop. Any rises we get are just from bears getting tired of selling and being patient for better short entries.
What makes you think RSI is laughably low? Still plenty of room to go down on the 4 hr through 1 day. Only one hovering just oversold is the 1 hr but I wouldn't call it crazy low just yet and the 15 min has recently had a slight reset. And as you know, once a trend is set RSI can remain oversold for quite awhile.
Closed my short by mistake at 6800 and have no idea what to do... Better stay out of position now... 
I wonder if the people buying here are really thinking this is the next bull run or they're thinking exactly like you- they're just trading on technical bounces. I think it's more of the latter, really, which is why buyers can't seem to hold a trend for shit
How dare you consider the ~~underlying~~ intrinsic value of an asset that you're speculating on. /s
100% agree with this, but in 2018, I'd rather be sitting in fiat and wait to accumulate crypto at a later date.

I agree very bullish.
for first time I agree with you. 010
Well don't hold back Merlin!
What happens next? :)
I wonder if you'd have the same feeling doing paper trades, still with no money on the line.  It's easy to just say generally where things will go, it's harder to actually hit the timing on entrances and exits.

But yeah, once you put money on there, the fakeouts etc can really throw things off in how you manage the position.
Crystal ball, eh? Username checks out. 
Bu all means, do share your current predictions if that’s the case.
hardest part is pulling the trigger, not guessing where it’s gonna go
Indeed. good to see we are holding the 7k  -7.3K area.
3 day chart

Lets see.

target price 7.5k or 7.8k?
On the 2h, could it be a potencial H&S?
A little tilted to the right. Shoulders around 7400, head 7500, neckline 7250?
I'm usually wrong on my predictions, just wanting to learn. 
That entry wasn't so stupid for 3 in the morning.

4k btc sold in 1h in 3 market orders was a bit unexpected.
Noooo. Don't close shorts at 3am in bear markets man. Let the bulls earn your BTC by feeding you fiat. It's the ideal mentality in these conditions. 
And people roasted you. Congrats mate. Patience pays off 
I agree 10% is steep as, but at the same time i can't see a recovery/bounce either at this point in time.
Solid ! Congrats ! Are you shorting on Mex? Once you close the short, I assume you earn more btc. What do you do with it? Sell it on the spot or hodl?
Great job. I'm not longing, but closing a short in profit here is probably a good move atm. Starting to see bullish divergence on the 15m and possibly the 1h, and the "triple bottom" trend line from 5900 is just around the corner at 6400. Not convinced it will be a long-term bounce from there, but we certainly are due for a retrace soon.
But we're so close to 6K! You think we'll actually bounce there?
99% of people here have no idea what patience is because crypto has trained them to be impatient. 

You can see this when anyone posts an entry and the market moves $30 against them and people start saying shit like "Wow, good luck." and "Sorry for your loss" and stuff
I was told there would be an epic short squeeze
[deleted]
Same here, we'll see how she goes.
do we know what it was before?
In the 2014-2016 bear market, price would go sideways for months. Everybody including myself wants that plummet and hard bounce but market might not be that forgiving. May not last 2 years but this could last months as it keeps bleeding with small pumps here and there.

Support, and the daily candle hasn't closed yet
No volume. It takes only one whale dump to bring us to 6k. Or a pump to bring us back to 7.5k, but somehow I doubt that'll happen.
Agreed. Are you planning to re-enter your hedge short if $6,800 falls?
> I could very easily see this breaking $6,000 today.

@_@ Yes please.
Why buy at 7 if you can buy at 5? ;-)

We're oversold. There should be some kind of bounce here...
If it reverses here volume will be even more tepid. Who will trust the whales pump now? That pool of guppies is dwindling. 
It looks like this may have more room to run on the 4 hour, and the MACD looks like it may be about to flip. Thoughts?

This is definitely the early adopter experience, when it's ready for mainstream channel management will be deeply buried beneath the GUI. But it is cool to see it coming to life. 
Thanks for posting this. It's good to step back and reflect on how far we have come since 10+ minute confirmations and hacky insecure wallets that faked instant transactions.
Two-party payment channels are not interesting. The real trick is if it can consistently route multi-hop payments between any two arbitrary nodes.
[deleted]
Yea I'd be careful adding here, sooner or later one of these is gonna break up or snap back (although I do agree that it still looks weak)
Did we break through the flag? We are at 6800 currently 
In a bear market you add on bounce not break
Damn, just barely missed your TP.  Did your BE SL trigger?

I took profits again on the drop around 6550, and reloaded the short on the swing up we just had, around 6850.  I kept my SL at the previous CA, which is now at a slight loss at 6944, but the previous iteration of TP more than covers that.  
This is getting interesting.
matter of time

patient
so good!

Weird place to start a short but maybe it will work out.
Well nobody can fault you for not being bold.

The 1hr green has paltry volume though.
> EVEN THEN, a crash back to 6.4k or less would just make BTC oversold on every time interval and trigger mass buying again, bringing us probably back to 7k or higher.

If there was new money coming in, maybe. But so many permabulls got rekt the last few weeks, how deep are their pockets?
Is it a usual to have a reversal pattern that has a bottom which chops in a range, instead of a "V" sharp reversal?
The idea is to do the exact opposite of what fees right.

You buy when you expect lower and sell when you expect higher
ouch!  I had a fomo limit buy set for 7500 after it dropped back down to 7400.  came close to getting bit.  I was expecting another bounce too but at this point know I shouldn't be listening to this sub.  Theres a lot of permabulls on the sidelines waiting for the reversal who get drunk on moon juice every time we get a green daily.  I think a lot of the best trades I've ever made would get downvoted here if I posted them right after.
Wait for 5k
Can't blame the bears on this one, man. Blame all-in high leverage trades (hint: that's user-controlled). 

Take some time away and paper trade with 5x-10x leverage. See how you do.

Still, sorry for your loss. I've never been liquidated, but I know taking heavy hits hurt.
[deleted]
ikr, was ready for it
We were dropping long before the stocks dove, months before, and we've had many individual red days on Dow green days and vice versa

That said it's almost definitely not helping
 Whales time dumps to news.

Shorts taking profits, opening longs to scalp to reshort higher 
Order books are thinner, so the swings are larger.
If we are looking at the same coin, there is a sizeable pump and dump group doing the work today. Started at 3pm.
won’t happen, but the next bullrun will be ridic
That's what I'm seeing as well. If we don't bounce off of low 6500, then 6400 should provide the bounce we need to re-test 7000+. 

I'm targeting 6550 with a small buy to hopefully scalp it when it bounces.
Just long whatever you think will survive and short whatever you think will become obsolete lol
Have you read much about the possible development and release of "RSK" for Bitcoin?

If that project works, you **might** see competition dynamics between BTC and ETH shift a little
by buying BTC and/or ETH and shorting the others

aka longing the ratio of other coins to BTC or ETH
I like your analysis of shorts not being able to open shorts at ~6900

It could explain why 6900 is acting as resistance 
I'd add that everybody is already looking at 6400 and thinking about the new low, so it would be very hard for the price to stop here. 
Readded to my short too around 6800~6900 but let the CA slide to 6950.  Let it slip a little too far.  But it was hard for it not to to since I had already taken profits on 66% of it on the initial drops through 6900 and 6800.

Also, 4 of 20 tiny long orders on september futs that were spread between 5.3k and 7.1k have executed.  Those might have been premature, we'll see.
I keep thinking that your take to add shorts here is gonna work out better than my decision to close, and that I may have let my previous feelings of being underwater bias my judgment. On the other hand, surely someone will think 6.8 is strong support and come pump this at least to 7k...right??
I'm just a moonboy, nobody likes me
Until you're not, of course. At some point, one of these bottoms will be *bottom*.
If you want to compare the last breakout to this one, you should also compare the last crash to this one.   
Go check the chart, do you notice a difference?
Personally not a fan of derivatives popping up, but It seems that’s the future of the market.

Re: Tether: I guess it’s either very close to 1USD or worth zero? Or is there another possibility?

Could be useful to hedge against tether holdings?
Ain't nobody going to put their money where their mouth is when it's Tether related.
If tether really is a scam, CoinEx will be unaffected? Will they pay you?


of course Bitfinexed won't do anything, he'll claim it is rigged or untrustworthy or something.  Easier to sit on the sidelines and complain endlessly.
You can already short it 1x on kraken. But you must be patient as fuck, and lose with the fees.
[deleted]
Its already weak, failing to defend 7.3k was bad.

Close my 2x long from 7k at 7.3k after hearing the trump china import shit.

Back to fiat will take a break from trading and enjoy the nice gains.
Non-TA guy using TA 

¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
If you can call it a h&s then 7250 was a neckline and target was at 7k.

I don't know how you see neckline at 7k?
[deleted]
If it's any consolation, there aren't many out there who can lose money (even if it's only on paper) and just shrug it off. I certainly can't. And most of those who can are able to do so because they have convinced themselves they're now *investors* rather than *traders*. So even they still really haven't come to terms with it.
Yea same , tho I had a great workout
Dropping to $1,000 would be relatively harmless as far as the long-term health of bitcoin is concerned. 

Dropping to $500, however, would be a pretty big problem.
$2k would be a good level to buy. I wouldn't care if it takes a year to get going again. Did the same at $200.
Goddammit cut the crap.

Bubble pop in 2014 from 1163 usd to 152 usd bottom was a decrease of 86.9%

A drop from 19666 usd to 2000 usd would be a 89.8% decrease.

2600 would be a 86.7% decrease.

So stop the bullshit and stop acting 2k is impossible and the people calling for it are crazy, it has happened before and it CAN happen again. It also makes a helluva lot more sense then muh ATH in June.
Yeah, if we go back to 500 that would be absolutely ridiculous and not even comparable to 4k or even 2k.  People shouldn't be saying 2k and 500 in the same sentence.  500 is a 97.5% drop.... And don't compare that to amazon because that was a 94% drop, and took 10 years to make new highs.  To go from a 94% drop to a 98% drop you would have to go down like another 66%.
Some of us root our predictions and opinions on what's happened before many, many times (parabolic rises and subsequent bubble pops) and what's likely to happen again rather than what we want to happen

Who wouldn't love free money? 
I would love a btc price like fiat, so we can actually use it as a currency.

The purpose was to used it as a medium of exchange, not a speculative asset where you can fomo 100x.

Whatever price it is, just stick to it. 
Sounds like you hope the price does what you want?  That position is equally retarded my friend.  None of us controls this so treat it that way.  Do not hope, instead just try reacting.  We have a colossal dump I’m buying some.  We spike retarded I’m dumping some of my stack.  My stack is not an amount of money that will break me.  As we dumped and dumped I kept reducing my position.  If I feel the price is undervalued I will increase my position.  It’s simple.  I don’t really care what it does because it is like screaming at fucking clouds to rain.  It is not in your control.  It is based on adoption and adoption is not meeting the amount of crypto being put on the market.  I’m not buying until we dump more and I’m not selling until we go up more.  I have a plan and will never become as impassioned about something I have zero control over like you are.  Good luck, play safe.  Crypto is a trading game now.  There is very little practical real world use for any of this shit yet.  So quit thinking you can better value it over actual money entering and leaving the market.  You cannot influence this much more than a flea and you definitely cannot predict it.
Same thing happened with the .com bubble, but here we are posting stuff to a website

Also, most bubbles are fundamentally fucked up

I still think about the Kraken Whale that kept us from falling through 6.5k. Will he show up again? Or is he done after unloading his position for a nice profit?

I dont know where the support would come from,  honestly.
 
Solid, enjoyed both perspectives and far as Ichimoku its given me similar thoughts, nice bounce up and then rejection, some serious resistance up there.
Thanks for the TA it's pretty good! 


When you say 'long-term bearish', define long-term. A year?
Trump is shorting
I'd disagree. The sudden price drop from that news displays market weakness. Which has been here regardless. If we'd heard about that in December on the way up, we'd probably slump for an hour, and resume the uptrend and people would be saying how bullish that news was for crypto confidence.

TL;DR If news invalidates technical analysis, then anything else that emotionally influences a trader to buy or sell invalidates technical analysis.

Change my mind.
how about TA as insiders shorted the market? or AI analysis predicted the president actions?


I dono, if we reverse here at 6.8 it is more or less the exact target of the rising wedge that broke down 
He's economically clueless. Just like Obama and Bush and Bill Clinton. We will pay the price for all this economic ignorance on Trump's watch, and people will blame "capitalism" and "the free market" even though that couldn't be further from the truth of why the economy sucks. 

Socialism, here we come.
A wise man once said that the market seldom makes it easy to hold on to a good position.
Why do you put so much faith in EW theory? It's always seemed like voodoo to me.

Even so, it seems like you're still having the price rises be the dominant trend. Why? Shouldn't it be reversed in a bear market with the ABC corrections being the bounces and the 1-5 waves on the way down?

Did some brief chart checking and that actually makes much more sense to me. Wave 1 was the initial crash, wave 2 the  DCB to 17k, wave 3, the strongest, the trend down to 6k. Wave 4 up to 11.8k, and now the final wave, 5, which does indeed have lower volume than wave 3. Of course, I've never actually used EW so I may be way off base.
What does that mean 
Realistically can we up to 12k again? I know there would be a rally once we break log resistance, but 12k is pretty difficult.
so why is B to C such a huge wave?
Thanks, great stuff! What are the blue log support / resistance line on your chart, i.e., where do they originate? Is there a zoomed-out version of the chart? Also interested in how you foresee the next bull run play out...
What if from 18k to now we had 5 motive waves down and we are at 5th which will be complete when we reach 5k usd or lower.
Interesting I feel like most things I've read today have us headed to test 6500 and possibly break to 6k fast if it breaks. Im a newb so I just try and use information and base my decisions on it. Would breaking to those levels nullify what you think will happen with Elliot waves? A run to 9-11 seems so crazy right now....
> Breaking under 7k wouldn't certainly once again embarrass a lot of the famous TA wizards

They are never embarrassed.  They just forget about it and arrogantly make their next sure thing proclamation.
it means no one's really buying  the corn
its a weird correlation if anything and is a bearish sign
About 1%. I use far too much leverage. Don't be me.
my holding stack is currently a fiat stack and my trading stack is 30% of it
[deleted]
75/25 holding to trading.  I'm considering bumping up the trading, but probably a good way to get hurt. No leverage. 
One percent trading, replace whatever I lose. I only use very low leverage in case it doesn't go my way right off the bat.
Hey, a skillful knife catcher will stab a knife dropper right in the heart every time.
6500-6600 may be a place to catch yourself under the wheels of death.
Yes, probably shorts closing / longing knife catchers. I think there's going to be some cut hands on this, though, unless they're looking to scalp 67xx to 69xx. My knife catching long (sep futs) doesn't start scaling in until 6600, with buys all the way down to 5900. 
Can't see this stopping here. If this is not a vote of no confidence for bulls I don't know what is. This needs to bleed a lot lower to make it feel like it's the bottom again. 
That's not super disproportional actually. There's room for either said to get rekt.

OKCoin currently pricing at $8,300. 
Already 25B below it actually
Thats exactly how bottoms are made. we made an higher low at 6568.
 However, a significance bounce to 7 K + consolidation is essential at this moment if a tentative is to be made on a short term reversal. 
It's been pretty fun to trade since Jan. Just bet against the greed of others long or short until it really capitulates.
I think it certainly does not help the price.  I can say first hand taxes were a major concern for me and I cashed out most crypto last year then the rest of it early this year and just have a little bit left and did not enter the market with much capital after and even though I have paid taxes and am fine and have capital to deploy I just do not feel it is the right time to do it.  I suspect we need tax season in the books for a bit before this thing can take off again.  I also plan to be more slow and careful going forward where last year I was gung ho and wanted a big long term bet.  Instead a bunch of money fell on my head and I took it and changed my strategy.  I didn’t get burned like people who came later.  So people who got burned either lost a bunch of money, believe in this and are looking to add to their position and improve cost basis, or just want to hold and forget about the market.  People like me want to reenter but play smarter and slower.  For stupid exponential growth we need more dumbasses throwing money they can’t afford to lose into the market and I just can’t see that at this stage.  Maybe we get there again.  Maybe summer and later this year will be good or hell maybe a year or two.  
Having to pay crypto taxes gave me a completely different perspective on how I plan to invest in crypto in the future since I now have a clear understanding that at least 1/3 of my gains goes to the IRS and that is just federal taxes. Even though I knew this would be the case since mid 2017, until you do your taxes and realize how much those little scalp trades add up and that if you don't immediately take profit out you're essentially gambling with the government's money which ended up costing me big time after holding a bit too long.

The risk/reward ratio has changed a lot for me and I'm sure others as well. It definitely makes it not worth it for me to try and trade in current market conditions as long as you crypto to crypto gains are taxable events.


Username checks out.
Some are doing this.  I know I did.  I don't see why people would wait until the last possible moment, although I waited looking for a good spot to sell which never really materialized (I ended up selling at just over $9k and just over $8k... Last quarter my average sale price was over $16k, and I would have sold more but wanted to get some into this tax year....).  Anyway, I don't think the tax selling has been a main driver this year, but it is a real thing and it also provides a narrative.  If nothing else the narrative will be removed which could improve some investor confidence, especially if the price shows some life as well.
Why did y'all take us here in the first place!? We pumped it... 
I personally love Trump's attitude to the US economy, it's like a shitcoin bag holder.

One of my favorite replies to that Tweet: "My new Vegas strategy"
bullish?  Lol, joking, but the instability this guy is creating is probably very bullish for btc.
[removed]
Shit, that doesn't look good.
BTC has one of its most volatile periods and you expect sideways for the coming months? Based on what?
At this point in time last bubble we did stay at stable level before climbing back above 600 in may and then cointinued to fall.
Everyone said this about $8k. Give it a few more weeks and see where the price is 
What solid pre-parablic price discovery was conducted at 6.5-7.5? 

We just ran right through it in a relatively short time. There's no real support here. 
Yes
my crystal ball tells me this could be what happens
What kind of data are you expecting? Thats just "normal" market behaviour in a dump. Traders are constantly looking for signs of a reversal on the way up or down, bots trade accordingly. Give them a little buying pressure at psychologically important levels (i.e. round numbers) there you go $200 in the opposite direction of wherever it was going before. There will never be just red or green candles in any direction. There is always someone making money on the way down, which doesnt work if its just going straigt to $0. 
Seems like you was right, What made you Short ?
If you are expecting a 3-6% movement, why set stops at 10%? Seems like poor r/r
>Short $500k @ $7350. Expecting to profit from a 3-6% movement. Stops set at 10%. May add to the position. 

Just closed it at $7065.
Opes.. be sure you got $$ to cover
Spoofy. It's showing and disappearing since that last drop.
You said you’d start bashing when it went below 7k lol. You still have another hour or so :P
Are we bragging about underwater positions now?
To be fair that's pretty much my logic at this point. I know my flag is bearish and I admit I am a little, but really I'm just tired of trying to trade this choppy market and have been sitting out the last week. So far that's turned out to not be such a bad idea.
I attribute the declining volume for a large part to whale (exchange?) games and market manipulation. Traders are getting tired of their shenanigans.
I bought one BTC today :)
Indeed. If anyone asked me right now if they should by bitcoin, I'd warn them to stay away. I think the only people left in the market are whales, active traders and former small casual investors who are stuck because they bought in high and were too dumb to panic the last 50 times bitcoin crashed... not that I know anyone like that :P
If he actually plans to hold until 2030, he may just come out okay on that lol.
Hes in the game, and probably much more relaxed than us degenerates.
wow, that's a very long story. I don't have the patience that he had to wait for that long
Yikes. RIP
Not gonna lie I'm amused
Lol, these delusional bulls are the reason why market will take so loooong to reach final bottom. Few hundreds dollar pump and they act like woohoo new ATH is imminent. 8k longs already FOMO'd into recent bull trap.
Be honest. You shorted with a few billions at 11.7k and every bounce is you taking profits. Hope you are proud of yourself.
Haha congratulations man.
Bro how good are u feeling now and my short actually ended up good lmaooo that shit was close tho 
Missing your screenshot of the PNL while underwater vs your PNL now :)
Haha I just logged in today to see if anyone had drawn attention to this. Good work
Bulls in disbelief.
I was thinking of you earlier when we hit 7k.
hahhah ooh god
fucking beautiful! 
I chortled.
Re-entered short or long?
still feeling good about that long?
keep calling that sub 6k one of these times your bound to be right, right? 
I wouldnt get too excited. If 6800 holds, we should be ok.
You are doing good... just be patience
I wouldn't call $6,800 broken yet. Buyers are still refusing to concede it by hovering between $6,700 and $6,800. 
Always impressive how exagerating some people are.

You guys can be super picky by going like "Yeah we have a chop between 6769.43 and 6893.23"

But as soon as a support would be broken that is then "If we break down from 6800 we will see $30 in the next 2 hours."

My god, chill. From 19k to 17k wasn't a huge drop % wise but realise that from 6800 to below 5000 is way more important and it's not like the energy put into those pumps and drops is astonishing. 
6400 should be our next support zone.
[removed]
At the moment there are 19 automakers with market caps above $1bn. That number should be closer to 5. Therefore the value of automakers must fall until this is true.
Has nothing to do with alts Jared. This bear market is a direct result of BTC not offering 7k worth of value. 

Simple. Fin. 
I don't know why your post is getting so much hate
Guess you're getting downvoted for talking shit about alts.  

This is the indicator I'm watching closest.  Alts needs to give up more market cap % to BTC before we're anywhere near the end of this bear market and true crypto capitulation.  Folks that disagree are just holding bags and preying they'll get their money back.
Wow, shit posting getting upvoted and I'm getting downvoted. I guess if this sub doesn't like my contributions I can go somewhere else.
[removed]
Yeah this is a hodling sub, trading is dumb
avoid starting comment with word short...  became allergic to it ..In my train of thoughts was thinking how shorting is going mainstream is the equivalent of FOMO last December.... 
It works when there’s momentum but times like now time would be better spent watching paint dry haha
Nice combo of horizontal support and H&S, however isn't the wick for the last red candle a lot lower than the others, signalig a lot of buying close to that +
We have had plenty and plenty of red days during green market days and started tanking before the djia did

That said I don't think it helps at all, especially because our bear started first
there is 100% a relationship, the extent of the relationship is the question
If I remember, in Late Jan / Early Feb on a Monday the stock market opened one of its worse days, followed by Bitcoin tanking 2k+ that same day 
BTC dropped about the same time S&P futures dropped. Coincidence or correlation?
Well if there is at least I got half of it right by selling out cryptos. My stocks...
Yeah, the reliable soybean/BTC ratio always holds! 
> My short is closing in this area and if we hold I'll open a good sized long. If it doesn't hold I'll be reshorting.

Great.. so you have no Idea!!!



I hope it will break the 7k. Watching it with bitfinex right now, just add another good news I think it might break it
The devs specifically told people NOT to use mainnet LN with significant amount of funds

Also, there’s a big difference between a set of payment channels and the Lightning Network

Payment channels are only point to point.

You are correct, and despite what you're being told here, you do have it right.
As long as we make a higher low I'm fine. 
That's pathetic, yeah
wow man thats ballsy
Admire your bravery but I genuinely believe you are asking for a caressing. + You can lose, you can lose the fiat that you're reserving to replace your potential losses. 
Yeah haha, I wanted to add to my position a little the other day, but held out and didn't FOMO in even a little on the rise for the first time.
It’ll be one hell of a decade
Well, I can.
Why? More to life than crypto. 
Copy pasted from comment I made earlier to a similar comment:

In the 2014-2016 bear market, price would go sideways for months. Everybody including myself wants that plummet and hard bounce but market might not be that forgiving. May not last 2 years but this could last months as it keeps bleeding with small pumps here and there.

Dec 2013-Jan 2017 Stamp chart: https://bitcoincharts.com/charts/bitstampUSD#rg60zczsg2013-12-04zeg2017-01-05ztgSzm1g10zm2g25zv

Why do you say $5800 specifically? Is this because of the November 13, 2017 low?

Why not go further to the November 12th low of $5400?

Or even further, and go the local low of $2980 for September 15th?
Could bounce. I don't see how we get a bull run again without a return of real animal spirits.
Not how it works.  Markets test people.  Patience and playing safe and smart is the play here I think.  
Markets tend to do the opposite of what you seek, when you seek it.
You had that saved in notepad ready to post didn't you ;)
This reminds me of 2014.
I agree with you and and I am sick of it as well.

It can go down to $10 for all i care now. I sure do hope it will fall to $100 or $10 and everyone can call it quits. Samson vs Roger even tho I support Core.

Samson failed miserably and came off as cocky too. Roasted by Roger who is an idiot too.

To a regular Joe it would seem Roger roasted him so badly. 
I'm worried the bull rally has run out of steam
He is indicating a falling wedge, which typically has declining volume throughout and is a reversal pattern. To be clear, the pattern being a reversal pattern doesn't mean a full bear market reversal.
My money is on straight through. It's been sitting post 7k for a while, not moved higher and due to bitcoins normal fluctuations it needs to move down to test 7k. (imho)

Edit - and there it is.
My money's on a bounce
stay away from sept futures unless you’re building a long-term long (1x)
7k wall @ $7300 lol
More trading opportunities are always ahead of you. Don't chase missing the last one by over leveraging the next one.
~7.2 should be resistance, it may go as high and bounce from there.
I just closed my short, stops at 6900 and anticipating and upwards movement for now

Edit: God fucking damnit
Really recommend the book "Trading in the Zone". All about psychology, no TA or FA.
Good reddit written before the decline worth a read.. https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iuv6p/why_the_wall_street_will_short_bitcoin_to_crash/
Check out u/jay1687 's posts. While he focuses on Litecoin, he breaks down and explains every tool he uses and how it's beneficial to TA. He has been posting them in installments over several weeks I believe, starting basic and adding in more indicators as he goes. You should check it out, very informative.
Just follow chewy until you gain confidence to do your own thing. Worked well for me. 
it's up for me 
reminds me of days past.  
Fine for me.
works fine for me. I'm in the US
I've had trouble off and on with it this evening.
GDAX acting up on refresh for me...  In USA
>So, my guess is either we gonna pass through 6500s, or we'll go sideways for a while between 6.5-7k.

So it'll go up, down, or sideways. 
Bulls spent all their power on the way up to 11k8. Every bounce since then is laughable.
I agree that the problem is with bulls, I suspect many of them panic sell and take profits whenever they see the price stall or a big red candle. If bulls don’t hold and exit at the first sign of selling pressure, BTC can’t climb out of this range anytime soon. 
More like Bot Simpson
Bears have been printing half-Barts all morning
Dear green God, please protect pureboi and prevent the rekting.

Amen.
There should be a bounce to 6850 coming somewhere. Not sure I'd hope for more than that. 7K may be the new 7500 (pipedream short entry). 
Could be good for a quick scalp
this is gambling
You're doing good scalping longs but you could suffer through a lot less anxiety if you just keep the good shorts running for a bit
Why? Also didn't you want to hold out your short? Did you really close it again? lol
Serious charm.
Eau du Rekt
I downvoted, then I looked at a chart. This observation is both good and understated.
Could it be a resistance turning to support? That's my best guess.

What's your strategy if it falls much below the channel? Hold or stop loss?
It's a falling wedge and the bottom is weeks away. You can catch a knife but you better unload it just as fast for a scalp because it likely won't be the bottom. 
Something tells me that if the small number of bulls that follow this subreddit wise up it will have no effect on any trend.  
Um I'm sure everyone would love to be a bull :p
love that this comment got downvoted, validating your point.
Didn't I see this post verbatim earlier today?

So much so that I had to check to make sure I wasn't viewing a cached page.
This is called an exit pump. It's normal in an unregulated market doesn't mean anything. Same happened to bitconnect too.

Got a 100 drop instead.  Bounced 50% so far though, not all hope is lost for you.  Could still turn around.

Shorting is less dangerous than going long. 
Percent gain on a drop to 0 is infinite. Kind of serious.
Ouch...

Yes, this bounce was off the major support in low 6ks (previous bottom 2 months ago). The bounce was weakish and low volume. I'm not buying here.
While the rally volume has been rather lackluster, I also see a conspicuous lack of selling volume, which should be the first sign of warning for the bears here.
Volume was very similar to the bounce off $7,300 so I expect similar results. 

The only real bounce we had with legs was the initial bounce off $5,900. Volume was much higher then. 
why you say it is going down?

/r/SoybeanMarkets
If BTC inverse on stock market dip, we saw where it lead us last time in feb.

« Fool me once, shame on — shame on you. Fool me — you can't get fooled again. »

Because whales may liquidate anything over 5x before going down. That is what the last DCB was, whales pushed it to right over the 10x liq point from 6.5 shorts. Now they get to short from 7.5k without as much resistance as well (demoralized bulls).
If you short 10->5 you get 5k profit. If you short 10-8, then 9-7 etc you get 10k profit.

But TBH nobody knows and profit is profit. The lower we go the risk of entering/keeping short is higher.
You can be confident the price is going down medium term and less confident in the immediate/short term, and the compounding profits you're describing can be lucrative. Also you can be confident the price is going low but you never want to be highly leveraged without an exit plan because anything can happen.
> why not just open a highly leveraged short

because whales are doing a great job of finding liquidation points.
Some people do. Look at bitmexrekt on Twitter 
lol ok, why would it be healthy to constantly go up then? lol. Dude really?
Bulls significantly outnumber bears on this sub. Meanwhile BTC has lost 67% of its value. Tells you enough about the value of this sub's sentiment. Thankfully there are a handful of good people here with something valuable to say.
Because they Talk for there own.... there own Porto.

Short... they talk down

Long ... you know

But don't worry... this Chat room has no influence on price... Big guys are in control. Not the 1, 10 or 100 coins persons here.
 


Because they watch charts instead of understand how people think, do you know anyone that wants to get in bitcoin right now?  Any relatives beating down your door wanting to invest?  That absence of interest isn't healthy at all and it gets worse every time bitcoin flounders like this.  I don't think many here realize it is entirely possible ETH or something else takes over once people get sick of this shit.  Bitcoin is not all of crypto.
Because that's how a market functions. A trend consists of 2 things. Higher (lower) highs and higher (lower) lows. The utter delusion is with those who thought yesterday the trend has reversed and are now opening shorts because we have retraced a bit. I'm more inclined to think this a short term drop to establish a higher low on the 4H chart than to think this is the drop that will test 5900. I can't really believe we won't test 7800-8000 before failing again. 
70% drop? This is good for Bitcoin™️
Its almost like they have an agenda.

Not this close to 6.8 but I added more weight on the scales at 7150

I don't think it's terrible r/r to open a short here though, given that if 6.8 breaks, there could be a whole lot of air. I don't think many are expecting 6.5 bullwhale heroics again
Not opening a short here but also not closing here
Market sell vs limit buys

This argument is starting to get very old by now.

If I market sell 1000 BTC, what happens to the price?

Right, it depends on the limit buys in the order books.

It could drop the last price by 0, it could drop it by 100usd

Moreover, there isn’t one price, there’s two: the bid and the ask

The difference between both is called a spread 

Read a book
>I think it's funny how people personify the market.  Don't you guys understand that for "bears" to sell, someone has to buy?

 If nobody wants to pay the current spot price and sellers are willing to accept less, the price drops. The issue is that nobody is willing to buy at current prices, not that nobody is willing to buy. 
You had an election? lol. 
You misspelled "election", I think you meant "reimplementing our Dictator"

Edit: of course I'm from the US so Trump isn't much better!
It is a bear market. How is this not a bear market? Bear market does not mean an elevator to the ground. It means it takes buying pressure to maintain prices. It means any rises or falls operate within an established downtrend channel.

I'll give you a hint--it's in blue: https://www.tradingview.com/x/XeOSI1Rh/  
I mean it's still a bear market
A lot of guys here are up in profit.

Yeah, it's hard but not impossible.
Both the pumps and the dumps are triggered by whales with enormous orders. We are just being played.

If this is the accumulation range (a big if), this is how the manipulators will play the market until they've accumulated enough.
"Was *starting* to get a bit scared at -90%"?! 
I was in your boat fella.

Stayed calm and patient. We're ok now. :-)

Patience is key in a bear market.
Glad it worked out for you. Ballsy call. Been looking to add a little to my position and these are a couple of the TAs I've been looking at this week. First time I haven't given into the urge to FOMO some in as it rose haha.

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/ONPULxN4-Don-t-Let-A-Small-Bounce-Blind-You-BITCOIN-BTC/

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/bJohD9QA-The-Bitcoin-Death-Cross-Is-This-the-Resurrection/
how on earth did you even hold onto a trade at -90%, just seems like gambling at that point
> I'm sure angry TA noobs will downvote me though because they magically know every single future move of BTC.

Sure blaming TA is the way to go, now let me just roll a dice and hold onto a position and HOPE it turns into profit   /s
>Only an idiot would buy now. 

"Only an idiot would sell below 7k"


Both of these statements have seemed reasonable at some point in the last week.

Why do you think that those numbers would be a magic catalyst for people to buy. Sure it may bounce off of there but if everyone sells after they make a quick 10-15% profit, it will just keep going down. Its not like a whole bunch of people are waiting for those prices so that they can be holders. They are just waiting so that they can sell their coins to someone for a little bit more than they paid for them. Unless we get a new pool of people who are buying because they want to own bitcoin and believe in it for what it was created for, then pricewise theres no way it will ever go crazy up again. By all means trade it if thats what you want, but if you're hoping to see huge price gains, then regardless of what you think about hodlers, that supply drying up is necesary. 
Honestly, I keep asking myself who is buying right now other than people trying to short. This market is overly saturated with traders and really lacks any kind of actual investors
[removed]
Feeling similar. Not so much about a bear flag, but after a large drop comes a massive overbought recovery and people usually take profits after.
neckline?
No volume confirmation, hence incorrect analysis
I think one more visit to $6xxx or below feels about right. Barely holding above 7K as it is
I don't know but I'm riding my short out until further notice. The bulls lose morale with every failed rise. 6.8-7 really needs to hold imo
Start reading about risk management. Every trading style is basically secondary to risk mgmt. 

Other than that, don't follow anyone on TV who's obnoxious or claims to know what's going to happen. Most TA *is* bullshit tbh, there's a few actually good technical analysts out there but 99% of it is completely useless.

A large reason why most TA ends up being bullshit is that without stringent rules to base TA off of, TA becomes a way to justify your position rather than form one. 

People go long and then justify their position with bullish TA rather than *find* bullish TA and go long because of it

MarcPMarkets and TomProTrader I think are two good ones on TV, although they tend to lean bullish and in this market I don't know how much that's going to pay off in the end 
You need a good TA book to get you oriented straight. Reading comments here and on TV should just be a starting place for topics to dive into. But honestly what I found most helpful and least time consuming was a good TA book. 

Adam Grimes the Art and Science of Technical Analysis is a good one. There are several other well know authors you can Google and look for names that come up multiple times. 
Check out The Chart Guys on YouTube. Great daily source of information and they offer training courses as well.
That was very poetic!
A big nothing 
bit of a stretch, since ICOs are mostly Ethereum based
They will regulate the hell out of it like in the US. Keeps poor ma and pa from participating while allowing rich folks to sell to them at a later date.
Not until they rein in those out of control taxes on crypto. (Way to take away from the younger generation trying to strike it rich.)

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-08/crypto-investors-in-japan-face-tax-of-up-to-55-on-their-takings

Fun fact: gov rules about this were released just this past December, adding to the cycle of FUD and forcing people to sell a bit more to cover their tax
Crap
That links to removed comment.
In my humble opinion any bounce to 7.1 should be shorted with extreme prejudice 
[deleted]
There's a difference between driving the price and driving the market. During low volume periods, we drift upward. That's the market. Some dumb guy with thousands of BTC to dump in a market sell is just driving the price, not the market.
> unce was the 6k double bottom attempt which actually exposes the real weakness of bulls. Anyone expecting another double bottom attempt in the low 6's is going to be in ...

LOL you simply cannot infer that depth of information from your source data.
Looking at pattern:

11.8 -> 8.4 -> 10 -> 7.4 -> 9.2 -> 6.4

I was expecting at least 8k bounce here. Didn't expect that it'll stop at 7.5, but it may still bounce from 7k just to test 8k and go down.
chewy said 6800 is still within the realm of a healthy-ish pullback.

If it goes below 6800, I anticipate we see sub 6k this week...

u/_chewtoy_?
supply and demand people! y'all keep talking about patterns and lines but frankly 7k is neither atrractive bulls or bears. 2017 definitely brought btc to public attention and lots of people have fomo, but most 2017 joiners either are red and sheepish or procrastinators and arent buying too much right now. its now time to focus on real world use because that is the only thing that will stop the price from hitting triple digits
You don’t need to add a Tldr if all you want us to know is that you’re short 
Thank you for your "lesson" oh great mastermind.

However 6.8 could as well be a valid support.

Yes, the buying is weak as hell. However the mother of shorts squeeze could very well fuel it again.
shorts shorts shorts , you are trying to convince yourself?
Any reason why?
Noise has suddenly returned 
Still only 16k daily volume on gdax. That's virtually no volume for this much price movement.

Projection
Yeah, I'm super antsy.  How are us bears supposed to pay taxes on all these gains??
I suggest you read up on how a Bart formation looks like^oh^wait...
Giggity 
Yup... Nice timing.
> Currently have a short position open from 7133 

I did too, already took 1/3 of it at 6.9 and another 1/3 profits at 6.8.

I've had too many trades lately that I held during profit and into a loss, back to profit, and finally ending in loss.    Gotta lock in profits.  Hope I can break even for the week, currently in red.

I'll probably increase this short by 50% after we settle somewhere, and try to catch some upward volatility.

But already wish I did BE stops and held this heh.
i'm also short from 7100, very new to this kind of thing.  When will you think to close?
Well done. Disappointing to see it drop when TA was indicating that it would rise some more, but it just feels like a weak market right now. 


Maybe this weekend.
Seems unlikely but you could post the data & logic leading you to such a thought.  
I think we don't.
Not if they're bearish on this sub!
Sometimes the truth hurts.
50/50 wow
Neckline is around 7300 in that formation
Probably 100x worse. Like you reload the page every couple of seconds and there are 50 new posts talking about the end of btc
Which chart?

If you're watching an exchange on tradingview without paying then I believe half the ticks are dropped.

If you're asking *"What is the latency on exchange X between market matching and API socket updates?"* then that's a fairly deep question. The answer probably is *"Fast enough that you don't care"*.
Back when I was buying around 10k worth of ETH at $8, I could actually see the candle on Gdax pretty much instantly.
My personal signal for reversal is that TRON/VERGE stop rallying mega hard the minute BTC shows any strength.
You really think the market cares what people's opinions are?
Who the hell is bullish still? Only people who are delusional. I don’t think that counts. 
Will probably get sold OTC but yeah it basically means enjoy another 160k BTC getting dumped indirectly on the bear market. 
We should be good till September.
Why buy during agonizing lows when you can fomo?
I think there will be some buying power in the 5k-5.5k range. In the meantime: fasten your seat belts. 
Because it was traders/bots acting on news, not a shift in sentiment. We need to see consistent and small price increases for awhile before we can say sentiment has changed and we're out of the bear market.

We flip a coin.

6.7 is support, thought it'll bounce between 6.8-7. there's not much buying pressure now but we're close to over sold. Hard to say really.
Buy 100btc and it will go up.

Sell 100btc and it will go down
Tweet McAfee if you want to hear hopium of it going up or consult a bear on tradingview if you'd like to hear about it going down
It's gone down. as of now $6597 in bitfinex chart.
Do you ever contribute anything of substance? 
Kraken's been having weird spikes all week. One of my stop buys triggered on an ETHUSD trade because of a $100 wick :\
Now I feel like the Bart formation is getting abused worse than ever. A Bart has to have clear sharp rise, flagging/stagnation/oscillation, then a sharp breakdown. We also want to see confirmation of high volume on both the upticks and downward cliff drop for maximum confusion
On GDAX, 100 BTC moved the price up $50 in 5 min. So crazy how thin the order book is
30k soon boys 
You kidding, right?
[deleted]
What's btc oprah...?
are we all supposed to know what BTC Oprah is? Are we missing something awesome? cuz it sounds pretty awesome
What time frame? Not seeing it except for on the hourly but that may have already played out with the last hourly candle.
If it goes to 4k it will probably be a slow grind and at the point you won’t be able to tell if it can goto 2k so be careful what you wish for. 
> me frame to see what's going on

I think in the next 20 minutes we're likely to see which way we are heading
It depends on shorter time period wick is a candle.
Out of interest: is that in limbo at Coinbase? or you have that 30% safe.
That's why you split your order in multiple smaller ones.

Or do 20X and place 4 of such orders.
Do you have a link to the "bitcoin bearz" group on FB? I missed the link if you ever posted it.
Im agree, longing this dip and will try and get out around 6.9-7k for a quick scalp. Watching it closely though and will cut it if things start crashing.
Im longing Sept futs in anticipation of a bounce, but so far no dice
Why? That's 4 years of fuck all. Looks so boring
Early adopter of what? Bitcoin isn't being used.
FWIW I agree 100%. Less people around these days who realize the importance of time to this technology.

People here seem to either not understand the true value of Bitcoin, be incredibly impatient (i.e. its not a world currency now, it's rubbish) or are just shilling their positions. 

2.3 transactions a second and people say it's not being used? That's what early adoption is.

However, ultimately other peoples opinion makes no difference. Once institutions start getting properly involved it will be a whole different landscape.
Heyyy got news for you. Adoption is decreasing. There's no integration. It's not used at all.
Transactions down, merchants dropping Bitcoin, LN has 10BTC total capacity, active addresses decreasing, Google trends in the gutter. 

19k buyers are not early adopters lmao. Just stop bud, you sound completely delusional. 
You laugh, but this is precisely what's potentially going to happen if this pumps back above $7,000.
We are hugging the 60 week EMA. We already fell through it once last week but we closed above it. If we drop below it this time, I don't see us closing above it. It's significant because the last time BTC closed below it, it was 2014 and it took 3 long weeks of almost no volatility to finally break below it. BTC went from 460 to 260 in the 3 weeks after that, bounced towards the 60 week EMA, got rejected, and dropped to 150 and that was the bottom. 

Not saying it's going to be identical this time because the market is not the same. But it's a rather bearish signal if it were to happen.

Edit: we broke it while I was typing. 
Naked Shorts can potentially lose infinitely, but you do realize that’s why you pay an initial margin and why there’s liquidation...
[removed]
So just sell, and leave. 
It's been a 3 month long bear trap this whole time
Going no where enough TA lol
We can fit you in next Tuesday at 3?
Yeah I’m sure everything will be fine as long as the price plummets more aggressively. Crypto saved by massive loss of value.
If we go to 5900, we'll go to 4900 pretty fast.
I think this bear market will be lasting months.

1. Price falls. 
2. New support found.
3. Fakeout.
4. Repeat until there's no more small money. 

I keep thinking back to someone who said we will never see $30 Neo again.  At the time it was $90 or something and all I could do was roll my eyes.  We absolutely might see $30 Neo again and it could be in a few days.  So many people simply do not understand what this market is capable of.  I think they must just be too new and they don’t sit down and seriously look at charts.  A lot of this shit went from almost worthless to worth millions to billions of dollars in a very short time.  Why can’t it go way back down closer to where it started?  It absolutely can and likely will.  Bitcoin rules the domain so first the market has to decide what it is worth for anything else to thrive.  The world can’t even put a value on bitcoin can it put a value on this other stuff?  Nope.  Sentiment for most people looking at market cap is most of this is still very overvalued.  If I grab an alt position it is with stops and a sell goal.  It’s not because I want to use the coin for jack shit.  I’m not the only one.  So what is a coin worth when the main function is to trade it on exchanges?  Apparently less and less.  I think we have yet to enter into real massive panic yet.  Time will tell.
I'm sure your comment made an impact on the rally.
bullish, the normies are back :o
would be curious to know this too
Eaten up fast

You should never pay attention to orderbook, at least you should never make decisions with consideration of orderbook, walls, whales and etc. Any big order may be a spoof, any single order can be cancelled at any time.
The same reason why people invested in it during the first few bubbles. 
They said the same thing when it went from $1200 to $200.

I'm still sitting here rolling in bags of money.
Yes, a magical entity is responsible for this and said magical entity will magically stop on a certain magical date.
This sounds like ETHtrader talk
I got lucky with a 50x short when the Coinnest CEO news came out because the news was only a few minutes old so the reward far outweighed the risk. Managed to double my stack before i chickened out but i could have made more.

Its the only time I'll use high leverage but its worked so far.
Im with you on that one. The last 20 minutes the price didnt drop further, guess we will skip 7k all together, maybe new ATH?

Just my gut feeling.
Can't tell if sarcastic.
Funny way to write 6
I keep hearing this narrative but no one has provided any arguments except for "because alts are bad mmmkay"
Stacking CCs by asset over the last 3 months, we can see that BTC is slowly recovering but that smallers CCs are still increasing their market share, too.

* https://imgur.com/a/ssX6a
* https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/

These trends will likely continue because small alts have effectively become fractional reserve banking for the CC market. As the market drops in value these reserve currencies are able to buy up their own supply in order to preserve their exchange ratios. 

If I'm right, as long as these fractional reserve currencies (alts), currently 20% of the market cap, continue to grow in relative value I think the overall CC market will remain bearish.

We will also be downvoted for saying this because there are a number of bag holders who are both unwilling to argue this and unwilling to acknowledge that they have a real problem. Cognitive dissonance is a rabid bitch from hell.
Why can't people have different speculative gambling tokens that have minimal utility besides just BTC?
As much as bitcoin holds the brand name for cryptocurrency, there are a plethora of alt coins out there that already have real world use and will be used for far more than just a store of value. Those are the coins that will put crypto on the path to real world adoption and on the road to success. Yes their are an immense amount of shitcoins out there. 
Everyone knows first movers always win.  Anyway, I’m crunched for time and need to run out.  I’ll just jump on my Compaq computer, to web search AltaVista, and print out my MapQuest before I hit the road.  Cowabunga dude.
It used to be 70% Now we've got hardcore "hodlers" of shitcoins.

Also, altcoin mining

Also, smart contracts

Also, crowdfunding through ICO

I think >50% will be overbought BTC, or oversold alts.
Nah, we should wait for BTC dominance at 130% and then we can hope for another bull run.
so you sold all?
It wouldn’t be half as fun if they didn’t get excited by every little pump.
Here is what's happening, and it's what's been happening since $11,700:

1. Short's load up at a local top.
2. Once short-term support is found, bulls long the dip and bears close their shorts in profit.
3. The moment buy support plateaus, longs take profit and shorts re-open. 
4. Repeat steps 1 through 3. 

This process will continue indefinitely until the "actual" bottom is found. At which point, buying pressure won't plateau in step 3. 

The question shouldn't be, "who is selling?"

The question should be, "who is buying, and when will they give up?"

At least so far, that push to $7,500 that we just had is behaving precisely as every single failed recovery has since $11,700. Buyers didn't see it as "the last chance to buy BTC before the big push up."

They saw it as an opportunity to scalp a quick buck before another leg down. 

And sellers saw it as "the last opportunity to short BTC in the $7,000s."
Imagine buying at 100 and not selling 19k then seeing your profits dwindle by 70% with no signs of letting up. 

Imagine buying at 19k and seeing your capital bleed out day by day with no end in sight. 

Asking why they didn't sell before this is like asking why they didn't predict the market perfectly. In 2 weeks you might ask why the sellers didn't sell at 7k
Better to sell now than at 5k in a few weeks? Obviously. 
Because they think this is not the bottom? They was holding at 11-8k, hoping for a reversal but it didn't happen and they lost hope?

Why would you need to ask such question? This is a large market and every person has his own prediction and perspective.
Those who didn't sell then, those who bought lower to trade, those who are shorting...
Because sometimes you just have to fold a losing hand.  No worries though, btc will be 50% off soon enough.
More people than those buying
Don't forget there's a lot of traders on short timeframes too. Was high volume at 6.4k so some of those must have sold at profit.


If you didn't believe it would get this low and now you don't know what to believe.

Okay
Go trade Fixed Income then
Good to see the old timers still posting
lol. Stop projecting noobie. 

> I  bought my first crypto early December and you know that we had a huge gain in December. I was trading different pairs (both in a canadian exchange and binance) and had a good profit by the end of december. However, as I was a newbie in investment, I got greedy and didn't sell when it was high. Now, I am underwater and my loss is around 50%. Should I report my profit by the end of 2017 in my tax return? I never cashed out and just traded different pairs. I have already lost a lot of money and I don't want to pay for a profit that never realized. Can anyone help me with this?


[deleted]
Okay, which support are you talking about..? I've got a pretty good support level at 7,000... and we aren't there.
This is a rumor that was shot down as false yesterday.

March 7?
do you have anything more recent, say, in an April version?
I wouldn't do that. You can make a picture out of anything if you shift the time scales, do some mental gymnastics etc. 
I think that bulls are grasping to find anything that confirms their bias.
It is actually Bit-Corns
Ha! Nice...this really helped me trade 
OH NOES!
You are a moron 
I find it funny how one of your examples of a thing that can feasibly happen is just "BTC replaces USD" as if that actually can just randomly happen anytime soon.
Crazy.  I just looked.  1 hour.  Bear flag.   2 hour.  Bear flag.   4 hour.  Bear flag.  12 hour.  Huge giant bear flag.  Where the bull flag?
On what chart?
That's not a bull flag. Also, 5m chart? come on, man...
Do you even know what a bull flag is? Show us a screenshot of your supposed bull flag.
Perhaps the most fair method would be proof of burn
HOPEFULLY it will take a year or two for the next real rally to start. Because then
* This may take us over 100k and
* I will have accumulated a lot more ;)
Thanks! I'm still long (for better or worse) after a scalp sell/re-buy from $7k to $6.9k. I'm expecting a bounce sometime soon, even if it's a half hearted one.
RemindMe! 20 years "lambo yet?"
The only true bull sentiment
nevermore!
are you trying to say the next couple weeks are critical?

that's the gist of it. nicely put

since saints aren't real, I agree with you
The Dow will be fucked hard today. I don't believe in correlations between that and crypto but sentiment will suffer.
You're not wrong. BTC isn't taking long to prove me wrong. Still bouncing, but I'll probably end up buying back in. I was watching a break up out of the downward channel, but this does indeed appear to be a bear flag. The bear flag definitely has the space for a rise above 6900, but it may reject on resistance and break down before ever climbing past.
If this gets past 7 you should probably exit cause it's gonna test 7.2.
Hi Chris and thanks for saying hello :)

Me too.
I agree completely, totally different ballgame. But it's interesting how it has followed bitcoin's path for the last couple of months to a tee and people do like to see patterns in everything
Might have to give that a watch, would be jaw-dropping if bitcoin took a nosedive followed shortly by a large stock market crash
Except that the next smart contract platform is trivial to bring to Bitcoin
The thing is, Bitcoin and Blockchain was not invented for smart contracts and it was not invented for "fast and cheap." We've had fast and cheap payments for many decades. 

Smart contracts could be cool and all, but Bitcoin can have them too, none of the current smart contracts are actually useful for jack shit except digital kitty tokens, and they aren't what gives blockchain most of it's value.

The primary value in Bitcoin/Blockchain is dcentralized, trustless, and somewhat anonymous transacting and storing of value. No altcoin has found a way to do this any better. 
There is no other coin that offers this kind of stability, security and trust for years to come. Until then bitcoin might have a smart contract platform of its own.
> Bitcoin is just another step towards creating a free and borderless world. It can take a long time before the true meaning of Bitcoin is found, but that's how it goes with most paradigm shifting technological innovations.

Agree. 

(Though i'd state *crypto.)

siiiickkk!!!

Ill be on the left coast soon
We need more data but until proven otherwise the charts show that each ATH will be broken and dwarfed by a new ATH. The unknown function is time. 
I want to exchange a hash preimage with you... How can I do it without a third party?
Not a remote possibility at all...probably over 50% chance it never does.
Best trading strategy other than shorting BTC would have been to put all your Crypto fiat into Amazon
I bought back with an average around 8k USD

And there’s no reason to copp that expensive pasta when Barilla do just fine
explain, please
Probably going to split it into 2. One at around 6k, the other waiting for a convincing enough bounce, or a breakdown from 6k.
Closing positions via market order is prioritized against other orders, so they usually fill.
At least? if you click again thinking it was 'overload' then guess what you end up getting in with amounts you didn't bargain for. this is WORSE than overload cause then you have to try to BALANCE it and that effort is on a delay. This is not professional at all. And these guys came from the banking industry LOL.
Is this just on the web interface or also on the API as well?
I use Finex too maybe I will revisit using that platform more, seeing that the tether scare was more fear mongering by the youknowwhos here.
I do on 'at least' one side of the trade but it doesn't fit my trading algo to make the market all the time.
Its done via their API and sockets and a trading algo.. im not an idiot trust me you FILL 30 SECS late there is no way to 'trade properly' jesus.. people
As another bear put it here, the phases are not exactly law so they may not go exactly as it's shown in the chart, but nevertheless, a 70% loss is big, undeniable capitulation. Even for crypto.
What you're describing is despair. Also, remember that this is all related the bull run before. So yeah, we are actually talking about people who bought at 17-20k buckling and finally selling. It's literally all about them. People that bought sub 2k and still haven't sold are actually the ones that we shouldn't be talking about because a) they bought before the take off phase and b) are proven long(er)-term holders who have refused realization of 10x gains, as well as the fact that they are actually holding for about a year now.

I do hear your observation of r/bitcoinmarkets vs. other environments though. You are probably right about that.
This is kind of an unresolvable semantic nitpick of an argument, because we all know that when people talk about "capitulation" in a market, they're referring to a singular event that you can only generally identify after-the-fact by looking at a chart. Also the reality is that you don't actually need such an event to produce a medium- or longer- term trend reversal in a market.
They are, in fact, very loose definitions, so can't say your definition of denial is wrong either. I'm just talking about the chart about the price, that everyone has seen for a million times.

Volumes that are steadily decreasing every day, and the 70% decrease in price from the top of the bull run may be indicators that may fulfill your definitions for despair and capitulation, respectively.
Are you insane? Where is the fun in that? Sleepless nights, indecision, questioning what you are doing with your life etc. etc.

You really want to miss this? lol
And the funny thing is that a lot of shorts closed and longs opened on that drop.
Well, do you want to buy here? Would you recommend to anybody else that they buy here? 

The market is pretty dumb, but it isn't *that* dumb. 

This is the 3rd significant bounce since $11,700 that's reclaimed a significant support zone and then immediately conceded it back to sellers. 

I can speak from experience (because I've been fooled by all of them) that I have absolutely no desire to long bitcoin right now.
You are right. "laughably low" was an overstatement. 

But it's still generally within the range where you'd expect a bounce to have already materialized. 
From a technical standpoint, you should get another chance to re-short higher than $6,800. Possibly in the next few minutes, to be honest.
Well, it's both. 

I can't stress enough how profitable longing the bottom has the potential to be. Moreso the lower this goes. 

So buyers are jumping on every bounce because there's always the possibility that this could be "the one." And btc could double in a matter of weeks. 

But once it's clear that this isn't "the one" they abandon ship in droves.

Rinse/repeat all the way from $11,700 to $6,400.
Dude, you passed up the opportunity to use "intrinsic" in a proper economic context!
Cuttin wicks on a 4H man...no can do. Still, including the wicks only drops it to 6600 and resistance/support lines are really more of zones in the first place. 
They're Heikin-Ashi candles.

I'm very positive, that BTC will have a positive value in USD by the end of 2018.
Another drop to ~ $6.6k before the day is finished. A brief dip/wick below 6k by the end of the weekend before a short-lived FOMO bounce.

*we were hovering around 6.9 at the time I typed this comment.
No targets yet. We'll see how the market contends with those areas if it gets there.
Just building up my trading stack right now. I would rather have margin to back up underwater positions that I'm confident in eventually going green. 

Yes, bitmex. 
This is more of a scalp play. I wouldn't recommend closing a hedge from 7k anywhere near here. 
Yeah now to be patient when reentering. Got sells laddered up to 7.1. Hoping I catch a few eager bagholders on a technical bounce. 
I tried the whole patience thing for a few days and let me tell ya, it is way overrated.
And i was told the rise was organic. So organic that people thanked the Kraken whale for saving us. 
Take profits,  buy lambo and beach house?
Around 160,000 a few weeks ago.
Well eventually market exhaustion is a thing I think.  Imagine if the stock market was global 24/7 like crypto.  I’m sure orders and bots are out there, some people are trading but I think it is hard to deny this market does not command the attention it did a few months ago.  Anyone wanting to market dump a bunch of bitcoin had plenty of chances.  I kind of equate it to a firework show dwindling down.  Less rockets going up and less noise.  The market is die hards against each other and hodlers who have probably already resigned their fate.  Maybe the first snowflakes of crypto winter until the next big thing.  It was ethereum in 2017.  It spawned lots of interesting ideas and lots of get rich quick schemes that are losing steam.  Believers are not coming in but instead hanging on.  That’s what the market looks like to me now.  Perfect time to go exploring for what is next because I have no doubt it is out there and there will be a spectacular entry so go exploring instead of fretting over the price.
How long till the daily closes?

low volume? follow the trend
Perhaps. Although more likely I'll wait until $6,000 falls.
Lets get it over with. Fuck it go down to 1k
While it's true that the 3m through the 1h are oversold, the 4h-1d are still well above 30.

While I don't think the market will push down through $6,800 right here and now, anything beyond a tepid bounce back to $7,100 is more or less out of the question in my humble opinion.
Are we? 4 hour RSI is in the 40's plenty of room here to go down.
Honestly, I'm off the opinion that buyers are fucked. 

But we'll see. 
Those silly days when you could sign a transaction with a reasonable fee and expect it to "just work"...
It does do that 
Lol, I mean't short-term as in the next 1-4 hrs, I said the daily looks bearish.  I longed just above 6.7 support with tight stops.  But if you want to talk about the past, yes down 8%. 
It's a pretty weak 8 percent when you look at the amount of money that was wasted to create that drop and how quickly it's recovering. I do think the short-term is looking better than it has in a while, still riding long from 7.3 and will add if these guys are able to get it down. The longer they keep up this manipulation, the worse it will be for them because the supply is getting smaller every day. I don't know when the next big run up will be, but it will be the biggest one yet.

!RemindMe 100days
Yeah, B-E stop triggered. Damn. Well played on yours. I should have set my stop up at 6980.
I am not the most savvy trader, but I have been having a LOT of success using this kind of strategy. Basically, I waited for the 4h EMA9/SMA20 cross, then when the ticker went below the EMA9 on 30m, i waited for it to break with no volume, and shorted. My SL was really close, so risk was low, and without volume, chances are that a EMA9 cross would be fake. Has been paying out for the past weeks for me.

Maybe I'm just lucky.
Breakout trades or bottom pickers is a bit of my trading style, or shorting obvious super tops. If it turns the other way, then I just take my loss and wait for better times
Say someone got rekt on the way down and cashed out at a loss. The gambler mentality (which let’s be obvious, is pretty rampant in crypto) is to try and make it back. And it wouldn’t even be that hard, just find better entry/exit point, e.g., buy when it’s oversold then sell when it’s overbought. 

Just look at this most recent run, buy at 6400 then sell at 7500. You’re already making back some of the losses. Rinse and repeat. You don’t need new money, just need the existing capital not to quit the game and exit. 
Do your own research and learn enough to know what makes sense and doesn't.

There's still a lot of normal traders here. Just hard to find them sometimes.
meh, it's money I could lose. unfortunately ive been saying that too much lately and I've run out of $20 ether to fund my gambling addiction
NOTHING is safe in this market
Agreed.  Just revised my low prediction to 2.5k.  I think people are just emotional because they made money longing, and have an affinity to cheerlead for btc price success.  
Like 5800 blowoff bottom right
It doesn’t mean that it’s perfectly aligned but just roughly correlated.
what evidence of this do you have?
Takes 6 month at least
Longs are closing too
Oh that makes sense
And we all gonna rage quit by then :-P
Any better ways?
The 15m candle went from 7075 to 6877. A lot of people probably expected a bounce to test 7K (and shorters salivating to open there), but we almost immediately dumped again and *then* bounced. Those shorters are probably grabbing 6900 as you mentioned. 

I'm concerned (as a 7K shorter) that 7K hasn't been tested as local resistance after holding as support, and a retest does feel somewhat likely if we don't leg down hard again. 
Mine aren't starting until 6600. We'll see who comes out ahead on that, but I've got 10 entries layered down to 6100 that would provide me a CA @ 6250 with 20% of the (current) stack if all executed. But with my short position, stack would be significantly larger at 6100.
I was about to type that the odds were pretty good for that....but...yeesh. BTC <3s maximum pain.
He's just a moonboy from a poor family, sparing his BTC from this monstrosity
He's just a moonboy, FOMO in for meeee...for meeeeeee....
Can we call it the power bottom?
When the bills give up trying to guess the bottom, it will come soon after.  In my experience, anyway
What are you the Sphinx? Spit it out man haha
I compared this breakout to the one on Feb 6th because a lot of folks here tried to explain the reason of the 'double bottom' only to 6.4k instead of 6k, because of racing to buy up the bottom. But the volume doesn't confirm it.
> Personally not a fan of derivatives popping up, but It seems that’s the future of the market.


I can smell the irony

> Re: Tether: I guess it’s either very close to 1USD or worth zero? Or is there another possibility?

if they get liquidated and they find out they have 1bn instead of 2 then it is worth 0.5/tether
Nor would they have to.
I think you need to hold a counter contract with someone else. So it’s zero sum. One of you wins and one loses.

However, that’s a good point. Considering futures crashed on some volatility, could they cope if Tether went to zero.


> CoinEx will be unaffected

Read the terms, Coinex does not take any risks, so yes, they would be unaffected if Tether collapses.
great question, if tether is a scam, i think our whole space would be affected, exit scam left and right
I doubt companies would relate with Tether knowing there is something shady behind it. You can find Tether anywhere from Bitfinex to Binance and still be believing that mentally ill guy?
This chart makes sense in context of your first one but maybe it didn't make enough sense what you were going for as clearly as the one today. Adding just a few lines of text in your post could be helpful

Look at the bounce from 6400 to 7k. I would consider that a left shoulder, the 7k to 7500 back to 7k the head and a possible right sholder forming
lol dude. Get a life. 
I don't know man, these dumps are looking more feeble and desperate every time. Some whale trying to destroy something that is indestructible. Kind of pathetic when you zoom out. The moon's a long way off, and most of us know that.
don't forget about us degenerate gamblers
I doubt price would drop to $1k. Maybe $2k min. Which would be a great time to accumulate, especially for anyone who sold near the top.
why $500? I see the lowest possible point at $1200 (previous bubble peak). If it goes below that, BTC can probably be declared dead
Why so? Please explain. $1000 would seem very painful to me. Why os that ok and not $500? 
Samson was so useless for representing Bitcoin recently. I am utterly disappointed. 
Yeah but people are saying 500 and 2000 in the same sentence.
Then go somewhere else dude.

My complete unverifiable probably not worth mentioning tin foil is that last night, someone was HEAVILY selling on kraken when we were hovering at 7.3. Like several candles in a row that got down to 7250, then would suddenly snap back up from arb. Happened 5-6 times while the other exchanges held 7315+ consistently. I wonder if this was our whale just recycling.
Not really. This bear market seems to be playing out pretty fast so likely not a whole year. But I don't like putting time frame on it because I'm going to more judge the bottom based on TA and indicators / some fundamental news rather than time. Hell if we smash through 7.8k, consolidate a while, and smash the log ATH resistance, maybe the bottom is already in.

If I had to say how long I'm bearish for it's probably gonna be a month or two barring unlikely scenarios. I try not to get carried away guessing any longer out.
Market was overpriced so he's creating a better entry point for himself.
We had a sweet economy under Bill Clinton, and the economy recovered really well under Obama. People might start blaming the Republicans, but a lot of people don't really pay attention to anything. 

So let's blame immigrants.
It was interesting to me that so many waves lined up where we are. I'm not saying it's right... and even the current wave could drop 800 from here and look almost exactly the same. I think this is the first time I've post and EW chart to this sub, too.


There are 5 point waves within the huge ABC correction waves that I didn't bother to draw.
5 waves appears correct when you look at the weekly chart, for sure. It still lands us in the same position, which is the end of a long corrective pattern.

Also, volume appears to be picking up with you look at combined charts.

When you're looking at the 4 hour chart, drawing two full corrective waves appears to make more sense. They all fit over each other, which is part of what you should find in EWs.
up/sideways
I'm drawing 12k there pointing to it as resistance. It's not a projection. It's just pointing out possible areas of resistance.

Of course we can get to 12k again. Bitcoin is volatile. This is what it does.
Here's a more clear example of what you're looking for:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/udxRXPwZ/

Didn't have the position of the most recent bear trend right.
>Wave C: Prices move impulsively lower in five waves. Volume picks up, and by the third leg of wave C, almost everyone realizes that a bear market is firmly entrenched. Wave C is typically at least as large as wave A and often extends to 1.618 times wave A or beyond
https://www.moonmath.win

We're still in the bull. We just can't see it on a scale that's smaller than 6 years.
https://www.tradingview.com/chart/ddu96lYQ/
Draw it up and post it. Sounds like valid bear TA.
like this? https://www.tradingview.com/x/WJ2omaMY/ (+ landing on the 1w cloud)

Disclaimer: total elliot waves noob

The positions of the current wave would change. It would look almost exactly the same if we dropped another 800 from here.
people will begin to really buy at new aths
Same with me, which is more aggressive than it probably ought to be. As for leverage, I never go higher than 5x because I stay on kraken and off the bitmex crack.
Too much risk.  I recommend trading stack to be 5% of holding stack.
Thinking it's also likely bot movement reacting to very oversold 1hr
Hope they stop @6900, don't feel like babysitting my SL and don't won´t to cancel it just in case another rogue bull run 
A kanye reference from you? unexpected XD 
Okcoin has low volume?
nope.
I agree with you in regard to the people that got burned. The price would need to move a lot to get those people back into buying. I don't know what that catalyst will be. We need a hype train to start a hype train rolling. It seems like the last hype train got a lot of people on board and a lot of those people got burned.

I'm guessing it will take 2 years for us to see the next hype train get rolling. That will probably be around the time of the next halving of the reward which will take away a decent amount selling pressure.

But who knows... If we get a couple of days of $500+ gains in a row, that might get people swarming back in.

Not sure I follow exactly, other than you have to keep your real life spending in check. Losses are deducted from your taxable income.
Hope springs eternal. I imagine there are some people that are hoping to sell at what they paid and they might be holding out as long as possible. People hate taking a lost and they get hung up on the price that they bought it for instead of what the current value is.
This isn't really that hard to believe
Why are bulls so salty whenever someone sells. 
Based on the price sky rocketing, then correcting back down to when it was atleast a bit more of a sustainable trend.

When I say sideways, I do mean Bitcoin sideways. I shouldn’t have to caveat that though 
Couple weeks ago it was also at sub 7k. So we went sideways since?
$20k?
Bulls down voting bearish comments making me even more bearish
Did you shitpost at first? Why is this comment being downvoted?

I'm also laughing at you being right and my comment saying you have another day being right lmao 
Thats why you closed your long, right? To make 8.8k happen?
He wasn't necessarily right, although I agree with his choice.  And the obvious probably "made" him short.
Is this your catchphrase? 
He was right, wasn’t he?
Yep, dirty tactics at play. I'm done trying to call this shit storm, I'm sitting this out for the long run... 

Going into cold storage like Han Solo
Idk man, bragging about 3% moves seems to be all the rage :)
I just want to daytrade alt-coins, but that's impossible when btc keeps crashing. So i'm hoping that it stabilizes soon, at what price that's going to be doesn't really matter to me.
And sold two?
12 years is practical for an investment.
Where he was stupid is going all in at any price.  Simple slow dca would have destroyed his entry.  Also stupid is buying the top.  He could buy more here and really reduce his cost basis if he really believes in bitcoin.  Not many believers at this price so maybe wait.
X2
ever heard of the story about the tortoise & rabbit race?
Not feeling joy at so many people losing so much but I had to post this as revenge for the bulltards that can't get my name out of their mouths. 
Waiting for my limit buy to just about get filled at 5.5 before I post. 
I'm only for taunting when someone is asking for it by being obnoxious, not when a trade just goes against them (.5% at that)
No. It's killing me /s
Thats exactly what I was thinking. People have been calling sub 6k since we hit 6k. Every single time we cant break a resistance, and I mean this literally, someone comes out and calls 5k. People did it when we hit 7k, 8k, 9k, 11k, called it when we were going down, called it when we were going back up and are calling it again right now. 

Since people are so sure we are going to go lower, there is actually no way we do. Too many people sitting on the sidelines waiting for a re-entry at 5,8-5,9k, we didnt even come close to 6k the last time we approached it.
We're looking at the same chart?

Lots of shorts took profits on the way down, there's lot of room and selling pressure is big.

Yeah, we will bounce from 6.8 but I don't expect it to hold...
I'm not sure how you can think that. We're now closer to our local low than our local high. This changes the paradigm from a strong potential reversal to a strong potential DCB. 
Do you think it will?

I like you, personally. I think you're a good person and I like your contributions to this sub... but this isn't the kind of thing we do in this sub.
Also, this ignores the substance of my argument.
 I set myself up for an argument with that statement. I'll retract it to avoid getting into an argument that's off topic in this sub.
I don't see why people separate bitcoin so easily from alts when the amount of speculation and greed surrounding both are very similar. The way bitcoin maximalists see alts is the way normal people see bitcoin 
Agree that btc is not offering 7k of value, but btc price will continue to be propped up until alt capitulation is complete.
BTC is speculative asset, it doesn't provide any value besides the technology behind it.
I don't understand, either. It's extremely frustrating. It seems like our sub is losing its identity. If this is who we are, I'm not sure I want to be here.
Exactly.
Your chart is broken and dumb, it crosses ~50k in 2020 as opposed to the much more obvious and clearly defined plan of '1m by 2020' 
It is indeed, I consider that support already broken. Have in mind that I did draw that line several days ago, it isn't "adjusted" to these past few hours, it's just an infinite line.

I would open a short here, but my SL would be way too far away in that case, and I am not brave enough to take that risk. Waiting for a pop, or staying out of any positions on this one.

Like I said, 6840 would be a good entry for me, with SL at 7020 I guess.
*Cue X-files theme*
coerrelation
Coincidence.
The other term you are looking for is causation. 
Please stop embarrassing yourself.
? I'm closing my short. I'll wait for a few hours and if it looks good I'll long. If we fall through I'll open another short. A good trader will have a plan no matter what happens. Of course I don't know exactly which way it will go.
You don't understand. LN should have appeared fully-formed from the brow of Mainnet as soon as it was ever mentioned. And if not, then development should have taken six weeks and been perfect first time AND millions and millions of people should have immediately already have been using it for months when it came out before it was even coded.

Because none of this is true, LN has will have already have going to be have failed.
Raiden on Ethereum is a network of payment channels.
Just a gut feeling that somewhere in that range it bottoms. I think there is a lot of money sitting on the sidelines waiting for that range

that was also the bottom (5900) during early feb... BTC capitulated last at that point
Because the volume seemed low?
Bitcoin doesnt have normal fluctuations.
Chart says down
watching this level closely as it has bounced twice now, and i got stuck holding bags since my stop buy limit triggered at 7520 earlier today. Needless to say never using stop buy limits again, completely wiped my minor profit i got from trading 10% of my stack on a short earlier this week

Also, if we do bounce i think it is not a bad move to open a scalp long and take profit at 7340 or so, seems we are forming a nice little pattern.
Thanks for the tip.  Actually have a long term long on *June that was started before Sept opened.

Indeed should have put the swing long on the swaps though.
was asleep for that, was it up long?
now 5k@7120.
I feel like 7.2 would be confirmation that 7k held well. I do think that we won't go straight to 8k and 7.2 will probably provide some kind of resistance but I think the buying pressure at that point would take over.

Thanks, will check them out.

Nice idea, but I'm looking to educate myself before getting into any more trading. Also, I don't understand everything Chewy writes, which is obviously not going to help me follow his trades.
Lol, yeah, but if you stop following him then don't follow him, cause if you follow only part of his trades you'll end up with that bad part ;-)
Those are just bear flags
I know man, but this time I did sstick to my plan, I really thought since it broke through 7.2k we'd test 7.8k, shits even more bearish than I expected.
Yes dude, I thought we were going to test 7.8k tbh so i closed my short. Was planning on reshorting higher. I was actually sticking to my plan in this case, didn't want to hold a short if we broke through 7.2k resistance because it really did look like we'd test a higher level.
And you're still on yours? What's the target of that? 15k? :-P

It didn't though.

Also, now that I've got a couple bears here, I gotta ask one thing. I've got nothing against the bear but at least be rational about it and admit that the capitulation is well underway. A remarkably high number of bears are actually defending that this is the denial phase, which is why their other opinions are easily downvoted and dismissed tbqh.
I commented about this 9 hours earlier here.
Can you link to where you saw it?
doesn't mean anything.

Actually it does. There is no greater sign of a market still filled with greater fools in denial than this. 
Despair is when whales don't play games with fraud shitcoins, because there is no one there to take the bait.

The fact its still so effective means we have some ways to go. 
People like ways to use words like despair these days. 
We've been in a bear market for months and Ive seen dips like this so many times before other leg ups so Im confused :|
Don't act like its easy to predict this market mate.
Wouldn't bet on that, either...
Why does it always have to be in extremes with everyone around here?

Why do you think so? 
[deleted]
and then you have 1000% more BTC; which is now worth  0. grats :)
haha noobs!
Meh, there have been several examples of bears lifting off the sell pressure since 11.7 and just wait for the next big resistance to resume the selling. Every time people claim "looks good, bears nowhere to be seen". It's just that they are being patient, and the price isn't rising because of convincing buying but because of a temporary relief in selling.
Low selling has almost always preceded massive selling in this market. The bears go into hibernation to get the best price possible then unload all at once 
I'm not *saying* it is. I'm *asking* if any experienced traders think it will, because of the low volume.
*throws shoes*
Yep ... not you
:). Oh I'm not worried this sub has the influence on the price, cos it obviously doesn't (the likes of which bought these nearly 2000 BTC on Kraken for 6.5k have), just that I consider it boring and intellectually dishonest. 
Yes exactly, That's why any further correction is definitely extremely UNhealthy for BTC and increases probability that it never quite recovers enough to interest average joe ever again. 
Or not. Based on this, I can easily become millionaire now with your great tip, no? Riskless almost 15% profit (buying at 6.9 and selling at 8k), thanks you very much Sir. 

Do you seriously believe the bull***t you wrote (and hence putting your lifetime savings behind your words) or just randomly trolling on the internet?
It's only natural that bitcoin drop 70% after rallying 950%. 
Haha, indeed seems so. 
I see that you often have ~3% targets while up to 10% stop. So your prediction power is above 75%, impressive :-) 

Edit: Does your present setup applies to nearly all market conditions?
Good support, not a bad idea with a tight stop and oversold.
Dont you think it is holding up pretty well? 
goes to show the general sentiment... 
What’s your target sir ?
No and it's sad frankly , I think Russia is the most corrupt county there is and all thanks to VVP
Sorry I meant the BEST COUNTRY!!
(FSB please don't kill me)
This guy gets it!
Yea sorry , you are correct.
Agreed.

Was starting to get nervous when it broke 7.4 and I was already underwater by 13k contracts.  https://i.imgur.com/2JqqihW.jpg
Bally call I suppose but honestly, in these markets, if you have iron hands and enough room before liquidation you can make most of your margin positions pan out correctly if you're patient. 


Not hard when you invest $10
Have you read this daily lately and seen the upvotes / downvotes?  It’s now filled with elitist assholes with so much hubris regarding their shit TA predictions that downvote everything.  Pretty sad.
My favourite comment is still ‘only noobs sell below 8k’. It’s from my favourite bulltard who is now in hiding.

He is right though. The OG holders are gonna ride it out and only panic sell at 3k when enough of their millions have vanished.
If you think about it, that’s a pretty bullish statement.
Seems the volume doesn't match the formation. Neckline was 7250 counting the wicks, but most likely is 7300.
[Chart](https://imgur.com/a/l49Qr)

Most likely was just 7050 the target and already hit...
Thanks, still learning
yes, it was about everyones favorite shorter saying he is clinging on to his 7k short and me stating in response to that if you don't know the risk tolerance, strategy and timeframe for someone elses trade it's no point in trying to say "haha look at your stupid trade" until everything is settled
Here's an archived version: https://www.removeddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/899akt/daily_discussion_tuesday_april_03_2018/dwrdyxh/
how's that -700% looking now ?
>what is meta-self-irony
Just my opinion. It was close enough to 6k to be considered the double bottom attempt. Obviously anyone believing 6k would be the absolute bottom would try to get in right before everyone else so 6.4 seems like a good a place as any. 
This is exactly my thinking. I'm fairly certain we go to 8k from here and then head back down to low 6's. But seeing as I don't have a crystal ball I may end up losing money here if we don't hold here. 
Agreed. 
'They can maybe sustain a drop to $6,800 without a total collapse of the recovery. But providing sellers with even the slightest amount of momentum is a surefire recipe for a horrifying decline below $6,000.'

'If it drops below $7,250, then $7,000 to $6,800 become viable targets. '

Sounds like you're right.
6960-6830 are valid retracement targets in this bullish leg upwards and I am just waiting for that final spike down to hit them.

Maybe a pullback to 6.8 is still salvageable but I think the daily really has to close in the 7's. 
Sorry that I crashed BTC to the ground by shorting it. Evil bears I know. 
Shorts closing doesn't seem like the necessary ingredient for a healthy turnaround. At best it would be temporary relief. 

+ Stronger bears won't be getting liquidated or panic closing anywhere near 7-8k. 
A pump from short squeeze will be temporary relief, we need real buyers at this point. 
Shorts are at the lowest point of the last four days. There won't be a short squeeze until we go much lower...
What's odd is he even admits to wanting to short. 

I don't know why he'd think they're getting antsy, we're ~10% above the lowest low we've had in 5 months.

I'm personally baffled at the complete lack of buying pressure, really. I thought we'd stay above $7k for longer  
It should bounce here to test 7k then go to test 6.8 support.

I'd say keep it to break even if you don't mind missing profits here. If 6.8 breaks we may see sub 6k soon.
Set stops at breakeven. Close in the 5000's
I agree with dush and v4mpyre. break-even stops, otherwise hold it.
This is why I don't rely on TA anymore, just RSI 3H bull divs for bottoms/longs and obvious lack of buying pressure for shorts.
did you HODL?
Haha I agree. People need to learn their lesson.
Exactly. Alt market is obvious indicator on whether we're at bottom or not. They're still delusional. Market can only reach bottom once dumb money decide to give up.
No. That wasn't my point. The point is, no bull market has ever started when the majority of people are bullish. Bull markets always begin when the sentiment is, you're an idiot for buying. That is not here right now. Now, we have about half of investors still hopeful and postive that the bull run is just days or weeks away. In 2015, almost everyone was convinced we were going to crumble to 0, this board was 80% doom & gloom. 

We're not there yet. There will be more shaking out via another drop & muddling before we head up.
There was a big poll last week that showed 55% are bullish. Yes, lots of delusional people out there.
but not until September if those earlier articles suggest, they won't be making a decision until then
We need to break and hold above the downtrend resistance line before we're out of the bear market. 
Sellers are showing slight more interest in selling due to the momentum of the market but still think they can wait for a better deal a little higher up. Buyers seem to have accepted further downward movement is a given. I think our next move is down anywhere from the next few minutes to hours.
Let's give McAfee 115,000$ and he will bring Bitcoin to the moon. Or let's say he will bring the moon to Bitcoin.
Dude, get off my dick. You follow me around everywhere. Don't you have anything better to do?

And to answer your question: No, since I realised anyone with an IQ over 100 left this sub months ago and anything of actual value that gets posted here gets downvoted, so why bother? Now I just post here for fun. 
Do the bulls that posted that propoganda/bull-fud/hopium?

some people need to put in a short term trade for 1hr+. don't put down people you don't know. Rule#1 be excellent to each other.
think he's going for "you get a bull div, you get a bull div, everyone gets a bull div"
You get losses in your portfolio. You get losses in your portfolio. Everyone gets losses in your portfolio!!
I’m wondering if that’s autocorrect or some new term we’re supposed to know 😂
Basically every timeframe 15m-1d has a bull div right now but as you said some of the LTF ones may have played out already... Also daily closed ugly AF. Just can't find it in myself to go short with rsi bottomed out all over the place on HTF.
At 20k, you would have said that about a fall to 6k
I'm not worried. Bitcoin will rise again.
This is exactly my biggest concern. 
The next 25 seconds are critical for the development of those 20 minutes.
Sideways?
I think we're gonna go up, or fall to 7300 then go up from a huge green bar. It seems like the powers that be are allowing time frame of rally to exceed 2/3 rule to make it look like a return to a falling trend. price falls and they buy up then push up again to repeat. This is what happened between the 2nd and the 3rd, during the initial rally. 
I think it'll be a few hours, we have a potential head and shoulders forming on 15m
Ha ha. Name check - shouldn’t you have commented on the h&s too !? 
Ta!
Been in Limbo at Coinbase for almost two months.  Nothing complicated about it.  I was going from MY vault to MY wallet.  Countless other complaints as well across Reddit groups.  For all their new products, adding coins etc they could care less about their average customer.  You get no updates and a scripted response every time you contact them that your request has been escalated.

I just filed a complaint with the CFPB, lawsuit and FBI are next.  Something fishy is going on.  They either don't care, they have a major system malfunction or it is outright fraud.

I stopped trading futures because of the poor liquidity. It's basically maximum reckage if you set a market stop. 
Typical impatient crypto-boi.
I can wait 4 years to be a millionaire.
2.3 transactions a second yesterday. 

Wouldn't say that's a disaster - more a temporary lull while scalable solutions are integrated.

Disclaimer: Without knowing what the transactions are this is a very vague indicator. How do we not know the spikes weren't Exchanges doing some crazy coin splits etc. 
Adoption is not decreasing it just *started* to increase last year. Lot of people are scared because of the massive drop due to the massive FUD from december, but it's going to disappear and it will turn in a good opportunity for lot of people. Integration is also only increasing everywhere, you should read /r/bitcoin a bit more.
There are coins with enterprise level adoption around the corner. May not be the decentralised vision everyone has, but it's coming
Let's place a 5 year bet.

My take? Bitcoin will have achieved a price of at least $100,000.

Counter me. I'll put $10k on the line. Will you?
Lol only 24 hours ago, people were ready to pop champagne and celebrate, and today it's starkly different
I'd welcome it at this point. Id rather wait for  for sure sign of a reversal and miss out on a little gains then to go long now only for it to drop more and lose more money.


I don't think naked shorts will work with Bitcoin.  Not for long, anyway.  Blockchain.  Immutable ledger and all that.  The tricks that work in other markets won't work here.  Ironically, it's the small-time hodlers sending coins to cold storage who will slay the titans.
And leveraged longs can lose more then they're initial investment as well. My point remains, many users trading in margin and leverage are inexperienced and the most likely to get fucked be it tomorrow or 5 years from now.
[deleted]
You keep proving my point. How much is the loss of $1 to $0?

How much is your loss on $1 to 10?
It`s true. BTC will break the ATH in the next few days. People are crazy about BTC right now...
that's perfectly fine..  who gives a shit at this point really? 

i'm honestly baffled by whos stupid enough to buy at this time 
Pretty sure this is how bear markets work everywhere, so yep
Holy fuck man, I bought Antshares at like 2 bucks back in June or July

What the fuck happened in 2017

I remember being super content when my ETH hit 10 bucks again and BTC broke 1k.

I booked a lounge at the club and invited all my friends
From number 8 or 9 in CMC down to the rest of the list we should see $0 in almost every coin if there is any logic left in the world.

1600+ cryptocoins? WTF...
People on r/cc were saying $100 for NEO was a steal a few weeks ago. Everything's still a bit overvalued at the moment to be honest.
This. The prior grousefest over the fact that some traders don't know precisely what immutable means in relation to bitcoin misses the point. While I understand the griping (I was a computer scientist at one time), this has grown well beyond the point of fundamentals, and is raw speculation in its purest form. Honestly, that's why I'm trading this instead of focusing my attention on other markets.

Setting aside BTC for a moment, if you claim you're trading this market on fundamentals, how do you establish a price for ETH, given its unproven nature, its likely legal problems, and the fact that we don't really know how much of it there will be? And it's only the tip of the iceberg. 
ha! I wish. But it's nothing but whale battles on GDAX right now.
yup, however whales do drive the markets at times, liquidate margin traders etc. and spoof walls can show which direction some whales want the markets to go in the short-term.  I consider many factors.
Any single order. 

On the other hand, having 750 orders totaling 1250 BTC, in comparison to 300 sell orders totaling 700 BTC means something.
Because it can go +85 in the same time?
You got it..
Lot off people get ... nervous when price drops or spike in 1 hours.

my point is that MMs (sellers particularly) were relentlessly selling that we didn't have a >2% breather all day long... they probably figured it out now.

edit: congrats on you trade.
How about... the ICO bubble has burst and BCH is losing traction?!?!  As folks give into this truth, BTC dominance will increase.  
[deleted]
> Those are the coins that will put crypto on the path to real world adoption and on the road to success

This is a spurious claim.
There are less than a handful of alts that are good for anything other than speculation.  Hell, eth's main utility is to be used for speculation on other alts.  lol
Yes, I can't wait till we can live in a cashless society, exchanging xrp for good and services!  
Before the ICO scam craze and BCH, BTC was sitting at 85% just about a year ago.  Most of that will unwind.  
Makes sense 
agree. it's more of a question of "who's still buying" seeing that the pumps are short-lived. 

but I gotta tell you, FOMO is real in each and every pump. for me at least.
Why assume people who bought in earlier have stronger hands? They haven't even been tested. Anyone who bought in after $200 in 2016 and before November 2017 hasn't had to deal with being more than 40% underwater at any point in time, even if they bought *the very top*. You don't have strong hands by virtue of buying early. It gives a false impression of "strong hands". Strong hands means you can sit underwater when you know it's silly to sell. It doesn't mean sitting through a 70% correction just because you're up 1000%

Note how people keep asking "who's selling here?" 

That's because the majority of people who comment and are capitulating here bought *way* above $7k. No one understands that yes, there are people who actually bought in sub $6k who still want to sell at a profit. 

Keep in mind that people who bought in sub $3k own *way* more btc than people who bought in above $6k
Diminishing returns on weak hand release, yes.
well it is shit tbh, none of its shit but all of it is overvalued lol
*sensible chuckle*
Its the noobs who are shorting anything for the first time in their life. That's gonna be the real bubble.
I mean, lots of the bears here are so bearish *because* they had the same experience.

I didn't lose 50% but I lost LOTS of paper profits and that's part of the reason I am so bearish. I understand the newbie perspective very, very well.

There's nothing wrong with using your own experiences to understand others. 

It reminds me of the "every cynic is a disappointed idealist"

in that "every bear is a disappointed bull"
When I said noob it includes me as well. I lost a lot because I was a naive bull and thought BTC will continue growing. At least I learnt my lessons from that. Now I am short well above the current price (25x) and hopefully will get out with a good profit.
If it was "organic" growth, how can a sell off like this be "healthy"?
I’m inclined to agree with this tbh

edit: OP edited his comment
Are you kidding? 7200 was a stronger level than 7k. I swear some of the comments here
Thank you, I couldn't confirm it myself so I guess it is true.
and you are mooning when it goes up?
This isn’t even remotely breaking the rules.
His comment isn't exactly high quality but what about this breaks any rules...?

Really, his observation is pretty accurate. I'm personally surprised as well
I'm not trolling. To be honest, I would love to see BTC explode to new highs eventually just like everyone else but the chart says otherwise. 
Sloppy..... 
I'm in BTC/ Crypto now 3 years.
No worries. 
It is Play money!!
I long at 600$ and 1200$. And saw price at >16K.

Not desperate.... just curious how it goes and with my" play " porto. And wish all people profit..  and that Crypto stays.

You.... You sound desperate...

I'll take it over "First!!!11!!1" I guess.
The people who actually think BTC will replace USD/fiat are either completely insane or are way too wrapped up in tech to understand that that's simply not the way the world works
[deleted]
Fair to who? Certainly not the creditors. The fair thing to do, which Mark also states he is behind in the ama, would be to return the coins to creditors in a proportional amount. 

Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like this is likely to happen. Most likely outcome is liquidation. 
 I sense the proximity of souls…
Stop spreading FUD. Everyone knows the next couple days are critical. 
Thanks, but how are mods supposed to fight cultural slippage when the sub is losing its identity? I'm losing hope.
That's exactly what I don't want this sub to turn into.
In many ways he caused them to force hold and they are now worth an incredible amount compared to how a huge portion would have been sold at $400, $500, 1k, etc.  Each price point reaches someone's cash out number and they leave.
> I am doing my best to help make it happen.

Bullshit, he's just surviving at this point.

I don't trust flags lately. They break how they want.

But I just don't see this going past 7k before testing lower low.
You very well could be right. I'm just preaching caution and preparation for other possibilities in lieu of assuming Bitcoin will necessarily dominate. This is a highly competitive space with a lot of smart people and Bitcoin does not hold all the cards.
The current limited utility of smart contracts (and no need to dance around it--specifically ETH) is not in imagination of application so much as it is lack of scaling. Which Bitcoin has still not completely solved either. But it's true that if that never gets solved, it doesn't matter how good your smart contract ideas are.
NANO.

Rootstock

For most use cases: Bitcoin Script

well said... maybe scaling of time is the unknown function

But until proven otherwise, I agree with you 100%
HA! That's a sore spot for me after selling a bunch at $950 after getting scared by PE FUD. 
Ahh ok, then your post makes sense, will edit the comment, but srsly:

**MUH BUTTER!**
We're living parallel lives, particularly regarding pasta.
seems like it'd be smart then to hedge a position on swaps with futs and close whichever one you don't want open when you finally *do* want to open a trade
You didn't wait for confirmation and clicked again. They show error as soon as you do market order, if it's not shown then you're in queue and it's gonna execute.
Bitfinex lost $72 million of customer fund and never explained what happens.   Yes they seem very trustworthy, so use them.
Didn't mean to insult you, but regardless of via their website or directly through the API you can set options like "reduce only" or "post only" to avoid accidents.
When you trade via API you should monitor the order status.

Of course their system should be more responsive, but its impossible to guarantee that when a certain number of requests come in at the same time.
BTC needs to 3x from here for even the most noobiest of noobs to be up from buying the top. We're barely even below the parabolic blow off top from November
>  It's literally all about them.

No, it's not. That's where you're misunderstanding the capitulation part. When all faith is lost by the majority of people who entered during the bull run (after $1k) is when capitulation occurs. It's not a singular event, it's something that happens over time. 

I don't know why you would base capitulation off the people who bought in the top 15% of the bull run. I mean there are only a few people who even had a chance to buy in above $17k. We were there for like a week.

Of course people who bought above $17k have capitulated. That's not what people here are talking about. We're talking about people who are super comfortable in their buy from $2k who think they'll never have to make a decision on when to sell.
tbh I'm not sure why you're hung up on not enough bears in here claiming it's capitulation/a phase that has truth to it but is ultimately fabricated and not some law
I really don't know how people do this with spouses, it can be stressful enough single, not to mention the alarms in my bedroom
Hahaha right? I just have an acquaintance who set up what I described above about 3 years ago and ended up with a 6-figure portfolio on a 4-figure cost basis. I'm tempted to set it up myself just for fun. I doubt the same will happen, but hey, it could. 
Lots of longs opening you say? Now where did we see this before...
Thanks, will set alerts above 6800. Don't feel like setting blind limit sells is wise. 
This is my greatest regret this year.
Still learning TA so appreciate the feedback. I thought using body or wick of candle was more of personal preference. As long as you are consistent.
[removed]
what if a large long position at 0.01$ is liquidated... Let that sink in.
What happens after is when you really need your crystal ball. 
looks decent i must say. no sell off...

Oh well .. crypto... you never know.

Long term buying /( adding me )  wouldn't be bad 
Lol why? Wouldn't it have worked out in the end?
But when sell walls are put up, it's "dirty tricks"
Bout half an hour 
Never trust low volume movement.
Two more questions if you don't mind. When you enter your hedge short, are you using perpetual swaps or the June futures? Also, when you setup your stop loss, are they typically market stops or limit stops?
That's gonna be risky...

Why didn't you flip when you exited?
Agreed, that's why I wrote 'some kind of bounce'.

But 7k was good support, don't think it'll be broken just to go back down.
Smaller time frames.

Trend is down, RSI won't stop the drop but it should at least point out small bounces.
> Honestly, I'm off the opinion that buyers are fucked.

off or of?
That description has pretty much always been true. It's true until it's not, and it's not true at the most inconvenient times. Lightning resolves this, so I'm not sure what your point is.
I'm about to do the same, what's your take profit point for the next 1-4hr? aka next resistance level you are eyeing
But if you did that then the price would have hit 6990 ;)
Hey congrats, we had some good support is why I said that but seems you have your system so that's awesome and it's working out, I'll check it out thanks for the tip. 
If you bought ETH at $20 and you're taking 99% liquidations on MEX, I'm really not sure what else to say.

long the ratio
I literally watched it go down after I closed my short :)

I think this is all a no-trade zone... or short and set stops to buy back...
Hmm, I better keep the short scaled at least as high as this long on the way down.

Really not expecting to end up closing the long at a loss though, there will be further oscillations that go above it's CA, and I will try as hard as possible to close it appropriately and not delude myself that I'll keep it for "the big one" and ride it into the heights of recovery.
Yeah I went ahead and added some back with this little falldown below 6.8 instead of waiting for 6.7. Left enough dry powder to throw on at 7k if it does end up bouncing. Not the best entry but not really concerned I'll have to close at a loss
This coin has made people lose their minds! Though maybe this Forum needs all comments to be written in song! Crypto the musical!
oh you bear
I doubt they can, and that's why I'd never trust this bet.  
I dont think tether is a scam. But if tether would be a scam, every exchange would exit scam because the whole market would be insta fucked.
this bot is fucking annoying. i dont know why it crawls under my skin
I'd say that's way stretched. But I'm not an expert in h&s.
Well, $1,200 would be the absolute lowest point at which I'd expect the market to bottom out. 

However, I wouldn't be surprised if overzealous sellers made it as far as $1,000.

Below $1,000 though, and one would have to wonder whether the market could ever recover.
lol its gonna be declared dead many times in the next year nothing new or meaningful

The norm for Bitcoin has actually always been to pump to absurd levels, and then fall back 100% of the way to the starting point.

~$1000 would be within the realm of "normal". 
You sure have alot of time on your hands child to be digging my profile. Idiots like you is the reason while BTC will fail. You just a moon boy hoping to get rich off BTC. You missed the boat in Dec and your all sour now :)
If it was him, hats off to him. Would be a pretty hefty profit.

You remember how big the buy wall was?
I understand. Thanks for the TA again, it looks pretty solid, but I don't have any money to trade with right now anyways so idk why I'm even here on this sub today.
guessing even a month or two out is absurd and just mental masturbation.
No we didn't. 1999 we had a recession, so if you are one of those people that blames presidents for the economy, then that was Clinton's fault. Obama did exactly what Bush was doing with the economy- kicking the can down the road with artificial "QE" pumps. 

This only "works" in the short term, which is why things looked OK when Obama was in office, but they were not. Trump is spending and increasing the debt even more than Obama, which will not end well. Far from free market economics.
Thanks for the explanation..indeed i could draw the 5 waves there. 
Still one of the things i have dificulties in getting it and using it as a tool is elliot waves.
https://www.tradingview.com/x/Kejjx0xX/
Your C wave already has five waves and it's not as long as your A wave.
Same here, all FIAT on Kraken. 
Default positions are 5X leverage and 33% of the stack. That way i can double up to DCA or enter a hedge with the rest of the stack to make up for an underwater position.

No fun in that
So what was the low? 

NVM only looked at the february dump
I do think once you have been in this market for a little while and experience it, either for the good or bad, you probably keep an eyeball on it.  We got a fuck ton of new eyeballs last year.  So that makes me a little bullish.  History tends to repeat itself.  Play safe and be prepared for next time.  That’s my plan.  
Reinvesting your profits is the killer trap here.

Say you invest 1k and manage to make a really profitable trade with 900% gains. You now have 10k, and you owe the government 2.7k. Now, if you reinvest all of that 10k and make a 90% loss, **you are back at 1k, but you still owe 2.7k in taxes for that first trade**! Sure, you also have a 9k loss, but how much of that can you deduct?
Sorry for late reply. Please read 2012bear reply as it applies to me. 
Cause you hold for life...
Dont play dumb. If everybody would just HODL, BTC would be at like 10 Million per coin.
When was BTC ~6,800 for a prolonged period?
I wouldn't say a V bottom for like 1 day meant we were "at sub 7k", really. I don't know why people act like we spent any meaningful time down there like we are now. 

Also, sub 7k was two months ago, not a couple weeks ago. 
No idea why anyone is downvoting me. What I'm saying is true. People said we'd go sideways at $8k for a long time and here we are.

People have pretty bad memory here
Nope. They just downvote cause I crushed the hopium. We spent like 15 days in the history of BTC at this price and apparently it's massive support range. 😄

I'm fine with that. AFter closing my long I'm still "long" just without leverage. Plus that's my dream short entry point

Buy and hold and look back in 2020. This will all look silly.
time to buy
Bear Market was pretty much over, but you had to short the corn into the ground! It is all your fault.
Has BTC ever been stable though? :-P
lol

Shorted 5 BTC but closed too early
If he bought 1 coin at $19500, and BTC reaches $50k by 2030, he's got 150% return over 12 years, or >10% a year averaged. Not terrible. TVM, inflation, yada yada. Not sure the S&P would do better though :P

I recommended a well-to-do acquaintance throw 2% of his portfolio at crypto in late January with the caveat that it might go to $0, but it might return significantly more than standard markets could. I told him to forget about it and to check in quarterly with a 3-5 year expectation before re-evaluation. 

Edit to add: I know recommending buying crypto is pretty taboo. But this person was clear on scenarios, including a real possibility of losing all of it. It was only a small portion of what the S&P had gained him in 2017 anyway. 
12 years is several generations on crypto.
Im not sure what my next move is i closed that short for decent profits and im sick af, my head is pounding, idk to short or long, fml
I reshorted smaller position tho 
now im back long preparing myself for the rekt
Will you be closing it all? Expecting a bounce from 6k8? 
I'm short from 7260 and trying to decide if i close here (have a tight trailing stop (@6915) that can be triggered anytime) or just close part and let the rest ride relaxing the stop
I agree it has been overstated here but i really don't think 6k is our floor. Its just a pretty solid support that has gotten bought up the last 2 times, but when (if) we do even slightly break it, we're going to freefall imo.
I guess we'll see soon enough, no?
Lets see if we go below 6400 in that case
I closed my short a little early thinking 7k would hold, so not sure, but I’m sitting on my hands for now
True, and the other way too. "If we break 9k we'll see 14k in the next 48h"

Sure.. 10mn after breaking 9k there was of course another resistance at whatever 9.3k and again "If we break..."

God this is so childish and unprofessional. No wonders the market is so shit after the mainstream run of December.
???
Haha thanks buddy. Probably should have PMd. Just wanted your thoughts if you heard it mentioned. 
And the way alt holders see bitcoin is the way (ultra) bitcoin maximalists see the banking system
If there was no fud or alts or China we would have 100m BTC by now.

I feel like some people here genuinely think the best traders *know* where the price is going. The idiots on tradingview who talk like they can predict the future don't help this 
Sure...
And Raiden does not exist, nor is it even close to ready, let alone the fact that the codebase looks like it was written by 27 year olds... yes, 20 seven year olds... 20 of them

Raiden is a 1-1 copy of the Lightning Network.
Ahhh..I was looking at Finex numbers for everything quoted in my previous post ($6000.00 low in Feb)
That combined with the fact that it tested 7500 and bounced off pretty hard. Momentum over the long term is still with the bears. I think more volume is needed to sustain this jump.

Edit: I am not an experienced trader, nor do I pretend to be one, so completely disregard anything I say.
You can slowly move your June long to September. Thats what I would do

I know I was being v funny
I think in general you should be much more patient with your positions. Trade with lower leverage if need be. Think about it...you're closing at $50 profits. If you traded on literally 1/10th the leverage it'd only take a $500 swing to make the same money. Pretty sure you could up that to 1/3 the leverage and easily stomach a ~$166 loss, which would allow you to catch much larger swings and would reduce your risk by *a lot*
I'm consistently surprised at how profitable this damn thing is. Being patient is incredibly rewarding apparently 
That's what they do.

You are just a noob and probably mad at the market. Emotional traders are the first who get rekt. I don't care if it goes to 7800 or not, I will adapt my plan when I see the prices change.

I went long now and I will instantly sell or flip my position when it's going the other way. 

Don't follow other people's advice, especially not on reddit but you just lack knowledge about pretty basic shit so whatever dude


>Edit: Does your present setup applies to nearly all market conditions?

I utilize it mostly when we are chopping between resistance points. 
Of course I do.  Exceedingly well considering the underlying asset.
5.5-5.7 then will look to long to 8k then short to 3k. 
This makes me sad because most Americans group all of Russia with Vladimir Putin and forget that they're many of you there who hate the current state of things.
Isn't FSB called something different now?
I worked for Russians and they are the most scrappy competitive workers I've ever seen.  Being number 1 isn't a goal its expected and they will do whatever needs to be done to get it.  It's what I admire but also it leads to some naughty behavior lol
Hey man we are both in shitty situations, all we can do is drink our political sorrows away. Cheers friend 🍻

People here are generally nice as long as you substantiate your guesses/predictions with proper analysis. That's more than I can say about any other crypto-related subs.
Long time holder here .. i can guarantee you I have not sold any stash below $11,000 and will wait until 2024 halving if I have to and prefer to wait until I can directly pay for most things with btc.  Drive the price as low as you want I'll just add to my stash LOL.. fkn short term losers and nocoiners can't shake me.

Oh, I saw that one.

Don't you think mentioning this again is just fuel for fire?
Pretty good thanks to my add at 7.4 but we're not even close to closing this baby.

You're hedging if 6.8 falls?
Nice, thanks for digging it out
as long as you’ve got tight stops to bail if we go sub 6500, should be fine
you still got that short?
No, you're just a douchebag who shitposts far too frequently.
This is the double edged indicator of more shorts open: a strong indicator that the herd is not close to believing in BTC to put their main stack back in
And most of us have made a lot of profit shorting while sitting in fiat so I'm not sure where the antsyness is supposed to come from
All the way to $19 lol
Yes grandma.
What is the objective measure of when this entirely speculative market is delusional or not? 
People's opinions only matter if they impact the market. And it's quite clear that bears are having a much stronger impact. No matter how many times bulls yell BTFD, no one's buying. Bullish sentiment is largely dead.
Of course , they hope for a bull run because they have looses to cover up but watching right now at bitfinex wall, from a slight rebounds now it continues to have a red zone again
Poll earlier this morning before these drops I saw said 50% thought the bottom was already in
Where was the poll done? Lots of delusional people sure...but what influence do they really have aside from fitting in to some bubble popping narrative? They are likely minnows in the sea.
If by then we are on a bull run people should hold on to the coins. If we're still in a bear market that could be very bad
Yup, fail of breaking 7.5 took some faith from buyers. We're not at the bottom yet. Everybody waiting for sub 5k coins and those bounces are just scalpers trading.
LOL this thread is really funny
This guy literally doesn’t understand anything about bitcoin and I agree with you. 
Not that new, I bought at 20k and hodl since...
My bad. Thought you were asking if it would be wise to fomo long on this spike and the answer is obviously no. 
Yes, thanks for the translation. 
Not seeing it on any other time frame. Any time above 1hr has not yet made a lower low so there's no bull div. 15 min has not made a lower low with the earlier dip either. Keep in mind that RSI is calculated using closing price so you shouldn't put too much stock in wicks - RSI would have been lower when the price was actually creating the wick. Daily may have made a lower low in closing price but it's too early to say if it's done going down - next daily candle could be more red and erase the very very slight bull div.
> t be are allowing time frame of rally to exceed 2/3 rule to make it look like a return to a falling trend

if my uber leet prediction skills are right we will see a huge green bar not to far away
Sorry to hear that - the reason I ask is that I had a similar issue ages ago. 

They ignored my emails too, eventually managed to connect on Live Chat and the person I was speaking to cut off the chat and then turned the chat system off.

Eventually hassled Brian Armstrong on Twitter and it was resolved pretty much instantly.

I think they basically have more customers than they can cater to rather than it being fraud. Still shitty though. Good luck.
Not that I like centralization that is occuring on Bitmex, but I would like your non-"shady bucket shop" exchange to deal with 10X increased userbase in just a few months.

On the separate note, try using advanced order options like limit take-profit/stop-loss orders to execute even under heavy overload.
Yeah, I usually set alarms like chewy, but sometimes I do get some major slippage
In bitcoin?  To be a millionaire in 4 years you will still need quite a bit of bitcoin I suspect.  Need to find the bottom.  
Nice troll. 
Are you referring to the RFID coins?
Put your money on the line on bitmex or Kraken or bitfinex. I have no interest in a verbal agreement with you and I could not give 2 less fucks about the price 5 years from now. 
I'll take that bet. $10k, let's do it. How does Reddit usually validate these kind of bets?
I mean, the situation was VERY different 24 hours ago. 

Yesterday buyers had the momentum and literally ALL they had to do to was hold $7,250...a price level they'd quite literally JUST reclaimed. 

It's as if you were playing hockey with your little brother and said, "okay, I'm going to go inside to grab a drink. I'm leaving my net completely unprotected and all you need to do is skate over to my net and score."

And when you come back outside, your brother somehow managed to score on himself instead and is standing there crying.


No, that's not how it works. On BTC exchanges offering margin you're never going to lose more than the base amount you contribute to the position.
Read my comment up top. I explain why
Infinite is a relative term. Nothing in the universe is infinite.
You are both right... And honestly both quite retarded at the same time.

If I naked short at 1 usd and the price goes to 0.01, I have an infinite return, because my “investment” is 0

If I naked short at 1 usd and the price goes to 10, I have to pay back 9 usd, which is an infinite loss, because my initial investment is 0

Now, if I pay an initial margin to cover say a 10% adverse movement, if I short at 1usd, I pay 10c in initial margin

If the price goes to 0.01, I get 99BTC (worth 99c) that I “paid” 10 cents for, so 990% return in fiat and 9900% return in BTC

If the price were to go to 0, I get infinite BTC (worth 0) that I “paid” 10 cents for... so 0% return in fiat (technically infinite loss, because your 10c are now worthless), but infinite return in BTC
Looool. I'm so done with you man. Take an elementary grade math course seriously. If BTC goes to 0 any short covering at 0 makes infinite profit. 

Obviously it's not going to $0.00 but I have no description for your intelligence if you can't see how the profit would be infinite in that virtually impossible scenario posited tongue in cheek. 
This is the exact right time to buy.
That's funny because I'm baffled in the other direction, especially since it seems to be only one whale who's selling enormous quantities with the rather obvious sole intention of pushing the price down a few hundred bucks temporarily. 

PS. He won't be the first bearwhale to be slain by Bitcoin, and he probably won't be the last.
It is hard to say but I definitely would agree a few coins can provide 99% of the functionality.  How many operating systems or internet protocols do we need?  It’s simply a question of adoption.  There will likely just be a few massive winners and the obvious horses at the moment are bitcoin and ethereum.  
It is very difficult to put a valuation on any of it because the very first driver of the price is adoption.  We got a serious adoption spike end of last year.  It came pretty slow then started growing in summer then went to inanity late in the year.  Now that is behind us.  Think about the people around you.  Are they throwing money at this market like they were last year?  I sure as hell don’t see that.  The ico game brought in a massive wave and now that it is cooling off and we are left with a massive list of shit the market will naturally clean house.  The next wave likely will not be as crazy and stupid as the last.  Whatever people actually believe in will survive and new shit will come out of left field, like it always has in crypto.  Anyone telling me they knew ethereum would blow up to stupid heights when it was in presale, or knew crypto kitties would make ethereum unusable, or Bcash would get pumped to 4K is full of shit.  This is the most unpredictable thing on the planet.  People also just seem to assume the market will grow and be huge.  Maybe it is right but I don’t assume it.  It already outran itself to a massive degree.  Will more people do it again?  Will they look at those charts and say hey this dumped 90%, maybe good time to buy?  It kind of happened in summer then again at the end of the year.  That mania phase could be the crypto hay day, who knows.  Maybe people actually start figuring out how to use crypto for something other than trading.  It’s a video game to me until then.  
Maybe spoofers just want to close their positions, and they drive sheeps towards their orders to fill them or maybe they are just spoofing for fun. I did this sometimes in an altcoin orderbook by putting e.g. 10 btc order on to another 10-15 btc order, which makes the order more "whalish". I mean, most of the information from orderbook is delusive. Everything imho, of course.
And thanks for correction :)
You don't know exactly how many people is really willing to buy or sell. Some portion of people may just wait outside of orderbook, ready to give market orders.
1. Pre mine
2. ICO
3. Buy up your own supply to maintain the price

Let's pretend to have a fish farm. I've managed to collect 10,000 fish. I decided to sell my fish. But, I was thinking, maybe, I'd like to stockpile these fish myself. So, when someone buys a fish from me I'm going to turn around and use the money they paid me to buy a fish for myself, from myself. I'll take that fish and put it in a different pond where I'm not selling fish.

Because I bought a fish for myself, from myself, t looks like I have more money to buy more fish from myself, again. I know, I'll buy another fish from myself and put it in my other pond, again. Now I'll do that 9,900 times.

Hey, what do you know I sold all my fish at $10 each. That means I have $99,000 in my pond.

The fractional reserve is the supply in the market that's used to aquire other assets like Bitcoin.
my concern is, yeah, that's great if a coin has a real world use (insurance is one that comes to mind), but who in their right mind would ever consider it if the price goes astronomically because of speculation?
I’m actually interested in ETH as a protocol as opposed to BTC as a payment system.  I trade BTC as a way to play the ratio and eventually sell it all for ETH.  ETHtrader is just a moonboy hellhole now.  I get what your saying though.  I think BTC will have staying power but, I don’t have any delusions of an AnCap utopia.  
High volume broke through quickly, doesn’t mean it wasn’t support. 
I have no idea what you are talking about.

okay well I'm glad you're doing okay. I meant to delete that comment I just hope you're not overinvested

11!! = 10,395


Fair enough I suppose
I can't see it, how close or far do I need to zoom in/out?
This happens every major bubble, the resulting long term bear market brings out the trolls. Just ignore and report rule breaks and we can start weeding out the trolls like we did last time.
I'm not a believer in order books meaning a whole lot, but it seems like the liquidity has dropped through the floor since we exited the 7000s. I haven't been watching all the exchanges, just gdax and mex. MEX especially stupid light compared to what we've been seeing for the past several days. Is everyone shell-shocked or something?

If you are talking about the hack, I know they refunded the users and they got hacked, so what's more to explain.
>I mean there are only a few people who even had a chance to buy in above $17k. We were there for like a week.

The volumes were insane. Total number of trades were easily higher than any regular "one week". So not as few people as you think bought.

>people who are super comfortable in their buy from $2k who think they'll never have to make a decision on when to sell.

So you're talking 3-figure territory, which is mathematically very hard to drop to, considering the higher amounts of parked, lost and forgotten amounts of BTC compared to 2016. I don't have the exact numbers and just making an educated guess here, but it's a reasonable one.
My SO is in full support of my trading, and offers help, but i dont want her to stare at charts all the time. And her believing in me is the best motivation i can imagine.
My wifey doesn't believe it's real until it hits the bank account, I'm good with that and don't tell her how much I have made or lost, it's better that way lol.  
It is a good strategy, and smart too, but trading is just so much fun.

But i guess a little extra money cant  hurt, let us know if you start the haserfauld fund ;)
It'll be good strategy after we hit that bottom.

We still can go down and never go back here.
No, it is not.
bit of a stumble but you’ll bounce back 
There is probably some truth to that, but the longer the time frame, the more important the wick. I usually ignore wicks completely on 5m, fudge on 15m, and pay attention on 1h or over. Consistency is most important, probably, though.

Seriously? [Where the fuck did that sink come from?](https://i.imgur.com/MDhbuT6.jpg)
I expect my crystal ball may be faulty/void now that I've put it in writing.
I'm patiently sitting in my long still. Scalped a few sells and re-buys on the way down that did practically nothing for my bottom line. Expected a retrace, accepted a deep retrace, but not $1k in a day.

I know, I know....

Anyway, I'm still being patient. You can probably write my obituary in a few days.
Yesterday I shorted the June futures. Which was risky, and a big part of why I closed it in the middle of the night.

As for stops, I generally set alarms instead of hard stops. It allows me to hop onto Bitmex and evaluate the situation rather than just panic closing.
Wouldn't a limit stop just execute at the market price when posted?
I was way too tired to make any important decisions. 
Probably because it's still uncertain until something is confirmed one way or the other. I would assume as a trader you can't just flip plays so quickly without further information, or your initial thesis was weak to begin with.
of, obviously
Just reminiscing, mate
> Lightning resolves this

That remains to be seen.
I'm hoping we can get out this inside trading [here](https://snag.gy/tFnEbz.jpg), but target would be moves stops up and see how we deal with the cloud resistance at 7k, just a short scalp and see how it does., let it ride more if it can break through.   
Indeed. It spiked like crazy not 10 minutes after I went to bed, apparently. I probably would have just taken a close at 67xx if I'd seen that. Oh well. Now I just get to figure out where to re-enter. 
Thanks bro. Support was good, but it got tested over and over on a very short timeframe. Was likely to give in.
I don't know what to say when I see somebody letting his position go on 99% loss of trading stack.
This sub is full of dumb guesses.  It's mostly just mental masturbation for these people, which is fine but they choose to bore us with their inane thoughts and fantasies.
I still remember the day when btc dropped to $175 and folks were fearful the project was over.

As for fundamentals, tx costs are still to high for day to day use, true privacy is lacking, governance sucks, and msm adoption is abysmal.  I assume this will be solved one day, but as of today, BTC is extremely overvalued.
I wouldn't say aa stupid, it mirrors 2014 almost exactly. After the melt up to $20k in *December* people should've realized that was the top 
good stuff, thanks for sharing this, reading now

Ok. Thanks. But it’s where we were about a year ago, so isn’t that a bit low for its overall ascending trend? 
Yeah, it takes so long to hit Dinono33, instead of reply, and flick my thumb a couple times.  I actually got into ETH in the low single digits...IRS got a fat check coming this month.   Soooo, I’m not sour in the least bit.  Good luck chasing those Neo gains bro.

I was commenting on people's perceptions, like I thought you were doing.

Most people reflect very positively about the economy under Bill Clinton. The US had a federal budget surplus for the first time since 1969. I'm not going to attribute any credit, but the economy rocked under Clinton. He also probably greatly attributed to the great depression. I don't remember a recession in 99. I remember it being a few years later.

Lol
I guess i should read up before posting nonsense :D

If you had a 9K capital gain and a 9k capital loss in the same year, your total capital gain/loss would be $0 and you won't owe any taxes.


Doing some research indicates it depends on if you qualify as a trader or an investor to the IRS

https://www.marketwatch.com/story/tax-strategies-for-day-traders-2015-02-25

If you qualify as a trader (and it's a fuzzy qualification but let's say you don't have a fulltime job and you spend 20 hours a week trading) then you can deduct unlimited capital losses directly from your income.

However I've read other sources that seem to say even for investors capital losses can be written off directly from gains except under wash sale rules, which would be a problem if you buy back within 30 days. But you can avoid this if you sell all your crypto for the last 30 days of the year. Other sources say you can only deduct up to $3k in capital losses. Also these wash rules don't apply to traders.

edit: and then maybe wash sale doesn't apply to crypto at all

https://cryptotaxprep.com/wash-sales-what-every-bitcoin-investor-should-know/

This is all probably complicated by the fact that Bitcoin doesn't qualify as a security but ETH might.

Basically, getting an accountant is worth it, and asking sooner rather than later.
Ah yes the situation you're describing would screw some. I held most of 2018 so didn't have much of a tax burden this year. I will next year, though, since I sold into fiat, but I have time to plan for that.
I didn’t say prolonged, I’m just saying it is more stable ground than straight upwards. I guess my point is wasted on you, no hard feelings 
Damn, he took it seriously...

2 months is like 8 weeks, right? still a couple weeks :-P
Comparative to a parabolic trend yeah, it’s more stable / sustainable IMO
Repetitive, inane comments clogging up this daily - this is a trading sub, I'm sure those who are shorting are aware of the need to cover as much as those who are long... You going to warn everyone when they declare a position? 
Great investment advice to hold and not check and manage your investment for the next two years, despite whatever regulatory actions, technical problems, etc crop up in that time.  You could end up with BTC at $100 for all we know.   But it is a lazy, stress free strategy until of course you take your head out of sand and go into shock.
Sure will when its $10 and alts decoupled lol
Ofcourse it's volatile with ups and downs, but what i meant with "stabilize" is basically not having to continuously check out on BTC, because of fear that there could be capitulation at any moment.
This. I'm not recommending anyone invest long-term until there's more price stability.

150% over 12 years predicts an unprecedented level of price stability for Bitcoin. If the price only changes by 150% in a single year I would be surprised.
Damn well now where do i close this baddie
I'm done day trading for now since I'm on vacation. I already spend too much time on the Reddit app so I won't be sitting by my laptop all day scalping small movements. I'm confident in my current position for the medium term. 
who are all these people that are going to sell but haven't yet? I'm really interested in why 6k would be the trigger. The get rich quickers that piled on in December are long gone. Leaving long term holders. So who exactly is triggerd to sell at 6k that hasn't been triggerd at 6.5k or rather the first time we bottomed out there.
It may not be so soon but yup
That is my expectation at this stage. 

11.8 -> 9.2  
9.2 -> 11.7  
11.7 -> 8.3  
8.3 -> 9.9  
9.9 -> 7.6  
7.6 -> 8.6  
8.6 -> 7.2  
7.2 -> 9.2  
9.2 -> 6.5  
6.5 -> 7.2  
7.2 -> 6.4  
6.4 -> 7.5  

To me, this feels like the fakeout rise from 7.2 to 9.2 before the hammer fell to sub 7K. We'll see though.
I agree with Chevy, 6.8 is what is holding this, 6.4 is one time shot, if it won't bounce hard enough to do a double bottom then we'll see sub 6.
That's what I'm watching for. 6800 held fairly strong and the shorter term stoch RSI's cooled off, or we could just be painting another flag before another drop/rise.
I'm still on my short from 7260. Trailing stop tight as hell @6915.
I think i'll take profits here and re-enter on a bounce to 7000. If it stops me and goes down before 7000 i might re-enter if 6800 breaks no?
Effectively shills for an alt.
No biggie. 

I've heard of it. I don't trust it.
Counterpoint: Certain People really really need LN to fail, they have literally bet their entire fortunes on it. So they have to tell us it's no good. All the time. Endlessly.
Is that right? Please specifically reference one sub-par component in the Raiden codebase.

I've heard a lot of non-engineers make such claims.
That's the 38% fib retracement correct? I suppose it makes sense. If we can find some buy volume we can probably break through but I wouldn't count on that in a bear market tbh
haha sorry, I just laugh at all this bart talk. worse than the H&S meme!
Still angry that i closed my position way to early. Shorted at 11.7k, added on the way down  to an average entry  of 10.4k and closed on a bounce to 9.2k. Was all in with the trading stack too... :(

You got some strong hands, Sloppy.
It will be when you close it, it's not if it's still open. I'm just worried that you may miss the shot. But you know it already ;-)
I don't need a reason to validate a 8.4 short. Its massively in profit.
yes but I am not talking about it in relation to current news reactions, but in general. shorting has the "max profit" of 100%
Do you even math moron? If BTC costs 0 I could afford all 21m while broke. 

Damn dude, bulls straight retarded. 
same
So in other words you talk a lot, but at the same moment admit lack of real conviction too. How can you be so certain about my position or knowledge? Do you know me what? That's overwhelmingly strong judgement based on our short interaction here.
>You are just a noob

>Emotional traders are the first who get rekt

>**I can't really believe** we won't test 7800-8000

You are investing on faith and have no right to call anyone a 'noob'
OK. Thanks for the response.
Yea we do hate it , but we can't do shit about it , Russia is a great place to live if you are friends with Putin or friends with his friends , that's how it works 
Not to my knowledge , it used to be called KGB tho
I dunno man , must be some rare russians , tho it depends on the field , russians are one of the best in tech
Cheers
That was a joke...

You shouldn't let your position go that far.
Eh.. it was a much different place a year ago.
Read through the comments, including this particular thread, and see how many elitist assholes that are here who downvote everything into oblivion and talk down to other traders like their shit doesn’t stink.  


Thank you for your guarantee. It really helped put my mind at ease.
Not at all, I think it will make people think an extra step before treating trading as a football cheering game 
From new paradigm during the 11.8k double top to btc <1k now, you may not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like. 
nice, at least take some profits to average down you r investments
Poetic
Actually thanks for pointing that out, flipped to short at 7250, remembered that 7k is a strong support but forgot about 6.8. Good to know we can bounce there if 7k doesn't hold.
I should of commented and said I am only looking for a place to close a short not open a new long. A word of warning to this would be we started with a leading diagonal if we consider 6430 as a valid pivot.

Leading Diagonals (Raising Wedges) often retrace deeper to the 78.6% so that could take us as far down as 6650 and still be a valid retracement. A drop below this level would be a concern and a reconsideration of my short-term roadmap would be on the table.
Added last night at 7.4. I was in the Marianas trench for 2 days holding it. I'll probably add stops now though, I don't want to see another retest of 7.4 so I'm inclined to close if we got there. 


The last few weeks were horrible for  shorting.
such loss wow. 
well said.LOL...
Amount of long/short might be useful. A week ago, 4k BTC long FOMO'd into few hundreds dollar pump. Two days ago, another 8k long FOMO'd when market only jumped to 7.5. Market is still overly bullish.
I'd say we're still at about 50/50 but that will start tipping in the bears' favor very soon. The bullish idea that "We're very near the bottom" needs to disappear, and it definitely has not yet.
Exactly. 50% is very high. I'm guessing in 2015 when the last bull market started in September of that year only about 20% would say the bottom was in. Most thought we were going well below 100 at that time when it began to rise.
It was on Aaron Paul's twitter. Like 12,000 people responded. The fact that my post here got downvoted tells me we are a ways off, the bulls don't like comments perceived as "negative".
There's no holding on to the coins afaik. They are legally obligated to distribute claims in yen. 
And you troll my posts and try to preach trading advice?
The state of this sub..

lord have mercy on this green bar coming 
Thanks, I doubt it is a fraud to, but they certainly are not doing anything to keep customers.  I got my verification from Gemini yesterday.  It will be interesting to see if the coins still have that ridiculous buy pricing premium you see at Coinbase.  

I can't believe they still have the problems you experienced.   Instead of adding new things they need to get the foundation/ core of their business fixed first.  At minimum transfers between your own accounts should be instant and indisputable 
I filed the complaint yesterday.  I got a personal email me from them today.  Granted they are feeding me a line if B.S. about me not verifying or not receiving confirm at secondary email.  How stupid do they think I am.  That was the first thing I asked about.  The first time was day of tranfer.  Their staff has confirmed to many times to count that email verification was not the issue.  I sent them enough documentation to choke a horse.  Ridiculous. 
not really... if the price rockets up 20 times the current price you'd only need like 9 BTC
Amongst others yes.

Whether folks agree that it is a proper use of crypto or whatever, they have real partnerships with real companies, some already using them.
I did, and I'm a very happy man as a result.

Confidence is tricky when you need to back it up with cash.

I'm actually willing to make this bet if I can find a feasible way to make it happen/enforceable.
Lol 😂 that’s hilarious to think about. I wasn’t referring to you specifically, you were one of the few who was reservedly optimistic. 
Infinite is not a relative term... holy fuck
read my comment... it’s only infinite profit if counted in BTC. you make 100% loss if counted in fiat
lol @ you... delusional

this isn't a dip dude. this is a god dam bear market where 7k will soon be the local "top" in a matter of weeks.

Stupid bulls don't realize this price is now the norm not a "buying opportunity" 
Why? 
Both the pumps and the dumps are triggered by whales with enormous orders. We are just being played.
Yes. And, IMO until the point where we have a coin other than Tether that is low volatility, that you can trust will behave approximately like fiat currencies, that you can use to make cross-border payments as a substitute for credit cards and wire transfers, *and, ideally* that has some ability to void/reverse a transaction, we have a long way to go.
That's part of it, too. It's a giant heap of garbage funded by VC to create the illusion of value. You end up with shills on reddit vigorously defending the honor of bunny coin. If speculators understood how the price of these assets was being propped up they'd be looking for blood.
Some coins are starting to peg to prices, or other coins have mechanics in place to get to a desired point. Or some alts have uses where the token price is irrelevant because of divisibility 
Well, I think we may be on the same page there.  If ETH can get scaling figure out(in a decentralized way), I think it could be real competition to BTC in terms of societal use.

Also, ethrader is fun place to lurk to get a quick laugh, and gauge current sentiment in the alt scene.
Thx. No problem

good bot

Will do. You're right. I'm just frustrated. Thanks for all you do.
Liquidity is an issue everywhere if we have big move, books fill when we go sideways as traders don't want to jump a gun until this settles a bit.
ha, I have no idea what that means but I know the sh*t is fast and free as hell.  

Also, Monero. 
Now i am jelly. I dream of having a special freezer just for different types of butter, handmade baguettes, and some fine haze.

Life goals!
So you're using API, send order and don't read server reply before going further? That's bad coding...
It's not a tiny amount by any means, but it's less than would be required to base off of what capitulation entails.

Not talking about 3-figure territory necessarily. Personally my next targets are $4-5k. I don't like to get ahead of myself. I just am talking specifically about capitulation and the way it happens
Do you set alarms at night? If so does she not get pissed?
We certainly can, though I'm still bullish long term (3+ years). Hell, a lot of people spend more than this on drinks every week.

And if I'm not trading, I'd probably drink less! (kidding)

Truly, though, I probably won't be setting this up at least for a couple months, just because I can't justify it in the budget for now.
let. it. in.
Ooooh I see. I mainly meant being patient while in profit. Sitting underwater and being patient is a quick way to incur huge losses :P

This could definitely turn around for you to sell higher though. Why not sell at $7.5k? 
> evaluate the situation

I read that as shituation.
No with a limit stop you have a stop price and then a limit buy/sell. So when the stop price triggers, your limit order gets placed. With the stop limit there's a chance your order doesn't get filled, whereas with a stop market it is guaranteed to sell your position once the stop gets triggered.
I flipped :-P

But I was watching since 7350 and should've done it at 7.3.
Ehh... sorry. It's been a rough day for me in this sub. I've been on edge.
Thanks!
It wouldn't surprise me to see BitMEX cowboys do that, but someone that bought $20 ETH should know better lol

edit: the very fact it was 99% and not 100% is the sign of a true gambler haha
It was just a hedge on my trading stack

Not the best idea, wouldnt recommend it
7 of 19 executed (20 was a miscount in previous post), CA 6810.

Since my last post also my short has again taken profit and reloaded.  Its CA is now down to 6890.

Edit, btw SL on the short is 6944.
I saw the pattern, but still think it may not be valid h&s.
What is your position currently? 

I was out the last week and started building a short position 3 days ago, average entry right now is 7.2k after being underwater the whole time. Will add on any bounce, currently only ~15% of my trading stack. Trying to build a long term position and have enough in the tank to add even if we go to 9k+.

My best trades so far where shorts that i build over days or even weeks when i shorted from 11.7k to 9.2k and added all the time. 

Hope to repeat the success, scalping only costs me money, but long term trades work pretty well the last few weeks.
No shit
Someone mentioned that volume should also be analysed. A quick google search showed me this:
"Ideally, but not always, volume during the advance of the left shoulder should be higher than during the advance of the head. This decrease in volume and the new high of the head, together, serve as a warning sign. The next warning sign comes when volume increases on the decline from the peak of the head, then decreases during the advance of the right shoulder. Final confirmation comes when volume further increases during the decline of the right shoulder."
It's certainly lower than most would like it to fall, but it's far from unheard of. 

It happens on short timeframes and long timeframes.
I got out of NEO ages ago just so you know. Goodluck to you too. Nothing wrong with being Bearish. 
Perception is often not reality, and the dot com bubble was the reason the 90s boomed for a time.

Everything was collapsing in 1999-2000. This was the beginning of the dot com crash and Clinton's last two years. If Clinton gets credit for the boom then he needs to take blame for the downturn.

Lots of controversy about the surplus or balanced budget. Clinton did very little to influence this, and some say Gingrich was largely responsible- but the bottom line is, we began the century in a downturn and recession. 

https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/no-bill-clinton-didnt-balance-budget

Lastly, what do you think each of these presidents is doing differently from one another in terms of economics? They seem all the same to me. All of them increased spending, R's a little more than D's, but spending lots of money is something both parties love to do.

They all rely on the Federal Reserve to print up money out of thin air to pay for things.

They all left with a much higher deficit than when they started.

They all kept overall tax rates more or less the same as when they came to office.

The stock market boomed last year, partly because some were excited about Trump. Now, Trump is turning out to be just like every other president and it's dropping. Why does perception even matter? Nothing has changed since 07, Bush was doing a terrible job with the economy, and Obama just used the Fed to pump money in the markets to put of the Greater Recession that may in fact be starting now.


Practice is what will get you there. Keep posting.
The problem is that many people day traded in late 2017 and never put any aside and lost a lot, if not all of profits in 2018 yet they still owe the tax gains from 2017. Bad timing.

I've been in the game quite some bit so I still did quite well but was still down about 40% from January until I sold last month. 
Insulting someone who's asking for clarification: a real sign of confidence.

You said this price range has solid, pre-parabolic price history. I'm asking you when that was.
lol I think people upvoted your comment in earnest, so I responded earnestly, even if you *are* joking. I couldn't tell if you were personally joking either, as I'm sure others couldn't (because this has been said earnestly before)
cool.... so you do the same
Meh, imagine if you had listened to every bit of bad news from 2015-2017 and sold based on that information. Would have been a terrible move too
As opposed to trading with leverage in a low-liquidity / high variance market? 

I feel like you're putting words in my mouth, but regardless the political climate is pretty warm at the moment and looks warm for the foreseeable future.
You're funny. I like funny people.
I'm thinking we could run back to 7.2-7.3 before the next dumpening 
Thanks, and have fun. My wife would kill me if it spent my vacations day trading :)
The people that are holding with the hope that 6k was a double bottom. If it breaks it isnt looking good for them.
He's asking you a genuine question, though. I understand it's not exactly top level comment worthy considering this is bitcoin markets but your top comment *is* about alts. Just seems weird to say that in response to him asking you a genuine question about something pretty relevant, unless I'm missing some previous context here
Not sure how you get that. /u/Buttershine_Beta is saying that some people for simplicity look at one specific coin's ratio to stand in for a general "alts are overvalued compared to BTC" or "alts are undervalued compared to BTC" and is not suggesting to buy or sell any particular alt.
Wow are we fully in 1984 mode now where thought and speech that isn't about what **I** want it to be is "not what we do here"?  You talked about alts first for Christ's sake.  Is only shitting on alts allowed here?


I mean, Im a tech guy. I dont really care what people do... I dont care who wants LN to fail.

It is currently the only innovative thing in Crypto that provides new innovation.

Everything else is boring sauce
I’m an engineer

And you’re wasting my time, but here goes:

1. Doesn’t use Onion Routing, so no privacy preservation
2. Written in fucking Python (lol)
3. Does not use MAC based secret sharing
4. Does not use any encryption for routing to speak of
5. No breach arbiter, no utxo nursery, no deterministically derived preimages, no dick, no balls and no fire
6. Did an ICO, still not done
7. Can’t even just port the LN code
8. Routing is an utter mess and looks like a child wrote it
9. Where the fuck are the tests???
10. Not even close to functioning

I mean, compare this (literally three functions riddled with ToDos... I mean: TODO: Score routes... lol wut? The fucking path sum is a weight... better than having diddly squat)

https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden/blob/master/raiden/routing.py

to this

https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/tree/master/routing

And if you have some ETH shill arguments (I get them a lot, not judging... just syaing if you do), then just keep them to yourself. I’ll just trust my Master degrees
Not totally sure, here's a couple links I was looking at. Look's like it's around 7480?

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/ONPULxN4-Don-t-Let-A-Small-Bounce-Blind-You-BITCOIN-BTC/

Haha it's been very difficult at some points. $7.3k bounce to $9200 was rough and all the $9k fuckery was awful ($9.9k...) but after that it hasn't been so bad 

I actually set real stops for those two at $9350 and $10250 but neither ever hit. So I guess it's a combination of patience and great stops. I almost got stopped out yesterday at $7400 but I canceled the stop when I realized it would probably test $7.5k before going down 
Why? It's looking more likely than ever to fall through. I've pretty much sat through the worst of it, I think. Sure, btc could pull a crazy fakeout and burst upwards here but really, what looks most likely at this point?

I'm actually quite surprised it already fell through $7k again. That was incredibly quick
Despair already happened. We are literally at "here we go again" (whatever that would be).

I wasn't talking about max profit.  I was talking about "Shorting is less dangerous than going long."   That is the comment you responded to.
  
Lol at the guy coming me a moron who doesn't get 100% v infinite. It's you dumb dumb who has infinite potential loss. Your idiocy pains me bro
We're all in the same boat then ;)
I don't believe it but that doesn't mean I won't be trading what I see lol. 
> Yea we do hate it , but we can't do shit about it

So like any country then.

Some just have different way so of hiding it. In the West corruption has been formalised over centuries. We accept it so much that "*Perceived* corruption" is really low. It's all lawful and codified.
"Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to Kommersant, is planning a major overhaul of the country’s security services. The Russian daily reported that the idea of the reforms is to merge the Foreign Intelligence Service, or SVR, with the Federal Security Service, or FSB, which keeps an eye on domestic affairs. This new supersized secret service will be given a new name: the Ministry of State Security."

http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/09/21/putin-has-finally-reincarnated-the-kgb-mgb-fsb-russia/

I dunno if that plan ever went though, but it doesn't sound good.
You mean, it would make more sense for me to close out in a massive loss and then try to chase a better re-entry for a little better ROE at the end (assuming I time everything perfectly)? 

You're not a very smart trader my man.

He was stupid to do that, you're stupid to do 'haha, I was right'.
good luck.

Opened a hedge at 7300 and got stops at 7600 (mark)
/s ?
Ok, now I don't know if you're kidding...

Well, TBH I'm here a bit longer, not a holder and still on a good profit by trading.

And you must admit that your trade was risky as f and you wouldn't recommend it to anybody. And that's only reason why I commented it. A lot of noobs here try to copy those moves and get rekt by this...
even just looking at the last few days we've closed the daily candle lower with a higher rsi.
Yes, I thought he was talking about more recent bull divs. I believe both those bull divs played out already with the rise to 7.5k (and that daily one you mentioned is about as slight as it could get lol).
"Bull divs don't matter when it helps my bias" FTFY, of course they matter.  Technicals don't change, not sure what chart you're watching for volume.   Take the short goggles off, not good for trading.
lord?
That's only $60k. Who doesn't have $60k to throw at crypto right now?
Yeah ok, just 20x, that’s nothing.  Something I think people fail to understand is each time it compounds it will be much harder to compound again.  To get another 20x any time soon we need to dump more.  20x took a year for bitcoin.  It didn’t take as long for alts because much less money was required to drive them to such ridiculous heights.  In bitcoins past it has 20x many times I’m sure but now?  Say it happens and we see $140k btc.  Will there be another person like you who says well we just need another 20x?  Eventually there will not be stupid compounding.  Maybe we are not there yet, maybe we are.  Right now more bitcoin is being dumped to the market than people want to buy at the current price.  
$50k in btc isn't exactly trivial for most people
He's been shorting for a while now.

This guy has no concept of 0 or infinity. Seriously my mind is blown by him. 
Of course you're correct but clearly any talk of margin shorting views profit and loss in BTC terms. 

+ MY COMMENT WAS TONGUE IN CHEEK. 

This guy started arguing with me like his entire universe was cast into doubt by my comment. 
J, Any thoughts on the upcoming ETH Death Cross (April 9th) and what, if any, effect it might have on the whole market? (cripple too on the same day)
Like, a lot. Maybe. Maybe it's not.

lol

super lemon haze in my grow room

no freezer tho

baguette 🥖 is a dime a dozen here :)
Yeah I know was a bit 'rushed' as I had other techniques of verification but they were not instant like reading the reply. Plus I'm not sure of it immediately returns error on market order.. I will dig into it.    Edit.. yep i see the sys overloaded msg come back ok still in the end it doesnt change much, too unstable.
Lately I have been trying not to over trade and let it ride on longer timeframes over night, I do more short-term trading during the day. 
Because I was being patient while in profit! I usually take profits too quickly...$100 move here, $100 move there, then look back and realize I got $200 out of a $1,000 move up. Wanted to break that habit and actually sit on a long for a while since I thought (and still think) these levels are too low.

I actually took profits at the very top of that first big move up, just shy of $7.4k. But I re-bought $7.4k when it broke back up there. I was targeting $7.8k on the low side and maybe mid 8's on the high side. I actually considered selling some at $7.5k but I was out of the house at the time and I hate trading on mobile, it always rekts me...plus I figured, stop scalping the $100 moves and be patient! Let it ride for a few days since I'm well in the green.

After the rising wedge broke, I figured fine, I can deal with a retrace. A lot of times movement like that can seem super bearish for a few hours, but then consolidate and retest the highs before you can get back in, and before you know it its higher than when you sold. So yeah, for each leg down I figured that sucks, but it's expected and that's probably the last of it, so why sell now? Well, you know how that goes.

Anyway, I'm still being patient.
Oh that's so cool. Good to know, thanks.
I got liquidated on my position 3 times already but it's just my fun stack, very small % of trading stack.

If you bought early it doesn't mean you know how to trade, it just means you bought before the hype.
Exactly, it was a hedge, meant to protect stack and be closed at be.
As far as I'm concerned, a H&S is nothing more than a bull flag/bull flag/bear flag/bear flag combo lol

Part of why I don't bother charting them. They're not tradeable until they're 75% completed, and at that point you're basically just shorting a bear flag. 
I have a pretty meager position right now. I got rekt on a short from $7K, stopped out at 7300, which hurt. I have a long from 6510 right now on June futures, and yesterday I shorted swaps (same weight as the long) from 7490 to 7330. Now I have a new short (same weight as the long) at 7150. I've basically frozen my unrealized gains on the long as of 7150.

My plan is to close the long if $7K breaks and ride the short down, 
You're right, it should be, but BTC very rarely does textbook h&s patterns.
Ok thanks for your response. I won’t  ( will try not to) worry for a few more  $‘000  downwards then. Cheers. 
[removed]
Sorry, dude. You're confused. Probably my fault. You said:

>  people will blame "capitalism" and "the free market" even though that couldn't be further from the truth of why the economy sucks.

Aren't you implying people will blame Trump and the republicans for a market crash? Aren't you implying this is a perception problem? Or did I get this wrong?

So I thought I made a comment agreeing with you, adding that a lot of people are gaining positive perceptions of democrat presidents for the same reason: the economy improved during the Clinton and Obama years. And I said "I'm not going to attribute any credit" because I though we we're speaking about perception because of your comment.

Then you said:

> Perception is often not reality

Yeah, no kidding... Isn't that the point? 

>  Why does perception even matter?

Because voters vote overwhelming based on perception....  (I thought this was the entire point of your comment. That we'll end up with socialism because voters vote based on perception, not reality.)


dude, stop asking questions you already know the answer to!  seriously though, people just want to have hope(understandably), and saying things to the contrary can suck.  I remember watching my btc fiat value slowly decline for all of 2014/15 and it was devastating.  
Insulting? Jeez you must be easily insulted 😬 ok, ok... how about *more solid than the the parabolic trend? 
whataboutery
It was quite painful to watch the news in that period. However no news came close to any real danger to the operation of Bitcoin. Except for the 1m blocksize problem being brought up,  played out in full and then finally getting fixed. 

But there were a lot of other things going on to keep your Bitcoin. If something really bad would have happened to the technology and no fix was in sight, I would have sold quite fast. 
Yes if you were stupid enough to just trade off of news and not the chart and momentum and technical factors, then that would be a bad move.
Me too i love Moonboys
Yea I already closed that long for small profit and am back short 7.7 the chip is makin me nervous af
but this support right around 6.6 idk maybe i oughta bail
closed that short and went long at 6.5, lmao it couldnt even reach 7k i might look to close this sketchy long at 6.7,  small scalp
Your talking about traders then, most people holding bitcoin don't know what the fuck a double bottom is. Most bag holders that are selling have sold. 
Yea I'm equally confused lol. Actually burst out laughing at his response. Nothing against Jarederaj, I think he just misinterpreted the question and/or is a bit annoyed about the reception his post above received.
Also, I saw no question.
There's a larger internal discussion I'm having about this. We don't have a rubric for determining what is and isn't off topic when it comes to alts, but I think we need one. This is supposed to be a place that's focused on bitcoin markets. A lot of things relate and are important. Other things are opportunistic and loosely relevant.

Put it another way. Are teachers trying to change hearts or create more articulate bigots? I come down on the side of more articulate bigots. If you've come here to talk about your alt, you need to at least talk the talk even if you don't care for Bitcoin.
> Swing trading between BTC to alts could effectively be done based on the Doge BTC ratio.

Thanks for clarifying for me. I wasn't attempting to shill just wanted to know what Jared's thoughts were.

Really? LN excite you at this point? Raiden on ethereum is pretty close to this, you can see far greater innovation with sharding, plasma chains, plasma cash, Casper ffg-cbc... That's only for ethereum... As a tech guy, those solutions excite me way more than payment channel which cover "few" usecase only.. 
(2. response) To be fair python is not the hang up, fk it could have been written in lisp and still work. Python has often been more acceptable in many enterprise applications, forgoing the fact it also is the baby duck language of many. But then again if the language is one of your top level arguments that is barrel scraping and you know it.

Oh, really?  That easy, right?

Tell me, how does one score a path without being forced to know everything about every path in the network?

Maybe instead of smoking privacy hopium, they're focused on solving problems at real world scales?
Yeah I have my 38.2% drawn at exactly 7,491 so that's pretty close.
Sounds like a 1 in a Million trade. Very good entry, perfect stops and strong hands. 

10/10 would be an honor to short with you again :D
I'm afraid you'll wait through drop to 1k and close it when it hits 15k again :-P
Where did I say I "investing based on what CENTRA or whatever is doing"?

What are you talking about?
Bro you serious?

If you short at 1$ and cover at 0$ how much profit do you have? 

Just think before exposing your low intelligence trying to refute an obvious tongue in cheek comment. 
Holy moly man.... read up on what shorting is.

If I sell 1BTC at 1 usd

and then buy back at 0.01 USD

what’s my profit in terms of BTC?

10000%

And if I borrowed 1 BTC that I sold at 1 usd and covered my naked short at 0.01 USD

What’s my profit then?

Infinite, because my initial “investment” is 0, and I now have 99 BTC
Yep
You should close it when 7k broke and reevaluate. This way you could lose it all. That way you were just lucky it bounced from 7.5.

Maybe I'm not smart but still on heavy profits.
Yes.
I mentioned that in my previous post. It's way too early to call that because it may not actually be a low depending on how the next candle goes.
Check OBV, some there, def on the daily, not at home but saw a couple on short time frames.
I literally just showed you a chart where it didn't matter. TA isn't the be all end all of market movement. Divergences can occur and be relatively benign- especially when hidden divergences occur at the same time (which they have been). The bull div isn't even large. It's actually tiny. 

I like my "short goggles" on because they've allowed me to ignore all of the bullshit posted here by people who have no idea what they're talking about.

I've had people tell me I'm biased and too bearish since $11.7k. Not about to let it get to me. People here have no idea what they're talking about. I said the bubble popped on the day we dumped from $16k and people made fun of me and said "how long have you been here?"

Yes, I understand this *could* be the reversal. But when you take a step back and look at this all objectively, there's really not a great case for why this is suddenly going to moon. 

*alllll* that aside, my point was that a bull div doesn't matter when no one's buying. I really just meant that it would only lead to a small reprieve in selling and that the selling would resume after a small correction. 

There were *tons* of bear divs on the way up from $1k that could've looked like the top. But there were no **clear** bearish signals like the melt-up and blow off top. There's no reason to assume this is the bottom when there haven't been any clear bullish signals like that. 

The primary reason people are bullish here is because they *want* btc to moon, not because the charts or fundamentals are saying it's going to. I'd love nothing more than some free money again. Another bull run will make me way more money than shorting does. I just don't see why it'd happen here
lord punish those those who shorted the head and shoulders
Not sure. Some of us? Hate to tell you, but - well - there are some of us saving that in half a year.

Also, this is $60k NOW - there are some of us who bought a lot more than 9BTC some time ago when it was cheaper.
if you had that many already because you had held if for the last 4 years....
did you think 3 years ago $19,000 was plausible? is it less plausible than $100,000 now?
it was worth only $3k a short time ago...
yeah, if you count PnL in BTC, you are correct
Wrong sub.

On web it returns immediately when it's overloaded, it takes time if it goes into a queue and gonna execute.

I know they're overloaded, but they did their best to minimize damage done by it.
I got liquidated as an experiment in using a liq point as a hard stop loss.  You can customize your margin to set the point, and it seemed more reliable than stop market slippage.  But meh, haven't done that again.
yeah, thats a good point :) I got greedy
Even 75% is not good. Saw one that bounced from neckline.

If this has neckline at 7 then no matter if it's legit, we're gonna go down if 7 breaks.
Interesting setup and plan sounds good. I wish you good luck, and as always: Keep the post coming, great content.
I've closed my 6.6 CA long today to lessen the blow from getting stopped out violently on another scalp long today.

Currently riding a short also, and setup new limits to build a new long between 7k and 5k on september futs.
Just reported you.
I see what you're saying. Here's my point:

All presidents are economically clueless, and they get way too much blame and credit for what happens to the economy.

In Trump's case, he has done some really stupid things like insist on tariffs. So his cluelessness led him to a really stupid decision. This is not perception, it's reality. 

Clinton, Bush, Obama all went along with the status quo, the things I mentioned earlier. This has led to the shaky economy we're in now. 

The perception is that Bush fucked things up and Obama was great, but this is not the reality. 

They were both essentially doing the same things.

So therefore, since perception is not reality, why does it matter if someone thinks "Obama was a great president and did wonders for the economy" or "Trump just got elected and is going to do great things for the economy" ?
You still didn't answer my question.
Let's play a game called "that time someone said Bitcoin was dead and it actually was"; you go first.
Goodluck homie
Might be a little of both.

> When doge is over 100 SATs you sell alts for btc. When doge is below 25 SATs you buy alts with btc. Search: "bitcoin cycle"

Still sounds like shilling to me.
Ah, that's true, but the "hey jared" made me think otherwise. I read the "search: bitcoin cycle" part as "here's evidence of what I'm talking about in case you decide to look into it". I guess the comment is confusing
You could just ignore his comment, no need to say "this isn't what we do here" imo, because it could come off very confusing to someone who sees an opportunity to discuss alts without disrupting/clogging the normal daily discourse. 

I was mainly confused because it sounded like he was asking in deference to your opinion- as in he respected it and wanted to know what you had to say about it. 
> what is and isn't off topic when it comes to alts, but I think we need one.

Just please don't let this slip into /r/bitcoin level control on that point
Sincerely, apologies if it seemed like I was shilling.
where is plasma?

where is sharding?

Show me one line of code... just one

Casper is meh... old news boring sauce byzantine authenticated agreement

If you were a tech guy, you would understand that it’s not about payment channels.... so Imma go out on a limb and say you’re not...

Just leave me alone with your ETH shill bullshit. I’ve seen you guys come and go... I’m still here

lol @ plasma cash

And plasma is just treechains regurgitated by Poon... it’s weak at best
But statically typed would be more maintainable for a code base that is supposed to scale a blockchain.

Go, C, Java, Scala etc would have all been better options...

But it’s cool, since I know the clowns at Raiden can’t code in anything but Python

I’m just saying that writing something as important as Raiden in Python when the client is written in Go is just laughable

I also brought plenty (9) of other arguments... You must be an ETH fan
You can defend Ethereum and Raiden all you want. But like I said... I’ll trust my Master’s degrees in the meantime
They’re not

Look at the code base... it’s garbage

And you can score paths without knowing the entire graph. Num hops is one possible score, total fees is another, total capacity along the way is another.

Raiden and the entire Ethereum community are laughable amateurs that have yet to produce a single productive code base worth a damn... outside of geth... I actually like geth
I took swing high from the last viable daily candle, it was 9k. My 38.8 is on 7480: https://www.tradingview.com/x/oCNRf913/


I expected us to come to 7800 maybe, but this could be the last bulls effort before another drop. If BTC manages to rise above 7800 and 8100 that is good for mid term bulls.


I am still very long term bearish, I really feel like this bubble is going to pop harder and that many of the people will be surprised when we drop harder.
Lmao no I am planning on closing it somewhere between $4-6k

The reward of closing it any lower than that simply isn't worth my time. I would need to add to the position for it to be worth it considering if it gets that low it will take significant time to move it lower
[deleted]
I just did the math for him
[deleted]
you can never be too sure these days
You hate to tell me? That's cool, but I actually did put $75k into crypto last year (earlier than later), and $15k more so far this year.
this argument is terrible. I'm not surprised a moonkid has a tenuous grasp on reality
Well I guess you don’t understand economics.  See there is only so much wealth in the world.  100k is 5x the market cap of 19k.  Now there will also be more coins if it even does hit 100k so that will make the market cap even higher.  I’m not saying it can’t happen but each multiple becomes less and less likely due to sheer economics.  We will see.  I only put in what I’m willing to lose which isn’t much, but sure I’ll be happy to dump whatever bitcoin I have when we hit 100k.  Be it a whole coin or a fraction.  I plan to never completely exit or completely go all in with my available funds.  Play safe.
no I mean putting $50,000 into btc. 
No. What are you’re thoughts about if it will pull down on BTC ?
[deleted]
Next time open 1.5x and close the 0.5 when you get greedy
I'm debating closing my long here at 7100, but I hate giving up that 6510 entry. Still, closing it at 74xx yesterday should have been a no-brainer. A retest of 7200 was nearly a given. Granted, I did short 7495-7330, so at least there's that. Oh well.
Cool story.  This isn’t Facebook dork.  
Nor did you 
thanks bro this bih aint moving tho
i just closed dat long ass long man i feel like maybe a bit early here but waiting on longs makes me nervous in this climate, wouldnt be surprised if this reaches 7k tho
im back short 6.8k with the gang gang
It sounds like he's asking a question about your opinion on the best time to trade alts, really
Yeah, and I reported it, so I felt like they deserved an explanation. I wasn't fucking with the guy. I like him... just seemed like it qualified as shilling. I really didn't want to report that shit.
I actually debated this. I do like the user who I responded to, but I also reported them and I felt compelled to offer them an explanation in as friendly a way as I could think to do it.

It wasn't clear to me that it was a question, a baiting question, or straight up shilling. The ambiguity is what I found disturbing.
I think the issue there was that they never developed a rubric and were unable to enforce a consistent standard that the community was then able to enforce for the mods.

I think I'm making it clear that I want to see more communication and less banning.
I thought it was a nuanced example of shilling. I was genuinely curious about the various perspectives and was trying to get to the bottom of these other perspectives. I know for a fact that you're not a shill. This is more a case of a friend telling his buddy that his fly is down and then the whole sub got involved and opinionated about the position of your fly.

Whatever, I just want you to go out and get laid. Zip that shit up.
All right then, let's trust your awesome degree and forget the stupidity of saying LN is the only interesting innovation in the space right now... 

You realize how insane this statement sound right? 
No just someone who has years of experience on top of masters degrees. Unfortunately that experience came with a free drinking habit & anti depressants. Trust me there are dragons in your favourite languages as well. It really is not the language or the typing that ensures a maintainable or working code base.

(edit: ETH fans, like fans of anything are those who has lost all ability to critically evaluate without bias. I am a fan of very few things, and only those which have absolutely no influence on financial state. I have equal amounts of hate for all languages as in a senior role across multiple clients I have been in the position of cleaning shit with most of them.)
Both of those ideas are easily exploitable by attack vectors.

I'll give the LN team credit for one thing... LN is surprisingly resilient against many attack vectors I've looked into.  But that same resiliency plus the privacy makes it almost impossible to scale without ruining trustlessness or privacy.

And that's kind of a problem.
Here is where we are in agreement. The code, approach, QA and management is garbage. But even garbage code works enough that most users can be oblivious of the fact so long as they get what they want & don't look beneath the box, (most enterprise devs rely on & can attest to this).
If you think that is the only "indicator" that this bubble is far from done popping, I have some great altcoins to sell you. Buy the dip!
I understand, you were lucky and profitable, still this is not how you should trade. This could go up to 8k before bounce.
Nice. Good for you. Similar here.
I didn't throw $60k at crypto - subtantially less. I have more than 9 BTC.

There is no argument. There is no discussion. It's a fact.
I love when people condescendingly make the stupidest arguments.






right...but if you had held for the last 3 years you'd be fine.
It's less than 15% of the market cap now. It has less pull than it has had in a long time. ERC20 tokens are more relevant.
 > 24!

24! = 6.204484017332394e+23


[deleted]
that’s what I’ve been thinking lately.

Just always have a short open (since Im up anyways) and trade longs on swaps to gain exposure
> but I hate giving up that 6510 entry.

I felt the same way, then about an hour ago I realized that I was guilty of getting "married to my position".  I had the feeling I should have closed it at 7.3, then 7.5, then again 7.3, but wanted to keep that entry so bad.  Glad I didn't miss selling it at 7.1 now that we are sub 6.9.

I already lost out on my previous two trades.  The n-1 was a total failure of risk management on the market orders that scaled it out, slippage made it all pointless, they all executed at the same fucking bottom price.  At least the n-1 trade was minimal loss. 
So, wasn't about to let that long go to waste, again, when one of it's purposes was to defend the other trades.

Feeling similar regret about the no-brainer.  But hey, good on you for that scalp short!

You didn't ask me any questions. Your inability to answer a simple question regarding your own statement speaks volumes.
My first sell got filled at 6890. Not sure if I should move my other sells up or just keep em scattered all the way to 7.2 
As we discussed, what was being communicated was ambiguous and had no question.
Not a problem buddy. I don't fault you for being wary either.
where is sharding? where is plasma? where is iota? where is any of it???

Point me in the direction of one line of code. And the iota github repo is a joke, somlets ignore that one...

I never said trust me... I said Ill trust my degress. This is Crypto... you dont trust anyone... n00b

Also... degrees... plural
I agree with that, but having worked on big legacy python projects in the past, it would just be nice to know what the fuck a function is returning without having to read the function body

In fact, Python is my favorite language :) I use Cython a lot though
There is no attack vector when scoring paths... What, you route your payments along the same route every time? Who cares? Then those nodes will get more fees... Given a distributed network topology, this wouldn’t happen much anyways unless the same people were paying each other over and over again.

Also, the argument was that Raiden sucks... and it does... it is absolute horse shit
I agree. But the question was why Raiden is inferior to LN, not just how shitty Raiden actually is
I've been trading for 10+ years.
The amount traded on bitmex in the form of a short served as a calculated hedge to my portfolio holdings.  If it got liquidated, my portfolio beta would still be lower than had I not hedged.  

Thanks for your advice, though.

Haha simple claim that each time something compounds it is less likely to compound again is a stupid argument?  You do understand nothing can go up forever yes?  Certainly you understand this.  I want crypto to go dominate the planet but I don’t expect it and can easily see it go either way.  Get out of the bubble and look at other perspectives.  I’m glad I did.  I was in there too.
I don't know about that. I'd say keeping hedge open until be isn't so stupid and just trade other contracts, just don't let it too much underwater and you should be fine.

I have other problem. Always starting with too low lev, don't add later or add on bad place and end with no profits or small profits :-\
Just made a top level post. I actually got a divorce as well and closed that sucker on the bounce to 7100 (7050 was the futs price at close).
Alrighty then 
I’ll double up at 7.2 for sure But im not sure it’ll reach it, maybe I’ll add a small amount at 7k
Sure there is... Unless you are the one scoring the paths, which means you have to know the state of the entire global network.  And if you must know the entire state of the global network constantly aka a broadcast network... You can't scale to millions or billions.

Of course someone else could let you know a partial path state.  But you can't verify it because of the privacy of onion routing.  So they can lie to you.  Badly.

Surely you've considered these problems?
Irrelevant, most users & retailers only see a front end. In this sub sentiment has more influence than algorithmic grace. While a critical specialised review of both would be useful it would not affect the main usage. Raiden may just be inferior because it commands less market presence. It does not matter the actual qualities either has as the measure of their success is graded on adoption & usage.
Your move was ballsy, I admit, you're experienced enough to know that's not how you should trade and not how you should recommend trading even though it worked out.
do you think 21 million x $100k is anywhere near the limit of the wealth in the world? it's about the GDP of France. Or California.

And there won't be 21 million coins in circulation.

100k/coin is not that much, if you believe bitcoin will capture a significant portion of global commerce.

but yeah. snidely and condescendingly talk about compounding growth without thinking about real numbers and what they mean.


Nice fucking timing on that save!  Really lucky! (futs can really bounce around sometimes) I had closed mine at 7109 (futs price)!
The only way they can lie tonyou badly is via a sybil attack, and since LN costs money (you need to lock funds into a channel), this is a non-issue.

Also, everyone scores their own paths.

Any sufficiently dense subgraph of the channel graph woll do. Since I will be connected to various nodes, I can always use authenticated agreement to determine what subgraph to use. As long as less than 1/3 of my peers are byzantine, Im fine.

You are simply bringing up issues that exist in any distributed system/network
When it comes to scaling a distributed system, I disagree with you.

I doubt Raiden will be as user friendly as LN

But I also believe Raiden will never see the light of day
Ok, you can value bitcoin then buy it up and hodl and be rich.  Good luck.
They can lie to you about the parts of the network you don't know about.  If you want to verify it, you have to more about it.  They don't even have to Sybil, they can straight up make shit up if you break the broadcast network assumption.

The subgraph idea breaks down if your neighbor doesn't verify the whole network, which of course they do not want to do either, especially not for free.
Consider that there is time and certainly large investment so a project called Raiden will bubble up out of the either. LN has many issue could meet user expectations, god bless those users with their 'quick to adopt and easy to ignore bugs' attitude.
This is incorrect...

You piece together the subgraph from
multiple peers and then add channels that have been verified by multiple parties... Also... you know... you can check the blockchain to see if a particular channel exists...

There are also many ideas to innovate the channel gossip protocol to allow everyone to securely compute the channel graph... at which point all this becomes completely irrelevant because you can not cheat

Im gonna go out on a limb here and tell you to stop looking for holes in LN. the devs working on it are better than you or I. They are expert Cryptographers and they have thought about everything you will ever think about last year, or even earlier. You’re honestly pissing in the wind IMHO
> Im gonna go out on a limb here and tell you to stop looking for holes in LN

Lol

> the devs working on it are better than you or I. They are expert Cryptographers

At cryptography?  Sure.  At designing, building, and maintaining large multi-billion request systems? HAHAHAHAHAHA

First they have to be able to go outside so they can understand how normal non-technical users operate.  Then maybe they could design a system that isn't terrible, and maybe they will someday be able to learn what it takes to operate at those scales.

>  and they have thought about everything you will ever think about last year, or even earlier. 

Except, you know a routing system for a million plus nodes.  They kind of forgot that one.  But hey, they'll never have to worry about that if their awful usability problems prevent the system from ever getting anywhere near that many users!

> Also... you know... you can check the blockchain to see if a particular channel exists...

Right, which totally isn't a problem when you have ten million channels that change states every second...
I don’t get you sometimes.

But oh well...

checking the blockchain is not an issue even if you have ten million channels that change states every second, because channels can only close every block.

I’m sure you are great at buulding HA systems, but LN has nothing to do with client/server architecture (except for the rpc server), since its a p2p client that piggy backs bitcoin...

The name of the game is Cryptography

And also, many of the LN devs worked on HA scalable distributed systems, and they have plenty of experience.

They are also very conscious about usability

Moreover... once again... read the fucking flare paper before you talk about routing...
> And also, many of the LN devs worked on HA scalable distributed systems, and they have plenty of experience.

Source?

> They are also very conscious about usability

You can't be paid until you've spent money

You can't be paid if you go offline

You can lose money if you go offline unless you have multiple watchtowers

Your payments may randomly fail for no apparent reason

If your payment can't route for no apparent reason, the only thing you can do about it is to pay one or even two high fees(again, high by design) to get your payment sent.  This isn't predictable

Your payment may get stuck for days if an attacker decides to do so; there is no cost for them to do this.

If you lose your database you will lose money unless you wait until someone you don't know unilaterally closes the channel

You have to spend high fees(by design) to even be able to use the network, and again to get your money out

A new user has to pay the fee for closure even if it's their channel partner who desires closing the channel

Yeah, it's pretty clear that they thought about usability...

> read the fucking flare paper before you talk about routing...

There's nothing in the paper about routing beyond straight broadcast, and they barely even talk about that.  What page are you even talking about?  Go find it, I don't think we read the same paper.

> I don’t get you sometimes.

Getting banned, ostracized and attacked just because you disagree about a major economic decision has consequences.  Sorry, I will never again support any of cores nonsense.  Treating people the way they have for the last 3 years is a one way ticket to creating enemies for life.  And they've made thousands.
These are valid points, all of which are being worked on, but here’s the question:

What are the clowns at ethereum doing?

Nothing

I’ll find the routing part and get back to you

Eh, I don't know.  I honestly don't watch Ethereum too closely.  I can say this though... What Vitalik says with regards to scaling plans, economics, game theory, and ecosystem design... Echoes what I have come to believe in 100%.  BCH isn't going to cut it.  Does that mean Ethereum can or will deliver?  No idea.  Just means Vitalik has his head screwed on straight and he can see the problems and the solutions
Let me know about the paper.  I misread, thought you meant LN paper.  Still, finding some real routing plans would address many of my fears for lightning, so let me know.
Ok, I agree with that... I think he is good at providing vision, though generally not grounded with technical feasibility in any manageable amount of time
Flate paper written by roasbeef and bitfury

Thanks.  Reading and thinking about this.  I'm trying to find something in the LN documentation about how balance updates are sent so I can check some ideas.
FYI while investigating I found one way this paper already breaks down.

LN doesn't route with knowledge of channel states - More accurately, it cannot do so, as that would expose information that could expose payment routes.

LN attempts to route with feerate/ctlv information alone.  I.e., the mapping of the network is already the "hybrid" as described there, but the reactive part is literally just failed payment sends that get unwound.  Those can become tied up for the ctlv duration, about 2 hours per hop.  In other words, the reactive part of its routing is already in place, but it is guess and check with potentially long durations on the guess and check portion.  It cannot gather information about the state of the network to select a route more likely work, all it can do is to keep guessing and checking new routes, or give up and go onchain.

I haven't wrapped my head around the implications of this yet, it'll be a few days before I can.  Didn't know that before though, and definitely interesting.
