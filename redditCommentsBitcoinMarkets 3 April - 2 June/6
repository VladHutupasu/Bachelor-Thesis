[Daily Discussion] Monday, May 28, 2018 -- TITLE
#New post: [\[Daily Discussion\] Tuesday, May 29, 2018 →](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8mw5vt/daily_discussion_tuesday_may_29_2018/)
I closed my $7520 short here at $7110.  I think this is a good time to wait a bit and see what the market wants to do as we touch down on the resistance line in the [large pennant drawn on the daily](https://www.tradingview.com/x/sC1UES8z/).  

Buyers still seem weak, but we've touched down now on 30 on 1D RSI after a long sell off which presents the opportunity for a turn around.  We may see an attempt at a reversal if the line holds but won't know for a few days \(assuming it holds\).  If we break below the pennant, I don't believe bulls should expect lower supports to hold long term.  This pennant formation dates all the way back to mid Jan and so breaking below would signal a slow bleed back to the historic log line over the course of several months.  [Something like this. ](https://www.tradingview.com/x/8ZqjuG10/)

In the event of a break below the line, I believe we'll see another capitulation event which will take price somewhere between $4900\-$5500 based on fib retracements.  Selling will accelerate if/when $6k breaks.  If this plays out, there will be some good opportunities to profit on the upside as these capitulation events tend to rebound rather aggressively over the course of 8\-10 days based on historic trends.

In my view this is really the make or break moment for buyers to step in and reestablish a new trend.  
ETH shorts going parabolic to ATH levels. I think the max low price range is 420-450 which is not so far, and if this starts to squeeze it could bring up the whole market to a bounce https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BITFINEX:ETHUSDSHORTS
I guess eating out of garbage cans isn't too bad, people throw away perfectly good used sandwiches
We all talk about RSI is so oversold etc pp. But on the bull run, you can see where these values can go. The 3D RSI went six times above 80, three times above 89 and one time to 93. The 1W RSI went two times to 90. The 1D RSI went to 94. etc.
We dropped another box last night, hitting a low of $7,180.

While PnF charts do not normally concern themselves with volume, I think its worthy to note that volume has sucked.  I don’t know if its the holiday weekend in the US or if people are just “exhausted.”  The exhausted part would make sense based on where we are in the cycle.

Personally moved my “trading” coins to cash over the weekend.  The target price for moving back up is over the deep red line, changing resistance to support.  My ice cold coins remain in storage.  

The first target for this decline is around $7,050 which is the “width of the formation” count from the break down.  The formation is only four columns wide, so this is pretty tame.  The second target is down before the next possible line of support \(the dotted line across from a previous low\) and that is the count of the last breakdown.  That was twenty or so boxes down on that column.  That price target now would be $6,030.

The volume simple doesn’t exist right now for anything but a slow burn.  The good news is that I am not seeing the omnipresent 50 coin sell order that has been common over the past several weeks.

Instead of draining value of a couple thousand a day, I will tread water and skim a little off the cash to move to other assets.  Gold is looking pretty sweet these days.  I am selling off my small stock portfolio as well—I think stocks are the only asset that looks worse than crypto at this point.  

If my alt coins were not such a pain in the ass to sell, they would have been gone long ago—but what is the worst that could happen?  They could go to zero?  In my mind they already are.

I'm being lazy atm because I just woke up so no charts atm(fell asleep at the wheel on Bitmex, fortunately no crazy price movements while I was asleep.).  I sold my short and went long when we temporarily broke $7200 (short entry was $7340 (my entry was premature so I couldn't really add too much when it climbed before dumping), closed out and went long at roughly $7170).  I think we are going to follow the same pattern we have been in the last 4 days or so where we break through a support, rise back up $100 - $200 and then plummet again.  I think this next time will likely be the one that gets us to $7k or lower.  I have sell orders to close out my scalp/start entering short on the way to $7300 while leaving some dry powder to add to the short if it climbs higher when I am back awake and trading. Just to add, I will be shorting a smaller position when I enter my short than I did today because I think there is a higher chance that we will actually break to the upside than previously.
any chance we'll break 7k?
Long weekend so not really doing anything today either but been thinking about my action plan for the 7200-6800.

Plan A (currently in action): Buy the dip for cold storage (got plenty of cash on sidelines) and scale longs in the green box (7200-6800) with a stop at pink line (6543). 1/4 longs already filled. Gonna start scaling out around 8700-8900.

Not thought about what happens past 6500 but RSI would be so oversold that we'd need a bounce somewhere at least short term.


Plan B: A lot more risky but the potential return could be pretty great too. Plan A evolves around like 2 weeks upside to top of the triangle and a possible break out. alts have recently been following the direction of btc with amplified % moves. So if im betting on 2 weeks of btc upside, why not find some shitcoins that have events in the next two/three weeks (hype) and see how it goes. jump back to btc around top of triangle and re-evaluate. stop losses could just be btc breaking pink line.

Deffo a lot more risky but its not completely crazy right?


Ref: https://www.tradingview.com/x/FK9gDxKj/
Shorts increased significantly at finex. Risky move? Or do they now something?

Did anyone here ever quit their job to trade? Did your performance improve or get worse? A bit afraid if I do this full time Ill just end up overtrading all day
I might've missed it but BTC is holding up like a champ whilst eth/bch/ltc are shitting the bed. Is any of this news related?

We're still in our wedge/channel going down so I'm not too concerned with BTC's movement but the others are totally crapping the bed, which has me a little on edge. (ltc is back at April bottom) Btc orderbooks quite thin, low volume, sporadic volatility, everything's still looking pretty similar to before. From here I only see 2 possibilities. We're in an accumulation zone, or we're in a slow-bleed. Personally, I'm not going long here as I'd rather wait till we hit the bottom of the pennant.

edit: grammar --> too hungover to make sense apparently. 
bfx ask side is insanely thin- 3200 btc moves the price down $200 and up $1000

3200 btc to $7k

3200 btc to $8.2k...


I've actually never seen the ask side so thin before. there isn't 500 btc for any $100 spread...

5200 to $6700

5200 to $9600 lol
It's been an interesting weekend. I'm going to be watching the market closely today, as this is the best candidate for a significant technical bounce we're going to get. I'm still holding short on June futures from 8310, and I have another scalp short open from 7380 on swaps. That one I'll be closing on a dip below 7200 (missed this morning). BullMEX is hanging on for dear life again, so even though BFX broke 7200 just a few minutes back, swaps didn't hit my target. 

Our downtrend line from 10K continues to act as resistance/downward pressure. We are beginning to form a bit of a falling wedge, and we're just above long term support of our previous lows. If we're going to bounce hard enough to break the downtrend line, I expect it to come somewhere between 7050-7150. I'm a bit salty that futures are still at a premium on MEX, because I was hoping to snag some juicy 68xx entries on sept off of a 7K swaps bounce.

I've now hit my first major trading gain milestone, so a big part of me wants to close my positions and take a couple days off. I've held this short for about 7 days, which is more like a month in standard markets. My three targets for my main short were 7800, 7500, and 7250. The market still feels like it could leg down again here, so I'm holding it for now. If 7200 falls with conviction, I'll probably be setting stops just under 7300. For now, I've been sliding stops along a buffer zone over the descending resistance line. 

Good luck all.

This is just good r/r point for a scalp trade, support at 7050

Weekly BBands are still contracting. We're not at historic lows, but we are on our way.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/y4ehjqVC/

The opaque green lines highlight price action when bitcoin has had low weekly BBand width past.

The neon green lines show weeks when BBand width drops to our current level from a previously volatile period.
the cycle of bulls and bears is hilarious , for a few months you have bulls saying how bitcoin is going to keep mooning to 1 million and next you have  some months where bears keep saying how we're going to drop to 1k$. Don't get over confident , multiple bulls got rekt hard due to over confidence but the same can happen to bears if you're not careful so trade wisely and don't over leverage :)
We're now at 120k subscribers to this sub, we were at 100k end of december. This increase during a 'bearmarket' ain't bad, more and more people are picking up on crypto.

In my opinion, the next bull cycle will dwarf the previous one, but first Bitcoin has to be 'forgotten' for a while by the public.

What I mean is, the years before I bought my first BTC (1.5 years ago) it dawned on me that I always took intrest in it when it was hyped, I followed it for a few weeks, thought I missed the boat, back off, rinse and repeat.

It took a few of those cycles before I hopped on. So I think the number people hopping on keeps increasing each cycle.

I'm not sure why after all these years, we've seen the last bullcycle. Long term I still feel very confident about this asset.
Falling wedge and RSI 1D almost oversold: https://www.tradingview.com/x/uxM3RJ8s/

We're also right on the weekly cloud. Last time we touched it was early 2016. The cloud is going straight up to 11.7k.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/oc2VtVfw/

Putting some buys between here and 6900, will wait to go long on margin
Today is the first day someone might say "the next 24 hours are critical" and wouldn't be entirely wrong.

We are playing with the weekly support line and the daily bbands as well as an oversold RSI on everything above 4h excluding the weekly of course. Also if you zoom out we have NEVER had 4 red weeks in a row during 2017 till now. This would be the first time we would defy this pattern since then. The weekly needs to close above 7340 to keep this bullish pattern. Only during 2014-2016 we've seen 4 to 5 red weeks in a row, indicating a prolonged bear market.

 **THIS** is the best recipe for a bounce. 

Not only that, the ask side is incredibly thin. Any medium sized whale could probably cause a smaller BGD. Technicals are on the bull's side.

Unless BTC gets ultra trolly today and decides to sideways all day long between 7000-7200 this is the day of judgement.


Well that selloff sure escalated quickly...
Next support @ 6970 USD: [https://imgur.com/a/7p6WPS6](https://imgur.com/a/7p6WPS6)

Interesting that this is around the value where we had this massive BGD.
I’ve been scalping shorts since I escaped some bad long positions in the mid-low 8k by catching knifes.

I’m out of position at the moment (which usually means 100% fiat for me), but since 7.2k I’m flat in BTC instead without leverage. Seemed like a decent place to take a short break from trading and let the market play out a bit.

Now, I’ve been looking at the prospect of scaling into small leveraged long. But it isn’t looking great. There’s a cluster of support from 7050-6000. But the relatively long range makes risk management tricky.

The nice thing with opening a short here at 7.1k with tight stops is that should the market collapse your position is protected by the aforementioned cluster of support turned resistance.

I think the safer bet is to let the market test the 6900-6800 range and then decide what to do.
Tempted to add to my short, sentiment is still far too optimistic to bottom out here in my opinion.
I see absolutely no reason to open a long or short with leverage here. If you already have a short position, it makes sense to keep it. I don’t see any point of opening a long until 7300-7400 breaks. This is basically gambling, I’ve been out of position for a few days now and am content with it.
Whats the current value of the daily Support Line ? 
!short close xbtusd 7190

Lots of effort here with the price not moving as much, bull divs coming in on many times frames as well. This might not be the very bottom but we should be close enough for a local one at least.
!short XBTUSD close 7213

Don't wanna get caught with my pants down. I think I'm going to start buying
Daily RSI below 30 now. Good chance we form a higher low on the daily with a bounce here.
**Position Bot Update**

Ok guys, notification system with **PushBullet** seems to be working fine with the default channel.
I fixed some bugs and now the specific channels should be working.

Changes:

* Fixed the subscription system to remove /u/ from the usernames.  
* Fixed a bug that returned always the default channel instead of the users channel
* Fixed a bug with the BitMex API, now all the pairs should have a price to calculate the PnL

ToDo:

* Create channels for all the subscribed users
* Add link to the channel in the history page of each user
* Return the channels when replying to the !subscriptions command
* Check if PushBullet is working properly on iPhone. Got a message saying it wasn't
All aboard the bart train?

We just got a wick down with a heavy rejection to the upsidr.

I say Bartman is back!
This feels like either a bottom or a slight delay before goblin town 
Short since $9425. Nobody knows where the bottom is. Most people assume $6500-6800 is where mining becomes unprofitable so this price range is absolute bottom but there are reports, from Fed and bunch of others, about actual cost of mining indicating that it's around $1800-2000. I have to say it's first time i'm bear in this market and it's so boring. Can't wait for a damn recovery.
I don't think waiting a little more for a better price has a good r/r, I might miss the current price before it moves up. I will end the wait and put all my remaining stack in right now.

Added last 45% stack at $7,203, bringing down my base price from $8,275 to $7,720.

!long BTCUSD add 7203 45%
Holy moly. ETH down 10% in BTC since yesterday... what is going on?

Edit: Plus, head and sholders forming on the ETH/BTC daily chart
Realistically, what is capitulation point here? $100? $200?

Does the market want to destroy itself and alienate the user-base for another 3 years like last time?

LTC/BTC looks really bad..look at all that space
I think it dips into 6.8 for the liquidity pool so the MM can long below support and stop hunt plus screw the shorts, [a lot of confluence](https://snag.gy/Uirxls.jpg) down there and then pop back up for the fakeout, then probably do the same around 9k and pop up above for the fakeout and back down until we have a volatile move in one direction out of the trend lines.

50 week SMA (in red) broken, 200 day SMMA (blue) broken, now testing the 50 week EMA (yellow), if it breaks, it will go down to the 100 week SMA.
Sorry for offtopic, but does anyone know how i can post a tradingview chart when on mobile? I cant find the camera tool that gives you a link for the chart you want to post here.
someone here would have an opinion on the jpy (yen)/btc on bitflyer? everything is normal ?
/u/justanotherlogin

Idea for the bot. I've previously sat in whalepool at points mostly during last year and they had a badge system. The idea was to show that you can trade relatively large positions and get a minimum 1000% ROE (just the slide leverage up). Wondering if you would be interested in implementing it into your bot. It may be better in another bot but it was just a thought as you seem to be doing a lot with it lately and have all the necessary data. So the bot would automatically calculate the % gain w/o leverage and keep counts on trades and groups them by losses

Liquidated, -90%, -80%-89%, .... 0-5%, 5-10% .... 100%+

This could reinforce what /u/_chewtoy_ said the other day during his semi rant about not every trade needs to be a winning trade. If you don't think it would work with the bot or haven't got time let me know and I'll see what I can put together. I just started going through postgres for some and python so it'll be a month or something and then I should have time to try and put something together.

I think the bot may have to be stricter for syntax though not sure, just a thought that popped into my head (as I look at my 2000% short from 8520 :-) )
Started scaling into a long. This is my first long in about 2 weeks and 22 trades. 

First long is @ $7155, will add until $6,800 ish. Small adds pretty spaced out all the way down. Adding more heavily in the lower range, as it will prevent me from catching the falling knife to heavily.

Bear flag broke down on 1Hr, which is rare cause usually it’s bart AF. Headed to bed, hoping to get some ordered filled on the low low 
Hey, is it just me, or is this confluence thiccer than Spoofy's walls?

I predicted a while back, upon the monthly chart: a may low wick at 6940 range.
https://www.tradingview.com/x/pewjR1aV/

After Spoofy chopped us to our weekly close, he dumped us to this range, and look what popped up? 
https://tensorcharts.com/s/JHPsiclA
That's thiccer lines of defense. Especially 7k, and 6.94. :)
https://tensorcharts.com/s/gtEVGsDW
That's the numbers on the walls of that range. Those are all Spoofy's "numbers". He always comes in to makes sure the weekly/monthly top/bottoms are printed where wants it. And he's accumulating as we speak. You can watch his schemes on finex order flow if you know what to look for.  https://snag.gy/kyJc0V.jpg
It's honestly fascinating to see his extreme dominance in the orderflow, and his unlimited liquidity capabilities, as well as, all his spoofing around and reshuffling activities. This entiity sometimes comes in and completely takes over the orderbook.

Also massive confluence with other timeframes such as 3-day: https://www.tradingview.com/x/7Gy2Ua4e/
6940 was also our first low, after retracing 7k range in november. 
Honestly, why are people still bearish? Shotgun buys between 6.9-7k And you can chill while all the retail gets chopped and accumulated here lol. 


What are your thoughts peoples?

Someone took up a 38000 eth short position..whales would be wise to pump btc (thin books) with open eth longs alongside to squeeze that guy. ez money   
just sayin, chart still looks shit tho, but only because of that I might close my perps and eth positions.   
[for reference](https://www.tradingview.com/x/GrQT97dN/)   (pls no ban jared)
Going long. No stops. Riding this one to liquidation.

Hold me

Edit: Obviously I set market stops roght before liquidation, so I dont lose my initual margin. But you get it. Maybe 7080 stops aren’t stupid tbh. Can always go long again sub 7k
This price range is just simply too unattractive to anyone who fully cashed out within last few months. I would personally start considering rebuying a few dozen coins in the 4k range, but still wouldn't be too happy about it. There should be a fair number of people who share my mindset. We made our money, no reason to jump in only to risk getting a limb bitten off by some market maker sharks. The 1k-20k price range is simply too fresh.

We had a huge catalyst for last year's run in early 2017. We'll need another to bait fresh money in. At this point, no new blood is flowing in and the general population could not give a fraction of a fuck about cryptocurrency. This isn't going to change without a catalyst.
So much buying right now, I really thought there would be a drop when 7200 went down. People anticipating a pump or what?
Just for fun, I backtested the strategy to long on the 1st and short on the 15th. The results were surprisingly good; better than flipping a coin, which is what the odds should be similar to. 53% profitable over 105 trades; similar results working on multiple timeframes... 8% net profit over the lifetime of BTCUSD/Bitfinex.

Microcycles, perhaps?
Let's be honest, nobody knows where the price is heading but the charts just do not look good. Anyone here who's long can explain your reasoning for being bullish?
!short xbtusd close 7117

Will plan to reshort a bounce to $7500 if it happens, which I'm not all that confident it will. Closed mainly because this is the bottom of the triangle and I had planned to do so several days ago. Still, this looks primed to go lower and I may regret closing prematurely. 
Giant symmetrical triangle still in play and apparently the market wants to validate those lines for now...?  I'm thinking about scaling into a long w/ stops around 6950.  Daily RSI 30. MACD trending towards a crossover this week.  Why not?  Thoughts?  Targets would be 8400ish pending a complete breakdown and will definitely not close anything that breaks to the upside in the next month.  We've been testing this triangle every 30 days like clockwork and haven't violated it yet.  The downside price targets will be the basement of Goblin Town...so I don't even want to think about that (Added those in RED).

So I know order books are worthless, still its interesting to see # of buyers/sellers

on bfx at 7000, there is 1332 buyers and another 886 at 6900

but on the sell side, you just have 170-200 sellers per each $100 range.

now this being bitcoin, if its going to bounce, it'll be doing so right before all those buyers can get their orders filled...so $7,000 is going to be a very interesting range to look at 

not saying it will bounce, but I'm thinking $7,000 def won't go down without a fight 
With all the headlines it is safe to say that there is a bearish sentiment among the mainstream media/analysts right now. While the market is still in bear mode no doubt, in my opinion there is a possibility of a break higher this week, lets take a look.

As I mentioned in my previous reports, critical support for the Bitcoin market is at $7200, it has seen quite a bit of action since Feb. The RSI is signalling oversold conditions on the 1 Day candle chart, a clear indication that open interest is building in the market.

It is important to note that the momentum is clearly still bearish, volatility in the market is quite high and the $7200 support zone (my opinion) could very well extend to $6800. With that said volume is quite poor, if the bears are going to rekt Bitcoin some more I want to see that selling pressure.

I know there are a lot of calls saying we are going to $5000 and even $3000, here is my personal view on the matter. Critical support is around $7200, psychological support is at $7000, if that fails we can expect even lower prices.

Traders that are going long here might set close stop losses or a bit more lose to around $6500 – $6800. Like I mentioned before, picking bottoms is a bad habit and a good way to get rekt in any market. Most trades here should be considered high risk.

I spotted a possible divergence on the 4 hour chart, one of the reasons for my crazy claim at the start of the report, lets take a closer look.

Even though it is just a slight divergence, it is there none the least. Should the RSI continue to tick higher, with confirmation from our other indicator, there is a good probability that the market will play catch-up to the momentum indicated.

A possible bounce here can take us back up to $7400 and maybe $7600 again, should this happen it is important to be mindful of the price action. For a safer entry in the market it would be safer for traders to be patient and see where the next bout of momentum comes from.

I hope you enjoyed the report. Safe trades.

Bitfinex 20 to 30 dollar discount WTF are they doing over there?
I find myself in called bluff situation. Earluer when it was hovering at 7200 I was wondering if I should close. It immediately went up to 7270. I told myself if it went lower I would just cement gains. 4 hours later it's here again and I don't myself hesitant
Can't decide what to do.  For people waiting on the sidelines, what ratio do you keep your holdings at (e.g., 50% fiat and 50% BTC/alts).  Currently I'm 100% in BTC and alts but wondering if I should take some cash out until we have more of a clear sign of where the market is headed.

okay two polls cause I'm curious what y'all are doing and thinking.

I'm curious if everyone is longing this support line. or if people are holding a short/in fiat expecting it to fall through

#Answer both polls please!

Which first $6750 or $8250?

https://www.strawpoll.me/15782166

are you long, short, or flat right now?

https://www.strawpoll.me/15782172

edit: just so people don't think I'm trying to make this sub seem bearish or something, I just used the up/down contract prices on bitmex. They're $6750 and $8250 right now. they're settled on the 1st so technically an up could be profitable even if we hit $6750 first but just wanted to explain why I used those prices
I'm a little surprised it's taking so long to just hit 7k already
Brazil's economy is in serious trouble. If truckers don't accept the deal from Rio we may see systemic economic collapse there. This isn't the first time that's happened, but they're well primed to adopt a digital currency as an alternative.
Seems ETH is leading this drop?
The best case scenario for bull is we close above 7380 on this 12hr making a nice hammer and a rejection off of the support line. This would also line us up nicely with the falling wedge resistance at 7400. The worst case I think would be to go sideways on low volume like we are right now. Otherwise I think we'll see long wicks up again as any breakout will be sold into and then eventually a breakdown of another bear flag. :/ 
A fibonacci retrace of greater than .786 is considered a reversal, is that correct?
Keep in mind the range we're currently in is akin to the 66xx or high 65xx range when we were last there in relation to it's proximity to the bottom of the large symmetric triangle and support that's held since November.

If you're a bullish lean and think the last 5 months has just been a blip in a larger bull run around now is a good r/r for a long with stops below that triangle bottom around 6875.

But buyers aren't showing near the same strength as last time we were down here imo,  so pencil me in as a skeptic. 
It seems most bearish traders are expecting a capitulation. Is there any statistical data suggesting a correlation of expectation vs it actually happening?
It’s not going to shoot up guys lol. We have a few weeks to a few months before we see some action.
Yeah I agree with that. The thing I'm looking at technically is a triple bottom. We are not far from the marked support of this year 

Like you the question of what will happen when we get the inevitable recession is on my mind. Stocks are going to unload, normally that money goes to the bond market because as rates drop the bond market rallies. 

I guess the reason I'm personally bullish right now is because every comment I'm reading is bearish. Sentiment extremes are typically pretty accurate

If that doesn't happen 2015 does seem pretty likely for a plan B. You start to weed out the fluff miners and the gamblers. On the bright side that means more coin for people that stick around.
For anyone looking for some "set and forget" buy levels.  I discovered this today.

Chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/fW7hhfPz/

Layering in orders around these points would seem to be a good long term buy and hold entry.

EDIT: Ignore the fractal, that was just there as a bit of eye candy.  The idea is that the market likes to test previously untested lows and confirm them as support.
Closed my short at 7250. May well have been too early, but don’t want to babysit it with funding now flipped.
Be advised. Even breaking the support doesn't mean we have to continue downwards immediately. We could break it into a capitulation drop and bounce right back in.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/TdpOZL5R/ (2014)
The masses looking at that triangle, assuming it will hold. [Need I remind the bulls some of other trendlines that consolidated at support and got dumped through?](https://prnt.sc/jngb33) If this is your first bear market, you need to realize these trendlines are *made* to be violated *because we just aren't bullish*. We broke every trendline imaginable in 2014.

Wouldn't surprise me if we consolidate at support...again...but instead of BGD, its a big red one. The masses are more bullish at this price-point this time around, for whatever reason.

Edit: [our current triangle also kinda reminds me of ETH](https://prnt.sc/jngcoh)
Longs just increased by 300 after this getting rejected yet again, all the while shorts are closing. It doesn't make me feel confident about being long but I'll stick with it until support breaks. If you look at nothing but the charts the potential upside is about 20% while the downside is about 10% and longing at support is good R/R. However if you consider sentiment then that pushes the R/R down a bit since everyone just seems to bearish. A 10% loss fiat wise is a big hit but I guess that's crypto for you. You just have to roll with the punches trading this thing. 

Edit: A break down from the bear flag as expected. Although support at 7100 seems to be holding and this could be the [spring of an accumulation phase] (http://d.stockcharts.com/school/data/media/chart_school/market_analysis/wyckoff3/wyckoffaccumulation.png). As I stated above, I wouldn't let go of this long unless 6800 breaks convincingly and every push down seems to be harder and harder for the bears. Of course I wish I would have waited until now to go long but this happens. Sometimes frontrunning yourself isn't always a good thing. I guess I couldn't have predicted such bearish sentiment when I was placing my bids, so maybe it was still the right call to frontrun myself but waiting for support to hold may be the better strategy. Will need to adjust my strategy in the future. 

Edit: Here's a chart. https://i.imgur.com/XBYooh5.png  If this does hold here it will bounce really nicely, but I'm already preparing myself to part with my money, lol. 
Model price based on tx rate: 7-day average: $4371, 28-day average: $4689.

 Model price = 10^-0.638 \* (tx per day)^2.181 / # total coins.

Explanation is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2hyl9c/daily_discussion_wednesday_october_01_2014/ckxhy9y) with [historical graphs of price vs. model](https://i.imgur.com/HnZQ9rv.png) (last updated 2018-04-09) and [graphs of other correlations](http://imgur.com/a/7koaG) (last updated 2017-01-30). The code is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2oyrfq/code_for_tx_model/) if you want to improve on it.


**Accuracy of model and recent bearishness**

 Note, that this model has been doing relatively well if it is within *the same order of magnitude* of the price. That is to say, it is not a very accurate predictor of price, and to be within a factor of two of the market price (as recently) is effectively no strong signal. However, the prediction did dip just before the recent pop.

**Batching, UTXO count and so on.**

I have seen no convincing evidence that batching is currently a major effect to reduce the daily tx rate, and a cursory examination shows a similar dip in the UTXO network measure.
I am interested, long term, in alternatives to tx rate (given lightning etc) but I do not think UTXO count is a convincing alternative over, for example, unique addresses.
Parsing the blockchain directly for outputs per block is one possible alternative to deal with batching, payment channels notwithstanding.
6 months of bear market and we still dumping real real hard. Getting really interesting here at the moment. 
Edit: 314 B Market Cap.
Let see it go down to 250 
Any opinion on the theory that EOS is causing the ETH dump, dragging BTC along? Some guy in ethtrader sub is following the EOS eth wallet, huge dumps are being made, 20 percent of the funds remains. With the mainnet launch close, it's only natural they cash out. Thoughts? 
I wont buy this asset until I see where it will be in a few months. This is surreal. Good luck all!
the Bots on Twitter giving away BTC and ETH are at ATH's
!short xbtusd 7100 10x
Anyone hope/feel/wish that the deep Alt bleed and Eth dump might be setting the stage for a BTC surge?
Negativity and doom and gloom all around this post.
Bitcoin is going up very soon.
Long 7100. Not even that I think we won't break the trendline of the triangle, but the risk/reward here is starting to seem reasonable.  


Edit: Also Eos goes live in a few days. Maybe they will want to finish any theoretical dump/short of eth and time the market to be in recovery during launch? Idk #hopium
welp another 12-24 hours of sideways until we make another leg down 
Guys, look at that crazy 1H volume at finex.
Also, super short term, as in . next minutes. Spoofy is signaling the vwap. prolly a stoprun, before volatility hits. ttps://snag.gy/fRgijv.jpg

Yellow is vwap https://www.tradingview.com/x/oGQlCn6w/
So falling wedges are the new bull divs that was the new I&HS ? :D
The great conclusion is that NO ONE here knows S\*\*T about if we go down or up. Double bottoms, Triple bottoms, quad bottoms, Fabracci BS. Buy or Sell thats on you but don't listen to anyone flip a coin thats better advise!
Short 3x from 7378 avg. The attempted pumps keep getting sold into. Buyers seem to be hoping for a bgd and when it doesn't appear they vanish. On 1h this looks like a bear flag. Still, I'm cautious about the slow pump as well as apparent lack of dump attempts. Stop at 7450.

Also, ETH is crashing haaaaard. I wonzer how much that has prevented a more significant bump for btc.
Swing cycles the last few months have changed on (or within a day of) the 6th of the month. Interesting to see if we'll break this pattern.

Initial triple bottom target is being reached, however a new target appeared when drawing a descending channel from different wicks. BTC could potentially land right on the 6th of June at the intersection

https://www.tradingview.com/x/uxaoQwlL/

Edit: Reaching this new target I believe would have cooled off the RSI to below 30, perhaps 26. Could continue to drop as RSI hasn't hit oversold on the weekly chart since 2015, but could also have recharged the buying motive/impetus
Isn’t it strange how everyone seems to focus on USD price for Bitcoin? Doesn’t that sort of defeat the purpose of what Bitcoin is meant to do? This is what keeps me bearish on Crypto. Nobody really cares about the true purpose. They’re just worried about how much USD they may eventually have from it.
Whenever I'm not very sure if the price is going to drop or not, I turn my chart upside down and ask myself 'will this go up'? 
Now that we are beginning to go down after having bounced from the BB on the 6h chart we can begin to prepare for 7.2 and 7K to most possibly be broken within the next few candles. [CHART](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ayiA12CH)

Following my short play, but that said im mostly shorting ETH atm at it dies harder than btc. Been adding since 575, and 7500 for the btc short. Will continue to add if we break 7K for a bitcorn.
I closed out my short from 7260 of 22k contracts (unfortunately this was only 1/2 of what I wanted to have open but I closed some positions at 7190 on a previous minor dump and didn't get to fully refill), new long position of 15k contracts at 7160.  Plan on repeating the cycle and closing out my  long in the 7240-60 level and refilling my short.
Just broke down through lower support line going back 5 days.

To accumulate and dump on us, paint the monthly and pump on us
10x long from 7125.
So what does it mean when the price keeps dropping down gently, slowly, relentlessly, on low volume? I don't recall a time period this long in the 7000s \- is there another period where we lingered for a long time devoid of energy and floating down to use as a precedent for comparison?
some altcoins start to fall exponantially. XMR, DASH, BCH as examples. 
Given the italy situation and possibility of capital controls, it should at least stop BTC drowning.

BTC actually reversed during the Greek crisis in the summer of 2015, so if this gets going expecting similar results.
Daily RSI is now almost 30 and about to touch the daily Bands. Scaling into a long now with laddered buys starting here @7135 down to 6850 with stops below 6750. This is pretty good r/r for bulls, especially since we've seen three red weeks in a row.

Plenty of Bull divs to be found on different timeframes too. 
It gets really scary, I get flash backs to 2014. These huge walls and this empty upside and it still drops lower and lower. Noobs will get milked .
The price of bitcoin is bouncing, and by bouncing I mean the selling is accelerating.
In 2017, we thrived. In 2018, we fight.
Does this look like somewhat orderly accumulation at progressively yet carefully managed lower prices to anyone else?
I can't remember the last time I was this confident with a short position in BTC.  It should have been at $9900 and I did open a big short there, but was nervous.

But I don't see this bouncing until below $6900, if then.

(And of course over-confidence is not desirable as a trader, so I am keeping that in mind).
As price decreases, what is the likelihood that volatility will increase wildly? i.e. huge market buys from people trying to protect their positions?

It's times like these that make me wonder why Bitmex only allows very few stop-limit orders...
Can anyone explain to me why the 3D 3-in-1 MA indicator on TV (with 50,100,200) have a different 100SMA on the 3day chart. Am I missing something. On wisdom we're sat right on it on TV we seem to be well below it.

What am I doing wrong here?
Stop loss triggered on my short @ 7430. God damn you, tricky dildo!
Opened a FOMO short when waking up @ 7213, 10x, 100%.
Stops a bit higher than last time. I will keep it for now.
A lot of altcoins are haveing already a lower low than according to the 6k BTC low. BTC dominance might form a double bottom here. It made a higher low and is moving upwards. It feels like the real crypto winter is coming... Why cant we just fast\-forward  half a year to see where we are. Patience is key, maybe it is better to wait and not to get into that little bouce which we might see or not see. 
Can someone ELI5 how to follow some of the regular poster’s on this subs trades in real time? Is there an app or something that tracks user positions? Eg.. chewy? 
Ok i have had a dream for some time now. Imagine that the next bull run happens just before the upcoming recession. Imagine that people see they stocks crash and crypto rise and they think to themselves - why shouldnt I invest? Its basically a prefect storm and could make for a bubble much larger than expected. Its just a fanfiction for now, but it sure makes me dizzy just to think about it. It could make it so that crypto actually achieves the goal of replacing fiat currencies and changing the world.
https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1000893509132587008

Social media interest plateaued currently. 

RSI approaching oversold.    We may want to set up some buys at $6900 here.
Welp. BTC is going into six months bearish as all hell. Wut do now? 
is...is...is it over? 

$12,000 BTC by june 1st? 

BANG! ZOOM! Straight to the moon?
Other markets \(like XMR and soon ETH\) are close to capitulation mode it looks like. Bullish ;\)
Reduced my position further to only 55%. Added some new stack to increase my disposable stack so that I can add it to my position at the right time / when needed. 

Waiting for the target range..
Don't you think they want all to believe that it's going short but then suddenly it goes  long? 
Bitcoin is like a child that was born to honest, respectable middle class parents. It showed signs of intelligence early on, went to a good private school, got good grades, played varsity football, and got accepted to a respectable university. Except in its freshman year of college, bitcoin had an unsavory roommate who became a bad influence. Bitcoin started to drink and do drugs, go out to bars and get in fights, have unprotected sex with strangers. Then bitcoin got into heavier drugs, started getting arrested for disorderly conduct, dropped out of school, sold all its belongings, and now it’s about to get kicked out in the street. Family relations are strained, and it would be no surprise to anyone to find bitcoin on the street one year from now offering BJs in exchange for drugs. Moral of the story? Institutional money, not even once....
Seriously though. What the hell is the point of any of this? Someone decided to give some github projects some value? There are no valid use cases for any of this crap. Just a bunch of idiots talking about how this is the new internet and drawing charts every 5 minutes looking for bottoms. It’s so incredibly stupid and it’s a shame productivity is being wasted on this garbage.
lol every $20 bump gets relentlessly pummeled back down...this is gentlemen exit all crypto.
I feel like this how frustrating normal markets are. It sucks. Probably now BTC is being traded by hedge funds and other assholes with deep neural networks or some shit 
Is Korea still out of the game, nobody talks about them at all anymore. 
I see one of my limit orders executed during the night

!long xbtusd 1x 5&#37;
I feel really sorry for the shorters.
Who agrees that the bottom of BTC is correlated to the global average minimum cost of mining 1 BTC? Just like with real gold, it costs about $1200 to mine 1 ounce of gold. So the price of gold, though it may dip, should never be under $1200 for long.

If the global average \(I think weighted by location\) is about $8000 to mine 1 BTC, do you think that $8000 is our real price going forward if looking ahead? And we shouldn't be long under $8000, but then also won't go really much higher? Say $10,000?
We're getting close to the 7 mark. Hope everyone's ready for the drop and not still holding, expecting a bull run.
When is the dumping gonna end? Like who's selling all these coins...? Jeeze
Seen a bunch of posts about EOS. I have a few thigs to say:

Neo is better than EOS

Ethereum is better than Neo

Cardano is better than Ethereum (or will be)

Calm your tits
My sleep trading session went well.  Exited my scalp (purchase price 7170) between 7260 and 7280 and returned short between 7280 and 7299 and woke up to trading at 7230 (now in the 7220s)
https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8mnaib/daily_discussion_monday_may_28_2018/dzpc9hn/

For those that questioned my trading for friends: https://ibb.co/k1DhOJ
Haha. Just kind of new. Sorry if I’m in the wrong place to ask the question. There seems to be more experience and knowledge here.
So it's considered common BTC practice to not reuse addresses. Are there any exchanges that don't reuse addresses? Specifically exchanges with alts... I know that coinbase and GDAX don't do this.
Hello BGD my old friend
Tether to the moon!
Lol I think crypto is dead 
Where should I set my stop loss, please?
Puny drop. Long. Relax fellas
We will keep seeing bounces like we saw a few weeks ago. But overall trend doesn't look like it's stopping until sub 1000. The scary thing is once we go below 1000, there is a ton of air below to $200. People think this is crazy talk but if they did some reason on network effect, the opposite is just as likely as the 100k moon talk. 
No volume
Somebody else that needs to sell some coins before 31. of May to pay taxbill to not have to pay interests? 
This movement reminds of the 6.7k waltzing for a few days then BgD when it looked like a bearish trend for sure even more. This is going to shoot up from here. Thank me later. 100% all in long at 7390. Go in with confidence fellas. Ez profit 
[removed]
Lol calm down chump, the fact you take it upon yourself to regulate this forum is beyond. Get a life
As of now I can say I told you so
tinfoil hat time, it's EOS shorting ETH USD as they dump their ETH for USD thus doubling up on profits and double damaging eth.
Whoa, now that's one big green dildo on the daily. A potential squeeze could be profitable if timed right.
thats insane - its bigger than sept/oct.  i've been thinking EOS is bound to have some sort of hiccup or hiccups with its launch which would be a plus for the ETH price
The herd of lambs are coming in for their slaughter.  I agree, bounce may be incoming from this one. 
If banana peels are good enough for time travel they’re good enough for me. 
a-ha, once again, the conservative, sandwich-heavy portfolio pays off for the hungry investor!
There's always too much mayonnaise on those though.
RSI doesn't matter when you have strong trend. Both up and down. RSI is good indicator, but may not work when there's a big sell-off.
 And every time that happened it was a good time to sell as BTC contracted 20% or more each time it went over that RSI. And if you are saying that the 3D RSI is still not oversold, well, when it does, by your same argument, that would be a good time to buy, right?
For you, I believe we can make an exception; 

What alts are you invested in?
Merlin! I've been dying for a PnF.
Why do you think stocks look worse than crypto? Are you speaking technically or fundamentally? I actually think they look stronger than they have in months \(though obviously still overbought given we're at year 9 of the bull market\)  


Also, FWIW I truly believe BTC is eating into Gold's demand. Maybe only to a small degree, but it's a dynamic worth considering.
Just to add on a little more, I was previously firmly in the boat that we were going to hit $6800 at minimum before returning to climbing but I have changed my viewpoint a bit and I think there's a decent chance the bottom will be higher.  I had a couple friends/coworkers that I told my thesis too and they gave me a few k to trade (partly pased on the fact that I 3xed my stack this past week).  I made them a 50% return in 48hrs but I have returned their funds to them because I don't think the continued drop is nearly as sure of a play as it was looking on Thursday/Friday.
I bet.  We're heading to a mid 200's billion total market cap again like we did in March.
From my perspective, ~7.1k is a pretty significant, super long term trend line. I don't think we will spend much time below that level, but that's just a guess (hope).
Bro,, I'm not even sure.. Any chance 6k will hold?
Shitcoin pump and dumps happen all the time during bear and bull markets. I don't think it is that easy to make gains with them as it is a lot of luck..
equal amount of longs opened as well, if we stay in this range with open interest increasing the move up/down is going to be even more explosive 

e: actually about 1400 shorts, 700 longs, sorry
fomo
It could be noobs like the last time.
1300 BTC added in shorts in the last 90 minutes - it is a big increase indeed.
Big red dildo's are scary for the emotional traders, MM'ers know what they're doing. 
https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSDSHORTS/

ETH shorts are *way* up.
It got slightly worse, tbh. It's much easier to remove emotion if it's only something you did on the side.
I did it about 2 years ago and am still going, over time I found that the frequency of my trades are getting few and further between, risk aversion kept going up without steady income, so throughout this bear market I've just been feeding on my savings and holding what I can stand to lose for the longer term in cold storage, plus some slow but steady accumulation. Relatively burnt out on trading by now, the gains don't feel that important anymore, I'm even considering taking my old job back, not for money, but for the social aspect and bringing some formal structure back into my life to help get more disciplined. Also having benefits again would be neat.
Don't do it. 95% of traders lose $.
I've been trading full time since the start of the year and know what you mean. 

Initially I was making 10-20 small trades a day, but now I'm enjoying life more and sticking to 3-5 larger trades a week. Much better :)
About the same. Although my quality of life has improved dramatically (expect for when I'm stressed about a position sometimes). It was actually when I did this for a hobby that I overtraded because I was inexperienced. Now I am able to figure out where I want to buy and sell and then do other things in between.
thought about it, but in the country we both live you'll get taxed as a business and that's double the rate it is as a hobby
Damn Litecoin is looking terrible. RIP
Agreed 6.8k definitely seems like a smart place for a long.
Eth has started to get some higher % drops than btc, but until the ratio is less than 6%, it's actually held up better than btc. The first time BTC hit 6k, eth barely dropped. This current downtrend for BTC had eth going sideways.


 I think eth holders will eventually realize moon isn't soon and it will correct down.
attractive for a whale... But that's not counting hidden walls right? 
This can be quite deceptive since iceberg and hidden orders lurk in the shadows.
That's amazing really 10,000 coins is under $100M .. so where are the buyers.  

That's the problem when most people are sheep they just chase after instead of looking where value is.  By the time we get to $12k or so where it should be priced minimum, everyone then will jump in and distort the price way to high again so that it can collapse lower.. I think Bitcoin ironically punishes those who invest for the wrong reasons. Just works out that way and why Very long term HODL makes the most sense.
On Polo the amount to go to $7k corresponds to over $10k on the sell side.

Even though it's smaller volume it's looks quite crazy, like a tidal wave. 
That usually happens when people don't expect big buys to come through. On the first ride to goblintown in February, sell side was super thin and people were all like 'oh just a few whale orders will push us right back up' -- but that's not what happened because folks knew they HAVE to just market sell if they actually want any of their sells to fills, and there's no point having sell walls anywhere cus the price is going down just fine without any further pushing. 
Yeah, definitely a good warning sign to keep stops fairly close on shorts. I'm short because I think we will fall further, but I also think a reversal may be very violent if it occurs.
I remember the time in 2014, it was exactly the same. So huge buy walls got filled and the upside was empty, that was another reason why so many got rekt, because it was completly irrational from this perspective. 
Nice analysis and congrats on the trade!


Nice man, congratulations on your milestone! Super motivational! Still working on mine with the same goal: building a cold storage from trading profits only. 
Congrats on your gains milestone! Thanks for your analysis, it is always to pleasure to read your thoughts. Always on point.
Nice and responsible done, knowing when to walk away is an under-rated trading skill 
Could that not be a descending wedge as well (micro view)? On mobile so can't see too well.

And congrats on your trade. Wish I had held onto my long from above 8, been getting chopped up ever since :| My fault for trading too impulsively.
Bottom of the wedge (7130) held against a first test - you betting on it breaking up and looking to flip long/close position or will you just be riding it out?

Edit: Might not hold for long...
Good rr for a longer trade too
Do you have a target in mind? Would you consider adding to this position? If so, how far down will you add?
Where are you setting your stops? 
Nice graph.  I've actually been doing a lot of analysis lately on the historical volatility and found the same thing.  Our volatility has come down a lot in recent weeks, but not enough to actually indicate to me that we're out of this mess yet.
Bear since $14k, it's not over confidence, it's common sense, the hype has gone (for now).

When you have a market based solely on rampant speculation, and interest dries up, it's quite obvious what the result is going to be. Throw into the mix a bunch of people buying in at ATHs and expecting crypto to act like a never ending Atm, and it's even better.

Meanwhile most here harp on about 'triangles' without actually opening their eyes.
there's a bit of a difference between the price from 1 year ago ($1k) to twice that of gold's market cap. one side is being just a bit more delusional than the other...

imagine someone suggesting ETH be worth $70,000...what's more realistic, $70,000 ETH? or $70 ETH?
There are a lot of refugees from ethtrader or cryptocurrency here so I'm not sure if the increase in subscribers is really organic. 
I came here from the cryptocurrency daily discussions about 1 month ago....  love the moderators on this sub as well as the calm demeanor most display here.
Refugee from cryptocurrency reporting in. Actually some meaningful discussion and learning opportunity here, not just juvenile shilling and "wen moon wen lambo"
Some bullish news which is nice but I think the cloud is veeery thin. How strong is the signal in that case? Next week <10k and we've fallen through the cloud.
> the ask side is incredibly thin. Any medium sized whale could probably cause a smaller BGD.

I agree, a whale could also trigger a chain reaction. [Look at this order book and it's ask side, this is right when we hit the low of $7,062 before closing at 22:29 UTC](http://anon.pics/view/image/bitfinex-order-book-28-may-2018-2229-utc)
No not critical. We need shorts to rise and price movement to get "predictable" before a move. We'll keep dropping for a few days, let everyone get comfortable shorting again, then go up. A bgd now would further scare shorters which is exactly what the MM's are fishing for with this price movement. 
If we hit 6970, the daily/12/6/4/1 hour will all be oversold, the bears are so overextended that there should in theory be a bounce. But the market is fully manipulated at this point so who knows.
It'll be interesting to see what sort of psychological impact this has on the market, the BGD was kind of a "hurray its the bottom!" moment for a lot of people
Okay so I'm out of the loop with this BGD everyone's talking about today, what does it stand for?

Big Gay Drop?
Click on their name and then click on "Follow" button their profile screen.
I'm almost willing to bet my left nut this is reversing right around here. The atmosphere is terrible on every crypto sub, bears are upvoted and any positivity downvoted to hell. This is the atmosphere where reversals happen.  
Well, in my case, if I wait till $7,300 - $7,400 to be broken, I would have potentially increased my base price to a couple hundred dollars above. So for me, the best move was to add right now or even lower, moreover, this has been my plan all along since I am underwater.

But for those not in a position, be patient to reap the sweetest fruit. Good luck to you and everyone else trading. Cheers!
What kind of logic is if you have a short, then keep it, but don't open one?   And 10 upvotes too.  I can't even begin to explain how that makes absolutely no sense.  If you are keeping a short position, then you think the price is likely to drop.  So in that case, would make sense to open a short position.  Why do I even try.
> I’ve been out of position for a few days now

Are you prepared to be out of position for weeks? Because that seems prudent at this point. This chop is lethal.
I kind of disagree. True, if we break support in the 6900 area we are in for a real bear market. But the risk reward to long as we get closer to the trendline gets better the closer we get. I would say longing anywhere 6900-7200 with stops at 6700-6800 is fine.

If we go back to 7400-7500 it could just be a fakeout and you would be longing the top.

Nice trade.

Did the same thing mate. With the RSI nearly oversold on all time-frames I feel like we can't go lower right now. Maybe we should retest 8,000 before going lower. 

Edit: When every single trader and their mum are ready to buy at 7,000 the price might not reach that point.

Or bleed forever until corn is worth 0
feels like early april. The  closer we get to the 7k support, the barter the price action. 2 days ago we broke down from the giant pennant with a flagpole from 8.5k to 7250, we should have much more down pressure than that
Have you been having success trading the Barts? I can't seem to adjust to them, so I've completely given up on intraday trading.
Feel jealous about your 10x long. I was not that brave so just closed my short at 7189. I hope we will pump to 7500 before dumping again.
That's the lesser spotted reverse Bart you're looking at there. Many shorts being eaten. 
Upvoted, because I can't stand the silence. Three thousand users present, and one post per 20 minutes.
If it were the bottom, what are the odds of a new bull run to be kickstarted now (with ups  and downs, consolidation etc) against sideways for weeks/months?
Upvoted because OG subreddit reference
No one really knows, but if you want my feeling for what it's worth, I expect another leg down before a rebound. Then a re-drop into the 6000's
The costs to mine one Bitcoin do not affect the price of Bitcoin.  Only the other way around.

When the price gets low enough, high-electricity cost miners shut off and eventually go out of business.  Low cost miners continue running and difficulty slightly retraces.  The lowest cost miners actually continue to deploy and even buy used hardware off the failing miners on the cheap.  All this happened before in 2014/2015.
bitmain made a ton of money in 2017 \- they can tolerate much lower prices before it hurts their operation, and they may wish to do so to shake out all the new mining operations in north america, japan, and EU.

This as anything else is speculation.  Just don't think the miners will run for the hills just because mining isn't profitable ...
It depends on electricity price. For people with electricity of $0.19/kwh and up it currently is unprofitable to mine. US average for perspective is around $0.13/kwh.

For me (and others around $0.07/kwh) mining becomes unprofitable at $2770. For big corporate farms in areas with cheap electricity like Bitfarms it'll only become unprofitable at around $1200 give or take. Of course such big farms though have expenses beyond electricity like employees, massive rent for a warehouse and so forth. Smaller miners don't have many ongoing expenses beyond electricity.  
>$6500\-6800 is where mining becomes unprofitable

From the numbers I read it is around 4\-5k USD electricity costs to mine 1 BTC, the fix costs for hardware were already paid, so that does not matter.
To me it's highly unlikely bottom is in the 6ks.

A more realistic price now seems to be around mid 4ks but of course anything can happen. 

Wouldn't be at all surprised to see a very slow bleed down to the 4s by August time and then either the end of the bear market, or another 3 months to fall down to under 2k before finally hitting bottom. 
Risky but I agree this is a decent place to open a long. Any target?
Good luck man but i think youre gonna lose it all if you dont close for a loss soon

There were some incredibly huge hidden sell walls yesterday at 574, 569 , 567 and 565. I started a discussion about how those sell walls could be price suppression and had a feeling this might shoot up when they are finally bought through. Wanted to close my btc hedge short because of this, but most people here interpreted it the right way - just a proper sell off. Glad i listened to them and stayed in my btc hedge short. Ty guys, dodged a bullet.
Rumour has it EOS is unloading the ETH they have from the ICO (and they have a ton of ETH). Makes sense to try to scare the shit out of the competition before their launch.
Been holding a eth short and adding since 575 first target is 420 
Got stopped on my eth short from 570 by .20$ .switched to a long @565...

I'm so pissed right now... 
XMR is down to April lows as well. Crazy. Bullish ;\)
The market doesn't want anything. It has no feelings. It is not sentient. It's just people buying and selling.
> Does the market want to

"the market" is a bunch of impatient, greedy speculators who think they deserve 10000% returns. 

they have 0 follow through or idea on how to get there, they just want more money that they siphon off new entrants. This space is not full of patient people with a plan, it's full of people who don't care about what happens after a blow-off top.

so don't expect the market to do anything that makes sense or seems financially responsible. the market is guided by a bunch of fools
3.1k - some even say 1.8 or into the 2ks
> Looks to me as if $BTC is about to reclaim its role as the king of the roost -- which is exactly the position it should be in.

Well said, Peter. Well said. 
Honestly, when these MAs are ~150 USD apart, what significance do they have? This is just cherry picking whatever line holds, if any. I'm betting you could paint a whole spectrum from 10k to 5k with daily/weekly MAs.

The final PnL is already calculated w/o leverage. I have that value in all the trades so i can group them without a problem.
How did you calculate your 2000% PnL? From the bots calculations your PnL should be (8520 - 7100) / 8520 = 0.1667
Are you multiplying by leverage?

How would this grouping be shown? In the history page of each user?

I think you use Finex and I know who you are talking about. Overall, I agree with you. Could be a good prediction.
Well, the ETH hidden sell wall appears to have reappeared at $540. So, BTC is probably barting alone until the wall is taken down.

EDIT: That's an absurd number of shorts on ETHUSD, though. Shorts at an ATH at this point? Makes no sense unless someone has information we don't.

Good luck!  What %? Any leverage?
I made plenty of money on the bull run and I have a very compelling reason to jump back in - I want to make more money.  I'm not retired yet.  I've been buying as it's been going down and I will continue to do so, scaling back in steadily.

Markets are herd animals or pendulums.  They swing one way, go too far, swing back the other, go too far.   This bubble hangover will reverse eventually, no one knows when, and it will be off to the races again.  It could go down to the 4ks, like you said.  At the moment I think perhaps 5500-6k. 
Precisely this, when the bagholders who jumped in at ATH's during the peak of the hype start selling off and we drop to \<$4k then I will go hard on various alts in particular, the downside risk will be far reduced by that point, and the upside potential significant

Of course you still run the risk of things absolutely collapsing, but if we retract to a market which looked like April/May last year before all the hype, then things start to look very attractive again
It's really odd innit? seems like the whole market is holding its breath knowing that the next big move is potentially a huge deal

everyone is waiting for the guy before him to buy/sell
6,8 - 7,4 is make it or break it territory.

We need to leave this range to go up or down. If you got it, it's time to put up or shut up.
ETH just pumped about ~~10%~~ 8.76% (finex) because it hit its 50 week MA/365 DMA area. Probably triangulation bots and the ensuing bit of FOMO.

EDIT: zoomed in on my chart and properly measured the *pump* because of comment below
Sellers are exhausted at 7200. Now begins the pump soon. Went all in at 7300 with full confidence. Dont waver take a stand. 
Try shorting on 2018 jan 6 and then longing on the next 6th, shorting again, etc. 
Do the same for every other possible combination of dates and draw a histogram for the profits/losses.  If you notice some trending around neighboring bins, then perhaps you are onto something.  But I expect you'll find equally distributed noise, and you just happened to have picked a pair of dates that is in a profitable bin, and that you could find an even more profitable historical bin.
do you mean you increased your stack bu 53% or you had 53% successful trades?
the general reason for being bullish on BTC is an idea, a possibility for many. 
honestly, bullish mentality is a progressive mentality in its core. it might sometimes seem dumb. it might seem irrational at certain points. 

so many things in our civilization were questioned and laughed at for a certain period of time. 

but they persisted and they grew. and now we all take them for a given. 

not being exactly sure that BTC's case is like that (otherwise I'd sell literally everything I own for it). but I do think that it's the "bullish" mentality that brings positive change for the world. and BTC does have the fundamentals for that. and they are actually stronger than they were when it was 20k. I get it that most people in this sub have the traders' perspective and the question probably is based on charts, but I think many people do root for BTC for reasons that are stronger and far more long term than current charts (and December ones, for that reason). /edit - typos.
1D RSI is about to hit 30. It basically never hits that without getting a nice bounce in the weeks after. 
Bullish because it’s awesome technology and once more people find out about it and start using it, the price of the top cryptocurrencies (including bitcoin) will skyrocket. We are in a short term gradual downturn.  Calm before the storm until the masses arrive once again. 
Bitcoin has had several bull runs, and they all seemingly came from nowhere. When the next bull run comes, it will surprise most people.

!short xbt/usd close 7117
Looks to me like the mother of all bear pennants...
Aren’t they all just bear flags?
Until it doesn't 
Also just a reminder that the moment you think you have the system figured out, it'll fuck you over. Remember your stops.
I think the exact opposite, I think 7k will go down with a light breeze
The RSI is signalling oversold conditions on the 1 Day candle chart, a clear indication that people are selling their corn.


>a clear indication that open interest is building in the market.

What do you mean by this?

Nice analysis!
Dumping.

They want to buy lower. Cannot image they have profit at these levels. They just count on it that they can buy at a lower price.

It's called greed.

Close half and let the other half run free with stop loss around 7305. Or better yet, no stops and babysit any pump that appears to avoid getting stop hunted
You waited this long. Do nothing. 
You know when you hear people talking about capitulation, this is how it begins, just on a larger scale.  

All the people holding bitcoin like you are having similar thoughts right now.  “Well maybe I should just sell it because I am starting to think it could continue down, but maybe this is the bottom.”  When everyone starts thinking the latter is getting less and less likely, you will see the final downswing and it could get ugly as everyone makes a mad dash for the door.  

I’m not offering advice to you, just noticing this sentiment and what it “could” mean.  
[deleted]
You underwater or in the black? Long term investor(years) or looking to make a quick buck in the next 2-3 years. I don't think we'll see 20K for a while, Maybe if we bottom out quickly with massive capitulation we can start going back up but at the moment people are buying every dip which makes things a little tough when the floor falls from underneath. Honestly if you can't accept the fact that BTC MIGHT hit sub 2k then sell and wait for a trend reversal. If your a believer then just DCA in the coming months/years to lower your average. Don't buy into fomo or sell into fear.

I will say though that because we went up at such a quick pace there's a fairly decent argument for very little support of price. I would be worried if 4.6-5K doesn't bounce above 10K. If it doesn't I think we're somewhere between sub 3K and 2013 ATH. There's always the possibility that faults are discovered that cannot be patched or some black swan event you need to factor in and we never reach ATH again. I think we have at least one more massive bull run but at this point I wouldn't put my lifes savings into it.
Your clearly not comfortable with your current risk level. Take some off 
Time to buy
If you think price is likely going down significantly before it goes back up significantly, then sell.  It just depends on how confident you are, as far as how much you sell.

Even I have to vote for $6750 at this juncture. Here's hoping I feel really stupid for saying this tomorrow. 
Uh-oh... r/Bitcoinmarkets is long. That means we are going down. The sentiment on this sub is usually the opposite of the correct market move.
Bearish is your MO man, never change! Embrace it, it's your brand. 
I don't think these polls are all that reliable for the information you're trying to gather. You can never trust the sample you're getting each time is consistent with the last and not manipulated/biased. You're better off just asking the question and letting people comment and judge based on the comment sentiments than relying on a poll like this. You'd also probably get a more accurate picture of shorts/long by looking at the position bot website, if most people are still updating that.
Looking at the poll results. Most people are long, and most people expect 6750 first. In that case, we're definitely going longer with the cascading liquidations...
long. itll hit 8250 before 6750. it wont even break 6900. guranteed

Yes doesn't seem to be any major, quick crashes like the old days.  
What you said about Brazil’s situation is way, way too sensationalist. Not nearly as daunting as you make it out to be. There is no such thing as “The Rio Deal”.  The deal is between the truckers association and the federal government. There has already been an agreement and gas stations are already being resupplied. I just filled up about 30 minutes ago in the state of Sao Paulo. The state of Rio is being slow to get back to full operations as the leadership of the truckers association is very disorganized. There is not even a slight threat of economic collapse. As for adopting a digital currency, it certainly would benefit Brazil, but the general population is 99% ignorant about the topic and government officials have way too many other, higher priorities than looking into crypto, unfortunately. Brazil has always been semi-chaotic and the population is very outspoken when it comes to protesting etc. This strike by the truckers association did not generate mass public outcry, supermarket shelves did not empty out, there are still taxis and busses running, and as I said earlier, the deal has already been struck and gas stations are already starting to be resupplied across the country, with the exception of Rio, which accounts for 11% of the country’s GDP. Although significant, it is not the largest contributor nor would the situation in the sole state of Rio be a cause for economic collapse of the entire country.

And Italy...
I heard that they reached a deal.
Truckers as in truck drivers? What's the deal with them?

thought for a second there you talked about Venezuela and their economic shitshow but then i remembered brazil has also done some shady buisness. Could be good for crypto but charts look nasty atm
I noticed that too... ETH and ADA and TRX and a few other alts seemed to be leading this most recent drop... ETH was down 11% at one point while BTC was only down ~1% which lasted for at least a few minutes iirc...
Its liquidated moonkids, might even make r/ETHtrader go bearish
yep. Tether / EOS stuff
The worst part is, bearflags don't really even break down anymore. We just meander sideways/down slowly. 
at what price point would we reach that?
Yup I have my buys set just a little lower around 6000\-6400
When the market was going up, we had months of people thinking it was overbought. People who sold off at 10k only to see the price double again.

When the market sells, it can continue to look oversold for months or years. You can't pick a bottom based on this. 

What we do have is a ~6.8k floor that if breached, could put prices into a whole new world of hurt. Or it could bounce up and triple confirm the bottom. Smart money is waiting for confirmation of direction before picking a side. Being premature now is just gambling.
I can confirm that I’ve genuinely made money before just by doing the exact opposite of what everyone else on this sub is doing.

To be honest, the fact that we haven’t dropped more makes me feel mildly bullish short term (even if I’m not optimistic about Bitcoin at all in the long term). 
I don't think the sentiment is as bearish as you think.  Look at all the downvotes on people posting bearish sentiment (some do get upvotes but a lot receive downvotes).  There are also plenty of bullish posts being made.  So I don't know if I can agree with your thought on sentiment being overly bearish at this point.
To what degee is Bears talking about $3k, like when Bulls were talking about $20k?  

That said, $20k hit. 
This hurts on the inside and outside. 

Terrifying actually 
Its a good thing this market doesn't work like that.
Interesting, thanks for this. Can anyone who was around back then speak to the sentiment at the time? Did it feel like capitulation?
This chart isn't even accurate. It went down to like $180
Keep on dreaming but it's not going to happen. This downward move is already far extended down. It will try to bounce if we drop below 7k, daily RSI will be oversold and you have to look very far to find where we didn't bounce after the daily got oversold. Cycles are already pretty low and close to turning. If bears 'want' to break 6k it needs SERIOUS bearish momentum. The volume right now is not a serious attempt to break to new lows. If we see a bounce to 8.2k and then start dropping, that's where the volume will start to increase and when you want to pay attention and cut your risk, if you didn't do that already. 


Trendlines are just trendlines, every time it gets violated, you can draw a new one and prove whatever you want. 


Not trading is also trading. Better to wish you were in the trade then wishing you weren't
The best position is no position  

Or a short from 20k 
alternatively, $7300 just survived a bear run and we established a higher low and are about to head back up 
While I feel for you, being underwater can be painful regardless of the direction, it seems your perspective may be swayed slightly by your position. The way I would look at it, if you were out of position, what would you do here? I hate to push my agenda here, but it's safest to look for signs of reversal before trying to knife catch, because the moment people feel safe buying at 7k and selling at 10k is the point this rule will no longer apply. Maybe DCA would be the best way to go here?

I will say, I am pretty bearish right now simply given the long/short ratio here, but there's no way this can go straight down forever. Regardless of what happens this week, don't panic sell. A bounce is bound to happen soon, it's just a question of when.
[deleted]
I'm pretty positive that we're going to hit at least $275b once again.
Yeah, it seems like it could have some weight, it's just joining the dots really.  This article was doing the rounds last month.  EOS at one point owned 5% of all Ether.  Thats a pretty powerful situation to be in, considering they are looking to one up/next gen them.

(https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/ongoing-eos-ico-raised-2-billion/)

Apologies in advance for ALT article and chat
Disclaimer: I am over\-invested in ETH and think EOS is garbage.

I think "cashing out" is the wrong way to look at this possible situation.  From a game theoretical perspective, EOS is incentivized to destroy ETH and the way to do that at this phase of the industry is to sink the ETH price. EOS has more money than they will ever need; the best bang for the buck at this point is sinking ETH.
its common knowledge  
they usually market sell the bottom though, these hidden sell walls are a new thing   
i wouldn't say this dump on btc is caused by EOS, but it doesn't help
ETH is just following BTC like usual, it shows the common pattern of a stronger dip if BTC dumps. No EOS or black magic involved!
Beallish!
thats not how it works..
top 3 comments are about going long/being bullish.

oh someone just posted one. okay 3/4 
Seems to me a lot of people expecting a decent bounce in the 6.8-7k range. Longs also increasing as we go down. I’m just not comfortable with all of this. Out of position atm as I have no idea which way this is going to go
not so sure we go sideways here, we startet to extent the 6h bands. 
The big story on bitfinex is a massive liquidation of ETH actually - check out its chart - enormous selling all day on finex, and then the guy panicked at the end, drove it down 10%.
When you're so counter culture and hip that you trade on 13 min timeframe
I'm waiting for a fake out any minute now. My bet is break up and dump after. if it dumps now i'll buy once it stops
https://www.tradingview.com/x/u49WObcO/

Bounced off? 
I mean, you gotta find some way to be bullish in a downtrend.
Someone got liquidated 
That is a very poor conclusion, but if you believe that, then best avoid trading.  Just hold, or better yet, put your money in an S&P 500 Index Fund.
On one hand, the reversal during 2015 was a triple bottom so we could accumulate and reverse here. On the other hand, we haven't dropped as much as in 2015. On the third hand, this time seems different from the last crash due to more bullish expectation of the future of cryptospace.

So yeah, it is a toss up.
This! Anyone telling you they know what do to is delusional! 
1) it's about risk management. Period.
2) why are you here?
these ICO's all sitting on huge stashes of ETH got to cash out sometime.  To fulfill the mission of the white paper.  Lol.


People say "everyone" and "nobody" way too much
USD value relates to the purchasing power of BTC. If the technology eventually succeeds and gains complete adoption, sure, its USD value specifically won't matter. However, in that case, a single bitcoin's purchasing power will far exceed what it currently is due to supply being outstripped by demand relative to now. The USD value is, in that sense, a measure of its final purchasing power. 

In other words, sure, a true believer may not care how much USD they can get for a bitcoin, but they sure as hell care about its purchasing power (ie "how many bitcoins does this house cost?"). And for now, since it's emphatically *not* the base currency of the world or even a major player, its USD value measures that.
Well if you are on Bitmex and trading future contracts to increase your BTC stack, you need to pay attention to USD price for example.
It is possible to believe in the future of this tech and yet still want to make USD in the meantime, you know.  As time passes, one should be accumulating both USD and BTC with a view toward a nice Martian property to retire to.
Well, I measure it in USD only insofar as I want to get as much of it as I can for as little USD as possible. My plan is to accumulate until I don't need dollars anymore, figure 3-5 years from now. I also spend Bitcoin whenever I can NOW.

Since this is a trading sub, maybe I should mention that I added a bit to my long from 7280 at 7100. Fully expect a riotous explosion of green starting this week. 
I don't think you should be getting downvoted for this.  It's a valid question.

As stated elsewhere, it relates to purchasing power.  You can value *any* asset in USD, pounds, riyal etc.  You can also trade BTC for other cryptos, so just because fiat is a form of value comparison does not mean it's going to be unsuccessful in fulfilling it's purpose. 
The true purpose is a hedge against deflationatory usd value.  If the true purpose was spending, bitcoin would have a similar control supply algorythm to ethereum.
Well, let us know what you think! Is it going to go up when it's upside down?

https://www.tradingview.com/x/ci5YwJ8N/

I really think if that were the chart everyone would be bullish as all hell lmao
I was trying to do that, but missed a couple of BRDs, while trying to scalp a long.  So now just decided to stay short.  I see no reason why this should bounce hard anytime soon...and if it does, any bounce will be relentlessly sold/shorted.
ya this is bullish af, good for bitcoin 
I hope you're right. I don't think you are but I really *hope* you are. I'm so fucking close to selling everything and never looking back.
Same here! back to 7400 based on the shorts :D
2015
Its called "the bleeding", check out alt charts, this can last very long and can end any time with a BGD. 
people who bought at let's say 2 or 3k feels that they wanna take profits. this makes people who bought at 1k feel like they wanna take profits and repeat

8% is not exponentially.   And there is an altcoin thread for that anyway.
Why do people automatically assume btc is going to rescue dying economies? My friends dad is an expat that’s lived in Venezuela for last 30 years and when he visited the US a couple months ago he said nobody he knows uses bitcoin and he has no clue on how to even buy or use bitcoin. I’m sure there is a good amount of adoption amongst those are savvy enough to understand the tech but bitcoin has a long ways to go to be used as currency even in places where it would make sense. 
What makes you think in case of crisis people rush on the most risky assets?
This is delusional. BTC is going to go where BTC is going to go, according to established market principles. Hope is not going to change anything in the next few months, this ship has confirmed a turnaround to bear market and will take several months of good news to reverse again. 
The influence of that would be minimal with today's adoption rate.

Plus the effect would only be noticed in a few weeks or probably months, people won't turn to crypto in a few days.
URL/source?
No volume to take this anywhere though.
Who's selling? Is it someone manipulating the price or the market panic selling? I'm inclined to think the former. It's easy to drive the price down, not so easy to manipulate the market which will eventually go up if it wants to. And it wants to.
In 2014 we fought. In 2015 we fought until August

We thrived from August 2015 to December 2017

This is no fight. This has so far been a blip on the radar on the log chart
No, it looks like noone is interested in bitcoin.
the delusions are still well and truly alive
Can't speak for anyone else, but that's exactly  what it is for me.
No.  And unless you are the one accumulating massive amounts of bitcoin at “low low prices,” stop trying to convince yourself that a new bull market is just around the corner.  

This isn’t to you specifically, but to everyone who has been suggesting “accumulation” since 17k.  
Lol the delusional are getting confident. Time for a reversal
the psyops are really ramping up now. We must be getting close to the bounce
Can't remember the last time? Your account is only a month old..? It's almost like you're ban evading or something.

In other news, I miss /u/PeaceHere. He disappeared (got banned?) at exactly the same time you showed up.
It's delusional right? So horridly, mindbogglingly delusional, one could even say delusional af.
I think a better question is: who is going to sell? Why would the price continue to decrease? Even with the great dump of January, the downward trajectory only lasted a month. At some point, buyers know a bargain when they see one, big OTC 30-day-term shorts have to cover, little retail shorts pile up and say "Please squeeze my money out of me!" and we get a perfect storm for a BGD or two.
Throw good money after bad? Unlikely. 
Risky but goodluck \- I'd be quick to take profits if i was you, a bounce will come soon imo
How altcoins recover seems to be a good indicator on short term btc/crypto market movement. Altcoins not recovering and going back to March/April lows is not a good sign. Bitcoins maximalist will never admit it but altcoins has been propping this market up for months and in my opinion a key catalyst in reaching ath I’m dec. EOS has definitely had a big effect on the entire market. Then holding large sums of their “main competitor” ethereum is not good since it will continue to have negative effect on the market as they continue to dump it.

now imagine a more likely scenario where people don't put their money in a highly manipulated, illiquid, speculative market during a global recession. 

crypto is only booming because people are much more comfortable taking financial risks than they have in a long time. Look at how well the stock market has performed during the time btc has had its bull run. 

Anyone who thinks these aren't correlated is being delusional; no one will put their money in bitcoin if we see a global recession 
People would not move into speculative volatile assets like crypto in your hypothetical scenario
It stops when the last of these types of comments are made. Holy christ.. 
we're staying above 7000 surprisingly well
Yet btc isn't...which means it's going to fall first
The bottom is very close imo.

And if I’m wrong, I will know very soon.

If we go below 6800 even momentarily, I won’t be longing any dips and will be shorting many pumps.

Until then... I think shorters are wrong, and will wait for the hindsight “I told you so” before I hang up my horns
Or they want us to believe that it's going deep rebound on line support but in fact it's going shortage down?

But now that they read it here that we know maybe change plan!
Obviously at some point its going to happen.

Be my guest in predicting when :\)
Lmao, gave me a chuckle
Lol you should really use your creativity in the right place and environment. Cheers!
I just straight up don't get this analogy. Something had every opportunity but failed because of its choice in friends?
Thanks for the fresh pasta
Thanks for the sentiment data point.
I don't think you understand what blockchain is, so maybe don't act like you know how much it should be valued or can deem what is or is not productive. Clearly, even those who understand it don't know quite how much it's worth.
You seem mad, how much $ have you lost so far?
The bottom is near
Similar to every dip getting bought up quickly on the way up last year.
What’s funny is that:

1. Hedge funds don’t generally outperform the market. See Warren Buffet’s bet with a hedge fund manager

2. Neural Networks are terrible at modelling time series data with few signals, e.g. asset price

3. Traders make money on insider information and nepotism, not because they have some gift of god
I think a lot of potential investors are still very sour about the shellacking they took when the Korea fud happened in January.   

Outside of Korea most of the market briefly recovered after that day but Korean markets were destroyed ---  The so called 'kimchi premium' was gone and considering most people bought into that premium it meant that they would have to wait for the overall market to gain ATH's all around in order to achieve a break even point.

eg:  I use upbit.   a day or two before the k-fud hit I bought OMG at around 38,500krw.  that is the equivalent of 36-37$.   The kimchi premium meant that if you use a Korean exchange then you buy your coins at a premium of between 20-40%.   When the fud destroyed the premium it also destroyed any hopes of even breaking even for many people.

I think there is still a lot of money on the sidelines here waiting for a return of the markets -- but until then most people are simply too sour to the even try to average down....
korea is a big meme like consensus, people just pay attention to them to try to find patterns to make sense of stuff. looks like they're doing 5x the volume of BTC on EOS right now though

but wow i just checked bithumb, didn't realize how bad things were:

https://i.imgur.com/P2r7tZx.png
They were regulated heavily and are not as relevant now.  Much less demand now, just like China, India, Iran, Zimbabwe, etc, etc, etc.
Gonna need an entry price there buddy
!long xbtusd 7060 1x 5&#37;
Me too. They have so many problems right now, I can't even imagine.  Like, when do you close? What do you do with all of your profits? What if BTC goes to 0 so now you have infinite BTC but it's still worth 0???

Glad I'm long
I wouldn't waste your time feeling sorry, we're making plenty of money.
Yeah this money is getting to be too much, I'll have to donate some to charity or something!
How come?
Yes having too much money does create problems.  Just look at all the lottery winners who end up in ruin.
Do you really chad..?
as I understand it, if we go hypothetically to $1000 for one year 

many miners will have net loss => need to quit => less competition => hashrate goes down => cost of mining goes down 

etc. until equilibrium
I think $8K is an average, but not weighted. I believe China is in the $4000s. 

I don't know why the cost to mine would dictate the bottom though. That only works if demand is constant or growing. 
yes cost of production provides a strong base for the bitcoin price. satoshi himself said that the value of a coin will approach cost of production.

8k is not the cost though. i believe it's a lot lower than that. it's hard to tell exactly how much unless you are a miner yourself. there are so many variables at play. it also varies from place to place.
Cost of mining doesn't matter for a couple reasons:

1. Miners don't have to offload when the price drops. Everyone I know who mines (myself included) will mine even under cost due to the assumption that prices will increase.

2. If you think I'm wrong about point 1, it still doesn't matter, because once miners quit mining due to costs being greater than earnings, then the remaining miners (in lower electrical cost areas) now get a greater share of bitcoin, which increases profit, giving more people in those regions to join it. If more don't join, the hash rate decreases, but the coins mined is the same, so ... transactions are the same. 

Basically, it will find its own equilibrium, automatically. It will work if the price is 20k, or 1k. While price does matter to them, they don't set the minimum.
Unlike gold, if miners that mine at higher costs stop, the supply will remain the same, it won't be lower. 
On the other hand you’ll have questions regarding demand. The yearly supply of brand new Bitcoin is going down, so normally having that equation and everything else held constant: the price should move upwards. 
I know this is low effort, but really, sincerely, good luck everyone. This could be a turning point. Some of us are going to lose money. I hope those of us who do are able to cut our losses early enough. Let's try to avoid the gloating around here. 
Christ.  You are a down vote magnate.  All you a guy/gal has got to do is a look at a long term chart (moonmath even) and read your comments and GTFO.  What is the big deal ??  Then again, you could be wrong, but what do I know.
BTC over 5k was wild euphoria a few weeks ago. It was also the site of support during the BCH miracle. If we are playing guess Harveys close:

6000 +200
5500 -185
4800 +350
Jayz? 
Just curious why did I get down votes for my comment...? Didn't think i said anything bad...?
Are we just supposed to trust you on that? Also, what defines "being better"?
Cardano lul
you didn't say anything correct...
Not sure about Cardano part. They still don't have a working product, right? \(did not check it in a while\)
Seen a bunch of posts about Charmander. I have a few thigs to say:

Pikachu is better than Charmander

Blastoise is better than Pikachu

Charizard is better than Blastoise (or will be)

Calm your tits


EOS is better then everything you mentioned , Cardano is just a fancy website for now
I'm very big on Cardano, my strongest position after BTC. Glad to have your endorsement as well. 
cool downvotes.

I would say this is talk without any reasoning, TA or logics. You are just picking random numbers out of your head. And yes, this is crazy...
haha okay 
The only difference is that no one expected it, hence 15k shorts closing in about 2 hours. 

if 15k shorts closed we'd be at 5000 shorts...I'm pretty sure that won't happen

honestly yall expecting a BGD again are going to be waiting forever. kind of like the institutional money...

this could surely go up on its own merits, but the 1h candle we saw was literally historic.. Most volume traded in a single hour in the history of bitcoin 

You will likely not see it again for a while, if ever 
That shit happens *one time* and all of a sudden everyone thinks it's guaranteed to happen again.
Wet
Just don’t understand 6 hours of up. 5rn a pop. Why even bother with the pop if severely shit on every single time. 
These types of comments are entirely unnecessary and unwelcome. Your reputation only gets worse, not better when you rub your predictions in the sub's face. Not only that, but looking at your history all you said was "damp".. Yeah you sure showed us! /s


sure, but as even the biggest trader know there is always a bigger player or a swarm if medium size fishes that coud eat you alive.

Or you can have such big position you need to cover that the funding is not there, or the selling moves the market itself

During the bullrun the price lost touch with reality. This is just the price getting a reality check and going back to sane levels. So the RSI may be oversold for a long time as long as there is a strong trend which this is
So you want to tell me that this have been the good times to sell? [https://imgur.com/a/FM25R7d](https://imgur.com/a/FM25R7d)

Sometimes we only made a mini dip, and how did you know when the RSI was 81, it wont go to 85? And to bring the RSI from 81 to 85 the price has to increase substantially. 
Chewy got a great post about that.

RSI is just something you can see when you open a chart. You see a lot of red, so there was a lot of selling, right? Good time to buy, right? RSI is low then. But when people are in panic mode they sell no matter what, that's the point when RSI can go very low and it's hard to say at which point you should buy in, cause panic can make it go lower.

It was like that on bull run to ATH. We were overbought and yet price was still going up.
Can’t argue with logic
I have a bunch from early last year, SALT, SAND, PPT, PRO, etc.  They are all in positive terrirtory still from when I bought them.  But they are just sitting there.  Plus I have some Bitcoin Gold that I am just staring at every day.
I think the "bull" market has just run its course.  I think if interest rates move up ever so slightly the housing market will come down.  I work for a company that has had wonderful financial results over the past couple of quarters, but they are so far in debt from acquisitions that the increase in rates will drive them back into a cost cutting mode.

I cannot imagine that my company is any worse shape than the rest of the economy.

(I am NOT that naive...I know different industries, different impacts--my point is that I am seeing some stuff behind the smoke and mirrors and it concerns me.)
stocks are both technically and fundamentally fully overblown no?

Amazon’s P/E ratio is through the roof
You ~~gamble~~ trade with your coworkers' money? That's a recipe for a difficult work-environment, IMO...
Do you think there will be a reversal already?
I think we could very well go to 7000 or a little lower.
The most difficult part with alts is to get out of position before they dump again. I decided for myself to stay away from alts before I get a clear confirmation of bear market ending. Maybe won't get crazy gains but definitely less risky strategy.
That's actually really bullish. If you're 2 to 1 short to long a large price move forces people to cover. I'm not sure where you're looking or at what but if you go back to April right before the rally began the short interest was also very high. If you go up to that 9800 top the long interest was very high. Is it bfxdata? That site keeps stalling out on me every time I try and access it
well Eth dropped like a rock as well. There's been some pretty clear manipulation today seemingly with walls and washing trading propping up the price while a huge sell wall got bought into, and once the whale had sold their fill it broke through the wall, went up about $4 bucks, and then abruptly dropped 14&#37; of it's value in 30 minutes.
20,000 ETH shorts added in that drop. Over $10m in shorts.

Someone's planning a party.
Could the new traders be recognizing that ETH has a long way to get to its low last month\(530\-\>380\) and think there is a greater opportunity than shorting BTC? Meanwhile BTC is almost there \(7200\-\>6400\). Maybe it will work out, but they could be in for a massacre if they think it's a guarantee it will reach $380 again.
Thanks for the honest answer. I can imagine the pressure must be bigger with no safety net. You planning to go back?
You quit your job to trade in a bull market and now are having trouble making profits when the price doesn't go straight up? Are you sure you didn't just...make money off the biggest bull run of all time?
Already make enough profit to justify it but thanks for the concern
Yeah this is what I want, feels like im working two jobs now. Not the best life. Thx for answer
As I'm not sure it will fully correct (though it may very well overcorrect) I think i'll start buying in at around 7k with the remainder of my trading stack. Stop at probably 6.7k or so. The r/r would be pretty decent as I'd expect another leg up in the larger triangle and will take profit every 25%. 
What's an iceberg?
that's true, I just normally see at least 700-800 at important resistance areas. I expected to see at least 500-600 somewhere...like $7600 or $7800 or something
Right, that makes sense. I'm surprised that people really just aren't expecting any sort of bounce at all. I hate using actual stops -_-
pretty stupid imo if that happened. just buy up a ton of coins low and then rocket the price 10-15% with a thin ask side.

and then everyone just trades higher like an idiot after it's been pumped even though the price has no good reason to be there, if that happened i'd actually be so annoyed and done with btc lmao. especially cause it wouldn't restart a bull run it'd just delay the inevitable

when did it do this?
It is a descending wedge (I called it a falling wedge). Part of why I'm expecting a bounce soon. I'm tempted to just close, but it really does feel like there's another leg down coming. 7200 keeps getting tested 
The swaps position took 50% profit at 7165. Other order didn't hit at 7115. I'm not looking to go long any time soon.
Hard to say, we're still struggling in this huge triangle and support of it is at 7050 now. It still may go down.
If we bounce hard from support I may add, I'll bail if we break, cause ATH support which we didn't test yet is at 6650, so waaaay down.

Target? Don't really know, top of triangle is above 9k, so I don't think we'll reach it, but barting again to ~7.6 seems possible.

We're still in coin flip territory, almost retraced this whole BGD move, so we look either at huge fakeout because of this short squeeze, or we'll get a higher low and continue up from here.
Below $6800 
>Bear since $14k, it's not over confidence, it's common sense, the hype has gone (for now).

And there's that overconfidence.
> Throw into the mix a bunch of people buying in at ATHs and expecting crypto to act like a never ending Atm, and it's even better.

The bear hopium is just the other side of the coin of the bull hopium. The delusion of wanting to consider oneself a genius getting rich just shorting is no different in principle than expecting never-ending price appreciation.
and who's telling you i'm not a bear either? im definitely bearish atm , but everyone is taking it for granted ,crypto changes really fast and at any time we could randomly start shooting up or some really positive news happen. Like i said this is not bashing bears this is simply a warning to not get over confident
Get out of here with your common sense. We only want bullish narratives!
> imagine someone suggesting ETH be worth $70,000...what's more realistic, $70,000 ETH? or $70 ETH?

That's Ethereum, a project focused on a problem that many people are not even convinced exists. Even most Ethereum proponents are not claiming to compete with Bitcoin or to solve for the hard money use case.

It's hard to argue that gold has better money properties than Bitcoin. Bitcoin is several orders of magnitude more secure, more scarce and much, much lower friction. It doesn't suffer from the immense transactional and storage limitations of gold.
Isn't gold's implied market cap about $7-8 trillion?? What's this about twice gold's market cap? Never been remotely close to that.
or 5 years ago , bitcoin had already reached 1k$ in 2013. And comparing cryptos market cap to golds isn't really logical  but that isn't really my point. I'm just saying that people usually lose their rational thinking when things keep going their way and start getting overconfident and making way riskier trades. More of a warning to people to not forget their stop losses and to try not over leverage. 
100% I am form ethtrader and come here for this trading thread which is the only serious one across all crypto subs..
Also a refugee. This point is important!
Absolutely. I used to frequent ethtrader a lot, but realized how close minded and extremely biased the people are. This thread is so much better.
Very true, I just looked it up and price action is more likely to break through a thin kumo as the support is pretty weak. 
This is what I find scary about this. Stars align for a technical bounce here. Getting into a 1500-2000 LONG position and then market buying 700-1k BTC would be profitable. 
>the bears are so overextend

with this volume, I doubt they are.

>the market is fully manipulated 

yopp, it is! 200&#37; agree
big green dildo, resemblance to a large green candle on the charts
You're being upvoted. Every single one of Stoic Fomo's desperation posts with custom indicators and manipulation theories are upvoted. 

You're just upset that there are smart people who aren't bullish right now. 

The only people I see posting bullish stuff are generally moonbois, to be completely honest.

And the others are simply going long for the r/r despite no real indication of a bullish reversal yet
RIP left nut
Only problem is that the chart arguably says down down down.  There is no indication on the chart of a reversal here.
Denial is strong here, we are going down
Possibly but how high can it possibly reverse unless I’m misinterpreting your reverse as an opportunity for a quick scalp. Nothing on the chart or sentiment side says we have catalysts to break out this nasty downward trend we re in 
What I’m saying is this is 100% gambling. If you have a position that’s in profit, it makes some sense to keep it open
I read it as opening a new short here, not keeping an already opened one. Correct me if I am wrong.
Well I’m technically still in position because I have cold storage that I don’t touch. But I don’t see the point of trading here with *leverage*
I just think it would make more sense to see some sort of reversal even if it’s to 7300 area. Is 7200 that much better of a position than 7300? I can totally see a reversal here but I think waiting till the trend starts makes sense
Yup, those falling wedges can be nice push up (you can draw differently but basically bottom out near 6.8)
The green triple bottom trend line, what current value is it right now ? 
I like it. Not only do we have a new trading signal, the Bart, we also now have a new adjective to go with it. 'Bartier' - the state of a market with more barts than previously
> we should have much more down pressure than that

There simply aren't many coins left to be sold in this price range. It's just stop losses from recent dip buyers and bears trying to outshort each other. Anyone who was holding their buys from more than a few days ago had plenty of time and signals to get out, so they aren't going to be selling unless the floor really falls out and we are dumping through $6000s. 
no, I have not had any success since we dropped below 8k
Im not out the woods yet. Could easily keep dumping. you closed your short at an amazing price point
Holiday weekend in U.S. Most people off from work/school, giant drinking and BBQ day.

Silence before the storm !. Either more down ( as last months ) or a reversal ( Up ).


the price hasnt changed much for 4 days now , what do you expect , people are bored
sideways would be ok for me , alts would explode 
with all the FUD i expected the price to drop to 69xx already , im suprised frankly
Also, as miners stop mining, the hash rate and thus difficulty drops and mining becomes more profitable again until it reaches an equilibrium. The price dropping just means that the equilibrium profitability drops so that for less people it is profitable to mine. It's not an on/off switch, it's a scale.
Couple of them can, but then difficulty will go down and those who left will have smaller costs.
It is risky but a good place to open long, correct. :) 

I am looking for a minimum $300 increase in price at this point, that is definitely my first goal here. 
Cheers mate. I have been underwater in the past for long times during open positions, most of the time ended up closing them slightly above break even. Don't want to close it now after 8 days holding it underwater..

I will consider closing it at a loss if it gets below $6,900 + how it goes below that price. Thanks for your input. 
Your a jerk and who cares what you think! This is a great spot for a long entry it might dip a bit more but it is about to go north as well
;) just closed my ETH short. Always feels good to be right on a position, regardless of the profits. Just glad I didn't lead you on the wrong direction. Hope you can pass it forward in the future!
that should be illegal. Can’t believe exchanges allow competing icos to unload coins

OTC I understand, but what the fuck
Nice short.
The Market isn't one homogeneous group. Speculators are one part of it, hodlers are another, long term investors another, and so on.
Now, now, your cynicism is becoming crude.  This is no different from any other investment market.  People who buy Apple or Amazon stock don't want to contribute to the tech revolution.  They want to be repaid more than their purchase price, full stop.  Crypto actually has quite a few true believers in addition to the speculators.
Sowilo, I wouldnt put too much meaning on those. The same way, 60 day EMA on 1W chart is holding. Has been on every major drop. 1D, 1W, 1H, different on all of them.

I think you should group it on a profile page with a user. Maybe they can have a running commentary on their analysis with their analysis grouped under the trade.

Reason why your entering trade here
!End -> Triggers an append to an open trade

That can then be appended to the last open trade (kinda like TV ideas). My PnL was a 10x position that I slided the leverage up once it was far enough in profit to open other positions. Not sure if it will work in terms of PnL because people are not going to use the syntax properly 100% of the time. That 2000% is just a 20% move. I think it would be cool to see how %age gains people generally go for before closing their position. Leverage fucks it up a little but you can still capture the %age move and then have a table 

ID, Date, User, Contract, OpeningPrice, ClosingPrice, % (w/o leverage), % w/leverage (providing it's being provided in the syntax when opening a position).

Your basically creating a more organized version of this sub. Great stuff my man!
We are very close to the bottom of the triangle. If it holds we can rally to the top again, which will be 8500-8800 depending on how long it takes. Good risk reward if you long 6900-7200 and set a stop at like 6800.
I honestly don’t see $6800 breaking. It may be my inner bull being too optimistic and greedy, but I truly believe we will stop out there. It’s where the bottom of our symmetrical triangle on the 1D support is, and it’s a great place to open a long.

DCA from where I started/ my target entry is a pretty good R/R, where $7155 is only 10% of my entry and $6830 will be 50%. Adding 10% every 75$ or so on the way down. 
>  Makes no sense unless someone has information we don't.

bitmex eth/btc also was 1-1.5% below spot price the last three days (other things like ltc, xrp, ada, bch were still 1-2% above spot). 

Clearly somebody with a lot of money had a "plan."

This could have been said at any point for any price.  


Proposing that ATH buyers haven't already been precipitating out of the market for the last few months and that they all will start at (aribtrary price) is just ridiculous.

  Stop trying.
Eth pumped 7% because it just dumped 15% after already crashing hard the days before. The relevance of any one indicator is meaningless compared to that.
It's dropping a little again.
Risky move. But fingers crossed that you are right. 
i suggest you look at btcusdlongs and BTCusdshorts on trading view

BTCusdshorts have barely started to climb compared with how much BTCusdlongs have been dropping
Hoooopium!
If we bleed / sideways until 6th of June and then actually have a significant move up again, I'm going to be absolutely flabbergasted. 
Now, you are definitely onto something. I'm going to forward test this since the 6th is right around the corner =P
This sounds like a fun project, although I'm not well versed in statistical significance which I have a feeling I'll need to determine along the way. =/ I'll need to have a cutoff for what is considered noise and not noise, right?
Not me -- this was just a backtest, but what the backtest revealed was that 53% of the trades were profitable and of those trades that were profitable, the net profit was 8%.

ETH 1D had like 17 or something I think when it crashed in april. but yeah, BTC is more stable both ways

You never closed that? nice! I was hoping you kept it open. I remember people were like "ooh rekt" at $9750 and I was like damn, hope he keeps it open
A pennant doesn't usually go on for that long time wise compared to how long it's pole is, I'd agree with calling it a symmetric triangle.

That said, tomato tomato. A symmetric triangle is a continuation pattern so would have a bearish bias with a similar volume profile to a pennant.
Well, we're sure going to find out in the next 30-60 days now aren't we...
it might, one big whale can fill all those buy orders. 
People should only hoard corn, and eat sparingly.
I heard there's a special on at the moment, free tickets to goblin town with your corn purchases. 
Thanks! One mans rekt is another mans bread and butter. Do a quick google search for - "open interest financial markets "
you're supposed to buy *after* capitulation, not before. and we're not exactly limited to just one capitulation event
Yes you can see it here that some people are just starting to figure out that BTC may not recover.  It is just occurring to them now what many of us thought since before $20K.

And not saying I'm smart, because I have been an idiot this year with trading and risk management.  But just saying a lot of people haven't cut their losses/given up/capitulated, etc, yet.
Time to sell is now if we are at $6000 in a week.   I'm not saying we will be, but do not assume we won't.
"If you think price is likely going down significantly before it goes back up significantly, then sell"

No way? 
Yes, totally distinct things. The notifications are just usefull for people interested in being notificated in real time on other users positions 
Just go to the history page of the user. You have the link there. 
I won't be showing this table any more, it's just so people realize that the system is working and is already being used.

But you have a point, i could have just put the total number of subscriptions and still achieve my objective without risking this system to be perceived as a contest.


Lol, I can bet 1 BTC that none of top 10 care about how many people follow their trades.
those are the up/down contracts on bitmex right now so I just used those. 

plus if everyone thinks we're going to $6.8k then we'll never get there, right? that's why I'm asking
im a panda bear
Yeah, I've been reconsidering whether these are really all that useful. I mean they're just straw polls so I never really took them too seriously, but I do think it's more useful than simply browsing the comments and seeing what the sentiment is. That's the only reason I ever did it- people said the sub was bearish so I decided to poll and see because I know a lot of people lurk.

I mainly just wanted to see what people who weren't commenting were thinking, because a lot of people who are in profit will comment while people not in profit / worrying about their position will kind of stay quiet for a bit

plus it's just kind of fun. I'm not going to suggest anyone trade on it or anything
Personally I like the polls and seeing the results and stuff. But maybe it's just because I enjoy data and statistics.
What are you backing the guarantee with?
They'll come again when we break out of the 6-12k range.
This is an authoritative response. Thank you for making a clear statement. Press in The United States is making this sound like a very serious issue that's unresolved.

I'm curious how much you've reviewed publications by foreign press about this.
Brazil already took USD as their defacto currency in 1994. That's what's failing; they're unable to keep their currency pegged to the dollar.
Looks like the president folded. I heard this on NPR this morning, and this news must have broken right after morning edition ran the story.

https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/28/americas/brazil-truck-strike-fuel/index.html

I think there's still an issue, but it's not an immediate crisis. If the price of fuel continues to climb then Brazil's  government is on the hook for subsidizing shipping in Brazil. The potential systemic issues that will flow from this deal show them kicking the can down the road.

Edit: Nope, still an issue

> But truck drivers continued to block roads, saying they wouldn't move until Brazil's Congress had approved the tax changes and Temer subsequently announced that the Armed Forces would be deployed to clear the blockades.

It seems tied to a serious lack of faith in government and government institutions.
https://www.npr.org/2018/05/28/614935550/truckers-strike-in-brazil-cripples-the-country
Any perceived stability in an available alternative could be jumped on. Bitcoin is only just getting it's feet wet in Brazil, though. Less than 100k in daily transactions through localbitcoins ATM.

South and Central America are great stomping grounds for anyone looking to arbitrage Bitcoin.
I have it at $7250, so we've been oscillating around this range all day. 
For BTC's major trend, I have 16828, but I was asking a general question. Let's say we are looking at a minor trend, and determining the point where a reversal would occur. Is breaking the ,786 fib retracement level what we're looking at?

*If* that triangle breaks down I'd think 6-6.4 as a buy in wouldn't be good for much more than a technical bounce.

I'll probably consider starting to DCA there though, since who knows where the actual bottom will be in that case.
The thing is that most floors fail. Very rarely do you see trendlines  or major supports hold. It pretty much always breaks through. 
I think you made a very good point, I would like to add a little something to differentiate.

I think buying behavior is different than selling behavior. When the market was going up, we saw a different behavior, but it can't be certain that it will be the same when people starts selling.

Whilst I agree that $6,800 serves as a very *critical* price point, I also believe that if we get to see a push of just as little as $300 (may be a little more or less), it could take the prices to new heights.  

This is what I think. :)
Risky play mate I got 13 accounts and I never disagree with myself 
I think people just like optimism at heart. I mean I get a lot of upvotes because I'm an optimist. It doesn't necessarily mean I'm right and I know that but at the end of the day you have to ask yourself do you believe in this project or don't you? Because if you do the price has to go higher and I mean substantially higher if we're going to have broad adoption. If you don't then any price is really overvalued. I suppose if you've been in the game for quite some time there might be a little cognitive bias because you remember when Bitcoin was a couple hundred dollars and then you look at it today but there are millions and millions more people all fighting over the same coins now
The question is, are bears talking about $3k the equivalent of bulls talking about $20k when we were at $10k, or are they the equivalent of $50k talk when we were at $19k. 
I remember Bulls talking a hundred k. I'm sure 20 was also in there but if you look in the Bear Camp you also have them talking about a realistic retest of the Lows at 6500 and then you have some of these extreme scenarios like 3K which would pretty much collapse the crypto space. 

If we go to 3K we're not recovering. Hopes of institutional money coming in and widespread adoption are out the window. You can't have a coin with a fixed Supply and likely Max supply of around 16 17 million go to that price and have broad adoption. If the space is going to grow the price has to go up. Way up.
so instutions got involved right before a 12 month bear market? doesnt make much sense to me 

im sorry
I know, it is pretty terrifying.  But the whole reason I trade is to increase purchasing power for the bottom (i don't hold any coins atm). So for me as long as I get a good entry, I'm happy.
My point was this: The chart just demonstrates that the market will search out previous bottoms for support?  Which it does do?!  Ignore the fractal if that's what's got you saying that.
The main difference is in 2014-2015 I thought I would never make back my $760 avg/btc and was likely Bitcoin would die and go to zero while now, everybody is just waiting for the bottom so it can moon past ATH which is a dangerous way of thinking. 

In many ways 2015-2016 there was much more potential price wise since crypto had little mainstream attention while here in 2018 bitcoin has already gone to 20k while becoming a household name, which may very well be ATH. 

I commented earlier, half joking that perhaps bitcoin needs to get to a price that an avg middle class investor with a stable job can afford one whole bitcoin in order for us to get back in a bull run. I think that price is around $2-3k. 
go browse the dailies- the poeple here will tell you "it's way different this time!" but if you look at the dailies sentiment looks almost exactly the same. 

tons of bulls calling the bottom every 10% down lol

as for the actual bottom, I haven't looked a whole lot at those dailies 

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/3hjgza/daily_discussion_wednesday_august_19_2015/cu7x0l0/

here's ibb (ibankbitcoins) saying long capitulation/liquidations should cause price to slowly creep up 2 days after the very bottom. I don't think we're anywhere near that yet.

he's bearish right now still:

https://twitter.com/ibankbitcoins/status/1000086176538157058

https://twitter.com/ibankbitcoins/status/1000995469059751936

but note that most of the comments in that thread were bearish expecting a bit more downwards movement.

So I suppose when you start seeing huge long liquidations and completely reversed sentiment where people are actually *happy* the price is going down because they're all shorting then you should start to buy.

still don't think we're there yet. Lots of people knife catching
He's looking at bitstamp; bitfinex had a much larger capitulation wick.
A bounce is 100% possible, no deny. I can envision seeing 8.2 again. Theres really no way to break $6k *without* staying oversold for a while on the daily, though. We've been oversold every time we've been at these levels. But keep in mind, we can stay oversold for quite a while, in the same way we stayed overbought for quite a while on the way up.
spoke too soon
Short long ratio never bothers me. The thing that matter most, imo, is the change in longs and shorts and when the occur. For example, if the price is static but shorts are increasing that is bullish. And if I was out of position I would be buying this hard right now. This is exactly our support line and we have multiple bullish divergences and daily is oversold. The only regret is I thought others would see the same thing so I front runned myself, and that was the problem. I shouldn't have done that as no one seemed to be buying at this point. If I were to have waited and bought now, I would only be taking a 5% hit instead of a 10% hit.
..........that's exactly what rolling with a punch is. You realize you can't dodge it so you adjust yourself so that the punch doesn't hit as hard. Anyway, if your goal is to dodge every single punch just don't even get in the ring.
Yes I think it's correct to extrapolate that. And ETH/BTC have a more or less established relationship that is often discussed in this sub. 

5 percent of ETH total supply... Just wow
Disclaimer: I have no ETH, and the only thing I know about EOS can be summed up with the phrase "unicorn wedding at Burning Man."

I disagree that it makes sense for EOS to try and tank the price of ETH to promote their own coin, much like I felt the same way regarding BCH and BTC.  I said probably some 5-6 months ago that if BCH managed to "destroy" BTC, would you trust the coin that specifically crashed your existing investments?
I lean towards your conclusion regarding "ethereum killing" capabilities of EOS. Literally killing eth not for technical merit, but from controling a humongous supply of it. Buy back EOS with the dumped eth money. Problem solved. 
I know, emphasis on “feel,” though BTC surges in past have been preceded by Alts dumping. 
maybe we're a bit smarter in this sub than the average joe
Thanks for the summary. Added to my short, avg 7350 now, 35% of stack. No stops but will decide whether to close it or add a little more within 8hrs.
i hope whatever it does it moves quickly, this is getting boring lol. although I know it's going to be very slow
Doesn't seem like panic, seems coordinated.

Just speculation.
maybe he is using metric time.
Do you even fib, bro
Exactly, it's holding for now. Still feels risky to go long based on that but now's the time to watch it very closely.

Then again, so many formations have been playing out incorrectly lately.
He listened to me. What a chump!
Ok if it's a poor conclusion give me a 100% accurate T/A that will come true.... or someone that can....
It's absolutely possible that we'll do a 2018. Just speculating here. 
I have yet to see anyone that doesn’t care about USD price. Therefore I will say everyone.
> USD value relates to the purchasing power of BTC.

Why not just measure it by how many grams of weed you can get with 1 coin?  That way the predominate users of the currency don't have to do complicated conversions while stoned.
True.  But lets be real here.  Pretty much everyone just wants to make more USD. Nobody really plans on actually using BTC as money now or in the future. 
> My plan is to accumulate until I don't need dollars anymore, figure 3-5 years from now.

If your plan is waiting for BTC to replace USD as a currency, then don't you find it concerning that during its biggest hype cycle yet that adoption by merchants actually decreased given wide exposure?  Virtually every big name brand has dropped bitcoin by now.
I don't know, kind of looks like a bearflag to me. 
DCB.

The price has plummeted ever since Bitcoins launch :\)

\(Funny graph to see though lol\)
It's looking like a nice 'uptrend' right now, although it seems to be slowing down a bit, if it really were an uptrend I would expect a big breakout soon
I mean if you zoom out the upside-down chart far enough it looks like we should go back to about $100 or so, right. It's a pretty silly exercise on larger timeframes unless you're also flipping fundamental considerations of the asset upside down. So, anyone long-term bullish on Bitcoin should be considering this chart as if they're looking at some fucking dentist coin, and in that case... sure, there's a whole lot of room to go down from this DCB, right?
I aborted my decision, I closed out at 7180 for a slight profit but I'm sensing it isn't actually going to bounce up to the range I was hoping for.
Yeah, I don't always try to scalp for the reason you state and often my "scalps" would just be to take profit on some of my shorts and reload them while maintaining my overall short position but this seemed to be a good opportunity.
This fam this

A conspiracy theory to pump and dump bitcoin is good for bitcoin 
Lol what, I'm not sure you realize where we were at a year ago, try getting that return anywhere else, good luck out there.  Or maybe you thought this was a get rich scheme that you could come in last minute and be a millionaire, again good luck out there, try the lottery or those big single digit percentage safe stock returns, sounds more your style. 
Flair doesn't check out.
Don't. When you have that feeling that's usually when you're really close to a bottom. The next time things are going well and you start daydreaming about Lamborghinis because you just made so much money in the past week. Look for a good place to put in a stop loss. It's just Market psychology it gets to all of us
I get the impression you might be overextended in the market emotionally or financially. Rather than choosing the extremes between fully capitulating and iron-fisting your December bags for life try finding favorable exits to reduce your position until the price of bitcorn doesn't weigh too much on you.
I've probably been in crypto for a similar time period as you and am down on my investment significantly, both through bad timing and bad trading. It might help you to have a look through some old threads from previous bear markets, you'll find many, many posts from people saying similar things.

You've been through two big drops this year and are now in your third. It sounds like you're a bit over-invested so it might be a good idea to take out enough until you're at an amount where you don't feel so emotionally attached to the market and can just let it do its thing.

I know if I could do it all again I wouldn't have put so much in initially and would have bided my time and actually learnt about market dynamics before trying to trade at all. Still, hindsight can be a valuable motivator to improve. 

Whatever you decide to do I wish you good luck. 
I was not around at that time; paint a picture of what that would be like now?
Anything that rises exponentially will fall in a similar pattern.
Because being a lunatic is not a crime.

Crypto itself can change the way currency works and whole payment systems, but BTC won't replace currencies.
That's the causal reverse of what op actually wrote.
Noone assumes that. What people assume is that a shadow economy may form and / or people with money will move it out of the traditional banking system.
It's all bollocks. Cyprus and Greece maybe inspired 5-10 real people to get into BTC. For everyone else it was a fun excuse for a pump. 
I don't know, I just observe the markes. There has been correlation with BTC price increase and currency / banking crises in the past. I'm not even saying there is causality, but that's in the realm of possibilities. 

In an euro-exit scenario, there would not be rush just for BTC but for any commodity, probably. Because you are looking at quite harsh devaluation of you savings anyway.






Look at BTC price and the timeline of greek 2015 situation. 

The effect should be much greater today, as 2015 it caused a decent pump in the price.

General news. Italian bond yields are rising rapidly, which is a risk to banking system, which may lead to capital controls. Many steps still to go, but it looks lot worse than last week.
There is no volume until there is volume. We happened to bounce from 7955 to 8600 last time on basically the same volume we are seeing now.
It's probably going down because it went from 150 to 20K from bottom to top, pre 2013 10K was ultimate moon. 
Umm people who don’t see the risk reward of holding? Cryptotwitter (mostly alt shills) has been saying we re at the bottom for the last 3 weeks and calling anyone who sells “now” weak handed. Yeah well I didn’t listen and I sold and while I lost all my gains (80% usd gains in a few weeks ) + 1.5% I would be down another 40% since then since I was mostly in alts. 
I’m not going anywhere and will get back in eventually but you would be pretty foolish to not consider selling right now. Nobody knows if this is the bottom but market hasn’t looked this bad in a long long time. 
Who’s selling? Anyone who doesn’t want to see their assets decrease in value another 50% over the next 6 months lol. I’d call that normal market price action, not manipulation. Face it boys, it was a fad, a bubble, and it’s bursting in slow motion. Don’t go down with the ship!!!
Is that why you're here?
But for every seller, there is a buyer.   So therefore there are the same number of buyers and sellers and the price isn't really going down.  It is just an illusion.
Interest drops when the price is going down, and increases when the price is going up. If you look at the peaks on google trends for example, they all coincide with bubble peaks.

I only say this because for the last week or so it is 100% clear someone is propping the market up but not trying to pump it.  Just maintaining a price, buying whatever will get sold then taking the next small leg down then repeating the process.  Someone looking to buy a lot as cheap as possible without wrecking the whole thing.  Given the ridiculous sell pressure of the last week we would be well under 7K right now without this... accumulation.
Ah, that old "delusion" chestnut! You guys really need to come up with some new material.
it'll reverse when *you* start shorting
Unless you're the psyop. in-Psyoption!
Denial is still strong, so farther down to go.
Those of us who did that a few years ago are sure glad we did. This is Bitcoin. Capitulation isn't selling, it's throwing your paper wallet in a safe and writing it off as dead money, then finding that it was the best investment you ever made a couple years later (or likely less this time).
I know. Thanks.
I agree with you, I just wanted to share a scenario where a global recession would actually be good for crypto as a whole. I also believe that the market will crash hard when the recession comes.
You do not know the specifics of the upcoming recession. So your guess is as good as his dream.
Edit: my experience with prediction of future scenarios has been: there is always an unexpected twist. Especially in crypto.
A sensible person would act as you describe.  But bitcoin and cryptos are full of koolaid drinkers.  So, who knows what will happen.
Bitcoin is only volatile because demand is relatively low. And it's only seen as risky because of the volatility and downwards price movements. If demand picks up then volatility should reduce and the price should rise or at least stop dropping. We've seen this cycle before several times already.

Just sharing some food for thought, im not saying its gonna happen, i actually belive it wont. We will find out how bitcoin behaves in a global crisis soon enough. My personal opinion is that if anything in the crypto sphere will thrive during a recession, it would be bitcoin, simply because the need for a decentralised currency and freedom from banks would be the highest at that point
whoosh 
The bounce at 7050 was a lot smaller than some of the bounces around 7.3k.

7k is looking like it’ll fall if you ask me.

Edit: Also a lot smaller volume bounce, which is bearish.
i think the number of buyers is the important factor here

when you have a few thousand buyers ready to buy at $7000...you know they are real and aren't just a single whale putting up fake walls to sell into. 

so if they want to breach $7,000...they'll have to actually sell those coins instead of wash trade. 

we are at the bottom on a ton of technical indicators. So not only do you have technical traders ready to buy at $7,000. You also have shorters closing here just in case and noobs buying at $7,000 because its a nice round number. And you also have whales buying at $7,000 because they know if it goes below that, they'll be in for a multi year bear market and won't be able to sell their coins for a good price. Basically at $7,000 there is actual demand to buy

and the sellers just don't have the conviction here, they aren't going to sell after a multi week dump until they know for sure $7000 goes down. 
??? it's just getting closer and closer. 
How does *that* logic work? You expect the ratio of alts to rise during a capitulation?
Out of curiosity, why is $6800 significant? I see this number being thrown around like a frisbee.
Do you think it could go below 6800 and stay above 6000 as a sign of weakness, bounce to 8200+, then extreme down?
I try to put myself in the place of a shorter : what's the risk/ratio to open a short now, and definitely we are too close to the bottom to open safely a short. I won't take this risk if I were them, so that's why I will go long.
Shhh, they are watching us right now 
I dunno about that , so much FUD yet the price doesn't drop much 
It makes me happy to know I brought joy to someone in this time of wo.
Thank you, but what can I say? My pleas seem to fall mostly upon deaf ears.
Omg it’s the new email bro!! It’s as big as the internet was!!
Nobody understands it. We have a bunch of brains with solutions but no problems to solve. It’s a giant rotation of stupidity.
I think he's actually euphoric from gains on his short...
I haven’t lost any money. I just think Crypto in general is so dumb. There are no actual real world use cases. Just a bunch of boneheads arguing over a whitepaper and claiming their coin will win. Win what? There is nothing to win. This is all a big waste of intelligence.
You mean the irrational FOMO bubble of 2017?
Korea def wasn't a meme last year they were buying crazily

You just have to cover at $0.01...don't get greedy and wait for that last penny or you end up with nothing.
Yes, the things that are about to happen to them are truly horrifying.
Yeah that's what I was thinking at first but wanted some input.

Adding on to your point, and excuse my ignorance for not knowing the exact science, but if the hashrate goes down significantly, will the bitcoins not be mined a lot quicker and then saturate the market even further, in turn keeping the price suppressed even longer than anticipated\- until as you say equilibrium is reached through organic adoption?
Thanks for the explanation. I agree with you on point 2, but point 1 would only work for 'individual' or small scale miners. Big mining farms have to pay back equipment costs so they offload very soon after mining I think.
It's stepped down and there have been plenty of chances to get out.  I hope folks are taking care too, but yeah let's light this candle.
This sub is small enough to wish everyone good luck without it being a trivially pointless gesture.
Weeks?
The morale is extremely low which means people rage downvote anything, which means it's probably the local bottom and after a 200$ "run" we'll have the moontalk again.
Psy ops accounts. They want people to short or buy
your comment seems to read as if you cant understand that there are a plethora of people who are still very far into profit who want to finally sell and get out after witnessing the market turn quite bearish.
they do
I’ll take a closer look and post something witty
You may want to research Cardano a bit more. They solved PoS a few weeks back. I certainly wouldn't call it "just a fancy website".
You might want to not get in a fight over technical merit with this guy given he has one of the most in depth understandings of cryptography of anyone in this sub. You can argue marketing and other aspects of each coin, but I'm guessing he knows more than you about the code side of it
To be totally honest, you should LOL. I entered at 10,000 and need serious help. Laughing is mandatory:)
Is it spot or a margin long
when the errand boy runs around asking the whales for tax ID numbers the party's over.

Still this 7250 area seems to be support.. somebody's buying.

Same thing with crossing under the 50EMA. It doesn't make sense to me to be everything just on that. 
2014 also happened one time and still people think it'll happen again.

it's so hot i am wearing just a banana hammock
The ones you have marked there are the peaks, there's no bearish divergence yet. Once the price pushes up to a higher point on a lower RSI then you have a bearish divergence and it is time to sell, which on your graph would exactly have been good times to sell.
I don't really know; I'm eager to learn because I have recently made some sizable index fund investments.  


Do you feel the overall market is fundamentally overblown? My understanding is that earnings are generally very strong, which would make sense as wages have remained stagnant and inflation is only now starting to pick up a bit.
They were both friends I have had for much longer than we have been working together.  But the potential relationship issues is why I returned the funds.  When we were at 7600 I was as certain as you can be that we were going to continue to drop.  Like I said, now that we have gotten where we are, and the way he have gotten here, I no longer feel as certain with the market's direction which is why I returned their funds.  I'd much rather have gotten them a 50% return and be sure everyone is happy than continue trading in a position I feel less sure of that could have maybe doubled their return but which had a good chance of wiping out their gains/part of their principal if it went the other way.
They gave him 5 euro ;)
well that didn't happen. so don't sweat it. more fake btc posts. lol
I am actually a 100% ETH trader and I am also waiting to buy back in. Currently I am in fiat. I am pretty sure we will see 4xx again. 3xx not so much though.
Yes, the only problem with that is that longs still outnumber shorts by quite a bit. 

If the open interest continues to increase, whichever side piles on more and more while the price hardly moves will probably be the ones to get trapped. Right now it is about equal. Shorts have not moved up that much since $8k
The word is that EOS sales caused this, and I myself watched the ETH drop precipitate the btc one.

Of course, that's ALWAYS the word... So yeah
Sort of. I've been working on something that will let me put trading back on the sidelines, but it'll still take another 2-3 months. That's in crypto again, so, maybe I'll check out but never leave :)
I've made some nice trades within the bear market, made a really accurate call when the market retested 10k and ETH bouncing off $360 recently, but one problem is I'm not on an exchange which offers margin short positions and not willing to move over to another exchange. Taxes in the US also killed my interest in trading crypto/crypto pairs which luckily I stopped doing a while ago. And so, this means my fiat is my short position, and like I said I have savings, I got my sell in at 19.4k, my best buys were between $200-$300, was also very early with Ethereum (was trading it while it was still worth like $3). So what more could I ask as a young and pretty new trader? If it was the biggest bull run of all time, then great, I got the killer swing trade in. I'm very frugal as it is regardless how how much money I have available. The experience in money management and risk management is what's really valuable, I learned everything I could about technical analysis along the way, making money just doesn't seem like a big deal now, I'd like to just be involved in the space and put some greed aside (and perhaps alleviate some of the Crypto PTSD!). 
And just to add

1.) Since when does the price go straight up? Only during blow off tops? 2 years is a lot of time man, this has been a wild ride and I was not just hammering the buy button over and over again the whole way, my goal as a trader was always to scalp profit and manage risk, while simultaneously maintaining and holding onto positions that have a much longer time horizon. In 2 years I've completed well over 10,000 trades.

2.) I don't think many traders enjoy trading bear markets, they would rather just stop and wait, where is the shame in this? Every trader has their seasons.
You're not alone. 

It takes just 1 swift catalyst to flip this on it's head.

Woops, I glossed over that in your post. 7200 keeps getting tested but it's holding surprisingly well. Not sure what to make of anything given that buyers are maintaining support fiercely but don't seem interested in carrying the price any higher either. I've gotten stopped out a few times in the past few days so wary about setting stops this go around, but I also don't want the time that I don't set stops to be the time we get a real deal big green candle and I get completely rekt :|
Around 7050 is line from higher lows, around 6650 is ATH line, why 6.8?
Well he's right. There is nowhere near the hype around BTC (or even crypto that there was a year back). Granted we were in an insane bull rally. But we have been in a bear market for a long time now and people are still in denial about that and I'm sure people are expecting us to just break 8.2K, 10K, 11.7K all in one go and carry on our merry way to ATHs. Not saying that's all permabulls either I think it's mostly people who don't trade at all and are relying on nothing but hope.

God knows how many down-votes people were getting by warning people when we had 4K 4 hour candle but nah this was going to 100K. Then on the initial bulltrap - 'Just a set back we need to correct further'. 6 months later we're down like 65% with lower highs and lower closing lows and people are still bullish, we could fall 50 from here to around 3.5K and the correction would just be like an 82% correction from the top with the 6K being a 70% correction An extra 12 % extra doesn't sounds like a lot but it'sfrom ATH so its a lot from here. Granted last time we had the BGD but the market was primed for a bounce like that with the trader sentiment being what it was at the time then someone with a lot of money took advantage.
and a very few *do* get rich off of it. the time to worry is when *everyone* starts getting paper rich off of it
WTF are you talking about?  This daily thread has been a constant stream of short positions opening for months (with a short term bull that returned 100% if you forgot).  I understand the allure of perpetual shit-posting but, maybe pump the breaks a little.  
yes that is my point

btc at $1,000,000, if the market cap increased linearly with price, would have a market cap of (1,000,000 / 20,000) * 327,000,000,000.

this would be 16,350,000,000,000 which is $16T. twice that of gold market cap

I may have phrased it weird. what I meant was "there's a bit of a difference between the price from 1 year ago to a price that would mean a market cap twice that of gold"
Yea I get your point I just think people calling bears calling for $1k delusional are being a bit dramatic. $1k wouldn't even be "failed experiment" levels for bitcoin. it's a bit of a stretch but it's quite different from calling for $1mm...
Man, it's fucking cancer over there now.
You're also using standard settings. 20, 60, 120, 30 has the cloud down in the 4K's. 
I think such position will be more than profitable. Moreover, I think most of the traders are currently waiting for of a confirmation of trends direction before getting into positions. This could really trigger and heat things up. 
We're certainly due one of them, roll on the dildos
Reasons aside, he may be right. We may have local bottom here just to crawl up this triangle to 9k again.
I don't think so
How does it make sense?
That's what I said.  

It's like "Buy, sell, or hold".  That is irrational nonsense too. If the advice is sell, then you sure wouldn't hold.  And if the advice is buy, then you would hold if you already had it.  So "Hold" by itself is illogical and so is the advice above.  Don't buy here, because the price is not likely to increase, but if you bought 5 seconds ago, then of course hold...because the price is not likely to increase.

It's amazing how some people's minds work (or don't work).
About 6900 in Bitfinex
About $6988 On Finex and rising, but not that sharply....only about $7 per day.

Also I see it could also be at $6900 if you choose the bottom of the $6420 wick.  I have it cutting through that to get more points of contact, but could go either way with it.

I guess that's a good place to buy or cover a short, and of course short it hard if it breaks.  Although has been some fakeouts like that lately.
agreed
Time for that vaca! :D
Trading chop is harder. I got some hits lately, cause I thought it's gonna reverse, but made it all back.

Really, 1-2% stop, 4-5% gain, repeat. There's no sense in waiting in position for better gains. We're not out of the woods yet so it's better to take small wins and cut losers fast than hope for big win.
Thanks! Got lucky to wake up at exact time of BTC dump.
oh so that's why
Why would BTC stagnate and alts go up? If anything everything would freeze, no?
What FUDs?
Yeah, thank you very much for your insight yesterday. Boy was i wrong. 
Wild Wild West 
Don't see you complaining when likely manipulation caused BTC price to pump on numerous instances in the past. 
Should be illegal, but a lot of people here hate regulation. It's time like this when they should realize regulation is not that bad.
Posted it in ethtrader a few days ago got downvoted to oblivion, but he who laugh last laugh best 
I think it's safe to say that anyone that bought or held since $3k is a greedy speculator. 
I think in general the belief in the adoption of the tech is an excuse to be excessively greedy. 

The people who truly believe in the tech generally don't care about the money or the price. vitalik, charlie lee, andreas, etc all avoid that "froth at the mouth" kind of talk when speaking of crypto. that doesn't seem to be common for the average market participant lately

I'm not saying *everyone* involved is a greedy speculator, I'm saying the majority of market entrants from, say, $3k have been extremely greedy and extremely impatient. 

Just go take a gander around and look at why people have invested. Read the trollbox, read crypto twitter, read /r/cryptocurrency, /r/bitcoin, etc. It's all a big cult full of people who think they're going to get rich in 6 months. 

It is very different from every other investment market because there is usually a higher barrier for entry. There is a reason the stock market has been more heavily regulated since the dotcom boom - the average joe is a terrible, greedy investor and needs to be protected from himself.
lolz
it's unlikely the triangle will continue to hold after this. we either break down here or we're busting up through it if we get that high. or the triangle will be invalidated entirely 

a triangle that gets to the end without a breakout/breakdown loses all of its "coiling" momentum

everyone is also assuming we get a bounce off the line but there's a decent chance we just dump through it 
You literally stated my plan, posted above.

It’s one of the smartest longs on this entire run after the BGD 
Do you have stops set? I feel like a break below 6800 is a clear break of our equilibrium triangle. If we do break it, I feel we'll enter into a new trading range and could be difficult to get above $7k again soon, similar to how we haven't seen $14k since we broke though.

Its a solid plan though, with a good R/R
I really think it’s EOS waging war. I realize that makes me sound a bit nuts, but those guys are fucking criminals in my book and they have about a million ether IIRC.

Edit: additionally, they’ve used BFX in the past to dump their ether and EOS/ETH just got a nice bump. I’d be amazed if Larimer isn’t in prison in 3 years.
Smart money doesn't distinguish between one digital beanie baby and another, it views them all as a fad.
It's not the bottom though



It's going to be 420 to 480. Want to bet on it?

The short target on eth/btc is .03
Someone else who thinks they can accurately predict the bottom

Just like those here calling the bottom for BTC at $16k, $14k, $12k, $10k, $8k and now.... 

*EDIT - hahaha what a surprise, and down eth goes again 
i got same gig going with 12 btc position. praying for us.
Yes, you're absolutely right! The finer details of why it bounced there are not really important.
Yeah, I don't expect that this is the *pump*.  Just algos kicking in because it's an important level (ETH).
I can feel it... this is going to be one epic ass trade.

https://i.imgur.com/bSFlswK.png
At least a first step would be eyeballing the histogram.  You'll be able to visually see if it's noise or if there is a pattern quite quickly.

But yeah, if you want to then prove a statistically significant outlier (if it even matters to do so), you'll need to look into p-values.

Anyway, you need to *at least* run this in an unbiased manner on other dates if you haven't.  Because if you go back over most pairs of dates over bitcoins history, you'll probably end up in profit.  Like how a trading bot basically cannot fail during a bull run.  And from last november to January, I knew a few people who just blindly bought in the morning and sold in the evening every single day.


If you send me the data I'd be happy to analyse it. What I'd need is all the combinations of dates, as well as each datapoint for that combination (%profit vs loss) :)
8% is pretty nice with such a simple algorithm. On what time period did you backtest?
This is a really important distinction because a lot of traders DO NOT win +50% of their trades, but the trades they enter have decent/good r/r meaning the trades they win yield really good results and the trades they lose (which could be more than 50% of their trades) have minimal downside. This is the characteristic of a good trader; being able to identify these trades.
Like your username, I am personally counting myself blessed by this downturn. I missed out on cheap coins since I did not start with bitcoin until this year.   So this is an excellent opportunity for me to accumulate more coins before it goes up again.  
Yeah I'd actually added to it at $8500 and $7500 but forgot to update the bot. 
Barring an act of god, I think it’s safe to assume it will break down. The optimism must be ruthlessly beaten out of this market.
Done and Done, but I still don't see your link between RSI and building open interest?
None of what you said has to do with open interest. 
Ok... kind of a non-sequitur seeing how I specifically stated I wasn’t offering trading advice. 
Right on, thanks. I'm slow though, where do I see that table?

Nice work with push bullet, i use it all the time. 
The history page on Reddit ? I don't see the link there. Am I missing something ?

Nah, start doing hourly updates and make it a contest

If you like my content please subscribe to me on bitcoin trading bot
Actually it's gone straight to my head. I'm starting a trading group, 10 btc to enter, pay me up front for access to my private telegram
Gypsy has a sense of humor I would be shocked if he was dishonest about numbers on a screen feeling good.


come on, I'm sure one of them cares...if it was you at the top of the list instead of chewtoy, you'd be patting yourself on the back(maybe not publicly, but you would)

the fact that they bother posting their trades publicly using the bot is reason enough that they care

so you can go ahead and send that 1 BTC to 1PascJV39rUsG7MksakXxQn9HN7bU2m9nq
I see.

Well, all other things being equal - for a poll, i don't think it makes sense to structure the two options in that way.
There's no good way to do that, I think. There's too much of a mixture of lurkers, apathetics buttcoiners, alt shills, confirmation bias and general vote manipulation. Asking a few pointed questions and explicitly asking the entire sub to respond in detail or vote for a corresponding comment is probably better for gauging how 'the sub' is feeling. Still though, wildly inaccurate and imprecise at best.
It's just hard to believe the numbers represent the actual population or traders or participants in this sub. It's a mixed bag, I guess. It can be interesting but ultimately it can be misguiding if you put any faith into its accuracy. Not all traders visit this sub, especially non-English-speaking ones. I have a hard time seeing the value but I guess I don't mind either, though it's a bit spammy maybe.

So when do you expect $12k+? I think the end of June is very attainable. We haven't had a good doubling in a month for like 7 months now. 
None at all unfortunately. The international press is infamous for blowing out of proportion anything related to Brazil. I am Canadian and have been living in Brazil for over a decade. Absolutely any good news coming out of Brazil gets filtered out by  North-American media. I was blown away by what I saw when I first arrived here. It’s not *nealry* as bad as the typical “Brazil” stereotype. There is a large number of safe cities to live in, many of which surpass by a huge margin the majority of towns in Canada that I’ve been to.

I’ll give you just an example. For roughly US$300k you can get yourself a 7500 sq ft 3-story house, made out of *concrete*, instead of cheap plywood. All this inside a gated housing condo with multiple tennis courts, soccer/basketball fields, on-site manicure, hairdresser, state-of-the-art gym, private security, and you can hire whichever architect you want to design your house for you and choose who’s in charge of building it. It’s not like in Canada where you’re given a catalogue of cookie-cutter wooden houses to pick from (e.g. My old neighbor’s house is Canada was the exact same model as mine, except it was a “mirror” of it, inverted horizontally). To top all this off, it is ridiculously cheap to do the interior of your house. Granite countertops in many cases are cheaper than wooden ones, for example. 

If you’ve ever gone on a regional flight anywhere in North America, Europe or Asia, you might well have flown in a Brazilian-made aircraft. Embraer is the world’s largest regional aircraft manufacturer and the third largest overall, behind Airbus and Boeing. It also has the safest flight record among all aircraft manufacturers by a wide margin.  Not bad for a cheap third world sh*t hole that North-American media hammered into my mind, leaving out things I was never aware of.

If you got a dent or scratch on your car, service is cheap, you’ll pay anywhere from US$100 to $300 for a typical, quality body repair job. Larger ones scale proportionally. In Canada, if you buy a brand new car for $30k, in two year’s time it’ll be worth about half of that. In Brazil, vehicles hold their value much better. I recently sold 2-year old A3 for $10k less than what I paid. Granted, vehicles an electronics in general are much more expensive here due to tariffs, caused by corrupt government policies, not to mention copious amounts of bureaucracy. Despite all this, it is still the world’s fourth largest vehicle market.

I’m getting a little off topic here, but if you want to know what’s really going on in Brazil, you need to check out actual Brazilian news outlets (several, not just one). Right click->translate to English if needed.
Using bitcoin is still rough, you can swing 20-50% in a matter of weeks. 
[deleted]
Brazil is a mess. Look at their elite : their president is a fat corrupted israeli, and the head of the central Bank of Brazil is another one fat corrupted israeli. It seems that "country" is in good hands. Chaos. Corruption. Ultraviolence.

100 years ago Brazil was a wounderful place. It's all gone. Europe will be like another big Brazil in 50 years from now.
$4.8-low $5s back to $7-7.8k, you heard it here first

ppl will be despondent as fuck and it'll bounce hard then come back down again
I just posted this in another discussion, but its appropriate here too:

If we assume the floor doesn't hold, after the intermediate support levels, we will hit the long term trend support at 3.5k, which is a 50% drop from where we are now: https://www.tradingview.com/x/lcwPQyYW/

The question you should be asking yourself is if bitcoin can justify a 3.5k price tag, which is 3x higher than the peak from 2013. Or put another way, can you justify 3.5k, which is 18x higher than the floor we discovered in 2015 (which was around $200)? I know we have a lot more consumer interest, but those consumers all got burned badly when they bought in. They had friends telling them bitcoin is a scam, and now they're gloating about being right. Without mass consumer interest, we will need real world uses for bitcoin to grow in value. Does anyone see major adoption right around the corner, or do they think it will take time?

At any rate, I don't know where the floor is. I don't make claim that I know where it is. I'll use TA to decide when to buy back in, and there is a weak signal right now, so I'm not buying right now, especially not with 50-50 chance of a massive selloff looming.

Waiting for confirmation of direction is OK for short term buying, but as we recently saw, we could be going through another 1.5 month long DCB and then drop even lower.

Long term "buy and hold" is on hold for me till the price settles, but I may do some day trading stuff while I wait.
The daily is so oversold right now, if we do fall through there isn't far we could go. If there is a fall through this support I expect a bounce first at least.
> If we go to 3K we're not recovering. Hopes of institutional money coming in and widespread adoption are out the window.

On the contrary. 3k is what institutional money is waiting for. BTC will bottom when everybody starts to think that it can't recover ever again.
> some of these extreme scenarios like 3K 

3K is not an extreme scenario at all.  The price was 3K less than 1 year ago.  It is never "extreme" to have 0% change in price in less than one year, especially not with a 100% speculative asset like Bitcoin.

That is what the bulls are incredibly delusional about and may be a very hard lesson to have the obvious come crashing down on them before long.
I don't think 5,555 is an unrealistic buy target tbh.  Institutions will just load up their bags with even more. Same again at 3k.  No one knows what is going to happen.
They're probably not involved at least in a large way.  They may be, other than a bear market, one of the reasons it is slowly trending down.  They may like to load up too.  Although, this is not the way it will unfold (it could) it is in line with my thinking that we will hit b/t 3k and 4k.  I don't care about the fractal.

Another way to look at this is to take a look at the moon math charts.  We could still be in a major uptrend even if we hit $3.7k by July or even lower if before July.

We would just start riding a lower channel which i think we broke through when we dropped through the 50W MA.

Good times, and for long term holders, and belief in BTC, this is an opportunity to double your exposure for the long haul.

Yes. Smart people don't always make the best investments. 

Do you guys really believe that these people are infallible and everything they invest in is 100% profitable?

Look up theranos and its investors or look up Alan Greenspan defending the housing market before the bubble popped

Hell, look at poloniex. Acquired by Circle/Goldman and they're dead now when they used to be the biggest exchange 

There's a reason most institutional money avoids bitcoin - it's completely unreliable 
Institutions are here to make money off the traders. They can do that at 1k or 20k bitcoin. 
I do not see how it encourages increased levels of purchasing power, quite the opposite actually!
!short LTCBTC .01563 10X 3.33%

LTC basically has no support below 0.0155. I don't see any reason for it to bounce much higher, will add higher later. Complete free fall below 0.0155 to at least 0.01 or possibly much lower. it's the only alt that hasn't really capitulated 
The thing is, I agree with you that it's increasingly looking like 6k won't hold. But thinking that we will drop down now and staying short while we bounce and see several green weeks again is a bad trade and is purely because you are biased. It would be way too oversold already at 6k for it to break, that's not how bears would really want to play it. Even in 2014 it never was oversold more than a couple of days. A pathetic bounce upward with no momentum and volume would be ideal. 
In my opinion, this guys are in for the quick buck. One of the founders has founded several cryptos without commiting to one for the long term (he'll probably do it again later with SUPER-EOS or something). One of the other founders does unicorn weddings...

I wouldn't be surprised at all if this was their strategy.
I don't think they're "proceeded" by dumping alts, usually alts sell into BTC momentum hoping to ride the wave and repurchase with a crushed ratio.  
no, BTC was the one that started to surge by itself, and then alts started selling into BTC to hop on the bandwagon 




!short ETHBTC .083 10x 3.3%

!short ETHBTC add .078 3.3%

h&s on ratio and USD pair, looking to close around $400-450 possibly, forgot to add this to the bot
Hmmm... No.

There have been huge hidden sell orders at 569 and 574 all day long - you can see them. They sold tens of millions of ETH through them. It wasn't enough though, and they put in larger and larger walls, last wall was 510.30.

No one with that type of $ is coordinating haha - they don't need to they are the market.
because people are watching short term time frames. no one realizes yet that the market is in a different state than it was 4 months ago. 


4 months ago you could trade on 15m time frame because volume and short term volatility was high. Now it's all about longer term trades and formations. 

If this entire move from $7800 to $7150 happened in one go we wouldn't have nearly as many knife catchers, but everyone is so used to there being bounces and stuff along the way and they're not used to larger formations being the only reliable pattern s

so far all of the bear flags and pennants and shit from $9k have played out. People just like to look at the 15m chart instead of the 4h...

there was a guy here who used to legitimately draw trend lines on the 1m chart lol 
you don't need to be 100% accurate to be profitable. 

But the smarter traders trade less to reduce the amount  of times they can be wrong. Betting on the trend being down has so far been incredibly profitable and lots of smart people here have done it 
Buying high and selling low makes a profit

And you moved goal posts and everyone noticed
I suggest subscribing to The Chart Guys on YouTube and educating yourself on what TA can and cannot do!
How would you "see" someone who doesn't care about USD? People on reddit say they don't care about fiat whatsoever all the time, I'm guessing you just won't believe them? Btw some people in the world don't use USD and BTC has helped them find stability as their currency hyper inflated, you don't think some of them are only thinking about finding more BTC regardless of its value in USD? Then we could mention miners, they only need to know that their operation is profitable enough to cover expenses, I'm sure many miners pay no attention to the price until a specific threshold is broken. People who are invested but out living their life without stressing over it don't care about the USD price. I think there are many examples and grey areas.
Lol
I have done and will continue to do so.


Speak for yourself ;)
USD, EUR, CNY... I plan on accumulating more BTC now and in the future and I just use the currency I pay taxes and milk as a benchmark. Because unless the government or the milkman starts accepting btc I'm forced to use fiat as the benchmark which has nothing to do with what I expect from bitcoin.
Maybe if you're from r/bitcoin. Elsewhere I see the goal to use crypto in the future.
I don't care about name brands. I want a house and a boat in some tropical paradise which I could already buy with Bitcoin. What's my exit plan? Bitcoin.

Edit -- also, the dollar has some pretty severe systemic problems. I have more faith in Bitcoin than in the dollar right now.
bear flags are  usually channels- this one is clearly hitting resistance and looks like it wants to break through (imo)

i remember when this all started in around feb everyone tried calling it a bull flag for the longest time tho
It does, doesn't it? Looks like it could breakdown at any moment. So if you are going to sell that, that means you should be buying right now. 

But staring at it longer, it also looks like an ascending triangle, which would be bullish (bearish). 
A bearflag? That's a very nice bottom and reversal pattern and looks very much like it's going to have one more small retracement and then a breakout the next time it touches resistance. 
The point of inverting the chart is not finding the bottom (or top), it's to remove your directional bias by looking at it from the other perspective. 
So far seems like a good call.
I don't think it's a "get rich scheme" bro, that's stupid. I think it's an emerging market with lots of potential for growth. The lottery also isn't my style because with the lottery you have a one in a million chance of winning, with crypto it isn't that bad. Stop taking what I say to the absolute extremes.
the poor guy bought the top and got fucked over by a bear market, have some sympathy. He's no less worthy of ridiculous gains that anyone who bought before $5k got
I didn't realize I had to be locked into my position for the rest of my life.
[deleted]
Good idea. 
2015 was far, far, far more dead than it is now. We're a long way from that yet and I really hope we don't get there. This place often had no posts for 4-6 hours. There was absolutely nothing worth commenting on. 
https://bitcoinwisdom.com/markets/bitstamp/btcusd

September 7, 2014 on the weekly is where we are now. 
The price floundered around the same level for months. Like the poster below said there was nothing worth commenting on. This was after the price peaked in 2014 and then abruptly fell. If you were a bag holder after that you were an idiot. I saw it as an opportunity, or a second chance to accumulate at affordable levels. This is what we are experiencing now although I don't believe it will last as long. If it does last as long then it would be wise to take advantage of it.
The only thing bitcoin will change at 3 transaction per second throughput is how easy it is to commit fraud.  For everything else there's MasterCard.
Yes but with back then's marketcap, a country like Greece could have an impact on price, on today's market, let's say 1-2 million new customers (which is way over what the real figure will be) won't have that big an impact.

It'd be Incredible if it happened don't get me wrong. If normies turned to crypto even at a small scale in Italy, it'd make many more people in Europe follow, but we're not there yet, give it a couple more years.

Enterprise come first, then domestic market.
so where do we do a 100x long on those rates while shorting their markets ?
What do you mean the price isn't really going down?  Price is all based on perception.  The price of bitcoin could drop $100 without a single trade simply because of a change of perception of value.  Markets assist in price discovery but there doesn't need to be a transaction for the "perceived value" to drop.
it takes time to get nervous and even more time to get coins onto an exchange from cold storage.  Or, yeah, you're right and goldman sachs is walking it down so they can buy $10billion at $2k.  Not a joke from my perspective...both or probable i suppose.
Not sure what you are looking at. Sell pressure has been pretty light, there's just no buyers. All you have to do is look at the volume.
Yeah like the *"whales are manipulating this market..."* right?
Well sure, but that's different than doubling down in an attempt to influence the market. 
well yea it'd be fun to get filthy rich :p 
You truly believe people will put their money into extremely risky assets during a global recession? That that guess (more like a fantasy) is as good as mine? 
It's pretty easy to spot what the recession is going to be about. Dollar destroying every other currency, debt bubble popping due to dollar denominated debt (especially in EM), commodity boom + inflation spike in the next quarters, zombie corps going bankrupt because they finally can't borrow for free, oversupply because of overinvestment (because free money), low demand because no wage growth, oil tanking (already started) ==> Deflation which should have happened years ago 
Crypto has literally never existed during a financial crisis / economic downturn. So there's no precedent for it to surprise people. It's not surprising at all that a risky asset that gives potentially incredible returns has flourished during an economic boom 
but we're not talking about people already invested in crypto, we're talking about normal people
the bulls have been raped and battered. so of course you'll have weak bounces until they get their confidence back or until some whale decides to BGD this thing. 

if they buy 2000 BTC up until 7400...there'll be just 1000 BTC for shorters to panic buy into 
Smaller volume dump also. Just no volume anywhere really.
"we are at the bottom on a ton of technical indicators"

Time to remind you that this had been said by various people all the way down from $14k
This is a bunch of pseudo-analysis. 
6800 was the start of the BGD
Wouldnt surprise me, anything is possible
A lot of resistance on the way up, down we have around 7050 and 6650. If the second one falls then we'll find a new bottom.

R/r for short now is a bit shitty, it was a lot better yesterday, but long is not much better.
Not much FUD around anything other than price action actually.
Not sure about that mate but yeah you are a good writer!
Oh plenty of people understand it, so don't go projecting just because you don't.

Also, your statement is nonsensical. By definition, there is no solution without a problem; if it's a "solution without a problem" it's not a solution.
I will agree that most of the projects in this space are stupid.

But if you can't see the value of bitcoin then I don't think you are looking very hard. 

I'll give you one for free. There is an asset which can be taken across borders, in any quantity, all while existing solely in ones memory. Which asset am I talking about?
get lost dickwad

then why are you even here lmfao. you're preaching to the choir and wasting your time. go to /r/buttcoin and you guys can jerk each other off to oblivion.
This really isn't a place to debate that, we are traders who are trying to make a profit from this thing
Dash. Alt36.  Go look it up.
It was more outright market manipulation than FOMO, imo, but we may never know for sure.
nah I agree I just mean people only mentioned them randomly to make up random reasons for pumps and dumps
easy, just get multiple Lambos!

Good luck covering at $0.01, and then having time to send it to an exchange that allows fiat conversion before that last cent ticks off.
Iknow paying tax on the profit will be a truly horryfing experience
> will the bitcoins not be mined a lot quicker

hasrate goes down => mining difficulty will also be adjusted

new blocks should be produced on average on 15 minutes intervals (according to a statistical Poisson process).

I don't know how exactly this is implemented in the code.

Difficulty can only be adjusted every 2 weeks (or every x number of blocks). 

This is just a vague sketch of my understanding of the matter. I am not an expert.



Bitcoins difficulty is recalculated every two weeks-ish based on total hashrate for the network (chart here: https://fork.lol/pow/retarget)

In your scenario, if hashrate drops as mining is not profitable anymore, then difficulty will also drop in the next retarget as blocks will no longer be mined at a 10min avg rate. 

If this is followed by a large influx of hash power then there might be a short-term higher influx of btc into the ecosystem, but in reality, such a scenario will likely never come into play.
Big mining farms who have overextended themselves might have to immediately sell. But if you have funds to build a 60M operation, you should have planned for times when the price dips too. It's not like that should come to a surprise for anyone. Investors would require it in the business plan.
Your sell at $8600 not lookin so bad now huh? :)
Those are American style odds.
But get out now? Especially after experiencing a sliver of the potential of what it can do last year.
Big Cardano fan, but theyre pretty far from having a working product. Theyre still 100% centralized and the testnet for smart contracts only just launched today..
Lol solved POS. Nothing is solved until it's on a working blockchain.
Lmao, are you drunk?
You bought at $10k and you want to know where to sell? When did you buy? And how much can you afford to lose? 
Yeah I overreacted to that yesterday because the realization that a true bear market *might* be upon us just clicked. But I didn't sell. It's bearish for sure but I am all level-headed now. I'm still watching the market closely (which is boring today by the way).

What support lines are you looking at if not a secret?
What site are you using? I haven't been able to get bfx data to work here in the states for the past week. Tried Chrome and Firefox. Other parts of the site work but the long and short interest just stalls out
Good luck m8 :)
I was rude for no reason and I apologize 
Thank you.
I'm seeing the repeated 7200 tests (horizontal floor) with lower highs on the bounces as a descending triangle (continuation pattern). Part of why I think it will break and we'll leg down again. We'll see, though. 
https://www.tradingview.com/x/jkZRUyzk/

Symmetrical triangle support/ Start of BGD. $6800 acted like crazy resistance  prior to BGD so I expect it to turn into somewhat support 

If this wedge breaks down viscously, I’ll probably re evaluate and cut losses under $7050
yeah i think i  over exaggerated with 1million, probably should have said 100k to make a more  fair comparison. And im not saying it's delusional bitcoin reaching 1k its definitely possible, it just needs something really bad to happen.
But by changing parameters you can always find a cloud that provides some support. 
r/nocontext
we've ranged long enough, this is either a huge reversal or a continuation pattern, it won't bounce off the top of the triangle again, and if it does then the triangle won't play out like it should because all the momentum will have been lost 
It makes sense to keep a position open, because it is 100% gambling.  What flawless logic.
Yeah. It's alright mate take it easy, after all, you are everyone's favorite dude. ;)
But, seems like we have a lot of Europeans in this sub. More than I expected actually 
Thats what usually happens. If btc stagnates people start investing in alts to try and make money faster 
When BTC finds a price point and just sits there, alts tend to boom. Just what happens i guess
Everyone is freaking out for days and a lot of a people are saying winter is coming. That’s organic FUD 
I complained on numerous instances from 5k all the way up to 20k

You have only been here for a grand total of a few months. I distictly remember saying at 8k in November “When it all comes crashing down, we will be the ones to pick up the pieces. Just like last time”

Back off
Also don’t you have anythingg better to do than to call me out on every comment I make?

Seriously confused about you. Have I ever done anything to offend you? Why so butthurt?
I'm not even really talking about governments and judicial regulation. But even just some internal self\-regulation. Exchanges have the power to disallow this quite trivially, yet choose not to. They're already centralized services... no reason they can't impose central regulation
Yeah.  I think most of the folks left at ethtrader are relatively recent entrants.

Haven't really experienced tough drops before.
The rule is, when you got down voted there you are usually right 
So you don't think there are any long term investors buying now ? Not even OTC ?

How about someone who actually believes in the long term potential of the technology?  I know you don't, but perhaps someone disagrees with you.  Or someone who thinks the real value is simply higher than the current price?  Everyone who thinks Apple stock is worth more than $200 is a clueless, greedy speculator!
Don’t kill my optimism you slut. Give me hope 
This is what I think will happen. There's not a bullish bone in my body right now, and that's new for me.
Well, we'll see soon.
I think he just means he thinks the bottom will hold, also if it gets to the end of the triangle it's building up coiling and tension, I'm not sure what you mean by it loses that, if anything it gets tighter as it gets smaller, Bitcoin usually likes to wait to the last minute and make big moves. 

 
Getting upvotes about throwing devs in prison because their ICO sold the ETH that everyone gave them. Stay classy crypto. 
Why wouldn't they just place a sell wall at 720 instead of dumping ETH when it's already down 30%. Makes no sense. If I were planning on cashing out a couple million I'd look for a good price. Why the fuck would they care about the ratio as if it's a dick competition 

BACK TO ETH TRADER NOW

Seems like they did sell quite a lot of ETH at the top. Smart people, would also exit scam like that. 

probably not, but come on u don't enter a position like that. that is pure emotion   
fyi i think eth might be going to 100-150. so no i dont want to :P
You'd have to be a certifiable penis to believe any of those figures would be the bottom. 
You're conflating two different arguments. The MA may well have provided a support line. But did touching it cause an instant pump? No, the pump came from retracing a massive sell-off. The MA provided the point, the sell-off the volatility. See the difference? Case and point, the retrace was almost exactly half the dump.
ETHUSD Shorts went up by almost 30k in the last few hours and currently outnumber longs. The last time we had this swap was the Feb 5 dip, and longs didn't outstrip shorts for nearly a month afterwards. Of course, this also sets things up for a nice short squeeze.
Nice job man, must feel good
You got a bet going on that...or do you just love spouting generalized bullshit in order to come back and claim clairvoyance?
He means that if it's that oversold there *must* be building interest to support the bullish tilt, some bid orders are getting him, amirite
I kind of misread your comment. combined with your bullish flair I just kinda skimmed your comment and assumed you were telling him that because he was about to sell that he shouldn't.

in my opinion, the feeling he's getting right now is possibly exactly where he should sell because you want to capitulate *before* everyone else does and then buy back after the rest have capitulated

for me personally back when I was a noob, there was always a sort of gut feeling when I was about to capitulate and I should've pulled the trigger immediately. instead I'd usually wait until it was completely unbearable and then I'd sell, and that'd be the bottom

Shit man, you just blew our cover :-\
I didn't say they don't care being followed, they don't care how many.

I don't care if I'm being followed at all. I can agree with chewy here, posting our trades and view is just sharing our thoughts to public view so that they can be judged in case we missed something or letting people see our view in case they missed something.

Even Chevy here isn't a person who can't be convinced to change his mind about a trade. Actually he did it many times after conversation with other traders here.
Well if I had split it evenly it'd be $7600 and I don't think that's a particularly meaningful option as we've hit it twice and continued down to see lower lows. My question really is: do you think we're going down significantly more from here or are we going a lot more up from here?

It's just that $6750 and $8250 would generally signal more down/upwards movement 
The polls regularly get up to 100-200 votes, but I've never seen a comment with 100-200 responses, ya know? I think one even had 300 votes

There are tons of people who lurk and I'm curious to see what they're thinking, even if it's not statistically significant or anything.

If people are going to judge how bearish/bullish the sub is I figure a straw poll is better than skimming a few comments and saying "wow, sub is X"
Fair point with the spamminess, but also it's not very frequent. Like I said, I love data and statistics so I'm probably gonna like any polls but I can see how they are redundant or unhelpful. 
Assuming this is a bullish consolidation, I think things will get slow and tight. We can already see volatility dropping down quite a bit over the last few months. So if i had to guess a time frame I think, early august. The longer we consolidate the bigger the next parabola can be. This past one based for about 300 days. https://imgur.com/a/DF5skpt
Agree with what you say about Brazil; often media portraits a horror picture that goes far from reality of things. But also find it amusing how you portrait Canada:\) Am from Europe but have been living in Canada for some time, and you make it sound as if Canada is an expensive country to live in where you get little for you money:\)  I live close to a major city here and the neighbour's house was up for sale: 550.000 canadian dollars, and everyone kept saying that it was too expensive, will never get it sold. Is a well\-kept, large house \(200m2, 2000square feet\) with big backyard, swimming pool and several out\-houses. Where I'm from, you'd get a 900square feet APARTMENT with 1 bathroom, 1 livingroom, kitchen and 1 bedroom for the same price \- in similar distance to a major city. And petrol is half the price here compared to Europe, but some salaries are twice as high \- eg. a canadian police officer makes in average almost twice as much as the police in most western\-central european countries.

Canada is a very cheap place to live in, and you get a lot for your money; except nice surroundings, cause Canadians know shit about urban planning:\) How to create nice living spaces within suburbs... There's mostly car roads, wallmarts, canadian tires, parking lots etc, all in a grid pattern that never fricking ends:\)

Just saying... everything comes in relation to something else. And Canada is a cheap place to live. And the fact is \(and funnily enough\), even though it's much more expensive to live in west\-central Europe than in Canada, most west\-central Europeans live well, WITHOUT shortage of money. So to complain about Canada \- not getting much for your money here \- it's just ridiculous. 
Have you ever been to south and central America?

Besides that, the issue here is that the economy is breaking down because it's not possible to distribute goods without government subsidy. A lot, if not all, of this is linked to government corruption, not economic policy, specifically.
Yea, being fat is one of the main contributing factors to the state Brazil is in. Your comment lacks substance, and you seem rather ignorant on the topic. A post filled with insults is devoid of content. Between 2000-2012 Brazil was growing at a rate of over 5% a year and became the world’s 6th largest economy, surpassing the UK. Millions of people climbed out of poverty, unemployment reached a low of roughly 4%, and it even became self-sufficient in petrol production. Things have gone downhill since then, especially now with a presidential election around the corner and no clear indicators as to a front-runner besides Lula, who’s in jail for corruption, which further adds to the problem. Brazil has its issues, but it has absolutely nothing to do with any government official’s weight.
Could definitely see that. If that triangle breaks down though, I'm definitely going DCA. To me, catching the bottom where any meaningful support hasn't been tested in a looonnnggg time (in crypto years) is a fool's errand.

Wherever that bottom occurs though, I'd definitely expect any serious bounce to eventually make it back up to that line we'd have broken down from and find it as resistance. Who knows if we then make a higher low or lower low from there.
I'm with you on waiting to see what the trend does. Do keep in mind a false breakout could lure in a lot of people to think we are going to fall only to reverse in their face. If Bitcoin goes to 3.5 I would start thinking the crypto space is pretty much over. Getting big Wall Street players in the space and institutional money at that point seems very unlikely. The store of value argument disappears. It would show a pretty Broad rejection of Bitcoin and you might even see long-term holders giving up which would collapse the price even more. A revisit a 3.5 would definitely have me out but the thing is I would never come back. I know I'm not alone in that sentiment. Hopes of adoption go downhill pretty quick
The daily is literally not oversold though. 
It's something that has never happened in the history of Bitcoin which would be a major confidence shaker. Even in 2014 the bear Market it was still nearly 10 times higher than the beginning of 2013. It would make the market seem extremely unpredictable because the fundamental situation today is nowhere near as bad as 2014 yet the price action would be much worse
3K today would not be the same as 3K one year ago. 

1. The difficulty of mining bitcoin has gone way up, 3K would make mining no longer profitable.
2. The crypto space has grown tremendously, 1 year ago it was still a small niche community. Now exposure has grown tremendously to where practically everyone knows what cryptocurrency is.
3. There are large institutional investments now. Goldman Sachs, hedge funds, just to name a few. As well as lots of companies that are integrating cryptocurrency or distributed ledger technology into their businesses in some form.

edit: typo
I sold what i had a while ago.  Currently im trading to increase fiat stack. When i think the bottom is in i'll buy back more coins than I had.
I've never shorted alts before but I'm intrigued by this and might test out a small position - if BTC is about to tumble then the prospect of shorting alts seems much more rewarding now that I think about it. Could you share a target for how much higher you might expect it to bounce? (I know that's probably a stupid question).

On Bitmex, do you short the $ value or the ratio? So if for some reason BTC bounces back hard here, would you be protected if the ratio remained more or less the same? I don't necessarily see the satoshi value taking off any time soon but I'm ready to be schooled on the matter.
I built all my shorts from 8.2-9.4k. I don't mind a bounce as it'll give me a good chance to add. I'm actually considering a long at 7k with stops below 6.8

[This could be the potential bullish scenario](https://prnt.sc/jngqxt). If bulls could prove themselves, I'd close my short and reopen higher.

I wasn't disagreeing with you, I've been watching the hidden sell walls.  But I doubt "he" panicked at the end.
It absolutely KILLS some people on here that it's possible to make money AND increase your stack in a bear market. Like, it just eats them up inside.
Enough of your covert shilling. This is a Bitcoin sub, not BCash sub. Reported for covert shilling.
Why you always gotta hit me with logic?
Could also be an ascending triangle, but also a weak bearflag as it isn't even able to make a higher high on the second swing. 

> I think it's an emerging market with lots of potential for growth.

Ok, my only point is if you see that why are you so close to selling everything and never looking back? THAT is stupid if you really believe it has potential, I'm really not trying to be a dick but this is what Bitcoin has always done, extremes in both directions so you should really either get used to it or try something more conservative.  Hope you stay, I'm just saying you should get used to it's volatility if you think it has potential and if not try something else that's not so volatile. 
I do have sympathy, but my point still stands that he thought he could get rich over night if he's already getting cold feet.  It sucks to be underwater but he's obviously not in it for the long-run, if so it's better to move to safer more steady options is all I'm saying.   Why is that crazy? Everyone knows Bitcoin is volatile and he really can't think it can just go up forever? I'm not trying to be a dick I'm just saying these rollercoaster are pretty normal for Bitcoin so maybe he shouldn't be in it if he can't hold any longer. 
Dude if you think this is bad... You're not a long term holder.  We haven't even begin to feel the pain, compared to previous bear markets.
Just settle down - this shit has happened before.  It's nothing new.
Not the rest of your life, just "Long-term."
dropping another 50% from where we are would be the biggest drop in the history of crypto. Even in 2014 when Mount gox blew up with that massive theft of Bitcoin you only had an 80% Peak to trough drawdown. 70% is 6000 which we already touched. 80% would be a little over 4000 which still isn't 50%. This situation we're in now fundamentally is nowhere near as bad. On top of that the 2013 rally was much much larger with a 5000 percent 12 month gain. 2017 on the other hand ran two thousand percent. You also had the Marcus and Wiley situation in 2013. 

I'm not sure about everyone else but usually if I start having emotional feelings about a market they happen really close to peaks and bottoms. Unlike 2014 there is a lack of any real legitimate Fud. I guess you could say there is uncertainty with the government regulations but they have already given hints about this and there is nothing that looks very scary about it.

Lastly, technically we're right back to Triple support levels. 
I dunno. We had the bull run to $300 from some Coinbase news. We were all excited by how much Circle had spent buying the domain Circle.com and how 21 were going to take over the world and importantly as we closed the year we had Mike Hearn rage quit Bitcoin. Which was nice. 
>2015 was far, far, far more dead than it is now.

Well yeah, but the price was also 1/25 of the current price.
I was being over the top sarcastic, but people really do actually say that sometimes in here.  Of course it is irrational nonsense.
Volume is not light at all. It's way higher than it was at any time last year barring December, and the price is higher.
More of that is happening on the short side than the long side these days. Been in this market for a while. Have seen this before many times, some dufus shorting a bunch of coin thinking they can influence the market when all they're doing is temporarily suppressing the price and handing their money to smarter people. We will explode up at some point, guessing pretty soon. Bearwhales are like the dumb rich guy at a poker table who thinks he can win by betting everyone else under the table. Doesn't work that way. At some point you get called.
It depends on the nature/catalyst of the recession.  If it is a currency crisis, it could very possibly lead people to putting their money in crypto.


I do not belive it. But I have been wrong many times.Imagine the usd crashing for some dumb trump shit and draging the already fragile euro with it into the deep. What then? If till then crypto has a promising and robust infrastructure. It could be. But unlikely. But hey? We live in strange times. Just look at who is the president of the most powefull military power of the world.

So yes. Our guess is as good as any ;-)
For every 10,000 "normal" people, there is ONE multi\-millionaire who outdo them all in terms of capital investment if he/she decides that NOW is the time to pump some bitcoin value:\) So yes, I agree that in a recession, these millionaires might not be willing to put money into bitcoin. On the other hand... who knows? Since they have such great capital, they are the ones who actually can manipulate bitcoin value in order to find capital gains when economy is on a downslide.
I’m not saying this won’t go lower, I’m saying this is due for a bounce and another attempt to claw back to 9,000
is there any other kind? 
you literally just closed your short for these exact reasons 
I see - Makes sense.
> But if you can't see the value of bitcoin then I don't think you are looking very hard.
> 
> 

the way you see alts are the way normal people see bitcoin- it's not that crazy

>I'll give you one for free. There is an asset which can be taken across borders, in any quantity, all while existing solely in ones memory. Which asset am I talking about?

you can do a pitch like this for every single shitcoin on the market 

I'm not saying bitcoin is/isn't useless- just reminding you that you seeing alts as worthless is how lots of bitcoin skeptics see bitcoin
If people use their wild speculative dreams of btc being the global currency as a justification to go long then I don't see why you can't use his comment as a justification to go short
Really? Everybody and their mother was trying to FOMO into crypto.
So where did they go tho 
"profit". Keep telling yourself that babe. Unless you close right now of course.
Well, it was not that good, but yeah i am out and grateful for the posters on this board.  Saved me a ton of money.  TBH i would love to catch a nice long and hold and come back in a couple of years, but it does not look like that is going to happen any time soon.
If you were up ~700% as no doubt many still are and youre seeing that percent dwindle daily, wouldnt you get out too, maybe with plans to buy back in later?
and been thoroughly tested
Who's to say they're not behind it?
Also with noting that the UK tax people use whether you are trading on behalf of others as one of the tests to ascertain if you should pay CGT or income tax. So if you are going to do it, and are British, don't take any kind of commission.
They will.  I created an account to trade for them.  The funds were never in any of my accounts.
lolololol.... I don't day trade crypto, that's just comical. it's OK buddy, the testosterone levels will go down after puberty is over, you won't feel the need to shout and name call. good luck out there.
just type in "longs" in tradingview after hitting "Change symbol"

type in "shorts" for shorts. use the first option, the bitfinex BTCUSD longs/ BTCUSD shorts
Thanks, man. And take care of yourself. Set aside living and emergency funds for 5-6 months before you quit your job.
Bitstamp price coming closer to converging with BFX price now, if this isn't a sign we're about to break through the floor then I don't know what is. 

Edit: Right on cue.
I have a bit different triangle made of our lows.

I'm probably gonna cut below 7050 and wait how 6.6-6.8 plays out.
It would need something really bad for that to happen. There's a reason Bitcoin never really falls to previous bubble levels and that's because more and more people enter the space. I'm here from last year and I'm sure at least half this sub entered the space since last year. So it would take a lot to make half of us leave and therefore bring prices down to that level. If we do make our way down I'd say 3k max is our bottom (again, barring any bad news).
Yeah but I think these are the settings that are most often used, the so-called double-crypto settings, which is partly based on the timeframes that Bitcoin trades on versus a traditional asset. It smooths out some of the noise but provides fewer trading signals, which in my view is probably a good thing.
Bank holiday weekend in the UK, currently sitting in a health spa reading Mastering Bitcoin and occasionally checking Reddit. 
Could be, but I remember the run BTC had when it hit 65% dominance in December right before alts began mooning.
Exchanges are in it for the money. The current ETH dump means more money for Bitfinex (ETH/USD is #1 trading pair by volume on Bitfinex thanks to this dump). Why would they stop something that is bringing them money?
bitcoin has surpassed all reasonable expectations of a price increase, anyone expecting more gains is excessively greedy in my opinion. it's more like someone thinking Apple stock is worth $5000
i can't i'm bearish in like 17 ways right now
the closer a pattern gets to being "complete" the less momentum it has upon breaking out, at least according to classical charting principles. I've seen peter say this dozens of times. 

the reason I don't believe it will hold from a purely technical perspective is simply proximity- the fact that we now have 2 (or possibly 3) touches on resistance and 2 on support, a 3rd will likely break downwards if the pattern is to complete. 

but really all I was saying is that a strong move up here would very likely break through the top of the triangle, it would be unlikely that it would get rejected yet again from resistance. 

longing here for a bounce is fine and makes sense from a r/r perspective, but I just don't really see any technicals pointing to a bounce upwards here. at least not yet 
Market manipulation is a federal crime and it’s pretty clear to me that’s what this is. When you have $3B in a ~$75B market and a demonstrable stake in the destruction of that market, you don’t get the luxury of being able to dump whenever you feel like it. This is a well orchestrated attack on a competitor with retail investors caught in the crossfire and while I generally subscribe to libertarian beliefs, this is the one case at which I draw the line.
Can't say it's very smart or good trading no, but you can get away with that 
if you think it's going to $100-150 then your original comment makes no sense 
Tell us your trade bruh. 
Hi mate.  I just think buyers stepped in because it's only the 2nd time price has been below that critical level in the history of the asset. I also used the word 'area' to imply that it didn't 'touch it and get an instant pump'.

I agree with what you're saying with regards to retracing a massive sell-off. It was just an off handed comment, not intended to be look at under a microscope.
Where do you see shorts outnumber longs? I see right now shorts = 21449 and longs = 31366 on trading view bitfinex data. Maybe I look at the wrong data?
Doesn't feel good to have exited it, tbh. I'm not all that confident that this will bounce at this point but I mind as well stick with my original plan to close at this line. Looking for a quick wick back up towards the 50 week MA to re-short but bulls seem impotent at this point so I may not get that good of an entry. 
The trend is your friend.
Thanks! 
Thanks. Bookmarked for future reference.

Edit: is it possible to make the PnL header clickable like the other columns for setting the order ?
Here's an example to make the point. If your question was: will we see $7100, first or $10,000. Even if you think the trend will reverse higher, you'd still likely think $7100 due to probability. You would need a serious reason to pick the low probability option of $10,000.

The same issue exists in your two options, though of different degrees. You want to know direction, but your first poll question is poorly picked to describe that question.
Well there's the additional question of whether this sub is representative of the entire trading population *and* whether it's fair to weight the sentiment 1:1, given that some are fishes and a few are whales (and some are probably just spectating).
That is a subjective statement. The cost of living in Canada is indeed proven to be high by several studies on the topic. (If you want sources, PM me or google it, I’m in bed on my phone atm) compared to the majority of other developed nations, perhaps just not yours and a few others. It is indeed an expensive place to live in, and in this case you are the minority in believing otherwise, so we can’t exactly lay it down as it though it was a fact, as you seem to suggest. It’s understandable that you have that view though. I have never been to Europe but I know that many European countries are expensive AF, mostly from friends and family who have been there. :P

Props for picking Canada to live in by the way!

The point wasn't "fat", the point was "jew". There is a Jewish fifth column occupying the most important institutions of your country. If you think this is not a problem then think again. These people reign over a "rainbow" type of multicultural mess with millions and millions of stupid low-IQ mulattoes and all sort of violent degenerated bipeds of unknown origins. Good luck to clean this mess and become a devolopped country with that quality of people. I wish you can overcome your problems but I simply don't believe in that kind of society.
Let's be honest if the UK had 200M people in their country, Brazil would probably not surpass it. Demographics certainly gives you a workforce (China, India...) I worked in China for some times and despite being the first economy in the world, most of the country is still stuck in the third world and the government isn't even capable to give them decent roads. It will take generations and generations to change, eventually.
I can see this, but as i posted below we could still be riding a long term channel even if we hit 3.5k.  I somewhat felt the same way until i cashed out and now it seems to me like it makes sense.  cognitive bias or whatever.

But yeah, that is a good point though - the more people think we are done the more confidence you can have in a bottom.  Then as long as we are in the long term moonmath channel we could ride it back up over a period of years.

it seems to make a bit more sense if you look at things over a much broader time frame.  Time is the only thing that will answer this question.


[deleted]
I guess not technically oversold as in under 30, but it hasn't been this low since March.
Ha of course it will be a confidence shaker.  But that's what you get when you have manipulated pump (with some FOMO thrown in) to $20K, followed by increasing gov't regulation/bans of cryptocurrency. 

That being said $3K to $3K in less than a year is not an extreme result.  It is a return to normalcy.

That doesn't really help Bitcoin.  In some cases, it probably hurts it.

And of course today is not exactly the same as yesterday...or a year ago.  But $3K is $3K, and BTC was much less than that 2 years ago.  $3K BTC today would not be extremely low, by any means.
I too am trading to increase my fiat, but still, it encourages more wait in the market and to buy even lower sentiment, that might or might not happen.

I would add all the way up until 0.017. Would cut losses at 0.018. Can't really see it getting that high in a bear market like this

0.015-0.016 has been support for months, if we break down below LTC will freefall. 

You short the ratio, and you short a flat amount of coins. So you can short 10 litecoins. 

If BTC bounces hard here I expect the LTC ratio to either bounce to 0.016, stagnate or go lower. I think alt season is over and in general alts are going to sag to very low lows. 

In general I'm going on a shorting spree on alts now. but I'm also shorting very little compared to my normal BTC sized positions. 

A move from $15630 to $17000 would probably wreck me if I were shorting normal amounts. but since it's an altcoin and has low liquidity I figure I'll use smaller contract sizes to allow myself more breathing room.

I shorted a small amount of ETH at .083 as well and it was relatively easy to watch it go to 0.087. Now it's at 0.071 and I'm happy I just left it open 
I'm honored, but I think you're looking for /u/justanotherlogin
Well, I suppose I shouldn't say panic - but instead simply lost patience.

But, the evidence is there of a single large seller - it is reasonable to extrapolate that this same entity was responsible for the above average decline in ETH.
>It absolutely KILLS some people on here that it's possible to make money AND increase your stack in a bear market. Like, it just eats them up inside.

They have been promoting buy+HODL superiority vs trading for quite some time. Everyone's a genius in a bull market. 
This guy's a troll and has constantly been pretending that I'm a troll/shill just because I'm pro-BCH.

Funny how the tables have turned, anyone who recognizes me from here 2013-2015 will know what I mean.
oh just the resident permabear...:/ 
Eh fair enough. I think I was overexaggerating probably. I don't think I'll completely leave the market but I might sell if the trendline I'm watching breaks convincingly. Hopefully I can buy closer to the bottom. Sorry for any hostility. 
why would you encourage him to sell if you think it's going up from here though? o_O

and your comment didn't really come off as particularly kind or helpful, it was more like "lol can't take the heat, sell it all and go back to stocks!"

that combined with the fact that you personally believe it's going up doesn't seem like you're trying to help him out. 
First off, 50% more was an example, it wasn't the point of my comment.

Secondly, another 50% off would be 3.6k.

In 2014 crash, we went from 1.1k to about $180. That's a 83% drop. Going 20k to 3.6k is less severe than that. 

Thirdly, if you look at where people have accumulated, you'll see most people can offload right now and still make 8x gains or more:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/A1QM83WQ/
Volume in down trend since feb bottom. https://imgur.com/a/410LES5 (that's bitifinex, stamp shows similar trend).
BTC is nowhere near ready for usage as a global currency. It's got what, 3 tp/s right now? Visa handles up to like 50,000 transactions per second.

Also I'm not sure a deflationary currency that encourages strict hoarding would be the best to spur an economic recovery.
>when you have a few thousand buyers ready to buy at $7000...you know they are real and aren't just a single whale putting up fake walls to sell into.

I don't say things like this.

I'm also not claiming my analysis *isn't* pseudo-analysis. Anything that isn't comprehensive in some way is pseudo-analysis, imo. If you're not explaining the bull, bear and sideways case, then you're likely just selecting indicators that fit your bias. 
I get that, but I would counter that bitcoin can do the use-case I just mentioned right now. Many alts can do it too, but they are just copying bitcoin, not adding any additional value or use-cases themselves (for the most part). Litecoin is just bitcoin with less liquidity.

And I never said all alts are worthless, just most. Some do provide utility or may do so in the future.
Really.
The magic money machine stopped so they all buggered off. 

I wonder which'll be the next Asian country that fucks itself by getting a boner for the first time during the next bubble. 
The S Korean gov't made sure they went far, far, away.
I think what I meant to say is that they haven't gone anywhere, it's been the same the entire time? idk, I feel like people always overestimated their presence in the market 
Na I would wait to reach what the potential is at least 10k+
I didn't feel the need to do any sort of name calling until you decided to talk shit for no reason.  But backpedal and deflect in anyway you want now that your claim was proven wrong.
Hey, thank you man. That was really helpful
Can you link your triangle? Interested to see how you have it drawn. 

Too lazy to scroll through your comment history, what’s your current long entry? 
I find that standard settings has been pretty decent (although I have switched to 20,60,120,30 and I find it more reliable)
I am aware, just didnt know that exchanges didnt give a fuck about anything other than collecting fees.

I mean I was aware, but it’s a rhetorical sentiment
There's absolutely no evidence that they didn't sell off the ETH responsibly and definitely no evidence they did it as part of an "attack." They've been selling it for months at various time points. What exactly do you propose? They keep it? How can they sell it without "retail investors being caught in the crossfire" by your nebulous standards? This is just the latest in the long line of "EOS is a scam" from ethereum fan boys afraid of healthy competition in dapp platforms.


not when he has to pay 0.2-1% a day
Fair enough, perhaps I was a bit tone deaf. Happy trading!
Oh, I'm referring to ETHUSD, which has shorts at ATH. Replying to the people above me since they were talking about ETH. Edited above for clarity.
it's feeling antsy both ways, a bounce seems imminent but as long as everyone is expecting it it seems to just continue to slow bleed
I get it, I've managed to increase my stack and retain dollar value in the current bear.  The price target for this are sub 3k...possibly sub 2k once the real reverse FOMO hits.  I just don't know if I think prices are going there after the last massive blow off...who knows.  You know, *it's different this time.*
The PnL is calculated in real time so for now it doesn't have that option. 
> You would need a serious reason to pick the low probability option of $10,000.

which is exactly why I asked the question...because lots of people here are predicting that we won't be able to get below $6.8-6.9k

the price isn't a simple probabilistic outcome based on proximity- if you asked "$8000 or $10001?" when we were at $9700 do you think we should have gotten 300 people saying $7k and 1700 people saying $10001? no, because that's not how the price moves or how people think the market moves. 

My intention was to see how many people think the support will hold.
I don't think anyone ever claimed that the sentiment of this sub accurately reflects the sentiment of the whole market.
ya I've thought of that too, but my original intent was to show people that the sub wasn't nearly as bullish/bearish as some were making it out to be. 

Anyway, it's getting downvoted, so I probably won't do it again. It does feel a bit spammy- as soon as I saw one downvoted I planned on not doing it again

it's just fun when the price goes sideways / is moving like molasses
There's nothing subjective about this other than the fact that you have a shrewd view of 'money's worth':) You mentioned that one could get a great house in Brazil for ONLY $300.000. Sure, that is ONLY for someone who's thinking in costs, only about costs, with a Canadian perspective. 

You can't only look at costs to determine what is cheap and expensive in various nations - you have to look at the Price to Income Ratio; how costs and income in a nation stand in relation to each other. And then Canada do become a cheap place to live compared to eg. Brazil, where houses certainly are cheaper than Canada, but not cheap enough to fall in line with the much lower salary median compared to Canadian salaries.

Don't get me wrong here; it's great if you have Canadian standard salary living in Brazil - feels rich:) But ask your average Brazilian on the street how "easy" it would be for them to secure a bank loan for a $300.000 house, since it's sooo cheap for them?
I agree with that. Good to hear we mostly agree. The dollar is pretty much the defacto currency already and you seem to agree with that. The exchange rate you might get as a foreigner can be abysmal at times. This isn't one of those times.

They're in very early stages of building up a market for bitcoin. Transactions are going up but dollar value on those exchanges is holding steady or dropping. Still less than 100k/day in LBC. I think we'll see that grow substantially over the next 2 years.

We agree that Bitcoin isn't going to solve this round of issues. That's too bad, IMO. They need to do something radically different.

I've found that South America and Central America will adopt new systems fairly rapidly. I wouldn't be surprised to find some regions in a dramatically different position in 20 years. For all Brazil's problems, it's still the 8th largest economy in the world... and they've changed their currency overnight before. I don't know if that will solve all their problems, but I believe it will make a substantial dent in government corruption if they're not able to print their own currency.
My country? Lol
China being the first economy in the world?
“Degenerated” bipeds?
Who are you to speak about IQ? Your proficiency at basic English and common knowledge is lacking at best, on par with *degenerate* (that’s how you spell it) bipeds.

You talk about IQ, assume I’m Brazilian when I clearly stated I am a Canadian citizen living here and you even have the audacity to spill out mouthfuls of ridiculously poor grammar and Detroit-level grade-school education “English”. Take a good look at yourself before you allow your brain to think and behave in such ridiculously poor fashion, all while wasting the precious oxygen the rest of us depend on.
I think what you said about cognitive bias is absolutely true. The thing about price is if it continually goes up or has realistic corrections you don't scare everyone away. You actually bring in more people and more money. Even in the 2014-2015 bear Market the low was roughly 10 times the start of 2013. After all of the fake pump Shenanigans from Mount gox it still was 10 times the beginning of 2013. The argument that this Market is completely unpredictable would be very strong if we go 3.5k because really when you look out the window it's nowhere near as bad as 2014. Again this is my cognitive bias but I want to see the crypto space improve and strengthen.
That's just gambling and if that's what this Market is going to be you guys can have it. You're not going to have broad option and institutional money in that scenario. It will just be a speculative frenzy where no one really knows what the price is going to do and you just hope it goes from one extreme to the other all the while capital inflow will dry up and the market will become less and less liquid
Right so we could go a lot lower before the daily is oversold 
You mean the tether situation? Personally I don't think the regulations are going to be that bad. We have a very wild west Administration in the United States right now. It's probably the most Reckless and careless we're going to see in awhile. I would not expect anything very drastic in regards to regulation. Then again if that happens I suppose it could be a very bullish Catalyst and people are just in a holding pattern waiting to see what's going on. Really I would like to see this space develop so again there is cognitive bias. When I look at the cost of Mining and I look at public opinion of fall to 3000 is terrible for both. Best case scenario it delays adoption by many years. Worst case scenario it prevents it from ever happening.

If this thing is going to collapse I also don't think it's going to go this direction. We're going to have one last pump where the large holders are able to exit. Right now the Winklevoss Twins and many of the others are trapped. Bitmain is in the same boat. They can't sell large quantities in this market. 
Low volume stable price = load up 
shit lol your guys' names confuse me. your name was what came to the top of my head hahaha

/u/justanotherlogin

can you update the position tracker to allow more decimal points?

I'm technically short from 0.08050 but it says 0.08.
You know what gets me about people like this. They have all this money. So much they can move the market. Rather than sell into that last month when things were getting to be really good they sit on it and when the market goes down they sell probably pretty close to the bottom. I guess being wealthy doesn't insulate you from the same emotions we all face from time to time.
I'm not a troll, you are. You're the one subtly pushing the BCash narrative at every turn. You're in the wrong sub, bro. Read the sidebar, **no covert shilling**. Alt discussion belongs in the alt thread. 

Furthermore, you keep PMing me and harassing me and begging me to stop calling you out for being a troll. Nah, people should know that you're a troll and shill. Consider it a public service announcement.
No worries, I get the venting, if this turns into a long down bear market you will have plenty of time to buy really low.   Just careful on the fakeouts, a lot of times it likes to dip below the trend-line and comeback up, so give it a little to confirm before you sell.   I totally get selling and wanting to buy back lower though, it feels like it will never stop plummeting I have been there many times.  Just take a break for awhile and don't look at the charts, it's good for your brain. 
> why would you encourage him to sell if you think it's going up from here though? o_O

Because he obviously can't handle Bitcoin's volatility is why I say that. 

>  and your comment didn't really come off as particularly kind or helpful, it was more like "lol can't take the heat, sell it all and go back to stocks!"

It was a bit harsh, I just see him constantly complaining in this sub about the price and losing money when his flair says long-time holder and he talks about the long-term potential, so it gets old.  Ya it was too harsh on my end, I'm just trying helping him realize the realities of Bitcoin and it can obviously be crazy, so maybe stop constantly complaining about losing money and either sell or hold for the long-term. 

> that combined with the fact that you personally believe it's going up doesn't seem like you're trying to help him out. 

I personally think it will go up but I also understand markets and could see it going back down to really low levels that has nothing to do with it.   I am trying to help him decide if he should just sell if it's better for his sanity or hold long-term and stop worrying about his losses.  
 
83% from our current high is 3.4k so for argument's sake it appears we can just call it the same thing. The question is do you really think 2018 is the same situation as 2014?
Yes I know that and I agree. But It could be one alternative hope.

 So, its unlikely. But sometimes unforseen, seemingly unrelated things develop to meet in just that one spot where everything falls together like an unlikely jigsaw puzzle. Lol :-D
you still trying to get those Internet points? they must be rolling in. lol. get over yourself.
No problem :) 

You can even do a historical look at longs over shorts by typing a parentheses "(" then type in longs, click the first option, type "/" then type in shorts, click first option then type ")" and hit enter.

you'll see a ratio of the longs over shorts 
I'm on mobile so hard to post it.

I'm long from 7.2, but it's small entry and I'm thinking about closing it now, selling pressure is big and it looks like it's gonna break down.
You think they are selling 300k ether for expenses? Lol okay.
You too buddy!
Ahhh, makes sense then. Thanks for the answer :\)
Understood, but it's a shame, because it's probably the most interesting sort order.
Then what's the use of polling?
Nooo don't stop!
> ya I've thought of that too, but my original intent was to show people that the sub wasn't nearly as bullish/bearish as some were making it out to be.

Oh, then carry on. That seems noble.

>Anyway, it's getting downvoted, so I probably won't do it again.

Oh, nevermind.

> It does feel a bit spammy- as soon as I saw one downvoted I planned on not doing it again

Well, like I said, the downvotes are manipulated or brigaded here, often. Plus, there's a subset of this sub made up of FUDseters, shills and trolls. I'd rather just hear from the regulars here that I *haven't* tagged as shills or retards instead of wondering who did and didn't vote.

Poor little thing. I'm not a native English speaker. I've learnt English mostly by myself in my 20's. And I can speak 5 languages.
Yes most of the people in Brazil are lowlife mulattos having an IQ of 70.
Racial inequalities is what makes this country absolutely doomed. Just like the city of Detroit is doomed.
Whites have an average IQ of 100, Asians 105 and Jews 115. Now look at which countries are the most developed. The races having the highest IQ are those who are successful. Welcome to reality, Canadian snowflake.

>  I don't think the regulations are going to be that bad.

Regulations are already "that bad".  China and India already essentially banned crypto and a few more countries...roughly half the the population of earth.

It's amazing how people brush that off that 3+ billion people can't legally buy cryptocurrency now.

In addition to that, it's illegal for many people in the USA to sell their friend $5 of Bitcoin....well, without paying tens of thousands of $s for a license to sell it.   

It is draconian regulation and bans, and the price would be much higher without it.
Done, increased the decimal points from 4 to 8 and updated the rounding functions to show the correct value.
> You're the one subtly pushing the BCash narrative at every turn

To any readers: I've spoken about BCH on the altcoin discussion thread on two separate days. Got attacked by him both times of course. My r/bitcoin comment earlier was an observation based on the fact that I've seen them consider BTC only a store of value over there and not many have considered it for spending. Other comments I've made on r/bitcoinmarkets have been just a few comments in the daily thread about BTC price, because I trade BTC, like I always have. Plus all my BTC comments on /u/PsyRev in 2013-2015.

> Furthermore, you keep PMing me and harassing me and begging me to stop calling you out for being a troll.

This is not true at all, and you do realize that reddit admins can verify that this isn't true? I'll copypaste our messages here though:


Subject line: Stop replying to me or I'll put you on ignore.
PsyRev_ • 34m
.

gypsytoy • 20m
That's more than fine with me. I'll continue to out you for being a troll / shill either way. I don't really care if you see the comments, it's more important that others see.

PsyRev_ • 17m
Lol this is private message, you don't have to play your charade here.

In that case I'll not ignore you then.

gypsytoy • 14m
What charade? Why is your vocabulary so limited that you invoke this word at every turn? Try being more creative, bro.

Anyway, like I said, I don't care if you block me or not. It won't deter me from lambasting your bullshit for what it is. /r/BitcoinMarkets is a Bitcoin sub, not a BCash sub. It's probably high time you learn that.

gypsytoy • 13m
In that case I'll not ignore you then.

Also, you're English is terrible. Is English a second language for you?

The sentence should read.

In that case then, I won't ignore you.

Go read a book.

PsyRev_ • 9m
Trying to garner information about me huh?

gypsytoy • 5m
Lol, no. I was merely ridiculing you for incredibly basic grammatical errors. It's hard to take someone seriously when they can barely type. Your writing is incoherent most of the time.

(End)

Now I'll report you for harassment. And no, I won't ignore you, because I don't want you harassing me and trying to spread vitriol about me. I'll continue just as I am now.
>I just see him constantly complaining in this sub


Really? I don’t think I complain *THAT* often.
The only thing that matters is perceived value. Going from ATH is one way to judge the bubble bursting, but nothing says the value floor is 3k. It could retrace to the previous ATH and visit 1.1k again. The question is if anyone in the world thinks that's a steal and buys all available bitcoin at those prices. 

The question you should be asking yourself is if bitcoin can justify a 3.6k price tag, which is 3x higher than the peak from 2013. Or put another way, can you justify 3.6k, which is 18x higher than the floor we discovered in 2015? I know we have a lot more consumer interest, but those consumers all got burned badly when they bought in. They had friends telling them bitcoin is a scam, and now they're gloating about being right. 

I don't know where the floor is. I don't make claim that I know where it is. I'll use TA to decide when to buy back in, and there is a weak signal right now, so I'm not buying in at this price. 

Without the unwashed masses buying up bitcoin at high prices, it can't have a high price tag. So short of another media frenzy, we need real world adoption and use cases. I don't see a major event happening in the next year. Which means a slow bleed, much like 2015. The longer we go without hope of moon, the more odds are that people will offload as they need cash, or as it becomes apparent there is no short term massive gains in their future. Once the weak hands are out, price will climb again.

Then we have to look at the economy and the stock market. It's overdue for a correction. I don't see it crashing till 2020, and when that happens, will bitcoin be where people flee to?  I could argue both ways on the topic, but fleeing to a super risky asset when they are risk adverse seems unlikely. 

So now we have a lengthy correction period butting up against a likely economic downtrend. That to me makes for a real potential shit storm, and I don't know if I should be buying it up or staying away.
No, I just get to bask in joy of a hater being proven wrong.  I don't know why you decide to read the daily discussion thread if you aren't involved in trading bitcoin, let alone decide to make a comment attacking a poster in said thread.
Nice ! Thanks x2 
Have you happened to look at the etherium shorts today? I'm literally looking back to 2017 on tradingview right now and the short interest is higher than it's ever been. Also noteworthy is the macd histogram. There's a bullish Divergence on bitcoin I missed when we were chatting last night. The histogram has slowly been sloping upward since about the 17th while price has been trending lower. 
They are putting billions towards development of the ecosystem so yes. But regardless these ICOs (even shit ones like Tezos) have good reason to sell their ETH so they have cash on hand for as long as necessary to fulfill their projects. You aren't being consistent and have called for jail as a consequence of something that was inevitable the moment ethereum became the go-to ICO platform.
My view of Bitcoin sets me up to make an argument about this that isn't fair. So, you're right, Bitcoin in it's current form is impractical for handling most transactions, large and small.

If you look at Bitcoin as an emerging technology that may be able to solve some of these issues in years or decades from now, then I think we can have a more interesting discussion. It would be speculative, but interesting. Consider:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dla42bY7k90
As far as transaction limits, lightning adoption effectively resolves that. You can't spin up a substantial population's regular transactions without lightning. It would, theoretically, be able to handle Brazil ,and more, and do that without bloating the ledger.
That's exactly it. Right now the argument for Bitcoin is better in the store of value sense I believe. When lightning network is perfected that all changes. I think they're going to get it too the question is just when. That's yet another reason I don't want to see this face dry up because of fall to 3 K means liquidity is going to go out the window. You're going to have people in droves abandoning the space and that means a lot less money which means the smarter Minds might not stick around developing said Network
Have you been keeping up on that China situation? It sounds like it's not over yet and they are working through a committee on development. They had a bit of a knee-jerk reaction to ico's but I really don't think that country long-term is going to stay shut down based on what's coming out on coin desk and a lot of the YouTube videos
Lol, what harassment? You messaged me, bro. You asked me to stop replying to your comments outing you as a shill/troll. I declined. How is that harassment?

Also, did you have to make this exchange completely unreadable? Anyone who doesn't want eye cancer, can read the same exchange [here](https://imgur.com/a/5f5ySGJ). 

You're clearly upset because I told /r/btc that BCash was going to crash following the fork and nobody listened and mods banned me. Now, the price is crashing (barely holding .12 right now) and you and your shill buddies are upset. Who could've guessed that the fork was all PnD hype? Who could've guessed *that*? 

Lol
I've seen a few comments from you the past few days and I'm not annoyed - I mainly just feel for you. 

Everyone is elated at the top of a bull run and is happy to pat each other on the back when they're getting rich af on paper. but when the prices tank and people are just hemorrhaging money, no one seems to be there to help other people out.

this is the reason bitcoin has so many haters/opponents/etc. the mindset of "get fucked! you can't handle the heat, you don't deserve all the money we're making!" is very unhealthy and glorifies mindless risk-taking and circlejerking over what essentially amounts to luck. 

anyway, as long as you can stomach a drop to high $6s there's not a whole lot of reason to sell here. Unfortunately you should have been selling when you started to feel comfortable.

I was actually going to ask you about your intentions around $10k because I know that was your breakeven and I would've been very happy to see you get out at breakeven but I didn't want to try to encourage you to do anything. I should have said something. Sorry mate
why wouldn't I pay attention to the sub? there are educated posters, and there are fan bois, and there are people in between. everyone has an opinion, I like to hear them. I'm waiting for the announcement of something spectacular regarding block chain tech. your spectacular and mine are different. I'm waiting to hear about something that blows me away as a consumer, and I'll probably hear about it here, before i read about it anywhere else online. to say you have to have money on the line to be involved in bitcoin, and to be on this sub is horrible for bitcoin.  btc loves everyone.
Yes, although the ethereum shorts are bearish for now. If the price was stagnating then it'd be bullish because those shorts could easily be trapped/squeezed. but if the price is moving down then they have no reason to buy/close yet.

And yes there's a few bull divs. I wouldn't be too surprised to see a small relief rally from it but I personally don't believe we will see a whole lot higher
That's great if you want to fantasize that they will un-ban Bitcoin there, but I am talking about the reality if today, not fantasies of the future.

And it has been illegal since 2014 there to use Bitcoin in commerce.
......

No comment.
Dude. You’re not mentally well. What’s wrong? Honestly. What’s your real intention here? 

You spend literally hours a day trashing a software implementation. That is not normal. 

It indicates you have disingenuous motives. You either need to seek therapy, or better pay.
You’re good bro, it isn’t your responsibility. I didn’t realize anyone really followed my comments that much so thanks I guess. Hindsight is 20/20 so I should have sold but hey what can ya do? 


I think I can stomache a drop to the high 6’s easily, Ive done it before. The thing I’m scared of is what affect a huge bear market will have on my alts. So that’s why I am probably gonna sell my alts and put them into BTC and then just forget about the market for a little while and focus on school and family and stuff. 


Good luck with your trading dude!
From your description it seems like /r/bitcoin or /r/crytpocurrency would be more up your alley.  This sub isn't really about talking about tech and blockchain advancements, it is specifically about actively trading bitcoin.
So if I'm reading all of this right you already sold and just want the price to go lower so you can buy more? Is that reasonably accurate or are you just overall very bearish on the space I can't quite tell

You know what the real irony about this discussion is? It's being fought on the exchanges right now. Right now on all the exchanges across the world you have people if you like me and you have people that feel like you voting with their dollars. I guess we will see where it ends up
Oh, please. You're the one following me around responding to every comment critical of shilling. What's *your* MO? What do you guys have a discord group to organize vote brigades and help defend each other from mean ol' gypsy? It's pathetic. I'm simply pointing out that you guys are shills and your response is to call me mentally ill? Sorry you don't like being outed for shilling, but that's all you guys do so I'm going to call it out when I see it.

I have no issue with BCash, only with the fraudulent marketing and shilling of BCash. Get it straight.

edit: what do you know? You're making [more or less the same exact comment to many other](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8mus4h/bitcoin_core_devs_telling_bitcoin_meetup_members/dzqkzd1/). Telling people they're mentally ill or disingenuous is not going to prevent people from outing you as a shill / troll. Sorry.
I check them all. advancements in trading is huge though. regulation is a big thing for me.
As I said, your fantasies don't interest me.  And have fun on your other tangents, but my point is that "I don't think the regulations are going to be that bad." is an absurd statement, based on reality.
/u/paintedfrog  might think this is funny.

/u/bitttburger, you're coming across as more desperate and pathetic every day. You're leveling the same accusations at multiple people, just because they're pointing out that BCash is being pushed by scammers and repeatedly pump-n-dumped. Sound like the one who needs help is *you*. A cursory glance through your post history reveals a sad, desperate, lonely and rather pathetic individual. GO SHILL SOMEWHERE ELSE!
Final question. If you're truly this bearish on the crypto space or maybe just Bitcoin? I'm not sure? Why are you here?
Lolol. Yeah from what I recall from my time on r/btc our friend bitttburger is pretty loaded with a large stack of bch. The fact that that shitcoin depends so heavily on pr and messaging is my only guess as to why a grown adult with means is spending so much of his time stalking anonymous posters on reddit. He's just protecting his bags
> Why are you here?

To confuse the easily confused.

Education. Reasonable discussion. Helping people. Watching for those moments when things just go right. 

If your reason for existing is to confuse the easily confused on here I truly feel sorry for you. That's a life centered around pessimism negativity and despair in order to find that enjoyable

Rule 2: Let's try to avoid drama.
Yeah I got banned and muted by Shares back in December. Guy is a shameless lackey who doesn't mind blatantly lying on purpose as long as it furthers the cause. But I don't mind being banned, it's like a dystopian universe over there. The fact alone that they actively encourage a toxic bot like cryptochecker to shame any newcomer into towing the party line is enough to discredit the vast majority of "discussion" on there. All they do is complain about Bitcoin anyway, pretty boring.
He is a troll.

Yeah, agreed. Glad I got the ban. It was too tempting to engage with every clueless moron over there but nothing productive ever came of it. It's just a cesspool.

It's hilarious that they would ban me for [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8j0k6r/bits_is_the_historical_and_common_sense_unit_and/dyx3myo/?context=3) though. All I did was press #2 mod /u/bitcoinxio for a defense of his ridiculous claims regarding brands and branding. Pressed him a bit *too hard*, I guess. If the downvotes and constant attacks aren't enough to discourage you from posting, they just ban you. It's a pretty simple and effective solution for keeping that place a complete echo chamber.
Yeah I picked up on that. I was just curious how far he would actually go. At least this guy admitted he was what he was. 
Lol I'm having flashbacks from when I was still allowed to post in r/btc
A truly "uncensored" sub wouldn't even consider a ban for that. Perfect example of their whole dysfunction over there. If they truly had the courage in their convictions, and faith in the success of their coin on its own terms they'd encourage criticism. And if they were right they could just shut you down with facts. Hypocrites.

Fwiw there's a newer ~uncensored sub r/talkcrypto where I'm one of the mods. There's a mix of pro-bch and pro-btc mods there so it could be interesting if it keeps gaining users. The bch guys are actually cool and have a good attitude
You mean you didn't like only being able to respond once every ten minutes to a barrage of insults and strawmans? You didn't like the de-facto censorship in the form of instant and immense downvote brigading? How could you not miss *that*?
[removed]
That's cool. Though I'm not sure how neutral rdar1999 is. I've seen him make some ridiculously inaccurate claims that border on propaganda in /r/btc. I'll subscribe though and see what comes of it.
I miss the pay, mostly. Bilderbergs really know how to take care of their employees
Rule 1 a 2: Here you're doing this to someone else on the same day. This counts as the same warning, but I'd don't want to see this kind of drama break out here. Please keep things on topic and friendly here.
[removed]
Nice. Yeah I wouldn't say he's neutral but he's a smart dude who will go in depth. I've sparred w him on twitter a number of times too, mostly comes down to ideological differences for me. That being said i think he's wrong about everything :p
Yeah I was speaking with Adam this past week at the Blockstream Training Grounds about how much money I had made shilling for them. It's good that the new recruits were looking ready and able as ever. They're doing good work.

Rule 1 and 2: Let's try to avoid the drama here. Don't get baited into these kinds of discussions. Just report and move on. If you feel targeted or harassed DM us or elevate the issue to reddit admins. Happy to help you navigate that process.

I dunno, I tend to agree with Giacomo that BCashers almost entirely fit into one of two groups. Malicious and/or clueless (or maybe just ignorant in some cases). 

There are a few exceptions in /r/btc, but I don't remember rdar1999 being one. /u/capt_roger_murdock is an example of an intelligent BCash proponent who argues articulately and in good faith. A rare specimen, indeed. Most of the rest are just ignoramuses and propagandists.
Cool beans, man. Blockstream doesn't pay me nearly enough to deal with every little complaint that pops into your head, so can you just shuffle off and find someone else to stalk?
[removed]
Extremely rare. I mostly agree with Giacomo too. But when the select few are outside the playpen they can be reasonable and i'm always happy to have my assumptions challenged whenever possible
[removed]
Yeah same. I'm not seeing much of that in /r/talkcrypto though. I think *this sub* is the best for critical discussion about Bitcoin. Unfortunately it's overrun with covert BCash shills now. It's obnoxious and has driven good members out of the sub but there's still thoughtful discourse to be had. Just not with someone like /u/bitttburger, who is intent on derailing any critical conversation of BCash. It's absurd that he just travels from sub to sub with the same tired arguments and attacks. 

BCashers will do anything required in order to get people to stop pointing out that BCH blocks are currently about 50 Kb... They have about 64000% worth of headroom before they hit their limit. Instead of talking about how to fix *that*, all they want to do is argue about the name or Blockstream conspiracies or how LN is 'centralized' or some other such nonsense. I used to think ETH shills were bad but this is a whole other level of shill.
Who am I aggressing? Describing why BCash is a shitty project is not being aggressive, it's just being truthful. The shills are the ones who are being aggressive. People pointing out how absurd and scammy the arguments are are just doing their civic duty. 

I've not once heard you articulate a point fully and clearly. You always just start name calling and whining that people aren't bullish about BCash. You do it with me, with /u/paintedfrog and many others. 

Also, I certainly haven't talked about BCash for my past 70 posts, so nice job lying.

Rule 1: This reads like targeting and baiting to me. If you don't like him ignore him.
Okay, bro. You couldn't prove my point more if you tried. 

I couldn't care less what BCashers think of me. I wasn't trolling, I was simply providing information that was counter to the narrative. Some people just can't handle civil debate and have to lash out, like you're doing. 

Good luck with the coin that's selling for.... oh shit... .125! :( Is there even a price where you might reconsider your devotion or are you going to baghold until the bitter end? It's no wonder why you're extra upset tonight!
