Fuck another Bart is forming
I've said it once ill say it again....sentiment has changed people, sentiment has changed.  There is inherently more risk in taking shorts as opposed to longs right now
Reminder: There will be an AMA later today. It might occur in the announcement thread, but it might also get a fresh thread. Either way, it will be stickied. https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8c05vr/hi_rbitcoin_im_emiliano_pagnotta_assistant/
I actually think it's amazing how well these dumps get absorbed. Really different than a few days/weeks ago.
Will it reach 9k by the end of April?
Alot of people were complaining that they needed more time to get I before btc took off again, well now is your time folks. 

For those worried that btc dropped, even in a bull run there will be bear days, if you can't handle that than you shouldn't be investing your money in anything
I want another short squeeze

**HODL On: In Defense of Bitcoin's Best Investment Strategy**

https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-in-defense-of-hodlers/

Steven Hopkins is chief operating officer and general counsel of Medici Ventures, an Overstock.com subsidiary focused on the advancement of blockchain technology.

In 1987's Black Monday stock market crash, Sam Walton, the world's richest man, lost more than half a billion dollars in a few hours.

When reached for comment, Walton said, "It's paper anyway. As far as I'm concerned we're focusing totally on the company doing well and taking care of our customers."

He didn't care about dollars; he cared about his asset Wal-Mart, and he still owned that.

History of the #HODL In bitcoin's volatile and roller coaster past, "HODL" was the meme that bound the cryptocurrency community together. It stood for the proposition that we all believe in the future of bitcoin. It's both funny and insightful.

Here is the original post by GameKyuubi on a Bitcoin Talk forum (spelling errors and profanity included):

I AM HODLING

I type d that tyitle twice because I knew it was wrong the first time. Still wrong. w/e. GF's out at a lesbian bar, BTC crashing WHY AM I HOLDING? I'LL TELL YOU WHY. It's because I'm a bad trader and I KNOW I'M A BAD TRADER. Yeah you good traders can spot the highs and the lows pit pat piffy wing wong wang just like that and make a millino bucks sure no problem bro. Likewise the weak hands are like OH NO IT'S GOING DOWN I'M GONNA SELL he he he and then they're like OH GOD MY ASSHOLE when the SMART traders who KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THEY'RE DOING buy back in but you know what? I'm not part of that group. When the traders buy back in I'm already part of the market capital so GUESS WHO YOU'RE CHEATING day traders NOT ME~! Those taunt threads saying "OHH YOU SHOULD HAVE SOLD" YEAH NO SHIT. NO SHIT I SHOULD HAVE SOLD. I SHOULD HAVE SOLD MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY SELL AND BOUGHT MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY BUY BUT YOU KNOW WHAT NOT EVERYBODY IS AS COOL AS YOU. You only sell in a bear market if you are a good day trader or an illusioned noob. The people inbetween hold. In a zero-sum game such as this, traders can only take your money if you sell.

so i've had some whiskey

actually on the bottle it's spelled whisky

w/e

sue me

(But only if it's payable in BTC)

It was not about bitcoin versus bitcoin cash or 1,000 other cryptocurrencies. It was bitcoin vs. the world and we ALL embraced it.

It only took 11 minutes for this post to become a meme that became the rallying cry for the entire crypto world. We were all on the same rollercoaster ride and GameKyuubi, in the depths of his frustration, had (sort of) elegantly articulated both what it feels like and the best trading strategy for an asset this volatile.

Buy and HODL.

The good traders GameKyuubi was wrong about only one thing: There aren't any good traders.

There are lots of us who believe we are good traders. But we aren't. Of course, some of the loudest voices on Reddit regularly remind us about how well they time the market. Except when they don't time the market well.

A paper published last October by the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley entitled "Do Day Traders Rationally Learn About Their Ability?" used nearly 15 years of stock market day trading data to conclude that all day traders are irrational, the vast majority of day traders lose money, and even when day traders are successful, they "irrationally attribute success disproportionately to their ability rather than luck."

This sounds exactly like the crypto trader. Any post you see mocking HODL is likely someone who thinks they are really smart because they made money by trading crypto last year.

Of course, their success was due to their unique trading ability and not the fact that the entire market rose like a rocket.

HODLing works Still, empirically, even in volatile assets like bitcoin, carefully choosing an asset and holding long-term positions has proven to offer the best return.

Warren Buffett, the most successful investor of modern times, has often said that he only invests in what he knows. His preferred holding period: forever. With that model, his company, Berkshire Hathaway, has averaged a 19 percent annual return since 1965 which means it has risen more than 1 million percent.

Theoretical models that assume participants know when markets will move against them can offer better returns but, in practice, market movements cannot be reliably predicted so even when people like Bernie Madoff try to make us think that they've figured it out, they haven't.

Long-term investment in quality assets remains the only reliable investment strategy.

Simply put, HODLing works.

More possibilities For those not interested in limiting their activity to HODLing, there are two new and useful ideas that have begun bouncing around that really do advance cryptocurrencies: #BUIDL and #SPEDN.

BUIDL has been used to help remind us that, in the words of a CypherPunk's Manifesto, "Cypherpunks write code." In order for the blockchain to really be useful and valuable, we need to build stuff on it. Watching the price go up and down either as a trader or a HODLer does nothing to make bitcoin work better.

We need to create some of the promised applications that can really change the world. To date, the blockchain community has fallen short in this regard outside of the areas of payments but there are some real wins.

Just this weekend, Voatz, a Medici Ventures portfolio company is running party county convention voting in Utah, state convention voting in Michigan and state primary voting for overseas and military voters in West Virginia, all on a blockchain platform.

Blockchain voting is a simple application, but it is one that can bring a much-needed security and transparency to elections. And we are doing it now.

SPEDN is a nod to the many of us who realize that, for bitcoin to be useful, we need to be able to spend it to buy things. And I mean everything. It really doesn't matter whether it is through second-layer solutions like lightning or forks like bitcoin cash; we need more ways to use cryptocurrencies in real-world transactions.

A focus here, rather than complaining about HODLers would be helpful. We need many more merchants to accept cryptocurrency before it becomes useful. Options to spend bitcoin remain severely limited in most areas and this will ultimately limit bitcoin's value.

As for me, I will HODL until I can buy useful stuff and SPEDN.

HODL on This year has seen intense regulatory pressure on cryptocurrencies and its time we stop pretending that HODL was stupid. It isn't and it wasn't. Anyone who doesn't like the HODL mentality needs to give HODLers something else they can do with their bitcoins.

Trading is no solution for intelligent people. What we need are new ways to use cryptocurrency.

We need BUIDLers and merchants who will let us be SPEDNers.

We’ve got a pretty clear Batman formation on the GDAX 1-hr charts. Bullish!

Over 8k again. Nice!  Time to press the pedal to the metal.  Let’s get to 9k this week. Shall we?
Here we go again. 
This blows. I don’t understand why we have to keep crawling back into the asshole of the bear time and time again. I just wish this fucking bear market would die.
all these people suddenly telling everyone else to sell. Sounds like shorts are scared they'll get burned come tomorrow hahaha
So, what's on the menu for today?
Do you have to pay taxes after you sell only?

Has anyone succesfully used bisq with ally bank using zelle?
Hold position boys!
I just wired money from my bank to my BitFlyer account. It won’t be transferred until tomorrow. Bull run will happen sometime between now and tomorrow morning JST.
Good morning weak handed American brothers 
I know the market has been (to put it mildly) boring for the last couple of months. But unless the tech is going to be completely abandoned, surely it's ONLY A MATTER OF TIME until we reach and surpass the ATH. Stock up while it's cheap :D
is dumping just started ??
Hopefully most were able to make a nice little profit this weekend. Be a whale; now wait out the storm. 
As long as we don't fall below the $7,800 range (resistance), we should be good. IMHO this drop was due to people taking profits and a correction in BTC price.  
Same shit, different week.  Too predictable.
OMG we have a key reversal :S
**Come On Bulls, don't throw away the last few days progress!** 
Welcome back bears. People starting open up those short positions again 
The bears 🐻 will fail this time. Wrong season. Time to go back into hibernation. 
Can we just accept that this was a dead cat bounce
Due to popular demand we have decided to extend the sale for a very short time. 

The happiness of our customers is of utmost importance to us. So we want to give everyone, who might have missed out on this "once in a lifetime" opportunity, the chance to take advantage of these incredibly low prices.

But be quick! This sale ends very soon!

'Double Bart' coming up.
Long red dongs for breakfast who's eating
How much of the price of BTC will be due to the value of the dollar going down, Im thinking long term
$8000-$8040 is getting boring. Let's break out there. Shall we?
Perhaps a few last minute sellers due the tax deadline today and last night.  
well, it was a good run 
I knew it couldn't sustain itself. Very happy.
I really don't think you'll get another chance to buy below $8k. Risky if you aren't in now.
The extended "Spring Sale" is over. I hope everyone got a chance to purchase some sub-8k coins.
Liking the fact that we're holding above $300b, but that trend line could use a serious hammering. If we break it, hot damn spring 2018 will be gravey.
I dicked around on coinbase for two weeks (early december so i got very lucky) and realized ~$700 in gains. I was fully planning on reporting this in my taxes but finished my taxes with the intention to come back and add this, but didn't realize once submitted I had to wait for my refund and there's a complicated process to amend your taxes.  Is it worth it to go back and report this?

how do you us think bitcoin would react in another banking crisis?

what a resistance at $8140

Very happy to see the progress made was lost in a few hours. Go lower.
Good morning, New York!

What are your plans for today?
It was but a nice little pump back to the bottom she goes. 
Given the HUGE expansion of bitcoin in the next 5 years, will we see slow gains, fast gains, and what is the expectation? Is there any fact-based information out there?
ever notice how people in this sub only believe in HODLing when
what is the best investment
mining  using solar or buying coins
or should I just buy another 10,000 sheep
Nice candle.
Very likely the short squeeze will turn out to be a bull trap. Free fall to 6-7k range incoming
Remember Americans,  you do NOT have to pay taxes due on 2017 crypto trades by April the 17th.   You only have to file a tax return.  The Tax return may declare that you owe the IRS,  but if you don't actually send a check,  the IRS assess a penalty,  and starts charging interest.  And that is perfectly legal on your part AND their part.

Ultimately,  you will HAVE to pay all taxes due,  plus any penalties and interest incurred,  or the IRS will f you over.

This is important because  if you:

* owe taxes on 2017 trades
* don't have the fiat to pay
* believe strongly your coins will recover soon

It might be a wise thing to HODL,  and pay the penalty and interest.




Quite disappointed to wake up this morning to see that we had got over $8400 only to then come back to around $8100.  Hopefully when the American market gets going properly we can get back to around $8300 or higher.  Cheers. 
hmmm, price going down, could be people cashing out before tax day (?)
Hey fellas, its Monday morning so real BTC markets begin now! Beginning a live analysis and trading segment in just a few mins!

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfpTPoIOy2k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfpTPoIOy2k)
Sellers are getting exhuasted walls are trimming down
if the dip was caused by the tax season, crypto should have risen by now. 
**Surely a drop down to $7000 is a great thing?** I know everybody has hopes of going to the moon this month, but if you had Bitcoin before the spike up to $8400, then sold and it falls to $7000 then you have made yourself some lovely profit for the next round! 

It also means that all the doom and gloom from last week and predictions of $4k bitcoin is now over. The feeling this week is upbeat because it has demonstrated, proven, that there will be a lot more bullruns in 2018. 

So sell now, let it fall to $7000. Other traders will jump in, FOMO.  Then buy in with an increased position for the real bullrun!

I can.t see any one new investing in BTC
When they look at the history of the last few months
I invested in BTC at the start of 2017, bless BTC
and just been a holder except for a few coin that i have traded  in and out 
Now I am cashed up from a land investment can't see investing any more in crypto  this time
I look at crypto as an investment not as money 
every time BTC  moves up a few percent, millions of traders
sell bring the price down again .
I only see BTC jumping ahead when their is a threat of war as when the Rocket man up set Japan and the South
they were buying up big time
no new investors are going to jump on the gravy train while it is stopped or going back wards .
There are other investment that give a return that BTC is competing against 
When I trade I it seems like I am biting the hand that feeds me .

Okay. Paid my taxes. Let’s gooo

Doh!
So buy the resistance? Go for it.. 
I think we could well reach $10-$11k by the end of April.
Probably 9k before the end of this week
Nobody knows. We are still in bear market so trade carefully.
Yes... coming soon
Lol no!
To be honest, I wouldn’t mind if it just stayed here  in the 8k range for a few months while I accumulate more.  It’s just more fun when it goes up obviously. 
I concur....now is a great time to buy as sentiment has shifted in favour of the buyers.  IMHO of course
I want a hodl squeeze!
im scared hold me
Sam Walton was a one of a kind open minded genius. I read he was arrested in South America for measuring isle width in a shop, which he said was in case he could learn something new.
Bitcoin community has a long way to come until we can even comprehend his levels, hopefully it’ll happen eventually. Discussion reminding us of the developments like this is paving the way. Keep it up
I agree with most of this; however, I do believe it's OK to day trade a very small percentage of total stack, because it can be fun and if you are good at it, you can accumulate more bitcoin.  It's really just gambling though.  Hodling has worked out better for me so far.

Hey oracle, can you also forecast what will be for lunch in my work cafeteria tomorrow? I forgot to take a look at the menu today, so I need to know if I should have breakfast

Be patient. An organic gain of $1000 should take a bit. 
Let the engine rattle.
Sure, let's do it!
People are just not interested in Bitcoin right now. Need positive news.
This time last year it was like a tenth if what it is today. Some bear.
It is ending. Just takes time to build a foundation for the next leg up. At the very least we need a trading channel and that requires a series of lows to show us where the support levels are. 
Shrimp and white wine.
Depends on which country.

In USA, you are also liable for gains when trading between other coins.

And a good morning to you fine sir. :)
Boring? 
So a dying cat that has not absolutely died is guaranteed to spring to life?  Nice logic.
What the fuck does correction mean anymore? It’s correcting randomly and sporadically.
Exactly, if the price really doesn't cross that line, we are still in a bull market. 
It's so predictable now when it already happened
I know look at the number of buy limits compared to sell limits. It looks good. 
Too late. As. I've reiterated many times, there are no support levels.
No, this last push was like Hitlers last offensive in the Ardennes, but now the panzers are out of fuel and an easy target.
It looks like the 5m and 15m charts are more important than the 1h when the 6h is on an upswing.  Watching closely now as we hit the bottom of the 5m dip.

Edit: some clown downvoting me.  Watch the jump as the moving averages cross on the 5m chart.
I think it's still too soon to say that.
Lol
no
It was a dead cat mouse
Dude. Shut the fuck up. You’re not a salesman.

Tax deadlines also differ in other coutries. Tax selloffs (if that is what is happining) should continue till month end. But propably in lower volumes.

fuck off kid 
Pretty bullish of you. my gut is pointing in the opposite direction.

Wait until tomorrow, price gonna drop even more because of US taxes.
Yeah, for sure man. You've been spouting out the same sales pitch day after day, "last chance" "Fire sale". 

Who knows, maybe next week you'll give the ol' "Mega extended clearance sale! Get them while they're hot! Last chance for sure this time!"
No.
Without a 1099...nobody reported your gains the IRS so..eff them. My tax person said there's no process for that shit without a 1099, you are just calling unneeded attention to yourself if you reported the gains...they are going for whales they dont care about the little fish..at least for now
I thought it was $600? 
I think 20K comes from the fact that Coinbase was compelled to turn over to the IRS a list of clients who's transaction's for the year exceeded 20k total.  

I think $600 comes from the 1099 filing requirement.  An employer can pay someone up to $600 before he has to file a 1099.

The gory details of how much you can make and when you must file a return are [here](https://www.thebalance.com/are-you-required-to-file-a-tax-return-3192868)
It could go either way really hard. Timing matters. If Bitcoin goes up when Dow Jones goes down, the dam will burst. Bitcoin to the Moon. 
Why?
Heeeeeeey. False. :P
Give us an example of what it might be useful for, and we’ll let you know.
The irony in this statement is painful.
How will anyone buy a house without taking out debt?
Sure, there are people who live beyond their means, spending money they don't have using debt.

But what has that got to do with BTC?  Oh, you mean there are people out there willing to loan out their BTCs with no interest?  Why don't you loan me yours?
New York? Their plans never change. "Fuck over whoever we can to get ahead."
Sorry - nobody knows.  A lot of people pretend to.  Maybe some have a better insight.  But if it was truthfully known, we'd all be rich - and that isn't possible (yet!)

For example, I'm a hodler.  If I'd known 19k was the ATH in late December, I could have sold all my BTC, and re-bought at under 6k in Feb, and have 3x as many.

But I had no idea what was going to happen.  So I hodled.

I've actually lost nothing in BTC terms - except for the 'opportunity cost' of having more.

But it was zero risk.

I only paid 600 USD for my BTCs when I bought them a few years back - so who's complaining when they are at about 8k each now (and the probability of hitting that ATH easily again - but would I sell then..........)

(no.)
I think you accidentally
that covefe moment.
bobbytabl3s, did you forget to sanitize your inputs again?
No, it's only that certain loud trolls come here, when
HODL is just a meme
Sure, if you got the land to raise them on!
Cuz it dropped to 7950? Lmao 
The short term moving average is still above long term on the 6hr chart, so no.
You wish 
None American here so not entirely sure how your tax system works but Im curious. How long can you guys defer the payment for? And whats the penalty/interest like for not paying?
Based on what is being presented I've successfully determined you do not work in the financial industry.  
Terrible advice. You’re suggesting that they hodl until prices go up and pay the interest fee’s plus what they’ll owe for next tax season. 
Who the fuck reports to  those cucks?
This will be the last week for these sub 9k prices. Buy it up!
I don't like the way you said "real markets start now" friend. This is an international currency that never sleeps.
This whole thing about weekend-mondays-fridays-wakingup-sleep just makes me cringe. 
It's not NASDAQ or NIKKEI that it would close and open at certain times. 
[deleted]
The American tax system sucks.  

It discourages people from investing and taking risks.  Capital gain tax should be abolished.
no, April 17 (tax day) does not mean bitcoin must rise to prove the dip was tax selling.

think about it,  say you owe $8,000 in taxes because of 2017 trading,  and TODAY you have no fiat and 1 bitcoin.

Do you sell your bitcoin to pay your taxes?

Or do you take Uncle Sam up on his generous offer to let you wait a month,  and pay $60.10 for the privilege?  If bitcoin doubles in one month,  you only have to sell 1/2 your bitcoin to pay your taxes.  

Many will do similar math and take the risk.  That's what happened in 2001. 
I am going to get downvotes but I tried tethering up last night right before the huge red candle down from 8.4, and my sat ratio has increased beautifully. I have set stops and just want to say if you see an opportunity to make money, take it. 

Edit: I have never tethered before this
> It also means that all the doom and gloom from last week and predictions of $4k bitcoin is now over. 

How exactly does this mean the possibility of $4k bitcoin is over? 

There have been spikes all the way down from 20k.
Nobody did that. They were just starting to buy in. If you won’t buy in at $8100 now why the hell would you buy in at $8100 later after a big drop? Makes no sense at all. By that logic you're heading for consistently lower highs is all.
I agree. The 4,500 sentiment is nonsense. The trigger event was due to a hack. Without the hack, why would BTC move down and lose 50% of its value? People have to realize that the market is cyclical, meaning even in bull markets, there is oscillation or back and forth movement. It is part of the game.    
que?
On what basis besides tax day are you guys getting this feeling?
I hope it will break the wall of 8500. Bitcoin having a hard time to break it
Not today dude. BTC got denied pretty hard at 8150$.
1 day chart?  Not sure what you mean when it's down 3.4%.

Not earth shaking but definitely not upwards.
just a hair more
Yep, US president does pay taxes.  

He's also not the only US president who has filed Bankruptcy.  Some of our greatest presidents have done this at different points of their life.

Edit:  Oh I see you've gone back to delete the part we were discussing here.  Pity.
The president has hundreds of companies and some have went bankrupt. 

I can assure you many many many people on Reddit have went bankrupt and avoided paying honest people for there good and services. 

When a company declares bankruptcy the individual is protected. 
You are absolutely retarded. 
Who knows?? He wouldn't even release his tax returns!
Looks like your basic survey bs repacked with Bitcoin instead of "survey dollars".

There is usually a hundred hoops to jump through just to get payout and the limits are set ridiculously high, or with stupid hidden Fees everywhere. Typically, buy the time you actually get paid, you'll have made an equivalent of like 1/hr or something.
They all will report to the IRS, so just learn from this tax season and pay your taxes, if you don't want to pay taxes on crypto don't invest it.
They all will.
Use a decentralized exchange
I hope they do.  Paying taxes is just a part of the game, on all levels.  
It’s a longterm type of game.
You have taken the Red pill.  Welcome back to the real world.
you post here all the time. Seriously, how much money have you raised doing this? No bullshit.
I just sent you a lil something :)
#Listen up everybody! LemosineRidin paid his taxes. You can start to buy now!#
Dude, it always does that. Lol
>Im afraid to be late for the train

Anybody who bought in during December is probably wishing they'd have bought in now instead.
Was that a half assed beat around the bush way of begging? 
Already did@ 8000
Bullish
Yes. It was a pretty good suggestion. We cannot predict what's this market will happen but of course we do hope that it will be bullish
*hodl me
All the best :)
I agree I have a small portion which I use to day trade so I don't really care or fall for Fomo with it. I've made about 2K with it so far.
[deleted]
disagree. There’s plenty of people interested hence the taking of profits.
Yeah, I see your point. But I sure would like to see support at 9.5 instead of the blasted 6.8k. It’s really getting annoying........and I’m whining- bleh!
I'll buy your dead cat, $10/btc
Yeah that's exactly what I said, you're so smart... If you believe that this industry is not dying literally right now and has any kind of future, then its very continued existence and progression (however quickly or slowly) bring new natural growth and investment as it advances- up to and way past the ATH, whenever that may be
It’s not random when you know what to look for.
Can you blame them? Who draws conclusions from 5min charts? lul
Yeah! shut the fuck up DONNIE.
Why so serious?
Chill bruz
ooops
Nah. I'll stick around. :)
Makes sense. Tax filing fatigue might put many people off for days.
crypto doesn't revolve around the US like everyone thinks it does. Just like futures etc, this will have little impact. 
Tommorow? I thought today was the last day of taxes
Yeah like those car lots that are always “going out of business sale” for 10 years straight 
Thank you! Fans like you are my biggest motivation!
guys guys, I found a shorter 🤓notice how shorters always seem to pop up when

> $600 


It's your total gross income. That means adding up any money you made in 2017 from work, coinage, youtube, etc. 
 If you made <10k last year, you probably dont' have to file, but you also probably will get money back if you do file.

https://www.hrblock.com/tax-center/filing/do-i-have-to-file-taxes/ 



They will want to hide some funds there.
I got a few hundred dollars in and lost a little. I am considering adding to my tiny pot, and work toward owning a single bitcoin, but if I go that route I might get a wallet. $8k is a LOT of money to me.
We are ALL HODLers on this blessed day
mom?
ever notice how people in this sub always seem to
Till now gradual changes held but rapid jumps either way did not. This $1000 pump will result in $1000 dump. When you zoom out the graphs you will see that this is just another bounce off on its way down, and it is smaller every time.
its down 4% man, these kids think its gonna drop 30% lol. weak hands
The late payment penalty is capped at 25%.  It accrues at 0.5% per month on the balance owed.

The interest is the Federal Reserve Rate plus 3 points,  so now it is about 3%.

You can just pay the interest forever I guess,  if you wanted. 
Where I live, we can pay by monthly instalment through the year - interest free :)
I've actually spent a lot of time in large financial data centers.  Many years ago I configured some of the first Sun workstations sent to Lehman brothers in early 1990's,  they were being used to develop the first trading bots, derivatives, etc.  I was at State Street Bank in Boston on Oct 27, 1997,  touring the data center,  as we left we passed a trading floor of some kind,  glass walls between me and them.  I watched as they reacted to the mini-flash crash that occurred that day.  10 years prior I lost about $20,000 in the 1987 crash. I'm just a dumb ass posting shit on the Internet.
I'll do the math for you:

Say you owe $8,000 in taxes for 2017 and have no fiat to pay.

Say you have 3 bitcoin valued on tax day at $8,000.

Do you sell 1 bitcoin on tax day and pay your tax?

Or do you decide 'my bitcoin will double in one month',  so I'll file and NOT pay for a month.

In one month my taxes due are now 8000 plus 40 (8000 * 0.5)  plus  20.10 (8040 * (.03/12)) or a total of $8060.10.

So bitcoin has doubled in one month,  so I sell 1/2 of a bitcoin to settle up with the IRS,  (I find the $60.10 in the sofa). 

I saved 1/2 bitcoin for a risk of $60.10,  not bad.

All that said,  I personally think this is a terrible risk,  because I don't think bitcoin will go up much at all any time soon.

EDIT:  interest compounds daily,  my crude calculation of $20.10 is slightly low.
Gee can you tell the future?
it might not even go above 8900 this week.....
Murica!
I've observed a pretty clear timezone bias though. US/NA is generally bullish, EU tends to be bearish, and Asians make the market.
> the deadline was in March for using gains and losses to have effect on 2017 taxes

That is wrong.  The only deadlines in the U.S. are fiscal (Jan 1 - Dec 31) for financial transactions,  then there is the tax filing deadline , this year it is April 17.  

Tax related selling is real.

The sudden end of tax related selling on April 17 is a myth.  The tax hangover due to so many falling into the tax trap will last for months.

The first big dip was caused by over speculation the second crash was caused by taxes. People who were smart cashed out early at the 2nd peak at 11k and the others frantically followed. 
Maybe it's the reason why a lot of companies and Americans are migrating to Asia.
Capital gains is a reasonable tax in my opinion. Which tax would you increase if you abolished CGT?
The US takes heavy taxes but still has a HUGE 20T$+ debt
Thats just plain stupid and that kind of thinking is why a person got there in the first place. Anytime there is a taxable transaction a person should be thinking tax forward and setting aside a portion of those gains to pay for tax owed.
So the guy own 1 BTC (=8000$ investment, arguably less if invested a while ago) but do not have a few bucks to pay taxes? Give a cookie to that man!
You did the right thing as most 'experts' had calculated that it was going to drop - so why sit and wait for it to happen? You're stops mean you can jump back in when the market moves.  
Well, let's assume price reflects popular sentiment. Let us think about the other drops that occurred: Korea bans BTC and price drops. Mt.Gox hacked and price drop again. If you think about it, who really drives the price of BTC. The people. With a fair number of bulls and bears in the market, there is no reason for a drop to 4K. If, however, BTC crosses a certain point of no return then we can start worrying. As we have seen with the double bottom at 6.4K, no such bottom really exist so far. 
Well I did that and made myself a nice 13% gain. Now waiting a few hours/days for the next crash to get back in. Rince, repeat.
So why exactly then am I gaining about 1% per hour ? 
Talking about the short term moving average about to cross the long term moving average on the one day chart on gdax.  We’re close. 
Could you list them?
Trump was bailed out by the banks that's why he's now repaying them by lifting restrictions.
I was only posing a question, as so many Americans are on here worried about tax returns of a few hundred dollars or less.
Precisely.
It's not a requirement for the president to release his ~~birth certificate~~ taxes.
but why would Coinbase buy it then?  There must be something valuable going on
"Bitcoin isn't controlled by the government or by anyone" sike... If we still gotta pay taxes to the IRS we still in control. Shiet....
Why would a foreign government be compelled to report to USA? What if you took a vacation and bought some bitcoin. Just remember 12 words and cross the border. 
Imagine being this cucked. 
someone sent him 1 transaction, and now like a bird who's been fed 1 chip, he will not disappear 

You are just a troll lol haha
I guess in light of the big moves over the past few days these just seem pointless.

Day dreaming baby. Buy GPRO instead
Should have said cloudy with a Chance of meatballs
It's NOT dead!  It's just dying and it's $8,055!  

No wait, it's $8,037.  

Wait wait, it's $8,044.

Yeah, doesn't work well as a currency :P
It depends on what the other charts are doing.  Lol


lol!
Damn he saw right through you bruh.

He's also a Bitconnect fan. Poor guy, gets burned all the time...
I've heard that crypto exchanges aren't required by the irs to send out 1099's yet. But the irs also requested all the trade info from coinbases customers, so they likely know. At what price they will pursue you, idk.
They email it to you if you met that $20k/500 transactions 
...be gay like that Bobby guy.
Do you even want crypto/bitcoin to succeed or why post such bullshit without any basis?
It wasnr even a pump, get your arguments straight
Lol ... don't jinx it.

Welcome to the club, I'm right there with ya!  Would be super fun to tour a place like that during any sort of tumultuous event (up or down).  Sounds neat!
\> configured some of the first Sun workstations

so youre an IT guy

great financial expertise d00d

I ate at a Japanese Michelin* restaurant once, it means that I'm a sushi chef now, I absorbed it through a gradient by osmosis, muahaha!
> All that said, I personally think this is a terrible risk

What? You are the guy who gave the advice in the first place. Like: "It might be a wise thing to HODL, and pay the penalty and interest". 


Yes.
**FUCK YEAH**
[deleted]
well duh......

the problem is while 'we' are conservative,  most here are not.


What the fuck does taxable transaction mean? So every time I have a slight gain I have to pay taxes on it? Does that mean I get to write off every time I sold at a massive loss?
> Well, let's assume price reflects **manipulation & continuous trade washing**. Let us think about the other drops that occurred: Korea bans BTC and price drops. Mt.Gox hacked and price drop again. If you think about it, who really drives the price of BTC. The **bots**. 

Fixed this for you
It's dropped from 20k to 8k in a very short space of time, there is no reason to assume it's stopped dropping.
1% per hour over the last hour?

or 1% per hour over the last 3 months?
... aaand it's gone.
Ah .... ok, understood.
Abraham Lincoln, William McKinley, Thomas Jefferson, and Ulysses S. Grant
I could fist them
Bullshit.  You just want to throw shade at President Trump.  Saw you posting on here about him yesterday.
Yes, this is true but he initially he said he would, then he said he wouldn't because Clinton wasn't asked to do so, then he made up the lame ass excuse that his returns were being audited.....
There is, for coinbase. Their interest is in making *their* money, not making you money. I'm not saying it's a scam, but I am saying it's highly unlikely that you're going to make worthwhile money.
Bitcoin isn't. Exchanges *are*.
Not a government, but an exchange. Why? Because they will want to continue to operate in the U.S., legally. They already need to do a KYC to do so.

Of course, there are ways to obtain Bitcoin anonymously. But they are a bit more complicated. If you want to go through the hassle, try https://bisq.network/ or https://localbitcoins.com/
Ha, fair enough.  I'm pretty conservative in my approach and do not break the rules.  You can certainly make more living on the edge (for a while), so enjoy the fruits of your investments!
He hasn't posted a single actual comment since his accounts inception. It's all just btc address, fucking twat is too lazy to so much as come up with a sob story.

People can't even be bothered to put effort into begging anymore. Smh
The internet wasn't awesome for downloading things 20 years ago either. Had to grow. 
Nah.
Nah. They're around.

Can I interest you in a 2013 Hummer? Never been driven.
I think you are the one that does not want it to succeed. What crypto needs is adoption, a widespread use. This is where its value would come from, from usefulness. You want everyone to own some and slowly drive its value up. Whole 2017 was a bull run that only hurt it. It attracted day traders, and bots, that increased volatility and concentrated crypto in quite small number of wallets that can shake the market. It made Bitcoin a store of value, a speculative asset, not a currency. It's like gold now, and can you pay for anything with gold directly today? It needs to drop hard, sub $1000 or even $500, and stay like that. Shake off the parasite who want it to moon in a year. Become stable.  
Regarding your last sentence, "it wasnr even a pump". How would you call a rise by 15% in 30 minutes? An organic demand? Sure you can attach events like declaring Bitcoin halal, but it does not check out.
He didnt buy at 6500
It was some kind of international currency arbitrage type operation.  It was maybe 20 guys,  they were totally distracted by a few big screens,  ignoring their little screens on their desks.  Some signs of anxiety,  but, actually I think it just moved the boring meter from 10 down to 7.
IF YOU BELIEVE it will go up, it was in the bullet points just before that statement.  I don't know if it will double, I personally don't think it will,  but many firmly believe it could,  and may want to take that risk.  So why not talk about it?

edit: punctuation
Can confirm.
The people who sell due to taxes are those that have fallen into the 'tax trap'.  I don't know how many crypto investors have fallen into a tax trap in 2017.   In 2000 because of the Internet stock crash,  it was probably 10% , a rough guess based on how many people I knew who day traded in 2000 and who got stuck in a tax trap.  

The tax trap is actually pretty easy to fall into when an asset bubble crashes so close to the fiscal year change.   



I had to sell some btc to pay for taxes. I am sure a lot of people had to as well. The selloff could be very well and in part due to taxes.
Exactly, a lot of people in the US got burned and they are doing the exact same thing again for 2018 tax’s for next year. 
Yes
Since Asian session. Just talking about the day. 
Not going to try convince you. Just watch and cry in your beer. 
Harry S Truman went broke after his presidency and Congress actually started to issue post-presidency pensions because of him.
That's going back a long way.  Can you not find someone more recent?  Like, 20th or 21st century?
He deserves shade, the guy doesn't understand the importance of the office of the president.
btw he works for earn.com.  He's trying to tricks people (faux interest in a useless website)  ;)
Oh you're right 
Thanks. I’ll check it. My question was, why would a foreign company have to report to irs? There are UK exchanges. They don’t have to report to irs (a foreign agency).  
Ha :) I am all for paying taxes if the State is looking out for interests of the native population. However this is clearly not the case in the majority of Western countries.
Absolutely.

But greed has fuelled exchanges and speculators, which led to volatile prices and killed adoption.  

I frankly don't see a way to break this ecosystem.
postmarked by tomorrow actually, today is considered a holiday and the 15th was on a weekend. April 17th is tax day for this year 
Surely you are aware that in this forum, most people wants to see things ONLY in a positive light, no matter how ridiculous.  Its a classic syndrome of people trapped in a bubble and can't see outside of it.

When there's a $1,000 pump, it's "organic" and when there's a $300 drop, there's an uproar about price manipulation.  Being retarded takes on a whole new level here with declarations that fiat is doomed but same authors crap their pants when there's less fiat for each BTC.

Anyway, it's just entertainment, don't take it too seriously and enjoy the wild rides.
The real tax trap is pay 30% capital gains on trades less than a year for every taxable transaction. American taxes are extremely cruel and completely out of touch. So if you sell a portion at the top- boom. taxable transaction take that money buy where you think its low at the bottom and it drops again-you get squeezed, sell. boom. taxable transaction. If you are trading large and you owe a sizable tax - you pull btc out to pay it. boom. taxable transaction for next year. I honestly hate those fuckers but I paid my damn tax.

You were saying?
I'm a holder. I cry when it goes down.
Yes!  A really fun read for anybody that doesn't know about this.
McKinley is in the 20th century.
Still better than Hilly. 
Bullish
They may will have to, if they want to continue to serve customers in the U.S.
Thing is, all the transactions are on the ledger and it's pretty easy for the govt to ask for a transaction log and a log of US customers and then map those back together to your SSN and know if you didn't pay taxes on gains/losses or not..
To me that's an entirely separate issue.  Never did I say I *want* to pay taxes, or that I feel the use of my tax dollars are well spent.  It's the law, though.  I follow the law to the letter.  
>There's not many cases where that would make sense,


Oh man, how wrong,  like I said it's pretty easy to fall into a tax trap when an asset crashes so close to the end of the year.

Unless you sell high and buy low.
My understanding is that if you're trading back and forth between BTC and fiat, each trade into fiat is taxable, and therefore these folk end up with a large tax bill even if they have everything back in BTC at the time. To cover the cost, they then have to sell. 
That was very disappointing. We're starting to fall very far behind where Bitcoin was this time last year. So either we're going to have a bad year or at some point this thing is going to run like the clappers. 
I don't. 
Picky.  Assassinated in post, second term.  1901.
I’m all done here but just wanted to say you’re an idiot if you think that.
That kind of behavior Is what leads to things like the Holocaust. Your complicit nature is dehumanizing.
Are you saying that, for example, I sell BTC for $1000, then I buy BTC for $800, I will have to pay tax for $1000 and not for $200 in the USA? Sounds unbelievable to me and would kill off all day trading right away.


got some popcorns
Picky?  Okay, that's fine.  Starting to think you're just looking for an argument (which I won't provide).
Of course you do.  ;)
Wow.  TIL.
Yes. You pay only on the gains and we all know there were a lot of gains in 2017 and if you sell in less than a year its short term gains at 30%. American crypto taxes are FUCKED.
Example: you bought at 400 sell at 1000 buy back at 800. you’d be taxed on the 600$ and if the gains were claimed in less than a year you’d owe 30% 180$. If you were an early investor a person made some serious gains and if they weren’t doing the research regarding capital gains. They OWE a LOT of money. It’d be interesting to get a World consensus to see what other Countries do as I realize that we are not at the center of the World.
It's going to blow any moment now. 
Well, you eventually found a president who served throughout the 19th century, but was assassinated in Sept. 1901.

My point stands.

There is no president of the US in recent history, or living memory, who has been bankrupted.  Not only once, but numerous times.

I'll let it go.  But it is a matter of fact and something to consider, because bankruptcies hurt a lot of innocent people.  To emerge unscathed from them may well be legal, but it is hard to see it as moral.
Oh, I may have been a little to hardcore there but it's our responsibility to challenge and question the government at every turn.
Ok, I get it. You pay the difference between buy and sell price on each position you close. If you reinvest, you can't deduct the reinvested amount right away, you have to wait until you close the new position and then deduct losses or pay more taxes. That's correct?

What a fuckup. Say you buy at $500, then sell at $1000 because you expect a drop, and set a buy stop 5% higher. Didn't drop, your buy stop gets executed, and not only do you have to pay $1050 to get back in, but also you now owe $150 tax? On the other side, you need a drop of 15% just to break even in this setup? Fucking unbelievable.

Where I live, you basically pay taxes for the amount you take out, minus the amount you put in. It's declared as income tax.

I think the same. It went down not that much and now going up. Seems like 9000 will be reached today and then slowly gonna go down and up again
As far as I can tell this is the first time you've asserted a point.  This conversation started by you asking questions, which were answered at face value.  How was I to know you intended to hide a point within your open question?  
I agree.  But until change is met one must pay their taxes (or face consequences).  I'm unwilling to face the consequences of not paying my taxes, so I will pay them in full and I won't even think of doing otherwise.  I don't judge those that do differently, but I do dismiss those that criticize my approach as unethical.  

How to go about changing tax structure, how taxes are utilized, et cetera....well that's an entirely different conversation, and I suspect we'd have a lot of agreements in *that* conversation.  
My point is that Trump is an international embarrassment and is shaming the USA.

Sorry to not have made that clearer.
