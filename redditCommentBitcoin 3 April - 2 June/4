Daily Discussion, May 30, 2018 -- TITLE
I'm going to shut up one week as protest
This Italy/Euro news is the biggest crypto news in a while.

If Italy ditches the Euro the value will plummet.  Italians who saved in Euros will see steep drops in their savings once they are converted back to the Lire.

It probably won‚Äôt pass but even so, this is a huge reminder why decentralized currencies should be more trusted than those printed by governments.
I doubt that we'll hit a lower low. 

And if we don't, we're still in a reversal and the start of a new uptrend.

If we do, then I'll simply buy a little more...
[Thought of this lately](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ko0ZwKmhyw)
Bye bye shorters üëãüèª 
I wish I had enough bitcoin to manipulate the market.
Bart Simpson is back! So predictable...So tiresome..
have we all seen this?
https://cryptovest.com/news/mcafee-announces-his-mcafee-redemption-unit-to-be-launched-on-june-25/
I just thought about what if Korean exchanges are doing mass arbitrage? It's really really illegal in Korea sooooo... yeah.

June will be big. 15k incoming.
Imagine the possibilities if bcrap was taken out of the equation. Cmon regs....get on with it damnit! 
They‚Äôre killing the faith I used to carry with me about thIs shit. Someone wake me up after this so called Bart shit stops 
Price looks good for buying.  I just grabbed $500 worth.
Long time holder, first time spender. Makes me realize the amazing utility of BTC, but I imagine a big BOOM will happen when the ‚Äòfriction‚Äô of making transactions is reduced. If you‚Äôre not really certain on how mining fees, the transaction process, and even submitting a transaction works, it can be a little intimidating, even for someone fairly tech-savvy. I imagine there‚Äôs got to be a way devs can get things to a point where making a transaction can be as seem-less/easy as using Applepay/Androidpay. Can anyone share insight on this? Maybe something is already in the works? 
Lol, we down just for 130$, but you started a screaming 
People wake up. The biggest manipulators are the bitcoin trading platforms. They make agreements for pump and dumps, don't you understand this?
Apart from the winnings when buying a coin, they also suck your money away. It is best not to trade but only to buy in the dip and hodl. They too are watching these kinds of forums for the sentiment among the people
Bcash is so untrusted that Wu is defending himself against accusations that his miners carried out the BTG 51% attack.

Hypothetically, lets say you write down 23 words of your 24 word seed, leaving off one word that you commit to memory.  How difficult does that make it to access the address for someone who found those 23 words?  Then, how many words would you need to leave off the list to make it next to impossible for a person who found the list to access that address without knowing the missing words?

It is concerning that top cryptocurrency sites are falling in traffic rankings. From July -> Jan these sites all continued to see increased traffic even with the down periods in price.

List some rankings here [bitcointalk](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/bitcointalk.org), [coinmarketcap](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/coinmarketcap.com), [binance](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/binance.com), [coindesk](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/coindesk.com), [cointelegraph](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/cointelegraph.com), [coinbase](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/coinbase.com), [bittrex](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/bittrex.com)

Yikes


 
There goes my lambo
Hi, when ultra moon to 20k.
New TA approach \-\> What goes up is manipulated, expect it to come down and then some
Triple bottom to 6700 and we go for 12k
What are we expecting today?
Just bought more. Get it while its hot ! 
7.5 meme?

 :)
breakout to 7.8k soon
3k pump coming I can FEEEEEEEEL it
Im at the break even point and I may just cash it out and get back in when (if ) things stabilize.
Are we touching up Bart's left eyebrow,  or is it a fake Bart?  Time will tell.
There goes the bear run, byeee
I feel like calling out big money here.  Show your face other than skateboard barting up and down these streets.  The ceiling is the Roof!!!
bitcoin arises from the dead
Sell walls getting chewed up.
Pop.

first...
No regulation = manipulation
Bear markets end when the last true believer finally sells.

Friday pump tomorrow.  And some Holiday pay for my middle class plus investors üëèüèª
Okay bitcoin. I got my paycheck hitting my account in 2 hours, don‚Äôt you go any higher than 7500 till then. 
Past day looks like a bull flag, especially after yesterday's convincing volume. There seems to be a lot of buy pressure keeping the price aways from yesterday's lows. A rise to 7700-7750 is very plausible and would be an opportune price range to enter a short.
The bloody turd is real.
How is this ever going to work if every time the valuation goes up a couple hundred USD some douchebag pushes it back down?  This is manipulated like a motherfucker.
6k here we come! Fuck I should of just went to Vegas
You guys need to seriously follow TA, this dump close to guarantee to complete the triple bottom. Stop your crying noobs
What happens when McAfee is wrong about his June prediction?  Does he eat a ball/nutt?  Do people stop listening to him because he's crazy?
Is it the build-up of a reversal? Time will tell...
McAfee should just eat his dick when his June forecast fails instead of dragging it on 2.5 years.  Dude is bat shit crazy and has no idea what he is is talking about.

He founded a company almost nobody gives a shit about at this point.  

He is irrelevant and is attempting to stay relevant by making ridiculous claims.
And then they ask me if I'm on the medication after my argument from yesterday. After the first pump I said that asia would give a small pump to make it look real. after which it would collapse again. When I said that there would not be a madman to buy 1k bitcoins, but that that was a whale, I was declared insane. So my advice, do not buy anything for a while and let the whales ruin their own trade.
üé∂ The bears are back in town üé∂
get ready for the dumpening, ready yourselves for the bloody red turd to drop.

the whales that bought at 7k are waiting for it to hit 7700, or 7900 then theyre gonna dump hard and its gonna drop into the 6k's, then continue on down.  btc is being pushed down further and further.
By using the Bart Model, my TA predicts a $200 spike within the hour.
FEAR, THE ENEMY OR ANOTHER SUCCESSFUL MAN?

Friends, let's talk about fear, this text requires your thoughtful reading, only then you will feel its influence and the proper effect of the right settings. Although my pardon for some pieces that would be ridiculous to simplify depriving intellectual load.

To understand that fear as a great motivator, and the main enemy of a man setting great goals, let's look at the example of one famous film "The Dark Knight: the Restoration of the Legend." As you remember the hero, trying to get out of the pit trying to make the final jump without fear of death, only after the edification of one of his cellmates, he again felt fear, it was this metamorphosis of the spirit that helped him get out and make the final successful leap to freedom. But what is fear in business and in particular such as the manipulation of crypt?

It would seem that the answer is obvious, and fear is the main scourge to be burned with iron, while most successful people have become successful due to fear not realizing themselves, fear of remaining at the same level, fear of continuing to ride their whole lives on the bus and never seeing envious glances gapers accompanying you on an expensive Mercedes.

In order not to enter into a long and fruitless philosophy and to maximally turn fear into a weapon of your desires, you should follow a simple but wise formula:

¬†A.\) Fear should not be overwhelming, it must accompany any initiative if you are at the "0" point forcing you to work more intensively, accumulate knowledge, think, respond with the blow to blow \(if required\) and experience a neurotic dissatisfaction with your current dispositions. At the same time, by "overwhelming" I mean that if fear is incomprehensible, if it becomes a tyrant not allowing you to associate two words in an interview, an important presentation or an examination, this is not the positive fear that we need, for any fear that is beginning to be the main scourge that you must send it to the trash can. It's about your fear of not success, that great motivator that awakens in you the desire to cultivate, including if you need to have yourself. I'm sure I do not need to talk about the perniciousness of the state of peace and contentment for the ambitious personality that accompanies the life of most people. They weave their lives from the search for the destruction of the discomfort of the internal states, the minimal need to survive, thereby displacing the fear of failure and have the opposite psychological attitude \- the fear of starting, whereas your fear is the fear of not bringing it to the end, the fear of not achieving the desired level gives you a clear advantage over these people, who will forever remain cogs of the system. As Dostoevsky wrote, "the thirst for education is aristocratic thirst", i.e. the one who wants to be educated already sees himself equal to the best representatives of society, while the one who supersedes the image of the future will never have it.

¬†B.\) In my experience, I should note that when you have already left the "0" point and you can breathe with proper comfort and say to yourself, "I'm worth something," then another approach to such a strong phenomenon of human nature as fear. Since success has already been achieved, the goal is the preservation of the acquired benefits, and it already requires a sober calculation and a cold head, where there is no room for fear, as in a casino, having won a solid sum, you need to say to yourself: "Stop, sooner or later the red will drop out and I will lose everything ! " only an idiot continues to raise rates, Afraid not to win more and sooner or later suffers a fiasco returning to that very point ZERO.

So, as you can see, to get out of the hole shown in the film you must fearfully remain afraid to stay in it and not making the desired, but getting out and reaching the height your guiding task is to search for a fearless and pragmatic approach to the routine of life. Guided by these simple psychological techniques, you will sooner or later get out of the hole of obscurity, neurosis, and poverty, become the lords of fear and the leaders of your fearlessness, becoming a successful crypto

lol if italy leaves euro will jump up 30%
If Italy ditched the Euro, the country would see unforeseen economic consequences... I'm talking about riots in the streets, pure madness. 

There's no procedure for such decision.

For example, Brexit is already a complete mess and the UK never joined the Euro. An EU country leaving the Euro also means leaving the EU. It would be a complete shit-storm to the very own global economy. 


The value of bitcoin has plummeted recently, how exactly is it more trustworthy than the Euro?
Wouldn't it be the other way around? If Italy ditches the Euro it will soar because it won't be held back by Italy anymore.  Because the Euro is pretty much Germany and France anyway...
Everyone is saying it might go to 6900 before June 6th. I would wait and buy on June 6th.
Wise words. Never sell, always buy. Only sell when you reach the Great Moon
Dude, the number of shorts grew by over 1k positions today.

Either there are a lot of brave traders around or they know something that we don't.

Starting to agree man. It‚Äôs annoying at least 
Barts on the 1h chart are a good sign because they indicate an attempt by the market to get an EMA crossover on the 6h chart which brings the big upward swings when they happen.  
The guy just loves to keep busy!
Korean justice system is very strict about financial fraud cases. Hence, I don't think exchanges do not risk their billion dollar business to get some more money. They already getting a lot of revenue from fees.
Bitcoin price should be the same across the board, there should be no difference based on platform/exchange. I highly believe they are doing other activities as well...i.e suspending withdrawals/deposits prior to runs/drops ex: BCN. 


Mcafee prediction agrees 
ye the same way people called for February back to 20 k that also worked out nice :\)
I think that in the long (and even medium) term, Bcash investments eventually fold back into BTC.

No-one trusts it; no-one likes it, and it is run by known scammers.
Nothing much will happen.  It's 1/10 of BTC.

We're on a downcycle of the 6h chart, we'll see a lot of "barts" (upcycles on the 1h chart) until one of them causes an EMA crossover on the 6h chart and we enter an upcycle.
Not just the apps but more importantly, acceptance by merchants.

But to be candid, there's very little interest to make this successful.  Almost every piece of news is about BTC's price.  That's what is dominating the public's mindshare and that's why adoption has been a failure.
NFC + Lightning Network is being worked on https://www.coindesk.com/lightning-nfc-new-plan-bring-bitcoin-retail/amp/
I honestly want to ask the same question 
if everyone just bought and held and nobody traded tell me what would drive the price up?

You‚Äôre ridiculously incorrect, but there was a time I didn‚Äôt understand market fluctuations, too.  
I like to think that one day Bitcoin will be relatively stable like Gold is today but when that will happen or if it happens at all no one knows.
It would take 1024 tries for each position, or 24000 tries to try each one. You d need to try at least 4 non-consecutive words to be semi-secure
You will need to remove 24 words from a list. 
So what?

PAIN....















For the financial markets while bitcoin goes to the moon ‚úåÔ∏èüöÄüåù
I love the smell of freshly minted bitcoin in the morning.  It smells of victory.


Please don't ever do that again.
good
looks like a BART
1 more week
It's going to eat our brains!!! Run for your lives!!!
Foolishness! You plan to waste all of your profit on a consumer product!? Hodl and buy more, then you have a shot at nice savings.
You still got 1 week till 6th. Plenty of time to prepare.
This is not advice but put $50/paycheck in from now until 2030 and buy yourself 500 new iPhones.
this. they even manipulate IN regulated markets, can you imagine what they do in unregulated ones? 
So we should regulate bitcoin? I thought bitcoin's virtue was its resistance to regulation?
Bear markets never end; Us hodlers are bears' friends, they provide us with the timing to buy our coins cheap!
Hate to "bust your bubble" but tomorrow is Thursday pun intended. ;)
7700.  Let‚Äôs go green 
Did you make it? Must have been close...
Its manipulated to the point that no normal person will touch it. Everybody is talking about Adoption. When Bitcoin has a worse reputation than fucking Stratton Oakmont you might as well just sell everything you have.
Any selling whale shall become a buying whale in the future. They're just trying to rebuy at a lower price. Use them in your favor.
It's just 200-300, not even worth mentioning.
"Should have".  As a Vegas resident, yes, please come here!
In Vegas you'll always lose. Here you will win as long as you remain faithful.
Yes I think so too.
What‚Äôs ta 
As crazy as he seems ..some of his rants holds weight in a lot of what really goes on..
There was nothing wagered but it affects credibility.
people listen to him?
natuurlijk heeft hij ongelijk voor wat betreft juni
The company he founded he sold when he knew virus protection was not working anymore and irrelevant.. 7 billion he sold it for.. yep hes bat shit crazy... his crazy ass will laugh to the grave.. also he supports crypto to the fullest so thats a good thing because a lot of people do listen to him and and GREAT exposure for the entire market.. leave the old guy alone hes far done more then im assuming you ever will and have you are chasing the bitcoin dream most likely.!!
THE WORLD IS NOT ANYMORE THE WAY IT USED TO BE
Pretty sad, I bet you couldn't wait for it to drop slightly so you could say I told you so. Grow up.
Alright boys, let's wrap it up and close this subreddit. No point in ever buying anything ever again.
Oh shit, do you do private readings? I have been wanting to know what my palm says about my future. 
You predicted that at some point it would go down?  Genius.
And how exactly do you profit with that? Perhaps you don't have any BTC and wish to buy some cheap? You'd better buy it soon in that case. If you don't at all plan to buy BTC, what are you even doing here!?
Congratz, you're the first retard of the day
Do you have a pooh fixation?
I love [tags](https://gyazo.com/abb22c3e7212f31ec3a0d100d2e7534a)
look at the fitbit historical chart vs. btc...... basically identical.
I personally use the Mr. Burns 180¬∫ upside down strategy. Have yet to fail me.
tl;dr
Ok
If I had waited to buy forever, I would never have bought, and wouldn't have made a 1200% profit.
Is idiocity the root of desperation?
When are you buying?
I'm one of those idiots!
>Everyone is saying

That's why it won't...
Watch out with these predictors here, before you know it they think you are using medication
That how he keeps his dick anxiety under control üòÇ
>  I don't think exchanges do not risk their billion 

Heh
uh there's definitely a difference in price across platforms. they're almost never perfectly matched up, especially between Korean platforms and all others. Arbitrage was a big point of contention at the start of the year for Korean lawmakers.
I think his exact words were "by june"

meaning tomorrow?. I think he didn't say "by the end of June". 
> Bcash investments eventually fold back into BTC.

Or they would just go to other cryptos.
I was trying to put it in the perspective of its market cap being near 1/3 of overall loss during this year. Easier to see the positive impact of it's removal that way. That is, if that money was absorbed or re\-invested back into the market. It probably wouldn't play out that way in the short term and definitely would in the long term.
Couldn‚Äôt agree more. If more ppl got hard over infrastructure rather than price, the price would presumably be much higher imho. 
Yea! This is exactly what I was looking for, and the idea that terminals could be upgraded for $29 sounds super promising. Can‚Äôt help but wonder what the ETA might be 
If everyone just bought and held, your coins would be nothing but really boring Pokemon cards.
Let your thoughts go over there, but put your coins in you're hw
What drives the price of any other currency? Certainly there are some FA factosrs, same goes with BTC. 
Less then 15% of the total BTC is traded. Most people do buy and hodl, also a lot of BTC from the early days have been lost or discarded as well. 

and still not :)
It needs many many more users to acheive stability.
Can‚Äôt get rich from stability.  Consider yourself lucky to be an extremely early adopter. 
So if they have one word from the list, a person could access your address?  How long would this take?  Without further explanation, I'm assuming you don't really know what you're talking about.
I agree. For once I'm actually more scared about what my stocks are going to do than my bitcoin.

Takes a while for someone to adjust from high to low time preference and only the regret over time would help them to adjust accordingly
I don't know, but the whales are just ruining it for everyone
There's a thing called time-zones...
its been Thursday for ages here 


You‚Äôre wrong 
Whales still in control. I think they will supress until end of next week, then we will see the next mini bull run
I made it right at 7500 lol
Ya know what? I AIN'T FUCKING LEAVING!!
should have went... smdh
So bitcoin is a religion?
Total Asshattery
Tante Annie
Technical Analysis.
For example?
Yeah I‚Äôm not sold on his predictions (although I really want to believe), but he comes across very knowledgeable in interviews and twitter vids.  As a libertarian at heart,  I find myself nodding in agreement with many things he says. 
I understand.  It was a joke.

We all know he is insane and his predictions are ridiculous.
Awareness is Bitcoin's lifeblood.
I've been here for 5 years...  Guess how much I have.  I assure you it's more than you, genius.
Are you OK?  You seem to not be able to write sentences in proper English.  Also, your caps lock key seems to be stuck.

of course, I keep laughing ... bought at 7500?
not at the first the best pump and all kids scream moon moon moon lambo lambo
Your palm says you should better hold your toilet paper
Zei ik dat? lezen blijft lastig 
Well its way more genius than what little kids were screaming yesterday ;)
ever heard of bitmex?
>And how exactly do you profit with that?

You can short
üé∂Now I'm free.... freefallingüé∂
This made me laugh way more than it should have. Have an updoot.
not really, looks pretty spot on ATM.
I use the Death Spiral Triple Axel Counterclockwise Bart Backspin strategy. The gain curve is exponentially scaling.
HODL
He's buying now :)
Can't fight the market... I've tried many times. Just go with the flow.
Yes, I know. Definately a large gap on certain exchanges.
Tomorrow midnight in NZ, or tomorrow midnight on the US west coat. This close in it makes an 'effing big difference.
I took that to mean ‚Äúsometime in June‚Äù. Could be beginning, middle or end. 
No.

It all folds back into BTC.
LIT box by the Vertcoin devs at MIT DCI will be a nice combo with this tech.  An at home LN node that is user friendly and easy to run 24/7. One address for all LN coins. The node has mobile apps so you can make payments on the go, but you're connected to the wallet at home. 
15%of the total drove the price to 20k? i find that a little hard to believe but i cant say you are wrong..
No, I understand them very well
Agreed.
Dude, get real.  I think the number of "users" have actually been declining.  

Most of the new owners of BTC are just speculators.  Doubt if they bought it to use as a currency.
LMFOA!!  "Extremely early adopter"??  

Dude, "extremely early" was before 2013 and "early" was before 2017.   
One word? No. I imagine the difficulty of cracking it scales very quickly the less words they have. That's why just adding a special character or a capital letter to everyday passwords make them exponentially more difficult to crack.
The one idea behind seed phrase is to generate a predetermined number from which to generate a wallet. If your vocabulary is, say, 65k words, then 24 word seed phrases makes 65000^24 combinations. Each removed word makes seed phrase 65000 times easier to crack by bruteforce. If you disclose 23 words, your wallet can be recovered in seconds. 
wow. you must be into some crap stocks. I have no fear, and only see blips. my poorest performers are Disney and Comcast, but they are still way up from where I bought them. what stocks have you so concerned?
Same ... and I'm guessing you are in same situation as me - a lot more vested in stocks.  

The %drop for stocks is peanuts compared to cryptos.

Crikey.  

Wallet hacked, car crash, family wiped out, heart attack.

And then - bloody lung cancer!

You should hear my problems: whenever I step into my shower and turn it on, it momentarily blasts me with cold water until it heats up.  I just can't see a way around it.


Except for their hot wives. They get boats.
Everyone except the whales. Almost like they had a plan...!
Lulz my bad "offers vegimine sandwich".
Yup just realized.You use this one alot? Word is your all a bunch of pranksters.
Touche! 
lol i actually have a tante annie.

Watch this interview for example. He knows what's up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBgFGwJA1D0
but everyone of us hopes he doesn't have to eat that nut because that would mean ... you know
I would agree.
My bitcoin is longer then yours ;)
How have you managed to stay here for five years? The non-stop trolling and negativity is already starting to get to me after a couple of months
I dont need to guess your bitcoin wealth. i really could careless and a little tip.. i have had my own bitcoin since early 2012 
Wassa wassa wassa wassa
HE SCREAMING
Das een goeie :)

you get it ;)
finally a wise person
Oh we hit 7700 and 7900 already? 100usd massive dump? Ok
"The gain curve is exponentially scaling". You win.
Oh shiiiiiit lol 
Are these good metrics to estimate usage?

* Number of Bitcoin ATMs increasing: https://coinatmradar.com/charts/#growth
* Bitcoin lightning network growing: https://1ml.com/
None of the real early adopters are still here in the reddit threads. They are laughing at all us fools freaking out every $100 dump. Although I've seen people here say they bought at <$10 multiple times, but there's a >99% chance they are lying. 
What % of the world currently holds/uses bitcoin?   Right.... The people prior to 2017 were lunatic adopters.  Wish I was one of them.   
All of them, we are overdue for the next down cycle, where ALL the stocks are going down hard, worse than 2008.
Cheers mate :P 
Can't stand smokers smoking in front of someone who is not. Before being aware and conscious and so on, you need some level of self-control xDD
Yes but mine does tricks.
soms ben ik wel scherp ;)
so it hit 75(ish) and dropped over 200 usd, so far.
Well, it probably show more channels for speculative trading.

Show me any statistic that indicates increased number of merchants and I will be convinced.
Very tiny - only people left are hodlers, speculators and a couple of new suckers added occasionally.

Adoption has failed and nobody is interested to do anything about it.

Probably.

I already sold 20% to prepare for buy opportunities.  Rest I will just ride the storm.
but we don't have the problems today that caused the crash. banks aren't failing, there's no subprime mess, and we aren't rejecting bailouts. why do think we are due? what can you point your finger at, and say "that's the problem that will cause the crash?". we all saw the subprime mess coming (i was @ 10 years in mortgages at the time, and got paid at lot to make these sh!t loans), everyone processing, originating, and closing these loans knew that they couldn't get repaid.
That changes again when you reached "I'm so fucking rich I'm guarded by a private militia and sleep with guns in my bed" level I guess.  
https://twitter.com/officialmcafee/status/955735026515238912
You really don't get it do you lmao
I wonder how this Italy thing will play out and whether there will be some more adoption seen because of it.
It was also a very tiny percentage during the massive bull run last year.  
Obviously your judgment has been tainted by this year‚Äôs downturn.  If you are so disenchanted why don‚Äôt you take a break for a few months and come back later in the year.  Don‚Äôt forget to buy back in at ath! üòù

Someone forgot to unpack the lamp before the casting omg
I'm not sure what "it" is you are referring to, but OK.
It's more likely that people will move into USD in the interim with more mom and pop shops accepting USD.  

Maybe our friends from Italy will like to comment?
