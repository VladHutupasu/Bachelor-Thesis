Daily Discussion, May 29, 2018 -- TITLE
That was a pretty nice bounce. Maybe the start of a correction?
>Wrap it up boys, it's over. It was fun while it lasted. Last one out turn off the lights.

Some idiot left the fuckin' light on :)
Italia arrivederci!
Nice pump.  Hilarious manipulated correct...
LOL Italy could give up with Euro and apply BTC xDD
The daily discussion is far superior to any technical analysis.

Less than 500 comments/day... Buy, buy, buy. 

More than 2000 comments/day, sell.... SELL. 
Green dildo.
Hop on, if you don't want to miss the train! 🚂
“Time to wrap it up folks, bitcoin is dead.”  Lol
Just bought BTC for the first time today.   Did I make the right decision? 
Don't let yourselves get too easily swayed by a bit of bad news guys. If you're folding your hand at every whiff of bad news then crypto investing isn't for you. Fundamentals always win over fud in the end. 
to $8k by tomorrow!
one little spike and you guys all over react. every damn time. 
I get paid in 2 days. Could we please continue the fud till then, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you, goodbye.
Its time to Bull trend. Lets go for 12k then hype goes up and to new ath
The [one minute chart](https://i.imgur.com/qK3zeNz.png) looks bizarre.
Another Bart in progress, I fear.
Italy is falling. Let's GO from here.
Good and volume steadily increasing
Holy shit
BUY BUY BUY!!!!
US market opens and up 2%. hmmm.
Volume has doubled on bitstamp..from 5k to 10k
Did Bitcoin queef a few hours ago?
we could see the best bart simpson so far 
something is going on, volume is decreasing... :(
To the mooooon!!!!

Ugh. I can't wait for Chinese New Year again and for Bitcoin to hit 20k!
Guys ..read the news on Wall Street today. What's going on in Italy and in the banking sector. It's like Poetic irony Bitcoin breaks out when the Fiat Financial system has a crisis

Also noteworthy Deutsche Bank has undercut the 2008 low from a technical analysis perspective
Question; what if the entire supply of bitcoin gets bought by longterm holders and there is no more to buy on exchanges besides the couple coins here and there that people cash out. The only coins that would be available to buy would be massive over the counter trades and also all the coins from the big mining giants. This would drain the supply and the price would skyrocket overnight. Please poke holes in my theory 
Bullrun is coming. 
**CHARGE!!!!!**
Fasten your seatbelts.
I’m ready!
How and where can i safely sell some bitcoin gifted to me?

Some googling reveals that my bank seems to suspend accounts for transactions related to bitcoin, specifically coinbase, including selling, which obviously i don't want.

Hello there. I'd like to buy some FOMO because payday not yet here. 
Second pump in 3.2.1...
She's showing loyalty. Reciprocate accordingly.

I don’t mind some foreplay 
them whales must be awake.
Get ready for the dumpening, the bloody turd is about to dropppp!!  Uuuggaagghaghhhhhhh
How does signing and verifying a message with bitcoin core work?

And how does signing a message only prove receivership to that address? If that address contains BTC, doesn't it prove ownership/control of those BTC?
USA wake up and take profits, stop sleeping.
How many of you feel that this spike is a result of the turmoil going on in Italy.  The Euro is down big.  A rush to safety that goes to digital gold aka Bitcoin.
**Come On Bulls, we are right behind you!**
Everyone, buy, buy, BUY!
To the moon in June. C’mon
this 65% percent fall is SCREAMING BUY!!!! 
I hope you all bought ze dip? I did.
Oh ye grizzled seasoned veterans! 
8k today? 15 by end of june? who's with me? i am annoied of shorting bitcoin
Wrap it up boys, it's over. It was fun while it lasted. Last one out turn off the lights.
What do you folks make of today?  Is the bear market over or is this just a temporary respite? 
does anyone have a calculator for the overall price ive bought in at over the last few months, or can someone tell me the equation? im not great at maths. 
F*** the whales
Damn so much euro fud. I bought back in since 2 months. I still though bitcoin would go lower. But with whats happening in Italy I'm willing to take the risk.
Dont get your hopes up, we're gonma bart simpson then drop down to 6000's.
We want to start a bitcoin fund and most banks in Estonia, UK and Finland rejected our applications?

Can someone please tell me which banks in Europe are crypto friendly?
The Dow is down alot today. I guess stock market money is flowing into crypto.

don't buy....don't buy
BTC is slowly going to zero
With shorts now soaking in it and longs rolling in it,  with this latest uptick; sure does look like swing trading could or should be the method of choice. Especially with the recent diminished volatility.

This in not investment advice and is only IMHO.
people, do not believe in this pump. The whales will dump him again and suck your money. There is no investor who simply puts more than 1K bitcoin. end of the week or Sunday he will be dumped again.
Whales suck you empty ... do not you understand this yet?
don't buy yet.....wait a while
Wow. I'm glad I mined some of this garbage years ago. Now I can buy that Lambo.

Oh wait... I didn't.

Fuck my life. I thought this shit was a joke.

I want to die.

haha this guy is a professional trader and live streams.. actually pretty helpful. talking on crypto now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBbavxw6iiU
it's not over yet, in fact the pump seems to accelerate.... 
This is some whale buying, 1 positive hour with 6k BTC volume. If you look at volume history, the recent volume spikes are all on the bear side. This could be a turnover, either that or a bull trap.
Good morning fellow bitcoiner.
Clown
Those jumps are what happens when the market isn’t being manipulated down with sell walls, and normal EMA crossovers are allowed to happen.  
sad but true
CHOO CHOO MOTHERFUCKERS!
Let’s do it big guy.  Been hodling for a long time now.  
Compared to me buying in close to ATH, it's a fucking great buy in price. 
Yes and no
Too many people are concerned with the here and now of Bitcoin and what others think about it or what some third party has done with it. Nobody knows what it will do nor do they really care if you made the right decision or what you do with it.  They are in or out of it for themselves now, not you. Don't like the analogy? Oh well \- it's the way it is with investing in something that may some day have no value, with Bitcoin these days.  If you like it, buy it hold it forget it for a few years. Congrats and welcome to the other side.

This is not investment advice and only IMHO
You can only tell with hindsight.
>  Did I make the right decision? 

Compared to what?
how can you have fundamentals in an unregulated environment?
Well said 👍🏽
Anyone remember that 1k+ spike in 30 mins - when was it, Apr 7th?

I was watching that in real time - what a day.
One little spike? Over 10bil got pumped into the crypto market. 
It's not a little spike, it's the first large positive spike in a long time.
Yes, volume is increasing rapidly, lets hope for the best...
Are you insane? $12K?
gold to the moon
I hope you sue the publisher of your dictionary.
Not anymore

Or just crazy stairs 
He's gonna have a wide head, bullish sign
Is this bull run?
Slow move upwards during june
Bitcoin is a lady, she never fails to surprise.

She can ignore you for weeks, but then pop on her high heels, strip naked, and cook a dinner in front of you whilst jiggling her pert arse in your reddening face.

(What your face is doing that close to the oven is another question.)

Oh yes, and then she simply ..

Sorry, have to pause there, nurse has come to collect me again.
>	Fiat Financial system has a crisis

>Bitcoin breaks out

What world do you live in?
Hole: There is no demand for that high a price.

What happens if someone buys all the potatoes in the world and then a potato costs 1000 USD? Well no one's gonna eat french fries for a while, that's what...
you dont know what people do with the OTC bought bitcoins. they might dump them on a exchange
Well, the entire $1M infamous McAfee prediction may very well based on some degree of your theory...


I still think the dude knows something we don't.
if it's simply held, it has no value. you are literally hording nothing. if it's not spent, it's not useful. to increase value it needs really world use cases, not just hold. scarcity does not equate value. that has been proven many times over.
For this ROCKET TO THE MOON
LocalBitcoin isn't too bad. I sell on there quite a lot. Buyers can transfer cash straight to your account. 
Don't sell it. Use it or hodl it! 
I've been in a coma since early December.  I can't wait to see how my crypto is doing!
It should be above $10k without all this fud and Bcash confusion. It’s going to take years to clear this mess up. 
Once you go black you never go back!
Don't worry, the dump is on sunday ;)
A rush of safety to Bitcoin??  :)
I would say you lack imagination. :)

It doesn't work like that. This spike is just another pump like many others which have plagued Bitcoin in the past. 

Edit: Btw, the pump is into the crypto market. It also goes into other cryptos, so there's nothing special here about Bitcoin, as usual.
It's not unreasonable.  The Euro is a massive currency and it is potentially seriously undermined by events in Italy and Spain, as well as in the UK with Brexit looming.
It doesn't tell me that. It tells me to watch for support to break 6048; and if it does, watch for the free fall. If it doesn't continue to correct for 2 weeks after breaking that support, then buy. This is not investment advice and is only IMHO.
No one is buying
Yas
more like 6k today
👍🏻
It just needs to hold 7000 for a couple days. Anything else is gravy. And to those of you who want to short it. Seriously there's no money in shorting when the price is already low. You can make one hell of a lot more to the upside if you get a good mania going. 
Redditor for 5 days, knows everything about bitcoin and predicts extinction. 
Touchy subject dude. A lot of people have lost a lot of money. Chill
Okie dokie Captain Bitcoin
From the limited TA I know, it still looks like we're trading within the pennant pattern.  A breakout over ~$8200 should confirm an uptrend.  Ametuer opinion though 
Over. Way gone
Probably temporary. The first real bull sessions are always temporary before it quickly turn down and even harder upwards
Long term bear market, short term rally. Good moment to buy.
Simply take the total of the fiat you spent on BTC, excluding fees, and divide by the total BTC you purchased. This will result in your average buy price.
1. Add up all btc you have bought
2. Add up all fiat you have bought with
3. Divide the fiat sum with btc sum

Little bit easier for you
Learn basic calculus \(like \+, \- , \* and /\) that's all the "math" you need and use/learn Excel for this if necessary. If you don't have Excel, there are open source alternative out there \(open office\). At least if you are loosing money you'll be learning something out of it.

I'm going to help you still but you have to do the rest yourself:

1\) calculate the amount of BTC you have: \(for this you have to use **\+** \)

\- make the **sum** of all your open sell position or look up the amount of BTC in your account.

2\) calculate the amount of Fiat you still have on that exchange if any: \(for this you have to use **\+** \)

\- make the **sum** of all your open buy position or look up the amount of FIAT in your account.

3\) calculate the amount of FIAT you sent to that exchange from the beginning \(for this you have to use **\+** \)

4\) calculate the amount of FIAT you cashed out from that exchange from the beginning \(for this you have to use **\+** \)

5\) make the **difference** between 3 and 4. This should be the total FIAT that is remaining on your exchange in FIAT and in BTC. \(for this you have to use\*\* \*\*\-  \)

6\) make the **difference** between 5 and 2 to know how much of your FIAT is for the moment in the form of BTC. \(for this you have to use\*\* \*\*\- \)

7\) calculate the FIAT value of your total BTC \(point 1\) you have at the present exchange rate. For this you have to **multiply** \(point1\) with the exchange rate to your FIAT. \(for this you have t**o** use \* \)

8\) See what value between 6 and 7 is the highest.

\- If the FIAT value of your BTC \(point 6\) is higher than the FIAT you paid for \(point 7\), you win the difference and you could potentially sell if you want to liquidate your position with a profit.

\- If the FIAT vallue of your BTC \(point 6\) is lower than the FIAT you paid for \(point 7\), you loose the difference.

You can liquidate now if you have the gut feeling it's going down and you'll buy it back lower to end up with more BTC.

Bonus: if you **divide** \(point6\)/\(point1\) that's your breakeven value. This is the value BTC should reach for you to not have lost/win any money. \(for this you have to use / \)

There, you have used \+, \-, \* and /
Amount bought x price paid + amount bought x price paid.....  divided by total btc u own
https://www.online-calculator.org/stock-average-calculator.aspx

Try that, but also have a go at using excel to work it out yourself.

Put in all your orders and work out your running total paid and running total BTC count.

You then just need to calculate total USD paid divided by amount of BTC.
You sold 7.1k didnt you?
Yeap Bart Simpson incoming \^\^, I'm waiting on the sideline for a bigger drop to buy \(less than 5500 euro/BTC\).

Send me a postcard from the moon if I missed the boat because of this :\-\)
When you read about why the irony is poetic. Another financial crisis
7,188 followed by 5,135
[No it doesn't](https://xkcd.com/538/)
It can and will happen again. Duetche bank is on the brink; and if it goes then the first domino of the new (2018/2019) crash will fall
bodes well for the stability argument if it can hold it
Yeah, Simpson Holding and Trust
What drugs are you on? Nowone invests more than $1k in bitcoin? 1k is not that much m8
Where did you see that 1k exactly?
Translation. You sold the bottom and now are in disbelief as the price rises higher
No-one invests more than 1k?  You kidding?  You make me feel like a whale mate :
I don’t know, I’m doing pretty well.
Now I don't normally take financial advice from total strangers, but in this case ..

hang on, my nurse is coming.

Better than mining a couple hundred and losing them in the less-known first Mt. Gox dry run scam. :)
Haha, definitely not a marketing attempt here
I'm really hoping for 8.2 so that arch FUDing shorter from yesterday misses his price and gets rekt   :)  :)  
was it?
Shorts got obliterated
If you also cross correlated the number of "moon" and "bitcoin's dead" comments and then inversed it you'd probably have a pretty good trading model. 
My god.  What do you mean? 
Compared to the alternative
Yeah. I swear this shit is like drugs. I was literally getting high watching that. Euphoria. 

Runs like that make all the down times worth it.
ye but this was a \~300 spike quite a difference.

I mean it is strong and should start a nice local uptrend but ye we will have to see how far up we get.
Same here, I actually walked up to my colleagues to tell them since pretty much everyone here has some sort of crypto
That isn't true. The market cap went up by 10 billion but that doesn't mean that additional 10 billion $ went into the cryptomarket.
You are right, still pumping...
87.5% of coins are mined. 12.5% for the next 120 years. Price should be higher if Lightning and wallets were better at user interfaces. 
Volume hardly moved ha 
My nipples explode with delight!
No sell 
Hmm.  Seems my Bitcoin lady stories pump the price.

Well, what happened next was ..

Sorry, here comes matron .. 
Apparently this one. It happened this morning. 
so you are comparing btc to potatoes? nice... 
Potatoes aren't digital gold
Why would they do that, they just paid tons of money to buy them, the incentive would be to hodl them for a while until the price climbs higher 
hodlers buy them then what
You see all these people saying oh it's not worth that much. If you play around on bitcointalk you will find people every year saying that. No one will pay $100 for a Bitcoin. That's ridiculous. No one will pay 500 and so on. What matters is perceived value. We are coming off of a low right now and the majority of people still have an emotional bearish bias. You also have the second issue of people who have been around for quite awhile and they remember $1,000 at the beginning of last year. The truth of the matter is the price can go anywhere but the real fun will be had if it goes considerably higher. All of the people who have disbelief. All of the people that think it's overvalued. If the price continues to climb the overwhelming majority of them will eventually give in and this creates a massive buying wave 
Yeah like where to buy mountains of cocaine
I'm just saying if 16m people all buy one bitcoin and hodl until the price stabilizes then we can use it as a currency because it won't be so volatile 
We all know Bitcoin need to stabilize to be usable as a currency. If everyone holds until we stabilize at let's say a million per coin, I assume the lightning network will be usable by then, at that point we have a fast, reliable, stable currency that we can all begin to use
I'm not interested in investing in bitcoin. This is the only way the person is willing to pay me, because i actually need the money.

Letting it sit there is all well and good if you don't actually need to spend it.

Or, alternatively, i am using it. To buy USD. Don't judge my purchases.
What bcash confusion
You mean 10k.  But yes, agreed.
Yup. Bitcoin is a safe uncorrelated assest
https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2018/05/italy-could-be-heading-euro-exit-s-more-destabilising-brexit
Brexit will do more harm to the UK than to the Euro zone.

Also, the current events in Italy and Spain is what is called European Politics. 
Do I have to remind that Spain, in the last ellections, went for more than 6 months without an effective Government? 
I’ve bought quite a lot, and will continue to do so.  It’s great, set your limit orders and let the panic sellers come to you.  Use the manipulators to your advantage.
gona bet?
that's why i want to go long
We need twats like him for the next short squeeze

Edit: Look at his history for a good laugh. Rollercoaster of emotions. GOOD TIME TO BUY. SELL NOW? GOOD FOR BITCOIN
Dude, that is some next level patience you have there... Well done!
(for this you have to use *+*)
hahaha you made my day :)

I bet you'd write great books
No, my friend, I am a holder.
Tonight another pump from Asia, to make it look real ... just pay attention
Well, it's not really a financial crisis.  More a political crisis.

But yes the irony - it's ultimately about control of fiscal policies.  

So think - if a government is willing to risk isolation in order to control it's fiscal policies, you still think it will willingly surrender it to a currency which they will have zero control?

Please send a link to this bank

1K bitcoins ..... I also understand that 1k in money is nothing. how many brains are there ,,,,
I do not know which dictionary you translate, but you're wrong, clown.
I only buy :)
I think you just felt for a lame troll post lmao
Your nurse; is she wearing high heels and short skirt? I think I might know her.

I was thinking the same wonder if he will drop in today. I have a feeling he won't :)
8.2 should be easy. how it behaves around 9.5 is the big question. it will be the 3rd run at 10k and the 200SMA is hanging out around the same level.
im pretty sure there are bots programmed exactly trading based of that
It's both the right and left decision.
Agreed.
Volume has more than doubled since yesterday.
Wait a few days and check again. What you were seeing is fairly random daily volatility.
nice argumentation
bitcoin in its current state is more like a deflated potato

if you think it's closer to "digital gold", im done :D
unless you are paid to control the price 
then its moon ofc but we dont know if they are hodlers or "bad intention " people
That's a great point Race!
I often look (way) back at the charts just for this. $7000 for just one Bitcoin seemed like science-fiction back in 2015 and here we are having even seen almost $20,000!
LOL i think he knew that WAY before getting interested in crypto!
I'm not judging you at all. 
Yes! Only declined with 30&#37; last 3 months
*Italy could be heading*

Keywords -> *could be*

I love these sensationalists journals!
Are you telling me that the politics of Europe are what is called European Politics?  

Anything else you feel the need to share? :)
well i shorted at 7520 and SL is 8000 so yeah im betting xD
Wait a bit.
That's hilarious. He should stick to paper&pen \-trading for a while.
I loved his "no need to panic" and "this is good for bitcoin" :) ahhh... kids... :)
Short squeeze isn't even close to happening again. if it does happen, by then, the price will be about 4.5k and it'll take us to 6.5k.
Always glad to help but I prefer to give a rod instead of a fish for the hungry :\-\)
So you'll lose even more?
No, it’s likely to drop back down to the 7.1 level again this evening as the EMAs catch up with each other on the 1h chart.
Asians are killing crypto at min seems to drop 2 or 300 usd each night for past week 
It has the potential to easily turn into one. Italy is the third largest economy in the EU. You have the world very near a recession point I mean it's been like 10 years. You have banks that are in a tightening cycle and then you have Italy. If this plays out like I'm guessing they are going to be able to delay it for awhile but Italy is going to be one of the main catalysts of the global recession as we go into the next easing cycle. The only unpredictable part is how bad the inflation will be and how many billions of dollars worth of bonds they have to give Italy to get them solvent. 

If there is talk about isolation there is no practical way to pull it off. How would they repay their obligation to the European Central Bank? An exit strategy would simply leave them with a lot of high interest bonds to try and finance their government. Greece quickly comes to mind here. 
Sorry...was joking about Simpson

Good luck
Don't they all?
What was his name?  HaHaButtcoin or something.

No doubt he'll be back when there is a small retracement..
I understand. 
Yes because it was Bank Holiday weekend
It was a holiday in the US yesterday.
BTW, where do you guys monitor the volume, is it coinmarketcap ? or is there any good place to monitor..please suggest.
Really wasn't the point of what I said though. This was the first major crack in the Italy situation
thx, you probably don't know anything about  **price elasticity of demand** 
Why
Your arbitrary time frame reveals your bias
Well a lot of your own grandiose and self-assured pronouncements are pretty sensationalist.

And I write that as a European.
Yes. The UK Brexit plan does not exist and the UKIP has made fools out of the UK electorate. 
but not today :P
Don't forget the 'test comment'
[deleted]
Let's hope they know how to use it... :)
> Italy is the third largest economy in the EU.

In the Eurozone actually - the UK makes it the 4th in the EU.
Absolutely - a financial crisis is guaranteed if they do that and yes, there's the risk of contagion.

My point simply is that the desire of a nation to control it's own policies (especially fiscal) is so strong, it's still on the table despite the threat of wiping out it's economy in the process.
Thank you for this information however I am only able to find information about the personal accounts on their website.
Do you know if Fidor bank works with crypto companies as well?
Btc4trade I'm pretty sure he was on molly
Maybe he was just an R/BTC troll. I still can't figure out that particular subreddit practically everyone in there is just absolutely terrible. Very tribal. 
so you trying to say banks control btc?
It was a holiday in England as well yesterday.
GDAX shows you the market pretty well.

https://www.gdax.com/trade/BTC-USD
in a serious and non-hostile way, can you explain to me how is it connected in this case? my major is economics, so you can skip the definition of elasticity... maybe I really overlooked something, so I'm happy to learn
say you are a buisness threatened buy the rise of bitcoin, (or goverment) you want to do anything in your power to crash bitcoin, thats one example
i dont know when but certainly before 8k
One small rise after 3 weeks of constant dumping and people are already calling a reversal. The delusion... Even more worrying when you consider how many of these Bart formations we've seen over the last 4 months. Its likely people are refusing to see it.
I hope so. Surviving in crypto without basic calculus is beyond comprehension.
Solid point sir
Yeah. It is. And it wouldn't be the first time it happened. 
Sorry, I do not know. May have to give them a call.
The main thing is that they are so fucking boring!!!

That completely betrays them.

At least we have a laugh and a joke and a bit of falling out over here - over there it is just one gloom and doom conspiracy after another.

If wit is a measure of intelligence - well..
To a certain extent they do at the minute yes but thats not what am trying to say no. Am saying trading volume isn't as high over bank holiday weekends. 
Capital flow.
Tell me how you do anything useful with Bitcoin without involving a bank.
Thanks...I will explore it...
Do you realize how expensive that would be, plus it wouldn't matter. You buy 100 bitcoin for 100 mil, you then sell for 101 mil, the price wouldn't drop you would just sell to someone who wanted it more than you and was willing to use an exchange 
That is basic artithmatic not calc, no?
Completely agree. Correct me if I'm wrong here but the majority of them say they have been banned from here. If you take all the people who have been removed from functional society and put them in the same place what you have just created is a prison. In this case it's a virtual one but my god does the mentality over there ever seem similar.
cryptowat.ch has more data. Also isn't it Conbase Pro now?
if you sold 300 btc at once it can create a panic selling, so you are wrong
Yeap you're right, my bad.

\(looked up the english definition of calculus and I've also learned something today huhu in french I would have been right though damned "false friend"\)
Absolutely.  I, of course, was banned long ago due to my username.

But I used to subscribe to see what was going on.

But it is such a negative experience having their posts show up in your feed, that I couldn't deal with it.

It is really is pure negativity over there.  Nothing positive to say; very little that isn't colored by delusion - but more importantly - no humor!  No self-belief.
Are you high? If exchanges run out of bitcoin to sell there would be massive buy orders for way above market price because people would still want it so a little sell order wouldn't do anything 
What do you mean false friend? I believe this to be a French idiom. Do not take this the wrong way; I love language.
what? you were banned? but but but they say no censorship? everyone is welcome. what sorcery did you use? 
i thought we are talking about OTC buying ? OTC means not on an exchange
Well in French we say that a word that is the same in English than in French is a "faux ami" (false friend) if the meaning is different in both languages.
We are, but if I'm being paid to drop the price, then I would buy OTC and then attempt to sell on an exchange to create FUD. I'm saying it wouldn't work because there would be hundreds of thousands of buy orders in exchanges just waiting to be filled
Thank you. I attempted to look up a translation and found the the term is now in usage in English although originating in France. This is the second time I have learned something about my own language from a French person. The first was an exchange student who helped me get an A by proof reading my paper for me. Regards. 
chart says otherwise
