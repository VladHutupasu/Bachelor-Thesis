Daily Discussion, April 08, 2018 -- TITLE
This is going to become a huge day, whoever is trying to keep Bitcoin down is losing the battle fast. At some point the shorts are going to be forced to cover. 
We're all waiting for the dumps after the last few days pumps. Haha.

Although it does at least seem that price has stabilized. Maybe soon we will rise again! :) 
Lets break 7500 boys im in even more! This is my last fiat though.. before my wife notices
Watch out for https://twitter.com/Protafield verified Twitter scammer impersonating Bitfinex.
PSA: beware the dangers of margin trading and phenibut.
I don't know ow what the fuck I was thinking...
Gdax volume lmao
[Bitcoin YTD](https://giphy.com/gifs/step-1hc1q42AkRSiQ)
If we could get volume to 20,000 today on GDAX and we move in an upward direction I will be happy.
Groundhog Day!
trading voulume so low today bitfinex 29k and gdax 8.5K only, this is why bulls are not taking any risk
I was wondering how different receive address is generated for same wallet every time!! As far as I know it is generated by hashing public key, how can 1 public key generate multiple addresses?!!! 
Hi I was wondering about buying 1000 USD worth if Bitcoin soon. Is now a good time, or should I wait? 
Are the sellers drying up?
PUMP PUMP THE JAM, PUMP IT UP
First, if reports are to be believed, legendary investor George Soros was found to be investing in cryptocurrency. Now, Venrock, a 3 billion USD venture capital firm owned by storied American family, the Rockefellers, have taken to crypto. 
BUY!!!  

It is the only way to save the babies.
seems buy vs sell war going ...too much sell pressure but at a same time demand of btc for discount buying force also high   
I have rarely seen such low volumes on coinbase in last 4 months. Its onlt 6500 bitcoin in last 24 hours. Its usually 12-13k when market is down and over 20k when its moving fast. Any reason for this low volume?
Pump it up!
[deleted]
I feel like if we offer a sacrifice to the sacred whales, they may become pleased with us and pump the price.

If we can go up $150 a day I will be a very happy man. 
The new owner of @Bitcoin is as mysterious and elusive as Satoshi himself.

That account is a complete shit-storm fuck up right now - what a laugh!

7000 Bitcoin sell wall on Bitfinex 
*yawn*
Bitcoin, I Love You too
is anyone worried that there are so few bitcoin transactions compared to the last part of 2017?
Looking a bit bare on here, so it's got to be said:
hmm reading some calls for double bottom being confirmed, possible end of bear market, we'll see
[deleted]
I think we might be about to see the first short squeeze in Bitcoins history.... I would love to see it happen in this markets on low volume. 
I want to believe, but the whole movement during the last couple of days looks very suspicious :/

[deleted]
So Rockefeller's and Soros's fund Venrock is dabbing its toes in crypto with CoinFund. Big killers finally turning around?
[deleted]
I think we're through, low volume and all, will see 7500 today...

See what the Asians do this morning. They're all going to wake up and see the long term trend line broken. 
**Hi!, my name is Bob,... and I'm a HODLoholic**
TIL "éclair" means "lightning" in French. 
Bastard is at it again, don't fall for his tricks, take out a fraction of his orders and he will cancel...!!

My question is, why would someone who owns 6000 BTC be trying to suppress the price ? 
6,800 then we're off to 8k
[deleted]
Someone is desperately trying to force the market down and it's not working, sell side on Bitfinex just showed 8000 BTC on offer, normal for the range be 1500 to 2000. 

It gained $10 anyway and all the orders disappeared. So expect short covering soon. 
Stay alert and attention please, MrManHimself almost finished his/her morning coffee. 
Seems that on the 1 Hr. chart someone has been gradually pumping this up by making huge buys.  Looks like slow-and-steady approach.  See if the price "sticks" and then hit it again like 12 hours later.  Of course hovering just inside of 7K they are going to have to fight if they want to keep it now.
PLEASE ITS FOR HW, does anyone have the “is this the top?” Meme? Where a stick figure thinks he has reached the top only to figure out there’s a lot more to go? 
Does anyone know if there is any kind of tracker for lightning network transactions?
these dildos ain't big enough!!
seriously fck this guy, can some big whales rekt him
I'm looking for a Bitcoin broker with a good trading interface. 90% of the current brokers are just websites with order forms. I like Bitfinex as a trading platform, but I'm getting a bit worried about them. News seems very negative around them. 

Any suggestions ? 
？

Hey whales how about pumping BTC to an ATH again so we can all pull out of this shitstorm. 
If we hold onto 7k through Sunday, we might have a chance to 7.5k.  If we fall back to 6.5k before the end of day, it will be another week climbing back to 7k. 
This looks like the turnaround point. We can only hope. 
Looks like the Bitcoin twitter is back and unsuspended again but now restricted. Anyone know wtf is going on?
[Bitcoin, I Love You](https://youtu.be/QPkR6FGY6zw)
TIL the existence of the public key, and also that can be used to receive only address.

Also how public key help you to avoid that your coins being stolen.
The EMA 1600 on the 1m chart has been a real support in the last 2 days. Everytime (3x) the price crashed below or near that, it bounced very quickly.

Now it's the 4th crash below it. Let's hope it will bounce just as quickly.

Trading volumes were so low today. This is really bad news. Even if we go down further and smart money enters again around 4-5k$ would it be enough to brake ceiling? We will see. Now is time to turn off crypto alerts pretty sure nothing will happen in upcoming days.
Groundhog week anybody? We’re exactly where we were a week ago. Bitcoin has been very slow... volume has been diminished. People are still optimistic despite the market cap being below the Feb. 05 low. We still have no clue what the bottom is. Everyone thought it was $8K after its crash in February. The whales can still push it down for a lower bottom. There is tremendous resistance around $6.5K. But, what is behind that resistance? Is it the whales...is it the buying and selling trade war? I was expecting Bitcoin to be $5.5K. Perhaps I am right but it’s just being delayed. Eventually, if there isn’t any bullish action, people especially the whales will get tired of investing and move their money to traditional investments like stocks, bonds, physical commodities. I really dread a $6K-$10K movement for the rest of the year. Bitcoin today is like the hot chick who got some terrible plastic surgery.
seems like bullmarket started 
I don't believe in TA but this guy has been uploading Bitcoin analysis like twice a day on youtube and hes actually been pretty accurate 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ5QfSc4SSA
Could be a bluff, but I recently saw 6893 bitcoin on the sell side of Bitfinex. Even if it is mainly shorts, it is possible that bulls might have to retreat a bit to a lower price point. I could be wrong, both sides tend to bluff, I would just be extra careful out there.
See you all at 5000 monday morn.
SAVE THE BABIES!!!
Pretty entertaining analysis of BTC here I wanted to share

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58adTtYb1JI
Whales how much should we given? We want to see some action, not this 6,5 /7k stagnation. Use the funds you've already swindled us.
Am i the only one who sees a classic edge transition ringing pattern in the price?

You know, the one where an electric signal sharply changes from one level to another.
[removed]
SELL!!!
at some point in the future we will need to increase the block size why not now?

[deleted]
I’ve been reading your post. What Country are you from? Its good to get a perspective of what the sentiment is.
What were you saying? Get fucked delusional idiot lmao get DUMPED
Recent pumps started after a dip at 6.5k which also occurred on april 1. Let’s see what happens when it hits that again, then when/if it touches 6.2k since that was the feb low - my spidey senses say bizniz is boomin 
I think the general cue given is that the bulls should walk slowly towards the goal/s instead of sprinting in order to preserve energy and liquidity. :) Possibly selling at strategic peaks to gain extra liquidity and let the price sink a bit before another upwards climb. If the selling pressure is still too strong then the bulls will have to wait for a better opportunity. Both bulls and bears appear to be continuously testing the waters for either direction.
$100 ?
Buy and hodl! If I had just followed this advice, I'd be ahead still in this bear market.
and I thought it was low yesterday lol 
What's the volume like on the other exchanges today?
20k is too optimistic. Maybe by tomorrow
Maybe there are no sellers, which is why volumes are thin...
Now is a lower risk time to buy.  Notice i said lower.   I would buy more if i could.   Just never more than you can afford to write off!  Then you'll never be truly stressed. 
Definitely wait for a few days. After a few positive days a lot of people seem to have forgotten that we’re still in a bear market. Zoom out to the 1 day chart to get some perspective. It is more probable that it will drop more then that it will rise.
For some reason, it seems that every time someone gets paid on Friday, there is an increase after 5pm. It's like all the check to check people drop another 200 in bitcoin, causing the price to go up. It's only a few hundred, but it is technically going up. So, the best time it seems is a Thursday before a Friday payday.
What chimi said, this market is hard as hell to predict. 
You could play it safe at there are some signals that suggest we may drop lower before breakout.

But there also seems to signs that says the price is about to rise.  There seems to be quite a bit of market confusion ATM.

Maybe just buy in smaller increments, that way, if the price rises or lowers you have some profits locked in.
Yes, look at moving averages on 6hr chart; short term crossing over long term in the next few hours, potentially.  Start of a big wave if that happens.

Edit: didn't happen, everybody cleared out
From what I heard he is not buying Bitcoin but he is going to short it and he has already made 1 billion shorting the British pound.
A disinterest observer would say that declining volume is simply a symptom of generally declining interest in whatever asset, which pretty much states the obvious.
I imagine people are waiting to see which direction BTC goes after moving sideways the last 10 days.  The community seems fairly split about whether BTC will move back to >$8K or continue dropping to <$6K over the next few days/weeks.

Personally, I'm hoping the end of tax season sparks further interest for US investors.

Maybe people are hodling.
weed bro
They’ve been pumping it.  Look at the the green dildos on the 1 hour chart since 10pm utc on April 6th. With volume this low I think we are due for another large dump soon.  Not expecting this thing to break 7.5k until after April 16th 
Never had Problems with coinbase. However Use gdax with your coinbase acc
Coinbase is pretty decent if u ask me
I've had no problems with coinbase. 
Depends on how you feel about having you bank account randomly drained.

To be fair, it's the cucks at visa, but still, I could have been fucked.
lol
... aand it's gone.
might be mt gox or fucking big exchange trying  to trade with our money 
An increase in transaction batching would be playing a part in the reduction as well. 
Nope. Last part of 2017 was a mania phase. You should expect a bit of tranquility after a move like that and the consequent crash. Last time this happened to Bitcoin it took over a year to make new highs. We're only 4 months or so into this. It will start moving up and gain momentum as time goes by, buy don't expect fireworks until we start making new highs again. 
[there were spammy ICOs active back then, according to the lead dev for Namecoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Namecoin/comments/87xib5/for_devs_where_do_you_see_namecoin_going_in_the/dws57zp/)
weak hands and dumb money is almost gone. music to my ears.
o.k.  I'll have to do it myself:

Lambo to the Mooooon!!!!

That's better. 
Aren't all bottoms double?  You'd look a bit silly with one arse cheek.
That would make me so happy
I do hope shorts stay short until the next cycle. 
Looks normal to me, no one knows what the fuck to do.
We hit bottom 2 months ago. Onward and upward!
I suggest we try and get past $7100 first. 
Soros' fund will be "trading" which doesn't necessarily mean staying long or short, but sounds more like taking advantage of short term opportunities, i.e., over- and under-valued situations.
I question the extent. Soros shitted on Bitcoin all of last year. Now hypocritically, he has a change of heart and wants to trade. WTF... billionaires are always twisted fucks. I wouldn’t bet favorably based on this news. It could be a positive turn for Bitcoin or it could just be bait. Only time will tell...
Institutional investing should dwarf consumer investing by many times over. 
That’s about as true as a bull run starting this month.
Hi Bob! 
I'll be your support buddy.
shut up fudster
Maybe he also has enough fiat to buy 12K more. 
Here's what he is doing  to the order book. And it still isn't working. Bugger is persistent though. 

https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DaT4_UIU0AIBCZV.jpg
On bitfinex? I see a 2000 btc sell wall.
why dont wait until 10k?, not, better wait a gain an increase of 100usd then sell.
looks like hes done for the day
Eh, more like sub 5k before we see 8k again. Moving averages are still pointing down.
Or better yet, buy more.  If we all do that regularly the price is likely to go up 👍
[deleted]
Sorry guys, but I'm selling.  A 6.5% profit over 2 weeks is good enough for me.

We are going nowhere with this small pump/horizontal/drop routine.  I will buy in later if it goes down to 6.5/6.6.

Edit:  Sold - 7,120.
There it happens again,  someone is throwing in 5000, 6000 BTC's at a time to drive it down, seen it come and go into the order book a few times now and it's just not working.
That’s what she said 
Big whales rectum? 
What guy?
All the exchanges are fucking sketchy, you could try one of the decentralized ones. 

Thats what I'm hoping everyone will use in the future, but AtM I still feel like they need to prove themselves.
I use Kraken and Bisq. Both have good trading interfaces, volume is better on Kraken, and Bisq is decentralized.
Why did you invest in the first place if you don't believe in bitcoin. Are you saying you knowingly invested in something you think is just a Ponzi scheme?
They used all their pump money keeping this thing from tanking completely.  All they have now is couch seat cushion money so maybe someday we'll see 7.5K again.
6.9 and falling :-(
Based on what?
No, it's struggling to hold 7k sellers are up and barely anyone's buying. Looks like more sideways trading to me.
that twitter account belongs to bcash
Whats a Public Key. /s
Looking good. :-)

I got the feeling that the bears are losing steam...
Not so sure.  Look at stock - the smart money comes in at last two hours of trading day and drive prices down.  
Double bottom though, higher low and through a pretty major trend line, which we weren't last week. 
What drugs are you on? 
[deleted]
[deleted]
Pretty sure it was just a market maker. Someone bought 300 coins which caused an arbitrage opportunity. As soon as the prices from the other exchanges got to that price he cancelled the order. 
If the short term moving average crosses the long term on the 6hr chart, this could go past 8000. This one is different from the others.  
i love to ban naive people-
Clearly not from the Future. It is Monday afternoon in the future.

phooh.... that was like a PHD in charts... good stuff but not for a lazy Sunday afternoon, too much to take in. It will be what it will be :))
Steady floor around 6500 but the ceilings keep decreasing with every cycle, thus leading to sideways movement on decreasing volume -- classic technical analysis signs of "general loss of interest". What that means is a lot less than it sounds, however, because "interest" can turn in a second; however, a continued long-period loss of interest will inevitably lead to an eroding floor price as traders look for something with higher volatility, i.e., "something where something is happening".

I just got a brilliant idea, just put a lower number on the CLOSE and the REWARD% goes up!

I'm going to aim for atleast 70%

Thanks man
Did you enjoy your 5.8% loss ?
No we won't.
There is absolutely no need. I used to think there was, but it's like saying at some point we need to increase the size of CPUs to get more out of them.
Done by bcash, but not real long term solution...
So you've been spamming this for 4 weeks now, I'm kinda cursious if it's working for you?
Was that worth posting?
I live in SE Asia now days, kind of got stuck here one day, originally from South Africa. 
No need to be rude. Could easily have gone the other way. 
At the peak of the trade, it cost me roughly 1.5k to mine enough alts to trade for one Bitcoin. Today it's a little over 3k. All costs go to the power company.

As far as buy and hodl goes, I good down to Bitcoins lowest likely prices. It's slow and painful but that's where I'm at.

But if I can make successful trades, then I start actually makes some real money. And the more I have, the more I can make. How am I supposed to avoid that temptation?
Fucking laughable
[deleted]
No Friday mornings are the best time to buy. Thursday evenings and early Friday mornings can be bare. As far as not losing money, buying Friday morning and selling Friday night seems to be the safest bet.
Alright thank you for the tip!
Can you explain like I am 8 years old?
No he's definitely buying. Big investment incoming.
CME & CBOE order books and daily volume are miniscule compared to Bitfinex, GDAX, Bitmex.

If he wants to trade a large quanty of long/short contracts, he will have to do so on either Bitmex or Bitfinex.

Wonder what his screenname in Bitmex trollbox will be? ;)
In 1992!!!
We're not split. They're just wrong.
Really good point
Curious, why do you claim trade war fears are 'playing into it now'? Is this your own assessment or based upon something you've read? 

I can understand why trade wars influence the price of certain commodities and goods, but BTC doesn't function in the same way, and, if anything, it has often played the role of a deflationary investment vehicle. You really believe that the average BTC buyer is concerned about a trade war so they are keeping their money in the bank instead?

Not trying to sound harsh...I just don't think the normie invasion of late 2017 was comprised of people conversant in international economics and the regulatory environment surrounding financial markets and institutions.
Cant buy or sell to coinbase from my Bitpay App...so bc of a comm issue between the two my Bitcoin is trapped in my wallet...add to that the fees that Coinbase charge and the weeks it takes to get any kind of tech support from them, I'd say they are pretty crappy. Stick to Revolut or Kraken imho
Why is that funny? 
And it's there again. I only watch tradingview.com. It seems to be lagging regarding the display of the orderbooks.
I know: HODL (and buy the dips).
It was 8k two months ago. 
Let's just skip that and move directly to $8300.
;-)
Dunno. Don't know what his agenda is, but it's not working today. 
Jesus H. Christ.  Is there no consequence for this or can he dick around all day?
Yah on Bitfinex, this guy has been at it all morning, throws thousands into the market, then he cancels when it doesn't work. You can see it's one trader as all the large orders cancel at once. That was by far not his biggest attempt. Normal is 2000. But that image I loaded is 9000 total offers. 
He must have shorts he's trying to get out off or is trying to pick up more longs lower. 
Well, I hope not ! He needs to start buying and then keep pushing the price up the same way. I think it's behaviours like that  which caused Bitcoin to go to $20k in the first place. In effect we've all been beneficiaries of it when things were going well. 
Went from $7060 to $7070 or so. But whoever it was got his posterior handed to him for now, looks like he gave up and hopefully he'll be forced to cover now. That's all we need to get this show on the road. 
Bastards, look at that, 8000 BTC on offer and now it's starting to drive prices down. And gone. Out of the market. 

Open clear evidence of price manipulation. Buy the crap out of BTC people, lets ruin that @#$%&'s day...
That's when I came in.
They just don't have the volumes...
ewwwww kraken
Del
Literally nothing. 
Better than downwards
Glad to see you two in agreement.
Apparently the best ones!
Comment of the year :)
I am not selling just curiousto know  why do you think $8.3k support level make bull run ..
Interesting, "redditor for 3 months".
Giving someone a hard time being new to something is a bit ironic considering the technology you’re following    Just sayin 🤷‍♂️
That's possible, good point.
What is a arbitrage opportunity? 
You called it. What did it say
Catch a falling knife and put it in your pocket

Never let it fade away

Catch a falling knife and put it in your pocket

Save it for a rainy day
Awesome man. Well it’s certainly feels like there are some buyers coming back around. Ill be much happier post 7.5k. Thx!
> But if I can make successful trades, then I start actually makes some real money.

And if you make unsuccessful trades you will lose some real money.
I don't agree, look Bitcoin has to reach a maximum value at some point and the HODL crowd will release their reserves, this is the point at which Bitcoin becomes money.

We have 1 maybe 2 of these parabolic moves left. 

But part of it is the HODL crowd moving into something else, most likely other crypto's. 

How far is it away ? Years. Two maybe three. Till then just work it as it is.  
ELI5 time. If I buy at $6k, say $500. Then during a big spike, I buy like $20 at a higher price, does the higher price move the needle, or is it the sheer quantity? How does that work? is it volume or price that moves the averaged price?
bitcoin go up
Check YouTube for moving average trading strategies.  Better explanations than I can give.
As an average BTC investor, I say Yes.  The simple fact is that nobody knows how a trade war will impact BTC (anyone claiming otherwise is BS).

I have already sold more than half of my stocks and it's mostly in cash deposits.  I'm now selling my BTC.  Reason is simple - build up cash reserves to take advantage of further dips in stocks.


Cuz your a moonboy cliché
Spoofy up to his old tricks again, eh?  Sounds like the beginnings of a true recovery! ;)
Or mine and trade the peaks. :)
Feb 5th we hit 5.8k.
Yes, he is gonna fail. 
It's illegal. He can go to jail for years if you can prove it. But no one is regulating the Crypto's yet so he can basically do whatever he wants. And I guess someone would have to lodge a complaint. But it's easy to beat him. He really doesn't want to sell those Bitcoins, so just take a small nibble at his position and he cancels. As long as no one runs away form the volumes he puts on offer, which hasn't happened this whole morning. We're through a major level and Europe is about to wake up and see it...
> guy 

--- its bitfinex wash trading
If you want to get out of a short you buy more, not sell. 

Sometimes the reason people sell things can be as simple as ‘because they don’t want as much of it anymore’.
Are you guys serious?  No one knows, it's my personal opinion...Want me to make a youtube video and draw some lines through the chart to make it believable?  
Oh, same reason it went up.
seems like that were it always goes after trading sideways tho.
[deleted]
Arbitrage is basically buying a security in one market and simultaneously selling it in another market at a higher price, profiting from the temporary difference in prices. This is considered riskless profit for the investor/trader.

From Investopedia

So in this case due to someone buying 300 coins in 1 go on Bitfinex the price on Bitfinex was temporally higher compared to the price on the other exchanges. So big parties which can trade without transaction costs (so called market makers) can make a (almost) riskless profit by selling on Bitfinex and simultaneously buying on one of the other exchanges.
He had opened up a short position at $7100. 
We will get there soon. Someone was desperately trying to keep a lid on the price and failed miserably. Throwing in up to 6000 BTC sell side and kept on being forced to step it back. All the way from 7060 to where we are now and I see the activity has stopped. So hopefully this will force people like that to swing around long side. 
Yes but as you can tell by my grammar, that is an impossiblity.
The Hodlers  of last resort will never sell though 
I wouldn't bet on it, yet. 

Most TAs predict another huge drop. But of course they could be wrong. TA was wrong so often lately.
Huh. My graph says 6.8k. Maybe I am looking at the wrong chart. BRB
What I thought.  Thanks.  But couldn't the exchanges ban this douche?
It's not illegal in crypto because it's unregulated. They would get screwed hard in the traditional markets.
Hard to wash trade cancelled orders....
Not quite how it works. If you're short and you can drive price down with sell orders, but with no intention to actually sell, you can get out with more profit or at least less of a loss, iow's you can buy lower to exit With margin trading you can in fact hold both positions. 

And you certainly don't dump your entire fortune on the market at once if you're trying to get the best exit price. You do it slowly and softly to get the best possible price. 
Can you use lots of technical terms if you do?
Judging someone by how old their reddit account is just shows the intellect of most of the folks on this sub. 
Idk how that can be riskless, it's hard as fuck to get the coins into another exchange fast enough to take advantage of the difference. And if you don't, you're stuck holding the coins. Granted if you're sure the market will move in your favor it's irrelevant. But then why go through the trouble of arbitration
ouch. thanks
I disagree. It's on this parabolic move or the next. 
When are they not wrong?
It may have closed on the day at 6.8k, but the lowest point on Gdax was around 5,800. 
And give up the income from a 6000 BTC account ? Don't think that's going to happen in a hurry. Look when Europe kicks in if he is short he will get a proper hiding. Hopefully he'll turn his positions and start the same crap long which will work for the rest of us. 
Funny enough the HFT guys don't. They do this all the time, up to 1000 orders per second with no intention of taking the position. They even front run without any consequences. 
yes good point
Yeah, good point. I didn’t really think it through.
he was suggesting that he may have made a new account to advertise himself on youtube, not that he was new.
It doesn't matter how long it takes for the coins to get to the other exchange. They just have coins on both exchanges and sell on the one with the higher price and buy on the one with the lower price. Then they send the bought coins to the other exchange.

And for the risk of holding the coins they can just short by the same amount on 1 of the exchanges. (or when an arbitrage opportunity arrives go short on the exchange with the higher price and long on the exchange with the lower price). 
Check the wallets that havent moved since 2012
