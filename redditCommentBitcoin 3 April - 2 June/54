Daily Discussion, April 10, 2018 -- TITLE
Someone should make a crypto price tracker that mimics the weather apps.

Bitcoin forecast tomorrow: 

$7500

Light chance of bears

Feels like $8200
Anyone else sick of seeing bitcoin between 6500-7000?
Market tries to go up and someone is like forcing it back down.. wonder who wants to really sell at these prices.. at this point now feels like pure manipulation to accumulate on large scale and later moon will definitely come, just need patience... whales and institutions think long term
This market is best example of "Calm Before The Storm" I have ever seen...
The price is not down, it's exactly where it should be! Before the price started it's insane exponential unnatural rise, we were sitting at about $3k (already up from $1k from just a few months before). 

It started to double fairly quickly at a faster rate than usual, and reached $6k. This was due to very positive outlook and the great potential in the long run. Then it hit $8k. At that point, justifying that price was becoming a bit of a stretch, but you could make the argument that Bitcoin had a really bright future and huge potential. 

When it went above that, that became just insanity, and it was hard to find logic and reason for the rise anymore and for that high a price. There was no change in the technology, or usage. 

So really $6-8K is a very reasonable price, it's where we were before we lost reason and logic, and this is where we are back now, because that's really where Bitcoin should be
Looks like twitter enabled the bought handle that I wont name here. Whoever owns it starts talking shit about Bitcoin right away. God I fucking hate Btrash and any jerk off that owns it.
These artificial sell walls popping in and out of existence multiple times a second are getting more than a little annoying.
I believe we will go to 6900
Is there a place in Manhattan where you can buy bitcoin anonymously and get a paper wallet? 
I like Bitcoin.
What is going to happen today? 
Someone wants the price to stick at 6740. Wonder why? Is it gilfoyle? Keepung his mining profitable?
Hi again, I need some help. Please pardon me its not BTC related though. I am trying to send an ERC-20 token from a Chinese exchange to my ledger nano S. But the exchange is showing that this is not a valid address. Could someone please help. Thanks
lol that pump out of no where
If this imitates Friday's play it will go up to **$7,100**!
How do i choose which altcoins to expand my portfolio with? I just keep going in circles on google trying to determine which to go with, is limited supply a good measure to judge with?
The order book buy side is really building on Bitfinex, I'm not sure if it's an attempt at manipulation or genuine, but normal is 2500 bids, were seeing 4000 up to 6000 at times...
right back where we started 
Bitcoin will go up eventually. Just you wait. Words from a holder who bought at $1000-$3500 and didn`t sell at $19k.
Attention: We hit the bottom on Feb 5th, onward and upward! 
Taut
For someone who bought and sold a small amount of bitcoin before the big spike, when would be a good time to get back in?  Is buying coin directly still more beneficial than mining?
Id love for somebody to tear this apart: https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610783/bitcoin-would-be-a-calamity-not-an-economy/
What's everyone's opinion on hardware wallets nowadays?  I own both, and each are excellent in their own way. 
 From what I can tell, both Ledger Nano S and the Trezor wallet were about even, given that the differences between the two were; 

* Nano S used security hardened chips
* Trezor is open source  

Ledger seemed to be the king given the lower price, however now you can pickup a Trezor for cheaper.  Personally I prefer the Open Source nature of the Trezor, given that both support passphrase encrypted seeds, it doesn't matter that someone could theoretically retrieve the seed from the device.  On the Trezor I can verify this is true through reviewing the code, however I can't verify that the Ledger isn't storing the passphrase to an encrypted seed.
This was one of my first actual large purchase with 100% bitcoin in jan 2018.
It felt good using bitcoin for what it was intended for. 2018 ram power wagon new at a dealership they used bitpay service ..The easiest purchase of a vehicle ever.
https://imgur.com/a/kGDjZ
I will say it was bought with all profit from bitcoin as well.! 
Man, pump me up!  Love this .85 cent increase in the last hour.  To the moon Alice! /s
At least we‚Äôre not dropping. üëç
There! It just moved $5!
We are all equal with fucken brokers and whales in this block chain platform. The only difference is, whales are loaded and brokers are literally broke.... haha
Is this very low volume a major concern? 
$6900!  $7500 here we come!
What just happened to the BTC hashrate???
Market is quiet because of rumours about huge investors entering.  Large investors are waiting for someone to pull the trigger.  This will be an investor led boom, not a mom and pop one.
I've got a feeling we will get back to around $6900-$7000 later today when the Americans get going.
How do you verbally pronounce HODL or Hodler? Is it a short o or a long o sound?
Despite how evil I believe Soros to be, he has traditionally guessed (and gotten right almost every time) the big swings in money over the past couple decades. It makes me uneasy with his investment firm now testing the bitcoin waters. Additionally with a few more whale like figures such as the rockefellers I'm starting to think bitcoin could see a strong bull run in the next months to a year (after a corrective phase - to which extent I have no idea. My guess would be ~5k). I want to hear your ideas/opinions on this please.
Hello Bitcoin community!

I have some unfortunate news for myself but some good news for you. I am selling my Andres Antonopoulos The Internet of Money: Five Years Later in Chicago on April 25th. You can direct message me about the tickets and we can work out a way to make a safe and secure transaction. 
when will Bitcoin Get Boost?
I'm waiting on my wallet to come in still then transfering what I have in my coinbase.  One question I have is what happens when we've mined all 21,000,000?  Do we all panic?
Price seems stuck in the $6500-$7100 range for the past week.  

Low volume because not a lot of sellers left and buyers don‚Äôt like buying on an overall down trend.  
Might be stuck at these levels for a week or less until an up trend is sparked.  
**Is 10 Bitcoin enough?**
Moon now?
6900 or 6200?
Anyone else feel like it's ground hog day?

It's not dead, I saw it move.  Good for Bitcoin.
Was hoping to buy in late this weekend when it dipped below 6.5 again but it never happened. Hopes not dead yet! 
Shower thoughts, if new bitcoins mined each year was the **only** thing regulated by government would it help or hinder
To buy or not to buy at 6750... that is the question. 
Not sure I've ever seen 8 flat 5 minute candles on gdax before
Best of luck!
The low dips are slowly going up as i predicted Where my crystal ball at?
It moved.  Who's been poking it with a stick?
**Bear Market 'Largely Over,' Crypto Fund Manager Claims**

https://www.coindesk.com/bear-market-largely-over-crypto-hedge-fund-manager-claims/

Timothy Enneking, managing director of Crypto Asset Managment, LP, said Monday that the winter in cryptocurrency markets is "largely over."

Crypto Asset Management, which was founded last year and has roughly $20 million in assets under management, saw its CAMCrypto30 cryptocurrency index fall by 69 percent since its high in January. Enneking sees four reasons for the collapse.

Asset consolidation, regulatory concerns, massive liquidation by the Mt. Gox trustee and startups' selling crypto assets to pay salaries and expenses are all factors in the market's overall decline, he wrote.

"Consolidation after the amazing 2017 increase" drew back some of the funds invested in cryptocurrencies, he said.

Invsestors are also likely wary due to recent regulatory actions. While he did not cite any specific events, the report comes just weeks after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission subpoenaed startups with initial coin offerings.

It remains unclear what exactly the SEC is looking for, though an official confirmed "dozens" of investigations were underway.

The other two reasons likely had less of an impact, Enneking said.

These factors have mostly been priced into the cryptocurrency market already, which, despite the recent rout, is still up by over 600 percent in the last 15 months, he wrote.

Enneking also noted that bitcoin's share of the overall cryptocurrency market has fallen from 45.7 percent on Dec. 20 to 44.3 percent. This decline in "BTC dominance" has coincided with a decline in correlation between bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, he wrote.

While the note does not comment on what declining correlation means, it could indicate that the quality of individual cryptocurrencies is beginning to have a greater influence on their market prices.

The combination of these factors indicate that the market should begin rebounding soon, he indicated in his report.
6 hour chart shows a clear head and shoulders, double bottom and low volume. Rockefeller and Buffet moving in behind the scenes... Could this be the end of the bear market?

How can I sell shares I don't own, only to buy them back at a lower price? 
[deleted]
Moon now?
HODL!!!
According to some analysts (don't ask me who), 6550 is the bottom folks. It is not going below that number. Solid platform is forming around this number.

Take it or leave it. You have been told :)

All predictions are out-of-backside so make your own decisions :)
Guys it pains me (after seeing it go to almost 20k) to admit that i've always (since '09 boys) thought of bitcoin as being a shitcoin. At this point i realise how it works. And am still struggling to see it's place or usecase. Not only does everything we have right now seem to be better, but also any technological breakthrough "our" engineers might ever come up with, seems to me to way better serve the current system rather than bitcoin. I genuinely feel the talent we have rn  developing "decentralized" projects is being wasted (not to mention manipulated by conmen). Socially ppl need not only a central point of control, but also a central point of trust.  Can you, r/bitcoin, honestly say you'd rather trust no one for better or for worse and take matter into your own hands win or lose?
We moon now?

I invested in alts a few days ago and maybe I picked good ones, but they're increasing in value by small amounts. I think bitcoin might do the same.
I felt a disturbance in the force. But now it's gone.
completely baseless speculation, but I feel like once we get out of this 4 month long triangle/flag pattern, whichever move it initially make will be a fakeout but on a higher timeframe (few days). It'll break upward/downward and stagnate to load up on longs/shorts and then make a sharp opposite move to liquidate all the positions. Just a guess for the traders out there.
Ew...
Almost 9 in Moscow. I feel a Russian push.

Hello everyone,

found a Chart on the BTC here. Are the bearish times coming???
Here the link: https://de.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSDT/ukONW59p/
Bitcoin is so boring now, the price is literally like something you'd buy at a store.. *Come get your Bitcorn, only 6869:- for a limited time.*  
Since early March, there has been decreasing fluctuation between peaks and valleys.  Also, the amount of time between peaks and valleys has been decreasing.  This, combined with the obvious downward trend suggests an underlying psychological phenomenon on the part of the day traders:  They're increasingly competing with each other, and not market as a whole.  Each pump might be correlated with an external event, such as regulation changes, etc.  Once the pump gets going, the day traders dump increasingly more easily, willing to avoid coming too close to the next peak.  This is what's causing the increasingly rapid cycling between the peaks and valleys.  At this point, the only thing that will cause a meaningful bull run is a massive and sustained investment by whales.  The thing about whales is, they tend to be conservative investors.  So, this massive bull run won't start until the price gets to about 2K.  Sure, there could be a "teaser" bull run at 4k, pumping us to over 10k, but this won't last.  Not until big money gets infused at 2K will the current 2018 cycle be broken.
Massive sudden volume change.  USA?

Hello everyone,
found a nice analysis about the BTC here... next stop 6000$???
Here the link: https://de.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/H1Rw2Z94/
Short opportunity. Sell now, buy back at 6680.
Totally brilliant. Made me laugh 
I think that‚Äôs just funny AF and I dunno why 
You're being sarcastic right?
if the price stabilizes, it could be a currency. Does anyone want that anymore? lol
Sick of this shiieetttt !!! Butta kill everybody up in here!
Would you prefer 4500-5000?
I hope it stays here to be honest. Let the alts do the run 
Agreed I believe if u really wanted alot of bitcoin u would try to manipulate accumulate pump 
[deleted]
Good storm or bad storm üòÅ
in theory this makes sense but its not practical. Bitcoin is priced on its worth like anything, it was worth more a few months ago because more people invested in it and more money flowed in. There is no "reasonable price" because you can't measure reasonable. Yes if you take out the boom late last year we are still growing, and I understand what you're saying, but bitcoin "shouldn't" be anywhere because its not something we can measure. 
Personally, I like to use this as indicator for a good price. Insane? Maybe...

See ya all April 06 2020 at $272,783.84 :)
What does the chart look like if you start at December 17 instead? That is the date when market momentum shifted.
I agree with the argument, but my arbitrary reasonable price is $225. 
If this continue like this -> https://imgur.com/y5oplRp then we can all see that :D

Just ignore it. It's not worth the emotional cost...
I own bcash. Do you really hate me? :( I don't hate you. 
Why do you dislike it so?
So many conspiracy theories on this forum!

Dude, these are just bots adjusting to the market.  

E.g., a bot that originally put up buy order at 6800 may take it down (may be partially filled) and re-price it at 6750 if it sees a large build-up of sell orders.
#Hawking radiation?
I'm sure you could make your own paper wallet or download a wallet on your phone then transfer it to a paper wallet after buying it. Then all you gotta do is find someone on localbitcoins.com or find an ATM on coinatmradar.com. 

If your worried about anonymity after buying you can find a mixing service that could mix the coins so its harder to trace back to you.
I like turtles.
https://tenor.com/view/ilike-turtles-emo-kid-gif-10548543
it will move to the right
No one knows???
FUD. MOON. Up. Down. Sideways.
I am guessing here but nothing! 
drop to a level where there's solid volume and recover from there.
Whatever happens it will be good for Bitcoin.
I'm going to come over and watch office space with you.
*If* the market follows what happened on Friday it will remain relatively static around that for a good few hours before shooting up to $7100 with a chance to make a little profit.
Did you try sending it to a new wallet and then sending it from there to the nano s? Sometimes that's what I have to do when pulling coins out of poopy exchange wallets.
everyday the same :D punp¬¥n¬¥dump¬¥n xD
Actually it needs to go a little higher to stay in line with the uptrend...

https://imgur.com/a/rctza
Be careful with ALTs. They are high risk high reward. The safest investment is BTC since it is still the mother of all coins. But the returns on ALTs will be really high if you pick the right one. Or lose it all lol
It's easy to fall in and out of love with the altcoins, in my experience.  Are you looking for altcoins to go long with??
I sort them by dollar value/volume traded, you quickly see where the money is. If it's actively being traded people are interested in them and you need the interest for prices to move. 
Look at which ones have a good moving average. Then do all the research you can on the ones that appear favorable and choose which one you think fills a purpose that would make people want to use it.
Dude, all cryptos are the same - it's a number on a network and people are assigning values purely based on speculation.

When this bubble burst, you will come to a realisation of how silly it is to pay thousands of $ of your hard earned cash for a number.
[removed]
So have you developed a strategy yet ? We're in for several years of exactly that. 
It recently kind of followed a pattern, really. Huge spike + dip followed by a period of stasis where price remains relatively stable. The difference is that the last rally was really huge and awareness is much greater.
Why does where you bought make your guess any more valid than someone else's? 
Another day, more crystal balls
lol just i wait sir
mining Bitcoin is not profitable anymore for individual miners. If you consider mining, you would better take a look at altcoins which are in their early stage
At 6000. Maybe even 5000.
No, mining is still more profitable. But only if you already have the hardware. It also depends on your utility cost.
It cost me a little over 3k to mine enough alts to trade for one Bitcoin. 
But how long will it stay that way? That's why I say if you already have the hardware. It's a total crapshoot if you don't.
Now.
At the low.

Well, the article makes some assumptions without making it clear that they are assumptions, or justifying those assumptions.

For instance, it talks about governments using the banks to deal with things like the financial crash on 2008. But that financial crash was caused by the banks in the first place, precisely because banks can in effect create money, which is what they did in the sub-prime lending crisis. So, perhaps, if the banks went away, then so would that problem.

Second, it assumes that people will hold Bitcoin (or whatever) because they think it will increase in value. But that assumes that Bitcoin does increase in value, which, in the long term, it can't (sure, it could rise much higher, but there is a limit).

Third, it suggests that there are just too many different coins to be usable. But that is an assumption that because there are currently lots of coins, there will always be lots of coins; it is just as possible that as the ecosystem matures, the number of coins will reduce.

So, I have no idea whether Bitcoin (or whatever) will or will not replace fiat, but the article is just noise without any recognition, leet alone justification, of the assumptions on which it is based.
I really like my Ledger Nano S.
I have the Nano S. Love it.
I have the Ledger.  Curious if you've done the Firmware update on it and if it went smoothly?
Never understood the need to waste money on a hardware wallet

ledger is centralized, this is really worrying.
I have a Trezor, very happy with it.
i think the low volume is cause of tons of money waiting on the sidelines for one more big drop.  It could come creeping back in if the drop doesn't happen or if some good news comes out
Better than high volume dropping!  I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll see too much movement (aside from some pumpy dumpy) until after usa taxes are paid on April 17.  Then things should get interesting.  
I'll be honest.  Low volumes are a concern.

Of course they are across the market - but def. a concern.
Yep, indicates a general lack of interest in the whatever, which is not conducive to a near-term price rise.
Warn us before u jinx it next time 
Nope - more like $6600. :(
Lmao right.  More like 7,100 then right back down to 6,600 in the span of a few minutes.
Congratz what a good timing.
That can't be right
wow, lost 66% , geez
I doubt it. If huge investors are entering, they are already doing it. Slowly, quietly, without driving the prices up. At least, for as long as it's possible.

They are not as stupid as mom and pop.
i use a long O sound, like the one in ‚Äúhold.‚Äù i.e. it rhymes with ‚Äúyodel.‚Äù

but most people i‚Äôve heard say ‚Äúhoddle‚Äù instead.

6.4 is bottom imo. But who really knows.
Bull run from Soros?  Please check his history.

This is the shark that preys on crisis and will eat the whales for lunch. 
 
He will probably short BTC, manipulate a crisis, eat up the remains and leave us in a mess.  Bull run my ass.
More likely to go lower, if it keeps moving sideways 
It is remarkably flat for last 24 hours.
New money.
I'd imagine so, we'd all be at least 160 years old.
I'd happily buy more here, if only I had money!
there are big players selling what they don't have, to drive the price down, so they can buy back at a lower price.
10 x 6,700 / 51,939 =1.3 years of average US income. I know, it always looks like a lot of money until it is all the money you have.


nope, not enough 
Only if you live in a shithole country.
Enough for what?
When short term moving average on 1hr chart crosses the long term, we'll shoot back up over 7k.  May happen today or tomorrow.  Watch the charts.
I poked it with the stick. It has some life in it. 
Hope (long or short) is emotional; in any kind of trading, emotion is your worst enemy.
Many people are waiting for the price to drop further. And exactly that might prevent it from doing so. That's my hope.
It's probably going to pump between 1 and 3pm EST today. Not joking.
so. a central bank again. no thank you 
That totally wouldn't break Bitcoins entire purpose.
It wouldn‚Äôt do anything in the long run and not a lot in the short term. 80% of bitcoins which ever will be mined already have been. The regulator wouldn‚Äôt have much wiggle room to affect the supply of bitcoin. At this point it‚Äôs demand which is controlling the volatility of bitcoin, not supply. 
dont buy as soon as you buy you will make the price drop. Lol
Then try the GBP tab, there's 12 in a row on there. 223 BTC volume in 24 hours, woooh!
It's all good. People are pooping. Bitcoin will be back shortly.
That trollish fellow smashed it in a fit of rage. I'm sorry you had to find out this way.

ROFL!  Even my boring old stocks moved more yesterday :)
Not sure if the bear market is over, but I do think we found the bottom already.
I‚Äôm smoking again 
Margin account, short. Most brokers offer that. I think. 
By selling them in the future. The mechanics behind it is this: Bitcoin‚Äôs current value is $7k. You promise to sell me 1 bitcoin in a week‚Äôs time for $7k. Thing is, you don‚Äôt actually own any bitcoin at the moment. 

One week later you buy a bitcoin, and you sell it to me for $7k as promised. Let‚Äôs look at two scenarios one week after we formed our agreement.

1) the bitcoin price is $6k. You buy one and instantly sell it to me for $7k. You‚Äôve just made $1k.

2) the bitcoin price is $8k. You buy one and instantly sell it to me for $7k. You‚Äôve just lost $1k.

The effect is the same as if you had held negative 1 bitcoin from day 0 and sold it on day 7.

The risky thing with selling futures is that there‚Äôs no limit to how much you can lose. You know how people say ‚Äúonly invest what you can afford to lose‚Äù, you can‚Äôt do that if you short. If in a week‚Äôs time bitcoin‚Äôs price is $20k, you lose $13k. If the price is $100k you lose $93k. If you don‚Äôt have the money you declare yourself bankrupt. 

As a completely independent person with nothing at stake, I would advise against shorting such a volatile asset.

I think you were thinking of the word ‚Äúconvoy‚Äù.

I understand your skepticism Aulne, and maybe everything will implode. I suppose we could spend all day arguing for or against. 

But ask yourself this Aulne, where would humanity be right now if we never tried anything new? Where would we be if never tried to innovate, never pushed forward towards a dream, no matter how misguided. Where would the world be if nobody ever tried because their attempts may fail? 

You say a centralized point of authority is mandatory because that's the way things have always been. But what stops that authority from abusing their position? History as well as science has shown us that humanity is largely incapable of governing itself successfully, without compromise, and without corruption.

A trustless based system rooted in machines is simply a new way of addressing an old problem. Why should we not see this trough? Because we may end up losing some petty, meaningless currency? Well that is a risk I am willing to take Aulne. 
Just wait till Deutshe Bank fails. Then you'll very quickly see Bitcoin in a different light. 

The next financial crises will be the biggest in your lifetime. And it's only a few months away. 
Heh.

Thought it was a shitcoin since 09?

Er.  Do you know how many altcoins there were in 09?

Crikey, I'm not certain there was a BTC until 11, but you'd have to ask a historian about this.

Ha.  You silly fuding fucker :)

You send them your bitcoin, then they double it and send it back.

HA HA HA HA HA 
facepalm
If your bot can double your investment every 2 days, why do you need outsider investment? Just put in $1k now and you‚Äôll have over $1bn in 2 months.
Lol
That is buying and selling, not shorting.
That‚Äôs what AI will do, just as it does with the weather
I'd like to see it stabilize, but at >10k. People who bought in late 2017 need to feel confident and some good news needs to come out. But, a crazy run like Dec 2017 was bound to have a equally crazy drop off.
Of course we do!  We need to be free of the corrupt bankers and governments!  We need our poor brothers and sisters to be saved from the debt slavery!

But first, let's all get rich by having BTC at $100k.  Then we solve above problems.
lol explained my hidden emotions
Yes
Wow! what even is that graph lmao, its like he just drew a straight line from the start to the end without any consideration of the bumps or drops?
Shilling the same comment.. over and over.
yup, critics can't and won't stop progress. They never have in the long term. It's pointless to acknowledge them or let them ruin your mood.
I only pity you. 
Thanks for the explanation.  These bots with their sell walls are getting more than a little annoying.
we need to come up with a way to confuse the bots and make them lose money. Us against them.
If you want to see the price of bitcoin rise hodl and buy, people who dont believe in it dont deserve to have it. Let them sell and lets  make it harder for them to get back in.Set sell orders at 9000 or higher. Lets make them feel our pain.
I know, but if I told you, it would go the other way.
I didnt try to do that. Will try this way then. Thanks
I'm okay with that.
Yes only to hodl no trading
How do i see the volume traded amount for an altcoin?
"redditor for 2 days"
Only goods and services have value everything else is just a mass halucination..including dollars
How much money did you lose?
I agree with that pattern.  Id say accumulating at any price below 12k at this point is a great long term bargain.  Best part is the public won't start to care again until the market is back over 15k and this time i won't care about talking about it with my family and friends.   
It's always done that man, it's just happening at a much faster rate now than in years past.
Or *balls of steel*.
Why does that up set you so much. He's just a hopeful just like every other investor trying to offer words of encouragement.

I'm sure he knows that the will always be a possibility hes wrong.
This is wrong. 
Thanks for this detailed response.  To sum it up are you saying its wise to own some Bitcoin?
so why was Bitcoin invented?
i don't think it needs to be a currency, digital gold is more realistic IMO and i think it could easily be a multi-trillion market cap similar to Gold and still not be a currency or threat to the FIAT system because people will just look at it like an investment/part of their portfolio
Libs love peddling these doomsday scenarios. Man I kinda hope this shit comes true because then I'll be one of the people on the top.
thanks for commenting, great points.  I personally am in the camp of BTc being Digital Gold.  Anything beyond that is too speculative IMO.  Who knows what the future holds, but I think BTC could have a market cap of 1-2 trillion without disrupting the legacy system too much.  Instead it could just serve as a hedge and a part of a person's typical portfolio - mix of stocks, bonds, gold, and now bitcoin
Because it keeps your private keys safe.
I think it needs some good news to kick back into a bull market.
Yes couse someone with millions is gonna buy as much as possible at low price and not gonna throw it all in. Think a little
Where are you seeing this?
Precisely.

BTW.  Nothing stupid about Mom and Pop - they just don't have the resources.
I also say hodl like yodel. I think the meme also started around the time of hodor, game of thrones. I believe the rhyme with yodel is correct. Hodl like Hodor
Good one...*man*.
actually $0 is the bottom, that like saying $20,000 is the ceiling. To the moon.
..although it might go up.
hmmmm.  So should I panic early to make up for all the panicking I cant do when I'm dead? Got it!
I would panic if I lived that long. 
Same here. Now is the time.  Can‚Äôt cry later when price is over 20k.   ‚ÄúOh poor me, how could I have missed out on buying in early 2018?‚Äù   

It happened to me that I didn‚Äôt even know about bitcoin until December 2017.  I am determined to never miss another opportunity like that again. 
Sell some so you can buy it back!
10 x 200,000 / 51,939 =38,5 years of average US income. I know, it always looks like a lot of money until it is all the money you have.
Are you talking about Canada?

which MAs are you talking about, lol?
not bad not bad))))))
Give it another poke.  It seems to work.
This is true, emotional trades or being impatient are 100% my undoing, as with many others here that probably dont want to admit it. Overall im talking .005 so no real skin to lose or gain. Still able to make trades but the last week or two has gotten me fatigued with these swings. Im doing 1-2 trades a day vs. 8-10 at the end of march. 
Really hoping it‚Äôll scratch 6.5 early this week but thats small potatoes for me. Would much rather have it at 7k for awhile
Still waiting...
It's probably going to dump between 1 and 3pm EST today. Not joking.
It's probably going to dump between 1 and 3pm EST today. Not joking.

So should I just be patient and set a limit order around 6k? I know it may be a while before we hit that price. I‚Äôm thinking maybe I‚Äôm better off buying closer to the market value now, selling at a slight profit, and buying back in lower. 
I have a feeling we go sideways then up
*knocks crack pipe out of suchwowe's hand*
no fun : (
How about now?
3.. 4.. hm, didn't happen
You can confidently say that AFTER it hits $7000.
Aye, but yours as well.
Hey, I don't care about the price, i've already mentioned that i've been here since googling "bitcoin worth" yielded no results. I do agree about trying out new systems based on trust. And it'd be damned interesting to see where trust in the machines gets us. I was just trying to gauge  how committed a certain part of the population was. My original thought process is that current political system is deeply flawed, but also that there is no other way to work it out but amongst ourselves.(humans.  That's my premise)
months?  No way, really?  I'm with you that it's coming but I really don't feel it being so close.
I've explained some of my beliefs in a reply below. But I do agree, a financial crisis can happen at any moment. I just wanna make sure that bitcoin does not offer ... no way to be diplomatic here... a weak  person an easy way to bury their head in the sand. Still, haven't had btc and financial crisis together
When it happens, your bitcoin will be worthless.
Still peddling your BTC as mankind's saviour from financial crisis bullshit?

BTC (and all cryptos) are just digital tokens.  One fine day when the bubble has burst, we will be kicking ourselves on why we paid thousands of dollars for a token.
Btc started Jan 9 2009.
Namecoin the first altcoin in 2011.

Reading. I know it's hard with all these letters, but you should try it sometime...
Lol it was free, then I forgot about it, then I couldn't get it out of my electrum wallet because 2fa. Then the price crashed and I said fuck it. Also need some bcash to buy something from a bunch of super cucks so I have about $15 left over from that also.



Fascinating idea. You can get your bots to throw a wrench in the plans of other bots and cash in. Basically manipulating the manipulators. 
You're welcome buddy! :D let me know if that works.
Alts are for trading to get the the high returns in BTC or USD not for hodling long term.
In that case, check out r/siacoin
Depends on the broker I suppose. Bitfinex displays it. Just a simple question of sorting it by preference. I don't know what other information sources there is out there for that kind of thing. 

Maybe someone else reading this knows ? 
Owww ..... that hurts!

But it doesn't change the facts.  I'm just the messenger boy.

Anyway, good luck.  There's still time for good profits before the ship sinks :)
Sure.  

And you buy these goods and services using a currency that is acceptable to the seller, which happens to be .... dollars.  

Why?  Because the same seller, have to pay it's tax in dollars, pay it's suppliers in dollars and report it's financial performance in dollars.

This is the reality, bro.  If you happen to be living in a life that is different, let me know.


I and others would appreciate if you explain instead of simply claiming me to be wrong

You generate your keys in an airlocked VM/OS and never expose them.  You sign your transactions in a watch only wallet.  You can encrypt and back up your keys.  Further you can use steganography combined with encryption to be even more secure in safeguarding your keys.  
Blockchain.info, none of the other hashrate charts match it tho so I think they just messed something up.
And they aren't acting coordinated. And this makes them *stupid* in a sense, because their accumulated actions are easy to predict psychologically.
the "o" makes an long "I" sound. 
We clearly aren't speaking on the same subject. Because I was referencing the bottom of this particular dip. But keep commenting, maybe someone will enjoy something you type eventually.
True but at the same time, it could go down.

I'm not really sure though, it might go up 
I regret not buying back in 2013. Not buying more in 2014-2016. I honestly think I will feel this way about 2018. It's a chance, a Time Machine golden opportunity. But we humans only have that clarity with hindsight, right?
Ha, I don't play in that sand box.  I buy when I can, try to time it right.  Short term I'm wrong most of the time.  If I buy today, we're destined to have a 3 day down turn.  My hodl game is strong, though.
He will sell at 12,000 lol
Boom!
If you dont have debt, you are healthy and have some sklil somebody wants to pay for and you are willing to leave your things/property behind then YES, you are free.

**Fuck yeah!**
This was a crossover on the 6hr chart, which gave us the 1000 point upswing. Read my comments in r/bitcoin from the past week, and see if the market doesn't make more sense.  
A whale had snatched my stick. Apparently she didnt like the bitcoin was being disturbed too much. 
There's still hope for you. If this guy is right, it will go up a little. And then drop further down. If you're not actively trading, but just waiting for a dip, it's worth a look. And maybe worth a wait.

This guy predicts an even lower dip:

Cross isn't clear enough yet, but buy pressure is increasing
If it can maintain above 6820 for another hour or two, we should see it jump.  May not have approached the line steeply enough this time so we might wait for the next cycle.  There's definitely a lot of resistance right now.
But then again: It's probably going to jump between 1 and 3pm EST today. Not joking.

Watch the short term moving average crossover the long term on the 1hr chart, and watch the price go up when it happens.
aaaaand no pump. 
Good luck timing the swings.

For all we know, it could go 20% up or 20% down at any given time.
what I do is buy on the way down and set limits 3-5% profits its slow but you will increase your bitcoin. And at the end of the day bitcoin is what i am after.
That is also my prediction. Happens every year at this time. Tax refunds add up lol
Nah. Well maybe. Only future man knows for sure.
He was texting and driving.
>My original thought process is that current political system is deeply flawed, but also that there is no other way to work it out but amongst ourselves.(humans. That's my premise)

This is the true reason I believe in supporting bitcoin so adamantly. not because I think it is the answer, but becuse it serves as a proof of concept. proof that we can have a system where trust is irrelevant because save for the exception of a hack (nothing is perfect) the system itself dissolves that requirement, by creating a lack of incentive to do so.

money makes the world turn as the saying goes. well if we can have a decentralized currency, than that proves we can have a decentralized government where no one entity is in charge. A truly free institution run by the people, all people, for the people.

of course we are still a far ways off, but computers do as they are told and have nothing to gain. its also worth noting that the AI sentience problem is irrelevant in the main system as one would only need that for judgement and not function.

The only real concern here is that a human will still need the write the initial code. that one in a billion person, truly pure and free of corruption. without that special enlightened individual the whole game would be rigged from the start. but, no matter how rare, now we just need one exceptional being to free us from ourselves instead of relying on millions.

TLDR; I don't actually believe in bitcoin so much as I do the idea and the possibilities it represents.

Edit: fixed numerous grammatical and spelling errors. the high dose of Modafinil is kicking in now so my IQ has effectively halved. lol
I wouldn't be surprised to see full on crash this year. It's very close. Fed has already started tapering QE and raising interest rates. Turning off the tap that's driving the markets. Just a question of time now. 

 Wish I had another year or two to position myself for it, but I don't think there's that much time left. 
Might be, but it's just the first iteration of the idea. There's already another 1000 attempts at it and that will just continue to accelerate. 
It will be used within people who trust it. Others will be carrying wheelbarrow full of cash. Try to imagine how difficult it will be to mine bitcoin in this situation and even use bank account to buy more on Exchange... Locally it will skyrocket against fiat. Plus - everybody will try to get some because they will need to save their savings. Easy as that. Only going up or sideways.
I very clearly said I don't know if it's the answer, you need other assets as well, yet there is a significant chance that a big enough crises will cause people to simply abandon a deeply flawed and clearly broken system completely. Fractional reserve banking is inherently unstable people are starting to catch on. We don't need to stumble from crises to crises. 

What is it with you mate ? Why all the hate ? The whole universe is based on math, why can't a currency be ? We've used rice, cowry shells, printed pieces of paper. Why not math ? And code?


Really?

Heh.

Huh? 
I was looking for their postal address.  Strangely they don't have one.  But they do have a cookie policy.
"Shorting stock¬†is the process of borrowing¬†stock¬†you don't own, selling it, and pocketing the proceeds. Later, you have to buy back the¬†stock¬†and return it to the owner from whom you borrowed the shares. This¬†means¬†a person who shorts a¬†stock¬†makes money when the¬†stock¬†declines, rather than appreciates"

That's from thebalance.com
whoops, sorry, its hard to tell what is and isn't a joke on this sub anymore.
Its not a very good graph when it completely ignores 70% of the data its  supposed to be representing.
Lol ... actually, that is what's happening in the stock market - bots trying to outsmart other bots and the market.  

90% of trading there is carried out by bots.  It's basically an AI war in there.  It has gotten so complex that humans no longer understand the reason for some of the phenomena like sudden changes in trading patterns during the last two hours.

And I believe most of that tech was brought into the crypto exchanges.
It worked buddy. 
So can you tell me what a debit card is backed by or what money in a bank is backed by numbers. So if I go to a store and want to purchase something how does the person know that I have the funds to cover my purchase? They dont call the bank and say hey does he have money in his account. It is all numbers. in the 1800 gold was worth $19 an ounce now its a little over a $1000 why is gold so high? Who knows. But just because you dont believe something is worth a certain prices doesnt mean its not. Crypto are the future and if you don't think so we you are in bad shape. If you think about it debit cards are backed by money, gold is backed by money cryptos are backed by money. But bitcoin is putting the power back in the peoples had. I just traded a few coins and made a little profit but the banks do the same thing with your money and they keep all the profits how is that fair. Bitcoin and cryptos are the future embrace it change is good.
Fair enough, but you shouldn't make such a bold, false statement about mining profitability without explaining that yourself. 

Though mining profitability has fallen, you can still gain net profits depending on what your energy cost is. I'm running x10 S9 antminers on full solar energy at essentially 100% profit. Even if I tapped into the grid, I would still be making a small profit because the kWh cost in my area is fairly cheap. 
Even if I was mining straight btc, it is still profitable. I can assure you, noone would mine if it wasn't profitable. The real question is difficulty vs price inflation. Will it stack up to warrant the cost of hardware and electricity, or is it cheaper to buy in and hold.

Usually the former over the latter (barley) but it is all speculation.
Have you heard about the proposed Bitcoin Interest rate - BIDOR?  The Bitcoin version of LIDOR.  how does that factor into your thinking?
Gosh .... the amount of self-validation.

BTC is a digital token, it too is 'magically' created, just like the other 1,700 alts.  If you think that the artificially induced cost of mining gives it value, you are wrong - it doesn't.
so you think i should sell?
do you short Bitcoin?  maybe thats something i should try
Sure, you can do all that. Or you can just use a hardware wallet without all the hassle.
Yeah, you should watch them dancing.
I know I was just being optimistic, looking at the glass half full instead of half empty.
There is one thing I am certain of - it can't go up and down simultaneously.

Unless, of course, that is what is happening now.  Which is a further possibility.
I think you misunderstood, I bought @ "$13", and have never sold any, why would I sell at $12,000?, it's not about the money anymore.
Lol.
And you don't have a wife or kids, and you have your own house, and you aren't addicted to gambling. Well since you're here, you probably are.

All this info is useless unless you can show historically one of these people constantly being correct in their predictions.
I'm confused. Maybe I'll just hold and buy the dips...
EMA or SMA?

What is short term, what is long term for you? 10, 20, 50, 100, 200?
It was a joke.
 Which leads me to believe I should just be patient and wait for a lower buy-in.  Then again, I don‚Äôt want to go up 20% and miss out on potential gains.
[deleted]
future man here, no moon just mantle

Agreed.  I wish I could look into the crystal ball to see just how much one would need to put in to BTC today to have a million bucks in 5 years.   Silly, I know.
Bro, simple - fiat is the government's instrument for fiscal control.  And if you think governments are going to concede control, you are nuts.

And to suggest that cryptos, with ridiculous daily price swings and wholesale manipulation, is a cure for the banking system is just retarded.
Well it took me about 2 mins to find them...well anyway to find who knows who they are. 

https://www.whois.com/whois/48hoursbitcoin.com
Well if they have a cookie policy they must be legit.
Crypto community has co-opted the term "short" to mean the opposite of "long". You are long if you own the asset, so you are short if you own the cash instead. To go short is to sell crypto for fiat cash. It's not technically correct usage of the term. Is there a better term to use when comparing bull/bear outlooks? If you are long, you think price will go up. What would be a better opposite than short?
Yay! I finally helped someone. 
Sure sure ... plenty of nice theories.

You seem to miss the most important point - When I walk into a store, I can use a credit or debit card and the transaction is completed with a signed slip or if I want, to use my iPhone.  Period.

It works and has worked well for a long time.

The only looneys walking around preaching for a change are mostly hypocrites wanting to profit from a price surge.  Chances of that happening - Zero.
Well, I am not about to argue, but your case is more exception to the rule. However, even if energy costs 0, there are a lot of other costs, such as Internet, Maintenance, rent, amortization and so on. You should remember that your own time also costs something as well as your computer/miner should be repaired/replaced sooner or later. Also if you have free space at your home/flat which you use to place your miners - you don't have to consider it as something free, but better imagine if you rent it to someone, or sell the energy from you solar batteries instead of using it for miners. I am just trying to say that you can get more profit from this resources.

TL;DR I agree, it could be profitable, but less then before and you need some special circumstances for this
[deleted]
Yeah, it takes a few minutes to do that vs buying, paying, waiting for the wallet to arrive, etc.

Then you are trusting the manufacturer or the reseller and trusting that it has not been tampered with and they don't steal your funds.

Well you have to admit that‚Äôs in sharp contrast to asking if 10 bitcoin is enough to buy freedom.
thanks, looking at it now
I'm using the gdax chart so when the orange line crosses above the grey. 12 and 26.
Cost average your buys and you‚Äôll be fine.

If you don‚Äôt know what it means, just google it!

Well i buy lets say I invest $50 a paycheck no matter what the price is doing, and set a 3-5% increase. Try it im not saying everytime the price goes down buy, just set up a payment schedule to invest. Currently I have 17 orders since march 7 waiting to be filled. Its a waiting game you gotta be patient. And never sell to buy back in.
Very possible to make a million this year. Just need to get some long momentum going again. 
Actually, is not up to government in the long run. I think people are starting to realize we don't need to be governed, we just need a system. 10 million of our brightest minds are working on that right now. 

Crypto's are immature. Only 10 years old. What do you think it will look like in 30 years ? 
[deleted]
whois?  Are you some sort of internet genius?
No, you are hodling if you own the asset. You're long if you've borrowed from the exchange to buy an amount, which you will then pay back with the gains you make later.
Touch√©. It's just a bit confusing.
Okay well the first debit card was issued in 1966 and became popular in the 1980 and 1990's which means banks have had a lot of time to figure out new ways to charge you for using your own money. So this is just the start. So call it what you want just dont miss the train ride to the moon.
Though I understand your cost analysis, I did not evaluate my personal situation that way as it did not apply.  I agree that mining is more difficult for some and not profitable for others. I even use the heat from the miners to heat my home in the winter, so I save on energy costs there. With summer coming, I will have to spend energy on cooling, though that should be fully covered by the solar array too. I was fortunate enough to recoup costs for equipment during the ATH. My situation is an outlier, sure. But, to make a blanket statement that 'mining is not profitable' is far from the truth. 
As Nate says, the question is more can we mine and be profitable. So we already have internet and a place to mine. So hidden costs are really just racks, sub panels and circuit breakers, conduit (expensive) and outlets. Also cooling.

Mining is essentially investing, there is a risk based on speculation. When price goes up, your profits go up, especially if you hold.

But difficulty is the real concern, if difficulty is skyrocketing the whole time, you may find that even with moon prices, you would have been more profitable buying. But it could just as well go the other way. - we won't know till it happens.

However, markets do have to follow some rules to some extent or they would collapse and we inadvertently dictate this. Like miners not introducing any more new coins until the price is desirable.
 
so the odds will always be that mining will be slightly more profitable than investing in the long term if you hold profits and only sell to cover costs. (But of course you then further increase your risk exposure.)

Electricity and how much you value your time is often what will make or break you.
I've seen it mentioned in articles that I've read over the last month or so but don't have any links handy 
Heh.  

He looks more like a Bcasher to me.
Where do I say "buy" ?
I‚Äôm aware of what it means, but I just can‚Äôt afford to set aside a percent of my income every paycheck to buying bitcoin. I feel like I have the time the dips properly (obviously easier said than done). I wish I was financially stable enough to be able to do that, but that‚Äôs just not an option for me right now.
[deleted]
Possible, maybe....but how much BTC would one need to be holding to do that?  I'm always striving for more, and my target always feels impossibly far away.
It is absolutely up to governments on how they want to regulate and manage the economy.  

Now, whether they can do a good job - that's another matter.


Lol - is it really worth the time man, rather watch Bitcoin do nothing. Again.
Clearly mate. Don't make me come after you as well. 
I'll google you...
Oh, I'm in for the ride.  

Just need to be realistic on what we are doing :)
Booooh!

He's cool!
In that case, it's not enough.
I stick with US based exchanges.
Man - I'm not sure if Bitcoin alone is the answer. We don't know what Bitcoin is going to do in a crash.

You need some PM stocks, some actual PM's in a vault, not a bank. Some Crypto's and a bunch of cash and booze. 

So the idea is get into the crypto's for this next leg up and then convert some of that to other asset classes to get a good distribution of assets. 


For time being. But the distributed ledger will change that over time. The two systems are going to live and compete together for at least 20 maybe 30 years, but in the end the idea that is Bitcoin will win. 
Helluva good point.  Admittedly, I'm too heavy into crypto from a percentage standpoint (and it's not close).  If I can somehow reach a full bitcoin my plan is to start balancing out with stocks.  That's the plan anyways.  Thanks for the chat, gave me some great food for thought today.
> PM

Philip Morris?  If so I'd love to hear why...
We may be living on Mars in 20-30 years or ruled by aliens.  

So .. whatever.
Precious Metals. Gold. 
Or I could happily trade crypto's and the 1000% spikes for the rest of my life and live like a king. 
That makes much more sense.  Where the hell does one even go to buy gold?
1000% spikes measured against?
Depends on the budget. Couple of thousand bucks down at the jewelry store. Tens of millions there are specialist suppliers and storage facilities, like in Singapores international zone at their airport.
USD or whatever the standard ends up being. Might even be gold way things are going. 
Tens of millions?  Yeah, don't have to worry about that one.  I don't even have a half a bitcoin 

*drowns in tears*
Just don't hold all the time, there's plenty of 1000% spikes on this stuff. If you're up 1000% take out half, and wait for something to crash. Then spend that cash on the crash. Just keep working it. We've got years of that ahead. 
Good advice, will jot it down.  Definitely not 1000% up, but that'd be a fantastic benchmark to do just that.
That's what happened last year. Likely to happen again. But guaranteed it will crash again. So when you're up enough, put some of the money aside for a crash. You only need 3 or 4 trades like that and you're buying gold by the ton. 
Good god, what a dream!  Today brought me back into the green, but my a negligible amount.  Still happy with it though!  Now hopefully we can do some rising.
