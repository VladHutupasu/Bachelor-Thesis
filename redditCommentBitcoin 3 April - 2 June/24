Daily Discussion, May 10, 2018 -- TITLE
Took this time before the next big breakout to buy more Bitcoin.. and I am excited to say I now own over one whole Bitcoin!
Bought @8950. Fuck it...
The road to 10k, part 2 - this time it's personal!
pay day is tomorrow, I'm buying some whether it goes up or down
Well if that‚Äôs the bull run over, then it was the worst bull run ever. 
Why is there no Daily Discussion for 11th May yet?
This dip made me giggle. 
Relax guys, it‚Äôs just a korean new year 
Why is the volume so low? Sub 5k on GDAX
Hopefully it doesn‚Äôt go below $9k, otherwise I would lose all my new investment forever 
Always a silver lining - Btrash has tanked.

:)
Support at 9000/9100 is strong. I expect 9400 tomorrow again
We're still in an uptrend with higher lows. But to be honest, I'd love to see some higher highs, as well...

edit: this post didn‚Äòt age well. ‚òπÔ∏è
Was there just a huge Mt Gox dump?
At least we have volume now...
*giggling intensifies* 

wow, definitely wasn‚Äôt expecting to wake up to this 
Hardly any panic selling after a large dump.  Looks bullish to me going into the weekend   üôÇ
Well just bought .0385 of BTC. If it keeps dipping, I'm buying more :) but definitely not selling my btc. My goal is to have 1 full btc by this year so every dip I buy to increase my portfolio.  
I'm just gonna write this here, n00b as hell.

I transferred BTC to my Jaxx wallet 3 months ago. I can see the transaction on block chain.info if I search the address, but it's not appearing in the wallet itself.

What happened?
This dip is surprising..thursday was really strong the last weeks
[deleted]
[removed]
Kinda getting terrified of it dipping below 9K. Support has been really strong, but man...
wtf is going on with this price. BTC just cannot sustain a 2018 rally to save its life. 
I hope what happens here is Europe comes in, they go "OMG it's cheap, conference next week, history of a bullish influence, $9k held more or less.. Buy, buy, buy !!"
Well at least the volume is back. 
Wow, for the first time in a while I am actually shocked by a dip. Was not expecting this one at all üò≥
I'm 19 years old and own .25 btc can't wait to be retired at 25.  
I honestly didn't think we'd see prices under 9k again after last week, figured it was the floor, even though I'm disappointed that it wasn't the case, I'm also happy that this might allow me get more btc for cheap as I work towards owning 2 full btc
6k wooooh letz goooo HAHAHAHA HA HA HA HU HU HUHUHUHUHU üò≠üò≠üò≠
Does anyone here think next weeks conference will bring Bitcoin above 10k again? Really craving to see my holdings skyrocket in value üòç
It's a trap guys. There has literally been nothing but good news lately. The Whales are trying to FUD you into selling before next week's summit so they can buy lower.
**Buffett 'Disciple' Condemns Investor's Views On Bitcoin**

https://www.coindesk.com/venture-capitalist-disciple-of-buffett-condemns-his-views-on-bitcoin/

Venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya has countered billionaire Warren Buffett's recent derogatory statements on bitcoin, stating that the cryptocurrency is "important."

His comments come after Buffett, the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, argued that bitcoin is more of a gamble than an investment at the end of April, and then, last weekend at a shareholders' meeting, he said bitcoin is "probably rat poison squared."

While calling himself a Buffett "disciple," Palihapitiya told CNBC that Buffett is wrong about bitcoin.

"Not everybody is right all the time," he told the news source, further suggesting that that knowledge about technology is not in Buffett's "circle of competence."

Palihapitiya, a former Facebook and AOL executive, went on to push for the cryptocurrency's benefits, saying it is a replacement to gold and:

"Something like bitcoin is really important, because it is not correlated to the rest of the market."

Speaking about the financial crisis, he said that "things that we thought were hedges went away" and "broke down." Bitcoin is viewed as providing a hedge to traditional finance by those who have owned the digital currency, he said.
The more it drops the more btc I make! Bc it's on sale! 
target this week: 10k8
Will America push us up today?
Tension is rising...
So New York wakes up and the sell orders come flying in!! 
We're going all the way to $9400 today. MOON shot!
Rumors of bitcoin on wallstreet + the fact for the last three years bitcoin has had all time high during summertime.... what do you guys think? Moon soon??
Interesting, seems like someone's actually dumping a ton of real BTC here, no long/short games.

Anyone thought about setting up a LN on a Raspberry Pi as a project?  

Looks like a fun and cheap project.  I'd like to have my own node :))

(Someone not banned please post over on r/btc - they might want to try something new and groundbreaking rather than just stealing.)


Bitcoin looks like my monthly statement right now. The pumps being my income and the dumps signify bills and when things break unexpectedly. I just keep hoping nothing breaks ....
damn!!!

buy a trezor directly from trezor, and dhl send me a message that tax for import are about 95 dollars!!!

then check using my mail box and import taxes are about 5usd!!!

im feeling tempted to cancel the order :(
Oh poop.

Somebody go kick vegeta awake. He may be needed soon 
Approaching 9k!

Is there a meme for that?
It‚Äôs over 9000. Hopefully for good!

Edit:  lol or not 
wtf going on?

Is this the lull before the storm?  The Concensus Meeting starts on Monday and many expect prices to start going up this coming week. 
I don't get all the negativity

A slight dip and its the end of the world

I thought you lot were made of sterner stuff where has all the positivity gone

Its a great buy in opportunity
Facebook are releasing a shitcoin
Lots of investment this year
I think most of us are bullish long term

Man up bois
Hey guys, hows the Rat Poison today?  :-)

Will we see Bitcoin at $100k within the next 10 years? 
I'm told we get banned here easily. Why?
This is the bottom. 

Why do I know that? If I had my coins on an exchange I would panic sell now. 

Whenever I did that in the past, the price started to rise and I would lose coins.

Luckily I have transferred all the coins I had remaining on an exchange to my hardware wallet last week, so I can't act on impulse anymore.
When moon
NVIDIA forecasting less mining.  Hence the drop.
Free .... Free falling 
I actually believe this is temporary 

Waiting for the right buy back in price

It has dropped a few hundred not thousands lol
Just as I predicted. We will see 7.8k here real soon.
What is causing this massive drop?

Edit: Sudden
So the comments last week got me excited and I purchased at $9800.  :/ Less than 500 usd. Am I going to lose it all?? I know that‚Äôs peanuts to most of you and I can technically afford to lose it but really don‚Äôt want to.  Is it worth it or should I just pull it out?? Sorry..I‚Äôm new to this.
Would someone who knows the latest about Lightning Network be willing to answer some questions?

* Were any major unforeseen technical hurdles revealed during the Alpha or Beta phase of LND? \(please describe\)
* Exchanges surely want to give their users the option of instant\+free deposits and withdrawal \(thru Lightning\). So what is preventing more exchanges from offering Lightning deposit addresses? Or are they still working through the unfamiliar territory of running a 24/7 uptime LN daemon?
   * If you work in a technical capacity for a crypto exchange, your voice would be valuable here.
* Would it help LN adoption if light\-wallets started using Lightning Network as the back\-end by default \(while hiding this fact from the GUI so the end\-user doesn't get scared or whatever\).
   * I.e. can we anticipate "psychological resistance" to Lightning wallets by non\-hardcore users?

Thank you to any respondents!
whats this xapo vault thing doing rounds. how does it work? i wish i may need it some day ;-)
Fuck me the suspense is unreal 
Well that dildo is the wrong colour.

Good to see something happening though.

(Massive RED on Bitstamp..)
Thoughts on Robinhood? 
An honest question, with all the effect bitcoin had globally and how brilliant the whole idea of the technology behind it, do you think that governments didn‚Äôt really dig to find who Satoshi is? I just can‚Äôt find it easy to believe that. This bit of bitcoin creation is just very very surreal for me to believe, the idea of a mysterious person inventing something this big, holding this huge amount of money and power (let alone brain), and just be able to disappear.
Sure this doesn‚Äôt change anything about bitcoin, I just can‚Äôt believe that it‚Äôs not some government agency top priority to identify him/ her/ them.
All I got to say is I didn't lose any btc and that's all I care about. I'll pay double for what the price! I'll pay $20 of btc for $40 right now 
Fuck my ass
Old generation of redditors showing up again. We may see MrManHimself soon again. 
Why?Suddenly the bitcoin price falls down...and still falllllllllllllllllllllllll...

The dickline is fading into the distance .. 
Is anyone here?
All hands to the lifeboats!!!  


Do we still expect a big up turn next week when the meeting takes place? 
This caused by stupid activity.

Bitcoin Gold up 50%, Bitcoin Diamond? - not just shitcoins - non-coins pumping for days.  

And BCash pumping.  Known scamcoins pumping.

So easy to pump Bcash - I could pump it myself by a few percent.

Now all is collapsed.  Serves all the liars and tricksters like Ver, and the day trading gamblers right.

Bollocks can never sustain.

But look - BTC is less badly hit than all the major coins!!!

What a FUCKING surprise, that something honest and established sustains.

Well FUCK ME ROGER.

Too much shit in this space chaps - 

I've said enough.

Have a good weekend :)
This market is trash
LOWERRRRRRRRRRR.
Hodlers:
Price Drops 25%. "It's only a Minor Correction".
Price Drops 50%. "This is good for Bitcoin".
Drops to $1. "You should have invested only what you could lose". 
xD
8k here we go!!!!!!
**Come on Bulls, the mood is positive, lets get it to around $9450 and keep the rally going!**
Anyone else wondering when mt gox is going to sell off the rest of it's Bitcoin so you can buy the resulting dip?
Is my bitcoin gone? Can anyone give me answers?

Where are we heading guys?
6k here we come
Ill be damn. We have a real chance of 7k territory again.

**Support The Bulls!**
Okay Lightning question: In order for a merchant to recieve lightning payments het must have at least 1 channel open with a customer with btc on the customer side of the channel. In the network payments will flow trought these channels. These channels will be super important for the merchant because they will be their gateway to the network. Will this not lead to centralisation and hubs that will keep these channels open as a paid service (through fees for example)?

This will be the last time you will see BTC below 9k lol

Congratulations.

Right behind you at 8997. 
I bought today at 9370. Woohoo ü§ï
Good luck!
I think there's a good chance we continue dropping, so I'll save my larger buys for then.  Still, I just bought a small amount at $8890 in case I'm wrong.  
Low Volume!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ega5Rcct2s
I think we are gonna see a lot of Sideways movement until after the conference next week. Obviously speculation since no one has a crystal ball so ymmv
As soon as that direct deposit hits
no discussion to hide our comments of disappointment today
For real - why ISN'T there a daily discussion for May 11th yet?  Isn't that a little weird?
I keep checking back but apparently yes, we‚Äôre just going to pretend today didn‚Äôt happen 
Waiting with baited breath, you can always watch https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ikz1u/daily_discussion_friday_may_11_2018/?st=jh1y07hh&sh=b2860320
Today didn't happen.
Cause Today there is NO TODAY xD
why should it be high? no real dump, no real pump for a while now. 
I noticed this as well and am equally as curious 
yeah its the first time I have seen this sub 5k in last 5 months. 
One reason can be that GDAX was under maintainence for some time today. But still <5k is too less
Volume on Bitfinex is ok. Not super high, but ok.
Maybe the maintenance lowered the daily trade volume.
Why? - just hold it.

You don't lose any BTC until you sell it.

RIP
All cryptos are falling. They are all tied up together, like CDOs of the cryptoworld.
Bcash pumping was the indicator for the move up the past 3 weeks. Bcash dumping is probably another indicator
I would say support 8800/9100 is strong. But if we break that I could see it dropping quite quick.
Edit: big IF
Agreed.  9k support is extremely strong.


No. Just whalers doing their thing. They are here for the profit.
LOL
Could be a bear flag forming. I hope not.

Actually, all TA patterns have been completely worthless in the past weeks. It's all so irratic. Even the most popular TA guys on tradingview either stopped posting their predictions or started to become "sports moderators", just commenting on the latest developments. LOL!
Yep, every time the price dips, it‚Äôs bargain purchase time!
Great atiitude
Hacked.
..I'm not sure Thursday is marked out as something special on traders' charts.
9k doesnt look good.
You mean 1% ?
As soon as it shows 8 I‚Äôm buying again. 
Prepare yourself...
[This too shall pass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qybUFnY7Y8w)
It's only may, consensus is next week so expect price to run

Really?  I sold my trading stack yesterday at 9000.  The EMAs on the 6h and 1d chart indicated a big downswing was about to happen.
[deleted]
wow that is how long you will handle a bitcoin. I know it will be a good investments
Millennials ..... sigh
I didn't think so either. What's even more surpising is the timing. We're so close to this consensus meeting that usually pushes prices up. I'm itching to buy but I want to see prices hold above $9k first. 
The floor is 6k and we're going that way
We'll cross it.  Will we hold it?
Tom Lee, co funder of Fundstrat Global, said that bitcoin could increase between 10&#37; and 70&#37; after the conference. So fingers crossed. 
buyers increase bitcoin price.

so i dont think so, that kind of conference are only interesting for hard core users.
Yep. They‚Äôre not getting mine!
Fool me once. We are onto their game and have been buying the dips.
All time high was last December, not summer time
what charts are you looking at?
[Profit takers playing their game.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZomwVcGt0LE)
figured as much. I‚Äôve been watching the action since yesterday and every time it got over 9350 sell orders would pop up, usually 17,  Today, the orders were bigger, sometimes 20, even 50. Pretty consistent. Surprised it held up so well, for this long, because it was relentless.   Wish they would take a breather!
Looks like it and see https://blokt.com/news/mt-gox-cold-wallet-moves-8200-btc-will-bitcoin-dump
Can someone explain to me why Mt GOX has so much bitcoin and it was never returned to the people that lost their bitcoin?
I'd love to do it, but I'm afraid it'll use up too much bandwidth...
What did you expect? Usually it‚Äòs cheaper to buy from a shop which is located in your country.

I dunno.  I've been posting freely for 6 years here and never had a problem.
Let me guess: You heard about it in /r/btc ?
[deleted]

Hello ; i think it's a good analysis .. let's see which way bitcoin goes now;
2022
2020
On the day I get fired, hopefully.
Less mining would mean less supply though right?  Honestly don't know why this matters regardless, I'm pretty sure the market is basing everything as if there are 21mil btc anyways, we all know this is the limit, doubt that forecast is the reason unless people are extremely dumb and don't understand how this works
BTC is actually holding pretty strong compared to every other top coins. They are in the -20%s today already. jeez
[deleted]
What massive drop?  It's just $200.
While massive is subjective and your massive might be a gorilla my massive is king kong. $100-$200 is not massive in bitcoin price movement :-)
Leave it alone and forget about it.

Come back in 5 years.
No offence mate but if you can't stand heat stay out of the kitchen. If you are invested for the long term game and only invest what you can afford to lose then you shouldn't worry, just hodl and dollar cost average.

After you've been in the market a while you will get used to the volatility. Don't stress
Hold mate .. You haven't lost anything until you sell 
You'd be stupid to sell, it'll be over 10k by the end of May
Good rule of thumb, if something is running up 5\-10&#37; for several days in a row, be skeptical of buying. And if you buy and then it drops, selling should be the last thing you do unless it looks like an apocalyptic drop.
Hold it mate, sold when you've reached your target..
Most people here are idiots. A good rule of thumb is to buy when it‚Äôs the lowest it‚Äôs been in a week.  Better rule of thumb is buying when it‚Äôs the lowest it‚Äôs been in a month. You bought near the high of the month, so you might need to wait a bit for profits. 

Whether it goes up or down long term is anyone‚Äôs guess, but I think it‚Äôll go beyond 9.8 in the next month or so. It‚Äôs not going to zero anytime soon, so you‚Äôre not going to lose your money. If you don‚Äôt absolutely need that money, hold, and you‚Äôre likely to at least break even in the next month or so, imo.  
Pull out i say. This baby is gokng back to 8k
This always happens when there's good news for my alts, fucking Bitcoin -.-
Allegedly could loose an arrow and split another arrow, stuck in an oak tree, down the middle from a great distance.

Hated by the Sheriff of Nottingham.
Crypto can look big to you right now but in 2009 I guess governments / intelligence had other things to do than discover Satoshi. Now Bitcoin works without his creator so I think if a government knew who Satoshi is they would not necessary call him out at it would be huge hype for Bitcoin & crypto currencies in general. Anyway we already have a short list of potential Sat's.
Satoshi is not an individual.  It's actually a group of CIA cryptographers.

Yes, that's right.  Bitcoin was created by CIA to funnel money out to their field agents.
I mean it's feasible that the gov is satoshi .. 
Lambo too, not even going to be able to afford a Tesla like this...
We will get back to it.
I‚Äôm here. I‚Äôm so pissed that I bought right before the drops, that‚Äôs all. 
Nope, we‚Äôve all gone home
stop panicking! üòâ
Smart investors will be stocking up on shitcoins right now

It has its own nature :)

Gotta love that!
Nope literally no one cares. You will learn, fud only works once or twice. Not 4 times. Sorry you fell for it again though. 
Based off what?

 
Take heart. Seems like good support around 8.9k.  Weekend is around the corner, and conference next week. All good things 
We might actually need to reach that territory to break 10k.   I don't make the rules, but it's just how it works.

You are? Nice. How big is your short position?

Merchant does not need to have a channel open with the customer. There just needs to be some path from customer to merchant that is no more than 20 nodes long. 20 may sound like a small number but its actually plenty (insert graph theory). Some nodes may become very well connected but that does not risk centralization. Such a node could threaten to go offline or charge high fees, but it's EXTREMELY unlikely that you could not find a path to your merchant through different nodes given the 20 node ceiling. Why is it unlikely? Because every individual node has strong incentive to be well connected.
Good for Bitcoin.
There won‚Äôt be support until the EMAs cross back up on the 1d chart.
Ta just gives people something to talk about in blogs, youtube..ect, Other than certain observations such as dead cat bounce, support lines...ect, It is useless

BTC always wins out.  

BCD is still in the GREEN FFS - no-one knows or cares what it is.

That is pure gambling.

Hodl something worth hodling.
What do you see that adds support at 9000?  I understand big round numbers are natural support / resistance but outside of some old highs on the hourly chart that came in around 9k I don't see other support.
Or a reverse Bart instead?
but he tracked last thursday. So he had a sample size from 1 and 100&#37; of the time it went up. 

So it is really surprising that it did broke that pattern. 
Exactly.. Thursdays LMAO

Need a bit more of that. If we can get real momentum going it's back to $10k for another test. 
Take that $250k to a developing country and you can retire.
Who said I'm done buying?
250k is more than I've ever spent or owned my whole life. Just for perspective, that's ten years of my pay. 

A smart and restrained fiscal plan with 250k and any decent relaxed job would set you for the rest of your life. Maybe not a full retirement, but plenty of money to not have to work to live.

He was being sarcastic, lighten up
[deleted]
Mtgox coins moving around has people selling I think. 
Even though he's a shiller looking at those charts and I would agree there's a very bullish consistency there
Tom Lee is full of BS.  

If you trace what he said, you will find that he creates new stories to cover his wrong analysis and predictions.
Source please? 
If they are from the southern hemisphere December is summer.

Well not considering the insane $1000 spike of 2014 it crashed and then reaches a high of 300+ in summer 2015 then 750+ spike of summer 2016 and then 4000+ spike of summer 2017. "All time high" was the wrong term to use but for the last 3 years there has been a spike during the end of the year then a drop and then a spike during the summer and then a drop and so on... 
Because the people who bought bitcoins at MtGOX, those who answered to the Japanes Authorities claim request, agreed to receive the Bitcoin market value in USD, at the date of the MtGox fall. Those who filled the claim form, have already received their initial investment and are not longer at a loss.

It would be impossible reimburse the Bitcoins at current market value.
It has to do with local laws that say's things has to be settled in yen.
Current BTC value, of BTC still in possession, is far bigger than the value of all BTC at the time of bankruptcy. The remaining BTC legally belong to the previous owner(s) of the company.

I have been told that it is easy to get banned on /r/bitcoin.
Well, I was wrong. It seems we‚Äòll have to wait quite a while to see higher prices again...
What? Less supply? What are you talking about?
Less mining just means it will be made easier to mine bitcoin so the supply will stay the same. 
So basically you repeated what I said

Jeez?
Of course I‚Äôd like to be wrong. But my comment has no influence on the price whatsoever.

That‚Äôs weirdly comforting for some reason :) Thx!
...is not what the guys that held on to shares of Lehman or Bear Sterns are saying.

Yep, this is so shitty!  
I would have thought you knew to sell as the 1d EMAs approach crossover.  Have I taught you nothing?
Thanks mate.

Selling at market value is literally what drives the price down. Thousands of buy orders, wiped off the table. It has nothing to do with FUD.

Go do some basic cryptocurrency research, buddy.

which conference/
?"

Um weekends are generally low volume and dips lol
Post hoc ergo propter hoc.
Are you Jordan Peterson?  You see, I really enjoyed that, but didn't understand a word of it.
Pervert...
I was gone at 9,6K with profit. 

If it goes up to 9,5K, I will re-enter again, but no sooner than that.

Still very low.  We spiked on the break from 340\-150 but not by much. 
[removed]
Pretty much, lol. 
I believe we are past the bart pattern phase. Haven't seen those in a while...

Although the last 3 days might qualify...
Everyone knows Bitcoin does better when the moon is at apogee. Day of the week has nothing to do with it. 
I am not, Last trade $3000, $30 feeüòï
Gone!
I'm just thinking about the conference its going to go fucking insane 
Hard to take you seriously when last week you were absolutely sure it would be 12k by now and shit on anyone who said otherwise.

Guess a kid can't dream these days smh 
Ha.ha. maybe
The general planning shot closer to 60 than 70
and? do a job you love and you never work a day in your life. I plan on grinding till I fall flat on the floor. retirement isn't for everyone, i would just be bored. what's there to look forward to?
Not the guy you responded to but here's one source:

Lol yea i have lived in the southern hemisphere but i did mean mid year, i just mean there is allways a spike during the summer and then a drop and then a spike at the end of the year... the end of year spike is usually larger but still
/r/bitcoin > sort by new
1m in 3 years, according to https://bircoin.top/

He means less gpu supply for miners.
jeez its bad for those coins
Yes ... and there were many days when it went up more than $500.

It's really no big deal.
It was $6830 less than a month ago. Chill. 
No worries .. I have been burnt many times selling after it drops a bit .. You just end up chasing it back up and lose Half of what you started with .. 
Bitcoin ain't a share son ..
End of May isn't even guaranteed, nothing is guaranteed but going by the last 4 years, market should be recovering by then. 
Looking at previous years. End of May is way more likely to go up. Don't know who said March but that was dumb of them. It may dip really hard first though after next week when people try to sell off the summit hype. But go back up in June. Nothing is guaranteed but that is my prediction. Do not sell. Consider that money gone, you got nothing to lose if you wait until late summer/fall/winter. Those are always the peak months.
I'm saying if it's the case that it's crashing 90% it's good to sell when it's only down 10%. That's just common sense.

Of course, predicting that would take some big consensus based on public news like the EU and USA banning crypto or something. 
Is that why they named a zero fee trading platform after him?
Dude, ... I was just joking.  
With all the good news on the horizon and the weekend and NY conference coming up I let my emotions take over.   I thought the line would bounce. 
Today?

I believe in BTC but I try not to get emotionally involved

Bcash was 500 euros a month later it was 1500 euros

He might be a prick but I like money
You should cut back on your soy intake. It has been proven to degrade mental ability, imbalance hormones, and cause mood swings. Sorry for your loss.
yes, true, that is what happens when you sell on the market, but you are wrong by ignoring the fact the dude in charge explicitly stated more than once that the coins will not be sold OTC, or in bulk.

So you bet nothing at all on 3k? Usually when people say "I bet" it means something. What is the point in saying anything. 
No, there are clear market indicators.
I wish I could, but they take the investmnet if it falls below 25%. Does anyone recommend an aternative Android app where I can actually buy and keep Bitcoin?
Could be a classic Marge pattern in a day or two. 
I agree the new Gemini fees are too high. It's embarrassing there isn't a cap. Greedy
Perhaps. Bitcoin is not really behaving like it did last year. So this conference can also have unexpected results. 
Well, considering what's  happening next week and how it looked last week it was more than a reasonable expectation that we were going to have a big week. Time of year, technicals and I don't even know what to call next week were all in agreement. 

I don't know what this is. It's 3 days before this conference thing which has always had a positive effect. Who'd be selling now ? This is the worst possible time and place to be dumping crypto's. 
Considering the number of people that live on a dollar a day, it's doable. It's not a good plan, but it is doable. 
I'm going to pretend the insult was unintended. I keep my expenses small and make smart decisions. Minus taxes, saving, and investing I live comfortably on around 15k a year. 
Dreaming is great, planning is better.  Having .25 BTC at that age is tremendous ... hope he keeps his foot to the pedal and turns it into 1.0 or more by the time he's 25.
Thanks!
I have not been.
No he doesnt. He means less BTC. "I'm pretty sure the market is basing everything as if there are 21mil btc anyways"

Hes talking about the supply of bitcoin. He has no idea what hes talking about.
Right, shares can produces something.
every year before this year it only went up after consensus.... do your research....
There is still the possibility of a recovery, but it‚Äôs getting slimmer and slimmer.  Sold my trading stack at 9000.  Buying back a little with each dip, but saving the bulk for when the 6hr chart crosses up again.
You are a brace of pricks then.
That's caused by my cocaine intake, dipshit. Again, do some research buddy. 
It‚Äôs George Soros shorting BTC daily now lol !
Good old Jordan.  I'm a massive fan.  He's a genius, but he does lapse into metaphysical nonsense sometimes.
Usually...

Other times, it's just an expression.

Ah - sorry.  I don't know about these tools.  I just buy.

I'm sure someone else could recommend.
Well. You can register on exchange website. Install Tab Trader. Add the API key in, remember to tick to the option that does not let the API to withdraw your fund. Bittrex.com has it. Not sure about other.

Edited : dictation. 
It's either gonna go down to 7k or shoot up to 11k were in the middle right now
r/Bitcoin ‚Äî we invest, dreaming of someday being able to live in poverty
That's the plan! Cheers 
What does a share produce?
He's right ya know!
Smart man.  Clearly you don‚Äôt let your emotions get the better of you. I‚Äôll try harder next time sensei. 
Probably 
wake up sheeple, you have been mindcontrolled with microwaves by the elite, the chemtrails are out to get you!

Thank you, I'll consider it
This conference thing is going to call it I think. Last year it was 50&#37; on the conference and 130&#37; or so after. I don't think anyone wants to risk missing that. $11.8k or so is also where the next serious resistance is. So that's perhaps where we run up to now. 
Dividends.
Well, the emotions did keep me from selling at 9900 when I knew (having seen the previous correction from 9700 down to 9000) a correction was eminent after such a rapid upswing, but I was still figuring out how the market behaves in a bullish scenario.  I still have plenty to learn, but this dip will give me a lot more bitcoin to learn with.
Set a reminder for one year.  

You can't beat this market by gambling, in the long term.

DTR, then invest in something you believe in.

If any of the sheep want to start learning ^^^ Educate yourselves! KNOWLEDGE IS POWER 
Nope - you're Cathy Newman.
In Europe we normally sell in the morning, looks like we are buying up right now
when conference? (and lambo ofc)
Well I see the lines may cross on the one day  chart in the near future. Seems like there is no choice but to exit 
I agree but while its volatile I will take my chances

Its too mundane just doing nothing
I think Europe will see it the way I do. The next few days might be very exciting. 
14th May
We could see a big jump today, and maybe the line will only touch and bounce back up.  Impossible to say at this point.
Fair enough.
