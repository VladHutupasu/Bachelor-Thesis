Who let the bulls out?!!!
[deleted]
A couple of hours of flat lining around $8500 and then another big break out to $9200 please or higher.
It feels like December again, prepare the 9000 memes!!
Well boyz, 
I’ve went from pessimistic to optimistic. I’ve held through that Mt. Gox crash right on up. Sold some and bought back at 6.5k Survived the recent free-fall and I had my finger on the button to sell all if it reached that point. It didn’t. I feel better now than I have before the November spike. I feel that we’re on a good path. Stay real and don’t get too cocky and If you do then you better own a lambo. Happy 420!
Closing in again on the "McAffee Dick Line".

Strong resistance there.
10k by the end of the month, I had a dream and I'm very attuned to the environment so it must be true 
4/20 let’s see bitcoin get high 
Is it just me or is Coinbase raising their fees in the midst of extremely high volume? As if I didn’t have enough reason to hate Coinbase/GDAX, they pull this crap raising their fees up to 3x the normal 0.25% fee to buy and sell Bitcoin at market prices on their exchange. Not to mention, lately GDAX has indicated “partially degraded service.” Is this a conspiracy by Coinbase, a sudden move to take advantage of this dire moment? I swear once I can get into Robinhood, I will never trade with Coinbase. I despise and hate everything about them. They are the new Mt. Gox.
Thanks to all who add a word or two
It enjoyable to see what everyone is saying
have a great weekend
GET HIGH AND HODL

I'm confused. According to those fucktards who predicted the end of the world within the end of the month shouldn't we at 4k by now?
Chronic & Crypto.  This ain't a game.  This is my life!
Most stoners are buying to get more weed money or bitcoin network is blazing after dank dabs - either way i thank 420 for this sexy candle
Vegeta incoming !!!
I would like to take a moment and express my deepest gratitute to all the stoned buyers.
GG lol Shorters get rekt
**Come On Bulls, show us you mean business!**
[deleted]
I just realised it's 4/20 and BTC is high AF rn compare to a few weeks ago.
Here we go bois. 8500->8720
Quick get the memes
[deleted]
GET THE MEMES OUT! VEGETA INCOMING
Why would anyone attempt to short anything when it has this type of momentum, shouldn't they all wait til the momentum tails off
We got rejected. Quick give Vegeta some magic beans!
When the pump has come 👏

And the nite is dark 👏

And the shorters 👏

Are the only commenters we'll see 👏



No I won't 👏

Be afraid 👏

No I won't 👏

Sell a BTC 👏

Just as long... 👏

As you HODL, HODL by me  👏
When Bitcoin hits the new ATH, how could one know when to sell in order to  buy back in in the pullback?
These bastard bears are not giving us an inch around 8500!  
The only thing bad about bitcoin steadily rising is that I don’t have enough of it yet.  Wish I was here   A year or more ago. 
8700!!! w00t
Its Bitcoins turn to be amazing
itshappening.gif
Time to cash out our altcoins we hoped would take off the last 4 months but never did and go back to bitcoin. Please don’t let the transaction fees skyrocket again. We can’t take that again. Hope this lightning thing works as advertised. We’ll see soon. 
Here we go boys, here's that 8800 resistance we were all expecting. Let's go bulls! We got this shit
Double pay day today my glib globs!!
over 9000
bitcoin broke the $ 8500 resistance and will continue to move up on the short-term uptrend
Bitcoin is wake and baking on 4/20. Let’s keep that high going baby!
Shorter's getting rekt.  


Where you at bears?  Where you at? 
Right now the price is above the MA50 in the daily chart. If we can manage to hold it there, and maybe finish another whole candle above, that would be a very bullish sign...
**Stay On Your Guard Bulls**
I was hoping to get to a full bitcoin before the next rally. Oh well, to the moon! 
Hopefully this steady and slow climb up atleast means we won't see any crashes. 
Lord they are pumping Bcash hard haha
Realistic market cap at the end of 2018? 

I say $700 billion full market cap. With majority of it belonging to top 5 cryptos.

I hope shitcoins get flushed soon, vitalik is right.
Anyone see an attempt at $8600 in the next 5 or so hours?
what the hell is going on
**Support The Bulls**
TO THE MOON
FOMO SEASON
Sheeeiiittt..... 12K by Sunday?
So, now I wonder if we're going to take on $9.2k this week-end. 
Everyone, take heed. Those friends/family members who acted like complete jackasses and crowed to you about how they didn't lose money by avoiding le ponzi scheme Bitcorn? They're back. And they'll be asking you for advice on how to make easy money for that new car or house!  

That being said, I'm not pouring anymore new fiat into Bitcoin until we get the next rejection. I'm not sure whether we'll pass prior ATHs. We have many who bought at the top and didn't sell, so we may see a dump-off before the next run-up. 
btc 20k! Moon soon, then lambo
IT'S OVER 9000
Don't worry people - that was unsustainable and driven by some mindless altcoin trading.

For example: Bitcoin Gold up 50% in 7 days? - completely absurd.

Steady climb is better.  But 9k is still possible this weekend.

Good for Bitcoin :)
**Support The Bulls**
Do we have a bart pattern forming here?
Just bought 0.1 of a Bitcoin a few hours ago, and low and behold the price jumped up shortly afterwards.

I didn't realize just how much sway I have over the crypto market.
new day boies
How about some of those shitcoins gains flow into btc pls?
Lets have a really positive end to April and then kick on over the next few months.
pump it up!pump it up!
Where is https://www.reddit.com/user/stokelycalm when you need a good laugh?
Can the Americans do something already....been 3 hours since that last move. Enough time for breakfast, coffee and a poop. 

So lets get back to the machines and hammer it. 
**Come On America** 
All the experts who are good at reading the charts, how's it looking? When's the next resistance point? Should I buy more btc now or wait a little?
On here I see just about everyone looks at the charts and the index’s and stuff like that more than anything it sounds like. I look at the book more than anything when trading and I day trade, usually like 2-4 buys and sells a day and I usually always take a profit even if only a couple of dollars or I sell/buy neutral to be on the safe side if I don’t feel comfortable with predicting which way the market is gonna go. Just curious if people watch the book more, less, or about the same as the charts and RSI and trend lines and stuff? 
So, what's new.  Nice to see 8.5.  Any signs of it breaking out?
Roger and his goons and puppets are pumping bcash hard 
Prepare for the next breakout...
I live in a popular city in Sweden and I wish to get my hands on some Bitcoin stickers to raise some awareness to the general public. There are literally thousands of people walking outside my apartment everyday & I could just sneak out at night on my way to the shop and relister it whenever it gets removed. Have noticed a trezor sticker around here but that doesn't help BTC very much.

Where can I buy some?
Some interesting stats to keep an eye on and compare differences before and after any major shifts. My bet is there will be a lot more $1000 to $10000 addresses after the next run
https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html
We pumping now boys!
Pump it up babyyy
Oooh honey child!
Reason for pump? I feel if I buy now I will get burned later 
Thunnnnderrrrrr
5:00 payday on east coast. 
And this is just the start. Watch all the shitcoiners jump into btc now. Then the fomo can really kick in. 
M00n
Welp, we are above 8800.

[Doc Brown is bullish](https://imgflip.com/i/28fm7b)


I bought at 8.3k in March and HODL'd at 5.9k. Wish I bought more then! 😭 Fomo to the max.
When the alts correct, much of that dough will be coming back into BTC :)

That's approximately 1 metric-fuck tonne (= 100 shitloads) of investment.
Europe will be waking up soon. Are they going to take profits? Highly likely. Please don't though.
getting closer...
Didn't really expect $9.2k to come up this week-end
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS+
Markets work in cycles. Period.

Don't lose your faith if the correction now takes us back to  mid to late 7k as extreme correction to the recent run from 6.5k. 

If that happens and it pivots from there, it will be a good buy opportunity for traders.

For the rest of hodlers like me, anytime is a good time to buy 😁
Well, that was fun
I know I keep going on but this is a crucial period for Bitcoin, please buy as much as you can, even if it's only $10 worth.  Many thanks.  
Whooohooooo...!!
Forrest Pump
I made almost as much today with btc as my take home paycheck for work. Maybe it's time to retire and have btc be my job/hobby, or I'll just wait til I'm back in the green first(only $8,000 to go!)

Only about 8% of Americans own Crypto as of March 2018 according to CNBC. I do not know what the percentage of ownership is for the rest of the world? However, I would say we are all considered "first to the party".
Bull run officially on?
to the moon!!! 
So how big is this going to get ? 
holeee shiettt 420 greeny green green

Bart pattern averted. For now...
Massive money coming into altcoins. Not a good a sign imo
For those looking at GDAX; that sell wall at $9000 is not real. It will vanish at the very last second. Keep buying right on through it. Pretend it's not there.
We are waking up in the US and this is the first pay-check Friday after Tax day...it’s on. I did my part already. I, like many, have cut my retirement contributions in half so I can invest more in bitcoin every two weeks
What’s up with the bcash pump? Roger been stacking up btc during crash? Was hoping for bash’ death after this crash.
Who else bought bitcoin  at 16K or more and still holding
On a strictly technical level we still have not broken out of a massive wedge. However things appear a bit promising that we are headed in the direction of a breakout. It seems this idea of a fractal pattern has some merit. I have no idea why that would be so.
Just want to toot my own horn a bit here.

I called this shit perfectly all week.  See below:

The short term moving average line is about to cross the long term moving average line (upwards) on the gdax one day chart. The lines are currently touching. This usually indicates a large bump is coming. Should happen in about 3.5 hours (or at least it should start happening).

Short term moving average is getting closer and closer to crossing the long term moving average on the 1 day chart. When that happens, bitcoin might really take off.

Sell at your own peril. Next week is going to be a great week for bitcoin. Time to HODL.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ce908/daily_discussion_april_15_2018/dxfubc0/

Nice! Had an order trip after 26 days on Gdax. It pays to be patient!

should I set a close sell stop already or is this downward trend only temporary?

The reason why bitcoin isn't moving much is because everyone is buying their asses off with altcoins
6542 . Is this the breakout? Is this just fantasy?
Does anyone use Abra?
like a week ago I asked for 420$ on 4/20, 600 is even better
Anyone updated the 9k meme recently?

Be good to have Vitalik in it somewhere.
Good morning Europe! Wassup?
BTC are Back his own track . just HODL !
get your memes ready
IT'S OVER 8950!
don't be shy...
Which exchange will determine meme launch?

Quick discussion - hurry!
slowly sneaking up on 9000...
someone break out the vegeta meme
This is going to be a fight.
Good for Bitcoin..
A lot of the main coins fell back a little from the highs of earlier, hopefully we will climb back up later on today.
Mamboons rdy...
Prepare for second approach...
I'm relatively new to this, I first bought btc last January but I've been buying the dips (but not all) ever since. I'm gonna break even when the price reaches 9000. Now I've set my sell stop at 8700, is that OK or should I just hodl for now? 
**Come On Bulls, don't throw this all away!** 
and here comes the reversal, trading sideways for a bit me thinks
mum asked me to buy her 1 BTC yesterday to use as her retirement fund/pension hopefully going to see her in a lambo at 60
420 - great day to chill, buy a Lambo, and let the smoke roll out the windows like Cheech and Chong! 
3 last days looks good for crypto. Hope it lasts...
In moments like this i love crypto :D (+100$ in 2 min)
All of these 2 - 25 BTC buys are a beautiful thing to see on this Spring day!
So glad I dipped into my savings again for another $750 to put into btc yesterday.
Next stop 9900
We just got paid. First Friday without the uncertainty of knowing if we owe taxes or not. Taxes are done. Time to buy. 
5:00 on the West Coast. Payday after tax season is so good plus waiting for the refund checks which is just the FED printing $’s causing inflation. Any currency relative to the $ will increase. 
Poor shorters...
Why its always that 1hr spike always create the huge climb? Could anyine explain? 
Too the moon 🎑 
will we see it dip back to under 8000? im not done buying cheap dips yet

If you've observed a BTC crash - observe an altcoin crash within the next 7 days.

:)
Things are looking bright :) 
I think we'll easily reach 9k.

But there is silly money going into some really low quality alts. 

That can't sustain.

The question is - when that altcoin market corrects, where will the money go?  

Out - or into established coins.
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo !!!
**Europe & others, we need to hold this level atleast until the Americans wake up, many thanks.**
It makes me so happy when people talk shit about me and claim I've said certain shit and they simply can't find the evidence to back it up.

Red dongs incoming, you have been warned
Whales are now pumping to dump next weekend...
They had their time. RIP
Nah, they were warned. 
Don’t speak too soon 
I think we’ll get to 8700 within 12 hours or so 
I’ll not interfere.
BitcoinAlways... it’s not hitting $9200.. I will pay you one whole bitcoin if it hits $9200... 
Yes I'm with you on this one! 
Haha, amazing. Can't wait until I start hearing "The McAffee Dick Line" more often...
#bigiftrue
I hugged the same tree.
>  I'm very attuned to the environment

Jesus christ is here boys.
Ahahaha is that a joke? If it goes 10K, I’ll pay you 10K.
I wonder if high people are more motivated to buy bitcoins?
That’s why I always do limit orders for buying and selling unless the market is dropping or going up extremely quick and I can’t get an order In where I’m comfortable 
Arba is also a good alternative to coinbase, no fees except when you  use a credit cards and they only accept american express. I hated that coin base kept raising fees. 
Yeah I agree. Have a good weekend everybody. Thanks
Hodl ma beer
That's stress free way. 
Or do the same but Tether up
Considering the "buy high, sell low" mentality that goes on here, those folks are probably out trying to buy about now.
People who use words like “fucktards” are most certainly fucktards themselves.
I totally just DIDnt do that 🤗
All my traded ive been so baked. Current trade 22,500, from 7300. Weed aint hindering tradimg 
Shorted yesterday at 8350... doh
The Bulls aren’t even in the playoffs dude!
that could be the $10000 pizza of the future
Heh.  And you enjoy it mate :)  

Good luck :)
What kind of dinner? For $37, I’m assuming your ass is going all fancy...some place like Applebee’s and shit.
BTC’s taking part in the festivities. 
Gambling.
I think some people are forced to sell. Like miners covering costs. Not shorting as such. Obviously this is the best price of the day so those people will take it. 
*senzu
Always spitting the vibes
That’s gold jerry. Gold! 
You can look at the relative strength index. If its like 80 or 90, we're probably topping

Secondly you can add a stop loss to guarantee profits. When its quite high, set a stop loss like 500 below current price (or use the average true range) and keep moving it up as the price increases. You can get close to the top this way.

But theres no guarenteed way to sell the top and buy the bottom. Just either hodl for years or add stop losses when you have good profits. Don't be too greedy or else you'll probably ride it all the way down again
If anyone knew that they would control the world.
But the tech!!! It's not about the money
You spoke too soon, they're off for a shit somewhere.  Possibly the woods.
Better than being stuck at 8250 for days
Well, that's exactly why I'm grateful for this. I watched it climb and didn't have a single cent invested. I recently went all in during the dip, now I have a second chance
Someone will be saying the exact same thing next year 
8900

Textbook retrace...should get a boost overnight...9420 sound good!!!
i think the wallas down on 8800 we hit close to 9k and it hit a wall
I don't understand who's selling in a moment like this, after all alts went up 25-50% in the last few days...
under 9000
I will close half my position at 8.85k and the other half at 9.25k. If it goes there, you win. I won't get rekt, I will take 3% loss.
On point. If bots let it happen.
I doubt that. There will be lots of crashes in the future. They will only stop when really big players enter the market who have an interest in stable prices.

I believe that this will happen someday. But not anytime soon.
Look.  

Bitcoin Diamond - which I'm not even sure is tradeable (tell me?)

...and I couldn't even sweep from my BTC wallet.

That is up 63% against 49% for Btrash over 7 days.

Make no mistake, these are impressive figures - but an unknown shitcoin outpacing a known shitcoin?

Strange times.



1T will be huge and some dick will be safe.
Only 700 billion???? Man we were at 800+ billion in January.  Over 1 Trillion easy.  Book it.
there you go
I see it possibly happening within the next five minutes.
I clicked "Buy" button. Had a couple of bucks laying around
Vote Bull Moose Party 
Maybe 9000 sunday 
I wonder if I can make a profit... Bought at 8865. Hopefully it won't be down when I wake up. 
The people who didn't sell are more likely to hold around ath because they don't panic sell, at least their actions would lead you to believe that. They'll be one of the 1st to sell though once they see btc start heading down as they likely learned from their "mistake"
I prefer a Moon.Lambo
Well it was fun
Where?  Not confirmed.
An inverse marge simpson seems to be forming here.
Bart pattern confirmed. Bullish if 5 hear spike or more. Bearish otherwise. 100% accurate TA.
Please never sell that.
Give us a heads up next time you pump will ya?
/u/stokelycalm
Right here. What do you want? You don’t get the last laugh. I do! Promise that.
we had to go shoot our guns relax
Don't tell us what to do
The averages have to come up first.
brb, bombing Syria
Buy now, then wait a little and buy more.

This guys sees the possibility of sub 5k prices.

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/fGzyeAjQ-RONALDO-Will-Now-Tell-You-What-BITCOIN-Will-Do-Are-You-Ready/

It might happen, it might not. If you buy a little now and it goes down after, you can still buy a little more to average your price.

If you don't buy now, and it goes only up, you would have missed out on this cheap price.
SMOKE DABS AND HODL
I am prepared for a drop below 7k in the next two weeks. But that's me. I can be wrong. I consider to be proven wrong if price reaches 9.25k.
I'm not no expert but I'm sure according to my knowledge the two key resistance points are 8500 which we broke but will we maintain well time will tell and 10000 dollar will show some resistance ... but hey what do I know I'm still waiting for it to moon I'm just going off the so called crypto experts on YouTube  sat in there bedroom experts hahahaha waiting to move out of there moms house n straight into there LamBo...
I'm not an expert, but my opinion is that we must wait for couple of hours, it  looks more like false break on 4h  to me and RSI is slightly in overbought area.  
Still waddling in the channel between the 8905 high on 3/23 and the 6603 low on 4/6, though obviously more towards the high than the low. The 90-day moving average is still higher, at 9103. Even if it just keeps moving sideways a little while longer then it will get out of the downward trend, but it still needs to break out of the last high of 8905 to be considered anything like a true bull market, even a short-term one. A key to watch for here is whether volumes pick up -- the latest rise has been on relatively light volumes.
The book only covers one exchange, and it is rigged by whales who put in orders to manipulate expectations.

If you rely on that you will be played.
Nope. It might take a while for the moving averages to catch up...
In a couple of days
Possibly not.  See my post below: all sorts of shitcoins are enjoying a day in the sun: Bitcoin Diamond up 69% on the week for example.

Now make sense of that!
In 3...2...1...2...4...1...3...7...2...
BTC is the world's leading cryptocurrency.  It doesn't need stickers.  So don't worry :)
I think it’s a great idea. I don’t know where to get them though

Don't abuse the meme  :)
Good comment. I guessed about the same turn point as you - but I couldn't resist selling a bit in the range 6,400 to 6450 (in GBP). Now buying back into the dip .... About 1 Bitcoin re-bought so far!
Hm, and here I always thought that markets work in triangles...
Cycles?  Are you kidding?  

Wow.  

Your guesstimate of a correction is severely overestimated.  Period.


I bought some more right now at 8499, I buy a little every Friday on payday :)
Just bought $750 worth, so I got 75 people covered
In light of this post I just bought 200 bucks worth of bitcoin.  Sorry, can’t afford any more right now.   
That's really crappy advice.

Upside down Mr. Burns 137° inverse pattern coming up
Now it is just a bort pattern
No.  You can look at this several ways.

It shows a huge and quite recent interest in cryptocurrencies.

Some coins that, frankly, are shitcoins are showing massive gains - these gains are unsustainable.

(Bitcoin Gold and Diamond FFS!!)

It will be good overall IMO.  Money injected into the space - they will soon learn.
I'm going to pretend it is the 9k meme - updated with Vitalik calling out Faketoshi.
Did you guys see that on GDAX?!?!? LOLOLOL!!!!! That $9000 200BTC buy wall just got nuked as the buys went right on through. Good job, guys!!!!
great advice ! lol
Today is also my payday, I usually put in $750 every paycheck but for past 2 pay periods I've been just dipping into my savings to get ahead of everyone else and using the $750 from my paycheck to replenish my savings.
Nice. 
Why does everyone want bcash dead? They are both good. 
I bet the number is way higher than we imagine, plus many people buy small amounts every day/week/month
My crappy exchange lagged at the time (somehow it ignored my set price) and bought huge chunk @ ATH. messed up my average cost.  I was 50%~ down  manage  to Decrease the loss by selling/buying  in some extent. Then my family member lost his job. I sold  my coins  just before the last "dip" to 6k 

Was planning in re buying sometime in the future but had to stay away from the charts for a couple of days for health and other reasons .. then boom 12th spike happened. Now I got my paycheck and re bought some. Hoping it will reach the price I need to cover my losses at-least. But with my luck I think it will dump again :| 
I bought the dip at 16k.
Hope you were buying more on the way down to avoid having to get all the way back to 16k before you’re in the green.  Dollar cost averaging is your friend if you’re not day trading.
Toot it up baby!
Want me to suck you off?
Dunno. You under called it. Please try  harder :) :)
What downward trend? These kids..


Every comment you posted so far just screams anxiety. Just sell your coins if you're too scared to invest.
Just hodl and don’t touch your coins for 3 years. Don’t forget to thank me later 
Are you looking at 1 minute candles? If so, don't do that. 5 minutes is good for live action trading. and then the other times are good for shitty TA that people post here when they think they have it all figured out. 
Wtf ? 5555
if you look at the lower charts 1m, 5m, 15m, there will always be ups and downs of people day trading. look at the 6h or 1d for "trends"
You only come back for the down votes :)
Look who's back!
A theory developed in the 1930's, and finalised in 1946.  

A long time ago.  And widely discredited as pareidolia.

Applying it to the vagaries of the crypto-market is doubly stupid.

Get up to date.
Your TAs have always been the shittiest. Do you even want crypto to succeed? Or should it just Disappear?
LOL

No shit mate.  My grandma just sold her protected home, went full in for Tron, and is living in a trashcan until it moons.
Caught in a landslide..
Bonjour!!

Hyvää huomenta !!!

Buongiorno !

Fuck off, you woke me up.


Everything looking green

Nah, it's pretty standard, lots of people will have put sells to trigger around 9k, might just take a few stabs to clear them all out. The buying is much higher volume than selling right now, which is a good sign.

If you need money, break even and sell some or all 

If you believe and don't need money urgently, don't waste you four months for nothing.... So hodl.

Your call...
You just sold your coins at a loss...

If it doesn't move up again next hour or two, think you are right. Dunno what volumes are like, but seems to be quite volatile in a narrow range atm.
I hope that's true!
They are relatively poor now ha 
this is a great time to short. U think this will last, you must have short-term memory
Because traders are using leverage
And lots of bots are monitoring movements to get in/out of leveraged positions. When you see these sharp spikes it’s because there’s a relatively small amount of traders all using leverage.
A single party buys a fuck-ton. Then people see that and FOMO out.
You mean, Too the Mon.
Dude you had like a whole month for this
Some TAs are still very bearish. They predict 5k soon. It's a possibility.

With Bitcoin everything is possible.
same boat mate :( 
Yes, this rally is soooooo fake!
look its this guy! the no coiner, salty as fuck hahaha
A DUURRRRRRRR
HAHAHAHA 
I’m ecstatic right now, but I know it’s way too soon to start celebrating anything lol 
[deleted]
Well I admire your tenacity...
Who cares.
The only use for tether is to park your money when you suspect the price of Crypto is going to go down. (And avoiding taxes).
To many use Tether. But I guess everything is fine untill shit hits the fan. And what do you mean with crypto stable coins? 
*resistance
Some people are easy to make happy.

It's a free market - if people want to take short positions, that's cool.

It is very risky though - but a risk they take.

As long as people are being honest, I have no problem.
what are you talking man? get some help
Nice try, shitheel. You're getting rekt.
Not that time.

BLAZE IT UP MY DOOZzzzz!!!!

Thanks  that was the answer I was hoping for :)
Hopefully they stay there for a few years.
Nice. Yeah I’m all in and then some. Problem is I just didn’t have a lot of cash to invest. 
Swing traders most likely. 
Two groups - (a) people who bought below 8.8k and (b) short sellers.
Very close to 9000
You have posted

> There is a case for $3k.

Change of mind?

Yeah I think I am being too optimistic to think there won't be naymore crashes but I can hope. 
I hope it takes a while, so us smaller fish can benefit from it 
Yeah i saw Btcd was worth 0$ then suddenly 4$ like wtf. 
Yep I had a feeling :)
Yeah it looks like it could happen soon.
Relax, we're on our way to go take out $20k. Question is just how long will it take. Couple of hurdles in the way which might cause delays. Notably $9.2k and $12k. Once $12k goes $20k will come up very quickly. 
15 dollars off on Bitstamp.

I don't want to be responsible for the fallout it would cause.
Just bought another 0.1 Bitcoin. Now over 9K.

Well can you please explain to me, last time I was in Merrica I ended up at some sort of outdoors store. The sold camo long johns. 

Can you please explain to me why Americans need to run around in the underwear without being seen in the bush ?

What exactly are you preparing for ? Do the rest of us need to know ? 
I have oil, come liberate me....
Pull down your pants and look at average. 
That made me chuckle
Not no expert ? So you are an expert.....
I watch it basically all day except when things come up and I can’t, but so far I’ve been pretty fortunate either way no matter what the strategy of any trader we all get bent over from time to time unless you’re a true HODLer 

Just gotta have more positive trades than negative at the end of the day, tbh I’m really just in it for the rush anyways any money gained is a plus and any money lost can be made again. I’m not rich and don’t ever intend to be 
Could you possibly explain what that means. Sorry to be a n00b

Tell me

What do you mean? Is this a good time to buy?
I know.
Agreed, my view is that after this correction, wave 3 will commence which for sure is the most productive for trading generally. 
I wish I am wrong but always keep the possibilities in mind mate. What goes up comes down.

Parabola's don't happen every day. They are rare. 70 percent of the time, markets are in correction. 
Nice one. 
Good work. 
Cool. 
Yeah at least buy $20. $10 is only enough for two-three lambos max.
Why?
Don't trust any coin that isn't Bitcoin.
Fedora tipped'
That's the spirit boi 👏haterz (and sodlerz) gonna hate
That's a very advanced pattern. Are you sure you can handle it?
Hahaha. It's so interesting how different patterns come in and out of vogue. Cup and handle was all the rage for a while, then head and shoulders, now everything is a Bart. Just today, I learned about the Mr. Burns 137°.
New investors wouldn't buy altcoins. 

We are seeing all the old investors jump back into the market.
Wow. And here I am with $100 in lol. How much do you have invested total?
Like others have said, if they just got on and did their own thing not many people would have a problem with it, but saying it's the real Bitcoin is just bang out of order!
Because their business practices have been shady as fuck trying to convince the world they are the "real" bitcoin. 
no btrash tried to masquerade as bitcoin its like a phishing ploy, not cool. Nobody should support.
Smart man
Any time is a good time to buy BTC. #mcafee
I’ll have to check with the wife on that 
Well I predicted 8700+ by Friday night as well. Most people waaaaaay under called it. 
too*
I know, but I'm not selling. I'll just cut back on coffee...and meth. lol

Drink your coffee. 
Are you a shorter?
my sell order order has been triggered already, I'll buy back at 8500 if it goes that low. I may have sold too soon 😫
yeah, I thought it was time for a correction and I didn't wanna ride it all the way back down to 8300. That was dumb 😥😂
it is :)
Shorting now is like catching a falling knife in reverse.
Is a fuck-ton like a metric tonne, or considerably larger?
People got too greedy on their shorts
youre telling me, im kicking myself for selling and not stocking up when it was at 6500
It's also a possibility it could go to zero. It's also a possibility it will go to 200,000. True no one knows. But the 6.4k barrier has been pretty solid. Unless some seriously bad news hits for bitcoin I doubt it will fall below that. Buy yep everyone's guess is just that. 
Found the shorter!
Already told you the amount I have lol. And you still haven't proven me wrong. I'm waiting.
See? You get it.
HAHAHAHA
'tis a good night to eat, drink, and be merry.  high 8's is an accomplishment worth celebrating considering how far back we've come.
Yeah. Everyone gets way too excited way too quickly. None of this means anything until it breaks and holds above 11.5k.
I'm not.
He must be new. If he is looking at gdax for market mover prediction he is oober noob. 
> *resistance

is futile
Yup.
...what?
Spot on.
investors jump into it
His entire comment history is about spamming pump and dump. Doubt this dude has any idea whats going on. Honestly, crypto's are better off without people like this.
Which is honestly a lot better than crazy spikes. I mean even at a stable 20$ increase a day that's a 7k increase a year. 
On acid? I remember that I saw the whole potential of Bitcoin while tripping, which motivated me to hold and buy more...
Thought the whole thing was a bull trap again
[deleted]
no prob

here's chart with some of those indicators on it https://www.tradingview.com/chart/TS9ZkVSd/
I’m hindsight you’ll always wish you put in more
That was nearly a month ago. 
When I said it, yes, the case was there. I'm not sure where this is going. Hopefully this is a sustainable trend.
I guess I was 20 minutes early, but it's happening now :)
No I don't think we are on the way to 20K. But that's me. 
Also on bitfinex and binance. 
Pretty sure that would just crash the entire market and make bitcoin obsolete
oh damnit, I was gonna go long before you bought again vegita
*hes onto us*

They are used to provide a sense of extra manliness. 
I don't think you want my shitty governments form of liberation.

But if you do, you're gonna wanna apply some of that oil.
Snappy comeback, snappy comeback
You take the average of prices going back over a time-span, and it gives a general trend of price change.  Essentially, they produce smoother trend curves than all the zig-zagging up and down you see minute to minute or hour to hour.

Problem is, you can run your averages over different timescales. 
So over weeks, the MA may show a general upward trend, although over hours or days the price is crashing!


Wait for the dip. It's coming. Volume is trailing off now. The pump is done, but then I could be wrong. I would wait though.
IMHO: because we got to the resistance line going down from 20k/mid December again, and possibly already through it. It's not clear if we've broken it, but since we might have, or if not, there's a good chance we will because the support at 6-7k was very strong, so people are FOMOing in now. Because once we're clearly above the line, everyone still in Tether will be racing to get back in before everyone else.
Buy, but with half the intended amount. If it drops, you can buy again to even out the point at which you are ‘level’. Or when it skyrockets, at least you didn’t miss out!
i woke up early to cash out but don't worry ill put it back in :)
Cross fingers - and everything else ;)
You shouldn't buy (as a small guy) with the intention to move the market. We simply can't do that.
This is the stuff they don't teach you in school. You need to have at least 30 years of crypto trading experience before your mind can even fathom this pattern.
Yeah.  But short term gains.

No-one can seriously argue that investments in BTD are long term or serious.

There is some silly money sloshing around.

Bitcoin is highly volatile. Better to use stop loss orders only to prevent catastrophic crashes, otherwise just enjoy the ride.

But that's just my personal opinion as a holder.
Pics of your mum?
There’s a metric fuck-ton and an imperial fuck-ton. They are different amounts, but both are a lot.

you’re right, I’ll definitely be celebrating but I’ll just be a little skeptical is all lol (: 
Personally, nearly 3k is nothing to be celebrating over.
we don’t even know if it will hold this yet, hoping for the best but that’s been a bad strategy lately 
I know where you have money stuck at now. :D
[deleted]

Derp
Agreed. 
Bitcoin is a foreign concept to me when I'm in that state of mind. I'm more like, gotta spread love and happiness...fuck all teh monies.
Well the good news is it will probably dip enough for you to get out before it goes higher..don't get greedy with it.
[deleted]
The more important question is "Will you pledge to keep your future pizza chain pineapple free?"


I'm literally paycheck to paycheck right now to buy more coin.  This is very bizarre for me as I always had cash in the bank.
Yes, and there was not a $3K case then either.
Yep, lets hope it continues up  :)
What happened last year ? 
Yes, I fear so. I must now become, as you crypto kids say ' a hodler' for life now just in case.
Never underestimate the lubrication power of a petroleum by product. 
Way past beer o'clock in Asia and my sense of humor got the better of me. 
I'd have to add: Many traders wait for certain avarage lines to catch up after a pump, to be sure that this uptrend is "real" before they continue buying.
Thankyou kind sir. So, does it filter out anomalies in effect?
So when looking at the moving average what sort of period do you look at; the last month, the last six? What does your MA analysis say this is?

I mean I thought that Bitcoin would reach and probably beat its ATH but not until November / December this year when there would be a greater media focus.
Yeah I’ve decided to wait. Is volume the amount of money people are buying?
Great idea thanks 
I did the same and lost a little on my gainzzz, but still gained pretty well. Dips don’t seem to be happening. *knocks on wood*
If 100,000 people buy $10 worth it helps  :)
5555
That's what I'm worried about heh.
smart ass*
Not really. Look it's very simple. The idea of a 8 hour sleep is new. Literally nobody did that for most of humanity's existence. What's far more normal is 2 or 4 hour sessions. In the middle ages for example it was quite normal to go to your mates house for 00:00 drinks.

I travel a lot and used to work shifts. So time of day to me is really almost meaningless. I am where I am and I sleep when I'm tired. Simple. 

 
[deleted]
Maybe it got deleted, because I reported it for repetitive content... :P
I see.
... look up to the price and seeeee
Never a good idea to Bitcoin before coffee. 
What is that?
I think I recall from school that the metric fuck-tonne = 100 shitloads.
Objectively wrong. Screenshot below.
[There lol. ](https://i.imgur.com/Iu0rC8J.jpg)
Nope.
Dude lighten up a little.  When we were heading downwards after the early March MT. Gox dump scare, many people thought we could be headed into the abyss of 3-4k.  The fact that we only hit low 6's and painstakingly crawled back into the high 8's is remarkable.  Trend is good now, that's worth being happy about. 
I don't hope for anything. I always expect the worst so I'm never disappointed.
What?
Bitfinex.

BitMex produces even more Volume (much more), but the api information is limited.

Here you see markets by Volume.

Oh lol.
Nah, I am just of bull crap.
Haha that’s too much for me. It would play on my mind.
I’m still too overexposed in crypto though. I’m risking *a lot* more than I normally would.
But this is the opportunity of a lifetime. 
So long as I keep working I could afford to loose it.
I want that to happen as much as the next guy but this year isn’t last year, no one knows what will happen and if recent trends have signaled anything, it’s not going to go exactly the same way it went last year. I don’t think this run is going to 20k, but it’s definitely a good start and a sign of good things to come
Yes.  It could be argued that the significance of the MA's, is that people accord significance to them!

Personally, I just buy and mainly hold, and then watch the roller-coaster - sometimes happily, sometimes miserably :)
MA's are pretty simple, because people in finance are not that sophisticated (controversial!)

But let's say you take a ten day MA.  You average the price over the last ten days today, and plot it on a chart.  Tomorrow is a new day, so you average over the previous 10 days (dropping the one 11 days ago, and take a new simple average again.)

As you can imagine, this smooths out all the wiggles very nicely.

But precisely which timescale you choose, and how may periods of that chosen timescale you average over - well - that is for the (alleged) experts.  :)

Personally, being a VERY long term hodler, I like the log graph for BTC over all time (or since about 2011.)
It’s how much is being bought or sold in a span of time. 
it normally happens between morning and noon, just need to be patient
No, it doesn't.

LOL thats not even, wtf is that also you said 2.5
LMAO did you trade that badly you went from 0.25 to that? Nocoiner
I mean, when we crawled up to 11.5k and tanked to 6.6k like it's nothing? Personally, nothing to be happy about lol. I'm very critical about this market because it fluctuates way too much way too quickly.
Nothing has fundamentally changed that will make this year any different to any other Bitcoin year. I don't think it's ended one year without at least 1000% growth. Last year was 2000% before the crash. We will be at $20k by June or July. 
Thanks for the explanation, cheers!
Ok thanks 
Why not?
I do my 8 hours a day, just not in one go. Just natural to me. 
[removed]
Move to Asia. 
Noob.  I juggle with hot rising knives.
Find where I said 2.5 because if you paid attention you'd notice I said .25. It's SOME amount so I've proven you wrong three times now.

Edit: four times because you said I deleted a comment on the 16th, which I didn't.
Eh. I don't day trade. I was wrong about the amount I had. Haven't checked in a few days so my bad lol. I said "about" a certain amount lol. Shoot me. Still not a no coiner.
If the sentiment of the whole market doesn't fit the according spike, it will be corrected in no time.
It was removed, because I reported it. I will report this, as well.

...aand it's gone. :-)

https://i.imgur.com/TB27fE2.png
If 7.6 billion people buy $10 of BTC we can move the market.
I reported it too  :)
Well it's good thing that's not possible. 
And whom should they buy from? Aliens? Not to talk about the fact that I would not advice anyone to put their monthly income into bitcoin...
