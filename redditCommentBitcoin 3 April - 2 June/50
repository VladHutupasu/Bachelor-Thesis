Someone is losing a battle to keep the price below $8,000
I get the feeling that *someone* doesn't want Bitcoin to go below a certain level.

The bears are certainly trying...
the rocket show is coming!
I just bought back in. This shit is too unpredictable right now. Gonna hodl my trade stack for awhile and hope for the best.

it's consolidating. If it looks anything like what happened on Thursday, there may be a slight decline and then boom to 8,500 or just a straight shot there if we are lucky. I think everyone is just waiting for the right signal--the day candle and RSI show a turnaround at least for the next couple of days so today and tomorrow is risk-free. Pray to the coin gods you all. 
Everybody FOMO!

I would like to take a moment and thank everyone who participated in this years "Bitcoin Spring Sale".

I hope you all got some cheap coins.

Prices are returning to normal now. This was your last chance to get 1btc for less than 8k. 

But of course our regular prices are still very cheap compared to the price you'll have to pay in a few months.
above 7.5k for the weekend and its fine for the next week
Volume too low to stay above 8k. Dammit
Sentiment is very positive in this thread. Almost euphoric. When euphoric sentiment is reached, it's time to sell. Then wait for r/bitcoin to get depressive, and buy back. Bulletproof get-rich scheme.
Buy or HODL? 
Any idea why the mempool spiked to 40MB after being at 1-3MB this week?
I think there's a big move on the cards once we take out $8230, there will be all kinds of stops above that which will likely trigger any automation looking for longs.

In a thin week-end market...
ever been curious about asic pcb internals (albeit a damaged one) ? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjU--8AUfD4
Is this a good time to get out of my basement?
aah, its so boring no thrill at all... its like having coffee in the middle of a desert that too alone
 
Anyone else notice that when Bitcoin's price drops, the number of subs on this sub drops and vice versa when the price rises?
Is it time for the weekend dip?
Could do with more buying volume but atleast it's over $8k. 
Discount is over soon. Grab them while they are hot.
[deleted]
Why are people celebrating a reversal when trade volume is just free falling back to where it was last week?
bulls are really trying, but will it be enough?
I think we're very close to a break out here, very close.

Sale is finished soon. Last chance to get cheap coins.
How high do you think Bitcoin will get before people start trading it heavy for alts and another alt season begins?
Looks like a lot of people are re-investing now with the tax business nearly over.
lol I went and made food for like 2 mins. lol what. 
Slow upward movements always make me nervous.

They might look "organic" at first glance, but are often followed by a strong and fast downward correction...
I see ascending/symmetric triangle and pennant formations on every timeframe up till the daily.

Almost certain we will test the 50D MA around $8500. After that probably a correction down, $5000 is a good possibility. 

So best to get in fiat/tether up when we go up another 500, $9k area is a big resistance cluster anyway, so you're not missing the boat.

Watch out boys, another bart simpson dump is coming!
Cheap coins everyone!
Can someone tell me why it matters how much 1BTC is worth? The tech and it’s original purpose as a currency will exist at any price, so what is the reasoning behind wanting its fiat value to keep rising other than getting rich? I just can’t imagine many new users coming in at $100,000 after adoption when there’s already a Bitcoin 1% who were really just lucky enough to get in early. 

Not a no-coiner, just curious 
Aaaannnnddd once again the volume is dropping as the price range narrows. We're in another triangle and will break out either up or down. 
The sellwall at $8090 is so big. We need more volume

damn dude, wish i could say the same.  You should do it!

I hope you have enough for everyone, otherwise wait till after class.
We are up now :) 
That's me. I have a very strong will.
Same here, I bought back with my trading stack because the buying pressure is still going strong and we are trending towards 8.2k in a steady upwards climb. The market depth has shifted upwards during the last hour and the drops have been less and less severe. While we might have some sideways action for some time, the period between mid-April towards July has historically been positive, so I personally don't want to miss out on that potential opportunity.

We still need to probe the 8.2k-9k area, but it's possible that sellers catch up on the positive momentum and decide they might get a better sale price if they wait and sell at a higher price altitude, especially if we don't go below 8k-7.9k anytime soon. Still, the sell pressure over 8.2k is still relatively unknown so smaller dips at that point may happen. But considering the slow, steady climb right now, perhaps the crossing will be less eventful than I had expected.

At this point it appears to me that the new pricerange at around 8k has been tested and proven to hold, I was a bit skeptical at first after that first initial bullrun climb from sub 7k to 8k. When I zoom out at the 30 minute range, I don't want to end up on the wrong side of that slow trending climb.
weren't you asking mofos to sign a no sell until the moon pledge?
At 8.2 ... seriously?

I'm pretty undecided as I usually buy only during dips.  Furthermore, I'm still down on my stocks.

But then again, the price has been above 8k for most of this year (except last 2 weeks).

Sigh ... decision, decision ..
That was deep.
All hail Elvis...!!
You should go see a doctor. This obsession is not healthy... ;-)

If you mean that 123abc guy, I already called him out and he deleted the comment lol. 

His short was something about potential 40% gain vs 5.8% risk. I guess he took that 5.8% good and hard.

Hey westcoast. Where is your volume?
I want to believe.

Such a pointless bet tbh, there is simply no way he will follow through if he loses.
i did
Flat line + dropping volume, you sure?
That's a possibility. On the other hand there are also a lot of sellers that have waited weeks to sell at 8.2k-9k, which means that the buying pressure will need to be tested against the selling pressure and regarding this it's a bit early to forecast what happens above the 8.2k range at this point in time. If bitcoin doesn't push past 8.2k within the coming days then there is the possibility that it might revisit the 7.5k-7.8k range.

The buying pressure has been strong for the last two days since the 'great spike' from $6.8k, however, I trust a slower climb more than a sudden elevator, and while I expected a recovery the coming days and weeks, the acuteness of the angle of that rise was a surprise. As for bullish sentiments the overall confidence levels have increased dramatically; even if the price were to fall a few hundred dollars due to temporary high sell pressure, the price would likely bounce back up relatively soon, or at least stabilize and then trend upwards. I don't see sub 7k prices coming back anytime soon.

Looking at the market depth, there are some trader expectations of purchase orders at 7.5k, which may be in the wishful thinking territory at this point in time, I just wouldn't rule that possibility out completely.
Spring sale? How convenient being that it’s Spring. Will you call it a Summer Sale, Fall Sale and Winter Sale when this drought continues for the rest of the year? Or will you shut the fuck up and kill yourself? And what kind of Spring sale occurs only during the first week of February, take a few weeks break and then onward from mid-March..? Some kind of shitty Spring sale. I love how you honestly you will influence anybody to buy Bitcoin when it’s not even technically $8K at this moment. You are about as influential as a wet fart. I hope you go away forever in the next few months when you realize it’s not just a Spring sale. 
Bingo!
This is not euphoric. This is the baseline. 

When we are euphoric there are moon lambo memes all over the place.
One might suggest that a viable short-term strategy for buying and selling Bitcoin would be to determine the direction of the greatest amount of shilling, and bet the other way.
Buy *and* HODL.
SODL USD, HODL BTC.
Because the sudden increase in price caused many to want to sell or buy bitcoin and so there were a lot of transaction traffic.
Quilt season has started.
Heijin Lee says you can't paint it a breakout until after 11.8

How much btc u bet
The regular fall in weekend volume is proof-positive that trading in Bitcoin is largely being driven by professional 9:30a-4:00p traders, i.e., those trading for whales against those trading for other whales, and not smallish investors.
of course it is, what do you expect? trade volume increases when btc rises or drops fast. the shortsqueeze happened, btc had a big run and now things are settling down (maybe til  tax season ends?). its weekend, people are closing their positions. 

relax, it cant go up $1k every day, if it drops $500 e.g. ,trade volume will go back to 20k immediately
I don't think most people are celebrating but the situation is far more positive compared to when it was around $6900.
correct
WW3 is good for btc

Alt season is over.
yeah, it is crazy how many more buyers vs. sellers there are... Its been a while since I seen this. 
I can't believe all the people who called it was actually right. There have been so many new retards expecting to get rich in a month and then shitting themselves I forgot that there is actually some people on this sub that actually know what they're talking about.
But you're our resident buyer in charge. Why would be nervous about another fire sale?
Something, something, bullshit, something. 
Lol so much bullshit
Haha guys, I'm just giving my perspective, we've had multiple of this bumps on the way down and I got caught in one of them too. Just zoom out.

And well, at least I got this short term forecast right. Let's see how we do now.

$5k is not some random number I came up with, it's just the last round number we broke through and never retested yet, therefore I consider it strong support. It's just that I don't see $6-$7k as support anymore, IF we get down there again.
May I honestly ask what the purpose of these random speculative posts are?
What if it goes 7573?
I think not. Fact.
Was cheaper a few days ago.

To be frank, I'm kind of unnerved as BTC has been a little less predictable recently.
Quick! Fetch some!

Sold out soon.
It kind of matters because Bitcoin has limited supply, which makes it deflationary. The more demand there is, the more the price will rise. So the price could be seen as an indicator for the adoption of Bitcoin into economy.
It matters, for now, because the price of lambo is pegged to USD. Edit: And the price of bread also.
You are correct - the tech and BTC's function as a currency will work fine at any price.  Even at $10, the number in circulation will fulfil the purpose.

Most in this forum (including me) are just playing speculation and trying to make money.  Even hodlers are doing the same - hoping that some day the price will sky rocket.  All of this activity has nothing to do with what BTC is designed for - a currency.
At $100,000 new users will be forced to come in no matter if they like it or not.

$100,000 would be a sign of mass adoption and therefore most shops would prefer to receive bitcoin and in most situations it would be more convenient to pay with bitcoin.

Also, at $100,000 you still have a chance to go all in and wait for it to reach $1,000,000 and 10x your money.
>Can someone tell me why it matters how much 1BTC is worth?
>so what is the reasoning behind wanting its fiat value to keep rising other than getting rich?  

Most people are traders, and capitalism is the driver. Getting rich is what matters. Decentralization is great, but capitalism will always be the driver, while decentralization is the foundation.
The value of any currency is determined by what it can be exchanged for. The Bitcoin Bois who like to say 1 BTC= 1 BTC sound about as brilliant as someone saying $1 USD = $1 USD. 
Welp, it's going now. Press on lads.

He's just trying to offer his perception on the market guys, why does everyone have to shit on people who only try to offer insight.

Do we just want this sub to be nothing but cat memes and videos of fat people falling down stairs or something?
It's cause he sold too early and didn't hold haha 
Especially the last decade 
That makes sense and I understand the logic, thank you for actually replying btw. but also, isn’t a lower price more widely accessible and therefore good for adoption? Obviously I know you don’t have to buy a full coin, but wouldn’t the average person feel more comfortable buying a fraction of say, 8k, compared to 100k? 
I like the optimism but it's lacking in logic.

A stable price is a pre-requisite to adoption, not high price.
bullish!
Good for karma.

Back in the day - probably decades ago now - I used to use Mcafee Antivirus.  Little did I know it was run by such a wacko.

I do remember it was almost impossible to uninstall.
I'm British and I didn't even get that...
We need to break $8301 to get back on track.

https://fnordprefekt.de/
longterm 8k is still a good price. remember when it first dropped to 8k and everybody said "wow, what a good price to buy in".. and now its called fomo already cuz we come from 6.5k
Check back with me in a few hours. It better be above 8k. I’ve been losing badly trying to time this shit. 
Of course not, the "shorts" usually wait for a bubble to start bursting, and then make money riding it down, i.e., take the last dollars of the desperate investors who are doubling-down because they can't afford their losses when the bubble started to burst.
Award for dumbest comment of the day right here ^
I like Tom Lee.
Can't tell if it will hold or go back down.
I asked how much u bet
I concur
You're my favorite hodler. :)
Rather see shit memes than these stupid price predictions. Its ok to think its going down, but why the 4k-5k doom scenarios everytime? 
1btc = 100,000,000 satoshis. It’s kind of arbitrary. At some point we will value things in terms of satoshis not btc.
A rising price is a prerequisite to make something a desirable store of value. And in a world that does not have any kind of sound money any more, a store of value is something that every person on the planet desperately wants. This alone will cause mass adoption, as in: every person on earth will earn a fraction of a bitcoin, simply to store long term wealth.

Once the market is saturated, the price will not rise as violently any more and then we can start using it as a medium of exchange.
You’re probably better off for it. I just got bored hodling 100%.  
I’m also trying to accumulate more bitcoin in the process.  Not working. 😕
haha, I want to believe! Its been added, I'm gona have to actually go buy a quilt there now!
lol at the uninstall part ffs.....the struggle was real on that one!
We should get over $8500 over the next few days.
We might have another sale inbetween. But don't worry: You purchased a premium product for a very competitive price.
This isn't day trading lol
Dude, this fucking coin doesn't make any sense.
Just couldn't help myself, I don't know who this Lee dude is and I don't care what he said. 

All I'm interested in for now is $8230. That is likely to be another $1000 move and is immanent, today I hope otherwise tomorrow latest.  
WTF is Tom Lee ? 
We should find out more over the next 5-6 hours as the Americans wake up.
[deleted]
Yes.
Idk, but it was a realistic scenario. There's more to support that than 50k at the end of the year.

well that’s my point. 1BTC will always be 1BTC. why would it matter if 1BTC = 8k or 100k. If anything, wouldn’t 8k be better seeing as you would be able to buy more full coins for the same amount of fiat?
There are plenty of other assets that store value better than BTC.  A fundamental criteria to an asset being a good store of value is acceptance and consensus, not price.  Today, other than people speculating on BTC, rest of the world does not give a hoot about it other than curiosity.

The only reason for the price of BTC is based on pure speculation that someone else will pay a higher price for it.  Not because of some intrinsic value it has.
It was antivirus software that you eventually realised was infecting your computer.
Do you even use /r/Bitcoin outside of this thread?

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/search?q=tom+lee&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all
I bet 5 trx it will rise! 
Bitcoin being worth more means that the network can handle more users. If 1 Bitcoin was only worth say $10 dollars then it wouldn't be able to scale to handle the entire globe. 
Every other asset out there can be inflated in supply and is therefore a bad store of value. Bitcoin is the only asset ever known to man that has a fixed supply. It is therefore the best store of value mankind has ever known. 

You can bitch about it as much as you like - people have always naturally put their money into the best store of value that they could find and people will therefore naturally eventually put their money into bitcoin. Intrinsic value has absolutely nothing to do with this discussion.
bahahahha.......truth
Not really. I just trade me Bitcoins and do my own thing. I can read these markets, so I don't need to look for guru's and I don't really read news about Bitcoin. All just other people's opinions and I have one of my own. 
[deleted]
Come on.  Even at $10, there's $180m in circulation.  

I frankly do not think the use of BTC as a currency is anywhere near this level.  
BTC's fixed supply is artificial and anyway, there are thousands of alts out there.

If you think that intrinsic value has no impact on price, then you are just living in a make believe world. 

Anyway, peace out bro.  You can go on believing whatever you want.
Yeah, the trend is obviously up. There is no indication of drop. Maybe in the next week. So far this is a good and steady rise.  
Well this is why Bitcoin isn't worth $10 dollars a coin. $180 million is nothing when speaking in global terms. That is why it's worth a lot more right now. This mixed with speculation makes people want to be a part of it which in turn drives the price up more. Personally I don't think we think we will ever reach $1 mil coins because that is just too much. But Bitcoin absolutely has the space to grow to $25-100k a coin. 
Alts have absolutely nothing to with this discussion. We were talking about the bitcoin price here. There is only one bitcoin and there will always be only one bitcoin. All of your alts are worthless scams and will eventually drop back to a value close to or equal to zero.

Paper money has no intrinsic value. Seashells had no intrinsic value. All those forms of money that were used by primitive tribes had no intrinsic value. Intrinsic value is not a property that the medium of exchange needs to have. All it needs is 1) to be hard to acquire and hard to inflate, 2) to be easily divisible into smaller units and 3) to be easily carried around across space.
You are putting the cart before the horse.

All these speculation is causing the price to be volatile, which in turn is killing adoption as a currency.  You guys need to stop thinking you can have both.
It is a digital token, dude.  That's all it is.

Now, I'm not saying it won't rise in price but it's all speculation money.
I'm not saying Bitcoin should just go up and up.  I'd prefer a market that was steady and less volatile but this is just what happens when you have emerging technologies. Same thing happened to tech companies in the 90's. 
It's a digital token with a billion dollars in hardware investments sitting in the physical world, securing it, with further billions of dollars spent on electricity costs.

Besides, your argument is pointless. What do you think any fiat currency is? You think for the trillions of dollars that exists, there is a paper bill backing it up? Fiat money is a digital token as well.
I agree that fiat are digital tokens, generated from thin air like cryptos.  

The difference is that the world's products and services are priced based on fiat and that is what gives fiat it's value.  It's really that simple once you see pass the hype.

And if you think wasting electricity gives value to BTC, well .. you are clueless about how the economy works.
The world's products are only priced in fiat because the government forces you by law to use fiat as the legal tender.

People would NOT USE IT if they had a choice. That is the reason why bitcoin was invented in the first place. It exists outside of the reach of the government and finally gives people a choice again.
Well, the choice is only there if merchants price their goods and services in BTC (or whatever cryptos).  But they aren't, so BTC is just another glorified token.

As is, BTC's "price" is limited to the small group of speculators.

It's a nice game, I enjoy trading it.  But let's not get ahead of ourselves :)
