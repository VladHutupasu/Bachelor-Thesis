Daily Discussion, April 03, 2018 -- TITLE
The bottom was back in the first week of Feb. Onward and upward! We're just a month away from Bitcoin having been worth at least 2k for a full year. 
BTC price looking strong!
Asia better not let us down. We already did our part.
The silver lining in all this is that despite Bitcoin's price struggles Bcash has done worse.  All these months later and it is worth less than 10% of a Bitcoin.
Already have a fuck ton invested, but kind of wanna sell more apple to get another full btc. thoughts?
Im the worst investor ever
Pump them green dildos yeah
I just know as soon as I buy in it will dip again...
Good morning Asia.
People worried about calling the bottom right now:

Prepare those $9000 memes
Japan was the ones who had 55 percent of trade yesterday 
And started the up ward movement 
From what I read
If that continue to day in Japan 
Or to night in the US
It pays to be in coin
Ive only been able to put less than 50$ in. Is this pointless?
fucking bears-
Whats on the menu today ? 
Just found out about the conference Deconomy on #cryptotwitter - what an awesome speaker roster. 

If I had known about this conference beforehand I'd have gone; how do I stay abreast of leading conferences and events in the blockchain/crypto space? 
Bulls are awake
Many experts on this sub change clothes and their opinions, twice a day. 
People getting all excited for 7400k. Claiming moon etc. 

Gosh : ‚ÄúDo you even bitcoin?‚Äù
insane resistance close below 7.4k 
considering McAfee might have been paid to post his bet, do you think he‚Äôd really eat his own dick? dudes insane but idk 
Guys make sure you wear your seatbelt in case we head to the moon :). Nice to see some green in the market. Hang tight.
Welp, FOMO is happening.
Ok guys. Your last chance to get some cheap coins.
Asia please join the pump party.
[deleted]
Imagine if.. everyone just bought...and nobody sold...
I was telling a friend to buy from 2000, he waited until 19000, now he won‚Äôt talk to me. When money is involved friendships become tenuous.
$7500 done, here we go boys.
Moon time
The Bit is surging!
hang tough $7400
This little rise is a blip on the monthly chart. 
How come that xxx123abcwhatever guy never shows up when btc goes up?
My analysis is showing an [up trend towards the moon](https://imgur.com/XR7o26T)

I have been doing this for a good month now and you should trust me:

* The red line predicts the direction of the blue line (price).
* If red is above the blue, we are getting some air.

‚Üë 7459.64 $

BitCoin pls make it 7859.64 so we have all the numbers from 4 to 9 :D
Didn‚Äôt check for two days.  I like it 
And my green high will melt in a see of overnight red    Or
btc sub 4k is the only way for new and stable bull run
Rise you bastard. 
I don‚Äôt think this is a pump this time.  Growth looks organic for a change.  If we make it over 8k I feel like this thing is going to really heat up 
You have to love waking up to all that green in the morning! 
I am on such a hang. 
Expert opinion - Puke and Rally
Well played bitcoin xD $7456.89 xD but god its not 4567.89 ;)
another pump coming
Who did 10x buy?   He will piss his pants soon
its the stockmarket. ES futures tanking bigtime. 
We will learn a lot more when the Americans start waking up. 
Great, I am financially ruined again. Thanks guys. This makes me look bad in front of my family.
Great news, but for what ?
Experts say 12k end of the week.
People are starting to fomo...
Enjoying watching Bitcoin slowly tip toe away while many of people on the BitcoinMarkets thread are standing on the sideline waiting to haul in a load bitcoin, priced at either 2K or 3K.  Then again, I am a noob, what do I know?  I was all in on the 31st, so I have at least put my money where my noob mouth is :-)  See you all on the moon (or in goblintown).
Here comes 7500

Edit: Love those fake walls. 
$7500 failed at first attempt but Bitcoin will rise again the only question is when. Once we break $7800 watch it go.
I just set up a testnet lightning wallet with LND. This thing is so cool!
Are we really going to shit ourselves everytime Bitcoin drops $100 dollars now? You guys need to relax and learn to short.
This could get up to $15k very, very quickly! 
The slimeballs in the cartel are laying low because they were caught in the act by okex
Another fail at 7,5k. It looks like we entered in a slight correction which should last a few days. Anyway market is recovering and day trading was much easier to manage this Tuesday.
Wohoo first comment May the god of crypto now bless me with riches 
Bears are back from Easter holidays, they just get up
Which one is going to be gentlemen, the green line or the red line? 

http://oi65.tinypic.com/2m6sqyf.jpg

Will we see how deep the rabbit hole goes? Or bitcoin will be a shooting star leaping through the sky?
and so Asia sells.... Wtf Asia.  

That‚Äôs ok Asia. We do this without you. 
It either keeps going up or it goes to 6200 then goes up - maybe
We moon now?
Important point reaching around 7.6K. We need to break it, and stay around 8K consistently to come out of this short term bear trend.

https://ibb.co/e0Sgzx

If we go down from here, it is not a good news unfortunately folks...
Now that the dip is gone I‚Äôm glad I bought it. Haven‚Äôt seen that 10k never again guy in a while.  We‚Äôre probably heading past that in the next couple of days. Still good buying opportunity. 
I picked up the Nadex Bitcoin {weekly} trade 5cons thinking it will close above 7300 by EoW. 

[Stocktwits Screenshot of trade](https://stocktwits.com/Avede/message/118569557)
So if my small business starts accepting btc, how do I facilitate the transfer? 
Waiting for the next signal...
I am short at 7000. but I'm glad the price goes up ..... for the rest
Are we hungry for 7.5k?!

We should be able to reach it soon!
I love bitcoin. 
I just got up. Still the same price. This is not encouraging...
Looks like a lot of cartel bot sell orders the last hour
Buy on dips, sell on peaks.  Don't be a sucker. Hold until 8000+
[deleted]
any news??
**Come on Bulls, we want some good progress today!  Ideally above $7800**
Does anyone, even whales, know what's going on with the price last couple of months? 
Short term obstacles IMO if BTC breaks $7500 (so close) and clears $7800 we may have the start of a bull run. The next 12-24 hours should give us a clearer picture if we are heading back to $6-$6700k or and onwards to $8k and beyond.
What non-phone or non-battery powered device can I bring into a store, and pay for something with bitcoin? Is there a QR Code that gets scanned so I can pay for something much like a bank card or something? If we are moving toward not using bank MC/VISA bank cards, what is the Bitcoin version of a plastic card that can be used for face to face transactions today? And how do I get a plastic bitcoin card and does it work like a bank account?
Life lesson:  Don‚Äôt stand in the way of a stampede of bulls. 
I guess btc is going up now :) 
shit, price is going down...fast üò´üòì
Yay I put a prediction that will be playing between 6.5k-7.5k and in a few weeks will go to 5.5k-6.5k I need these drops to keep happening so I can buy a whole coin too! If it goes to 4k I should have one whole coin! :) and I bought some at 16k and I'm still holding that
No it's Philokane on Bitfinex just shorted a shitload.  Or some shithead who shorted early as he still hasnt figured out how to use Fib
What is the best way to but bitcoin? I only need to buy some so I can buy something with them fairly quickly, so security is not an issue. Ideally I would like to but them using PayPal and not my actual bank account. Any advice is appreciated,  I literally know nothing about all this. Thanks 
[deleted]
Trading volume is low, due to high resistance looks like bulls doesn't want to take risk, retailers start selling on top, doesn't look good option for bulls
any news??
All these bears getting raped. Maybe we need a crisis hotline? Bears are people too right?
[removed]
I was having a debate with a skeptic earlier and I got so tilted that I blanked I couldn't argue my points. What are good arguments FOR BTC and some AGAINST USD?
Do you think the trade war will benefit or hinder Bitcoin/Crypto? 
Its Bear Trap, pretending like bull trap, It will drop badly
Is there anything bitcoin news related that is causing the green spike?
Now that the bear market is over should we be getting our family/friends etc involved?
i know right great point.  this year could secretly be epic...
Interesting perspective
BTrash.
Why would you do that? Keep it diversified. Bitcoin does not give you dividends. Aapl pays you per share!!!! I just keep buying more appl with my aapl dividends. Everytime i get the payment, it rolls right back into itself, and there's a few more shares. Was it $0.63 per share in february? That's a couple more shares for me. Which means, more dividends!
Feels pretty good when people ask, "How much bitcoin do you have?"

To answer, "Not how much, how many."
Do it.
Put it all in Bitcoin.
I believe in you. :)
Happens to me all the time. Think long term and it won‚Äôt matter 
so true
average the buy so the pain is spread over two streaks of bad luck
i feel something in the air too :D :D but it will take a few days :D :D
Thanks Rob 
Put in $50 every week if you can. 
Even in a good case scenario where Bitcoin shoots back above $18k, after the fees and taxes, you're really just gonna make about $40. And that's assuming you can time it right. 

Honestly, anything that's not in the thousands, or at least close to a thousand if it's an alt coin, is probably not worth it. It's not worth the time, paperwork, and tax headache. Plus in most cases you'll have to either pay someone to help with taxes, or use the more expensive version of turbotax and even in that case it's better to pay for a little expert advice, rather than get fucked by the IRS. That might end up eating up most of your gains, if you're just dealing with small numbers.
With such a small investment, you may not have much to gain, but not much to loose either.
Knowledge is power my friend! Get it learn to use it store it and you will be way out oin front and better able to spot opportunities.
better to put it into alts
Fuck bears?
Cheese and whine probably
Eh?  That wasn't a Bitcoin conference.  That was a tiny bunch of lying BCashers being either ignored by the audience, or mauled by ETH's developer.

Did I miss some irony here?
Google alerts? 
I think you vastly overestimate some of these guys personal hygiene 
Is that your expert opinion?
When it goes from 11700 to 6500 they cry. When it goes from 6500 to 7400 they act like they won the lottery despite being so much down.
It's a start. 
Will be broken soon...
I always wonder who will cut his dick for him ? Will he cut himself ? 
Womp womp, that didn't go anywhere

Feels like it!  I wasn't expecting this much today.  
Homo?
Wakey wakey!
Don't. All scams.
Then who would they be buying it from?
in an apocalyptic world, my friend
What an effective currency that would be
Did he sell at 6k?
Just go hoot outside his home when you get your Lambo 
i was telling people not to buy at over 10k because it was clearly the blow off top time.
I was telling a friend to buy < $1000. He eventually bought at $17k.
56 btc wall to grind through to get past 7500... 

PS, what about the girls?
We might dip below it a few times before we go to 8k. Im excited to see what asia does. 
with lambo ?
Will buy the Dip when the price goes below 5,000 lol
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Loz-t9Bt9Lo
It ain't. Not yet. 
When btc is steadily rising they give the fudster goof troop the day off. 
Some getting paid to fud, some to shill..they are on the shilling accounts now creating a FOMo...
Or you can just ask for $9876.54.

they said the same about 6.5k
Problem is: Bear flags and bull traps look very organic, too. Until they break down. Let's hope this one won't break down...
You can still buy one of those old monitor that shows everything in green.
It‚Äôs green compared to 24h ago. Compare with 7 days ago and cry
Are you betting on it? ;)
i bet 100 BTC a pump will come
Who would be *bullish* enough to do that??
rule number 1:
never invest more than you are willing to lose
i look awesome, bought at 400 sold at 15k. learn to bubble, you buy when it is quiet not shooting up, see you in 2022
It's the fuck boys and trade bots bud. Stop investing so much and just wait it out. Sell when you hit your price
Which experts ?
yea
WHy would you think 7800 will make it rise like an explosion? What kind of logic is that? It will go down and up. There are no numbers to look for.
-$100: it‚Äôs all over
+$100: MOOOON
20 years from now, when your $7k is worth $9k, it will all be worth it.
How does one do a short? You have any favourite websites? 
Really?  The last guy told me it's going to go back down to $6k very quickly.

So who should I believe?
i wish
Not a fail. Some selloff was to be expected. Lots of orders triggered, it hasn‚Äôt fallen back down sharply which is a good sign. 
moar lambos!
Give me the green pill
Should be the green as long as some asswipe doesn't sell his entire change jar at the bottom again. 
It‚Äôs 6:47am here in Japan.what time do you think we wake up?üôÑ
It's 5:45 in Tokyo. I doubt that this is Asia selling.
that's funny. Crypto would not be as high as it is right now without Asia.
Asia also has weak hands that need to be stopped out before they rally.  Still in the process of establishing a Higher low.  Reassess if support at 7300 is broken
They held it up yesterday, They won't sell during a sustained rally
Go back to bed. We wakey wakey when moon.
We moon later
May be
After the first 6k I expected a 8k range month, but there was the double 11k ceiling (which caused me much fomo and much lostees). I still think a 8k range/band will be the norm for the next monthes, even though bitcoin being wilder, surges can be expected earlier.
lol
On point.
[deleted]
Can you explain the trade? What‚Äôs your break even price?
I accept BTC on my Shopify via bitpay. Not the best, but it was surprisingly easy and I doubt many of my customer base will use BTC. 
getting close...
Well, each time the price plateau and volume decline, the next thing is a crash.  

My reading is that there just isn't enough new money to push it up.  So the only time price goes up is after a crash when people buy the dip.
Holding above 7300 overnight is not good? We‚Äôre ready for the next leg up. 
Stop with the unfounded cartel bullshit.
RUBBISH!  

I'm holding till 9K.
I just saw a fast drop to $7280. Is this the day traders cashing out?
https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/16rCmCmbuWDhPjWTrpQGaU3EPdZF7MTdUk

That aint an Mt Gox address. It's Bittrex.

Im curious though, whats your source on thinking it is?
That is incorrect, and that is not a Gox wallet. Gox wallets still have same 162k BTC balance see https://www.cryptoground.com/mtgox-cold-wallet-monitor/
actual MtGox wallet (multiple addresses)  https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/wallet/MtGox-wallet
695,863 BTC moved in the last 24 hours
The best news so far - BTC survived the death cross

https://www.express.co.uk/finance/city/940608/Bitcoin-price-news-BTC-vs-USD-why-is-bitcoin-rising-today-what-is-BTC-bitcoin-price
500$ per day wouldnt be healthy tbh 
Yes, more people are selling than buying.
I predict it will either go up or down
Yea that‚Äôs how time works. 
we'll see.  Unfortunately I don't think we will be bullish until we successfully crawl out of this downward spiral we are caught in.  In order for that to convincingly happen, we need to somehow be trading above 9500 by next week.  Not holding my breath, but btc follows its own rules.
There's a few bitcoin debit cards available. They just effectively convert your bitcoin to fiat at the point of sale.  So you're still paying with fiat really.  

To actually transfer bitcoin you need to be connected to the internet, so a printed QR code won't work. 
Monaco make a card.
I always carry around a pile of 100 sat paper wallets in case my phone dies.
I always carry around a bunch of 100 sat paper wallets for cases like this.
every small pump all say: "to the moon with lambo !!"
open the eyes,btc is in downtrend from 17 dec.....
The crash continues soon :P
As typical. It's best to ignore it for a few years tbh
Anything newsworthy possibly causing price to drop quite quickly?
200$ in 30min is fast ?
you don't know what is the word "fast" in btc world....
lets all crash the market so this one dude can get a coin
This is bullshit, shorts on bitfinex are in the negative today.
Need a quick fix eh?
Get that sexy little ass on down to local Bitcoins dot com and make an account, then find a seller who is online and accepts Western Union. From there you can pay in cash and with a fake name at most grocery stores or online with their app. And don't worry about getting scammed, just look for a seller with high rating and escrow.
 Sketchy!!
I dunno about PayPal, but Bitstamp allows limited credit card purchases of bitcoin.   Coinbase is easiest to use, but they no longer allow credit cards.  They do allow debit cards. 
Sounds like you sold the bottom or you‚Äôd be happy to see some gains. 

If this breaks and holds 7.5k you‚Äôd be a fool to sell @ 8k. 
Volume is fine, stop being annoying. 
You are just the type of person the "ignore" button was made for.  Bye
You must be shorting now. Haaaaaa?!
I hate bears
**Please do not listen to this poster, troll level 10/10**
Just argue for BTC and don't bother arguing against USD.  Even if you get them to understand the flaws of USD, they likely won't care because they don't "feel" the effects.
  
Bitcoin is an arbiter of trust the likes of which we have never witnessed before.  Many people have died throughout history arriving at conditions that allow multiple parties to trust each other and Bitcoin does this on a global scale with a low barrier to entry.  The issue of trust is as old as humanity and we now have technology to solve it.
Neither.

BTC's price is artificially controlled.
Sounds like someone made a bad trade. 
Right on there ‚Äútop trader‚Äù bill. You clearly don‚Äôt understand either term
you used the wrong terms..
News have been pretty irrelevant for the price in the recent past.
You‚Äôre a bit quick to assume it‚Äôs not a bear market 
Never get anybody involved. Because if it goes down you will be their enemy for life. 
Every dollar profit that one person makes on BTC, another person has to lose a dollar. Some of the comments on here make it very clear where all those lost dollars are coming from.
Now we are on a bull run I have advised all my family and friends to drop a few k into BTC. So yes it is a great time!
And then a month or so after that, Bitcoin would have been worth at least 3k for an entire year. If we get to September without dipping below 4k, Bitcoin would have been worth at least 4k for an entire year, and so on. 7k is to 2018 what 1k was to 2017. 
Can you explain why it‚Äôs trash? I‚Äôm not saying that it isn‚Äôt I‚Äôm just genuinely curious to know what‚Äôs the problem with bcash since it‚Äôs following thinks it‚Äôs so much better then Bitcoin 
but investing isnt nearly as fun as gambling. i especially enjoyed the guys who cashed out their 401ks to buy btc at 12k, they could have at least just bought gbtc instead of paying the tax penalty.
$0.63 per share when a share costs $170... Am I supposed to be thrilled? I'd rather put it all on banker LOL 
because aapl has limited upside, when it reaches 1T its a 15% bump in price. Say it gets to a massive 1.5T in a few years, thats like a 90% jump. And by that time, btc will likely have jumped another 10x 
Haha I like it... yea my order is placed to sell. 4 digits wont be around much longer 
I agree, I'm a buyer for all bitcion under 10,000, then in December I will re-evaluate, but you have to give a stock/coin a chance to mature or fail.
this helped.
fml
The point is to hold until bitcoin kills fiat and it's the main currency and there is no need to transfer.
put that 50 dollars into something that shows promise, right before bitcoin fell from 20k usd dragon chain launched at .25 cents and then jumped up to 5 dollars almost. The correction now has it back at almost 80 cents. I'm simply giving my observations this isn't professional advice.
BEAR FUCKER.
also.
No whine today. Have had enough over the weekend. 
Classic! :-)
And for the record, I don't hold Bcash but hold a large % of my portfolio in BTC. 
They change their clothes, maybe, because they shit their pants every time bitcoin goes against their opinions ? 
My observation. 
They? You were happy when your Bitcoin went from 11700 to 6500? Or you don‚Äôt have any?
*Laughs in $3500*
Looks like its gonna pass the resistance soon. 
and how would we know if it was really *his* dick?
hell break a few ribs and then gonna eat it
Dtheyll call Lorena bobbit
If the $7500 sell wall is breaking, we might see easy rise to $7800 during the night when Asia awakes.
sapiens?
I know he bought more on the way down so hope he is hodling ;)
yes but it was a strange time, and there was still a lot of momentum. 
Two times touching $7500 high ground is a nice signal for awaking asian investors.
argh....
but first 7859.64 then 9876.54, and then 19876.54 xD
6.5k has not been able to attract new investors....
nobody wants to buy now, only wales pump and daily trading action....I love the btc and for a healthy and lasting climb I want sub 4k price


Shhhhhh, one day at a time homie
Don't jinx it!
Someone was boosting this yesterday and got lots of comments
I don't think anyone is willing to lose money.
I was willing to lose it, my wife however was not. Now I am looking bad with empty pockets.
If you sold at 15, what are you doing on this thread? 
All
Wave theory
If 9k 20 years from now has the same purchasing power I'll eat my dick^TM
Use Stop Orders. Buy low, sell when it starts to dip.
Sell a future. 
Shorting is usually done on the margin. You just sell when it starts to dip and have clear conscience of a bear market and then buy back when you're comfortable with the profits. 

Alternatively you can just gamble and short everytime you see a slight downturn and buy back in like 10$ increments and do the same for rises. 

Do that multiple times a day and with 10 plus btc and you're making more than most Americans make in their regular day jobs.
The last guy lost all his money shorting Bitcoin.
Well I hope I'm right, it's looking like we might have a genuine bull run developing right now. 
You "hope".

I'm sending thoughts and prayers your way. 

But if this is how you predict your investments, maybe don't think them out loud online and potentially influence readers of this sub reddit to make poor decisions based on your thoughts. 
The zoo 
Yeah I assumed idiots would look at a 10% increase in 1 day and sell off but it looks to be holding fairly well. HODL
üöò closest I could find for a Lambo emoji :(
Remember... All I'm Offering is The Truth Nothing More
Earlier then that. I thought you guys prided yourselves on being workaholics? 
This reply is fantastic.
tell everyone you know to buy, buy, buy, mkay?
> It‚Äôs 6:47am here in Japan.what time do you think we wake up?üôÑ

How difficult is it to buy property with btc in japan friend?


We‚Äôll see.  Just ironic that as soon as morning in Asia arrives, instant 100 point drop. 
5... 4... 3.... 3.... 3.... 3....
It‚Äôs wishing dude relax didn‚Äôt mean to piss you off.  You don‚Äôt know it could be 6k next week....

Nobody knows what they‚Äôre talking about when it comes to predictions. My comment is poking to the user who been posting ‚Äú 10k never again‚Äù in this discussion. I believe it be over 10k again but I don‚Äôt know when exactly but I have an idea and opinion. 
The platform currently has a pricing issue showing like tens of thousands profit/loss right now, but it's really max loss 890 max profit 1934. My break even would be if Bitcoin lands near 7300. 

The setup is either I trade this into the end of week above 7300 btc or lose $70-890 if it closes under 7300. 
I sell crystal specimens, mostly in a music festival setting, but I also live near silicon valley, I think my customer base might have a decent percentage of crypto users, and my father is a hodler for a few years now, I'm a more recently onto the scene but am enthusiastic and really want to incorporate it into my business. What info do I need to have ready to offer crypto payments into my current account or do I need to have a shopify to do so?
Stay away from Bitpay, they're a toxic mess promoting shitcoins and destroying user privacy.

If you do feel like moving off Bitpay would be difficult, try [BTCPay](https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver).
Yup, looking positive. Even if it drops a bit after 7.5, there have been confidence gained. Once it has been taken, it can be retaken.
You know the drill 
now approaching towards 6k again  
lol
Lol why wouldn't the elite try and control an unregulated currency?
I'm holding till end of year, give the coin a chance to run its progressions 
Traders won't cash out. They'll trade all the way down or all the way up.  Traders gonna trade.
Sure he posted same earlier today and deleted it, as I was typing same response earlier today and post disappeared before I replied pointing out error or deliberate FUD attempt.
So if it‚Äôs bittrex no reason to be concerned?
Goxers wouldn't have sold this low
But 500 drop is fine? It went down faster than its going up
$500 every day would be unhealthy but today I think it would be a very good sign.
How original. 
So, if your phone is dead, and you are at a flea market in Maine, this advanced new cutting edge currency that is going to go global, _won't work_ as good as cash?
I dont think so :) 
If only we could go and live on the moon and ignore it.
as long as it's not a new low dropping 3% is no big deal, amirite
well it's concern me every penny drop till bitcoin rich 10k,200$ drop is is huge seems like btc dumping not done yet 
Immigrant
Leave him alone. He's losing a lot of money right now. Poor guy.
because we took your lunch money ü§ë
Perfect. I was so caught up in explaining why arguing against rather than for. Thank you.
the more you use the more likely youll get some right
So basically typical bull market manipulation?
I don't want to get burned again, ATM I am very unpopular at work due to some bad timing investing advice. It was actually good investing advice however the timing was off. 

Now that we are looking at a bull market for the next few years I am wondering if I should start gathering investors for the next run.
Everyone in the world wins, as the people of the world have a currency that increases in value over time, rather than decreases, and is electronic (unlike gold) and decentralized.

this isnt true and it gets repeated far too much.   
If people value it more tomorrow than they did today, the only people who "lose" are the ones who get in late and get fewer bitcoins for their $. They did not lose actual dollars
So going by your analogy, every dollar spent on bitcoin is a loss? 
Could still be a bull trap. Careful!
as long as they're willing to hold in the long term they're probably fine, but there is no guarantee this is the start of stabilization or a new run.
i like the logic lets hope it pans out 
And then a month after that probably 300k.
I think it is mainly its following, with their toxicity, dishonest, manipulative marketing, conspiracy theories and tribal mentality which gives it a bad rep. There's nothing inherently wrong with the coin itself. Technically it's essentially Bitcoin with no Segwit, larger blocks, less adoption, 10th of the hashpower, twice the centralisation and fraction of the value.
You think that probably because he has blocked most people who speak out against bcash. 
You have your mind made up. Why ask the question?
Well sure, if you‚Äôre assuming bitcoin will increase by 10x in a few years, then bit it all in that. It‚Äôs a very risky assumption to make though. 
This all the way.
Thanks all
fuck the bulls
mmhmm
Yeah, many unanswered questions. Lets hope bitcoin stops at 999999 to avoid everyone trouble. 
Then how would he grill it ? 
I honestly wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he‚Äôd already had a few removed 
I hope like hell we do.  I still got a ways to go to start feeling clever again.
How about $12.345.678.90 in year 2031?
Ah, I see.
Didn't your Stop Order go off? Mine sold at $7200. Now I'm waiting for it to settle down so I can safely buy back in. I doubt I doubt it will go much lower than $7000. It seems to have a lot of support at that level. 
lol
You have only lost it if you cash the bitcoin out into normal currency. If it was *your* money, then it's yours to do with as you please. If it was money of you+wifey, then I hope you discussed it beforehand. 

Hope you're not in the "oh honey, I lost all our savings gambling" scenario!
laughing at newbs and of course I still hold some btc
lol
So you‚Äôre just talking crap then 
In 6 months it was STILL 6k
I agree.
Well, first I‚Äôm white, but they tend to work late here. Not early.
I found a web site selling properties in Bitcoin. 
https://coin.heyazine.com/rooms

I don‚Äôt think being a foreigner itself is a problem. The hard part is you have to be able to speak and read Japanese, or find someone to translate for you.
As a foreigner even with fiat, nearly impossible. Our place is in my wife‚Äôs name. (Japanese National) I‚Äôve never even looked into buying property with BTC to be honest, so I can‚Äôt say.
The rest of their weak hands are shaking out. Give it two hours.
[deleted]
I'm actually hoping that it will reach at least 9k to make it worth my time.
Bitcoin is global so it makes sense a lot of people\groups will try to take as much power as they can get.  But you have no proof and you are pushing your conspiracy theory as a fact.  Be honest with your wording so you don't mislead people.
  
You said "Looks like a lot of cartel bot sell orders the last hour" and there is nothing you can offer as proof to back up that statement.  "Why wouldn't they" is not evidence.
Because it's really not significant.  

It's just a digital token and the only reason for the all the attention is that it's currently in a bubble with inflated prices.
When it's crashing every month?

No thanks.  I rather cash in and buy back at next month's crash.
[deleted]
Hard to say.
It's almost certainly them moving coins from cold storage to the exchange hot wallet. So you could say its a good thing because it's a sign that a lot of people are buying.
The 500 drop wasn't good either. Any jump one way or another is bad. Slow and steady growth leads to less rubber banding. The 20k btc end of last year was waaaay too much waaaay too fast. Now we're are seeing the correction and leveling. Nothing has happened negatively for btc lately. The mass media attention we received and subsequent block size/fee fiasco kicked segwit and lightening in the ass finally and btc is healthier than ever from a tech stand point. The major negative we face now is getting the mass public to understand it won't take 60$ to transfer money anymore. 
How expected
Nope.  If you're looking for the best monetary system for flea markets in Maine I'd suggest you still carry cash at the time.  If the Maine flea market's expansion continues as I predict this very well could be the Achilles heal for BTC.
Imagine that!  You need power to make use of cutting edge technology.  
  
I haven't let a phone run out of juice in years, how hard is it to look at your phones battery status?
A flea market in Maine is probably not going to take visa either. 

Well calculated thought
no I don't think so either. Nerves related to stockmarket which WILL crash I think.
Ahah :) in 2013 I ended up unsubscribing because of anxiety. Worked out well. But I'm back. Going to keep buying crypto regularly now
You'd have to go there before...
Stop staring at the 1min charts all day
I've found myself in the same position, even after all of the information is laid out and understood, at the end of the day people in the US and elsewhere are working for (fiat)dollars and their livelihood depends on it.  It is very hard to convince someone that something they work so hard for is bad for them.
It was a huge spike and just got on and haven't done any of my block chain news research so figured I would ask reddit. I mean that's a huge bump!
>It was actually good investing advice however the timing was off.

well in that case,  I've got tons of good investment advice,  buy Apple in 1975 for example.
Dude please stop giving investment advice. Assuming we‚Äôre already in a bull market is ridiculous. Do you even zoom out? If you do you‚Äôll see it is not unlikely that we‚Äôll see another leg down to sub 6000. Give it some time, FOMO will get you burned again.
We are still technically in a bear market.  This recent pump has not given us any reason to believe that it isn't another dead cat bounce.  Stop giving investment advice because you clearly have no idea what the fuck you're talking about.

edit: see? put a sock in it and learn about trading and markets before telling people what to do with their hard earned money.
The only people who should be giving investment advice are investment experts, which I assume you're not. The situation you've found yourself in is the exact reason why.

Don't ever put yourself in a situation where your encouragement is potentially responsible for putting a friend in a financially bad state. It's not the end of the world if people you care about don't jump on the train while the tickets are cheap. You're gambling your friendship with them for money. Money is worthless compared to friendship.
>I am wondering if I should start gathering investors for the next run

No you shouldn't. Bitcoin is very risky. Everybody should decide on their own if they want to take this risk.
I wouldn‚Äôt give advice unless they ask for it, you will be blamed..
> Now that we are looking at a bull market for the next few years

Are you trolling? Or are you really just that ingenuous? You are looking at a 2 days retracement so far. Maybe the market is just running the stops. It didn't even make a double bottom with the February low.

But yeah, you might be right, just as much as you might win putting your bets on the roulette table.

> It was actually good investing advice however the timing was off

What does that even mean? I think you are trolling. The way you express your unsound certainties just feels like trolling.

[removed]
true if the people know what they are doing and saving incrementally, going in heavy during a record setting year fuels bubbles and creates volatility that decreases btc use as a currency. 
But they will eventually want to sell or spend those bitcoins won't they (or are you planning to hodl til death?). The idea that everyone can profit from btc is nonsense, that money has to come from somewhere.
Note I said dollar profit, not dollar spent.

Every dollar you spend on bitcoin is somebody else cashing out. Their profit comes from the market, ie from other investors.
Yea kinda thought we were all trolling being so sure of a bull run. I think we have a few more dips to go tbh 
Name checks out!
Still wanted some feedback from one of my favorite communities! thank you.
Anyone using bitcoin to day trade is doing it wrong. Hold for the future.
Always~
BULL SHITTER?
I can‚Äôt wait to stop looking like a fool, and move into the clever realm, to the people I have been hooting and hollering at to get some Bitcoin while it‚Äôs low
How much do you have to pay the IRS for your 2017 trades?
Top. Minds.
I'm white too! High five! 
Thanks friend :)

I'm working to fund the more difficult times down the road lol
Well damn, I'm trying to find my way to that beautiful land lol. Just gotta work it a day at a time xD
Fine, fine. It‚Äôs coming back up now. Maybe the pussy Asians went bye bye.  Hopefully only the tough Asians left. 
I don‚Äôt get how you can make a prediction that it could be 6k next week... 
Eye, but he did say "looks" as in "this is my personal observation" not factual.
Lol how naive can you get?
all crash's are not made equal, be careful my friend
I am not lying as you typed exactly the same earlier today and I also added the same wallet address to my favourites that I copied from your deleted post. YOU ARE LYING and motive must be FUD.
[deleted]
Hope so. Seems bullish 
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs why they lost interest
So, you are saying that CASH will still be more important? That is all that really matters. That Cash will still be king and untraceable.
I have an iPhone. It dies all the time, so I have to keep a battery and a bunch of wires handy. It's a big pain in the ass. 

But, I honestly believe if I didn't have to have a government issue ID on me all the time, I might consider ONE alternative form of payment, but the issue is that there isn't one that works everywhere. 

Remember the SpeedPass? Yea that didn't really catch on.

Remember Apple Pay? Yea that didn't really catch on.

Remember American Express? Some places still don't accept it. 

So really, you are stuck with VISA/MC Debit Cards or cash. I love the idea of a better currency, but trust me when I tell you it's not going to be any better than what we are using now in the United States. Cash will always rule, because it's untraceable. 
Someone will have squarepay
Buy the dips and should do well.
Might have been a short squeeze. Many traders expected the price to fall lower, now they have to cut their losses.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_squeeze
Right.. This is why I waited for the bull market to start. I do not want people to miss out on 10xing profits.

I will not be blamed as the final decision to invest is not mine to make, and I firmly tell people that I wasn't at fault if they took my advice to invest in December or January.

However this is backfiring because even though they are not blaming me, they are still resentful.
Ok, tell me how it's naive. Keep in mind that I just got nearly a perfect score in my College Macroeconomics class. Ok, it's no longer as decentralized as would be ideal. But it's more decentralized than regular currency, but less decentralized than gold (unless you count gold mining operations).
> The idea that everyone can profit from btc is nonsense     

I never said they could though, I just said that it is not necessary for some to lose money for some to profit     

>that money has to come from somewhere.       

It comes from economic growth. If I start a business which other people purchase goods from, did they *lose* money or was value *created*? 



yeah and all coins come from miners who are capitalistic entrepreneurs selling their good, btc is basically a commodity of digital scarcity. 
That's my plan entirely. Just wish I had more current earning power to stockpile. Doing the best I can though!
lol
oh youve been telling people about bitcoin for years, when it was actually kind of cheap at $500, or you have been telling people to buy as a hype bubble subsides...?
If you have enough cash it‚Äôs probably possible. Visas are really strict here, but you can likely buy your own visa if you can prove you have the cash to support yourself. I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs what Roger Ver did. 
[deleted]
Anybody can make predictions man, be easy on the guy. And it's just as likely it will be 6k next week as it is that it will be 10k next week. Bitcoin hasn't had a solid pattern of late. All the big investors are kinda just watching right now figuring out what to do. Him, like you,  like all of us Block chain lovers are excited and sometimes a little nervous of what is going on. It's only natural for us to speculate. But in the end it's important regardless of our speculation to trust and have faith in Block chain, because in the end... we all üåâMOONIN‚õºüòéüòéüòé
I appreciate that but at the same time this "cartel baddy" is being built with every submission and the OP has pushed it more than once recently and they are not alone.  At some point you have to push back on the fiction so it doesn't dictate the narrative or you will be overrun by it.
Then he would have written "Looks to me like..."
Invest accordingly.  
troll

edit: I suggest you watch some videos by Andreas Antonopoulos to get a better understanding what Bitcoin is about. Then we can have a discussion.

e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1si5ZWLgy0&list=PLPQwGV1aLnTuN6kdNWlElfr2tzigB9Nnj&index=1&t=0s
There are untraceable cryptos too and I agree that it is an important attribute.  But you are being a little unfair to this 10 year old technology by comparing to a technology that has been around for centuries.
Apple Pay has caught on. I haven‚Äôt used my physical debit card in ages. 

Also, many many places don‚Äôt accept cash. Any ecommerce vendors for example. 
**Short squeeze**

A short squeeze is a rapid increase in the price of a stock that occurs when there is a lack of supply and an excess of demand for the stock.

Short squeezes result when short sellers cover their positions on a stock, resulting in buying volume that drives the stock price up. This can occur if the price has risen to a point where short sellers must make margin calls, or more loosely if short sellers simply decide to cut their losses and get out. This may happen in an automated manner for example if the short sellers had previously placed stop-loss orders with their brokers to prepare for this possibility.

Selfishly I want it to stay low for a bit longer so I can invest big
Might of been a handful of shorts covering, but it wasn't a short squeeze.  In this market a short squeeze would be more 9k to 11k in a day
You and me both man, this is the time to invest when it's low. Sadly most will only invest when it's 15k plus and what is the point then?
Hype bubble mr. Nostradamus , one mans low is another mans high
Sweet, I know there was some news of them trying to make it easier for people to immigrate, really they just want to import tax payers to grow their influence. I just hope this influx of economic strength reverses that trend!
Probably 
Cartel is pure BS.  Totally unsubstantiated.

The truth is - BTC was created and is managed by aliens.  Their goal is to make BTC the global currency and have everyone tattoo their BTC address on their hands and forehead.

 I have watch that video. It wouldn‚Äôt matter if he said it was the most amazing thing ever. You still have to convince 300,000 business owners across the United States to take something other than cash or debit cards. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying to you. I agree that it is fundamentally better, but so is communism. The question is how fast can we adopt it? Look at Tesla cars. Clearly Tesla cars are  much better, better for the environment, safer, don‚Äôt use gas or oil. And yet the technology has been around for quite some time, and yet auto makers are still slow to adapt. I‚Äôm not saying that the bitcoin Won‚Äôt ever be popular, I am just saying it‚Äôs not going to happen in the next 5 to 7 years that there is a 99% adoption rate across the country. You might get 40% or 50% penetration, but that extra step means that my visa MasterCard bank card is still going to be better because it is 100% of the time usable
Can someone explain to me why it‚Äôs so important for currencies to be untraceable? What‚Äôs the worst case scenario for the average Joe who operates within the law?
Where are you that people dont take cash?
If you are independently wealthy, go for it!
[deleted]
> I am just saying it‚Äôs not going to happen in the next 5 to 7 years

Which is fine by me. 
Amazon mainly
Yeah, you‚Äôre getting upset by other‚Äôs opinions that don‚Äôt matter to you. 
Yea, but while that's true, I don't buy groceries on Amazon (yet), I don't buy T-shirts and clothes and toilet paper on Amazon, and I don't buy sneakers on Amazon, or tires for my car on Amazon, or oil changes on Amazon. I do buy toys on Amazon, like stuff for my TV or electronics, but in the course of a month, that's probably 10% of my monthly spend. 

Gas & Electric: $200/month doesn't take bitcoin.
Geico Car Insurance: $140/month doesn't take bitcoin
Rent: $1350/month doesn't take bitcoin
Groceries: $400/month doesn't take bitcoin
Laundromat: $40/month doesn't take bitcoin
Car Payment: $235/month doesn't take bitcoin.

I highly doubt any of these will change, even 10 years from now, as they are backed by banks and the dollar. That being said, then there is no real reason for me to use bitcoin. Hopefully some day, but I doubt it.
Yeah, I wasn‚Äôt bigging up Bitcoin or anything. I just thought I should point it out because you seemed to put more scrutiny on e.g. Amex than cash
