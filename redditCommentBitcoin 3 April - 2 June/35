Daily Discussion, April 29, 2018 -- TITLE
I feel that Bitcoin needs to shake more btc out of alt-holders before it can continue up.  As a percentage of the market, Bitcoin is 36% right now, during the peak of the alt-boom in early January, Bitcoin was 32.5%.  Still feels like many alts are overpriced.
Going to keep ramming 9400 eventually itll crack and take off
I am only 20&#37; down now and it's an amazing feeling. \(Got in November the first time we hit $10K\)
Doing that thing where the price goes flat for a while and then goes very up or very down

Get ready for the Monday morning Asian pump! Another hour or two and this thing is going to start moving.
Need help with a debate guys !!!

So in my university a debate about cryptocurrencies is going to happen next week. I'm one of the participants on the side that supports the use and existance of cryptos. I need your guys help to prepare to the debate. For example what are the arguments in favour of cryptos. Any help is welcomed ! P.S-I apologize for any errors in my english
Good morning everyone.  
Why is it, that since visa/mastercard supposedly banned crypto purchase with credit cards, so many exchanges still show it as an option to pay with credit card?

I've tried several exchanges and my credit card always gets declined, with one reason notification even saying "Do not honor." My visa debit works just fine.

These exchanges are teasing me with even having the option for CC purchases.
Someone needs to "Pump up the volume"!

Just a thought, April 17th was the last day for taxes, meaning May 8th should be the 21st day for returns. We should see some heavy action around then right?
Should you use a new address every time you receive bitcoin?
I'm exploring and learning stuff about the Lightning Network. One thing about scaling is still unclear to me: if we keep the 1MB - 2MB block size, and there's 1 million channels opened and closed on average daily, wouldn't that make opening and closing the channels relatively expensive (fee >$50) or time-consuming (2 sats/byte getting confirmed in about a month)?

When a channel is closed and settled on main chain, who pays the blockchain fees?

And how can you close a channel with dust, e.g. 105 satoshi? 
every drop is being bought back just as fast. The last week has showed us this is clearly going to keep moving up. 
Toro, Toro!üêÑ..Bull impales bullfighter in the rectum
low volume breakout, on a sunday night. Think we just need more time. It was hard to sell into that move so not too many buyers above there. We need more time before a real breakout
Yay Bitcoin! Amirite fellas wew!
**Keep going Bulls, you have our full support.**
Apparently 1 bitcoin is worth exactly $9400
Hey fellas just wanted to share this live bitcoin price analysis \+ 100&#37; free complementary portfolio tracking and balancing spreadsheet as a way of saying thank you for all the support! Link is in the stream!

More FUD on ZH .... completely untrue
People said we broke the december down trendline but everyone is drawing it from the december upper wick down but if you ignore the wick this is what you get:

https://i.imgur.com/xlKdsD3.jpg

BTC seems to be reacting to it right now and this would mean the down trend hasn't been broken yet?
Would be good if we could get to around $9500-$9600 for a few days and to hold it there before we push for $10k
Sell at 9500 buy at 9200, this shit's way too easy lol
Low volume and ascending wedge = bearish?
This price action is garbage. Will it ever break 10k? At this rate,  I could care less if it falls to 5k. It's all the same as far as I'm concerned.  Lame. 
 Morning fellas, wanted to share a portfolio tracking and balancing tool I've made for the community as a way of saying thank you!

Are people getting mugged at these bitcoin ATMs.. Wow.. All of our whales are getting mugged. Something needs to be done and quick. Esp. in 3rd world countries where they rely on these exchanges..
the are actually underpriced compared to ATH levels, btc is like 50-60% down but many alts 70-80%
The price of every crypto (including BTC) is based 100% on speculation.

So any debate on whether one coin is overpriced relative to another coin is just pure baloney.

Market capitalization is an easily-manipulable metric. Not worth paying attention to.
That range is so small now a breakout will happen very shortly. A choice must be made. 
Yes I think it will break that wall. It's week end today and I think this coming week will be breaking that wall
I spent over two years down through the '14-'16 bear run. While things are obviously great relative to then now, we could easily see another multi year bear market. Be prepared to hold for years before you see a profit and you'll generally be just fine.
Sunday Sell\-Off then Monday Pump.
it's a good idea, we're coming.....
It's very cold in mid-northern Canada right now and I would very much like an invite to your barbecue.

Any chance we can organize a southern bbq event for bitcoin enthusiasts? We'll call it a conference - the Bitcoin Blockchain Quorum.  At BBQ we will explore the consensus of mustard versus vinegar base sauces and see some of the latest innovations in the realm of searing meat with Bitcoin logos.
I noticed it's Sunday Sell\-off and Monday Pump. 

I can't wait. 
This market are getting pessimistic on how btc perform in the market. But I think before this month end It will break the 9.5 walls

Decentralized, No middle man for transactions = lower fees, and instant approved verifications on transactions. 
Watch Andreas Antonopolous videos on YouTube.
Why crypto? Because we no longer need monopoly on money. Let everybody chose what they want. Money which loses 2\-3&#37; value yearly and use of them is forced by force \(army/tax/police\), or something that with time has greater value and you are not forced to use it? 
Easy way to evade taxes.
Because in some countries it's still possible.
Sometimes they charge extra for CC charges. They consider it a cash advancement.

It depends. If you have a hardware wallet like trezor or ledger you will receive a new address everytime you want someone to send you btc. In a "standard"wallet (hot wallet / paper wallet ) you would have a single public address that you'll give people that wants to send you btc. 
Yes
not necessarily, it depends how you set up your wallet
Yes. The main reason is that it protect your privacy:

As secondary (and IMO way-out) reason is security against quantum computing: https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-is-not-quantum-safe-and-how-we-can-fix-1375242150/
You don't need to close a channel after a transaction. You can keep your channels open for a long time. Even recharge them.

WhyDontYouTryIt covers refilling pretty well. There is some common wisdom that says the block size will have to be increased at some point even with layer 2 Solutions
In short, virtually nobody thinks remaining at 1mb FOREVER is a good idea. Both increased block size and second layer solutions will happen. 
Yes, yes. Undoubtedly. Certainly.

It's not going to be so easy when you do that; the price pumps to 10k and you're out of the market :)
Profit $5 after fees and tax. Congrats!
it's too easy as you say, but be careful the trap can be closed, be careful ..
Yes.  Bearish 
Sadly, yes.

Dude. Get some help. Crypto obv isnt made for you 
This is what needs to happen, a slow increase so hopefully when we start going higher it does not crash again. 
I guess you're a day trader then, Most people are grateful we are at least holding this level
We have higher highs and higher lows. It's still a nice uptrend if you zoom out a bit.

I keep sticking my finger in an electrical socket.  I've done this six times and every time I get electrocuted.  I'm left wondering if I should stop doing this.
Sorry to hear that, but this is the third time?? 
Why don‚Äôt you use an exchange for a cheaper, safer way of buying bitcoin.
Lol.  Like this legit. Police report or it didn't happen.  
So you had been robbed twice previously, let me weigh this up

You decide to go on a Saturday night with 4500 cash

No matter what city you live in anywhere in the world I would not seen carrying 4500 cash especially if I had been mugged twice previously

Monday morning maybe 

And I do not mean to insult you in any way
o_o
You really think third world shitholes have whales
That's only if you price them in USD, when you price them in terms of Bitcoin, many alts are only down less than 40% from January highs, many are at or near all-time highs.  

Virtually noone will agree with this, but Bitcoin is the medium of exchange/store of value/unit of account in this space.  When the Bitcoin dominance is low, the total number of Bitcoin that the crypto-market is worth gets higher.  

Currently the crypto-market is worth around 46 million Bitcoin at 36.6%.  When Bitcoin dominance percentage increases in this space, the number of Bitcoin that the crypto-space is worth becomes less.

Many of these alts are only 'whitepapers,' no working products, billion-dollar promises, or worse.  

I don't feel that the alt-markets are at completely irrational levels yet, though.  There aren't really any alts I would gamble my Bitcoin on right now though.

Don't get me wrong, there are some amazing projects out there.  I don't feel that any alts are actually direct competitors to Bitcoin, however.

What if you have some funds on a channel, and your device gets destroyed? Can the other side can initiate a channel close and send funds to blockchain? What if both sides have their LN device destroyed, are bitcoins lost forever?

Is it possible to backup keys or a seed words of your channel, so you can restore it on a new phone or another computer?

What if you restore your channel on a PC from backed up keys, but not delete the original channel on your phone?

Sorry, I'm just overwhelmed with the complexity and trying to understand everything. If blockchain was a GIF, Lightning looks like a 3D animation.

Zero Hedge I presume: [https://www.zerohedge.com](https://www.zerohedge.com)
your chart is linear. The standard used by traders is logarithmic since a jump from 10 to 1000 is more significant than from 1000 to 1990.

If you trade the &#37; changes count for your assets and that is what the logarithmic scale shows you.

\(It has more impact on the price since most traders use it. It has more impact on the price. linear still get used a bit but less. So usually the resistance lines are weaker. \) After all the traders form the price.

\(if you are in a short timeframe both are very close anyway.\)

and just a tip you should try to have a open mind to things you don't understand right away and not dismiss them as "wrong" from the get go. Even if you don't mean it that way it sounds dismissive and narrow minded.
Or out of the market for a few weeks.
What tax? 
Don't mind Nate, he is a well known nocoiner and troll that bought at ATH and sold on bottom. Oh well, guess it was only 50 buks anyway.
That moon school you attended - I hope you congratulated them
That charm school you attended - I hope you sued them.
But, but...you're here? Comment invalidates itself.
Hehe. You are clearly one of them. Don't proclaim to ever know another's situation. $50 investment? Try $200. Moron indeed...
I agree 100% with you.  But, it's frustrating to see gains to 9500 only to be lost back to 9100. I think we'd all like to see it break 10k and stay there.  Am I wrong? What's keep keeping it down? Just so tired of the manipulation. 
In the long run we are all dead.
looks like its going to finish the right shoulder and cross over the ema

MCbishy, good points, but some people can't purchase online for specific reasons, usually if they have banking issues. The ATMs would be convenient, though the fees are a bit outrageous. Still, that's totally shitty about getting robbed, the administrators should know how much money flies around with BTC and would be great if they were as well informed as the robbers apparently are
Thanks for response. I use all mediums to buy/sell/enjoy crypto. It's sad that we need to qualify one way as safer. I had used other ATMs no problem a few times before this, but seemingly this is always an end result that could happen. I'm finito with these things. 
THE WORD IS "LEGITIMATE"...SPEAK ENGLISH PLEASE NOT SOME GOBBLEDEGOOK !!
I think many Alts are overpriced (but not all). Remember, the coinmarketcap.com market cap amount is based on circulating supply not total supply!!!! 

For example, Ontology 112,619,658 ONT circulating, but total are 1,000,000,000 ONT. So true market cap is about $8,600,000,000. Ontology could someday be worth much more, but it's speculation on a company with no final product yet.

I'm not bashing ontology ( I might buy some), but these valuations are in the range of some established companies with profits, real estate holdings, etc.

(BTW I like Ardor because it has a working product and is cheap, though their marketing sucks)
>Virtually noone will agree with this, but Bitcoin is the medium of exchange/store of value/unit of account in this space. When the Bitcoin dominance is low, the total number of Bitcoin that the crypto-market is worth gets higher.


At least last year, but with Binance and Bitfinex adding more USD pairs this trend is about to shift now imo. In general BTC moves with the market, but the same is for tech stocks and so on
I also spent at least 2 years down after mt gox. It works out in the end though. Just hodl

*John Maynard Keynes*
This is true. But I'm quite sure Bitcoin will break out before anybody capable of adding to this thread will die. 
No, it doesn't.
Exactly. It is always the convenience of being out and spontaneously wanting to go somewhere, or to an event etc. I shouldn't get punished 20% of the time I want to use an ATM for convenience. Exchanges are fine, but they have their issues. It's not always super quick. Sometimes there are delays. Sometime they freeze accounts. Sometimes they send your information to banking companies and they shut you down. It's unfortunate now cause I'll just stick to an exchange and then what, get my account shut down for banking with crypto. There's always someone trying to rob you, sometimes it's a guy in a suit and not some dude with a fucking knife. 
Well with 4500 cash on you you'd think you wouldnt go alone. Or bring a gun, its usa right? 
K
Blows my mind that pure promises like EOS can get $16 billion valuations... while real working products struggle to get attention. There will be a big shake-out ... I just hope the quality projects will survive.

German here. We have to pay tax on capital gains, if we don't hold for at least a year.
You assume he is from the USA or any other country that has capital gains taxes. Many countries don‚Äôt have those.
Thats none of my concern.
How do you know what I have invested? And it's my fault because why? I put as much as I could afford into purchasing BTC and investing in mining equipment. 
Why are you spontaneously going to a Bitcoin ATM on a night out? And why do you keep going back if you keep getting mugged? Also, have you told the police? Holding someone up at a Bitcoin ATM is no different to holding someone up at a regular cash ATM.

Yes. Trading between coins is a taxable event.
Technical analysis = the art of seeing what you want to see
Absolutely not. In EU. Such a sad regulation in USA
Yes it is.

I don't know for all of EU (different countries have different tax laws), but in Germany for sure.

Or: https://www.btc-echo.de/kryptowaehrungen-und-steuern-was-jetzt-wichtig-wird/

"Als privates Ver√§u√üerungsgesch√§ft gilt jede Aktion, bei der man eine Kryptow√§hrung gegen etwas eintauscht. Dies kann etwa durch den Umtausch in Fiatw√§hrungen, das Traden gegen andere Kryptow√§hrungen oder das Bezahlen f√ºr Waren oder Dienstleistungen geschehen. Somit f√§llt nicht nur der Verkauf seiner Kryptow√§hrungen unter eine etwaige Steuerpflicht, sondern jede einzelne Transaktion einer Kryptow√§hrung, da auch in kleineren F√§llen Gewinnrealisierungen anfallen. Auch beim Traden oder Zahlen gilt es deshalb, auf die Ums√§tze Acht zu geben."

In short: Every transaction is a taxable event, also trading between coins. If you didn't hold the coin for at least a year (FIFO rule applies), before making a transaction with it, you have to pay tax on the value it gained between purchase and transaction.
