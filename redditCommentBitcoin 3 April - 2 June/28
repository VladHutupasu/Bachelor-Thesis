Good morning Europe. 

The dickline is holding. All is good.

The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away.
Slow day, still over 9k, a good day. 
Everyone's complaining about the dip even though it's been soaring for the last three days. Surely it's just a good time to buy more? I'm a newbie, so correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm tempted to invest more today rather than be discouraged.
Whenever bitcoin reaches a new “important” number it dumps one or two times before breaking through.

Good morning. I think its still prudent to push for SegWit adoption. Currently its around 30% so there is plenty of room to grow assuming people dont have to use the legacy format. 

Fees are not too bad right now so probably most people dont care, but there could be a surge in demand any time and at that point you will be glad if your wallet or favorite exchange support SegWit because it can save alot on fees, and the higher they get the more you save with SegWit :) So just wanted to get that off my chest. Have a nice day and happy trading or whatever it is you do :)
Okay, I can’t actually believe I’m seeing all of these fudsters right now. Do you guys just sit and wait for the moment you see a red candle to post? Zoom out and notice only a couple of weeks ago we had a $1000 drop in only the course of a day, and you’re telling me this couple hundred dollar drop is the end? 
Nice Sunday morning discount. Great dip to stock up on.
We failed to break $10k, but bulls haven't yet lost their strength. The duel's still on, you see.
Haha I hate life
each weekend higher highs. 
That was "the dip".

Upwards and onwards!

... or it's a bear flag.
10k rejected. LOL. remember a week ago when people cried that 9k was rejected. LOL
Why's everyone so doubtful? This happens all the time, and it always recovers 
Anyone know what time the SEC meeting is at today?
LOL everyone on here so quickly to turn on bitcoin. Give it to Wednesday and the hype will be back
**Keep going Bulls, everyone that loves Bitcoin really appreciates your efforts.** 
In plain simple words, anyone has a clue why this ~400us drop ? Is this a Weekend weak hands effect only ?
Weeeeeeeeeekend sale-a-ton rollerrrrrrr coasterrrrrrr 
was just about to post I think a big spike is coming. U dirty old girl you.
Damp eet
Not enough people paying 10k for one Bitcoin, that's all. 


$10,000 rejected.... 
I guess the psychological level of $10,000 is not quite ready to be broken. I see no fundamental changes in the market. I would assume that we back up and get another run and go at it. Which as much as I wanted to see it break it is probably a healthy thing going forward long term.

I will say this also. The sell back volume was not as great as one would think. Which leads me to believe that the price can and will easily resume it's upward trend.

We will see.
MORNING!!!
I think the whales were building up a momentum trap to sell off right before the SEC hearing of ICOs tomorrow. If hearing goes well it's gonna pump again really hard.
Bunch of drama queens in the comments ... Time to put on your big boy pants fellas .. Stop crying over a few hundred dollars lol
Is there a guide on how to accept Lightning payments on Woocommerce shop? (Yes, I know there are risks.)
Really hope we can stay under 10k for at least another 2 weeks (payday), I need to buy more cheap btc 
Life is good in Hodlland %)
"the price of freedom is eternal vigilance"
The good news is that all the other top cryptos still seem to be tied to bitcoin price. Bitcoin maintains its dominance.

Morning traders, back with another live analysis of BITCOIN! [https://www.twitch.tv/krowncrypto](https://www.twitch.tv/krowncrypto)
I used my Bitcoin to fund my HappiStar account to join their [Bitday Bonus](https://www.happistar.info/promos/may-bitday-bonus/)! I did not regret doing it because I was able to earn more bonuses!! 
You are correct, it hasn't recovered in the last 3 months. However, for the last 10 years bitcoin has crashed numerous times yet continues to hit new ATHs. 
guess fun is over:(
really bad time to sell now. 
Come on drop ya bastard
[deleted]
this thread has 200 replies in 20 hours. bitcoin interest ded
The bad news is that all those people that watched the price fluctuate between $9900 to $9960 for days waiting to post their $10k memes are out of luck. The good news is that you can bring back the $9k memes soon, and maybe the $8k and $7k memes too if you are lucky.
10k to dumed 9400 lol

Good morning, coming back with another live analysis of Bitcoin price action! Open discussion for anyone interested. [https://www.twitch.tv/krowncrypto](https://www.twitch.tv/krowncrypto)
But I, believe, Bitcoin, is burning to the ground,
Oh well, I guess we're gonna find out,
Let's see how far we fall,
Let's see how far we fall
Sold off all my Bitcoin now  and waiting for next move .  Can not trust these bastard whales , anytime they will bring a huge crash . Good luck .
[removed]
Oversold 
This is not looking good. How far will this fall? My bet is $8400.
[removed]
So where's your 10k? Hm?
This is brilliant 😂
Please tell me you sold when you broke even
This is a GREAT dip to buy. 
Seriously, this is so early game we’re not even worried about these 5% drops .. if you can’t handle that, you don’t deserve to ride the 20+ gains daily! 
If you think of buying in the short-term, then you would be correct to buy now statistically 
Yes good time to buy more of everything while it’s dipping. It lowers your cost average and with Consensus 2018 starting 5/14 in NY everything is going up especially the alt coins that are big sponsors of the event. BTC should take off before , during, and after this event !
ye it is called testing levels. On strong levels  trader take profit . So it is hard to break on the first try. Just normal marketmoves. 

Sure when you are in a really strong bullrun you can burst though this levels because you will have way more buy than sell pressure. but we just had a 70&#37; crash.  So every strong level should be a slow grind. \(I mean it is only slow grind for crypto market\) . People should relax more. As long as we don't make a new lower local low which would be below 9k nothing really changed. Too many people watching 15 min charts.

I agree.  Also probably a good time to set up a LN node.  Looks like LN exchanges are even starting to come online, so there's that.
[deleted]
I think this is the most wholesome Segwit post I've ever seen
I think a lot of people are just disappointed it didn't break 10k, not so much as the follow up dip.

Why are we even wasting energy typing this? Just sit back and relax.
Yep I still think we're headed past $10k. Buying now is an excellent choice.
I had a buy at 9400 I was pleased to see got picked up this AM.
Bought at 6:34am EST. Did I do good? From what I can tell It wasn’t the lowest dip (and was rising), but it seems to be just below even for the day. 
Everybody confusing this for a dip needs to realize it was a slight correction after testing $10k twice. We will hit $10k this week again, and again, until we pass it. 
I just regret I was busy with work this morning when the dip started and didn't have a Stop Order set to sell. The profits that could have been made. :\(
$19k down to $6k,and now $9300.It does not always recover.
"Always"?  

Tell that to people who bought between ATH down to $10k.
Found it - 3pm GMT.
I doubt there's any SEC meeting going on.
Hopefully buy some now and profit Wednesday
Hear, hear !
May 6th is National Lemonade Day in the USA. Everyone had to sell some of their bitcoin to buy lemonade. It happens every year.
Failure to break 10k
It dropped to support on the 6h chart.  
it failed to break 10k, there is no volume we are still in bear market with small pumps here and there, you can see this with bart charts.
I think so, yes.
Traders taking profit lots of sell orders roadway 
Yeah that must be it. Going up 1k in few days without small correction is not normal.
You do realize there are buy and sell orders you can see without lighting a flash and looking up your own ass?! 
[deleted]
BONSOIR!!!
it's today?
Source?
Anything under 100k is cheap 😎
You started by saying "good news" but then continued to say terrible news. LOLLLL 
Thank fuck all of crypto is tied to a sinking ship.
It's morning in mei gou. It's evening in zhong guo.

Good show I’m watching it right now lol ! 
Wow its nice to hear this another adaptation of bitcoin in the market
Who are you replying to?
I think it is part of the business cycle and in this part of cycle bitcoin is the star and i think bitcoin is the standard of this market
There are plenty who bought in the last month and sitting on close to 50% profit.  

Should take profit off the table and wait for the dip.  Unless of course he strongly feels this is going to break the 10k barrier.
I agree with this guy. Fair warning to everyone, don't sell or you'll get roasted. Period.
> "This is good for BitCoin"

you misspelled bitcoin.  "bitcoin" refers to the currency and "Bitcoin" refers to the protocol.
It’s a correction on the 6h chart.
Ha!Ha. You are right bro. They wait to break the 10k wall actually watching binance wall it break in a blink of an eye an then return to below 10k

awoken.
You mean "live analysis" that is completely drowned out by the EDM you have blaring over the stream? Cannot hear a word you are saying. 
Dude, turn down that music, no one can hear you!
Quit plugging your shit every day and actually discuss it here asshole. 
Ok, now we can hear you but... why do you say Bitcone, Litecone etc instead of the real names? 
Lol short it then 
Last november BTC ATH less than 9300
Same relatively new to this space but one message the more seasoned pro's keep giving me is take profits
This Paytomat spam is really getting out of hand...
Hard to say.  Crashes of a few $k within short span of a few days is relatively common.

During such crashes, BTC sliced right through every level of support without even pausing.
Lolz
I say $8,876. Then a bounce up to 9,800's.
Support is at $9k now. $9.1 maybe. 
back to 6K then 7K then probably 2.5K floor where it should be. 10K is insanity
The idiot is back lmao
Where have you been yesterday? You just make postdictions,  never predictions, and even then you manage to be wrong most of the time. I remember the time when you posted here your shorts, with stop loss and everything. All of those stop losses were taken ... 
Will you admit you're wrong once Bitcoin breaks 10k again?
I believed it'd breach 10k, but it didn't. We gotta have patience however, as we are now dealing with an organic price increase and not a hype driven one. We will moon slowly and properly.
It's still coming.  I just have weekly buys.  Increasing the amount of BTC I have.  Long term Hodlers don't care about price fluctuations cause this baby is going to the moon!
Nope. I hodl. My coins are in a hardware wallet. I don't touch them. It will rise again.

I tried daytrading with about 20% of my fund this weekend. I lost a lot (calculated in btc). I'm too stupid for that. Better hodl.
Let's not lie. We had better buying opportunities in past weeks.
To buy altcoins you mean ;)

I love to make extra 24% in a single day! Thank you bitcoin for dragging every single coin :)
Exactly this. Gotta be prepared to lose everything or we shouldn't be putting a penny near cryptos.
[deleted]
Ive prepared a Powerpoint presentation.  
Im not in a rush. But I sincerely doubt that many people know about SegWit and how it reduces fees and in that case pushing for awareness/adoption is still required.
This technology is developing and evolving. Miner's and exchanges needed to know this if they wanted to be involved. Your arguments lend themselves to the notion that the tech is evolved all that it should have to, and that is simply not the case. Of you want to be part of the infrastructure in this space then you are committing yourself to writing lines of code and exploring security vulnerabilities so that your customer doesn't have to.

Part of that is deciding if segwit and other advances are right for your company. All bitcoin tech is opt-in From the bottom up. If you are making those kinds of decisions because it's too much work though, this might be the wrong market for you to be an early adopter at the infrastructure level. HODL your token and let the real players work on making the technology ready for the masses
True. I mean, yeah I’m disappointed too, but it’s the Sunday dip. There’s always tomorrow
Likewise
I'd bet my life we're headed past $10k. Just a matter of when. Could still take a couple weeks. 
Nice!
Fluctuation is what I would call it
Well I am from the future, so your argument is invalid. Sorry. 
Lemonadecoin🤔🤣
Predictive text problem should read traders taking profit lots of sell orders today sorry !!!

Monday for the US. Not sure what time though 
Mcafee's theory.... (I tend to agree as well)
Seems like a little bit of self positive reinforcement. The voices of doubt creeping into the inner monologue. 
what is the 6th chart?
[deleted]
I really need to know as well.
Why is 10k insanity ? Market cap is still a fraction of google or Apple. 

Bitcoin needs to be valuable for the healthy growth of crypto IMO. 

Remember, we are talking about something that might be the first international digital currency. 
Yeah don't trust this bullshit, if it was this straight forward we would all be rich.
Don't feed the trolls. This retarded demon guy is a known no-coiner and troll
How much have you got, fellow long term hodler?
Bummer :(

Did you short or long?

Edit: Try not worry too much I sold at 9600k and should have sold at 9900k
I've only been in the game for about five days, so I missed those. Thankfully got in before the nice little rise though. Now just playing the long haul to try and break even.
Agreed. Although we all want rapid price growth, a slow-but-steady growth indicates this is real demand and is less likely to reverse down sharply.
Diplutation.
lmaoo someone’s cranky today 
6h
> Thank you Nazi grammar

grammar nazi.
Apple and Google produce great products and services, provide employment to hundreds of thousands of people, earn close to $150B in profits each year.

Bitcoin is a digital token which is not even used as a currency and the price is 100% speculated.  It can be $200 or it can be $2m, there is no basis.
it's just all potential at this point. there's too little current uses for it. acquiring/sending/receiving bitcoin is cumbersome for newcomers. 

once it's as simple as a bank account/credit card then sure. to the moon. 

until then there just seems like much better uses for 200K equity than 20 BTC

He comes in to post BS every time there is a slight price drop...never a peep when its going up
False lol. I'm not a no-coiner and I've proven that already.
One doesn't post such things. But regardless the amount.  When the future completely arrives we will be mesuring our wealth with something other than Fiat.  For now I believe it to be BTC.
I just traded between coins. Whenever I bought them, they lost value. I panicsold for other coins, they lost value, and so on. Lol!

Holding works much better for me.
I bought at 6.5 but it was such a little amount it didnt really matter
Whatever you think about Bitcoin in the future. Right now the Bitcoin price is 95&#37; speculation.

Real demand is when people buy Bitcoin to use it. 

Even hodl'er are just doing longterm speculation on the BTC price. 

You are right that the drop is slower since people buy on all levels were we stayed around for a while which slows down the drop and stops it more often but I would disagree that it has something to do with "real demand".

or we define real demand differently :\)
Based on?  BTC is not like a company producing profit or a commodity with real world demand or PM, which are held as national reserves.

The price is 100% based on speculation and when people stop believing in it, there is absolutely nothing to stop it from crashing to pre-2013 price ($200). 
The correction started 10 hours ago, and it's already wiped out over 48 hours of gains. What is the significance of a 6 hour chart?
I think people often confuse the value of the infrastructure with the value of the medium.

BTC as a currency will function the same whether a BTC cost $100, $1,000 or $100,000.
Also false. I've made some comments the last few days as it has risen.
You're a fool for trading bitcoin for something less trustworthy than it. Just hold and pretend the coins are not even there. A paper wallet works wonders because there will be an obstacle for you to spend them (you'll only do it when you really want to) I bought most of my coins at 5.3k and did not sell even when BTC was at 19k. Could have made money there, but chose not to sell.
The moving averages on the 6h chart are where support stands right now.  After rapid gains, eventually you’ll see a pullback to lower support level as the moving averages catch up.  Once that support level is established it can continue up again.  I had a buy set at 9400 since last Thursday, knowing it would dip again. It may even dip to 8900 on the 1h chart.  I have buys in place there too, in case it does.
More fool you, you could have sold at 15k tripled your profits and bought back in 7.5k for example

Yes I firmly believe one day it will moon but your mindset is bonkers
Why do you think that? The current price is far below the 6 hour average. 

Are you trying to day trade bitcoin? You will go broke very quickly.
If you look at gdax, you’ll see the bounce off the 26EMA on the 6h chart.  It’s below the 12EMA.  It will hang around this level or maybe drop to 9200 or even 8900 until the moving averages catch up on the 1h chart.  Once a crossover happens on the 1h chart, the upwards movement will start again.  I’m doing fine daytrading Bitcoin, thanks.
LOL. How long have you been daytrading? Do you seriously think you can beat the whales? You have no idea when the pumps are coming and when the dumps are coming. 
Actually, the pumps and dumps are quite predictable.
The pumps and dumps are timed to make money for the whales doing the pumping and dumping, not to comply with your idiotic alchemy. You will be broke within a month.
Start a blog I’ll follow
I’m starting to see certain trends myself (been in crypto for years, but never really traded a and still no dah trading). 
The pumps and dumps are timed with market indicators, ignoramus.  Just because you’re an idiot doesn’t mean everybody is.  “Whales” is a superstitious term used by people who don’t understand how day traders use market signals to buy in and sell off in mass.
What would you want to see on a blog?
>The pumps and dumps are timed with market indicators

Why do you think that? Do you understand how prices work? It's supply and demand. There is no logical reason why changes in supply and demand would follow any of the indicator patterns you are tracking. 

A large portion of the buy and sell orders are placed by bots using machine learning algorithms. These algorithms are specifically trained to maximize the return for the people that own the bots, not the clueless daytraders they are making the money from. Many of the people with the trading bots are using large amounts of money, which means they can actually move the markets, unlike you. These traders are called "whales". Anyone who denies their existance is an idiot, because it's very easy to see how much BTC they have in their wallets and when they trade since it's in the public blockchain. You can also clearly see the vertical lines in the price charts when a whale decides to move the price enough to cause margin calls for all the idiot daytraders using leverage.

Do you even understand that day trading is a zero sum game. The only way a day trader makes money is by outsmarting or outguessing other day traders. Give the extremely primitive trading strategy you are using, it's obvious you are one of the traders who is providing profits for the smarter day traders using more sophisticated algorithms and more market power.
That’s cute
FYI, a moving average crossover is literally THE indicator of a reversal in market trends from more people selling to more people buying, or from more people buying to more people selling, thus quite effective in tracking market supply and demand.  It doesn’t take a genius to see how thousands of people (or bots) following these indicators create the big jumps you see when they occur.  Once you figure out how a reversal occurring on one chart impacts the charts above and below it, the market is your bitch.
You can't say you haven't been warned. How much have you lost so far?
LOL. I understand what technical analysis is. I was explaining to you why it can't work, but you are somehow too dumb to understand. 

Do you think thousands of people and bots can play the same zero sum game and somehow all come out ahead? This is very basic math.
> THE indicator of a reversal in market trends from more people selling to more people buying, or from more people buying to more people selling

You know that there is always an equal amount being bought and sold, right? That means there is no such thing as a crossover from more buying to more selling. This is extremely basic arithmetic.
I’m well into the positive to put it lightly.
In a bull market, they share the money new buyers are putting in.  Then they sell off when new buyers stop putting money in, the price drops to entice more buyers.  It’s all very basic math.
So fucking obtuse.

It’s more people placing market buy orders vs market sell orders.  When there are more buyers at a given price than there are sellers, the price goes up and vice versa.  
In a bull market, anyone with long positions makes money, so the technical analysis is worthless at best. You can make money off of the other bagholders by selling before they do. I bought in 2016 and sold a year later when it was up 2000%. The new bagholders all got scared off during the crash, so there is no one to FOMO in enough to create a new bull market. https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=bitcoin

Since there is almost no new money coming in to bitcoin, the trading is just day traders and day trading bots playing a zero sum game with each other. You acknowledged that you are intentionally using the same indicators as the other traders, yet you somehow think you can beat them at this game? Why are you unable to answer any of my questions?
You haven’t asked an intelligent question.
LOL. Have fun losing all your money.
LOL. Have fun not understanding market movements in the slightest.
LOL. Your trolling is hilarious. I completely understand what you are trying to do, and explained why it won't work. You are trying to use incredibly primitive technical analysis in a zero sum game against machine learning algorithms with much more capital.

I do math all day every day for work, and I'm sure I've made orders of magnitude more from investing than you. You are in way over your head. 

Are you using margin? Can you post here when you lose all your money in a margin call and show up on Bitmex Rekt? https://twitter.com/bitmexrekt
LOL.  I don’t use margin and I’ve never made a losing trade, so tell me again how primitive my methods are.  Tell me more about whales, too.
This statement ...... is where you lose all credibility.

>I’ve never made a losing trade, 

LOL. How many trades have you made?
When you’re trading to guarantee profit rather than maximize it, it’s not such a difficult thing to do.
LOL. Enough to reduce my break even point by $2000/coin.
We are dealing with an unregulated market with price manipulations like wash trading and pump/dump in plain sight.  

I too trade for profits and not a hodler.  My friend, you are not the first and won't be the last to declare that the market is easy to read ... and leave humbled.
LOL, even backtesting your strategy over the last few months would easily prove it's not guaranteed.
So you haven't even broken even yet? You just claimed that you've never made a losing trade, but now you are basically admitting you lost money overall.

Any idiot that bought and held over the last year is up $8,000 per coin and anyone that sold near the peak is up $18,000 per coin. I already cashed out over 500% of my initial investment in November and another 500% in December.
Perhaps; we shall see.  My purpose in trading is to reduce my break even point, which I’ve brought down by a significant amount since starting.
LOL. I haven’t shared even the beginning of my strategy with you.
Already said I’m well into positive territory.  Can still reduce the break even price in the positive.
Also, good for you for owning through a parabolic growth curve.  Good strategizing.  
LOL. You don't need to share your strategy to backtest it. Do you even understand what backtesting is? You can backtest any strategy.
In the case of bitcoin, your break even price is the price that you paid for it plus any fees. The phrase "reduce your break even price" doesn't make any sense. Are you trying to see you have some unrealized gains and/or that you've sold some at a profit? Maybe you meant to say "cost basis" or something.

Is this your first attempt at investing. It's hard to understand what you mean when you try to use terminology you don't understand.
There was no strategy. A bunch of new baghoders like you FOMO'd in at insane valuations, so I unloaded. I didn't ask for this to turn in to a pyramid scheme, but I happily accepted the free money.

Good for you for waiting until after an inexplicable 2,000% price increase to FOMO in. Buying at the top of a massive bubble is a great financial strategy.
Yes, I’ve backtested my strategy.  
I bought after the crash.
The crash is just getting started.
We shall see
