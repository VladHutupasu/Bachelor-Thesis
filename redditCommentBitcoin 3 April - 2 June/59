Daily Discussion, April 05, 2018 -- TITLE
Woke up feeling bullish, bought 1BTC this morning.....next stop, Lambo dealership.
Wake me up inside 
How many times do we have to pump and dump up and down $200
How low will it go? We don't know! Especially John Snow. 
The India news barely affected price, because this has happened many time before with many other countries and it all amounted to nothing 
I bought at 17.5k and sold at 8.2k, AMA
Do you guys think the mods on this sub are all millionaires from Bitcoin?
This is a great perspective for those of you that haven't seen it yet:

if India can come out and say they are official banning virtual currencies and the price doesn't budge I think we are at or close to the bottom. usually something like that would cause at least a 10% dip.
These pumps are pathetic. Can’t even get to 7k anymore.  I miss the good ol’ fashion 1000k swings. At least there was more excitement. 
Yikes. 
:/
Bitcoin is going through chemical castration which is slow and painful. 
Just exited from all crypto.. 😣 from India
Hm.Sorry to let you holders but i'll sell and jump in later, tired of this and i consider it will drop further.Good luck.;(

Whats the weather forecast today, folks ?

Clear?
Tornado?
Hailstorm ?

Please feel free to add. 

Anyone know if the news from India this morning is going to affect the markets?
Anyone know if there is a .50 store in the states?...my rations are getting low
Just Tethered...exited several Alts.  See you in a few weeks guys

CNN Quest Express is covering Bitcoin’s current tanking. With  claims that bitcoin is worthless.
the spring could be springing again soon.  PAY-TIENCE
There seems to be a brickwall around 6600.

Edit: ... aaand it's gone.

How deep into the rabbit hole do we want to go?
Those GPU mining might start looking into alternative sources of income such as deep learning like https://vectordash.com/ not sure how taxation on money earned would work here though compared to crypto. I wonder how this would impact crypto prices.

Indian residents can no longer purchase cryptocurrency through their bank accounts, according to new measures adopted by the country’s central bank.

https://www.ccn.com/india-bans-banks-from-processing-cryptocurrency-purchases/
Friends I am sorry to being out the news --
India's Central Bank today barred any banks or financial institutes to offer financial services to crypto exchanges !! 

How to go about it ? I am firm believer of blockchain tech and financial freedom but when there won't be any btc to fiat conversion then the prospects will diminish in short run.

What do you suggest , how to go about it?
The one thing I don't see people mentioning here is that the current price is just a natural conclusion to a parabolic move. Bitcoin's third. 85% drop from the high is to be expected, which is at $3000. So Bitcoin is holding up well. 

Every single time it took out the previous high after such a move it was a 1000% or 2000% plus gain, so next target is actually $200 000 to $400 000 or so.  

It might take a while to get going but this is definitely where you want to be buying a wide spread of crypto's. I think the lows are in, just a question of time now before the up trend resumes...
So in this week end BTC price would drop to 6K?

I don't think so
Bloody hell!  When are we going to get some good news?  Just seems relentless at the moment, everyday there is something to put a spanner in the works.  
B-Trash down to only 5% of the relative hashrate according to fork.lol... when 51% attack?
Do what you want bitcoin! I’m not afraid anymore, you hear that? I’m not afraid anymore!
That amount of open shorts... Market about to punished them.
Back to normal or lower.

Kay Korea, take it from here!
Down 270 on that last 30 min candle .... big volume
Spanish tax authorities seeking names and bank accounts of crypto users .... FUD, sure, but not that big a FUD I think .... 
I think this is Bitcoins current pain...self inflicted of course, but I would guess there's a whole pile of very cautious people out there now. 

https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-04-05/i-just-discovered-i-owe-irs-50k-i-dont-have-because-i-traded-cryptos
A reference was posted to this earlier in this daily but I really do hope Spain seeking crypto buyer details from exchanges and bank accounts does not spook the market too much and surely how long before other EU countries follow suit https://www.coindesk.com/spains-tax-authorities-seek-crypto-user-names-bank-accounts/
So... buying the dip? Again? Getting broke..  
Who's buying in at $6k? 
Anyone have a good feeling about the summer? Like July/August, feel like with all the heat rotting peoples brains combined with the futures trading we might actually see 12k again by that time.
Seems there’s strong support in the $6K range. This type of pullback may be good for a potential trend reversal. As the fundamentals haven’t changed, and in fact are stronger every day.
Thanks to one of the worst banking systems in the world, I think we actually might be going sub 6k boys.

I'm putting my money on 5.8k but we'll see won't we?
if you are down in the dumps about your holdings watch this new video By the CNBC Crypto Trader.  Awesome interviews and of course the legendary John McAfee who is confident the total Crypto market cap will hit 1 trillion by the end of this year  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hxH-wLctig
In a bear market, every time the price falls, it becomes harder for the bears to push the price even further down. Markets hit the bottom not because of the appearance of buyers but when sellers stop selling. They peak when buyers stop buying.

We have been at this level for a week now. Maybe we will see one last convulsion of the bears. But again there is a certain point that there are too few sellers. It's starting to look like we have reached this point. The general environment at lows can be uncertain and worrying. The sentiment of many people is that everyone will sell or that the whole system will collapse. It is normally darkest just before dawn. 
Lol what a panic here. If you dont believe in Bitcoin then sell and take your shitty system paper money. 
Im not a millionaire, I thought I would be by the time I was 30 but I wasn’t even close and then I thought by the time i was 40 but by 40 i had less money than when i was 30. Maybe by my 50s idk - Michael Scott
- hodlgang
it is really starting to look like we have reached a turning point
I bought in at 10,700 a month ago and just sold it today for 6,830.  Need the money unfortunately. Owned it for less than a year obv. 

How does tax work for this?

Do I do anything besides write it off as a loss in TurboTax? Someone is trying to tell me it’s considered income because I invested and sold it all within a year. 
Anyone read this article from WIRED? "A 200-Year-Old Idea Offers a New Way to Trace Stolen Bitcoins" https://wired.trib.al/0EEDq8W. This is like an equivalent of asking people to keep track of where their cash might travel to because it might had been tainted 1000 transactions ago and the law wants those exact tainted coins from them whether they know it's tainted or not.

[deleted]
When you buy low and it gets even lower every time lol. So much for buy low sell high strategy everyone on Reddit seems to be so knowledgable about.
That was a nice dip right before bedtime, I had to check lol.
I put my buy order in on gdax for $6725. I feel like I'm yelling at my cats when they jump up on the counter as it's hovering around $6738. BITCOIN GET DOWN!!
I got verified from Gemini 4 weeks ago. Bought in at 8.8, thought the dip was at 8, bought again. Yesterday I bought at 6.8. What an emotional rollercoaster. Hopefully this pays off in the long run!
Dont worry, April 15th , we moon
Stay cool.  All will be fine.  Bcash is dying.  BTC will be 10k again shortly.

FUD has a short memory.
Could bitcoin go to a really high figure like 500k-1m? Please say yes to make me happy
what could the price of bitcoin ever raise .... Nothing.
people do not trust it anymore. trading platforms suck everyone empty and have no interest in the price rising because they have to pay everyone when they dump.
Bitcoin dies a slow death at the end
good

this hanging around 6600 is making me uncomfortable 
Welp, my feeble attempt at day trading this bitch has not been going well so far.  Already lost $600 usd, plus I got raped by fees, because I panic traded. I sodl the trading stack and will try to buy lower.  Still hodling my main stack as I think it will go up in long run.   
Escelator is going up one level again...
Price 150 lower on cmc than gdax?..never seen that

quiet day today for bitcoin
I often see traders mention strong support levels (e.g. $6.5k, $6.2k, $5.8k, ...). Where do they pull that information from? The order book on an exchange like Binance?
test
It's a bearbull market.
Well.. theres that.
So I thought that the r/bitcoin april fools joke was real until now...
I recently reinvested in alts and they dgaf about bitcoin dips anymore apparently
Any news?
Anyone fancy a beer?
The best time to Buy Everything (Tokens, Coins...)
Remember : 
What Goes Down Must Come Up
Bitcoin is not a ponzi scheme or a multi level marketing scheme, it's a decentralized peer to peer reverse funnel system. Stop creating unnecceary fud and slowing down eventual progress people. 

Big banks and corporate interests spreading more FUD so that they can short and buy back in at a lower price. Banksters know that Bitcoin will render their business model obsolete when BTC hits 50,000 and no one needs loans anymore. Don't fall for the FUD and sell them your cheap BTC. Stop valuing BTC in fiat (inflationary central bank controlled monopoly money) and worry about how many SATOSHIS you can accumulate. HODL!
[deleted]
At least my comment karma is slowly rising...

Edit: People are downvoting me. I guess it was a bull trap.
lets break 7k again. 

dread it, run from it, destiny still arrives
Stop panicking pussies
My 2 cents worth with Indian banking mandate and tax season this month the selling pressure will surely drive price down. The question is how far down and to what extent Bitcoin will recover. So many waiting for the bottom. Perhaps now is a good time to sell and buy back later as Bitcoin is unfortunately failing to hold above $7000 and is getting very close to testing February lows.
the banks have 3 months to stop crypto - does that mean people cash out into Fiat in the next 3 Month?
What do you guys think Bitcoin's actual stable value to USD is? 

The garbage online articles paint a picture of 400-1200

But the way things are going, and the noticably lightened effect FUD seems to be having lately makes me wonder (hope) it's around 4-6k

Is this just wishful thinking?
wtf just happened
Bring back the Bear Whale.
You're just throwing away money at this point. I have like $1000 (or less) just itching to be spent on a worthwhile investment and I don't really see much hope for making any return on cryptos cause I can think critically. If you take a look at the graph right now, you can see that we've already reached the point of no return so if you're just blindly going to believe that spending dip after dip after dip after dip is going to do any service to you, then you should think again for your sake. Do what you want to though. Your loss is certainly not my loss anyways. Lmfao. 
you would be shocked check out this btc adress guys

**Is bitcoin a decentralized pyramid/ponzi scheme?**

This is *not* FUD.  I am genuinely interested.   From what I can see, some people got rich, but not because goods and services of value were being created somewhere (as would be the case with stocks in a real company).    People got rich because others hoping to get rich rushed in and pushed up the price.   So it has basically been money flowing from the many to the few.   And now there is little new money coming in, whence the daily panics here over prices.

What do people think of the situation?
Guys please stop buying so we can get to 6k sooner rather than later. I’ve got shit to do, thanks.
**VERY IMPORTANT PSA**: Dear friends, please stop worrying about BTC price in terms of the useless fiat that we are going to replace quite soon.   Remember this is about freedom from governments and corrupt thieving banks, and about a technology that is going to change the world!    As a first adopter, your reward will come when BTC is the global currency.   You will be rich beyond your wildest dreams.   So stop panicking.

HODL AND WAIT FOR MOON SPACESHIP!    
I am interested in bitcoin, it reads great..THANKS
Bitcoin will remain flat as the fad is waning. When maximum supply is reached, miners cannot get any more rewards for mining Bitcoin and thus have to rely on transaction fees to make a profit. And transaction fees can only go up so much before people stop using Bitcoin. This is where the end of Bitcoin will be.
Wtf does this mean?

>Note from the moderators:

>You have been banned from /r/Bitcoin due to a comment that you may or may not make between now and the next halvening.

I have no idea why that's in my inbox.
Time to buy, or will this go down further?

6...5...4...
I think try TradeIO. Which is best and secure.
Next 5-6 hours going to be interesting.  Might be time to buy and ride a wave.

Damn dude, atta boy!  I dream of having a whole coin (literally).  Enjoy dat spread sheet glowing gloriously on your desk!
...you just willy-nilly dropped over 6k? Why do I feel like you shouldn't be investing in btc?
I woke up in a new Lamborghini!
[removed]
wake me up inside...
Don't know man but am getting sick of these shorting fuckers
Until every weak hand has sold their bags.
Would not break 6K USD level at least!
http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/mobile/000/005/393/IKIFEEL.jpg
Damn man, that's some harsh shit. What was going through your mind, if you don't mind me asking?

Seems like buying in at ATH would have been a 5+ year buying strategy, but you sold before you could even get a grasp on what's going on.
Don't worry. Imagine if you put the 17.5K in an ALT and about 100% of all the alts lost 75% of their value on top of BTC going down 80%. So you'd lose about 90% of your value in total if you did that. You survived. I bought ICX at 41K sats and rode it down to 23K meanwhile BTC fell dramatically on me. 
Why would you sell at 8.2k?!? It will eventually get back up to 17.5k, so you just threw away money. 
every single one of 'em.
They wipe their bottoms with $100 notes.
millionaires ,dont have damn time , you know!
Wonder how ppl get to become a mod in the first place
Good lord.  He flew too close to the sun.
Segwit and lightning are just methods of transferring between different users using the bitcoin blockchain right? And Isn’t bcash a slightly different blockchain 
I'm going mid. Bcash "forked off.

Maybe one day it will. 
Well he convinced me...time to delete all my Bitcoins and buy some Bitcoins. 
Corruption is just part of business as usual in India and Indians are adept at avoiding regulations.  India hasn't banned its citizens from using crypto currencies, just banks.  So people are skeptical that this will really amount to anything over there.
1000k swings? Damn I must’ve missed those
We'll be over 7k tomorrow.  Learn to read charts.
Er, surely not as painful as having your gonads physically removed?
Please see this thread, you can still use Bitcoin....

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/89ysac/india_bans_buyingselling_of_cryptocurrencies_with/
That sucks, dude. Surely there has to be a away. Binance account some foreign bank that will let you create an account. Then you can cash out to the foreign bank and then wire the money to your bank in India. They will never know.
Bro, you can't give up. Gotta fight it, go around it.
We need you and we're all rooting for you.
IMO its a bad idea to sell everything.  The value of 1 Bitcoin = 1 Bitcoin to anybody in the world regardless of anybody's government.  Lets' say you hold on for 4 years and Bitcoin becomes worth 100k.  Perhaps by then the Indian Government will change its stance, or worst case you could go on an awesome vacation to Crypto friendly countries.  They can't stop you from going to another country and spending your Bitcoin
Have India stopped regulating Gold yet?  - they always seem to be regulating something.  Didn't they also pull all fiat notes over a certain value from circulation?

Indian finance is frankly chaotic - everybody knows that, so I don't think it matters that much.
Big mistake!
I'd wait till we test 6k again. Maybe it won't go further than that and you'd have sold near the bottom.
Be patient! , unless you bought ATH or above 15K level

In next two month BTC would be upto 13K level at least

See you later, buying back in at 10k.
Shorts how ironic
The current forecast: Mass extinction Armageddon meteors falling from the sky
Well I don’t think anyone can say for certain. Definitely likely that some Indians will start selling off their bitcoin assets
Thx. Now the price can finally go up.
No! You can't leave, everyone really likes you!
Good timing. 
Hope you don't stay long in tether. People are eventually going to realize it's a scam and that it's not actually backed by USD.

How? You never can lose in that situation.
I like Tom Lee. He always makes me feel good.
I like Tom Lee as well, thanks for posting.  I hope he's right with his end year target price. 
Lmao this guy is crazy. It is impossible that 20% of ALL capital gains are from Crypto only.
about 2 months too late Tommy:

https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7sf0ow/tax_selling_season/
Its been tanking for months now. Where have you been?
And with that MSM commentary it’s bye bye to any adoption. Back underground for another 9 years.
["Patience."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sMbPAi6ov0)
6600, please step aside.
That eliminates 17% of the world from buying cryptocurrency  through their institutions.  I am sure more will follow.
They may have to buy usd or other internarional currency and through international services (if any) buy crypto. If the tech evolution is real, nothing can suppress it
See this thread.....

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/89ysac/india_bans_buyingselling_of_cryptocurrencies_with/
This is good for Bitcoin!!!
Indian people should then swear off fiat and do business with BTC wherever possible. Cut the banks out of the loop. I know it's easier said than done, but let them slit their own throat. They made the choice.
But this trading range is holding the bulls and all the hodlers hostage. If you think about it....
I thought we would be good for a while post G20 and perhaps a recovery may still happen before then. The next potential negative could be around June/July Re South Korea taxation framework and G20 countries aim to have a plan on how to tackle crypto both could spook crypto markets, stifle market cap and wider adoption.
Btrash has no soul. 
What about all the dying babies?
Maybe the price will double first, but Bitcoin will find a way to terrify you again when you least expect it.
Is there any way to see how many open positions are at a moment on a particular exchange?
Where are you seeing that data?
[deleted]
Is this what is to be announced on CNBC Fast money tonight?
So weak, if they gonna make bitcoin crash stop with all these pussy amounts.  
If you don’t pay the IRS then your ass pays the price.
This doesn't even make sense. He owes 50k on the trade where he made money. Then he lost all the money on another trade. That means he owes nothing. He profited nothing. You can declare losses too you know....
Call me cynical but it seems like they are taking it in turns to announce these plans, almost like they have a pre-arranged schedule so that they don't make two announcements on the same day.  
"This is good for Bitcoin". lol

But honestly, it is! 

Right now people are trading as if there were no taxes on every single trade. 

Once they realize that a trade will be taxed, they will trade less and hold more. 

This will reduce volatility.
Why need to buy more?
You should have BTC already! be patient till BTC reach 13K level again!
Mostly institution, you won't find the average peeps buying when it's low
March month passed, its end of the 1st week in April

So I dont think , BTC would ever come to below 6K level!

6.5K? might be :|

What fundamentals?
The fundamentals haven't changed in two years since it was in the $400 range.
don't get my hopes up
i don't know what to think anymore.  going down to 4k or lower wouldn't even surprise me.  even though i think that'd be total bullshit
Yup.
Are you suggesting that the banking system is behind the current bitcoin price? 

The whole point of bitcoin was to subvert said banking system, if it fails at that than I personally see it as a failed experiment. That hasn't quite happened yet.

The current price much more likely has to do with the ridiculous FOMO that the general public bought into late last year. Once that hype faded so did the price.
India really won't have that much of an impact as you think.
The good thing is that with bitcoin we are replacing the banking system!
[deleted]
You are talking about the same guy which said that he will it his private parts if BTC is not 1 mil. $ by the end of the year? :) you are still listening to that guy? :) 
He's fully invested isn't he? Makes sense he would say smth like that.
John McAfee admitted that he is being paid every time he tweets about crypto 
We spent almost a month between 8k and 9k before getting further lower. The stable price at a certain level for a week doesn’t guarantee thats the bottom. But I really really wish this is the fucking bottom this time around and we rally from this point up. 
Well technically it's darkest at midnight. 
I disagree with your first paragraph. There are always buyers and sellers. Broadly, the market drops if more people want to sell than people who want to buy, and it rises if more people want to buy than people who want to sell. Obviously, it’s to do with volume rather than number of people, but it was easier to write that way. 

If a market hits the bottom, it is because the number of people wanting to sell becomes in equilibrium with the number of people wanting to buy. This could either be because the lower price has attracted more buyers or because its deterred the excess sellers. Usually, it’s both. It is not purely down to the sellers, like you say above.
I'm OK with "shitty paper money", as is 99.9999999% of the world.   That is why bitcoin is going nowhere and people are here panicking like crazy every day.
word looks like everyone is uere to make their shitty fiat im not selling ever im exchaning it for goods and services once it gets up fuck fiat
I believe in you Dave, I know you can make it happen so long as you never give up!
Not really. A turning point is usually a hard crash down, closely followed by a rally up. With lots of volume.
I bought it when it was 11500. Fortunately I didnt have to sell so far and I can afford few more months but I feel for you. 
Hmm, I don't think they tax losses - it would be SOOOO mean if they did!
Technically you do nothing.  Make sure you save any documentation that proves the capital loss.   Then in future years,  if you have any capital gains,  you can subtract your prior losses before you pay taxes the gains that remain.   
[deleted]
Imagine if they did that with dollars. There would be no currency left in circulation.
Why would you not want to sell your house and take out a loan for it?

Rule number one of investing Bitcoin: invest way more than you can afford to lose.

Then panic sell at the first sign of economic downturn and you'll finally be one of us. ;)
Tosser
When you buy a dip at inflationary prices that's what usually happens. sure it's lower than it was, but if it's still inflated it will go lower. 

we were seeing it bounce from 6.8 to 7.2 because it's a  good buy sell strategy and it's wise to sell for a little profit instead of hoping for a rally to 9k and potentially losing it all 

But now there's signs that we may go lower so the market has stagnated because investors are watching to see which way we are headed.
Dollar cost average. Don’t blow your load all at one price point.
Sweet dreams. 
Congratulations! From now on you're losing money.

Just kiddin'... I believe it will all be good in the long run.
Par for the course!
What is so special about the 15th? 
I hope you're right on Bcash.  Lot of interesting data to watch as it withers out (if it happens that way).
BCrash isn’t dying. The crypto market in general however, is. Bitcoin would have to go to $30k and then drop to ever get the general public reinterested in crypto. They would need to see that any ATH can eventually be surpassed so they can confidently hold through the downs.
I remember the good old days when bitcoin was $200. Perhaps we'll relive it...
It could also be replaced by something else and be worth 0 USD
[deleted]
If BTC goes to 200 dollars and such it will be extremely easy to go 5-10x and become super rich. I hope I will see it near that.
Nah... normal market cycle. We’ve just entered bearish times. All normal, move on.
A slow death for the what... 4th or 5th time? 
Its ok we will generate value by hodling
Dont worry, you'll soon see some heavy dildo's across the board. Probably all red cause red is the new green in 2018

Don't worry.  Just keep believing in the tech.   You will be rewarded in the end.

Support levels are prices that have held before (strong support would be prices that got hit several times and held). Resistance is the opposite -- they're price levels that bitcoin tries to get through and can't (or climbs above briefly before falling back down). 
You're good.
You are alive...
Bears and Bulls are best friends for now. But both are cons. Lets see who pulls other’s legs first.
It didn't go up for quite some time. That usually means, it will go down soon.

Haha I just posted about it all confused. Made a complete ass outta my self in the process.

Give me some good alts, I'm way outta the loop in that department except the few that I mine and they most certainly follow around Bitcoin's price like a shadow.
ALTs will eventually start uncoupling from bitcoin. Maybe its good for both.
Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are back together.
My hands are itching to throw more money in but I am resisting.... because some people think it will go to 5K... I doubt it, I think this is the bottom.

Wish someone could confirm logically?
Are you sure you're not ableleg?
Probably not going to happen. My guess is that it's going down. 
I don't think India will have an impact.  Clealry they want to launch their own shitcoins.
A claim as substantial as that truly warrants some context my dude.
Is that like in Mission Impossible or something?  

That is, if they don't stop it within 3 months the pregnant lady in the lift dies in an inferno that triggers the release of a dangerous virus and also a leopard from the local zoo where the local schoolchildren are visiting?
What makes you say they have 3 months to stop crypto?
How could Bitcoin be stable with a market cap of say 20 billion? If at the current market cap it's easy to manipulate, imagine with a much lower one.... There will always be buyers and sellers in a much unregulated market (for now). For bitcoin's price to be stable, the market cap must be way higher. Not lower.
Well if you believe that is what bitcoin is worth then dont buy until it reaches that number and if you are correct then you will be able to buy bitcoin at your ideal price and if not you will kick yourself for not buying earlier.
IMHO the "ground" is somewhere around 2-3k, but I'm hoping we won't really go anywhere lower than the February low of 6k...
What do you mean by “happened”, its still happening. 
Why have we reached the point of no return?  
Hmm, yesterday you wrote on Reddit that you had earned 10k from crypto.  

So run that past me again - I'm confused:  is it a good, or a bad investment?

Start by learning what a Ponzi scheme actually is, then start learning what Bitcoin is and how it functions. Then apply what you've learned to any new market. You will see that it's a pretty uninformed question.
For someone who bought heavy at 8k, what would you tell them
PLEASE BUY BTC and don’t let it die , if we can’t get a bull run soon the sell off will get worse and the market cap will go even lower and interest in BTC will get even lower. PLEASE buy more now , today , stop tethering and let’s get some positive excitement going for everyone  !  A nice sustainable bull run would be just what we need !
Pathetic attempt of trying to make bitcoin holders look like a greedy and delusional sect. 

 
>**VERY IMPORTANT PSA**: Dear friends, please stop worrying about BTC price in terms of the useless fiat that we are going to replace quite soon.  

Useless Fiat...that I have to use in order to buy btc...

>Remember this is about freedom from governments and corrupt thieving banks, and about a technology that is going to change the world!    As a first adopter, your reward will come when BTC is the global currency.   You will be rich beyond your wildest dreams.   So stop panicking.

Rich...in what terms? Compared to Fiat? The same currency that we currently use to price BTC? Or will I still be rich when I own 1 btc compared to the hundereds of other guys from Wall Street that are buying 100 btc easily?

>
>HODL AND WAIT FOR MOON SPACESHIP!    

How can I make the moon comparison without Fiat?


Who do you work for?
The last Bitcoin won't be mined until 2140!
I'm not a btc holder, but by the time btc reachs max supply, btc will evolve and fix the transaction fee issues.
So bitcoin will end after 2100. Cool
Ok, you Clearly have no idea what you're talking about.
Maybe do a little research on the topic you intend to shit on next time hmm...
It was an April fools joke.
April fools, fool.
Yesterday only $300 between low/high in daytime hitting just over $6900, repeatedly failing to hold above $7000 recently, the tax season and yesterday's India banking news is telling me to wait for bottom.
3..
MT GOX
Care to explain why? Haven’t had a chance to keep up as much. 
9h passed. How did that work out for you?
If you can wake up and drop $6k then it’s probably a small part of your portfolio
Why are you even worried about what he/she does?
Cause he isn't and he didnt. It's just fun to be part of a conversation for some people. 
What exactly is adoption if it’s not the general public involved? So if the general public should stay out of BTC who’s it for and what’s its goal?
I feel like I should ask them for money

Edit: He replied instantly 12 minutes ago, Now i got nothing. :(
Lol @ thinking there arent people who can drop 6k at the drop of a hat. 

There are people who buy $60k worth on a whim.  $6k is literally pocket change. 
I woke up in a lamb bikini. 
If there is a pump I'm totally claiming it to my 1BTC buy!! 
As an old man too. Don't forget that part lol..
*looks at portfolio*

SAVE MEEEEEEE
bought for $ 7000 and I will hodl up to $ 1 if it needs .... f * ck the whales such as kraken, bitstamp, gdax ect ect
Until all the new people ( aka weak hands) no longer want anything to do with the crypto market and never want to own them.
It was a long term buying strategy, but there's a better opportunity with a relative steadier return, not to mention bitcoin watching is significantly disturbed my life. Again, I have not given up the vision of satoshi, bitcoin is here to stay, but might not be the best investment tool at this time.
Bytom didnt loose its value :) 
He can buy now on 6.5 so he already made a good decision, don't you understand that? 
There are other investment opportunities.
I knew it, those crafty bastards.
I doubt it, I heard mods don't have any fiat money at all
wat
End of January through February was nuts. Memes galore. Once the mt gox trustee story came out beginning of March we’ve been walking down the stairway to hell with plenty of sideways action mixed in to lull one to sleep. Hoping this reverses soon. 
Your post history shows that you are constantly wrong
Source?  😜sorry couldn’t resist. 
So 1 BTC is 1 BTC but also 100k?
The value of 1 bitcoin is not one bloody bitcoin. Its what you can buy for it in real world terms that's the value. I'm tired of hearing this dumb mantra over and over.

Such a retarded point of view and only recited over and over to get other people who are losing real world value hand over fist to hold onto theirs. 

When it hits zero don't worry fella, because your 1 bitcoin will still be worth 1 bitcoin.

Pffff. 
Or he holds for four years, and what was worth 10k, is now worth 0.
I love coming into this sub once a week and reading all the comments like this. 
Based on what?
Ok lets wait and see

time would tell

Ooohhh! Got em'!
Eat my shorts. 
Love it!
Thats probably better than daily bleeding and slow death. Let it come. 
Lovely day 
Still holding strong. I don't know what to do though.
^ i like this guy
GOxx'd!


Who shorts under 8k lol?
Selling pressure in cryptocurrencies could ease after tax day.

The April 15 income-tax filing deadline is contributing to crypto’s falling prices as investors who won big betting on the digital tokens sell some of their remaining holdings to pay $25 billion in capital-gains levies, Tom Lee, the head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, wrote in a note Thursday. Bitcoin dropped more than 40 percent over the past month, including a 2.4 percent decline on Thursday to $6,664 as of 9:39 a.m. in New York.

“This is a massive outflow from crypto to dollars,” Lee wrote. “Historical estimates are each $1 of USD outflow is $20-$25 impact on crypto market value.”

Lee says that $25 billion prediction -- derived from his estimate that U.S. households had $92 billion in taxable gains from cryptocurrencies in 2017 -- would represent 20 percent of capital-gains tax receipts to the U.S. Treasury. He estimates total capital gains receipts will hit a record $168 billion for tax-year 2017.

A crypto bull who maintains a year-end price target on Bitcoin of $25,000, Lee sees the selling pressure passing.

“We still like Bitcoin and large-caps,” he said, adding that “while we believe the bear market for alt coins is largely over, we do not see upside for alts until mid-August.”
I’m not stating my opinion. Just discussing what’s been said on public TV.
I highly doubt that.
People are comparing cryptocurrency with shares of AT& T in 1920,shares of Apple in the first year of its launching etc, however they flourished in an optimal environment with advancing technologies as well as legal support from governments. With countries banning crypto currency one after another like China, India, korea I wonder if we are turning our White money into Black money by investing it in crypto??

I am not talking abt the Blockchain technology, its there and it will develop but the Bitcoin thingy is all I am getting worried about day by day

And yeah I am a redditer for two weeks. 
Thank you !
Pls explain how ?
That's what we all should do. I'm tired of this corrupt asinine system.
Big buyers here. One wallet accumulated over $400 mil below $8000. Big money is trying to get into Bitcoin, everyone knows dollar inflation is coming and everyone knows the US markets have to see its arse at some point. 

Other than physical gold (which you can't get apparently) there is really nowhere else to go...

http://fortune.com/2018/02/19/400-million-bitcoin-anonymous-investor/
I think the stock market doing poorly is really hitting Bitcoin hard. 
I expect it to go down. Now can it terrify me by going the fuck up ?
Pretty sure they asked me when I signed up a year ago for social and birthdate.
Yeah, it's asking for a bit much at this point, especially since it wasn't always this way.
Well -  there is a way for your average Bitcoin millionaire to get out of that loop. 

Stay out of your country of origin, most will have you non tax resident after a year abroad. Think tropical beaches here. Can't come back for more than 90 days a year. 

Trade in a different country than you're in. If you're in Singapore trade in Hong Kong, if you're in Hong Kong trade in Singapore. 

I know the perception is the US want's global income tax, but I have a few mates from the US who are tumble weeding around the place and they don't pay tax and they are submitting tax returns, so there is a way. 
Buy Monero?

(Not shilling - I'm 80% BTC)
How to avoid Cryptocurrency Tax Nightmares: https://thirtyk.com/2018/03/21/cryptocurrency-tax-advice/
Nope in the US each trade is taxable. If you buy 0.5 bitcoin at $6500 and it goes to $6520 you subtract the trading fee if any then are taxed on the remainder. Same for any crypto to crypto trades (including tether). If you make a hundred profitable trades and then lose it all, you still owe massive taxes on the hundred profitable trades.
Yeah if you record those gains and losses in the same year. However if you record the gain in 2017, and then a big loss in 2018, you could be hooped for 2017 unless you have the cash on hand. 
That's what I thought, still doesn't help when you see media like that. 
Cartel some might say or coincidence.
Each buy the dip will be taxable surely not as appealing but perhaps that is what governments want to curb interest.
I agree that this was inevitable, there was never any chance that crypto would remain tax free forever.  What I dislike is the timing of all of these announcements.  They have had years to make these decisions and they seem to be making these at the worst possible times for crypto.  Makes me think it's all part of some sort of plan to try and kill it. 
Except for myself.
Segwit, lightening. Gtfo of here with that. 
No, I was suggesting that the market loves to short when ever bad news rolls out and we were already on shaky ground.
Apparently so, last time it did but I guess the lower we get, the closer we get to Bitcoins actual value and the less impact fud will have.
i don't take him totally seriously but he always brings up good points and seems to have a feel on the industry
Even with the recent "crash", he's not that far off, yet.  https://bircoin.top
Doesn't matter what happens with crypto, he's bankrolled in marketing right now.  And the more we talk about the wager and keep that in our minds the more money we allow him to generate off the foolishness.  More power to him, I think it is incredibly clever.
Yes he is Totally Insane. But i do think he's somewhat of a genius.  His Anti-Virus software at some point was in like every computer right?  I don't really pay attention to his insane prediction of 1million by 2020, but I've watched a lot of interviews of him and he makes great points.  My impression is the guy knows a lot more about the industry than I do
Think about how much more he’ll get to charge for his promo tweets after he eats his own dick on TV. Man is only as good as his word! But he’ll probably get himself sued by TPG capital and Intel long before that for the public harm to the McAfee AV brand. Either that or TPG could buy up a few $billion of bitcoin to make him prophetically famous and reap the peak $.
did you watch the interview?  The guy knows more than me and is more connected.  He's outlandish but I don't get the impression he is lying about the potential of the industry.  His past is super shady but he did pioneer the Anti-Virus software.  My biggest concern right now is to feel confident that we will get back to ATH and outside of just the McAfee interview, the other panelists seem very confident about the future.
If you are at DST, then it's darkest at 1 am.
So you like the bank system. You like to be a slave for the elites? Like the rest 😂😂 The first people with bitcoin wanted to change something not because of money. Thats why we rich now. Good karma.
You will be waiting forever to "fuck fiat"!
I actually hope it will hold in the upcoming American recession and that more property owners will accept Bitcoin because of us instability.

That's when I'll swoop in and buy up some property on the cheap and with my profits.

Then take those profits and flow them back through Bitcoin and so on and so forth. Kinda the best of both worlds and basically still avoiding fiat.
it seems as if the strength of the sellers is beginning to decline in this region
How is this not a hard crash down? Look at the charts. 
Well, I bought at 11,500, then doubled down to get it averaged at 10,700. 

$8300 of my investment turned into $5300 in a month LMAO. Going to try to make it back in the stock market. Will take a long time for sure but I have more faith in recovering the 3k in established companies than I do in btc tbh. Hodl at 1k loss. Hodl at a 2k loss. Not sticking around for the 3k loss to turn into a 4,5,6k loss.... which I half expect it to. 

Also I’m incredibly tired of checking the price every 20 minutes just to be crushed over and over and over again. Not worth the stress. 
They don't, you can actually write it off.
Capital gains specifically (1y plus), or any short term gain?
Thanks for that. 
I know! Only if this applied to those who lost their savings and investments in 2008.
Who is this us you are talking about?
Unless we're in the middle of a bull run! I dollar cost averaged from last October thru last December. I would've been *much* better off had I put all my money in at the first price point in October.
Yea.... You lose less money. Still losing money. You act like what you're saying will prevent loses.
I don't sleep right unless bitcoin dips hard. Good night gents
ehh, already in the red. lol
we moon
IRS deadline. Many people sell now as they learned of capital gains tax 
It is already dead.  De-fib from Ver will no longer work, there needs to be some sign of activity.
so the previous all time highs don't mean anything 30k your weird.
Bitcoin already saw its ATH.
Of course Bcash is dying: by value, interest and trading volume.  It is almost dead.
I agree with you completely. 
Oh FUDGenerator, your abrasive lazy trolling always gives me a smile. 
Really? That is awesome thankyou i feel less stress now
YES!!! I WAS WRONG!!! 
Did you start buying that 17k dip?
I am holding vast majority of my stack, but I have a small portion set aside for day trading because I got bored waiting for bitcoin to rise. 
Based on what I've read, heard, and been told by Indian friends. Combined with my own life experiences I'd say... **NO** they are protecting their own interests.
Bull trap..more like bull crap. 
Why do bears even carry on with their behavior? It hurts everyone I don't get it . 
You might be winning the current battle but the war is far from over. 
I'm not saying you think this, I'm really not, but most of the people talking about bitcoin going to the moon seem to not realise that it has already mooned and its never going to reach those heights again.

The general public got pulled in at the end of last year and the people that recognised it cashed out around the ATH.

Im pretty sure that can never happen again after all of the negative publicity of the crash. 

It's over. I'm sure of it. 
Morning where?
thank you
test
I can't help but err on the side of caution right now, but I've learned that the enduring "To be, or not to be?" question is if I don't risk I won't lose, but in order for me to gain I must risk.
... and here we go.
Manbearbullpig* ftfy
yea and yesterday
BNB is a strong one. If you put all your money in BNB it not only held strong since 8k BTC, it rose consistently week after week. It lost less than a percent in the dip that just occurred, hardly a scratch on it.
check out TRAC, OMG.
why? Alt's are centralized, premined BS that you use to get more Bitcoin.

Are they?
I think most agree that 5k is the buttom, thats why it wont be the buttom. It moght go further down that
It doesn't seem to be budging past 6600 I wish something would happen up or down ha 
[deleted]
Watch Heijin Lee on Youtube.

No. I'm not sure of anything. Are you sure, *you're* not ableleg?
I think he is talking about that India thing. 
I believe he's talking about India.
Well sure. But manipulation aside, the price has always been way more stable than it has been since it shot up at the end of '17.

That's a usual sign of inflation, the more over valued a commodity gets, the less stable it's price.

Of course a higher market cap would likely mean more stability, it would also likely mean a higher average price. But the rules are still the same.
Most of my coins come from trading altcoins that I have mined. So I never actually pay the full price whatever that may be.

So it kinda doesn't actually matter to me because if Bitcoin is inflated so are the alts and vice versa.
Looked like we were forming a bullish triangle over the last day or so. Go to have lunch and come back to a $300 dump. rip 
Because when every coin is crashing down at 70% below the ATH, then its a sign that the whole market is pretty much gone up in smoke. Back when this happened 3-4 years ago, bitcoins weren't worth a lot of money - which is why it had stabilized for so long and then went up when more and more investors took advantage of the opportunity to hoard many coins to dump at the right time. Those investors are long gone. Never coming back. Bitcoins will probably never see the light of the $20k price tag again. Sorry but it will take a long time for bitcoins to rebound to even half of where it was before. If you really care about your money, I would NOT buy anymore bitcoins but rather keep the ones you have and hope to recoup as much loss as you can before the inevitable happens. That's what I'm gonna do; not hold on to the coins like an idiot when the opportunity to sell shows up again like it did when it reached almost $12k in Feb.
Very bad advise losses can exceed deposits
> wow 5 figures, you must be a player.

*yawn* Is there someone else who can dish out a more offensive comment than this junk?
Resplendent.
Bittrex exchange.
Thank you
Buy heavy at a lower amount to help your dollar cost average.
Hodl. It will 100% get back to 8k and beyond, I’m just waiting to put in that 6k long and I’m tired of checking the price every fucking hour 
take your loss and never look back
3 words:


Hey hey heeeeeeeeeey
Don't worry, inflation is on the way, dollar going to see it's posterior soon, so BTC price will go up by default. 
Huh?   What makes you say that? OK, if you wish, forget the part about the riches and focus on freedom from governments and corrupt thieving banks, and about a technology that is going to change the world.  How's that?
Dying Babies Inc.
The money police. 
And we *should* have a cheaper way to make and supply electricity by then too. We're talking 100 years from now folks.
Wait, so exchanges are going to start working for free? Lol!!! Operating costs be damned! We will exchange for free? That's just crazy talk right there. 
Yea maybe.
A store of value that will only have value for 80 years.  Like buying a house on leased land.
Elaborate?
Then educate people instead of getting defensive.
Oh shit, I didn't even see it until 4 days later and never put the dates together.

Lmao, they fucking got me good. 
You're probably right. $6600 is (was) a bargain. I'm thinking that surely there has to be a little pump up before the weekend.
4...
Reading the charts
It was interesting.  Market heavily minipulated downward to avoid the cross, but the buyback is coming.  Should be over 7000 by midday. Definitely time to buy now.
one would certainly hope so. even so, that doesn't make the decision logical.
I'm not worried. Was just making an observation. 
I wasn't implying I don't want general adoption. I want everyone and their grandmother in btc. It's just a terrible idea to throw a large sum of money at a moment's notice just because the urge struck you. Seems like a reasonable assumption to say people who trade/invest like that don't usually last. Unless they're rich and bored, I guess.
There are people that can buy $600k on a whim.
I never said that. The amount of money you can afford to lose in an investment or otherwise is completely independent of the reasonableness of the investment. 
Oh, *they will*. Just wait for the next bull run.
There is a greater distance between 17.5 and 8.2 than 6.5 and 8.2.
Couldn’t you use other money for that? Who’s to say your most recent investments don’t dive too? Do you bottom sell again? It just seems like poor planning. 17.5k was not a good time to buy. Even then you apparently didn’t use a Stop Order. You could of had a reasonable profit even though you missed out on most of the gains.

I’m only giving you shit because I saw your post that got removed. It bother me that people come into this space, make poor decisions, don’t bother to learn how to use the trading tools to minimize risk, and then have the loudest whiny voices all over social media saying it’s going to zero or it’s a scam. 
how much money did you lose?
Shit, it was doing it just last week.

Or occasionally truthful.
The short term moving average is about to cross the long term moving average on the 1hr chart indicating the start of an upswing on that oscillatory cycle.  The last upswing there took us to 7500 and ended on the 4th.
what i mean is it has the same value globally whereas 1 dollar does not equal 1 rupee and there is no exchange of different types of Fiat
The Mantra means that 1 Bitcoin equals 1 Bitcoin whether you are in USA or Japan or Australia or wherever.  Whereas 1 Dollar does not equal 1 Yen or 1 Rupee etc.  
If you think Bitcoin is worth 0 then why are you here?  Just to make fun of everybody?  You should do something more worthwhile with your time
Exactly. 
haha i guess I'm not one of the ppl who think Bitcoin will go to 0
On his dreams. There are the same chances that it could be at 3k
Magic. Bitcoin Wizard would be making an appearance soon again. It's known as magic internet money for a reason all these years
Sell some and buy back later at lower price.. That's what I'll do :(
Literally heaps of people. 
Do you really understand what shorting is?  It's about the *range* and whether it's going up or down, it does not depend on any particular value. 
If Tom Lee is such a genius,  why didn't he talk about this 2 months ago,  when bitcoin was 12K?   It was easy to see coming,  all you had to do is remember back 18 years!

But since Tom Lee still won't give you the bitter truth, I will.  April 15 WILL NOT end tax selling pressure.   What will happen is a fair amount of true believers WILL NOT sell now to pay their taxes,  they will pay the non payment penalty,  and pay the interest , hoping that their crypto will recover.  In 2001 that created the tax hangover,   look back and look at NASDAQ from April 2001.  My friend was just such a hold out.  He finally sold 7 months AFTER April 15, unwilling to pay the interest any further.
In a few years, they will have a special on the biggest Ponzi scam in history.
Then you are way too optimistic.
Don't worry pal, your money is yours and you don't have to worry about Bitcoin becoming world wide illegal. If you seek further knowledge regarding the cryptospace I warmly recommend Andreas Antonopoulus youtube channel. 
Because Bitcoin always always goes up and isn't in a bubble. Moon. Lambo. 

That's a summary of other arguments I've read, at least. 
the promised inflation that was going to happen in the last 10 years didn't happen at all. what you state is not true.

no big money is trying to get into bitcoin, big money is in bonds and equity 

tell me how much gold you want and you will get it delivered

there are so many hedges against inflation, bonds, ... again what you say is incorrect
                                 
                      
Other than, of course, the traditional numerous ways of betting big against inflation, i.e., short or buy puts for stocks of companies in inflation-sensitive sectors, short or buy puts for treasuries and bonds, etc., etc., etc., etc., ......
[deleted]
Not if you ever want to visit the US again! You will be indicted in absentia for tax evasion and arrested at the airport if you ever return. Millions can’t just up and leave the US and go elsewhere! And they cannot trade their cryptos at every price drop or increase. Every trade is a taxable event. So in US you have no option but to HODL or suffer the tax losses and get out of crypto entirely.
Indeed. 

So many amateur traders are going to get burned in the next few years.

the IRS has mechanisms in place to allow people to offset gains against subsequent years losses, so that, you know, people don't kill themselves over common accounting issues 
Hopefully it's all part of a plan to lower the price so that a lot of institutions can buy in cheaper.
Buying is not taxable. And if you hold for more than a year, your capital gains are tax-free. 

At least it's like that in Germany. I'm sure most countries have similar tax laws.
Didn't you buy in at 6.8k?
Its funny that a whole truckload of negative press lowers bitcoin a few k.  But any small good news and it turns bullish.
[deleted]
Yeah, but go back and look at the full scale in linear, and you can see how incredibly unlikely it is.
This graph assumes an annual growth of almost 500% a year. Bitcoin would have to grow at a rate of .50%. It is not doing that right now. Come back after the first doubling milestone he predicted and let's talk.
Yes, while there are "dumb" people which trust him he will make money... sad but true...
If you look any TA clown on youtube you might think the same... but in fact almost all are just clowns that make a business on “subscriber” counts... who cares who is or what does kim kardashian do or say, but for some, to me, unimaginable reason when she twits about on some cloth part the sales go through the roof... same here.. as long as there are sheeps that think he is “something” he will be present and making money... pure marketing... it is not important what is said about you as long as people are talking about you :)
Do you have any idea how crazy McAfee is? Read his Wikipedia page. He does not know more about bitcoin than any of the other "Experts." 
Rich is good, but don't forget that the small number who have become rich have done so at the expense of a large number of suckers hoping to get rich.  More importantly note that those first people who wanted to change something have not changed anything at all.
What profits? Your fiat? 100 BTC is 100 BTC. Property is USD to BTC, at least for next several decades. So if your BTC to USD is down, you have no profits.
I'm looking. There was a crash down on March 30th, but it wasn't followed by a rally up.

This is more like a strange extended bear flag.

Look at Feb. 6th. This is what I'm talking about.
Good luck man
This is why they say invest what you can afford to loose and forget about it. That way when it goes down, it goes down and no pressure to pull the money out but only curiosity as to what future will bring 
IRS considers crypto profit capital gains.

They differential between long term capital gains (1+ yr) and short term capital gain (< 1yr)

Losses on an investment are first used to offset capital gains of the same type. Thus, short-term losses are first deducted against short-term capital gains, and long-term losses are deducted from long-term gains. Net losses of either type can then be deducted from the other kind of gain.
Those are unrealized loses. You only lose original FIAT money when you sell your BTC.
It'll go back up. I have no plans on selling for several years (at least until 2024). By that point I expect the price will be higher than what I bought in for. I don't really watch the price unless I'm buying and then I want the price to be low so I can add more coins to my bags.
It's got nearly 11 billion dollars in it as of right now. You can claim it's on its way to dying, but no way you can declare it dead.
[deleted]
Not a thing to the public at large. The only thing they will see for years without another ATH soon is that millions of people lost most of their money by putting it in. So they won’t be interested in putting in a cent, let alone a dollar.
It’s still listed on major exchanges. Until that changes it isn’t dying. When it’s $100 it will be a much better buy than Bitcoin and will surge past in value. The whole idea is counterproductive.
CBD makes one hell of a cookie
It can go even higher too. But also it could become worthless.
[deleted]
let’s hope it lasts lol 
Actually I started a little before we reached ATH. Now I'm cost averaging on the way down.

I'm pretty sure it will pay off in the long term.
No I started at 11.2k end of January. 
That's what the market is playing on: boredom. 

If you get impatient, you lose.
Here.
[deleted]
BNB is my only alt.
I just can't trust an exchange coin like that. Idk, maybe it is profitable but it just feels sketchy.
Hmm, been hearing a lot about OMG lately.  Guess they're worth looking into. Thanks guys
Its getting opposite, people are using bitcoin to get more ALTs.
perhaps both :)
Damn, I was...but now, I, I don't know. :0
OK, tiger then
It was a bear flag.
The dump actually happened in last 5 minutes of that lunch break. 
Why do you presume I have losses? 
So basically what you're telling me is that you're statement is based off of an assumption, alright
if you are not selling for a profit you have lost. so now you are justifying why your decision is better than the guy who is holding there coins like an idiot. The money is already spent hodl.
very bad ?
in this long time bear market is very god....
lol why change your original comment? I'm bearish on crypto mid term as well but you sound whiney and pretty dumb if you think is the end. 
For sure but I can’t until it gets to 6k 
I would but I spent it all on $11k bitcoin. Think I’ll ever break even?
same
Absolutely hold. Wait a year, 3 yeaes, hell even 10 years. Maybe then you can buy a lambo. If you don't believe in it then don't buy more but I wouldn't be hesitant to eat a loss when it'll bounce back to at least 9k+ in the next few months
why? Generally when the market tanks, so do cryptos. Will the inflation make the dollar stronger? I am confused. ELI5
[deleted]
wauw, I can imagine the whole world is waiting for this brand new bitcoin tech !!! amazing!!!

what a load of bullshit this bitcoin is, it will go to $0,004 in a few years and we'll all have a good laugh in the pub in 20 years about it
Well you come off as rather trollish so that's why I didn't bother explaining further.

If you don't believe in Bitcoin, that's your choice but keeping miners mining is a non issue. 

As the others have stated, it will be 120 years before the last coins are rolling out. If Bitcoin manages to last that long, lack of incentives for miners sure as hell won't kill it.

Also, I'd like to point out the fact that Bitcoin is not set in stone and can be changed at anytime. If fees aren't enough to sustain the miners there are 101 options to choose from. Like switching to a Proof of stake scheme.
Is that like reading tea leaves?
Chur. Thanks. 
Well from my standpoint its a great time to buy. 
So what you want is everyone and their grandmother to spend years studying the intricacies of the market and then purchase, only to watch 50% of their investment disappear. That’s great for adoption.

I don’t think 6K makes a man rich. Wtf is wrong with someone buying BTC ? We need more like him as opposed to people shorting the crap out of BTC into the ground like it’s a casino gambling machine with no regard how crypto currency can better the world. 
If he can afford to spend $6k on bitcoin, it’s no different to you and I blowing $50
Correct. 
Why aren’t they then? This shit is dead and already crashed 75%
There are people that can buy $6 on a whim
Actually its not. 

What matters when buying Bitcoin are percentages involved - not dollar amounts. If throwing $6000 at it is unreasonable - then so is $600, $60 or $6. 

If one can afford to lose the money with zero change to his or her lifestyle then $6000 makes as much sense as $60. 

Lost around 20k
But 1000k? That’s like $1m
The rally to 7.5k was cute, but if it made it back into the 8k range it would have felt more like the January-February period.  What’s happening now in the 6k range is a snoozer.  
A stopped clock is right twice a day!
>The short term moving average is about to cross the long term moving average on the 1hr chart indicating...

1hr chart.

I hope others see the flaw in that.

You were saying?
Nothing to do at work so I’m here for the shitshow 
Keep the faith.
I think 3k is more likely actually. 
I will also tell you something, my friend 50 years ago made £3 million.  My friends story is about as relevant as your friends.  
I doubt that, too. 

The ecosystem has evolved massively during the past 9 years. Now there are well funded companies developing solutions to advance adoption. 

Just think of Lightning Network and all the surrounding APIs which have been released lately.

We are on the brink to step into the next level of adoption.
Thankyou for ur recommendation sir. I will surely go through it 
Go buy a packet of chips. You know, crisps. One of those small packets. Count how many there are in there. Don't tell me there is no inflation. I see it everywhere. 

The bulk of it still isn't visible, but it will come. 

I don't know what bonds are going to do, but equities are going to come off at some point. Probably this year. But to me if one buyer is buying $400 mil, that's big money. For crypto's anyway. 

When Bitcoin gets to $100k I'll tap your for that gold if it isn't to late. 
When the multiplier is lowered while interest hikes start you will be truly amazed at the incompetence of the west in 08 with the exception of Iceland, who will fare best. The fallout of the next crisis will likely be known as the worst in history for at least a thousand years 
I’d take a 1 kg if it is lab tested drilled and certified pure with no tungsten core, but very little market gold doesn’t have some tungsten molded in for extra weight.
Gold isn’t going away- neither is Bitcoin. Bitcoin is also a hedge against inflation.
Markets are so broken, so openly manipulated, taking traditional inflation positions possibly won't work. 

Point is if the dollars comes off, with the yuan/oil/gold trade and/or inflation Crypto's will skyrocket in dollar terms. People see that they're going to storm over. 

You can't even keep money in a bank. It can be confiscated at will now in the entire western hemisphere for a bail in, as they did in Cyprus. That was a practice run to see how it will go and it went really well. 
Maybe you're right and it was just my Drivers License 
Well, what about losses? Surely if a profit is taxable a loss is deductible. 

I'll ask again, but my mates are oil workers and they don't pay a cent on that (oil) income, mainly because of absence. US is unique in its tax views anyway. Most countries have non resident rules. 
I believe that depends on the level of gains.
Yes. Every dip. Since ATH. Slowly reducing my average cost.

If it goes down to 6k, I'll buy a little more.
I haven't really been seeing that lately.
hes a Business man and a computer programmer.  What about the guys on CNBC, you don't think they get paid to shill stocks?
very true.  But he's an old man, poor health, what does he have to gain?  That interview is just about the industry in general, no specific coin other than the obvious Bitcoin.  Does he really want to die and be looked back on as a total joke?  His past - the whole murder thing., yes totally crazy.  But he says things in interviews that seem spot on.  
time will tell if he's a total clown.  
yes i know how crazy he is, saw the doc. His Bio looks completely legit though.  it doesn't matter if he murdered that guy or whatever other crazy shit he's done.  What matters is what he says during interviews.  Ive seen just about every interview of him since last May 2017 and I get the impression he has a strong grasp on the technology and industry.  He's and old man at this point and has nothing to gain by spewing lies.  Sure he may get paid 100k to promote coins, or to promote whatever, but during his candid interviews or speeches he's given on stage its generally about the technology and its implication and use cases


 His bio - is a British-American computer programmer and businessman. He founded the software company McAfee Associates in 1987 and ran it until 1994, when he resigned from the company. McAfee Associates achieved early success as the creators of McAfee, the first commercial antivirus software, and the business now produces a range of enterprise security software. The company was renamed to Intel Security in 2011 after being purchased by Intel, though the software still retains the McAfee brand name. McAfee's wealth peaked in 2007 at $100 million, before his investments plummeted in the global financial crisis that began that yeaimmediately states he is a computer programmer and business man.  
True but they got rewarded for trying. Most of the people are here for lambo and moon. Stupid 
I trade my good man, not hodl. :)
Good luck to you!! I’d like to see btc recover even if it means I lost 3k even when I didn’t have to. But I can’t handle it anymore I’m weak!!
I lied a little bit, I can afford to lose it... But my faith in it has shaken tremendously. The bottom is where....... 2k? Where does it stabilize? It’s so volatile that it’s affecting me mentally. I’m much more comfortable being in the stock market with a more reasonable risk vs reward. 
Got it, thanks! 
That's the right mindset.
They cared the last time it dropped 85%, I remember feeling bad for people who bought that high. ATH was 1200 dollars back then, would you buy for that old ATH right now if you could? 
yeah becausw people who go to a casino and lose money also never come back right?    uhu...
and all the people of the world lost money on bitcoin???   not even 1%  .... how can new money ever get into crypto right?   lol
Well you ca still use bitcoin as an invest ment without it reaching ATH. I you cant figure out how to make bitcoin work as an investment then you are in need of some help. Bitcoin hit 6000 buy bitcoin hits 6500 sell bitcoin hits 5000 buy bitcoin hits 6000 sell bitcoin hit 6500 buy bitcoin hit 6700 sell it doesnt have to reach ATH to make a profit.
Imprevedible is the most cromulent word I’ve ever read.
True that.  I bought most of my trading stack in the 8’s and thought I’d be trading the ups and downs between 8-9k. Then as soon I bought it everything started sinking.  Go figure    
I think TRON is going through a pump and dump honestly. The peak at the start of the month happened because of the testnet launch, and then everyone sold on that news. The recent pump is an echo of that, but there's not really anything coming up for TRON in the short-term that should justify the price increase, so I think it's going to fall back down to the 400's on binance. It could possibly slowly climb after that if it really starts to get adopted
Where tf do I buy alts? gdax?
Are you retarded?
Shows what I know I guess haha, still learning 
Hmm, you'd think it would've happened after his lunch but when you're pressed for time...
You said 5 figures, now you've edited it to 1000 USD.  

But you have also written elsewhere you earned 10k from crypto - which really is 5 figures.

So you've been doing pretty well?

I'm doubly confused now.  BS

man i shot my wad on the "bottom" so many times it aint funny.
I have no doubt you'll break even (and gain).  But at that buy in I'd say just get out of the daily threads and get a little side hobby.  If you check it daily and wait for it you're going to tear yourself up.  Be patient and you'll do fine.
I said dollar weaker. Crypto in USD terms stronger. 

I actually have no idea what effect this yuan/oil/gold trade is going to have. But it is a game changer. Gold for oil. Will have to see how that pans out. Last 2 people who tried it are dead. But China is a different story all together. Can't imagine it's going to be good for the dollar. 

A correlation between markets and crypto's are far from established. Bitcoin managed to crash 75% while the equities hang around record gains. 

You do know in 2008 the banks almost shut down? Came to within a hour or two of a total shut down. Now there's 7 or 8 times more debt in the system than then. If the US markets crash or one of the top banks fail, like DB, the ATM's will stop working for at least a period of time.  You'd really like to own crypto's then...


How old is fiat currency? How old are credit cards? How long has man placed value in precious metals? How long has man needed a way to exchange one thing of value for another?  
Bitcoin has many advantages over the current system. If you don't see that, then this probably isn't the place for you.

No, and if you think it is, you shouldn't be day trading.
I would agree. I have bought several times over the past week. 
Straw Man argument. There's a difference between the two and you know it. 
I think anyone investing in bitcoin at this early stage better have at least a rudimentary understanding and appreciation of the tech or they will certainly become a weak hand on the next dip. It’s my core belief in the tech (and my greed 🤪) that keeps me hodling despite painful losses so far. 
ITT: people getting pissy and defensive because I suggested thoughtful investing. Holy crap. 
Still accumulating...one wallet put in $400 mil below $7k, they're just doing it very quietly and slowly.
Where do you think the 1800 brand newly rewarded /mined BTC are going each day?  If the price is staying in a range or moving up at all, someone must be accumulating.
When I said reasonableness, I meant the logic (or lack thereof) behind the decision.
I see what you did there. My stupid brain just corrected his mistake automatically.
LMAO
Give it a minute, big downward manipulation last night to delay the cross
My friend's story is about what happens when a asset bubble and the IRS collide,  what's your friend's story exactly?
You WERE on the brink. Effed that up with the dumping in December. Prove me wrong in time, I sincerely hope you can though I also sincerely doubt it. Which is a strange and foreign mindset for me since last year I was preaching crypto. Venture Caps are also fleeing the space right now in droves. Denial is strong on both sides of the fence.
We really aren't. I see no signs that the world is on the brink of switching over to digital currencies. That would involve people getting paid in the digital currencies. This will not happen as long as the volatility remains high. You would be a fool to elect to be paid in such a volatile way.

My average day typically concludes with not a single person speaking of digital currencies.

> Just think of Lightning Network and all the surrounding APIs which have been released lately.

All that just means that the 0.0000000001% of people currently playing with bitcoin get more ways to play with it.  It has no effect on the rest of the world, which doesn't care about such things.
Anytime, you won't regret it.
i hope it goes to $100k for you but I really think $100 is closer

I'm a bit scared of the retail investor when it really is going to crash, i know a lot people just had to work hard for their savings and nobody is benefiting when they loose it all 

greed,it's always the same isn't it. 

this time it's different

it never is

it's always
the same

take a nap and sweet dreams
a bad one, you would need to short Bitcoin to hedge against the USD currently. 
if the above happens in the usa and most of the western world as you describe, you will have bigger problems than to keep your bitcoins at hand mate
I used birthdate and license but never had to use my SSN or say how I fund it 
The general talk in US is that further losses will make it easy for regulators to impose detrimental regulations due to its dangers of losses. So I suspect it’s almost there anyway. Probably won’t be too much longer before US citizens will be shadow banned from foreign trading platforms and then shadow banned from crypto entirely through harmful regulations under the guise of protecting consumers.
Nope.

I believe one day it will.
If you are worried and being affected mentally about your crypto investnents to the point of pulling it out then you cannot afford to lose it.
Well you could always sell so it will start rising.
Binance
Wtf does that mean ? Are you retarded ? 
Not all alts are centralized man and some of them have some good innovations. 

Bitcoin has kinda stagnated and I feel that is hurting it's ability to draw in new investors.
https://imgur.com/a/ba7P0
But it was $300k worth.
at which point, if the atm's stop working, it's going to be hard to eat with crypto because nobody will accept it. Cash will still be king right?
I don't think you'll find many day traders in this sub.

Or indeed, people think day trading is a science as opposed to an art.
No. There isn’t. The general public doesn’t need to study for years to buy EUR, USD, JPY, KRW, RMB etc.
Why is a $50 investment more logical than $5000? 

If I can afford to lose every penny of that money - then $5000 makes much more sense. If bitcoin doubles by the end of the year, i double my $5000. If it doesn’t, it doesnt matter. 

But if I put in $50 - if it doubles I only make $50 - and if I lose it it doesnt matter. So all things considered why wouldn’t I throw in the most I can afford to lose and stand a much higher chance of making more money? 
How many more minutes?
I'm just saying that 18 years is a long time ago.  No one knows what will happen for sure with the Bitcoin market, it's all totally new.  Already it has managed so much that no one would have believed could happen, to go for fractions of $1 to nearly $20 thousand.  Time will tell.
I believe you are mistaken *price* with *adoption*.
I wasn't saying that "the world is on the brink of switching over to digital currencies". This will take a long time. Many years. And yes, volatility has to be reduced for that.

But we're close to the next level. Baby steps.
Why is that in your opinion?
Why is it greed just because someone is trying to make money of an investment, Is it greed when you look for a job that pays better. If you want to talk about look at your banks and government. This year the US government is expected to make $25 billion from people who invested in crypto. 
You make absolutely no sense. BTC is a store of value. It sounds as if your saying you need to chug a bunch of goldschlager and shit out a bunch of placer gold to hedge against the bullshit.
I'm in Asia. We'll be alright over here. I bank in Asia as well. Safer. 
Thanks I wonder if other EU countries will follow suit (UK for me)
yes i agree with everything you are saying.   all I'm saying is I've watched a lot of interviews with him and he says some really smart stuff.  Maybe everything that comes out of his mouth is not totally true, but the guy appears to have a strong grasp on the technology and why its valuable, use cases, problems it solves etc.    Thats all i care about and in order to keep your head straight in this game and not panic sell, doing tons of research is paramount.  at least thats where my head is at until the market turns around.  
Ooooookay. -40% return in a month doesn’t bother you I guess. Coupled with the India news as well. 
Like right now. Make a profit and wait again; that's how the sausage is made.
He Sold? ..... Pump it
Thanks, appreciate. Always helpful to see other people's charts. I tend not to trade much anyway as I will clearly get the wrong idea the majority of the time 
Why would the scale make an impact?
As long as the cash last. But how long does it take to download a wallet for transactions ? Can you imagine how quick the uptake will be in a crises ? I think the world will switch almost over night if we get a global crises. 
Are you implying fiat and btc are the same in every respect? Ninety percent of this sub is dedicated to arguing the exact opposite. 
I'm not sure how else to word my argument. Let's say I have a billion dollars to spare and I invest in beanie babies because I think they're going to make a comeback. You seem to be saying that's a reasonable/logical/acceptable investment purely because it doesn't matter whether I make or lose money on it. And I disagree with that.  
Could be any time now.  Only 100 points off 7000 on the initial upswing.
All I've really done since I started posting in any crypto sub was to compare it to the Internet bubble,  because I was sooo deep into that fiasco it's burned in my psych.

Crypto is new,  but valuation bubbles are not,  If I've proven anything with my posts of the last three months,  it's that crypto is behaving almost exactly as the Internet bubble did 18 years ago.
And from $20k to fractions of a dollar. Quite the achievement it will be.
No. I’m equating interest with price. There is no interest so there will be no adoption. There is no interest because the general public has seen that bitcoin can drop by $14000 and not quickly recover. Which is extremely dangerous for those who would adopt it. They are scared away for many years, if not permanently.
Yes, that's Greed. 

I quote something you've might heard before:


The point is, ladies and gentleman, that greed -- for lack of a better word -- is good.

Greed is right.

Greed works.

Greed clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit.

Greed, in all of its forms -- greed for life, for money, for love, knowledge -- has marked the upward surge of mankind.





Exactly, and the value related to the USD is inverse, so you would need to short the Bitcoin currently to hedge against the dollar. 

It's okay if you can't grasp this intellectually. Just carry on and buy your bottoms in bitcoin and HODL during your losing position forever. All is good and fine. 
Famous last words...
Should be similar for all EU countries. Tax laws are harmonized. UK might be different, though. They always wanted their "extrawurst".
If you want to wait and see for long term , invest only that you are comfortable leaving in a bear market and  the loss of which doesnt affect you. But if it affects  you ,then sell for your own peace of mind. good luck.
Told ya.
I don't trade at all. I only buy the dips.
I don't think so. What is the FIRST thing that people will do during a crash? Sell sell sell. Bitcoin will bottom out within seconds if there is a crash because people don't think straight. They are panicked, and sell all their investments. Suddenly that 40k bitcoin hits like $500. That's what the millionaires want, a crash so they can buy it all for cash and then own everything. The 1% always rig the system because they have enough money to buy everything during the fire sale should the banks crash. Sure the upper middle class take the hit but the big players with huge reserves of cash can buy everything up.

Remember, if you are a giant mall owner, and suddenly ALL of your tenants can't pay rent, and you can't pay the bank, you are in big freaking trouble. I would love to know what Simon Malls would do in that situation? File bankruptcy to the builders and sit in trouble, or sell for 1/10 of a dollar to Warren Buffet?

I love the idea of the bitcoin trade happening, but is it realistic in the event of a financial collapse? It will be interesting to see what happens with this trade war and impending interest hike. Trump will cause a collapse, yes, but how and when is the issue.
I’m implying that you are NOT going to educate anything even close to 20% of all the possible current and future buyers of BTC. So if you want any adoption at all. That must be considered.
Any investment is logical as long as the investor believes they will make money. 

If you’re saying that Bitcoin will never increase in value again which is what makes it illogical- then I disagree and our conversation ends here. 

If you’re saying that investments are only logical if a return is all but guaranteed - then you don’t understand investing. 

If you’re saying that the logic of an investment decreases with the dollar amount invested then I disagree there too. 

If you believe Bitcoin will reach new highs in the future then buying as much as you can afford to lose right now makes total logical sense. If you think Bitcoin is really worth 0 then its illogical to invest a singal dollar. 

There are no other scenarios. 


Still any time now?
At the moment things are far from good if you compare everything to the ATH, I prefer to look at it from the perspective of it being nearly 7x higher then the $1k price it was around 1 year ago.  The next year will tell us a lot.  Like I say we are in total virgin territory.  Humans like to look back at the past and try and find similar examples, the fact is that this is 100% unique.  If anything it would make more sense to compare crypto with the early market for Gold.  That was very volatile in it's early years and took a long time to become stable. 
I've experienced the internet bubble. I didn't invest back then, because I thought it was crazy. Looking back it *was*. And it wasn't.

This time is similar in certain aspects. Especially regarding the market sentiments. But it's also different.

This time, with Bitcoin, you're not investing in a company. You're investing, or better: *betting*, that a protocol which isn't owned by a single company will be successful.

I know, I remember, back then everybody said: this is different from all the times before. And it wasn't. It was boom and bust. Same, same. But in the long run, it panned out. At least for a few companies.

In this case, we don't depend on a company to be successful. We depend on a protocol to be successful. It doesn't matter if the companies which are working on it will be. As long as there are companies working on it.

Not sure where I want to lead this other than: This is *indeed* different. It might end badly, too. But it just as well might not.
Quick, get out now then! 
You’re pretty funny. I am fully aware of what Bitcoin is and what bitcoin isn’t. You have absolutely no idea of where I am at in this game as you certainly are making yourself the fool.
Widely distributed subsistence farming so food produced locally, everyone is on scooters, don't need a lot of fuel, wide spread local storage of drinking water collected from rain. Strong family bonds. Rather here than say New York or London.

Although I guess it could turn into  situation where nowhere is safe. 
Maybe you can explain to me what people mean when they say that. Say you already had a lot of money invested and your plan was to buy the dips down from 20k. Doesn't that mean you're endlessly pumping more and more fiat into this bear market with no idea where the bottom is? Seems to me that's just creating more risk for yourself. 
I don't think Trump will cause it, he'll get blamed, but it's the Fed that will cause it. All they have to do is taper QE and raise interest rates. What di they do right after Trumps election ? 

As for crashes. Some people panic, but not everyone, we know that we have a crises every 10 years or so, same with the Crypto's, they also have crash cycles. So know when to be heavy and know when to be light. Now is heavy time. Crypto's are off 75% to 85% depending on which one it is. That's how you buy the Lamborghini. In most cases they have to gain anything from 200% to 600% just to get to previous highs, never mind new highs. 

Same way you trade equities, just much, much faster cycles till it matures. Is it realistic in a financial collapse ? We will see, the way to trade them is to keep a lot of cash in hand for crashes, so if it does crash as well you buy more, if it doesn't crash well then you're in anyway and gain anyway. 

You just need a robust strategy. Don't do leverage, keep cash in hand, by when there's blood in the streets, like right now. 
I more or less agree with this, and I never said otherwise. But now we're talking about general btc education, not the reasoning behind people's investment decisions. You can have one of those things without the other. You could know everything about btc and still think it's an unwise investment. You could also know nothing about it and think it's the best thing since nutella. 
edit: words
Waking up today and deciding out of the blue that I want to spend a million dollars on beanie babies is not logical just because I am personally convinced they will make me money. It and anything else is illogical if there's no reasonable evidence to support it. And we both know there are degrees of soundness in investing. Buying stock in Ford will always be more sound than buying penny stocks, regardless of how convinced one is about their potential success. But personally I do have high hopes for btc, and I continually buy more. 
One or two more oscillations on the 15m frequency.  Can't predict when it will happen exactly, and might jump back down to ~6800. Keep watching the charts.  The market oscillates at several wavelengths and when the oscillations match up is when you see jumps from one level to the next.  Feel free to doubt.  I'll keep on making money.
What's going to be really interesting is when the short term moving average crosses above the long term on the 6hr chart, which we're getting close to.  Almost happened in the last upswing, but broke back down.
And bingo.  But what do I know about reading charts...
Except that 70% of the people in the market are new and only see it since the ATH.
Which bodes well for those having equity stakes in corps and bad for crypto holders.
What you show is that you don't understand basic market structure. 


He's a long term investor, not a trader. 
Also a true believer in Bitcoin/gambling man.

The strategy he's using is to buy dip with his disposable income, (that he would otherwise spend on hookers) in hopes of seeing large profits further down the road.
I trust in the technology. And my time is valuable, I don't want to spend it on filling out tax forms.
Is it an investment? Is that what it is for and all that it will ever be? Maybe the devs and miners need to make a decision on what exactly it is? And if it’s an investment then it’s not looking like a good one to 99% of the rest of the world right now. So that’s also not good for adoption or an asset class.
Youre confusing logic with risk. 

A risky investment is not illogical so long as the investor has good reason to believe his money will grow. 

The problem here is you guys are taking a sum of money which to you is life changing, and applying it to an example (beanie babies) that you don’t believe will grow in value. But if $1 million was peanuts to you, and if deep down you had good reason to suspect beanie babies would double your money in a year - then there would be logic in the investment

The risk would be worth taking and is therefore logical. 

Illogical would be investing in something that you DIDNT think would make you money. That’s illogical. And if one thinks Bitcoin won’t ever make them money then they shouldn’t buy any. Not $5000 not $50 not $5. 

But if you truly believe it will increase in value then a $500,000 investment is just as logical as a $50 one - (more so actually) - provided that the loss of that money would have no impact on your life. 




Bingo what? A small move up that you have been predicting for a good while would happen “any minute “. You sound like a fortune teller, vague and then taking credit for anything that more or less fits.

Ps - this all started 2 days ago with you saying it’ll be over 7000 tomorrow (i.e. now yesterday), and chiding us to learn to read the charts. Lmfao
Explain to me what basic market structure is then. Because I am pretty well versed. But I’d sure love to hear your point of view regarding this current conversation.
I understand basic market structure alright. But I’d love to understand your point of view regarding this conversation. I have a feeling that you are a traditional investor and that is alright. But theres a new phat cat in town and you’re gonna have to live with it.
So the financially prudent strategy of a Bitcoin trader is to set aside hooker expenses and disposable income and reinvest it into Bitcoin during a dip?
In that sense I'm using "investment" very broadly, to just mean something you buy, basically. I'm not trying to comment on whether btc should be considered currency or commodity or whatever. I'm the last person to ask about that. And neither I nor anyone else can predict the future, so who knows? All I was and am ultimately trying to say is that the amount of money one has to spend/use/invest on/in something does not solidify the logic behind actually spending it. 
Watch it continue to rise.
No, the financially prudent strategy of a Bitcoin **investor**  to set aside hooker expenses and disposable income and **invest** it into Bitcoin. That is the way of the **HODL** :)
Yesterday?
*The Way of the HODL*!  A mysterious ancient wisdom.
Like I said, the timing of the rise is tough.  There was a big selloff after I said it would rise, so the line didn't cross where it was expected, but it came this morning.
Maybe you shouldn’t speak in absolutes when all you can do is make vague predictions 
The timing may be vague, but the fact of it jumping up to the higher level was inevitable.
In your original post you were not vague with your timing prediction (on Thursday, you said it would go over 7000 on Friday).

If timing is vague, why bother making time-based predictions? You come across as arrogant and then when you're wrong, you look for excuses rather than just saying you were wrong, making you seem even more arrogant.
I'll tell you when to sell.
I'd rather not. I'm holding long-term, using Bitcoin to buy things when possible to use it for what it's intended for, and replenishing my holding each time I do so.

I'd rather not spend the time or hassle of being a day trader, especially with the tax/accounting implications involved.
Fair enough.  Long term, I see it continuing to dip toward 6000 before it stops these downward swings, but we'll see it turn bullish within a month or two.  Keep watching the 6hr moving averages.
I'm hoping for bullish again at some point this year but I'm patient. Luckily most of my holding was bought at 950 USD.
Yeah, you're doing alright
Not too bad. I almost certainly should have sold at over 15,000 and bought back in again after though. Lesson learned.
Well, you'll almost certainly see it that high again eventually
So right now, we've reached an oscillation on the 1m scale and you'll see it going up and down 20-40 points at this level until a jump in one direction or the other, likely upward because the short term moving averages on the 5m, 15m, and 1h charts are all above the long term moving averages.
On the 5m chart, when the short term moving average dips below the long term, we'll see a drop of 50-150 points then it should climb back up, as the 15m short term will still be above the long term, and every drop we see in that cycle will climb back up until the short term moving average on the 1h chart dips below the long term moving average there. Then the oscillations will dip down in the mid 6000s again.  That's what I see when I look at the charts.  We're still on a downswing on the 6h chart and the 1d chart, hence why the overall trend will continue downward, and I believe people should be taking advantage of the oscillations on the 1h cycle, if so inclined.
