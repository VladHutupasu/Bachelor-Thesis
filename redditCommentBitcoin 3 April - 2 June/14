Anyone see the /technology thread on bitcoin energy consumption? It's a shit show.
So you know how you are allowed to write on money? Time to buy a "buy bitcoin" ink stamp. 
Let's see this thing cross 9k again! Fingers crossed 👌
wish i had extra fiat to buy more of this tasty dip \-\- this low volume is crazy as well

edit: alright... pamp it
Can we get to $8500 today?

**CRYPTO QUESTION**:   Yeah I’m new to the world of Crypto currency and I’m learning a great deal and thanks so much to the folks who have been kind to help me out. But I’m confused why if lots of people think that Crypto is going to shit and the bear market will last for who knows how long then why are we or I reading about these institutions and exchanges scaling up and expecting high volumes in the future. I keep reading Coinbase is scaling up. Goldman, JP. Why do all this if it’s bullshit? Thanks for helping!!!

Can we have website showing how much 1dollar can buy toilet paper? Soon it will be cheaper to wipe ass with it, like in venezuela
Where are all of the psychics and bitcoin wizards from one week ago that were telling us it was absolutely going to be at 12k by now? Just more proof that everything is speculation. Quit pretending you know the future. 
I miss the days when bitcoin wasn't under attack from all angles at all times.
Whats the trash trading volume lately. More people are trading goats than bitcoins it seems.
Waiting for the breakout...
I was hoping for a $1000 Green Dildo, instead we got a $130 one!  
Nice little pumpity wump wump. 
Being a seller right now is so sketchy
Exchanges like Binance & Bitfinex made >$300M with 97% profit margin this year. Legacy institutions have taken notice. And believe me, they're coming.

We'll hit a tipping point where the market will take off. 3-9 months.

Custody is difficult, and it's what's preventing pension/endowments from entering. It's a long process.

Until then, we'll go sideways.

Sand Hill road missed crypto chapter 1. They're not going to miss crypto chapter 2.

What the flip the happening
I really want this to not be a bt. I abbreviated to not utter it and maybe keep it from being so 
[https://youtu.be/AbWBviQCMEE](https://youtu.be/AbWBviQCMEE)
Ahhh a little Sunday coin 
Bitcoin always move forward.
[deleted]
so if it stays around $9k until december we get $2k in january?
Are the traders taking the weekends off now?
So. It's tine to buy.
Are we to feel bullish even with the low volume?
should i buy right now or wait a few months in case the price keeps dropping?

 My thesis is playing out https://www.tradingview.com/x/s3qYlUnZ/
I promised my GF I would have a lambo by this summer, she is going to dump me if not.  I know... but she she is out of my league and this is my only way to hold onto her.  
[deleted]
dat was EPIIIIC!!!!!!!!!
I am hoping to start my bitcoin related business by the August. Only issue is my fundraising ($20k-$25k), any sources of grant money for bitcoin businesses, trying to avoid bank loans? 

I would love to post my idea on GoFound be or something but fear someone that already has the cash might steal the idea.

Or a more applicable place to post this question.
So... this isn't legit traction, just some shorts getting foreclosed on?   What say you?
Hi. N00b here, Question: just DL'd my first crypto wallets for my phone... trying BitPay & Bitcoin.com. No BTC in them yet. How do I see my private key(s)? When I hit "receive", I see what I think is my public key... the long string and the QR code. But where is the private key? Is it just hidden, even from myself, for safety, and lurking somewhere in the software of this software wallet? Or am I misunderstanding something more fundamental? Thank you.
Bitcoin BTC price reach again to "8530 USD " As per report by "https://cryptochartindex.com/currency/bitcoin"

Has there been a discussion here yet about electricty rates where people are mining? I know here in Ontario Canada we have some of the highest rates in the country, and some provinces have some very low rates if negotiated. (Manitoba and some in Quebec). 

I've never mined and likely never will, but I'm curious  at what point do people say 'this isn't worth it' when earning 5-10 dollars a day in coin? 
It seems like all the gains in power conservation just went out the window because of mining, does this not weigh on anyone's mind?
Find me this ink stamp and I will buy it to stamp every bill I find in my possession
Don't worry you have time, this is always the quiet moment. Real trading resumes in september. To move BTC up from here institutional money is needed. Not us, small HOLD'rs.

Any theories on why the volume is so low right now? It's freaking me out.
Same,but im also exited for another bull run

There you go
Yes, we can!
we’re not getting any BGDs with this volume lol
Seems to be lagging a bit, has done for a few days, not sure why.
Right now the the demand for bitcoin to pay  for practical applications like smart contracts, value transfers and payments are not sufficient to consume miners expenses who immediatly sell their block rewards to pay for power. To sustain a steady price or increase the price that shortfall must be made up by new investors and old investors adding to their positions. The motivation for bitcoin buyers without a practical need is that the practical demand will soon overwhelm the amount of bitcoins available leading to a great appreciation in price. A large practical demand for bitcoin is a few years off so now any rise in price reflects the success the pro-bitcoin media is having selling the narrative to ordinary investors.
>Why do all this if it’s bullshit?

Because it's not.
Institutional money is coming in all the time but it's hard to have any accurate idea of when and how much.
People react very emotionally to changes in price.  Just in the past few weeks, we saw BTC above 9k and people were partying like we're going all the way to 20k.  Then it drops a bit to low 8k's, and BTC is done for, we're going to 5k, 3k, etc.

I don't recommend getting involved in crypto if you trade emotionally.
I honestly don't know what that even means...

Logic error: Proof that everything is speculation would require that every speculation is untrue.
Same place as all the people saying we were definitely going to 6k.
This one from /u/Mr_P_Pui is [Gold] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8fj22g/daily_discussion_april_28_2018/dy5ina9/)

Lots of people with experience dealing with other markets think that BTC is easy to predict ..... most full of confidence and all got burnt.
9,000 today, guaranteed. 
I have seen the future ;-)

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/rstZQtKL-BITSTAMP-D/
If Bitcoin can't handle it, then it's not good enough.

But I trust, that it will be able to handle it...
[deleted]
Panic sellers are mostly gone. People expecting moons and Lambos are gone. Conventional traders have gone away in May. Low volume until we break either way.
Volume dropped massively in just the last few days. Wonder what happened to the bots
You asked for $8500. You got it. Don't be greedy.
Maybe it's not yet done dildoing...

Ayy if someone had did that forreal, we'd be over 9k today.
Its watching us
Yes
Yes. You can't have 2 orders that are selling 100% of the same thing.
'tine' - a prong or sharp point, such as on a fork or antler.
I always feel bullish.
My pet bull Roger is feeling more bullish than usual - so bullish in fact that he killed one of my servants this morning.

So yes, there is genuine bullishness in the air.
Buy at every pay-check. 

*Dollar cost averaging*
you have no way of knowing whether or not the price will drop.  nobody can see the future.

specify an amount of fiat that you want to invest each month.  convert the fiat into BTC at a set time each month, with no regard for the price.
Maybe wait a few days and see if it drops from here. I doubt it, but there's still a chance that it will do that.

In a few months it will be much higher than today, and it won't drop back to these levels. Ever.

*Keep in mind: This is just my personal opinion. There are no guarantees.*
Btw, the donation is to be used for a kidney transplant. It's expensive. 
Okay so what happens from here on out?
Definitely your GF is something you shouldn't HODL. I guess you got into her by FOMO. Any way not a good investment...
By the time you can afford a lambo, you will be out of HER league. Always chase money first and then pussy will follow. No, it doesn't work vice versa.
Hodl!
Just stfu
Dont see any movement.
Show us the evidence, I don't believe you.
ideas are cheap, execution is everything. If revealing the idea kills your opportunity, it was far too fragile to begin with. 
Coinbase has funding for crypto projects, can’t remember what its under though 
Shorts getting closed *is* legit traction. Everything that moves the market is legit traction. That's how markets work...
Some wallet services don't give you a private key. Best you make one in Electrum if you want the seed
Yes. The wallet has the private keys. Some wallet software does not show them for safety and because you don't need to know your private keys for the wallet to function.
Why didn't you read the ['getting started'](https://bitcoin.org/en/getting-started) links in the side bar?  After you get all of your money stolen, which you will if you go to those sites you have chosen, you might want to read those links first next time.   Then you will know how to hodl.
Only the dark side of it :D :D
You mean your butt cheaks when you look in the mirror right next to uranus?
Hell no, 1broker.com all the way!
We can just have one custom made. We should all do it. 
why do you think september? and as much as i enjoy seeing the price rise, i hope you're right, it'd be nice to have a little more time at these prices
I'm more interested in the downward trending slope in volume \(in USD\) and what the implications are. For example, is that typical for consolidation periods? Is that typical of the bear side of a bubble? etc.
people actually don't care about crypto, except those looking for quick money, and those looking to take that money from them. pretty simple if you ask me
The situation can change in 5 mins but I agree it does not look too promising at the moment.
Thanks so much appreciate the reply!! 
I am more of what you call a HODLer I guess...

Oh yeah, it can go either way. Just sick of people make "definitive" claims about what Bitcoin is going to do. Let's all agree none of us know jack shit about what the price will do. 
Yes he was making some pretty confident calls three weeks ago, and if you didn't agree or make a call, it's because you don't know how to trade. 
A little Hype is good to spread the news but too much leads to Spikes and Dips
True :) 
Hopefully many more Green ones in the next few hours. 
Ay it's a Novograts paraphrase! Let the burden of prescision rest with him. 
Thanks. Man. What does ping mean?
I thought I smelled fresh bull in the air. Thanks for the confirmation. 
Is there any basis or logic that led you to your opinion?
It's amazing that life saving treatment is only for the rich in certain countries considered more developed.
A proper challenge of 8.1 support. When it confirms support there, the rally starts. https://www.tradingview.com/x/q3QQmfpF/
Yeah I'd sell if I were him...
lol true!!
lol

Keep the GF until you get the lambo, then dump that bitch and trade up. Don't hodl bitches; hodl crypto.
this only works if your are ugly.
[deleted]
Pretty much this.
I don’t even think this is a short squeeze, when you look at the Bitfinex short chart shorts have actually gone up a bit.
How does it "work" then?
How does my wallet authenticate the coin I receive?
Or is it more correct to say how does the Blockchain authenticate this transaction?
They did ask for a 12 word phrase... is that the seed to the private key?
Thhrrrpp. ELI5 is fine, I already feel dum
I actually saw a big fat rocket going into Uranus!
Not true, and you contradict yourself. EVERYONE wants quick money, except for you, right?
yeah, we’ll see a massive volume increase once it breaks out but no one seems to want to take the plunge first 
WTH dude 
lol
But what *exactly* does it mean?

I guess, someone was forced to buy Bitcoin for 8 million dollars at 8421, because his short position got liquidated. But I'm not sure...
Trying to predict a 100% speculation market is sheer stupidity.  It's like trying to do a TA of a roulette table.
There are ways to trade this without prediction. Bitcoin is much weaker than I expected it to be this year. So ja I was wrong. But I've taken a step back, considered this a bit more. Now I'm going to black box the farker with focus on trading the volatility. 
probably that was all :D
The left hand player in a game of ping-pong.
Predicting BTC price is just a guessing stuff anyway. 
*In my opinion*, we just left or are about to leave the E wave of the corrective trend and are starting a new market cycle with Wave 1. 

There might be one more corrective subwave, but maybe not. Low volume is an indicator for it, though.

Look here at "Horizontal Triangles". The highest point is our "All time high".

On the 4h chart:

>**Wave 1**: Wave one is rarely obvious at its inception. When the first wave of a new bull market begins, the fundamental news is almost universally negative. The previous trend is considered still strongly in force. Fundamental analysts continue to revise their earnings estimates lower; the economy probably does not look strong. Sentiment surveys are decidedly bearish, put options are in vogue, and implied volatility in the options market is high. Volume might increase a bit as prices rise, but not by enough to alert many technical analysts.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_wave_principle
Yeah. Worst is no one offered any advice. I guess they are all sceptical, maybe I should just start a thread with all the proof instead. 
Good job for calling that bear trap at 8k
so you are saying that it will drop to 8.1 and then bounce back up?  how high?  when?

Somewhere between 8m and 80k if he was leveraged 100:1, which is quite likely. He probably made way more in previous trades, so he was probably gambling for fun here. It's still satisfying to see such big shorts get liquidated since it moves the market though. There's a reason this isn't allowed in many forex markets, iirc 50:1 often is the limit.

Probabilities change upon circumstances right? Or should I keep my head in my ass, and stick to a theory?
