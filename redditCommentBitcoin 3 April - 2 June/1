Daily Discussion, June 02, 2018 -- TITLE
It's not about being excited simply because there was a $200 lift in price. It's about phscology and confirmation that the doom and gloom being broadcasted by the banker's perspective is total crap.
Plus, we hear institutional money is coming. We hear a bull run may be coming. Everyone is waiting for the signal, for a sign.
Then when the timing lines up, and we see a few lifts, buyer confidence rises. Everyone jumps on board the same time and the bull run is initiated. 
That's what happened last December. It was volume of small investments, not big players that created the December 20k ath.
My point? To hell with TA, and to hell with close minded banker-minded complacency. Phscology RULES the results.
**COME ON BULLS!**
We need to start preparations for a big celebration when this sub hits 1 million subs, we may be just a couple of months away (or earlier if there is a rally). General bullish sentiment is turning, I still think we will brake ATH before years end.
Pumps and dumps or not, the daily chart is starting to look quite nice
Change is in the air.
is there a discord for this subreddit?
I went to Tangier Island yesterday.   I wish direct sale of Blue Crab with Bitcoin could help this struggling fishery.  
...a BTC pump is underway - I can feel it...
What do you folks expect over the next few days? 
time 2 buy
any help guys. my kid wants to buy some BTC could i just buy her a hard wallet? do you need to age vitrifaction as shes under 18 and id rather she legally own it herself?
Buy now, or is it just a dead cat mouse?
Someone is trying hard to help us get out this rut.
An hour later than normal a pump from Asia, then an hour later than usual a pump in Europe, I expect an hour later than usual a pump from USA. I think we are at 7800 within 10 hours. and then again the dump on Sunday
I don't understand;  we've already been to the moon. Mars is the target. 
I want to accept bitcoin and lightning in my bricks and mortar store. I am happy keeping the funds in BTC. We use windows PCs. What would people recommend as software? Any easy to follow guides out there?
Zipping up my moonsuit and radiation-proofing my space Lambo.
Strong upward momentum forming, ladies and gentlemen hold on to your hats we have a recovery!

What is McAfee going to eat when his 15k June prediction is wrong?
Let's reach 10k boys!
If anyone is interested in supporting the REAL Bitcoin Core (a troll of Roger's troll - although a perfectly valid coin) here's the link to find out and buy.  Only about 3 USD at the mo. - with all the functionality of Bcash ..

We will never see prices below $7.5K again. 
Pump cus of payday then crash on sunday-early next week?
Whales form up Bart formation
So, how do I run a LN node on win10 where my bitcoin node is on 24/7?

We've just broken through the downtrend resistance line (log chart). 

Things are looking up now.

Nice pump. I saw it starting at Binance, and then the whole Website was frozen again and again. Good sign.
:) Whales try to pump but there is no movement
Anyone also got the bug on coincap app in android? Bitcoin doesn't show up
Trash volume as usual
We will either enter a 2 year bearmarket or hit 15k this month.
My friends say buy bitcoin! and use words like moon and lambo but I have no regrets. Just bought this bad boy.

You guys are really hopeful over such little upward movement it’s kinda funny
How long until bitcoin gets out of this stable flag? Been seeing a lot of these flags ever since bitcoin is starting its next bull run. 90% of the time it's stuck in flags, 10% of the time it shoots up or down instantaneously. 
Hi, dear cryptonauts. I am new at TA... can someone help, please? On 1 hour chart, does it look like a bull flag? Thank you for your support.

I’m not negative I’m just conservative

**Triangle Phinance: https://redd.it/8mwx6z**
I’ve got a question about the scaling debate of bitcoin. Some people argue that raising the block size can cause an increase in centralization due to the block chain growing in size faster as each block takes up more storage space. This means it could be more expensive to run a node? The hard drives we can buy today are a lot cheaper, faster and higher storage than the ones we had years ago when bitcoin started so this doesn’t seem like a valid argument.

Seems like even r/bitcoin is dying.  

I remember the panic posts when the price was down.  Even these are gone.  Only the regular die hards left.

.... Another sign of desperation - Crypto "hedge funds" coming out in doves to tell us to buy.  Those in the financial sector will know that top hedge fund managers don't go public - they work for top dogs on stealth deals (usually to screw the majority).
 You probably want to spellcheck that. 
Down trend until late June. 
You’re wrong. It wasn’t about volume of small investments. It was volume of whale pumping. You really underestimating their potential and cash flow in manipulating cryptocurrency.
Really. Hard to short if it meanders aimlessly under 7,000 \-\- need at least 8,000 to have much confidence that it is being artificially pumped again.
Well if we get a cross on the 6h, the daily will look even better.
What the hell are you talking about boy? Just use cash!! Not that hard to turn bitcoin in to cash if you really want to help them. For starters, anything that starts with Island is a bad thing. Look at Hawaii right now. They will be the first to be destroyed by volcanoes and the ice melting. Might want to take to higher ground.
A downward Bart Simpson is coming, I can feel it. Maybe I’m just jaded. 
moon with a slight chance of lambos
Bill Gates will dump the market.
Random volatility. It’ll be awhile before the weak hand speculation transfers to strong hand speculation. 
Weird hype
tbh, I haven't a clue. Volume is non-existent, I am sitting it out, I'll buy on a drop & sell a bit if it goes up, BUT it is boring as hell right now
Buy high, sell low.
No need for hard wallet for smallish amounts.  
You can buy it for her and send it an address she owns. A hardware wallet is always a good idea (especially for long time holding) but it would be kind of overkill to buy an 80 dollar wallet for 50 dollars worth of coins for example. 
Who legally owns a ten dollar bill? Just buy the Bitcoin and give her the private keys and voilà the Bitcoin are hers. Welcome aboard :)
ATM
this is adorable
Maybe one of those dead mouse bounces?

Or a dead mouse bouncing off a cat?
I believe it's the real deal but I think first it will bounce off the new 'support' at 7.650/7.660.
We crash landed and have been stranded for last couple of months with no rescue in sight.

Got it?
I would start with an app like Bread - BRD on your phone, if you are serious about storing currency use a ledger hardware wallet. 
When did he hit the public with that prediction?
If I remember correctly, he said *by* June. So he's already wrong.
maybe not, I think 8.5 is ok 
Shilling?
I want it, where I can buy it?
I cannot find a lot of information about BTCC I like to do my research before 'investing'

Is there any decent links/Reddit sub etc?
You want a 6.7k don't you
Famous last words?
Don't jinx it 
It does seem to be a remarkably strong support line.
Nope, 6h chart is where the action is.  Market is trying to reverse.
Not if 6h crosses,  if it holds until the afternoon, things will get interesting.

Yes, it's real.  $100
You pissed them off ><
No we're gonna do this slowly but steadily for once.
Edit: probably 3 to 4 more hours till the next pump. Just my guess.
Has Roger acquired it?
I've seen around 3.5k the other day :=)
Or something in between
people who are hopeful are also often funnier than negative people
Name checks out.
It’s the timing of the upward movement.  The market is signaling a reversal.  It’s not that little bump we care about, it’s the big one that may come within a day or two, based on market indicators.
What bull run?
TA isnt real. You might as well go to a palm reading.
Which means you support walls and negativity.  Jk jk. But seriously. Bull Run 2018....
Yes storage is relatively cheap but there is also the bandwidth cost to run a node. The time it takes to download the whole chain to initialize a node. Increasing the block size is a naive approach because those doesn’t scale easily. 

As for storage, since there is no incentive to run a node, you want the hardware to be cheap to acquire and to run.
In addition to hdd size and bandwith, there's also the issue of bigger block propagation time which gives an advantage to miners with higher hash rate, which can in turn lead to further mining concentration. 
cheaper and faster and higher storage are all true IF you can always afford to upgrade (maybe you can, but think of really poor countries) . Even so, if we just keep increasing the blocksize, at some point regular users will not be able to run a full node. the goal is to keep the network as light as possible for anyone, anywhere. scaling can take place on layer 2 without putting pressure on the main net. Segwit and lightning are here and work great, I would think the great scaling debate is maybe finally coming to an end.
Whoa - you are **dodgy.**
Maybe time to leave ?
Quiet before the storm. 
So you want people posting "to the moon!!" and "here comes my lambo!!" over and over again on a daily basis? Everything seems pretty dandy to me. 
Well when the sub only has 3 good memes that get reposted every day, people leave. There are other forums to discuss price and get the latest info on bitcoin and blockchain. 
Lol
When the forum gets full of bores like you who think they know everything people think why bother posting.
more alive than ever. confidence never been as high.
Harder to fractionalize cash into smaller amounts.   I don't have 30 million.  I also believe the crab industry could do well to develop a direct to customer approach to increase margins.   Bitcoin payments could help in that way.   The same way agriculture needs a hand sometimes,  these watermen are in a bad way.   They are basically getting squeezed by inexpensive foreign crab.   You categorically dislike island's?   Hawaii will get help when the lava flows.
Lol
How long do you think?

and around 1% is me (and I am dong about nothing)
why do you think are you doing haha!!
2 weeks ago lol
Just checked, he said bitcoin will hit 15k *in* june, and dip in july.
Of course.  I will shill anything that undermines RogerCoin.

Financial interest - around 100 USD, out of tens of thousands.  So no.

It is the principle that matters to me.
Exchange link at the site above.
Yeah, give this guy your bitcoin for some other shit coin that will dump after  this post is forgoten
Fingers crossed I've had enough Bart patterns at this moment
step by step
Or something lower, or maybe higher? Who knows
Tea leaves.
Or train your pet monkey to throw darts at a chart.
Ha ha. Thank you mdk72002. Yes TA is not science at all, however, it seems that if enough believers... the crap becomes realty 😀. Sometimes. Respect.🙌

Next to that, one should never forget that while you may be able to afford a cheap hard drive and good connection, some places around the globe have way lower income and internet is capped. So increasing the blocksize max not directly affect you but will definitely affect many people in other countries. As we are talking about a global currency, that really matters.

That’s unfortunately a common fallacy here. It’s easy to assume everyone on reddit is accustomed to the comforts of the west but in reality the world is an incredibly diverse place and such differences are enormous.
I'm just waiting for a sudden crash to 6k and the FOMO to rush in again.
I think you just have problems accepting the fact that interest in BTC is dying.
Absolutely.  I was awed by that $150 pump.  Awesome.  Zzzzzzz.

Even the stock market is more exciting at this time.

If the next major spike up must be speculation-driven like 2017 then we would probably have wait a long time like 1-3 years. This should be enough time for people who got burned to lick their wounds and let big investors feel more brave.

That being said, I don't think the next major spike up will be as much speculation-driven. I think if the right mix of a political/macroeconomic event + greater availability to institutions will lead to a *real* bull run. This can happen really at any time. If investors don't especially want to sell then we can see a major spike up like 5-10x or more. I also wouldn't expect this to be the last major bull run for bitcoin either.
what exchange did you use?

May as well have a dabble at that price
MtGoxistotesfineeverybodycoin
Barts on the 1h are signaling that the market is trying to reverse on the 6h, so they’re good signs.
Also increasing the block size doesn't solve the scaling issue. Even a 1TB blocksize doesn't come close to a major payment processor and you've lost all decentralization. 
Indeed, In my country “limitless” ADSL internet plan is limited to 500Go of data volume of “fair usage”. That’s a 50euro a month internet connection. Even in a developed country internet might be capped. I’m looking into running a BTC node but the data volume is already too much. Increase in block size would definitely not help
Or the sudden jump to 8.8k
I think a crash to 4k is needed for that
So little interest in BTC the price won’t drop below 7000?  Please, the speculators may be gone, bitcoin may be stabilizing, but interest in bitcoin is just fucking fine.
The interesting thing is that there are enough holders now to keep the market propped above 7k, seemingly.  Every spike seems to create more holders.
There's only one, it is listed at the coin's website listed above.
Right. The thought that increasing the blocksize would solve all capacity issues would be akin to try scaling the internet by opening up all the roads and just putting additional copper lines down there. Internet got as efficient and fast as it is now through new technologies (e.g. fibre), improved compression algorithms, better and cheaper CPU’s to support that... just doubling the phone lines would only have helped a small bit.
That will be good for current owners but it won't create the needed FOMO. 
If it ever drops to 4k, it won't be FOMO.

It will be FOLE - Fear of Losing Everything.

Then it won't stop at 4k, it will spiral to the deep depths as most people will be trying to cut losses with little buyers.  I.e. bubble burst.
Really?  Hmmm, let's see.

Compared to the Top 10 Cryptos, BTC is last in both 24-hour and 7-day.  Want to hear more?
Yeah especially since volume right now (according to Blockchain charts) is back to mid-2017 levels, meanwhile price is multiples higher. We got a lot more holders.
ok can you deposit fiat or is it coins only
Assuming there aren't actors that can drive the price down gradually avoiding that FOLE
No, compared to the top 10 how many are 20% the value of bitcoin?  How many have ever been 20% the value of bitcoin?  
Check the site!

AFAIK it is only a BTC/BTCC pair.
The boiling frog.
True, BTC is 37.5% of market cap ....

... but accounts for only 27% of daily trades.  

Sorry dude, interest is clearly moving to the alts.
ok cheers ears
.
Speculation is moving to the alts, for now, but bitcoin is the only one with any level of public adoption.  The only one with any potential to be accepted as payment for goods and services on a broad scale.  The only one I can walk across the street and buy coffee with in the morning.  The only one with any interesting development happening around it.
