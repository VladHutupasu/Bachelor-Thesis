Daily Discussion, April 25, 2018 -- TITLE
OMG.  The last time we saw the price of bitcoin this low was yesterday evening.
Just threw $100 into btc. I know it’s not much but I’m new and wanna see what it does... learn how the apps work and what not... any advice?
The last two times the price plummeted like this we later found out it was a whale selling btc in 50 million dollar increments.  It wasn't futures market related, and it wasn't a macro U.S. tax day approaching sell.  Both times the market shook it off and continued its climb back up.
Just bought .03270172 of BTC since I don't think we're falling out of the 9,000 mark. If we do, well I'll just buy some more :). My goal is to have one full bitcoin before 2018 ends. Wish me luck.
finally on the front page again
To those of you who are worried about today’s dip, let’s put things into perspective. In November 2017, when prices were still around 10-11k, this is what we saw between Nov 28 and Dec 2.

https://i.imgur.com/vW3BIa1.jpg

The price fluctuated between 11.2k and 9.5k in a matter of a few days. It fully recovered and resumed its ascent.

This general pattern repeated itself several times during the bull run up to 20k. If you are trading, sure, take advantage of the dip, but to anyone thinking this is Mayday, try to put things into perspective, and realize that we can’t go up daily ad infinitum. Price corrections are healthy and necessary. The market needs to breathe. Don’t panic (unless  you’re in super high leverage with no cover :)
"REFORM THE LINE!" ~ King Theoden
Why are people fucking panicking? Upward growth with no correction is incredibly unhealthy. Just chill out and do something else and don't watch the price.
4 months in and still 40% down. I’d say I’m enjoying the ride but that would be a lie. 
The only positive thing out of this is that we will see Vegeta meme again.
Are we happy to float around $9k for a day or two?
That moment you realize big money, and not people holding .5 coins chanting 'hodl', controls the market. 
Don't panic folks, we expected a pull back around $10k, let us see how today pans out first.  We have still made lots of progress over the last few weeks.  Peace. 
Anyone else sell around 9400 and buy back in around 9700 yesterday? Fml, I shoulda waited like I usually do for the dip but the FOMO got to me when 10k was so close but so far away
GDAX is $200 below any other exchange, weak hands af
How are we down today with this Nasdaq news...the fact that they are open to becoming a crypto exchange at some point is huge news, no?
Hold the McAffee Dick Line at all costs!

I went all in yesterday

I am currently down on my initial investment 5&#37;

Might buy some more fuck it

#YOLO
I don’t actually see a lot of panic posts but sooo many “why is everyone panicking” posts lol projection 
Even in a bull run there will be bearish days, don't be alarmed over 1 bad day, if you try to time out the market you'll likely miss out on gains, just sit tight and you'll be fine in the long run
Waiting for 9K memes 
**Keep going Bulls.**
I know we are striving for decentralization and idealogs like Antonopoulos feel its worth the wait but human beings are well, human beings. They rarely give more than 3-4 chances. Fees need to be low. Lightning needs to grow significantly bigger. How do we get there by August? 
Why is it going down so much? Complete opposite of yesterday...
You all have very short memories (I call it digital dementia) A couple of weeks ago it was at 6.8k. It drops down to 8.5 after a pump and everyone freaks the fuck out. If it drops below 6.5k then there is a real reason to FREAK THE FUCK OUT. 
By the way. Sometimes people just wanna buy and sell shit. If someone makes a big dump- guess what?People are BUYING IT.
Remember when bitcoin was supposed to be a currency rather than a speculative investment?
Just want to do a shout out to Europe here. 

Thanks for nothing dudes. My grandma does more volume than you guys. And she died ten years ago.
So many newbies on this feed. Check BTC on the way up to $20k in December and every other day there was $1,000 dips 
Back by popular demand.....

**Come On The Bulls.**
One thing is for sure. Bitcoin traders are a bunch drama queens. Even worse than SAT divers. 
welp, time to bring out the ramen again.
[deleted]
**Come On Bulls!** 
So a third of the progress made in the last eighteen days has been lost in a few hours. Nice.
Dumping like a mothafucka....
**Come On Bulls!** 
Whales' theme song:

"This Is How We Do it"
Bitfinex is almost at 9k again, while gdax is at 8750 lol
This looks like a shakedown for weekhands
Coinbase FOMO unravelling once again.
The whole trade is very chaotic. Big price difference among different exchanges and huge fluctuations. No one has any fucking idea what’s gonna happen next. 
It was all a manipulation to shake out weak hands. It'll be back to 9500k by the end of the day. 
its always up, then gone down, then up & down :D stop caring, enjoy your life for a while :D
Just remember: Time in the market beats timing the market.

Think long term. If you act short term, you might make a lot of money, but it's more likely that you will get rekt.
Vegeta is coming again....
Here we go again...
9k for the 6th time, lel.
Prepare the 9k memes ... Just saying :)
Seems like sentiment has changed for the better. We’ve been from 11k back to 6ish not too long ago. Then it was pretty much straight down. Now it seems we turn old resistance into new support. 

So let’s see if we can get to 12k before the next significant dip. (If today’s dip is over I don’t consider it significant in crypto terms)
1 day chart and 15 min chart on GDAX looks reeeeally similer
come on ASIA, wake up and start the pump!
130 million Tether have been minted today.

https://www.omniexplorer.info/address/1NTMakcgVwQpMdGxRQnFKyb3G1FAJysSfz
Ffs why did I buy at 9.5 fully knowing I should wait and that was hasty 
I’m not veteran of anything really except sleeping and waking up but I’ve bought and sold BTC 3 times. I’ve sold when it’s nit high enough every time.  Gotta hold on.  
At 3:00 am Eastern time there is usually a reversal. 
Good morning Europe!

What are your plans for today?
This is a bear trap. Going up again...

Edit: Or maybe not...
[deleted]
Goddam it's depressing in here, This can still turn around, we only lost 2 days of gains.
It doesn't matter whether or not BCH is superior to BTC. The deception going on with the way it is promoted is unethical and bad for crypto as a whole. Would the words "scam," "fraud," or "misleading" inspire confidence in new investors or adopters in this technology? I'm pretty new to this, so in would say as a newbie in the game, it definitely brings me feelings of uncertainty.

Edit: grammar
This all started with a $200-$300 jump within 10 minutes, what were you really expecting? You’d think after these last few months more people would have developed a healthy amount of skepticism lol 
I would have sold my bitcoin, except:

1. I believe in it, apart from making a profit.

2. I realized it's way easier to buy altcoins with than USD.

3. It has a great record of going up in value long term. Though I think annual gains can't be as extreme as it's been (if it continues the way it has it'll be worth the entire world's real estate in 8 years), it'll still increase long term in value, probably better than most stocks.

4. If I hold USD long term I KNOW FOR A FACT it will lose value over time. Even in a savings account.

Having said that, If I were one of those people that took out a $40,000 credit card and needs the value to exceed 10K or they'll go bankrupt... I might consider selling, as there's no guarantee it will exceed 10K real soon.
Just get your cheap coin while you can imo
Damn ,gotta cancel my lambo order again (sademoji)
No exchange or wallet provider has deployed Segwit support in several weeks. Coinbase tried but failed. WTF?

Still at 22 deployed: https://bitcoincore.org/en/segwit_adoption/
[deleted]
You have seen square pump\-and\-dumps \(the Bart\), so to spice things up, here are triangular ones \(the Lisa\).
Random observation of the day; when I see whales stocking up on certain altcoins after a sizeable bitcoin fall, I know where my bets will be. The price sure may drop some more still, but I am not going to venture out in the wrong direction when bulls hit the streets.
https://www.coindesk.com/10k-on-hold-as-bitcoin-sees-price-pullback/

View

**Bitcoin remains on the hunt for a bullish break above the $10,000 mark.**

There is a risk of a pullback to $8,650-$8,600 in the short-term.

Only a close below the ascending 10-day MA at $8,671 would abort the short-term bullish view.
The battle happening at 8800 right now is intense!
Damn i really gotta stop playing with my buy orders, shoulda held for the dip! 
I had a feeling this would happen.  Went up too fast.  Slow and steady finishes the race eventually. On the bright side, my money will be transferred soon and I can BTFD. 
Get Vegeta memes ready....
This shit is swinging too fast. Its like a hot knife on rampage. 
And we're back
9k :D

Pump dat pump!!!!
Lol the 24h Volume on BTC/GBP on gdax is over 800! Usually it's 2-300! The weak are selling!

Remember guys, don't put in more than you can afford to lose, stay safe and may the luck of the spooky skeleton be with you!
How many of those power reader google glasses things has Vegeta broke by now?
This new reddit theme takes some getting used to
Fancy a good laugh?

Vegeta, whats bitcoin price?
855-875-cash. Buy the dip! Lol
I really don't see it falling too far.  wouldn't make sense to drop much lower than 8700-ish
Is this considered a dip or a crash?  Being it has went down around $850 dollars since yesterday.
This just in....... Bitcoin is Volatile. *gasp* 
Right now the seller side is like "No nine thousand for you!"
http://www.livebitcoinnews.com/gemini-teams-up-with-nasdaq-to-monitor-market-for-abusive-trading-practices/

I leave it to you guys to decide what will happen when Gemini/Nasdaq starts to detect and publicise all the obvious price manipulations on bitfinex, binance, etc.

Don't forget it was the Winklevoss that earlier called for a formal investigation into Tethers.
Just got off the phone with the lambo dealer and told him my down payment wouldn’t be ready til next month.  “Thats funny” he said, 5 others just called and said the same thing.
**Come On America and the Rest Of The World, let us keep this at around $9400 for today!**
Why can't it just keep going up every day? Like Burger King, I want it my way. If it doesn't go to 10k by week's end,  then I'm selling it all. I will then proclaim that everyone vested in crypto is a fool and that Bitcoin is dead. Waaaaaaahh!
ever seen the walls so thin on both sides? this is a shakedown kiddos before we rocket, you sold you lost
9k!

Where are the Vegeta memes?
And another dump. So much for it having a decent recovery before closing.
It dropped because I bought, just wait a few days until I get FUD and sell, then it will spike.
I see. Thanks for the explanation.
Yeah. This isn't looking good as usual after a nice run up. Maybe next month. McAfee is totally wrong with his $1,000,000 estimate lol.

It'll stop going down at 8.2k. I'm basing this off nothing. Just a naive prediction.
Just ordered two kilograms of vegeta from my local grocery store. 
You're all so short-term it's hilarious, zoom out to the year scale you autists.
**What a great time to be alive, Banks imploding and Bitcoin ascending.** 
On your knees 😏
I bought the dip. Good luck to you all.
all that progress thrown awayy 
anyone got the 8888.88 memes?
So who here fell for the obvious bull trap?
I aint sellin!!!! hodl
I suppose last Friday of the month is near :(
What the heck is going on
Wait an hour or two until east coast joins the party, they decide where we're heading.
I'm hoping some of the pull back is a bear trap.  I was kind of hoping we would atleast hold around $9400-$9500.

**Come On Bulls, don't throw this all away!**
Weird thing about bitcoin price dropping...

It causes altcoin prices to drop immediately in value... 

Which causes altcoin holders to want bitcoin or USD, thereby increasing the value of bitcoin.
Zomfg, last time to buy under 9152 since it’s the limp dick Fibonacci Lin e
I sent some BTC last night:
txid: 891ef41a7a056120b615191386b69199877d456957f6174439d4f737e8e7ab12

first time it's ever sat unconfirmed like that. I know in 2 weeks I'll probably get it back if miners don't mine it but is there a way to speed up the transaction at all?
So is there any chance it's going to get back to at least 9500 today?
What are y'all forcasting those of you who are pretty good at reading the charts
7d  14d and 30d  look awesome  still
I sent some BTC to Binance about 1 hour ago, sent from a ledger nano selecting the normal fee, nothings been confirmed yet, anybody tried sending lately? 

wondering if i'm going to have to wait a few hours or days until it gets confirmed, I figured I would have been ok using the normal fee, I sent another one with (high fee) to make it go faster, stressful when my coins floating around the blockchain! 
Funnily enough the Alts have stopped falling. Some time ago. 
we still up, still have moving average crossed on 1d.
 hill before the mountain 
I feel like Cleveland, watching Bitcoin slip below 9k this morning...

lol, Murica full retard. 
RIP 
wow lol 
well lets hope 8.4k holds. Otherwise its real deep penetration to 7.8 then 6.8-6.5k
$1000 drop in 12 hours; can't make this stuff up. I love you, Bitcoin. 
ohhh shit here we come 8600
Here come the panic sellers, bit late to sell now people. Best of luck though. 
I'm taking screenshot now of the top comments, then I'll take another when btc stops falling. It's just amazing how the same people can change their minds so fast.
Problem with smart contracts? LETS DUMP BITCOIN >.> silly
what the fuck just happened? it's below $8k? 
Big red dildo for that a hole
Hey fellas, coming back for a little Live Bitcoin Price action update and perhaps some live trading sprinkled in if the opportunity arises. Open discussion format for anyone interested.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6\_WRBC9qQE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_WRBC9qQE)
What the hell happened? 😨
Does anyone know what's the normal transaction fee now? 
Put 7 satoshies per byte (total fee 2$ something dollars) for a quite big transaction, it's been unconfirmed for over 1 hour now.

The fuck is everyone whinging about lol
Funny how it drops during us market open.
PUMP
[deleted]
Wish I could say I thought this was the last time bitcoin would have to push past 9k...but let’s be real it probably isn’t. I do think that day is rapidly approaching though
And back under 9k.
Any reason for the mempool growing so large?  Have an unconfirmed from this morning when 2 sats was a reasonable fee!
I can't believe it - the alts are pumping again.

Very strange market behaviour.
Go to sleep Vegeta
5:00am in Tokyo. 

Some people wake up early, check the price and think: Wow! Cheap coins. Buy, buy, buy!
6:20am in Tokyo *and* Seoul.

Asians start to FOMO.
Upside down Bart formation?
hodl on !
My equity is up 6% in the last 2 or 3 hours, so I think we can presume things are starting to turn. 
HOLD (anag.)
Yea can we just pin vegeta to the top of this sub. Saves us posting him like 3 times a week ay
First ipad 2010. 
want 2 b my roommate? I Think you really need 1
Below 9k AGAIN. Yay!
I just sold the shit I've been hodling since January when I got it when it was 15k (I didn't buy I just receive payments in it). Whole 2017 I've fucking sold the same hour I received and was butthurting remembering how April 2017 I've sold 2 BTC for some shitting 2 thousands or so. Then all of the sudden I decide to hodl in January and here we are now... 

But I've sold all of it (I need money anyway this month, so probably it wont hit 10k in April again), so expect ALL TIME HIGH knowing my luck. You welcome guys

I just hate that I didn't sold 12 hours ago at 9700 :(
Literally no reason to be holding now
Whales know how to set up bear traps on land. The end is near folks. Hide yo kids and wives.
What in the actual fuck?
This is just discount.
HODL?
Thank you America!  
HODLers right now: https://fearlessliving.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/2-free-fall.jpg

[deleted]
Hope we find somewhat support at 9k. Otherwise there’s a real chance to go to 8.8 then 8.4k. I’m getting real tired of being dragged back into the butthole.

Obviously thats where everyone likes to be. This is retarded.
rip 9000 lol
RIP 9k
I can handle a slight pull back but this is taking the piss! 
You guys all got jebaited. The price is too easily manipulated by the whales.
lol last night i sold everything and just got back in I knew a 2 week streak had to be corrected at some point. Next bull run is gonna be even better.
Well I guess Asia started waking up about an hour ago. 
There is again heavy resistance at the cock gobble line of resistance. Macaffee is on track to cannibalize his cock on tv in about 30 months.
I ain’t selling lol fuhhhhhh dat
TIMBER!!
[deleted]
It was pumped to dump. Get used to it dropping.
Last chance to sell before 5k
[deleted]
Look on the bright side. You can all post your 'over 900' memes again in a month
Told you guys to get out while you can, gonna be buying around 5k
As Professor Frink would say: "Oh, glayven!"
good to go down, chance to come in again ..... discount
Come On New York!  
F**K and I believed in 10k in next few days.
Should've sold on 9700
[deleted]
this is not correction ..this is panic sell ...any bad news? why this huge dip 
9k soon, get ready to celebrate.
Bitcoin is the best way to purchase:

Blockchains

It's not true that it's not good for buying things. 
LAST CHANCE FOR CHEAP BITCOIIN
After consulting my crystal ball, if the price continues to increase (closing doesn't need to be in the green) and the lower candlestick is as long, or longer, as it is now then that signifies a bullish trend.
[deleted]
Converting fiats into BTC :-D Its good time to buy lol.. I can say that it will  catch up $10k by the mid of May. 
Oh MT. Gox moved some BTC... About 2k..

Why are they still allow to sell?
8690 and falling :(

Any guesses folks for the bounce?
First?
Entire rally was on the back of the short squeeze back at 6.8k so we will be returning there to carry on the downtrend
This is honestly so fucking pathetic for bitcoin lol.
Oh noes. BTC price prediction: $800 EOY

[deleted]
Sold at 9700 and made a nice profit, anyone who thought it wouldn’t be bouncing around the 9000s for a few days before 10k was delusional
[deleted]
What’s Bitcoins utility? How do you guys se it being used in 10-20 years?
[removed]
Have fun.  Watch it go up and down like Stormy Daniels.  Post 'To the moon', 'Lambo', and 'Come on bulls'.  And generally have a laugh as you descend into mental breakdown.  :)
I'd recommend putting in $50-$100 a week and try to time it with a dip. It will slowly keep rising. If you buy for one month let's say 8,900 then the following month you buy at an average of 7,000. When that next pump happens and it jumps back to 8,900 or higher than your already making a profit. I look at is as a savings acct. A very risky one at that. You should have your safe one in a bank, 401k, etc and also have a small side one of crypto. In time it will grow, especially if you keep pumping Fiat into your wallet. It won't hurt and one day you will be surprised how much you've ammassed. It also is an addictive way to put money away and makes you want to save more in life. 
Just relax - buy more in the dips and you should make money. Been a crazy day with + 100, -100 in the same minute. Kept me busy;)
What kind of advice are you looking for regarding apps?
Good luck.
*Arise, arise, Riders of Théoden!
Fell deeds awake: fire and slaughter!

With that he seized a great horn from Guthláf his banner-bearer, and he blew such a blast upon it that it burst asunder. And straightway all the horns in the host were lifted up in music, and the blowing of the horns of Rohan in that hour was like a storm upon the plain and a thunder in the mountains.

*Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!*

Suddenly the king cried to Snowmane and the horse sprang away. Behind him his banner blew in the wind, white horse upon a field of green, but he outpaced it. After him thundered the knights of his house, but he was ever before them

Once more unto the beach, dear pals, once more.
I don't think this is upgrowth but one or a few entities wash trading the price up, then lining up buyers then selling.
thanks, captain obvious
relax brother, crypto is still at the beginning and youll have to wait maybe a few years till u get huge gains. 
Heh yea its almost still funny 
it’s almost kind of pathetic though lol, how many times are we really going to celebrate 9k? 
Yes please. Still waiting for my money to transfer 
[deleted]
You get enough people holding .5 coins and “the whales” lose their power.
I'm panic hodling.
I just hodl.
Is there any place where we can see all these expected pull backs?
same happened to me :( 
REKT lol
America, I am disappoint. 
Just noticed Coin Base is showing $8600 and Bitfinex is showing $8800., it’s usually the same or if anything Coin base is always higher . Have never Seen a $200 price difference.
Yeah that is odd, not sure why that is happening today.
Oh yeah wtf? Thats a huge price difference!
As soon as this bottoms out it might be arbitrage time if I can find a return coin close enough in price or arbitrage the other direction.
can imagine that lots of ppl selling due to that smart contract erc20 token stuff 
2019 year, this day, this month --> BTC will be 50k :D or 250k :D
 went all in.... might buy some more.... so you didn't go all in. 
Why would you buy at the 2 month high?
RIP
cos people are panicking themselves then trying to convince themselves otherwise by accusing everyone else of panicking.
Those who panic they call others panicking. 
Hang on, you know that a bull is someone who fucks a dude's girl, right?
Came here to say this. Namely how will this get adopted when people will routinely game the system.
Why do we need to get there by August?
the problem with bitcoin is a lot people who dont know how investing works are in this market, they expect it to only go up or only down, which is not the case in any market, but they don't understand, so when they see it go down a bit everyone panics and what should be a small dip turns into a crash, same thing in other direction, people see it go up and they all jump on because they don't want to miss out. People need to learn that time in the market is much better than timing the market. If you truly believe in what your investing in, then buy it and don't worry about short term numbers, but its hard to not worry about short term numbers when the masses move the market so much because they are too reactionary instead of longing like they should be
Just a big bart forming.
The exact opposite reason of why it went up so much yesterday. That's how prices work.
Gotta have a pullback after days and days of upward movement. bulls take profit after driving it up 2k
I don't think a bunch of people were buying. I think it was one a couple more entities wash-trading the price up. I'm not criticizing or complaining about it, but that's what I think it was.
[deleted]
<6.5 is isn't a reason to FREAK THE FUCK OUT either.  Dan Emmons deleted his twitter story about bitcoin plateauing at  $5,000 for two years which will also be the last chance before the institutional money takeoff.  That wouldn't be a bad outcome for HODLers.
Been a few issues around that, most of which have been resolved by the looks of it. Just give it time...
I think it will be a quiet few hours, won't really know much until all of America is awake. 
yeah.. my grandma's orthotics had more support
Watch and learn kiddos *(vet since january 2018)*
It's only down $550 from the 12am GMT open on coindesk.

>vam0808 redditor for 4 days

LOL
**T' Mooooon**
Truth.
^ This.
The chief financial officer of Visa rightly said that his limousine driver, the guy who polishes his shoes etc and criminal talk about bitcoin. He absolutely ridiculed the bitcoiners. Not that I agree with all what he said but yes but many bitcoiners like drama. 
And let’s not forget the spam in a can lol 
Why were you banned?
Nope. I'm still good
nothing bulls, this was a trap .... first back to the 5k.
Then to the moon
Funny - I like your gallows humour!
They are on my burger :P
Get the vegeta memes ready
That is weird
Maybe it's big, smart $ on BFX versus retail through CB/GDAX?
How many time are you gonna repeat that 

Apparently its been happening since 20k to 6k
what about monthhands?
Do you play overwatch??
It was all a manipulation to make money off bag hodlers.
do u really believe the shit you type lol
Easy to say when you already ROI'ed. 
Good luck getting these folks to think long term. They take $2 gains, buy a big Mac, and call it "lambo time".  Honeslty, I'm only here for the hilarious financial advice and chart reviews. 
You realize your advice only applies to a diverse portfolio of staple investments, not a single, speculative asset, right?
I thought I was the only one who noticed! This gives me hope that bitcoin is to some degree, measurable by past data. 

Judging from this... i predict the price will probably go up, unless it goes down.
7am in Tokyo, early ~~birds~~ whales
Yeah, but aint they like 3 days ahead so it would be Saturday over there.  
they started this whole shit
Let them have their breakfast first.
Where were they sent 
Interesting, I haven’t heard of Tether before. The idea seems interesting, however, would it make it easier for governments to track our money? It’s somewhat tough keeping bitcoin away from them.

Fomo
Sell and buy soon.
i feel you :(, this was exactly me yesterday D;
We plan to crash down to 6K ;)
Bunch of clowns getting squeezed into selling.
You mean bull trap 
Why in the world would you think that BTC would hit 11K?
You realise that your only two options aren't crypto and USD, right?
Yep not worrying about petty day trading. As a 30 year old, this is my first major investment. It's locked away on a ledger in my safe. Don't plan on touching it for years 
Only one lambo, instead of two. booo....
I don't care about lambo. When can I finally buy rice and buckwheat with it?
> Coinbase tried but failed

huh?
The possibility of buying back in cheaper and increasing your amount of btc?
Didnt even follow my own advice later in the day and missed out yet again, lol smh. I still appreciate action over inaction any time. 
And bulls are back in town!
REEE ITS CALLED A SCOUTER YOU UNCULTURED SWINE!!!!
/s
We were at 6800 2 weeks ago. This is why this market fails.
Just a dip in the crypto world, anything up or down 5% is considered flat
Depends on if it keeps going down or hits enough resistance to cycle up again.  It’s at least a dip for now.
the price was around 9200 yesterday morning. There were not enough people willing to risk buying when the price started to rise too much above 9000. I'm betting the market will need to test above 9000 a few more times before many people are willing to buy for that price or above. It's a good time to invest in alts imo since they will recover as bitcoin will probably fluctuate up and down within a range
And the buyer side is like "We will get our Nine Thousand!"
They will only be monitoring Gemini's exchange as far as I understand it.

Why do you put multiple bold comments like this and 'come on bulls' on every daily thread? Very annoying and it achieves nothing.
Lol we are lucky if we stay above 940
And I day later it'll shoot up.

Honey, just about the time you're thinkin' it's alright

You're busted
Closing? Bitcoin closes? 
Well you just taught yourself what not to do soooo..
Lol.. Who are you replying to
That will change so quickly. He can be on the right side of it again in 24 hours. 
As an autist I feel offended by your comment.
Autists are likely to be more pragmatic about it.
It doesn't matter where the markets were a year ago; what matters is where they'll be tomorrow.
It's gone down nearly 1k...
healthy correction

Just a correction. 2 weeks of gains minus about 4 days of progress sounds about right. Can't get much lower then this. If it does, we are doomed.
It dropped back to the short term moving avg on the 6hr chart.  It’s not going to launch every day.
its called a correction.... jesus
Profit taking
It'll probably keep going down anyway. 
[deleted]
Is the increase a net increase or increase relative to the droped price though?
Lol..It'l get there just sit tight
[deleted]
totally
Lol no, this is the mother of all bull traps!
If we don’t stay above 9160- We’re going down to 8.5 to 8.8k
Walked a friend through buying their first bitcoin and they're a little panicked as it hasn't appeared in their wallet after 5 hours. There are 20,000 unconfirmed transactions on the backlog currently, never watched it so don't know if that's considered high as it's never taken more than 15 minutes when I've done it.
True, key reversal = the death of bitcoin
um.. nope? between 8750 and 8900, depending on exchange
The Happening

Money happened.
If you look at https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#1,8h you can see that the current fee for the next block is around 80 sats
big amount or big payload?
Who's whinging?

(Apart from you, about people allegedly whinging  :)  )
basically its became normal thing :D what goes down must go up :D
It also started going down right after the smart contract bug
´n DUMP ´n PUMP
A few DAYS?!? That would be awesome but what in the world makes you think that?
The floor keeps increasing after each dip.  

This is good for bitcoin. ™
And back over 9k.
Transaction volume very high today.  Mempool hasn't been this high since 2/28 but still only about 10% of the backlog that was present in Jan.
Have unconfirmed outgoing transaction with 7 sats for like 4 hours already fuck! And I thought 5 sats is pretty fast to get confirmation nowadays. Yesterday received bunch of transactions with 5 sats in minutes...
Also receiving transactions now with 60 sats!!!! and still no confirmations for 1 hour already.

Not so strange. Alts tend to pump before bitcoin pumps. If you are a whale, you buy the alts first, then pump up bitcoin. If you do it the other way around you'll have to pay more for those alts. The alts doesn't affect bitcoin upwards, but the reverse is true. I'll never be a whale but it's logical enough. :\)
Bear trap in action :)
Not strange. When large *"investments"* are made by big-shots, they spread their investment through multiple cryptos. It is a way of making sure that when it's time to get out, there's enough money in multiple markets to close positions without losing profit. 
He must be tired by now...
5:30am in Tokyo. 

More people wake up. Next bull run begins...
yes sir
OMG ! Where is all this money coming from ?! Oh, it's OMG. Errrr.....didn't see that coming. 
Nope, back up again.
One minute of silence to this guy and all the other weak hands who have sold.  
If you need the money the is no shame in cashing out. 
Not luck, just lack of a basic plan. 
Did you ever think that maybe the reason you need money is because you don't know how to handle it in the first place? Ie investing in BTC and selling off at a loss?
cool story bro
If you held this long you will be selling at the possible dip.  Very true it may keep crashing, but if it bounces back it will hurt more to re buy at a higher price.  Don't let the game play you.  Bitcoin is only going up, these price manipulations are mind games that will make the rich richer and keep the average man down.
[RUN!!!](https://gph.is/1USFoCG)
cuztheyraypinerbuddyinhurr
You thought we were going to the moon now?
profit taking, we just passed 9k yesterday. relax 
Acquire bitcoins. Disregard dumping.
my pleasure
I'll bet it's the top lol.
It's all manipulation. No one wants to accept that.
Same.  I'm buying again now.
we broke the cock gobble!
I went all in 9600. Took money out of my Roth IRA.  It's depressing as fuck. 
bitcoin don't care
Lol what? We expecting 10k here dude
🖕🏼
I can sell it for 500
Ehm. What? If you have your own wallet, you have a private key. It doesn't cost anything. 

If you don't have the private key, then it's not your wallet.
Sounds like your 'friend' does not know what he is talking about or is trying to rip you off. 
It's free if you believe
Maybe you should understand what bitcoin is and how to use it before you have your friend send you $28k worth of it,

A private key is free and is something that is created when you make your own bitcoin wallet. 

Coinbase isn't a bitcoin coin wallet, it's just an account that holds your bitcoins in their wallet.
Sounds like his friend is an African Prince who will give you 3 of his 100 bitcoins but he needs a private key and $500 to share them first
Please don’t tell me you sent some random person 27,000 usd for three btc! If so it sounds like you’ve lost it, don’t send anymore. Do t send anyone anything for a key as they are free
Haha ok troll
You also have to buy gas too send it across the network, I'll send you 100 megabits of gas for .1 BTC
the memes are jinxing it
Good luck
Lol
> buying around 5k

Not happening. We'll never touch 5K. 
[deleted]
Bull run? You mean the artificial pump?
I’m not celebrating again until 10k
Okay, I'll bite. Other than making money trading Bitcoin long or short, how exactly do you make money off of "Blockchain"?
dont worry it can go down anytime and much much lower and also upupupupupuppuuppupupup :D you cant predict it much, but basically down-up-down-up-continue bazillions of times like this :D so who wanna buy will buy at the price he/she/it wants
**👌**
That will be its worst year ever. 
You wanted an unregulated security? Here you go.
theyre not selling goddamn it, they consolidated it to a single wallet.. 
6k
Today. Thursday, "Oh shit I haven't made money this week yet, buy something" day. 
now
[deleted]
Maybe but probably not just yet.
Haha you finally bought last night didn't you
I would buy soo much!
Why are you posting someone's prediction they made 4 months ago.

And why is that guy credible? Because he called it right that Bitcoin would go up? That was an easy call to make in a bull run.

Your life must suck so badly
Oh, look who crawled out of his hole again...
Could be a bear trap OR we are doing 1 last small dip before a rally.
Na  support is at 8600 it's going up to 12k after this 
And there it goes...

Lol anyone who thought anything that didn’t turn out to be true could be classed as delusional. Getting things wrong is part of being human and it’s no crime 
Nice after-timing!
I knew, but i still chose to sit tight.
It’s a correction
As money or gold. I already use Crypto's for cross border transfers. I far prefer it to banks. 
:)
And don’t forget to hitch a ride on my magical balloon next time we are headed to an altitude of 10k
Thank you!
Like now would be a dip? Compared to yesterday I seenit is but in general
Like I’ve only bought in coinbase.. it’s not available to me yet cause I just paid for it. But when it is, how do I transfsr to bittrex or binance so I can trade for smaller coins.. I lnow im supposed to use gdax to avoid high fees but how do I transfer from CB to there! So many noob ass questions 
i definitely agree. Im buying into this market again anytime soon. Just gonna hold what i have and hope for the best.
At this point I don’t even care about gains. 
As many times as it takes 
I keep seeing this word "pathetic"... I don't think it means what you all think it means.
It's 8.34pm here
Said the pebble to the mountain . . . .
You guys are all misspelling the word “hold.” Yes I know what hold on for dear life is but HODL is still not a word. One idiot misspells the word “hold” and many follow.
Not that I know of, just people's opinions.
Asia started it
£££££
Some people get paid more than once in their life. I myself get paid every other week. So I went all in years ago, then I got paid another bonus and went all in again! This year's bonus.... you guessed it, I'm going all in!  My disposable income is almost 100% in crypto!
If everyone thought like that we would never go up would we?
FOMO pure and simple
Likes holding bags for people.
Pancake mmmm
Wrong subreddit 
Username checks out...
So The forth quarter of 2018 isn’t a repeat of Q4 2017. The adoption was there but the technology wasn’t. 
Segwit which would lower fees significantly, came out over a year ago and only 39% transactions use it!!! WHY is this allowed? Time the devs and wallets mandate it and take advantage of the attention bitcoin is getting. 
Exactly. Stop handing over fees!
Words of wisdom, I don't own bitcoin but I am going to put all my alts in my nano ledger and only check the markets 2x a week
So great! they take a huge risk wash trade on their way up and guess what? They sell. Most of the BTC buys are less than 10. That tells me that more people are joining the ecosystem. I personally believe that it’s big holders releasing their holdings and more and more people are buying. Let the big holders sell! We all know that there isn’t an infinite amount. 
Nobody here wants bitcoin to stabilise rather than increase in value.
Even then I see most of the action is late in the US session. Asia and Europe is mostly absent of late. 
I'd suggest you stop looking at coindesk because it hit 9760 on bfx and gdax
Where does this idea come from that your reddit account age equals crypto knowledge? Don't make yourself look like a fucking retard please.
[deleted]
Hopefully stay around $9k then the moon :)
When else have I said? Feel free to look through my history :)
I hodl a lot ;D

But spend about 50-60k USD for buying various things with bitcoin, so i am also supporter of btc ...
Hey, you just redefined the term arrogant!

Your arrogance **To the moooon!!!**

Edit: misspelt noob, knob.


Nobody here knows shit about finance.
You’re kidding. ...right?
Breakfast is for suckahs. We need that sweet pump action they've been handing us the last couple days before Europe wakes up to dump it.
Not me
Yes, Tether is ultimately centralised (it works more or less like PayPal).
If the last few weeks are anything to go by, Europe will just trade sideways and wait for America or East Asia to change the price up or down
No he means bear trap. 
I mean bear trap. It was just a short dump. Going up again now.
because it will.
WASA WASA WASA WASA WASA WASA WASA WASA WASA
Right, but I'm talking about things that have high liquidity, are very valuable, and especially for investing in blockchains. The pound and euro would also qualify.

I'm already involved in some real estate related investments so I don't need to go there right now.
*insufficient funds*
Have they implemented it yet? It's been over two months since they were supposed to start doing it.
Spot on my friend.
And this is like 10%....
No, it's monitoring the market.  And when they detect the fraudulent activities on exchanges operating outside of SEC's jurisdiction, you will be seeing a lot of news.
I ain’t going to lie.  I work for a company with a decent amount of employees and all my co workers think I’m a retard ( I sort of am a goofball and retarded in my own way but anyway) for investing into crypto.  Same ole questions and comments what backs it? it can crash to nothing tomorrow etc.  I really want to one day roll up in a lambo and see their faces drop.
Yikes 🤡
It provides motivation to the Bulls.
Asia just had their morning coffee.
Opening/closing is 8 PM EST every day.
HANG ON GUYS, IT'S GOING TO SPIKE CAUSE I AM ABOUT TO SELL!
It was supposed to be to whom explained the Binance/Tether analogy.
Can you clarify what you mean?
As an comment I feel offended by your autist.
indeed
That's not what he meant. People in here seem to stare at 5m charts and start to panic with every move. We're actually good until we cross 8900, maybe even 8500 or 8200. That's less than a week ago.
You must be new if you've never seen it go down a K.
> It's gone down nearly 1k...

The amount of FUD posts, yeah! you're correct, but don't be to complacent, these trolls are **complete wankers**, and will continue. 
Actually about $700 down at its lowest. a little over 600 now.
Here you are again, you fud wanker...
Either that or its the whales raking in their profits
[deleted]
Yeah looks like it's actually driven by GDAX and not Bfx this time.
Good, it's you again...

I see you everywhere spreading fud...
It's also different than the other drops we've seen recently. Long positions have increased sharply on Bfx and price is driven by GDAX this time, which are strong indicators for simple profit taking. I'm bullish until we drop below 8900.
It depends on what exchanges you are looking at and the situation, and which pairs. There's no true price for anything.
hasn't gotten one confirmation yet in about 7 hours.

That is my concern.
It shows a 21% on Zaif.jp. You're right, it's only on that exchange.
Fuck, I've had a few transactions yesterday with 5 sats per byte get confirmed in like next or 3 blocks easily.
Why is this happening now?
It got confirmed after 8 hours

did you even look at the comments? look at everyone panicking about the 'dip' on that day lol
:D :D
And back under 9k.
Looks like mempool is clearing - if it continues should see your transaction clear...hopefully mine at 2 sats too!
They do it at the same time. They don't care if it's bitcoin or any other crypto. They only care about getting liquidity out of the market.
Yup, that's what I think also. I suspect that bulls consciously let the trendline slide for a while. If shorters get hard pressed with a bullrun we might see a vertical spike if they mass\-close their shorts.
Looks like a bear trap 
Below...
I still need to sell it by the end of the month (need money) so hope I've made the right choice... cause I sure don't believe it will hit 10k this month. Later in 2018 - SURE, but I need fiat now.
https://datamish.com/d/000000004/btcusd?orgId=1&refresh=20s&from=now-2d&to=now

Good for those guys. Kraken is also out of margin funds, everyone's just opening long positions.
let us pray for weak hands >.< for they know not what they do... hodl gang
Do you even read my post?
I told you I EARN money in BTC. I don't invest anything EVER in BTC or any other crypto.

he said he receives payment in BTC and didn’t buy it and now needs the cash, not really a failed investment on his part 
The coolest story 😜
but dey dindu nuffin!
Yeah. Why not?
It's dumping all the progress made yesterday.
Mainly because it's bullshit. I'm still up 100% plus in 3 weeks. Some people just decided to take profit. Not a farking major event in Bitcoins life. 
[deleted]
Lol - relax man, just give it 24 hours. You'll never be able to call entry and exit points exactly. It's 50/50 story when you come in wether it's going to go into profit immediately or draw down. 

We are well up on the lows and the trend is obviously up. This was just profit taking. My Nav is already climbing again.

And of you're going to do this, get used to the DD's. Keep some cash on hand to buy these moves so they become opportunities, not something to panic about. 
Sorry mate.  But putting retirement money into BTC is a really, really bad idea.  This is just a speculation game and you should be playing only with money you can afford to lose.
Think long term.  If you truly understand and believe in bitcoin you’ll know the odds are in your favor. I wouldn’t have risked retirement funds though. Always hedge your bets just in case. 
>I hope you can afford to lose everything in your Roth IRA
This was me in December.... Welcome to the club
In my experience the longest it will take to get back up there is right under or at 30 days.
Allow me to be the optimist for a moment. You risked your Roth IRA, so what? It was a long-term investment before, right? New ATH. You'll more than double your money this year. Nothing is guaranteed, but I believe the odds are heavily stacked in your favor.
Kek
Majority of the gains from these recent bull runs were just whales manipulating the market, they're slowly taking their profits from everyone who took the bait, not enough buyer demand to sustain the buy wall thats being torn down by whales
[deleted]
[deleted]
Will there be any flubber in this comment?
Exactly. People act like it's a bunch of people being bullish when it's just a few whales pumping and dumping (which is fine as long as it doesn't go too low after the dumps).
You buy blockchains with btc. Duh.
ok fine, you buy crypto. Or is it cryptocurrencies? But some aren't. Or is it tokens? Is it coins? Or is it blockchains?
its pretty predictable..... zoom out and see only way is up till there are as many trillions in crypto as in stocks... nasdaq wants to get in crypto.. 56 finance institutes in the next 6 months... this was all in the news if your asking..
>the price he/she/it wants

it?  Are you Justin Trudeau?
It will rise steadily, I am expecting $15K by the mid of Aug. Meanwhile trying to swing with other alts :-) 
Yes. But I want it only when prices rise.
Never said that :P
We always said that we will double test the 6K support which we never did. I think we went around 6.45 and bounced back. So let's see.

I am not seeing ALTs going down with the same pace as they used to though. Interesting. 
why so confident?
Get a room. 
No? Haven't bought in a while.
Fud bot
no way to tell for sure, $8.8K is the key support point, it'll depend on how well that holds up, if bears get passed that we are gonna be in bad shape
More like anyone who thought anything that's not based on verified evidence is delusional.
Meh, you set a stop loss order on GDAX, big whoop.
An altitude of 10,000m is achievable in a non-magic balloon.
Yup, I'm with you there. I think 11.8k\- 11.9k is possible in a not so distant future.
Impossible to know.  If you believe in the long term future, buy in.

I buy into coins when I finally judge I want to own them - I don't worry about the spot price at all.
To transfer from coinbase togdax you just gotta go on gdax and press the button that says "deposit" and then you select that you want to deposit from your coinbase account and it will transfer over. To transfer to your own personal wallet or another exchange, on gdax you just select "withdraw" and then select "btc address" and enter the receiving wallet or exchanges address. 

(I'm not too sure on how to transfer from coinbase since I use the app) 

To transfer the coin out of the coinbase  app you select the paper airplane looking icon and then follow its instructions and enter the wallet address and it will send.

If your just going to buy small amounts and you dont want to wait a week for the money to transfer from your bank account to gdax. I found the fees on the square cash app to be a little more reasonable than the coinbase fees.

how about cringy then?
Answer the man's question
It's not an acronym. 
Asia blinked and america spilled their spaghetti.
I imagine it would if they invested in BTC becoming more accepted as general purpose currency more instead.
Correct. But the point of investing is not to think like everyone else. 
nocoiner confirmed
Lmao
Decentralized - mandate....... does not compute 
I know I used the bad word force... but no one ever said they want to pay more fees except miners which is want bitcoin has chosen to decentralize from. Bcash gives miners too much power. If we stayed at 1mg, let’s mandate the innovation of segwit and Lightning.  
It will eventually reach it's natural value and at that point it will become money. But there's still a few billion people that needs to come onto it. 

It takes about 30 years for a tech like this to become what ever it's going to become.  So just relax and let time do it's thing, meanwhile enjoy the sky money as a relatively early adopter. 
I don't see your point?  Coindesk logged a high of $9746, not really much difference to $9760. 
>So many newbies on this feed
How do they know that you were sending the coins for research chemicals?  I presume you got all your coins back?
Ya know what I mean :)
The hell does that even mean? What's arrogant about others being short sighted? Go talk to Webster.
Good point. 
I am, just trying to make someone laugh/smile even if the joke is on myself.
:(
My bad I easly get them mixed up
Definitely a bear trap. 
It's still going down:(
[Oh boy, you're in for a treat!](http://cf.chucklesnetwork.com/items/5/3/1/9/1/original/oh-youve-never-done-this-before-youre-in-for-a-treat.jpg)
If you're holding long term you don't need to *have* high liquidity.
Yes, they have: https://support.coinbase.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2924267-segwit-faq
yup, so its not flat, its a dip, once it gets 25% or more its a crash
I think you are wrong.  

https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-exchange-gemini-monitor-trading-using-nasdaq-tech/

"Cryptocurrency exchange Gemini announced Wednesday that it is partnering with Nasdaq to monitor trading activities on its platform."

They will only be monitoring Gemini.
Let's see ... Huracan is around 400k.  

Assuming that BTC goes back to ATH (someday), you need to sink in 180k today.  You really want to take a 180k bet that BTC will go to 20k?

Hmmm...
I had a coin (yeah, one - I went in BIG) from 2010 to 2013, sold it around $200 - when a coworker of mine was daytrading for cash.  If he was any kind of smart, he took his trading profits and held them, even $2000 back then would be one Lambo today.
Yeah that's never gonna happen.
Lmao
Still having it. 
I though it was always open 
Is that midnight GMT?
Seems you figured out the "reply" button. Glad that your search for knowledge on bitcoin has brought you to r/bitcoin. Also check out r/Bitcoinbeginners
Three days ago everybody was suicidal and McAfee was going to eat his dick. Two days ago everyone was ordering Lambo's and space suits for the moon. McAfee's dick was safe again. 

And well....we're back to where we were three days ago. Crypto's are volatile. Just how it works. That's why we're all here. 

In another 24 or 36 hours or so it's Lambo and moon time again. 
Let me rephrase: It doesn't matter where the markets were at any point prior to right this second.
Hence saying "nearly"...
Or maybe Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny.
been there done that
This is a bull market. We've rebounded off of the obvious floor of 6500. Now that a floor is established, the bulls can take over. Things look good for crypto, though we might go back to the 7000s at some point if there's bad news in the real world. For example if the stock market collapses or the US bans crypto, or Tether gets subpoenaed again. 
[deleted]
[Lots and lots of transactions](https://blockchain.info/unconfirmed-transactions).
And back over 9k.
My trx got confirmed (the ones with 7 sats)... good luck to yours!
But I was waiting like 8 hours :(
Yeah looks like but still a lot of unconfirmed transactions.
Received that trx with 60 sats... well of course I didn't had doubts about it.
Above...
You said you receive payments in it so I assumed you were running a business. Otherwise, you should have said you earn BTC as income or salary. 
To be fair, he is still investing in BTC if he's accepting as a form of payment for his business. Never said he bought BTC....
Easy come easy go 
The progress yesterday was too fast and not ,healthy'. Do you expect a $1k jump every day? Just stay calm. It will retest 9.8k again soon
Sometimes.
No its not. Don't say that. Heretic. 
I only recently started saving so it wasn't THAT much. I started off wanting to be a responsible investor with just index funds, but bitcoin makes me throw out all logic.
I see you participate only in the daily discussion threads... interesting :)
You don’t need a key, you need to log in your quadrigacx account and deposit the btc to the correct address.
I thought you said your friend is sending you 3 bitcoins. Now you're saying you're the one sending them? I'm new to reddit, and it seems to me that most people here are inclined to help if you have a question, but you're just not making any sense.
Show me proof of youre prediction. Thanks
It's not fine. It's never fine... It means whales can control the direction of the market. Once they know they cannot get what they want from the market, they will crash it to the grow, go home with the money and leave the rest hdling the bags and cleaning up the ashes. 
then you wear the blockchains to gets wymens.  duh.
nope, i am next human version, 99,99% robotic xD
I think you're very wrong there. I think May is going to be explosive. 
Because the uptrend has to resume. It is a busy day of the week, we've had a day or two down now and about 10% to 20% DD which is normal. Just time and the price is right to spur buying. 

There might be another attempt at a push down, but I'd rather be buying here than selling, that's for sure. So would most people I think. 
Then fuck off.
10k is just the first stop. We will need the magical aspect once we leave earth’s atmosphere. 
Awesome thank you!
Hahaha
bitcone!!
No it's not my day job.
Shall I panic sell to satisfy your demands?
30 years for tech like this? Didn't take the iPhone 30 years. Didn't take netflix 30 years. Didn't take automobiles 30 years. It's almost a decade old now, and I still can't use it without hefty fees and lot of unnecessary transfers. 
And he obviously ment BTC newbies, not Reddit newbies. But I'm guessing you're both.
[deleted]
You characterised people here making 2 USD gains - you have **NO** idea what quantity is being traded by posters here, and with what thought and deliberation.

You essentially are clueless, but still comment forcefully and without information  - that is arrogance.
Example: Binance doesn't take Fiat other than wire transfers. You can't just hold dollars. So you go to Tether company, and buy IOU's, giving them $50 for 50 tethers (Minus a small 0.5% fee) and exchanges who want to accept Fiat just accept Tether, which is always worth $1 because at any moment, you can redeem it for $1 back again. It's a loophole to let exchanges hold fiat without legally holding fiat. 
It's a trap. 
Bitcoin is bonkers
Funny, I should just ignore you. But Ill just go ahead and take a bite. I’ve been around since 2014 and hold plenty of BTC. Hardly new at this and far from losing. You shouldn’t make assumptions- you’re really bad at it.
I stand corrected. They still don't show up in the Segwit list: https://bitcoincore.org/en/segwit_adoption/
It is, but for the sake of conventionality there needs to be an opening and closing time to me able to have candle charts.
Yes.
The price is currently almost exactly according to McAfees [prediction](https://fnordprefekt.de/) at ~8,761.


Ahhh. Okay. Thank you haha. I mean, maybe. We'll truly see come the end of 2020.
That's false from any perspective. Simplest point being that it matters if you bought higher or lower in the past.
down 2.5% from 24 hours ago, such a disaster! /s
I saw that and disagree. Your definition of nearly is very broad. 700 is closer to half of 1000 than it is to 1000.
Yep my COINOMI wallet has segwit enabled and I'm pretty sure the receiving address has it enabled also.

Has it been having issues lately? Havent had this issue before but realized to fee was so tiny when COINOMI already sent it (coinomi is set to automatically choose the fee based on the network)
Eventually went through, after about 18 hours with the original 2 sats!  Would have hoped for some positive market movement given the transaction volume shift.  Went the other way though, ended up 10% less on the receiving end! Bah
No. Below.
you’re assuming he owns his own business and doesn’t just work for someone else who decided to pay people with BTC. sure that might be the case but there’s still no reason to attack him. 
That's what I'm saying. Doesn't seem like there's ever any actual support when the price can tank several hundred dollars so easily.
I guess so.
If you have a heart, you should be advising him that when it recovers to 9.6k, he should sell and stay out of this.
It's called FOMO and there are plenty of morons peddling that.
I don't care for threads, just a bunch of baseless opinions

OK :)
Explosive in every thing is going to blow UP or in everything will go down in flames?
>Because the uptrend has to resume.

Nope.
Nah fam.
Officially space starts at 100km = 100,000.  I'd be happy with that by the weekend :)
What are my demands again? I’m not aware I made any.

Took the tablet 16 years to get to 50%.

People are only beginning to figure out the blockchain. It will take at least another 20 years for it to settle in. 
Not sure but I expect others will give you ideas. 
Why dont you use a private wallet? 
I have an idea, especially when they post it. People willfully post what they made, and what they spent it on. Many times, it a meal. And Webster says - arrogant - having or revealing an exaggerated sense of one's own importance or abilities. I did neither in my post. Thx buddy. 
fee is 0.05% on binance, not 0.5%
Since 2014?  Good for you!
Doesn't really matter where it goes to, as long as it keeps doing this. Buying now will be about 10%, maybe even 20% in 12 - 36 hours. 
Why would that matter?

Bitcoin Quantum?
The only support is with the holders.  There are enough to support the price at ~6500.  The rest of the people in bitcoin are traders and speculators who want a quick buck and will put their money all in or all out depending on which direction the price is moving, so you won’t see stability at 9000 until the number of holders increases to support that number.
You were expecting actual support in a bubble?
This. I hate when people jump over others misery, 'you should have done this'

We do what we do with the best intentions, sometimes it works sometimes it does not

If its 20k next week you made the right decision
Why because you think he's not got balls. But he's the one that threw his retirement at it. He's got balls. You want to castrate him and make him impotent. I have thrown my retirement and all the spare cash I can find at crypto. Haven't you?
[deleted]
So why do you think we care about your opinion. Why bother coming here?
I have no experience with that exchange. Assuming it’s the same as the other 8 exchanges I have used you need to go to add fund section, find bitcoin and if an address exists copy it. If it doesn’t exist there should be an option to create an address, then copy it. Then go to coin base and withdraw to the address you just copied. onky send a small amount like 0.000001 the first you send to it. If it clears then send the rest.
I also have a strong feeling we will go down, if its to good to be true it prob. is lol

Thanks for the reply its really appreciated.
Explosive growth, for May and maybe June. 
Yup...
Ok let me rephrase stop being a tit
Yeah because commercial tablets were really great in 2003. Lol. Ipad came out in 2010. 
That didn't scan.  

Read it again.  Clarify it in your own mind, then re-write.

But I warn you.  I won't read it.
Not Binance fee, this is Tether website fee. 
Wat
I have sent BTC before to the exchange (it is my canadian exchange so its not a phishing issue).

You're right tho some people have been scammed from phishing sites before (with this exchange too)

My exchange also shows the pending deposit so I know its not phishing. Probably have to wait it out like others have mentioned because my wallet sent a fee that was too low.
You know very well the probably of that happening is close to zero.
Absolutely.

You can have balls and be a retard at the same time.  Just like you. 

Anyway, if you haven't already figured out, the upcoming regulations is going to clean up this mess and unfortunately, crash BTC while doing it.
Actually I lean towards probability and evidence to support that probability
Lol so many hurt individuals, im just here to keep the balance towards the flood of naive optimism 
Not so soon :-) I will explode only after August..
Nope.

There is nothing inherent to bitcoin which requires that it ever go up in price.
Got it - give you sound investment advice (given the state of your purchase at the moment you need it), am a ‘tit’.
Exactly. Now you get it. 
Thats the Webster definition of arrogant. If you can't read a dictionary, I can't help you. You'll read it, though. Just like you'll read this. 
yes, sorry, you are totally right.
Why would it matter what price you bought in at?
Last August Bitcoin was 300% past it's previous parabolic high, right now we're 300% under it. 
Other than a network of tens of  millions of users who is near fanatical about it ? And that professional large investors are starting to take an interest and that the market cap is finally close to a point where it can handle them ? 

Sell mate, sell. Get all out.
'Give you sound investment advice' 

Thanks Warren
Because that determines if you made a profit or loss.
What you are describing is a bubble.
How much have you lost so far?
...yes, and?

Either it's a good idea to buy bitcoin or it's not. Either it's a good idea to sell bitcoin or it's not. If you're going to realise a loss overall by doing what makes sense now, that means that you fucked up in the past and you need to move on.
I hope so. Like the .com bubble which gave us  Google, Facebook, Uber etc, yeah I really want a piece of the Bitcoin bubble when the trend resume. Today. 
£600 give or take

Edit: on what I bought yesterday
How do you know your money isn't in Pets.com or eToys.com?
So someone suggesting your don’t lose £600 in a day isn’t giving you sound advice?
You don't know, that's why you buy Shotgun. Some of them are going to work. 
A bit late 'after the fact'
>Some of them are going to work.

Unlike crypto, Google, Facebook, and Uber actually create goods or services.
If you’d have asked me yesterday if you should buy I would have said the same thing ‘not at the two month high’. 
Need to travel a bit mate. Moment you need to do a cross border transfer you'll understand. 
But I didn't ask you yesterday, I made a conscious decision to buy based on FOMO which partially was the wrong decision

Thing is no one knows when its the high/low/sideways its all guesswork

Thats why TA is a load of shite

If it goes to 20k next week I can say I bought in at the two month high what a fool I was
I was in Japan in March; I had no trouble getting cash out or using a credit card.

However, if all my liquidity had been in bitcoin, there were very few places that I could have used it.
We don’t know when to buy, but you could have bought at 6000, the question is why not and how do you make sure you do that next time?
In one country I'm operate in I can't get money out without tax clearance every single time in the other I can't get internet banking because I'm an expat. Bitcoin solves both those issues. I don't have to wait days for money to arrive and there's no chance of confiscation by either government. For the first time in my life I can move money freely as I need to without asking anyones permission for anything. There's a hell of a lot of product right there. 
But I did all the way through the dips just yesterday I was in a fuck it mood so I went a bit mad

If you look through my previous post's I generally am not the best at timing the market but I have never lost money 'yet'

For instance if it was at 10-20k I would not going all in but its still 'loose change' atm

But I agree in principle with your last statement 'how do you make sure you do that next time?'

I get bored if I am not 'doing something'
Sounds like the problem is that you live in a shithole.
Invest in something other than crypto. Find something that doesn’t seem like a completely fucked business that is at a 365 day low. Buy stocks. 
What you think that's not going to happen to you mate ? Wait till the US crashes and the bank failures start. The whole world is going to turn into a shit hole and you and everyone else will very quickly figure out Bitcoins value. 
If the financial system crashes, why on earth do you think that Bitcoin would retain its value?
Where else are people going to go ? 

Are you going to leave your money in a bank that might or might not fail ? Are you going to risk a bail-in? What's easier ? Do you go draw the cash or login to your account and transfer it out to your Bitcoin broker so you can get it out of the system ? 

Gold doesn't help. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102

Look at what they're doing to gold in India. Bitcoin is the only alternative. 
**Executive Order 6102**

Executive Order 6102 is a United States presidential executive order signed on April 5, 1933, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt "forbidding the Hoarding of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates within the continental United States". The limitation on gold ownership in the U.S. was repealed after President Gerald Ford signed a bill legalizing private ownership of gold coins, bars and certificates by an act of Congress codified in Pub.L. 93–373 which went into effect December 31, 1974.

>Where else are people going to go ?

Panic sell and acquire things which don't require the internet to be able to trade. Gold, metal, food, bullets.

We're not talking about life as we know it, we're talking about life after the apocalypse.
Was there an apocalypse in 1929 ? No.  When Creditanstalt failed ? No. 

There were wars a few years later. But were the events apocalyptic ? No. 

A lot of people suffered a lot. But no apocalypse. It will simply be the trigger that ends the current system and moves us unto a new one. A decentralised distributed system. 
The US government is never going to let the banks fail. If the US government is not in a position to save the banks, the internet is not going to continue existing and you would be a fool to continue to hold your wealth in any system which requires it to operate.
Internet was designed to survive a nuclear war. I think it will make a banking crises. World is a bit bigger than America.
