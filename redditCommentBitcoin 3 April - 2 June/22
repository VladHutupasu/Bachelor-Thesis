Daily Discussion, May 12, 2018 -- TITLE
Did some chain analysis on mt gox recent transaction of 8000btc.  The Bitcoins were transferred to a newly created wallet.  0 BTC is spent from that wallet.  Most likely this was an OTC sale to a private buyer, far as I can tell, no trades were done via exchange.   This is a very good news, looks like he is selling mostly to private whales that are in it to HODL.
Bitcoin is the same as the weather in The Netherlands. 3 days ago it was 28 degrees, yesterday it was 13.. today we have 24. Hodl.

I wonder why all the naysayers come out of the wood work when btc falls a bit in price. I'd much rather see discussions on the tech. I'm getting tired of coming to this sub. 
Bullish.
Exciting times. Can't wait to power-blackout alone after work. 
FINALLY SOME GREEN! The past few days have been absolutely dreadful .. blame upbit!
Anyone ever hear of a restaurant called Fudruckers? Just wondering who their clientele is.

Can we get back to over $9k before Monday's meeting? 
I have seen the future 😉

I sold at 8200 and buyed again at 8600. I went full retard. I can’t believe that happen to me, I have experience in this shit.
The only thing Ido is to buy when it drops, then I hodl... Never sell... Will sell  in time...
Let's go!!! 
Houston, we have lift off!

Posting again due to unasnwered q, n00b as hell.

I transferred BTC to my Jaxx wallet 3 months ago. I can see the transaction on block chain.info if I search the address, but it's not appearing in the wallet itself.

What happened?
Should we still be optimistic for next week's conference? 
The Bart ™  has returned 
Bart Simpson is back.

"ok, THIS is the bottom."

"HODL onto your butt, I guess"
We recovered when it was night in the US and dumped again at around 9-10am EST. Just sayin, this isn't Korea anymore. Get your shit together Murica.
**Keep fighting Bulls!** 
oh wow shorts being murdered rn
Damn, all those "$10k by Friday" predictions crashed and burned. Just shows you how volatile the market can be for Bitcoin.
Great chance to buy the dip!

Don‘t say: I should have bought at $8300.

This is the double bottom. It’s going up now.
Judgement day is upon us!
I just woke from a dream that BTC had passed $12,000. In my sleepy headed excitement I checked my phone and literally the opposite has happened 
Be me.
buy the day befor yesterday.
buy yesterday.
today: Welcome to goblintown ....
Haven’t really been following the news lately, why is everyone saying it’s about to go back up again? 
Does anyone know how many times we’ve crossed 9k in the last month or so? At least 5 times right?
lamee 
What a tiny drop I don’t know what you all were crying about. 
Morning, are we still expecting the market to go upwards with the Concensus Meeting starting on Monday 14th May? 
Just bought some more BTC in the dip. Thank me later for single handedly initiating a massive moon run. Yip, definitely all me. 😜
In what price is the current support?   $7800?
going below 8000 this time
I don't know why people are so concerned with short term gains. Realistically the price won't change that much until technology catches up to push block chain to the next step where "Normies" will be able to easily access cryptos. The sad truth is most people are low IQ and don't understand technology or it's implications. The internet has been around since like the 70s and 80s... but it wasn't widely accepted until maybe the 90s and didn't explode until the 2000's. It's important that we have patience and stay focused. Bitcoin will skyrocket but it won't be overnight. Just slowly accumulate bitcoin and don't look at the price. Think of it as an investment that will payout in the future, if you get caught up in day trading or selling every time you feel FUD you will get tore up with paying taxes on it. 
See you all at 5k

Hey hey heyyyyyy, bitconneeeeeeeeeect!
The best part about these drops is watching the reversal and all the shorters scramble to get back on the ship they abandoned moments before... I’m making popcorn now
one of my opinions; a whale has just sold bitcoins bought at MTgox for a private sale, and sold its own wallet ... what do you think? would it be possible to influence the market this way?
Just more proof it can't sustain itself.
My stupid ass tethered at 8200, now it is 8500. 😱 Hope it will fall down to 7k.
Dead cat bounce. Next stop 7k.

#never10kagain
Hope so
Yeah but did the buyer turn around and sell on the exchange?
Put your finger back in the dyke please :)
Celcius right? That's all fairly chilly in freedom degrees. 
Sounds like uk too 👍
BART has been violated
cool, soon 9 k ......
Why not subscribe to the mailing lists of lightning and bitcoin for that? Or read bitcointalk? Sadly Reddit hasn't really been a place for that for a while now.
There is r\CryptoTechnology.  I am also subscribed to it.  They don’t allow discussions about price speculation there.  You might like it.
All I know is that if this breaks 7k, I'm putting my kid's entire college savings into BTC.

Holy moonboots batman
if you're right I will give you 1 ~~Bitcoin~~ Ruble.
Let’s hope 
Typical example of FUD and then FOMO. I could have probably done the same thing. 
never chase the price.
I made that mistake once. Emotionally sold some, then immediately (literally two minutes later) realized how dumb it was and bought back the same amount. Ended up just being like a 2% loss after a slight increase in price and Gemini fee. Protip: transfer out of an exchange to a hardware wallet and then you won't be as tempted to panic sell in a moment of weakness.
lol as everyone
be patient a little now, go do something else, liquidate your positions in small pieces or decide to hold a game. personally, that's what I did to get out of this trap.
and maybe you have already made the right choice....

Imagine if this was just a dead cat bounce, and it falls to 7500 tomorrow. Than I would be stupidest trader ever.
I tried a bit of trading last weekend with a small portion of my coins. After holding and watching the market for five months, I got bored and thought I know enough now. Lost quite a bit in two days running after short term trends. Made all the beginner mistakes.

I concluded that I‘m too stupid for this and transferred all my remaining coins to my hardware wallet.

Now I’m back to holding and buying the dips.

The technology is moving forward. It will be reflected in the price sooner or later.
My popcorn just finished. I’ve got bear meat on the grill, who wants some?
Can you post the transaction?
Which conference?
Long term yes... Next week who knows...
This is our bread and butter of the year.  Major companies, huge investors, NYC wanting to become the global capital of blockchain.  Tom Lee is still standing by 25k by summer and said he wouldn't be surprised to see Bitcoin shoot up 10%-70% during the conference and continue surging in the following months.
Yes!
Eat my shorts dude ... Literally 
Looks like a complex 360° inverse no-scope Mr. Burns forming. 
ha.ha. but looking positive in this market it will bounce back nextweek. but it is the best time to buy right now

You call this a fight?  Bulls seem to have abdicated that position when they let 9k. 8.8k and 8.5 k fall.  This is a slaughter.  Yeah I’m pissed. 
Where do you see that? 

BTCUSDSHORTS on Bitfinex looks like many short positions got covered in the past 48 hours and now they're on the rise again.
Wrong.  The shorters are taking profit.

Could someone define the mathematical 'opposite' of 12000 please?

Is it a simple inverse operation in linear algebra?

12000 is an integer, so it should be simple.

Unfortunately, 'opposite' is poorly defined.  Perhaps a reflection.
When has the consensus here ever **not** been that it's about to go back up again?
13 times, most of them it crossed and crossed back very quickly.
Yeah atleast 5 times. 
if everyone expects it goes up, the opposite will happen
just think positive ;)
Yes
I'm kidding, but if that happened, I'd eat my own penis. 
8.2 looks strong so far.
agree
8250 is the 0.5 fib retracement and 7800 is the 0.618 fib. Usually in a correction it will go to the 0.618 level rather than just stopping at the 0.5.
no way
If most people have a low IQ, wouldn't that make it a normal IQ?
> most people are low IQ

talks about IQ, has MAGA username.
What exactly is the technology that bitcoin/crypto has to offer ?

It's not a currency, it's just online gambling and its a waste of electricity.
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Bitcoin. The technology is extremely advanced, and without a solid grasp of blockchain technology most of the implications will go over a typical nocoiner's head. There's also the endless possibilities with cryptocurrency. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the value of crypto, to realise that they're not just fun tokens- they will revolutionize the world FOREVER. As a consequence people who dislike cryptos truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the importance of "HODL," which itself is a fantastic investment strategy for a speculative asset that can only go up. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as crypto gains widespread adoption. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO own BTC. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎
/r/iamverysmart
Sorry but I very much doubt if you understand it yourself.  

So that pretty much puts you in the 'low IQ' category (per your own definition).

I think when people are becoming frustrated they are likely spending too much time watching the charts. There will be the standard tops, dips, mesas, barts, valleys, mountains, ups and downs. There's plenty of other things I'd rather watch in real\-time. :\)
Precisely half of the population has a below average IQ.
Very well said, agreed! It's a long term game peeps!
Nope. He used "it's" correctly. It's used when saying "it is" or "it has".

Yes, I don’t know shit but here is my 2 cents. 

Whales trustee sells btc to his rich 2nd cousin “OTC.”

Bid is X amount of btc @ 5k/btc. 

Whale agrees 

2nd cousin then dumps his coin on the books. 

2nd cousin buys whale a yacht. 

This is speculation at its finest. 
What proof?
Dude, the Consensus starts on monday. This was nothing but price manipulation, in order to put some more cheap coins in someones pockets before the next potential bull run. And you fell for it, RIP.
Better buy back now, before it's too late.
It will sooner or later, don't worry.
It wont. And you deserve this for this shitmove. 
Why don't you go to a casino and lose your money there instead?

I've never lost money at a casino because, er, I've never gambled money at a casino.

You can try day-trading alts (and shitcoins) but it is a waste of time with BTC.

*e: minor*
Go on bitfinex and short it then. 
How underwater are you? Lol
BLOW IT OUT YOUR ASS BUDDY!!!!!!!
I think You mean inverted dead cat bounce.
Bought at 9.6k
Sold at 8.2k
Hopes it's a dead cat bounce 
I heard that pessimism so many times since 2013... It has proved everyone wrong....
I think you're right in that this still has a ways to go down. My current target is 7800, but it could also hit 7250. Then I think it will move back up from there.
You are right. We ll probably reach 7K again
No, 0 transaction took place on the new wallet.  Atleast for now the buyer didn't sell or move anything.  In my opinion, these are Family Businesses or big players, I don't expect them to sell anytime soon.
😂 sorry
Thanks for the recommendations,  I think I'll take a break from this sub for a bit
Thanks for the sub!
I sold my kidneys when it hit 6k.
There'll certainly be some THC in the mix as well :) 
Well haven't we all been chasing the price since 2011 or so?
Heh.  I once accidentally bought 30,000 USD of something I wanted 3,000 USD of.  Had to sell 27,000 of it back straight away.  There was a bit of a loss there..

Never traded since - I'm too stupid.  Should have sticked to my hodling  :)
not the most stupid, it happens to a lot of us. If you are afraid that the price will come to 7k, sell a few pieces of your position with small losses at a price close to your purchase.

Have chicks ? No chicks no come.

Check out @BitmexRekt’s Tweet: https://twitter.com/BitmexRekt/status/995292047044153344?s=09
Sorry what fomo stand for? 
Well im my context, I ment it had gone down rather than up... But I also went down almost the same as it needed to go up to get to 12k

12000 \* \-1

12000 is obviously 12 000 \*\+1

So the opposite of \+ is \-
Technically the opposite would be -12000... so this uninformed Redditor thinks the value of Bitcoin is below 0 at -$12,000...that means not only are all of us Bitcoin broke but we owe Bitcoin lots of money. So if you have 2 bitcoins..not only do you lose your two coins worth $17,000 at today’s present value but you owe $24,000. That’s the definition of opposite..the reciprocal.
you will see
Agreed. Yes most people are dumb....
Your I.Q. is supposed to be your intellectual age divided by your actual age, so, if you've got the intelligence of a twenty year old, but you're only ten, you have an I.Q. of 200.(Yeah, it's the answer times a hundred, for the pedants out there.)
Sadly
So, he's an expert on the matter
Tbh Trump supporters are the only non-retarded muricans. This fellow is still retarded, tho. Probably a secret democrat
Maybe something mathematical? Like there's probably a math major out there who got a very interesting thesis out of Bitcoin and how people work with it. I mean heck the power calculations alone would be cool to look at.

How smart does a person really have to be to understand sharing multiple copies of an excel file?
BTC enthusiast since 2011 here... been HOLDing for a long time. And to be fair, it's not a fantastic strategy. It's the safest bet, but it's actually the worst investment strategy. If you are able to see a market correction coming, either by hunch, or seeing it start to happen using TA, you can greatly increase your position by selling as the knife starts to fall and buying back in when it hits bottom. If you sell 3 bitcoin at $10k each and buy them back at $5k that's doubling your position. Much better strategy then HODLing. Problem is it's risky... but so is crypto. 
This post belongs in a museum!
The thing is you need to understand economics as much as if not more than the currency itself in order to reasonably value it.
Your doubt is the cause of my post. So I am not surprised why you would class myself with the likes of you. Bitcoin is the future, it is not a day stock. I  not cut as the same cloth as the likes of you. Please refrain from such accusations if you are able to muster the discipline of course. I am doubtful.
Its?
They would be less frustrated if they looked at Bitcoin for what it is, instead of what it's not. They need to see Crytpos like how Gold and Silver work. Not like the stock market.
It's really scary when average is ~100 (varying slightly between countries).
Only cash out in 2150!
He used it incorrectly, but you seem to understand the use. It looks like the reason for this is because he used it twice:

> technology or it's implications

Incorrect.

> It's important that

Correct.
In this context it's used as a possessive. So it should be its. His, hers, its.

If you do the opposite of what /u/GrandKaleidoscope says, statistically you have a 99% chance of making money.
Buffet, Gates, and Munger know that Bitcoin is a threat to their other investments in their portfolios.  Once institutional investing becomes common it will be hard for Dow Jones and S&P 500 companies to grow at their current levels due to a decline in volume.  People will still buy stocks, but at an opportunity cost to crypto. 
Maybe Trump is Satoshi?

The decline from 9.7k to 8.2k...
Lol rekt
So this drop was all Korea fud?  If so, how pathetic are we.  
Surely only one?
to some extend ye but it matters when you join and what your plan is. 

If your decision changes form a 400$ price\-movement. You are a price chasing daytrader which loses on every turnaround or a failing hodler. 

If you are a daytrader you have to plan your trade and then trade your plan. 

If you want to be a hodler buy the dips and forget about the price movement otherwise.  
Wow, how is that possible? Really hope that wasn't a credit card or debit card buy! 😵

Fear of missing out
Only kidding.  I'm getting grumpy and pretentious mate.

Good luck.

I'm off to shoot some endangered animals to make me feel better about life.
Nope.
I agree. My target price I see us hitting is 7800 at least. 7250 is also a possibility. But I'm not a permabear, I think we will likely go up from there.
That's not how it works at all.  Your iq is based on standard deviation from the mean. 

If you are in the 50th percentile, you will have an IQ of 100.  If you are around the 86th percentile compared to others your age, then you will be at 115 iq.  98th percentile will be 130. 

When developing the tests they establish the norms based on giving the tests to a large sample that roughly matches the demographics of the population where the test will be given, and then base scores on how well those people performed.

Yeah gold... Sure mate.
Yes - 100 is hardly a high bar!

It is fair to say, though, that the only thing an IQ test truly accurately measures is someone's IQ.

IQ's correlation with competence, ability, creativeness, value to society, even intellect, is far from clear.

Someone with a very high IQ is very good at IQ tests - that is the only certainty in the measure :)
Correct! I missed the first incorrect one he used. I was referring to the second one.

Help me start a dog grooming salon. Start up could be less than 3k more than what I have. Integrating crypto payments would boost sales. Huge profit margin to be made.

A  10% decline is proof it’s not sustainable? How?

Look into Jobs Act on issuance of securities,  look into Ravencoin and Follow Bruce Fenton,  you can seriously create a tokenized security to fund your business.   Buy the RVN now while they are cheap.   My business isn't all that crazy given I already own two sailboats,  and I'm already a licensed captain,  30 years sailing experience.   So my pressure to earn really is not that great.   Where are you geographically?  I'm not opposed to looking into you grooming dogs,  are you seriously seeking this as your plan?   There is a business on the Roselle Park, NJ / Cranford line called the Barker Lounge,  of parkway exit 137.   I assume they do well.   They may be interested in scaling as well.   Good luck.
Because it has been doing this for a while. Staying between 6k and 11.5k. Just oscillating without anything significant happening.

I think most of us have done that at some point if you’ve made more than a few trades. They need to make an undo button.
I don’t see how.  I have limit orders set for + and minus 7%ish.  Buy on dip, sell on spike. After spikes there were s always a slight correction to buy back in at and increase your hodl

And when that day comes, 80% of Americans will be bankrupt as well as America as a country.

Wait.. Fiat is going to go extinct due to a meteor hitting the earth and millions of years later it will become oil? 

I wish someone had told me before now. I'm going all in on crypto. 
Take it easy mate.  Friendly here.

But people will bite if you arrive and attack!

Take it easy.

Here's some advice: NOTHING, NOTHING, is ever as bad as you think it is.


Thanks for this, I’m going to do more in depth research on RVN. I’m in Houston, markets are good here. I have a location in mind. Sorry I did not mean “crazy” in that context. That was poor word choice. Spontaneous is what I meant, so I added a spontaneous response. Yes these are my plans. Me and my soon to be wife dream of it owning our own business and i can taste it.  However it sounds like a lot of fun sailing the world. 
But how does that mean it's not sustainable? 
Nah, it will develop flight and dominate the skies for millions of years.
Because fiat is dependant on debt and we can only have a global system of debt for so long before the scheme is up and the world population revolts 
You wouldn't even need much RVN.  500 burn to create your unique asset chain, and I suspect another RVN for each token you wish to issue.  Install the local Cryptobridge APP as the Web app is hackable.  Download the RavenQT wallet,  you should encrypt it before sending funds to it.  Don't reuse addresses.  I'll stop by Barker Lounge when I'm up and report back on range of services & prices in case it helps with planning.   I've been working on my sailing dreams since 2004.  It can be a long road,  but you'll get there.  I took no offense to your phrasing.
Because it isn't growing and it's too easily manipulated...

Ummmm why? That makes no sense at all. When are butters going to learn that people *like* debt? It works for people and it works for governments. Being able to borrow money when you need it is a good thing. 

Or perhaps you pay cash for everything? No auto loans or credit cards or mortgage? 
As a currency, Bitcoin is better than it's ever been. Fees and confirmation times are down. Adoption is up. From an investment standpoint, bitcoin may not be doing so well, but if your comments are indeed from an invest standpoint then they belong in r/bitcoinmarkets
