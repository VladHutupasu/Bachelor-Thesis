Daily Discussion, May 17, 2018 -- TITLE
I posted this in yesterday's daily before it closed, but I want to make sure everyone has a chance to read this.

I found this thread from 4 years ago.  It feels like we could be having this conversation today under our current circumstances.  Similar FUD, concerns and hopes.  I really think 4 years from now people will be looking back on our threads and wishing they had a chance to get on board the bitcoin train in 2018 when the price dipped.  Thanks to bitcoin's scarcity and the fact that there can be no more than 21 million coins, ever, I firmly believe we will see the price of bitcoin continue to grow substantially in the years to come.

Edit:  p.s. the OP in that thread is probably rich beyond his wildest dreams today.   So in other words, it‚Äôs not too late for us either.

It was definitely my 0.03 BTC buy that kept us above 8k. You're all welcome.

Must be a lot of Canadians cashing out to buy Victoria Day presents
I hope this comment ages well but I personally find it very encouraging that we have managed to stay above $8k.  Over the last few days I was prepared for $7500 and lower so at the moment like I say I think it's encouraging that we are currently at $8300. 

Also volume is very low at the moment which suggests to me that we are getting into over sold territory and hopefully we will start going up again.  
Keep those hands strong guys! On the tech side the whole market overall is slowly but surely advancing in a healthy manner. The price will follow. HODL :D
Seriously, cut the drama, what are you afraid of? It's hardly dipping under 6k. Nobody here's gonna lose money, just stop looking at the goddamn price and go enjoy some music or whatever. 
Have you people noticed the incredible amount of transactions which the network is now being receiving? [image](https://i.imgur.com/sS5PTq5.png)
I love these "explanations" like if you did know what was happening it would change anything.

BTC was ~2k this time last year. Yeah you bought in at 15k, tough shit. Figure out what you've "lost" and buy at least that much all the way down.

More than likely you'll be laughing all the way to the bank this time next year. 
Wow, Btc volume right now is sad. 
All it takes is one 1k push to gain excitement again. This boring weak nature is not new for ppl who have been doing this for 3 years
I expect the top today around 8300 and going down to at least 7800 this weeken. But is possible to fall to 7600\-7550. 

 We are  stuck in a 10K\-7000k range.... Wich is fine if you can keeping a coldmind, but sometimes is the hardest part. 
Y'all have any good songs to listen to while watching bitcoin crashing?
Do you all not realize that this shit ain't going to the moon sometime in the next 6 to 36 months, UNTIL nearly everyone is in the depths of despair.   That's the way it works.  Y'all are way too damn excited and happy for this gd thing to take it's natural course and crash land in the desert.  Not till then, will we have another lift off.  Your enthusiasm is dragging this shit out.
Hi friends!

If someone needs real-time tracker for new listings I built it. Over 30 major exchanges, e-mail, telegram and browser push alerts. Easy and free. You will be receiving short messages like "Kucoin lists SHL" after the trade begins. It's the part of Bitgur Alerting Service. https://bitgur.com/alerts 
Very narrow range.  Small fluctuations in quilt sales clearly keeping BTC price almost level.
We need the quilt guy to explain all this :)

Has his Mom and her friends stopped buying quilts using LN?

Send out an alert to find out, my American friends.

p.s. don't worry, all will be fine.
Defend 8k!!
Ready for take off! üöÄ
Yeah I should of went to vegas
Guys, just chill out! This despair is responsible for turning the market into shit. We are in the dawn of a new world and the old is trying (naturally) to maintain the status quo. Is not just about making money, all this is a cruzade. We are in war against the centralized world. cryptocoins is making possible to us to make a brand new start, a world where everything is descentralized, such as money, information, technology and what is most important, government.  So, our despair is just making more trouble for all of us. 

We need to think that some of the factors (i dont need to mention)that made the market going down is in direct relation to some of the biggest centralized institutions of our days, in the same way that are other factors as well, I mean: the comunnity going into panic. Yeah! Thats what they are triyng to do. So, relax and let bitcoin flows the river, the nature of human being is in our favor: technology cannot turn over, same as the river. #Foradescentralizedworld 
The thread in worldnews is cancer. Almost confirms the fact that we are still in early adopter territory.
Doesnt look good at the moment:(
Im a believer..and a hodler...but they keep ramming this 8k wall...we in trouble. reminds me of mt gox dump. small rest period. DUMP small rest DUMP
i was studying the charts earlier and noticed since bitcoin was invented it has had 2 parabolic bull markets. 2013 and 2017

in 2013 the bitcoin price run was basically 20 to 1000 or a 5000% increase. in 2017 it was much smaller at 2000% but still very much a run. 2014 also had mt gox go nuclear.  also note at the lowest point in the last bear market bitcoin never even got close to where 2013 started before the run up. the market low was found in spring of 2015 around $220 or 10x higher than the start of 2013 however it was an 80% peak to trough. after this it was an uptrend for years with corrections along the way. we had a MUCH smaller run in 2017 at only 2000% vs 5000% in 2013 and no mt gox blow up. it seems very unlikely to have a repeat as the news is actually really positive and you run into problems with the network in general below 5-6k minimum now. we also have already had a 70% correction with no where near as bad of news and no where near as big of initial run up. an 80% correction would be BTC 4k.  miners will start shutting down due to low profitability around 6k and or difficulty will have to fall....in fact that's already starting. you actually get more coin selling hashing power now than you did at this time last month. many of the dec/jan gpu miners are likely already leaving.Ôªø

the thing i noticed about all modern parabolic moves is they rarely if ever recover quickly. bitcoins massive run in 2013, the nasdaq in 1999. the thing that gets me though. both of those prior examples had real fundamental reasons that brought them down. 2017 really did not. people just sold....well. because lambo and beach house. 

if history repeats 2018 will not rally, it will simply be a consolidation year. weak hands will be shook out. difficulty may even fall on many alt coins. maybe even bitcoin. we may have seen the low at 6k and we may even test 5. going to 4 would be an absolute floor unless we are destined to go to zero. i'm sure a lot of miners would shut down. network traffic would fall. 80-90% of altcoins would die. 
 

my personal feeling is this may be a range bound year. we probably have an absolute floor at 5k and might go there if a hard attempt is made at the last 6k support. we also likely have resistance at 12k that will push back if we move through 10k. 

long term. this is healthy. weak hands are shook out and those of us who stick around will be able to mine easier and accumulate at good prices.

Does anyone know how to send bitcoin from robinhood to a desktop wallet? Can‚Äôt find it in the app

Edit: maybe you can‚Äôt? Robinhood only for trading not simply buying to hodl?

Ready to dumb into my 401k at this point it's made more than my Bitcoin in the last 8 months
Buying cryptocurrency is probably the worst decision of my life
My personal opinion on where we're at right now, 1) early adopters ran out of money & HODL'ing, (very little move in the market--this likely won't change anytime soon).... 2) crypto 'acceptance' enters the main stream; some hype in media about insitutional investors 'crossing the line' to get a slice of the pie, however, like a teen at their first party can't decide if they'll get in trouble with mom or dad for drinking & can't make up their mind, so, instead of downing a bunch of shitty beers with their friends, they end up getting emotional & forget to have a good time because they can't decide.  A week later, they realize their friend got laid because he down'd a fifth of soco after a 4 game run on the BP table and scored with the hot chick in his science class at the very same party...Translation, remember when your mom or dad opened a facebook account?  Yea, this might take a while.

bitcoin is going down, makes me feel like buying more...!!
Hey, Tom Lee. That was a spot-on prediction about Consensus 2018 skyrocketing the price of Bitcoin. Any other advice I should stake my life on?? 
Ya'll hate me when I talk shit, but it keeps going lower lol.
At noon I want to look and see 8600.  Again this is a want. 
We have extremelly strong support at 7900-8000! I dont afraid at all! We will soon get back >9k
I didn‚Äôt expect to see 8k again so fast.  Not bad. 

Edit:  well touched for a second anyway.  Keep going bulls!
My uncle works for Bitcoin. He says if we all buy Bitcoin the price will go up!

Lower highs. Higher lows:(
Sorry don‚Äôt mean to sound harsh but if you‚Äôre trading based on Reddit as market indicator you‚Äôre not going to do well. The price inevitably will go back up on its own because it‚Äôs scarce. 
Everyone needs to get there negative feelings out of this discussion nobody likes weak hands
Gotta love the Asians. They know how to start a party!
The recent 8.3k range action reminds me of the fluctuations at 6.8k when bitcoin was hovering around the last lowest floor. It was a relatively small-range oscillation over several days.

When the 9.7k price level broke down, I was mentally prepared for a new market cycle if it turned out that the range 7.7k-8.2k failed. However, at this point, I am considering the possibility that we might already have a new market cycle building up at current price levels. If that's the case, then I wouldn't be surprised to see some heavy purchases of specific alt-coins.

This is the lowest volume I have seen for Bitcoin on Binance in a long time.  Is this a good or bad thing?  Maybe half the market is in tether waiting to see the next move, I don't know.
[deleted]
This whole thing is just flat out baffling. I suppose we‚Äôll hit rock bottom at 6.5k ................again.
Nice job at 8k bulls üëè
Buy buy buy hodl hodl hodl
this market is a load of crap. 2 weeks ago we were about to break 10k and now we're on the verge of dumping to 6\-7k. 
Is it bear time?
Like if you think bitcoin will likely to touch $40,000 by the end of this year.

I think we have lower to go guys.  We couldn't sustain an uptrend rebound from 8.2k WITH consensus going on, expecting us to rebound again higher from here just seems naive.

Hi, I'm a graduate student, currently conducting research on the cryptocurrency ecosystem and cryptocurrency exchanges.

If you have any free time, I would really appreciate your participation in my survey. I plan to share all my findings with the community once I get enough responses, thanks!

[https://cryptosurvey.questionpro.com](https://cryptosurvey.questionpro.com/)
Bcore isn't doing well lately
Funny how the comments are still 'roughly' the same and apply to the current market

Am slowly coming to the realization that you just buckle in and wait.... 
I bought at the peak of late 2013. At the time in early 2014 it looked pretty bad. But now the 2013 ‚Äúbubbles‚Äù are nothing but tiny bumps in a price chart. 
I keep seeing the same arguments. Scarcity and electricity costs. This doesn't guarantee a high BTC price. I'm surprised even McAfee used the increased electricity cost as an argument for higher BTC prices.
Thanks so much for reposting this from years ago!  Wow, how encouraging to see all the people who remain negative and proclaim the death of bitcoin (they're still around today in this post) and the very few who could see thru the storms and make it to new heights.  Some of these comments from the faithful was like they had a crystal ball and could just see through anything.  Awesome!
4 years ago, the crypto market was very different from what it is today. 

The arguments from 4 years ago, cannot be applied to the today's market.
the old scarcity argument. lol.
Bitcoin could seem like a fraud if you don‚Äôt bother to try to understand it.  Eventually most smart people will educate themselves and come around. 
you must have forgotten what Goldman did to many of its investors, the fraud cases, and their bailout. I wouldn't give them $10 of your dollars. and what ever they advise, I would disregard and run the other direction. these guys are in it for your dollars only.
thanks bruh
Tether!!! might be more like it.  We all know its going to fall below 8k shortly, but that small hope that it might spike back up is keeping us hanging on.  
Almost read "Victoria Secrets"...
Reporting in from Canada, still hodling!
ha.ha. because it's victoria day?
That's not a thing. 

Edit: Canadian's typically drink, shoot fireworks, go camping and BBQ on Victoria Day. Exchange of presents doesn't usually take place. 
A big rally is definitely coming.

And i'm going to say this again as many times as it's necessary: we are NEVER going to see 6K ever again.
I'm still not sure if I should be happy that the movements are currently that boring or afraid because of what's ahead. Support around 8100 and sentiment in general really has taken a beating and although there's as many buy orders down to 8k than sell orders up to 9k, the momentum of closing longs as we approach 8k could just rip right through it. People seem to prepare for another pullback to at least 7800, so I'm hoping for a positive signal from Korea to break the current downtrend.
You know what ... let them sell.  Who do you think is going to come back to buy in again down the road?  Sell, sell, sell....Imma do my thing.
very nice suggestion. just relax have a coffe ,and watch movie 
I think every larger spike you'll see there will be because Coinbase still uses old, pre-SegWit wallet standards
*from ;)
Kind of has been...we haven't had any 20k+ days since April 25 on GDAX. GDAX usually good barometer of over all market lately.
This might go on for months, I hope we go up soon but it's possible we could be in for a long wait.
Note: I am not saying that we could reach 8300, but that the max is around 8300. Now we are failing to break 8150, so maybe will be going down from this point to 7800 or even lower 7600\-7550 \(but not too much lower\).

Damn .... you make it sound almost biblical.

I think there is a lot of truth here. BTC is not going anywhere until nearly all of us have felt a great deal of despair, disgust, and, finally, boredom. It will start to be forgotten, you won't hear about it on the news, and you'll nearly forget you are holding any. Then one day...
Wise words. 
It's just a digital token, don't think too hard about changing the world.
Another one who thinks that posts on reddit = price of btc ... smh 
You know, a "deScentralized" world sounds like a world with no scent. And technology can totally turn over, we no longer use telegrams. (Not the app)
The one about electricity consumption? - It got me worried a bit though. How does moving into late adoption change the whole electricity consumption thing? 
Depends on your perspective. Tomorrow is payday for me so I can buy more possibly at a discount and I‚Äôm happy.  
Your opinion is worthless.
Yeap.

But you are probably not aware that (a) the 2013 spike has already been proven to be manipulated and (b) the 2017 spike is suspected of being manipulated through Tether.
Loser
Good evening!
it has the NYSE listed as an investor.
just hold on guys,we will get what we want
not exactly trading. just another place to take your money off seller fees. so buy high (for free), sell low (for fee) get pounded on both sides. good luck out there.
Nope, when you use Robinhood you're investing in Bitcoin but you haven't "purchased" it.  Stays with Robinhood.
No answer huh?
Same I hope I made the right call....
ha.ha. just hang on there bro. eventually you will gain in that investment
I think it will not go below 8k anymore.there are lots of good news in the community right now,so if you want to buy do it now
People here just talk about up and down, HODL and Moon.  That is way too technical of a question to ask.  :P
Give it a few weeks and you‚Äôll be back in the green again 
Bull market in spe.
Right? I‚Äôm just trying to break even
No its not. Its the bad day trading youre doing thats fucking you over
many of us from 2013 were below break even for nearly 2 years. hang in there 
maybe yes, mYbe not, it depends how it ENDS.
That party was last fall. Then the cops showed up and busted the party. Everyone learned their lesson and aren't coming back to the party.

I'm a fomoerectus, Id buy my dick when it goes up except I all ready own it

[deleted]
This is what we call thinking positively!Yeah dude I hope we hit that again
Bullish talk is 100% trolling....
I think community very positive especially after the meetings
I agree but that is not the only reason why the price will go up, it can also depend on a good news on community,adaptation and the market support.Even whales has the capacity to pump its price
I had the same thought 
I agree! I just came to rant because I bought at $8050 and I could have waited 5 minutes and bought at $7950
exactly,but when do you think the bear is gonna get out
Do you get paid promoting that shit or something? Pretty much every comment is about localbtc
whats the premium on local bitcoins? could you turn steady profits just reselling on exchange ?
If you just asked, you‚Äôve created the only reporting anyone would need
Yes.  I don't know if meaningful applies, but there will forever be a record of the transaction from a Coinbase address to your wallet address.
$7,8K, then $7,2K, then $6,5K and finally, the big $6K
7188
Maybe $7500 but if there is a bull run,it will reach $8500
I think it's $7 800. Hopefully will hold here and if we do it's all the way back up to $10k, which should take a few weeks. I'll be working the longs if we hold here.

If it does hold it be an extremely bullish sign for Bitcoin. Higher low from $6.5k

Wave E is complete. We're going up now.

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/rH1EtVja-BITSTAMP-D/
you are indeed correct. reddit is not good source of informations if this market will come up or fullback because there are lots of comments that are unnecessary.sometimes it is only just a memes
negative feelings = weak hands. pretty sure those two things aren't related. Warren buffet is negative towards bitcoin and crypto, pretty sure he's about the 4th largest hand on the planet.
So it should just be a cheerleader show?  Rah! Rah! Rah!
I saw that as well 
People will be buying SS and Zebi
Buy orders on book don't represent volume. Trading volume isn't any lower than it was last week/month. 
Maybe the market is waiting to see what comes out of the Consensus Meetings. 
ASICs are nothing new.
It will work out 
Meh, if it goes down it goes back up.  Long term holders shouldn‚Äôt care. Seeing that post from 4 years ago really reinforced my perspective. 
It's at 8k currently you really think it'll hit 6.5k soon? 
if we hit that bottom of 6.5 , that is the time to buy again
Me,just hanging as long as I can
Orrrr. We‚Äôre just somewhere in the middle 
It's at 8k currently you really think it'll hit 6-7k soon? 
Yep
Like if you hate people asking for likes
Thoughts and prayers
You have my downvote sir
Go back to facebook.
there's the 12 year old trader.
Or the loss people could take.  When the price was going up, even people in my social feeds were talking about btc and alts.  Now no one talks about it.  The fall from grace really fucked us when it comes to public interest.  Alot of people lost their ass.
if you buy now I am very sure that you will have profit, the real question is when you will sell it?
this guy everyday haha

Yes it‚Äôs hard to see the light sometimes when we are in the doldrums after a major crash.  After reading that old thread, I am more excited and energized than ever. 
Congratulations üôÇ
The market may have been different, but human psychology remains the same. There are still market cycles and all of the emotions that motivate people to buy high and sell low. Combine that with crypto markets moving much more quickly than conventional stock markets and it's clear that now is a much better time to get into crypto than the next time it goes on a bull run.
I‚Äôll be sure to repost this thread in 4-5 years with new commentary from me on my yacht.

I hope so :) 
Just saw 7k

1 more k to go
I don't know about $6k, but I have a strong conviction it's not going under 6k.
YES! It's almost like bitcoin is going to its knees to jump even higher...
We're definitely gonna need a new figure of speech

I‚Äôll wait 
if that happen, i think buyer should prefer for it
You know this would actually be really nice. We could accumulate Next Generation graphics cards at good prices. Mine our favorite altcoins. Collect more Bitcoin. Just continue on with life and not even really think about it . then one day you hear that word on the news. Bitcoin. You march on over to gdax. It's been in up trend for a few months. You continue to watch and parabolic run number 3 eventually takes place. You sell a large part of your holding for a good deal of money. Buy a house or another house and the car of your dreams. Then you catch AIDS from a hooker. No wait that's a bad ending. I really need to work on my endings
That's why you should use it as a currency whenever possible. It spreads awareness and keeps you involved with what Bitcoin is supposed to be, a borderless store of value.
I think you dont get the vision! Think about the network estructure that is able to us today, such as Dapps. Xyo for example... maybe, one day we could create a cryptoeducacional dapp, a system of descentralized education. 

They thought that Julio verne was mad when he dreamed about planes and other futuristic things at the time. Same as u are doing right now! 
Crypto's definitely have the potential to change the world m8.
haha, agree. don't think too much in changing this world. it is very heavy
Post on reddit maybe dont change anything, you‚Äôre right. But the thing is, reddit can easily show how the majority of the community is thinking and for this reason, and this reason alone, is that im triyng to say something. Just for the debate, that is valid for me. 
People don't understand why Bitcoin is so revolutionary and important. That's why they think its energy consumption is a bad and unnecessary thing. Once people adopt Bitcoin and understand why it is needed, they will understand why it must consume energy.

oh god...read this https://medium.com/cryptomedication/tether-bitcoin-manipulation-and-its-relationship-with-btc-futures-1bd01b1c540e
ths is what they called "Tether Fud"
Why can't anyone dare speak badly of BTC here?  It's ridiculous really.
Good day to you sir!
Heeey heeeeey heeeeyyy Roooobiiin Hooooood! ;)

no one reads terms and services anymore aahahaha
Robinhood's bitcoin "investing" is complete bullshit. You're not actually buying bitcoin and they aren't actually buying bitcoin for you neither (so nothing really "stays with Robinhood"). 
I wasn't in crypto this time last year but I saw a table that highlighted the gains from 2015\-2018. It didn't say anything about dates but I was under the impression from comments that it was \*during\* Consensus that some gains happened.

But a comment on this thread says "wait a week" \- jeez, I really hope so.
We‚Äôre here. We‚Äôre hodling. 
Right now we are looking to A BULLRUN. we may expect a climb in the market price because of the positive new about the community
You never know.... it might just take a few hours to be back in the green.
Me too
ha
ha! indeed man, in-deed
Yup, just what I said a few days ago. We clear 9700 next week. 
Can you site any sources for that?
How can you tell? Can you share the calculations pls?
Wait a little bit longer...

and then buy and wait for a while
the little piker squeals ...... :)
What is the significance of these charts? Do they follow a pattern established by successful stocks or companies? 
Every weak hand out there is a sensitive panic baby that comes on here and spews there negativity.  I‚Äôm not exactly saying negative feelings=weak hands
I prefer New Balance
Except for new ones
By next week.
F
That's just how markets move.  They run out of buyers at the top, people exit positions they were stuck in,  and people follow the trend.  When everyone is stating that the market is going to go on a huge run with consensus and it doesn't happen, it's a sign buyers aren't in agreement with these speculators.
Crypto is full of masochists, you have to suffer first.

"I think we have to endure this, before we can go up again."

"Not enough despair in this sub, still have ways to go lower before turning this ship around."

"...
Just another excuse to justify the loss of value...

No more than once a day.
Deviant is up like 500% this month... Masternode owners are making $300k per year.
Ok, I guess.
Yacht powered by 1 million lambos engines. Yeah budddeee!
Me too.  
I agree nice thinking
Zzzzzz.

It's a digital token.
this is the place where the emotions and memes of the people bing expressed ab better not to be emotional in interpreting it
No. No one gives a fuck about your or anyone on here‚Äôs opinion on bitcoin. This is the minority of the community. It may be a loud minority but it‚Äôs a minority of ppl who think hope and pray that their opinion is actually going to move the price. No. One. Cares. Having said that ppl do come here to hear about developments or news related to bitcoin since it‚Äôs pretty current
Can you give a rundown on why that is? I'm a noob
I have to say this is one of the most interesting articles around. tnx for sharing!
There's quite a lot of documentation on it.  Here's the original paper:

https://weis2017.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/05/WEIS_2017_paper_21.pdf

Why would anyone speak badly of Bitcoin? That just seems preposterous. If you must speak badly about Bitcoin you have to use the word cash after it. Then you can speak badly
I know,but why would you do that if it gives profits/benefits?
anymore?  Shit dude nobody's read those since the early 90s.
Oh they don't hold the amount their issuing?  If so that's wild
Sauce?
It would be nice!
Making the shirt 
Yeah better to hold right now
Yah neva know.  Just trying to be conservative 
What‚Äôs your cost basis?
just wait  if you are holding some coins it will have its bullrun.timing is very importANT 
Exactly 
I hope we hit the 10k market, that is the time we can call a moon!
Sources? Don‚Äôt need any just look at the past consensus dates and then look at the fuckin bitcoin chart. No sources needed!
i agree.holding it for a while,waiting for the bull to come out
if you're talking about a second wallet which has btc in it that coinbase doesn't know about, just create a new public address in the same wallet and send to that, then the 2 lots of BTC won't be linked
Yes or it will always trace back to Coinbase.  I think a coin tumbler service would do the same trick but either one will have fees.
I bought this. Did you ? Or still to scared to make a call ?
i think weak hands trader should not be here, they must be investing their money in the bank for safekeeping. This community is the place fo the risk taker only
their negativity.
fresh foam Zante for me. heck of a shoe.
And when does it goe back up oh wise one? 
Replace crypto with markets, this isn't unique to crypto. But I agree that people tend to rely way more on technicals in crypto because of the lack of inherent value that could be applied in stocks.

Rise hard back to 8k :)
Bitconnect 2.0?
Lol I wish I had that many bitcoins!!!!  The OP from the thread I posted might be able to do that though.    
Yeah! You just don t understand what token is (informational estructures =logical propositions). With this logical system we get the smart contracts to do all types os services. 
It‚Äôs a debate! If u can read, then u are smart enough to see that I‚Äôm just trying to explain. And you are wrong, I‚Äôm not saying that here are the majority, but the redditers could represent (in a sample) what other communities could be thinking. It‚Äôs a possibility and you can‚Äôt change that, first because is indemonstrable and second,  you need to make a induction based on experience that‚Äôs why is not demonstrable, so the thing is just a debate of opinion. Relax!
Thank you kind sir.  And I will do the disclaimer.  (I hold BTC).  But honestly when you surround yourself with ALL like minded people.  The whole lot becomes less intelligent.
Being a community maybe?  One that informs each other and is not just part of a circle jerk.
robinhood terms :)
Please don‚Äôt ask me that
Oh OK.  So you can't back it up then.  
[deleted]
Lol .... I'm deciding whether to cover my short from 98.  I can walk off with 360k if I want.  

Dude, you have been making wrong predictions all the time.  Maybe you should talk less.
Thanks 
The ability to exchange bitcoin for something else, equally valuable.
Someone is always going to get a block reward. Either it's a masternode owner or a botnet with 100000 1080ti's of computer power.
I bought ATH. Don't worry.
Back up what? I‚Äôm citing events that have taken place in the past and comparing it to now 
yes they would. I think the main issue arises when you go to spend them, if both addresses are used as inputs in the same transaction they will then be linked. but this should happen only of the send amount exceeds the balance in both addresses. Ledger (and probably others as well) makes this easier by giving you the option to create different accounts with different public addresses, and then only sending from 1 account.
$10k didn't work out. I'll give you that. Should have gone up. Still, everyone is wrong at some point. As long as you stay in the game and work the next time you're right.

Omg I‚Äôm sorry for you. Do you plan on hodling or cutting losses?
Sure and I asked since I am curious.  I came to this sub seeking knowledge but generally I only get back shitty or abrasive responses.
My friend, the difference between you and I is that I see the market for what it is while you see the market for what you want it to be.

Don't get sentimental, that's the best advice I can give anyone.
Mixed feelings there. 

When Bitcoin price goes down, it becomes more appealing to buy, that is a fact, but only to the investors who believe Bitcoin will regain its previous value. But the thing is, if the new investors aren't enough to go up against the older investors who want to cash out, I don't see how the price will ever go up. And then, when the price goes up, the fears of another crash begin to stack up. 

Also, Bitcoin is no longer the only crypto being used by retailers, since Ethereum and Litecoin are currently being accepted.


Hodling doesn't cost anything, since I see that money as lost. 

If it ever goes higher, I'll probably try to get my money back. Seen how things are currently, it's probably for 2025, but whatever. I followed the only rule I understood : don't invest more than you can afford to lose.

Thanks for your compassion tho :)
Lol.  Quick Google search

May 22\-24, 2017 & May 2\-4, 2016 & Sept 10, 2015

...now go look at [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/)

My conclusion is that... 2017 had a pump and dump for weeks afterwards but continued its climb anyways... and previous events had little to no effect.  Heck, 2016, BTC flatlined for almost 4 weeks afterwards.
Thanks much appreciated!
