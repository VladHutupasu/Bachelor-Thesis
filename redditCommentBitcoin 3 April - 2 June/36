Daily Discussion, April 28, 2018 -- TITLE
Found out a co-worker has been a Bitcoin "Trader" since early 2016.  He was talking about something like "I'm a crypto-trader-enthusiast," only in the space to make USD profit.

He has no clue how Bitcoin works.  He was shilling "crypto" to co-workers, and Hard forks came up.  He told them something similar to what has been in many news articles about Bitcoin forks, namely that Bitcoin forks are like "Dividends and they increase the total supply of Bitcoin so Bitcoin isn't actually very scarce"

I interrupted and said that all hard forks were, were incompatible software changes with the rest of the original network.

And he replied that "Bitcoin isn't software," something about "its created by the miners," He said something really stupid about what alt-coins were, I can't even remember what it was.   ???

I don't even know what he was trying to say, made no sense.  How can you be in this space for 2 years~ and not  even know how it all works.

I gave up a couple years ago trying to educate family and friends about Bitcoin

New people only care about making money :(
It really *wants* to get higher.
Another day of above average volume on LBC. LOVE IT XD

What ever happened to the SoCal guy who was shilling his desert mining operation and would turn combative whenever someone called him out on it.  He even asked people to make bets to prove his point.
Nice upward trajectory we have going on here tonight. 
For people who both spend and hold, do you use a hardware wallet for your reserves and a phone app with a smaller amount for daily spending? I assume you don't want to carry the ledger everywhere that you go.
Bitfinex is leading the pack with 9500.3, followed by Bitstamp 9481.0, at the end Coinbase 9458.

Can't remember ever seeing the prices so wide spread. Have important arbitage traders gone out of business?
Looks like we're going up. We'll see by the end of the day
9400 is the new black
The volume seems to be dropping off on gdax. Either we're bottoming out and prepare for another pump or shit is about to hit the fan. I'm rooting for door No.1 and prepare my wallet for No.2.
Europe goes to sleep. Make us proud, guys!
Good morning asia. 
Another run at 9400
My break even is 10k. PUSH!!
it's over 9000!!!
Let's stay above $9,000 this weekend.
With $9 400 gone, which it is, I think will make $9 800 tonight.  Probably get through there Sunday or Monday and then spend the rest of the week fighting $12k.
If we would follow the uptrend we've been in for the past two weeks to the end of the year, we would arrive at over 41k. That's 10k more than the McAfee-Dick-Line predicts.

I don't think anyone believes that we will reach that target, so don't worry if we break an uptrend every now and then...

Also, if we continue to follow this trend, 10k will not be broken before May 5th. So patience!

We're on a very good run right now.
$9.4k is very shy.
so what are you all expecting to happen next week? 
Hi, r/Bitcoin! I'm still in need of some more responses for the quarterly reddit cryptocurrency survey! I'm planning at looking at how the community has changed since the cryptocurrency market has corrected sharply.

**If you would like to fill in the survey, you can do that [here.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfhkUsvWO4xAHnXQ1kjOl9tvmubEw_NquQNb3gwCMQN7LJLVA/viewform?usp=sf_link)**

For those of you who haven't seen the results to my previous survey, you can see that [here.] (https://redd.it/848snp)

Live results of the new survey here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Xhw-pnaJrYZ_zizH46Sxz6hoccY4vfTstzz_MZ2ekaM/edit?usp=sharing

Thanks for your time!
So, if I was a complete moron and happened to send litecoins to a Bitcoin wallet, am I fucked or is their anyway to recover it?
Prepare for the next approach to 9.4k...
I'm wanting to get a little laptop or something to use for my crypto wallet (USB) and online banking. I think a dedicated device could help me avoid malware and whatnot. Does anybody have a recommended cheapie device that gets the job done??
hello and good night of France to you to catch the bottle of beer "heineken"...
I already have btc but i'm going to get more - would you say it would be better to buy it all at once or split it across a few weeks/months buying the same amount at the same time each week until i have got the amount of btc i want?
im trying to change the frequency that my s9 is minning? in order to lower temp. i've read about th
tweaking the s9 using awesome miner but is it trustable? 
Anyone use Square Cash to buy Bitcoin?

I'm on android and don't see the Bitcoin option anywhere.

I follow [these instructions](https://squareup.com/help/us/en/article/6307), but step 2 doesn't work.  There's no BTC symbol and swiping left doesn't do anything.

Do I have to unlock Bitcoin access somehow?
Who was the guy going to give up a nut at 10K?  Is he giving up the other one?
hold 9k for today would be fine and a progress in regard to the last weekends. 
If I was a whale I would manipulate the price just to do the opposite of what MagicPoopCannon predicts on Trading View. 
Noob question, There seems to be big resistance wall at 9300-9400. When that goes down does that mean there will be a pretty good resistance at the same point in the other direction? Seemed to have been case at 8700-8800, but not sure if that is by concidence or if that is how math works out.
is it true that the Mt. Gox whale is preparing to sell some btc? 
:)
Need it to stay at around these prices for awhile so I can buy more at under 10k
[removed]
Wtf.
Waiting for someone to put it back to 9000, seems were in a cycle for now.
https://medium.com/@zaptrem/mainnet-lightning-run-lnd-zap-desktop-on-windows-f73cf78dd633

The instructions weren't clear enough. I got my dick caught in the ceiling fan.
Yes! My portfolio is back in the green again. 
9.4 really being tested now.  Good chance to break through me thinks.
It's just a healthy correction to the 50 hour moving average. We're still inside the uptrend channel. Zoom out and don't worry.

A good opportunity to buy.
$9250 new resistance. Would be great if it holds above
Asia is dumping. Oh wow I wonder who that might be. Starts with the letter M   -.-
I'm a horrible person, and when I meet people who are willfully ignorant or think crypto is a get rich scheme I tend to verbally brow beat them for being incoherently stupid. Rolling around in the mud with an idiot will typically get people to stop listening to both of you, which is a far superior outcome for those would-be-scammed newbs than letting them drink  that retards koolaid. I feel similarly about Bcash evangelicals.
Bitcoin is a get rich scheme. Many have become millionaire overnight by getting in at the perfect time while others have lost life savings. There is no regulation and nothing in place to prevent price manipulation from whales. It’s the exact same thing as stocks and insider trading but it’s worse since the SEC is hardly involved. You can love blockchain technology and invest in companies promoting it but Bitcoin And cryptocurrency which was not intended to be a scam...has turned exactly into a get rich quick scam.
You bastard 😆 many of us here wish we had 5 let alone 50!!!
Sell 10 and throw it into $AMZN. In 10 years you'll be able to retire either way. I'm fully expecting to be living under slave owner King Bezos, while running my underground resistance with crypto. 
Almost 500k and its not enough for you? Thats just silly.
McAfee says that be $50 mil by 2020. So yeah. 
agreed.

We did it
We landed boys
And then you Hodl right.  RIGHT
Why do you care so bad about it hitting 10k when it's going to go to a Million? Wouldn't you rather it stay low for a bit so you can invest more?
Same! When you take all the averages of my buys ranging from the lowest at like 4.5k to the highest being 16.4k and everything in between. So yes people, PUSH! 
Quick! Come up with a meme for that, before anyone else does!
Again?
Let's get above $10k this weekend.
Let's not because I'm buying quite a bit more Monday to rebalance my portfolio.  $6,000 would be nice.
The 200 day moving average is at 9.9k. That one will be a very tough nut to crack.
or maybe something else. because.... you can only guess
What happened last year and the year before ? 
I'm going to a party next week.
As long as Mt Gox guy doesn’t sell, we are likely to break 10k next weekend. I think we’ll stay in the 9k range this week.   Once we break through 10k that will make the news and the fomo will be strong. 
Probably will dip below $9k on monday
Nothing
A bit strange that you don't include any questions on how much we've sold etc. For example in the question "Is your current cryptocurrency portfolio worth more than your initial investment?", if you vote no there is no way to know whether that is because its value has decreased or because you've sold a bunch. For example I voted no because I sold, even though the value had increased over ten thousand percent when I did.
Think theyre gone m8
Damn this is a good answer

Tough one!  I hope it was not many.
ouch!
Raspberry Pi 3 with Kali Linux - $30 and everything inside what a computer must have, hardware and software-wise.
A piece of paper should do just fine
Ledger Nano S
HP probook 440G is a good choise, just a single minus - standart size(not small). Also i recently found one project  Paytomat that made me think about future, without laptops and other tonnes of devices, you already can pay anything with crypto and this servise. 
A Trezor or ledger nano is a must buy item to keep your crypto secure 
Bon soir.
?..a Dutch beer
Salute
I’d buy as much as you can now. Bitcoin is highly likely to increase through the rest of the year 
Sorry if this sounds stupid but do you mean the S9 as in your phone?

I wasn't aware phones could be used to mine? What do you use? I have a few old phones I might see if it's practical to get them mining
on the iphone app, there's a button in the middle that says cash and btc. i click that then click the btc tab at the top right, then buy. I can also do it by clicking on my profile photo.

It's an excellent treatment for male pattern baldness you know.
Not necessarily. The resistance is often the position of a moving average. That might have changed on the way down...
Big resistance points often become support once the price goes through it. Like how 9k is holding support in the past few days.
What makes you say that ?
There was movement in the wallets owned by Mt cocks. Smaller wallets send btc to one big wallet. What that means? Noone knows
These people are too biased to give you a straight answer.
Well fuck me. I just sold all my coins at 9200 thinking it is about to crash after I read the article. Now it is at 9400. 😫😫😫
No it's not true.  
52&#37; in 21 days. How long do you think we're going to spend here? I don't think it's going to be very long. Probably not even today. 
If you're going to buy in - then just buy in.  You could wait forever for a 5% dip that may never happen.

When I bought my BTC 4 or 5 years ago, I just bought them - I didn't care 100 USD either way - it is irrelevant now that they are worth 15 X what I paid for them.

If I see promise in a technology, I just buy it - I'll pay 20% over if it is convenient.  Who cares in 5 years?
But IF you are lucky enough to buy dips you increase your hodling. So when it goes to 50k as you predict, you get a bigger slice of that pie
Just don't go all in. So you have fiat money left to buy subsequent dips.
Just wait for the official mainnet release of Zap. Then it will be as simple as installing any other software.
Congrats!

My break even is at 9.9k
Congrats!  Breakeven at low 9s is pretty good.
My break even is at 12.3k lmfao.
9.4k plays hard to get.

Down to 8k we goooooo
That would be support. Sigh

Winklevoss twins are bullish too and say it could reach market cap of gold (300k ish) they don’t say how soon though. 

Either way you will be sitting pretty. Thanks for making me feel poor.  
So I searched google for `reddit bitcoin desert mining bet` and found the guy.  It looks like he's still active here
I like this idea. What’s the best and easiest to use app for phone to use as a wallet for small everyday transactions?  I’d like to be able to just show a barcode or something and select an amount and have it send.  Doesn’t have to be super secure as the majority of my coins would be on hardware wallet. 
It's a fashion reference.
4EVA
I'm not selling at 10k, I'll just be a lot happier! 
because, you know.... maybe it doesn't? 
IMMA FIRIN MUH LASR
You greedy selfish people will never learn. The time for 6k was three weeks ago. Sorry you didn't learn. Don't wish ill on others because you timed the market wrong. 
I think it will go very quickly. Not worried about that. But last time we went to $12k we ended up at $6.5k. 
Educated guess. But agreed a guess. 
You tell me. I wasn't around back then.
nice, I hope you have a good time dude 
no
That's a valid point. I guess I assumed that for the few people who have sold, (leaving them less than when they started) would have interpreted it as meaning would the original amount they had bought be worth more than you paid for it.
Yeah, that was what I was thinking. Kinda shitty, only was a few coins thou
I tried looking it up, and contacted supports, didn't work so I tried posting here hoping some less of a dick than you could help.
Yeah, and don't forget the 6 week course and 2000 page manual. :)
And why Kali
There are very few French beers. Most beers in French supermarkets are from Belgium or the Netherlands.

It's more of a wine producing country. 
Highly likely? Really? This is just wishful thinking, and you should not be giving financial advice based on your wishful thinking.
Antminer S9.  I believe it's the fastest ASIC miner off the shelf.
antminer s9 as miner of bitmain not a cellphone
im just trying to find a way to improve the mining 
Thanks for the response, but it only says "Cash Card" (or however much $$ I have deposited).  No BTC option in the top right either after I click it.
Mate of mine lost his testicle. He's still bald as a baby. 
Just googled bitcoin news and it came up. The article was written only a few hours ago. 
Oh we are, are we?   All of us.  
It wasn't a bad assumption. There's a possibility of a price tumble. The guy is gonna have to sell millions in Bitcoin sooner or later, because the court won't accept Bitcoin as compensation. 

The dip could potentially lead to a short panic and sell off, or it could just create a minor dip and get right back to business as usual. 
i hate people like you. youre the idiots that dump the market after baseless FUD
hopefully at least long enough until I get paid on friday
I'm confused, sounds like you're expecting the trend to continue?
Yeah if. If if if. 
Just buy and hodl. Still a good Time to buy
This is the magic of hodling. Just a month ago I was down 50%.  Now I’m back up.  What a ride!
Best of luck, I hope the community stands by Bitcoin. 10,000 is a huge mental wall.
Mine at 400 USD :)  :)  :)
Didn't you buy the dips? I started out at 15k...
why would you even post shit like this without any evidence or source
FUD. 

If that would be Mt. Gox, it would crash much harder.

This is just normal market mechanics at play.
lol!
he was so close!
Almost. His other brother on the other side of the family's step brother in law's cousin.
so close.
Moose ? 
-Morth Korea?
Give it to me lol I’ll take the stress away instantly j/k.   And I agree work sux 
I just realized I’m an adult BTCer
Shouldn't you be equally stressed that the price might drop to below $1k a year from now?

The chance of that happening is the same as it doubling.
You're talking to the wrong guy. 
he is active on google now? 
Samourai wallet
Damn...now i feel bad that I laughed :-/  I don`t know fashion...all i know how to do is laugh....at almost anything....its my weird way of dealing with touchy subjects :-X  Some of the memes i laughed at when we were crashing a ways back there....ffs....i shouldnt have been laughing :-D  But that one with the bear mauling Leo (getting mauled by bitcoin) had me dying even while loosing my shirt and pants :-D  Glad I kept the faith and stocking up on dip :-P
I know it's going to moon, so I'm not worried about the price right now. I just want more chances to buy bitcoin at value so if the price is low till the end of summer and THEN skyrockets I'll be happy. 
Greedy and selfish is called human nature.

I've been buying bitcoin every week since 2012.  Dollar cost averaging.  I try to keep bitcoin at 6% of my net worth and generally don't sell unless it exceeds 12% during my quarterly rebalancing targets.  I've sold bitcoin 3 times in 5.5 years -- at $900, $3300 and in the $18,000 range.  

So every week I buy a small amount, typically around $125 average.  I retired 3 years ago at age 41 and have been buying $125 a week as usual, but as of last quarter (ending March 31, 2018) I realized my passive income is about double what I expected, so I am doubling my bitcoin purchases to $250 a week, every week.

I am not living off of bitcoin profits, I just want to acquire more.  

Since most people on this sub don't even have $100 in BTC, there's no point in wanting it to keep going up if you want to acquire more.

$5000 would be nice right now.
that was a 100% increase after the 5.9k drop within a week or sth? that wasnt healthy and that was just part of the correction. since that 6.5k movement we experience a steady growth which is good. if we hold the 9k this weekend, were fine
Hope that Happens again
It's not going to be $41k. McAfee dick line is the mean. Go look. 
Thx.  I'll try to have a good time.  It is rather a long story, but basically it is a party to celebrate the lives of my family who were wiped out in a train derailment last week.
Do you hope I have a good time too!?
only a few coins? thats a few hundred dollars man
They really should put something in the sequence to not allow a different coin to go through. 
What? Why do you call me a dick? I just showed you the solution.
Did you get a reply from support?
Isn't your personal and financial security worth it?
But youre also giving advice
Hardly wishful thinking.  Learn how to read charts.  Also if you haven’t noticed the sentiment in the market has turned around, I can’t help you. 
First point: If you’re taking financial advice from this commentary then good luck!

second point: This forum is a one of many places  to pick up on world wide sentiment and It’s pointing up.

 


when i click my profile pic it shows me a list of my accounts. one of the options is btc and when i click on it I have the option to buy or sell. Dunno, maybe someone here has a droid

[Here is the answer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGRNvL9-pVQ)
You need to lose both, or the other motherfucker steps up pumping baldy hormones.
well fuck you too. you must be one of the stupid hodl fan boys who like to ride it all the way down 😂😂😂
No chance. 
Increase. Not just continue. 
If, if, if.  Exactly.  If I weren't a simple minded hodler, I could have sold all my coins at 19k and rebought at under 6k and tripled my amount..

But that's with the benefit of hindsight.  I could have sold, watched the price continue to rocket, and kicked my own arse for the rest of my life.

I took the less risky option and just hodled like I always have.

Heh :)

Nice 👍 wish I was here back then 
Nice but I guess you didn't buy enough at the time, am I right !
Haha!  Mine was around 250 (+/- 50).  I remember that number simply because 1 molly = 0.2 BTC :P.  

It wasn't even a conscious "investment" ... was holding it to buy stuff.  Yeap .. BTC really was used as a currency then.
I initially started at 6k. Highest I ever bought at was 12.3k after it started crashing in December.

> The chance of that happening is the same as it doubling.

Can you explain your maths here? 
[deleted]
I know.  I was just adding to your point. I figured throwaway would see 
Heh.  Don't worry mate.  There's all sorts of nonsense on these friendly boards.

If you laugh at edgy comedy, I couldn't recommend this more:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8DG01q73Nw
Yeah same. Personally I would love for Bitcoin to drop to $1,000 and wipe all these people out. Bring some sanity back to the market.
I don't think it's a problem either, but it will be a bit of a battle. More so than these levels. Going to take a few attempts. 
well then I hope you can focus only on your memories of good times with them and properly celebrate their lives 
you too, dude. I wish good times upon all 
Yeah I know, I'd like to get it back if I could, but it was my fuck up, and I didn't put in any money into crypto I couldn't loose in case something like this would happen
[deleted]
Why did I call you a dick? Look how much of an ass your comment makes you look like. You really think I haven't spent the past week trying  to figure it my self
Yeah, didn't seem like they could help. Got a pretty generic response that basically said their gone
And that would be gdax support
Nah.  Trezor and Windows 10 is fine for me.

(But if things get really bad e.g. someone sends me a phishing email, I'll just climb into my concrete bunker.  I've got enough guns, grenades, ammunition, water and beans in there to survive for 2 years.

I've got Edward Snowden down there - he fuckin loves it.)
And he’s a shorter too 
So in that other answer you deleted, where you came down hard on me, you asked why I am here spreading FUD.

Now to why I am here? I like bitcoin. And the more people get burnt in this bubble pop, the harder of a time bitcoin will have to come up again. 

Because not everybody FOMOing in now will stay and hodl. Most people will pull out when they start losing. They will take their 5% or 10% loss, walk away and never look back. Yeah, that's good for bitcoin /s

So I think people should also know my pessimistic views. And here is what I think: bitcoin can as easily fall under 7k again as it can continue up and test 11.6k again. 

Now downvote me, I am used to it. Remember March 4, BTC at 11500? That's where I wrote [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/81wvhe/daily_discussion_march_04_2018/dv6nkdm/?context=3).

ROFL!  Not sure about your second point .... this forum panics when there's a $100 dip :)
youre probably the stupid fuck that sells at any hint of turbulence and then FOMOs back in went the price pumps. typical buy high sell low.
Bullshit.  

Nobody knows what's going to happen by tomorrow, let alone by next Friday.
Yeah it's hard to know what to do. I'd say there is fun to be had buying and selling, but if you are more serious about it, and have a large investment, hodling is the way forward
Then it's impossible that your break even is at 12.3k. It is somewhere between 6k and 12.3k.
Moose!
He's nadder than a narch hare.
Bro, there's no free lunch.  The risk will always follow the potential upside.  

My advice to you is to have a clear goal on how much steady income you need for retirement.  And based on that, shift to high dividend stocks ... 5%+ is quite common.

K
bahaha.....blocked in my country :-P  censorship is out there :-P
You guys keep thinking in terms of resistance and support, which is bullshit in cryptos.

The price is manipulated by the whales, period.  They don't need sky high prices - all they need is volatility and their partner-in-crime (the exchanges), need the volume.

Yeah.  But I was driving the train.  It's so professionally embarrassing.
yay
but jesus man i dont understand how this happens. i literally triple check everything before i send out any funds and i never send out the full amount in the beginning. always a few dollars first to see if everythings good to go.
Not sure but seems like it's possible by sending to another coins address so I would guess not.
[deleted]
Ok, I was pretty sure that they would be gone but was not 100% sure.  Shitty but just one of those things you have to take on the chin unfortunately. 
I short sell when I think I can make money out of it. But relax - I will have to buy eventually. And yes, I took some losses lately so maybe you can feel good about that, justice is done shorter gets rekt etc.

Last year I traded long here, so we could have been buddies then, right?

Ah, and I have some BTC in cold storage, you know, for later, if and when it moons. Not much, but just in case.

I deleted it because I realized it was a dick response. I’m in a mood right now so my tolerance level for bs and FUD is low. Anyway I’m not gonna downvote you. I think your perspective is misguided. The market is definitely turning around.  Bitcoin is more than just a bubble. Many people truly believe it is going to improve the world and are fighting for it to succeed. 
I think you're both right......it should be worth more by years end but also could go back to I say 78,,,,,,,,and yeah every time the climb back up is slower...new money created the bubble , now folks aren't so quick to buy and a lot turned off after being "burned"
.02  over 
😂😂😂, stupid shit. I've already made profit when I sold at 9200. All shitty little hodlers like you do is keep whining when the price drops. Hodl my dick u dipshit, guess who's gonna buy back in when it goes below 9k. 😎😂😂😂
Just because you're incapable of reading this lot doesn't mean other people aren't. You've been wrong since easter mate. And I haven't. 
Ah. Okay. I can kind of see that.
Which country?  (Don't give too much information away.)
Funnily enough we do get sky high prices all the time. 
You kill people and only think it's professionally embarrassing? What sick fuck are u?
everyone makes mistakes, I hope you have a good time fixing your reputation within the train conductor community 
The fuck u on?
Why did that dude delete his comment already if I was the one that's wrong? Fucking prick
Yeah. It was bout half my crypto, but I didn't really have alot, just had some to try it and see how it goes. It's not like it was my savings or anything


I do not like shorters. Betting against bitcoin is anathema to me. 
Me too I think bitcoin is more than just a bubble, but I still think it is going through a bubble. Maybe you are right and it's done. Would be nice. I would be happy.

Every time up is slower?  Are you high?  Look back at Bitcoin past the  middle of 2017
So if it should be worth more at years end then why shouldn’t the guy buy more right now?  This should be a long game for everyone, not a short one. Anything else is just gambling. For that I have no advice. 
lol okay buddy, im sure the 20 bucks youve made on that trade really adds up. dont go spending it all at once.
Dude, even a broken clock is right twice a day.  

There has been one constant in BTC - morons who think they can read the trend and got rekked.
Break even is the moment when the fiat value of your coins is starting to be worth more than the fiat you used to buy them.

"All the time"?  Strange way to describe an asset that has depreciated 50% in 4 months.  Or has crashed by over $1k within a day multiple times during this period.

A very career-oriented one 
They're pretty cool with it.  Everyone has been caught out watching  porn as they go through a red signal.  This time I guess I was unlucky.

After a decade in fx Bitcoin doesn't pose much of a challenge. It's like watching a movie I've already seen a thousand times in FF. 

I don't even know how you make money in stocks. If it wasn't for the Fed and their free money you wouldn't make a cent and I will put it here in writing for you when that changes you'll be incapable of spotting that as well and every cent you've made will disappear. And you'll spend the rest of your life wonder WTF just happened. 

I doubt you can trade your way out of a wet paper bag. 
wtf.  And you can't watch that link?

So, you killed people cause u were watching fucking smut? And you have a problem with me calling someone who's attacking me a dick? Jesus Christ man, you gotta reevaluate your life
Who's angry? I just think your a dumb fuck is all
So you sold at the ATH, yes?
ROFL!  Dude .... BTC has not even been around for a decade.  And frankly, anyone who can make the claims you made just shows how naive you are.

Anyway, you are on record that BTC will be above 10k next Friday.  As much as I would like to see that happen, I can forgo the $ just to see you wrong.
no doubt!  what a loser bahahaha....hes good at taking selfies tho :-P
Why should I?  

You have already contradicted yourself since you declared "sky high prices all the time".

Gosh, you really are a moron.
Look.  It's not my fault it was 'Bring your family on your train' day, and I fucked up for the first time in my professional career with them all on board.
Er, no.  I'm not a train driver.


I take it back.  Heh.

You come on here asking for advice, tell nice people they are dicks.  Spout off, go into rage mode, call me a dumb fuck, misspell 'you're'.

I know the angry pill you are taking - it's that one for nappy rash.

:)
I bought in easter. I wasn't in last year because I won't chase a parabolic move.  Had to wait for the crash to get in. And of course I had my fx portfolio to handle. So I wasn't in a rush to switch to Crypto.

It was a leap of faith to move actually. The brokers are so dodgy you never know if they're still going to be there in the morning. But I  saw the volatility last year, decided I want some of that and I figured the whole thing had matured enough this year to get in, once the crash was over. 
Fx mate. Fx. Read for the love of god. 

You know what your problem is ? You don't have the confidence to make a call. Now as someone who claims to have been trading stock in a market where you can't make a mistake, I ask myself why you don't have that confidence. It's because you're crap.

My call is BTC above $10k early to mid this week and above $12k before the end of the following week. I.ow's latest Sunday 2 weeks from now.     

And as I've said before. My trades for the rest of the year is already set. You can't read this. I can.

You're projecting your insecurities and your fears onto everyone else. I see it for what it is. Incompetence. You have no idea at all what you're doing. 
-greatest respect to Canada and the Canadians in general tho.  All the *peoplekind* of that nation.
from a neutral point of view you are the moron
Bitcoin hasn't gone from 10 cents to $20 000 in 10 years ? How did it get there without making new highs all the time ? 
Watching smut instead of doing your job is not your fault? Hmmm, I think you might be incorrect on that one
So me calling someone who's being a dick to me a dick is terrible, but saying u killed ur family cause u suck at ur job is normal? God damn your challenged
OMG, how were you driving a train then?!
So your commenting on a 4 hr oldpost, about a post that was deleted within 5 minuets. That dude and u are morons, I wasn't calling everyone dicks, only the stupid fucks that started attacking me for no reason, which was only him, and now u
Mhmm.
Lol ... dude, you are what we call a piker and no disrespect but that's why you are still dreaming of 5 BTCs :).

Anyway, see you next Friday.
This aged well. 
thx :)  dito :)
Wrong.  It has spiked only twice - 2013 and 2017.  

It's already proven that the spike in 2013 was manipulated and went into bear territory for years till the 2nd spike.  That's the reason why we are again in bear territory after the 2nd spike.

Maybe in another 4 years, there will be a 3rd spike.  Till then, we will remain in bear if history is to repeat itself.
T'was a joke..
I stole it???
Because Whydontyoutryit is often on these boards, and seems a nice guy.  

I don't like to see people like you jumping in and calling people dicks when they are genuinely trying to help.

If you don't like the crit., go away.
It's only this year Bitcoin started attracting professional investors. Nothing strange about missing last year. By the time it was starting to get people's attention it was already clearly going parabolic. Rather safe than sorry. We all know how those end.
I never said I'm dreaming of 5 BTC, that was someone else's post. I just commented. Read retard, read.

I don't care what you call me. I have the balls to put down 2 calls for 2 weeks in advance, and I've already traded them. You're still sitting there with your buy every \-$50 bucks below $6500. Farking useless. That's what you are. Can't even read.

What's your call. Let's see it. 14 days from now. What is it going to be ? 
Shrug. Still prepared to call it before the event. Not after. 
I don't care how many times it spiked, 10 years ago it was a few cents today it's $9000. How did it get there without making new highs all the time ? 
Twas hilarious, joking bout killing your family. Don't say anyone is a dick if they are an asshole to you thou, that's going to far thou
Out of somebody’s driveway?
Did you read his comment to me, or just join 5 hrs later and start bitching at me with half the info. When some starts being a fucking dick to me, I'mma reply in kind.

He was helping me? Again, you must not have read his comment
And what do you mean by "people like me"? We all know what you meant by that, but will you say it?
Why do you jump on a 5 hour post if you don't have anything good to add? Your gonna come out of this looking like more of a jackass then him if you keep goinf
Nice ability to read a chart.
... yawn ...  The problem with pikers is that they always want to compare dick size when called out :).

14 days from now?  I don't know and won't pretend to know.  It can start crashing in the next hour and none of us will be the wiser.



That's the point - it didn't and the facts are there no matter how many times you want to insist.

The first spike 2013 crashed for years and did not recover till 2017.

Remove the first spike since it was manipulated and you are left with only the Dec 17 spike as a reference.  Which many believe is also manufactured using Tether.

That's why many people believe it's a bubble and the chart is showing clearly that the bubble is deflating.
You've heard of the Great Train Robbery?  Well it was like that, except I stole the train instead of the money.
He said 'google it' - that's a fairly standard response.  Not rude by message board standards.

By 'people like you' I mean people who behave like you - what are you angling at?  I have no idea who you are.  Except that you are very angry.
It's more logic than reading charts. Pretty obvious what's going to happen next. Don't need a chart to tell me. 
That's because you can't trade. 
And the previous 5 years which you're ignoring ? 
Savage
He said Google it? Haha, weird, it came out alot different on my screen.
Why did he delete the message if it only said Google it?....
You were a forex trader for a decade and you think markets are logical? Okay.
Won't, not can't.

Well, since you are so insistent, my view is that it will (a) crash again to below 6.5k and (b) will not go higher than $11.4k before that.

Therefore, at current price, the upside simply isn't worth it.  

Let's not pretend there's any rationale or maths to it.  The bottomline is that the price of BTC is 100% speculative and there's zero basis for any price.
My opinion - that was when it was used as a currency and the real price discovery period based on that usage.  It settled at around $200, which people felt was fair value for the purpose of trading.

Then came the exchanges, the speculators and manipulations and BTC died as a useful currency.
He actually thinks he can read the market.

Oh well, it is true that the price has been rather positive since he bought in Ester and is looking at this with tinted glasses. 
Yup.
