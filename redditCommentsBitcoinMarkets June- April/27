Long $1mm @ $9277. Expecting a short term bounce early this week as the regulatory rumors are resolved. Stops at 4%. 
"The parent company of the New York Stock Exchange has been working on an online trading platform that would allow large investors to buy and hold Bitcoin, according to emails and documents viewed by The New York Times and four people briefed on the effort who asked to remain anonymous because the plans were still confidential.

The news of the virtual exchange, **which has not been reported before**, came after Goldman Sachs went public with its intention to open a Bitcoin trading unit — most likely the first of its kind at a Wall Street bank."

EDIT: NYSE working on a bitcoin exchange is pretty goddamn bullish to me.

There is something basic in investing that is well known yet missed, risk to reward ratio. Is Buffett telling us that the majority of billionaire Investors became so by investing in safe stocks and commodities? You can make money from "value investing" in promising startups such as Apple and IBM back in the days, but guess what, they were as risky (if not more). Also, you've to be a millionaire (known as Qualified Investor) to even put in your money. It's a bit sad that people like Buffet and Gates are being close minded to something new. Is Bitcoin a risky investment? Damn straight. But it gives us poor bystanders a chance to have a better life. I think it's ok to take that chance. 
If you followed my [quasi long recommendation](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8hcsus/daily_discussion_sunday_may_06_2018/dyj6ug7/) from yesterday we're closing in on an opportunity to exit at breakeven. I think the entry would have been in the mid $9,400s.

Apologies for the poor timing on my part, but at least your stops wouldn't haven hit. 

As to whether I'd recommend closing it, that's a bit of a head scratcher.

While this push above $9,400 is technically bullish, the market is a lot more lethargic than I'd hope — and expect — it to be following the frenzied buying up to $9,950 over the weekend. 

If it were me, I'd probably just move my stops below $9,300 at this point and just take the approach of, "if it keeps pushing up, great. If it drops below $9,300 again, I'm taking my ball and going home."
I come here to say I love you all. don't let crypto take over your life. my wife left me recently, and even though crypto is not the single reason, I realize now it was a bigger part of it than I let myself believe. I was obsessed. I have to cut my short at a loss(thankfully not at 9700 cause I was busy) but my 5x from last week around 9200 is closed and cashed out and I will not be checking in any more. I love the corn. I read the white paper in 2011. I begged her to let me buy a jalapeno in 2012. I begged her for a s3 in 2014. I bought video cards and mined from 2013 to 2016, lost lots of coin to gox and Satoshi dice and the bfx hack. I held thru China ban episodes 1-7. winklevoss. futures. 20k. everything. I will miss you all dearly. don't let the corn die. I have one left on my paper wallet that I will leave for my 3 children to split. I wish you all the best. robslob forever out.
Can anybody link me to a reliable source that says this SEC hearing is even happening tomorrow? I can't find any reputable outlets talking about it, and it's not on the SEC website.
Closed my long at $9,300.

Edit: a combination of being tired of holding it and general impotence from buyers. 
Potentially this was a retest of the bull pennant

Edit: Its also a retest of the log trendline from daily close

Two nights in a row the price has dumped within an hour of me going to bed. Of course if I go to fiat, it will pump an hour after I go to bed. Best to just not sleep the next 24 hours.

To follow up on my comments yesterday I need to start with an apology. The "Consensus" event in NY is next week (May 14-17). Normal time and crypto time have apparently messed with my brain. 

As to the SEC meeting today, it is an internal meeting where the SEC along with the CFTC will discuss how to proceed with the issue of regulating the crypto space. Again, it's an internal meeting and since non-public in nature then means we shouldn't expect any comments made after the fact. I am, however, expecting leakage to the press much like the meeting itself was leaked. 

Before I get down voted, there is no source to my comment above rather my personal knowledge to how these things work with the various financial regulators. Expect pieces to be put into place internally before any public commentary on how they intended to proceed are made public. Nothing necessarily malicious with such an approach. Just how government agencies operate. 

Finally, been seeing ongoing commentary of how low volumes are do BTC on the various indices. While itself an important factor the focus should be on OTC volumes as well. For me that is where buying and selling among large institutions is taking place. 

Now, go out and enjoy the day/evening. 
I’m fairly confident this bear flag will break up. It’s been a continuous pattern.

6 days ago, and on the 26th of April we are looking at essentially the exact same thing, but at a higher price point. 

There are the charts/post from the 26th/6 days ago and they look nearly identical to the flag now

Guys the "SEC/CFTC live steam" that you are watching happened months ago. Goes to show who *actually* watched it last time ;)
Found an article on bloomberg on sec and securities, was published just a little over a week ago.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-23/ether-ripple-may-be-securities-former-cftc-head-gensler-says

It states there that either ether and ripple will be considered as a security will be decided in “ nine months to a year, or 2 to 5 years at the longest”

Is that really all just just nonsense fud that’s been all over reddit these days?

Bill gates: "I'd short it if there was an easy way to do it"

What do you guys think?
Soooo... I'm going to go out on a limb and say this is going to move up... not much relief on shorter time frames currently .. 

There's a [small wedge on the 15min](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Ia1q0SVt/) ... and bull divs on the 1hr... I'll be trading the break  
Just for everyones information. 1D and 3D Bbands have not been that tight since November 2017 and will tighten even more with the next daily close. Having log scale actived 1W bbands have not been this tight since May 2017. Be careful with smaller swing trades and do not forget to set your stop losses, the ocean is quite calm now, but a storm might be just ahead.
I'm setting up laddered buy orders in the **9.2-9.0k** range. Currently we're on our trendline from **7.8-8.8k**, and for now it seems to be holding. However, I think the slope of this line is rather steep and though we might bounce a bit from here (would've expected it to already have happened to be honest) I think it's unrealistic to expect we can sustain that growth. I have more faith in the support line from the bullish pennant we recently broke out of which is currently at about **9.0 - 9.05k** which is also pretty close to our 0.236 retrace. I'm expecting a bigger bounce here.

Closed my long from 9330 when it dropped below 9200... Of course it bounces right after and it seems it was a fake out and now will go up just to mess with me some more...

Flirting with the top of the ascending wedge line on the 30/1Hr pretty deliciously right now.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/QjLdb7eh/

If we can burst through, I’ll be feeling pretty bullish, but I’m also underwater on my long. 

Break down, target of $9200 for a second retest today and if it shows support once again, I think we will see an upward movement from there, although buyers are showing lack of power right now 
It's too early in the morning for this shit. 

There's a handful of short-term formations to potentially draw here, and none of them are bullish:

First there's an [obvious bear flag on the 15m](https://imgur.com/a/n7xhh9L) which would drop price to around $8,900 if it completes with a push below around $9,250. This may complete before I finish typing by the looks of it. 

Next there's a very [janky descending channel](https://imgur.com/a/B0GZCmy) (not a wedge in my opinion), with support in the $9,050 area. 

Anyhow, pretty much no matter how you slice it, we're unlikey to see much upside today — barring a sudden big green candle reversal above resistance. 

The sustained downward pressure itself isn't so concerning, but the lack of buying pressure certainly is. 

You can generally gauge the strength of a trend by the fervor by which counter moves are reversed. When buyers gulp up dips, the underlying upward trend is strong. When they sit it out and let sellers dump to their heart's content, it doesn't exactly project confidence.
"I would short bitcoin if there was an easy way to do it." - Bill Gates

Guys, no one tell Bill Gates about Bitmex, ok?

edit: also, don't tell him about the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Kraken or Poloniex
Just a sad little note that one of the two biggest crypto exchanges in India, Koinex, has a volume of 7 BTC in the last 24 hours. 
The other exchange, Zebpay has a volume 224 BTC. 

7 is just plain sad though. Really hoping positive crypto sentiment can come and hit India again.
So I was able to exit yesterday's long at $9610 about an hour before the sell off...  this drop has me wondering if we're witnessing a trend reversal, but I think it's too early to make that call

If you remain bullish, this price level is a good buying opportunity as we're [near the nadir of the trend line volatility](https://www.tradingview.com/x/rBcrDbzQ/).  We may bounce here off 40 on the 4hr as we did on 5/1 and continue bullish trajectory to $10k

The very recent bounce of $9180 was bought with some gusto... a move bellow however would begin to a paint a more bearish picture with promise of an $8800 retest

Personally I'm out of trade and waiting for things to become a bit more clear
Well since we're collectively preoccupied with the Buffet's, Munger's and Gates' commentary on Bitcoin, I thought I'd share this...

I don't agree with Munger on BTC, but do think he's worth listening to as he has a ready grasp on the social psychological aspects of trading, and along with it human judgement.

[Enjoy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-fe01CA3vc)
If you're looking for a dip this is it.
now would be the time to break out of this downtrend we're in

https://www.tradingview.com/x/MU1WKfPQ/
I apologize in advance if ya want this to be posted in the Alt Daily but think it relates more to BTC than anything else. If you had exactly the amount of money to buy one bitcoin, one ethereum and one litecoin (about 10.4k at this second) for say a relative or a loved one as a long term 3-5 years) investment... how would you invest? polling this community cuz everywhere else is pretty much garbage. 
175b total of net worth gathered around in a room to make dispelling arguments against Bitcoin. Whether they made logical claims or not, that's pretty damn interesting.
Went long from $9350 with stops at $9150.

Bull divs on the hourly ... if $9400 breaks we should move up relatively rapidly.  The quick pickup from $9180 has also given me some confidence that this will move up in the short term.
I kind of forgot about this old log support (going back to the september crash) but it seems it still has some weight!

https://www.tradingview.com/x/KGuTbymM/
!short xbtusd open $9,420

Similar reasoning to why I closed my long. 

Buying pressure has evaporated and sellers are in control. 

I can cut this for a small loss if the market gets back above $9,750 and add to it along the way if necessary. 
Hey guys! Update...

So yesterday, [I posted in the daily asking for feedback regarding my hackathon project that relates to crypto trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8hcsus/daily_discussion_sunday_may_06_2018/dyiyun7/) (my idea was one of the finalists selected for Seattle Startup Weekend Blockchain Edition). I was promptly downvoted into oblivion (like -12 at one point) and perhaps rightfully-so; most of y'all don't wanna see that stuff, especially when the market is volatile.

*Welp as it turns out*...... **WE WON!!!** First place!!

So thank you to the haters that downvoted; that fueled us to work harder. And thank you for those that gave feedback either publicly or in-private; it was super valuable! We're stoked on the win and what the future may hold.

The whole pitch/presentation/demo was recorded so once that gets uploaded, I'll share the video. I was the team lead and guy who presented so bring on the trolls. :)
The meeting is not happening and it was all just BS 
If we can't hold 9200 with strong support.  We will break under 9k.  We got sold very hard around 9200 that led to the dump to 6k earlier this year.
Buy wall on BFX at $9,200 just swallowed about 700 BTC
Well I’m now underwater on my long from $9,536 where I had many opportunities to close it for a great profit, but I Was married to the position and let greed get to me. First position in a month where I allowed myself to get greedy and not take profits.

I was busy over the weekend drinking Don Julio and working, and now looking at a fat loss.

Do I hold my long open? Or close for a loss... We have Erased nearly all of our gains and i cant see how this is going to drop any more 
The media is out in full force to bash BTC. Charlie Munger calling Elon Musk brilliant while calling BTC stupid and immoral...

https://mobile.twitter.com/elonmusk/status/992941109222391808?p=v

Nah of course Elon is brilliant but he seems like he's losing it recently. 

I don't think that media bashing will have much of an impact on the markets because there are less normies involved in the current climate. But still worth mentioning.
Bitmex is lagging bad which tends to happen before a big move, which probably means big move imminent. My guess is up BGD since we are knocking on 420 for the third time today. 
Imma get roasted for this but 

IHS on 5/15m chart with target 9600. 

Currently testing neck for support. 

=)
The 12 Hour chart is pretty interesting right now. It show that 9600 is a developing value area. The selling has been just about average (using 50 periods) but brought the price down 8%. We're above the point of control on the volume on the recent rise up. There was a slight bear div on the OVB and RSI div that I'm going to continue watching on the 12 hour to see if it's been wholly played out. 

Here seems like a logical place for a mid term reversal at least but maybe it wont quite be here. TBH I'm still pretty stunned that the short squeeze play took us all the way up to almost 10K. 8800 seems to be the level that if it breaks we could possibly be in trouble but we could always make a higher low on the weekly or 3d chart. 

I'm personally of the opinion that there's more downside to come and a lower low for the year and maybe another after that (but I'm not counting on that), the real question is if we go up higher from here to break 10K and if so by how much (cus that could be an ultimate bull trap). The better idea is probably to go and ensure that we have some strong support below us between the unconfirmed A&E bottom(which IMO was a large player using Wyckoff(as other pointed out) theory to counter trade for the liquidity) which makes me even more skeptical of the whole move up.

My gut feeling is maybe but not much further (maybe 10.6) to try and build up more longs to squeeze. The long:short ratio is still about 3:2 and shorts are covering... The TDI indicator (I'm totally new to using this) is showing a bearish trade from our second 12hr dump which would have been a 9500ish entry. My heart is telling me to give a long a shot but my head is saying wait for confirmation and either close  my open hedge and open a small long or add to my hedge to make it a short and bring my CA up somewhat.

The 1 day Ichi(this is the indicator I'm newest with so please let me know if I'm misinterpreting it) cloud is green with pretty strong support (flat) but the cloud is bearish a TK cross looks unlikely for a few days on the daily. The 12 Hour though is almost the reverse, we have a green cloud flat support for a few days but a potential TK bearish cross but the usual way to play those is when the candle closes beneath the cloud after a bearish cross and we have a fair way to go down before we're through the cloud. Of course people probably use it a number of ways but that was one strategy I read/saw.

A little messy but this what I've been looking at (as well as pivots and ichi and the chart would be totally unreadable then). No predictions but I will say I'm hedged at 9350 looking to enter a short (which should have been 9900 after that OBV but it was late) https://www.tradingview.com/x/bED3t9Ma/ https://www.tradingview.com/x/bED3t9Ma/. Sorry about the messy charts
Went long on that break of 9400. Target should be around 9.55k for support turned resistance.

Edit: closed for a 10$ gain per BTC.
So I closed my long at a small profit... almost got stopped out...perhaps I'll regret this... but buyers seem so facile here... I'm gonna wait for a bit

For those that have been asking, here is the schedule for this week from the SEC.gov web site. 

https://www.sec.gov/news/upcoming-events#upcoming_events_sec_meetings

From what I've been reading on the crypto subs, everyone has been expecting some news today?  Doesn't seem to jive with the official schedule of events. 
Bears are sure clawing down hard today, but ~9270 may just be as far as they can push it. *knocksonwood*
Unexpected wick bounce and considering 10-day MA sloping upward, bailing out of this position. 

!short xbtusd close 9333
Gonna set a break-even stop on my 9300 long and go attend to matters in the bedroom.  Night folks.
I'm keeping my long open. the buying pressure earlier at $9,200 was intense, and I don't see us going below there in the immediate term. 

just my feel watching the action today, will probably bail in the low $9,100s depending on how we get there (if we do)
Difference between Kraken and Bitfinex price is finally negligible, does that mean that BTC found support around 9250 and is consolidating now. It was really hard to trade on Kraken being 100$ cheaper last two days
Quick question. What are the reasons for bitmex settling in BTC and not dollars?

Edit. Thanks for the repsonses
Really getting caught in the chop past couple of days. Opened a long at 9650 minutes before the big dump and got stopped out for a loss. Wish I had not set stops in retrospect but I thought we might be seeing sub-9k so figured I'd cut my losses. Opened a cheeky high leverage long last night prior to the Mex funding pump but ended up getting stopped out at break even a few hours later. Wish I had just closed it for a quick scalp when I was in profit. Seeing ~9180 made me think we'd see 8800 so I stayed out of position and now here we are back at 9400, albeit not with much strength it seems. I would've expected us to rally back to at least 9.6/9.7 a little quicker so now I'm skeptical and will be staying out of position. 

So in retrospect I should've shorted 9.9 hard using the 10k sell wall as a stop loss and could've consistently opened high leverage longs just before every funding pump since then for some quick scalps (or held onto the short to get that funding). Live and learn. 
Disclaimer: new to crypto, take everything I say with a salt mine. I mention altcoins a couple of times but this is primarily a bitcoin post. I don’t care about most coins, theyre just there to make me more btc. Surely that counts as btc trading? also, this post is mostly unstructured rambling but my grammar and spelling does suck. like a lot.


Nothing like waking up at 4am on a bank holiday, but got shit to do so figured might as well get up and get on with it.


Started with restructuring my portfolio again. I seem to do it quite often but I always find new little ways to make it better. Today, I did something I shoulda done a long time ago: differentiate between trades and investments. It’s certainly clean up my portfolio and made it a lot easier to differentiate between coins I actually care about and just stupid shitcoins that make me more bitcoin.


I think this coming week, and the month of May, will be pretty awesome for crypto. Ive only been here since September/November so this stuff will just be based on charts. In 2015, may was relatively quiet but june was a bit better. In 2016, may and june were both pretty great and in 2017…. Well 2017 was just crazy in general. There was a fantastic table that someone made, circulated on twitter a lot right at the end of Q1, it showed btc movements split into quarters and Q2 is usually one of the better ones. Shoutout if anyone can find it. Ref: https://www.tradingview.com/x/BUgTJTjp/


Okay, so historically, next two months should be pretty fab. I understand that history is no indication of future but this a hype driven, speculative market. For an explosion in a market like this, you need insane buy pressure and then something to pop that pressure. Fuel and ignition (not sure if that metaphor even works). The demand is there imo, we’re all greedy fucks, and I mean that as people in general, not just traders. I theorised before that breaking 10k would create a media onslaught and more FOMO than in Dec/Jan. I think theres a lot of money on sidelines that never left, money that pussied out (or exited smartly) AND two types of money that never entered. Two types imo are those that registered on coinbase/gdax but didn’t buy and those not registered yet but I don’t think it really matters since both of those need a trigger to buy.


We have the demand (or fuel) and we just need a spark or trigger to ignite it. I think there’s two pretty good contenders. First of all, the SEC and ETH situation. I think the decision was made a long time behind some closed doors and now it will just get announced that it is not a security. Think of coinbase and circle. Circle had SEC approval before buying poloniex so if ETH was to be a security, I reckon theyd know. Same for coinbase. I don’t know, could be bollocks but still, considering that ETH is lead bull, good ETH news could trigger the whole market.


That’s one trigger, second one is Consensus. I think a lot of coins/developers/teams/whatever are waiting for consensus to make announcements. It makes sense as well, why make release news during a bear market when you can just wait and release the news a little bit later at the biggest (?) crypto conference when the market recovers a little bit. Also, id like to find what the correlation is between consensus and may/june being historically good months but im too thick to do that.


Now this is the last point im gonna make. Im not into chemistry so this could be bollock and therefore correct me if im wrong but doesn’t pressured fuel burn more than unpressured? I think that right now, crypto is a gas cannister filled with demand and the pressure has been building for ages, just waiting to explode. Reuters talking shit (https://nypost.com/2018/04/27/bitcoin-has-become-boring/) but it shows the lack of volatility. Beautiful twitter thread on this topic: https://twitter.com/carterthomas/status/991129801745317888


Closed my short from 9650 at 9340. Made a couple of % and doubled it with funding so not complaining. Was targeting 8600-8400 but I don’t think we’ll go there. Decided im gonna go heavy long on the market as a general but im ready to pull the plug on everything in case of shitty SEC news.


TLDR: May/June usually good months, plenty of demand (imo), triggers incoming, built up pressure, going long.
The entire idea of crypto is to get away from 'a group of men' making decisions for you. When will this sink in? Don't tread on me.
Are people really selling because of a mysterious meeting that we dont even know if is actually happening?
I have one comment to the whole Bill Gates/Buffet/old grandpas with privileged background dramas.

Look at who entered the bitcoin market, who made over 1 billion competing with the Bank of England foolishly trying to defend the pound on the free market,  never gets married to any position/investment and can change his mind 10 times per day and is one of the best hedge fund managers and speculators of our age.


Also think of who media hates vs loves, vs who makes money in those markets and not. Then the answer who to listen to and not is quite easy.
Not enough panic over what we saw last night. I'd be wary about this being a bull trap.

Go to the 2014 chart and overlay it onto 2017 to current. Shorters must be licking their  chops.
I'm starting to think this is just another buying opportunity before the eventual breakout over 10k. Reminds me of how annoying it was when trying to break 3k and 5k.  kept on thinking it would break up but always failed.  but then that one time it did break and it was awesome and i regretted not buying more
Still !long XBTM18 9478 10X 50% after catching a few more knives.

We still haven't put in a close below my box and the wick down is really looking like a short term bottom coupled with the bull divergence. I'm betting on a bounce here. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/YromZm7A/
Absolutely don't believe Bill Gates is against new technology, as for Warren Buffett I really have no idea honestly. I'm more referring to the state of financial Security that they would like to maintain. A lot of people who have bought Hook Line & Sinker into the stock market and economy in general as it stands have a lot to lose should Bitcoin be widely adopted. Now that is not to say that I believe Bitcoin will have any type of widespread adoption in the near future or ever, but those who do believe are very vocal so an outsider looking in would feel that every Bitcoin enthusiast has that goal. I am more of a realist, but I understand others enthusiasm. My point about Buffett and Gates is that they have an intrinsic desire for Bitcoin to fail, because they believe it would be indicative of a failure of the status quo should it succeed and its ultimate goal.

Looks like a second bear flag being printed here with rejections from the EMA12 on the hourly.

I think we're seeing the beginning of the weekly trend reversal to begin setting that higher low.  However, the market will want to see the daily lower high first.  I'm guessing a pretty classic H&S will be forming here to confirm the reversal.  I could see the second bear flag breaking to the 8900-9000 range with a rally over the next 24-48 hours up to 9400-9600 and a failure to close above that price which will signal the end of the weekly impulse and the beginning of the weekly correction.

My target still remains ~7500 for the weekly higher low.


If there is one thing that is sure today, is it that SEC insiders already placed their bets and will make a lot of money very soon 
As I posted elsewhere, I had my all-in 8x long from 9280ish close overnight at 9790 on a profit-stop. My Sept futures long from 6410 finally also closed on a profit stop at 9890 (knew I should have taken 10400). Between the two, I doubled the stack from where it was last week. 

This drop has been precipitous, and it's starting to feel like do or die. I'm opening with the profits here near the bottom of a falling wedge, above pretty solid historical support of 9250-9300. We're also in a bear flag of sorts, although its flagging downwards so I'm giving it less weight. I'll be looking to exit this if 9150 falls.

Long $200k from 9245, unfortunately order did not completely fill. Action here looks similar to action previously before big moves. Stop 9k
Took 20% off my long here, fairly uncertain what this is going to do atm 
SF Fed says CME Futures ended the bull run:

I'm curious to hear what others here think of their analysis now. I remember when it happened there was a lot of speculation for and against, but the predominant consensus seemed to be that the volume was insufficient to amount to much, but the authors argue that futures were the defining factor. (Sorry if this has already been discussed - I looked, but didn't see it elsewhere)
Good time to lighten your longs & await the next dip.
Closed half of my long from 9350 to get a small profit. Kraken is now almost in sync with bitfinex when it was almost 100$ behind on the weekend which makes me believe there is still a bit of strength in this push to 9500. Since we are in a rising wedge, it is probable that after that we go down. 
Model price based on tx rate: 7-day average: $5131, 28-day average: $4997.

 Model price = 10^-0.638 \* (tx per day)^2.181 / # total coins.

Explanation is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2hyl9c/daily_discussion_wednesday_october_01_2014/ckxhy9y) with [historical graphs of price vs. model](https://i.imgur.com/HnZQ9rv.png) (last updated 2018-04-09) and [graphs of other correlations](http://imgur.com/a/7koaG) (last updated 2017-01-30). The code is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2oyrfq/code_for_tx_model/) if you want to improve on it.


**Accuracy of model and recent bearishness**

 Note, that this model has been doing relatively well if it is within *the same order of magnitude* of the price. That is to say, it is not a very accurate predictor of price, and to be within a factor of two of the market price (as recently) is effectively no strong signal. However, the prediction did dip just before the recent pop.

**Batching, UTXO count and so on.**

I have seen no convincing evidence that batching is currently a major effect to reduce the daily tx rate, and a cursory examination shows a similar dip in the UTXO network measure.
I am interested, long term, in alternatives to tx rate (given lightning etc) but I do not think UTXO count is a convincing alternative over, for example, unique addresses.
Parsing the blockchain directly for outputs per block is one possible alternative to deal with batching, payment channels notwithstanding.
Jun and Septembers futures premiums are still too high. They are higher than they were last time we were at these price levels before the run to $10k. To me, that screams that a lot of margin longs opened between $9500 and $10k and they are currently underwater but aren't capitulating yet. I expect we go down until the margin longs capitulate. The market is not gonna give any free rides to $100k\+. 
[deleted]
Waiting for the <$9000 dip.
Think our best bet for a bullish continuation here is a good bounce from the 1d Tenkan(8960), if not then I think we could hit the weekly 50 SMA, which would be really uncomfortable for the bulls
Interesting to see us back to where we were about a week ago. I was actually thinking of longing if it dips, but it dipped so much \- I'm back to my previous mindset and I've just shorted. Also the Okex futures have like  $100\-$200 premium for the past two days. Crazy \- not sure if this is related to the large liquidation a while back.

Maybe related to the Okex futures illegality issue going round the news?
I understand the frustration of the trade bot spam but I can also see the potential utility. Are there rules or guidelines I missed on how to use / how not to use the bot? Might it be better to have a separate sub for it?
https://www.tradingview.com/x/hZh26wmX/

we broke out of the downtrend, albeit not convincingly. 0.5 FIB from this retrace could act as support
there is nothing on sec site about this meeting , IS IT REALLY HAPPENING?
[deleted]
Do people still see us falling off a cliff again? Possibly below 6K this time? 

Edit: The fucking hell did I get down voted for? Jesus. It was an honest question on current sentiment. 

Edit 2: Nevermind. Think it was a glitch saying I had -5 downvotes. My bad. Lol 
Looks like we are heading for another attempt of 9.2... anybody thinks it’s a good place to open a new long entry or will be going further down?
One thing is for sure, lots of money exchanging hands today
I got stopped out of my long over the weekend at roughly breakeven.

!long XBTUSD close 9620

Right now I'm holding out and watching this support line [on the 4H](https://www.tradingview.com/x/QO0I3dhV/). Breaking through that, next support would be at the bottom of the kumo around 8800. There is a hidden bullish divergence which is adding to my recency bias to go long. 

I'll be looking at the alts as well for any sign of a big bounce.
It blows my mind how much the price fluctuates over such tiny tiny orders. Is it like only bots buying and selling these days?? Feels like most of them are in the .00xxxx amount.
[Anyone else notice this shit today?](https://imgur.com/a/9mVQPuO)
Zooming out is quite depressing at this point. 

It will require quite some patience. 

https://i.imgur.com/NtyeePu.png

At least it makes you realize this last rally wasn't as monstrous as the 2014 one, 2014 was more violent. So maybe the outcome of this big drop will surprise us in a good way.
seeing all the bear posts get downvoted, I think some pain is coming in here :D    
In the aftermath of the Mt. Gox incident, the prevailing theology was "Don't leave your coins on an exchange." It has been a while since a major exchange incident. Do not forget the possibility that your exchange of choice could at any point no longer offer access to "your funds." When the assets leave your hands, they are no longer yours. While today's pending SEC statement on Ethereum may or may not have a major impact on Bitcoin markets, it is vital to remember the possibility of SEC enforcement action and any possible ramifications. Until legislative action clarifies the status of other currencies, and as long as major exchanges are handling assets that may be classified as unregistered securities, the entire crypto space remains in jeopardy. 

This is not FUD, but merely an attempted wake up call to the masses oblivious to such potential market influence. Again, today's expected statement may not be detrimental in any way to markets, however, realize the potential. If an exchange is participating in the sale of unregistered securities, the SEC can come in at any \(business day\) moment and freeze the assets of that exchange. I'm just asking you to consider the blowback of such an event, and realize it as a possibility. 

The SEC would love for new legislation to clarify if a coin that had an ICO in 2014 is a security. Until then they are forced to enforce the law as it stands. Contact your politicians; State the need for comprehensive securities reform to reflect new and changing asset classes. and: Don't leave your coins/fiat with an exchange. 
!long xbtu18 close 9781

Got fully stopped out overnight.

These 2 entries of mine aren't so accurate though in terms of PnL, as I had taken profits higher up and did scalping all over the place, and a first layer of stop losses had been triggered 12 hours earlier.  But at least the initial ca'd position and final line in the sand are registered.
Was playing around with some longer term trend lines. Interesting that this line acted kind of as resistance now on log scale: [https://imgur.com/a/VACYrsg](https://imgur.com/a/VACYrsg) 
that is what I am seeing: [https://imgur.com/a/v8TxDEp](https://imgur.com/a/v8TxDEp)

I really hope we retest if the support of the wedge \(now probably resistance\) as I have closed a part of my short and will reopen if we get there.

\(check the last 3 large scale wedges, we had many minor break outs here and there but they played out as in the text books\)
Every single person who has bought and held for six months or more is in profit. 
Seems like the rule to sell when bulltards like [parthosn](https://www.reddit.com/user/parthosn)  \([https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8h691m/major\_downtrend\_is\_broken\_now\_get\_ready\_for\_moon/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8h691m/major_downtrend_is_broken_now_get_ready_for_moon/)\) start calling for a moon is still valid.
Expecting a slight retest of the old resistance line sitting at 9.55k now, but I do not think we get to 9.55k again, if we get rejected below 9.45k would be pretty bearish IMO.
Maybe too early to draw, but never too early to start considering.
Possible Inv. C&H on the daily.
This would mean another ( if to occur) another 56% drop from here, or a 38% drop from the cup line on the breakout. Target should be in case it happens, high 3900 usd. Which coincides with the hyperwave theorie. that we are in fase 7 and that it could be a bottoming level on this crypto bubble pop.
I do hope for a higher low though, however, i believe the bear is not over at all. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/Qhh08ib1/
I'm going long here, time-frames up to 1H are in (nearly) oversold territory, and I believe the 9k-9.2k area should provide good support.
If we going back to $10k, now is the time.
Ah, classic Bitcoin 180 degrees action - haven't seen that in a while... :D
Good support, aprouching psychological support, and the bottom of the channel, expecting a bounce today even in a bearish scenario. So, I'm long from 9200 and have more buys at 9130. 

!long XBTUSD 9200.5 1x 80%


1h RSI almost reset. Another bear flag gonna get us lower, or is it different this time? Anything above 8800 would still be a higher low, mid-term speaking . 
Damn someone is really in a rush to sell 
If we make a higher low today compared to 05/01 we will have a hidden bullish divergence on the daily. Pretty sure we will retest 10k and more this week. 
seems like we are heading into a descending wedge that tests the support line any moment next. support would be now either 9130 USD or 8930, depending on how you draw it.

Edit: Ivalidated above 9360 USD

If 9130 USD as support holds I expect a slither drop and then a bounce to above 9.4k

If we go sub 9k we could be really getting into free fall and it would be quite risky to catch the knife. \(it is more a channel than a wedge than\)
FYI, the rise to 10k wasn't THE short squeeze. The squeeze I'm pushing won't happen until 12-18k.
[Pretty important support for the bulls](https://prnt.sc/jepmos).

Still anticipating a weekly lower high, which may have already been hit. I thought I'd have 3-4 more weeks to start building my short, so I hope we make a Daily higher low and try to push up. Still hoping for early June to be the top of this crypto cycle, as happens like every year.

Daily volume is shit and will eventually pick up again, but probably bearishly when bulls fail to push pass resistance. If that happens, will we set another higher low? Personally, I think we'll see 4.5k at least but its also dependent on any bad news about tether or if we've finally reach the peak of our economic cycle here in the US and the stock market majorly corrects (as its poised to do) [Bonus pic](https://i.imgur.com/vHSerqG.png)
Kraken is having some serious issues right now. My margin buy limit order at 9205 hit, just to get cancelled instantly because Kraken can’t provide enough margin for everyone.

No wonder we’re not seeing a bounce if people can’t go long.
[deleted]
That pump fail to break and remain over the downtrend line, but that line is slanting down fairly steeply, so another try will likely be forthcoming.
Does anyone know when exactly today this SEC meeting respectively statement regarding ETH will take place? This might really be a sell the rumour, buy the news event i think. 

A descent is forming another triangle meaning we have a chance to buy back at bottom 6k again?

I remember when bitcoin was in a 20k bull run in december. I remember then 24hr volumes on GDAX then was like 1000-2000 BTC. Now on GDAX volumes are low measly 200-400 BTC 24hr. 

So from this it is impossible to sustain another bull run on low volumes?

Warning: bullish hopium tinfoil hat conspiracy bullshit ahead.

If you were trying to accumulate a large amount of coins (say, tens of thousands or more), wouldn't it make sense to keep USD as collateral and buy long on margin instead, to paint a picture of overbought margin longs and plant seeds of doubt in any competing buyer's mind as price keeps going up with your big fat buys? Then if / when someone tries to run a stop hunt for your longs, you happily continue to scoop up the coins and eventually convert your margin longs into actual coins with your collateral USD to cause the next fomo surge as thousands of longs close without dropping the price at all.
Guys, let’s be honest.

If you had the money to gamble a massive short and still be rich if you were wrong, you would short the shit out of this bubble too

I love Bitcoin, but I would short the shit out of it if it didnt kill me inside

Is it more likely that we'll see a move up with a SEC ruling that ETH, XRP etc. are securities with traders dumping for BTC, or a drop as people exit cryptocurrencies altogether, with the ruling perhaps setting a precedent?

Bitfinex will push to $9700 during the afternoon pump.  Around 5pm ET.  I would wait before shorting(personally wouldn't dare to short at this level).  If you are long underwater, will provide a window of opportunity to shave off your position with either a small gain or minimum loss.  To those of you that are on the sideline, excellent trading decision.  
15-min candles showing the most beautiful rounded bottom. Bullish AF.
I have a question for you all.  On Binance, BTC started a little upswing from 9250 and got stopped at around 9390 two times in a row in what looks like carbon copy curves the past few hours.  Does T.A. tell us anything about repeat occurrences and what to expect with this?  Thanks. 
We are almost blue again on the rainbow chart

We haven't been purple for over a year, but there is a case to be made for it as the last two big dips where green and blue.

Hi Guys, does anyone perhaps know which US exchanges will allow credit card purchasing?  I am not a US Resident.  Thanks!  Please excuse if question is not allowed here.
Alert, alert, all bulls beware:

Bill Gates just said he will short bitcoin when there is an easy way to do it. This means the richest man in the world has his money ready to completely and utterly destroy bitcoin, and with it the entire cryptomarkets (as in; bitcoin drops to $1), as soon as someone develops the opportunity to do so; which is just a matter of time.

Beware. These prices are delusional, BTC has no intrinsic value. Use it to accumulate wealth, but dont use your wealth to accumulate it.

Can you elaborate on your decision? Why do you expect a positive/not harmful output from the regulators? 

I’m long but I feel like I’m gambling now because I don’t know what’s going to happen. 
How did the rumors get resolved? Can't find any particular post-news.
I actually don’t see how we can remain in a bear market with all this news coming out, it’s almost unrealistic 
“Buy and hold”


I hope that’s literal. 
Wow.  Extremely bullish, this kind of thing can kick off the next run if officially confirmed.  
Confidential plans means telling ny times?
Yes and I'm sure a law will be passed that says if you are in the USA, you buy from the NYSE or aren't allowed to buy (without facing risk of imprisonment).   
All these johnny come lately exchanges are going to open to crickets chirping. 
This makes me wonder if there were billionaires 40 years ago that warned everybody against investing in tech stocks like IBM, Microsoft, Apple and Google.

Buffet and Gates belong to a dying era where people of means believed that those of a lower economic status than themselves must be shepherded like cattle in order for them to be productive members of society. Hence, all the restrictions on what those "not qualified" are and aren't allowed to do with their own capital.

You could argue that these restrictions might have made sense before the advent of the Internet, but the market for information is now far more developed and the old system is starting to hurt much more than it helps most people.

thanks for the insight
Okk.......
I am getting the hang on your recommendations. You usually read the market faster than the market itself :)
Both yesterday and when you longed 9100 after the drop from 9700 i went along. Both times i got stopped at breakeven (on the one from 9100 i suspected that your stop @8800 was to tight so i went to 7750 and got away with it. Got recked on the next trades but that was just my fault :) )

Today i got scared and stopped @9230 (ok, your post also scared me a bit :) ) from my long @9330, but reentered with a smaller position @9360 (since kraken didn't have any money to borrow when it was in the 9300's).

Even so i'll probably enter the same positions you enter as long as i'm not in position, knowing it can go right and can go wrong. But you can't do much worse than my 8 consecutive trades in the red/breakeven.
PM me any time you want to chat brotha, doesn't have to be about the corn.
Best of luck, robslob. May you find hobbies and passions that bring you peace and happiness. Everyone has their addictions or at a minimum, things they do to the detriment of other aspects of their life. Chin up and just keep on livin man, l-i-v-i-n.


Life is a long journey. I wish you the best. Take care.
That is tragic, but good of you to share. I hope you find a better way to live, addictions don't always involve drugs. I was obsessed the whole of last year and used the peak as a point to say if this can happen with what you got you don't need to trade and I decided to just hold long term (and was flung straight on hot coals for the audacity, but I'm still holding). Sitting so long in front of a screen when I have to for my job too was just not working for me. That and the emotional rollercoaster of trading put a huge strain on my relationship. I still monitor the price way more than I should, but at least I have some of my life back.
All of my friends that are in crypto are banned from talking about it at home. My wife is cool about it now but I did turn off my mobile alarms and just set orders on gdax. I noticed that it was starting to consume my life, especially in January when ethereum hit it's ath. 
fuck bro, keep your head up. plenty of fish yada yada. hope your kids and yourself are ok. do what's best for you.
Your wife leaving you is a good thing, not a bad thing.  Make sure you secure that paper wallet.  In a couple years you'll be feeling a lot worse than you do now if you let it slip away.

Good luck.
Stay strong brother.
PS I remember reading a lot of these farewell letters in the 18-20k range in Dec.

not to profit off misery.. but let me uhh log in and do a few trades..


Appreciate the sharing. As a new comer to the crypto space your advice and warning is timely and to the point.  Fingers crossed and best wishes!
Taking a break is a great idea, and sounds like what you need right now. There's a brief period of anxiety ("what if it's $50K/$3K next week/month and I *miss it*?!?!") but that fades after a while...and holding on to a little bit like you are definitely helps with that. Then you'll adjust and start enjoying the other things you like in life more again. It's all about balance. You might get reenergized and want to engage with Bitcoin/trading again after a while, or you might not. But taking that break will help you rebalance and figure that out for yourself.
> my wife left me recently, and even though crypto is not the single reason, I realize now it was a bigger part of it than I let myself believe.

SEC was supposed to discuss potential Bitcoin ETF listing on ARCA behind closed doors.  I wonder if this meeting is about that matter or are they actually speaking front of Congress or something?  The ARCA news wouldn't surprise me, since SEC hinted it do not consider BTC as a security.  I am expecting a positive outcome this time.  Even though 9/10 times any SEC news fucked bitcoin pretty hard up the bum.

Tethered all my alts and btc at ~$9330

1. I really can’t sleep and look at the charts at the same time, and it’s already 1:15 am here in Europe 
2. The risk reword ratio doesn’t seem that appealing at the moment 
3. Really need to sleep.
I understand that boredom is a powerful motivator and that buying impotence is starting to show, but given that you seem to have been more interested in getting in at a good position (sub 9k) for long term gains vs short term why not simply move up your stops to say 9.2 in this case?
What's your current medium-term bear/bull split? Are you skeptical of the log breakout yet? Are you just waiting for a further dip and a better long entry? 
Was thinking the same thing [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/JUckaCsz/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/JUckaCsz/)
That's my take on it as well
Let us know when you go to bed.
The sad truth is that sleeping results in losing money if you are trading.  You can set alerts to wake up, but trading when you are 3/4 asleep doesn't often lead to best decisions either.  
Thanks for posting this!
you still have people saying its an 'internal working session'.  If its not public, how do they know about it?  What's the source of this information?

This should be the best comment of the day 
"now I gots to call and get me a meatball sangwich!"
Yeah I have this impression people think this SEC meeting will be like a Trump Executive order or something, with a big press crown and their director saying "And today we decided X"

That's not really how government agencies work
Can you link to any official source saying this meeting is actually happening? I didn't find shit.

This article states that "the prospects of the SEC taking action are remote", and that "Gensler’s background is at the CFTC, which does not have a role in determining what constitutes a security".
why is there always fud like this when we hit an important level and right after we have a dump? seems coordinated /tinfoilhat
Well he is one of the richest guys in the world but he is fiat rich. If crypto really does wget adopted he will no longer be one of the richest. I'd say the same if I was him.
who the hell cares? As they said, if you really believe then it does not matter.
Also he is right, a lot of people just get in for the money and not for the tech, thats why stuff like XVG happens. At the end of the day btc is here since almost 10 years and it shows some use cases other cryptos not so much.
Don't forget that people don't know the difference between bitcoin or any other coin.
I see several old men grasping to understand a future that doesn't include them. Even Gates feels the need to point out the utility of block chain. 
He also said it was a technological tour de force.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1dx6rq/bill_gates_bitcoin_is_a_techno_tour_de_force/
I think these two people will be dead before btc has reached it's full potential so it's hard for them to take it seriously.
I'm not surprised. The simplest answer is that humans are greedy, and these three want your money to flow into traditional investment vehicles. It doesn't help them if you buy BTC.
A man with money and connections like him can set up a trading account in Chicago Futures Exchange in a few minutes I assume, what is the problem?

Oh he's just another intellectual yet idiot that thinks he understands markets. Ah nothing to see here
I like Munger .. he's an exceptionally smart dude ... but no one on the panel really made a cogent argument against BTC as a viable technological replacement for sound money.

They're right to think the space is still highly speculative; cypto has not come close to replacing things like gold or fiat... but they'd be remiss not to recognize the now 10 year track record of BTC's anti-fragility and the real fact that billions in VC capital is pouring into the space which should engender some confidence that crypto will continue to mature.


bill gates is an old man who doesnt get technology.


Zooming out, I agree.

What does the bot do?
If he genuinely believes it's rat poison (which certainly seems to be the case), then he honestly feels he's doing a public service by shouting that fact from the rafters.

You may not agree with him, but that should explain why he's not just moving onto something else. 

He's either a good person who has a different view of bitcoin than most here do...or he's a greedy, selfish asshole who wants to see the cyrpto space burn so that his non-crypto investments don't suffer. 

I like to believe it's option A instead of option B.
Not that his opinion matters much for bitcoin, but I think it's noteworthy how harsh he is about bitcoin
aka: it doesn't fit any of my legacy fiat models or world views.

> sorry Warren, we don't care.
A couple of things to note:

1) Buffet never invests in new technologies. He's a corporate raider with a "nice grandpa" PR imagine.

2) Buffet isn't that great of an investor but he does have extremely sage advice on *money* and basic financial literacy.

3) [The technical literacy rate of people is a joke](https://lifehacker.com/this-chart-shows-how-computer-literate-most-people-are-1789761598). The only literacy rate lower in people is financial literacy. Most people can barely turn their computer on much less understand what or how even basic parts of it function. Cryptocurrecny is an even more complex hybrid of technology and digital financial asset.

Therefore while you shouldn't listen to him on technology, you should listen to him on money (not investing). Here, he's absolutely correct that the vast majority of people don't understand what they're getting into and simply gambling because they wanna get "easy" money, quick. That's not how it ever works out and people just lose.
Sounds like buffet is about 6 years too late to the buttcoin party.
sadly no.
I wish, but sadly no
No, sadly, but I wish
Sadly, no
The price is going up but somebody keeps dumping hard (1K market sells) on retail traders. It seems smart money is causing the pump to squeeze out the shorts so they can cover and enter their shorts before the market finds out the news of Bill Gates shorting Bitcoin.

[Large Trades Tracker chart shows the ponzi believers are getting crushed hard by huge whales](https://i.imgur.com/sQyhFha.png)

Do not mistake this for organic demand to own Bitcoin. Anyone who pays attention to the news knows the only move to make right now is to short. However the fact that Bitfinex is leading the pump right just shows that we could still go up for awhile before they realize that people aren't FOMOing in like planned. They'll send the signal to Bitmex and then we're one red dildo away from goblin town and 3-6 months of fake volume by wash trading bots.


> The sustained downward pressure itself isn't so concerning, but the lack of buying pressure certainly is. 

It's not been mentioned today but as well as SEC uncertainty in the USA here in Europe it's a 3 day weekend and it's really lovely weather outside, hottest May bank holiday here in the UK for 40 years.

Just an FYI.

Typing from a sun lounger. Waiting for the ice cream van.
Suddenly the sub turns bearish.
I guess you still hold your 8.8k long \- if so, why?
Not sure if this adds to any thought processes but public holiday in loads of countries in today... May day or labour day.
I don't think TA is very relevant at the moment , but what do I know 

Sounds like you had a rough night.
its not only not a wedge its starting to get a bit disorderly.
Another poster mentioned this but that bull trap candle last night was clearly some whale taking a giant dump.  No increase in shorts.  We failed 10k and he saw his exit.





I did have your channel as a wedge, and I'm expecting the 9250 high volume node / historical support to hold. I believe the market reacts to it FUD/news irrationally, and I try to trade against sentiment when it seems like a big bag of nothing (SEC hearing nonsense). I went with swaps this time, to not get bled on the futures premium dissolving. Stops below the not-wedge breakdown. 
he can short on CME, he can short on Kraken, he can short on Polo(in the end owned by Goldman Sachs, an american big company)

This is just some public stunt
Bill Gates and Warren Buffet are part of an old guard, that instead of embracing new ideas, stick to their long held faith in the stock market and Fiat.  His ignorance of the fact that Bitcoin is easily shorted in several venues by many rich people and market makers just shows their cursory and novice knowledge, typical of someone who fears change and of the unknown and only learns about that which they fear enough to conversationally bash it. Should Bitcoin go back to 20000 anytime soon? Is its volatility good or bad for it? Is the amount of the market that is made up of speculation healthy? These are good questions, but do not rate an intrinsic failure of the technology.
More like he would if he knew how / he would if he had the time. Don’t see the point in Bill Gates day trading when he practically has an infinite supply of money. 
Liquidated short on XBTUSD: Buy 7,000,000,000,000,000 @ 9400 🔥🔥🔥🔥 ~ GWP-like!
I thought the same thing when I heard him.
He'd have to buy BTC first to short there. 
I only hope Buffett stays alive long enough to see $100k Bitcoin.

Couldn't he just sell bitcoin futures on legitimate US futures market? Is there a reason why this wouldn't be essentially the same as shorting? 
That’s a pretty decent buy signal imo 
He is right, but with that many idiots on the planet you never know if your short gets liquidated...
That's because we use those just for buying. We trade in the US exchanges like Bitfinex. 
There's some appeals against the crypto ban that are now being heard, so we'll have to see what the outcome of that'll be.

> move bellow

that would blow
So he specifically says in this video that humans have an overwhelming tendency to adopt a view and narrow our focus and attention to things that support that very thing, at the exclusion of all else. Everyone is saying that's what WB/CM are doing with all their vitriol against BTC: they don't understand BTC so it's easier for them to just stick to their traditional worldview. Their traditional markets. But no one seems to mention why they think this way. Have they actually given a coherent reason why they think BTC is rat poison, and does the reason actually have merit? You'd expect that from such rational people.

The alternative then is that they are blatantly violating their own principles? Either way I wish they would explain better why they think this way. Or perhaps the media is just taking snippets of what they're saying and blowing them up. I mean is there a chance that they do have a valid reason as to why BTC is shit? Maybe we are wrong? Either that or they are wrong and given their track record of being so rational, would eventually come to admit they are wrong.
failed so far, but we get more tries...
I would spend most on BTC, a bit on LTC and a bit on XMR. Then I'd take some of that XMR and buy some drugs and get high to either better enjoy the gainz or escape from the losses. 
This makes no sense but I would choose bitcoin.
30/30/30 into big cap coins ETH, BTC and NEO. Then 10% in to high risk projects like EOS, ADA or ICON that all have networks coming up.

But to even call crypto "investment" is a bit over the top , a speculative bet is a better word
Post is a little old but it's still very much reflective of how I feel.

TL;DR: all BTC.

https://theoryofself.com/why-i-am-still-a-bitcoin-maximalist-2fb98d33ed21
I would buy one BTC and use the rest as funding to pay for margin to enter into a low leverage long. Three years from now, surprise, you hold a 4000% profit long!

In all seriousness, personally, I would use it all for BTC.
Not popular here but I would go all in on XRP.
It seems nobody recommended Bitcoin Cash? I'm a nuub; wondering if this is because of the controversy between BTC and Bcash, or is it more something deeper with Bcash" as a project that indicates a bad investment choice? 
I wouldn't buy any crypto if I had to keep it for three years, because governments are likely going to force the price down by aggressive regulation.  That has already been the case (of course).

But if you absolutely had to buy, I suppose would split the funds between BTC and ETH.  LTC really doesn't have much going for it except speculation and a big fanbase.
They are more of the status quo more than anyone else.  It's no surprise they are bashing cryptocurrency.  It is good for them and their friends.
 A bunch of pretentious old men playing at running the world. But the world left them behind long ago. We are the future. 
What did I miss?
I'm also long around the same price as you. Will probably short this soon though.
[And we're off!](https://www.tradingview.com/x/EivSNRGb/)
Yes it does seem so.

I unfortunately took it as too much as a line in the sand on May 1st though and got chopped up on that dip by panic closing/reopening/getting stopped out/reopening (which still payed off in the end actually, but with an initial handicap to the profits)

Just saying that I think it can be useful in terms of maintaining a bullish sentiment if we are above it, but for specific trades not to trust it for setting stops.  And being below it doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad place to long.  It's already been violated quite a bit.

Edit: actually this price action feels a lot like may first.
I want to go short too but this last daily candle might get a little bit of oomph before the BB's finally choke this turd down the toilet.  Also literally no funding on shorts.  I'll be shorting around 9500.



Any targets?
can you please explain how to tell there is no buy pressure and that it wasn't accumulation? 
Did you use the June or September futures for your short.   And could you explain your choice?

Ok, let's go back to wildly speculating about Goldman Sachs and NASDAQ.
Welcome to Reddit 
There is something on the SEC website about an event on the 11th.  Perhaps the date was misreported.  But the event on the SEC website looks like just a casual discussion rather than a decision making meeting.
Yep \- I searched teh [senate.gov](https://senate.gov) site thoroughly and didn't find anything scheduled.
Told you guys. 90&#37; crypto traders are living memes.
Bounced off hard at 9200 on finex...I like it

Use stops man.

There's no reason to not have at least a breakeven stop when the price was > $400 above your entry.
Hold open for long
300$ up and down are not fat gains/loses.

Just hold the position for a little longer.
elon's having a breakdown because his factory is fubar'd.  He berated analysts on a conference call a few days ago, which is almost unheard of on wall street.

He slept on the factory floor to try to fix the problems, which isnt what a CEO should be doing.  It's counter-productive.

He is brilliant though.

I'm concerned about the number of comments that only share their position. Can you implement a word count that's > 100 words and send a DM when users fail to do that (also, don't record the position)?
what pairs are accepted?
Can we post trades on BTC/ETH or LTC? Ist only usd as currency supported? Do i need to convert the eur prices to usd?

thanks for your work!
I'm pretty sure last time the SEC spoke the news was out 12-24 hours before.
Yeah not that many market sells, but the sell orders keep piling up. My guess is some big players are taking profit while trying to avoid a drop.
No one is worried about BTC right now. Ether is dragging the market right now purely on fundamentals / rumor basis

So gdax on your iPhone?
Ah yes, I too need to watch westworld until I fall asleep.
I'd not bail until 9k break to be honest, though this flag breakdown not making new lows is already promising. If we can hold for the next couple of hours I think we'll see a green day tomorrow. The fact that Euro pair hasn't really been making new lows, plus the positive movements on Eth lead me to think this shakeout is nearing its end. 

I'm only worried about the lack of shorts and overload on longs... 
I'm with you on this call. I was trying to stay our of this until we got through 10k, but these prices are too good.
They deal with BTC only. No bank accounts that could be frozen ;)
One aspect is surely regulatory. The moment you start operating in USD there is a new level of policing that comes into place
why do they call USD and not USDT in there charts? how can you can lock\-in Fiat funds on Bitmex without USD involved?
If you are newish to trading, I recommend being very conservative and only go for like 3-4% a trade.  Wait until everyone on the sub and discord channels are freaking out and set a target but at a weekly or monthly resistence point.  Don't fud if it's not going that low or if you don't get your price.  Just reset and wait for the next one.  When you do get your price on the dip, set a fair upward target where you see support over the past week or month and you'll make your conservative %.  Worse case with this strategy is if you get caught with the price going lower, you will usually see a bump high enough to break even, too.  Just my 2 cents.  I don't lose on trades.  I mostly hodl, but I have a percentage I trade with using this strategy and it works for me.
You're overtrading and trying to trade short term trends instead of longer term ones

don't open a position below $9.8k or above $9.2k unless you plan on adding to it later
Indeed, live and learn my friend! Don’t expect profits to come easy.

What has really helped me stay profitable is trying to identify “no trade zones”, ie areas where there’s lots of chop and price discovery. I’m trying my best to enter/exit below or above those big order blocks and just hold between them.
Interesting.  I was thinking even if ETH was classified a security they may get some form of unregistered exemption.  As for the ERC-20 tokens most could have trouble ahead.  I am seriously wondering if XRP will be considered a security.  Surely if it does this could be very good for BTC.  Interested to hear other thoughts on this matter.
Well written.

I hope you are right about the SEC situation, I basically have the same thoughts, so I keep my long positions open.

I’m still a little worried though, just because IF there’s an announcement that’s not in favor of crypto then I cant even imagine how fast and how low we might go. 
Good post.

What are your thoughts on ERC-20 tokens? I thought these seemed most likely to get tagged "securities"

But then again, this is just speculation.
but instead we all wait for the decisions of the whales that make the real moves
Any new idea or ‘revolution’ like this isn’t about taking power away from a group of people for the sake of everyone like in a happy hippie dream. 

It’s about taking conditions that do not favour you and turning them in your favour. 

There is a very big difference. 
Getting away from men making decisions about when and with whom I may transact. Price is still subject to market reactions
Such simple but beautiful idea didn’t even appear to be before you said it.

There's a very significant amount of selling pressure right now.

There's potentially an SEC meeting taking place right now.

Just because the two are occurring at the same time does not mean they are in any way related to one another.
Yes 
It's streaming live right now.
What if Bitcoin is rat poison squared simply because the rotten, corrupt banking establishment is full of, and ran by rats... :O
It's a good thing that Bitcoin doesn't function within the markets they dominate.

It's a bit like using Stephen Hawking as your primary source on AI.
Gates and Buffet are self made men and can absolutely say whatever they want, they have earned their opinions a thousand fold. That said, it's just opinions that the media likes to overdramatize. I don't think either of them cares much about crypto, and I don't think anyone can really say at this point if they are right or wrong. It's just media getting your clicks and attention.

The Bill Gates bashing bitcoin thing really grinds my gears too, and I find it hugely ironic he's against such a huge innovation that has the *potential* to help millions or even billions of oppressed citizens of the world by providing *potential* access to better financial tools. His huge foundation raises ungodly sums of money to help struggling communities get some footing, and Gates completely bashing a huge opportunity like this instead of at least giving it a try is almost a crime to me.

It's so unbelievable, I almost think he knows something we don't, but that's just FUD. 

From an innovative cutting edge god to a myopic crusty stale dinosaur. Fucking shame.
[deleted]
Old people usually just don't like changes. And I don't think Buffet understands Bitcoin.
7500???
lol 7500..

your TA doesn't matter when the market sway right now is dependent on SEC's ruling. 
Im assuming GS doesnt announce a BTC desk w/o being well aware of the regulatory landscape and/or helping to create it.

Based on that Im fairly confident the regulation will not target btc directly.  I assume, based on previous rumblings from the SEC, that this will likely crush alts with a particular focus on scam coins.  That may hurt ETH just because so many have been built on it.  The real question is does ETH fall into the ruling or not - LTC? XRP?  the line they draw will either have to be very subjective and grey or they will hurt some of their own (remember big banks and companies are part of both ETH and XRP investments).

You think we’re gonna make a retest of $10k soon after the selling stops?
i just bought a bunch cause of the news. could be big idk
I don't think it was CME traders; it was the expectation that CME would affect BTC. 

I mean, seriously. The only guy I know of in this subreddit who trades on CME futures is /u/btcqq who is a huge fuckin troll (a funny one). And I'm fairly sure he just trades like the rest of us. futures traders aren't all knowing gods who planned on destroying bitcoin, they are just futures traders.

these bubble bursts happen when people's ridiculous expectations begin to slowly dissolve into reality. $20k was a natural slowdown point. The mania to get there was *incredible*. The natural progression after a blow off top is for people to slowly step back and say "wow, what the fuck is going on" and get out. CME futures provided a great scapegoat for the end of the run despite likely having no real direct effect 

People thought CME would short it because they knew that shit was getting absolutely ridiculous deep down. It was a wake up call but didn't *actually* do anything 
Of course most people in here didn't think it would hurt the market price.  They don't think anything will hurt it.  China and India taking 3 billion people out of the market is "Good for Bitcoin" so of course CME Futures is as well.
i think it is just a coincidence. cme volume and open interest is a joke.
What ended the bull run was that I put in sell orders stair stepping its way up to 25k
Y tho
Bitstamp and Bitfinex have been more in sync now too, when were $80 or more apart the last couple of days.
Spam transactions have fallen off a cliff. Might want to add median transaction value as a factor.
To me it screams that traders are finally agreeing upon the possibility that the medium-term-bear-trend has reversed. 

It's certainly higher than it's been in months, but it's not outrageously high if the market truly is consolidating prior to a move up to challenge — and ultimately overcome — $11,700. If anything it's still lower than it should be (particularly on the September contracts).

The only counter argument you can make is one based on what bitcoin *could be*. 

If you're going to debate his stance based on *what bitcoin is* currently, then you're showing up with a knife to a gun fight.
Gates' view on crypto is very narrow. He did an AMA which contained a question about it here: https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/80ow6w/im_bill_gates_cochair_of_the_bill_melinda_gates/dux2mp7/

saying things like:
> Right now crypto currencies are used for buying fentanyl and other drugs so it is a rare technology that has caused deaths in a fairly direct way
This is how I have gotten a few economically inclined folks to think about it. Fractional reserve banking, quantitative easing and large debtor nation status is not sustainable for the US. 

Bitcoin is a different form of money, like the gold backing of the dollar to limit the above problems. However, Bitcoin is the internet version of gold and would it surprise you (my friend) at all in the future that instead of having nations spend money in a non-sustainable fashion, we have a global currency (or currencies, pegged to a responsibly managed global currency) to prevent a global collapse from irresponsible banks? We can all participate in communities and determine different methods of taxation, based on our own preferences, sounds good to me.

If I don't get through to them, I make them listen to this podcast:
https://www.theinvestorspodcast.com/tag/quantitative-easing/ or any of the CryptoVoices podcasts on the subject. 

But yes, we are several years away from the tech on this, I am thinking about my kids lives in the US for the next 75 years.

His reasoning is that it produces nothing of value. And while that's obviously right in that it produces nothing tangible, there is certainly inherent value in *information* (using technical jargon) which it *does* produce. For instance, when secure and immutable (particularly when decentralized), the information the statement "Jimmy gives Bobby X Amount of Bitcoin" provides CAN have actual value. 

Other cryptos seek to produce the same type of secure/immutable/decentralized information for conveying a message more complex than a simple transfer of value, though the simple case is in all likelihood the case with the most utility.
hypothetically, as someone without access to any investment vehicles beyond a bank account, can you show me an easier way than buying BTC for me to reduce my exposure to the risk of my country's currency inflating?

edit: also, I love your question, will hopefully spur a good debate
I do not think BTC is just waiting for a greater fool bc of the inflation arguments mentioned here already and because I believe BTC will be one day the reserve currency of the world.

However there are a lot of investments that fall into greater fool category: it is the gold, silver and gems, art& stamp collections, pension systems, TSLA& many current startups. They work well even long term.
If it's a "pure" greater fool type of investment, then it has no practical utility and we already know that is not the case.  And you can't convince a skeptic that 2+2=4 in many cases, so don't even waste your time.
I don't know if I can convince you of Bitcoin specifically but I do think some of the technologies it has spawned have real potential.

The lightning network when further developed looks like it could enable true, decentralised, micropayments on BTC and with regards to Bitcoin it's the potential future in combination with pre-existent brand recognition if it can regain any goodwill lost from merchants.

Me personally the most interesting development from its codebase are the projects that have spun out of it. 

Ethereum being an obvious evolutionary step but one most people aren't aware of is Particl which is using the BTC codebase to build a privacy centric platform with integrated DEX, marketplace, governance system and encrypted communications facilitating privacy through a mix of RingCT, trustless 2-party escrow, TOR integration, atomic swaps and various other features. 

It is designed to integrate currency with service delivery and eliminate reliance on third party services.

The appropriate summary tweet is here:

- https://twitter.com/thegreatestdoc/status/992647658023079936?s=19

In short; I'm basically saying that the brand that is BTC is somewhat irrelevant if you are aware of the broader playing field. That said these privacy platforms (with DEX integration, Marketplace, strong privacy and atomic swaps) are synergistic and will likely facilitate the survival and even growth of many cryptocurrencies that would probably die out.
The article acknowledges that Gates sees value in the underlying blockchain tech - this is where I believe the best counter argument lies. 

It's much easier to see the value of distributed ledger than it is to see the value of BTC itself. But currently, perhaps because of the nature of exchanges and BTC brand recognition, the price of those alts is tied to the BTC price. Seems like most BTC fans see the cause and effect beginning with BTC's value, but it perhaps strengthens this argument to frame it the other way around.

I'll admit that I can't figure out why exactly most alts (with a few exceptions) rise and fall together with BTC. If it's true that most alts are bought and sold in BTC pairs, why don't we see more diversity of changes in value from day to day?
Bitcoin is not a greater fool theory, it's a very fast and cheap system to transfer value across the globe.   You can send $100m from continent to continent in under 30 minutes, paying only $1 in fees.   That is intrinsically useful.  
Waiting for the <$5000 dip.


No, Bitmex has also had a premium. It's because USD funding has been really expensive lately.

It could be, but the big tell will be tonight. If there's a big dump it means this latest dumper has a big supply of coins, in which case it would be smart to short. We're still heading to a new ATH this year though. 100 percent. Bitcoin is proving how tough he is this year, and that's good for Bitcoin.

I'm hoping for a big dump tonight. It's like dumb money giving itself to smarter owners.
yes, this!
No. 
Yes. But don’t want to go through the entire schtick. TL;DR bubbles gonna bubble (bubble cycle), gains we’re ridiculous/unsustainable, no actual adoption/utility rn
fair value is probably around 2500, but usually bubbles pop and overshoot to the downside, will be some good values then.

r/r on a long here is decent. We moved down quite sharply, and most shorter timeframes look like there should be at least some temporary relief. That said, longs still heavily outnumber shorts and it's not like short term oversold HAS to bounce up; keep an eye on where things go or set tight stops if you do go long here, and be ready to reduce leverage / take profits early if we do bounce a bit. 
If 9.2 breaks, 9k isn't too far away. If 9 breaks, then it's likely there will be more selling to 8.8(ish). 8.6 isn't far from that and if that breaks, then most will probably dump and go short.
That’s me giving my profits back. Hi guys!
Taking a position here, if that trendline fails I'll bail and switch sides.

!long XBTUSD 9346 5X 30% -sl 9150
Yes, I did, and what it says to me is, "Big bears are getting desperate." !long 9300 
The price went down!?! Alert the press!
It was a very slow bleed after that with several weeks of hanging between big drops.  If it declines at the same rate as it did in 2014 it would take until october to get back to 6k again.
Makes me think we still have a long way to fall
Thought: the 2016-2017 rally is more like a long drawn out late 2012 early 2013 rally. This correction is akin to the following correction and, like the sharp bubble that follows, we'll again have a huge rally (also stretched out quite a bit) before a true crash and multi year bear market.

\#hopium

(Obviously don't take any of what I just said as something I actually believe, I actually think *any* comparison to 2014 or before is pretty damn speculative at this point)
Ok. so you trade on BEAR Posts?
So I'm not disagreeing with you (not entirely, anyway), but let's not forget that majority of exchanges aren't based in the US, and majority of their customers aren't American. There are certainly risks with keeping your coins on an exchange, but there's no way in hell SEC can 'freeze' the assets of, say, Binance or something. 
>It has been a while since a major exchange incident

Theres been bitgrail (170M) and coincheck (530M) recently, both of which are in the same order of mt gox (470M).

Ofcourse the proportional value to marketcap was much higher back then, but these are quite major exchange fiascos
> State the need for comprehensive securities reform to reflect new and changing asset classes.

Which is what exactly? These ICOs should be as regulated as any other security. Why should they be treated differently?
Before Mt. Gox, prevailing wisdom was to keep your coins off exchange. Everyone who lost coins there had heard that they needed to store their own coins on their own wallet.

Shit why did I land on Facebook?

And I started opening a new position because I'm betting on this being a local bottom for now.  Have some limits to add to it which have so far been just barely missed.  Will hopefully quadruple the size of this position in the current trading range.  If we go up one level of support I'll add a little more, and then start taking profits a breakout after that.
Position saved with success.

bearish imo, a break down from here would have so many long term bearish implications 
It's kind of cherry picking though if you ask me. Masterluc's channels, for example, show a slightly different (and in my opinion more applicable) scenario where we bounced off channel support.

Tap the "play" button to get it to update.

And yes I know he's provided a somewhat bearish update since this chart.
I'm not much into TA, but if I read this correctly, it's a rising wedge and if it breaks down we can expect the price to drop by at least $1,200 from the breakout price (height of wedge measured at base). In which case, we're looking at $8,100 or below.
so target is what, about 8.8?
Or you could be at the approx 5 month point like me and be fucked
That’s true but losing ~~80%~~70% of profits at one point isn’t exactly something to be proud about even if it turned out ok. 

If you are a smart buyer you need to be a smart seller too. 

There’s really little excuse not to have sold at 17k after we failed to make a higher high after the first correction. 

(I myself haven’t but I won’t make that mistake again, even though I’m still sitting on a very nice profit from my initial buys it was stupid not to take some profits there). 
How is this relevant to a trading sub? Who knew what the price would be 6 months into the future?
you can always cherry pick 2 points on a chart and make a statement like this or the opposite.

>is in profit

is in paper profit, that is a difference.

It works both ways with Beartards calling for $3k 
matter of time....and we will be at 10K.
We are in the middle of a bear flag,  9320 in this very moment. Failed four times to break the top of this flag, broke the major ascending wedge (although i think this is quite week) and are overing the more important low bnoundary of the major wedge that formed following mid-april short squeeze. We are in the 5th green week in a row from mid april with 20 SMA curving over us. MACD is turning red, upward momentum is gone. RSI on the daily is pretty neutral.

Everything can happen off course, but the fact we didn't see a BGD at 07:00 GMT today makes me thinking we are going to restest strong supports, not resistances, in the coming days/hours.
stop tickling my bear asshole man
(A) Damn straight way too early to draw. You can consider what you want to do if it *does* confirm but it's not something to consider for current trades.

(B) Not even especially valid - the handle is over half the cup now, which usually invalidates a forming C&H.
Lol, hyperwave theory. Easily as retrodictive and useless as Elliot Waves or any other *post hoc ergo propter hoc* TA.

edit: downvoted? Really? Do people even understand what hyperwave is?
While you keep an eye on that, I'm keeping my eye on a possible inverse H&S (also too early to draw, but I've sketched it in anyway).

yes 9200 is good support but be patient and you might get a lower price than now \(317\) for the bounce up from 9200 imo. You might get filled in the  low 200s
One leaked SEC memo then sure.
Of course it just taps my stop before bouncing back up. Fuck me.

This is right in line with my thinking and while I didn't think it would hit so soon, it did nonetheless.

!long xbtusd 9180 1x $500k
Well, there's bullish divergence present on the 1h, which would likely compound with another drop rather than resolving. (unless of course the drop was particularly severe). 

So my personal bias is that it's different this time and we'll see a breakout to the upside above $9,400 before we see a breakdown to the downside below $9,200. 
I don’t get the selling. The SEC meeting was apparently bogus so that’s good news, right?  
Right? Totally irrational. Take advantage.

Edit: if this dummy gets it down $200 tonight, I'll assume they have a substantial amount of coins and will short from 9100 to 8800. If I wake up tomorrow to 9200 or higher, I'm going long.
You are right... shaking the trees here and then next Up level in next days.

I'm not sure, I'm looking primarily at ETH right now and it seems to be making a higher low. I think BTC is now in shakeout mode and will grind out of the channel later today. not buying the dip though. 
there's still those 20k permashorts out there lol

People here don't like to see comparisons with 2014 but i second your analysis. Having my eyes on that support as well even if i think horizontal *e: ~~resistances~~ supports *e will let us bounce a lot shall we broke down.
> Bonus pic

Food for thought.

Edit: If this turns out to be more or less a seasonal cycle, that's great. What could be better than predictability?
That is interesting. On linear scale we broke this line already....
They run out of margin pretty often when the market's doing well. This isn't new for the platform. Just be happy it's functional this time around.
I intend to close my long at 9900 and wait for the carnage. It could go further up but I think there's risk holding to see if we go past and through 10k.
What downtrend line?
TBH, i think this is already priced in. If no changes then also no changes to current market movements. If some significant change then expect some harder drop.
New exchanges have taken to the scene and GDAX doesn't offer many pairings at all... I think the people have just shifted away from GDAX because they want to bet on alts too.
I think of GDAX volume as an indication of interest from average Joe investors. That, along with google trends, tells me that interest is too low.
Sure, unless much bigger whales are doing the opposite against you.
or you can massive short futures that you break them and break the price then buy all these longs that get margin called below market price. happened on okex but the trades were reversed.
Maybe there could be such games a year or longer ago. Now it's filled with pro algos that don't give a shit and just grind out money from noobs(amateurs, like us). No need to overthink it
you'd just buy OTC...

Also...why now? 
I think it's important to consider the context as well.  A lot of the people who are currently interested and invested in Bitcoin are not traditional wealthy folks.  Sure, some are.  But the majority who have gotten into this market, got into it because it was something exciting and different from our traditional system which feels like it's already conquered.  The rich get richer, and unless you have connections to the wealthy, or you manage to create something massive that catches on (musicians, artists, entrepreneurs, etc) then you don't really stand a chance at mega-riches and financial freedom.  You will work a 9-5 until you retire at 65, and then survive off whatever you managed to scrounge together to save.

Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies represent a potential redistribution of wealth, a potential new way for folks who missed out on the oil and gold rushes to accumulate wealth and gain that financial freedom.  The already mega-rich have no interest in this side of the currencies because they already have that in the current system, and would actually be incentivized to prevent this from happening.  If the USD is devalued to BTC or other cryptos, that's a threat to the fortunes and empires these people have built.  To them, it's more risk than it is potential, because the current system is already benefiting them just fine.  To the rest of us, to the masses who are having their hearts and minds captured by this new potential in our lifetimes, we shouldn't give a shit what the mega-rich think about this.  That's like asking the NRA what they think about gun reform, or what oil companies think about renewable energies and climate change.
Bitcoin is being astrotraded these days. So unless you are privy to that sort of info, all wild swings in crypto will be “bart” or completely unpredictable. Get to know a the banker’s astrologist and become a billionaire.
So are you a gambler or a trader?
I think I'd long it, not short it.

Every time I think about how an ideal currency system would work, I end up reaffirming my faith in bitcoin and getting angry all over again at how USD fucks savers.
to successfully short you need to dispel the thoughts of 100k per btc and ground yourself more in reality. Not saying it WON'T happen, but if you don't, you'll forever be underwater in your margins
lol trying to crowdsource justification for your position. if you want to short it, short it.
Part of the reason these guys are rich is they don't short bubbles/ponzi-schemes
>Can someone explain why my 5% profits on my long were less than my 1% loss on a short play? I put the same amount at risk at the same leverage.

>For the 1% short loss

Looks like 10x margin orders? I would check your order history for swap funding rates, that's likely the culprit. 

Side note: Which timeframes are you trading on? Closing a position after a 0.1% movement seems a bit odd for those not churning maker rebates. 
Maybe.  can you look at your transaction history and tell me what the open and close were for each of these trades.  


What exchange, what instrument (XBTUSD/swaps on bitmex?) and how long was the position open for? 

Need position size and entry and exit for both positions
you probably paid a lot in funding. Also shorts profit more due to the inverse contract.

Be patient. Kraken sometimes need a little time to add it to your account. 
Solved, took +-5 hours.
it is not expected to announce anything today. at least there is no source for that. more down you find a source which actually says, that it can take month or even a year for a decision.
THis is a meme with no fact based support at all. There is no source to this rumor. There is nothing at all to suggest a critical ruling will happen this morning. This meme was completely fabricated over the weekend.
[removed]
Well, right now it's just a 2.5% bounce off the local low. So it's pretty much a nothing event so far, regardless of which way the market continues in the short term.
> Am I alone on this?

Yes.
looked like a bear trap/shakeout to me, but I'm long lol
You mean the wick bounce?  That's not significant enough to call bull trap, it needs to be a sustained bounce first, like if we are looking to make a lower local high.  

We are still primarily in the context of a bear trap on our drop from 10k region.
I understand the technology may be hard for you to understand, but it is certainly not a turd. 
Make all preparations for surfacing!
!short XBTUSD 9350 1x 33&#37;
While it shouldn't necessarily be the case, if ETH gets rekt, BTC is going to also, at least in the short term. 
It’s closed doors.
i dont think there will be a meeting , just an announcement tho i cant find anything about it at all on their site.

Different exchanges have different order books, hence, different prices... see: arbitrage
Someone is about to get an education in the fundamental problem that a blockchain solves.

Look up "Byzantine General's Problem"

Then think about how hard it is to sync information that exists in completely different places.

Then try to think about how Automated Clearing House works in the United States.

Then think about what Bitcoin is and what it solves.

Then think about your question in terms of requests to distinct APIs.
No one is going to dump X coin and rush to buy BTC with their funds, no matter the outcome. Best case scenario is everyone overreacted to semi-manufactured FUD and entire market rebounds somewhat once the results are in, most likely effect this is mostly an expected technical correction and FUD was just used to play shorts on Ether and there won't be much of an impact after whatever announcements either way, worst case the news will be bad and the market (BTC included) will dump further.  

Whichever scenario is more likely, who knows -- but given the ever-increasing talk about institutional involvement, big players like GS and whatnot planning to open their crypto trading desks (or fucking Nasdaq, y'know), I'd say majorly negative announcements aren't that likely. 
Not sure if I understand all of it, but this would only affect US based exchanges right? A lot of exchanges are abroad anyway? I expect the news to be already priced in by the big players, and I'm not seeing an apocalyptic drop that you'd expect with such important news.
Head and shoulders on the 1sec chart
And the market just invalidated it on the 1m.

Don't put too much faith in the 1m. Tis a silly place. 
Thank you time traveler.
Ah, the 15 minute candle TA. AKA Ol' Reliable.
check out the rounded top on the 1W
Almost the same on Bitstamp. Simple TA here: hard resistance at 9.4K (50% Fibo retracement of 8.8K-9.9K upswing). Watching the order book one whale is buying and one is keeping the ask side almost the same level, filling up quickly. Definitely it is not small players based on the trades's volume. The question is how much inventory should be cleared of the seller and how much money building a long position.
This is a bear pennant pattern. Lots of sites to google more about it but here's one explanation: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pennant.asp
I don't think so, they will just jump to the next coin. No reason for this kind of behaviour to stop until BTC gets some really incredible news. Until then theres no reason to long btc when you get 3x more gains from alts.
Properly completed A&E double tops fail to confirm ~65% of the time. Seems silly speculating as to whether it is an A&E double top or not before it even reaches the confirmation line, when it is such an unreliable pattern in general, all other considerations aside. 
Yeah, you might wanna take a reversal into consideration...

he needs to buys 1MBTC to be able to have an impact. but doing so will propel BTC to $100k+, and savvy investors will milk him to oblivion
Man who hates open source software expresses hate for open source project.

In other news water is wet.
he says this right after GS announces their margin-enabled (shorting) trading desk and is plying the SEC chairman (former goldman lawyer) in a closed door meeting today.

HRRMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM.

He isn't going to put every penny he has into shorting Bitcoin. That's absurd and completely contrary to his stated goals. He wants to use his wealth to save lives, not troll after an alternative system for storing wealth. He probably said this flippantly and didn't think he'd ever hear about it again.
Fuck bill gates.  He sucks and his windows os sucks too. I have never had more frustration in my life than dealing with windows update bugs. Anyway if he shorts bitcoin it will eventually bounce back.  Bitcoin cannot be stopped long term. 
>As an asset class, you're not producing anything and so you shouldn't expect it to go up.

This is where I fundamentally disagree. Yes, BTC and other cryptos aren't producing anything tangible. However, crypto *is* producing *information* - a statement of "Jim gives Bob X Bitcoin" can be quite valuable when it's provably secure and immutable. 

Universities today are sprouting up "Schools of Information" as an entirely new component. Computer Science majors have entire specializations devoted to information theory. Yes, it's a new field, but the concept of information having value is pretty understandable.
By your logic, Goldman Sachs, the largest investment bank in the world with more money than any single person, opening a Bitcoin trading desk should make Bitcoin the value of $1B.

Also, there are already many ways to short Bitcoin. Like Warren Buffet, until either put up money on the table, it's them talking out of their respective asses.

I thought this was going to be private. Am I getting wires crossed?
The most probable thing from these hearings is that nothing happens. Therefore we'll have a relief rally.
This is a guy who is prepared to be underwater for a while. He thinks that the regulatory news have been mostly priced in and that there should be a bounce soon based on other factors. 
The other factors must have a higher weighting in his books than the possible negative outcome of the meeting, hence going short here would be gambling, going long is logical. 


*probably*
Uncertainty is more harmful to the market than bad news. If the SEC news comes out negative, then its generally already priced in and price can still bounce. Uncertainty tends to wreck havok on the market more so than just flat out bad news. 
as = when
News doesn't matter much in a bubble. Can you explain to me why we went from $3k to $20k, fundamentally? 

Most of the run up was a low liquidity melt up hype fest. It was just pure mania. $13k to $19k in one day. 

I surely didn't invest due to any fundamentals - I bought because the price was exploding and I wanted in before it got too high. 

I don't know if you remember but in January when we dumped we all were so desperate for LN to come out to save the correction and keep the bull run going. 

When LN finally came out months late it was a complete non event. Price even dropped a little bit. But  like...2%.

LN has basically been the big trick up bitcoins sleeve for a long time and it didn't do *anything*. 

look at alts and how much they're valued and you'll realize the entire space is entirely hype driven- almost none of it is grounded in reality. 

This is not to say the bubble can't continue- I just know it's very possible a bull market will ignore or quickly swallow bad news and a bear market will almost completely ignore good news. 
Post gox 2014 was exploding with inspiring developments. Didnae help one bit. The price will do what it's gonna do.

No way.  That would get shot down in court so damn fast that it would make your head spin, but it wouldn't even get that far.  No politician would support a law like that because their political career would be over in the next election cycle.  Plus, they all have Bitcoin at this point.

Lots of extremely smart and successful people have made incredibly bad predictions throughout time. I would not listen to an 80 year old about Bitcoin. I think Warren is the best at what he does but he does not invest in tech companies so what would you expect him to say?
Buffet gave a speech in '98 where he said he'd flunk any student that even attempted to give a valuation on an internet business.
In the late 90s, I traded stocks and you could margin daytrade with $2000 in your acct.  Because there were too many individual daytraders, they changed that to $25,000 and price most of them out of being able to particpate in the market.

That is the USA for you.
The policy is overrated. As far as I know it is US policy. Many, if not most, countries do not restrict citizens that much and they are still not being millionaires from investing.

What I saw in my country of origin, were people who were just randomly picking some hot picks for US stocks and they never made it anywhere. Well right now they are buying alts on credit.
Those rules aren't in place to keep the rich richer and poor poorer. They're in place because in the realm of private ventures, you have to pay for and advocate for your own justice.

The government will advocate for people in criminal matters but it won't do it in civil matters. So if a company is refusing to uphold their contract with a shareholder, then the government says it's said shareholder's own job to represent himself/herself through the entire proceeding.

That's *incredibly* expensive. The cost just to file a lawsuit starts at $20,000. That's just to officially state (in court records) you're suing the other party. That's not even for discovery, trial prep, trial, witnesses, etc.

The cost for even a small matter is high five figures to low six figures.

Your average citizen doesn't have the kind of money to just file a lawsuit much less take it to court. And in the civil world, *nobody* works on contingency. Lawyers expect to be paid up front.

So those rules are actually very smart. They were actually created in the 70's when $1M was worth significantly more than it is today. There has actually been discussion in the past decade about raising those requirements.

"you've got"

Take that!
Well, normally I'm opening and closing positions multiple times each week. So my entries and exits serve as my "advice." 

But since I've been sitting on my long from $8,800 for so long, I've taken the relatively rare approach of offering advice/commentary independent of the position I'm holding.

tl;dr my position is boring, and I'm bored, so I'm speculating on what I "might do" if I wasn't being boring.
I appreciate it dude. I'll keep it mind. I need to log off and stop seeing replies. it's not making letting go any easier. but seriously, nobody is in harm, and I did not intend for it to be taken that way. I'm fine. I'll live. it might be for the best. I'm just now realizing how big a part my crypto obsession played in the grand scheme.
thank you man

It’s hard to know for sure. The only thing that can be said with any certainty is that the OP seemed to have drawn the short stick whenever it was that this ill-fated relationship’s power-dynamic was established..  

> I begged her to let me buy a jalapeno in 2012. I begged her for a s3 in 2014.

it was bcash's fault.. bcash destroys lives.  Bitcoin's all good.  

woah I didn't say I was gonna kill myself man, and not what I intended at all. I need to leave crypto.
I don't get that impression from his post..reads to me like he is done with crypto not life. I hope so at least

edit: he replied and clarified while I was writing this message
dude that's kinda fucked up
What the fuck are you talking about? What makes you a relationship expert? What does it matter that he has 3 kids? You sound off your rocker. 
I mean he had the right idea didn't he? he could be fucking filthy rich and this bitch know  not a god damn thing about it. I hope that's the case. I hope this dude is ok. I hope this dude realizes that his wife just didn't fucking get it and he did, and he was right, and his crypto 'addiction' was justified. like the early holders of Amazon and Microsoft  and goddam apple. if this dude had even a few coins held from mining in 2013-2016, he's already set for life, if not leap years ahead of where he would be. I just hope he sees that for himself and his kids. I wish he had disclosed that, but it's only my guess that she is stealing half his fucking dream here. I sincerely hope that is not the case. I hope op kept his stash to himself. but I know if it was me, I'd have told her. and she'd be entitled to half.
Sell the news event?
With the crash just a few months ago and tons of liquidity issues, I doubt it'll happen.
Sick burn, lol
lol he closed in profit
!long xbtusd close $9,300
I didn't think the market could possibly bounce again off of $9,250 again. 

I was wrong. 
Waking up and making a decision to close/enter a trade early hours of the morning because my alarms have gone off has ended up being some of the more disastrous trades I've made. I tend to do stupid things like leave a stop open from a previous trade(or even forget to put one on) or miss something totally obvious that isn't immediately on my chart. Best thing to do with sleep is set your stop/target and forget about it, if your trade is planned and your position sizing reasonable you should sleep fine. I once closed a long on my mobile but forgot to close the stop sell as I'm used to the web UI I woke up with a pretty big short 700 bucks in the red per btc. That wasn't fun.
it's almost as if daytrading is a ... stressful thing.  Strange.  I mean all those brokers jumping out of windows.. I thought they were just depressed!
I mean, it's possible there is some 'internal working session' but if it's not something they can / are willing to publicize at all, it's very bloody unlikely they're actually going to be announcing anything at the end of their 'session'. The timing of everyone suddenly starting to talk about 'SEC hearing' during the weekend was pretty convenient too you gotta admit. 
People posting vague comments on Reddit and other people interpreting them however they want and then taking them as facts and forwarding the comments to other threads.
For me, there were two sources. One was in the a high profile story WSJ focused on ETH on May 1st - written by Paul Vigna nonetheless - that referenced "one person familiar with the inquiry" and second was more critical at least to me; former head of the CFTC Gary Gensler speaking last week at an event where he said there was a strong case that ETH and XRP are non compliant securities. That was even sources in the Vigna story. 

Realize that it looks very weak as support, but I am personally watching these small pieces of what appear to be inconsequential data points very closely. 
My last 2 calls have been spot on, and I’m not sure why lol 
Feeling relatively optimistic, a lot of people are calling for $8800, but since our push up from $6800 bitcoin seems to be following patterns pretty religiously. 

$10.3 would be a decent place to close our Longs and open a short, then reevaluate after that 
See the top comment. They're both legit, IMO. Just being accommodating.

Lol it's not conspiratorial to think some of the richest people in the world whose wealth is held in traditional vehicles would be like fuck cryptos... It makes perfect sense.
yeah bill gates is a real tech dunce almost as dumb as stephen hawking.

It can be an epic technology and still worth shorting.

The internet was a tour de force but only a moron bought tech in late 2000.

More importantly, the technology can be good but it's open source so there's no protectable IP to invest in.
Bill also said that Bitcoin is bad because drug users use it to buy drugs. 

> The main feature of crypto currencies is their anonymity. I don't think this is a good thing. The Governments ability to find money laundering and tax evasion and terrorist funding is a good thing. Right now crypto currencies are used for buying fentanyl and other drugs so it is a rare technology that has caused deaths in a fairly direct way. I think the speculative wave around ICOs and crypto currencies is super risky for those who go long.

VC capital pouring in doesn't mean a whole lot.  It just means that people with money think they have a decent chance of making more money.  It doesn't mean they "believe in bitcoin".
I like all 3, and want to hear what they have to say.  Agree or not.
I know buffett hates gold, so of course he hates bitcoin.

Really, he doesn't, and Buffett is not an investor. What they both are is salesmen. Buffett sold shares of a glorified mutual fund, and Gates sold the worst OS in the world to big business. History won't be kind to either of them.
Yeah I saw you post this earlier and thinks it's viable..  we're also near the [low side of trend volatility](https://www.tradingview.com/x/rBcrDbzQ/) which makes for favorable risk/reward

Reading the short term rhythms, it feels like this wants to get above $9400 again
Actually a pennant ... you’re right ... sometimes I mix up the terms. Good catch. 
Yeah it's holding pretty well, but I'm thinking it might be another little bearflag. Think there's still some downwards room on the 4hr RSI and the div's on the 1h are not crystal clear. I'm keeping a close eye though because it might just be reaccumulation here. 
Its the position tracker one
I think it is ego.  If you follow his advice, you basically only buy SPY and are supposed to be happy with 5-10% gains per year, except during a recession.  If that is the kind of return you're getting, it is easy to be jealous of people making significantly more in crypto, and those people might be less inclined to follow his advice.
I do too.  Dishonest types would try to get in on the action.  He has little to gain making that call so emphatically.  I actually take his warning seriously.  I also went on a long rant on another poster characterizing him as an 'old man' who doesnt 'get tech'.   Buffett is not your stereotypical old man.



I think it's option C: He has zero clue how Bitcoin works or what it's value proposition is. 
It's funny how he compares it to rat poison.   Rat poison is a useful commodity.   Who are the rats in Buffett's metaphor?
I certainly believe in B, but it can be A as well. Many nocoiners, some of them relatively rich or successful, are with option A, aka I am trying to save the world.

They are in fact scared that bitcoin might work well as currency/investment vehicle/whatever, but it can destroy the world [as they know it] at the same time.

Bitcoin for WB is a disaster. He dedicated his life onto something and now shortly before his death the something is questioned. I believe he is a smart and intelligent guy and he will realize it at least in the last moments before his death. His general thoughts will be still valid.
Like I implied above, I think he truly believes it's too dangerous for 99% of investors, and nobody should touch it with a 10-foot pole. 

And to be honest, he is absolutely correct. 

There aren't a whole lot of financial advisors out there who would instruct their clients to invest in crypto. If they did, they'd get calls every 4 hours thanking them for their miraculous financial advice...followed by calls 4 hours later telling them to go fuck themselves. 
he invested in railroads I doubt he knows how a train engine works.  People on here would rather take stock tips from a train engineer than buffett.

Techies are biased.. towards tech.


>Here, he's absolutely correct that the vast majority of people don't understand what they're getting into and simply gambling because they wanna get "easy" money, quick. That's not how it ever works out and people just lose.

Big citation needed. I don't buy Buffet or any other technocrat's assertion that most people are incapable of managing their own money when given a fair chance. Many people have been mislead into poor financial habits but they will soon learn.

While I think you're right that very few people understand bitcoin on a deep level, understanding it at a basic level is not rocket science, depending on how many simplifications you are willing to accept.

Which platforms have this functionality?
no idea what uk is doing but may bank holiday was last week in europe ;-)
Don't go in the van if a 70 y/o guy dressed like a hobo screams "free candy"
I thought europe was pretty much always like that.  


Perfectly reasonable to be bearish right now. The market has now retraced 100% of the push up to $10,000.

Buyers disappeared. They may re-emerge suddenly and without warning, but for now they're nowhere to be found.
And that concerns me \(with my short\). I felt as the only one being bearish when we have been still above 9.5k and I felt good with that ;\)
A couple of reasons. 

First and foremost, $8,800 has served as ironclad support for a few weeks now, and it's pretty much the strongest possible long entry one could be holding at the moment. 

Second, the market has already dropped about 8% in the past 48 hours, and RSI is getting pretty close to oversold on medium timeframes. 

There were far better opportunities to close my long this weekend, and I missed all of them.

At this point, it's not really worth it to close it vs. hoping for a bounce and another attempt at $10,000. Better just to hold it until breakeven or close it after the next strong bounce.
I don't really factor bank holidays into my analysis. 

Even if you subscribe to the "mysterious they" outlook regarding market manipulation, you'd have to assume that "they" would be more than prepared for a bank holiday and would have made sure any bank transfers cleared last week.
Clearly nothing
I've had better — but I've also had far worse. 

I honestly don't care if the market spends a few weeks trading sideways in the $9,200 to $10,000 range. 

I'd just be a lot more comfortable if it were at least toward the middle of that range instead of mercilessly dropping toward the bottom ofthat range.
Oh I know, it's just funny (and says a lot) that no one called him out, like hey bill, there are multiple easy ways to do exactly what you're saying.
Quite funny how Bill Gates was the one shifting IT focus from hardware to software, and now when payments and information and messaging and so on are shifting from centralized to decentralized open software, he is the IBM of 2010
so do Gates and Buffet bash all other new ideas?  That would lend support to your theory.


 
True, but I'll bet there are a lot of things that he would do if he had the time, yet, he doesn't go on national TV and say he would bet against those things if there was an easy way to do it... 
7 Quadrillion?

There's not even 100 trillion of paper wealth on the planet...
And everyone thought the *$750 1m candle on BFX* was silly. 
or he could have used the BTC that someone gifted him (which he says he sold)
Why? the price means nothing- your idea that the price is what will prove people wrong is everything  wrong with bitcoin. It's proving his point. You should be hoping to see it *be used*. Not for the price to go higher 
Based on what he has said, I highly doubt he has even looked into what it would take (one call to his financial advisor) to short Bitcoin.
Hopefully he is too busy to figure out how to do it.  We don't need that kind of downwards pressure on the price, for sure.
> we

Where do I signup for this super elite group?
It's only 1.4 billion people who can't buy BTC.  That won't affect the price.
Agreed... in re-watching the video I just posted, I had to chuckle a bit as Munger (at least in the short CNBC video everyone is watching) seems to be betraying his own insights into logical/cognitive fallacies and biases when criticizing BTC.

Many on this thread are using appeal to authority to either agree with the trio.. or ad hominems to defend ("they're old AF!!").  Neither of these really help.

There are myriad and valid criticisms for crypto.. but we're not really discussing them... and the CNBC video doesn't plunge anywhere below the crusty surface. 
To be fair, crypto enthusiasts tend to take the same narrow view that crypto is the future. It's hard to take contrary views seriously, no matter how good those arguments are. 
This, but replace ltc with bch :^ )
why not? it’s an ecosystem question. Are you saying everything is so tied into bitcoin you might as well just buy al bitcoin or crypto as an investment makes no sense?
interesting. wouldn’t want to manage the investment however. I’m talking ‘here’s a ledger with yadayada I’m putting yr name on it and throwing it in a vault for a down payment on a home when yr older’ kind of thing. great idea though 
I’m more up on them than most due to knowing some folks that work there but the very fact there are folks that work there turns me off on the coin. would be like buying McDonald’s and Exxon stock. would rather not be involved in that

Ouch, got downvoted and lost one karma by asking the question:\-\(.  Anyways, thanks for all the replies and insights! Will do more research about it.
>I'm a nuub; wondering if this is because of the controversy between BTC and Bcash, or is it more something deeper with Bcash" as a project that indicates a bad investment choice? 

dear god... where to begin.

Bcash is worse than nano, iota if all you want is cheap payments without proven security, easy/decentralized p2p verification-- worse than Bitcoin in terms of legitimacy and security.

Literally the only group it appeals to are nontechnical users who are into crypto, have only heard of Bitcoin, but don't really understand Bitcoin or it's value proposition.

Ironically, bch is one of the only coins which fails if it succeeds: if it fails, it fails--no surprise. If it succeeds, pow consensus is broken, miners can manipulate and control the markets, and again, it fails.
> I wouldn't buy any crypto if I had to keep it for three years, because governments are likely going to force the price down by aggressive regulation. That has already been the case (of course).

The market yearns for sensible regulation, as is readily apparent in the comments here and from statements from famous folks. 

Also a split between BTC and ETH is a bad idea, imo. Weight that towards BTC and LTC, with maybe a ver small portion to ETH. ETH is highly centralized, is an unregulated security and so-far has demonstrated no real world use case beyond cryptokitties. It's mutable, censored and centrally controlled by Vitalik. Not a good long term play.
The future is now old man.
it's tough to be pretentious when you're the richest man in the world.  I guess the #2 guy could be pretentious towards the #1 guy.

Dammit, now I want to reinstall.

Cool.  Out of curiosity, why will you short soon?
good advice, I had deleted the line from my chart as like you said it was violated a lot. We often forget that support are not really line but bands. 

I agree that it looks like may first, slow accumulation.
Nope
Lack of strong bounces following each leg down is what did it for me. 

If buyers were interested in buying at these levels, the drop would have been choppier with large green wicks scattered here and there. 

If the trend were strong, buyers wouldn't be sitting on their hands just letting themselves get dumped on. They'd be buying the dips in a frenzy. Which they weren't — and still aren't.
June. Shorting September is dangerous, as the premium has a higher probability of diverging from spot and trading at a higher premium. 

June is less risky for a short. 
Happy it worked out for you!
Thanks mate! 
It's not just about Reddit tho , it was talked about everywhere in crypto space

I mean I hope TSLA does well, but with debt racking up and never getting close to their own targets it's no wonder that it's the most shorted stock.
I seriously don’t know why it happens? Maybe tons of limit orders coming or people trying to spam market orders? I don’t know but it happens sometimes with bitmex.

Coin flip at this point. 
Cheers dude. I dont generally post a lot of TA because it's hard to contribute something (new) and I'm still trying to develop my own trading system. I've done pretty well throughout the bear market but I also got caught out once or twice because I thought a trade was a winner so I doubled down with my winnings from a 10400 short down into the 6K got wrecked on the BGD lookingback the signs where clear bull divs and all. Now I'm trading longer term set ups with smaller positions and wider stops and just try and catch the majority of each direction. Then I buy and send maybe a 100 bucks into mex for a 10x leverage trade if I see a good opportunity on there for a trade in a different direction but keeping a large portion of your trading stack on there is a bad idea. It's hard to always be rational in a casino and the sure bet that's in your head is very tempting.
Humans like to see patterns in randomness.
EDIT: This didn't help really... sorry

Mixed signals TBH. I think it's time for a retracement there's odd bits of resistance above 10K that may cause issues without a cooling off first but it's nothing major. Buying pressure isn't particularly impressive (but neither has selling really). The problem is we have some very high volume nodes supporting us indicating that a lot of people bought and sold in that area if we drop though the levels and the people buying where short term traders or weak hands then they are likely to dump at least some of their position.

The other issue is that breaking below 88-8500 and not bouncing off the ATH>Bulltrap>Double top trendline would be pretty damn bearish and we would likely be looking at sub 6K. If we bounce there it could be extremely bullish especially if we then go above 10K (well as long as it's not in a straight line) - I believe it is around 7.2 ATM and dropping.

Wyckoff is a theory of trading against the masses because the market is rather illiquid so for those large institutions they are going to have to find moments where they can counter trade and buy into the panic to create liquidity with very decent odds (and example of this was when we spent a few days at 6.5k, it looked like it was going to collapse and out of nowhere we have a massive short squeeze and we are now likely seeing the distribution phase where those coins are unloaded). They may try do the cycle again but I think the higher TFs would need to be a lot more cooled off) but there is room for more up I guess.
 TL;DR   BTC is following the classic bubble pattern, except now it is not falling as quickly as it should because rich whales are manipulating the price, so it seems to go up, but really the overall trend is down.

Before you respond:  please construct a cogent argument, based on actual facts.  No TA, or cherry\-picked examples, I'll need actual facts, based on science, and not memes, or FOMO, or FUD.  no personal attacks needed here.     
Maybe not to 10K but that giant candle was a massive amountsof shorts closing the volume matches up pretty spot on. It was a logical place to bounce as well but having a lower close further away from out bottom was pretty bearish sign to me which is why I'm assuming it was a Wyckoff accumulation (perhaps someone with a large short to start that BGC followed by a sudden return to bullishness). Whens the last time we spent days pretty much at the bottom closing candles beneath the candle from 6K before exploding upwards like that. How can people call everything a conspiracy/manipulation but not see the potential for that. It's not even manipulation it was just a good trade. Market was over leveraged. and those who were short got punished.
Green candle the volume is added, red candle it's subtracted from a running total IIRC.

You're dealing with two competing priorities:

1. A desire to log the position as soon as it's taken

2. A desire to provide meaningful commentary to back up the position. 

I struggle with this myself even without the tool. When the market is moving rapidly, I hop in to update the community on my position and then I'll usually edit the position immediately after to rationalize it.

BTC can — and has — moved 5%+ in a matter of minutes. So sometimes it really is important to log your position asap and rationalize it later.
an option could be that we can add our trades directly on the website and dont have to type them here.
For now those low effort posts are being replied by PM (has to have a least 50 chars to be replied by comment).
I can implement stricter rules like the one you suggested without a problem. 
If users can PM the bot with their position (future update) there is no reason to create this kind of posts, so they would be PM'ed stating that they needed to send the command to the bot.

Please create a seperate position sticky thread. The post here are just annoying.
All pairs are allowed, the only issue is the PnL on open positions will be wrong. When you close the position the final PnL should be correct.
To use Alt pairs just to the the Altcoin thread and use the commands there.
You can have multiple open positions as long as the type/pair are different.
Not saying I'm worried, but being down about 7% since touching 10k I gotta say I'd like to take another charge at 5 digits again. Also - I believe /r/bitcoinmarkets *does* care about how BTC fares ;)
File a bug report.
OK. Fixed.
Watching it right now lol 
westworld lost something for me
Epic episode... so much potential. Can't wait!
good call, I think you're right about 9k break being a better stop
Perfect use case for BTC in itself that
You can't lock in fiat funds on Bitmex, unless you are in a short position.

They call it USD and not USDT because, well, why not -- there aren't any dollars nor tethers involved, either way. All the balances are in Bitcoin, USD is only there for display purposes. 
On the way up anything above 9.2 seemed reasonable for a long, which I opened and profited from, but on the way down it does indeed feel like a "no trade zone" as you say.
I think if ERC20 tokens and XRP are classified as securities it won't be good for crypto across the board, BTC included. A not insignificant amount of buys come from people wanting to get into these tokens, and BTC/ETH is generally the entry point.

I think the ICOs were a core driver behind the 2017 bubble actually. I don't think BTC or ETH would have gotten as high as they did last year without them.
Thanks, little write ups like that help to get all my thoughts together in one place.

I do believe that the whole SEC thing is a done deal either way and at this point it will just be an announcement of their decission.

I also think that the decission will be positive from the fundamental of ETH not being a security (utility- intended use is gas for ETH machine or some shit- need to look it up) but just the general positviy that SEC and CFTC have shown towards crypto.

To play devils advocate, we have just had like 5-6 weeks of green...
if ERC20 Tokens are to be tagged as securities, would that weaken the position of ETH in the market. Can a dump be expected? And if so would a dump on ETH make the btc price rise since people will "flee" in a safe coin? Or could this lead to a dump on the whole market?
Do you have any information if there is a specific time today when SEC will announce something? 
Cheers.

Im not too knowledgeable on ERC-20 tokens but i think it will depend on use case. Something like EOS which i believe (could be wrong) is literally just there to fund the EOS main net. id consider that a security.

Something like GNT or BNB have actual uses and are more likely to be utility tokens.

I also read something somewhere (gonna try digging it up) about Bittrex. its generally thought that since bittrex is a US exchange then anything on Bittrex is relatively safe.

watching some videos on the SEC/CFTC thing now just figure out a bit more whats actually going on. its kinda weird, theres hardly any decent info on the meeting/decission/whatever it is
Not if your developing for the network. I speculate too for fun but the tech is even more rewarding IMHO.

what do you think of the bounce we just had now?
Can you link it please?
It would be great if someone could write a play by play of any important takeaways.  I’m at work and can’t watch this right now. 
thats the old one..
He knows BTC is the future. He’s just salty because he knows he’ll be dead soon and will never see it. Fuck Warren Buffet and the whole rotten to the core banking system. 
[deleted]
You can be as self made as you want, this doesn't mean your opinion about the coffee market is worth anything if your money or success was made in car construction and so on
Warren Buffett's father was a very successful businessman and a four-term Congressman.  Buffett is an incredible investor but to call him 'self-made' is laughable.
Well, there's also a trust factor.  I think it's more than likely Buffet believes what he's saying, Gates on the other hand, who more than likely understands both how crypto works technically and the economics / incentives involved is the one who's opinion would be worth something, but I wouldn't trust anything the guy says.  He probably has a vested interest in holding it back, or may simply not fit his preferred world view.
Gates is not a self\-made man. He got his money by having the government enforce absurd IP laws to destroy his potential competitors. All he did was making and maintaining a mediocre OS. Which was impressive at the time, but not billions\-of\-dollars\-impressive. The government did 90&#37; of the work.
Bingo. Except at 10000 coins, you can't really dump that many on the market without significant slippage so they would dump over time or OTC it. 

We are all just remoras hanging on to the whales.
Was his last name Buffet by chance?
I find it a bit odd. The Gates Foundation donated a ton of money to Factom during their series A funding period. Factom is a protocol that is anchored to the Bitcoin blockchain (and soon ETH's too). So clearly they have some vision for the tech and believe it to be a potential success.
He got to be a billionaire by being a selfish prick.  That hasn't changed, and if crypto succeeds, it could hurt him (and his friends) some, so he is aggressively against it.
gates is obviously toeing some kind of line, read his AMA he's biased against bitcoin because of anonimity not from a tech/value/financial investment perspective.  I love gates and buffet but i hate when they all start talking in sync and propaganda and regurgitating sound bytes and blah I was wrong.


I've been researching it nonstop for about a year and I don't think *I* understand Bitcoin. God help anyone who tries to figure it out casually. 
Old people often yell at the clouds, the internet, ... and now at bitcoin. no surprise.
See the post linked below for why, its the .786 fib retracement line for a weekly tightening equilibrium pattern.  BTC didn't make the .236 and I don't expect it to, so quite possible it won't make the .786 for the higher low either.

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8hcsus/daily_discussion_sunday_may_06_2018/dyjfbs2/?context=0
maybe he talks about euro prices ;)
What ruling? Why did this notion of a critical ruling this morning spring up over the weekend out of nowhere?
I'm talking weekly time frame though, in two weeks I suspect the market will have forgotten all about the SEC announcement.  From what I've read there is no ruling today, just a discussion that there will be a ruling months from now.
People from the US forget that they are not the only one in the world. The rest of the world doesn't really care about this SEC ruling.
Well, at least TA is based on statistic/odds and is working since years.

This SEC matter is being quoted since some hours but every position you may take is just speculation, unless you have some proof that  "market is waiting for SEC's ruling". You may only be right in hindsight. 

My personal speculation is the SEC matter is still priced in, current correction was overdue and is purely technical.
Do not expect so much of a boost whatever it happens (unless negative), also because rest of the world does not care about it and most of the movement will be OTC.

Gotta stop thinking Bitcoin is somehow separate from the rest of the crypto market. A big reason for Bitcoin's price increases recently (in my opinion it's the main reason, but even if you disagree with that, you can't ignore this point entirely) is the overall increase of trading volume / attention on crypto markets. If the crypto market overall suffers, so will Bitcoin, there's no way around that. Any kind of negative regulations *will* impact Bitcoin negatively, even if they don't target Bitcoin specifically. 
I think it's still too early for regulatory bodies to swing baseball bats around. But it's coming.
also remember GS invested in Circle, who bought Poloniex
Most likely, I will be re-evaluating above 9500 if we get there and will react to what I see. Any wavering in bull faith above 9650 will see me close most likely.
What's news
cme futures was a let down it had crap volume and wasnt enough to change prices even with cash n carry arbs.. not even close
its one of the reasons i sold out. i know some traders there and they were definitely fans of the volatility.  There were other futures guys but they all disappeared too.  I think we were all let down.  Thats why i dont get excited hearing some new exchange is going to open in the US.. it doesn't mean much if no one uses it.  GDAX the only one worth trading on.

If i want to do a large position i use CME because A) no exchange risk B) 60/40 tax treatment  C) 25$ fee for 5 bitcoin contract.  But i dont enjoy it.






> China and India taking 3 billion people out of the market is "Good for Bitcoin"

Dats why, fam 
Sum of btc transferred might be a metric.
The premium is certainly not extreme or unsustainable. If we moonshot from here, the premium will only continue to go up. I don't think there is a bear trend of bull trend currently. The bull trend was broken Dec/Jan, the Bear trend was broken in Mid april. I think it's sideways and consolidation time, and I think that during that time, margin traders will be the fish. Right now those fish are majority long.

He got torn apart for that answer, and rightfully so. 

You know what else people use to buy drugs? Dollars. In FAR greater numbers.
what exactly is untrue about the statement " crypto currencies are used for buying fentanyl and other drugs so it is a  rare technology that has caused deaths in a fairly direct way"? 
problem is that the wealth will be extremly unequal if Bitcoin will really makes it. a few will have Billions or Trillions while the majority is left behind, that causes a lot of problems \+ taxation etc pp

you jut cannot neglect this, crypto has potential, but it is not good only becuase the existing system is shit \(corruption, debt, etc.\).
>the dream of bitcoin is beautiful, the reality is shite for 99&#37; of the people.  
This is a really good point. Value of Information is a real and important factor in decision analysis. It is also quantifiable. Network value has also been used to quantify the value of Ethereum. However, I do feel both theories need some modification for these use cases.
yeah, yeah, and robot wives CAN be wonderful, but right now it's just sticking your prick in a vaccum cleaner hose...

>So, jap cat, BTC  does not fall into greater fool category, but  gold, silver and gems, art& stamp collections, pension systems, TSLA & many current startups do, interesting position to take.  Seems very contradictory... 
I found it ironic that he said bitcoiners get angry when you question their investment when those 3 were obviously emotional and biased against bitcoin in their language.  This is clearly not just 'some ponzi', or no one would be talking about it.  No one at the SEC gave a crap that bernie was running a ponzi for 20 years.

that all depends on your definition of "practical utility," now doesn't it?  I do not trust coinbase to treat me fairly, and that is all I can use to get BTC legally, without paying a high premium...not too practically useful to me, then is it?

Sell me some btc for 2500 I'll buy it all up.
Where do you go to determine longs vs shorts? And if, in this example, there are way more longs than shorts, is there more pressure for the price to go down because those longs will get liquidated so market makers have more incentive to push the price down? Is there such a thing as a "long squeeze" that fuels a move downward like a short squeeze pushes the price upward?
6.8 is not too far from 8.6.

hm, for me that actually makes me even more wary of leaving stuff on their exchanges. I trust gdax over pretty much any other exchange 
Sure the US gov't can do something like that.  They went in and raided BTC-E and forced Bitfinex and BitMEX not to accept US customers, etc.  They can do whatever they want.

I added after we bounced back to the base line from that dip.  Normally I would have had knife catching limits there but I got distracted today after opening the position and wasn't going to be able to manage it.  Anyway that was safe, in that precipitous position I'd rather be there to see if I really want to add or not.  

Then I added a little more when we broke upwards.
Yup. This break is starting to look flabby. I have stops at $9250 ... a break below $9300 would suggest more ‘down’
Just imagine that just below $10K could be a local top that could last for weeks, or months...or forever.  Who would have thunk it.

\(in the december bull run every rising wedge broke up, so if we really reversed from the bear to a bull market this might happen again, so nothing is sure. It seems anyways more likly that we break down regarding the higher scale RSIs are still slightly overbought, but who knows. I wanna play it safe and closed part of my short therefore.\)
if this \(a bit ugly\) wedge playes out as a wedge I expect a target below 8.2k
Well at least you had fun....right?
What a difference one month makes. That December was on steroids. Now it’s so obvious such growth wasn’t sustainable. 
>here’s really little excuse not to have sold at 17k 

at 17k it was not sure that we failed to make a higher high. that only became clear with the next hard break down. 
I agree that in hindsight, $17K would have been a good place to sell.
buying and holding for six months is a long term trade
you can, but they aren't always this compelling ;)

what's a good example of an opposing statement?
I think you might want to read that again.
time to buy cause of that was $6k not $9.8k

B) not really , in crypto we had more cases of handles exceeding 50% of the cup and still making it. XRP, LTC ETH, all of those had this before. But its true... too early to trade on off course.

It's a way to say bubble without everyone freaking out and starting abusing people 'bitcoins not a bubble you F****** moron'. You know usually the people who bought the very top and expected instant 10x gains
I'll admit I don't.
oh boi, wasnt expecting to fap again this fast but you gotta do what you gotta do when you run across a good tit pic
This is exactly what I’m predicting is going to happen. We’ll see
dude, I have done so much backtesting of seemingly every strategy imaginable, and I have yet to find one where I benefited from a straight-up stop loss.  The best compromise that I've found so far is that when the price hits my stop, it requires some sort of short term reversal (like the 5 min RSI hitting 70) before selling.

Imo, we are still in a bear market. We will be in an uptrend when we start making higher highs and higher lows ( its the definition of an uptrend). We didnt make a higher low ever since that short squeeze. 
bags for sale.. bags for sale..

What if this bull trap was shaking the trees... In the other direction...
Eth is down a good chunk today, and hasn't shown a particular sign of rebound strength yet. It's a bit early to call a higher low.
imagine shorting from 20k and then closing at break-even...
Regarding your edit, I follow a guy named Brian Beamish who has 30+ years experience as a trader. He talks about how the market goes through seasons, too. I don't know why, but crypto loves April. Ive noticed The April-June window, crypto likes to change trends, also December/Jan.

He made this comparison to the [1980s gold bubble which I found interesting.](https://prnt.sc/jfhstm)

[Gold went on to make new lows before another big rally](https://prnt.sc/jfhu1o)

It's a good thing linear scale doesn't matter then
The one from 9950.
It's never priced in , that's not how this market works 
Alts market should be mooning now if that's the case.
Wouldn't you think that a new investor would not jump into alt's right away? Always considered GDAX and coinbase an "entry drug" to crypto markets.
Didn't the average joe investors caused the 20k bull run back in december?

So don't we need them for the 25-30-40k bull run? Impossible to reach 25-30k bull run without average joe investors?

Otherwise it will take years or a decade to reach 25k+ slowly right?
If you're determined to buy X amount of coins regardless, doesn't really matter what other whales are doing, does it? 
shouldn't that play to your advantage though?
Massive shorts are risky, though. If enough capital calls you out on your bullshit, you stand to lose a lot. 
Bitcoin and cryptos can redistribute substantial wealth only to much less people than is the amount of rich people now. If crypto succeeds, and I hope it will, the elite will be much narrower.

> you don't really stand a chance at mega-riches and financial freedom

That is not right. Everyone has a chance. I made 10M+ outside of crypto from zero without loans. I just spent 15 years of hard work. Most years 16 hours a day, no weekends, no free time, no friends, girls left. It is possible for anyone, since I must admit I have no extra talent. And btw I am far from feeling free, because more money => more work.

Certainly: anyone can do it to the top with effort, but not everyone at once. That is how world works. Crypto will make the "elite" just smaller and richer. 17M BTC from 21 is already redistributed. The hodlers are already rich, so they just hodl, since they do not need to sell. Only the 4M is waiting to be redistributed.

Those super-rich people are now the elite which always defines the reality. They feel it is slipping out of their hands. They will have a tough choice either go against it or with it. I believe most of them did not get senile so they will just go with it even when they do not like it. After all people get rich by listening to the market and trends, not by going against it. In the end they all die out and their money will end somewhere and will be invested. In crypto in the end as well.
100% agree! Thank you for this!
I never short more than a hedge, so not really gambling
who knows, just trying to play devil’s advocate.

I think valuations of Crypto have thoroughly left reality a long time ago. I remember dreaming of 3k BTC in late 2016
Which is exactly why I can’t short it for any meaningful time frame
Na, Ive been done shorting BTC since 8800

And I am currently out of a position.

Just saying there is rationale to short Bitcoin
Bitcoin is not a ponzi scheme
For the 5&#37; profits long:

Entry price: 9279.5

Closed at 9332.0

For the 1&#37; short loss

Entry price: 9278.5

Closed at 9293.5
ahh i see. 
Oh wow ok, bit of an anti climax then
Bitcoin is more like an ICBM on a turd sub.

No, it is not hard to understand.
!short XBTUSD 9350 1X 33&#37;
no, ETH follows BTC, not the other way around

Someone should go and periscope it :D
Cool, thanks for clarifying 
Ah ok, I heard 3pm GMT but not sure if that is the announcement or start time. Will have to just wait and see I guess 
I'm fairly well-versed in the topics you mentioned, but fail to see what any of that has to do with OP's (now deleted) question about differences in prices between markets.

As I see it, as long as Bitcoin is traded in more than one place (and that seems to be inevitable as long as more than a dozen people are active in the Bitcoin space) there will always be price discrepancies between all the different places Bitcoin is traded, be it a difference of $0.01 or $1,000....
Thanks for your thoughts. Obviously I did present a false dichotomy, I'm pretty neutral as far as this particular ruling is concerned, though I agree that the markets have overreacted somewhat and a modest rebound might be expected - ETH down almost 9% as I type this.
Hidden bullish divergence on the 1 picosecond chart
Lol well deserved 
Working so far.
I know! Rounded tops are bullish too.  The pointy ones like December are the ones you have to look out for.
So you think it's likely that repeating pattern indicates that this thing will drop?  I suspect it is bearish very short-term (like next few hours), no? 
Thanks!  Is coinbase a bit better now with transaction times and fees?  Vaguely recall something during the December time period
Online purchase maybe is what I mean with my bank card will that still apply?
Microsoft has a huge open source lab.

I think this is more about his loyalty to Warren Buffet.
Imagine the price spike after liquidating bill gates' short. Going to be so juicy. 
Someone who owns a million Monsanto shares is not there for saving lives.
That's probably exactly what happened. Still enough to hurt the feelings of a bunch of little girls in a subreddit, it seems :) "fuck gates for touching our precious!".. OK ok sorry I'll stop, BTC is important. 
I would go even further than that: The crypto asset class has produced tangible systems that offer utility the world has never seen before.

As demand for this utility increases, prices will go up. 

All these old school guys probably have very little idea about crypto


Let's not forget that Microsoft thought it could compete with Google via Bing. Microsoft and Bill Gates are not the final authority when it comes to trends in technology or finance.

> Bill Gates just said he will short bitcoin

Very tricky then, how they showed a blank slide prior to the top of the hour saying "coverage will begin at..." .... interesting
[deleted]
Is that actually TRUE that Sec is going to discus that matter today/this week? I don’t see many news outlets talking about, so I think we shouldn’t rule out the possibility that it’s all fud and nothing is actually happening at all.

I might be totally wrong and I’d be happy to be corrected.
if
This is literally part of the path to see an influx of the institutional money that people have been saying has never and will never enter the space. It's bullish AF
Hmmm for the run up from 3 to 20 you forgot a huge hype factor: 2017 was the year of free coins. We had 2 major fork and 1 laid down on a full drama story. Plus dozen of fake free coins fork and scam BS. Nevertheless, scam or not, shitcoin or not; lots of people went after those free coins (and they weren't wrong to be honest, seeing how much money you could make with BCH/BTG)

Not a single free coin big fork this year so far. Just wait for one to happen and you'll see how BTC rise again like stupid.

Of course that doesn't change that I agree with most of your post that it's hype-driven and not grounded to reality. But the main factor wasn't just "my nephew told me at thanks giving that I'll be millionaire so I trust him" - was more than that and to be honest; I liked it a lot. The atmosphere, the dramas etc. That was really fun even though it wasn't serious for this kind of market. Shame on me!
Bless your heart, you're one of the few that can pierce the veil of the oft-bullish echo chamber with some reason, without coming across as an angsty Buttcoiner and/or getting downvoted to hell. A rare skill.
Preach. As they (whales) say, never waste a news event. News events = drive for liquidity. If it's fud or news posted by whales themselves, you can be sure they're trading into (against) the news, ie where the greater liquidity is. 
I think news fuels additional movement in the medium term direction. Bullish news helps bull runs, bearish news helps bear tumbles. The opposite isn't necessarily true though. Sometimes it even has the opposite effect. For instance, China bans Bitcoin caused a serious pullback but that only turned into a good buying opportunity and a FOMO push upwards. News can't stop the bulls or bears, but it can certainly help either side gain traction.
> LN has basically been the big trick up bitcoins sleeve for a long time and it didn't do anything.

What exactly was it supposed to do in its six weeks of existence?  Patience.  It will replace Visa and Mastercard before you know it.  Why would any merchant want to pay those thieves?  The market will ultimately do the rational thing which will be to not throw away insane amounts of money to parasite middlemen when they are no longer needed; indeed, when they are *obstructing* wealth creation.  

Plenty of people poo-pooed paper money.  Didn't stop it.

Found the Scot! (I think?)
what in the post gox 2014 time is comparable to this?(The New York Times reporting that the New York Stock exchange is developing an exchange to allow institutional money to trade Bitcoin)
To protect us all from terrorism and also for "consumer" protection.
Nice collection. Always interesting to read these, and there are many, many more.
> "This 'telephone' has too many shortcomings to be seriously considered as a means of communication. The device is inherently of no value to us." - Western Union internal memo, 1876

The presiding tech of the time was the telegraph which had a lot of limitations which the telephone overcame. For example, the telephone allowed you to convey over 100x more information per unit time.

The only thing better crypto does compared to our traditional banking is that it's faster. The problem is nobody actually cares about "faster" these days because credit systems are already in place which allow for a similar operation in the same time frame.

> "How, sir, would you make a ship sail against the wind and currents by lighting a bonfire under her deck? I pray you, excuse me, I have not the time to listen to such nonsense.” — Napoleon Bonaparte, when told of Robert Fulton’s steamboat, 1800s

Napoleon didn't understand how you could change thermal energy into mechanical energy. He also didn't understand just how much more energy a block of wood (or coal) had compared to a light breeze. In other words, Napoleon didn't understand the modern physics of the time.
They changed that rule after the Dot Com bubble crashed the market and all those new daytraders ended up going bankrupt (literally).

It's the government protecting the masses from their own stupidity.
Actually almost all western countries have similar restrictions for investing in private companies. Not sure about Asian countries but I'd assume they're similar or moving in that direction.

Canada's laws are extremely similar to the US's.

Cheerful Ancap, at your service!
Since you’re bored and feel like speculating...

If the market weakly builds to 9900 again and then peters out and drops below 9200, confirming a double top, what would your move be? 

In that hypothetical, would you still hold till break even or would you close below 9200 and open a short?  
You should take 0.5x lev on other contract and leave your long open. That way you can still trade and not be bored ;-)
Hey man i dont want to assume things but you followed a passion and a dream. It simply just wasnt hers and thats ok. We all have our lot in life

No. Sell the rumor event. 
Volume increased good amount on CME. Goldman coming in with their trading desks.  I expect liquidity to improve over the summer.  Would love the opportunity to trade BTC ETF on ARCA....My god, the execution speed.

i know, just seems like he was dropping bags onto the next guy.  It's like a trade you wouldn't do again and feel good to be out of.


!long xbtusd close 9300


Hard to be mad closing in heavy profit. Still, closing mine from 9280 at 9780 hurt when it was over 10300.
anythings possible.  I'm sure they have internal working sessions all the time.  Probably every week.  If there's no policy announcement it's not news.  FUD.




Agreed... the current wedge would have us around $10100 in 2-7 days if I can do some back-of-the-napkin prognosticating...

I moved my stops to $9250 in the event this turns around, but after this move above $9400, I'm feeling more confident that we'll be compliant with the current up channel 
Until this breaks below our previous low around 8700, I'd say it's the bears who aren't out of the bull woods.
It would be stupid to NOT think some of the richest people in the world despise Bitcoin and are actively conspiring against it. Seriously. Stupid.
bitcoin is also the single least anonymous currency in the history of currencies, so this sentiment is laughable.
So ironic because IMO one of the great features of crypto is to make money flows transparent - no more big business tax fraud, banks laundering drug money, price cartels, corporate lobbying, governments funding terrorist organizations.
Ponzi's are profitable for the early adopters.  If you legalized ponzi's, they'd invest.  Legalize crack, they'd invest.

tough to be a good salesman without knowing the product, i believe they both started in the trenches too.. gates with DOS and buffett with highly analytical corporate raiding.


There it goes. Nice call.
We should give it a name! Like Gandalf!
For every 1 person who bought BTC sub $1,000 and is still holding it, there are probably at least a dozen who bought sub $1,000 and still sold for a 25%+ loss.

BTC often looks like it only goes up, but that's obviously not the reality of the situation. 

Volatility is terrifying when the money you're investing needs to work for you to pay for college, retirement, a house, etc. 

Bitcoin IS NOT a safe investment. And it's arguably reckless to advice anybody otherwise. 
I'm arguably one of the best traders on this subreddit and I tell people to stick their money in SPY.

If I had free cash I'd be putting it in SPY. Low cost passive ETF investing is the smartest thing to do for *most* people.
He is absolutely a stereotypical old man who played his cards right and absolutely can be a dick. He excels in certain areas and he sticks to those. I could be wrong but didn't he say anyone who gives any value to an internet company is stupid? 
You realize Buffet has almost no cash to his name right? Almost everything is invested into companies. Those companies own physical assets and IP.

He owns control of said assets and IP. Even if crypto took over, it wouldn't change the ownership structure of enterprise.
so right before he dies, he's going to intentionally make a bad call as his final legacy out of spite.  He's a jealous 90 billion$ nocoiner.
 

From a pure investors point of view he is not wrong, it is still a speculative asset.

I do know financial advicors who are in cryptos. Of course only with the high risk tolerable customers and only with a very small position.


By the time Buffet was *born*, railroads had been around for almost a century.

Cryptocurrency has been around a decade and still hasn't shown large scale adoption or threat to traditional fiat.

I should also note Bill Gates invests in the railroads. On the whole, they have a better risk adjusted return than Tesla or SpaceX.
BFX has OCO order to do this.
Bitmex can. If your stop order triggers your position-reducing limits are also automatically canceled for you.
It is VE day tomorrow. That's a huge deal in France at least where it's a public holiday. Maybe a tad less in Germany.

I wish, the weather is really good today \(for this time of the year\), especially compared to the usual weather in the Netherlands / UK lately.
I was as well my friend and i am sure the both of us had some company. :)

BTW, i do not contest _chewtoy_, my comments is referred to all the people still holding their longs that will turn moderately bearish following his TA.

Was thinking more a volume thing if relevant. And as far as uk concerned, stunning weather with record breaking temps... rare here :) definately stop loss/buy order weather. Rock climbing at present myself :)
probably he doesn't even know what shorting is, he just heard it somewhere. I mean, warren buffet(compared to george soros) never made any money shorting either
There was no absolutism or theory, merely my take on Buffet and Gates' writing off of Bitcoin.  I would have put it in hypothesis form if I was trying to posit a theory.
The guy just loves to hate on crypto. I could never see him acting on these claims. At the end of the day, Bill Gates isn’t a trader.. he didn’t become a household name from his ability to trade and analysis markets.. the idea of him having deep pockets with the “intent” of shorting doesn’t worry me. 
I meant 7,000,000,000,000. 100x.
gates is going all cash and then 100x short on bitmex.  That gets him to 7 trillion not quadrillion.

https://www.trustnodes.com/2018/05/05/largest-liquidation-okex-history-sees-120-million-bitcoin-short-get-called

The point is that bitmex means you take on a lot of counter party risk and a lot of people don't particularly like the CME contracts
selling BTC would require quite a bit of effort and knowledge too.  Why would he bother selling it?  I think it's telling.

BTC is being *used* right now as a speculative investment and hedge against other more traditional investments.  

edit: I get what you mean about people obsessing over the price. interestingly enough, price (as it relates to a store of value) may eventually prove to be one of BTC's most useful features.
One inevitably means the other.
And the market doesn't have enough liquidity for it to be worth his time to even bother.  So he shorts it and makes $5 million profit.  That is insignificant in terms of his net worth and not worth the time thinking about.

It really won't. 1.39 billion of them are poor as dirt.
Agreed... which is why I like to hear contrarian views... they can help you develop a top level view that can inform trade decisions on a longer time scale... but we haven't seen much in today's thread
Why? BCH has no long term potential and I wouldn't be surprised if it were in the complete shitter in terms of price within the next few years. What exactly is the value add?
I'd buy bitcoin whether you meant 1 bitcoin or 10 ether or not. So it's a moot point but idk how you worded it, it's hard to tell what you are asking.
Kinda... not really. Ripple the company sells software that uses RippleNet.  Ripple the company does not have majority control of the network anymore.

Edit: not a question
Where do you get these numbers? All BTC holders at time of fork got BCH. I personally sold high and have rebought and have even more BCH and BTC than I had to begin with. I'm also mining BCH. Many people who got BCH in the fork are still holding it just as an insurance policy. Seems like saying 80% is held be 2-3 individuals is pulling numbers out of thin air. Do you have anything to back that up?  

As a trade BCH has been awesome, buy when the ratio is .10 or below and sell when ratio is above .15. There have been a number of opportunities to do this. 

Just because someone believes BCH has a future in crypto doesn't make them a sock puppet or "mind-virus" victim. 
Most of the people who replied to you should feel worse about their responses than you do for asking the question.

It was a legitimate question, and you shouldn't have been downvoted, given the topic the OP brought up.
DAI stablecoin is better than USDT. FUN token is better than trusting a gambling website to be fair. There are plenty of other examples, too.

Idk man, just don't believe in the bulls right now, might buy back in sub 9000
And starting with a series of more severe drops that fake people out. (depending on your timezone that part might be April 30th)
thanks very much sir I'll look for it, i always check for your position you provide good guidancle !
Thanks 
Wanted to ask you about your target, but I think your response will be something like 'holding until be'.

So I'll ask where you think it may bounce? You still think 9-8.8-8.6 support zones?
Now buyers building up on order book around 9200 on finex.  On the market depth chart it looks like a staircase....Which usually means it's one big whale, orders are broken down in blocks creating that staircase....Just my observation.
I know, but it held and did that after massive market sell order 200btc+...The fact that it held off all those market sell orders, it is support, I agree the $30 bounce is pretty weak. 
someone bought over 700 BTC at $9,200 - pretty solid bounce. we'll see what happens from here
Did you mean $130...?
does finex offer € pairing?
Spot on

You can create a post just stating your position like normally you do and not use the syntax. When you complete your post, you can then comment on your post with the syntax for the bot. The system will use your main post as link to the position on the site like you if you had put the syntax in the first place.
I realize people are paranoid, and rightly so, but would it be better to have an open source browser extension (no auto updates) that logs your trades automatically? Then you don't have to do anything.
We might need to establish a white-list of accounts who can get away with posting their positions this way. IMO, the basis should be some kind of rubric that looks at the user's overall contribution to the sub and the up votes they usually get in their commentary/analysis.

So it is not possible to provide Fiat funding and stay with your stack in Fiat? You can only provide BTC funding, but if BTC goes down you might loose money, because the BTC value loss is higher than your funding gains? Is this correct? Thank you in advance for a clear answer.

On Bitfinex you receive currently 0.13&#37; for providing Fiat funding per day. Wanted to try out Bitmex now, but if I do not have the option to stay in Fiat it is a no\-option to me.
all of those are possible, this market is irrational, be prepared for anything
Sellers will see it as an opportunity to load up on shorts while buyers continue to decide they are "le tired" and give up momentarily.

EDIT: If buyers push above $9,400, then perhaps $9,175 was the local bottom. If not, strap in for continued downard pressure.

He's not an incredible investor. He's a great salesman who got people to buy into a glorified mutual fund that doesn't even outperform index funds in most years, even with a portfolio consisting primarily of oligopolies that basically can't lose.
He has the best team of publicists that money can buy.   And the American people are very easily manipulated and conned, as we know all too well. 
Laughable, is it really? There are probably millions of young men who's fathers are "very successful businessmen", but only one made it to being Warren Buffet. Ie. from 100usd to 1million USD (or whatever your definition of self made) is  a LOT shorter trip than what he made from whatever stack he started out with. So yes, self made by anyone's measure. 
I dont think 'self-made' means your father has to be a loser.  It means you didn't inherit your wealth.

Buffet knows damn well how markets work. He can keep investing in the S&P 500 and keep getting richer, because he knows the S&P is reliable.

Buffet is smart enough not to short BTC because he doesn't understand it. He is also smart enough to not go long, because as far as he knows it's inherently worthless. Better to stick with reliable stocks as he does. 
He was also born into an already multi-millionaire family and thus never had to worry about actually sustaining himself when he started Microsoft.

Not to undermine his achievements, but he is not rags to riches.
the OTC markets aren't as liquid as exchanges and can dry up in a snap, if that happens they'll panic dump on an exchange.  Fear of getting caught by their govt may actually force them to hodl and ride it out, lol.

Just like Korea is not the only one in the world yet the news or even rumors of news in Korea affect the entire market.  

Every major market plays a factor  
I understand there is a lot of anti-US sentiment around the world, particularly because some (but not all) Americans have a very US-centric view of the world.  But to say the rest of the crypto world doesn’t care about the SEC ruling is just as ignorant.  


it's not, but a major agency in a major country has a huge impact on crypto price. We've seen that countless of times with past US rulings.
TA is based on statistics? I thought it was based on behavioral economics. Statistics is an actual science while TA is a self fulfilling propchecy at best. Not that it is not useful but let's not mix up actual science with hocus pocus.
> SEC matter is still priced in

how is a decision that isn't released yet already priced in? please stop using the word 'priced in' unless you know what it works. The uncertainty may be priced in, but the result is not. 
Eh, bitcoin while tied to the others, is in a separate class.  No others have professional retail trading desks being setup - bitcoin has several.  No others have US regulated futures - bitcoin has 2.  No others have significant real world economic integration - bitcoin has over 144,000 at last count.  So while there is correlation in speculation of the alt market, bitcoin has both a buffer, from real world integration, and a huge defensive position, from multiple professional/retail regulated exchange opportunities.  

Additionally, there is little indication the SEC will impose truly (ban all coins) negative regulation on cryptos.  They will put standard protections in place in an attempt to stop scams.  Im hoping there is a lot more in the way of clarity which will cause a boom in the market (yes with some winners and losers as a result but long term positive).  If you look back 2-3 year, basically every time the SEC or Finra came out with clarifying guidance the market shot up.  Because low and behold, money likes certainty, stability, and regulations that encourage it.
Yep. This is part of why I think this is not going to be a huge deal. Gs is getting very deep into this space and will continue to push btc even if every alt is banned.

Sick lines bruv
Can't disagree with you there. 

The market could drop well into the $7,000s and still maintain above the log-resistnace-line of the January to April bear trend: https://imgur.com/a/O3Dq7YY

If we were having this conversation on Friday, I'd say you were worrying about nothing and the market was mere hours away from establishing above $10,000 to build a base to attack $11,700. 

Instead, I think it's probably more likely that the market is gearing up for one last gasp of the bear trend down into the $7,000s.

Either way though, I'm fine holding onto my long until breakeven and waiting for a buying opportunity far lower once the log resistance line is confirmed as support.
TCP/IP protocols had no intrinsic value, other than to relay information, until there was a network large enough for everyone to use. 

Not as elegant as a grasshopper for breakfast, but that is what Chewtoy is for :)
And what I'm telling you is that no such argument can be made, and Bill Gates is absolutely correct in his assessment. 

While it has the potential to disrupt the entire world economy and unify humanity under a single universal currency, right not it's just a speculative asset with limited real-world uses. 

If we all stopped eating steak and ate grasshoppers instead, we might solve world hunger overnight. But that doesn't mean Grasshopper flour is the future of cuisine anymore than bitcoin is the future of currency.
Because it's about the valuation of an idea. 

The idea is that cryptocurrency has huge advantages over current methods of transacting value. 

If that idea is correct it will take over the world. If it is 5% correct, the value is very far to the north of where we are now. 

In either case (or anywhere inbetween) all of that currency will require an underlying store of value on which to pin things.

That store is Bitcoin - no other network is as secure, decentralised and provides Proof of Work to the same extent.

An (open-minded) sceptic only has to ask themselves therefore what the current rivals to BTC have that will allow them to win the race.
I see what you mean. Basically, I just tell everyone I meet who is skeptical that it's not likely to go away any time soon, but isn't ready for prime time yet due to a lack of liquidity in the market resulting in volatility. If that type of thing bothers them as an investor, they need to just stay away for a few years. Then I say if they have a small (less than 5% of their investment stack) amount of money they don't mind watching balloon and shrink, they'd do well to invest it in Bitcoin because I personally think it will grow in value a lot more in the coming years. I never try to talk them into buying Bitcoin, because that would just make me look like a pyramid scheme shill, which is the worst way to come off as with something like this. 
His argument really bothered me. Where does personal responsibility come into play, Bill? How much more dangerous is it for these people to go find a dealer for their drugs? Or are you only bothered by the fact that it's hard to find and catch these drug dealers? So many questions.

I don't disagree with this, topics involving the governing of trillions of dollars in assets and the currencies that go along with it is very dense, especially when some start out ahead of everyone else. 

There is a history (Scotland, parts of Canada, I believe) that have successful stories of private banks issuing private money backed by a standard peg (silver). So I don't disagree that its complicated, merely that it is possible.

I hear people say there is no way to get money out of politics, but then someone writes a book on it: Republic, Lost: How Money Corrupts Congress—and a Plan to Stop It. Maybe someone should write a book on this subject.
Globally, the top 1% own 51% of all wealth today. Just saying.
I mean if that's how you view it then why are you wasting your time here?
I said I do not believe it falls into that category; but even if I am wrong the economy and society is build on greater fool concept very much.

Tbh. greater fool is not binary category. Nothing is either in fully or completely out. So let's take it that I believe BTC is much less on the list, but the things from list work pretty well. Also the altcoins are much closer to the list and... they "work". The fact that LTC is around so long and appreciating can not be taken lightly.
A lot of people don't have brains capable of thinking beyond taking people's words at face value.   It doesn't occur to them that someone may have ulterior motives when making public statements.

Or maybe they sleep better at night not knowing that they are up against the entire world (that has trillions of dollars and tanks and aircraft carriers) and they are almost certainly going to lose in the long run.

It has been a fun and profitable ride for some of us, but don't believe the party is going to continue for that much longer. 
Not useful for you =\= Not useful for everyone.

You can also get BTC from Kraken or Gemini or Localbitcoins.
Then why do you want BTC if it doesn't have any utility for you?  Or perhaps you think it is 100% used for speculation.  I use it for greater financial privacy and also to make payments online (with greater privacy).   I also like how you can transport it from one place to another (or one country to another) with very little risk of government employees stealing it from you at gunpoint.

And I don't trust Coinbase either...or Poloniex or Bitfinex or HitBTC or Bittrex...and the list goes on.   But there would be many more options if gov'ts weren't trying to shut it all down.

you won't hold though
datamish.com or https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BITFINEX:BTCUSDSHORTS / https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BITFINEX:BTCUSDLONGS to see margin positions. 

And yes, long squeeze 'can' be a thing if pushed enough, although longs tend to be a bit more resilient since there's always a limit to how much a long can lose and it is easier to protect; a short can have infinite potential downside so people are more likely to get out of losing shorts faster. 
0 isn't too far from 6.8 and then we go imaginary.
I did see a large player accumulating there, yes, but no desperation.  It's much easier to drive the price up than down.  The supply (float, anyway) gets smaller every day, and the demand gets bigger. This is why Bitcoin is now worth close to $10,000 and why it will continue to grow.  You can't naked short Bitcoin.  That's got to be frustrating for anyone used to playing the rigged traditional markets.
Well, up so far.
I did too. I'm fairly certain I had mine set at 9818, so that's probably likely. 
!long xbtm18 add 9549 16%

Dips
Yup, you said this a few days ago and it got me thinking...$10k would really be the perfect last local top for a while. Just seems too damn obvious.

this is why I was hoping for a pullback earlier, because now the market is so overextended that any selling could potentially be disastrous 
It was obviously unsustainable back then as well. The only open question at the time was how far up it would go.
Yes, I used just that as a point of reference. 
Why 6 months? What about the people who bought in 3 months months ago? 2 months? You made up some profitable number of months.

that's as useless as the people saying anyone who bought an hour ago are in profit. Do you see how useless your comment is? There was no rational explaination or anything.
Anyone who bought and held 5 months ago is in the red. 
5 months or 7 months


I mean, doesn't that really just make it... not a cup and handle?

There doesn't have to be a pattern for the breakout, or maybe there was some other pattern leading up to it. It could even just be a break of horizontal resistance.

I get being a little more lax with some aspects of a pattern with crypto, particularly regarding time scales (for instance, a normal C&H is obviously over a very long time span). But the handle being in the top half of the cup is essentially one of the defining aspects of a C&H, no?
Sort of. It's really more of a way to say absolutely nothing of substance but use a fancy term to make it sound like you know what you're talking about. It's all about redrawing lines too. *And*, again, to top it off, it's completely post hoc. You would know if something is a hyperwave until long after the fact and even then, if the price starts to go up again, you just redraw the lines and say "whoops, actually it's still only in phase 2 or 3". Rinse and repeat. It's total pseudo-TA and should not be taken seriously. I'd be curious if anyone has a serious defense to put forth for it though. 
It's almost certainly bullshit. It's Tyler Jenks' theory to explain the action of certain markets that follow this "hyperwave" path of accelerated growth before collapse. He applies this model to gold and a number of other assets but the model basically just boils so to draw a handful of strong support (no break) lines after various points and numbering them. I'm not really doing it justice, I guess, but really I'm doing it *too much* justice. I'd recommend reading up on it. It's not complex, it's just complete post-hoc gibberish.
I spilled my drink while laughing at your comment, my keyboard thank you
I played around with backtests using chandelier exits sized with multiples of ATR that did alright.  The best performing stops I tried were stair-step stops which are much closer to manual stop moving.  The stop only gets moved after price has moved two stop sizes in favor of the position.
[deleted]
That's live... but patience is the key
nope....
Fair enough, but it did play out, though not a very comfortable higher low,instead a double bottom. 
Not so bad if they hedged with a long from 6
That's not a trend. You can always draw your line from a higher point unless you're right at an ATH. The direction depends on how many coins Dumpy the Bearwhale wants to lose money on this time. If he's running out of gas, we go up. If he's got 50,000 coins to sell, maybe we go down for a few days.
Care to argument your statement?
why? People trade on binance rather than on GDAX now. volume is much higher there.
idk, but I think Binance is higher ranked in the app store in most countries than coinbase, which has been the case since the alt bubble in Dec as far as I'm aware. 
Yea that is my view, the 20k top was the peak of a public hype cycle. The previous big move in 2013 topped out around where we were at the start of this one. So I'd say holding 20k for some time will be a catalyst for the next wave. Getting to 20k again now without all the hype is going to take a long time, I'm looking at 3-5 years, might even be a decade assuming the tech hasn't been completely undermined by then. Just my opinion.
I shouldn't have worded it to make it sound like it's impossible, but as you mentioned, certainly very difficult for someone who doesn't start with wealth.  16 years with no free time, friends, etc. is pretty rough.  Do you mind if I ask what you did to get there, or what industry you were in?
you didnt miss much in those 15 years.   2001-2016 kinda sucked.

I wouldn't use the word "gamble", makes you sound like a bad trader.  Speculation is calculated risk, risk without calculation is gambling.
My target has always been 50k, but it has also always been with the idea it will coincide with a much more robust ecosystem with tons of active use cases. I'm so torn right now because I thought there would be many more practical use cases than there currently are, yet here we are at 10k, 50% from ATH.

I have no idea how to value this shit, and I don't think anyone else does either. What a crazy thing this bitcoin phenomenon is.
No but it's a hot potato game.
That's not a 5% and 1% movement...and your position size directly affects your profits...
You can tell who put in a leveraged long position at $9900
I don’t even know where to begin trying to correct the record on your numerous misconceptions, so I will just let your idiocy speak for itself. 
Username checks out
Like I said, it is one of the greatest.
It seems all you care about is your trading profits, because if you understood bitcoin you’d be rooting for it. 
be sure you got $$ to cover
You haven't been watching the last month, have you. Traditionally BTC has been the leader, but it's been dragged around like a ragdoll the last 4 weeks.
It's too far back in my post history to find when but one of BTC's major dumps on the way to 6.5 was led by ETH majorly dumping. Both had been waffling and then ETH started dumping hard 15 minutes before BTC went down.
The question was about why prices for the same asset on the same exchange are reported differently in different places. It was not a question about exchange price deviations.
Just went long thanks!! 
hidden because of the timeframe?
The last time I made a bank transfer purchase (about a month ago), it was instantaneous. That was definitely not the case in previous months, so I'd say it's even more likely that it should be significantly faster now with a credit card purchase. 
I haven't used them in a while so I haven't the faintest idea. It **should** be better now though as the hype cycle has passed. 
gates goes all cash 80 billion then 100x 
for an 8 trillion $ short

That's a hell of a rabbit trail we could go down. 

I was unaware of this, though.
Very true lol
The opposite of fud (don't know the name for it)
> nothing is actually happening at all.

spot on
Indeed, it could be awhile before any information surfaces.
I can see it being a really good thing for another bubble- announced at the wrong time and it will be a non event. I can also see it accelerating the realization that bitcoin is entirely speculative and has no real use case right now. 

Price getting ahead of fundamentals always results in the market eventually sobering up and realizing they're overvaluing an asset. There will be a reflexive realization at some point in which people understand bitcoin is not about what it is supposed to be about. 

I'm sure you will disagree- but I can already see it with several long term holders and I'm preparing for it to continue happening. As the space gets corroded with more and more greedy speculators, the original investors realize the purpose of crypto has shifted from real world usage to speculative greed. 

When we begin to see usage my tune will change- until then, I still think we're on a completely unsustainable path upwards that will result in lots of pain and disappointment
That's very true, although I say that's part of the hype. People only bought those coins because they believed it'd be free money. Self fulfilling prophecy and all that. Hype sustains itself until the hype required to sustain high prices exceeds new hype generation and then it all crumples upon itself
It's very difficult to do honestly. I started out with little understanding of bitcoin thinking it was this amazing new thing because I was high on paper gains. I'd never "'made money" so fast in my life. When my friend asked me what it even is I tried to explain but he really didn't get why it should be worth so much and I told him he just didn't get it. I eventually went to thinking it's a worthless piece of shit that's effectively a ponzi scheme.

Now I'm just trying to balance the two and get a feel for what it actually is versus what people have made it.  A difficult part of that is that bitcoin is very much so what people make of it. 

But hey, thanks. I try to be as level headed as possible about it. 
I still remember the $17250 sell wall on GDAX. 1250 btc...twice. 
Some dude really took advantage of the hype and got out at an amazing exit point.

The smart money exits on exuberance and seems to enter on dumps/low sentiment and sideways with good news. 
Yes  I agree. I just think no matter what the news will follow the price. If we dump from here, people will blame it on some random FUD or news and say good news doesn't matter in a bear market.

If we pump, people will say it's NYSE and whatever else they come up with when in reality, for the past year and a half, price movements have been almost entirely driven by people trying to sell to the next dude at a higher price. 

We'll pump if market sentiment is strong enough and the newbies aren't bored of crypto yet
*if* it happens, I agree. But it hasn't happened and it's not happening...

9 years is long enough to see a decent use case and here we are with what seems like merchants *pulling* it more often adopting it. 

How long will prices stay inflated before people collectively realize that it has no use case? At least right now. If these speculators are priced in, how long will people wait? 
I would love to BTC or LN-BTC to replace Visa/MC, but how is this event close?

Current LN is not able to do it even technically. There is max 100M or so open/close channels per year on 1MB block BTC. That means max 100M people, realistically more like 10M.

I like LN idea, but it is just obvious it needs L3 to even potentially cover the globe. The amount of merchants that will apply LN upgrade is extremely limited for the max 10M customers.

LN, as it is, is a progress, but no scaling solution at all yet.
news of the winklevoss etf decision/suspension of decision/final decision moved the price a couple times substantially.
I'd LOVE the consumer protection.  If they could get a decent exchange up and running in under a decade.
People are literally forced to trade on fly-by-night exchanges in dangerous jurisdictions because of the red tape slowing everything down in the US.
By the time we finally get a decent exchange up, the crypto fad will be dead and the grand opening will have crickets chirping.. or all the traffic will have moved to DEX's.


How did the telegraph compare to the carrier pigeon or messenger?

I actually own an electronic payments company and we primarily work in processing credit cards. There are far more issues than just the speed. For example, the card issuers get a huge chunk of the transactional income (up to 3.5%) along with the APR that they attach to the credit card. They hit the customer, and the merchant for using the credit card. Do you know how much money that adds up to every year that banks are raking in? The systems are also incredibly complex. Issuing banks, processing banks, member banks of the Fed, the front end authorization networks, back end settlement networks, Etc Etc..... All of which are completely different businesses and have complete authority, not to mention a system based on a dollar that is constantly devalued. 


In regards to Napoleon that is literally the point.... He didnt understand but made a definitive statement. Almost exactly what Buffet is doing. Pretty much a guarantee that if you asked how Bitcoin worked he would give you a horrible explanation. All he knows is "you can transfer money"

>The only thing better crypto does compared to our traditional banking is that it's faster

I don't know how slow banking is in your part of the world, but where Iive I can make a bank transfer and it will show up in the payee's account pretty much instantly. Same with cash deposits/withdrawals, debit card payments etc. All much faster than bitcoin. Even when dealing with vast sums of money, payments go through within a few hours.

International transfers can take days though, so although that's pretty much the only area where BTC wins in terms of speed, it's a very significant win I guess. **Edit: Also 24/7 payment processing.



That was the excuse they used for protectionist policies.
My original country is within EU and does not have. The people "investing" into US stocks are just another losers there.

Either way bitcoins or crypto will not make everyone rich as well. If the niche goes well, it will be just few hundred thousands individuals at most.

Speaking just about BTC: even if it goes 100x up to 1M. There is just technically up to 21M people now who can make from 10K 1M. In fact it is much less:

There are many hodlers whith large sums of money who are waiting to sell much higher. So there is not 21 or 17M free bitcoins. It is much less.

Also once people would start buying the theoretical 1 btc per person and hodl it, the price would already start to hike.

Even if it is not just about BTC, the point stands.

So if crypto succeeds the benefit will be again for a very tiny fraction of people. So we will move to the same system as by now.
Yes, it makes no sense, at least now as KoKansei wrote. The people who want to do non-qualified financial decisions will do it even if they are restricted from certain markets.
Except the difference is that in the private business world there are numerous ways to *legally* screw you out of your investment.

It's almost expected for a VC to try and screw over the angels. Angels screw over founders all of the time. Founders screw over naive investors if they think they can.

Startups are a cutthroat environment. The average person would get slaughtered left and right. In fact, the honest and honorable startup+investor combo is actually the exception, not the norm.

Your average person simply isn't equipped for the requirements of said investment. For example, in most cases, a startup can force investors to show up to view the company's financials (or have a local private auditor). That's expensive and not something your average person can afford (the time nor money).

At the end of the day, it comes down to the fact that private business is a deadly environment that requires a minimum of a few hundred thousand in liquid net worth just to keep from getting your throat slit. Your average person would get scammed left and right.

Hence, why most people are losing money in ICO's left and right.
I'd advise you to avoid hypothetical formations whenever possible and stick to formations that already exist. 

Like this ascending channel, for example:

https://imgur.com/a/tfpaOJk

In the scenario you outline above, I'd be far more concerned with the breakdown from the channel than I would be with confirmation of a double top at $9,800. 

If that channel breaks with conviction, I might close my long and open a short. Or maybe just close my long and sit on the sidelines. 

But we'll see where the market is trading if it does break down. Could very well be that we'll see $10,200 or $10,300 first and it'll break down next week at $9,700 or so. 
Is it so much to ask for another bull run up to $20K that allows me to close my position at 125% profit in 2 months?
Except all of the problems that were mentioned in the ETF decision *last year* are still present today. There's literally no reason for the SEC to change it's mind.

Just because more people are pouring money in doesn't mean there should be an ETF out there.
Haha sure you did.
Get a sin bin, you two
that makes sense, I know what you mean
Are you saying Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme? If so, I think you're in the wrong sub. 
Thanks man.. glad I got in position at $9350.  I think I'll let this one ride for a couple days. :)
I was telling everyone here (and everywhere else) that unless you use crypto on a daily basis in business or life (a true convert), then you don't belong within 10 miles of it.

It's not something you can just passively invest in. It's nearly a full time job just keeping up with the news. It's also somewhat complicated so it requires you to really know tech and have a solid grasp on finance and economics. At the end of the day, it's soo stupidly risky that it makes for an absolutely shitty investment.
The point is that if bitcoin takes over the world, that will objectively not be the case for all serious investors.
if he said it during the dotcom bubble of 2k he wasn't

He does have large investments in banking and insurance, sectors which could be significantly disrupted by cryptocurrencies and their derivative products. 
If crypto takes over then it would mean many things changed. To name just one: people will park money at crypto and it will imply massive outflow from classic assets. Why there is a stock bubble at companies that do not even pay dividends?  Because there is no alternative. If crypto is that alternative, stocks go south.
People are really dumb here... there are a hell of a lot of abstractionists who come up with the craziest theories about how they think finance actually works.  Like I said. Really dumb.


ah right. I'm always confused since the Netherlands celebrate the 5th, France the 8th.... anyway here in germany it's different 😀
I'm French living in Germany and can confirm you that I'm working today :) they obviously don't celebrate anything today
meant theory in a more conversational sense.  Is Bill Gates the kind of guy who is typically against new ideas?   Like a religious conservative type might be against CRISPR technology?  Or maybe someone who's old-fashioned and prefers a rural lifestyle?  He doesn't strike me as a luddite, but it seems to be the consensus on this forum, and nowhere else.



oh I know, man. I'm not worried about that at all.
oh I know, I would never use Bitmex for that very reason. doesn't change the fact that there are, indeed, easy ways to short bitcoin. 
diversify, not hedge
Yea. But that's true of many investments for someone with billions of dollars.
lol you guyzzzz. 

Seriously though would be better if we could get China & India on board again, despite them not necessarily being market makers, it's still 40% of global population as potential customers. Plus, both India and China have vast amounts of wealthy people too.
Wow and here I was thinking this was a global revolutionary asset but  it's just for rich people 
Yes I agree that banning billions of people from buying it is "Good for Bitcoin".   
I get that Ver and the zealotry around Cash can be super annoying, but the tech is pretty fundamentally sound right? The mempool was super full and there were crazy fees to send BTC at the end of last year, that is a fact. So the value add is bigger blocks and lower fees.  You can say LTC also has low fees, but that's not solving BTC's problem, it's just dumping it on a different chain with fewer transactions (which you could in theory do indefinitely with various coins/forks).

If you say that the cost of running a node is prohibitively expensive because of the extra storage required by bigger blocks (and thus causes more centralization because fewer people can run nodes), then I would again point to the 40$ transaction fees of late last year (which buy you quite a bit of storage). If BTC is meant to be a very secure way for rich people to transfer their wealth then so be it, but I think most would agree that the goal is for it to be usable by all.
Got it. Thanks for the advice.

Thank you I appreciate the understanding.  Frankly I felt quite bewildered and discouraged by the down votes.  
DAI requires that Ethereum remain valuable itself. Not familiar with the other ones. What about my points on centralization, mutability and censorship? (and the fact that it's a premined, unregulated security)?
I doubt the market will break straight through $9,000 and $8,800 in one shot. 

A bounce back to $9,300 or $9,400 is very likely. 

If $9,000 breaks, I'd expect the market to bounce back to $9,200 before buyers concede. 
No, the initial bounce was about 30$, check the time of the comment.
He was right in the end but not when posted.
yes
The easiest way could be to do a poll once in a while and update this white list. This would allow me to send only PMs to all users unless they were whitelisted.

[deleted]
This is probably the solution that's going to be the least controversial.

People like myself who post their positions in the daily thread can continue to do so as we've been doing, and update via PM if we so choose. And anybody who wants to track their position without providing entry/exit rationale can also do so via PM.
What about a link on the right to the position tracker page and to a post where this commands could be inserted?
I could then remove the link from the comments the bot posts and direct users to that "sticky" post
Correct, if you put any BTC onto Bitmex, it will always remain as BTC. The only thing you can do is a 1x leverage short which is close to the same as being in fiat (as your dollar value remains the same if the BTC price goes up while your BTC stack size diminishes). 

If you're looking to collect funding payslips, Bitfinex is much easier / safer. Unless of course it goes down and tether goes down and everything goes down as some fudsters think it will, but then you're probably fucked either way, be it on Bitfinex or Bitmex.
i might expect a dump prior to the meeting, people who are not 100% sure and want to take some profits, but after the hearing it could go both ways.

If he's such a spectacular investor, why does Berkshire Hathaway underperform most mutual funds?
Self made is just that, self made.   You made it on your own. No connections from your four-term congressman father. No fat stack gift from your wealthy father to help you get started, etc.   I’m not arguing that Buffett is not a great success, a revered investor, and an American icon. He is all of those but he is not self made.   Your parents don’t need to be losers to be self made but as a child of the political and business elite of Nebraska, Buffett is not self made.  He started way ahead of most and I just don’t see how you can consider him self made. 
I didn't mean to imply otherwise.
Ain't that always how it is tho

I guess Jeff Bezos was middle class, he worked the morning shift at McDonald's as a teen
I personally know a couple OTC desk guys, it's not drying up at all. They are raising minimums though, which is interesting
I do know that, but thanks nonetheless ;)
old man yells at age.
If no furhter regulation then no changes to current sentiment.
If further regulation are added just expect the worst.

And by the way, genuine quesiton, by how many months the market knows about the SEC regulation thing? 

Unless it is just since the 5th of May, when accidentally we were rejected at 10k, then the sentiment has been pretty bullish in the last month, isn't it?
I'm not saying Bitcoin is the same thing as XRP or some shit like ExperiencePoints or something, but its price is highly correlated to trading volumes in all that garbage. Significant real world integration of Bitcoin? Please, 'real world' use of Bitcoin is completely dwarfed by the trading volumes on exchanges and OTC. 

I am not saying regulations are bad for the market long term, or that wiping out some of the bullshit ICOs is a bad thing -- but if market confidence suffers, Bitcoin *will* suffer as well, even though the percentage losses in Bitcoin value would be lower than those in Ethereum or whatever coins affected by whatever rulings. 

Any kind of scenario where SEC comes out with any kind of restrictive measures that make fiat onramps more difficult or limit trading in whatever other way resulting in a net gain for Bitcoin in the short term, until the market adapts to the new regulatory framework and trading volumes recover, is completely implausible. 
Right I mean my point is that the premium is double where it was last time we were at these levels. And because what? Because we ran up to $10k and bounced off? Feels like bull trap central.

\> Either way though, I'm fine holding onto my long until breakeven and waiting for a buying opportunity far lower once the log resistance line is confirmed as support. 

I notice you include a lot of this sunk cost fallacy in your decision making lately. I'm not trying to criticize your trading, and I love what you bring to this community, but this is just one of my pet peeves. Entries are irrelevant. What matters is the current market and the current trade you make now. You are choosing to be long right now, and where you break even is irrelevant. Longing right now and closing at your 8.8k entry price is no different of a trade than you staying in your long and closing at 8.8k. You are essentially treating your profits on your current trade as not real money and acting accordingly. 
Chew is there a technical reason you would close at break-even ($8,800) or is it more because it is your break-even point?
TCP/IP isn't rent seeking; why does crypto need to be?
>If we all stopped eating steak and ate grasshoppers instead, we might solve world hunger overnight. But that doesn't mean Grasshopper flour is the future of cuisine anymore than bitcoin is the future of currency.

It would also go a long way towards combating man-made climate change. There is even more reason for us to adopt grasshopper flour than BTC. 

!100x long grasshoppers 
It does produce something of far greater value than any other investment I can think of off the top of my head: perfect money; that is, money with a perfect audit trail that cannot be obfuscated or gamed and money that does not involve trusting a shady third party (bank, payment processor) to process the payment. 

These guys don't like it because it will eventually expose their funny money for the massive fraud that it is.
> If we all stopped eating steak and ate grasshoppers instead, we might solve world hunger overnight.

This Guy Analogies!
So are you just gambling using TA? Do you consider this the same as playing a game of roulette?
bah i just read bill gates, yeah he's anti bitcoin because it threatens established power.
Disappointing.  It's the anonymity he hates.  So his bear case is just bs.  He wouldn't fear it unless it was real.  All the talk about 'its just another ponzi' is cover for their fear of the new technology and how it will disrupt society.









so if I do not agree with the consensus, I should just quietly go away and let you sit in an echo chamber?

you just confirmed my view that people in this sub do not want to hear opinions, unless they parrot their own.  If that is the case, why are you here?  I mean, you are already so right about everything what could you possibly learn from others?
tanks and aircraft carriers don't do shit though.  When did the USS nimitz ever stop a meth lab.

You'd stop more crime giving the trillion $$ away than buying tanks with it.  Or hire cops.





thank you for the help with exchanges...and I forgot about Localbitcoins ;-) 
its the old one that happened a few months back.
that is the old hearing
This is the old one
Thanks for the info. When looking at the charts, 30489 for longs and 20257 for shorts. Is this the amount of shorts vs longs opened currently on bitfinex? Does it take into account the amount the people are shorting, is that reflected in the size of the candles? 
We go straight into the quantum realm...and then can pop around and find a way to defeat Thanos.

> Just seems too damn obvious.

Just like $20K was too obvious and so many other round numbers before it.

Yes sometimes I make trading much more difficult than it is.  I figured I would short right below $10K and cover right above $9200.  I didn't think it would actually do that so precisely and I managed to screw up part of my trade, but that's essentially what I ended up doing with about 1/3 of my position.

Sometimes the money is just sitting there, begging for you to take it.   Again, I still screw it up most of the time, but sometimes I manage to grab some of it.
the purpose of the post was to state a fact, and give some perspective to the short-sighted among us
yep that is also true, but also much more specific
so you're comparing saying anyone who has held their position for six months to anyone who bought within a specific month or two timeframe? both are true, but very different statements.
I only watched the one or two shows. I may look into it next weekend after I finish off a few things I been reading up on the last week. I think they mean a channel that gets steeper and steeper like a parabola VIA momentum trading that it has to come down due to whatever little glitch is going to cause the crash. Amazon are meant to be a in a hyperwave, just looks like a parabola to me. Should look for a best fit line and short once the parabola breaks. First target for that would be 50% then short the bounce to 40% ATH. I'm assuming you could do that on 1broker(?). I'm thinking of setting alerts on a few charts and keeping a hundred bucks here and there for high probability trades. Never traded a traditional market though. Could be fun...Especially of you use this strategy

Work, dammit.

then they would have had to have made *two* perfect calls 
Other people have posted the same chart and line.  You think it's not a trendline and we all think it is.  We will leave it at that.
Good point did not think of that!
Well I count it precisely, it is 13.5 now, but not the end yet. There is lot to do, I actually start new projects. It is rough, but after a while you do not know how is it to have friends, free time etc. Times of total darkness. Life is a trade-off. I just realized in my mid-20s after breakup that I was avoiding a full dedication into anything and that I do not want to die like that.

It is hard, because we all are educated (=manipulated) to be weak, because this way we sacrifice easily our lives. I hated the fact in the beginning. But now, I feel that the world is really ok to be divided like that. As time went on, I had employees who wanted to work hard (I pay them in BTC and other cryptos) and they are still here working and hodling and then I had employees, who were not hard on themselves, and they have nothing and will work elsewhere 9 to 5 until 65 (maybe until 75).

My niche is online gambling, so it is in fact what most people in this sub are doing but do not want to admit, lol. Actually online gambling was growing a lot during the 1.5 decade, but states went against it, bc officially it is the public interest (in fact it is protection of national monopolies). So the gambling shifted fast and flourished in cryptos. I believe Binance is now the world biggest casino, it is just not called like that. Even the homepage with Lambos looks like casino. 
I am not what day is today, because they are all the same, but I think we are +- in May 2018.
👌
I understand the good and bad of BTC.  This sub is for trading, not blind faith HODLing.
Hype?
one use case is as a way to diversify your personal wealth. even if you don't use it for that purpose, many people do.
you hit the nail on the heard here. BTC is what people make it. in fact, *anything* is what people make it. I think people are making it a store of value and will continue to do so.
Well said. It's about keeping that balance between thinking about what Bitcoin/blockchain *could* be and understanding where it's at *currently*. 

And that's why this subreddit is so great. It's one of the few places where there's people who are realistic about the future to realize there's a number of things that could happen that are, in fact, NOT good for Bitcoin and that its price may not go up and up forever.

Maybe because people here are willing to short it when they think it's going to go down so they have less bias, idk.
Yeah, Bitcoin as a technology/network is nigh-impossible for your average person to fully wrap your head around...but then when you add markets to it (which adds at least two other significant dimensions, one being the future potential discounted to today and the other being the crazy speculative casino game we all know and love/hate)...people's heads just explode. So they tend to focus on one part, if anything at all. So you get the "BTC is the future" people who mostly see the tech part vs. the "lol ponzi scheme" people that mostly see the casino part, and all that.
LN will take decades to be a force.. even getting segwit adoption which is a minor change took years, and still isnt adopted, and it's like a minor inconvenience to make the new wallet and move coins over.  

Its the same reason why all these ICO's are going to be worthless in 5 years, and we'll consolidate to like 5-10 major coin networks.

Tech doesnt matter..  adoption does.  Many newcomers dont remember the decade it took to get to this point, with bitcoin.  That was the network.. slowly encircling the globe.








Yeah that guy, and the other guy/group unloading 100 BTC every $50 on GDAX for days and days at those price levels was what finally convinced me to start unloading as well.
I mean the market definitely reacts to news at least sometimes. Exchange hacks, China bans, Futures markets and Jamie Dimon have pretty clearly had causative effects on the market. Only big and substantial stories can really make an impact though. Also, these are usually still subject to the constraints and impacts of technicals, imo. A good piece of news at the top/end of a big ascending triangle will likely trigger a nice breakout.
Not to assume anything, but it sounds like you've never actually used Bitcoin.  Even without LN, it's the best form of money out there. You can hand it over like cash by tapping phones, or send it around the world.  Easiest. Thing. Ever. And no banks pimping out your data or jacking you on bullshit fees.  

I feel very sorry for you if you don't have any because within five years Bitcoin will be synonymous with money all over this planet.
I wasn't around then, so I can't say it feels different, but man it sure sounds very different. 
> People are literally forced to trade on fly-by-night exchanges in dangerous jurisdictions 

Of course they are, because it hurts demand.  Although arguably, it has always been the case, even before more regulation.  There were always thieves and scammers running most of the exchanges.  
Napoleon was a military leader, not mechanic, physicist, or even sailor.

While Buffet doesn't know much about technology, he does know about money.

And crypto to fiat transactions cost somewhere in the range of 0.2-0.5%. Assuming round trip, that's 0.4-1.0% and that doesn't count price volatility during the held period. On top of that, it doesn't count transaction fees for the miners nor all the excess laws, regulations, and tax issues that comes with all of it due to asset conversion.

Many of those costs for crypto scale based on the size of the transaction. For large transactions, crypto is actually more expensive than fiat. Nobody is buying a car with a credit card. They use a check, wire transfer, or physical cash, all of which have fixed fees regardless of size.

Crypto costs more than traditional fiat after approximately $10,000. So that means it's not good for business transactions between free market countries (restricted markets have already or will ban crypto).

For small transactions, crypto's a very big hassle compared to a card.

Also, I agree the fees on cards are too high. If crypto even starts to grow in adoption, the card companies can simply cut their rates to compete and crypto disappears overnight. Remember, adoption has a giant cost to it and cards don't.
Hey I think people should be allowed to destroy their own lives. However, they changed the rules because all those people that went bankrupt bitched and whined that they lost and nobody was "protecting them".

Thanks for your reply. I’m currently out of position.  Wishing I had just stuck with that long.  I was originally in position with you, but had my stops set about $200 higher than yours, So I got stopped out when the price fell into the 8800s and 8900s.  

So now I’m on sidelines, which is ok, but getting bored as well.  
Didn't have in mind opening and keeping it long term :-P More like a scalp stack.
The problems that were mentioned are mostly KYC and how exchanges that currently operate needs to improve that before they will even consider it.  SEC dont have to worry about KYC or people cheating IRS for traders that trade on ARCA.  They are verified to a different level.
I agree with you wholeheartedly. 

In about 4 years of following bitcoin, I've only once ever advised anybody buy it. And that was a close friend who was already interesting in investing, but was just wondering whether I thought $3,500 was a smart entry.

People asked me at $300, $700, $10,000 and $20,000 and every price point in between and my answer was always the same:

"You will almost certainly wind up selling the bottom of the first 50% correction you have the pleasure of witnessing. Take your money elsewhere, or buy $1,000 worth and do everything in your power to forget you have it — without losing access to it."
I agree with everything you said except for the passive statement.  Im almost entirely a passive investors and have advised and helped several people in crypto.  They were all also passive.  We've all made north of 20x at this point.  You can, if you have the right attitude/fortitude, be a passive investor in crypto.  In fact most alts are closer to seed stage investments where you should expect a return timeline of 10 years...  actively trading in these spaces is pretty silly if you take a step back.  But its fun to see it play out anyways.
It absolutely is something you can just passively invest in, Harvey, I bought 33 BTC in 2011 and forgot about them until 2017
I don't disagree with this, but i think it somewhat supports my original point.  Warren Buffett wouldn't be nearly as revered if his response to questions about Bitcoin was along the lines of "you aren't knowledgeable enough to be investing in such a thing", even if it is true.  Buffett's advice is great if you want to have a comfortable retirement and a portfolio that generally only goes up in value, but it's not going to make you wealthy, which is what I think *most* people who look to him for advice are seeking to do.
Even if crypto took over, Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Netflix are still going to be listed on the NASDAQ. They're literally not going anywhere.

In fact, many crypto companies (such as Ripple, the company) would likely have IPO's such as Ripple.
Not even close. Insurance companies can't be replaced by a crypto. They're too heavily regulated and require a lot of first party human labor (actuarials, agents, adjustors, etc.).

Banks could easily benefit from crypto but they'll never be replaced by them because their underlying service is loaning money. Even if you got a company to host wallets and start loaning said coin, that would literally still be a bank. It would just be a crypto bank instead of fiat bank.

You'd likely get the current players to buy out the new startup crypto banks and simply have a crypto bank product offering.
he owns 2.5 billion in goldman sachs, which has more bitcoin than all of us here put together, probably.

> Why there is a stock bubble at companies that do not even pay dividends?

This statement is indicative of how financially illiterate the average crypto buyer is.

Whether a company issues a dividend or not doesn't have much to do with it's financials. It has more to do with how much free cash it has lying around. Did you know that there's nothing fundamentally different from a stock buyback vs dividend? The big difference is how it alters the balance sheet and nothing else.

The primary reason there's a bubble in non-dividend companies is because they're investing the cash in new things and/or buying growth (literally). It doesn't mean they're not worth buying, it just means the company thinks it knows better what to do with it's cashflow than just to give it to shareholders.
That depends. I would argue that BTC is a good hedge against inflation, depending on your national currency. Someone who bought BTC six months ago in Argentina could have done so to hedge their exposure to inflation. That make sense?
Yes of course it is and doesn't change anything.
honeybadger doesn't care about india/china. Deja-vu corrupt governments punishing their populace.
> I get that Ver and the zealotry around Cash can be super annoying, but the tech is pretty fundamentally sound right? 

Uh, no. BCH is a haphazard band-aid solution to a much bigger problem. They're also anti-segwit and schnorr for some strange, unjustifiable reason.

>The mempool was super full and there were crazy fees to send BTC at the end of last year, that is a fact.

Temporarily due to spam and poor use of batching/segwit.

>So the value add is bigger blocks and lower fees.

It will never compete with LN in terms of speed, fees, privacy and scalability. Also, BTC will have bigger blocks when the time is right.

>You can say LTC also has low fees, but that's not solving BTC's problem, it's just dumping it on a different chain with fewer transactions (which you could in theory do indefinitely with various coins/forks).

No, Segwit, Schnorr, LN and a number of other projects are solving the problem. 

>If you say that the cost of running a node is prohibitively expensive because of the extra storage required by bigger blocks (and thus causes more centralization because fewer people can run nodes), then I would again point to the 40$ transaction fees of late last year (which buy you quite a bit of storage).

You're misunderstanding the bottlenecks and points centralization with bigger blocks. It's not just about storage, it's about RAM, processors and block propagation. Beyond that, like I said BTC will have bigger blocks when it's sensible to do so. Most estimates put block size at between 100 and 150 mb for full scale, global LN adoption anyhow. 

>If BTC is meant to be a very secure way for rich people to transfer their wealth then so be it, but I think most would agree that the goal is for it to be usable by all.

Lol, this is such laughable FUD. BTC is so much more than you're making it out to be and BCH is so much less. But to each their own.

I strongly disagree with you, but I upvoted this response because (unlike the other two) it actually is cogent enough to discuss and disagree with. The other two were snarky and trolly.
Can you show me on the blockchain where 80% of BCH is owned by 2-3 individuals. I can't find it. Seems like a lazy answer. 

I totally agree that right now BTC is way more secure than BCH (or anything else) and BCH doesn't have the mining power needed to be as secure, but I'm not going to rule out a black swan event based on my bias towards BTC. I just want crypto in general to win and in the mean time I'll take gambles I feel might increase my overall BTC stack. I'm a BTC maximalist but I won't rule out BCH. 

I mine for future potential, and since BTC is still the majority of my portfolio I'm mining other stuff. I've also been mining XVG even tho it's not always most profitable because I believe it has the most surprise potential. If I was mining for current profit I would have quit long ago. The A3 I bought on a gamble to mine SC however has produced profit beyond what I expected. Throwing free money at gambles with big upside has been working out for the last few years in crypto. 

All crypto is still a risk and thinking that any one of them are definitely here to stay is something I'm just not ready to do. BTC is for sure the short to medium term winner but it's possible that something overthrows the king, even BCH. 

I was such a maximalist on BTC that I missed out on buying ETH at the ICO and the months after where it was $5-$10 and I won't make that mistake again. 

To address the original question I would include BCH in an investment portfolio long before I would include LTC if I had to choose between the two but would include them all if enough funds were available, with BTC being weighted heaviest of course. 
I have a relatively dim view on ETH too (ever since the DAO)...but I think you're taking it slightly too far.

* Centralized? Yeah, sort of. Not overtly, but in the "we set the defaults (which people are free to disagree with and/or route around) but most people are apathetic and go along with it" kind of way. Others have written about this more elegantly, and I find the argument convincing. It goes hand in hand with the whole "cult of Vitalk" thing as well, though to his credit he seems to do his best to discourage that as much as possible.
* Security? I doubt it. I think a thousand ICOs will face the wrath of the SEC, etc. before ETH. Unlike a lot of those ICOs, I think ETH actually fits the profile of a token for functional use within a running network as opposed to investment in a company / HYIP scheme / etc. I also don't think "premine" is the dirty word some make it out to be. ETH premine was actually very fair. Ripple (and others, I'm sure) on the other hand, where a very large percentage is actually premined and locked up by the founders...trash.
* Mutability? I hate that the DAO fork happened. I think ETC exists the same way as BCH exists, as a protest movement and argument for purity. But it's been a while now, and the market clearly disagrees with me and shows that I'm in the minority. If they never do something like that again, it's possible the memories will fade, and immutability can be said in the same sentence as ETH again. Time will tell.

I do think ETH is a legitimate competitor in the crypto space, and will carve its own niche alongside Bitcoin. They have very different aims, and I think both will be successful in their own ways. Right now they're both "suffering" from the same problem, where hype and potential has outrun actual results by an order of magnitude or two. Over time, either price will come down, or use cases will develop and grow (probably both).
Exactly what I meant.

You're going on stops above 9.5 or still developing your view on that move?
Ugh... this is complicated. I don't envy your position of having to navigate so many conflicting demands.

Let's probe the sub a little more about this.
Maybe you can do comments with less than 200 characters they get a PM saying that they need to provide a clear explanation or use a certain comment. Or possibly another solution is you could PM the bot and then the bot appends/updates the position to a top stickied comment and reply to the user with the link that they can include in their comment about the thought process so no positions are posted in comments unless they have a decent explanation but you could see all positions in a top level comment.
If this was done by PM to the bot it should be fine. No spam would be created
Thanks for the explanation. So in general everybody who is trading of Bitmex is in a Bitcoin long position, if he has not a open short position.

>only thing you can do is a 1x leverage short

If I do tihs I cannot provide funding at the same time, or?

New to this Bitmex concept, still not so clear for me how it can work, if there is nothing involved that functions as a Fiat equity that can be transfered back and forth...

it's difficult to effectively deploy that many assets.  If you gave buffett a million bucks he could turn it into 10.

it's not now.  But when it does OTC gets very illiquid.  That's the problem with 'dark markets'.  There's a reason exchanges were invented in the first place.  are the buyers chinese, or middlemen likely buying for chinese?  If so that $$ is likely going to an exchange as collateral for margin to speculate not for storage.


Just trying to help the noob lurkers that may read the threads. Don't want anyone discouraged from learning, ya know?
Again...look back. Every time the sec has made clarifying statements you have been proven wrong. The market reacts positively. This means your stated opinion is based on an objective ignorance about the impact of regulations in this merky market.  I only state what I state because I've watch this at least a dozen times now. Stop trying to push your biased gut opinion and start looking at data. 

Edit: and we'll see. Maybe they go really harsh and this truly hurts crypto, but nothing I've seen to date indicates that. 
I'm glad you brought this up, and it's an important criticism. 

For me the primary reason I'm continuing to hold this trade rather than taking profit and rebuying lower is because I simply can't monitor it 24 hours a day. 

I'd been saying for awhile that there would come a time when spot would move up 10% and June futures would move up 15%. And we more or less saw that exact scenario play out over the weekend. The spot market moved from $9,000 to $9,950 while June futures moved from $9,000 to $10,400. 

I didn't know whether that would happen at 3:00 am my time or 5:00 pm my time. But I knew I wanted to be holding a long before it did happen. 

And futures could still continue to diverge from spot if the market breaks up here and continues towards $10,000 again. 

The last thing I went to do is close my existing position and enter a new one higher. 

So I'm willing to take risk on an open position, because the reward is likely to be magnified.
From a technical standpoint, the "better" location for a stop loss would be around $8,550 or so:

https://imgur.com/a/hZgnC3k

So for this trade, $8,800 is mostly just significant because it's roughly the location of my entry.

However, provided the premium on June futures maintains at ~$200 above spot if/when the market gets down below $9,000, my stop actually won't trigger until $8,550 or so.
It doesn't need to be, it is a feature. Go back 15 years and give people the choice to buy a token to use the internet, privately, without sharing any information w/3rd parties or ad's at all. Or, view the ads, let them use/access your information and get it without the token. Also, maybe token users get a 'fast pass' or a private line outside of email spam line to ensure your emails get read. I don't know, something, something thought experiment. 

Pandora is free, and you get ads and cannot listen to specific songs. Or, you can pay for a fast, ad free, streaming service. So, it happens.

just a shady exchange or a shady "convert to fiat" provider as the fluctions in price make it not useable as payment method. 
BTC is perfect?  that is your position?  OH wait, that is just in your head, oh, ok.  

I read your last line first: " because it will eventually expose their funny money for the massive fraud that it is." And I really thought you were making the case for BTC as a ponzi/fraud.  It actually works better that way.     
The analogy I like to use is TA is effectively like counting cards in blackjack. 

It can tell you when the deck is stacked in your favor, but that doesn't mean you're guaranteed to pull a face card if you decide to double down on 11.
I don't think people are legitimately scared of crypto sidestepping the criminal enforcement failsafes we have in the modern banking systems. I think the transparency and accountability that can and probably will at some point come to the financial systems thanks to blockchain tech is far more scary to them. 
Disagreement is welcome. There's plenty of bears/skeptics here that actually have some kind of analysis or reasoning for why they think BTC won't work in the end. Even though most here disagree with them, their arguments are at least somewhat rooted in reality.

Literally all you did was compare block chain technology to a vacuum cleaner trying to be a sex robot and you're *surprised* I'm telling you that's irrational, off base, and unneeded here? Are you 10 years old?

It's the amount of coins currently held in long / short positions. 30489 longs means there is a total of 30489 coins bought on margin, for all we know that could be one single big margin position, or 300k positions sized 0.1 BTC each, or anything in between; likewise for shorts.

I do trade bitcoin a little to try to increase my stack. I hodl a lot too. Not blind faith. I have put in countless hours reading and listening to smarter people than I explain blockchain and bitcoin and have come to a firm conclusion that it is a much needed technology for the world.   So when I see people shitting on it for dubious reasons it gets me fired up. 

Once the wallets and exchanges become easier to use and better marketed to the general population you will see this mofo soar. 
can't see that propelling us to new ridiculous heights, though. 

Here's my thinking: people entered on promises of great riches. What happens when those great riches don't come or stop coming? They get out, it snowballs, bear market. That's the cycle of these bubbles from what I've seen. The buying  accelerates until the expectations exceed reality by so much that it crumpled under its own weight. I can see this happening on a longer term time frame even already.

This space isn't fill of patient people, otherwise they'd be in index funds. It's full of impatient people who will get out quickly 
I agree entirely- I'm not saying news will never be bullish or justifiably prop the price up. I'm saying  that right now news won't matter because the price we're at isn't really based on news- the actual real world usage. It's based on the perception of news- how it *should* affect the price. 

If/when BTC is actually used for its intended purpose it will *naturally* grow in price. It will be a direct effect of widespread adoption- there's simply no mathematical way it wouldn't
Nobody actually suggested LN would be mainstream this year. Maybe you surround yourself with low information moon kids or something 
Probably the same guy who was buying 5 btc every 30 seconds on GDAX with his bot...God damn, shit was so ridiculous. I mean even if he did it for half the day, that's literally around the 24h volume of Gdax now lmao (~7200)
I have used it and I will probably always hold a little barring major news events or regulations that deem it worthless. 

I wish I could use it more and I wish it was more about actual usage than anything else. 

There have been several times I've wanted to send money to someone in another country and I couldn't because they don't have a PayPal or they don't have a bank account set up for a PayPal. I've actually thought to myself- this is a perfect use case.

But then I realized due to KYC and AML laws that this is just as, if not more difficult than simply using fiat. 

I mean...if they're going to end up converting their bitcoin to fiat anyway then using bitcoin is literally just a waste of time. 

So until  bitcoin sees widespread adoption there's virtually no reason to use it over a simpler payment system 
we went like 700 to 900 in a day or two which was huge at the time. then 900 to 1200, and 1350 back to 700. the 15 minute candle of decision time was pretty gnarly from what i remember of those times. tbh i sold everything for eth the day before, then switched back to bitcoin when the ratio had about tripled

No those were issues the DoJ had. The SEC had issues with manipulation and extremely volatile markets.
You're literally describing an active investor.

A passive investor is someone who buys something and never looks at it again until he's ready to take his money out of the account 5 years or more later.

Guarantee you're looking at your portfolio often.

Your statement shows the clear lack of financial literacy in this space. You don't even understand the basic terms.
And you got *lucky*. Congratulations you won!

Don't conflate good investing with getting lucky. I'm a pretty darned good trader but I'm the first one to admit that I got luck as balls last year when the price exploded to 20k. I was expecting the year to close out around 5k, *maybe 6k*. I thought 20k was at least a year or two away.

Nobody here is willing to admit they got lucky and it makes them all shittier traders/investors because of it.
Investing isn't how you get rich. Working lots of extra hours, living frugally, and investing in yourself.

*That* is how you move up the socio-economic ladder. Those who can get wealthy off just the stock market are either already wealthy, breaking the law, or are the one in a million trader. The rest just lose their shirt.
Yeah, I agree without the benefit of hindsight a more conservative approach then the "YOLO all in crypto" portfolio is best for most people. But again if bitcoin takes over... hindsight will be a real bitch for certain bruised investor egos.
You're right, insurance companies and banks will not be replaced, but their business will be transformed. It is precisely because these industries are so heavily regulated that crypto-based competitors represent a significant threat to them. The legacy players will have trouble keeping up with the nimbler competition.

Banks and insurance companies will still be a part of economic life, but the industries themselves have the potential to see significant disruption of incumbents.
You might be surprised. I guess we'll have more of an idea of GS's position when they open their trading desk.
You are the average cryptobuyer?
Makes sense, but it’s still not a hedge.

Hedging is when you buy derivatives on an underlying to achieve a risk neutral portfolio valuation
Actually, it does care about 3 billion people.  But we can agree to disagree about that.
Yo thanks for the detailed response.  To be clear - I don't have any sort of allegiance to either side, I responded because what you said seemed to be different than my understanding of the situation (that Cash has zero value to anyone).

I would argue there is no right or wrong answer, only tradeoffs, and personal opinions about which tradeoffs are best.

My take is that Cash makes some tradeoffs for things like simplicity, lack of Blockstream influence, and an immediate (albeit debatably flawed) solution to on-chain scaling.
I've gotta say, the amount of anger and vitriol on both sides is pretty unfortunate. It makes it hard to have a discussion of any kind. I've seen the pettiness and name calling though, so I'm not saying it's not understandable, I just think it's a bummer.

I guess I don't see Cash as malicious and intentionally evil as you do, I see it as a potentially overly simplistic solution to a pretty complicated problem. I'm not sure calling programming ability into question is really valid here either, since what I'm referring to as Bitcoin Cash is just pre Segwit with a higher block size. I'm not trying to pander to "Satoshi's Vision", but saying it's not designed by programmers seems patently false, considering it's how Bitcoin was originally designed (even if it is flawed).

Moved my stops to breakeven. But since the premium dropped from about $200 to about $60, my stops won't got until around $9550 on spot unless the premium climbs again. 
This restrictions i believe should be decided my the mod team. They are the ones handling all the extra work created by the bot.
There are some limitations on the number of sticky posts to a thread but it's something i have little knowledge of.
Someone else should correct me if I'm wrong, but as far as I remember Bitmex doesn't have a funding feature specifically. Funding is 'socialized' in such a way that if there is an imbalance of longs / shorts, the more crowded side pays the less populated side for funding, and if it was a perfect 50/50 balance there would be no funding fees at all (I think that's how it works anyway, I may be wrong).

absolutely bud, I try to write my responses with lurkers in mind too
So when did we have any 'clarifying statements' from SEC that were anti-crypto / anti-altcoin and led to altcoin dumps while seeing Bitcoin climb at the same time?
Good stuff, thanks for explaining.
  The fact that bill gates is talking about it at all, and he's afraid - means this isn't just a bubble.  The neckbeards were right all along, lol.  So him and buffet and munge talking about it from a financial perspective was all just bullsh*t.  They're spewing govt propaganda cloaked as financial advice.  So... go long?

From a societal perspective, I agree with them though.  But ignoring reality isn't going to help things.  Genie's out of the bottle.  Criminals will use whatever technology they can.








OK, seriously, how do you not understand that analogy?  I worked all night on that one!  /s

BTC is a great idea, it is not well realized.  I believe it will be.  I think some crypto will be the new world currency, but none are now.

Robot wives are a great idea, but not well realized.  I used a poor example to show the correlation to the poor excuse for a world currency BTC is right now.  That does not mean that I think it won't end up there, we are just so far from there that I needed an extreme example.  I stand by my analogy, and I'm not 10!  You are! /s
HAHA i stand corrected.  wow.

whats the goal then.. milk the public as much as they can i guess.  Still if they were pro-crime I'm sure they could sell drugs themselves.
I guess some would argue big pharma does that.  I dont know.. I think they have a genuine interest to maintain a healthy and productive society it benefits them just as much as us.

The dreaming is convenient. One can feel the lambos and at the same time sit at the mamahotel or something like that.

I think dreaming about personal gains is toxic: the less anyone wants, the further he gets and money is just a byproduct.

I never felt I want anything and that was a blessing. Because retroactively I see I was in big shithole with everything (having no money was just a symptom and not a reason that I was in the shithole as it is for everyone; yet Roger shows us all that having money still does not mean that the person is out of shit) and it was important to move out of it. So I tried. Part of it was moving to another continent, where is clean sheet, no known people, actually everything was new and crazy.

Tbh in that shit is almost everybody. I do not know clearly, because I really do not have normal friends. But I am convinced everyone needs a brutal restart. Old hodlers can afford it, so they should really do it. This world is becoming our world now, we should do better than WB or Gates. Just being dreamers is not enough.

My important employee just bought a motorbike and goes to India alone while working. Things like that make me happy. Those are the things (stepping out of ordinary) everyone has to do, even when it is inconvenient. It has infinitely more value than to grind here few grands.

Marketing is a dream machine. It creates and manages our dreams. We follow then those dreams. Online marketing brought it to the new level. Crypto is part of that world more and more.
sloppy, you're fun to talk to but I think we just fundamentally disagree on what people expect or were promised. 
Everything happening right now is just daytrading and gambling.  The price of bitcoin has far outrun it's real value which is 2-3k.  Once the mania runs off, the price will collapse.

Not sure who you think you're contradicting with this assertion.
Oh man, [I remember](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/7dqiu2/daily_discussion_saturday_november_18_2017/dpzroll/)!

> Just dropping by to mention that *someone on GDAX is buying 5 BTC every minute*. *Five* Bitcoin. Every *minute*. Seriously, go look.

> I was wondering why the hell it had such a high premium the past few hours. That likely explains it.

> Also, it wasn't a "whale defending $7,500 on GDAX," I don't know why some here think it was. Those were organic orders piled up at a very round number over the past week, with not enough sell pressure to break through it.
Sloppy. Dude. Let's say that in the future, money is sent around the world in BTC and then converted to some perverted token, like FedCoin. That is the fiat on/off ramp for my jurisdiction that I use for day to day. Same as today, right?

Except, in this future, enough of us have decreed that FedCoin is denominated in its BTC value, not USD value (like all other countries do). Why? Because enough of use have decided that we would like to use BTC to send money more efficiently (no ACH), more effectively (to ANY website I want, not those deemed 'legal' by my bank) and more quickly (LN, godspeed). 

Yes, limited supply does cause some issues, but would it be that surprising in 10 years that a digital asset is the global peg (new gold) for all other state  currencies, digital or physical? Why, because if my FedCoin starts to lose value due to the Fed, or irresponsible government spending, I shed my FedCoin and move to BTC, which I can convert globally.

Its not that far of a stretch. What are the odds? I dunno, but I know the only way for me to send money somewhere this weekend was BTC, because A) it was the weekend and B) about 30% of the global economy is gray. And no, I don't mean drugs, I mean gray, like how I pay my house cleaners or the farmers market down the road.
There is no simpler payment system. Sorry. Even PayPal (which is a total ripoff).

I think you are being disingenuous.  If there were a way to prove it, I would be willing to bet that you've never used Bitcoin and would lay even odds that you don't even have any.
Those were the words of traders and brokers that were around at the time.

Believe it or not, in the finance world, rules aren't really written until the masses get hurt. As long as everyone is making money, nobody wants to get voted out of office for writing in a new law or regulation that will stop everyone from making money.
You have an odd definition then. 10 year hold is not typically considered active investor. 
again, not disagreeing (since obviously there has to be a productive society to invest in), just stating where the potential disconnect is between Warren Buffett and the masses.
It's been a decade and everyone is literally still using the term "if it takes over" not "when it takes over".

How many decades do you need before you'll concede it's not taking over?
If you want to get technical, perhaps you should read this article which explains the different ways one can hedge:

>lack of Blockstream influence,

BCH is using a lot of code written by Blockstream employees. I don't understand the hate for Blockstream at all. Do people really believe the conspiracy theories about working on behalf of the banks? There's really very little evidence in favor of any accusations leveled at Adam and the company, yet BCashers talk non-stop about sockpuppets, the Bilderberg group and other wildly speculative conspiracy theories like they're fact. Bitcoin is open source. Blockstream doesn't control it. Core doesn't control it. The code and implementation is right out there in the open. I just can't understand why people call foul on Blockstream. They're some of the most talented and hard working people in the space. 

>Yo thanks for the detailed response. To be clear - I don't have any sort of allegiance to either side, I responded because what you said seemed to be different than my understanding of the situation (that Cash has zero value to anyone).

My point is that BCash doesn't have any intrinsic value because its use cases are all performed better by other projects, mostly Bitcoin. 

>My take is that Cash makes some tradeoffs for things like simplicity, lack of Blockstream influence, and an immediate (albeit debatably flawed) solution to on-chain scaling.

I wouldn't call enabling OP codes and raising the block limit arbitrarily and carelessly *simple*. I don't feel like getting into a big debate but the bottom line is that scaling like BCH is scaling is just dumb. It's poor design and undoubtedly causes bottleneck issues. It's highly inefficiently and bound to become centralized. Blocksizes would have to be massive to *really* scale. BTC is taking the smart approach. Efficient design and abstracted layers. Any serious developer is going to agree that BTC has the more elegant and efficient set of design principles. LN is already up and running. I can't really see how BCH isn't already a dead man walking.

Yeah, I definitely agree with you on the "personalities" front. Unfortunately, 2016/2017 was the period that my respect for pretty much everyone in Bitcoin (sure, many on the BCH side, but also on the Core side as well) went down a few notches. I think Antonopolous was one of the few that got through that time relatively unscathed (though even he raised an eyebrow for me at times)...everyone else either repeatedly made a fool of themselves or turned into a monster / caricature of their former selves. Pretty sad, really.
Been a while since we agreed so much on one trade ;-)
Just curious.

If you end up in bad trade. F.ex. lose 30% trading stack. Do you fill up to 10% of your child storage or wait how next trades will end up until you decide to fill up in case you have to hedge?
I was just thinking if everyone were to pm the bot the position then the bot can place the position wherever it makes sense the most. So the bot could post a TL comment just reminding people of the syntax and to PM the bot the position. The bot replies VIA PM to a link to where it is being recorded and then creates a post under it's own TL comment (maybe one for each user that day)

EDIT: So your basically standardizing the placement because the the bot only accepts positions via PM and the bot updates the correct comment.

They havent had any clarifying anti-crypto statements except the times they said they are securities etc.  Not that I think thats anti-crypto but some have thought that.  Thats a huge part of my point... evidence doesnt support your FUD approach to this.
Look, maybe I misunderstood you from the get go. It seemed you were likening Bitcoin to a vacuum cleaner trying to be a sexbot. That's, imo, a completely off base comparison. A vacuum cleaner is realistically *never* going to be a sexbot. Bitcoin has the *possiblity* to become a world currency. A vacuum cleaner can't even function as a sexbot (...this is an awkward analogy but I'll go with it). Bitcoin *can* and currently *does* function as a currency. If you have someone willing to accept it (and they ARE out there) you can securely pay with it. 

Your analogy would be more apt if digital currency hadn't yet solved the problem of timestamps, double spending, and secure/independent transaction verification, because then Bitcoin truly would be a vacuum playing at being a sex robot. Thankfully, the BTC white paper lays out the solutions to all of that: blockchain. On the spectrum of sexbot to vacuum cleaner, it's much closer to sexbot.

Somewhat digressing for the rest of the post.

Sure, crypto has obstacles. When too many people use it, it gets slow and expensive. Hell it's slow compared to Visa and shit even when it isn't under heavy load. And there's adoption/usability issues, as you have to somehow convince the public that it's benefits are real and not imaginary while also making it just as easy to use as current solutions. There's certainly regulatory affairs standing in the way as well. 

But none of those issues compare to trying to make a vacuum cleaner into a Westworld sexbot lmao, and Bitcoin/blockchain is starting to make strides in people at least *knowing* what it is. That's at least moving the right direction towards getting people to use it. Plus there's plenty of theory surrounding scaling solutions as well coming in various blockchain flavors.

And this is all a complete non sequitor to my original point that information *does* have value. In that respect, Bitcoin as it's intended to be is not a "greatest fool" investment - if it works out, it *does* in fact have value because the information it carries has value. Even currently it has value. Not the value it would have if it makes a world currency, but it sure as hell has value. 

Obviously long term it's anything but a sure thing, but that's why it has so much potential to make people a lot of money. Investing is essentially a vehicle to take on risk and profit if that risk pays off. Crypto very clearly embodies that.
The goal sometimes is $$$$ and profits and power and not to stop crime.  At other times, the goal is to stop crime.

Haha yeah. I don't mind just saying agree to disagree.  Keep in mind I don't necessarily think you're wrong or that I'm 100% right. It's simply my guess as to what is most likely to happen. I fully admit that there is a great chance of me being wrong 
Yeah I agree. Shit got stupid after $3k and most people will freely admit that
Yes, ideally it will be used like that. If it were being used like that right now I see no reason why it wouldn't be worth $100-1000k. 

Except there are real issues with getting there- 

Government regulations, defenders of the existing financial system, network size, extreme price volatility, early adopters turned large actors/manipulators, and scaling issues. 

the largest, most real issue is the scaling issue. If you claim it doesn't need to scale to be a currency because it's a SoV then you have to solve the volatility issue. Neither of these issues are getting better- they're almost getting worse over time. 

Until they are fixed, I am skeptical of widespread usage. If that happens, I'm definitely on board
I think he's leaving speculation aside and just relaying his experience. I held BTC since the first bubble in 2011 and the only thing I spent it on was SR and one or two BTC related things such as a trezor and nano s. It's not particularly more effective than the systems he mentions (except paypal) for for his purposes I expect. He's just saying that there's so much speculation here at the moment there seems to be very little discussion on the tech which is short sighted investing. When we were pushing 10K the top 3 posts of/r/bitcoin was prepare your 10K memes.

You gotta admit the scene has changed an awful lot compared to if you where around pre 2014/15/16/17.It's much less about creating a censorship resistant transaction system and more about fundraising for the next (probably useless token) even though ALT where around by 2013. It's not exactly a good look for crypto in general IMO and the community seems to have have gone from one form of printing a finite supply of money/units to creating multiple copies of the code with some remakes(essentially creating coins with huge marketcaps because they sell a few coins for a few bucks and create a million of them that are owned by a special group). It' been strange to watch. 2013 everyone was aligned between bitcoin and now people who missed out have organized into their own coins essentially fragmenting a community that should be working together (divide and conquer anyway)

And also the words of traders and brokers that were around at the time is what I said.

And rules are written before the masses get hurt and in many other situations.
Active investor vs passive investor has nothing to do with how long you hold an asset. That's long vs medium term investor.

Angel investors usually buy for 5-10 years but they're most certainly considered active investors.

Active vs passive describes whether you follow your investment and/or participate as an investor (to the extent an investor is allowed to participate). So if you're checking your portfolio often, then you're most certainly an active investor.
Uhhhh, bitcoin has produced on average ludicrous annual returns since its inception. How much faster do you want it to grow?

  
hmmmm, interesting. I guess I meant the “classical” defininition of hedging
Wow aren't you a true believer. Screw adoption and tech, as long as the speculative value goes up to some random round number. 
> I don't understand the hate for Blockstream at all. Do people really believe the conspiracy theories about working on behalf of the banks?

The conspiracy theories are complete trash. That said, Blockstream and Core at large basically broke my heart (to paraphrase Coinbase's CEO) last year; I used to love Bitcoin, but while I'm still positive about it, my feelings about it will never be the same post BCH split and post S2X shutdown. They are an incredibly talented bunch, but their intelligence and coding / cryptography abilities are eclipsed by their arrogance, hubris, and severe blind spots in other areas (economics, usability, game theory, etc.).

Yes, I know Core is comprised of individuals (and some are pretty cool and interesting people) but they are not equal in influence. Good luck getting something into Core if you don't convince Greg, Adam, Peter, Pieter, etc. and good luck having a civilized discussion in general if you don't accept certain tenets of their core (pun intended) position a priori. I've read the dev mailing lists and saw how intelligent, non-troll/non-shill people got pretty ruthlessly shut down for so much as suggesting compromise, bigger blocks, alternate scaling proposals, etc. They get run out of town just like Gavin, Peter R., and others did.

Instead of compromising and listening to the community, they doubled down on their position and ostracized anyone who disagreed. This split the community in two and caused what I see as irreparable damage to both the community and general ecosystem. I still think S2X^1 was the best path forward; had Core not belittled and dismissed it and instead given their support, we could have had Segwit, slightly bigger blocks, *and most importantly a (more) unified community*. I don't particularly like BCH (and actually wish the fork never happened), but I understand why it exists. Shills/trolls and misinformed mouth-breathers aside, it is a protest movement and permanent thorn in the side of Core, driven by those who feel like they got screwed over (and there are many who feel that way).

1: Ironically, many people who correctly dismiss the AXA/Blockstream conspiracies as nonsense seem to readily believe S2X was some nefarious corporate takeover plot, or something equally ridiculous.

As soon as I close a position, I either withdraw btc from my bitmex account and move it to cold storage (if it's a profitable trade) or move btc from my cold storage to bring my bitmex trading balance back to 10% of my cold storage (if it's an unprofitable trade). 

For example, let's say I had 100 btc in cold storage and 10 in my bitmex account. I make a trade that doubles my trading balance to 20. I'd withdraw ~9 btc from Bitmex and move them to cold storage, leaving me with ~11 btc on Mex and 109 in cold storage. 

If I lost 30% of my bitmex balance instead and dropped from 10 to 7, I'd move ~2.5 btc from my cold storage to Mex to leave me with 9.5 btc on Mex and 97.5 btc in cold storage.

What FUD approach? Are you sure you are replying to the same things that I'm typing?

All I'm saying is that IF the SEC statement is negative to any significant portion of the market, then Bitcoin would also be affected. I never said I think it will be negative, or things would dump hard in reaction to whatever SEC might say, or anything of the sort. I'm just saying that Bitcoin isn't in some sort of an impenetrable bubble, and it DOES react to any significant fundamental market news whether things are 'aimed directly at Bitcoin' or not. 
Wow, you are a patient and compassionate person, and thanks for indulging my clapbot of analogies, but thanks for hanging in there. 

 I truly want bitcoin to be the one.  And it really isn't "about" money for me (though I am in the pro-money camp).  It is about power to me, and I hate seeing Wall Street sharks circling all of this chum...the Whales are bad enough! (sry-can't help it, full of bad analogies)

I must agree on the value, if anyone does not they may give me their coins!  I'm someone that got all excited in August, then waited while I researched...then mentally kept flipping from "the greatest investment ever/worst ever" because all of the info I was seeing was so binary. 

I missed out on several hundred thousand dollars because the exchanges were not trustworthy, and I was not able to tolerate the risk of another Mt. Gox.  And after I heard about accounts being frozen at inopportune times on coinbase, my risk assessment saw too many red flags.  

I don't trust Wall Street, so getting me to trust crypto is a hard sell-yet I was still willing to invest.  That is my very personal definition of a bubble- I was FOMO'ing at the mouth!  

To this day I am doing what many here and elsewhere are doing: trying to find information that backs up my position.  We can't help ourselves, we are only human, after all.  

But I am here to learn, so I will have to fight that part of my ego that "needs to be right."  So that I may actually learn from people (like you) that actually are here to spread useful, relevant information, and for that I thank you.  
bleh.  it's all inscrutable.  It's as you said everyone has an agenda now.  Only way to get useful info is to do your own research.   news news everywhere, but not a drop to drink.

Fair enough, you are a reasonable skeptic, I am too. I mean BTC makes up only a very small % of my portfolio, but its the % that I want most to succeed. 

The hurdles you list are all valid. Government regulations (they must still find a way to tax). Existing financial system (yes, but brick and mortar were conquered by the internet). Extreme price volatility (will go away with non-speculative adoption). Early adopters/price manipulators (they will eventually sell out for FedCoin, people did trade oil producing land for cash that depreciates, after all). Scaling (yes, the biggest hurdle, but I will take a small bet that someday, someone really brilliant, figures this out).

Its all good man, best of luck and your opinions are always well thought out and appreciated. 
This is a very fair criticism. Open up even the best intentioned markets and you invite greed. 

The only thing I can say is that other manias around sound assets have occurred in the past, gold, oil, etc. There will always be players without the best intentions, but the value is not wiped out because of their presence. 
Yeah, I don't care about shitcoins.  Only a couple of them will survive.

It has changed, but we're a lot closer to a censorship-resistant, scumbag-banker-free money system than we were just a few years ago.  And, hey, the people who get rich because they saw this coming deserve to be rich, unlike hucksters like Warren Buffett who became rich by giving himself shares in a glorified mutual fund that he then sold to his daddy's rich friends.  Berkshire Hathaway is a scam.  It underperforms most mutual funds.  Let's create a money system with REAL, verifiable, earned money that rewards the creation of REAL, verifiable, earned value.  We're getting there.
Wow - you're financially illiterate AND an asshole.

https://www.investopedia.com/news/active-vs-passive-investing/

First fucking line:  "If you’re a passive investor, you invest for the long haul. Passive investors limit the amount of buying and selling within their portfolios, making this a very cost-effective way to invest."

>Angel investors usually buy for 5-10 years but they're most certainly considered active investors.

Totally fucking wrong.  They are only considered 'active' if they participate in running the company - such as board seats - which a vast majority of Angels do not get.

>So if you're checking your portfolio often, then you're most certainly an active investor.

Thats just a stupid statement.  But even more ironically - it supports my statement that a long term buy and holder is NOT by YOUR definition an active investor.

This satire? This sounds exactly like the current ICO situations. Bitcoin not so much but you can definitely see a side of bitcoiners come out since we hit 20K that a lot of them think they are superior to other people because they invested in bitcoin. Check out powers law that describes why a tiny percentages tend to dominate specific areas.

The funny thing is a lot of people think that as long as it's them that are in the 1% that they will definitely only do good and won't become one of the evil 1% ers. That may be true to some, but not the majority. I would say that the crypto community is about as scammy as any traditional banking service(okay maybe not to that extreme). There's a shit ton of dodgy practices in this area and way too many scams...
Look at the advantages/disadvantages at the bottom of that page. All of what you talked about falls under the active investor characteristics.

> Passive investors limit the amount of buying and selling within their portfolios, making this a very cost-effective way to invest.

No that's the difference between a trader and investor.

Passive investing is mostly about indexing. I doubt your indexing. I'm also sure you're trying to beat the market.

Also, if you're going to try and use Investopedia, use an article by *Investopedia* not a financial adviser posting to Investopedia. Most financial advisers are absolute idiots.
Price of one share of Tesla on 07/26/2010: 20.95 USD

Price of one share of Tesla today: 304.92 USD

Price of one bitcoin on 07/26/2010: 0.05 USD

Price of one bitcoin today: 9,368.51 (BTC) + 1,629.82 (BCH) + other forks

There is almost no comparison with bitcoin so far for bitcoin's short life.

There was a pretty massive ninja edit, too. I responded to 

> hype is very well funded. That's the entire POINT of hype. You are supporting my initial argument 'AI is overhyped'.

And then came back to find a wall of text that I'm unwilling to touch. This isn't' a productive conversation.

Huh, bot didn't seem to lower my ca on there.

Well, if you had invested in something that returned 20x what "genius investor" Buffett's investment in Apple returned over the same time, you'd probably be feeling pretty good too.  The proof's in the puddin', pal, and we Bitcoiners have a pretty good track record of being right.  Most of us have been in since way before that little anomalous spike in December and have seen these spikes before. (ATHs like that tend to look small in the rearview mirror, as huge as they seem at the time) 

I will be good when I'm the .1 percent.  Promise.
Indexes are not the only form of passive investing.  There are lots of examples like the below out there so my guess is that either the terminology has taken on broader use - which explains the way I see it used in the Angel and VC world Im in.   Or perhaps you have a narrow use case you're used to dealing with and only know that situation.  Either way... this is a stupid argument on semantics.

Price growth doesn't indicate adoption of the underlying product. It indicates purchase of the security asset.

Ford sells more cars in a day than Tesla sells in a year and yet Tesla has a higher market cap.
I warned you about behavior that violates rule one. This also violates rule 1. You've libeled my words and actions.

I never threatened to ban you. I gave you a warning about bad behavior. This is your second warning.
You're clearly trolling. Consider this a warning about rule 1.

I held through 2011 as well but you gotta admit the fact that it's happened time and time again has created a community that expects it to happen and projects it onto the newer people in the space. Not saying that it won't happen again either but the ratio of those who care about the tech and those who are just in it for the gains is slowly going in favor of the gains which hopefully wont affect the tech
it got a little out of hand.  Sorry brother.  I wasn't trolling for the record, those are my beliefs on AI.  But as I said, this is a forum for bitcoin markets not AI opinions, so either way - I was out of line.



Yeah, the tech is the thing I really care about.  The people who "get it" are those of us who are excited about the prospect of superior form of money that not only keeps better track of wealth but cuts off the big parasites of the economy who do nothing but print money for themselves. Once you understand the technological superiority, you see Bitcoin's inevitable domination.
We're good. Thanks for the apology.
