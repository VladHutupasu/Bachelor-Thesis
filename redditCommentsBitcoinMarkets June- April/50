look at 1h fiat volume from even october to now....that 1h candle was just retarded.
So apparently there’s an whale accumulation chart going around, anyone have any insight on this? Just curious 
Closed my short at $8,080 for a small loss. 

For lack of a better word: this is stupid. 
Ok, been gone 20ish hours...so, BGD is the new acronym for the “big green dildo” from the other day?  Got it.  I was getting really confused going through the thread.  
Man, everytime I see longs go up to that 30% level, I go on fetal position.

I think this bear run traumatized me pretty bad.
Is it just me or do most of the "TA" guys see what THEY want to see on their charts? 
Damn judging by the sentiment in here, still seems like there is a lot of underwater shorts
Let me break down the daily discussion for the last 3 days for everyone with 2 opinions.

1. This is a bull trap and we're going to 4k
2. This is the start of a bull run to 12k

Figure it out for yourself what you think is going to happen based on your analysis.  
Speculation: This feels like the widespread disbelief during the beginning of a true recovery.
Good morning everybody. I took no position during the night as I exhausted myself yesterday from overtrading. I wanted to see the confirmation that we are in a parallel channel (like the one chewy draw but a bit larger).

https://www.tradingview.com/x/1kd9a1CT/

This channel is cut in the middle by the old support-turned-resistance log line (in red). The higher lows we've been making suggest that we are in a bullish ascending triangle. I will personally wait for a return to the lower trend line of the ascending triangle to open a long that I intend to keep until we meet the 19k downtrend log line. However I don't think I'll short the upper lines of this formation, I learned my lesson yesterday, shorting in a (short-term) bullish setting is really stressful. 

Have a nice day!
Anyone else sometimes get the thought how a crypto trading pit would be ? I have watched some older trading movies from the 80s lately, and being a futures trader in Chicago or singapore just seem so much fun. Then imagine with like 500 different crypto market, everyone is like a 30 year old male with strong tribalism toward his own coins/holdings and not so good control over their emotions

I would pay to watch the livestream of that. If a statement from Alan Greenspan could create chaos on the Forex floors, just think of the constant tweets from Roger Ver, Vitalik and so on and the craziness that would errupt on those big ticker 8k screens

This is what I imagine https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PUwr8DsYeg , look from 5.20. "MOves that takes months takes weeks, everyone want to sell at the same time" :D

Anyone who's stared at the chart since April 6 and is now making straight-faced pronouncements about bear and bull flags has missed what's going on here. I say this as someone who has happily used them in the recent past.

That's not to say that all TA has been invalidated or that I personally want to go on record right now about which way we're headed, but if you decide to be a forensic scientist and treat the chart like a crime scene, and you go back and look at the general pattern from the 6th forward as well as a more detailed look at all the candles with any sizable volume, I sincerely believe you will have a better understanding of this thing than if you spend your time finding flags.
If there was a gdax chat it would all be filled with "beep boop"
If it is believed to be manipulated one direction, then it most assuredly was manipulated in the other direction as well.  Or is there only manipulation when one is on the wrong side of the manipulator's moves? But when your trading is aligned with the 'manipulator', your gains are *clearly* the result of your own due diligence and astute analysis, right? Read: check your confirmation bias at the door.
Analysis for the day: https://www.tradingview.com/i/KhDrWOVH/

Today, I'm looking at a daily time frame to maintain perspective.

The two lines I have drawn are the support line from the september crash -> 6k crash that we seem to break going back down into the 6ks, and the support turned resistance we're currently dealing with around 8.1-8.2k. This throwback to confirm support turned resistance can happen a lot, falling back off would be bad. The second line is the ATH resistance on the log scale. It sits just above the log support currently. Everyone is probably familiar with these lines already. 

So, is it going to fail here? Possibly, maybe even probably. I personally think there could still be some minor upward movement over the next few days before it actually does definitively though.

1: Stoch RSI. Notice every time we've had a large fall off stoch RSI has crossed in the overbought reason (purple arrows). It looks like it could possibly cross again in a few days.

2: Daily BBands. Notice every time we turned around in the golden highlights. In each of those times, we wicked or came very close to the top daily BBand... which we've done today and the past daily candle.

3: RSI. A turn around here, though it would be lagging, would generate a large hidden bearish divergence with the 9k high. A turn around at ATH resistance would possibly give a hidden bear div with the 11.8k as well.

These indicators all make a strong case for bearish continuance or bull reversal since they could likely all confirm or be invalidated at the same time. If market conditions don't change too drastically in the next week (which they very well could - not taking this to the bank), when the log support crosses the ATH resistance (~4/20 at 8500ish) we could be in a situation where we're simultaneously trying to reclaim log support, break ATH resistance, pierce the daily BBand, and avoid the stoch RSI crossing. All those invalidating or confirming as they have this entire bear would be a very strong signal to me.

It's also worth mentioning that mixed signals could result - say we pierce the log support and daily BBands but then fail at ATH resistance, crossing the stoch RSI and forming a large hidden bear div. I don't know if that's particularly likely, but would certainly be somewhat confusing. Just saying there's obviously plenty of ways these indicators could resolve themselves.

Not pictured, but worth mentioning the bull flag on 4hr and 1hr charts. It slants up which is kinda odd but will be watching that as well. I'm still bought in waiting for anything I've mentioned here to resolve itself.

Bearish continuance could mean a possible retest of the bottom log support at ~6.6k or maybe just a technical drop to mid-low 7ks before truly going back to create a market reversal.

UPDATE: Stoch RSI is currently crossing on this new daily candle but there's a lot of day left. Given that we've already wicked the daily bband and that log support area, we could be headed back down. Waiting to see some real downward movement for taking action on it and selling though.
More nice rounded bottoms on every time frame than on a whole season of Keeping Up With the Kardashians.  Bullish.
Love all you fuck faces! Bearish, bullish whatever.   You're all smart enough to realize a new asset class/paradigm shift and it will happen.   Cypto will take over and all of us right now reading this will be rich AF no doubt, Vegas meeting?.    RemindMe! 2 years. #drunkbuttrueramblings.
Entered short @8128 yesterday. Ended up getting chopped out and re-entering later @8131. Target hit overnight but i didnt catch it.

Exitted manually @7980. Made quite a nice bit despite the chop, fees, missing target and exiting early.

Eventhough i came out on top, waaaaay too sloppy. need to step back from all this, tighten everything up. better do it now while there's little movement
Just curious, is anyone opening a position here or already have one open? Usually there's a pretty one sided bias in the dailies but no one seems sure of anything now.
Has anyone seen a data set that aggregates liquidations and compares them against overall volume for the candle time-frames during which they occurred?

If no, is there a good source for the liquidation data? I may take a look at pulling this together.
Slow day for BTC, not much volume. I think many are waiting for some confirmation where are we moving next, set some alarms/limits and go enjoy your Saturday, no need to stare at these sideways charts.
My "low fishing" order on June futures at  7911 hit, reasoning is that there was some pushback earlier today but it got bought up quickly. I think another try to 8200 levels is possible, otherwise I just get stopped out right below this entry.

Also my trusted 15m ma cross over turned to the upside now, so I think a move here could happen

[deleted]
Longs are increasing with this dip, 30k to a relatively static 24.7k shorts... not as outsized a ratio as we had with the short squeeze but could be setting up for a lesser long squeeze if this wedge breaks down
I closed my short position (8160) last night before bed. I took 15% profits on it at 7825, and ended up closing the whole position around 7920, mostly so I could sleep. I layered in adds for a new position from 8080-8320, two of which executed. I'm CA @ 8120. However...

I'm a little concerned when I zoom out. We've got a massive bull pennant painting off the BGD: https://www.tradingview.com/x/ARjvyRWq/  

There have been some bearish moves in the last 24 hours here, but still fully operating within the pennant: https://www.tradingview.com/x/aEHti3sr/  

I am removing my highest add and dropping the other add to 8130, since my position is smaller than usual. I will be looking to bail over 8320 or so. We should have a clear resolution to this pennant by late Sunday, and the break direction should be catalyzed by Monday morning price action. 

Good luck all.


I swear to god that im getting tired of people screaming manipulation . We already know, this is a very indecisive market, people are waiting for a move to jump into. And it probably its working incredibly for bots.

Of course big holders are a big part in this effect, but you redistribute their holdings and the same would now be happening. 
Where is everyone? Never seen this place so quiet! Looks like 7.8/7.9k is holding fairly well for now....
For those keeping track, the daily stoch RSI has intersected in the overbought zone.
This 7950 to 8050 just feels like a no trade zone. Until we can break either 7700 or 8200 convincingly it’s anyone’s guess.

Sat out currently having made a couple of tiny (pointless?) scalps. 
Coincidentally this pump starts almost at the exact time as yesterday, waiting for that 8300 break.
I'm trying to understand charts better and develop a trading strategy so apologies if this is a dumb question - but ever since that BGC on the 12th it seems like the major price action has come from whale(s) squeezing shorts or longs with a lot of sideways action after and not much organic follow through? Do I not know how to differentiate between organic and whale-initiated price rallies? (apologies, I know we've discussed this whole "organic" thing to death lately and it's probably a stupid distinction anyway).  But if random whale orders are going to determine price action what good is TA then? Those big candles don't seem to be triggered in response to breaking out of any particular flags/pennants unless I'm not looking at the right signals. 
Anyone ever trade with their guts against what the charts are saying? I managed to make a nice profit off a short from the second run up to 8k last night. 

I have short orders staggered in the 8090-8175 range due to it being top of bull pennant and could make a decent scalp if/when it drops to the 7800-7925 range.

My gut is telling me go long but my brain/ charts telling me go short. 
The daily close is a battlefield right now!
20 minutes to determine whether it will close above or below 8k.

EDIT: That battle lol! Green won, it's 8001.3, yay :)
On gdax it looked like it broke upward from the triangle by a decent margin, perhaps up to $40-50. Did it break through on bfx or others - not acting like an upward break.
Since it looks like we're bouncing up and down inside of the flag drawn from the infamous BGD it seems like between 7-9am EST tomorrow morning will be a time to look out for as that's when the lines converge? 
Can anyone speak to this? I just drew my first triangle today lol, feel like I was flying blind (ie. gambling) before. Am I giving it too much credence?
Edit: Did I draw this right? I could be totally off, would appreciate feedback.

Here’s an idea. Instead of us posting our trades in here, we could add them to our flair instead. That way whenever you make a trade, you can choose to update your flair and others will know whether short/long, entries, stops.

Something like

L@7800;SL@7300
So lets all agree that we only buy and noone sells, okay?
Rising wedge is being highly respected right now

https://www.tradingview.com/x/OlKqSjV2/
I'm hopefully optimistic that these are nice, traditional bull flags playing out on the 1H, 4H, 1D, and even, potentially, 15m timeframes. Higher volume upside followed by subsequent lower volume sells leading towards consolidation before another move up.

Yesterday we had one, clear as day, and we woke up in North America over $8,000. I like to think not much has changed. See everyone in the morning.


Holy mother of triangles!

https://www.tradingview.com/x/JUk9mUFk/

When that thing breaks - in either direction - we're looking at a potential difference of $14,000 measured from the triangle's starting points.
Missing the noisy days of December 
Does anyone follow this weird action on Bitfinex? Those sudden green market buy spikes with (relative) good volume, looks positive to me, although I can't really tell what exactly is happening :/ 

At least buys are more agressive than sells for now. I hope he/she/they just crack that 8000 already so that we get the daily close above it :)
Holy stop Hunt Batman. Thats why my stop loss is deep in loss territory. These movements are berserk... 
Number of shorts are increasing vs longs. And price is still in local uptrend. Perfect setup for someone who wants to scoop up lots of coins with a short squeeze.
Pulled the trigger. Limit order for .420 at 8008.5. Let's hope some green dildos follow. 
Ok guys, need a little help.

On cryptowatch Bitfinex BTCUSD the site lags like crazy. It is totally unresponsive. I can't chart and I can't even scroll or change timespan normally. My every click registers 10 seconds later.

All other exchanges work normally, and Bitfinex works normally on every other pair.

This started happening when I switched to log view yesterday. I switched back to linear bit the lag stayed.

I have no idea why is it happening.
hmm.. up or down? https://www.tradingview.com/x/HlG0MCGW/
New trader here! I bought some bitcoin to hold until I discovered GDAX and now Im getting more interested in trading. What are good sources of knowledge I can read up on? 

Will the skills I learn from trading bitcoin easily transfer over to other markets? Im beginning to learn that I thrive the most from volatility and good momentum.
The bull flaggish pattern is still intact and trend upwards is picking up on 1h, I closed my long on futures with a stop loss to lock in some profit, but now thinking of going long swaps with stops just below 7990

Not sure if anyone here still needs to do US taxes, but [bitcoin.tax + TurboTax desktop software](https://bitcoin.tax/blog/bitcoin-tax-import-txf-turbotax/) was incredibly fast, easy, and cheap at a total cost of about $125 for up to 2500 trades. Thank god for eFile as my total tax documents came to nearly 350 pages...  
  
As for price action, I been sitting out for awhile now and missed the elevator ride to 8k. I don't really trust this right now, but, on the other geopolitical developments certainly make cryptos look more  attractive right now.
Don't know whether to buy based on 1 hr bullish divergence, plus the simple fact that our price has held/risen despite 1 hr RSI falling all the way to 45 and macd declining (would be a nice entry at the bottom of the bull flag channel), ... or take the bearish view that the 1 hr macd continues declining, the 4 hr macd is working on crossing negative, and the daily closed with a shooting star.
I've noticed a very interesting pattern. Every time i go to tradingview and the bitcoin technical analysis says "sell", the price goes up. Every time it says "buy", the price goes down. Works really well.

edit: it says "sell" right now, [7940 usd]

edit: for downvoters, i'm just sharing my observation which i actually have noticed over the past few days, definitely not recommending to anyone to make their trading decisions based on my observation 

Edit: couple hours later we are at 8070, it worked again 
Bitcoin Google trend declines further: [https://imgur.com/a/vDRgm](https://imgur.com/a/vDRgm)

I think it is interesting to keep an eye on this chart, although the meaning might be not very big. 
/u/_chewtoy_ are you still going to hold your short? Pretty decent bounce off 7950 

I want to sleep tonight, i can close now for a break even on my short or wait it out the night with alerts set all over the place. 

Edit: I’m so torn on what  to do. On Kraken you can’t set a stop loss/ take profits at the same time. Ide probably sleep better if I closed but yet could miss out on gains 
[deleted]
My channel is broken currently, we have to get above 7900 to stay in it

Edited: Linear line could act as a support if we break the current uptrend channel:
https://www.tradingview.com/x/bJnjtljT/
Looks like its going to have another go at 8.2k resistance here. What do you all think are the chances of breaking it vs getting another solid rejection to push it back to 7.7-7.9k? Any TA experts out there?
Cooling off and coiling up. Look'n good boys!
Going by previous recoveries following a bubble, a V-shaped recovery is unlikely.  The BGD was a clear signal to bears to proceed with caution, but it’s far too early to fomo.  Dollar cost averaging seems the prudent play from here.   
I still can not believe $7.8 is the new normal....what happened to $6.8 a week ago?
Guys how does 'Claim This Position' button works at BFX?
and again Bitmexicos server freezes when there is more than one order per second. Saw a perfect opportunity when futures were well below Finex spot price , but of course could not execute on that
Good morning from Europe. (Wonky teeth UK specifically).

I left my phone outside of the bedroom and had a great nights sleep as I couldn't check Binance every 2 hours.

If you don't do this you really should. First time I did so and slepts a full 8 hours.
So much temptation to short, but purely based on incessant chart watching the past month i cant help but feel that another leg up is in store especially after the relentless buying pressure around 7.8. 

Scaling into a short from 8.4-8.7 with stops above 9k is my next play, havent been in position since the BGD.

Closed my long here, (read: sold my btc) for 5% return on my total capital.

Will wait this out for a couple of days
More and more I think this is a pump and dump from a whale. The 1h buy was not organic. There is still a lot of cash in the exchanges and whales are aware of this, everybody waits for "the right time" to buy back in and a lot bought back after this spike what the whale was betting on. The volume is just heavily dropping off again...
Bull pennant breaking up? Or head and shoulders breaking down? That’s the question...

https://www.tradingview.com/x/pyzNgUcZ/

What do you all think?

RSI is way overbought, but it hasn’t stopped other bull rallies in the past... Oscillating indicators won’t stop retail from buying. Personally I have a feeling we will break upwards from here...
Feels like we may stay in this range for a while and just went longers and hodlers start to feel despair and shorters gain confidence, boom another BGC. So many comparisons between the bear trap in 2014 and now all over Tradingview that I can't imagine the same scenario playing out because it would be just too obvious.

Looks to be a fun weekend.
Happy Saturday all! Just wanted to let y'all know that since taking your feedback two days ago, I have released the newest version of my asset comparison tool, which allows you to compare Bitcoin to other cryptos and any traditional equity. Would really appreciate your continued constructive criticism and support as I try to improve this tool for you :\) Thanks, and [check it out here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8cb4d3/compare_bitcoin_to_other_cryptos_and_any_equity/)!
descanding wedge on the 15m
Last hour's volume higher than the preceding 4h total. A move up/down is imminent.
This feels a lot like it will drop!

8200 is pure resistance 

looking at any dip below 7700 to short, maybe

Technically stll a no trade zone, butt fuck it

From estimates on twitter - Bitcoin has ~50 million current owners.

Can anyone confirm this ballpark estimate?

What % do you suspect own more than 0.1 BTC? <1 million individuals total?
That hidden sell wall on finex at 7999.7 has been up for 4 hours now and eaten ~400 coins.

EDIT: Took around 500 totally by my estimate.
This feels more like a break away rather than a slow pump up?
Looking at the log line coming up right above us to short again. The fact that we barely retraced at all last night is a sign of strength but we are now far overdue for a relatively BRD and if it doesn't happen here or at that line then it's gone full parabolic on us once more and I don't trust parabolas.

If a ledger got disconnected during a BTC transaction so that the address was not physically verified on the ledger but the BTC was still sent to the receive address, would the transaction be botched? I had this happen and the funds left the exchange and were verified but never made it to the ledger.  Any thoughts?

Ethereum just started dropping like a rock out of the blue. Perhaps dumping eth to pump btc?
So.. As a newbie.. How do markets usually react to war? 
Anyone got the number of shorts open vs longs? Seems like a prudent think to look at considering movement appears to be driven by a squeeze of one or the other. But I'm a noob so wtf do I know? 
Idk, I’ve seen more skeptical bulls than hopeful bulls. Lots of idiots who are calling a moon landing, but I don’t count those emotional idiots.

We are going down boys. We stayed too long in the vicinity of 8000 without breaking 8300 convincingly. Trend exhaustion on the 12 hour  and the daily starting also to look to lose momentum as the stoch rsi looking to cross to the down side.  hourly and 4 hour MACD's are looking for a bearish cross. Im short 8060... if this pops up , highly doubt it. SL above 8300. Besides that...just look at the candles... nasty.

I like to think of it this way:

1. A bunch of people were short from 8500 down
2. There was a real risk that sub 6k would happen, and many people may have closed and reopened their short. They’re still effectively short from 8500, but the ROE displayed after a pump makes it look and fee like they’re at a loss.
3. once it pumped, many stops got hit, cascading up


I anticipate that few people actually lost money compred to the fiat value of their portfolio when we wete at 8k the weeks prior.

Should we go back to sub 7k, I anticipate the same thing could happen again

Also, let’s not forget that a candle in Dec that is half as big as the Wednesday/Thursday candle would have the same notional value

Still insane, just trying to make sense of it

Untradeable territory imo. Essentially just gambling.
Looks like it was a good decision than holding on to it or getting stopped out !
lol...
maximum pain, then reversal
Well that’s why we spend time on a trader sub where everyone, bears and bulls, can share their charts. There’s more times than I can count where I see something on someone else’s chart that I wasn’t able to see on mine. But the reality is, the best performing chart patterns are the ones that you see in the first 3 seconds of looking at a chart. If you have to study a chart to find patterns, most likely your bias is taking over.
we all see what we want to see to a certain extent every day of our lives - it’s a very human thing 
there are usually bullish and bearish cases and indicators simultaneously at play, so usually the author will have some bias, so it's important to read TA from both sides and try to gauge what has a preponderance of evidence
It’s called cognitive bias
that's why TA is generally so unreliable. it's best when you use a confluence of factors to open a position. most people use TA to justify gambling positions on ridiculous leverage 
That's sort of how it works. User bias plays a part.
My view is neutral when I am looking for signals, since I am not a bear nor a bull, just searching for signals to trade accordingly. I guess it will be a different story when I buy long-term HODL stack.
No, they see what the whales that pay them want to see
You've posted that on every daily for the last three days.

It's true though!
You forgot "head and shoulders forming"

Although I guess that's every day, not just the last 3 days
Can I choose option #3, "fuck knows"?

My analysis essentially suggests that the answer is #1, but with whales largely dictating the price as of late (both bull and bear whales that is), the analysis may well be entirely irrelevant.

What is a good entry range to open a long in your opinion given the circumstances?

Everyone would tell Verge traders to shut the fuck up and stand next to the Ven desk.
What I see is the market with it's flesh - the frenzy of retail investment - ripped off the bone. All we're left of is a  skeleton of sharp pumps and dumps by whales and manipulators. Of course this has always been there, it's just been hidden under the noise. I don't mean this to be bullish or bearish, just how I see the state of things.
They would sound a lot like the trollbox, constantly shilling their own positions. 
people are fine with manipulation if it brings them money

if it brings them loss its to the gallows mate
Manipulation meme is string here 
Thank you for sharing this! 
Thanks for this analysis. If we stall out in this 8K range we will cross down on the stoch RSI fairly soon. I haven't tried to do the math but it seems to me that a small move up in 5 or 6 days would then have us re-crossing upward around the time we test the ATH downtrend.

If I were a bullish whale, my aim would be to consolidate here for a while so that we test and break the ATH downtrend line first, individually, and then worry about the log resistance later.
Regarding divs, is it okay to measure them out over more than a 14 period length since that's what the RSI is based on? Also, I'd like to know where you stand on the wicks vs bodies debate to measure your divs?

RemindMe! 2 years. I‘m in
love you too bub
If in doubt, 50%. I was all in until a few minutes ago and cashed out half.

Disclosure - the rest I have is in Binance coin as it's too close to the coin burn and might not be a smart move to sell it.
Holding my 6800 long, stops at 7700. I am watching the big log resistance at like 8500 range to see what happens next
Short from 8100
Patient short from 8100
I just closed a 7800 to 8050 long from last night. I'm going to sit this next move out I think.  If it holds well around 7800 I might go back in but weekend is always tricky:
Just barely got stopped out of my 8187 short at break even while I was sleeping. I wish I had given it a little more breathing room, but I’m not in a hurry to reopen it at this point either. 

The rising wedge we broke down from yesterday is starting to look more like an upward creeping channel to me, so I’m no longer as confident that a retrace to the mid 7000s is quite so imminent. I still think we’re going to see a retrace down, but I’m sitting on my hands until I see a better entry point.
Shorted portion of my stack at 8120. It's quite obvious we lost steam at 8100. Will close my short at 7800.
I added to my little long.
You can back into this data by mining @BitMexRekt tweets. I'm not sure if that bot grabs liquidation data from Mex's API, but I'd look into it.
>no need to stare at these sideways charts

what do you mean by this
Ethusd seems to want to kick start a move up. Last 2 times i saw it falling faster btc ended breaking down also. I'm half in a small long (the most boring position ever, been stuck @494 for ever)
Possibly going long on btc here also 
Is there somewhere other than bitfinex shorts and longs to watch for the ratio?
All the shorts will get rekt again.
Just for clarification: You have shorts in place for maybe an attempt at another run up just to collect some small profits for when/ if it drops below 8k again.

But your stop losses are around 8320 with intentions on Sunday night/ Monday the Pennant may play out and we might look for a new leg up?? If the pennant plays out will you be looking for an opportunity for a long? 


Nice work, bud. I still have my opposing long from around $8,160 open. It’s a pretty big position, but is relatively low leverage so I’m not stressing....yet. 
>  you redistribute their holdings and the same would now be happening.

I don't really buy this. Herd dynamics create trends that make them more predictable. Random giant candles that go against the trend are much harder to predict. I think a lot of people here trade to some degree based on their intuitive feel for the natural ebb and flow of things. It's very hard to trade when those intuitions are broken. In other words, when people are yelling "manipulation!", I think they are really saying "this movement is inconsistent with the state space trajectories I am accustomed to".
And the thing is, a market always reacts on what people do. If everyone knows there is manipulation, the manipulation will not work anymore. So just trade the market, don't care about a reason why it does what it does. That is the real skill here, not to whine about those "whale cartels"
[deleted]
Why weren't they screaming manipulation during the bull run to 20k :)
I don't see organic markets, only bart movements.
Lovely sunny day here in the UK. I was out cutting the lawn and playing ball with my Westie. Now I'm reading up on the Verge scam. U?
I walked away for a while, went and did things with my life :-)
Want to feel more confident opening a long here given that 7.8 has been holding pretty well but I'm fearing a return to 7.2-7.6 any day now. 
If you think this is quiet you clearly didn't check this daily when we were hovering around 6.7\-6.8 a few days ago.

7.8k does seem to be holding pretty well, even with the paltry number of buyers, I think in part due to the confidence given by 6.6 holding so solidly over such a long period of time. To get much higher though may be tough, there isn't as much to squeeze as there was at 6.8k.
Daughter is running low grade fever so just sitting in bed with her and doing small trades on these chops. Establishing a better feel for this market place in my trade action I'm feeling so much more clear headed and confident in my decisions. Trying to take the bad trades and really consider the lessons I've learned through past losses.
What would you make of the fact that the 1 hr/1 day (overbought) and 2 hr, 4 hr (oversold) are saying the opposite?
Are you short right now? How often has daily stoch RSI being overbought led to a dump? How long can it sustain being overbought? Could it not in theory pump further before dumping?
what's funny is you could've said this 3 weeks ago and it'd fit right in. this range is so annoying -_-
Seems like I will need to re-adjust my sleep cycle. lol. 

Also waiting for 8300 to break (if it can).
They way I see it, TA determines decision points, and the whales are the ones with the ammo to make those decisions. 
Pretty much.  

The only organic follow through would be from actual investment, and at this price the only players left would be institutional money.  The institutional money probably knows that they will have to enter the space eventually but they are such an albatros they know they don't have to do anything until absolutely necessary.  They can also dictate the market when they do enter.  Until then the trend will be down so why not wait?
The interesting part about trading for me is how you always have to take into account the opposite case when considering your action plan. Pretty fun stuff!
What are the charts saying?
I woke up this morning to see the price swinging around 8150, it had already hit 8180 by then, I knew there would be another pump to 8175 at least, I planned to close my long based on my gut feeling during the second, however, I got greedy and didn't closed it. 
I would just short cautiously atm XD that is all
watching a candle struggle in real time is sure something
Some whale just parked 200 btc at 8k to prop things up during the last candle. Risky but seems to have paid off.
Whales creating liquidity to sell into buy pumping up to stop losses and limit buys
Agree with your timing. We've formed a nice equilibrium pattern and consolidation today that should lead to a break in a few hours. I'm sitting at roughly 75% bitcoin right now and have stops set at 7800 and 8250 should there be a break while I'm sleeping tonight. 
I can’t disagree with your lines too much. I’m on my phone and struggling to post my chart, but I started my support line at the hourly wick at 1:00 on 4/13. Additional wicks touch at 5:00, 22:00, and 4/14 0:00 and 12:00. I drew my line about 12 hours ago, and it seemed to be the best fit at the time. It hasn’t been broken today, but it hasn’t touched or come all that close since i drew the line either, so it could be a little too conservative at this point. Not going to try to say who’s line is more correct. Just another perspective for you to look at.

The only problem with that is no one would know your trade at the time you make it.  We'd all have to wait for mike and chewy to leave a comment about something else before we can copy them.
what would happen when someone gets liquidated? animation of small explosion? username flashing red? 1-day ban? Everyone sees it.
Sounds ripe for lying. Good in concept though. 
You first.
I'm up for that
The resistance line just hangs at two spikes close to each other, doubt the validity of the wedge because of that. 
Not a lot of buying pressure to escape that resistance line, unless a pump comes i'm seeing it breaking 
Not a TA expert, but why can't that be a rising triangle? Couldn't you draw a flat line on 8200?
Night-night. I'm also headed to bed. My advice to everyone is that they set Stop-Limit orders before going to sleep.

Well, one thing I can promise you - we will NOT go down 14000 USD from the current price ;)
Looking at exactly the same, but also note the mid term resistance was broken through quite with some force https://www.tradingview.com/x/aA8tiSDz
So would you consider it a good idea to lock in profits and wait for this to play out? 

I can increase my returns on my total investment capital with about 5% if i close my positions now. 

I'm having a really hard time because a breakout towards a bullish scenario could also make me miss out on serious gains because i'll be out of position when it happens

I'm already up about 20% (realised profits) on my total capital right now, and currently up 7% on my running investment.
What's weird about it to you? It's generally understood that we're beholden to the whims of large market traders while the retail/institutional space makes up their mind. We can attribute spikes to single entities pushing one direction or another. We can attribute spikes to other things, as well, but I haven't seen any that compete on merit.

During my time typing this, the price grew from $7,980 to $8,025.
Shorts are still at 25.5k to 30k longs
Low leverage shorts won't be squeezed easily. The ones squeezed were medium to high leverage.
Real pros know that an entry at $8008.5 can only mean a drop to $6969.69. Shorting here 100x
Wise choice, but don't hang around it for too long, sell it when it reaches your goal, or when you see things taking a turn. Cheers!
Hah, nice entry price and quantity. 
i give it a 69% chance of hitting 
Hell yeah dude

Check out The Chart Guys on YouTube. The best source of information for trading stocks or crypto that I've found from that resource. They also do a daily video on what the big three are doing and often add one or two alt-coins.
All you need is a dice (for the leverage #) and a coin (flip Heads go long / Tails go short). Good Luck.
You caught me red handed bro... I have an order for a twentieth of a coin at 8k. You can all thank me another time.

Guess Guess who is it...??  mmmm probably Bitfinex with their Tethers.
Aye, just did mine as well. First year it's gotten this complicated, seemed to work well enough, although mine was about 1000 pages and once I imported my trades into turbotax it crashed a good 5\-10 times, including twice when attempting to transmit the returns. That was fun.

Cost was about $40 for bitcoin tax & $80 for the desktop version of deluxe plus the e\-filing ripoff $25 fee, for a grand total of $145.00.
I also said sell from January to March which was pretty accurate.
They need to re label those as Bearish <----------> Bullish to make it not misleading
I've actually noticed similar, although works better when the needle is pegged one direction or the other. When the needle is sideways one way, the price seems to reverse the opposite way.
Im sure a majority of people know what 'Bitcoin' is/means. With all the major news outlets constantly reporting about it. I think it's better to observe the google trend for other key cryptocurrency words. This will give us a better picture of the overall level of interest in this sector.
Yeah, we need a pretty major run-up to start the hype machine back up. Nothing creates headlines like rapid price appreciation. For a couple of months there, the C in CNBC stood for cryptocurrencies.
This is bad news, moreso than people here admit. I remember seeing someone claim we had bottomed out and part of their reasoning was that Google trends ratings had flatlined or starting moving up slightly. 

Anyways, looks like it doesn't matter anymore since it goes against the bull narrative. People don't Google Bitcoin before buying Bitcoin, they Google aantonop and watch his technical videos because that's what the retail investors really care about. 
this is why it's difficult to follow a trader btw, if a move happens quick you don't know when they get in/out and it fucks everything up :(
I'm still holding mine for now.
[deleted]
I kept waking up from my alerts and closed mine near break even. Mostly because i shorted ethusd instead because the changes are greater there, but was sensing that it was droping slower and rising faster so the risk was greater. Watching now to re-enter, short or long depending on the market. 
And overall really difficult to put stop loss'es on Karken because of it's spiky and overreactive nature :D
Buy volume has dried up, still well within a rising wedge against pretty strong resistance from an old log support-turned-resistance line, still overbought on 4hr/6hr/almost on 12hr during a bear trend, with daily stoch RSI about to crossover in an overbought range, shorts are not stupidly increasing while longs outnumber them 30k:25k leaving more potential sell pressure on their eventual closings

Now of course if this winds up breaking up and through that resistance that would be very bullish indeed but you asked for some bear hopium

https://www.tradingview.com/x/C1h263qS/
It’s called bearoin and it’s nasty stuff 
yeap, i think 25min hopium more...and done!! 
Bulls have hopium. Bears must have dopium.

It's a matter of time. 
I'm seeing that too on my chart.
It's gonna break 8.3 for a higher high, draw in more retail buyers, build toward a recovery story. TA here is useful only if you view it from a "someone's painting the chart to make TA experts think this". The whales use TA to mind control TA experts. 
Someone here pointed out that the last high was actually a lower high and this range is now a tightening triangle  until the breakout. So there's one theory. 
I've read from Chewtoy that BTC usually go through its 4th price test. I think that will be the 4th 
Spring up or down. I had a slinky as a kid that's all.
Yeah with all these merchants adoption and google trends lately it can only go up!
I think we'll find out shortly whether it actually is normal or not. 7.2 would feel a lot more natural, and maybe we're headed there, but I'm long right now anyway, the action following the big green candle the other day has been confusing to say the least.
It means you can use your existing BTC to settle your short Balance thereby avoiding the need to buy back on the market.

This is good if you have hedged with leverage
[deleted]
Get a live. Bitcoin is not all. Money is not all!
Uh man, good advise. Sleep is more important than this. But this is addictive, it is hard to get away from it. :)

I do this too now. Much better.
Can’t agree more. Apart from the heavy losses over past few weeks (my bad n stupid trades), this has taken my life n sleep over which I will try n get out as soon as I can somehow break even..!
The flag we're in is really toying with breaking down. If it does, I don't know if you'll get your entry
noeeeI only buys after organic, non-GMO, free range pumps
It's weekend and tons of coins have just been bought, ain't it normal that the volume drops in these circumstances? And loads of alt-coins were pumping before BTC made a push, doesn't that tell something about the market sentiment?
it was the biggest volume candle in the midst of some of the lowest volume days on GDAX (FOMO/normiebase) in a very long time. It was mainly just shorts closing and traders FOMOing in. Doesn't mean it couldn't be a reversal but yeah it seems like someone really wanted those shorts  to close 


not to mention the volume has completely died after 
At minimum I think we are gonna retest an old log resistance line as support at 7650 and about where the first pump intiially stopped, if that breaks I'm not sure how far it drops
Surprise surprise
'Organic' really is the new buzz word nowadays.

As I said yesterday, I’m staying out of position until we see more convincing moves here.
Where fiat for bgd?
I also think we are going up, doubt that it will take so long this time. It seems like we are making higher lows, hope that we will be able to shoot through 8.2 soon.
Nice catch

https://www.tradingview.com/x/cHlyJpyr/
That's some great analysis. It will go up or down
You’ve been sitting on your hands for a while. 

About time you take them out for some air 
I'm with you on that.
Anything under $7800 (beyond a tiny seconds-long wick) would be a signal to go lower, I think. No reason to wait for $7700 if we head there, especially with longs outnumbering shorts significantly once more. 
> This feels a lot like it will drop!
> 
> 

So it will break through
According to this sub, everything is a no trade zone. Long term play is to sit in fiat and continue watching the slow drain of the bear market. 
> Selloffs in a lot of the alts

You're probably watching shitcoins with super thin order book I guess.. I don't see a selloff on more "regular" alts personally 
your underwater short will break even at 7.1?
7100 makes no sense. Such a random number.
The big Saturday Night/Sunday pullback, eh?  Unlikely to test that low.
... not sure which alts you're holding, but maybe it's time to rebalance. I'm not seeing many pull back.
My alts still gaining satoshi. Not saying it will keep pumping but volume is good. Some coin’s alt/btc pairings on binance have higher btc volume than Gdax. 
It's hilarious how WE ARE STILL in a bear market yet any mention of a retrace and anyone gets downvoted. Talk about bias.
All the way to 7.1?

I'm fairly certain that there are several people on here that own well over 1000 BTC.
I'd say around [10%](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*uc-Np1aQNr2O2iLW83szmQ.png)
this sites has number of wallet not users - but still gives some number so you guestimate better.

%5 of Americans own BTC.. that about 16.55 million.

Add 36 coins more just now. How huge is that thing? :/
how can you tell? just counting the sells from the book?
Wym a break away? 
you trusted them on the way down
Thanks. Just bought 100k
Guaranteed^^but ^^really ^^no ^^guarantees
lol @ this complete troll getting upvoted
Was about to ask as I have turned skeptical: what are the arguments for new ATHs? Don't get me wrong, I would love them but... it looks like the price could stabilize around 10k through the year...
What reason do you have to suggest that? Is the reason that you bought above the current price?
That’s a very optimistic view. Why did the value drop 60% from the ATH over the past 3 months?  People are just stupid, or maybe it was overvalued?  

If you were right, then it would have already recovered because it is such a “sure thing”.  In reality, it may very well go up 10x to 14x at some point in the future.

But to say 4x is guaranteed by end of year is absolutely silly.  So everyone should just invest everything they have in BTC ?  Get a second mortgage?  That would all be the right thing if it was “guaranteed to increase by 4x.

I would actually say a 4x return by end of year is unlikely and I wouldn’t be surprised if there is a negative return over the next 8 months.  I’m not guaranteeing a negative return.  I just think it more likely than 4x return over 8 months.  

This is coming from someone who believes in BTC long term l.  But to say we are definitely going to see a break f this bear market and a return to the moon by end of year is foolish.  
Yeah LN will arrive any second together with Rootstock now and this will unbank the unbanked and make ETH, EOS and NEO useless!
Thank you for this. 
Wouldn’t that second conversion be negligible gains, just whatever happened in the time since the first conversion? I’m no expert but my understanding is that yes, each event is taxable if there are capital gains. 
Yes unfortunately. And since it’s usually btc -> Alts -> btc -> usd, you’ll get taxed on each conversion assuming price rises in each 
Umm maybe it's the wrong sub for that but... That's only like 8 million dollars so the market just ate it up.
ETH sold for BTC? Would that not be bullish?
The ETHBTC ratio on Poloniex had a major sell that took it from 0.064 to 0.0523.  Perhaps arb bots did the rest, but the ratio bounced back up almost immediately.

Lol $12 dollars is hardly a drop 
Dropped 3% in 2 minutes, but recovering now. That's like a $200+ drop for btc. Didn't mean to spam eth here; thought something might have been up that could indicate something for btc. ?
For the past few weeks ETH/BTC dumps have correlated with BTC price falling too. 
I mentioned Bart an hour ago.. got my Bart on ETH.
With bitcoin there are two sides to how a crisis like this will affect the market: 

1. Bitcoin is no more than a speculative token that people invest in to get rich quick, and in any crisis like event will pull their money out immediately due to its volatility and because you’d only invest your available money anyway (which you don’t have a lot of in a crisis). 

2. Bitcoin is a hedge against geopolitical and economic risks, any event where a current system fails will lead to investors transferring funds to bitcoin as a bet against the current financial system. 

Pick your side. 
No war happening as its just a bunch of geriatrics and wannabees sabre rattling like its circa1850 or something, trying desperately to hold on to their discredited jobs. Why not set up a bet on byteball or auger and get  some adoption/usage going. Otherwise... as you were bitcoin
you should watch Oliver Stones telling of America on Netflix. Forget the actual title but it’s more or less a documentary on the economic benefits of being an imperialist war machine. 
war is usually a great way to pull an economy out of a recession/depression .

WWII and the war in Afghanistan/Iraq are excellent examples

Both have gone up uniformly. 29.7k Longs against 24.9k shorts on finex. Neither looks particularly ripe for squeezing just yet.
> but I don’t count those emotional idiots.

what's the point then? 
You just went against the hivemind! Prepare for downvotes!!!
Or they are currently selling slowly not to crash the price
Do we all agree that secretgilder is a whale and his comments mostly serve to confuse/measure retail investors' sentiment in order to fuck us out of our coin?
Volume always drops off when making a pattern, and picks up following resolution
Saturday pump, sunday dump
Would you mind explaining how this works? 
But every period of low volume buying has ended with a high volume of dumping.
Price consolidation is occurring, this takes time.  It is more likely to break up in the direction of the most recent significant impulse which was up from 6.8k to 8.01k -- which was supported by historically high volume.  Market sentiment is palpably more bullish than before the move and this has to be respected and considered seriously at least short term in trading decisions.
We are still trending up. If anything this is bullish ha...
Ok
I think you forgot to mention that stability is historically bullish for BTC 
Yeah, that green candle from 6k to 8k looked nasty. For those who cried that we're going down and shorted :)

(not saying that we won't though, but I think it's not up to simple TA indicators to decide)
Your comments crack me up dude

3 days ago, you advised us to go 20x short, how did it go for you? (The deleted post that got -39 downvotes)

> What would it take for BTC to shift in toward the buidl ecosystem direction?

Why waste resources doing computationally intensive tasks on the main chain when you can do it on a [side chain](https://www.rsk.co/) instead ?
Hopefully you can see from the downvotes why this isn't going to happen for the Bitcoin ecosystem.
Huh?

The only real difference is that Ethereum has a plain and simple programming language that looks and feels a lot like C or Jacascript.

Bitcoin script is just harder to learn because you need to think differently, more like Forth.

I think a Bitcoin Script compiler and a simple language would be good
> What would it take for BTC to shift in toward the buidl ecosystem direction?

Tell Core to stop blocking progress and stop being dickheads to everyone who disagrees?

Sorry, after 3 years of garbage between the big and small blockers, regardless of who is to blame, the buidl has left the building.  If they're not already building on Bitcoin, they're not going to start now.

There were a *lot* of people short from sub $7.5k, so idk honestly

Regardless, I actually don't think anyone here really realizes how historic that pump was. Literally one of the hugest green candles in btc history in terms of fiat volume
The only reason I think the same thing won't happen is shorters got quite the hot stove lesson. Since that they have only closed more and have been very tentative to open up

Ya, I don't understand at all to be honest. 

There's pretty much zero chance this can break up without going sideways for a few more days or dumping down to at least $7,500 first. 

Yet we get a 2.5%, 15 minute candle the moment it looks like it's about to drop.

This reminds me of a TEDx Talk on consciousness I recently watched. Our internal “view” of the world affects how we interact with the world more so than how the world actually is in front of us. I probably butchered that concept. 
The hermeneutical situation of humans really is fascinating.  It's a phenomenon that becomes so clear when talking about 'reading' charts.
People just tend to use it wrong because they don't think about *why* a particular pattern usually suggests a particular outcome. You could filter out the large majority of false positives by thinking clearly about whether or not the typical causes of a particular pattern really make senses in the current context.

Usually, TA that works is actually just a simplified visual representation of some other factor that is governing the market. A good recent example is /u/cyoreligion 's post yesterday: https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8bwesq/daily_discussion_friday_april_13_2018/dxbvmme/. The purple resistance line, which has been governing the market for the last while, is actually just tracking the daily stochastic RSI.
there is no question that this goes on, I’m curious about the extent though. any thoughts or specifics you’d like to share? 
I have been making good money of whales and their pump and dump soo im happy....
this too, yes
That BGD(minus the wick) was just a mirror of the BRD on the 28th-29th, it just wasn’t in an hour on the drop.

Edit: date.
Parabolic bull...until it isn't. Bear market, until it isn't. Suckers rally...Unless it's not. 
Something feels up. I've been too hopeful before!
Exactly. This is a standard suckers rally in the middle of a bear market.  Alts going up should give everyone  pause.  Still no reason for ripple to pump.  Hope folks don't get too hurt by it. 
Anything below 7.9k with stops at 7.7 if the triangle doesn't hold

but they got the highest bonus
Yeah what a great way to describe it. The randomness induced by retail investing was virtually absent before this recent pump.
Do you think the BitMex trollbox is largely bots?
From my understanding of stoch rsi, as long as RSI continues increasing daily it won't cross because the stoch RSI will continue to be at maximum. Maybe there's even a tiny amount of wiggle for it to slightly decrease but the ema is really close so not much.

I haven't done the math on what the price needs to do to continue increasing RSI though so maybe you're right.
Over the 14 period cycle is fine as far as I know.

Definitely bodies. RSI is calculated using open/close prices so using wicks is disingenuous - if you were looking at the RSI as that wick was occuring it would have been much higher or lower than where it actually closed/ended up.

Talk to me about the burn?
Same here, entered short yesterday (8130), didn't take profits and got stopped this morning. Now it's difficult to find good position or signals. Too many mixed signals, from bearish divergences to hidden bullish divergences. A lot of lines acting as a support and resistance, rising wedge/uptrend channel. Think I'll to catch breakout to either direction
So this could be a nice three way trade here then. Long ETHUSD, ETHBTC and BTCUSD; then when momentum stops in one of them, short ETHBTC
Datamish.com shows data for bitmex
I'd like to know too but that's all I'm aware of
This post is the definition of low effort and content. 
I have short adds up to the top of the pennant (currently--I'll move them down as we move in the pennant) because I want a larger position. I'm not willing to add here at the bottom, nor do I want to close here for small profit. We could very well revisit 8150 in the next 4 hours and still be inside the pennant.

Bull pennants obviously traditionally break up, but Friday's bull pennant broke down: https://www.tradingview.com/x/sPpmHtXW/ 

We also haven't had a retest for support for anything under 7600 since 6700. None of this means we have to break down, but it feels to me like we're not done with the 7000s yet. 

As for a long, yes, I am going to be scaling into one. I actually have a 0.5% stack position at 7890, which the first tiny order scaling down to a 5% stack position at 7500. If this is in fact a massive bull pennant, I should probably have added heavily down at 7900 this morning. 

I do also still have my sept futures long from 6410.
yea. basically. for that very reason people (including me) hold to see when a move is starting and then try to use that. That is what causes those candles. 
The fact a whale is often the one pulling the trigger is irrelevant, for all that concerns me at least.

Well, that's not entirely true, because even though at this point most might know it's manipulated, that doesn't mean that they'll know *which way* the manipulation will go ahead of time. Sometimes we can make good predictions, but the manipulator has the benefit of always knowing what he will do.
o, of course it is. but thats nothing new. It has always happened. Dont hate the player hate the game.
They were. 
They were.
to be fair, i saw that craze as going up to 100k or more just with how much people was buying. 
please define an organic market 
look at it this way. People are very fearful right now and so they avoid making their moves. this "trade pressure" blows up and compresses normal growth into a big candle.
Oh yes.. we have a sunny day in the UK for a change. I need to do my lawn as well, probably in the evening time. 
That's a very interesting topic. 
was it only me who first read it as " did things with my wife"?
My exact feeling. I am almost ready to open a long but want to be safe and open at the right point, not to find it dump hard straight after I open the position!
Agreed. It was pretty quiet last week as well! Seems like we are stuck in the small range between 7.8k to 8.2k for now which apparently is getting smaller and smaller. Will be interesting to see which way it breaks though. I am keen to enter a good position (hopefully long) to start recovering some of my losses from previous weeks bad trades. 
Family comes first my friend. Hope ur daughter recovers quickly. And it’s great to hear the learning and the application - respect that. I need to start doing the same slowly. 
I've only been paying attention the daily one to set up a longer term trade, but the rule of thumb with stoch RSI is to use it to look for short entries when overbought in a bear trend, or for long entries when oversold in a bull trend. So if this is the start of a true long term bull reversal it would obviously disregard this crossover, but I don't think we are done with the macro level bear market yet. It's close enough to some strong resistance that I can feel good about setting up a short near it and bailing on it early if we break through it.
The last 4 times in row, it has marked the beginning of a several day downtrend. HOWEVER, selling an oversold crossover is much more reliable when in a confirmed downtrend. If we started an uptrend here, then it can stay in the oversold area much longer and bounce upward even after a crossover.
stoch rsi just means shit has gotten to ridiculous levels. doesn't mean it's going to dump any time soon really
>Are you short right now?

A small scalp within this triangle with higher shorts set up at 8250 and 8300.

>How often has daily stoch RSI being overbought led to a dump?

https://www.tradingview.com/x/Tf217heM/

>How long can it sustain being overbought? Could it not in theory pump further before dumping?

I somewhat anticipate a small pump here up to retest and fail the old log support turned resistance line.
Yep, true. I was the wrong side of the short squeeze and lost half a bitcoin between that and doubling down. Lesson learned, and need to stop chasing trades. Will rather wait for the key support/resistance lines to make trades now based upon break up/break down.
And it’s a pattern that keeps repeating in various ranges 
Large bull pennant on the 2hr and 1 hour, it it plays out we are looking for a run to the 8100-8150 range then a rejection back down to 7920-7960 area. Then from there who knows if the bull pennant will break up or down. But as someone pointed down before the pennant on Friday broke down. 
greed is a partial reason why I’m profitable on my first 11/11 trades. I havent been an ounce of greedy. 
Watch in on the 1M chart it's even better
didn't break on bitmex chart but not sure how accurate my lines were
Strange to see that something's about to break but have no idea which way it's going to go. Not really any strong indication (imo) but we'll see what people point to after the fact.
we could talk about the weather :)
yeah, I was thinking whether we could change it up a little. The game could be modified to include stop losses, I think.
yeah, that’s an issue. I guess we could still post the same we do now. No reason not to
maybe a small dagger at the top
....and posting that same information into the daily directly is somehow LESS ripe for lying?
He'll get the lowest price.

So am i!
I should clarify it's the old log support line that I left on my chart, not a newly drawn line just for this formation, that's why I tend to believe it more than it being a purely local line with only two points of contact
For the record I'm far from a TA expert too. But my take is that the wicks end at 8220 and 8235 respectively, but the blue line is actually our old log support line that has now seemed to turn into resistance, so that's the basis of my thesis that it's a rising wedge, it just happens to line up perfectly with where those wicks ended. If that last run up hadn't stopped at 8190 and gotten up a little higher it could have had a little more of a case for making a flat top.

I do think there's a case for it actually being a bull flag, but given that we're running into a strong resistance line and we're currently overbought and not strongly retesting that resistance, I'm expecting it to behave more like a rising wedge and ultimately fall through, if not on this attempt, the next one.
If we did, everyone who has a negative Bitcoin balance would be rich :P
Depends on your style of trading. I for one have no problem trading in this edge of the triangle, as I focus on short-term positions / scalps.
I don't think people realize no one is gonna squeeze 3k of shorts...

The reason the last squeeze happened was because there was like 15k shorts from sub $7k, and i really think most of those were hedges honestly
People still like to close them though. The real problem in squeezes is the slippage.
All shorts are low leverage, max leverage on Finex is 3.3x
That was 2 days ago.  It's not exactly "right after" the 15 minute candle.
I wish we'd just invalidate the triangle already!
LIFO makes a lot more sense for trading than FIFO, imo.  FIFO is for one time sales of long term holdings / infrequent trading.

This is a common response to the mention of google trends, and it just doesn't fly. Practically any person interested in buying bitcoin is going to google bitcoin in some form or another. Because they know about it is precisely why they would google it. I still occasionally google things like 'bitcoin futures launch', 'bitcoin news', etc.
that’s the thing. I think a majority of people *think* they know what bitcoin is, but most really have no idea. Hopefully the next wave of interest focuses a bit more on the tech, but not holding my breath. 
Google Trends does not show the influx of money into crypto but the new users into crypto. It does not demonstrate the existing users using it as a speculative investment vehicle. It can be used to predict an imminent Bull Run however.
I'm watching that log line very closely. I know you said the market is likely to roll through it on the 4th attempt but at this point it's the best candidate for the significant retrace (barring mayhem right here as I jynx it) 
One does not cancel the other, so its risky. Already had a time when take profits was triggered and when it reversed the stop loss opened a new position 
Is that a hidden bear div?
dumpium is more like it :)
Yes I saw that too.. Not sure whether to enter into any position short/long at this stage or wait to see if the 8.2k resistance holds
IF it makes it up there, still a lot of resistance before that. 
Or you can use USD to settle it you're long.

But there's additional fee for claiming.
In my case, I have a long open from 7835. If I claim this position, what will happen, and is it advisable to claim it?

Thanks for your feedback! Cheers! :)
yeah but this means you need to buy on market or? The fees for that adds up quickly and you can not decide your price, so I prefer post limit orders

For me it'll be 7500 and failing that, 72-7300.

That channels seems fairly valid to me. I might start scaling in a long at the bottom of that...
So, as every TA out there, we can either go down, or up!

the media seem to help to accelerate the process, i keep seeing articles that say "btc is going to hit 250k" and so on
Do we have enough volume?
Thanks for the insightful well-thought addendum to my thesis. Indeed, it might surprise us and go sideways for awhile.

I started trading in January, at least since then the movements seems to be pump/dump and sideways for a while. Was this the behavior on previous bull runs and bear markets?

I consider myself a Bitcoin skeptic too now to be fair, which is amusing because this time last year I was a huge fan of Bitcoin, but honestly, the more I think about Bitcoin, the more I begin to question what potential it really has. I genuinely think that at this point, most people are only in Bitcoin because it's worth something and because they hope it'll be worth more in the future, not because they actually think it has any real value as a currency. 

But maybe I'm wrong. I hope I am.
Bitcoin is still the main liquidity provider for all crypto markets. Crypto space is absolutely booming, whether you think it's all scams and garbage or not, there are thousands of companies working in the space and a lot of capital flowing in.
Lightning network? Institutional money? An increased market cap? I'm not a BTC holder, but I am bullish enough long term that I don't blame anyone who does.

Nope, looks like more sideways movement between 8.1 and 7.9 incoming until one of the two opens position for the whales. I know, crazy technical analysis in my part. I'd down vote myself. 
I think what he means is he's not considering irrationality into market sentiment.
Sooner than later there needs to be a move in either direction. I won’t be surprised to see another small dump to say 7.5-7.7k before the next big pump to break 8.2k.

Gotta think this is more likely.  

Coordinated spike of $1000 by bots/whales.  Slowly sell and build short position at the new high price when all the small fish are excited about the “breakout” and then short the crap out of the market back down to 6400.  Repeat ad Infinitum for unlimited GAINZ
it doesn't, low volume buying is not a particularly good thing, it means sellers are waiting to unload. Big volume moves are what we should be looking for. 

If the price was gradually sagging on low volume it'd actually be more bullish because that's much more like a bull flag 

this doesn't mean it won't move up from here- it's just that this weird slow climb is what we've seen so many times before when sellers decide to all unload simultaneously
The previous big candle would seem to suggest otherwise.
we are not... we are compressing in a triangle  we might pop up before getting hammered.
We are still in the triangle so lets first break out. ....there is just too much resistance and all breakout traders are just giving liquidity for the whales to get out at the top. I would be cautious.
short is still on....  will higher my SL to above 8400. bc thats the target area of this triangle. I expect major selloff if we do get there or a sellof if we stay here too long. Sorry for taking the opposite trade guys. 
OK :)
You told us we would be at sub 6k by now

Price is going up because of almost no selling. The holders are currently waiting for 8200, that is when you will see some action.

What I personally wanna see is the price coming out as a hero and crossing that level higher above.

good point
Shorts open when people expect price to drop. They're not opening now cause we don't know if this is reversal or another pump. If we'll be rejected from 8 and drop to low 7 shorts will start to open like crazy again.
I’m not trading this. Closed my shorts before the pump and caught a couple longs on the beartrap. Closed everything and sitting on my hands
Fixed
Did people really not notice this? There were comments in real time about how it was the biggest 1 hr candle ever 
The whales know this too. That is why they pump it up to short into the fomo.
this is what I'm looking at 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/vS0PswvD/

when the 4h candle closed above it we got a pump, then got rejected again at 8150

edit: looks a little better on the hour chart

> There's pretty much zero chance this can break up without going sideways for a few more days or dumping down to at least $7,500 first.

I very much want to agree with you, but that's a dangerous thing to say...this is Bitcoin, after all.

But yeah, I'm very uncomfortable at these levels (strict no-trade zone for me since I exited my long). Will probably long a convincing break up past the flag (above $8.2k) and try to ride it up to downtrend resistance around $8.5/$8.6k.
so far this has been trading pretty much perfectly within the triangle
with a wheel that has system overload when you want to bet on it
It’s the same reason that a pattern completing on daily candles has a much higher success rate than the same pattern completing on 5 minute candles. More people are following the pattern on the daily and acting in unison when it breaks out one way or the other.
The basis behind it is that there is going to be a lot more support and action behind an obvious textbook chart pattern that everyone (novice and experienced trader) can recognize and agree on
You’re absolutely right. The world we see is not what actually exists, it’s just how we perceive our reality. There are likely other dimensions that we simply cannot perceive. Think about this: how would you explain a 3-D world (depth) to a stick figure living in two dimensions? You could draw a cube, but it wouldn’t mean anything to the stick figure because he can’t perceive depth. Now, if other dimensions do indeed exist, how would a being who can perceive them explain and show them to us? 
Perception is, indeed, reality 
I was just joking about it, but on tradingview where people comment on the charts i see claims like this one being made all the time. Not sure if it's true
BRD? BGD? I pay less attention for a week or two and suddenly we have acronyms I don't recognize.. 
So, there is no spoon?
Exactly the reason why it could be different. Just when the majority of people give up all hope is when the cycle begins to start over again. And for the most part, it seems like most have given up hope.
Yeah that seems good. 

Did you not opened one when we were at the bottom of the dip last night?
I wonder how much money he made with BitMex. I’m sure it’s hundreds of millions

Well, let's say we stay *exactly* at present price for several days. Average gain will decrease; thus smoothed RS will decrease; thus RSI will decrease; and therefore stoch RSI will decrease under most circumstances. And I'm pretty sure in this case stoch RSI will decrease.
Alright, and in your experience, what usually confirms/invalidates a div? Also, any hierarchy in the divs power in terms of hidden/regular etc.?
Is it still considered divergence if, for instance, the price closes significantly higher while (a) the RSI closes exactly the same, or (b) the RSI closes just barely higher? For instance the price turns around at 7500 and 7800 while the RSI turns around at 70 and 70, or 70 and 71.

Thanks Haser your perspective is always helpful 
Ya, but most people probably don't want to hover over the charts all day every day just to detect that one breakout moment when it happens. If you think about it, that's just trying to get in early on the little ponzi scheme encapsulated in each candle: you try to get in early then sell into bagholders. I imagine your view might be: "if you don't like the market, get out", and I think that is what a lot of people might be doing right now.
Sure, half the sub predicted a short squeeze in general, but the prediction wasn't very detailed. It was just "price will go up", with no insight into when or by how much. At least under conditions I consider more "normal", you typically have some sense of when an event will occur and likely targets.

You could open a small position here with low leverage and add to it if it dumps if anything. 
do you think it'll ever break out? i kinda suspect it's gonna constantly oscillate between 5k and 15k.
This is true. It's worth pointing out though that about every time this has happened in recent memory we were reaching a point where plenty of people thought the bear could be done, because naturally, overbought on daily stoch RSI is going to happen after a multi-day bull rally.

wow i drew the flag like a minute before that red candle and watching it in real time, you could try to see him break the flag but buy pressure pushed it back inside (for now). kinda crazy. anybody that thinks we're breaking up out of this triangle, this is the last buying opp you get before the triangle is invalidated.

he's getting downvoted now which means people didn't realize he was joking lmao 
What made me realize the potential is really the simple of fact of what it is. Bitcoin is inarguably two things:

i) Value that can be transferred between two entities (regardless of location) without a third party involved AT ALL.

ii) Value that was created without a third party at all that can't be regulated away (or won't be at this point).

These features have been around since its existence but it really wasn't until trading on Bitmex that I really understood the sheer power of this. If I want to margin trade on a website I trust I can simply do it without having to go through a mountain of paperwork. Same thing goes for something like a online gambling website.

These are things that I am interested (trading and sports betting) but it really extends to anything. I can now do business globally/frictionless-ly without having the financial system involved (western union, paypal, visa etc...). The coin has been able to faciliate this for years. This is enough of a killer app for a much higher market cap as people use it.

Some of the most impactful innovations are the simple things that just "worK." Google's empire was built on just being able to type in something and get information. Facebook's monetization comes from an activity feed. Instagram makes money on an app that lets you share a picture.

All while self driving cars... missions to mars.... AI singularity etc.. are still taking time to take hold but have been promised as the next big things.

Bitcoin you allowing to do business immediately with anyone globally with no barriers to entry IS the killer app. It is so simple just like Facebook which in 2004 it didn't seem ground breaking, as the service scaled and more people used it then it became one of the worlds biggest companies. 

All of the hype is raising awareness, in 2014 I was worried because the masses may not "get" it but I actually underestimated people's ability to use technology. Wallets / mobile phones make it easy enough and coinbase etc... is easy enough to sign up for. It all will only get easier... The media coverage is also a huge plus for long term adoption.

I could go on and on but just rest assured that even without lightning etc... Bitcoin has already proven its worth. It is hard for us to see the bigger picture but it will come in due time...

I have faith in blockchains for other purposes but I KNOW that using a blockchain to decentralize value/money (whatever you want to call it) is a killer app. Probably THE killer app really.... 
One day I hope I can just travel everywhere in the world without worrying about exchanging money. 
I hope you are wrong but you are very likely right. Doesn't mean the price can't keep rising though. 
"You'll come for the lambos...but stay for the decentralized revolution in individual freedom & financial sovereignty leading to a restructuring of global economics & power & a shift in favor of the people, rights, peace & liberty the likes of which the world has never imagined"

One of the best quotes ever about Bitcoin. It could easily fail and go to zero but if it succeeds the power to change the world of finance, government, basically everything through decentralization really is the biggest innovation of our time. It's so much more than just a currency or store of value. More revolutionary than even the Internet. 

I've been in since 2013 and have known the whole time it could fail at any point, but every day it doesn't fail, it just gets stronger. 
What made you question it? 
70% correction over 4 months is a bear market, if you think it's bullish long term then you're just defining it differently and looking at a different time frame
Things move fast in crypto world.  3 months is an eternity and a 3 month uninterrupted downtrend with 60% loss of market cap certainly qualifies as bear market in crypto.  
I don't do those smaller trades so I guess it's just relative 
What do they have to do with those wars?

/s?
But it did for the US economy ;)
Yep... just print more fiat, rinse and repeat
weird decision considering that's what drives so much movement 
I wouldn't be surprised either to see a last half-assed pump to 8200 before crashing, but what do I know
To me it looks more like a channel.

Also you have pump predictive powers .
Let me help you then:

I am still long but neutral now - and I personally want to see us stuck in a narrowing range here for a few more days and short interest to increase during that time before I get bullish again. Low volume as the BBands narrow is fine and even preferable.

It's like loading a spring.
This is what happens every time so far, sellers wait for the highest price to unload and it crumbles in a day or two. that's why I want to see it test lower levels before moving up before I'm officially neutral/bullish. otherwise this looks like sellers simply waiting to unload on  bagholders yet again

plus that Adam and eve doesn't happen with a v shaped pump, it's gotta look round 
Show me one Ethereum contract that requires turing completeness.

Also Simplicity is turing complete
No, that one isn’t used much and ivy is still a language you need to learn. There have been talks of using diagrams à la MAST to define contracts and compile those down to transactions
I have looked into Rootstock
Yeah everyone knows core is flawless.
lmao
be sociable. let yacked out folks talk your ear off and offer insane proposals to you. follow up with them the next day. say yes and figure out how to pull it off later. work for a reputable place and do good work. people will reffer you when you do well. I’m on my way out (trying to put more time into my sound engineering ‘career’) but it’s a great industry and makes for some insane stories. San Francisco is out of control bruv... 
I’m up quite a bit since I bought in. I don’t care for ripple long term at all. It’s not why I’m into crypto. But upping my btc stack? Sure. Downvote away I don’t care. Would be dumb to short it but idk don’t trust a random internet guy. that’d be dumb too. good luck 
I just feel like the exuberance died off very quickly considering how fucking huge it was, partially because $6800 to $8000 isn't as sexy as $13600 to 16000
if 9k breaks we'll start seeing people asking how to long BTC :)
Because who cares about only earning 1X if you can earn 25X risk free because it only stops at 100k this time.
It will be the mother of all parabolas :)
Remember though that this is the first rodeo for a whole lot of margin traders, and that was the first time a lot of them have been squeezed like that. I just think they're not likely to get so crazy again but hey it is bitcoin so maybe.
It was huge but look how fucking huge it was. The chart makes it look ridiculous 

we're in a bearish market with relatively low volume most of the time especially on spot and suddenly we see the largest 1h volume since literally ever, even after the December craziness

Think sex toys.

I don't think we're reading the same thread, lots of hopeful bulls.
No I almost did but I was going to sleep and I thought that I had had enough trading for the day (and night). No biggie though I'll go into a long if we break the resistance in the middle of the channel or if we go back to test the lower part
Not saying you're wrong that RSI wouldn't go down if we stay at current price, but I think we could still have slightly green days for a little.

That said, if this current daily candle holds we'll probably be crossing on this one.
It confirms when the price actually turns around. I nominally would say when a candle, preferably multiple, actually closes red creating the div, with a bit of wiggle room for massive movements. This does make it a bit of a lagging indicator so it can be hard to tell when it's already played out. It can help confirming one on a shorter time frame to see it as an early sign that a longer time frame one may be valid (not guaranteed of course).

Divergences don't really get invalidated per say, it's just more so that possible divs eventually just never form.

Hidden vs normal references what they use for. Hidden indicates continuance, normal a reversal. In a downtrend, look for hidden bear and normal bull divs, opposite for an uptrend.

Also keep in mind the time frame - an uptrend on the hourly could still be a downtrend on the daily, so you'd be looking for bear divs on the hourly and hidden bear divs on the daily (opposite for bull divs).
I'd maybe say it but emphasize that it's very very slight. Or in the case of the RSI not actually being higher, I don't think it's technically a div but still something you could note as minor evidence since essentially it would have the same market sentiment. Just my opinion, a more experienced trader may have a more nuanced or definitive answer.
And does this have usually have a positive effect on the value as you’d expect?
Yes but all three can not by definition move the same , so if 2 have action do the opposite on the 3rd
No shorts were closed in that $100 pump
> you try to get in early then sell into bagholders

I agree, but to be fair, that's pretty much the goal of every trader even if you look at "organic" price movement instead. Everyone is trying to buy before someone else buys it higher and/or sell before someone else sells it lower.
Indeed. I have advised plenty of times to just stop trading in these ranges. Hold bitcoin, stay in fiat, 50/50, whatever. completely unpredictable. 

I do believe that now is time to hold bitcoin or a low leverage long.

Anything below 7k or above 9k will be a key breakout in either direction at this stage. For the short term, need to see if 7.5k or 8.3k breaks to hint the immediate direction. 
Indeed! This feels like we should at least touch the log resistance around $8400 first. I remember how stretched the market felt trying to hit 11.7k, and after hitting it we dropped hard. Same could happen here.
lol
Sorry if I offended, I was just being a dumb troll!
The search volume index (SVI) of stock tickers have shown to contain predictive power for future returns in many studies. See for instance [Da et al. \(2011\)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2011.01679.x):

> An increase in SVI predicts higher stock prices in the next 2 weeks and an eventual price reversal within the year.

I'm not trying to say that DD can skipped, but search volume can definitely contain useful information. Also, Bloomberg has a measure of attention on their terminal (using search frequency) that relates to stock returns as well (see [Ben-Rephael et al. (2017)](https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article-abstract/30/9/3009/3830159)). 
Like it or not, most people initially get in because of the price movements. While this recent movement has been big in TA terms, average person on the street is still going on "I heard it died, look the price is tanking." Google searches will fly up once we start moving closer to ATH.
Equities aren't making parabolic moves due to the hysteria of the general public.
In terms of tech I don’t mean the underlying code, more so the potential applications of the tech, which I are many and varied. I get your point though, the average person doesn’t care about the underlying architecture of the internet. 
Agreed... waiting patiently as can't afford any more losses for now. Only problem is night time here and I need to go to bed soon and there is every chance I may miss some action :-(
Thanks mate. I got it now and yeah I will take your advise, not claiming.
Claim is good if you opened position on margin, price went up and you decided to keep the coins longer and move them to wallet so you don't have to close and buy.

Also the other way, if you're at loss and don't want to close position but you decided to hedge, you can claim to keep the coins and close your long and start a new short.
OK, it sounds like the best option but still feels frustrating
Serious question... Do any big traders do like a twitch livestream of their trading?

The internet has everything, so I won't be surprised...
 https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/4f9rop/what_dose_user_name_checks_out_mean/
I'm new to reading charts - what time frame are you drawing the flag on? And what's the bottom of the flag? Looking at the 4hr I want to say it's ~7820? Or looking at 15m ~7930? But I don't really know how to draw them.
What if my risk profile is go all-in @ 100x leverage?
Outliers happen, happens for bearish posts as well. Do some decent posts get downvoted and some empty posts get upvoted? Sure, occasionally. Is that fair? No. Does it happen to both bears and bulls? Yes. 
Would be cool if you could. I'm being lazy and guesstimating based on what I've seen + partial candle movements :)
I also upvote the "this doesn't look good for bulls/bears" guy on sight as well. 
This is much closer to the truth than something Bruce Fenton puts out.  Bitcoin has little or nothing to do with changing the structure of society, it is a "killer app" for value transfer.
tldr
Thing is, that isn't really a major issue anymore. Quick example - I use Revolut when I travel. I have the money in GBP (my local currency) and when I use my card abroad it converts it with very, very low fees. Honestly I don't bother exchanging any more before I go anymore because the rates with Revolut are so low that I don't see the point. Much more useful than Bitcoin where in reality very few merchants are going to accept it.
You just named one of many reasons Bitcoin > fiat.  That day is coming.  Once upon a time, people clung to their fax machines because they didn't understand/were scared of email.  Bitcoin is at roughly that stage.
Bruce Fenton is a nut job cultist.  These freaks post all this wacky stuff and then normal people see and they think everyone involved in Bitcoin is some kind of kook.  Bitcoin needs more rational people who can point out the actual benefits instead of trying to promote the nonsense in that tweet. 
I hugely agree with the sentiment of that tweet, and there's been a lot to be extraordinarily grateful for given what bitcoin has managed to show to us so far... but at the risk of downvotes I disagree that BTC is the exact long term solution to the world's financial woes. There are a couple problems but the most prominent one is that it's far too concentrated; and in that sense it would worsen the concentration of wealth and power that is a plague on the world fiat system now if it were to completely replace it.
Quite simply that I can't see a need for it for the vast majority of people.

I get that it being decentralised is awesome, but the typical person simply does not care. The tax burdens of using and exchanging bitcoin are enough to scare many off, but also just the fact that the network simply cannot cope with anywhere near the number of transactions that say, visa or MasterCard do, even with Segwit or an increased blocksize. Lightning Network is interesting but nowhere near ready.
Hey, don't ask me.
Very possible in Bitcoin world. But I won’t expect a big crash (say below 7.2-7.3k) at this stage as that will really harm the sentiments n confidence achieved in last couple of days.. 
I honestly see this as the most likely scenario. Sellers not wanting to push through 7800 or 7900 yet but I think the resistance from 8.2 - 8.3 will be too much. From there we would fall out of a rising wedge with a target of 7600. Entering a short at 8150-8300 after closing out an earlier one from 8100 -> 7885
love the green candle seconds after he posted this lol

> This is what happens every time so far, sellers wait for the highest price to unload and it crumbles in a day or two.

Agreed, I think it crumbles even faster, sometimes in a matter of hours.

> I want to see it test lower levels before moving up

Didn't we already tested that multiple times in 6500 range? 

> Adam and eve doesn't happen with a v shaped pump, it's gotta look round

Correct, V shape just indicates impulse buying. However, as you said, I am actually seeing a round / u shaped buying pattern, I have been seeing it if I zoom in to 6 hours or so.

What I feel is that the price has already made a u-turn and it is going up, but may be it will not go up as quick as it did last time. There still are some trader who are closing their positions with a small increase in price but the number has reduced.


Should i hedge here sloppy
look at any contract that has a loop in it. i bet every contract has at least one loop. 
Man that shit must get annoying. Making a negative username is such low hanging fruit for idiots on reddit 
people have very short memories... 
Love it - thanks bud 
Ahhhh, thank you. I probably really should have figured that out myself
Yeah I also think either one of the scenarios is going to happen.
Thanks!
Honestly? Never done it before. One person said it doesn't affect the price that much but pumps the ratios meaning you get more of the other coins.

I'm not into BNB for a quick scalp though. More long term holding with this. If the price does go crazy via a PnD or similar I'll cash out for a re-entry later on.
This is a great question. I have not seen a huge increase in value from coin burns, which is comparable (in the corporate world) to a share buyback. I think they’d be better off paying out a dividend.
Ethbtc can go sideways if both go up.
Already got stopped in my ethusd long. The kickstart failed, will only trust the ones where eth starts dumping first.
Now will see if i put extremely tight stops on my long or let it go to 7750 or so before stopping it. Its been a boring day, cant imagine months of this on ethusd Last year. I have zero patience and like a gamble now and then. Will never be a good trader, but its play money so no biggie (even though i hate losing, but am learning to control it better thanks to crypto)
Some overleveraged were for sure. And that's the point of a squeeze.

I don't know. There was a time when buying bitcoin felt like investing in a project, and news about fundamentals actually moved the ticker. Now it's just sort of game theory about other investors, and, fundamentals seem to have no effect (e.g., news about lightning didn't affect the market at all.) People should probably be shitting their pants if their main arguments for growth are (a) idiot gamblers are gunna get squeezed, (b) some richer investor seems to be pushing things in this direction.
I think this is good analysis and I'll be first to admit I didn't give the number of shorts enough credence. I still think it's ridiculous to act like ~5 days of flat and then a $1200 price move in 30 minutes is just business as usual. Maybe it's fairest to say that that that kind of action works well for some trading styles and not others. It sounds like your approach works well. I know for sure my style (medium time frame swings) feels almost useless, although it historically has worked pretty well. I think people are probably just salty because of that.
Exactly how I see it playing out, though maybe earlier at 8300

Makes sense.. thanks 
I have it drawn like this on the hourly. Note that this isn't  authoritative, just my take

Whatever timeframe the flag shows. 

There can be a flag on the 15 but no flag on the hour or vice versa. 
You do you ;)
tl;Dr I fell for it cause gainz

btc straight up does not work on  large scale right now, it's not even close. any significant amount of people actually trying to use it and it completely falters under its own weight 
I don't really see how that statement is wacky or nonsense. It's revolutionary and if you can't see that then you will never understand the true value of Bitcoin (hint: it's not just money). Maybe you are here just for the lambos but I'm here for what Bitcoin means to the world.

Let me simplify it for you. Bitcoin allows you to participate in the world's first global, instant(BCH), permission-less, value exchange system. I can send anyone in the world any amount of money and we don't need a third party (bank) to verify the transaction. I can store value in a Bitcoin address without needing a bank or paying bank fees and no one can seize or lock up my money in any way for any reason. This is earth shattering. Also no entity controls the supply and it can't be printed (inflated) in order to fund bombings, wars or policies I don't agree with. 

When fees are low people who could never have access to banking now have a way to store value in a way that is cheap and fully under their control. Currently the people who control the money supply have the power and Bitcoin has the potential to take that power away from them and give it back to the people. 

This won't stop with currency and value, it will spread to voting, government, corporations, facebook, twitter, everything. Decentralization is coming to everything whether you like it or not. Bitcoin and the security and immutability it provides through its massive mining network will lead the way. You don't have to agree with me and you can call us all nut jobs but it will change every aspect of your everyday life whether you agree or not. 
That’s exactly why the sentiments of the past few days are silly.  3 months of nothing but down from 19.8k.  Then 15 minutes of pump from 7k to 8k and everyone is bullish again?  Definition of FOMO.  There will be blood.   
That's the point of a bear market...
we don't have 40k longs to squeeze down to where we were.
Rekt!
Hahahaha wow
I think a short above $8k is fine but a new local high and who knows, I'd close. Still think it'll have trouble at $8.5k tho. 

This buying  could go on for a while again, so who knows
loops doesn't mean turing complete..? or am I misunderstanding

Incorrect. Many contracts have no loops

ERC20 contracts for isntance have no loops
TIL loops make a language turing complete.
Sometimes I regret it.  But the name does stand out and is memorable, so I have that going for me.  ;)
I know we're getting off topic, but I'd consider selling a chunk of your BNB sooner rather than later.  Last quarter, the price rise was all before the burn was actually announced.  Once they made the announcement, the price remained stagnant.  I sold for a nice profit at that point because I didn't see it going up from a fundamental standpoint, and it sank soon after.
Not based on the BTCUSD shorts chart, no, they weren't.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/3VIUL4z6/
I don't like that this is true, but all trading is a form of pyramid scheme in which you are trying to sell to a greater fool. 'Investing' in stocks is the same assuming you're expecting a rise in price that's not perfectly correlated to a rise in free cash flow from operations. And even then, you have to ask what the company does and how that rise in earnings is generated. The laws of thermodynamics prohibit an exponential increase in anything that consumes energy without something else being degraded.
Yeah I agree with /u/shredder_two9's reply, and it's funny, I actually share your complaint. Where I disagree is that it's basically "natural" and your disillusion with it is natural as well. Two things:

One, news and fundamentals only go so far. The overall market trend tends to be stronger, unless the news/fundamentals are truly earth-shattering. We see this in both strongly-trending bear markets and bull markets. In a bear market, good news doesn't help the price go up ("Overstock accepts BTC!" and "Winklevoss twins file for ETF!") and in a bull market, bad news is quickly shrugged off ("China bans exchanges!" and "Flippening!" and "Bitcoin Cash!").

Two, I share your gripe about traders running the show. But it's kind of inevitable. It's first-order vs. second-order thinking, ie. "does this price line up with fundamentals" vs. "does this price line up with what other traders/investors think about the price." That second-order thinking contributes to bubbles and busts, overpriced/underpriced, etc. but is much more profitable than the first (creating a sort of Tragedy of the Commons situation).

Would be be willing to describe your trading style in more detail? I ask because I'm a swing trader too and I feel (though I don't have a huge sample size of trades to judge, so I could still be proven wrong) that I'm doing a bit better lately, at those times when I feel like I can guess what the better move for whales/exchanges is, and then mimic that.
Somehow that's worse :/
I see, thank you! - could it not also be drawn from either the big green candle 4/13 AM and the big red candle 4/13 PM or are those not considered big enough rallies/declines?
I love how you've been downvoted for this but you're absolutely right. Even with the improvements of Segwit the fact is that Bitcoin's capacity for transactions is absolutely tiny. 

I'm sure Lightning Network will do a lot to help but I just cannot see the average person using it any time soon. It just isn't user friendly right now.
If you actually watch the ecosystem you will realize many of same problems still exists.  In most cases you are just trading one problem for another.  Bitcoin, decentralization, and immutability is only valuable for a few specific use cases and they are tools, not religions.  Bitcoin has nothing to do with facebook, twitter, etc. and nobody is going to mine a voting blockchain if they don't get something in return.  The people making these claims have no idea how Bitcoin actually works or its purpose and they just repeat stuff they read on the web.  As for many of your points it is mostly a repeat of the Bitcoin Wiki which was written by cultists who don't live in reality.

The part about ending wars is one of the stupidest claims you will ever see about Bitcoin.  First of all it depends on the entire economy based on bitcoin (which, of course, is technically impossible).  Next, even if it were true it also means you can't borrow to fund things like roads and hospitals.  You really have to be nuts to think that Bitcoin will somehow end wars, affect borrowing by governments, or have any effect on inflation.  You can start a new coin or fork in a few minutes and you have inflation.  How could you possibly think any of those claims have any validity?
Yeah 8.3 id dip the fuck out and try to re-enter 8.4-8.7. Just dont want to burn capital right here but if this goes back to goblintown ill be fuming at missing an 8k+ short.

Ill think about partially hedging at 8.1 i suppose.
Turing complete means you can implement a simulation of a turing machine https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness . You need looping for that.

Anyway the point is you can do more with ethereum smart contracts than you can with bitcoin script. This comes with its own tradeoffs. Ethereum is less secure, more resource intensive and there is greater centralization there. 
exactly!

The best is when an array you are looping through becomes so long that the block gas limit is lower than the required gas to execute the loop
while(1)

{

make_a_programming_language();

}
So it did, that being said, same for Eth as well and a few other coins. Did anything happen then?
Sure, I definitely think its natural, too. And I agree with your account of the underlying cause. Still, I think it's insane that people on here are acting like this is just how things have always been, and fail to recognize that this situation is caused by extreme lack of volume. They see a BGD, play the pump and dump game, and think its just going to continue up forever. In reality, it is an extremely bad sign that the market can be moved so much by single players or stop losses. It reflects exactly what you would expect intuitively since the new year: a lot of money has left this space. It really blows my mind that people think that these kind of shit dynamics signal a reversal.
Ya, I wouldn't be surprised earlier. Thanks for thoughtful analysis. 
I try to predict movements on the daily to weekly time-frame based on the daily chart, associated indicators, and longer term support/resistance lines. Then once I've identified the likely trend, I look for good entries and exits in that direction on smaller time frames. In the past, I've relied on breakouts/breakdowns from classical TA patterns, but those have become less reliable recently, as we are all bitching about here lol
Also [this one](https://www.twitch.tv/communities/cryptocurrency)
Ya, that's possible, thanks for pointing that out. I always try to keep multiple interpretations in mind, and then let subsequent price action dictate the probabilities of each option.
I guess we'll see. I just think you suffer from lack of vision. Basically all I have done for the last 5 years is study Bitcoin and blockchain technology and I fully understand it and what is possible. Of course that doesn't mean it will happen but at least now the possibility exists. 

Blockchain has the power to remove almost all the shill accounts from facebook and twitter, knowing you are dealing with a real person and reducing the massive media manipulation that occurred during the last U.S. election. This same applies to voting. There doesn't have to be a "voting blockchain" it can be run on the Bitcoin blockchain or another blockchain (Civic?) 

If you say "no one will mine a voting blockchain" I think it is you who doesn't understand how Bitcoin actually works. People will mine any blockchain that is profitable, that's why Bitcoin and blockchain work, they are based on a primal human trait: greed.  

As far as wars they can not be funded on taxation alone. Governments have to print money to fund their massive war machines. It's true we may never get to the point where Bitcoin has taken over so much that this is not possible, but at least we finally have a way to see that day and I'm optimistic we may get there. Remember nearly every FIAT system in history that has ever existed has failed: [https://dailyreckoning.com/fiat-currency/](https://dailyreckoning.com/fiat-currency/) The current FIAT system will fail, particularly because we have something better now, it's just a matter of timing, may not be in our lifetime. Saying it can never happen is a great way to get suddenly surprised by a change in tide. I'm sure when the U.S. Constitution was being written there were plenty of people back in England who said they were "cultists who don't live in reality" 

Never underestimate the ability of the people to take the power back!

Yeah, best short rn would've been one from $8150-8250. 

I have a small feeling this is blowing past $9k just cause bear markets take forever. 
Yes it just sounded like you were implying looping necessitates Turing completeness
TBH, I don't know, as I stopped trading alts in January.  I just recall seeing on the Binance subreddit that there were people (mostly noobs, I assume) who were confused as to why the price didn't explode after the coin burn.
I agree with you about the BRDs/BGDs, it's obvious that they signal a shift in market behavior, but average daily volume is only about 15% lower than when we were (briefly) in the 7000s on the way up - and that was at the point when the chart had already gone parabolic. Average daily volume in June of last year was significantly lower than where we are now.

Now, has the volume shifted radically away from retail investors to whales/institutions? Maybe, I'm not exactly sure and I don't look closely enough at order books to attempt to make an assessment. But this was always an asset whose ownership is extremely concentrated, and its design combined with trends in miner ownership guarantee that that problem will worsen over time. If you think carefully about the relatively few people who hold the majority of BTC, their interests are to concentrate their wealth even further at the cheapest possible prices when the trends enable that, and then over time slowly trickle out enough of it to keep the retail public interested but never enough to let the price fall significantly (after their accumulation phase). Whether or not that strategy will succeed is still an open question because longer term the suckers do have to line up to buy it. And given the plethora of alts out there now, there are plenty of other choices, though most of them have the same flaws and some worse ones too.
Yeah, a lot of the indicators have broken down.

Lately I am focusing a lot on the relationship between volume and price movement.
lol.  You are the kind of person who is inhibiting the growth of Bitcoin because you make Bitcoiners look like ignorant nut jobs and people don't want to get involved with people like you.  You are not taking power back from anything, you are trading one set of problems for another.  

For instance, mining a voting blockchain is not profitable and decentralization is too expensive to solve all kinds of third world problems.  Birtcoin has nothing to do with removing shill accounts from private platforms and the blockchain is too expensive to use for all sorts of things not related to normal transactions.   The points you are making are total nonsense and you obviously have never read the stuff the developers discuss and you never took the free Princeton University course.  You are just repeating stuff from r/bitcoin and bitcointalk.org.
>but average daily volume is only about 15% lower than when we were (briefly) in the 7000s on the way up 

I think a lot of the apparent volume is wash trading. If it was real, there wouldn't be as much chop and slippage as we are observing. Here's an interesting recent piece on that topic: https://cointelegraph.com/news/volumes-on-most-major-cryptocurrency-exchanges-are-fake-or-inflated-study

>Whether or not that strategy will succeed is still an open question because longer term the suckers do have to line up to buy it.

This is a great point. I guess I'm thinking there doesn't seem to be enough suckers to hold our current price range. Or at least I'm thinking that BGDs shouldn't be unquestioningly interpreted as bullish, when their underyling causes seem to be closely tied to market frailty. But who knows, I might be overestimating how much it would take to drag a bunch of people back into the market. 
> I think a lot of the apparent volume is wash trading.

Yeah, good point. More so than in the recent past though? There was a lot of speculation that Bitfinex drove the parabolic runup with Tether printing so it's unlikely to be new. However I really don't know enough to say.

>I guess I'm thinking there doesn't seem to be enough suckers to hold our current price range.

I watched from the sidelines of this market for several years and missed a large part of the rally. The computer scientist in me really liked the concept but said, I don't care if the number of bitcoin minted is fixed, anyone can copy this damn code, rename it, and make their own network, and therefore the potential number of 'coins' is limitless, so I'm not going to throw my money at it. But it turns out I grossly underestimated demand for what has become an entirely new asset class. Evidently a fair number of people on the planet want a way to take their money out of the normal system without having to purchase and hold physical metals. Again, I'm not sure this will last, but that seems to be at least a part of the story here.
