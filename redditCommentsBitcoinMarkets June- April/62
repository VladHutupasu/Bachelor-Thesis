[Daily Discussion] Monday, April 02, 2018 -- TITLE
#New post: [\[Daily Discussion\] Tuesday, April 03, 2018 →](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/899akt/daily_discussion_tuesday_april_03_2018/)
I just wanted to say a quick thank you to all involved here.  I wish I had followed this thread when I bought my first BTC at 11250.  I've been in financial services for 18 years, mostly the volatile ones, hedge funds, managed futures etc.  The only thing I can equate BTC with is the most volatile of commodity futures managers, that somehow always end up on top.  I was not part of the mob, I invested because some folks I trust in the tech sector had been trying to get me to invest for years. They are all still extremely confident in BTC.  Luckily, I'm only down 25 or so percent.

I'm here for the long haul, I love the technology, we are building a blockchain based solution that our clients need and have asked for. It will solve a major problem for them.  Despite the losses, I have thoroughly enjoyed every minute of my involvement.

Anyway, this thread has saved me alot of money the past few days.  I've never traded before, but may try my hand at it given it looks like the only way to make money in this environment is on short movements

I'll be around,but just wanted to give my appreciation for the first legit thread I've found in Reddit land. 
I see a lot of comments here about "people who bought in/after December" and what is going through their heads right now. I personally know four people who bought at various points from $6,000-$17,000. All four of them invested a few thousand dollars, which is about two weeks pay for them, so, not insubstantial, but also not life-changing. None of them obsess over the price, and none have sold or plan to sell. I'm sure a lot of people have already sold at a loss, but the sentiment I hear from them is, "well it's already down X%, and I don't need the money, so I may as well ride this out." Just want to point out that there are a lot of people, including those who are in the red, who won't be selling any time soon, regardless of price. Just some first hand anecdotal evidence from a random internet dude.

Edit: I will also note that none of them have added any BTC during this downtrend, which I also find interesting.
To be fair there’s probably been too many fake outs at this point to be able to spot a genuine reversal at least before it’s too late to truly benefit from. 

I am now realising just how difficult this game is to play 
Fun fact: The Dow Jones index is now at early november levels while Bitcoin is also at early november levels. If you had invested a dollar in a Dow Jones ETF and one in BTC at 3 november you would be almost flat today. 
After a couple of bull flags since yesterday, we bounced off the downtrend line from $8K this morning. It will be interesting to see how this plays out.

I've continually added to my short as we've spend time peeking above $7K but never breaking $7.2K. CA @ $7010 now. A whole lot of time and funding fees to get an entry I could have beat less than an hour ago, but sometimes that's the name of the game. I was about to flip to Sep futs, except now the funding fee is actually paying shorts. I'll keep holding it for now.

Also added to my June futs long yesterday on that massive drop. CA @ 6440.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/WyQ7FTGC/ 

We've got a very slight ascending wedge forming off these bull flags. The continued failure to break 7300 leads me to believe we haven't yet bottomed. This whole range of 6800-7100 is chop city, but I'm pretty happy to be holding a short near the top and a long from well below the bottom.

Good luck all. 
Take this with the usual disclaimers...

My trusty set of Moving Averages are aiming at crossing on the 1 hour chart from the downside, maybe within 2 to 3 hours. Now since the 25th March we have been under the line, as it were, and have yet to cross back over. 

On average when they cross from the downside back up, we get an increase in price of around 4 to 5% lasting between 1 day to a week on average. The increase can be a lot more though.

I'll watch and see if they cross over in the next 2 to 4 hours hopefully. 

A 5% boost though would see us cross the 7200 border many are keen on seeing broken, so we'll see. It could signal some short term relief.

As a caveat to that, if we reject the crossover... we drop a large amount. The last few rejections have seen us drop around 10 to 12%, so here's hoping that doesn't happen.
Scaling into longs from here. No rush. I see too many triumphant noobs about their shorts. They’re gonna learn the hard way
4 short squeezes in a row now. Let's see if we can break 7200.
Despite Bitcoin Price Drop, Adoption is Strong in Japan and South Korea

https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/04/02/despite-price-drop-bitcoin-adoption-is-strong-in-japan-and-south-korea/
Any comments about [this formation](https://imgur.com/a/wGdnj) with a surprising number of contacts on both lines?
Few things of interest:

* Whale games on GDAX...a large player or two is unloading a lot at these levels via walls, apparently expecting the bottom to fall out of the market shortly and/or trying to put fear into the market. Countered so far by a few bull whales gobbling up the asks (myself included) and even throwing up a few bid walls...but so far more ask walls keep showing up. Interesting to see how this unfolds, tune in to watch as it is still going on.
* The GDAX action is notable because both sides seem genuine and serious this time...often large walls are just spoofs, or market makers offering liquidity at stupid discounts/premiums. Right now this appears to be a battle for the heart of the downward sloping resistance line, and will likely result in a large pump or dump in the coming hours as one side capitulates.
* OKCasino Quarterlies have gradually risen to meet spot prices recently, which is notable and interesting. Traditionally they trade at a discount during down trends. They popped above GDAX and Bitfinex a few minutes ago, and while they're back under now, it's not by much and they are holding their own, complete with a large bid wall at $6.9k to encourage enthusiasm. Futures traders might be getting in while the getting is good, in terms of longs, because another pop upwards from here can easily result in a large and persistent premium on Quarterlies. It might not be an actionable signal, but it's important sentiment-wise. What do the futures experts on here think?
if this thing really bottomed out over 6k with this bearish sentiment I would be left speechless.
Having a pretty tough week. Got into an accident last friday and cracked my skull open as well as completely shattered my ankle among other life altering injuries. I’m lucky to be alive and I will be needing surgery on wednesday and after that will be out of work for at least 8 weeks. Sad to say i’ll likely have to sell my long term coins at these shitty prices in order to maintain my ability to pay for my necessary life expenditures. I’m so unbelievably sad right now knowing i have to do this, but at the same time i’m still thankful for even having that as an option. 

I’m grateful for all the advice from this subreddit in the past year. Wish everyone the best going forward.
When MSNBC and Tai Lopez show howto short BTC ... that would be the bottom
I honestly don't know whats worse nowadays, the moonbois or the going to $1k bearbois.
I want to believe but my heart been broken so many times before

edit// huh, thats allot of upvotes for an insincere comment. I never stopped believing, we are afterall still yellow on the moon math charts
Seems as though the fuel for a decent pump isn't quite there yet. Was hoping this little burst could have got us to 7200 to test the fib area, maybe we can get there but i'd like to see it happen in the next few hours or I feel we'll fall back down. 

***Update to my 1 hour MA crossover post from earlier..

We are now very close to beginning the cross over phase, as said before, should we successfully cross over - on average we experience around a 4% to 5% increase in price over a few days or so.

Should this crossover reject, expect a sizeable drop in price over the same period, around 10% on average over a period of days. 
Seems like there may be some relief from the downtrend brewing, although that doesn't mean the real bottom is in yet. There's a lot of space for a short-term counter trend at the moment. If it were to unfold, here's how I would measure progress. Starting with the 6h, we can see that the tenkan line (blue) has turned support and we will soon test the kijun (red) resistance. Both the chikou and the kumo give a 7.6k target (approx.) without a trend reversal.

6h: https://www.tradingview.com/x/0RqgLQQs

Much more to be done to translate that same move to the 12h chart. We're toying with the near vertical tenkan line here, but that should flatten out over the next day or two, and I'll look for a similar support and test of the kijun as with the 6h, the targets here are barely higher and more solid (approx 7.8k or above). 

12h: https://www.tradingview.com/x/qIGMA2Si

It'd be an almost identical set of parameters on the daily (note how similar the charts are). The difference here is that if after a multi-week rally we hit the target of 8k, the herd might start to look for further upside, which may only lead to pain and misery. Cloud resistance on this chart is still weak, so there's a huge window to the upside. In addition we're still bullish on the weekly and monthly charts, meaning long term investors might position themselves early for a bullish kumo breakout. The bearish outlook on the 3d would make me exercise caution toward such a scenario. It probably won't play out like that on the daily. There'd likely be a lot of chop which would drag things out and then we'd get 'bogged' down in the as yet unplotted cloud sub-8.5k at best (if we even get that far).

1d: https://www.tradingview.com/x/w3GZB4RF

Bullish daydreams aside, the assumption for now, however, is more downside with mid-term targets as indicated on the axes of the charts here. First the February low, then those of November, and [not shown] September and July. In fact, given that we may get to July before we repeat July's low, I'm not really going to entertain any downside targets that are more than six month's old (ie November low of 5.4k by May, which lines up nicely with the weekly kumo support, February's low by August, etc.).

During the bull market, this would be the “ Consolidation phase “ for the next leg up. God knows where it’s going now 
It feels like we're at a roulette table watching other people play.
Maybe interesting maybe not... People posting what their current trade is, with exit points if they have them planned and general thoughts.

Just to get a feel for where we all are. I'm currently...

LONG from 6845
I automatically exit at 4% profit on the way up, in this bear market, which I hit at 7119. Failing to hit the 4%, I exit when my MA crosses back down.

I'm now waiting for the shorting opportunity when my MA crossovers combined with other jazz gives me the best chance. Probably in a few hours or so i'd think.

My spider sense is going off and between market action and the changes to the site it seemed like it was time to make a more complete update instead of spreading it all out in the daily.

* Going long
* Changes in Market Composition
* Moderate "Buy" Recommendation
* Rainbow Chart Modifications
* Unpublished Noob DCA strategy
* LBC Weekly Global Volume

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/895y1x/moon_math_update/
During the bull run, Coinbase and other on-ramps allowed investors to buy BTC with a credit card. This is now much more difficult, if not impossible for many people. Has anyone considered that the money flowing in now from retail investors should be more "sound" than money coming in during the bull run? I'm not saying we can draw any conclusions here, just a thought about the backing of the fiat flowing in since then. It is, of course, possible to borrow money and buy BTC, but it's not nearly as easy for the average joe. 
Opening a long here ($7,030) with stops below $6,900. 

It's risky, so I'd advise not to follow along. 

Buyers seem invigorated though. 

Edit: still holding
high volume small dump, low volume small climb. Somebody is accumulating really well right now. 
God I have absolutely no idea what the price is doing right now. We can't break up through the pissy resistance we keep hitting in and around 7k, but we have enough strength to not drop lower than a percent or so when it looks like we'll fall.

When this does go decisively in one direction it's either gonna be a big big green dildo or one hell of a blood fest down to the 6600s.

Maybe i'll just call it a day, go to bed later and restart tomorrow after this has resolved itself.



So it seems that many people who got burnt buying at $19k thinking we would continue going up forever, are now going to get burnt once more opening shorts.

Believing this time that BTC is once again the gift which keeps on giving, but through a downward trajectory this time around.  

You couldn't make this stuff up, playing with fire, some will get lucky of course, but when everyone starts to go one in direction, it's usually wise to start heading in the other direction.
It seems everyone is expecting $3k or lower including myself. Usually when everyone thinks something will happen it doesnt. 
Looking at BTCUSDSHORTS most of these ask walls on finex are actually shorts opening. I think this could turn into a big short squeeze if some whales decide to take that guy out. Pretty risky opening a short with 29k shorts already open, or hes protecting his bottom short, which is even riskier.
dow -612..bear market all around
Holy shit these buys on GDAX...
This looks like a really hard fought battle for 7k. But there’s just no volume what so ever... I threw a buy order in there, to help it along... :P

If we wanna see the price go up, then this is where push comes to shove! It ain’t gonna happen if we all stand on the side lines watching ;)
1 april will forever be remembered as the day the based Kraken whale single handed saved bit corns <3

Measures for volatility have not improved. I've considered downgrading the moderate buy recommendation to a hold recommendation, but you should be looking at these recommendations when you're considering your own DCA strategy. Volatility hasn't increased that much and we're still holding in a pattern that has a 65% chance of breaking down. If you're goal is to DCA through a potential dip, and your comfortable with taking initial losses, then this remains a good place to **slowly** add to a position **without leverage**. 

The noob DCA strategy has not been issued because volatility is still too high. If your grandmother has been asking about when it's time to buy bitcoin, this is not the time. There's too much risk that the floor will drop out from under us while weekly BBands are this wide in a bear market. The goal is to make noobs feel good about their investments for months, not scare them away with dwindling fiat value, or the constant looming threat of dwindling fiat value.

## LBC Weekly Global Volume
Local Bitcoin global weekly volume is continuing to keep pace with long-term trends. 1 billion USD a week by the end of 2019 is an unbelievable projection, but that's moderate to conservative based on these data.

We'll probably see these rates of adoption drop as more established and regulated platforms for exchange establish themselves internationally.

Everyone has 1 upvote. Reddit went full commie on us it seems. 
Here's a bullish chart with a technical explanation.
https://www.tradingview.com/x/ui3LtaKO/

essentially price is/was in a down move. The first thing to notice is that the final leg down is shorter than the first leg down.
The oscillator divergence reflects this relationship.

Now the flag structure which ended with the head and shoulders is a huge distribution process. But for such a large amount of work price didn't fall far.

You can see price first tested the break of my marked neckline  and then broke back into the area.

So then why does such a large amount of distribution result in a bullish case?

Essentially for every seller there was a buyer.
This sellers are mid time-frame, the buyers are low and high time-frame. Essentially the distribution is ALSO low and high timeframe accumulation. The low is obvious as price moves up within the distribution.

Now essentially what's happened is that  there's a large amount of high-time frame accumulation paired with that distribution. This is the bullish argument.

I believe the high horizontal line on the chart marked is a key level.


Should the lower time-frame slow down and distribute as it breaks the current high I'd think this level will pose rejection indicating more accumulation needs to take place (or possibly that the higher time-frame may be significantly distributing but this is unlikely considering how low price is), if the approach speeds up then the level will be ignored (I think this will be the case).

So geniuses, WTF happened to straight down to 6k? Even this morning, 9 out of 10 posts were "its about to plummet down". Glad I listened and held off buying.
The price is all over the place, lately. I'm keeping a low leverage, playing the waiting game. I'm hoping that the price sets solid footing in the $6ks, that it behaves as a solid bottom as we chop sideways, avoiding a deeper plunge into the bear market... but it's much too early to tell.

My lines have so far held but damn the buying volume is dead. I still doubt we'll be smashing down before at least another touch of resistance: 12h MACD is flipping bullish and RSI close to being oversold on the daily, which I think will play out in bulls' favor - as long as some buyers are found

(Long) stops at breakeven @6850, 74xx and 78xx for profits and close
precarious position right now. You get the feeling if we dip into the 6975 range again then we'll fall down a few % just like earlier.

There just doesn't seem to be enough strength to break through the resistance line we are currently smacking into it. I'm a bit surprised really to be honest.
The amount of shorts has reached ATHs? 
what does this mean, negative premium almost evaporated on futures contracts? seems bullish but I don't know what to think lately
FWIW.. the last time we saw massive market buy orders on GDAX (like we just saw) was in the mid to high $11.7s during our first attempt at $11.8k after the drop to $6k - you may remember we then quickly plummeted about $1000 over the next few hours. The only other time I can remember seeing that was at $17-17.2k on the bull-trap up to $17.2k - we all know how that one played out. Not saying a massive dump is pending (well maybe..), but interesting to note nonetheless. Does seem to be holding up a bit better than those other 2 instances - they dumped pretty quickly after.  


Ascending bart simpson pretty bullish
**UPDATE on my MA 1 hourly cross over posts from earlier...

The hourly chart is now half way through rejecting the crossover. It's not looking great as it currently stands. 

As previously posted, on average when the crossover is rejected we tend to experience anywhere between a 5% to 10% drop in price over a period ranging from 30 hours to a week if it's particularly bad.

Unless we get a pump within the next few hours to take us up and above 7200 it looks very much to me like we are about to experience a pull back somewhere around 3 to 5%. 

Putting the price in an around 6700 within a day, maybe less. Unsure of the time frame really.


Looks like we are having trouble with the 7200 resistance cluster.
I see that at the monthly chart we got a clear signal for a short entry based on the price action, once this month started trading below last one. Weekly is also still bearish AF. The reversal candle on the daily candle yesterday might bring us a bit higher. but be aware. Higher timeframes > lower ones so im considering this nothing more than some shorts profit taking and a break to reset. Still looking to sell the bounce. 
Right now is good moment to jump onto little bounce, imho. We are flat last 4 days, which is good sign for local reversal trend. Support at 6.5k lasted for a while, which is also a sign to open long, and close shorts, which number is still relatively high. I guess we will be able to make $7800-8000 in 2-3 days in this upcoming bounce. 
My daily analysis looking at:

* Bitcoin's short term ascending channel
* Ethereum's slow drift towards support
* Bitcoin Cash as it continues its bearish move
* Litecoin looking to form a bullish consolidation zone

https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@matthew-analysis/daily-crypto-analysis-2nd-apr-technical-analysis
The significance of this 7200 is ridiculous. If it breaks it, I do say there is a high chance we might see a reversal that could break the bearish trend we formed from 20k (I'm not talking about new ATH though, I think the bear market is a fact). 
We're up against the local downtrend from 24th - actually wicked over it temporarily. So we're either going to drop fairly soon or I might be short-term bullish. (https://www.tradingview.com/x/MjrbPQQP/)
Hmm...how is this formation we are seeing now any different than what we just saw during the weekend?? Looks almost identical.

Only question I guess is how long we stay in this range Before the next move 

Do the ratio of open longs and shorts tell us anything about the next move up /down?
It is going to be a tough fight to get over 7100 

https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/books/USD
What's the logic of "bitcoin how to short" search trends being up is bullish but also "bitcoin how to buy" or just "bitcoin" search trends being up is bullish as well? 

I'm not sure I understand 
# Moon Math Update (addendum)

https://www.moonmath.win

There's been some drift from Azop's original rainbow charts that I corrected today. This happens from time to time. We should be much closer and the charts should be easier to read. I also tightened the 2017 trend chart.

We're solidly in the lower green quadrant of Moon Math charts. It's a struggle to hold back the noob dca recommendation. Still too volatile, though.

Here's the post from earlier:

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/88woeq/daily_discussion_monday_april_02_2018/dwonfop/

Edit: We're trying to keep the rainbow as close as possible to whatever azop's most recent post is. You can see the chart here:

https://azopstability.com/

Edit2:
> Azop ran his rainbows from a fixed date using a fixed CDPR of about 0.333%. Sometimes he would change the CDPR. Moon Math introduced a dynamic rate based on observed price performance that pretty much always stays in that range. However, the rainbow will drift up and down from Azop's charts because it's not fixed. I'll correct the rainbow so it more accurately represents his latest chart when major drift becomes obvious or on request.
>
>tl;dr; the rainbow needed to be moved up to keep it consistent with /u/azop's vision.
This kinda feels like whales trying to trap shorts tbh. Really weird price action. Books instantly fill up on both sides. Not sure what to make of it, but I think we're going down anyway
Okay so on alien blue I'm seeing everyone has only 1 upvote and I can only see like half of all comments. Pretty sure reddit is having issues or the app is 
The little engine that could.. 
Spoofy working overtime today
Well that was interesting. Over 1000 coin volume on GDAX in the last 5 minutes.
Starting to think I should've closed the last bit of that short from 7k...
Last 4 days have been insane, made my best trades ever on these chops.

Mostly long 6.7k close and short 7.1k,rinse and repeat,  leverage 5x up to 25x when the moves intensifies.

Up more than 400% lol, compounding every time.

Giving up on leverage until we really dump. Debating hodling or cashing out. 

But definitely getting out of bitmex before doing a stupid move.

Gl trading gents.
SPY is fucked, Dow is (getting) fucked, BTC is fucked, ETH is really fucked...

How's the next 2 years gonna turn out..?
1h and 2h and soon 4h ma crossing to the upside maybe looks quite good https://www.tradingview.com/x/LarHNtOm

And also the 4h candle after the big drop has a nice size , so first target here is 7200 then  7800 where the long long term support trend is

Longing from 7063 with stops below 6850
Well most of the other cryptos are still quite overvalued. Would be nice to clean up and finish the job before run forward. Seeing EOS, Cardano, Stellar, Tron as billion dollar projects is painful. Just means people aren't really in despair yet. 
Really tempted to go long here. Overall sentiment is worst then bearish, it's fomo shorting.

Yesterday we reached a point where they were only 1.2k BTC left in funding on finex, that's fucking nuts.

There is a difference between a bearish sentiment and an inverse fomo on leverage.

When this shit will pop, it will be like the 20k top but the inverse way with some sick wicks.

Going short here is like going long at 17k, the reverse will be brutal. You next best move is longing the corn.

We just had some fud with SEC, so there might be another leg down. I'm sure that practically no one will catch the bottom. So My guess is a long between 6.6k and  5.8k with 1x to 3x to avoid liquidation. Will adjust target depending on the action.

final goodbye kiss of 7k before another drop?
1m by 2020 tho
10x long. 8x stake @7,001. I think we're in a position where the scenario bears have been trading off of is in jeopardy of being invalidated and we're near the bottom of the range where a move like that would trigger. Not planning on being able to sleep, but I'm probably going to have to leave this open longer than I want. This is a high risk high reward trade.

Further, if bear TA is invalidated I think we're going to see a lot of traders, as whole, exit the market. A large bulk of traders are probably net bearish on BTC and will stay out of the market until there is a framework they can use to trade against. That should take a long time to work up to.

My sense is also that fundamentals are signalling that BTC is oversold.

Moon Math is indicating that the time is right for the market to reverse back up.

Waiting for $7.3k before thinking this is even a medium term reversal. 

Sentiment in here practically matches RSI hidden bearish divergence: price is hardly moving up but buyer sentiment is as high as it was at $8-9k. 

big hidden bearish divergence on 1-6h that won't be invalidated until we break $8.6k for 4h, 8k for 6h. 

It's definitely possible, which is why I'll be watching $7.3k and $7.5-7.8k very closely, but I personally believe the short squeeze/bounce everyone is expecting already happened with $7.3k to $9k (25% move in 3 days). 

I don't think anyone is really accounting for how bearish that rejection was.

A move up to low $8k wouldn't be surprising at all, but I don't think this bounce is as inevitable as everyone here thinks. 

I agree sentiment here is unified in being incredibly bearish until we move up about 2-3% and then people begin talking about a reversal. 

I think the chances of a run-up here is quite high compared to before- I just don't think it's as inevitable as others do. BTC loves to trend longer than anyone expects. And it frequently rewards top longers. Why not bottom shorters? ;) 

The longer this sideways action continues without moving down, the more I think a short term bottom is in though. Overall, less bearish than before, but still bearish. 

Good luck out there! Set a plan and don't get chopped up!

If we would go up again to let's say 8k. Would that make a valid double bottom?
Could we be breaking out from the harsh downward channel we were in from March 24th? [Chart](https://imgur.com/a/TCBa4)
got stopped out on my 7060 long at 6897, lowest drop was 6880. Now we are recharging for the move I wanted to catch initially it seems,  have a breakout trade at futures 7100 buy  if this moves up

DJIA getting hammered, down another 500. Don't see it avoiding a bear this year
Hm... Lets just hope BTC does not go Rhodium's way http://www.infomine.com/ChartsAndData/GraphEngine.ashx?z=f&gf=110574.USD.ozt&dr=max

Seems like a good lesson in humbleness and humility.. Bull run to 10k, downer to 1k and staying flat for the next decade.
Caught between a 500 coin wall nobody really wants to test to see if it's real and a resistance line nobody really wants to buy above and when they try invisible walls get placed.

Somethings gonna give and I have no idea what.

Who else thinks this bounce is fake and it's coming down soon? Haven't seen this many fake buy walls in a while. Market doesn't seem to take the bait very convincing.
Is anyone able to offer me advice with using leverage on Bitmex? I've got my head around the concept but having trouble in practice.    

I've been experimenting by using the [Bitmex Testnet](https://testnet.bitmex.com) to place some trades. Unfortunately when I've placed a leverage trade they don't seem to be operating correctly. For instance, I went long with 5000 USD (approximately 0.72 BTC) at 100x leverage (don't worry, I will never actually do this in practice) with an entry price of $6979 USD and an exit price of $7027.5 USD.     

Now for a trade like that I would expect to have made a profit of approximately 0.4927 BTC but my profit was actually 0.0037 BTC  which is closer (but still undershooting) to what I'd expect to get if I was using no leverage? Obviously I'm doing something incorrectly but I'm not sure what. [Here's a screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/htTZA) of another trade I just made with the exact same specifications. Maybe someone can tell me what I'm doing wrong here?   
I know this might be a little of topic, but perhaps someone on here knows the answer. Is it possible to source Hourly - Daily Price data for Top 10 Cryptos? I.e. could i get pull this into excel from an online source.
My 7060 long doesn't feel so good anymore, was hoping to catch a bigger move to the upside but the falling wedges people posting here also looks quite probable. Moving upp my stop  loss to just below the last 15m bull flag and will then wait for better times if getting stopped out

On the other hand moving averages on 4h is converging towards the upside, so that could  fuel a move

I have a mining question.  So the approximately 1800BTC mined daily , all of this has to be sold?  And these are sold to the exchanges and not in the open market.  
How crazy is it to set a stop-loss buy order at ~7340? If it breaks upwards it feels like we’ll blow way past it, and then I’ll at least capture _some_ of the upside.

I’m not sure I like the risk profile of opening something right here...

Now bear flags break up. Wonder if bull flags will too. I cant wait to exit this silly zone. 
Reading this forum is depressing cause during the current phase people act depressed like bitcoin won’t hit ath for years if ever... people say it’s stuck below 5k for a LONG time. Thing is... if bitcoin randomly ran up to 13k for no reason over the next week... the same people would start saying how it’s gonna he worth 60k in 6 months.
Going short @ 7100 for a swing trade. 

Also: The sub daily feels like it did in November.

5 minute BBands are tightening up a lot at the moment so i'd expect movement either direction soonish.

We are also sitting right on the resistance line from 24th March at roughly 8960, we've bounced and rejected this line a number of times so if we break down from here I expect a reasonable drop.

Likewise if we can break above it, should be a decent rise to at least 7200.
[deleted]
I noticed a pattern on this steps, so far working like clockwork.

Google trends is down, spot volume is down, overall interest and sentiment is in the gutter. These are not 'buy signals', people are not fomo'ing into NOT giving a damn about crypto. This is genuine dis-interest and lack of interest is not a buy indicator no matter how many of your grandfather's are on bitmex shorting 0.5BTC on 10x leverage. 

Also, not all or even a majority of the money that left the space is likely to be looking to get back in at a cheaper price. Falling knives don't incite fomo for retail investors, it will just validate to them their opinion that Bitcoin is a scam. Grandma buying at 17k and panic selling at 12k isn't thinking "damn I can't wait for cheaper BTC". 
Bull collapse is imminent. I just wonder how many people didn't learn their lesson at 9.2 and 8.2 and 7.3.

If you don't know, now you know. But will you learn this time? 

Probably not, have fun longing the 6k bounce to 6.5. 
Up until last night the chart action was very similar to Sunday the 18th March (Sunday vs Sunday) just that it was 1k lower.

5k in two weeks?
So Bitmexico is the new Kraken. 8/10 times when there is some action the system is overloaded

and here was a fun post reinforcing the current "everyone is shorting" narrative btw https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/890xc5/best_websites_to_margin_trade_and_short/

and another https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/88xw5k/need_urgent_help_to_make_a_decision_from_a_rekt/

> I entered short at the bottom 6480 of btc, went all in, with high leverage. And second mistake is I did not cut loss or set up stop loss. so

Just to be clear, I do not wanna point out those posters as bad or something, they are just examples of what some people here talk about
I open a leveraged short and Bitcoin instantly pumps. I could have waited literally 5 minutes.

Looking at the daily, we're coming off a TD 9 with a pretty decent reversal candle. We also seem pretty over extended, with 8 out the the last 11 days being down days. So some relief here in the coming days seems in order.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/6OJPxLIo/

Looking at the 4h, next resistances seem to be just just about everything above 7,2, with 7,5k, 7,8k, and 8,1k being lines to watch, imo.

All in all this bounce doesn't feel very convincing and i'm not expecting us to test the downtrend line until we get a cleaner, more energetic bounce, probably at a lower low. Breaking 8,1k would be cause for reassessment.

With all the resistance overhead i expect this to be pretty choppy, so i'll be staying out of position, looking for signs of a reversal back down. Shorting above 7,6 seems like a good bet.

If we can't even break 7,2-7,4k though, this remains bear flagish and i'm pretty sure that lower lows will be coming pretty soon, pretty steeply. Bouncing off 5,9-6k seems likely, seeing how overextended we are. Though i see the next real support coming in off 4,9-5,1k, so not sure how much of a bounce it would be.
Looks like that Krown guy is about to livestream thought I'd share he as he's helped me a ton https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OKUQ37lP3Y
Being at the top of the wedge, put shorts in with CA of 6950, this little mini-bear flag on the 5m looks promising to break back down and retest the bottom of the wedge at the least before a wild Kraken whale appears.
[removed]
Cliche or not, these next moments are pretty critical. We're still flirting with the fuzzy downtrend line and I expect fireworks soon. I'm all in at these levels, again, so knowing my luck I'm about to take another bath selling at a loss around $6.9k as everyone panic dumps. But if it explodes upwards, I have a feeling it'll be stronger than most expect...and I'll have a hard time getting into position then. Watching the charts like a hawk. GDAX flatlining at $6,975 between two stubborn whales, might be the canary in the coal mine when one side inevitably breaks. Stay tuned.
#UP!
Christ the GDAX whale games is so frustrating to watch. Just get on with it!!
well to show how ridiculous our current moment in time is..

My MA combination, on the 1 hour chart... the two lines have now been running parallel to each other like train tracks, but never crossing. Been like that now for about 8 hours.

That has never happened before, going back as far as I can see on Trading View, it's not happened before. 

God knows whats happening right now. When this does make a decision either way I expect it to be mammoth
buy volume is dead again, so i think theres only one way this can go
I think one of these bubbles is gonna see another big push from BTC too... it's been too quiet on that front I don't like it. the buble cycle does seem to be in full swing, can't wait to see what 2019/2020 bring  but I don't really plan to do anything in the midterm except accumulate when I can
It's quiet
1000 btc buy order to stop us from falling zzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Wow, discounts on bitmex futures are only about 20 now on both July and Sept. The other day it was about 200.  Maybe a good sentiment indicator? not that futures fluctuations lead the price. 
Out at a loss, as expected. Not looking to reenter yet, will monitor the reaction to this dump.
Does anyone else see a tri-star pattern forming on the 1D?
It is much easier for me to see Bitcoin go 100% up to 14000$ then 50% down to 3500$. Shorters are playing with fire at this point IMO.

Starting to feel a little bullish for the first time since that rally up to $11,700. 

Much like that rally, there were hidden bear divergences all over the place and yet the market maintained its momentum upwards. 

It may not behave similarly this time around, but it has me feeling a certain way. 
https://twitter.com/StockTwits/status/980833337525854210 funny to see of the somehow related BTC and stock markets the last 3 months continues :D

naked short @ 7k. Will gladly buy back in if we can get over 7200 targeting 8.8k. Might add to short under 6.8k
Thank you market for continuously trying to confirm my opinion that BTC under 7k is a travesty...
Kraken whale at it again, driving up the price. Big arbitrage opportunity for bots.
GDAX making a killing right now. Endless number of market buys and sells in the past 2 hours - 57 market buy followed by 28 market sell. No count of market buy / sells of 4-10 BTCs.

Daily Bitcoin Update (4/2/18) + Technical Analysis

https://youtu.be/HzLcWeIbhH8
I take this eerily silence as : nobody has a fucking clue of what is happening now. 
Done trading the chop for today, almost got wrecked multiple times.
Trying to wrap my head around the sentiment shift in the market. I don't put any stock in the trollbox or what high leverage cowboys do, but funding fees have flipped and futures are now trading very near spot. That's a huge sentiment shift, considering futures were almost down to $200 below spot yesterday morning. There's a substantial amount of resistance above us, and we're sitting on 3 drops in 4 days, each a lower low and a lower high. We can't even cross 7100 here without being summarily rejected. 

Part of me wants to dip out of my short here right around breakeven and just hold my long from below. The market movement isn't particularly outside the norm, but I can't fathom what is instilling bullish confidence here. 
https://imgur.com/a/NH3ZV

Looks like a small ascending wedge on the 1h, which should resolve in 6-10h when it meets the 7200 resistance. Upwards movement very jerky and artificial.

so anybody going long or buying here?

what is the end game of these whales really, nothing is organic, everything occurs in bursts and then volume dies for hours on end,

maybe one or two shrimps gon 50x or 20x on their longs here for a quick profit, but toehr than that what is the end game of holding up bitcoin in this narrow range?

confidence to buy here in the 7k range has all but disappeared and ppl ar gettin twitchy to buy as we keep touchin th mid 6's, is this all being done to erode the confidence in buying up btc as we head lower.?

just doesnt make sense. 
[deleted]
Are we going to finish the Bart up and then down right side of the head.
From a technical and sentiment standpoint I am absolutely convinced we are going to move substantially lower over the next few days. One of the few times I agree with MPC on most of his points: https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/ZEmTnH0A-Masterful-Analysis-You-Don-t-Want-To-Miss-BITCOIN-BTC/

Buys set from $6100-$3800, if they hit I will be 75% long with my trading stack. The rest will be reserved to buy sub $2000 if it comes to that. I've only got buys above $6000 because the chance of a double bottom is still alive. Longer term I think if ~$3000 holds I think we could still see new ATH in the next 12 months.

I'm hesitant to short here - when I'm THIS confident, I'm generally wrong. Good luck
Probably going sideways until near the end of the daily close
Nice effort for 7.1, but not yet apparently
bear whales win this round

Target for 6.4 for the wedge support

edit: yes this was premature, bear flag forming, we'll see how it goes
Who would consider this a "true breakdown" of the triangle we were in, and who thinks this is just a reset for another run at the resistance line?

fukkin hell, had to mash that sell tab.

came thorugh. 


Was international for the last week and away from reddit. Happy to see btc dip back down to my buy targets. Will be an interesting few days. 
Yawn, another pump out of nowhere.
According to "The Bitcoin Bearz" trading group on Facebook. 4k is a sure thing. I want to believe them so badly but they are always bragging about getting triple killed on BitmexRekt. Any advice guise?

anybody from a TA point of view explain the unbelievable support 6.5k seems to be providing when 6k is so near?

we have bounced like 4 times now i guess.

7.5k i can understand (and earlier 8.5k was pretty straight forward ) but wtf is 6.5k doing there in the middle of nowehere providing support?

wouldnt it b better if we get to 6k and get some buying momentum from the shorts closing and longs opening rather than this absurd suckers rally we find ourseles in every 300$???

What is the yearly low in 2018? Also, what website gives the official current price?
Bitcoin is too slow and female lately.. 100x long gold. See you all in the caymans
I've had a very similar experience to yours. I was in financial services for ~5 years. I was as an associate at a macro hedge fund and before that was an analyst with alternative asset management at a top U.S. investment bank. I'm now in a different business altogether (corp strat/dev on the west coast).

It's interesting that you equate BTC to commodity futures managers, I have noticed those similarities as well. I also equate it with top forex investors/traders, especially ones who successfully operate in highly illiquid markets. The volatility and lack of "foundation" is what makes this financial product unlike any other in the marketplace. It is BTC's blessing (where moons and lambos are being discussed one week then $0 is being discussed the following week) and BTC's curse (as it makes adoption difficult and scares off mainstream institutional investors).

Like you, I also am here for the long haul. I believe in blockchain, I believe in crypto and I believe a handful of these currencies/tokens have the ability to change global efficiencies within Fortune 500 companies, which will eventually trickle down to the consumer. While I'm down ~30% on my overall portfolio (it includes some altcoins, don't hit me), I've thoroughly enjoyed my involvement here as well.

The first time by it or the resulting bounce?

Good grief.
I can pretty much echo the sentiment of your post. Most of my acquaintances were actually in on Litecoin and Ethereum, and they've either not sold (and also are not adding) or sold either Jan 17th or Feb 5th and haven't mentioned anything since.

I imagine if they looked at prices now they'd feel like they played the market pretty savvy but I don't think they are.
Same for my social circle. Only those trapped in bad finances left ship. The others are still holding (though shitty alts mostly) and don't seem worried about the price fluctuations. The amounts are small, though. A few weeks pay is barely substantial. Let alone two weeks that's pretty much nothing for something you are considering as "investment".

But this is bad sampling. There are millions of users out there. I think average-normie has stopped buying until he is pressured to (ie: price rising + new ath). Buying now is probably only whales.
[deleted]
The december-people I know are just bored, but none of them will sell with a loss and only one in four is continually buying - but not BTC.
It's nice to hear stories of people holding BTC :)
I know you're just sharing anecdotal evidence, but there's probably enough btc between the traders, whales and chopshops to take this thing to any price between $0 to a million without any hodlers' stash coming into play. Hodling is probably at best a personal investment strategy but not that big of a factor in market price in terms of those btcs not being traded.
The casual investor just follows the big trend. They're the first to be slaughtered and the last to make the real big bucks. If pushed, my bet would be that the whales and the real big money are and will continue to accumulate as we head down (if we haven't seen the real bottom). The next bull market could be months or even years away. Casual money not accumulating in these ranges is par the course. It is interesting nonetheless that they're not running out the door to sell. I'm expecting that round of casual money that came in between Oct, Nov, Dec, Jan to exit pretty fast if we ever hit a new ATH.
I know several who bought on margin >10k and we're liquidated. 

They *all* plan to re-buy lower.
I bought at $200. Cashed out enough at $20k ATH that I really couldn’t be bothered about what happens with the rest. All I do is occasionally buy a couple of BTC of any alt that looks like a worthwhile long term prospect. So I probably shouldn’t be in a traders group rubbing everyone’s noses in it, sorry. But maybe this will add a different insight for the more active traders. We’re not all panicky weak hands that bought in December ‘17. I’ll wager a significant portion of holders are in my position and feel fairly dispassionate (but curious) about where it goes from here. 
December buyer here. No intention to sell but have periodically tethered up only on the intention of buying back lower, and have also used a small trading stack to margin trade.

Have also bought almost continually on the way down and continue to do so.

My main stack will not be sold.

More bored than concerned, I can afford to lose the money I invested but the thought of possibly waiting years for profit is somewhat depressing.

I feel worse for anyone who was in major profit at some point who has lost all or a sizeable chunk of it, cause it hurts more when you’ve experienced the highs.
Anecdotal evidence can be a very poor indicator. For example, I personally know 8 millionaires that each bought over $100k of BTC in December. So it is far better to rely on actual data like number of new accounts opened at exchanges between October and December 2017. Measurable and quantifiable statistics! You might even be able to get the averaged stats on the amount of BTC purchased by those new accounts during those months. It would be great to have one of the major coin sites dig up and publish this data.
Buying bottoms works even in a bearmarket like this, as long as you use stop losses carefully and trailing stops to take profits. Just gotta stop trying to long 'breakouts' and it's not too bad. 
It is always too late to catch a genuine reversal. That's why people try to catch the bottom.
i'd expect a truly massive drop together with a big bounce, if it really was a big reversal. something that clearly stands out on the weekly chart volume-wise.

other than that, its most likely short-term bullruns inside a long-term bear trend. really hard to time those.
Played it nicely. Well done. 
Good luck. Keep a close eye on that funding, it's so close to zero rn that it's flipping for me. Becoming quite a good sentiment indicator.
Keep us posted. 
Which moving average are you looking at? 
In korea Investment sentiment is way down but crypto businesses are full steam ahead in building out infrastructure which is very good. 
Bitcoin is how Asia is repatriating many centuries of plundered capital. Think it's a coincidence the creator was called Nakamoto?
I would disagree with the other poster that it's a pennant. It's really more of an extremely shallow descending wedge or a descending triangle. Unfortunately, those are converse indicators, so not a huge help there. 

Edit: on mobile so I didn't see the scale. Yeah, I'm all about longer time frame patterns, but not sure I'd go into the "years" frame looking for flags/pennants. Support/resistance lines sure. I guess those really could just be the top/bottom of a wedge, though. 
I'm not a TA dude, but that giant ass triangle can be drawn in many ways, like for the upper line: could use the 1st top instead of the 2nd top (in that 11.5k double-top), or for the lower line:  1st point is arbitrary and can go higher or lower. Also, triangles should be like up-down-up-down (?). 

But yeah, it looks like some sort of a giant triangle and/or a down-trend channel.
I'd wait a couple days to see if it actually bounces off that bottom. Seems risky drawing from such a recent candle

Left speechless is a rather odd name but I guess anything goes these days

How are you today left speechless?
Very sorry that this has entered your life.

About ten years ago I sustained a back/spinal injury that forced me to experience and endure incredible pain for a very long time. This happened while I was going through a painful divorce. During that time I began to question most of what I had assumed was true about me and about the world I knew. That process led me to read some of Eckhart Tolle's books, which I took quite a bit of comfort in, to a meditation practice, and eventually to an ayahuasca retreat in Peru.

I'm not grateful for the injury but I'm grateful for the path it led me down.

Good luck. Sending you good energy through the ether.
Hang in there. We're all pulling for you.

Life will do this to you more than once. It sucks. I wish there were something that made it better. Do what you can to ignore the pain. Find a friend who can sit with you in silence when you are too angry to talk.

It's normal to hate life in these situations. It will get worse and it will get better. You will get through it.
Man, I usually log out of this account to comment because it's my porn account. But your story just sucks so bad I had to tell you I am super sorry. Nobody deserves to be separated from their coins by a wreck. Get better soon, man. Signed, Chewy. 

J.K., I'm not chewy. But seriously, I'm sorry to hear that, man.
Truly sorry to hear. You’ll get back on top again. Stay strong bro. 
Man, that really stinks. Find a good friend, and may God's blessings be on you during this time.
Man, I'm sorry to hear this. Find a good friend, and my God's blessings be on you during this time.
Get better soon, yo. 
Damn dude that is messed up and sorry to hear you have to dump your BTC to pay for medical bills, but of course it may end up being a good move to lock in profits, even at $7000...if we see lower prices soon.   And like you say, got to be thankful for crypto ...sounds like it may save your life on some level.

Anyway good luck with your recovery and sounds like a rough road for awhile, but you have lived to fight another day, which is what counts.
You're lucky to be alive. Was it a motorcycle accident?
was it a motorcycle accident?
Don't underestimate power of the mass, even if they're stupid. Their FOMO buying rekt a lot of bear whales last year. If average Joe starts shorting bitcoin, that might be the indicator we're reaching bottom, but it doesn't mean we're at the bottom yet.
Which exchange did they use?
What ? That really happened ?
You do realize shorting is “selling” right.

So if everybody realizes how to sell bitcoin then there is only one direction it’s gonna go.

Ppl have even clued on to the multiple dcb as short entries 
doombois is the word you're looking for.
The "it's going to $1M but USD will be worthless bois"
Well, why wouldn't the bear ideas be a bit rational in these conditions? We have already fallen 70% from our ATH in 3 months. Would it be rational to say "well, we've already fallen 70 points, another 20 is possible (to return to the price where we were last year, and pretty close to 9 months ago). It is similar to in the middle of the bull run sitting at 15000 and saying "you know, I think 20k is possible."

The guys suggesting that people will flee the stock market bubble to Bitcoin, and a bunch of fund money is about to roll in, and that retail hasn't been burned, and we will hit 40-100k soon, are probably worse.
the doom-then-moonboi shorters
I'm pretty sure most of the bearbois are calling for a 2k-3k bottom, which is pretty realistic
A perfect portrayal of current sentiment. You’ll learn to love again!
[deleted]
This looks like a highly likely scenario to play out. Follow the wedge to just over 6k before a bigger bounce. This current one seems to be running out steam (although 7.5 is still in the cards, at least for a wick). 
Well, it is consolidating to go down.
yup, haven't traded since 8800 broke to the downside. This is just insane. I've been doing paper trades, and I am getting wrecked. It's a crapshoot.   
Have 66% of planned fiat into a two-year minimum long-term trade at $6,700. If we drop below $6,000, I’ll begin scaling in the remaining 33%, 11% at a time, and would be happy to average that entry down. I have other trading BTC that I will gradually sell on the way up over the next two years, if we go up. 
Out of position after a scalp short, waiting for some green candles or a break down to short, or for a pump to long. 

edit : if it consolidates probably long with tight stop
Thanks for sharing your plan. I like it when it's not just "I'm long/short now" responses.

I think that's a respectable number to long on. I was thinking of jumping in for a long now but with the resistance we keep getting slammed on at 7.1k, I think another dip is inbound and a nice breakout from there is worth going long in on. If it doesn't break out, I'm doubting a serious dropout so the risk of the long not paying off right now is low. That's just me. I can take that small loss if I'm wrong.
Short from 7050 but really I've been shorting since 10.8. Missed some of the move due to profit taking but I did have a nice long at the 7.5 bounce as well. 

Overall I'm probably short from 10k. Moved all my profits off bitmex and my new position has liquidation at 9.8. 

Looking to take profit at 5.5 and will re-short the bounce to 6k. I plan to short all the way down to $300 (the fair enthusiast value of BTC).

We are green now? Why you got to go make me a liar when I said we were yellow last night
can you make a crater math to extrapolate low prices if the downtrend continues?
Good insight. Those credit card fees gave Coinbase a lot of wiggle room to manipulate the market as market makers. Now that people aren’t paying 5% fees painting the charts is a lot tighter for them i’m guessing.
Is it much more difficult or much more expense? They whack you with cash advance fees thats all. 
Retail investors as a whole probably don't add up to much. The "Big Money (TM)" is not buying from online exchanges. Pretty sure the OTC market is still larger (could be by many many magnitudes) in comparison. 

If the commoner/retail investor who buys from online markets won't be buying and it's all whales buying OTC, then eventually the OTC BTC could end up on the online markets, which can be worrying if the whales can just push the thing in any direction they want.
Its kind of bizarre they would ban considering the amount of money they are missing out on.  My conclusion is that they banned it because  their credit is based on bullshit money and Bitcoin is more valuable.  Can you think of an appreciating asset that you can buy with a credit card?  All i can think of is depreciating assets.
I promised that I'm gonna go opposite, but I'm already short, so...
long before the crazy amount of resistance from 71-7300. Bad trade mate
Seems foolish to be honest. Seems we have "double" topped at 7,100, waiting to dip down to 6,750 and probably below. I even think we'll see 5,800 before we'll see 7,300...
Why do you think they're invigorated? All I see is buyers unable to follow through and stuck. Unable to take and hold 7k. 
Wow, did not expect you to long from here.
"Accumulation" also happened in the 8.5k - 9k price range. 
[deleted]
Possibly, for his next short position. 
this is what price manipulation looks like

it is trading within a specific range, it is controlled, but the big whales can still make massive profits in this $400 range buy pumping, selling, dumping and repeating the process

"We will regulate, make bitcoin not wild, nor wilder. We'll tame it into a regular type instrument of trade with rules." Melamed

This is what you people wanted
I think people will lose interest before there's a major break one direction or the other. I'm predicting extended price stability in this price range. Traders will give up trying to scalp trades and we'll complete a period of consolidation. We can go sideways for months. 
The latter will probably happen, except lower than 6.6k

Yeah, I sometimes don't think people evaluate the market in percentage terms. At this point, IMO, it's a lot more likely we see a 25% rise than a 25% drop, and thus I wouldn't short this right now. 
Same dudes who got burnt at $19k are more likely to be spending more money to buy the dip, than trying to short the actual bitcoin market on a risky exchange like Bitfinex. Because "it's not a loss until you sell", "average your cost down", "buy the dip" and "hodl" are the dominant narratives that are still being peddled around on all crypto-related reddits. 

And I don't even need to make this stuff up to know that I have a high probability of being correct about this. 
People assuming the bear market is over and the trend has been broken after a 3% rise. "You cant make this stuff up".
I'm bearish / neutral and even I think 3k will be a stretch.

Let's get to 5k first, then we'll talk.
Have you taken into account what would happen if the price collapsed that low? I ask in part because I do believe there is a floor for BTC, and that floor is the price at which mining BTC is not just unprofitable, but actually starts costing miners money. Along with the meteoric rise to $20K, came a surge in the hash rate causing the mining difficulty to raise to record high levels. If the ASIC farms in China stop mining BTC and switch to other SHA256 coins that are profitable, then the network is left with an absurdly high difficulty level and instead of blocks being found every 10 minutes, we are now maybe finding 1 block every hour or maybe couple of hours. It takes 2 block weeks for the difficulty to reset, all the while the price of BTC plummets because now it's really unusable. I speak from experience because I've been in crypto since 2011/2012, and I've seen my fair share of coins get destroyed when the difficulty is too high and it's no longer profitable to mine.
I have a tough time seeing to dip below $100B

The *real* bitcoin name alone is worth >100B at this point.
But 99.99% of everyone in crypto including the most bearish here expect BTC to be worth more than 20k in 1-2 years and view a new ATH as guaranteed. Make of that what you will. 
and your betting against a massive bear whale who has a lower level short in a downwards trend and why.

you do realise the bull whales will get wiped out too if they try swimming against the trend too much.

i personally think the ball is in the bear whales court, the amount of resistance over head is insane, why would the bull whales risk gettin sold into by the retail crowd on levg and on top of that a big player who clearly wants this thing to go down.

and lets say this bear whale is in 3x levg, that would put hi liqui at around the 9k mark or above if he shorted here, do you really reckon a bunch of bull whales will pull all stops to get us to 9.1 k just so that they can liquidate this 'dumbass' shorting here ???...and this is assuming this bear whale doesnt have ammunition still.

just doesn make sense for the bull whales to go after a massive player in this range, maybe try gettin to mid 5k first and get some mometum behind them.

i personally think there is a bull whale who has his liquidation point below 6.5k and he is fighting this till the very bitter end.

just doesnt make sense for us to continuously bounce in the middle of nowhere for the umpteenth time now. 


I miss them bulldax days
Whale games, fun stuff 
Only a hunch, but I think/hope it was that jerk of a bear whale that was selling 70 blocks all damn day FOMOing back in....
>Please hold my bags for me. Bail me out.

No lol. You go first, I'll buy the breakout.
imo the same old game of spoofing whales ( Finex, where the most volume is)trying to push the small fish into buying their asks at around 7100. This is all about to fall down in a few hours. 
Picked up a hefty chunk at 6.8
That guy bought like 1500 BTC at 6.5k$? He almost made 1m already, what a beast.
Or the perfect short entry, lets see. As long as i'm on the same direction this goes, i'm happy. But still bet on being down and not up
Thanks!
So the question that I’ve never seen answered anywhere is, what actually makes a cryptocurrency market a Bear Market and HOW does it become a Bull Market and also how does a Bull crypto market become a Bear Market. What are the exact factors that create a bear or bull market that are specific to this particular asset class vs. others?
Perfect time to be a troll
yeah why is that?
What are your thoughts on 7.2k? Should that be considered a resistance point to really watch out for, in case the current rebound continues at this pace?
I have no idea what any of this means. Read it a few times and just have no idea what you're saying. all I can really say is that I don't think you can deduce there's any accumulation occurring from a 15m candle chart. 

Also, annoying nitpick, but you said essentially 4 times
> Essentially for every seller there was a buyer.

This is an oversimplification that can lead to error. Oftentimes there is one seller and many hundreds of buyers (distribution), and at other times, there is one buyer for very many sellers (accumulation). Dealers and market markers vs retail investors. This is stakeholder analysis 101.


My advice would be not to listen to the so called geniuses on an anonymous message board, and instead form your own opinion/outlook.
> WTF happened to straight down to 6k? Even this morning, 9 out of 10 posts 

Sentiment is a contrarian indicator.
Don't listem to this place, just use it as one extra source if you see interestimg things.  This sub was screaming 50k after the ath, now they're screaming 2-3k, possible we go there but point is people are easily swayed to the extremes.
I'm going to use my "genius" skills and tell you to wait 2-4 more days.
My man it's moved literally 2%. If you feel like you already missed out you are way overleveraged. Just buy if you think this is the reversal. You are whining about literally 2% of movement. 
When it's just people pushing their agenda, they've already sold. Unless they're smarter than your average retail investor, which I don't think they are, just ask yourself who else is going to sell.
This is what people said when we got down to 15k. Then when we got down to 10k...
It's the same pattern every single fucking time. High volume bull, high volume crash, low volume sideways for several months. Are we in the sideways channel now? I hope so.
if this thin goes to 7.8k then it will head up to the mid  8's atleast.
I was also expecting to retest 7.2 but that little mini double top at 7120-30 seemed to take the wind out of bull sails
the 19k buyers normies are back for revenge
keep in mind we're at a lower price range so shorts opening here are worth 2/3 of $10.5k
Didn’t you hear? A $1,000 move down now is like 15% - easy money. 
shows that a lot more ppl are comfortable shorting in this range.

am pretty sur emost of em are the ones who closed their shorts at profit yesterday.

these guys will open a lot of shorts in the 7k range too, if we get there.

if we break 7.5k with confidence, then maybe things could get interesting and we might test 8.6k even. 

which leads us into the death cross.

but yep, that requires sustained buying pressure, noto ne or two whales trying to prop the price up for their ulterior motives. 
[removed]
Only once those same people going long on every dip instead start to short every peak.
that always happens during periods of consolidation/sideways. It doesn't mean anything, really, since it's happened every time we dump -> consolidate for a few days.

It's generally bitmex users being wary of shorting when there's a large discount already. 
The ascending wedge he is drawing is bearish though. 
There are lots of MA crossover bots out there, all with their individual settings. I think at any rate, some of them will fire off on the hour, which may cause a cascade. They were self-fulfilling in this sense to the downside recently, even if they did rek their owners. They're really quite performing in bull markets, in fact.
[something like this?](https://imgur.com/a/vZpGL)
Stoch RSI needs to cool off soon on most timeframes > 1hr. Also, ~$6.9K area will probably need a retest to confirm iH&S if we're going to try and pump short term to $8K or higher.

It will take a massive effort to breach $7.7K - $8K zone imho.
Many thanks for that
The only thing that still confuses me is how alt coins have TA discussed in isolation from BTC. How could Litecoin make an attractive buying opportunity if bitcoin is likely to breakout downwards? We all know LTC would fall with it...
[deleted]
I doubt it'll break today.
It's currently at 9.5k. You think breaking 7.2k will bring us all the way to 9.5k?
There's a lot of buying pressure right now on GDAX. Bulls did a good job holding the 7170-7180 range after bouncing off of 7200 during the run-up. 

I expect us to reach the 8200-8800 range in the next couple of days before heading back down due to us bouncing off the descending log trend line from 20k. Then possibly a re-test of 6000.

[Chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/rcoXqG9P/)


think we just got rejected again.
no they dont.

if your 3x short in here, then your liqui would be above 9 k 

so being short is pretty safe considering that we have all kinds of resistance above while below?, the lesser said the better 
Probably has to do with who would be asking those questions. "How to short?" comes from people  in the market moving into full bear mode where "How to buy?" is theoretically new money coming in
There is no logic. The same people saying this also dont get why people sell their coins for profit.
both infer inexperienced traders interested in btc, as in putting $ either way.
[deleted]
It's just another form of hopium, like the new 'everyone is expecting 3000 so it won't happen' hopium. Except since everyone is now thinking 'everyone is expecting 3000 so it won't happen', it will actually happen.
The few retail investors that havent left are looking to dump the price. This means the Easter Bunny is about to pump it to 14k just to liquidate em. 
[deleted]
I don't know about the second part of your sentence, but you do understand why the first part about Chad googling "bitmex" could be a reversal indicator, right?
You are short more often than you are long, correct?

Have you managed to take more fiat out of bitcoin than you've put in? Most shorters won't manage that.

This time it actually tried a bear flag, and a rogue pump send it to 6950... Against all odds... Someone is trying their best to hold 6900.
Could it be the whale that stalled 6500 time enough before the pump?
With all the reports of people looking to short this should be half way to goblin town. I still don't see it as bullish, because bulls can't even break 7100 anymore. This time around not even 7000 seems feasible.
You're not alone.  I had problems on Reddit is Fun.  But switching to PC it's fine.

I actually messaged the mods asking if I was shadowbanned since my posts weren't showing on mobile, heh.
Reddit has problems:

Hasn’t alien blue not been updated since 2012 or something 
HAve no problem with Alien Blue
lol
I placed a short at 7,1 and slept. I woke up and am confused now.
Man. I opened a short at 7k seconds before the pump. Really sucks, I thought we were at the local top.
just wait until you get sweeeped away
2 years? Fine.

2 months? Fucked
Great. Huge gains
fucked.
Fuck I didn't realize that sp500 and dow trade today since it's Easter. They are really fucked.. And the global markets are my biggest concerns at the moment.. If we see a recession then it will be worse than 2008
How much more fucked can ETH possibly get? That ratio..
Obviously I'm biased but if global matkets are hurting it could really help Bitcoin as a hedge for global currency's.  Precious metals go up and while Bitcoin isnt close to ad established I could see it as a global hedge and easy access digital gold.
Most of those are down 70-90% nobody left to panic sell imo. Anyone holding is probably in it until the end at this point. 
Ripple? 


I don't think so.
Seriously, there's a shitload of people who have probably bought those shitty projects at ATH, a lot of them was stupid enough to buy them without proper research and only on FOMO. I think a lot of them will hold hoping for a return. And you know what, I'm not happy to say this, but I'm pretty sure at least few of them will go back to ath. Yeah I know that's sad..
Went long based off daily bullish engulfing candle and bottomed out stoch + bull divergence. Unloading at 7250, 7500, 7800, 8300. New lows 100% possible but bears need a break and fomo shorts need liquidated. 
I think its just inexperience, but your post is super confusing to me. Long means you think its going to go up, but then you say overall sentiment is (at) worst bearish. Then you say When it pops it will be like 20k top but inverse (so crazy rises?). But then you go into FUD with SEC, which indicates it will go down and you say it will go down to 6.6k and 5.8k. So what is it!?! You gonna short or long!? 
> Overall sentiment is worst then bearish

https://datamish.com/dashboard/db/btcusd?refresh=1h&orgId=1&from=now-24h&to=now

Still over 50% long, everyone rushing to do the same and then closing for another step down.

> inverse fomo on leverage

Yeah, but a touch more to come. People haven't really got onboard yet.

> Going short here is like going long at 17k, the reverse will be brutal. 

Yeah, we need them.
If large whales/MMs are trying to engineer a massive short squeeze, isn't that bearish? i.e. it implies they have a huge quantity of coins they'd like to offload at a higher price than current market is offering. If that's the case, they presumably only want to offload them if a). they think they can buy back cheaper later or b). they accumulated too early and are trying to cut losses.

Or am I being too naive/simplistic with the above?
What’s the average daily lend rate look like on finex? I can’t get an account. 
What SEC fud? Do you have a link?
Wait a second though, you're predicting a 7-day average that is close to a 50% decline in value from where we are currently: $6915 as of 4/2/2018 7:11 GMT. In order for a $3415 7-day average wouldn't we need to be significantly lower than what we are currently at?
I've been wondering what price your model has it pinned at. Thanks!

Edit: If LN ever comes online and is used by many people in the community, I wonder if your model will deviate from the price or if on chain transactions will also increase since more people will start to use BTC.
Bounce to 6500 incoming
Maaaaan, it's so bearish ... I wouldn't be surprised if sooner.
The thing is, that's very soon.
Sure. But we just have to get through the preceding age of the bear.
0% 

https://www.moonmath.win/
Very interesting, I hadn't even considered what an invalidation like that would mean in terms of market participation (as opposed to action) by bears who are net bearish on BTC. 
Current price action was deeply lucky. Stay frosty. This move does not validate the trade I made.
Be careful, the buy wall at 6970 on bitfinex seems to be propping us up for now. Once that's pulled we could go down. 
Thanks for the informative post and the site. Both very interesting. 
Why didn't you just long at 6.4k? I don't get when bulls wait for the top of a range to open an 8x long without confirmation of a breakout lol
Kind of agree but I think the $7.3K bounce was driven more by G20 news and EW practitioners ($7.3K was the "last stand" for a very bullish wave count out of the Feb $6K low IIRC). Am sure quite a few shorts got squeezed too but not sure that was the primary driver for the pump.
Just hit $7318 on GDAX
Could you please share a chart showing the bear div on the RSI? Nothing is popping out to me so I'm curious to see what you're seeing. Maybe some fancy lines to emphasize the divergence? :)
Also thinking we may see a Bollinger bounce back down.
> Waiting for $7.3k before thinking this is even a medium term reversal.

Welp, thar she blows.
breaking the top between the bottoms confirms it.
12k would put an end to all uncertainty, ~9.2k would ignite some good FOMO (at least for me). 8k would be nice but don't mean nothing IMO.
I'm not believing that the crash is over until we have broken $12k in my opinion.
After everything we've seen since Jan.. We really need to see a break through 10k with conviction. Break that ATH resistance line and stay above it for a good week moving up slowly in the process.

Otherwise I'm not believing anything.

It's like right now. The longer we can't break 7k, the more shit we are in 
Have to stop looking for 'confirmations' to go back up to ATH levels. Longer timeframes are absolutely unpredictable right now, just take it a day (or maybe a week at most) at a time if you're trading. Anyone claiming we'll be at X price in 3 months or w/e from here, or anyone calling any specific resistance / support as the line to break to go to moon / goblintown is delusional. There is not nearly enough data to be either bullish or bearish on timeframes longer than 1-2 months with conviction. 
Not saying you're wrong just always interesting how we can be watching the same movements and I don't see it recharging for a move up at all but it failing resistance fairly unceremoniously. Did you get back in your long with this dip down?
why at 7100, if we break that there is still crazy 7200 resistance lol
This is good for bitcoin, smart money will want to buy digital gold. On a serious note, I wouldn't be too surprised if this is just a dip and the crash isn't for a while longer

But CNBC is back on the bitcoin hype train https://finance.yahoo.com/m/88aac55f-a590-3df0-95f8-514c9f71006e/bitcoin-climbs-back-above.html
Good thing this isn't my first Rhodium
Hard for it to do so. People trusted and still trust precious metals a lot more than crypto. 
More than doubled in value past 2 years. Not bad if you didn't buy during the bubble.
We haven't finished correcting yet. We need to go lower. This is just whale money playing games at the moment. 
I think the bulls have a slight edge right now. Bears have failed to make new lows on a breakdown and the 1D RSI is starting show signs that the bear market can't reach down any further.  I think it's only a slight edge... maybe 49/51. The potential upside of a breakout here is substantial, though. On that principal alone bears should just take their profit and get out while the market sorts out what it's going to do.
Expecting more volatility within the last hour of the daily close
Dude, you have a link to an article from October and an image of some unattributed text. What do you expect?
And?
Your post isn't even moderated on /r/cryptocurrency either

First of many. This will be the summer of ICO crackdowns.
so another ico scam...what else is new?
Color me extremely sceptical. Millions, sure, maybe. But billions? Come on.
Is there a source for OTC trades? thanks.
The resilience against the sell pressure is impressive honestly... 
I thought it was going to take off - especially with the 4h RSI and MACD where they are, but now the 15m MACD is nearly crossing negative again. This has quite consistently meant we were in for at least a short term fall in the last several days.
The only thing that worries me is how overwhelmingly bearish everybody is atm, this would be quite the reversal if It took off here 
its accumulation.... chop chop chop until MMs bags are filled...
its accumulation... chop chop chop until MMs bags are filled. Easiest exchange to see it on is GDAX right now... no volume on red candles vs green candles
Finex spoofing buy wall of 145 btc let itself be sold into at 7050
Finex spoofy buy wall of 145 btc let itself be sold into at 7050
The last 12 bounces have been fake, so why would you suspect this one could be as well?  What a brilliant question.
7K has become a strong support.  We probably won't see anything under 7K anymore.
This is something new users of bitmex very frequently get confused over. I did too at first.

Leverage determines your liquidation point, not your position size. 

100x 5000 contracts means you put $50 on the line. If you got liquidated you lose $50.

Your position size was only worth $5000 in btc. 

You meant to do 500000 contracts at 100x. Liquidation would mean you lose $5000 but your position size would be worth ~71 btc, meaning you make $71 for every $1 upwards (not accounting for fees)

Please be safe and don't trade too much on leverage. 
You’re doing the same thing I was. When you increase leverage you need to multiply your stake by that amount. Check the cost of your entry and you’ll see it’s 100 times too low ;)

I think they need to make it clearer as so many people make that mistake at first.
I saw a post on the daily sometime the last 2-3 weeks that someone has minute-by-minute data going back quite some time and to PM for details. Might take good use of the find function to find it.
Falling wedge is bullish. I've got a small ascending wedge (bearish) on the 15m chart after the spike from 6425 yesterday morning, though. 
If there's no move soon, I expect chop for some time. I'm not discounting another drop down, but I'm not going to reopen my position, which is similar to yours, but might add.
I would wait 1 hour. It should be a pump there to try 7200.
Stop loss @6950 should be safe
[removed]
In the case of case of a continuation pattern like this and in this situation, what is being considered to be potentially continued?  The recent bullish rise from low 6k, or the macro trend which is bear?
its up to the people who mined the new coins on what they want to do with them.
Miner coins would be ideal for OTC buyers. If I were a large miner I'd have deals set up selling straight to them. Mined coins are a dependable source. 
Many miners work in pools. They get paid in fiat by these pools to cover their operating expenses. The pools periodically sell the BTC through various means. We do not know the exact number of "new" BTC that are sold on a given day, but it is non-zero. If, over a period of a week, the price remains the same, we can conclude that there is evidence that there has been net positive demand for BTC.
Many miners would undoubtedly be selling, but they could also hold on to mined btc and short the market.
Exchanges don't buy shit. They are middlemen for the open market.
Most miners cover expenses with sales, then reserve the rest for new miners and stuff. 
Local Bitcoins global volume seems to keep pace with the impact of mining supply.

I realized that 1800 mined bitcoins is not that significant compared to the almost 600K bitcoins traded daily.  However, per minute it's about 420 BTC traded.  So yeah, when these large miners or whales decide to sell or buy it's definitely conceivable to move the price so easily as we are seeing now with the sell/buy spikes.
Not that crazy. ideally you'd set up a bot with a stop loss below, say, $7.2 or $7k after buying 
FWIW, that's exactly where I put my stop loss for my short, because I had the same line of thinking. 
Bots have a feature where user can tell it to purchase a static amount of a coin. when the price has reached a certain point relative to whatever indicators they're using.
Its already Monday for half of the world, Sunday dump is over but i think we have more downside coming this month.

Another big dump between the 9th and 13th of April when ETH has its Death Cross which dumps the alt market and BTC down just below 6 for more stress as Tokens take a hit. Then climbing out towards the end of the month on the back of some good news. By mid May we’re up at 8.3 to 8.5. 

On my chart, we are exactly at the downward trendline from 8900. Breaking upwards from here with gusto could spark a larger run.
yeah, should have gone at least to 7120 (top of descending channel from 7270) or up to 7200 (ascending channel from the pump from 6500)
Will probably close my long and open a short around 7050-7100...
Since 11k we can't really rely on any continuation patterns. They break how they want.
It took over 3 years for Bitcoin to return to $1242. It could be years again until $20k.
I have seen whole quasi-religions built on the worship of individual 15 minute candles or market statistics
Are we gonna argue that both aren’t possible
It's depressing to you because you don't even want to contemplate the possibility of Bitcoin not hitting a higher ATH. 

The truth is that a new ATH and BTC sub 1k are both POSSIBLE. If you disagree then you are too emotionally or financially invested in Bitcoin. 
are we ever going to get to $7100?
boring

lol you got downvoted for being short, I bet if you went long this comment would have 10 upvotes by now
Can you show it please?
Not in China where it's 4k. Western world sure. 8k
I pay 0.15/0.16 USD per kWh and it is still profitable (debatable) to mine.  If I were to buy an s9 today at face value from Bitman though, ROI would be about 2 years.  That also assumes the s9 doesn't break, they only have a 3 month warranty.

A pattern needs at least two repetitions?
a bit more simple wedge: https://www.tradingview.com/x/4ztgPeaQ/

with previous resistance at 7.2k 
Patterns happen everywhere but that doesn't mean they will keep repeating forever.
A little rambly but you make some decent points.

A question you might want to consider if you're trying for a deep analysis of the value of bitcoin and what might constitute a fair price: what is a dollar (or Euro) really worth?
This question about what should bitcoin be worth now really should be accompanied by what would bitcoin be worth if it realized a good bit of it's potential over time?  How long might that take?  What are the chances it has of success?

I mean you could make a reasonable argument that Bitcoin "should" be worth less than $500/BTC based on current use in commerce, but that it has a decent chance to be worth $100k/BTC within a few years.  Thinking that price path is not going to include a speculative premium along the way is not realistic.  It's not going to just be virtually worthless until all the scaling is complete, regulations are fully in place and positive, derivative markets are liquid and deep, multiple ETFs are in place as well as major funds, banks, and nations having large positions, merchant adoption is almost universal and world adoption is over 20%.... then moon in price.  The more likely a future with a relevant Bitcoin in global commerce looks, the higher the price will be now, well before that actually happens.
The CC market cap is way too high. Bitcoin is the only asset that can be effectively sold short on leverage, though. The result is a medium-term imbalance. When traders lose interest BTC will recover and evacuate the remaining value of shitcoins that could not be effectively shorted in the correction.
The Twitter bot is not official. 
if you are long term bullish, those are the buy signals when they flatten out...
Agreed, but don't trust google trends. I used Google for bitcoin about three times.

To find out the price, the exchanges and coinmarketcap.com

I know all about bitcoin now. As do most other people!
Sideline money who are not searching btc on google can easily get us to 12k. Lets see if the normies can resist 2x-10x returns from that point again. 
apparently the main reason to go long now is to squeeze the shorts, coz shorts are at ATH.

where did we hear this before?
Spreading shit and FUD for 3 months must be quite rewarding for you.

Rest assured, when we're back in a bull market I'll be tagging your troll ass in every single one of my posts.

But please, keep shorting thinking we're going to $3k. The quicker you go bankrupt, the faster this sub can be rid of you.
Bears too confident , many stupid amateur shorts on board too 
I don't see it 
We get it you’re short.
Smmh, not dis bull!
If they stick to their short why not? Its an extra profit
i don't think all traders go to the same church.
$0 per coin in 3 months.
No really, it's 10/10.

Even at this point I use the overloadedness, and how long it takes me to get a command into the system, as an indicator of how strong an in-progress movement will be.

A few times it was overloaded before I noticed movement, and then sure enough the volume spiked up.  You could probably make a bot that trades based on the response time of their server.
Look, i dont know how i refrained myself to tell the second link that he is a fucking idiot and that actually is a hidden blessing for him to learn a valuable lesson. Dont tempt me now.
I just discovered they have a scaled orders algo on finex... I think the deal is done. It's not like I ever go above 5x, and usually 3x is comfortable for me.

I'm sure I'll keep using 'mex for hedging, but sometimes I find myself just entering limit orders not really caring for what the price is doing and - guess what - I can't even enter them because there's a wild pump.
I hear you. I had a 10x leveraged long from $6,970 with a stop at $6,898. The price just barely went below $6,900 and triggered my stop and then of course proceeded to pump. I'd be knee deep in green if I had just lowered my stop by a few dollars. Feels bad man :(
Same. It happens...
Step by step low volume rally?
You can draw that putting the line right above where we are. You cut some wicks along the way. Be careful trusting it either way.
Why would someone search for bitcoin several times? 
if you look at the 90 day chart, it's actually a little up over the past 10 days
Search interest is extremely high if this is the new normal.

https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&q=bitcoin


Yes.

https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2009-01-01%202018-04-02&q=bitcoin
pretty crazy to watch
BTC won't always be shorted. They can only play that card for so long.
We wanted adoption, this is part of it.
That's like saying Bitcoin got to 19k because there wasn't cme futures..
More like Coinbase adding BCH support on 12/19.
Ikr, but atleast the bulls are putting up a fight... maybe we will be able to turn the tide on one day.
[removed]
I already have the wedge broken down: https://www.tradingview.com/x/asrsHAWC/  

Unless you're talking the longer term descending wedge: https://www.tradingview.com/x/J1OF2OpG/  

Shorting the top of the descending wedge does make sense...just with stops at 7200 or so. Which reminds me...mine are still at 7800. Time to move them way the heck down. 
iam just fed up not takin profits.

think will close my short when we revisit 6k.

ofcourse it will nosedive immediately after. 
[removed]
I'd be surprised if they don't release the bulls soon and let the price shoot up
Hey you said you would call it a day ;)
We’ll be testing 6.5 by tonight I bet but that’s just me ;)
Snail games.
ftfy
Nah
Ur here
nope you're good
i sees you
Are you having issues seeing comments as well?
I think i'm shadowbanned
Can't see my comments either :(
Had the same problem for a couple of hours today. Comments show up in my profile, but not here. Might be a reddit bug? Also might be fixed now, but not the older comments are still missing....
There was a period where no posts were showing up
you're not banned :)
Reddit seems to be having some issues ATM. It'll probably go away eventually.
well if you include bad words, or banned words automderator will remove your posts, if you include certain links, automderator will remove your posts, if you have bad post karma or bad comment karma, automoderator will remove your post, and no we arent removing your post, but this one im replying was removed because of teh word 'fvck'
On the daily its drawing a bear flag. 
It's been less than two days. Bitcoin can make that move in less than two hours.
I wouldn’t be too sure about that 
We're not out yet
Salty bears downvoting any comments that seem bullish. Regardless of where the price is heading, the truth is bulls have been steering it for the last 24hrs and bears thirsting for <6.5k are nowhere to be seen. 
Significantly less than $6k. My guess is $4k
4-5k. I can’t see it going to 3. But slow bleed maybe. Low 6 high 5 buying will be huge if it happens slow or not. 
A rapid break down to 5k.
Apparently a lot less than $7k lol
kobayashi-like will to push 20kbtc @6k$. looks like nobody is willing to take that risk.
< $1,000 will be despair. I will get downvoted for this because sub $1,000 sounds ridiculous. But most people forgot that early 2017 BTC went as low as $735. We are talking about *despair*, many people are considering $3,000 a real possibility so that wouldn't constitute despair.
For me we are all looking at one of two news based scenarios. The bear market is one news story away from delivering that final dagger to send us further into  the lower range. At the same time we could really use a positive adaption head line to begin our climb again to the top. With big players in the Financial world imposing their will on the markets its really hard to tell what’s going to happen over the next few weeks. 
On the other side it seems like everyone is eager for a bottom to buy in and also many are looking to get rich quick and sell a bounce. Right now there is still hope. I want to see people crying for mercy. That’s when I’ll take action. 
A month at or below 5k
For cheap btc or fomo and why?

classic bull fud, not closing my 7170 5x short prematurely like i have done so many times when shorting strengh during a bear market (after getting scared out with a small profit by bull fud many times)
I would like that. It would give me one last buy-in opportunity. What kind of time frame are we looking at?
Wait for the 7200-7300 to break. That will mess up the daily bear flag. 
We're only up $250 in the last 17 hours.

$650 if you count that one 15 minute candle preceeding it. So if that $250 is an aftershock it's not a very big one.

Happy / not happy to be wrong if it goes up to 7500 but we just don't know what the hell bitcoin will do.
Good place to add to your short, these huge green candles are only there to scare you off.
It makes perfect sense   
1. too many people are short, thus removing sell pressure and we cannot go down anymore   
2. whales want to squeeze bottom shorters for their money   
3. longer term indicators are bottomed out, justifying a bounce  
   
market makers are not going to let you make free money, they're just waiting for capitulation either way then they run the market the other way. Thats what we were seeing yesterday with so many shorts adding. Thats how they make their cash. They want you to go 'wtf is going on' until you FOMO then they turn it around and squash you
Wow, had to google 'abandoned baby formation'. That is a new one for me. Nevertheless, still don't see it unfortunately. 
I've never seen an abandoned baby on BTC's chart (admittedly I haven't looked much for one) because there is never a period where trading is closed. Getting the gap required for that formation on the "baby" candle is simply impossible on longer time scales (longer time scales being longer than 5 min...)
> I'm hesitant to short here 

Actions speak much louder than words. So you don't feel confident about market direction, up or down, to put your money on the line.
> when I'm THIS confident, I'm generally wrong.

lmao this guy fkin trades
If she's going to retrace this completely, we might even see 1k. Scary.
Maybe you are not confident enough, since you are doubting it based in how confident you are, and therefore it will dump lol. 
This wasn't the pump, if you check last step up, there was also a small spike mid step. Probably will go down now to 6950-7000 before the real pump
Still above the value it bounced the last time it mini dumped to 6900... 
I have no idea how bulls are managing this... We should be @6800 by now. 5 hours to recover from 6900 to 7000, to drop again to the same exact spot... 
It looks like bear whales are trying to incite panic selling but no one is going for it... Like no one is falling for the FOMO attempts of the bulls.
No one is trusting anything, anymore....
Not convinced this isn't going back up to test 7.2. Still sitting in fiat waiting to see what happens if it gets there, but the support seems to be relatively heavy in the low 6.9s and the volume on this move was decent but hasn't been absolutely insane just yet (it's early maybe it'll get there). There's been more than a few moves like this ever since we bounced from 6.45k where the sellers make a small push then stagnate for awhile then buyers make a bigger push up.
not over yet... its back over 6.9k and battle is on. Come on Bulls..
eh, doesn't seem like it's committing to any drops or rises.
It was only a 50$ drop and you're calling for another 500$ drop already Smh. Higher low hasn't broke yet. Maybe wait a for that to break before you get too excited.
Yes. I think this is about to be the “next leg down” 
Its a reset for another test of 7000... Anything more than that is wishful thinking
My heart is telling me reset, but my mind is telling me breakdown
This is just chop. ignore the charts until $6.5k or $7.3k 
🤔. What chart are you looking at?
I wouldn't go that far.  You guys have nuts of titanium to trade this with any margin in either direction right now.  Hats off to you if you see something conclusive either way, short term.  I sure don't.  Still pretty sure we hit a new ATH within the next few months though.  Money will be fleeing traditional markets, and we'll see "panic buying" at some point.
GL Have Fun
YOLO
Out of nowhere? Seems like the bears expect this to go to zero without any pumps, and that all pumps are ‘fake’. We’ll see..
and the classic system overload, is bitmex the new kraken ?
pullin all stops to get a fomo in.

but 7,2k is massive resistance now.

7.7k is even bigger resistance i feel. 
They spell bears with a z..... that's pretty cool
Can you post a link to this Facebook group? I search myself and could not find it: https://i.imgur.com/XZjZEX6.png
I gotta imagine if we start going down again the buying pressure between from 6.5 to 5.8k will be insane but if it breaks through I don't think anybody knows where we will end up.
Facebook is old. Only grandfather and grandmothers are these days using it.

facebook eh.

been like a year since i logged in.

ppl still use it?
> Any advice guise?

10M or so leaving Bitcoin daily to pay for electricity. Do you think 300M a month are getting into the economy?

I don't, so I will be waiting for everyone down the river.
Why would the market makers / whales satisfy your expectation? The whole point of the market is to make you lose.
it's just that the Kraken whale decided to buy at 6.5k$
IMO, it's the competition to get in at a double bottom of 6k. You don't want to be too safe if you're catching knives. This kind of off-chart/order book strategy game has been going on for nearly two months now.
I suspect on the next attempt it'll breach lower. I hear 5800 bandied about but I've tried catching that knife and missed loads of times now. Set buys at 7k when it pumped from 7300. 6100 when it went to 6430 and up to where we are now.

The trend is down but the buyers ARE there, thousands of them waiting for a buy signal and if you think it's going to 6k before a significant bounce (by 500 to 1500) then you might buy in a little higher because something is better than nothing.

When it hit 6500(ish) yesterday it flatlined a little and that was enough for many.

And here we are. Don't discount the sentiment of speculators. If we're expecting a double bottom at 6k that says 'we won't go below it' hence the 6500 confidence.
Search google for 'falling wedge' if your looking for an explanation.
refreshes r/bitcoin tab to check upvote count.
Your heart is in the right place. I agree that the shorters only care about USD value instead of BTC itself; however, this is a trading thread, so it's likely there's always going to be camp BTC and camp USD since a lot of us primarily trade the two.
lol on the edit
whaaaat?
Yeah looks great. Just like 9.2 we have now had 3 lower highs on the bounce. I wonder what happens next, I haven't seen anything like this play out before in the last 3 months. 
To be honest I can see it falling straight through the massive support point at 0k, forcing us to completely reassess our understanding of mathematics. We will chop sideways at negative 10000k before some genius eventually realises that btc’s value has become infinite (around March next year), at which point it’s time to go short and/or take some profits.

These comments are my opinion only and should not be treated as financial advice.
3000-4000
https://www.strawpoll.me/15405397

My own opinion: I can see it bottom out around $3k-$3.5k this summer. From there a long consolidation period where faith in the market is being established. ~$10k at the end of the year.


4000
Sub 1k isn't off the table. Similarly, we could see ATH before years end. 

The question isn't where we're going, but how to profit from the volatility.
I'm waiting for another test of 7150. Seems to be the top of the bear flag on the daily
Alcohol, Food, Sleep
Reduce leverage, learn from mistakes, learn from other people, be patient with entering trades, figure out what techniques and time frames suit your trading style and continue doing all those things until your win rate is consistently > 50%. Once win rate is consistently higher than 50% be happy. The end.
Anymore worthless anecdotes you’d like to clog the thread with?  
Wouldn't be surprised if most of those offers were put in months ago and forgotten about. 

Crypto has become a ghost town and more people are moving on each day. 
>people forgot about bitcoin after a short few months.

Interesting. For the last couple of years I frequently heard this rhetoric but in relation to the 2013 pump. It seems 2017 is replacing 2013 in the mainstream fud discourse.
Nah, the technology behind Bitcoin and especially it's having solved the double spend problem were very important breakthroughs far and above whatever benefit fidget spinners provided to humanity. 

However, the intended purpose of Bitcoin as a globally adopted decentralized cryptocurrency will probably still fail to materialize.   
Lol noob ps it's been 9 years
It wicked 5886 and there is no official price, each exchange has their own current market price. Coinmarketcap is probably the most widely used but I’m pretty sure they get their price live from gdax
female?
Keep downvoting me, I’m 60% up in a couple hours :D
We are very similar.  I was always on the sales and marketing side for the most part although my career began as an alternative investment analyst.  I'm in a new business as well.  We do energy projects and their funding.  I actually think the alt coins are here to stay, just in a different and more regulated format.  We are in the process of creating one.  Still in the beginning of the process, but it will not only solve a problem for the relative industry, but will have either have an equity component or be tied to the revenue of the ecosystem system.  The different coins used for the underlying technologies will be stable and tied to real world costs.  It will also be as compliant as we can make it, problem is nobody has an answer for that right now.  I also think you will see more and more coins tied to assets, purely because of the efficiencies the technolgy and liquidity that the virtual markets create.  Time will tell, but I am enjoying being here so very, very early.  We are at the beginning, not the end that is starting to permiate discussions on this and other threads.  Look forward to further discussions. 
Very first purchase on Jan 28.  Sad thing is I chickened out when it was 1000.  
Not even close.  How many penny stocks can you name that is recognized world wide?  How many penny stocks have a technolgy that will be mainstream in 5 years?  Moreover, virtual currency, projects etc are in their infancy.  Every venture capitalist I talk to know that this will be a future funding mechanism because of ridiculously lower costs for them, transparency and liquidity.   Regulation is the BEST thing that can happen for the legitimacy and mainstream adoption.  You will see more security and asset based coins, the scams will vanish and gradually the market will become a viable alternative for both traditional investors and fund managers.  Anyone who thinks all of this is going away is sorely mistaken and does not know the pulse of what will be a rapidly expanding market and an integral part of day to day business worldwide.  The market will decide the worth of BTC, but it, and the alt concept are here to stay. 
> Buying now is probably only whales.

and smart boys
Thanks for sharing, it seems like there are a lot of people in your situation who feel the same way, again just sharing what I'm hearing.
Haha thanks. And it's not some fanatical "hodl" mentality either, it's just hey I bought this thing that I think could be worth a bunch in the future, and I don't need the money now, so, meh may as well not sell.


That is not true...the market is pretty illiquid with how low this volume is and if it remains that way slippage on large orders buying or selling will only get worse. Id be careful underestimating the value of coins on the sidelines.
Thanks for the comment. So, you think FOMO from retail investors wasn't needed/didn't contribute much to bringing us to $20K?
I don't think OP is talking about people who have enough experience about markets to buy on margin.
Thanks for sharing, we'll see how their plan works out for them. What specific numbers are they targeting? Or do they just know they'll buy "once it's lower?"
Thanks for sharing. I hear a lot of people here talk about investors who bought at ~$200 who haven't sold anything yet. A prevailing viewpoint seems to be that if we keep dropping, say to $4,XXX, those people who haven't realized profits will start selling. I'll keep my opinion on this to myself. What are your thoughts there?
It can be, but in this case I'm specifically responding to claims made here that refer to the people in question (casual retail investors). If you see lots of comments about millionaires and their motivations, I encourage you to share your anecdotes as well. That make sense?
Ridiculous
Yep and because of the risk you generally don’t benefit that way either 
V reversal is not the only reversal pattern.
Thanks man. I was getting paid to short most of the way from 11K down, so I'm not that concerned by the sentiment of bitmex cowboys. Still, I am surprised to see it flip despite a triple lower low: https://www.tradingview.com/x/qG610ls0/
will do, as an update.. for the first time since the 25th March we have now posted an hourly candle above the slow moving average.

Going to be an important next 1 to 2 hours to see if this hourly candle can produce the MA crossover. 
I use weighted moving average set at 144, and smoothed moving average set at 5, with Heikin Ashi candles for bit more info on momentum.

Use that alongside the ol Ichimoku, RSI and MACD trend lines, plus Bollinger Bands for spotting pressure build ups across the time frames. 

To top it off I use the DMI to help judge the trend a bit more fully, especially when it's running out of steam. 
This is where "true if big" applies. Bitcoin must be much, much bigger in order for this to be true.
I was intentionally looking at the weekly view to give the big picture.  However, if you look at the 1D view for Bitfinex, that line shows 6 points of contact as far back as the end of last August ($4970 at the time).

This week had two days touch / almost touch that line.
That gdax seller is either tenacious or genuine...
That gdax seller is either tenacious or genuine...
Buy wall growing...there was a 45 BTC buy. 
get the feeling when one side decides it's had enough, the movement is going to be violent!
I'm not certain, but I think that's a normal bot...it just flips depending on market conditions. It's separate from the bear whale with the asks and the other bulls eating them up / occasionally placing bids.
Thanks for sharing this man. Its been an emotional rollercoaster for me thinking I may have completely altered the course of my life for the worse. But reading that you made it through that hardship gives me some strength here to keep my head up and keep powering through. Thanks again dude.
Good advice here. There's an opportunity in this situation somewhere, if you seek it.

Thank you so much dude. God bless.
Thanks for taking the time to message man. I’m definitely glad to be alive to fight another day. Its going to be a tough task to rebuild from the ground up after this, but its just another way to fortify myself and become stronger in the long run.
Nope. I actually have no memory of the event. The last thing i remember was putting on my clothes and leaving my house, and then the next thing i’m waking up in the emergency room with IV’s connected to me and doctors asking me to tell them what day and year it was and having to repeat my name to them to make sure my brain is functioning properly. Pretty damn scary and surreal. 
Don't overestimate the downside. It can't go below zero.
> multiple dcb

Until there's a reversal. Nothing goes on indefinitely, especially in the markets.

Also, if you short using swaps, you have to buy coin.
shh, its hip to say that shorting is now the new FOMO, the coolest story this weekend was that "everybody is shorting and therefore this must be the bottom".
ty
A further 72% drop is not what I would call a realistic estimate.
Unfortunately I think sentiment is going to remain so for awhile... not enough crypto chatter in the mainstream anymore. Nothing positive at least. Not only in the western markets but in Korea and other parts as well. We need some sort of major push towards 15k and above to get people back. Harder than ever now, especially with the big internet companies looking to censor us. 
I have zero intentions on trading in a bear market; bulls make money, bears make money, hogs get slaughtered.
That would pierce the resistance line heavily. That would be quite the fake out. A lot of BTC would have to be used. 
You think we break down out of it like we did the smaller one?

Indeed! Keep on it.
It's the same thing. Plug in the negative CDPR into the interest rate formula.  There aren't trends over 90 days that are negative, though. The 2014 column is the closest thing you can get. When there's a 2018 column eventually you might get an annual column that's negative for a while. The bottom line is that there aren't any negative long-term trends. Bitcoin only goes up year over year.
Some banks block the transactions entirely 
Both. In my opinion, the same person who would click buy on coinbase with their CC likely wouldn't go out of their way to get a cash advance. 
OTC is presumably still larger, but there is plenty of Big Money buying and selling on exchanges. I don't think that balance has shifted too much.
OTC market may be huge, but the coins sold OTC have to come from somewhere. And besides, retail does add up to a lot, it's just fragmented and hence can't set the direction. What's more if institutional money wants to set the direction, it has to do so on exchanges. And what's a whale if it's not big money?
It's not that bizarre when you can just call up your issuer and start a fraud case, potentially getting your money back and the crypto you purchased it with.
Dude the entire market is down like 60% since january and you think the bank is missing out? The majority of the people who are dumb enough to buy crypto with credit are also the people who buy tops and sell bottoms. 
It was the banks that issued the CC that didn't want CC being used for crypto and it's hard to blame them. Would you lend money to a friend/family member so they can buy crypto?
Add to it :D
I'm also long (but regretting it).  Let's confirm if every time i'm in a position and Chewie gets on the same position it ends up working well. 
I would add to the short if i was you :)
I'll probably jinx Chewie's chances :)
Options are:

1. Short here (rekt if breakout)
2. Long here (small loss if rejected)
3. Long after breakout (Bitmex will be a shitshow) 

I don't regret my decision
Perfect entry if this breaks through.
That didn't give up immediately after bouncing off $6,400. 

They've kept gradually inching upward for almost 24 hours now. 

Compared to their previous performances, they deserve a medal. 
I generally take a lot of low risk / high reward trades. When I can anyway. 
And it did. Im not saying it has any implications more than that. Although, if i had to bet, i would say we will go up now for a while.
Accumulation is such a ridiculous meme lol, people "accumulated" at $10k+. They "accumulated" a bunch of losses

"Accumulation" is just a variant of "this is good for bitcoin" 

You could very easily see it as redistribution 
I mean, the volume required to drop the price compared to the one needed to rise it . you can see it very well here : https://www.bfxdata.com/orderbooks/btcusd
a 65% decrease in 3 months is hardly a regular instrument of trade with rules 
To be fair, a stable bitcoin is much more attractive to people who actually want to use it for its purpose, as opposed to just an investment vehicle.
I like this scenario.  Need to get rid of all the degenerates jumping into leveraged portions everytime spot moves $1.
I'm not saying the bear market is over at all, if you read my comments you'll see I'm a believer that we'll go a lot further down over time.

My point is more an observation that herd mentality and people opening shorts off the back of a 30 second YouTube explainer video is a dangerous game to play.  

Seems we're going full circle from BTC buying mania, to people in the office talking of shorting BTC being the next big thing and guaranteed way to make money.
Do you (or anyone else) have an estimate for the proportion of coins being sold on the market that are freshly mined?
I don't think anyone cares about the death spiral anymore. I think most people would just wait the two weeks for the difficulty to readjust and then start mining it again. BTC will not be dethroned until another coin does something so progressive that everyone just goes, "yeah, that's better," and then BTC will be abandoned.
There are plenty of miners with free or very cheap electricity. They already own the mining equipment and it costs them nothing or next to nothing to run it. They won't stop mining.
We know from experience of 2 halvings what happens when the block reward drops by 50%. There is approximately a 10% reduction in hash power temporarily. Miners are more prepared than you might imagine to mine at a loss for a short time in order to ensure the long term survival of the coin.
We have seen bigger than these % price swings before and difficulty adjusted  
I feel pretty confident in saying that we will not see the hash rate plummet to 1/6 of its current levels because of a price drop. You're really blowing this risk out of proportion IMO
Which coins? Never heard of something like that happening.

Miners won't stop mining. Bitmain isn't afraid to speculate and blow away hundreds of millions to play games as 2017 has shown. 

Your scenario doesn't make sense if you play it to the end. Big miners can't let Bitcoin die, because if Bitcoin went into death spiral there would be no other profitable SHA256 coins to mine. Confidence in crypto as a whole would be lost completely and the entire market obliterated.

>If the ASIC farms in China stop mining BTC and switch to other SHA256 coins that are profitable, then the network is left with an absurdly high difficulty level and instead of blocks being found every 10 minutes, we are now maybe finding 1 block every hour or maybe couple of hours.

When people leave, even with high difficulty you can get more BTC for your hashrate, because blocks the old miners would normally mine are now mined by you and the other left over miners. While the block rate is (much) lower, the probability that you will get the block reward is higher. This will make mining attractive for other people who will start mining, until an equilibrium is reached between price and hashrate (and difficulty). So when the price goes lower, it will indeed affect the hashrate and block times (until the difficulty adjustment), but it goes gradually, there is no "hard floor" on the price which causes a "death spiral".
Id be more interested if/how core would implement an emergency difficulty adjustment.
I think most expect increasing users/holders/growth/utility/funds (which is a high probability occurrence barring something like Proof of Stake dominance.)

Not necessarily all time highs in the price metric.
That's true. And I do think the price will ATH within 2 years, because the bubble wasn't that big when compared with the previous bubble in 2013. I managed to sell near the top, so id like to see price fall further before rebuying.
That's because fundamentally this is worth more than gold. If we are to give Bitcoin the same market cap as gold it will be worth 400k a coin. That's where I think the top of this S curve lies. Now, whether or not the rest of the world understands that and is willing to pay for that is another question. 
I'm long from far down, so low risk, high reward for me. I'm not proposing you should go long, just making an observation.
when is the last time gdax had the most volume? was it back in dec?
> That guy bought like 1500 BTC? He almost made 1m already, what a beast.

He could sell at any time too.
Yeah I wonder how I could become one of those. 

so he has to sell i guess,

which lucky sod is gonna buy off him is the question. 

most prolly he buys it himself and the profit is from the shrimps pocket.
Use google. There is a ton written about this and you should come to your own conclusions. There's more to be understood than is reasonable for someone to post. It's not black and white.
If price finds resistance there my expectation is that it would be minor.
Accumulation and distribution are time-frame dependant. The idea is that if you have the knowledge of how these processes resolved, with the understanding of how time-frames relate to each other you can come to conclusions about how the higher time-frames are progressing.
 A single entity or a group of unrelated individuals makes no difference in terms of accumulation and distribution. Both are simply representing the shifting sentiment of the market. Perhaps I should say for every unit sold 1 unit was bought. 

The key is that both traders do not hold their positions for an equal amount of time. If buyers hold for longer then no new  supply enters the system, and as the sellers close sooner they add to the demand.


Can you blame anyone? $12k to $6k to $12k to $9k to $12k to $6k. in less than two months! 

And remember when the calls for $7.5k sounded ridiculous and we went to $6k?

$3-4k is about as likely as $13k at this point imo
>This is what people said when we got down to 15k. Then when we got down to 10k...

True, true. However, we bounced off of $6000 in February, we just bounced off of $6400. If the price holds steady, I would say that's a bullish long term double bottom. 
yea exactly. Really feels now like the energy has gone and we are holding on with our fingertips again, trying to prevent the next wave down... The bulls tried but it doesn't look like it's enough at all. 

If you can't break current resistance..well the 7200 is never going to break as it stands
> shows that a lot more ppl are comfortable shorting in this range.

That's a pretty weak ass bearish indicator. All I see are huge amounts of short positions from inexperienced people that are prepped to get liquidated in a cascade, just like yesterday. 

I'm not *trying* to be bullish here necessarily, but I don't see how you can be bearish about shorts skyrocketing and the price remaining steady.
If the whales keeps short squeezing with their little pumps, shorters will lose confidence, which leads to even more short squeeze.
So people think they're going to win big time against the house, that always wins? What brave gamblers. I salute them.
No it's not necessarily bullish, this has happened every time we dump and go sideways. it's more that people don't like shorting on a contract that's already at a large discount when we're just going sideways. 

and it being down 2/3 doesn't mean it's still not extremely overvalued. 
IF I USE RAW NUMBERS INSTEAD OF PERCENT IT MAKES IT SEEM LIKE MORE.
It means bitmex cowboys are bullish. It also doesn't necessarily mean people are opening longs--it could be closing shorts. 
LOL you're so right
That’s what people should understand... you should never be greedy. It goes both ways.
As someone who's been in this game for a while, I don't see it as "down 13,000." I see it as having given us a glimpse of what it can do before settling back into its steady long-term churn upward.  I still think 7.3K would be a good entry for a quick short snipe, but God help ya bears if people start to think in terms of Bitcoin vs traditional investments and re-allocate accordingly.  One thing is for sure: If we are headed for a big traditional market crash, we'll soon find out if Bitcoin does what it was designed to do (i.e., f^ck the bankers -- see genesis block message). Something tells me it will perform marvelously when the hands are extended for the next banker handout/bailout.
Massive 1929 Stock crash that defined a century was 48% in two months and the greedy bears here want BTC to go down even more than 20k to 6k still.  It is absurd.  At some point you have damaged your investment forever and something else just takes over.  All that precious BTC you hoarded and shorted for is a bunch of 1s and 0s that no one wants anymore.  People just decide to rebuild by buying Ethereum or something more technologically advanced instead.
alas no, I use a weighted moving average of 144 and a smoothed moving average of 5. I have collated months and months of data, what happens after crossovers on multiple time frames, what the average rises/falls are, how long they last on average..that sort of thing.

What we need pretty damn soon is that climb up over 7200 or we're looking at a bit of pullback coming in. The pessimist would say a fall of at least 5 to 8% over the next 2 days, the optimist could say a few percent only over the next 4 to 5 hours maybe.
Rebreaching 7.7-8 would mean reentering the long term log support that was broken fairly decisively. We don't know if that will be resistance yet but I'd say it's likely.
Most of my analysis recently has been focusing on altcoin vs bitcoin pairs because when Bitcoin goes down, everything else usually follows.

However, I do often compare and contrast Bitcoin's movements to the ALT vs BTC pairs (although not as much in my last few posts) as there are certainly correlations. Historically when Bitcoin falls, Alt vs BTC pairs also fall, so any deviation from that pattern makes an interesting point of reference.
The steemit markup works better for the post format, as you can easily embed pictures. Note that the posts are set to "power up" mode, meaning that 100% of revenue goes into Steemit voting power.

I appreciate his daily posts here. 
His posts are good, and also you don’t have to look at them. 
We still have the giant triangle? I thought that was broken a while ago. Alright.
I'm not sure I understand still. How is the first one bullish? 
Well I get that one. Why would you sell when bitcoin is 110% guaranteed to be $100k? It's a no brainer, btc will go up forever 
A while back someone said to me that because the price has only ever gone up over time, that technically everything so far has been good for bitcoin -_-
we need an intervention 
The assumption here is that people want to buy bitcoin to own, as opposed to on leverage. These people will drive the price up in the short term, but when the last people start buying (the shoeshine boys, as they say), that's your sell signal. Reason being, who's left to buy after the shoeshine boys? So people googling "how to buy bitcoin" is great for the short term, but leads to a lot of weak hands in the market. Many of them will sell when the price starts dropping. 

Conversely, imagine everybody that was buying is now buying on leverage. Well, now you have an issue. Instead of being afraid of people selling, you now have the "Chads" getting force liquidated on downward movements. That's what we can expect with "normies" now flocking to short bitcoin. They can drive the price down, sure, but that's also a lot of overleveraged easy liquidation bait.

The fact is that the shoeshine boys aren't going to get into something as complicated as margin trading, so the people googling it now probably *are* your shoeshine boys.

I've still got my shorts on, but I'm not nearly as confident as I was. I'm being very careful and meticulous with each open position, and I'm very aware that the end of easy shorts is almost certainly near.
My comment is about the contradictory logic. 

Which you are attempting to use again. Unless you're arguing that people googling bitcoin is bearish? In which case I'd love to know why, since it seems Google trends have pretty accurately reflected bitcoin price growth 

Sure, a bunch of idiots will get burned shorting a local bottom. By no means does that indicate a long term reversal. The buy pressure will have to come from somewhere. "Chad" getting burned doesn't mean everyone else in the space is suddenly going to want to buy 

I'm not saying there can't be a reversal here- I just don't get the logic. 
I can't edit my original comment for some reason. assume I removed the last sentence/second half of it. 

Almost everyone was arguing that people googling bitcoin in November was bullish. I mean why wouldn't it be...?

It's not a strawman if I'm asking people who believe both statements. a strawman is when I accuse someone specifically of making  an argument they haven't made. Nice try though. 
Only lately. I've been in the btc scene for about 6 months, half of which it was going up, which I was virtually almost long for. 

First time I shorted was at $13k when it dumped to $10k and after that I gradually switched over primarily to shorting. After rejection of $13k from $12k breakout I basically stopped going long. I'm considering it much more often lately than I was a few weeks ago 

I get people saying bottom shorters will get rekt. and they will. but to me it indicates sentiment is terrible and no one wants to buy. 

The majority of the market being bearish *is* bearish to me. People like to contrary trade but it only works when the sentiment is completely, 100% unified imo. 

Last year btc skyrocketed because most people believed it was going to skyrocket
https://www.moonmath.win/faq.html
it means lambos
Azop ran his rainbows from a fixed date using a fixed CDPR of about 0.333%. Sometimes he would change the CDPR. Moon Math introduced a dynamic rate based on observed price performance that pretty much always stays in that range. However, the rainbow will drift up and down from Azop's charts because it's not fixed. I'll correct the rainbow so it more accurately represents his latest chart when major drift becomes obvious or on request.

tl;dr; the rainbow needed to be moved up to keep it consistent with /u/azop's vision.
> This time around not even 7000 seems feasible.

6990 how I have the resistance line.

Going to squeeze this triangle's range to the sharpest narrowest point possible it seems.
more and more shorts grow while the price remains steady. All it's going to take is one or two whales to liquidate every overleveraged short for easy money.
was having issues on PC earlier
ya but I love it 
No fucking way aint touching bitmex anytime soon.
If you visit their subs many people are still buying this dip to DCA
Yeah probably true. 
The coin that did not much for a year, then near the end of year, it went parabolic, I thought it was gonna pass BTC..
is gonna Dipple and Cripple
Some of the alts have very promising technologies. VEN is one of them. They would authenticate high end items at pos through blockchain. Don’t let primitive tribalism and greed cloud your judgement and lump all alts together. Wishing financial harm and suffering on multitudes of people you don’t even know for the sake of your own greed represents the worst in humanity. Crypto will change the world and hopefully some of these legitimate alts with great tech will contribute as well. 
> Long means you think its going to go up, but then you say overall sentiment is (at) worst bearish. 

You bet against the herd rather FOMO in with them at the top. Bearish sentiment is bullish ;)

> When it pops it will be like 20k top but inverse (so crazy rises?).

Blow-off-top goes hyperbolic to 20k. Blow-off-bottom goes hyperbolic to Xk.

> with some sick wicks.

Briefly.

> FUD with SEC, which indicates it will go down

Which indicates people will short. Counter-parties for longs, a good thing.

> you say it will go down to 6.6k and 5.8k. .. You gonna short or long!?

*So My guess is a long between 6.6k and 5.8k with 1x to 3x to avoid liquidation*

Setting bids for lower entry on a long. Low enough leverage that the rest of the stack can cover it down to Xk if needbe. If it hits good entry (potentially), if it doesn't no risk taken only Opportunity Cost of having funds waiting for order.

> So what is it!?!

We never know until it happens. 

These are the risks and rewards on the table with the sentiments behind them and the counter-parties motivations. 

It's not about win-rate but risk/reward.
It's never easy with bitcoin lol :D.

I'm not shorting this yet, I'm long 2x for now.

I'm expecting a big short squeeze : 
https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsqueeze.asp

But also expecting it to go lower after : 
https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deadcatbounce.asp

The SEC fud didn't have an impact on the price, so I went long with a 2x margin at 7035.

https://www.investopedia.com/university/how-be-trader/beginner-trading-fundamentals-leverage-and-margin.asp
I think it's funny that people think that if the short interest there is only 47% it's actually a low ratio.  It's not like 50/50 is normal, a historic norm, or at all what should be expected.  The short interest right now is very very high.  Almost 30,000 shorts which will need to close.  Not a problem as long as this is a long term bear market, but if this ends up being a correction in a longer term bull market, it's a real issue.
Don't worry about longs, its easy to get usd funding or even print some usdt and leverage long with btc as collateral. 

And longs have been rekted lately, to push it further down, you need a lot of BTC to do it.

To short you need BTC funding, not that easy to get and there aren't much available on finex. 


The market is here to take your money not give you money. Overall it's bearish.

Market makers want to make money, the easiest part now is to rekt the shorts not the longs. So shoot it up trigger some stop losses and liquidations then dump it.

Same scenario at 11.7k but the inverse direction.
I mean you're right, all of the theories lately on why we will see a run up are based on indirect, non meaningful buying- short squeezes and contrarian trading. I don't see how that's particularly bullish. if I subscribed to this line of thinking it wouldn't lead me to believe we'll see a sustained run up but more of a pump fakeout.

Good show, you told me good and proper you did.
Yes, exactly! The composition of the market seems like it's in position to make a dramatic shift.
Because I wasn't looking at the chart on Sunday and I didn't spend time reviewing the implications of the move until now.
I think some 6k btc worth of shorts closed during that pump.. Could've been 3k though I don't remember. 

Also, I really doubt EW practitioners are moving the market in any significant manner

I didn't mean to imply any specific reason for the pump- more that people expecting a pump seem to have forgotten about the 25% pump we already saw just like 10 days ago 
Yes let's see if we can maintain it.

She doin' it. This looks like it might have some legs but I don't know how far we'll go, really. There's just so much resistance on the way up. I'm torn, really
That makes sense, thanks!
That's funny, because my charts on the longer timeframes (1D especially) show a clear downtrend, whereas shorter timeframes (4hr and below) are unpredictable because of the high intraday volatility. 

Yet so many people here continue to call up and downtrends based on 1 hour charts, or worse, 15 min and 5 min price action. 
No currently not at a computer

Learned expensive lessons trading from my phone..... 
Yes but futures on bitmex is priced lower 
If Bitcoin is really supposed to do good in a stock bear market, then why are both falling right now?
All Rhodiums lead to goblin town.

Explain yourself why this one is fake and not the dip to 6500. For all we know that kraken whale may have caused the dip to buy cheap later.
Nah it’s done now. 
Maybe.  It's too early to call.  It would make sense of $6400 was as low as it's going before a huge bounce, but again, way too early to call right now.

Happy?
Probably the bug we're seeing today.
SEC is drawing blood now. Alts should be panicking about their pet "projects"
The author of the tweet said himself is the source.
its the opposite atm
Yeah kinda suprised by this. Don't get me wrong, I like when btc increases in value. But this feels more like a beartrap.
The fading sell volume is another part of the story. If bears aren't going to sell it isn't going down.
People keep saying that but everyone on here seems pretty bullish. 
For every real "bear" human, there are like 10 bear $hills e.g. accounts publishing 24/7 about how this is the end of Bitcoin like if it was their job...

Not saying we're in the best mood possible, but this is not an organic "sentiment" at all so don't read too much into it.
Really? Kinda looks like resistance at this point.
Can’t tell if you’re joking. We been going under over for a while now. 
I never understood why then, if you can not reap the profits from a high leverage small position why do it? 
Ahh, thank you very much for this. It really wasn't very clear. And yes I'll cautious, I'm not even convinced I personally will use leverage but it's good to understand how to utilise it correctly. 
That makes sense now! Thanks for that. You're right, it's not extremely clear. 
Right, but then I would look for a lower entry. Now looks like BTC just sliding downwards 7k trendline
6897 currently. 
I'm still in my short but it's a tossup to me. Could Also see almost an inverse of the action that happened at 6.5 (which went to 6.4 then shot up), a quick fakeout to 7.1 and then a drop
or the other short bearish movement from the 7.1 tops

I'm asking myself the same questions

given the size of the triangle (small) I don't think we can count it as a continuation of the larger bear, though
They have to sell to fund their operations. Maybe not all coins they mined, but I imagine they don't subscribe to the hodl mentality 
On Kraken i believe you can do that in one order only
Right, I was planning to set a ‘conditional close’ in that 7-7.2k region. You can do this on Kraken...
pretty plz.
Whys that?
I hope soo
[deleted]
This seems to be no man's land. Depending on how you draw it the line might be right bellow or right above...
It's this. We are hitting into this resistance line without enough strength to break through it.

If it goes we should hit 7200 before encountering the next level of resistance. If our current positions fails however i'd expect a reasonable drop 
Indeed, stops ready, mom's spaghetti
I would say is more that in a bull trend bull patterns are accurate and bear ones arent and viceversa. This being sideways so who knows.
I dobit that we will have to wait “years”. Infrastructure, fundamentals, brand awareness, accessibility, regulations... everything is on much higher level now. And I didn’t even mention “the halving” which will happen in 2 years and will get priced in much earlier. 
Lol well if I didn’t think bitcoin was ever gonna hit another all time high... then I wouldn’t deal in the crypto market.
No.
Long or short it's a boring post that doesn't provide any insight.
Which is why I find it hilarious that people here are suggesting this sub is being bearish - people seem pretty damn bullish to me.
Calculation?
The previous step had a similar behavior but due to heavier sell pressure it makes it harder to see. I'm still bearish and feel that these pumps are being orchestrated, but it can go on like this for a while. The first real test should be on the next pump, it has to buy 1600 btc on bitfinex to get above 7200... 
On bitfinex the wedge is not so pronounced, but i can see something similar to that yes.
Ya I see it that way too. That is a very sickly looking formation, but a good chunk of people in here think it is the starts of a reversal. I think it’ll fail and we’ll enter a new psychological low
I know, but so far we've reached the blue circle as expected. 
We're about to see in less than an hour
It is April. I read the same thing for three months now. BTC can barely keep around 7k. So many normies got burned, you think they want to lose more money?
$10k before it dove to $6k
Lick my dick you cross eyed gerbil 
Thing is, as much as I'm not entirely convinced that many shorting here have the slightest clue what they're doing (i.e. shorting the bottom), I'm really not seeing the huge push for the price to increase either, which is why I suspect it'll naturally decline unless some bull whales start pumping. 
Heard this one a lot..being contrarian to the contrarians has been profitable since the breakdown from 11.7k
Aren't they confident for a good reason? The price has done nothing but reaffirm that it is a bear market and it has more room to go down. Maybe you should realize this too if you have an interest in staying solvent instead of going broke believing in a fairy tale that this is not a bubble. 
Bulls aren't too confident when they call for endless ATH bubbles to come but people shorting a collapsing asset are just stupid amateurs. 

It really is a foolproof syllogism you employ to deduce this optimal trading strategy : 

Friend goes short

Friend is stupid amateur 

Stupid amateurs are never right 

Ergo

We should do the opposite of your stupid amateur friend.

QED

You are a true professional trader, my deepest admiration sir. 
Stay safe please binary. At least you're a long timer here, I have no idea who the fuck the other perma-bulls are that have come out of nowhere recounting fairytales about their grandpas and uncles shorting Bitcoin and how bullish an indicator that is.  
you could make a bot just posting extremely low or high orders , then another that trade on that yes. So like buys at 1k and sells at 20k, then measure the average vs the now

The question is then, how to know which direction to go ?
Next time don't set such tight stops, and don't use 10x leverage for gods sake. If it was maximum 5x you wouldn't have to have such a tight stop, in these choppish zones where we are trading kind of between a channel you should have already set your stop losses at a point where it would be rather obvious we were breaking out of the channel downwards or upwards. 
Misery loves company! Same exact thing happened to me (that makes it twice in two days)...got shaken out by that drop, went all out on my all in position. But I was extra stubborn, even though I locked in my losses on that drop I went back all in afterwards during the recovery. Had to sweat for a few hours, but it finally paid off.
I think caring about wicks it's pointless. At low volume a lot of fakeouts happen and it's not indicative by themselves of resistance being higher or support lower. 

Unless you really care about what happens in the wicks. Useful for daily candles
google news -> bitcoin
Yeah but the accompanying terms are "how to short" ;)
[removed]
Same, but it's sort of a listless breakdown.
Indeed was looking at the longer term one and exactly where I was thinking of my stops, though I am tempted to move stops to more like 7250 incase it wicks up to brush 7200
What I did last time worked okay for me--closed 20%ish when we stalled there, watched the 1m very closely waiting for a high volume green candle and immediately market closing. I'm doing this on kraken margin though and not bitmex contracts
Be sure you got $$ to cover. No Nose dive.

Haha help me.. I can't!! 
no 
I think I am too. Can anyone confirm? 
ICU
Thanks dude!
It was all of 24 hours ago
Pretty sure it was downvoted for low-effort nonsense
$4k doesn't seem nearly as scary now as it did 2 months ago, at least for me.
I agree with 4k, possibly 3k briefly but that will be the despair part before we 'return to mean', and probably go sideways for a while before we recover.
"Yay, 4k, we are up 4x from the same time last year."
But also 3k 2k 1k $500 and I guess people would be pretty upset with <$10
I think most the panic sellers are gone by now, mostly just people feeling the pain and seeing it going lower but probably not going to sell between here and wherever the bottom is because most can see 3-4k as a bottom so most likely it won't get there, the giant red panic sellers are gone.   We probably chill around here maybe a little lower until steam picks up again. 
The only despair I'll have at those prices is where to find more fiat. Upvoted for considering the outlandish. 
I just don’t understand this concept, which I have seen many times over the last months. For one, one person’s ‘despair’ - which I take to mean a potential loss if you were to sell all - is still another person’s in-profit point. So we are not all going to feel the same at the same time because we all bought in at different cost prices. 
Secondly, history has shown that each time there’s a massive correction, the bottom is still way higher than last time, and if you believe in the long-term future ( which some of us here do, don’t we?) then the bottom we are seeking now , is still going to be in profit for many - as per my first point. 
So despair is no longer a reasonable sentiment to measure where you think the bottom is. When the margin of play was narrower a couple of years ago, it may have been a greater likelihood that 90% were going to be in negative from an 80% correction. But today, with the price in the thousands even after a 70% correction, and the market so much more populated I don’t think it’s true now.  I get really fed up seeing that statement  - not accusing you alone as many have said it, but it just doesn’t mean anything. 

The bottom could be 6k or 3k and still people won’t necessarily be in ‘despair’, also because ( third reason) - they believe in the long-term reversal anyway so it just becomes a waiting game . And at whatever price, traders will just carry on trading won’t they? 

‘Crying for mercy’? I just don’t know what you actually mean by that in the context of all I have said above.

this time it's different
That’s a great entry. 
Just curious why is up to 9k then dump to 5k bull fud? Compared to your short time frame?
I hope it will push trhough watchingit right now at bitfinex prices of coins is a little bit stagnant right now
I hope it will push trhough watchingit right now at bitfinex prices of coins is a little bit stagnant right now

Just consider a range, not the exact price. if price varied 0.25% over 4 hours i guess that would serve well enough.
Doesn't look so yet, we are still fighting for 7.1
[deleted]
My heart is telling me breakdown, but my mind is telling me reset.  (not being sarcastic)
Because bears are now as delusional as the moonkids were at 15k+. And this will end for the bears as it ended for the moonkids.
And a link to his uncle...
Buying pressure hasn’t been insane so far
he is just slowly but surely dumping right now. 
This is not a falling wedge on any timeframe....
Please explain why would/could Bitcoin reach 1k now? 
lol thanks for the laugh. sub 1k? won't happen
I don't think that many people set orders for a few months and just forget about them lol. 
All this has happened before, and will happen again. Apparently, those were the same talking points that permabears used in early 2013, before the run up to $1200 and after the bubble to $270. The price peaked at $270 in March, then dropped hard and didn't recover to $270 until November of 2013... When the famous run to $1200 was beginning. 
https://www.coindesk.com/price/

What about this site? According to this the recent low was $6800 and within the last week. Maybe gdax price collapses to 5886 but other exchanges were above 7000 at the same time? Giving an average around 7000?
Too much Eve in Adam and Eve 
Yeah I feel like it’s shouting at me when I haven’t done anything wrong
I think that he was referring to the pump and dump aspect of these markets.
Yeah. I'm still buying
But I think that is the hodl mentality. Although I get what you meant by that, the true philosophy of hodl should just be - an investment you ride out until you need the money. The word has become imbued with a fanatical tone as if an idiot hodling would never ever sell. What would be the point of that? That’s hoarding not hodling. It’s just the opposite strategy to trading. 
Btc is worth what the last person paid for it, so the effects of hodling can go either way by causing more liquidity or less.
It was needed because they were buying not hodling. I feel like it's a question of time frames and how heavily btc is being more and more manipulated.
A couple I know are planning to wire in $ this week. Not sure their price target (they're certainly susceptible to fomo).
I honestly won’t sell. But only because I was insanely lucky and sold enough of my stack at the ATH that I realized an almost 10000% return on my initial total outlay so I figure that no matter how much it falls I may as well stay in the remainder for the long haul. I held for periods of over a year where it dropped from almost $2000 back to sub $300 and then stagnated forever so this feels no different to me. 
Those were retail investors purchasing through exchanges by and for themselves. In a cryptocurrency group that meets in my city I can tell you there’s around 40 more that were smaller purchases <5 BTC.
Ridiculous? Not at all! In the crypto group at the peak in December around 110 people showed up. For March meet there was 18.
I understood the intention, I just don't know how relevant those earlier points of contact actually are / how much support they could be expected to offer
You bet. And it also helps me to hear that my own story may be of service to you now, so thank you.

Depending on your predilections, you might (or might not) find something of interest and comfort in this version of the Tao Te Ching. At least I did: https://web.archive.org/web/20090127034456/http://gospelofthomas.fol.nl/taoteching.html

Again, good luck.
Bitcoin: “Hold my beer”
world govt fines of 10k for every bitcoin you own
i aint touching swaps with a pole, short on june futs.
And they were right! We did hit a bottom and went up quite a bit. It's pointless to watch sentiment and project long-term movement - it's a day's worth at best.
Did you look at the open shorts chart? 
And were are we now? It doesn't means that it won't keep going down. But a lot of shorters got rekt.  Just like I've been saying for days.
3k would be around the same percentage of decline from ATH as the bubble pop in 2014 so it is pretty realistic.
Well said bro..LOL..
If bounce isn't strong around 6k we will probably start digging down there probably, God help us all except for those who are taking their shorts to the grave.
Also interesting to see that so far we have had 3 tops around 7.2 and each was slightly lower than the previous. Playing out like 9.2 all over again. 
Thanks bud, it was all this year. It's in my comment history, but I did the first 33% buy when we hit $6,700 a couple of weeks ago. 
Maybe your uncle is a smart guy that sees the writing on the wall?

Nah, I'm sure anyone that doesn't post on Reddit is a clueless dunce and we ought to use their sentiment for counter trading. 

Going 25x long since your uncle is doing the opposite. Google trends, market sentiment, spot exchange volume all be damned. 
not a huge impact. most people have several cards
You don't have to go out of your way tho, its just coded different in the background you see it in your billing statement. 
thats a good point.  you could potentially buy crypto, put it in your hardware wallet.  And then report fraud haha!
i imagine they were making a shit ton in fees from ppl buying with credit
I think it was more about the rampant fraud and cc carding. nothing easier than cashing out ccs to crypto 
The potential long term price of Bitcoin could easily be worth more than any interest Credit card companies charge.  Theres also the option to buy and transfer to a low interest or 0% interest for 12-20 months.  20 months from now do you really think Bitcoin will be worth less than 20k?  Also give an example of an asset you can buy with a credit card that has the potential to go 2x, 3x within 1-3 years?  and continue to appreciate from there over the long term.  Banks issue credit/debt based on fiat.  Bitcoin is the antithesis of this.  Its the first time in history that a person can own an asset like that.  Perhaps you could argue that buying on credit is a bet your Bitcoin will be worth more than the credit you were given.
I'm so confused about this movement that it's tiny short. Won't be surprised if Chevy is right here.
1.) rekt if breakout? I disagree, shouldn't be too bad if its not overleveraged, but maybe thats how you trade.

2.) small loss if rejected? I think this could go violently down just as fast as it could violently go up.. But yeah, you are right. It's a tight stop.

3.) Don't try to trade breakouts on such a small time frame, mostly because they are often false but also cuz bitmex. You can get a safe entry with patience on real breakouts. with lower risk
4. Don't force yourself into a position now AND don't FOMO a breakout. After confirmation of breakout, slowly get in to market.

9/10 times a breakout in bitcoin don't just spike up and leave everyone missing out. The vast majority of them breakout, retest resistance turned support (or vice versa), and make plenty of continuation patterns along the way. 

Why not tight stops on a short to prevent rekt?
I'm short swaps at $7k, but long June futs at $64xx. I currently have stops on the short at $7340 looking for a potential breakout. That about track with your clear breakout signal target? 
lol, i think its just that kraken whale unloading his 1500 btc stash from 6.4k ever so very slowly but surely.

the guys a baller. 
I've just started looking at this. I think this move would invalidate the scenario that a lot of traders are operating with. If that happens I expect a lot of people to stop trading this market... Which would be positive. Removing traders probably removes the vast majority of bear pressure medium-term. I think you're onto something with this.
Where's the Wyckoff experts when you need them?
For every bitcoin that is accumulated by someone, someone else distributed it lol
My understanding of "Accumulation" is that certain price is looking better for buying than selling for long term.

In hindsight, Feb. 1st - 6th was good period for accumulating, while Feb. 14th-20th was good for unloading. Even though price on 1st was ~$10k, and 14th was ~$9k.

But I have to agree, linking accumulation with price range (especially short-mid term) is plain wrong. Everyone wants to buy lower and sell higher. :)
people have been saying this for a while. High volume selling and low volume climbing is not bullish 
But a 0% net change should be November! # S T A B L E C O I N
it takes time to achieve stable price


Well, a coin that basically always grows is even more attractive.
and that's what banks want I assume; something nice and fairly predictable

this is another indicator for me, that Bitcoin is lost and it's time to move on to other crypto
> a 30 second YouTube explainer video

So much this.
That's the trillion dollar question...
Most miners are selling OTC, so the market doesn't come into play. The ones selling via market are selling enough to move the market.
I don't know, but I would really like to know, and I am thinking about how to go about figuring it out.
Difficulty doesn't change every 2 weeks.
Here's the math:

2 block weeks is exactly 2016 blocks. That's 144 blocks per day. In a perfect scenario 2 block weeks = 2 calendar weeks. In reality this isn't the case as variations mean 2 block weeks cause it to be shorter or longer than 2 calendar weeks.

2 block weeks at let's say 1 block per hour: 24 blocks per day. 2016 blocks (2 block weeks) / 24 blocks per day = 84 days until the difficulty resets. That's approximately 84 days of not being able to conduct transactions on the network.
Catcoin is an example:

https://bitcointalk.to/index.php?topic=380130.msg4577427#msg4577427

Thread referenced is about the time when the problems started for Catcoin. They later had to hard fork the coin to fix the issue with miners leaving the difficulty too high.
I realize you weren't necessarily saying this, but if we're depending on miners to keep the price afloat then I think crypto really is a dead man walking.
They probably expect all of the above but especially new ATH. 
Fundamentally better than gold? What makes it so? 
Assuming there are no alt coins.  Which there are.  That high valuation depends on the market shunning alt coins, which is not likely.
Maybe he was taking profit on a short? So won't be selling

If I were him I would just sell a bit with every green candle... Or short and cause a dip later on with it for maximum assholiness.
I was looking at THIS group and its understanding of what factors in the cryptocurrency market make it a Bull or Bear. Anyone can google but that doesn’t tell you if anyone around you actually has an understanding. My particular conclusion through observation of the past several years is that if enough people tell enough people that it is either a bull or bear market, they all react accordingly. Belief is all that really matters. In other words, if the vocal pundits said it’s a Bull market, like they did in October through December, it would in fact become a Bull market despite any TA to the contrary. Am I incorrect?
Thanks for your insight!
What're you considering a higher time frame? longer? Why not just say longer and shorter? 
If you look at Bitcoin's history 2-3k is on the extreme side of a percentage retrace from ATH, only happened once, so ya extreme.   Possible but an extreme call either way.
>  If the price holds steady, I would say that's a bullish long term double bottom.

price has to break the neckline for it to be a double bottom
What is a “double bottom”? I see your point but I just feel people read too much meaning into anything that can be given a name. It could come back to 6000 ten times, fifty. Hitting it twice just means it’s hit it twice. 
Still though bears aren't exactly trampling, a big green pump out of nowhere is not out of the question
> All I see are huge amounts of short positions from inexperienced people

Oops, your bias is showing, cover it up dude.
mpst of the really big shorts have opened in the high 7k low 8k range.

we will have a sustained bounce when these big whales close, think they feel we can push this down to 5k and then we bounce from there.

this 6k half arsed bounce is not really bringing in any buyers into the picture.
Being overvalued based on what? This is a new asset class. Its value is based on whatever people are willing to attribute to it.
That's bullish isn't it? At least short term
The pump/dump should happen in less than 2 hours. Pump if the pattern repeats and dump if this was just another bull trap to put us right bellow the resistance.
People make a new one every time one is broken lmao 
That is true. If everyone would just hodl, BTC could be worth trillions per coin!
Your first statement was a classic strawman, asking someone to agree/disagree with both points, one of which is germane (bitmex trends being near ATH) the other of which is not (I'm not hearing anyone talk about how an increase in google searches for bitcoin is bullish) 
Sorry, I must not understand the question then. What are you asking specifically and from whom specifically do you want to hear answers?
I look forward to bullish optimistic Sloppy again when the market finally changes direction.  Hopefully dispassionate T-1000 Sloppy is making money in this bear market though :D
I had it @6985 and not even that was reached... This is crazy...
Now it's more descending triangle

https://www.tradingview.com/x/lAZjADyO/

Or could be a drunk bull flag on the 1hr..
I was saying it even failed to got to 6880, and it pumps past the resistance and restarts falling. I think i'll go to sleep. Leaving my long from @7000 just for science... stops @6890 for double the position so i enter a short on the spot. After all this fight if it breaks 6900 only to come back again i'll go berserk
scared of the system overlord? lol
yes, and they are likely in it to the end and will not be selling any time soon.
It's garbage.
Why do you need a blockchain for that? And how does VEN ensure the physical item has been tagged appropriately? If it's using rfid tags or something (I don't know as I've only glanced at VEN) then what is the blockchain providing? An audit trail so that any tampering from factory to store can be approximately identified?

Why does the token need to have a speculative monetary value associated to it for this to work? Especially if it is PoS based (i.e. the chain will end up with a handful of super nodes doing most of the verification work).

What incentive is there for a large multinational company to audit their byzantine supply chain with a non-customisable third party blockchain token that's less than 1 year old (in its current incarnation), whose utility is suspect, whose supply is limited and whose price fluctuates?

Answer: none. This is why you see companies like BMW playing with IOTA. They are not ever going to seriously use it. Rather they offer the project a "partnership" with their internal, tiny startup focused unit. It will go nowhere but it makes BMW look good and modern and it gives the project a sexy "partnership" to shill to their investors. Win/win (but not in the way bag holders think).
> Some of the alts have very promising technologies.

Exactly. Did you reply to the wrong post? 
Thanks man, you explained it better than I did myself
These things can be true. While also being very likely to swing negative before we see any true reversal. 

A lot of sideways will close those positions and refill the books, at which point they can re-short the tops (or bottoms) and get liquidated into a bullrun (or re-short and win, either way). Given time funding will become available, cheaply enough.
Makes perfect sense. Beautiful really as I guess they'll also be able to kick off the dump with the help of FOMO longs being liquidated at the top of the short squeeze i.e. it wont cost them much to get the dump going and then they can sit patiently below waiting for people to sell in to them at $5K or $3K or whatever.
I was under the impression that a short squeeze is always a bull run.
So it's a model. I get that, but even a model should scale. Does the model scale to our current price level and remain accurate?
What's the usefulness of it if half the time it's right and half the time it's wrong? For example, it appears that mid-2014 the model started deviating from actual BTC price and forming an inverse pattern. Am I misinterpreting it?

Edit: Oops you aren't the one who created it. Sorry.
Eye, it be reet
I'm just as sad as you are bud
Yes, I witnessed that shift last night in MEX trollbox.

there was a lot of cocky arrogance & bravado early evening,
later, as the green candles came, much "gently caressing" & ragequit.

people need to learn not to spit in the plate they eat from.
I've been paying less attention, but is there not the same benchmark for exiting the bear market as there was a month ago? Over log resistance, then confirmed with a break off $12k?
Speaking of short squeezes, didn't someone post here recently that 1/4 of bitfinex shorts had their liqui points at around $7.3K? Force closing the majority of those might provide enough juice for a 25% bounce. We'll already be at 12.5% if we touch $7.2K.

I guess that puts the likely extreme upper limit of this bounce at around $8K (factoring in the enormous resistance that would be there anyway if BTC managed to kiss it).
Yeah it's yellow you're good. And that's a pretty good bear div, clearly defined imo.
It's yellow :p And thanks.
Wouldn't the regular bull divergence there cancel out the hidden bear divergence? (Still learning so seriously wondering)
I'm not sure what the funny part here is. Long term charts certainly show a downtrend -- but that doesn't mean the price is just going to keep going down forever, does it? At the same time, people claiming X price would be a 'reversal' are a bit too high on hopium. Like, let's say we bounce and trend upwards for a few weeks from here, to 10-12k levels. Does that mean everyone's gonna pile in and buy buy buy til we're at 20k+ again? I don't know, I don't think so. 

My point is, given how far down we already are, I don't think being short 'long term' is comfortable any more, despite the clear downtrend on longer timeframes -- but likewise any kind of a move up can easily end up being a fake out or a temporary relief rather than a long term return to bull.
might end up working out okay for you anyway!
my bad
Maybe btc drop was imminent after that pump and had nothing to do with stocks dropping.
and have a obvious ceiling based on mining profitability (when its affordable to use X technique to extract it), also happens with petroleum and fracking. Plus the risk (also shared with petroleum) of someone developing a new technique... On the other hand, with crypto the "only" risk is that demand disappears. Like it happened with uranium in 2005-7 or so. 
To me it looks like someone is trying to sell their coins above 7k before the next dump. They prop the price up just under 7k and sell once its over. This will keep going down yet. 

Think about how many new coins are being mined each day, there needs to be a buyer for them to sustain this price.
 
At the moment, the average person isn't going to buy in because the mainstream "news" isn't telling them to. 
Its more alarming that after 3 years they are still a solution in search of a problem.
Great.

edit: /s
I get why you'd think that when suddenly people appear out of the woodwork as soon as bitcoin begins to decline, but you have to remember how many people there are that fall under any of the following categories:

1. have gotten burnt by buying high and selling low
2. have "missed the train" and watched it go from $200 to $20000 and need to justify why they didn't buy in
3. have been harassed, stalked, and/or threatened by bitcoin maximalists
4. have a penchant for being contrarian and "devil's advocates"
5. genuinely think bitcoin is a failure in several ways and are trying to warn people to stay out to avoid financial ruin


Very few of them are going to come in here when the price is exploding, because no one is going to listen. When the price is dumping, people sober up and pay more attention to neutral/bearish commentary, and these people feel more justified in expressing their thoughts and views. 

I get why it's annoying to you, but it's a healthy thing imo. Bitcoin needs skeptics and naysayers to test its validity and find its purpose. 

Some of the commentary is ridiculous, but it's better than "to the moon1!" 24/7. 

edit: if your argument is that it's not "organic" in the sense that these people no longer participate in price discovery- I would say that's actually a good point to take into consideration. I was mainly explaining that there are real people that feel this way and that they aren't just bank shills or something. Perhaps that wasn't really your argument though. 
Well it's holding well above 7K so far.
Why hello csasker. Hope you're doing well.  

I'm enjoying [the book](https://www.amazon.com/Market-Wizards-Interviews-Top-Traders/dp/0135560934) you suggested. Happy easter :).  
I'm confused what you're asking? 
Long from 7000 with tight stop @6950. Time to put some money where my mouth is. 
Profit stops starting @7150, i can see a lot of resistance up there.
Good luck to us.
I'm on the sidelines waiting for a better signal.  If you ain't tradin', you ain't losin' *taps forehead*
Yeah considering its localized size, I think we'd have to go with the most recent movement which is the big green candle. One candle isn't really a trend though, and it's only oscillated since then. 

So I think this pattern is not a strong indicator of which way to trade, with all this lack of clarity. 
yeah they have to cash out some and most coins eventually end up in the market. Im sure the professionals are pretty savvy to lock in profits during bull runs and hoard during low prices, so it's not like they have to sell as soon as they win a reward.

what is it above?
The only reason why bitcoin went 20K is because of mass hysteria, I think we can all agree to that. And now people take 20K as some sort of a normal benchmark. Its not. It was maybe a glimpse to a future where a substantial group of the population uses Bitcoin as a daily tool. Now, setting the bubble aside for a moment, how close are we to that, really? Why wouldn't it take years? Especially considering the fact that bitcoin still has to overcome the "small" hurdle of actually becoming useful for the larger audience. At the moment, there is zero advantages for an "average" person to use bitcoin over € or $. 
> everything is on much higher level now.

But your target (new ATH) is also much higher now than in 2013.
They don’t want to lose more money, they want to win the lottery. Never underestimate greed while overestimating people thinking they figured if out from last time. Also there are so many who have yet to come in and just need a nudge. 
It's the same as the run up to 20k. Did people hearing about bitcoin for the first time at 12-15k know what they were doing? No, but they could have still had great returns had they been looking for a reversal and not assumed it would rise indefinitely. Not many bears think it will fall and stay down indefinitely
The problem is there a bear whale with a lower level short doof my everyhting in his power to prevent the bulls from pulling over, think he is actually adding to his short here, and propping up the price for leg down 
yeah bottom callers are the new top callers. Sure it's possible bitcoin does what no one expects but when it trends it seems to trend longer than most people expect it to so I'm confused why people keep trying to call the bottom instead of wait until it's obvious
Same could be said of bulls at 20k. A trend will always have a reversal. Not saying its now. But dont consider it going down again something that is bound to happen.
so much latin, you must be a genius
Too many words.Must be short and unhappy with the current price 
I've come to accept recently that I'm just a crypto bull for life ... and that's okay!

I yolo'd at 1k, I'm accumulating at 10k, and I hope, someday, to retire at 100k and start trading.

My destiny is set.
> The question is then, how to know which direction to go ?

I was thinking just catch a movement already in progress and scalp it quickly in the same direction.  The size of the scalp is proportional to the size of the latency.  Rinse and repeat.  I bet it does better than 51%

Yeah there's nothing novel with what I just said, but it's entertaining to think of using latency of a service as one of the mechanisms.
Which indicates to me that anyone who was going to profit on a short position has already done so.
LOL
At this point I'm half expecting a huge green candle.  

Or a red one to complete the bart. Makes me glad to hold the two positions I do. 
The classic MEX overshoot probably makes that a good call. I put mine at 7340, but only because I have a long from 64xx that gives me some insurance/wiggle room. If my short ($7k) was my only position, I'd want them closer. 
I'm looking to set a similar SL.  But i worry that 7250 still might be locking in a wicked loss, at least that's what always seems to happen to me. 
no 
Yes fake out comments about all the shorts people are entering are so helpful also.
Think people would be upset at < $10. But do you honestly think that is a probability?
> I think most the panic sellers are gone by now

You're underestimating the amount of paper millionaires and people with hundreds of thousands dollars worth of BTC who haven't sold yet. Depending on how low the price goes, they would sell at some point to realize gains. 

The price is essentially propped up by long term holders right now- if they decide to cash out, it would be a slow cascading sell-off when people realize they're not going to be able to sell t a better price.

I don't think there have been that many panic sellers since the first $6k. This is just real people cashing out because they think it's going much lower after seeing the awfully bearish charts.

It doesn't have to happen this way, but I don't think panic selling is required for us to go lower
The biggest moves aren't driven by news, but just market dynamics.
he might be right but its simply too early to talk about 9k. Shit hasn't even gotten over 7,2k yet lol. Anyways i closed at 7130 and gonna reshort 7170 again
this is the start of the bullrun™
yeah man, scared out of my short from 11300, my short from 10800, 8.5k, etc etc. Every time I closed to early. Not this time! I mean I will close at a loss if we break 7200 and stay over for a bit haha
Lets see if it can get over 7200 before we start talking about some big numbers
Lol are you actually looking at 5m candles for patterns? Stop. 

And why are you talking about "tristar doji on the 6hr"? The current 6hr candle closing in ~20 min isn't even a doji.
It's still not an abandoned baby. The abandoned baby's whole point is trading opens well below the last close, then that candle is a doji that never reaches the previous candles close, and then the next candle opens above the abandonded baby doji's high.

This never happens in BTC because on long time frames the open and close of candles is never significantly different.
Mid step dump confirme, now a small rise, small dump and the pump in 1 or 2 hours if pattern really is repeating 
Yeaaah clearly with all the 500/1000 BTC buy orders on finex popping up and eating the sellers. Energy is gone alright, let's go dowwwn
I'm totally torn. This is so many signs of an impending breakdown, but the way we've hugged that resistance line ALL DAY with barely a let-up...
at 900 $?


I bet youre getting rekt these days 😁
From 7k to 6.5 was a falling wedge can't post a chart atm.
I think you missed the point of my comment entirely.
5.8 was on Feb 6th, zoom out. 
Okex went down to like 4.6k on futures actually thinking about it. I think I heard they fixed the discrepancy though cause someone threatened suicide. And that was in this dip

Edit: https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/cointelegraph.com/news/okex-resolves-futures-price-slip-impact-as-trader-threatens-suicide/amp

Might just write to gdax and say if they don’t put it back to 20k I’ll end it
I think he's just a major troll who has somehow managed to escape the banhammer. 
That part is true
I think without many of the people who FOMO'd in selling back out, we're not going to see the drastically lower levels people are expecting. 
What if you had never sold any of your coins? In that hypothetical, if we dropped down to $4,000 would you start selling to at least realize some profit? My goal here is to try and understand the mentality of an average early adopter who hasn't sold anything yet.
Cool, so do you have anything to share about their feelings/actions/future plans since they bought?
Thanks man. Will read.

Just got the hospital bill today. This is going to cripple me even worse than the injuries I sustained. Even worse is I won’t be able to qualify for disabilities. I feel so let down by my State and Government. Will fight back and rebuild from square 1 and become even stronger hopefully in a few years.
My point is that it used to be very cheap, easy and convenient for people, and now it isn't. It is clear to me that this has decreased the amount of credit-based fiat flowing into crypto from the average retail investor. 

edit: I should clairify that you can't add new CC payment methods on coinbase
While I agree with you, this is one breakout that I expect to be more explosive than usual if it does indeed break to the upside. 

Like I said, it's risky. And people shouldn't follow me here. 

But I'm opening a long, so I posted about it. 
Anything above $7,300 would be time to call it quits on a short in my opinion. 
I set my short SL to 7350 fwiw. It'll be more loss than i like (CA 6950), but i think setting it less than 7300 is asking for a needless loss.

Almost thinking of bailing out here near break even, but I've missed out on some great positions in the last week doing that... 
eggsactly
And im not saying it is. But for sure is a sign that people are accumulating. 
Yes, you are right. My mistake.
indeed. the "blockchain" doesn't have a timer.
I think the biggest threat of a deathspiral happened when BCH almost flipped. There was a lot of fear then, but it didn't happen. Now, I don't think anyone thinks it will happen.
> That's approximately 84 days of not being able to conduct transactions on the network.

That's not how it works. First of all, there's no magical price where X amount of miners all pull the plug at once; secondly 1 hour block confirmations doesn't mean you can't conduct transactions, merely means they'll be slower and there'd likely be backlog accumulating, but yeah.

It has all the same properties of gold. The only thing it relies on which gold does not is the internet. So if you think a future without the internet is a non negligible probability than it won't be worth as much as gold. However, I think a future without an internet is so unlikely that we can assume it's value is equal to gold.
Most alt coins are worth nothing and will be worth nothing, imo.
You're talking about sentiment analysis. There are also objective ways to define bull/bear. Like I said, it's not black or white. I'll call the market a bear market even when I'm long-term bullish.The community seems to vote on what makes the most sense as far as sentiment. Generically, it's unreliable to depend on sentiment for a clear definition. This sub is extremely unreliable in its capacity to gauge these issues.
 Long and short remind me of positions in the market. I actually initially wrote longer and shorter but changed it in an attempt to avoid confusion. A side note is that higher and lower still work when your units of progression are time independent e.g. tick charts .
Double bottom is the new H&S lmao
absolutely. Looks like it's just a game of patience for the moment. 

Love to see the big green dildo out of nowhere, to quote my bishop, figure it'll just smack into 7200 and reject it but at least it would be an attempt. 

To fall from here back in to the 6700s or 6600s would be disappointing and certainly a bad sign for the near future
If you think humans aren't biased you're in for a rude awakening, but we can try and be fair and put those aside as best we can. 

Just like there were tons of people longing at 20k that were new and inexperienced, there are now alot of people shorting. It's not something i'm making up, when you start seeing twitter posts and facebook posts from normal people talking about opening short positions on bitcoin you know you're adding some seriously unstable kindling to the fire. 
that's exactly my point...
Not really, I'd say more neutral than anything. if you mean it's bullish relatively speaking because people aren't as dramatically bearish then sure. 

but like I said, it did this every time before and we have dumped after the discount disappeared several times. 

People rather wait for confirmation than short a contract already at a discount 
yea I agree. We're in the zone right now for something to go bang, either direction. 

I really wanted to see a bit more conviction earlier on that 7100 run to be honest. It flat-lined very easily and now we are in a bit of a precarious place, short term wise anyway. 
Yeah I've noticed.
Uh...except there are dozens of people arguing both sides of that here. It's not a strawman if I'm not accusing anyone in particular of subscribing to both arguments. It's the general consensus of all the "this is good for bitcoin" people

Also, you just argued it.. So it's not a strawman.. Lol 
People who believe both...? And it seems there were a few people as I got a couple answers 
I'm slowly reconsidering my stance. :) Hodling a bit of btc and walking away for a year would be much easier than this. 
I was just drawing the same triangle.

Bearish descending triangle on the 30, bull flag on the 4hr, bear pennant/flag on the 1D.  gah
Yeah I want to walk away from this too.  But at the same time I don't ;)

Not gonna feel comfortable sleeping on my short from 6950.  SL strategy there is either uncomfortably high and can be a larger loss, or uncomfortably low and locks in a wicked loss.
Right on the money bud. And something people in the crypto space just fail to understand or choose to ignore altogether.

There is no need for these coins (irregardless of how useful the technology is) to have a monetary value.

They only do so because it essentially "funds" the project and then gives the early investors a "share" of the company without holding any stock... like seed funding. 

IMO it's total bullshit and a giant fad these "coin offerings". 

In 2-3 years we'll be looking back laughing at this dumb concept. 

If these entrepreneurs find solid use cases for blockchains, then create a REAL company out of it and make it successful, not this nonsense scammy crap. 
Yeah that short ratio can get higher.  It was over 50% not long ago.  The ratio isn't the only thing to watch, the absolute size of the positions relative to the liquidity on the books is also something to watch.  Both leveraged longs and shorts are very high relative to the order books and daily volumes.  It will take a lot of buying for all those longs to close in profit.  It will take a lot of selling for the shorts to close.
Aye
Breaking down again, only to hit 6,4k was problematic for bears. The daily RSI is showing that they're running out of steam. If that's true, they've overextended themselves.

If it's also true that most bears are traders, then most bears will leave the market until they have framework they can trade against again. THe changing composition of participants could end up being very bullish.
Bitfinex leverage is 3.3x max. So liquidation point would be 1.3* entry. At $6500 that's $8500. So a short squeeze would only occur there. 

Shorts would close before that though, definitely. 
Sort of, in my experience the hidden divs are "stronger" because they suggest a continuation of the trend rather than a reversal, which is generally the path of less resistance. 

The bull div could've technically already played out, too. 

But yes, this is the most convinced I've been in a reversal, but that's not saying a whole lot. 
And I agree with your point now, "recharging" was a bit of strong word, more stabilizing. Now what to see if the Bart formation falls down or not...
[You really think someone would go and tell lies on the internet?!](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/428/075/30a.jpeg)
I agree there are many people that have been burned the past few months and may be posting out of resentment.

But that only explains some of the activity we're currently witnessing in every single mildly pro-Bitcoin thread or comment.

And it's the same when we're going up, it doesn't seem organic at all to have hordes of people mindlessly saying how we're going to the moon non stop.

The thing is, in an unregulated, illiquid market like this, I would be very, very, VERY surprised if no one was manipulating the market AND also manipulating the public sentiment for the same purpose.

So, don't be surprised if you suddenly see a 180 degree change in the sentiment if somebody changes his "strategy" in the next few days/weeks.


It's been like 3 hours, mate. I do agree that a move up looks slightly more likely than a move down at this point, but it's really so slight that it's not worth pursuing until I see a breakout, personally. 
I don't think 70xx is well above.   I'm sitting out for now to see where it decides to go. 
Hi Big_Witch,

Nice to hear, I also really enjoyed this to learn about my emotions and trading  https://www.amazon.com/Hour-Between-Dog-Wolf-Transforms/dp/0143123408 
If the adjust leverage doesn't increase my profit, why would someone ever do it ?
Got stopped out? :/ still holding here

Nope there it goes
not a bad decision at all.
This literally means nothing. We also hadnt bubbled and popped directly prior to April last year.
that April was during a bull run.  What happened in 2016, the previous April when it was a bear run? (a whole lot of nothing)

We were at 3K in June and bled down until the bcash fork in August. I think we hit 1.5K in July.

The good old days... 
The line from 8900, if you consider all the wicks along the way should put the line right above and in that case we should be grinding against it now
Average people won’t drive the price 
> The only reason why bitcoin went 20K is because of mass hysteria, I think we can all agree to that.

Well, obviously "mass hysteria" happens every couple of years. It is just how this market moves. How big will BTC get as/if next cycle comes? 50.000$? 100.000$? 150.000$? I don't know when it will jump up. In last couple of years there are like 10 days a year where all growth action happened. I'm not interested into shorting this thing now and miss one of those days.

> Especially considering the fact that bitcoin still has to overcome the "small" hurdle of actually becoming useful for the larger audience. At the moment, there is zero advantages for an "average" person to use bitcoin over € or $.

There is much advantages to use BTC over € or $. FIAT currency is straight out scam. Why would there be an entity that can devalue your money at will? What is benefit of that and why do you want to give that power to anyone? Do you like how your money lose value as time go by?

Not to mention that there are shitty governments that basically pushing its people so hard with taxes that you can't live as a normal human being. In those countries (which are 80% of the world now days) people are using stuff like bitcoin. Imagine if there is no stock market where you can invest. There is 20% tax on buying gold. And your national currency loses money in rapid pace. 
Why should they come in? Why should institutional investors get into Bitcoin? Why should countries adopt Bitcoin over fiat? 

What value proposition does Bitcoin UNIQUELY offer that should get people interested in it beyond a get rich quick play. 
To be fair at that time I knew exactly what I was doing. There was a clear trend up all the way from February. 
You have a valid point, for sure, but to play devil's advocate (my favorite)...by the time it's "obvious" price will have gone up 20-100% and greatly reduced the profit multiplier on potential longs. Just saying. Long entries here are risky as hell, but the folks saying "wait until double bottom confirmed at $12k" etc. are also silly.
I am a learned bear 
I'm short from about 10k and I'm sweating boy,  I can't handle my breakeven being only 45% above the current price 😥
All the best 
Actually now it's best time to start trading. If you learn how to trade chop then you'll have huge gains when run starts.
There is a contributor here who does something similar, surprised he hasn't asked you to remove this comment yet. (I've seen him ask others to delete similar comments, not going to call him out)
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

Neither would surprise me. Just an odd market lately. I think it's weird that 2K BTC were limit bought on Kraken (of all places) at $6,500 yesterday and 51% expect them they're being trickle sold back out.

I hear talk of an 8k BTC spoof wall being flashed around on Bitfinex as well. That's a lot of corn on an exchange by one person.

Lower local low, and a lower local high, but relatively sustained buy pressure feels like there's a lot of trickle unwinding long positions.
Yeah 7280 should be safer, at that point we would probably be clear for liftoff higher
Thanks 
No not really but what I mean is that people will feel despair at 50% from ATH all the way down to much further below
Plenty of long term holders with cash on the sidelines though.
o, 5m candles are perfectly useful for flags, wedges and pennants. 
Ýea, i dont see it and honetly don't trust it. Im just saying that in this market you must have more tolerance for what a doji means. Anyway, such a formation doesnt make sense and its easier to be understood as a bear flag breaking up. 
I've seen this pattern alot of times when looking for alt-coins to trade, usually these coins would end up getting pumped alot. So it could be whales buying up a bunch of coins and whenever it goes down a bit, they add more to their stack in preparation of a big pump. 
I feel that the weirdest thing is 6900 holding two 100$ dumps. 
Now a bear flag is being created, so this might actually go down this time.
On the other hand we can't seem to break 6900.

I'm getting the feeling to just close my short here at BE.  I've done that twice recently in similar situations and both times I ended up reshorting with a worse entry.

So of course this will be the time I wished I closed...


Yes, just like I was "getting rekt" when I was mocking the hysterical moonkids since like $12k (on another account, because I tend to get banned for my shitposting). Keep dreaming you manchild. It'll keep going down forever and you'll get rich off your genius totally-not-bottom short. Certainly.
I don't think so cause you clearly stated that sub 1k isn't off the table? 
So you’re saying most people who invested late last year only care about moon or zero and wouldn’t sell if it started looking like there was no chance of recovery? I kind of doubt it. I don’t know that everyone who invested has the same kind of financial luxury as your sample seems to have. That said, I agree that all the speculation about ATH buyers is overplayed and not really warranted.
I think 5k is in the realm of possibility for how this is unfolding. It almost seems like a car accident people want to see for morbid perversity, but I would imagine that would be enough and the buying pressure would be immense. If it goes under 5k then I don't see why 4k, 3k, or even 2k is not possible and I am long-term bull. It sucks but we have to deal with reality and act accordingly. 
Having held through previous crashes and capitulations I suspect I still probably wouldn’t sell in the hope that it could moon again. 
Generally speaking, HODLing what they have left. There are some trading now. The number of people attending meet ups has dwindled greatly since December so there’s no chance to converse with a larger group. But that in itself speaks to the feeling. Majority of the group members had watched through 2017 then bought in Q4. 

negligible impact imo.
Respect you for posting your trades and always enjoy knowing them even when I am going the other way as I am right now. At the least posting our thought processes makes one consider the opposing take
For sure, just giving another option. You do you. 


bro wtf..... im this close to just following ur trades
Makes sense. Mex has trained me to add $25-$50 for overshooting wicks, but if we crack $7300, it probably won't turn around there after spending all this time failing to crack $7200.
I've amassed enough fees on this sucker I'd need it to dip under 6900 to be worth bailing on it now. I try not to be blindly biased (bearish is my lean), but I just don't see a catalyst for this market to actually reverse here. Bounces are obvious and expected, but after 3 days of lower lows and lower highs, are we really bouncing to 7500+? 

I've been much more concerned about my $6400 long than my $7K short, but BTC does love to troll.
So, I used to be a miner years ago. We use automated monitoring software for our miners which include features like calculating the profitability of mining coins and automatically switching our miners to the most profitable one. Even though I don't mine anymore, I have no doubt that if the profitability drops below a certain threshold there will be many farms that will automatically switch coins at the drop of a dime.
That is an excellent question, and I have to think about that and get back to you if I can figure it out on my own.
> It has all the same properties of gold.

Totally. Gold is created at an arbitrary limit by computer code which can be cloned endlessly to produce identical versions of gold.
Why did you pick gold rather than any other precious metal?  

Also, it obviously does not have the physical properties of gold though.
It has all the same properties of gold except being a physical thing that people desire.
I wish. But not going to happen. If after massive sell of of alts and 80-90% drop since ATH, btc dominance is at 45%. 
What the hell else is there in crypto to analyze other than sentiment? 
yep :/

atleast a 7.2 would set up nicely for a pump from 6k, a lower high here would  only set the cat amongst the pigeons. 

but damn that 7.2 and 7.5 and 7.7 have become frikkin rocks after the support they provided  earlier on our plummet down. 
BTC was hitting mainstream FOMO levels around $8k in 2017. We went up to $20k shortly after. If our aunts are now shorting Bitcoin because of "teh free moneyz" it could mean the bottom is near, but knowing how Bitcoin behaves that could be a swift $3k in the coming weeks as well.
Illuminate us, please.

I also don't understand how anybody can know at this point if something like BTC is overvalued or undervalued at this point.
[deleted]
Short bellow 6950 and long above 7050 should work fine. The problem is that a fake out should happen if this is to reverse to a dump so limit buy is a bit dangerous. Limit sell should be safer as there hasn't been fake outs before the pumps.
yeah I can't find your old comment, not sure what's up, hope you're doing well
and riding that wedge resistance....not much support on the downside until 6.4-5...on the upside it should see more between 7.1-7.2....I'd be more tempted to take out some of my short for break even if it weren't for the above. maybe i'm overestimating that 7.1-2 horizontal support.

Above that it's a lot of air between 7.2 and 7.8 from what I can tell. probably why some bullwhales are staging this as a battleground
Yeah, not easy to set SL there. The problem is that this can keep up a few more hours now that it broke 7000 again.... 
The idea is if the coin/token gains adoption companies/people will need it to utilize it. They have to get it somehow, ie through buying it. So then it has a monetary value.

Of course, its entirely dependent on actual use so super speculative and risky now (as is Bitcoin, just to a lesser degree).
Imo some of that monetized token value business model is needed to incentivize development of decentralized projects without traditional fees or ads. Nobody likes service fees or ads. Use increases value. 

Develop a decentralized project without a centralized revenue collection, it's also much harder to sue or prosecute you. 

Binance is already making it work in a hybrid model. 

The utility token business model is actually an interesting one and might be here to stay even if most current implementations of it do not.  
> Both leveraged longs and shorts are very high 

That's the thing I saw happening overall. Everyone got out of the market for a bit, participation generally was down and uncertainty really high. Then everyone started to see patterns they felt confident in and take positions again, a lot of positions. Guess most people had some ideas on entries, took em and stuck with em.
Aye, tanks for t correction, me ol mucker.
Ok, cool. Thanks for the info :)
Bart with a flock of seagulls haircut
Really? you believe someone is pulling all these strings as opposed to people simply just developing strong opinions and speculations on bitcoin? 

The truth is that only the most vocal and committed of people will continue to post contrarian sentiment when the price moves against them. All of the moderates will upvote the normally contrarian comments because their new sentiment will mirror the "shills". This could seem manufactured because it's so unified but I personally think it's more just that people are extremely emotional and shortsighted and change their views on any sort of significant price movement. 
I'll definitely have to give it a read. Maybe once I've finshed my current book and "Trading in the Zone". 
oh yeah I personally do not understand why people do that. 
Moved my stop down... 2 times already... Last try is 6869. My pattern dream was crushed so i have no idea what to expect. Don't feel safe shorting either...
[deleted]
Oh gotcha, I think overanalyzing whether it's slightly above the exact draw of the line can be misleading since they're more like zones/regions, I tend to think it's "at" resistance in either case however it's drawn. But we do have the same line
Come on man. You seem smart, you know there’s so much literature out there for both sides, no need to be didactic. 
Just as keeping most of your capital in fiat is the wise thing to do know
But if it's going to new ATH then who cares? an extra 25-50% on a journey to $20k+ won't make a huge difference

I just think we'll see people continue to call the bottom all the way down 

I don't think it's silly at all to wait until $12k to say it was the bottom. 2014 has set the precedent that a bear market can be preceded by a massive double top like that 
Yea sure and I'm short from 19k
I'm actually not allowed to trade BTC. Gotta leave it at that ...
I've seen those conversations actually, after they've been deleted.  My curiosity is finally satisfied!!!
Oh look, the aforementioned green candle.
I was thinking that two, but on second thought I don't trust flags/pennants where the pole isn't even 2x the range of the rest of the formation.
> if it started looking like there was no chance of recovery

Not sure what you mean by that. The only way that would be true would be if some fundamental flaw was discovered in the Bitcoin protocol which rendered it worthless. Otherwise there is always a chance of making a new ATH. Also the idea that we reached the all time high ever in 2017 and the price will never surpass that at any time in the future seems pretty far fetched to me.
I'm saying that the casual retail investors I know personally who are in the red haven't sold, and claim to have no plans to sell any time soon.
Anything is possible, but I personally wouldn't bet on $2K btc.
But who is selling ? Presumably all the weak hands have already panic sold by now so if the price goes lower then supply will reduce even further while demand will increase. Eventually it will only be the bears dumping and they will find bigger whales gobbling up their coins.

Thanks. As I mentioned before, there are people here who are convinced that a drop down to the ~$3,000/$4,000 level will bring out early adopters who have never sold before, introducing a new supply variable into the equation. I personally tend to think that the overwhelming majority of early adopters who have never sold before will not sell there. 
I'm pissed that this whole thread isn't higher. This is the exact kind of convo I come on here for. No matter how stupid we thinking of each others trades, there's some decent questioning and reasoning of why do that vs this in the chain of responses here. Whereas others lately have just been IM GOING SHORT OR LONG with no reason why or some triangle lines that must mean it's a crystal ball
Agreed about the lower highs and lows. 

Yeah I've been staring at that long the last couple days thinking of closing it in the green.  But its not  big enough to be worth that, and it's great insurance against my short here if we were to jump to 7500ish after i eat the other SL at 7300ish. There's plenty of time to close out this long if it starts to look like a mistake.

Gonna stick to the plan to ride out that long a bit more. 
Would their profitability calculations all be the same formula with the same thresholds?
What are the physical properties of gold that are valuable?
Yeah. It's digital, which is arguably more (and increasingly so) desirable in today's society.
A ton. There is a ton of data. There's probably more reliable and truthful data in crypto than in any other industry on the planet. CERN is probably the only source of data that's larger in scope. Finding that data and understanding it is up to you, though. It's not clear how to interpret a lot of it yet.
Reading sentiment I see less and less bulls providing optimistic scenarios the past week. The most common bullish sentiment I see is "you don't *know* that wasn't the bottom"
The difficulty in getting the average pleb to short is still quite high. They only know how to buy and sell. I think the shorts will come from more sophisticated traders. 
For sure, no way to say where the true bottom is. I doubt a number like 3k, too large a % drop from where we are now, but anything's possible.

Edit: I will say however that if shorts keep growing like this I don't think a drop is in the short term cards. Too tempting to squeeze these people out of their money.
That's exactly what sloppy is saying. He's saying just going down 2/3 doesn't mean it isn't overvalued. It doesn't mean it's undervalued either.
That's exactly my point. He's saying 2/3 of ATH is undervalued. I'm saying no, it can go much lower because the market as a whole has no idea if it's overvalued or undervalued.

I never actually said it's overvalued. although I personally believe it is, the market decides its value, not me 

My usage of several negatives probably made that confusing so sorry for that but yeah, I just meant to say that really, it could either be under or overvalued at this point. 
See when you put it that way I really can't not see it as overvalued. It's just ridiculous. What does 1 bitcoin do for me right now except for allow me to gamble on bitmex? Nothing, really. 

Sure, it could be worth $100k in the future but...it also couldn't. 

edit: okay this comment is a little shortsighted. I remain skeptical but will attempt to temper my bearishness and personal opinions that arise out of ignorance.
same for me, i'm looking for 6950 to break with conviction and i'll be shorting. 7050 is also a good shout, I just really don't know if we have the legs to get up to the 7200 area let alone break it. 

From strictly a trading stand point the short here is easier to take. As much as I want the 7200 to break I honestly can't see it. Hopefully i'll be wrong though.
Yeah this is a tough one.  Really not going to be able to set a good SL here for sleeping.  Either too low and it gets wicked/hunted, or high enough to gaurantee we are in a breakout but I take a larger loss than I am comfortable with.

Logic says to bail out now near BE...

But assuming 7.2 holds, or I can be awake then to see if I wanna bail out, there's good RR toward 6.5.
I'm scaling out a bit here close to my entry, to get to the point that I don't mind eating the SL.
I think the question that matters is, do you really believe nobody is at least trying to pull the strings?
You made it
Oh okay so it happened in 2017 so it's gotta happen again in 2018. Of course, I forgot that  God came down and said 2017 is to be repeated for all eternity. BTC = 1 Billion 2021 confirmed.
Sorry dude, on this sub, you're not allowed to point out that buying $5000 of BTC at $1K and selling at $2K is better than buying $5000 of BTC at $17K and selling at $19K.
Its a mental thing, if we draw it above we will be biased to short, if its bellow we tend to long. I put some weight on those lines to decide whether to set tight stops or to allow it to breath some more...
I'm very skeptical at this time and I believe it's a mostly objective skepticism. My cold storage is vastly greater than my short position margin so it is not highly influenced by it. My questions were sincere even if asked in an obnoxious manner. 
Classic method acting. Can't wait for him to be recast in a bullish role.
Yeah, you're not wrong at all...it comes down to risk tolerance. More risk, more profits; more certainty, less profits.

On one hand, nobody should complain about buying in at $500 vs. $250 during the last bear market. On the other hand, that's the difference between $100k in profits and $200k in profits, which is also hard to ignore.
You can check my comment history buddy. I post all my trades, winners and losers. 

Or you can continue deluding yourself into blaming the entire downtrend on duh manipulators n sheet cuh ery1 i no is buyn naught sureting or salon. 


Lol. A lot of traders here shorted from 11, taking profits along the way and shorted more.
Let me know next time, ty
And of course that it was pumped again... 

Everyone was expecting that no? /s
That would be a disaster. I think 5.5k is the worst it can get if it gets there at all. We could see a huge bounce off of 6.2k if it goes that low  which also might not happen.
Yeah. I don’t see what’s so special about that price level. If early adopters didn’t sell on the way down at 15, 10 or 7,5K I don’t see why they would suddenly change sentiment at 4K. 
Plans are good. When I set up my current positions, the anticipation was a break below $6K, and my short is weighted accordingly. My long is designed to grow in weight down to 5600, at which point I'd cut the loss and ride the short, potentially scaling in a new long. I'd have to update my math on that. Sunday's dip set off another trigger for my long down at 6200, but I also added to my short over 7100 yesterday (that's pretty wild in and of itself). 
It's lustrous properties are found to be very desirable to women, rappers, and professional athletes around the world.

It also is used quite a bit in electronics for its conductive and corrosion resistant properties.
Primarily as an alloy in jewelry, but apart from "value" it's useful in a number of applications: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold#Other_applications
Try giving your wife or husband a bitcoin engagement ring and get back to me about this. 
naah,

its the short squeeze from hell thats gonna take us to 20k in a coupl of days 
Ok well, that's not what I understood from the comment but fair enough.
Ok, fair enough.
What does a kilo of gold do for you? 
dont get this comment sloppy. what does nasdaq index fund do? what does most of the index in stock market do? even furthur what does a gold bling on someones neck do? 
1 bitcoin allows you to participate in the world's first global, instant, permissionless, value exchange system. People argue that other coins can do this better (I'm actually a bit of a fan of BCH) but the fact of the matter is what gives Bitcoin it's value is it's enormous hashing power. This gives it it's security and is why it's not really possible for some alt coin to be the "facebook" to bitcoin's "myspace" (also why anyone who says "blockchain is important but i don't see the value of bitcoin" 
 has zero understanding of what's really going on here) The strength of bitcoin is in it's mining power and first mover advantage. No government or single entity can possibly amass enough mining power to attack the Bitcoin network. I'm not sure any other coin can offer this security.  

I recognize that Bitcoin works just as well at $1 as it does at $1M. I also am keenly aware that there are a million ways Bitcoin could fail and go to 0. However, the longer Bitcoin survives the more powerful it becomes. As more and more people recognize the power of a financial instrument outside the control of governments, or any single entity, the value people are willing to place on participating in this system will only grow. Particularly a system that works best when everyone involved is greedy. 

We might visit 3k, we might visit 1k. Some people say it will fail if mining becomes unprofitable. I disagree. I've been running miners at a short term loss for some time now due to high power costs. I do this because I believe in Bitcoin, because I mine for the future, and because Bitcoin has made me such a huge return since 2013 that it's impossible for me to lose. Mining power will not shrink in the face of un-profitability, it will just diversify into the hands of those with longer time frames. 

We are clearly in a down trend. Anyone trying to trade who won't recognize that will lose money. However bears who claim the decline is because the value can not be justified are just as blind as the bulls who can't understand how it's under 10k. All markets have cycles.  I've personally held Bitcoin through many "bubbles" and will likely hold through many more. What we are attempting to do is replace long-standing, entrenched monetary systems, this will be slow and messy. 

What we have here is something that is worth 0 and infinite at the same time. It either fails and is worth 0 or it succeeds in creating a secure, permisionless, near instant, semi-anonymous world wide currency system and is worth more than anyone can imagine. 

Place your bets. 

Wrong!  It can also be used to buy various bitcoin forks.  Which can be used to... gamble.
yeah the stops are tough. I've decided scaling down my short and will trade more on a breakout below 6880 now that we have that as a triangle floor. keeping some in position though
I do, but I believe that there are so many of them that it in effect "cancels out." 

Lots of people have a huge financial incentive to crash bitcoin, lots of people have a huge financial incentive to pump it. 

I have heard (and thought) many times that the market is manipulated, but in the long run, most of it seems to mirror natural, organic sentiment to me. Nothing so far has been particularly unprecedented or miraculous in the grand scheme of human behavior. $20k was ridiculous but in terms of bubbles it's nowhere near impossible especially in such an illiquid market. Same with the crash
Still pretty iffy... Looks like a bear flag pause before going down. Have bellow zero confidence on this, hoping for a small rise to close with a smaller loss, unless it rises with confidence.
Stops moved to 6940, if i pull this off is thanks to your strategy to set stop loss bellow the previous flag value. 
If i don't make it i'll be stopped around my initial stop value so i won't lose anything more than my previous plan.
You're right, he came down and said it WOULDN'T happen instead.
It's also the difference between losing half of your investment in the case that it never turns around. People seem to think that another massive bull run is guaranteed, which i do not understand 
You told we would go to 6k ? Well I guess you were wrong 
I agree 100%, thanks.
Yeah that's an uncanny spread on those two positions.  
If those were the only two factors driving demand, gold would be much cheaper.
What I said wasn't meant as a blanket statement. It's more valuable where it makes sense and offers efficiency.

A ring's _entire purpose_ is as a physical symbol, so of course it doesn't apply there.
oh forgot about that one
Because a lot of people in this sub are delusional and get very defensive when their speculative investment gets challenged.
Not much, which is why I don't own any. 😅

I wrote a longer answer to this, but essentially gold has a proven historical function as a physical store of value. Viewed from afar it seems a bit strange we value shiny metal so much but humans are going to be irrational creatures. Perhaps this could be an argument for valuing bitcoin as well. I retract most of my statement. 
Gold and other precious metals are actually pretty important in building consumer electronics. In fact there is a small amount of gold in the device you are using currently to post on reddit
an index fund is very different from bitcoin in that it represents an aggregate of companies that provide products and services that have definitive value.

Top kek. Trying to reply to his question by just asking counter questions that are completely unrelated. The defensive nature of this sub is astonishing. 
While I agree with you on the gold, stocks are  shares of actual companies and their profits (or loses) are what drive the stocks price (and index funds are just a large group of stocks). Crypto is still valued on pure speculation at the moment 
Okay, I admit my comment was a bit shortsighted. 

But a nasdaq index fund is *very* different from bitcoin. An index fund itself is an aggregate of the values of all or those companies that produce value through actual, tangible products and services. It's very different. Right?

And gold has almost 3,000 years of usage as a currency. it has an established function of being a store of value that's lasted several thousands of years. its value comes from not only its perceived value as a hedge against fiat, but also its shiny, valuable physical properties. 

There is no easy way to get humans to agree on valuing something- the simplest way to achieve consensus on this is to make something shiny, rare, and durable. This initially gave gold its value and established it as currency since 700 BC. This alone gives gold a psychological value bitcoin will never be able to achieve- bitcoin doesn't exist in the physical realm. 

This kind of consensus among humans is rare and will possibly never happen again. That's why I'm skeptical of bitcoin becoming valuable in the same way gold is. 
I'm scaling down too.
i would move that stop to 7010 to lock in profit
*woosh*
They might be wrong, but it's not hard to understand (in my view): it's a mixture of faith in market cycles, plus faith in the underlying technology and value proposition. But you have a good point, as usual.
!remindme 1 week u/VanteyX says my 6k call was wrong because we bounced to 7.4 and he thinks moon is imminent. 
They are not, but also not to be discounted.  I'm omitting the obvious use of investment and store of value as you are aware of them.
I just think people need to take out all of the industrial and material uses of gold before trying to compare the storage value of gold vs. bitcoin.

Also, your digital argument is debatable because a lot of the gold nuts like it because it can't be hacked or stolen or manipulated in the same way fiat / stocks / bonds etc. can. 
[deleted]
True. But its also true that this use does very little to rise the price. In fact, with all those novel minning procedures, and even asteroid minning i would not feel confortable holding precious metals as a store of value. Would just stick with goverment bonds.  
wth dude. its jsut. question to understand  different perpectives.
im talking about index funds not the actual stocks
ok although different, as of now i kinda see btc as an index to ceypto market as well. crypto market is gauged by bitcoin in other word if btc goes down u will know the market is down as well the sae way if nsdaq is down u know the tech company stocks are down as well. 

regarding gold yes it is ancient with respect to bitcoin and yes it has proven to be a  stable value storage but still what has decided its value? why is silver fluctuates more? why auminium with 1000 of uses hasnt become a storage for value? it is way lighter and moldable and durable than gold. my point is i dont get the argument that btc has no use and hence it is over valued. i think btc is too new for anyone to decide its the absolute value storage or declare it useless bc u cant use it. again im not saying btc is gold but am arguing u cant claim  btc will be next google glass either
Fees are about 0.4%, need about 7030 to breakeven. Price is ranging between 7050 and 7000 so i will be stopped if i move it above 7000.
Will try close it on the next wave up (if there is another one, looking bad now...) 
Got greedy again...
I owe you a beer :)
Stayed in the long once more after Chewy entered a long also.
SL @7269 to lock profits. 
You fucking serious? It's a boolean proposition: BTC won't hit a new ATH in 2018 or it will. 

SUPPORTING NO: We are down 70% from ATH so a new ATH in 2018 is unlikely.

SUPPORTING YES: We are more than 3x the price we were this time in 2017, so a new ATH is possible even with a slower percentage growth in 2017. (Even just 3x from current price = new ATH vs nearly 10x last year)

What proclamation did you receive that BTC will NOT exceed USD$20,000 in 2018?

NOTE: Saying you have no God-wisdom that BTC will not hit an ATH in 2018 is not the same as saying therefore it definitely will.
When did I say moon is imminent? I said we would go up from 6.9 , you said
we would drop 100% below 6

I agree. Gold's value doesn't come just from its material uses, otherwise it would be much cheaper. On the store of value front, if we assume that Bitcoin is secure, which it must be to compete, then it wins by virtue of its transferability.
My comment goes both ways. Bears will rationalize their shorts and perma bulls will do anything to rationalize their longs.
What do you think an index fund is? It's just a large collection of stocks all grouped together. 
nice, I have a lower leveraged one from 7057 I still hold to.  that 7250 range seems like a good stop loss area yes. either down there or a try for 7500 today 
My entire point is saying it will or it won't based on the fact that it did last year like he was doing is asinine. In fact saying it will or it won't hit an ATH in 2018 is asinine no matter what, nothing is for sure. My post was sarcastic lmao. Hence *woosh*.

Dude. Calm yourself.
It's fighting to stay in that ascending wedge. Let's see how it plays. If it goes to 7500 might open a hedge short with tight stop limits just in case... 
This seems to want to repeat yesterdays up and down. Got stopped @7315 for a nice profit. 
Re-entry if 7200 holds or 7500 breaks. Might scalp a short here if 7280 breaks down.
No I think you might have been wooshed on this one. This whole sub-thread started with a joke about $12K by April and a bunch of you got your panties in a twist.

When challenged, /u/secret_gilder just pointed out that going from $7K to $12K maybe not by end of April but within a couple of months isn't *impossible*, because last year we tripled the price in a short period.

You've interpreted it as a price prediction. It's not, it's just a note that the price CAN triple in a matter of weeks, because it has before. Can. Not will.

> Dude. Calm yourself.

Wat?
No, he said 12k by end of April is his prediction because it went from 1 to 2k over 3 months last year. He wasn't being sarcastic or joking, he's just a permabull.

The point is that just because it CAN happen doesn't mean it's likely to.
But you can't just mock someone for making a prediction you think is unlikely. You can't just say "pfft permabull" and sarcastically joke that they think they have a message from God.

You have to counter with analysis. 

Why isn't the price likely to recover to $12K by some point in May?

Are you equally sarcastic about people calling for a drop to $3000 as many are? Why is that likely or not likely?

Or if your main point is we can't know what the price will be two months from now... then why are you even posting here? What's the point of coming into a trading sub and saying "you can't predict the price"?

Many people DO predict the price, with enough accuracy to allow them  to make lots of money.
