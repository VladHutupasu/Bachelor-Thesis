Super-long, disorganized thoughts albeit not warranting its own post

*****  
&nbsp; 


To make a kind of parable out of what I’m trying to express I liken it to- if at the dawn of time, mankind journeyed through the biblical deserts and stumbled upon a large body of water.  

Like discovering some vast freshwater lake, but they hadn’t invented containers or any way to transport it yet. That will be way in the future. 

&nbsp; 

Machines and mills and water wheels all lie further down the road. Nuclear power plants, yachts, and bottled water on grocery store shelves still further.  

I think certain members of this imaginary tribe would have recognized the gravitas of instantaneous access to water, without necessarily knowing what to do with it upon its discovery.  

&nbsp; 

*****  

I’ve got some remarks about the opposing forces in the market right now.  

#*The Non-believers*    

I can see why some people are bearish:  
There’s so much hype and bullshit. 

Really, who the fuck needs a blockchain –I don’t? 

SQL databases have long ago conquered the demands for scaling and atomicity that the majority of ridiculous alt coin projects are claiming to be hard at work solving. 

Now we have the decentralization craze. Does something like Ripple even need to be decentralized?  I don’t think so. Just because Bitcoin is “a decentralized, peer-to-peer currency” doesn’t mean we need a decentralized music sharing platform. Or a clunky, hard-to-use decentralized exchange that nobody asked for or needed.  

So right now there’s a ton of hype and not much substance. I’m not focused on that, because it won’t affect anything in the long run. Just like how people buying ~~EOS~~ pets.com didn’t stop the Internet from evolving. 

&nbsp; 

Now another common sentiment I hear often - *’there’s not enough blood in the streets’* or my favourite *’there’s still toooo much greed in the market’* sound like people traumatized from the recent stomach churning plunge. 

Thing is, it’s *a market* → Greed is a permanent fixture. 

There is nearly always *somebody’s* blood in the streets. Either it’s your own or the one who traded against you. 
They will be times for both.  

&nbsp; 

*****  

#*Why are people so bullish? Is this a cargo cult?!*  


Here’s a fact: there’s an entire subset of the global economy that spends innumerable man hours stressing about where to allocate significant amounts of capital for both diversification and the seeking of returns. 
In 2014 crypto was only on the radar of the institutional investors who make it their business to always be on the bleeding edge of emerging markets or technological developments.  

&nbsp; 

It’s gradually getting to be on everyone’s radar. The rise to 20k was a wake up call that put crypto on the front page of newspapers and for a hot minute - it was on the center of the world’s stage.   

&nbsp; 

The institutions and hedge funds saw Bitcoin and Ethereum and several others make a meteoric climb to the stratosphere, come plummeting back to Earth, and at the end of the day still be up 1000% over last year. That’s next level returns right there. If you think the major financiers out there aren’t paying attention now, idk think again. 

&nbsp; 

*****   

#*Who is buying right now?*  

[Just to give you an illustration of how these people view this market](https://i.imgur.com/kmCQ6mG_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium)  
I’ll relate an anecdote.  

So back in December a fairly big investor (equities) was asking me where to buy BTC for the first time. I referred them to GDAX. It didn’t work because Coinbase had gotten swamped and didn’t have their act together. Their verification system was offline for days smh. 

&nbsp; 

Anyway the market crashed and I supposed they moved on, thankful not to be stuck holding any bags. So February 6 rolls around and the market tanked. The mood around here was doom and gloom, you all remember. Anyway, so I take a call from them the next day and we’re talking and they brought up Bitcoin again. I was surprised. They asked what the current price was and I told them. They replied rhetorically: **”So, now would be a good time to buy then wouldn’t it?”**  

They didn’t see the end of the world, don’t know or care wtf a Tether is, or whether or not China is going to ban Bitcoin a 6th time.  They saw it as an opportunity to buy something that *can* go to 20k (or higher) for half the price[^(**1**)](http://reddit.com)  

&nbsp; 

*****  

#*But why is there no VOLUME?*  

From this cloistered perch upon built atop a little section of Reddit real estate, the market may seem somewhat small and even knowable, but it’s a misleading view.
In my view, the market’s larger han any one person can comprehend. 
But right now it’s not being driven by day traders spending countless hours on a weekend attempting to make sense of random market noise. 

&nbsp; 

The fact that the price is rising while exchange volume remains unreflective of what we’ve seen in the past simply indicates that the makeup of the market is changing. I posted about how this would play out a few months ago.  
Despite the claims of “wash trading” and “manipulation” by noobs who think that having a million dollars makes the market easier to trade (it doesn’t, you simply have a new, much larger set of problems to overcome) —the paucity of current daily turnover indicates that the current momentum is being driven by larger players.  

&nbsp; 

Trades taking place OTC are not explicit in exchange volume reports. If they’re present at all it’s simply because the OTC desk used the exchange to acquire/sell the coins. They’ll do this over time so as not to move the price too much. If the coins were acquired or dispatched in a different manner then there will be minimal overt effects. 
Also note that these people don’t trade 24/7. Some of them may make 1 trade a month/quarter.  
They’re positioning themselves. Pay attention. Volume is NOT the same as turnover. 
Turnover will come later when people are checking their Coinbase app every 3 minutes.  

&nbsp; 

*****  

###*Footnotes*  

[^(**1**)](http://reddit.com) **Ah but OP’s Mom - that’s extrapolation is it not?** After all, past performance is not indicative of future yada yada - true. 
It is indeed the case that one cannot determine a future probability distribution simply based on the distribution function of past returns (or see [here](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/extrapolating.png) for the easy-to-grasp, Internet meme version of same). But therein lies the catch-22 of investing: that there is actually not much else to go on lol.  

&nbsp; 

You see, it doesn’t matter if you harvest terabytes of market and sentiment data and run it through abstruse machine learning algorithms or employ the most advanced autoregressive models smart minds have brought to bear on the problem. Ultimately, no amount of computation short of *Laplace’s Demon*[^(**2**)](http://reddit.com) can pierce the veil that separates the known past from the unknowable future. 

&nbsp; 

Thus it doesn’t matter if we’re talking about traders who are attempting to divinate directional price trends by utilizing Technical Analysis, investing in things based on their opinions on trajectories or fundamentals, or employing sophisticated mathematical models for doing statistical arbitrage, in a philosophical sense it all amounts to the same thing: placing bets on the future using *information*, knowledge, and experience to hopefully skew the odds in your favour.  

[^(**2**)](http://reddit.com) footnote to a footnote: Laplace’s Demon is the name of one of my ATS’s.  
Laplace obviously stole the name from me.  

&nbsp; 

*****  

#*Where’s all of this going?*  

I think this will come to one of two ends: 
 
It’s possible people will look back on this  period of time and think

‘WTF were these people thinking.. Oh wait, this was the same society that [dressed like this](https://imgur.com/G7AVW0V) a mere 3 decades prior; and, more recently, thought that *Farmville 2* was a good way to spend their free time. Figures.’  
However what I think is more likely is that people will look back on the present time and see investing in these “crypto-not-quite-currency” things **as being the biggest no-brainer ever.**  

&nbsp; 

Sometimes I think about all of those people in the Midwestern United States back in the 19th century, who had millions of gallons of oil beneath their feet in their backyards. Land that they sold for pittance. They made a suboptimal choice and their descendants are not billionaires today.  

&nbsp; 

Just as a hypothetical: if you could peer into the future and discovered that one decade from now Bitcoin was by then one of the world’s staple foreign reserve currencies, would you be surprised? I actually wouldn’t. I mean, I’m not at all saying that it will happen, only that if it did it wouldn’t be the most mind-blowing turn of events ever. 
There’s a consistent path to that outcome that doesn’t depend on a wide deviation from how things are at present.  

&nbsp; 

*****  

#*I’m tired of reading this now*  

Fair enough. Maintain a sense of the bigger picture, the bigger market. One day the digitalization of currency (and contracts) will appear so obvious that it will seem almost quaint. 

&nbsp; 

Even my own, more near-term, somewhat saner version of the McAfee bet [might well prove to have been a lowball estimate](https://www.moonmath.win).  

&nbsp; 

*****  

#*Epilogue*  

View the hype objectively (always) and try to shrewdly assess the magnitude of the paradigm shift we could be at the forefront of —futurology isn’t a science so we can only expect the unexpected. 
Even if right now we are all basically just standing around with dumb facial expressions on, starting at a big lake.. metaphorically speaking.  

&nbsp; 

Be safe everybody, I hope to see you crazy motherfuckers on the plane.
Closed my futures short and very likely closing swaps short soon (9950 will close it and probably close the hedge entirely).

Reasoning:

1. OPs_Mommy's wall of text was a really good read. Thanks for that, man. Particularly the volume part. 
2. First time we tried to get to $10k it took like 6 hours of sitting near resistance. I like my shorting opportunities to be in profit quickly- otherwise it's likely I will have to sit through another 3-4% pump at the least (possibly way more here)
3. I'm starting to think fears of 2014 are part of a [wall of worry](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wallofworry.asp). I don't want to be the idiot that waits to buy way too late. I'm going to stop fighting the trend and trying to get the top. I will be constantly re-evaluating and doing some serious reading. In general though this is all super speculative so I need to be more flexible in my opinions. "Strong opinions weakly held"
4. Shorting a parabolic asset is very stressful.
5. I have PTSD from the BGD. (Sorry to anyone who has PTSD. But I legitimately do get anxiety trying to short on high leverage now). 
[BOOM!!!!](https://twitter.com/BTCVIX/status/992588499693047808)
[Mission Accomplished](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8g5owl/daily_discussion_tuesday_may_01_2018/dy9xigj/).

Closed @$9950 for ~9% profit.

Welcome home, boys. 
Took us over a week to bust 9700 and some here are upset because 10K hasn't fell after 12 hours?
i suspect a strong bounce or a strong dip once we finally clear this 3000 buy wall on okex from the liquidation


https://cryptowat.ch/futures/okcoin/btc/usd/quarterly/15m

still 300k contracts left. each contract is $100 worth of btc

300000*100=30,000,000/10130 = 2961 btc
/u/The_OPs_Mommy 's post seems pretty plausible, but I can't help but feel like all the responses proclaiming it the best post ever are peak bull euphoria. Then again I have been the "this is a sucker's rally" guy since the BGD so what do I know :)
Anecdotical stuff: So my boss talked about Bitcoin for the first time since december. Historically, this has been an indicator for me that the FOMO is kicking in again.

I'm bullish.
Anecdotal: yesterday in separate incidents, two people asked me why I didn't sell in December since bitcoin is "now $6000". I don't know where they got this information, badly written articles on Yahoo probably. But I showed them a chart, how 6k was the bottom of a correction. Both were surprised to see we're creeping up on 10k and echoed the usual "dang I should've bought at 6k". 10k is going to get Yahoo articles written and people's attention. 

The public is a sleeping FOMO dragon. I've been doing my best to accumulate these last few months...
As we hover right below the 200d MA, I was curious to compare the situation to ETH and LTC (I don't hold either of them right now, but I believe a look at correlated markets may often help):

https://www.tradingview.com/x/zTnp4j8K/ (200d MA on the 4h chart)

As you can see, after breaking through and then hovering around the 200d MA for a while, ETH and LTC already decisively bounced upwards from it over the past days.

I believe the "pull factor" of the whole crypto market (looking at the ratios of these coins against BTC) should be taken into account here, in addition to the BTC-specific TA. I see this as further increasing the likelihood of BTC breaking through the 200d MA as well.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/XCL9vOuy/


I'm so fucking scared that the closer we get to 10k, the closer we are to a darth vader wick down
Well...I sure hope this isn't a bull trap... if it is, some people are going to get fucking rekt 

For the record i'm now neutral in terms of BTC's position, neither bull nor bear. I have no goddam clue right now
man futures going retarded

e: wtf bch is pumping like mad lmao this is all retarded
If it was going to shit the bed before 10k, now would be the time.
This 9950 silence is so scary... it's like when it's too silent in the movies.
Wow 400+ market sell. No chill.
I'm so conflicted, on one hand my take profit point for my long is right around here, so if I follow my plan I should sell and sit on hands until something substantial happens.  On the other hand, with the alts pumping I feel like this could be the one^TM and I don't want to take my small profit and leave 10X on the table if we have an aggressive breakout.

Edit:  I sold about 60% here, keeping 40% for yolo and looking for good reentry later, even if it is above breakout.
Here is what I have been watching the last few weeks:

https://imgur.com/1MZ9zpG

We got the bullish TK cross earlier today which should help confirm the move upward.
GDAX fomo seems to be starting up, the discrepancy between finex and GDAX smallest of past few days IIRC. Bullish in my book. 
Thought about opening a short at 10k, because we might need more than just one attempt to crush through. What do you guys think?
I think we have more consolidation to go here. If we were to push up, the top of the daily BB's are at 10.1k. We could push to 10.2 but we'll get rejected and fall back down. So even if I was a bull whale, stalling and consolidating here will make the break out stronger. I can see us in this 9.5-10k range for another day or two.
Seems poised to break up, but not making this an easy call at all.

[Hidden Bull div](https://www.babypips.com/learn/forex/hidden-divergence) on the 4hr? (I love when I get the chance to link babypips)

https://www.tradingview.com/x/Z7no52mr/

Not sure, I am more of a support/resistance trader, and it still looks like a nice **medium term** long entry here:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/7UW6Z6mB/

On a 2 week timeframe it looks like 11.8k is a target.

I was doing a lot of comparions between the old bubble and this one, and spit-balling a target for this break-up here.  

Here is 2013:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/DzaR49CF/

And we're interested in the 2 blue lines. It was 350 --> 680, or about a 90% bump (relative to 350).

Here is now:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/upCGnHnB/

The blue line indicating the same percentage bounce.

Now, I know that so, so, so,..... SO much is different now. It's just something interesting to look at, and I thought I would share. My personal target here is 11.8k, and I am continuing to add to my long (yesterday I added at 9740, admitting it wasn't a fantastic entry from a R/R trade, but I've maintained a low DCA entry due to positions I entered sub 9k, and this is a different sort of trade for me.

thoughts guys?

/u/two_bit_misfit

/u/_chewtoy_ 
Having a hard time reading this one. 

It keeps setting higher highs but there are double and triple tops all over the place, but since they're on shorter time-frames I'm tempted to think that it's just consolidating below the 10k psych resistance and we will soon moon.

I think there would be enough money on the sidelines right now waiting to buy the dip that will prevent it falling, there's a big buy wall at 9800 showing that.

From a whale perspective this would be the perfect time to buy - make a sizeable on market buy to tip it over 10k and you've make a quick and easy return.

Longs are up, shorts are down, RSI is ok-ish so it would be a healthy time to make the cross. Falling back to around 8700 before making another cross would be ideal but I'm pretty impatient.

The risk adverse side of me is telling me to move half my stack out into fiat in case it drops before heading back up, but the greedy side of me is saying I need everything in BTC for the moment we pass 10k...
Is there any thought as to the size of any downside should we fail to break 10k? Keep hearing after 10k we're looking at mid 11s as a target, or thereabouts, but what's the downward target should we fail to break 10 after multiple attempts?


Did anybody just catch that dump on Kraken??

Somebody puked a few hundred coins and dropped it below 9.5.
Too close not to go over 10k.... hundy roll is on the menu
keep getting "insufficient margin" (i.e., they don't have enough to lend) on kraken. So annoying. It just cancels your order whenever it hits. There must be a better way to handle that....
My order has been on GDAX book for 2 hours now and only 5$ away from price..... very sad I feel like I'm the only non robot left on GDAX 
[Hmmm...](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Wm5sXnLW/)

Edit: also [this](https://www.tradingview.com/x/s5Apft9f/)
what the hell does BGD stand for? Google says "Black Gangster Disciples" and nothing else....
1k buy wall dropped on $9865 Finex, I'm off out to get a tan.
If the order book on Binance is anything to go by I think we'll pop through on the next attempt. Sell wall at 10k has gone from 200 coins to 23 with three attempts at 10k already.

Edit - 4 attempts. I'm done, back to fiat.
Am I crazy or does it seem like no one is really shorting this: https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BITFINEX:BTCUSDSHORTS

Are these limit sells keeping the cap on $10K just profit taking then?

I'm starting to get a "be fearful when others are greedy" vibe, but maybe that's just me projecting? My short from 9775 got wicked out at a small loss and now I'm sitting in mostly fiat at the moment (after taking profit on my long from 6775).
Closed my long at 9850 ish. The [2H](https://www.tradingview.com/x/4zU2kbjV/) is looking an aweful lot like a distribution trading range, we have bearish divergences building on the 4H and daily, and we're due for some RSI cooling off anyway. I'm staying out for now, will rethink a new entry in the coming days.

I still have some active buy orders in the low 8k's, [per this chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/dYXNkAIY/), but that might very well be a dream by now. We'll see.
Anyone have a good bitfinex order book stat site?

cryptowat.ch has this annoying "span" in percentage that capped so low it won't go more than 100 dollars out and the groups are 10, 50 or 100 and doesn't have any scrolling

If I want to know "what does a 1000 btc dilio at 10k look like" I'd have to guess how its rounding the order book in 50 dollars ranges, or wait till its close enough that 10 dollar ranges are on the page.
Support is around 9700 now. Consolidating here is incredibly bullish. Could go on much longer though. BBands aren't quiet tight enough yet.

Support will eventually break (unsustainable - 200$ rise per day. This is steeper than our 2017 post July log channel.) but still seems fine. 

Meanwhile I am REALLY fighting the urge to short BCH. I am convinced that, that money will flood into BTC soon.

Edit: Not in a position at all though.
**Trading bot spam HERE.** If the entirety of your post is calling on the trading/position bot, post it as a response to this comment. All other such top comment posts will be removed.

Also, don't forget the [Altcoin Daily Thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8h53ku/altcoin_discussion_saturday_may_05_2018/)
Its always trying to touch 200 ma.  RSI close to being exhausted I guess recooling coming soon.
1000+ coin sell wall just got obliterated on finex
10k breached on binance.
I am obviously not versed in leverage, but what is the difference between taking out a low interest loan and buying some btc and taking a leveraged long at higher interest. Surely you can use stops in much the same way and have similar risk, but the rates are cheaper and you can't get squeezed. Of course this assumes you have access to credit and don't want to take on an insanely huge position. 
I feel like I have a better chance of the horse I'm betting on tonight (kentucky) winning than choosing to go long or short here. I did not expect to hover here for this long. 

If bulls were in control I would expect this at 10k+, if bears were in control i thought we'd be cooling off in the mid 9ks. 
$375 premium now on the Bitmex June quarterly.
Bear trap in effect.
Do people not understand how the UP contracts on Mex work? I mean, it took me some time to understand them too but these current prices, .00835, means that you'll break even at 11,700. Do these people really believe it'll go to 11,700 by next week or they just don't understand what they are buying? Too bad you can't short these and only a designated market maker can because I would short these pretty hard right now.
What app has the loudest alarm? We need sleep but don't want the miss 10k. 
I'm calling beartrap. Somebody wants to eat your shorts, man. Could go down to 9500 before the next BGD though. Five percent is the standard drain for a beartrap. I'm gonna try a quick !short 9860 3x 50% for a quick scalp.
Descending triangle broke down that I posted [here ](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8h53jf/comment/dyi287u?st=JGTUG7M4&sh=a369855f) 

Bounced off $9,750 ish like expected 
Looking at my overall favorite trading indicator since 1 year, the moving average(9,26) on 3D, it might turn to a cross to the upside here for the first time since like October 2016. interesting 

https://imgur.com/a/lPBynMv


EDIT: **OK turns out I posted the EMA chart**
I usually use simple moving average (just like it), here is the 3D chart for that https://imgur.com/a/EMtq0Be
Buyers are relentless, whoever is preventing 10k is going to fail. I'm watching binance, market history is filled with buy orders.
I don’t think we will take out 10k from here. Bitcoin notoriously dips a little before a green candle, so I anticipate a drop to 9800 and then boom. Maybe tomorrow.

RSI cooling off, but I still think a retrace is in order for today
I think people will be caught off guard by how big the upward swing will be.  With Goldman Sachs creating a bitcoin/crypto trading desk because it says it has huge demand from clients has to be bullish.  And even if they say they aren't going to be trading physical bitcoin, they would say that anyway just to keep the market low before they take a position.

Coinbase hiring 100's of people is very bullish as well.  The situation in Venezuela is pretty significant too.  The talk of giant OTC demand is probably legitimate because it makes sense.

I've been trading but holding is starting to become +ev because the moves might be too huge.  I wish I knew how many new accounts coinbase was opening.  
Anyone looking at the COT reports (commitments of traders)? It shows the institutional brokers are still in a 2000 BTC nett-short position, and slowly turning.

I was looking at the chart for the past year and it looks like every regular bear div on the 1d has played out for the most part, with each one resulting in a 25-50% retrace. 

It's hard to call a top for this rally (at least for me) so it's just something to keep an eye on at the moment, but *if* this doesn't break past roughly $10,600 we could be looking at another div on the daily. 
Hi I'm new to crypto this week, from the UK. Can I ask what exchange would you reccommend? I have holdings in Coinbase but the conversion seems quite expensive at around 4%? Also do you have any recommendations for new coins? :)
H&S speculation incoming in 5... 4... 3...

Edit to not make another top post:

Sept futures divergence from spot seems about to officially launch into lala land, trying for new local highs.
hey guys. been out of the loop for a few days and now bitmex is calling options upside contracts?

edit: lol and they only allow themselves to be short-sellers. talk about free markets.
Wow, prices on GDAX have been frozen for past 10 mintues
Open a nice short at 9971. SL are super tight at 10100. i see more downside reward. Market sentiment is too bullish for not enough accomplishement.
Still holding my short from 9600. its only like 1% of my portfolio but im starting to think im on the wrong side of the market.

But then i think about how the higher we go up without any sort of pull back the more likely a pull back right? i mean, we've had 5 green weeks. surely we're due a red one, no?

if we do get a red week next week, ill be looking to go long as long as we dont drop below 7k.

if we dont get any red until 11700 then i reckon that will prove that i have no fucking clue what im talking about.

Cheerio.

edit: potential bear div on 1D? https://www.tradingview.com/x/qmv7WPaN/
Still sticking with long target of 10.2, with plans to short above 10.3.

Sorry for a second post, But we seem to be forming a descending triangle on the 15m. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/MltDsaq3/

If it breaks down, looking at a target of $9,750 where we should find support for the time being.

The whole post\-bubble plot in 4 big wedges.

I know the wedges peaked out here and there and are not very nice, but the basic wedge shape is visible for all of them. Just another perspektive to take into account...
Few days back, TRK posted a chart extremely similar to this pointing out a pattern. 

This is my chart, now added with our new hypothetical symmetrical triangle 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/WS9ZEkFk/

If this plays out, it looks like we will see $10,300, then a pull back to consolidate between $10,000-$10,200 before our next leg up to 11k. 

If the pattern repeats, we should see 11k by May 13th-16th. 

I’ll be adding to my long anywhere between $9,620-$9,720 if we get there. 

Edit: Every-time we have shot up, we have broken up out of a BEAR flag, completely invalidating it 
'W' fractal: https://imgur.com/a/tBXHDlh

I don't know how you can trade off it, but I thought it was interesting. It's a true fractal in the sense that the pattern is occurring at different scales within itself, rather than simply repeating at different times.
My short from $8,735 got liquidated in the early hours after reaching L/12.5% at $9,868. Below is a brief summary of my April Closing.

    April Loses: 73%
    April Closing: 126%

Opened May with above position, however, might close it sooner depending upon the circumstances. 

Opportune time to close margin longs.
i think people expecting bitcoin to moon after 10k are mistaken. general public doesn't care anymore about 10k; we've passed it so many times this year. i bet most people who are relatively familiar with btc don't even know it's below 10k.
Hi again, r/BitcoinMarkets! This is the last chance to fill in the quarterly reddit cryptocurrency survey. (yes that means no more seeing this post in the daily every couple of days!) The survey where every 3 months I collect responses from the reddit crypto community to see how the community has changed since the last few surveys.

**If you would like to fill in the survey, you can do that [here.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfhkUsvWO4xAHnXQ1kjOl9tvmubEw_NquQNb3gwCMQN7LJLVA/viewform?usp=sf_link)**

For those of you who haven't seen the results to my previous survey, you can see that [here.] (https://redd.it/848snp)

Thanks for your time!
opened another short. even if it goes higher i expect it to come back here again. Looking at the weekly it is also time for some smaller pullback or sideway story. On an unrelated note: Am i the only one noticing or are more and more services pulling back accepting btc? Latest victim(after steam for me): expedia - no more btc allowed :( (obviously that affects my sentiment)
I closed my long and am currently scaling into a short below $9975.  I'd love to be wrong but feels like we don't quite have the gumption to smash it this time.  Watching how the walls got thrown up last time too has my tail in between my legs.  
Any thoughts on possible next targets?

The two that came to my mind are:

* 10.25 - horizontal resistance? (although the evidence for it is not so prominent on the chart)
* 10.6 - 78.6% Fib retracement of the drop from 11.7 to 6.45 

Do these make sense?

Someone on Binance fat fingered through 10k. Let's see if finex will follow. 
!short XBTUSD - sl 9630
Fuck, not 10k, not tonight.

I'm 50% fiat.
I should just note that no matter what you think of crypto in general, fundamentals haven't actually changed much in the past 4 months. They bottomed in April but they haven't actually gone back up either.

Now this is important because they were lower than they were late last year when the meteoric rise happened in November and December. The price is growing significantly faster than the fundamentals while exchange volume is actually flat to falling.

This indicates more hoarding. While everyone says "but that means the price goes up", that doesn't mean it's a good thing cause paper wealth is meaningless if you can trade it for other assets without drastically altering the price (liquidity).

Everyone keeps screaming "moon moon moon" but we clearly saw in December how almost nobody sold and everyone just screamed about their paper gains but never had any actual cash to show for it a month later on the way down.

Now everyone is right back to the same insane hoarding "advice" (i.e. HODL) that caused a lot of our problems in December. It's mass hysteria and deception trying to drag in new bagholders so you can dump your position onto the next dumb sap that walks in the door.

For all the crap everyone bitches about Wall Street and how they treated people during the financial crisis 10 years ago, you guys are doing the exact same thing as Wall Street did.

I’m adding to my long (originally from 8.8k) here at 9790.

This might not be a completely rational decision (at least it doesn’t feel like it right now). But my plan always was to add to the long when we got a bullish TK cross on the double daily: https://www.tradingview.com/x/a4dURRoS/

The reason why this might work is because the market has really shown true desire and will-power to push through 9.8k. Right now RSI is also sufficient cooled off for another leg up.

Edit: Tight stops below 9.5k.

still holding my long from 9040 mentioned 
[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8g5owl/daily_discussion_tuesday_may_01_2018/dyamiqi/?context=3).  Just moving up the SLs. I have no idea where this is going but feels dangerous. 
How long did it take to break 9k? This seems kinda similar
https://www.tradingview.com/x/Yy3jdPnv/   
just had the double daily tk cross, but i really don't like how it crossed. historically i think we have dumped right after a cross like that.  
200MA is less than $200 up, but volume is horrible, we're at the top of the range and we're very extended already. Plus we had that big liquidation some whales might have been hunting. Think we will dump very hard soon to 8.8-9.3k, clear the liquidation, fuck the longs, then start climbing again. Think we will go up $500 first though. I'm in a long rn but entering a long here is madness.    
edit: This feels a lot like whales pushing price into their short asks. Hence the big spoofy walls  
edit2: some other factors hinting we might blow off top here: [top of 3d bbands and bottom of ichi cloud](https://www.tradingview.com/x/BlnSibAz/)

In with 20% of my stack at a flat $9900 (zero leverage). No stops as per last time - willing to hold this for 1 to 3 months.

Another 50% laddered down from $9900 to the "McAfee line" @ $9100, which I honestly don't think will fall.

The last 30% will be for DCAing after I get BTFO when 9100 falls haha
!short XBTUSD 9900 12X 10%

Trying this position bot thing out.  I don't get how the last % is "Stack %" but so many people on the list have that at 100%.  I doubt that so many people here have 100% of their crypto holdings on an exchange. So not sure what is up with that.
The 9850 buy wall on finex with  500 BTC  is about to get tested. Interesting times
This could certainly go either way, but I'm adding to my mega hedge short if this drops below $9800.  It goes without saying that $9990 would be an absurdly natural local top for the next few days/weeks/years/infinity. 
[removed]
Y'all be even more bullish now than when we were at the same price point on the way up to 11.8k on the last bull trap. That’s how I know this isn’t going much further from here. This is the part where instead of using this opportunity to sell, you FOMO in and end up bag holding for years.

Some of you are just too greedy; we went to $20,000 per bitcoin. Even now, we are still at $10,000. The dream for years was $10,000 and even the most deluded bulltards like myself weren’t even sure if it would ever actually happen. And it did and it went to double that. Even if we had gone 10x higher to $200,000 you greedy people would still be sitting here waiting for $1m per BTC.
[deleted]
So many bulls in here. Anybody else hoping that this will break down like in 2014? I feel like this needs to cool down considerably before the next huge liftoff.

edit: Nice, it's breaking down below 9600
Just a reminder that we are due for a pullback within a few days.
Wouldn't be surprised if this dip is a little bear trap fakeout before another push up. Wouldn't be the first time for such shennanigans
Wow the price stormed back to $9900 fairly quickly.  I should have covered my short down near $9700 and reshorted higher.  I did that with 15% of it, but didn't help much.   Just bad trading, plain and simple.

But very bullish price action and $10K is obviously within easy strike at any time.
Hello all,

Volume on GDAX is atrocious right now. Notwithstanding that seems to be a roughy $100 pricing difference in BTC between exchanges paired with USDT (binance etc) and fiat gateways (gemini/gdax etc).
The last time I remember the tether risk premium to be this wide was during the early feb (if memory serves right) period when there was extremely strong tether FUD/negative sentiment.

Has anyone heard of any new rumblings that might be the cause of the premium widening currently? Is there a general feeling that this topic is on the agenda for the big SEC meet on monday?
Starting to look like a short :/ 

Bearish divergence everywhere but was thinking we might have strength to push up through 10k and invalidate alot of that. Not so convinced now. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/lqvhNJhr/
I hesitate in trusting this so called rally beacuse i see a lack of positive markers of adoption like google searches and new wallet creation.

Any thoughts?
I added to my mega short.  It is the biggest trading position, long or short, I have ever have in my life and making me nervous, but I need to get past that.  I should have shorted twice that amount earlier in the year, but just was beyond my comfort level. (Also I would have paid more than $50K in BitMEX funding fees, which would have been tough to take).

I need to get more comfortable with larger positions, and larger losses.  And of course when I was just holding my cold storage, I was taking a bigger gamble than this current short.   And that gamble definitely didn't pay off earlier in the year.

Anyway I still hope I lose money on this trade and BTC takes out $10K.  I want a stronger crypto market to trade (and hold) in, for as long as possible.
Does anyone else feels that btc keeps on pumping because bch is? 

Buyers running out of steam?

What was a strong stream of endless green on finex trade history seems to have turned into a slow trickle.
Premium on futures at Whale Central Okex still growing, but bears on spot are still in denial and selling. Hilarious.
IMO we are right in the middle of the wall of worry territory (that everybody and his mom expects at $11.5k). If I look at the aggregate marketcap of altcoins (excluding BTC) we are almost there. BCH even is about to break up above it. And I bet BTC guys won't let it happen that BCH takes all the spotlight.

FYI: I closed my long from $9.2k. Expecting a little set-back.

Edit: Emerging markets (e.g Argentina) collapsing makes for some good headlines (compare Cyprus but x100).
Closed my long from 9634 during the night at 9800 for a nice profit. Reopened a long at 9872 this morning, looking at the pink line here for the long term horizontal support/resistance https://www.tradingview.com/x/MZRm9KUp

I like that BTC is now tradable on higher timeframes(4-8h) and the organic buying seems to have increased a lot. This also shows that the market has increased it's confidence.

IDEX, a decentralized exhange has been having issues for over 3 days and increased their volume 4x in 1 week. This is another sign people are now looking for more exotic cryptos to make profit with
So we seem to have a slight OBV divergence on the 12 HR and 1D. Also on the 12 HR we are at an RSI level that has been the previous double top and is pushing overbought and we have a StochRSI pretty maxed out. We got the 200D MA just above us as resistance. Watching this level now and if OBV levels break upwards then we'll likely get some bullish action but we have R1 pivot at around 10400 and momentum seems to be waning a bit so I can't see us closing strongly above 10K but we'll see... A bullish case would be a pullback to the top of the daily Ichi cloud which should be decent support @ 9100 and allow longer TF momentum to cool off a bit. Shorts continue to drop while longs climb, the 3:2 ratio was pretty sustainable in a bull market but not so sure in a bear market.
So. Anyone watching this? A reversal here, with a new red daily candle, could make this pattern happen...

https://www.tradingview.com/x/HJJvO3OZ/
at this point its pretty much guaranteed to get above $10K 

just a matter of time. 

the question is just how high it can go. $10,300? $10,800? 

My trading strategy is still to scalp until we get above $12,600...at which point will start building out a hold position 
i have a long position at bitmex xbtusd from \~9300$ and my unrealised profit around positive 0.33 xbt, my realised pnl around negative 0.16 xbt! its almost half of my profit? is that normal? i know its kind of funding rate or smt but what can i do about it? should close my position?
Look like we will test the highs again I'm currently building a small hundyroll scalp long

Another post, sorry: It seems to me in my 7 years of bitcoin, there was always some impending doom casting it's shadow, you know btc is drug money, Gox is going to collapse, China banning, etc etc. But today I can't think of anything looming like that. What are May 2018's bitcoin market monsters?
Closed my short @ $~~8~~9,880 (decimal green) and opened a long simultaneously, as I previously said, I do not wish to go against them! Will monitor this trade closely.
Anyone else notice the monthly stoch rsi is oversold for the first time since 2015, and the lines just crossed up?

Moon Prevention Team working 'round the clock... not faring too well. Once we smash through $10K all bets are off in terms of when the new ATH is achieved.
this bounce back seems way too fast.  this might be another double top like at 9.7k a week or so back.  thats the only time I've seen it immediately jump back like this.  I'm tempted to short at 9950 and set stops above 10k just in case.
I actually understand the price rise , the SEC will probably by a 100% chance declare ETH and XRP are security's,  this will have a major impact on cryptocurrencies and bitcoin.  I expect a huge bloodbath on the markets next week.

So if we don't break 10k then is this a double top or not since we went $200 higher this time?

I'm going try to do the insane and try to get the "wick" of the next bgd

Using bitcoinwisdom the orderbook they keep falls off at 4200 and we are roughly 1200 coins away from 10k; 3k coins for 10.5k what I assume the cut off point is

Previous bgd had volumes of 4k to 5k coins

Going to the raw bitfinex table and scrolling down to 10.5 then scroll till it "feels" like 2k have past ... annnnnd putting a sell at 11.6

Science!

There should be a tool for answering this question
Here's to all the assholes that downvoted me. Called it that we are going to $10k. To be honest, I don't give a crap if it goes up or down. But one thing I do know is that there will always be a return. Scalp all you want and lose your shirt. I seen that insides of exchanges. They are manipulative as fuck.

> OPs_Mommy's wall of text was a really good read.

It's certainly well-written from the point of view of a visionary. The problem with it is that most of it would also make as much sense if it was posted at $20k. BTC may eventually be headed to $1M, but it can take all kinds of weird-ass paths toward that. So it's fine if you choose to buy and forget, but I think the points he made are not extremely helpful for traders.
This shit can definitely give you ptsd with money. I'm scared to make moves because of past failures. It's scary shit it's your future.
> I have PTSD from the BGD

Got that from every single BRD since end of December. I feel you.
[deleted]
Being flat is a great way to develop objectivity. Also, the nice narrative that we'll all see 20k before year end is perhaps too sugar coated to be believable - it won't play out exactly like the way we tell ourselves. And finally we must watch the US stock market carefully as BTC, whilst not directly correlated could certainly follow if stocks fall.
It that a good way to make other shorters nervous?
Jesus Christ... that must’ve been a hedge short right ? 
Fuck me, that's something you don't see every day. Was there a spike on okex?
Nice trade.   
Mind sharing how you came up with those targets?
Really Nice Trade! Enjoy your profits and the sun! 
Nice. And do you take equal % profit at each target?
I think the reason is that 9.8 is actual resistance, while 10k is just a round number. Since they're only $200 apart, a lot of people thought a break of 9.8 would guarantee a swift break of 10k
it's going to be eaten!
[deleted]
I don't think I'm understanding this correctly since I'm not used to looking at futures order books - if it gets eaten isn't the only possibility a dip?
Ah wow, I completely forgot about that liquidation. I'm not surprised the market pushes to get this filled. 
If you think this sounds like peak bull euphoria you must be new here
Historically this could also mean we're at a local top.
I went to the pub last week and my retired Uncle knew all about Bitcoin and Blockchain to a surprising degree.  I was pleasantly surprised, he wasn't saying it was for drug dealers and paedos, he was signing the praises of blockchain technology.  Super bullish.
I sold a chunk of ETH @ $500, but only re-bought a third of them @ $400, thinking it'd go to $300.

Yeah, didn't work out that well...
We’ve been over 10k already. Don’t expect real FOMO until we set a new ATH. And even then the majority will still be afraid, as it will seem like another sucker’s rally to them. The real daddy of all FOMO should come when we are way past 30k and rising quickly (if that happens at all).  
Yeah some alts have been leading movements recently, and BTC has so far nearly always followed on the trajectory up. It's all looking a bit double toppy right now though, though the downside is really low volume. 
Meh, realistically if we start poking our tips at 10k aggressively, the mindset of people will be reversal/moon ( maybe not the TA guys ). 

So that being said, if we get to 10k and see a BRD, i expect it to get swallowed up pretty nicely since we have proven the bulls are able to push 10k+ 
Retarded is this market son.  It’s fucking hot potato across the planet.  No one wants to do anything with any of this shit they want to pass it around for more money.  Maybe not the case in the future but is absolutely is now.
Is this good or bad? 

My knowledge on futures is beyond sub par
Futures aren't going retarded, they're going "normal." 

Even at a $400 premium, the effective funding rate for a long on June Futures vs Bitfinex is roughly the same. 
Yes, this sure doesn't feel like bear market action lately.

And BCH has more than tripled the past few weeks.  I'm tempted to short BCH/BTC ratio, but too risky.

Roger Ver and his shenanigans again. I think if it reaches 2k it would be a good short opportunity. BCH is such a pump and dump scam. This is like the 3rd time it's happened.
Bitcoin markets are going full retarded for over 9 months already , if these trends continue..
It looks exactly like the build–up to every jump upwards that has happened in the last couple of weeks. What a chance to fuck everybody with one move of the hand.
they're all scalping that one last time til they get their hand caught in the cookie jar 

Alts are pumping? Not my alts. Damn.
I see where you're coming from.
I had longs on futures from 7880 and 8650 on each of the two futures. I took profits last night at 9800 (swaps price). I've been itching to reenter, and fretting back and forth on how high I should set my limit buys, and if they'll get filled.

I've been relaxed since I opened those longs. Now that they're closed, I'm stressed the fuck out. Obviously the decision is up to you. But from somebody that's taken that next step... I wish I hadn't.
What ALTS do you have?  Luckily I put 90% of my portfolio in BTC, ETH and AMB.  I had a sea of red otherwise.  

I took profit and went to cash on everything but AMB, and only kept my position there because I have enough for a node.  

My primary reason is the SEC meeting Monday.  If they give the slightest hint on what they are doing with crypto, the market is going to act violently one way or the other.  I'm happy with my gains this month so am sitting that one  out entirely. 
As I said in my post below, we are probably going to consolidate here more. If you want to sell now, I think that isn't a bad idea. You can probably get another entry at 9.6 in the next day or so. 
I think Standard cloud format is better, at least for the last year as crypto has matured. 
11.6 is definitely what I'm eyeing at, but I can imagine there will be a lot of front running and we don't even break 11. Then we pull back a bit again to mid 9's again before breaking 12k. I think the bulls are finally taking this thing back.
If you think 10k is going to break, I wouldn't risk this trade for the potential $100/BTC. 

If you think we won't break through 10k, then this would be worth it.
That's what I did.
im sure plenty of people are scalping this trade right now.
parasites.

it's really ez to leverage up huge and stack onto the 10000 sell wall



Honored by the username mention, especially among such esteemed company!

Frankly, I think I'm the wrong person to ask, unless you need someone to pour a bucket of cold water on you, metaphorically speaking. I think Chewy will give you much better feedback, trading-wise.

I'm still unabashedly bearish in the medium term, though I see where you're coming from. If I was more confident in the bull narrative, I'd agree with you that this would still be a nice medium-term long entry. But I haven't been able to bring myself to go all-in long since I rode the BGD up and exited in the low $8Ks. Only a few (ill-timed, mostly) scalps since then. Sure, I'm salty about the missed profits...but I just can't shake the feeling that this is one big bull trap. I might very well be wrong, but the market hasn't convinced me yet.

High $11Ks is a good target, provided the market can cross $10K/$10.3K with confidence. If I were you, I'd exit lower, though ($11.4-$11.6K) because I imagine a lot of folks will want to take profit between $11.6K and $11.8K.

> ...blue lines...

I see what you're going for with the charts, but I don't think that's the best way to look at it. The $350 bottom in 2014 was just a wick, vs. the $6.6k consolidation bottom we had recently. I think a more apt comparison / better starting point is the consolidation/breakout point, which would be $450:$6.6K :: $680:??? ...and that would actually put the peak right where we are now, around $9.8K. But again, I'm biased so of course I'm Chicken Little here. If you ignore that, I still think the starting point is worth adjusting from $350 to $450.

> Now, I know that so, so, so,..... SO much is different now.

My bias will show again, but.... Everything *was* different in 2014 (from prior years). Fundamentals, adoption, etc. That didn't help. And everything is different now, too. But I'm betting on psychology / market cycles. By all accounts, that $450 to $680 breakout should have been the start of the next run. It really, *really* looked like it at the time, too. And yet it wasn't. I need to see something more convincing than "fundamentals" and "this time is different" because I already heard all that before, and it didn't work. But that's just me....

Also, I generally agree with /u/lvl_3_caterpie, even if I put my bull hat on. I don't know where he got $10.5K, but on the daily chart, this thing is just screaming for at least a 2-5 day stream of red candles to rain on everyone's parade a bit. Even if it then goes to $50K this summer, a correction like that seems incredibly likely. Just not sure whether that'll happen here, $10.3K, or $11.6K.
its been 3 weeks since we started this new uptrend on april 12.  I can see it going for another week without a big correction but 2 weeks is very unlikely.  10.5k is the highest I think we'll see before heading back down for a week or two.
As long it's over 9000 I can shout IT'S OVER 9000!! when nocoiner co-works and family ask me how the price of Bitcoin is going
As long as 8.4k holds (in case of a fat dump), things should still be fine. But it feels like almost nobody is expecting a dump so even a few hundreds dollars lower should have its effect on people who longed the high 9ks (if that ever happened.)
as long as we stay above $8.6k it doesn't really matter
Damn, my 9469 entry would have been filled... Why did i cancel it... 
I really hope you are right. The media attention from breaking $10K would give this bull run some more gas
Just wanted to come by and tell you that you're not alone on this one. Longs don't work for me at all. Shorts do but success rate there isn't great either.

The funding pool has been empty since eternity. It's frustrating as hell.
I’m still having that issue too. 


Are you trying to use all your margin? 
They know you’re there
target of 9.5k if the wedge breaks down. If 9.5k holds nothing but a healthy pullback on a Bullish swing. 

*Edit because my language use is retarded.*
volume is not decreasing as it should for it to be a bearish wedge. However, reistance keeps piling up more and more coins. Finex just keeps adding to the sell walls. So lets see how it will play out. 
Not sure about this, I mean 10k would always be strong resistance. 
This made me sad.

 *why u do this* 
"Big green dildo"
Black gold dongle
That's correct.
Ask your mother 
They call them cucumbers over on Ethtrader except they spell it wrong because Ethtrader is obsessed with stupid memes.    I like that name better
yeah, you are right. fuck the charts. Im going to the gym.
Just swallowed 400 coins and still chillin there.
~~wonder if it's a fake one to push bots up or will remain when it will be sold into.~~ and it's gone
Never be fearful. Just be ready to buy when it dips.
bitcoinwisdom.com is similar. Currently would take ~350 coins at 10k to go to 10.05k. 1000 coins would get you to about 10.125k.
Yeah I saw that too. Literally the only horrible aspect of CW yet that alone kills the whole service imo. And it moves on its own idk if you noticed. So annoying!

!short XBTM18 10074.5 1x 100% close

Keeping this as a diary of sorts.

closed $15 higher than entry...lol. But I feel much more comfortable at half my position size. I was wayyyy overleveraged.

I just wanna relax and enjoy my night, fuck this shit. Will look for a better entry later. Way too overleveraged with swaps and futures open, and I don't like putting stops on futures with shitty liquidity. 

If this explodes upwards it's going to be a mess and I don't want to deal with that. 

If it does get rejected from $9800 hard I'm sure I'll have more chances to short. Still holding swaps open although it's not on the bot. Just a 2x short.

EDIT: No matter where this goes I'll be happy I closed. I needed to have some discipline for once and close at a small loss instead of a large one after hoping that I could close at a small win instead. 
This post shouldn't really be stickied... there should be a permanent thread, or something in the sidebar. Making a post like this every day and sticking it is an eyesore and clogs the daily, imo.
If necessary i could change the bot to send PMs instead of commenting for simple entries without reasoning. That might help to reduce the spamming.
I feel a bit guilty for giving mods extra work...

Can we post here only without reasoning?

If you post a reasoning behind your trade and update bot simultaneously then it should be top level comment.

Good point about the 200MA.

RSI is hot but far from exhausted IMO (<=70 on all time frames).
Yeah this is looking quite promising, might kick off the rally to the 10k wall.

you can take out a low interest loan, move it to an exchange, then leverage 100x on that money.

Whilst trading, you can borrow as much as you want, but you can never actually lose more than the value of your account. If you take out a loan for trading via a bank or something, it's easy for you to go deep into debt if the price goes the wrong way. Also, it's just a lot easier to borrow for margin on an exchange (instant, no verification needed, so on).

insider info, it's raining on the tracks.
"When in doubt, stay out".
It's really not as ridiculous as it sounds. It's still cheaper to open a long on Bitmex that you intend to hold until June 30 than it is to open a long on Bitfinex that you intend to hold until the same time. 
The premium was $1500-$2000 at the top of the bubble. If we break 11.7k and re-enter the bull market the premium is going to be a steady $1000 minimum. If we go to 100k premium could be 10k. The premium on futures will be greater than the current price of Bitcoin, possibly in less than a year. Mark my words.
Buy the dip mode also seems active.
It is like options. And you are right about it is being expensive. Equvalent contract on deribit is at .00163
We? Are you trading with your dog?
I had my phone connected to the surround sound speakers in my room listening to music one night. At 3:30 AM, apparently my Bitcoin alarm was at full volume and almost gave me a heart attack. It was a bear alarm, which I had set to annoying emergency sirens. Wouldn't recommend it. 
the one with 12V wire plugged to your balls.
Just set your alarm to the song “you suffer” by Napalm Dealth
I sleep with my laptop open on TradingView, and use the built in "Beep-Beep" alarm. Even with my volume turned down to 1% it still pierces my soul. Possibly the worst sound I've ever heard. But effective.
Any app can be as loud as you want, it’s your phone that only can allow it to be so loud.

Missed the opening value in your syntax. 
Good call, I should have temporarily covered some of my short there, but would certainly reshort any bounce.
Nice call. Don't think 750 is it though, will probably see three pushes down in a descending wedge type thing. Unless this was just stop-loss hunting, but we'll see soon enough. 
Can you elaborate? Would this be bullish?

Legitimate question:
I know that MA crosses are considered lagging indicators, but do the shorter time frames of (9,26) make this a leading indicator?

I don't typically trade crosses, but primarily use larger time frame moving averages as a guide for support and resistance zones. 
way to go bro.. cats out of the bag.
might as well play face up.  best indicator we HAD. 





I think Bitmex funding time is preventing 10k. Expecting a pump as soon as funding in done. 56mins left
I shorted at $9900 on BitMEX.  I wish I would have gotten a higher entry, but that will have to do.  It was a no brainer, because just below $10K would be a natural place for a major retrace.
Why would people sell now? There's been plenty of time for profit taking.
I'm a bit torn. On the one hand I would've expected a bigger push to have already taken place, but on the other hand I agree with /u/diydude, rejections got bought up really quick, and for me it's more reminiscent of Nov's first break of 10k, wavering below for a while with increasingly higher lows untill we spill out upwards. 

Either way, I'm getting bored of it so I'm done looking at charts for today. 
Always so assertive about what you say, buddy, I think exactly like you.
I agree.. but do you have the courage to short?  upside 9800.. downside 1 million.

pickin' up lambos in front of REKTin' balls.


I have concerns tomorrow may be a weekend dip day. Am I wrong to think that considering the run of the last few days?
Bulls have to take 10k today. Buying has been relentless last few hours causing some good delta hidden divergence (bearish). Last time I noticed a lot of delta divergence it was bullish just before the short squeeze from 6k. But that was much more than now.
https://imgur.com/a/OtBxKoA

If we drop from here we won't stop at 9800 but much lower. Bulls still can break 10k though and if they do it will be very very bullish (if they hold it for half a day). But they are getting tired.

EDIT: wow why the downvotes. It's pretty clear a lot of limit sell orders are preventing a break of 10k right now. This will be a mix of profit taking and new shorts. If they succeed price will drop substantially. If they fail and price rises and stays up then it is a very bullish sign.
I'm in Iran. Demand for crypto is increasing daily, people are increasingly buying crypto as a hedge against depreciation of IRR and government manipulation of gold and USD. The government even banned owning more than 10,000 USD in cash to prevent capital flight. Now local miners and OTC suppliers are facing increasing demand for crypto. Even with at least 5% premium BTC is bought the moment it becomes available in websites. And the government is simply powerless and clueless regarding cryptocurrency. Add this to your bullish list.
I don't think Bitcoin is growing fastest in the United States at the moment.Other markets that can use coinbase probably aren't growing that rapidly, either. Growth for Bitcoin is global
I‘m not particularly convinced that trading desks, more accounts will lead to a long term upswing. You will have an increasing amount of people trying to make money from a set of assets. Although your mother might buy a bitcoin and hang it on the wall with her new Coinbase account, money can and will be made both ways. In this way, I would see it leading to a defined price band for bitcoin ( could be 500 to 800k or 5 to 8k for all I know).

Another question is if 90% of alts are destined to die, what does Coinbase need 100s of new employees for? Customer complaints?

I take everything I hear with a pinch of salt. Goldman Sachs trading desk will have one objective, make money. Not make money bullishly.


No, but I will be from now on. Thanks
Having a hard time to interprete this (at least on mobile). Could you give some insight? Much appreciated.
I have no clue what I'm looking at, though my screen glare is pretty bad atm. 
yeah this will pull back to low $9ks at some point in time. chances of this literally never pulling back to low $9s again are pretty damn slim
Go to GDAX. it's owned by coinbase
you can just log in with your account there and place limit orders without fee's. Watch a quick youtube vid how it works and you should be all set.

Don't go on bitmex to trade with margin untill you know the ropes, though you can start practicing in the testnet to see how it works. (also, youtube videos are your friend)

General heads up: This isn’t the sub to be looking at coins/ portfolio advice. BTC is the main topic of conversation. If you want advice on what coins to research, get a general idea in the Cryptocurrency Subreddit then DYOR.

Go to coinmarketcap.com and look at the per say top 30 coins, research and choose what to invest in from there. People here are 100% BTC and don’t play with alts usually and isn’t the place to discuss them. 

As for exchanges, most definitely Binance. Best of luck, be safe, and don’t take advice from anyone on Reddit before you DYOR!

Welcome
For suggestions on new coins you'd have better luck [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8h53ku/altcoin_discussion_saturday_may_05_2018/) at the alt coin thread.
Buy four. 

50% BTC & ETH

30% top 20 coin

20% top 50 coin
There's usually a "style" that people like for alts.

Passive Generation coins (NEO gives gas, VEN will give divendeds on main net. ICON will give dividends on main net. Ark gives staking benefits etc.)

Then you have exchange coins (Binance coin lowers fees / does burns. Kucoin shares profits. COSS shares up to 50 percent profit.)

Then you have networks in general (ETH, EOS, ICON, AION, NEO, ETC)

Then you have payment coins (REQ, LTC, NANO, BTC)

Then you have storage coins (SIA, PRL)

So find which "Style" of coin you like and believe in then go. I personally like dividends to make things more worth while for me to hold, hence me being big on ICON / COSS. 
amazing that we're just sitting here and futures are going from $150 to $400
Giant feeling this may play out exactly like 7800-8200 
They have DOWN contracts coming soon i think, you can see them on testnet.
As in no volume or glitched? Unable to look, currently.
It happens from time to time. Nothing too unusual. It happened earlier today in fact.
Should be stopped by a wick at least.
Edit: misread stop @10010. 10100 should be wick proof. 
your stop is going to get hundy rolled
The potential hidden bearish divergence is also somewhat worrisome. Hidden divergences are admittedly much weaker than regular ones, but I still take them seriously as a piece in the puzzle.
If you roll a dice 5 times & get a 6 the chances of getting one next throw aren’t any lower than before. The five green weeks are statistically independent events. There’s no reason a red week is any more likely.
[deleted]
awesome!!! it did it!!!
good eye!
seedless?
You are blatantly cutting off candles to turn that channel into a wedge.

Stop lying to yourself. 
and if I had to bet, we're breaking up out of the last one. If I were a betting man, I mean... (and I am)
I noticed this also, kinda spooky
we don't need the general public to get from 10 to 20k, we only need them for 20 to 50k.
I expect moon at 12k
Maybe I've got my rose-tints on, but it seems to me that is a blip in a sea of positive news.
you know shit's wack when the noobs on testnet are at a discount to spot

actually that's probably a pretty bullish sign lol
I'd say 10.2-10.3k initially, as I think the FOMO will take a little to fully kick in. 

But to be honest, my chart is currently a complete clusterfuck of lines and non-existent patterns to make sense of movements (after the recent pennants I've been lost)

9.9k is proving to be quite formidable so far and I think there's some hidden sell walls we'll first have to punch through which has me weary. In short, wouldn't open a long here as r/r isn't great.  
I think we'll go quickly to 11.5k (over a few days) where we should the uptrend being challenged for the first time in a while. 
No way man, my next target is 8.8k! Haha, no chance we go up from here, like, no chance... hahaha.

Logic: I'm short.
Watched that, 330 BTC Buy Wall appeared st 9990 then right to 10k the back down to 9960.

That’s the largest BTC wall I’ve seen on binance in god knows how long 
Not fat fingered, there were couple of whales with 400+ btc buy walls that got impatient (they kept buying 9930-9950-9980)
large institutions and corporations are going to discover they can have money A)  isn't private and you need permission to spend 
or B) is private and you dont need permission to use it

Eventually, after all the rationalization is over people are going to conclude they prefer their money to be in A and other people's money to be in B..   So they're all secretly putting their money into A while telling you to put it in B.  That's the big fundamental.  Bitcoin is better money.

The govts around the world will fight it, and in the war between money and govt, money always wins.  Because money buys govt.  



So I'm taking that you aren't a "true believer" of bitcoin? Because, imo, if Bitcoin gains the infrastructure needed so we can spend btc on anything (clothes, food, houses, etc.) then it isn't anything like what Wall Street is doing. I have no intention of "dumping my bags" on other people for my own gain. I trade simply to gain more money but I want BTC to succeed. I can't wait for the day when BTC only gains 2-3% a year so the hoarding mentality stops and people actually start spending it on stuff. Of course I'll have to find other things to trade to make a living but that is what I want. That, though, will take time. Even though BTC is mainstream it will still probably take 5-10 years for this market to mature to that point, so until then BTC will remain volatile, and I'll continue to trade that volatility.
I think most of your arguments (which you presented since the last bottom with some frustration) are flawed: [1] #tx lower means BTC becomes more useless, [2] not enough liquidity on exchanges to cash out paper profits, [3] no use for commerce only speculation (greater fool theory), [4] hodling is necessarily bad for bitcoin

Even though some of these arguments might contain a grain of truth (and bitcoin has its practical defects), I don't think there is a correlation to price evolutions. I would definitely not use these arguments as a *reason* to short bitcoin. Last year claims [2]-[4] could also be made, and we went up 20x. I would say [a] scarcity, [b] bubble hype-cycles, [c] and the human need for (financial) autonomy, are much more relevant for (long-term) price evolution.
Cryptocurrencies were created as an alternative to fiat money. You're measuring their liquidity in fiat money. Without adoption, they will remain a speculative asset, doomed to fail. With adoption, we will never need liquidity again. 
All I can think about when reading this is that you're talking about USD
I agree with what you’re saying but there’s little to no advocacy of HODL’ing here. It’s timing the market to come out on top, hence trading. 


Closed the additional long at a minor loss. We’ll give it another go soon again ;)

what is a cryptocandy?
Still riding mine from 6900 I wasnt doing stop losses but now I am and 2 fractal lows back has been good to me for riding this trend amd not getting stopped out. 
This is a very good strategy.

Also please post this under the top comment 
10x 100% requires 1/10th stack on exchange. Also, plenty of people only have a trading stack.
Nice one.
The stack % is just the trading stack, not the cold storage.
100% for me is like 400$, its the most amount i have to trade 
that was quick.
What is a "mega hedge short?"? :-D
You said similar stuff on the way down to 6k but yet here we are. You are not a bulltard, you literally call btc a ponzi and love all the bitfinex’d shit. A lot of people probably don’t know you since we have lots of new subs here. 
>end up bag holding for years.

I hate to call you delusional, but you're delusional. Attend any industry event and you'll immediately see how much this space has fundamentally evolved for the better. There will be no multi-year bear market. I'll pay you $10,000 if there is.
we went from 6500 to 10k in less than one month, no serious correction at all and people still want more. Do you understand this is steeper than 45°? Do you understand this current line is parallel to the one we had in oct/nov 2017?

Yeah this reminds me early December's greed when too many were shouting "new paradigm" withe covered ears.
so lemonade you calling 200k, with potential top at 1 mil?

Some truth to that and many people here have always been, and will always be, incredibly delusional.

But still doesn't necessarily mean the price won't go back up to $12K.  The market is so easily manipulated by anyone with reasonably deep pockets, so can be pushed up or down to whatever price.
Well, the A&E seems very likely to confirm so im confident we will reach 11.6k before deciding the next step . Now, that we won't retrace to 9k on the way its not something i could tell. 
it might go up, but it might also go down
Why os the deadline 12 hours tho 
Assuming we spend the next 12 hours in the same trading channel we've been in for two days, we're looking at a potential high of 1050 with a potential low range of 9680-9730. But, y'know, this is bitcoin. At any moment, it could pump higher or dump lower. 
I was hoping for it to break down too, but it seems like the only direction they want the price to go is up.
were you sleeping through the last 4 months of "cool down" , thats at least a year in regular market speeds.
This could be the last DCB, like we saw in 2014 before trickling down to ~$189
I'm hoping it doesn't break down, even though I have a huge short position right now.   But I would rather have a stronger crypto market and take a small loss on my short than have the price tank and clean up on this one trade.
Sooooo many people are hoping that.
I can see it happening once longs pile up again for “the next bull run”. Trading this madness until 11.7k. After support is formed above 11.7k, I will buy a hold position. But won’t hesitate to sell that position if support breaks.
It doesn't really need to do anything when the price is an imaginary number displayed on a fraudulent exchange.
Summer is right around the corner.  I wouldn't hold your breath.
Thanks Nostradamus.
while i do agree that's more likely, dont come saying that it will happen, it might happen we'll see
How do you figure?
What dip?
Or... wouldn't be surprised if BTC cucked us again. While we were all waiting for $10k, it taps $9,990 and heads back down. Fucking tease
I mean the rug will be pulled out from under this at some point, just don't know when yet. Could be here, could be $11.7k

>Volume on GDAX is atrocious right now. Notwithstanding that seems to be a roughy $100 pricing difference in BTC between exchanges paired with USDT (binance etc) and fiat gateways (gemini/gdax etc).
>The last time I remember the tether risk premium to be this wide was during the early feb (if memory serves right) period when there was extremely strong tether FUD/negative sentiment.

Nearly every margin enabled exchange uses USDT. It makes perfect sense to me for the price to be 1% higher on these exchanges during a bull rally. 
Binance uses USDT and volume is pretty low too, I am not sure it has anything to do with Tether. 
been amping up my shorts all night.. each time it fails to breach 10000 is another year on the bear market
Fud? Not just no liquidity? 
since exchanges enabled shorting USDT, i thought tether FUD was gone. If you think it is dubious, short the hecck out of it. Liquidation risk is 0 based on their business model so far.
[deleted]
I agree. Bearish divergence on the 2hr and the top of the daily BB's are at 10.2 so we don't have much room above us. Even if I was a bull whale I would want for us to go sideways for a bit, even sell some coin here and buy up whatever dip we may have. I think 9.5 tops.
bitcoin belongs in the hands of the general public about as much as oil land belongs in the hands of the farmers who sold it to oil companies for pennies on the acre.

[deleted]
"...paid more than $50K in BitMEX funding fees"

Use the futures contracts instead of the perpetual swaps.  Don't sweat the funding anymore.
Lol, the backwards logic, covert bearishness on the space and the insertion of suggested large net worth are too much. Get over yourself.
Don’t understand the logic, but good luck.
> It is the biggest trading position, long or short, I have ever have in my life

Why the fuck are you doing that now? 

We have two 500 btc limit walls 150 away from each other in a world of 1k dildos. This is going to explode one way or the other and you don't bet your entiere savings at roulette.

Lets be generous and say you have a 70% chance to be right on your next bet, you still wouldn't want to bet a new high amount. Loss aversion is only irrational in a world with repeat bets.
Good timing
yes lol it is, not sure why these people are saying no. BTC is basically sitting still/slightly moving up while BCH pumps to high heaven. arb bots probably buying up btc
BCH profits flow into BTC & ETH.
No, that makes no sense. If bcash were in any way relevant, the correlation should be negative between the two pairs. But because it's nothing but another useless altcoin, it behaves exactly like one too: random pumps and dumps while following bitcoin's bigger trend.
No.
Yeah Finex losing steam, but I like the fact that GDAX has gotten much closer to Finex in bullishness, plus LTC just pumped hard. We might need US markets to carry us over the 10k.
they rotated into alts, less resistance

but money flowing into futures is money not buying the underlying
that's how you tame the bitcoin.  unless you think its a manipulation play.  It's more of a sentiment indicator



I’m expecting a significant setback for BTC.

In 10 days BCH upgrades to 32x BTCs basic capacity and re-enables the bitcoin smart contract op_codes. A price rise is almost inevitable.

If BCH gets to 30% of BTC price wise then it will draw off about 30% of the hashrate, for btc a loss of hashrate means a direct loss of transactional capacity.

We could be looking at another December style BTC fee crisis right as BCH is pumping...
Yeah seems like confidence is restoring, wouldn’t be surprised that we see a significant dip 5-10% to restore reality and keep everyone on their toes. 
What time frame are you looking at? I see the 200EMA below us on all frames 1HR+
You had me until "bear market."  It's not a bear market.  Has never been, even during the January's glorious dump.
I don’t like the way it’s drawn. 
> at this point its pretty much guaranteed to get above $10K 


Please don’t say things like this 
How have you come up with 12,600
>i have a long position at bitmex xbtusd from \~9300$ and my unrealised profit around positive 0.33 xbt, my realised pnl around negative 0.16 xbt! its almost half of my profit? is that normal?

Sounds like you went long  ~$50k but lost ~3% to fundings? How long has this position been open? Certainly possible. In the future, I suggest keeping tabs on the fundings you're paying. The exact amount to be paid and calculation are shown when you login. 
Welcome to trading where you lose even when you are right.
Do you mean FUD or bad news?  Because there is a difference.
Paul Krugman must be biting his nails right now. Some of those 'bubble has popped for good' tweets he sent out a few months ago were ridiculously overconfident. I just don't understand what these people are thinking. Don't they consider how foolish they are going to potentially look? Especially Krugman, who positions himself as an authority on the subject and has so for many years. I guess they just assume it's better to double down than to admit that *maybe just maybe* they don't really understand.
!short XBTUSD close 9340
Not a bad move. Preserving capital is just as important as making profits. I made the same play. Sold at 9.8k and will buy back if we push through 10k with confidence 
I believe they also generally have much less stringent KYC requirements. 
There is a difference in effective value between USDT and USD that reflects the perceived risk that USDT is not actually redeemable for an equivalent number of dollars
Higher demand than supply.
GDAX has 80 USD discount. 
Tether is @0.9929 USD. All of the real USD exchanges are at a discount.
Bitfinex wallet sends USDT to Kraken the entire day in batches from 99,000 USDT , they still aren't able to prop up the price..  priceless.
That probably just means we're about to get hit with the next fud wave once everyone has fomoed in.
Mt gox is the gift that keeps giving. 
regulatory risk
gox but that moves at a glacial pace.. big exchange hack, but exchanges are becoming more established and anti-fragile, having survived previous hacks.

I think govt's have proven powerless to stop it, money corrupts their will, and the tech circumvents their methods.  It's not even a fair fight.

And the next wave of tech... lightning, even more bulletproof/private networks, dex's, etc.. is going to set the whole world on fire.



Being short
Tether being a scam could be another gox.

I believe it was his pal Charlie Munger, not Buffet himself, that called BTC a "noxious poison". Which is redundant. So ol' Charlie may be smart, but he ain't that smart. 
Buffet is an a$$hole.  He is beloved by greedy Americans, because he has a lot of money and he has the best publicist money can buy.  Plus he is about as status quo as you can get and he sure doesn't want crypto to do well.

His words of "wisdom" will keep some of the dumb money out, but not have that much impact overall.

PM the deets bro.  I'll keep it on the DL.

If you said there was 100% certainty that the price was going to $10K, then I get why you were downvoted and I probably contributed.

And yes of course this market is largely unregulated and is extremely manipulated on multiple fronts.

Agreed as a trader myself, but it's still a good reminder about the sheer raw potential that bitcoin and it's underlying technology has. It inspired me to accumulate more for my hodl stack. It's easy to get caught up in the price action, especially after a brutal 2-3 month bear market which we still haven't fully escaped from. I think we are at a critical moment right now were the market sentiment across crypto regulars and non coiners might make a 180 real soon. So it may not be a bad idea to rethink our strategies going forward 
Yup, it just kind of leveled my bearishness a bit. I just need to be more open to the idea that yes, BTC can still go to ridiculous heights. 
I'm still short but it's 1/3 the size now. I had several chances to close in profit and I didn't so I'm a bit annoyed with myself. But I lost a lot trying to short $9k on the way up to $11k the first time after the $6k dump and I'm not interested in doing that again. Would rather close at a very small loss than close at a moderate one.

I generally feel like we'll see $10-11k again so there's no reason to hold a short so long for me. I'm just trying to exit this short a bit lower because I think there will be a pullback before $10k but I may not get it.
The perfect time for a short with a tight stop/loss.
most likely 
why would that cause a spike? Sustain the price, certainly but it margin call with 0.5% difference, so it can't spike the price.
Sure, now that I'm on a computer, not a phone. There is an underlying assumption that we humans like round numbers and resistance/support tends to coalesce near these figures.

[Chart](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/znXya0Bo/)

I did my best to identify turning points/levels of support. For $9250, I look at 3/10 and 3/13. For $9550 I looked at 3/8 and 3/12. 

I chose $9950 based on psychological resistance at $10,000 paired with the assumption that profit taking/shorting should accelerate every $10 closer to $10,000. Ended up being $10 short of the local top.
Once hit, Targets 1 and 2 become stop losses for 1/3 of the stack each with my final third at breakeven. 

In a turn of fortunes, I guarantee at least a modest profit while leaving it on the table to get maximum benefit from Target 3 if things continue performing well.   
I get that.
Mex and okex do limit on liquidations
Some exchanges do limit orders/walls instead of market orders on liquidations
Futures order books are the same as normal order books.

And no, not really. I actually suspect the weird action we've been seeing is whales coordinating to stop price from moving up too high before that buy wall is cleared. 

Market wants to move up but socialized losses would mean everyone gets fucked if that wall doesn't get cleared. 

He was the #1 contract holder too, I believe
Okex socialize loses so users try to push into liquidations, especially big ones.
Good point
There’s no way the uneducated public is buying in right now. They’re still gonna wait for a while.
I sold 26 BTC around 200 once, thinking we'd retest 180... We learn the hard way. 
Either that, or when that sweet sweet Chinese New Year 红包(red packet) money starts coming through. 

On a serious note though, I too have recently been approached by various family members about my crypto trading ventures as the returns on savings are just silly currently. 
I agree for the most part. Others are wondering where volume will come from. Yahoo articles saying "10k! Bitcoin is back" will start the race. 
It means people think the price will be significantly higher in the future. 

Sentiment is now incredibly bullish, about as bullish as it has been in like 4 months

How exactly does that work? I don't really understand finex's funding rate
Premium on futures a buy signal? What was the price action after that? and ya I'm thinking of it. I can't see us just dumping after futures go thru the roof
I see it was up 10%, thought, shall I, glad I didn't.
Yeah, I feel like you get screwed every which way.  The new slogan should be "BTC, embrace the suck"
> My primary reason is the SEC meeting Monday. If they give the slightest hint on what they are doing with crypto, the market is going to act violently one way or the other.

Odds have to be well over 50%, they will do something aggressively draconian to crypto...either ETH or the entire space.  I will be shorting that meeting pretty hard.
Yeah, probably the smart thing.  FOMO is usually a precursor to bad trades.
I use doubled settings for BTC only. Alt pairs I use 10,30,60,30
[deleted]
Wow I almost forgot about the death cross. Remember when that was talked about to no end? Instead of a dump to 3k like everyone thought, BAM we start rallying to nearly 10k.
> I think a more apt comparison / better starting point is the consolidation/breakout point, which would be $450:$6.6K :: $680:??? ...and that would actually 

Thought about that too, here's how that looks:

2013 (420 ---> 680): https://www.tradingview.com/x/AUcKBLLd/

Now (6500 --> 10600) https://www.tradingview.com/x/4Qwjpro3/
Other than your gut, is there some sort of evidence/charts you'd like to post?

AKA, is there:

-  some precedent for length of recovery; 3 weeks VS 4 weeks VS pulling the timeline out of your asshole

- 10.5k is resistance you're targeting for some reason 

- percentage based, 10.5k lies on a fib level, or some other reason?

Ya have some 'splaining to do, and I'd love to hear it.
My fear here is that too many are now almost convinced it's going to break 10k and fly up again. As we know, Bitcoin has the ability to fuck people like that hard. 

Most TA 'experts' and the YouTube twat brigade are now on the 'smash 10k' bandwagon as well so that says to me, prepare like I do after a corner shop taco, huge messy dump incoming
I'm a litle nervous what will happen this weekend because it's - the weekend. But, pay week for many, sentiment and calls for 10k everywhere might make it happen.

Scared also because a lot of things are 'ledging' right now.
Right there with you. I'm @ a Startup Weekend Hackathon right now and cancelled all my orders before walking out the door because I wouldn't be able to deal with it this weekend. FML :|
There will be more options to enter today. My buy's are even a bit lower in the orderbook.
Already broke 10K on Binance  BTC/ USDT
I can't think of a time that bitcoin didn't go over a significant barrier like that just to do it. I'm pretty sure finex even broke 20k for a short period of time. 
Ya, I misunderstood what you were talking about before. I see now. Super lame
No, its not that. That's what I thought when someone posted this before. It's actually that their margin pool is all used up
Laughed out loud at your edit. I, too, struggle with languish use 
Good point on the volume, wasn't taking that into account.
Well, buyers are doing their dardnest to break up from this, which btc has a long tradition of doing in bull markets, so i wouldn't worry yet.
OHHHH I didn't even come close... thanks bro.
Fuck the gym, I'm hitting the bar!
Unfortunately their tool stops working at 5000 coins :/

And if you look back at the volume of big green dildos of the past, that cutoff becomes important

We'll see how it goes. I have a feeling this will be a fleeting need, only when the market is busy. If it ends up being bigger we'll figure out something permanent.

We can't do a third stickied thread, though. Reddit only gives us two. A linked thread in the sidebar could work, but there will still be a dozen posts in here requiring moderation. No one looks at the sidebar. 
No, I don't think so. A note (explanation) should be a requirement, or else the comment gets auto-deleted and isn't tallied on the site. Force people to give reasons for why they're executing a trade, otherwise they don't get to participate. Every comment should be explanatory in some way anyway, regardless of whether it's a trade or just commentary. This is a good way to encourage (demand) better comments. If the person fails to include a note, return an error. Something as simple as "didn't breakout like I thought it would - closing," is fine. If the issue is 'empty' comments filling up the thread then just make every comment great again.

Also, if you guys could go ahead and get rid of the alt coin thread, that'd be great. I liked it better when alt stuff showed up in the daily but was only permitted in small amounts. I don't want to read a separate thread just to track what's going on in the entire space. Clearly components of the '*crypto*' market are coordinated/correlated as a whole in some way, at least that's often the case. Changes in the ratios, especially across the entire alt market, are almost always related to what Bitcoin is doing or is about to do. Plus, it's not a good idea to entice "*people*" from the subs that shall not be names to frequent this sub. Keep the zombies out of the mall. But that's just like my opinion.

/u/jarederaj /u/justanotherlogin 
That would definitely help, thanks! It's a great bot and people seem to love it. We mods just need to find a solution to deal with all of the top level comments in the Daily. 
1) what about people just entering the trades in a form on the webpage (adding/edit position would also be much easier); when you press submit (or submit edit) you get a random code "xde47ved" via the webpage; the user needs to PM this code (no other text in PM); the bot verifies that e.g. the real chewy entered the trade (because the real reddit user submitted the confirmation code in PM corresponding to the username on the webpage); this will avoid much of the "comment traffic" in this thread

edit: in this case you potentially must run your webpage on a non-self hosted webserver with limited logging capacities; you cannot be system admin (worst-case scenario, you are logging everybody their IP adresses; and try to attack their computer or find their home adresses); maybe some amazon or google service can take care of security/privacy matters

just a suggestion

2) also, maybe in the future, you can give mods privileges to publicly do commands such as "!top-traders week17" "!bottom-caller week17" etc.

thanks for your efforts
Are you going to add limit orders? Not everyone margin trades

I for example put extremely greedy sell orders and buy back in hours later after they trigger(sell high buy averageish), that doesn't really work with what your doing

thanks for the heads up. I will set my timer :D
Could you eli5 the founding thing?
Yesterday we had a little dip until 12:15 then 30 mins later nice pump right before funding. price movement seems similar today. 
what does funding time mean? can you not get btc to your account all the time?
funding is currently at  0.07%, nothing close to the .37% (i think) we had yesterday. Wouldn't expect too much movement from this.

edit: it was .3% yesterday, so almost 4x what it is today.
Because they think they will have more money eventually if they sell rather than hold, at the moment.

I stopped trading at 8800, it seems like just hodling is the best option until it starts to feel toppy
Great minds think alike
>I agree.. but do you have the courage to short?  upside 9800.. downside 1 million.

I don't think anyone here is planning to short with $1mm collateral and just watch it get rekt. 
More like upside $3000, downside $10200 (when you can stop yourself out). ...which is why I shorted here.
Lol, been wondering when I'd see a "weekend dip" comment.  Surprised we didn't have a barrage of them yesterday to pre-explain why we wouldn't hit 10k, which I took as a bullish sign.
The impetus to act is on the bears. They have a lot of dumping to do if they ever want to see $5k again. We are closer to a Bull victory ($11.8k) than we are a Bear one ($6.4k) at this juncture.
This is my feeling too, I've got first layer of stop losses now moved up to 9700ish to take profit on about 50% of the position just in case.

Edit: but if we drop down lower, I don't think 10k within the short term is out of the picture.  Just that I can add to the position or re-enter, and I'd like to lock in some profits just in case.
Freedom
> And the government is simply powerless and clueless regarding cryptocurrency.

Maybe still somewhat clueless, but not powerless.   China and India already essentially banned crypto, so won't be surprised if Iran follows at some point.
lol. and i thought iran had strict capital controls. coming from a country where holding even 1USD or gold is illegal and bitcoin trades at a 15-30% premium.

Yeah I agree. It's just a matter of when at this point. 

Although, a part of me still thinks we'll see $10k+ short term but I'm being cautious. 

Closed my long, and currently sitting on my hands. 
The way dumps are getting bought up lately, I can't see it going much lower than 9500, and that will only happen if the big bulls want it to, ie, beartrap.
Much appreciated thankyou. 
I think a lot of us are also in alts, but we only (predominantly) discuss BTC here. There a beautiful alt discussion thread set up by our mods to discuss other coins. 

edit: /u/Ahmari90 posted it below.


Yeah that's quite baffling.
Could be.  Minus the Barts though (for the moment at least).

Probably won't Bart it for days again anytime soon.  I think enough people will eat up or feed candle sticks in either direction now though that even if a big MM provokes it to jump straight up, it won't just go flat and then jump back in another single candlestick.
Which 7800-8200? Elaborate.

Up are calls and Down are puts. But having Down doesn't put you on the other side of Up. You need to be a short-seller for that. (probably should be hedged since the delivery seems to be guaranteed).

how will they hedge the down since they don't have fiat?

That would be nice. I am however a bit worried that we might be heavily oversold at 10.2-10.3, or even more so at 10.6, if we go there too quickly, which might trigger a sell-off.
Expect major volatility that;s for sure.
> I can't wait for the day when BTC only gains 2-3% a year so the hoarding mentality stops and people actually start spending it on stuff. 

But at that point, why would you put money *into* bitcoin at all? You'd literally be better off buying T-bills which have a better RoI and are considerably "safer" in terms of risk.

What you're speaking of is hedging and the problem is the vast majority of people don't have the wealth required to worry about hedging. The wealthy use hedge funds to moderate their losses in a down market. The masses use *bonds* to moderate their losses in a down market.

So if only the wealthy would have a use for BTC to hedge, who is buying BTC to use as a currency? Traditional fiat is less expensive and easier to use.

> Even though BTC is mainstream it will still probably take 5-10 years for this market to mature to that point

And yet everyone is shouting for $50k by next year. The *most* you could ever see the price hitting would be $1M/coin before you start running into issues with the value of a single satoshi being too high for use in trade (as a Satoshi would equal one cent USD). The way everyone is shouting is for BTC to be worth $100k within like 15 months.

At that rate you'd have BTC hit $1M within 3 years but that's 2-7 years *ahead* of the fundamentals (assuming they even keep going up, which they currently aren't).
any fool who spends the god's coin is throwing money out the window.. just like the guy who bought that pizza.  The only purpose of bitcoin is to fuel rocket ships and MAYBE once in a while add a lambo to the carpark.

Each bitcoin you spend today is a million $$ you've lost in 2025.

> [2]-[4] could also be made, and we went up 20x

And 9/10 people didn't sell more than 5% of their coin when we were over 15k even though they had ample time to do so and they'd seen at least 3x price growth in their investment inside of 2 months. Most had been holding since before 2k so they were up over 7x and many were holding since before 750k or over 20x return. Yet, few sold anything.

Who cares if the price goes up 1,000x if ***you don't sell***?

> the human need for (financial) autonomy, are much more relevant for (long-term) price evolution

After the Wells Fargo scandal with accounts being made, their client count didn't appreciably change. While you might say the only other options are Citi, JPM Chase, or BofA, you'd be wrong. There are tons of credit unions (1/3 of all US citizens have an account at a credit union). Yet, few left Wells Fargo to go to another institution.

The reality is most people really don't care enough to change. While that type of thing is terrible, the modern banking system is still *incredibly* convenient for Joe Mainstreet. Much more so than crypto, which takes a technical literacy well above that of your average person.
> Cryptocurrencies were created as an alternative to fiat money.

Yes it was but adoption isn't up, it's flat and has been for months. People aren't using them as currencies, they're treating them like collectibles. Hoarding them to an extreme degree for wealth gains on paper.
Right! Lol. 

A lot of people seem to still have this problem of not understanding bitcoin is money you can spend. Hodling or hoarding, we can still use the value in bitcoin without having to sell back into other currencies. This alleviates downward market pressure because there's less and less of a need to cash out. The concept of "paper gains" as an illusory thing doesn't really apply to bitcoin. It's very real usable value. It's a slow global one way adoption shift from one type of money to another.

> 10x 100% requires 1/10th stack on exchange

It's my understanding that the "100%" part of it means 100% of your stack on the exchange.  "10%" would be 10% of stack.

And "trading" stack means little to nothing in a practical sense, as far as assessing risk.  Someone trading 100% of their trading stack could be taking far less risk than someone trading 5% of their trading stack, depending on what percentage that is of their total holdings/net worth, etc.  It just seems like a meaningless number.  I guess I will set mine to 100% all the time now.
It was a no brainer, regardless of where the price goes now.  There are only a few times a year when it's painfully obviously to go either long or short at that particular time.  This is one of them.  And I screwed up by not shorting at $9950 or a bit higher.  I just wasn't paying attention.
Then again, it's a meaningless number.  It's not meaningless to the individual who knows what level of risk it represents, but it is meaningless to everyone else who have no idea what level of risk it is.
Yeah, around 1k sold on 1m candle there :D
It is the 2nd largest position I've ever had, although it is just boxing in most of my overall crypto holdings.  Of course BTC could rise, while the alts dropped and then I would really lose, but it's the best I can do, because it's difficult to hedge alt positions.

This is the same guy that was posting about a drop to 1-3k$ everyday when we were at around 6500$ for over a week. Not a reliable source i think
RemindMe! 6 months
Possible, but not any time soon.
Why does the A&E seem very likely to confirm?
Possibly sideways as well. Roll that three sided dice.
*10,050
Were you sleeping through 2014?
It doesn't look like four months of cool down if you draw your line through the lows starting at 6k in February. Looks like one month of cool down if you start in December. If you draw your line from the ATH it will always go down unless you're right at the ATH.
yeah because nothing changed in the markets or availability
There’s nothing imaginary about the price. 
What's summer have to do with anything? Are people still equating weather to price sentiment? There is ongoing economic anxiety that didn't exist last summer. Last summer was all gains across the financial markets aisle.
I think it’s important not to get ahead of ourselves here.
Following charts for a while...
Okay, I jumped the gun a little there.
looking how those dips get bought up like crazy, I wouldn't count on it
Wick to $9,999.90
Also true. Needless to say BTC doesn't really surprise me anymore. I've become apathetic
We could make new ATH before our next big pullback. Seriously, if that was the bottom then usually bitcoin does slow and steady up until it is close to the ATH then it bursts up.
I agree actually, not like bear market agree, but we do need to settle down a bit. A week or two in the $9200-$9500 range would be ideal. Going up at this pace is silly. 
False. CEX has 2x/3x margin trading and it's also at a discount right now. No tethers there.
Uh, Binance has like 85% of the BTC/USDT volume that BFX has. How is that low?

Maybe relatively low as Binance has actually had more volume than BFX some days recently, but it's certainly one of the highest volume Bitcoin exchanges right now.
Wutang? +1
I agree. However we have mined more than 80% of the supply and only a small part of the general public holds some.
I agree, this does seem possible.
not only is hoarding bullish, its natural consolidation of the market.  These are the bumpkins who sold their land cheap to Standard Oil.

And suffer additional volatility and changes in premium/discount.
That's what I should have done, but those just spike hard when the market turns around.  But that would have been the move to make at the start of the year.  I just wasn't smart enough or strong enough to make that happen. 
> covert bearishness

Some people here are too funny.   I just said I have the biggest short position of my life and you think my bearishness at this moment is "covert"...ummm..ok.

Looks like he made a good call.
He mentioned in an earlier post that this is a hedge short, not a YOLO casino short. It makes sense, although I personally would scale into such a hedge closer the 11.7k.
I don't have my life savings in my Bitmex acct.  It's only about 4% of my net worth in there.   I really should have a larger position than I do.

> This is going to explode one way or the other and you don't bet your entiere savings at roulette.

No, of course there's not 100% chance it will explode one way or the other.  It could trend down slowly or trend up slowly or move up fast or down fast...or sideways.


It is a no brainer to short just below $10K, just like it was below $20K.  It's just a natural resistance point and high potential reward for a short and low risk for a short if you can stop yourself out quickly enough.
That would make sense
Bitcoin cash is the only legitimate "altcoin". Bitcoin cash is part if the bitcoin experiment and forked giving everyone both btc and bch because people disagreed on the scaling issues bitcoin faces. Bitcoin is an experiment and bitcoin cash is doing exactly that, experimenting with big blocks to improve scalability. I don't see anything wrong with that, the only people that are butthurt about bitcoin cash seem to be either greedy people that do not want "competition" in the money going towards crypto or people that did not hold bitcoin during the fork. 
Well, it is like buying the underlying, because now anyone can make 4&#37; by buying on spot and hedging it on futures, so it creates equivalent buying pressure on the underlying

I sure hope so.  I've been sitting on a pile of shit fiat for weeks looking for a good opportunity to convert it to real money.  If 10k breaks, I'll just bite the bullet and buy there.
200 MA on the daily. Currently @ 10037 on finex' chart
200d MA (not EMA)
1D 200 SMA at just over 10K
Careful here. If you think that the weekly can keep being green forever, you might be surprised. 
Ok
but I can, if $10K was going to be the line in the sand, we would have had a blow off top at $9,960. Instead it only dumped down $100 from there. 

That's an indicator for me that it'll get above $10K after a bit of consolidation. 

Like I'd be seriously surprised if we don't get above $10K by the end of today/end of weekend at the latest 
This is why we can't have nice things. We keep playing ourselves.
Because 12,400 was the old top on the bounce before it crashed back down again

So 12,600 would mean a higher high and would signify that the reversal is happening. 
I think I opened around 27th April.. I have never seen that much before. Is there something wrong from my side? Or this funding rate is constant? Or changing by time? Thank you, I will check for that tab. 
honestly the smart money is using that place just for daytrading shorts or hedging cold storage.. the premiums are huge to begin with and the funding rates get big.  If you wanna long just use more capital and hold coins.  Pick a safe exchange.  
i deleted it, was too trolly.  You know everyone's waiting to break 10k.  Someone might have panicked and actually sold.


I’m more surprised that an economist would have such extreme views to the extent its unprofessional and inaccademic 
i mean all he has to say is "it's a bubble" and say that people will prop up prices to keep it from popping all the way
I honestly have such a hard time with my "game plan".  I am long term bullish, but don't want to be left holding the bag.  Of course the biggest losses I've had were when there were monster drops and I tried to HODL through it at first, but then at some point I had to cut it loose, only for it to come back a day later.  Then other times I try to really stick to my guns (11k, for example), and get screwed there too.

If I keep all fiat then I get screwed by not being in when liftoff happens on a random Tuesday at 3 in the morning...

Then, when we're taking the stairs up I tend to want to preserve capital, which inevitably means that a high percentage of the gains on the way up are lost.
actually in the bitcoin world, usdt has more utility than usd, so it's in higher demand.. ironic as that is.

USDT can do many things the USD cant.

USDT: travel instantly between exchanges for an arb
USD: wait 2 weeks for a wire transfer which will be KYJ'D into assuming you are a witch better wait 3 months til we let it go through (or prove you're not a witch).

USDT: can loan out at crazy rates to crypto gamblers
USD: need to buy a bank to do it or become a MSB terrorist who goes to jail for 50 years for not filling out the proper form.

USDT: accepted by the largest exchanges in the world, binance, bitfinex, bmex.. which also offer the most innovative services/products

USD: accepted by a few USD exchanges (GDAX/CME) is good. rest bleh.


so what would you rather own as a crypto-trader.. USD or USDT?

supply and demand.
oh one last thing tho...

USD: real $$ 
USDT: some pyramid scheme that will probably implode in a few months.


interesting, thanks

I see this as a surge from mining supply. It's depressing the price, but it's basically priced in.

0.0x I meant, yet I closed with a slight loss considering the lending fees.

I am thinking to abort this all together. I can't even go to toilet like this.

Uh I just realized. I think I am done with this for now.
Should I enter this in the open trades site lol? You crazy!
Whether I like it or not I've had to accept that it's just easier to do fiat comparisons in USD. Even though my currency is GBP and my fiat on ramp has to use EUR, doing the conversion to one of those in my head constantly got old very quickly.
And 18.7... Oh ye of little faith! We're still in Kansas. The foothills aren't even in sight yet.
I want to believe we will effortlessly cruise up to 11.7k but have the feeling the 10k barrier might be a bit of an anti climax (although an important milestone). 

I think it will still be a slow climb over the next few weeks with some pull backs below 10k along the way.

I hope I’m wrong 
nothing wrong with a little bit of double top insurance
LOL I was wondering too 

lol i think he's hilarious idk why u guys dont
yeah but same difference bro, the wizard of omaha and the great mungini thinks bitcoin's a ponzi.. also charlie lee sold the top.

You know, it's funny: We did actually get a pretty good pump out of Chinese New Year.  Nobody seems to notice that when they make these jokes.  On 2-16 (Chinese New Year) it was ~$9.8K, on 2-20 it was ~$11.9K.

You know what else: I would bet that some of the recent rise is due to Wall Street bonuses too.

It's really dumb to keep money in a savings account.

In the past they've been able to pump it 30% in a day. Wait until that happens then short it to the ground.
you think with government sachs just announcing the Circle deal, the SEC is going to crack down?

He was talking about shorting the minor drop before what he thought would be another attempt at 10k, not a $7000 drop. That's why the part you quoted was prefaced by the words "If you think 10k is going to break"

Nice charts, yeah, blue-line-wise that looks much more appropriate. Given the adjusted target for those of $10.6K, do you still feel confident in $11.8K? I'm guessing a wait-and-see approach, most likely?
well that is a needlessly hostile response.  

* look at the weekly charts and count the average length of consecutive green candles.  How often do you see 5 or more?  In light of that, why are you acting like its a given we'll go 5 and I must be just pulling the number 4 out of my ass?

* 10.5k is about what we'll go to if this trend backs down at the same percentage as the [2014 bear market](https://i.imgur.com/71skmkf.png).  I'm not expecting it to be exactly the same this time but its no less valid than the average tea leaf TA chart that gets posted here.

those are my reasons and you can continue to believe it will go to 11k or whatever you want.  You asked for thoughts and I regret wasting my time on a response.
I totally agree. The market can mess up with you real good, and it seems that people tend to forget it very quickly. 
It’s either Kraken is telling us something, or they don’t want us to make money 

Can’t wait for Binance to open margin trading 
Are you trying to short or long? 
That’s not even it... keep trying.

oh okay. should I redo it?
Yeah, I don't even see the sidebar on mobile. I've been here about a year and think I've visited the site twice on desktop. 
This matter should be decided by the mod team. I can implement whatever gets decided on the bot, just let me know.
Just a side note, the bot is active on the alt threads also so its possible that alt pairs are added to the database.

Bot position posts with less than 50 characters are now responded by PM.

Anything else i can help regarding the bot just let me know.
I don't know if there is any way to move/delete this comments automatically by the bot but that would require a mod account and i know giving mod authority to a bot is dangerous 
The idea is to stimulate users to state their positions and reasons. During the next week i'll add the commands to edit and delete the positions. Profit taking will also be possible. 
Have no way to control that. This system was not thought for that.

how many scalps can you get in a day?

Doh, lemme fix that.
I don't have the cajones to add much more to my position, even though I have margin room.  My liquidation price is not till $10,200 and i would try to cover for a small loss if it takes out $9900 again or breaks the downtrend wedge line.
Based on the arbitrary ascending wedge we've developed today, I have a target at 9.5-9.6k. I won't be longing the dip until then. Also, though the 1min candle was substantial, not enough volume for a nice capitulation dip where the r/r is good. Gotta be patient for this one. 
Interesting, so this cross over that’s about to happen shows a shift in the trend, and that a reversal is upon us. Cool stuff didn’t know this. 
Yeah that's what I figured. 

I was just thinking since the averages are calculated against 9 and 26 days there could be a short term signal for movement, since most trends on a macro scale last for more than 9 days. 
Funding is paid and received every 8 hours on bitmex. It's like an interest rate which buyers/sellers get. If the number of longs are more than shorts, longs pay shorts and vice versa.

Today, longs will pay 0.0761%, and shorts will receive 0.0761% at 5:00 PM UTC+5, which is about 49 minutes from now.

Depending on the market conditions, on BitMex either longs pay shorts or vice versa every 8 hours. It's worked out as a percentage of the number of contracts in your position. 
Absolutely agree. Just that bears are putting in some work under the cover through limit orders. They absolutely need to start dumping at some point soon if they are to succeed. SO if we dump it is not a good opportunity to buy expecting 10k as we are likely to have a multi day/ week retrace as the bears have will have loaded up on shorts and be willing to push it down further. It does look like we will break 10k today though.
Banning crypto? How can you ban crypto? You can't shutdown OTC market and mining. At least not when iranians are concerned. We've become excellent at hiding what we do. And when you have such incentive as preventing your capital to depreciate 30 percent within a week, you will do anything to preserve it, I have customers from government officials looking for crypto investment advice. Enough said.
Nah, the government are all crooks, no such thing as enforcement. Where are you from I'd you don't mind me asking?
Thanks!
it'll look like that until the floor falls through, which it will at some point. maybe it won't be low $9s but there will be a dump at some point in time
no problem! Good luck and if you have any questions you can always shoot me a PM.

Edit: Don't invest more than you're willing to lose, rule #1 in crypto (: good luck!
I’m actually mostly alts, ( only hold 4 coins ), but what I meant to say is there’s a plethora of people that hold mostly BTC. 
My interpretation was he meant just gradually meandering up a $400 range.
you can make money if the volatility is higher than the options premium. It is a volatility contract although dudes on bitmex are going to trade it for price exposure.
I'm honestly out of my depth and don't really understand the machinations of puts and calls, i just thought i'd mention it.
who will win a lvl 3 caterpie or lvl 5 metapod
I pretty much agree with your assessment. In fact I don't think we'll see 1M/coin anytime soon. I think we'll see the top of the S-curve somewhere between 100k-400k a coin at which point BTC levels off for the future.


For me, I just see BTC as exactly as it is, a decentralized, global currency. The number of people traveling and living abroad is growing exponentially. I live in a different country than my parents and I think my own children will do the same in time. I imagine anyone who would travel in the future to load up a debit like card with BTC, pay for food, hotel, etc. using BTC without ever having to go through the national currency. 


The central point of cryptocurrencies, as you are well aware, is the fact they are decentralized. As you stated, it is to be hedged against the current system which is becoming more obvious that it is strained. Now, if people can create the infrastructure needed for BTC to be used on a daily basis to buy food and clothes with, then the barrier to be hedged against the current systems is reduced dramatically. But, as you said, the fundamentals like those are lagging. 
/s right?
joe mainstreet thinks bitcoin is a speculative tool they'll gamble away their $$ and then go back to fiat.  corporations are far more intelligent and realize crypto is power.. they'll horde it and buy off the regulators with it.  Corporations have far more than 21 million x today's price in cash.  Joe mainstreet is irrelevant and will be left with jackshit.  Just like joe mainstreet doesnt own the oil wells, natural gas, mineral rights.  Even though they could have.

"Joe mainstreet in 1900 wanted faster horses.. not the model T" - henry ford
"the meek shall inherit the earth.. but not its bitcoin" - j getty



Well, if I can buy the stuff I want with crypto, I will use them. The issue is adoption is not wide spread and too much speculations prevents proper utilization. If we reach a stable price with wide spread adoption, I guess things will be different. This is a new frontier, cryptos are a new asset class. We just have to wait and see how this turns out.
Except that's false. You aren't "spending" it, you're simply liquidating it at the point of sale. Almost every company I see that "accepts bitcoin" is actually using BitPay or another service which simply sells the coin (for fiat) at transaction.

So it's still being liquidated to fiat, you just aren't doing it on an exchange with a market or limit order.

Candy that comes with limited edition crypto tokens? like crypto kitties but in real life
Agreed. I only keep a tiny percentage of my hodlings on an exchange so even 100% would not be a significant risk.
That will be used to calculate the total PnL. Everyone starts with 100% and in some time, system will be able to know if you earned or lost. 
At least it's exciting!
Trade your alts for BTC and go for a mega giga hedge.
You called btc a ponzi and literally copy paste shit from bitfinex’d. I don’t care if at one point you were a perma bull you’re clearly anti btc now so nobody really cares. 
I'm simply tired of bears talking shit, unwilling to back up their thesis with capital. Dush was the same way.

The offer stands to anyone who actually believes Bitcoin will be worth less in 2019 than it is today.
This guy is the most annoying person in this subreddit. He claims to be a multi millionaire so he spends his time trolling bitcoin markets, no poster in this place can compete with his level of annoying. He got burned bad because he also calls for regulations nonstop and jerks off to tether FUD and bitfinex things.


Not sure which of the two parents above you you are referring two, but neither of these guys is a reliable source of advice.   Lately both come out and start preaching when we are at the cusp of something.

He's long ;)
Weird i didn't receive a notification about this one . But, basically, how the market has been behaving . As long as it doesnt go below 8.8 im confident it will got at least to 11.6k 
Oops. Yes, that ;)
I don't even care anymore about profits, i hope this keeps going up so that i won't have to see this stupid comparison with 2k14 anymore
[removed]
Nope i was there, sounds like you weren't because nothing about this is Familiar. 
Um I'm not doubting you can find a line to draw whatever storyline you want to spin. 
So this time is different?
Yep, theres just alot of salty people out here that stayed on the sidelines and they are now hoping for BTC to collapse
There is nowhere near enough liquidity for any significant amount of people to get out without completely crashing the market. 

That's the imaginary part. You see $9950 but really it could be $8k by the time you want to sell in the case of any significant event 
Stocks are right at ATH
That's a non-answer...
This is what tips the big bulls' hand. They're just playing come-to-papa and waiting for the dumps to get cheap coin. They know what the market is doing when Mr. Dumpy's not a factor.
lol this
> CEX has 2x/3x margin trading and it's also at a discount right now. No tethers there.

Price differences on small exchanges is common, due to lack of liquidity. Cex.io has no volume on their usd/xbt trading pair... 

Bitfinex volume today: $260mm.
Kraken: $50mm.
Cex.io: $6mm. 

There are 211 BTC trading pairs with higher trade volume on CMC.

As you said, it is low compared to what's been seen lately.  (not just talking about this WE) . 
everyone had the chance to buy.  I remember passing at 100$..  Oil?  what's that.. just a bunch of smelly black liquid that kills my crops.  that's for weirdos and crooks..  A true god fearin' man grows his beets and lives off hay and eats dirt and the fruits of his own labor.


good bot
It does, but that just makes it a new bubble full of whales :|
Not untrue, but the additional volatility is constrained.  If you shorted the June 29 futures right now, you would be capturing an additional ~3% premium if you hold the position until the expiration in 8 weeks.  The discount/premium fluctuates along the way in response to funding trends, but it must converge to the spot price.  As you get closer to expiration, that volatility dies down.

It is far more predictable and controllable than funding rates for longer-term positions.  Even if you don't intend to keep the position until expiration, I believe they are generally much less frustrating than perps where you can potentially end up with a sizeable amount of profits eaten by constant funding.
Or potentially enjoy the delta of a premium, and fill orders with the volatility.  
They also have dropped below market prices during crashes.  They tend to make price movements slightly more exaggerated, which isn't a terrible thing if you are entering good trades on average with managed risk.

At least with futures you know what you are getting if you hold the position for a couple months.  The price converged to spot price in the end.  With perps you may end up with wildly different final P/L due to funding.
I was referring to perma-bearishness here:

>I want a stronger crypto market to trade (and hold) in, for as long as possible.

But you're right though, people here *are* too funny. Such funny people pretend to drop casual hints as to their net worth (which is wholly unverifiable) as if it's relevant to anything. Go masturbate somewhere else.
Maybe in direction, I was criticizing his amount; they are different aspects to this game.
Oh god, you guys are still doing this shit? What year is this?
ive seen 'hedge' used like this but i dont get it.  If you were to buy on the spot market, the 'hedge' would be short futures contracts, not long, wouldnt it?  And i dont get the point of that hedge, its not an option play.

Who's talking about a flippening besides you?

As long as LN is not working securely and even more important not adopted on a large scale, BTC use cases are limited. SOV is still a strong use case. But do expect newcomers to look elsewhere if they want to transact now.
Of course the 8mb blocks aren’t full, bitcoin isn’t meant to have full blocks.

BCH is moving to 32mb and upwards because businesses and services need the reassurance that it won’t clusterfuck itself like BTC did in December.

Adoption matters.
The BTC chain remains at a fixed low capacity.

When usage rises above this low limit the only way to get in on the chain is to outbid other users. That has not changed.

The only reason the fee crisis subsided is that users stopped making transactions, $50+ per txn will have that effect.

We should keep this discussion trading related but it’s necessary to address your false claims, only sufficient excess block capacity can keep fees predictably low such as on the BCH chain.
k, thanks
Sure, we'll have a red weekly here and there throughout the summer.  But it's not a bear market and never has been.  December was just Bitcoin showing off, and January was CME/CBOE whales effing around + newbs freaking out.  You want to do good TA?  Draw longer lines or draw lines from points that are not anomalous (like the Dec high).
It didn't get above 12k on the bounce from 6k.
its dynamic and its high because eveyrone's bullish atm

>I think I opened around 27th April.. I have never seen that much before. 


Were you not around last year? Longs paid shorts a small fortune in 2017. If has been quite the opposite during Q1 of this year, but started swinging back in the direction of shorts being paid more recently.
Same here bro, I have sold 80% of my stack into fiat

Took some small profits

If it goes above 10k I may jump back in

So hard to time these plays
Id rather hold the one that is real money lol

I didnt say it was... I said that'd be a thing like a gox collapse to kill the market.
I wish that were more true, but the fact that he’s presented as a Bitcoin authority by the financial community (in a decentralized space which almost by definition doesn’t offer a single voice to counter him) continues to give him a platform to confuse new participants in crypto and misrepresent BCH as more viable than BTC
Don't give up bro. Follow this advice: Take everything out of crypto you cannot afford to lose. Gamble with the rest at bitmex casino. You will see you will be able to go to the toilet again.
You must mean 8.8. Either way yeah living a life and margin trading are not compatible.

[removed]
Gentle nudge of a warning about rule 1 here. Just removed this one, this time.
Are those BCH price tickers you see at the top ?
The way I look at it, if we hadn't used bitcoin back then, it wouldn't have much value today. I think the same thing about mBTC today so that in 5 - 10 years I might have the privilege to lament spending 1 mBTC on something stupid.
Bulls don't moo.  Cows do.  Big difference, believe me.  Bulls are scary af in real life.
I just said that.  Goldman Sachs Circle nonsense means little.  They may just go after ETH and the ICOs, which might be ok for Bitcoin, but they are going to fuck someone for sure...because that's their job.
Ok yes I got that backwards and thanks for the correction.

But you can still think $10K will break and still find it smart to short here, if you calculate risk/reward to still be in your favor.
Oh that's true, it did happen that way in 2014.



Personally I don't see why every single thing that happened in 2014 should happen today. What if we are writing history instead of following it this time?
Lol, it's not hostile, grow a thicker skin dude. I'm shootin the shit with ya.

>You asked for thoughts and I regret wasting my time on a response.

One word. Quality. Quality of your thoughts/arguments. I asked/challenged you to respond with reasoning to your comment. You did respond, but we still aren't anywhere near the level of detail that makes me go, "hmm. good point". So let's take a look at it:

> look at the weekly charts and count the average length of consecutive green candles. How often do you see 5 or more? 

First off, don't ask me to do the work for you. That's *your* indicator you used. Tell us why it is meaningful. I think it's an awfully weak one, and I'll explain why later. But if I have to, here is the weekly:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/513hwFju/

and here is counting the weeks of uptrend:

https://imgur.com/a/YH3PdBz

The "average" is 4, but do you see why that is a weak indicator? It says absolutely nothing about the magnitude of the trend, and the standard deviation of that data set is off the charts bad. Nothing about the weekly candles "duration of staying green" warrants a trade decision. Back-test it and see how awfully you would have gotten wrecked.

Now, if this seems hostile, I apologize. I won't, however, apologize for pointing out your trade proposal has no fundamental basis that anyone (including you), should use to invest/risk money on.
He said "and I'd love to hear it" I wouldn't take that as hostile! 
Tbh it didn't seem hostile to me. Just a sarcastic tone and the question was warranted. Lighten up.
It sucks because the result is I have to settle for positions that are worse and smaller than I had intended.
long

edit: so yes, you might interpret this in a similar way as you might high lending fees for longs on BitMex

Enter the command 2 times to close both and i'll delete the one with the same entry as close. You can enter both on the same comment as long they are in different lines. 
Awesome, thank you!
There are workarounds. It would mean the bot's comments never show up though, which may not be ideal from your perspective. Can you not set it to PM rather than reply?
> The idea is to stimulate users to state their positions and reasons. 

Ok, fair enough. This is indeed more valuable than people entering them independently on a webpage. Not sure how to solve the problem of minimizing comment trafic then.

No, I though BTC rates you are talking about. Is Bitmex using fiat somehow?
Wow, nice. Best song
Closed at a small loss. This is why I don't trade much.
Enter the command in a comment of your post, i'll delete the wrong one on the database while the delete command is not available
I actually hAve us in a falling wedge on the 15. Do you see it too? 
One reason is that cryptos are extremley momentum driven and not fundamental driven, with the whole FOMO/panic selling and so on. Therefore different kind of momentum indicators on the higher time frames has worked well for me, but of course it might not for someone else. All depends on your trading style
So if you close before the funding period, you don't have to pay it?  

If not, how does this impact the price?
And when you guys talk about number of shorts vs longs... you're talking value rather than the count of the separate positions right? As in when you say there's more longs than shorts are you saying that the value of the longs is more than the shorts, not that say.. there's 2000 longs and 1500 shorts?
I found the funding history, but is there a page that tells the future funding? How did you find out it will be 0.0761%?

Edit: Found it, it is in the lower left corner at contract details, just in case another BitMEx noob like me is wondering :)
I have a few Iranian friends living in Europe. All extremely intelligent (doctors, dentist), cultured and extremely down to earth. I also understand that young people in Iran live by different rules to the older generation. To ask how they could ban crypto in a country where capital punishment is freely handed out is extremely brave.
> How can you ban crypto?

You make it illegal to buy and sell it.  Of course there will be black market...and about 95% less people buying it.
I can't beat a level 5.   Hes too powerful.
> I live in a different country than my parents and I think my own children will do the same in time

Do you happen to live in the EU?
Corporations aren't in the game of dumping tens of billions into a product that a monkey could copy.
> Well, if I can buy the stuff I want with crypto, I will use them. 

So you're being *paid* in crypto? Cause otherwise, you're not looking to use it as a currency, you're simply looking for alternative ways to liquidate your paper wealth without going to an exchange.
That's a fair point, but we're not dumping our whole stack to transfer to our bank to buy a sandwich or whatever. The hodlers, in a sum of all events sense, even when using bitpay our similar for sandwiches, ultimately apply far less downward pressure than other classic markets.
that's we are here, the gains are secondary
That would be too much work to convert them all, and also I don't want all my funds in BTC.  It usually works to just short BTC because the crypto mostly moves together.  I should have done that at the start of the year, but wasn't smart and energetic enough to do so.
Dush had some personality and did improve his content towards the end. I actually miss him. And plenty of bears offer up compelling arguments, fuckharvey even is rational, I just disagree. 

I'm bullish for the next 12 months, I'd stay so unless we prove this to be another long dcb, say a drop below $8200 or so. I'd actually prefer to see a small pullback here and test mid $9's to prove we have the stamina. 

However, if you are serious about the $10k, at least make a bet of it and not just offer to pay it out =) I won't be taking that bet, of course. 


At least dush was funny at times and loved him his BCASH, this fucking guy though contributes nothing.

Fo sho.
same could be said. the funding is not for long and short. one pays the other.
You are absolutely right and they certainly are the better choice during certain market conditions.
No one cares about my net worth, except you.

And my long term bullish or bearish view very rarely has any impact on my daytrading decisions.  Where I think BTC will likely be in 5 years has nearly zero relevance on where I choose to cover this current short position or my next long.
I am genuinely interested in understanding why my previous statement is wrong? 

Bitcoin cash is not an ICO, they literally forked from
Bitcoin, everyone RECEIVED free bch and some people are experimenting with other methods to scale bitcoin, how is that bad ?  
>ive seen 'hedge' used like this but i dont get it.  If you were to buy on the spot market, the 'hedge' would be short futures contracts, not long, wouldnt it?

Yes. When he said "hedging on futures", he was  talking about opening a short futures contract. He didn't say long...? 

If you buy bitcoin at spot right now, and hedge the value with a short quarterly futures contract, you will profit 4%+ from the spread upon settlement. 

>And i dont get the point of that hedge, its not an option play.

Futures are commonly used to hedge equity positions as well. Doesn't have to be an options play. When there's a premium on futures, your short profits from theta. When buying options, you do not. 
The point of the hedge is that you make 4% free money when the Futures expire.

Haha I actually had thoughts of moving to the casino for a while. But I think I will stick to what I am doing right now until I am able to manage the change. 

As for my stacks, yes I had to learn the lesson. Yet I am back with a clear strategy and a clear risk/reward outlook.
Yes if you have an active position, then proper way to manage it, is really to be glued to the market 24/7.   If you can go to fiat somehow, then at least you only miss out on potential profits, rather than losing your assets.  However, $ is $ so they are the same thing, to some degree.
lol it was a typo mate. It is definitely difficult at times to keep the balance between the both. 

However, since I started trading (back when a coin was about $350 in second quarter of 2015), I loved the idea and found it to be pretty interesting. Moreover, I learnt how the trading markets work and the basic fundamentals of economics. 

For me, trading is like venturing into new territories and learning new skills and adding them to my portfolio.

you're right I just didn't expect to be ridiculed when he asked people for thoughts.
perhaps hostile is too strong but its a weird way to respond when you make a post asking everyone for thoughts.  I guess he ment "thoughts that agree with me".
That could explain the high difference in price from kraken to bitfinex. Only shorts have funds. The only play now is to long, otherwise you can lose 1% when this calms down and prices level up. Just cant use margin. 
Yes, i'll do it later. It's easy. 
I could also add a note to the PMs to let users know that low effort bot posts should be a comment on this post. 
Bitmex doesn't lend usd or BTC. That's why the premium serves as an "effective funding rate." 
i think the fees eat you alive scalping, but people do do it.  I'm too slow, I'd get owned.

How can I delete a double posting? I seem to have 3 open positions of the same one. I think I messed up trying to update my SL.

BTW, I think this is pretty great. I had one comment but you already fixed it, being able to sort the positions.
Uhm... I think I'll need to see your chart
Correct. It does often have an impact, especially when the rate is high. Yesterday for example, the rate in favour of shorters was very high and there were a lot of shorts opened just before funding time to try and scalp the payment, but apparently some whale pumped the price to try and rekt the cheeky parasites before they got their payout. 
Overreacting to news. It's not that dramatic, the crypto ban. The government has bigger fish to fry and they will spearhead crypto if it makes them money and circumvent international sanctions. Which it will, so it's only a matter of time. Trust me, those mullahs have a certain way or lifestyle that is surprisingly expensive. 
Lol, dude here practically everything here but basic necessities is black market. We're getting use to it. I buy my weed, booze and Bitcoin with the same principal, no biggie :D. As I said we've become exceedingly good at hiding in plain sight. Remember, the government made it illigal to buy and hold USD too. How do you think that worked out?
In 3rd world countries people tend to buy things banned by their government, even if they were uninterested in the first place.
Tell that to 20th century bootleggers and speakeasy proprietors.
Japan. Parents from US.
that's my concern is that they'll all make their own networks but who'd use them?

I will accept crypto if someone is willing to pay them in return for my services, likewise I will spend crypto if someone accepts them. I will prioritize crypto over fiat purchase/compensation every time. That is my mindset, where I am, crypto is a hedge against depreciation of fiat money as well so it's a win win for me.
That's because they're not buying an entire dealership of Ferrari's with their stack (they're not even buying one).

If people were dumping market orders with hundreds of coins several times an hour, you *would* see the market drop.

Instead, people are literally only selling a few percent of their stack. In other words, *nobody is selling*. You can't lock in the value of your paper wealth without selling. Even Bitmex futures and swaps aren't actually locking in the value. It's locking in the *paper value* but not the actual value. It's a financial math trick and nothing more.

To lock in the value, you have to *sell* your coins. At some point, people are going to have to sell and when that happens, the market *will* implode if the fundamentals haven't caught up (which they aren't).

If the people who bought in before $2k (at least 4 million coins) sold even 10% of their holdings (400,000 coins), the market would probably drop 90% and be blackedout for *years*. Kobayashi dumped 32,000 coins and his selloff caused the market to drop around 67%. Now imagine if over 10x that was dumped into the market, just how fucked crypto would be.

That's not even the early buyers selling everything, just *10%* (~2.5% of all outstanding BTC). Eventually the whales will have to sell and once it does happen, there simply isn't enough cash value stored in crypto and almost no cashflow to absorb the excess volume.

It'll be a run on the exchanges and crypto will implode like a collapsing star into a blackhole.
We're here for the excitement?
There's always the next bubble/crash man
The bet is what I was referring to. I'm not MikeXBT--can't afford to be that charitable. I offered a $10,000 bet to our favorite post-mortem bear and he refused.

I'm willing to believe there might be months of relatively stagnant movement while the general public catches its breath, but most coins launch their full products in 2019. That will not be a bear year.
Fuckin nice!
I was. The comparisons I've seen lack substance.
What infrastructure? Fewer fortune 500 companies accept bitcoin today than they did back then. Hell, not even steam accepts it anymore. 
Yes and that's why we are now 20x above the price in 2014. But that doesn't mean the price action will be different.
2014: mt gox blows, we go down
2018: bitfinex/usdt blows, we go down

DIFFERENT.

It certainly seems to impact all the comments you make, which never contain any sort of reasonable explanation as to *why* Bitcoin is doomed, just assurances that it is, in fact, doomed.

Keep flaunting your **supposed** net worth though. Measuring dick sizes is so last year, amirite?
Take your strawman somewhere else. None of your whiny bcash rhetoric is relevant to my original reply. You're just looking for excuses to spam your crap.
Utter nonsense.

Can you honestly not grasp the concept of bitcoins original design?

Many transactions with low fees, as opposed to the Blockstream/Core re-design of very few transactions but with massive fees.

 
Going to requires watching the government 24/7. 
I have done that just recently. I noticed so many patterns, the threats and the opportunities. 

Being in a good position puts me to ease (my long from $8,000 - $8,900), and being in a bad position gives me the ability to reflect on my performance (my last short from $8,735 - $9,868 - Liquidated).
Shit I made the same typo. I meant 9.8.

Yes and no. Kraken and GDAX have been pretty close in price but GDAX doesn't offer margin
No, don't worry about that. I'm not sure what our long term solution will be but we can handle the moderation part of it. :)

How do you tolerate to live in an environment where weed, booze and bitcoin are outlawed? Do people not want to do away with the mullahs and the religious fanaticism?
Many of them died in jail.   And tell that to the tens of thousands of people rotting in prison now for selling heroin (or Bitcoin) where it was illegal.
Neat. Well I'll tell you, the rate at which people are living in a different country from which they grow up isn't really changing (unless you count the EU). In fact, it may actually be going *down* because of the rise in welfare states and the extreme difficultly in joining said states. For example, anyone can move to the UAE but gaining permanent residency (much less citizenship) is nearly impossible because of their immense social spending. They don't want more mouths to feed. However, just to live in the UAE, you have to spend a lot of money. So the cost to be an "outsider" is actually growing.

The same is said of many northern European countries and nations, the world over, are moving in said direction.
> crypto is a hedge against depreciation of fiat money as well so it's a win win for me

Um...what? I wish fiat depreciated, my money would get *more* valuable. Do you mean *inflation*?

I mean you're talking about all of this stuff and don't even know what it is this is suppose to even be about...

Well that's great for you, most people won't.

I'm not sure, in the excitement the English was a bit lost it seems, but I think that's what he was implying. 
And you can never go back in time to trade the last one properly.
Fundamentally things are way different but I don't think it really matters. The fundamentals easily support a massive increase in price, but how much? $3k would still be exorbitant compared to anything anyone expected 
Agree. There is nothing even remotely close to Gox now.
But you see, BTC is now a "store of value" and not a currency so.. /s
Rootstock, segwit, more inter ledger solutions etc. For me btc had never been about small payments but a digital money infrastructure 
ah yeah the bfx fud. come again when any exchange is even half as good
>never contain any sort of reasonable explanation as to why Bitcoin is doomed

I never said it was doomed.  Your simpleton assessment is not surprising, at this point.  I am long-term bearish, because of gov't regulation/intervention, plain and simple.  

If you think I am spamming to promote a bitcoin cash then how about you reply to my previous question? So that people reading this would not fall for my unfounded argument, go on.

I did not come here to give advices or convince people but to ask questions and share ideas 
Original design was... ill considered, at least without average people being able to afford what are now considered to be data centre scale nodes.

they have a funny way of showing it.. since i trade their CME and CFE bitcoin futures all day

I guess I'll close my shorts tomorrow and go long.. sheesh.






you asked for people's opinions and then act like a dick when they give them to you.  I don't get it.  Even your response right now you aren't being sincere so why say sorry?
Because I wasn't counting the ones where the price stayed the same for a week.  "omg liar!"
That's certainly my hope. 
Outlawed not unavailable, actually it's much easier to obtain these three here and faster. You just have to know who to ask. Also most of these we grow, brew and mine ourselves :D

People want them out and are fed up with the fanaticism. If the problem was just one government we would have sorted it long time ago. But the current government is backed by big boys such as Russia and China that use them as proxy against US interests in the region. Take this: for 50 years english was taught at our school as a second language. Now they are proposing Russian as a valid alternative.

And there’s tens of thousands more that take their place. What’s your point?
No depreciation. I'm from Iran. IRR to USD ration increased by 30% within 10 days. A large portion of my networth is in crypto. Not only I gain when crypto increases in value, but also when IRR depreciates. As a third world country, I really appreciate cryptocurrencies, because it frees me from the falling economy around me. 
I think it is just a difference in word usage. Inflation is a cause of fiat depreciation, which as you know is when something becomes worth less. Fiat inflation would mean the fiat is able to purchase more goods than previously. The issue is inflation of the price of goods causes the value of fiat to depreciate.
None of that matters at all because all that development translated to a reduction in transactions done per day and a reduction in the number of large stores that accept bitcoin, etc. Sure, if that development spurred non-speculative use it would have been great. But, even with that development, no one wants to actually use bitcoin.
almost too good

That's fair enough but I have yet to see you flesh that out to any reasonable degree. Sounds a bit FUDdy tbh, but to each their own.
I did not come here to entertain your stupid strawmen.
The notion that a user needs to run a non-mining observer node in order to use bitcoin is again utter nonsense.

The absolutely overwhelming majority of bitcoin users, we're talking sub 0.1%, dont actually run a non-mining observer node and that number will only ever decrease. It simply isn’t necessary and no amount of r/bitcoin censorship and propaganda can change that reality.

Users running non-mining observer nodes isn’t part of the original design, the Blockstream/Core re-design strikes again!

Furthermore the “data centre” scale non-mining observer nodes is additional bullshit as it has already been proven that even decent home computers of today can handle 1gb blocks. The business and services that benefit from non-mining observer nodes can certainly handle the expense of a decent PC.
> I assumed they were married because most people would have worn a full-face condom

LOL. Okay now you must send pics of her. Holy shit this is hilarious.
I'm not being sincere because there isn't any reason to apologize. Do you work at a day care for your day job?? You're being an emotional snowflake, and it's ridiculous. Now I'm being an asshole because you wont let it go, and it is irritating.
So crazy, but it makes sense as, from what I've read and watched, Iranians have historically been a liberal people (at least compared to their Arab neighbours). 

Gotcha. What a world. Here's hoping for the best.
Are you using tor/anonymity provider to access the internet? Is visiting sites like Reddit not subversive activity?
Weed, booze and bitcoin are legal in the US friend.
> And there’s tens of thousands more that take their place.

> and about 95% less people buying it.

Why don't you just buy gold instead?
> IRR to USD ration increased by 30% within 10 days

Except that's not depreciation of fiat, that's depreciation of the IRR against the USD. You're making a complex forex hedge and equating it to the (purported) purpose of bitcoin (i.e. to hedge against inflation of *all* fiat monies), which is flat out wrong.
Except he's not talking about fiat depreciation, he's talking about IRR depreciation, which is different. Crypto was made to take on *all* fiat, not just one country's fiat, a fiat which is arguably small on a world scale.
People love it when I pay them in Bitcoin, and they're always blown away by how easy it is as compared with bank transfers, credit cards, etc.
I can see how your engagement could easily be interpreted as snarky and less-than-excellent, but guys, we're all friends here, let's just hug it out, ok?

Also, you should have told your grocery bagger to take his existential angst out on someone else. Tell him to go stack boxes in the back room if he can't muster a half-sincere "you're welcome" like the rest of us!
yea, more pointless insults.  real nice.
Yes, iranians were never a subservient culture, thousands years of history makes a dense psychological barrier but they're very adaptable. We hope this whole mess somehow resolves itself too, no one likes the Iranian government here, not a single soul whose opinion matters.
Reddit is readily available, I use the app mostly. For most social medial such as Facebook, twitter and recently telegram I have to use a vpn or proxy service. No need to use tor. we're used to circumvent sanctions and censorship (from both the world and the government) and the government really doesn't care as long as you are not a political activist. It's complicated, technically it's illegal, but there is no written law but if you violate it... meh, no biggie. 
yeah heroin's got real demand problems.. All bans do is reduce supply.. not demand.. price goes up.  The inflated price is what reduces demand, moving the supply/demand curve to a non-optimal (albeit very inflated and profitable) point.




Not the same. Gold is also pegged to USD and is more expensive here compared to the global price. Holding more than 10,000 USD in cash (or Euro equivalent) was made illegal. Crypto is a life saver here and more people are warming up to it.
Expect that I can't hedge in Forex here, cryptocurrencies are much freely available cause I can buy it from the local miners. I'm explaining my own situation and how crypto in general is a superior choice when fiat money is failing. You can't possibly understand the situation if you're living in a first world country, I'm reminding you of one the main reasons that cryptos were created in the first place. It's working for me and people like me throughout the globe. Your turn may come soon.
Perhaps I had a wrong guess about what IRR was. I guessed it was his local country's fiat (but never fact checked).
Agreed.
We will agree to disagree on whether more people in China are buying BTC now than before all the regulations and bans enacted there.  You say there are more, or the same.  I say it is dramatically less.
Completely off topic but heroin probably does have demand problems. Fentanyl is used to replace heroin as it is more powerful, cheaper, less scarce and comes from China. Similar to advertising an altcoin compared to bitcoin...
So you're using crypto because it gets around the local laws (something I've said it's very good at doing)?
Your reply doesn't make much sense.

Gold is pegged to the USD? No, but I understand what you mean - it's valued in USD. That's good. It will protect you from the falling value of your currency vs the dollar. But the reason you put your savings in BTC and not gold is because gold didn't just go up 20x like BTC did and you need to justify your greed. And if gold is more expensive in Iran, then BTC is probably more expensive there too. 

Also didn't Iran also ban bitcoin? So by being in BTC you're breaking the law just as you would by holding more than $10,000 USD in cash. How do you plan on cashing out if BTC ever becomes a significant issue for your government?
I'm saying if I know China.. the chinese govt is buying the bitcoin themselves, OTC, using middlemen.

yes, it frees me from the tyranny of my government, wasn't that a reason crypto was made in the first place? I don't have to watch my hard earned savings turned into nothing. I'm in crypto, which I can easily cash out every where I go (e.g. when a war breaks out). With gold or fiat it's impractical. 
Nope, because gold is generally more expensive here compared to the global average because just as USD, it is heavily regulated by the government to prevent capital flight. I pay about 5% premium to buy BTC, but for gold it's about 25%. And if I can 10x my investment by purchasing BTC and taking the risk, I will do so. That does not mean I'm greedy, I take a risk. Not all of my net worth is in BTC. 

The government banned crypto trading for public or private financial insinuations. You can buy it OTC, from miners or from companies that deal in fintech. I don't plan to cash out soon, but if I want to, people are begging me right now to sell them BTC. Also there are hundreds of brokers that do this for you, in addition to family members that live abroad. It's always the same here, first they limit something to figure out how to manipulate it, then they get in the business themselves. Corrupt governments always want more money.
Ok again, we will agree to disagree on whether making it illegal to buy Bitcoin in a country lowers the amount of Bitcoin that is bought in that country or not.
Except your example is one government. You're effectively riding on the better economies of the people who are putting money into crypto. If they stop, then the value will become unhinged and crypto would be more expensive than gold as your hedge.

If the other government's went full tyrannical, then the crypto would end up going to zero because you'd run into external issues with using crypto itself. You see that exact problem in China and India, currently.
'in a country' or china? 

It's not just one government, every government is capable of doing so. The crash of 2008 was an example. Crypto is making a unified world economy, just as the internet is making a unified world culture. You get games of thrones references, we do too. Your economy is better, now we have the chance to peg ours to yours. If all governments turn full tyrannical, we'll have bigger problems than money. I think you're grasping at any argument available to you to prove your point. I live in a country that people kill you to prove their points. I know where that road leads. Try to reevaluate your believes from time to time, confirmation bias is especially hard to overcome. 
China is a country.  Again, we will agree to disagree about that.
Well I was obviously too subtle.  My point is that not all countries are identical.  So your statement is too broad, it's a gross generalization.  It may be true in England, but not Mexico, China, Nigeria, N. Korea, etc.  So I can't agree OR disagree with your statement anymore than 'the weather on the planet earth is good'.  Depends where you are.
  


Of course they are not identical, but generally, what I said is true.  But of course if you are talking about some undeveloped country in Africa where there is almost zero BTC buying, if they made it illegal, then there could, conceivably, be more buy volume in 5 years than there is now.  

However, in an country with a developed market, then making buying illegal will crush the buying demand.  That's what happened in China and what will happen in Iran and elsewhere.
I wasn't aware buying demand in china had been 'crushed'.
I go every year and I'd say 5 years ago when bitcoin was 'legal' no one even knew what it is, and now that its 'illegal' everyone does.

"A Nation of Laws, Not a Nation of the Rule of Law" 


Read what I wrote.  You don't compare to the demand from 5 years ago.  You take the demand a day before the ban and the day after.  And of course black market activity will increase after that, but to nowhere near what the demand was when there were legal channels available.
ah i got it, now that i know the rules, I'll use them to score some cheap coin.
