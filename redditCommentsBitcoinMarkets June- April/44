#New post: [\[Daily Discussion\] Saturday, April 21, 2018 →](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8dtgp5/daily_discussion_saturday_april_21_2018/)
That's it guys. Just lost everything I had, I was stupid, tried to make it all back and ended up making big mistakes and lost it all. I won't say how much it was but it was considerable for me (student) and I lost it because of greed.

Anyway hope nobody here makes the mistake I made, if you make a loss you make a loss. Don't worry, don't make trades based on emotion.
It looks like the log downtrend line from $19,800 has been breached today by a fair amount, and on the backs of a very pretty potential W bottom, the bottom's of which just barely touched horizontal resistance / support from November in the 6-7k range. 

If you've been flat or wondering when a good time to enter and strap-up for a summer full of gains was... it looks like that time is now.


if this is the real breakout this will go to 10k+ faster than anyone can ever imagine.
Closed my long at 8535.  

95% profit on this trade, keeping this open would become greedy.

One of my best trades so far as far as my trading stack is concerned. Completely negated all my losses from a month ago, and finally up again on this stack aswell (about 5%)

Will stay out of position with my trade stack for now. if we're still on this level by tommorow i will probably re-enter for the same portion.

Also, it's 420 today. Have a good one
I'm closing off my long from 7895 here, limit order went through at 8500 for 70% profit @ 10x leverage. I think this is a good place to take profits for longs for a few reasons:
 
* Log line around 8.6K which was my initial target but I've learned not to try and go for peaks and bottoms, take it about a $100 below/above what you actually think we're moving towards. Literally nobody has any idea what happens when we hit log resistance, its too big of a risk.

* [Orders flow moving more towards sell side for larger players (V>3 orders at -3.7 counters ratio) while retail shrimp remains undecided whether to trust these pumps](https://i.imgur.com/oDWaDQj.png)

* 1% price move is now either balanced or leaning toward sell side on Bitfinex and GDAX order book, short term r/r simply not worth it anymore. 

* Its a bit concerning that there hasn't been any substantial pullback since that move up from 6.8, the upward momentum hasn't been driven by any fundamental change or news as far as I can tell. Its been all whale pumps for the most part.

Been mostly shorting longer term positions for the last few months, I usually don't trade over this short a term (only 3 days for this trade) but since I don't plan to hold anything at this price level yet its been great fun trying to judge market sentiment moving more positive. I also decided to get a 3rd monitor recently and its actually quite a big help both for work related things and crypto trading, you have your main trading screen in front, vertical orientation for CryptoPanic and Cryptowatch on one screen for news and market overview, then another vertical orientation screen for TensorChart for order flow  and Excel for my order tracking. Putting in smaller amounts (around 0.5 BTC) really helps keep the stress down and keeps it fun. 

IMO the most rational thing to do here is simply stay out of position and see what happens. I'd only consider reentering long if we break up over 8.7K. If there was a build up of longs I'd see an incentive to go short but right now at only 30K outstanding and fairly split 53/47 ratio its not worth it.

Also one last thing, TensorChart added a "Large Trade Tracker" which basically allows you to graph bubbles on the chart with buys/sells with specified order size. Interesting to see how the orders stacked in during pumps, if they're evenly spaced like you can see how its  a laddered order by a single whale and how its targeted to break through specific historical order flow levels (8400 and 8460 in this last pump).

man, i'm so glad i didn't listen to all the bears in here the past few days...short at 7.5k, short at 7.7k, short at 8k, short at 8.5k.
[Large Trades Tracker chart over that last pump](https://i.imgur.com/r2G6xjd.png)

Each green bubble represents a 20+ BTC buy order. Its amazing how well coordinated these pumps are:

* They are concentrated to break through the resistances as shown by historical orderbook [(See A, B and C)](https://i.imgur.com/vHuG582.png) 

* Only 1 or no large buys (V>20) between these levels, instead you get a few even 10.00 BTC orders there to push to the next resistance, minimizing the buying pressure needed for maximum vertical movement

* There wasn't a single BTC >20 sell order in that entire range sitting anywhere, only one single sell order occured at 8870

Whether its an exchange doing this or some group of whales, they know what they're doing. 
Fun anecdote, I am in some BTC groups for noobs to get a feel for the  market. And the last days, for the first time in one month, questions about coinbase and how to buy started to pop up again. 

Might of course be a random occurence, but will be interesting to see fo reach day 8k holds if this will happen more often. During the crazy days of last year, it was maybe 20 posts per day and now it's 1-5 per week
In the short term, the strength of the rising wedge breakout is being tested relatively hard right now:

https://imgur.com/a/uK3ir5y

A strong push down here would break back into the formation and a break below $8,300 would push the market through the bottom.

Tread cautiously if you're planning to long here.

Edit: and we're back in the wedge.

Some people think this might be a Wyckoff distribution... I usually have a hard time telling the difference between that and re-accumulation though.
I sold more bitcoin than I could afford to lose.
Bye all, switched this morning from Long to Short!
Got rekt!
Anyone else seeing a LOT of friends/coworkers talking about crypto on their own now? A year ago that was unheard of, now everyone has heard of bitcoin.  I think the next bubble is going to be much bigger because of this (coupled with a higher capacity network this time around).
This is your daily reminder that the ATH resistance is a BAND, not a line in the sand. It's probably concentrated on the exact "line" (where that line falls changes depending on the time frame you draw it on) but overall anywhere from 8.5k-8.6k I would say we're "testing" it, maybe even extending it to 8.45k-8.65k.

Also, chart:  https://imgur.com/a/ddXGkep  
We've exactly wicked that log support (resistance) from Sept-6k. The confluence these two bands are providing is worth considering as you decide whether or not you think we break the ATH resistance here. Also of note is that we're above the top of the 4 hr BBands we've been riding for awhile.

All that said, buckle in if you're planning on watching the charts all day waiting for a break. This is a major long term decision point and we'll likely be wrestling with this resistance all day, it's not going to be resolved on a 15 min time scale and a breakdown wouldn't be TRULY reliable until 7.8k falls.

Disclaimer: In fiat from $8540. As I've said before, that doesn't mean I for sure think we won't break through or that I hope we don't. I would love to get stopped out. This is just a r/r trade.

Edit: How you interpret this is up to you, but longs currently outnumber shorts 30.5k : 26.6k as well.
[Ah, the 20k TL resistance](https://www.tradingview.com/x/diK7rfKn/). We meet again.
Wow. Got rekt again. 

3rd trade in a row I’ve taken a loss 

Should have trusted my gut and went long yesterday. Blah. 
John McAfee is celebrating.

Lord only knows how.
With all these shorts getting rekt if feels like maximum pain but in the other direction.
4/20/18 PM UPDATE. We just closed the 4H bar showing BTC firmly breaching through the ATH down channel. This is a great sign that we are exiting the bear market as we’ve known it for the past three months. While this doesn’t mean another bull run will immediately ensue, it does mean we are *likely* on a different market trajectory, (hopefully neutral or positive).

Here’s the [zoomed out, macro view](https://www.tradingview.com/x/6WGlI77v/).     
Here’s the [breached channel]( https://www.tradingview.com/x/z2sh5jnM/).     

Ideally we stay at least near or above this range, but some sideways movement for a while to codify this would be a healthy sign for the market.
Decided to repost this since the previous daily just finished.

I think going sideways here would be the best case scenario for the bulls. If we can stay above 8.2 for the next 24 hours I can imagine this will make another push up and I'll be closing my shorts then. I don't think it will take much, though, to start a wave of selling that would put us back under 8k.
I posted this about a month ago when comparing other crash cycles.  [It compares the last two bubbles once historic log trend was broken](https://www.tradingview.com/x/E1oofjDS/)
I'm sure everyone has noticed that we're getting dangerously close to making another attempt at the resistance from $20k.  In all other crash cycles, price has moved precipitously to the upside once this macro trend is broken.  It doesn't guarantee the end of the bear cycle (see 2014), but would signal a big shift in price direction (i.e. start buying the dips for a couple weeks)

4hr RSI hasn't dropped below 44 in this run which gives me some reticence but u/_chewtoy_ made an insightful observation which is that RSI is generally a more helpful indicator in range bound trading.  Because we broke up from [the wedge](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Ty1Og4TU/) I posted yesterday, we're not within any well defined range and only know the short term direction has been up.

I haven't made any leveraged trades since my full sell off at $16k (only accumulating), but just now moved BTC to Bitmex.  Will leverage long the break if it happens.

Safe trading!
The real battleground is truly 8.5K:

Weekly: https://imgur.com/r5cM6LI

Breaking and holding/closing above it on the weekly candle with volume is the difference between whether we're entering a new bull market or there's still greater bearish downside yet (if it fails, price will likely test 6.5 and break down as far as possibly 3.3k (S4)).  We are currently flush with MAJOR resistance line S3 which is basically the resistance level facing BTC on 1 hr (https://imgur.com/0fZDAWx) -- waiting to see if bullflag will confirm via break of 8526.

Edit: Daily-wise, bullish momentum for the time being as resistance R3 (8346) breached, we'll need to retest before breaking 8.5 on weekly chart though.  https://imgur.com/eAXoOfX

Edit2: We will likely range between 8300 and 8570 between now and closing of weekly candle IF we do not breach HOD today (via the current R4 breakout on 15 min chart that is still in play until end of day). -- See here: https://imgur.com/UcEk2HL - above R4 on 15 min chart means there is bullish pressure in the current day candle.  
[Looking like a pretty clear break.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/AXDjS9ob/)  Buy the dips boys

I exited my modest short at a small loss, and went into a large long position on the break.  Last trade I'll make for a bit

Enjoy the ride up
Whale Oil Beef Hooked

I did not expect this to happen, but I’m not complaining.

I hink the log trend line will be tested as support and will most likely hold. Obv my stops hit, so I’m done tradinng for today. Looks like the real deal to me
There goes 10mm
https://twitter.com/BitmexRekt/status/987458995408572416?s=20
So i closed my x75 long at 8560. ~60% profit. but not that much considering it was only 1% of my stack. and seems i closed way to early, but better then a liquidation i guess. 

Went long for 10% on 5x leverage just to retake a position. Pullback has to happen at some point, will add more once we do

Verry exciting days ahead, thats for sure
Stepping away from my existing long position for a moment, I will say that this is objectively the best shorting opportunity since $11,700. I'm not advising a short here necessarily, but there's a confluence of factors that would be foolish to ignore. 

1. The [log resistance line](https://imgur.com/a/eCaoN8K) is just overhead at around $8,660 on Stamp.

2. RSI is overbought on the 6h and prior to this sideways action between $8,400 and $8,600 was overbought on the 15m through 4h as well. (I will say that RSI becomes a bit less straightforward of an indicator when the market is in a strong trend...like now).

3. The pump from $8,200 to $8,560 has created potential bearish divergence on the 30m through the 12h in comparison to the Big Green Candle event. Price has made higher highs but RSI has made lower highs. (I admit that this is a fairly weak argument, since the Big Green Candle was so explosive that bearish divergence was almost inevitable if the market continued to push higher)

4. There's still hidden bearish divergence on the 1h through the 1d going back to the push from $7,300 to $9,200. RSI has made higher highs on those timeframes, but price has failed to make higher highs (so far).  

5. Bitmex futures are still trading below spot, despite the obvious bullish movement. At the very least, it could be said that futures traders are more eager to sell than futures buyers are to buy. 

The ingredients for a strong rejection and a continuation of the downtrend are most certainly all there. Or at the very least another trip down to $7,800. 

Again, not suggesting anybody short here, or even abandon a long from lower down in the $8,000s. Because even if there's a 70% chance this will break down and a 30% chance it will break up, I'm personally willing to miss out on existing profits from my long in exchange for a strong position should the trend line break.

But opening a fresh long in this range? That's loony toons, in my humble opinion.
I closed my long from 8.5 earlier out of fear. As I was having dinner I decided to re-open it, walked over to the computer and saw the new price. I just feel so dejected. I feel like I missed a great opportunity to make back some of my losses, maybe THE one. I know it's stupid, there will be plenty of other opportunities - does anyone else ever feel that way after missing out on a big move? 
Just came back from the gym and some guy had Ripple tattooed on his lower back. Im done. 

EDIT: My gym buddy just corrected me. I stand corrected, it said "Ripped". Im still done.
Once we reach 200k we should start seeing more Posts like "okay, maybe MAYBE there was a little tiny very small amount of upside to this"
I remember a post some months back, I believe from SloppySynapses (could be wrong tho), and he said not to put too much stock in the ATH downtrend like. 

He said no one is going to be getting excited if we breakthrough that line all the way down at 8.5k in April. Well, here we are, getting excited over it.

How our expectations have fallen!
Ok so all the guys saying they would get in after 8700, what are you doing
[deleted]
Alts are dropping in sats. Would seem to suggest that the spotlight has just shifted back to Bitcoin 🔥

Expecting a few more days of upside before we see a real thick pullback (10% or more). Closed half my long position at log resistance and now I’m looking to close the rest at low 9ks.




Maybe I *will* make money off my $18.5k BTC after all!
Based on my charts and overall feel of the market right now, one of the most interesting things to me is how accurate ETH is leading BTC movements during this run -- specifically I am watching *their respective behaviors at support and resistance pivot levels*.  BTC has been finding support and breaking resistance levels with ETH leading it.  ETH has already broken it's S3 major weekly resistance (502), and since doing so it is still holding well above this level.  I expect BTC to break it's own S3 resistance level (8525) convincingly as well.  We'll see how it plays out.

EDIT: https://imgur.com/feiS4wL - Top is ETH, Bottom is BTC - see that ETH has already defeated its S3 resistance and there is no serious resistance until upper 600s.  I expect BTC to follow with its own S3 break.

EDIT2: Yes, I wish I were in ETH this entire time.

EDIT3: ETH is struggling with a daily resistance line (R4 ($594) the bullish breakout extension level) which I think will cap the ability of BTC to move up beyond today's highs if it doesn't break. https://imgur.com/Rqb8dJK -  If it breaks R4 today, I expect a huge price movement in all crypto, particularly BTC.
- Again bounced off bottom of everybody's favorite wedge.
- Daily stoch RSI has been uncrossed (currently) but still is overbought.
- 6k-Sept log support turned resistance has now crossed the ATH resistance. I'll be removing it from my chart until (if) we cross that ATH resistance.
- Not seeing much major RSI divergence with any candles post BGD within the wedge or otherwise that hasn't already been noted. If we can hold up here for the next 20 minutes and move up in the next hour there'll be a very slight hidden bullish divergence with the last time we tested 8.2k on the hourly. But, like, super slight.
- Still somewhat expecting a Log ATH test sometime this weekend or early next week even if the wedge breaks down (could throw back up and then really fall of when it hits that resistance).
- If wedge breaks down and doesn't throw back we could just crash back to test 7.8k again, so worth being careful.
- I'm staying bought in until we test the Log ATH where I'll sell for risk management purposes (unless I get stopped out before that), followed by tight stops above the resistance.

Edit: Currently we've wicked out of the wedge as I had it drawn; I could slightly adjust the line or try to just ignore the wick. May have been some whale stop hunting.

There's still huge upward potential for adoption... I have no doubt that another bubble could be far greater than the one we witnessed.
4/20/18 AM UPDATE. We appear to have stayed within the immediate channel (the support line is bright green) from my last chart on [4/19/18]( https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8dbx5s/daily_discussion_thursday_april_19_2018/dxmuylf/). We will be encountering the ATH log resistance at ~ $8,550-$8,590 within the next 12 hours or so. Expect some market volatility during this time, possibly bringing us out of the immediate channel and into the broader channel (black lines) if that happens. 

If BTC reaches $8,750, that is *very bullish* as it means we will have decisively broken through the downward channel from ATH and are in reversal, creating a new channel.

Here’s the [updated view of the channel]( https://www.tradingview.com/x/t6m2rEoQ/).     
Here’s the [super zoomed in view]( https://www.tradingview.com/x/Y2bAKhGp/).     

If you are not already in the market, I would sit on the sidelines for the next several hours to see how this will develop. I’ll post another update later today as things develop.

**Important disclaimer:** This post is just a personal opinion and should not be considered investment, financial or legal advice.
short term bullish, liking the volume spike on gdax.  im seeing genuine fomo. 
Things are looking good here, but if you're a new trader try not to get caught in the mania. I can feel the euphoria creeping back in here and while yes, this could be start of something epic, we're not out of the woods yet.

Stay centered and remember to get some fresh air people. Best of luck (to the bears and the bulls).
Happy 4/20?


Pamp it
I'm bearish more than most, but short term this thing is going to 9k.
Can't help but feel like International Vegas is propping all of this up.
Daily RSI highest its been this year. I said shortly after the BGD appeared I would turn bullish if we could get above $8.5K, hold it and break above 60 RSI on the daily. Still need the daily to close above $8.5K but I guess I'm now bullish. Yay. Go bulls!

Edit: celebrated with a x100 yolo long @ $8759. So far so good haha (no lambo for me though - only 4000 contracts on it after leverage)
Oh god. I’m feeling the fomo. Anyone else feeling it? Do I pull the fomo trigger or not!!
[deleted]
All of the bulls most be feeling very confident right now. I personally would take profit right here. Then again, I'm never in profit so what do I know. 
Stops from my $2mm short at $8200 avg posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8dbx5s/z/dxnnsb4) have hit at $8600. Loss of 5%.

Edit: Corrected typo. Yes, I was short. 
[removed]
I'm out to fiat at 8540. Tight stops above 8650 to catch a breakthrough of that log ATH line.

Sitting just under the daily BBand, log ATH resistance, and RSI is oversold on 15m - 6 hr. The RSI thing is relatively minor - in a strong trend that wouldn't matter quite as much and not seeing any divergence (except hidden with the 11.8k high if we were to stop here).

I'm certainly not convinced this isn't going to break the resistance, but it's a small opportunity cost to sell here and buy back above it and I'll be in a great position if we fail.
We are approaching a point where the maximum pain meme may appear again. Letting my limit sells hit in this range. May buy the next retrace but not sure here in this environment. I still think we will dance around 8k for a while before we establish a longer trend.  Best of luck
Smoothies for everyone!

I'll be closing at $8900, my third and final price target for that multi-week long at $6950.  
Alts are all dropping ratio hard on the push, feels like it could be a really big one
Hmm, my sub 6k orders starting to look a bit lonely right now. Was the 2014 bulltrap to 700 also with violent moves like this, does anyone remember?
Amazing, I closed my short at 8940. My timing never ceases to amaze me. If I did literally the exact opposite of every trade I have made, I would be swimming in coins like Scrooge McDuck..
From an article by BitMEX CEO, Arthur Hayes, in the Crypto Digest newsletter today:   

>*”For those who thought merely sitting in a Telegram chat room, or reading /r/bitcoinmarkets was sufficient to generate mad gains, SFYL. What keeps traders coming back to the market is that hard work is actually rewarded. This is truly the only real free asset market globally. That should excite any student of the markets, and student one must be if you want to drive a Lambo and order trains of Dom P.”*

&nbsp;    
>*”P.S. If you don’t know what a train is, order one at the club, and watch your heart skip a beat when presented with the bill.”*  

&nbsp; 

Now, I have no idea why, but the thought of this man in some SE Asian bottle club, doing Jell-O shots off girls’ asses and ordering $5k trains of Dom P. in between checking the \#BitMEXRekt liquidation bot’s twitter feed on his phone just somehow sits right with me. All is as it should be in the Universe. 

God-bless capitalism. I love it.

2.5k btc market buy on bitfinex
I still have my bad feeling... But on the other hand is that not the signal for reversal. Thinking it's a suckers  rally etc 
I'm just waiting for that next big red candle so I can get back in. Preferably we correct back to 8250. I went to fiat last night thinking we would correct and woke up to a big green candle. I don't know how you guys do this shit : )
Time to bust out my post from 30 days ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/868row/daily_discussion_thursday_march_22_2018/dw44t34/
I believe the longer we linger this closely to the log trend line; the more likely it is that we will push through. It doesn’t seem like the buying pressure is natural here though.
Discouraged bear yet hopeful bull here.

I see a lot of posts about Google Trends being a lagging indicator. I thought I'd superimpose the weekly close price of Bitcoin with Google Trend values (from when it started being monitored) to illustrate a point: https://imgur.com/a/v1XFgpe

While it's true that it's not entirely clear whether Google Trends follow price or vice versa, it's also true that the two are highly correlated (and at times trends have even pre-empted price increases as was the case in mid-December). So it's hard for me to say that the trend data is useless in the context of a highly speculative asset. If you're curious on the correlation of this imperfect data set, r = 0.9 (0.95 before the post-January bear market).

Closing price seems to have decoupled from Google Trends a bit post-January. So where do we go from here when we revert to the mean? Will sentiment go back up, or price back down? Or will there be another reason for a price run-up separate from retail investors, like institutional investment?
Lots of double topping / attempts at the same highs across most coins so far.

Update, some have broken up past now.
I still think BTC will be fed by rotation of alts, this has yet to happen.  This is the next catalyst.
Long from 8100, took 75% profits at 8500 and added a bit for a 8300 CA. Thinking now of adding a bit more if it dips to high 8700s,  letting this ride and worst case take a small profit if it retraces lower than 8500 with a SL.

Position & strategy update.

Sept long ca 7900 has only one profit ladder left, 3% of the position remains to be claimed at 9150.  SL moved up to 8700.

Small June short had two ladder fills, only up to 8700, and I added one to it here at 8800, ca 8500.  The cost of the short is now ~10x the remaining cost of the long.  In hindsight if I was committed to this short, I should have laddered into upper 9000s, and I missed a better ca by missing that wick.  But as I said in previous post, I'd rather decide that upper part if we got there.

If closed now, the small short is at a loss for <25% of the profits made from the long since 8500.  No regrets.

I could double down the short and bring the ca within breakeven range.  Or I can just leave it be.  In either case I'll probably scale it out from 8700 and down.  Thinking a SL of 8900 at this point, which could perhaps terminate it prematurely but at this point I'd just let it go from the perspective of ending this whole set of trades in a decent state and starting fresh rather than risk losing any more at all and starting a chain reaction of fucking it up (like being tempted to set a limit to double down at 9100 and then we rocket)

Edit: fwiw, I had fallen asleep early tonight, and woke up to the above situation, glad I woke up but the setup went fine autonomously so that's nice to know.

Edit 2: [Coincidentally setting the peak of the mountain above the dungeon of capitulation as my profit target](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ccvku/daily_discussion_sunday_april_15_2018/dxf8iqd/) has worked out well, albeit with a delay.

Edit 3:  I noticed that there was a remainder on the long not in the ladder, so added to the long to put another TP rung at 9200, new ca is 8300.

The long will also double down just below 8800 if the limit hits, ca would become 8500.  The scalp adds possibility of 2 more rungs to the profit ladder at 9300 and 9400, but doesn't have a noticeable effect on the profit taking SL just below 8700, so it's an easy RR squeezing/optimizing the last out of this position.  (or overtrading, but anyway the math adds up fine after any possible scenario plays out)


If we go below the stop loss on the long, I'm guessing I'll be looking for the range of an appeasing dip to start building a new long.  Depending on what it looks like, I could even decide to shift the gravity of the ladder downward on the short's profit taking, if it isn't already stopped out.

I'm in it for the technology...

I'm really curious whether we're out of the woods or not. This feels like it takes a long time for it to be a mere bull trap.

Be it as it may the idea of 3k btc seems to be less and less probable each day. 
Good risk reward on shorting here. If it really does break out convincingly who cares about your loss from getting stopped out. Probably means some real bullish action is in for the coming weeks which means you can easily make back your losses. If the bearish scenario or less bullish but still bullish scenario comes to fruition (much more likely than super bull scenario), you will make a lot on a short here targeting 7.65k
Sold here as we're now [at point A of the chart I made 3 weeks ago](https://i.imgur.com/VRI9WsO.png). [Link to previous comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/87ycpl/daily_discussion_thursday_march_29_2018/dwi0v6b/). I'm thinking we're going to hard reject the ATH resistance line on this attempt and retest the $7k range (point B) once more before finally having the FOMO inducing breakout everyone is drooling over. Hopefully this isn't me just getting too greedy trying to maximize my stack before selling at my target >$10k zone (point C) in the next month or so.

You may notice that I only post a comment every few weeks or so. It's because most of you trade FAR too much. I used to be the same way when I started trading and was trading with margin. I always had to be in a position. That's the easiest way to lose money and make stupid emotional decisions which are usually bad trades. My advice: trade less, stick to the more obvious trades, and don't use high margin. 
At the risk of being horribly wrong:

I don’t think we will break the log trend line today. I highly doubt it. I’m not saying the bear market isn’t over... I’ve been saying the bottom is in since before that 1k candle. But we got here too quickly. If we do pump straight through the log trend line and off to 10k in a heartbeat, I’ll definitely be very surprised, but I don’t think it’s impossible.

I think it’s more likely that we get more sideways action, small bart down to 8300-ish and then consolidate in an ascending channel and hopefully push through the resistance in one big green candle from 8400-8450 up to 8600-8700.

That’s what I would like to see. After that we can get some upwards action as FOMO starts to come in, a few smaller dumps to test support levels and we should be on our way to 10k by early May.

I don’t want moon in a 1k candle, and if that’s what we get, I think a larger dump is all but guaranteed.
We touched the log trend line, only one BGC will end the bear market.
It feels like there is only two types of retail buyers right now:

1. Either they went long a few hundred dollars ago and are content to wait for the log line to break, as they don't mind losing a bit of profit compared to the potential gains if it does.
2. Either they shorted this or are on the sideline, and are waiting for the log line to break to re-enter.

So everybody is indecisive and that's the perfect playground for whales to move the market in big swings. You can also see it on the volume, which while not small is not on the same level than during the february bounce. 

Thus it is very difficult to take a position right now if you don't already have one. But as said by others I feel like the next big move is going to be decisive. Another market buy like this one and all the people that were waiting for the resistance to break will hop in again. Massive retail volume like this could easily pump this up to 9k and higher. 

On the technical side we're overbought on almost every time frame except for the 1d, but I feel like in bullish times like these it is the one that matters the most. Stoch RSI and BBANDS also have a little room for another pump. 

Unfortunately for me I'm on the sideline side and in a very uncomfortable situation right now. As I have a party tonight (yay social life) I won't be able to monitor this. I'm thinking of putting a stop buy of 8650+, which is i think I enough not to get stop hunted, with a target at 9100. Or I put a buy order at the ascending wedge previous resistance that should confirm as support, with a stop loss below it. 

Sorry for the long post, and probably not that informative, but I needed to vent!
Well, look at that...

The ascending wedge turned into an ascending channel.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/eqtM4GMk/
I could see a retrace to no lower than 8190, which has become a very strong support on the S1 4hr pivot point. If it gets there I plan on adding to existing long.  I doubt it happens today though since we're currently in prime breakout R4 pivot on the 15 min with a volume-BGD as confirmation (which implies a strong bullish buying pressure; when this happens I think of Mario getting the star that makes him invulnerable temporarily, a gravy train rest of the day) which is good till EOD before recalculation.  In other words, we should see 8600 before 8190.

Closed my short for a marginal mini loss. Out of position untill we get a clear direction. 
For some time after the 11.7 fall, asia was dumping really hard on red and buying on dcb greens, then somewhere around the 9.2k dcb it stopped and nothing happened at the time they were awake, have they become irrelevant because bans etc. or did they just panic sell everything?
Nice really glad I closed my long earlier.
Which of you was this then? https://twitter.com/BitmexRekt/status/987458995408572416
The buy pressure is absolutely real. I think the runup from 6500 to 7900 was awesome was long at 6550 and bought a shit ton of crypto with fiat too, best trade i've ever made so I feel good. Now the question is where is this going before we start falling back? I feel like taking profits right now is probably a good idea in my brain but my heart says to stay because people are talking about crypto again in a positive way. 
Just not stopping!  Break out the over 9000 memes I guess.  
bought at 8.7 only because others are buying. Alts are too high. Bitcoin must catch up.
Lets do a do-over off 2017 boiiz
Can everyone please fuck off with the whole bear vs bull tribalism? You sound like a bunch of morons. 

Any trader worth their salt has no issue going between going long or short; they're both equally worthwhile things to do if you're wanting to make money. If you're either perma bull or bear you're an idiot, doubly so if all you do is sit here and throw mud at the opposing side. 

Get your shit together. 
Large scale ascending wedge is forming.
Opened a short here at $8510. Get ready for the pump!
Many of the comments on this thread are parading a victory. Not sure why. Yes, we went up 100 bucks, but that doesn’t mean anything just yet. Why in god’s name would anyone leverage up right here or anywhere near here with a 5x+ all-in long?

Maybe this is the reversal, if so: great!

But why not wait for confirmation first. Don’t get rekt on the way there.

All the overconfident bulls look foolish. Not saying you’re wrong, just saying you’re wreckless (rektless, amirite)
Upvote if you remember when $420 was resistance. 
went long again on 8480. 1% of my trading stack on a ~~100x leverage. Liq at 8440.~~ 

Just a fun trade to see if it can hold the night.

Edit: lowered leverage to 75x
I added to my 25x leverage long yesterday. Now 20% invested with my trading stack. Avg entry @ 8220

No stops, Liq below 7950. Pretty convinced we're not falling back there anytime soon
I am sitting on a nice double digit profit% on 4/20. 

No, I am not done yet, not closing my long, rather I will roll a fat and long one.
Finally broke out. Assuming no bear whales ruin the party this pump has many legs. If no one stops it under $10,000 then I see $12,000-$13,000
BTC is entering and exiting this wedge so many times its starting to look like a porn movie. All is missing is the happy ending
Bot trading price action last month is like a "Black Mirror" nightmare. Season 01 finale this weekend. Also starring, The Simpsons.

In all seriousness, my faith in a semi-organic crypto market was maybe an illusion to begin with, but now it is shattered. With the current lack of both volume and conviction it doesn't make any sense for this sad state of BTC/USD to cross the log line and "confirm bull". Still, it probaly will since shorts aren't going to liquidate themselves... Would also not be surprised if exchanges are in on this to artificially keep crypto in an uptrend and collect the fees they got used to around Christmas.


EDIT: HERE WE GO
Tasty. Log resistance looking good to be tested over the weekend.
wow wow wow
Come on 9600! I want to change my flair! 
So I’ve taken 3 pretty big losses in my last 3 trades. 

What do you guys recommend I do? Take a step back from the market and look for a great entry point?

I feel like right here is a little iffy... every time we jump into a new “ Hundreds “ range, we go in neutral until someone pulls the trigger either way. 

This definitely isn’t easy to trade considering most T.A right now is invalid, especially for a beginner. 

Yet, it sucks being on the side lines. 

Edit: It feels extremely weird to long after a 23% run up
Does anyone else use pivot points as their primary TA strategy? I feel like this sub is otherwise completely devoid of this commentary.  It works because of mean reversion, so support levels and resistance levels are automatically calculated for you and you trade the levels which takes a lot of the guess work from drawing diagonals out of the way.  It also gives you a very natural and visual way to evaluate trades from a risk/reward standpoint.
A little while ago someone posted a tool that showed MACD at multiple time scales using a color bar beneath the chart. Does anyone remember who that was or if its a standard tool? I was kind of interested in checking it out more.
Bad weekend for me to go out of town. I'll be able to check and reset positions once or twice late tonight and tomorrow. Short still open from 8515, gonna set a stop on it at 8600 or so and then a buy order at 8750 or so. Alernatively just thinking about not setting any buys at all; even though it's a pretty critical juncture and I might miss the initial 10% of a burst up, which would suck, it would also suck to have orders wicked, or set them higher only to be faked out, and not be able to do anything about it.
I believe /u/chewtoy_ has been long since 8100~.  Questioning why so many people decided to short today.  I really tried to keep up with the sentiment in here and all day it was very bearish.  I think Korea woke up and broke one off in a few people...
Bitmex is unstable. My stop loss triggered waaay to late, I had do manually market close when the system would let me, after it eased up a bit at the top of the first green dildo on the 30 min. I don't understand why they don't upgrade. Sure money isn't the problem
I am still marvelling at the fact that june futures are *still* behind spot. Wtf? 
Does anyone find the lack of media attention on the Polish 370m USD seizure fishy? No real market reaction either. Not to sound like a conspiracy theorist but if they were actively postponing the fud for the right time, they seem to have successfully done so. 

Bitfinexed also shut up a few days before the seizure. 
If you reversed the charts I would be quite bearish
Some might call me a permabull. I like to think that I'm simply looking at a longer timeframe. One that suggests this is a mere correction in a grander bubble yet to complete.

This feels like the calm before another gigantic dildo of the green variety. If this is such an obvious short opportunity, why isn't the price collapsing under the weight of bears scrambling for fiat?

Currently at an ICO Summit in Santa Monica. There are more stuffed shirt banker types here than you would ever imagine. This money is coming in, and it's coming in fast. Whether or not you can see it is an entirely different matter.

Good luck out there. See you at $10k.
https://www.tradingview.com/x/re1hLNbj/

Is anyone concerned about this ascending wedge?

There doesn't seem to be any volume between pumps either.

I also can't imagine there's any FOMO outside of coiners since the Christmas Crash was only a few months ago and, no doubt, lots of general public ended up with expensive coins.

Given the above, I'm struggling to gain confidence that these rises will hold. Is this overly cautious or do I need to just FOMO in?
Look at that fucking dildo
Bulls have one push left in this wave.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/xXyBXW1Q/

This completes the first wave on our medium-term bullish scenario

https://www.tradingview.com/x/2EjKg3zW/

Alternatively, bears reject this move at the log trend, where we are, and move the price down. That will probably look more like a double top if it happens. The bear case reads as slightly less likely to me because our volume is low and this should be a range where bears are confidently selling into the market.
FOMO in...do it. 
1d RSI haven't been this high since ATH. Brain says take profit, but the body wants more.
So, the breakout seems to be more legit than what we thought. But as I still dont feel like were completly out of the woods. Were still in this [ascending wedge](https://www.tradingview.com/x/LEV7IGdl) and could be in for a huge drop, or atleast out and into a ascending channel at some point. Will consider a short if the wedge plays out at 9K ish in a few days.

jesus christ. wtf is going on?
Stop loss triggered, small loss here but I'm good.  
Gonna wait for a dip and go long.
I take it we are no longer in a crash downtrend and are officially in recovery?
Seems most of you are perma bears.. Kind of making me lose respect for some of you on here - granted, I’m just a lurker on this sub. You guys have been calling bull trap over and over and over again. Then I see breaking through 8.5k would be a bullish signal, yet here many of you are, now saying this is bearish and to expect 6k still.. At what point do you guys calling 6k admit you were wrong? 
Short at 8540 5x leverage, stop loss at 8720. Lost a little bit from my short yesterday that I opened and closed this morning at 8340. I guess you can say that I’m chasing a loss but I’m still skeptical of this run.


Edit: Just got Rekt so hard. I’m done for awhile. Luckily, I’m still long with my cold storage. SomeAverageGuy was the catalyst to the bull market, your welcome everyone
Weekend is going to be very interesting.

I am thinking there will be a few more pumps from here onwards with a little dump on Sunday.

Either way very interesting at the moment and the global marketcap is increasing hard which is good.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/CvXPFPP2/

Just my 2 cents as usual. 
It really doesn't want to fall out of that rising wedge... *yet*.
Today's dinner will either be a feast or a bowl of gruel. Both seems equally likely right now...
8.4k broken with good volume... lets see what next..
You got 5 seconds, brothers and sisters, to make a decision! KICK OUT THE JAMS
I have my ATH downtrend line at 8525.  Others?
Sept long from 7900 has taken more laddered profits, only 20% of the position remains.  All the high gravity ones are sold now and it's just sprinkles every hundred from 8600 to 9200. SL moved up to 8150.  I'm not planning on adding to the position here, probably won't either if we drop.  A new long could be started hundreds below or above here.

June short has filled up more on a few ladders, ca 8315. Sadly it was missing one rung in the ladder that would have been wicked that I failed to replace during the typical bitmex unavailable shitshow, so the ca is not as optimal as possible by one notch.  Profit taking on this is spread every hundred from 8200 down to 7800.

The june short unrealized loss is currently 20% as large as the sept unrealized gain.  I haven't calculated exactly where I would need to give up on the short before it starts to take away from already realized gains on the long, but not worried about that.  If its ca gets between 8500 and 9000, and we are at 9000, and my long is already fully cashed out, I could still see holding onto this in the red for a little bit.  But will see about that later.

Edit: 2x leverage.  30% of trading stack currently allocated. (was more than 40% before the long TPs today)
Last night I scaled my short down significantly at 8310 after adding at 8380, but about 40% remained, which was stopped out at 8410 this morning on the BGC. I also closed my June futures long from 8080 (chewy follow) at 8330 and reopened at 8290 for a small scalp. And just now I shorted the exact amount of my long at 8518 to lock in profits. Not looking to close my long unless this clearly reverses. We're right under our downtrend, as everyone is aware: https://www.tradingview.com/x/e3xKLE4S/
Can someone link me to a good post or website where all those phrases like RSI and log-line are explained?
Should i close my big long  from 7.3k or wait for this to go further, held this position for like 3 weeks and racked in heaps of funding haha

Edit: i have had stop limits in place after the BGD, at trigger-7700-limit 7600. for if this "breakout" is invalidated allowing me to reenter lower, or reenter with profits
is it just me or are we forming a ascending triangle on daily (log scale)? about to touch the top
We are back inside our huge MACD coil on the 4 hour.  When we breached the lower line twice last month they were great indicators to go long. Was the BGD jump out of it a signal to go short?

Failure swing shaping up on the 1 hr: https://imgur.com/a/NiSCO2R

I'd be very hesitant to follow a 1 hr signal atm if I wasn't already short and it hasn't even confirmed yet (would have to maintain this through the whole hour - so could easily go either way). Something minor to consider though.
Can someone please explain why there is so much stock placed on the logarithmic resistance line, how is it more significant than a linear one?
Where are you guys trading? I have my stash that I won't touch but this recent run up got me interested in trying out a bit of trading. What's most conventient way to trade on mobile?

Is it even worth it to do it on mobile or should wait until I get home on sunday?
The BCH pair is up almost 50&#37; over the past 3 days and the BCH/USD volume has gone parabolic. Too late to get in on the pump?
[deleted]
Wrote earlier that I was pretty sure we'd be over 9k, but was thinking it would happen in a few days, not a few hours.
Man it's so hard to not think about trades you almost pulled the trigger on...

Had been thinking about going 5x short on XRP futures when they peaked an hour ago, would be up a toooon right now... 

It's all good though since if I actually pulled the trigger on every trade I wanted to make I'd probably be homeless by now
Can someone explain the difference between linear and logarithmic scale and when each one should be used? Why does BTC follow log better?
Hidden buy wall at 8850?

Edit: Gone now
Rekt. So much for TA today boys!

Opening a small short here! @8350 \- Stops @ 8550

Why?

\- sRSI Showed a crossing which resulted always into a reversal in the past

\- Google Trends still declining

\- Alts hyped too much already

\- Order books look bearish \(a lot need to be bought to get higher\)

My targt is around 7.5k \(potential for large scale iHS is there\)
I dont trust this pump. wanted to short yesterday, want to short even more today but if i entered yesterday then i would have been stopped out. this means my original thesis was wrong so sitting it out today. still believe we need to slow down to 7k-ish but still dont mind it going up lol.

Either way, im sitting it out, day off ;)
Who now doesn't think $6k was the bottom? 
Textbook bull flag with volume profile to match on most time frames.  
Volume-BGD confirming upward price movement and following small price descent on decreasing volume.  Should breakout upwards past 8.5 today, working on R1 resistance which aligns with the strong weekly resistance.  If alts weaken, I still believe this should propel BTC past this resistance instead of wick at it.

Opening a small short here, scaling up to 8700, SL 8800
Short from here til 8700. Overbought on 12hr on down and obviously meeting the resistance we're all well aware of. Think our bullwhale just icarus'd themselves. edit: it's also intersecting with the old log support turned resistance and when zoomed out close enough to form a potential double-top. Just can't pass this up.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/SkCOsmTr/
      Opened a short yesterday at 8240, added to it last night at 8390. My stop loss was set at 8525. Closed it this morning at 8350 when I saw the incoming bull. Lost around 1%. Not to bummed about it. Will stop shorting Bartcoin
Why is the price always jumping up like that? I've never seen that before.
For those who have been around longer, I have a question. I kept hearing from many people that when we reach the bottom, we'll know, because the price will stagnate for a long time before it starts to slowly gain interest and eventually start up a new bull run.

My question is, do true reversals generally end with a sharp jump and massive FOMO, or is bitcoin just being bitcoin? I'm loving my gains from the recent pumps, but I'm still a bit leery about entering a leveraged long anytime soon. Maybe it's just flashbacks from the past fakeouts making me irrationally careful, but I can't shake the feeling there is a correction coming, even if it's not a massive one.
Bulls, do not count your chickens. 

Also, The moment is exciting, but try to keep it contained to one top level comment.
[removed]
Should be relatively thin air between here and $9,200. 

I'd expect support at $8,300 to $8,200 to hold on any potential pullback prior to $9,200. 

If you are out of position, resist the urge to fomo. Chasing rallies is a very good way to lose money. 
https://imgur.com/a/gjadey6

We're finally seeing some action on the weekly chart.  This morning we broke through the upper trend line.  I have little doubt that this is the beginning of something spectacular.  It took us 19 weeks to see bottom which translates into a sufficient amount of time for the price consolidation.  The week hands have been relieved.  The ignorant hands hold shorts.  This combination will be the fuel to take us into the stratosphere. 

edit.  singular vs plural
I think we're genuinely setting a good support here, over $8200. The highest support we have right now is $8000. If $8000 doesnt hold if tested, I've got my eyes on $7500.
This new EU regulation FUD, came just in time for the resistance.

Not saying its a conspiracy but if we dump now then it can't just be a coincidence. 
I have the house of cards or putting sticks of wood on top of each other feeling. It feels good and stable, but just the last straw to break this big candles is incoming and everything will fall down to 8200 :D 
Back in Tether as I'm not prepared to give up the last of my nine lives. Seems awfully close to the downward resistance and I'm scared, quite frankly.
If it makes it, I'll upvote the bitcoin rally thing. But only this time.
The last four biggest volume candles on the daily chart (one red on 9th April and then three green) each happened between 10:00 and 11:00 UTC.

I guess the same guy/entity will let us know our fate around that time tomorrow or Sunday lol. Since we've had three greens in a row, it seems only fitting the next one is red (or perhaps another green one to kick us up towards $9K?)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJOVUF-HaDw  :)
y'all ready for some fomo?

Keep in mind, at the very least Bitcoin often comes back down to retest resistance lines it recently broke (talking about the ATH through 17.5k DCB downtrend line that just got solidly punctured).
God I'm happy I closed my short lol
You can tell it's going full retard when alt's are losing value in their USDT pairings.
Really disappointed in myself. Was 80% fiat when the rally started. Had no stops in place because I'd "made up my mind" that it was going down, then spent 5 minutes trying to catch the damned knife and needlessly cost myself ~$200 in the process. 

Gonna go mix a drink and lick my wounds.
25x long from 8750. Liquidation @ 8450. No SL. 

Off to sleep. 


Alts weakening let's see how well BTC holds up, should be steady or make gains while the ratios level out.

Top candidate for rotation is BCH to BTC.  IMO.

Edit: Caveat is if this new bull market is structurally different than the last bull market with alts being much more decoupled now than I am realizing.
Now the big question if the 07 utc pump comes or not... I expect some profit taking for alts very soon, a lot of them almost doubled the last weeks 
got out from my long.. while this reminds me a lot about the slow rise in spring last year,, i think this is not sustainable for much longer. either pump now and dump hard later, or minor dump now and pump later. we still have room to go down $500 without it being a disaster
I have a bad feeling about today, all markets has been going up to well the last weeks. If a bigger move downwards come, I assume a lot of people will try to sell in profit while they can 
Jeez, another BGD?  I'm almost getting to the point where I'll believe the market is finally turning around.

Not letting my guard down yet though, I won't be 100% comfortable until we climb through 12k.  I've been traumatized.
I once lost my full trading stack cuz I didn't use a stop loss lol. Today, I'm proud to say I only lost a few % because I actually stopped myself out at 8700 (basically just lost my gains from the past week of scalping). Now I'm going to go get drunk & stay in my hedge short until there is a good entry point. 
The is now a bulls sub, let the bulls run free. I will go first, $35k before 31st Dec 2018. Speak freely, no need to lurk and quietly cry everytime a sub 6k prediction is made on here.
Scaling out more small sells during this little pump. This thing is just asking to get smacked down at this point. 
Potential cup with handle pattern on the 4H with the handle being painted as of writing. 

No side is able to push the price yet. Bulls can't follow through because there's a constant lack of bid support to go with every price increase. Profit taking from every bull break pushes the price back down. People on the sidelines are ready to pick sides any hour.

Will be looking closely at the next 24 hours. Ideally in a bullish case for me, there's further sideways or small selloffs with a descending volume profile to shake out the last few sellers and then there's a bull break to test log resistance.

The second scenario I'm looking at it a short term bearish one where bulls constantly fail to keep up the bid support and bears gaining short term momentum and manages to drop Bitcoin below the channel upwards and retest our local low.

Edit: Closed half of my long 8550 on Bitmex. Let's see if this thing can push beyond log resistance.

It is the rapidly declining volume I see that is most concerning as it indicates to me that there is really not that much conviction in the slow-steady rise over the past 10 days. And now that we are heading into the weekend might there be a real threat that a few trades end up putting downward pressure to see BTC correct hard? 
I am not saying this is organic growth but we've had no silly candles for days, so it could be, right?
Looks prime for takeoff or one of the most admirable fakeout ever.
Wow look at the amount and size of shorts liquidated on 'Mex... :O
There is a verticle gap on the 3 minute candles on bfx.  I have never seen anything like that.  We went from 8400's into the 8500's as if there were not a single seller in that range

Edit: filled in now with red
A day of chart watching I guess... If it blows through this line i'm expecting a rally. 
So, the 12h chart I'm trading didn't hesitate to pull away from the kumo after all. Further upside looks like it's on the cards also according to the fib retracement levels. This means to me that resistance at 9k, 9.5k (both psychological) and the next major fib line just below 9.75k 

12h: https://www.tradingview.com/x/Ug79E8yS

Had a few sells fill earlier (my ca spot is 7.9k, ca swaps 8k) with a few to go. Downside scenario at this stage is a sustained drop back below the fib line we just crossed. A look back at the lagging chikou span on the 12h show this to be a real possibility.

Main target here otherwise is the daily kumo window currently around 8.9k. Three days before it closes. 
Looks like we're also fighting the old log support turned resistance line from Sept low through 6k
Decision time any minute now... Bullflag being "cornered" by the upper channel line that turned support \(Bitfinex\). Cautiously optimistic ;\-\)

For those who indicate that we should be watching the long term trend line and are much better with TA than myself. Do you have any opinions on The Chart Guys perspective that it is over hyped? Curious on opinions since it is referenced here so often.

OK, I put in a small short at 8520. Crypto and RSI rarely lies. Would close if 8700 keeps for 4h or more maybe. 
We broke through $8200.

Interestingly, baisc TA says that the price target for this ascending ~~wedge~~ triangle would be 10k. Of course if this results in a BGD there would be massive resistance at 9.2k, and it could end in a false break out and a slow down trend above the log line just like in 2014. 

EDIT: wrong word
Seriously? WTF is with the fucking futures being *below* the spot?

If all of you people think it's going to go up *why* is the interest rate *still* negative?
So far this is looking nearly exactly the same as our last attempt at 11.7k to leave the log downtrend. Going with a small short here with S/L at 8700. Although it's highly probable i get stopped out, it just feels the right thing to do.

Google trends for terms like "Bitcoin" and "Buy Bitcoin" isn't going up along with the number of transactions in the blockchain. So, my guess is that there isn't new investors coming, all the money that is pumping the price is from people who sold during the bearish swing from 20k, and is beginning to think the bear market could be over.

As well as the longer term candles I like to watch the 15 minutes and there's a lot more chop in the last couple of days vs the steady upwards trend of the last week.

Whatever that might indicate.

Edit - I see it as buyers buckling with indecision where they were happy to ride it up. Now it's near log it's a different story.
The 1 hour MACD (12, 26, close, 9) looks very interesting. Both lines are basically flat around 40, and have been there for the last day or so.


Very curious to see what will happen.



Edit: Looks like we are breaking down from the rising wedge that we have been in. Was wondering when that would happen.
Does anybody else have the wedge breaking down as well?

https://www.tradingview.com/x/QaACYWXr/

It doesn't seem to have a lot of effect though?

EDIT: I guess I should draw it like this

https://www.tradingview.com/x/O62DdaX1/
Feeling crazy today, have gathered some courage to enter a short, with stops above 8700 to see if we break down. I think / feel like we atleast should breakdown and retest support before a breakout. Also if we should breakdown it kindof now or never so, here goes nothing.
if i'm bearish, i wouldn't jump on this one just yet. i'd wait for the red candles to appear before joining the party. i guess that's why we're approaching 8600 right now, 'coz every bear is waiting on everyone else's. hope we reach 10k before any big move down.
Hot tip, if you look at the BCH charts you will see which way BTC is headed.

It seems to move a few secs before BTC.

Probably less resistance on that.

The last 5 push ups on BTC have trailed behind BCH.
Should I close my small underwater short or leave it open?
Godammit bitcoin , i wasnt being serious with this : 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/VMwesVDz/
Notice how google trends for "bitcoin" and "buy bitcoin" is not going up? In fact, "bitcoin" is going down. The pump is not attracting any new entrants. Here is the cause of the pump:

1. Poland announced a "400 milllion confiscation" of funds from a "virtual currency exchange" that banked at the exact same bank Bitfinex held their funds.

2. Bitfinex said they will make an official announcement the next day to clarify they are not the exchange. This announcement never came.

3. Instead, the next day they reduced the capitalization requirement on their exchange from $10k to $1k and added 12 new altcoins to their platform

4. Several days later, the BGD was initiated on Bitfinex which leads all the exchanges.

My theory is that Bitfinex needs FOMO. 1) People don't request fiat during FOMO which is important since one of its primary bank accounts is now confiscated 2) Bitfinex can margin hunt its own traders, which the margin hunting games really began in full force after the April 6th bank account seizure. This is to recoup the money to balance its books 3) Using tether they can bull the shit coins which are low liquidity in hopes of making lots of money like they did during the 2017 run up.

Basically, these are attempts by Bitfinex to stay functionally solvent given that one of their primary bank accounts were seized. The issue is that unless new users come in, they can't sell back all the crypto they just bought on their own platform and via tether.

So, what is the winning move? Bitfinex will continue the pump until it creates FOMO. They have no other choice. They can't just stop it now because they will have worsened their solvency prospects. So, their only move is to continue the pump and pray. Once it becomes too insane of course the cat is out of the bag and there will be a lot of bag holders.
Can a bear tell me we’re still in a downtrend so i can not believe them again
Bull flag just broke up, volume BGD to confirm; MACD turning soon.  Edit: Observing 8525 resistance level, will be a touch cookie to crack; if the flag fails it will be obvious here.

At the moment it feels like we are building this breakout like a house of cards, i feels so fragile. But also the dangerous hopium are beeing passed around convincing bears that bull is the way to go. I can take a 5% loss with my x3 short and just open a long if we breakout
Oh man, if he’s right...

Again

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/YRZvdurN-The-target-of-current-bubble-lays-between-40k-and-110k/
It seems we are breaking up. Again, I don't think we are out of the woods yet. Someone just market bought 1.5k coins on finex so this pump simply could just be a fat finger. Furthermore, going up without first establishing support just makes the drop harder so while this pump could bring us over 9k again we could easily see sub 8k again if we first don't establish some kind of support. I will continue to short this.
Good morning from the States, gents. It looks like the bulls still have some work to do getting past the ATH log resistance, but we have gone above the 50SMA on the 1D, which was a big hurdle. 

Ideal scenario would be to consolidate for several hours and hope that the Asian markets wake up ready to push this thing up higher.  I'm currently 100% Bitcoin and have a SL at 8290. Hopefully it's time to ride the wave up for a bit.

Good luck to all.
Nice pump from North Korea news. Kim Jong Un did a good thing. Asian markets will moon and we all know what that means...
BTC is losing ground to ETH with every little pump since the bottom. I’m not bashing BTC at all. I’ve been trading BTC before alts were created. This is just the first time I’m seeing a legitimate shift. 

I expect downvotes because this is BTCmarkets but all I have to say is that is a fact. The numbers don’t lie. 
I'm taking some profits on alts.

Two most probable cases: 

* BTC dumps as we do not manage to break through long term risistance. Alts will pull back harder

* BTC breaks through resistance and start rallying. People will take profits on alts and move back into BTC

Third option: 

* we go sideways through resistance. This would be bullish for alts, I guess, but I'll be happy with my profits. I consider this the least likely option, though.
Gah, my gut feeling is screaming bull trap up to the log resistance, but the buying pressure seems somewhat legitimate. I feel like this time it's more transaction volume of smaller amounts, compared to the highly suspicious constant 20+ btc chunk buys at 11.7k last time around. 

Then again, the large momentous pumps are also suspicious but could indicate whales have finished accumulating and are now slowly forcing a bull run again. 

I'm excited to see what happens when we hit resistance again.
I want to make sure jealousy isn't clouding my thought (am 80% in BTC). I think this bull rall would be more sustainable if every alt/token's price wasn't increasing at and even faster rate. I was beginning to get comfortable with Alt prices (still overvalued but not 100x overvalued), but with them mooning, I feel like significant reckoning will still have to occur.
Rising wedge on daily confirmed if we don’t make a higher high from here. Good spot to hedge. 
we broke the critical horizontal resistance from the last bull run

Anyone have the chart that compared 2017/2018 Bitcoin with a previous bubble - might have been NASDAQ or 2013/2014 bitcoin. It highlighted the big green candle from the recent short squeeze that both had in common
[deleted]
The log resistance will soon be gone with the winds. I am heading to 10K.
Limit sold 50% of my stack at ~8500. I'm not sure we'll break through the log resistance without another short (hopefully) trip down to the 7800 range and I think it'll happen pretty soon. Bollinger Bands are tightening on the 15M. RSI is still quite overbought on the 30M and higher. Some retracement could do us good, and if it continues to bang its head against the log trend ceiling; well, we know what happened last time.

I have stops set for 8650 if we break up and 8350if we break down.
Just curious, how many Long here are 1x Long? Because you'd have to really be atleast 2x Long to 'be in a position' and be 'making profit' without the increase in leverage, it's essentially sitting out for the moment. Just wondering as I see many people saying they longed from 75xx or 7xxx, so are y'all taking about getting back into BTC in those levels or opening a 2x Long then. Personally I got lucky and got back into BTC around its lowest level before the initial $1000 bgd without opening a position so far, cos I've been to scared to open one 
Imagine a 100$ gain / day for the next 6 months.
Good to see sentiment coming back to the market. 70b in less than a week. 

My guess is tax day being over. Who knows!
This thread has been pretty hectic tonight so I'm bracing for the downvotes already, just thought i should say something.

Posting a bearish/bullish statement will have zero effect on the price, as much as people think it does.
It often does more harm then good, as the less experienced traders will just follow whatever the sentiment is on here - admittedly I've been a victim of this in the past.

The bears vs bulls battle here is getting toxic and annoying

I just found this guy on youtube, find his TA was interesting. Do you agree or disagree with him ? And why ? I’m trying to learn from everything I found so please share your point. 
Thank you, have a wonderful weekend too.

Is this an ascending wedge?

https://www.tradingview.com/x/IIyF30rB/

Or ascending channel?

https://www.tradingview.com/x/HAE5aeya/

EDIT: I'm excluding wicks for the time being because I think the market is too illiquid right now so they probably distort the interpretation.
The last two times we had practically the same movements.. slowly creeping up to the resistance trendline. I'm not sure whether this is bullish or bearish.
Remove 3 decimal places from BTC price = ~proportional to # of millions of individuals globally who hold a non-dust amount of BTC (>$50-100).
If you have a bull flag but the flag part looks more like an ascending triangle, what determines your price target?

The base of the flag or the flagpole (including base)?
I checked tradingview on a computer which i havent used for this in a while and it had a plotted log resistance line from before the last attempt (11,7k)

I know it's a slightly lower line due to this but look at it today: https://imgur.com/a/qBDsC5F

Edit: aand a huge breakout
Trying to break out, but can it get above 8500 and hold?
Is it normal that the sell-side order book on finex didn't fill back up after that big market buy?
8500 is and has always been major linear resistance/support. Very interesting next minutes as to whether it will act as support or resistance.
there doesn't seem to be a lot of selling pressure here at $8500

I think it'll probably go up a few hundred bucks more after a short period of consolidation 
Where does everyone have log resistance at? 
I can see this going to 9K that is where I have a fibb line. Then a little sideways and a small drop would make a iH&S on the 1D. 
[deleted]
Sat here trying to work out when/if to stop my long from 8100.  
I think I'll take some profit if we go sub 8300. 
is it worth opening both a long and short with stop losses here?


Any significance in interest rates slowly creeping up on finex?

I was short from 8.1 perps (got stopped out at 8.5 earlier this morning). Last night I added a long at 8.3 to hedge myself and took profit at 8550 XBTM18. 

The market close on my short was a ridiculously overpriced buy at 8575 but I also caught near the top of the June futures for closing my long. I can now re-enter my long for 100 cheaper or sit it out and wait to long a significant retrace or short the pump following a decisive breakdown. 

I'm thinking the right play here is to sit it out but I feel like revenge trading after getting fucked by the market stop on my short. Fuck. 
[deleted]
Over the last few hours, the number of longs are increasing and the number of shorts are decreasing.  So, wouldn't that mean in general more buying than selling?  Yet, the price has trended down.

What does this mean?  I'm guessing the longs selling to take profit are selling higher volume than the new longs and new shorts?  i.e. market is scared to take the bait?

Edit: Also, regarding volume, perhaps the higher value underwater shorts are not closing but the lower value underwater shorts are closing, so the trend for number of shorts is down but the market pressure is still on sell?

We're currently sitting below horizontal resistance, log resistance from ATH, inside an ascending wedge, with textbook Wyckoff distribution, and longs outnumbering shorts. BTC will have to break through soon, or it will get rejected hard.
According to my log chart, we've been pretty much hugging the higher log resistance for the last six hours. Is that a good or a bad thing?

Next BGD will be the John Holmes model. Bears can't even move the price $50 and have been getting bought into for days.  Guessing they borrowed some coins OTC that need to be covered, probably by stock market closing bell.  They're definitely running on empty.
[removed]
so far we are not breaking through the log-line, always staying close below...
If BTC does pull back at this resistance, are the alts likely to follow with greater severity? 
Tethered \~50&#37; of my trading stack @8490. There's lots of downside risk here, would prefer to see a confirmed breakout, and suspect the market makers like Soros et. al are gonna do what they can to screw over the most people. Paucity of fresh fiat coming in from Coinbase too.
"spoofy" is back on gdax, if not elsewhere. There is what seems to be a legitimate wall at 8507 (was 70 coins and several were purchased on the last go-around and it wasn't removed; there is another one higher). But, 250 coins was added just above it and removed just as quickly.

Edit: the 250 coin wall was moved up to 8520. 
Longed the breakout from the wedge

Stops at break even

Edit:  Want to add that I think this is a very precarious place to be longing.  However, this is the first attempt at the log resistance since $11.7k which, if broken, promises a lot of upside.  I'll switch my trade if we're rejected again.  My assumption is another attempt here in the next few hours
Regardless of the outcome, there is some major resistance at 8550.
Bulls are getting awfully cocky in here. Reminds me of when we bounced to 11k and stayed there for a while only to get rejected.

The reason I'm so sceptical is there is literally nothing to warrant another bull run, apart from the fact that we've been in a bear market for a few months. 

I doubt we've hit our proper bottom yet, this is probably a fools rally but that being said i wouldn't be surprised if we keep rising, i just dont think this run is going to take us back to ATH levels again.

What do you all think? Have we hit our bottom?
[removed]
Have we broken through the ATH log resistance yet? I’m not at my computer so I don’t have access to the charts 
No TA resistance till 9150.
You what I would like? Just small gains, say 2%, nice and easy. I'm too old for these pumps and dumps.

Should we expect more price increases this weekend as fish are all done with taxes and have some free time to see the rally, experience FOMO, and buy in?
Bulls losing steam? 


I think it's got to the stage where the best advice to follow is the do the opposite of what the "analysis" (read: guesswork) on here says.  

When the consensus is we're going down, we go up, and vice versa.
Any bears out there left?
What do people think of this:

https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-mining_profitability.html#log

That the need for mining profitability has been propping up the price of BTC since 2016? Seems like a very underrated theory that might show when the bottom is in store.

https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/19/bitcoin-miners-are-losing-money-at-any-price-below-8600-morgan-stanley.html

Edit: If you are going to downvote me, explain why this holds no credence. I'm not stating it as fact, but presenting it as something that could be a helpful indicator. Look at the damn chart, Bitcoin has walked a tight rope on mining profitability since summer 2016. If profitability is currently projected at $8600 then how is that not a very interesting thing to look at. TA only goes so far when there are other forces at play in a market like this.
This might be one big O B.A.R.T.

The only reason this isn't going up faster is that the people accumulating are smart and patient investors who don't want to drive it up too fast. They're happy to eat your shorts, man.
lol This whole BTC run is lead by ETH the new KING in town. without it bouncing this hard and propelling, BTC would be in goblin town. hahaha.

Sorry wanted to troll cause im drunk. Happy Weekend!

if anything these pumps are making me more bearish.. these whales aren't buying it to hodl til 20k. 
Sentiment everywhere from traders seems to be an almost expectancy of a dump (bordering on hopium, to be honest). This leads to me believe it won't come to pass and we will range here instead.
Understandably very tentative buying/selling at this long term log trend line. Not in a position right now but definitely feel the next significant market move will set the trend for the coming days.
[removed]
My small YOLO long was stopped at break even.  We [broke down](https://www.tradingview.com/x/SW3VWy7n/) from the trend line... am expecting some more downside here... will look for $8440 here for support.  tp: $8340

Assuming this doesn't go any higher in the near future, a 50% retracement would be at around 8700.

Wouldn't it be hilarious if we went from $12k to $6k to ~$12k to ~$6k to $12k again? like wtf bitcoin get your shit together 
Holy shit so glad I sold all my alts when we broke 8550..they are bleeding..
Charts are telling me to expect a drop soon. Think we will retest and fail to be supported by the big triangle, make another move down to 5k area where we range until we meet log resistance and finally break through.   That said, would like to be wrong. 
[deleted]
Early this morning I discovered a bear snuck into my kitchen while foraging for food but found his way to the blender instead.

Now *that's* a protein shake.

I'm not ready for ATH log resistance yet, but soon. Some accumulation/consolidation through the weekend, though, and everyone here gets a financial smoothie. My long from $6950 remains open.  
Get ready to 'scale into your shorts' 
Bear trap.

Many are taking short positions here awaiting a dump.  They're playing their hand too early.  Alts are up huge, and when they take profits and hedge into btc, we see 9k again.
I took profit on 75% of my BCH ratio long here at 0.128. It was a great trade but im expecting BTC to break the log downtrend and momentarily go berserk against alts. We will see, i plan to let the final part of my long ride. This trade more than made up for a stopped out 8.1 short i had. I also have an ETH long from 0.062 that i plan to ride to much higher.

Dont miss out on great BTC returns if we are really in the middle of an alt season.
Its way too early to say anything, but, looking at 30m candles, it looks like it could be forming an ascending triangle again
Damn, mr Bear Whale hit the sell button. 

EDIT: whale wars beeing fought on finex. This volume could get interesting.
Looks like Roger Ver went all in on BCash

Alts should dump profit into btc soon in anticipation of its breakout

Edit:  if bitcoin dumps, alts dump harder.  If bitcoin breaks out here, are alts really going to go up even harder?  I don't think so.

Edit 2: and there is the breakout
Guys no matter how hard the times are, whether you are a bull or a bear. Learn from your mistakes, reflect on your performance and you will prevail.

EDIT: No Pain No Gain.
What are the theories as to why the alts are up so much today? Is this some kind of mass flippening?
The hourly RSI is *still* at 79 on GDAX. This is either going to have a large retracement overnight, or it's going to continue to go up, RSI be damned.

Why does it feel like bitcoin is being propped up to support an altcoin run? Market dominance down but btc value is rising slowly (relative to past rises) and alts are doing amazing(ish).
Hmmmmm nah not a big enough spike to think this weeks sideways trend is going anywhere, it may hit the log downward trend line from the ath a little sooner but I'm expecting very little to happen until that line hits the current price

Think I'll move my greedy sell up to 9.6k

This breakthrough is a little underwhelming, isn't it? I was expecting either a hard bounce or a strong breakout.
Can anyone who knows about capital market makers comment on what the end game for bitmex looks like?Can they remain unregulated forever, or more likely when they do become regulated, what will be their profit potential? If the regulated scene means they only make a fraction of their profits today, then they have even more incentive to milk this market "illegally".
I'm sorry for your loss, I hope you DCA into bitcoin again overtime for a hodl position
I'm sorry to hear that. :( You okay?
Your best option is to take this as a calling. Start looking for that job and lock-in a good opportunity for yourself for when you graduate.

Good luck
Really sorry to hear that mate.. if it’s any consolation, I have also lost lots over past few weeks due to some really bad, quick and emotional trades. Now trying to take it slowly, patiently and with a clear aim of not rushed or revenge recovery - if only I can stick to plan!
Sorry to hear that. I'm sure it will be all good in due time. Learn from your mistakes and try to stay positive. 
You’ll be back. (I’m being supportive)
I've been on the wrong side of this stick as well; Iwas a bit more careful though; don't worry too much, you are young and will get more chances
See you next time with your mortgage. /s
Been there. Once the anger pass you'll see how being relieved of stress is great.

Advice: don't trade before your brain fully processed what happened. If it works correctly you should have way less emotions in your future trades (worked for me at least..)

Wow Yolo. I guenuinely missed your presence here for the past months of crypto winter. We hodlers lived through Hell.
> If you've been flat or wondering when a good time to enter and strap-up for a summer full of gains was... it looks like that time ~~is now~~ was two weeks ago.


But, but I can *imagine* things travelling faster than the speed of light.
It sounds like you imagine it will go quickly.  Actually many people imagine it will go faster than it will.  Or do you think it will go to $10K in a millisecond.

Real FOMO will come back at some point for a short period if time, but how many people really think BTC should be valued at $20K...or $15K.  So if there is some FOMO, it sure won't last long before BTC tops out and then probably declines again.
Congrats man, happy 420.
Always encouraging to read these type of posts. Profit is profit. Good trade. Blaze it! 
Reenter into a long or short?
how much leverage did you use?
>95% profit on this trade, keeping this open would become greedy.

I agree. Good trade, I think you did the right thing here.
good for you I removed any sell under 11.5 k , scared to be in fiat .........
Nice trade. I hope you can celebrate on 420 day appropriately.
> IMO the most rational thing to do here is simply stay out of position and see what happens. I'd only consider reentering long if we break up over 8.7K. If there was a build up of longs I'd see an incentive to go short but right now at only 30K outstanding and fairly split 53/47 ratio its not worth it.

My sentiments as well

Risk/reward is better to sacrifice $200 delta between here and the line, as potential downside has support at $7800... but could move much lower if this breaks down


Wow! Large Trade Tracker function is really crazy to see....
V=one bitcoin trade order?  So v > 38 means a 38BTC order?  
People will still keep saying short at 9k, 9.2k, 10k, etc etc. Thing is some of them will always be valid as BTC will retrace a bit after every decent bounce. But if we are in a real upward trend, we need to be really careful and always weigh risk vs reward... my 2 cents worth of wisdom!
Yeah man, the bear argument didn't really convince me but when there are so many of them you can start to doubt yourself.
because it's becoming trendy to be shorter, i remember this sub long time ago it was all about long or hold or fiat. Then some shorter appeared and its fine, they create volume too. But lately it's simply noob with 100$ thinking they can make money on the way down. I respect real good shorters, but seriously a lot of bullshit here. No talking about ALTs noobs trying to convince themselve that btc is dead.
[deleted]
What do you speculate the purpose of these coordinated buys to be? 
liquidating short positions?
setting up for a steep drop off? 
Obviously the broadest purpose is to make as much money as possible - but do you think they (whales & coordinated groups) make more money in a bear market or a bull market? Do they want to see bitcoin over $12,000 again or do they profit enough off of these wild fluctuations in a bear market?
Yep, both BGD today exactly 12 hours apart... hmmm.
Which trade ui is that? And/or indicator?
[deleted]
Will you close at 8100 falling?
How strong do you consider this wedge? Seems almost parallel.
I've got my "In case of BART" sequence on standby on my bot(s) (ergo panic sell from pairs to ETH to USDT).
Bitfinex looks more like a parallel channel \- and the micro correction in the last couple hours after the break\-out from the channel has exactly "respected" the upper trendline of the channel \(resistance turned support\). Fair to say that this chart is more bullish?

[https://imgur.com/mVAXEXy](https://imgur.com/mVAXEXy)
What point do you think we are on this then?

The final spike before the dump? 
It's pretty uncanny... 
As textbook as the accumulation and push through supply was, I'd say 60/40 on the partially formed pattern. Wouldn't trade on it, but keeping a keen eye on any breakdown of support.
I have no idea what I'm looking at there but thanks all the same - I've no idea what phase we're at ;D

Edit : thanks for clarifying chaps.
That is simply amazing.Thank you for sharing.
Can someone please put this into context? Basically assets, dint have a clear beginning, and end. So what happens after the formation is complete? 
Why would you do that? You leveraged up?

How bad?
How did you get rekt on a 2% move?  Very high leverage?
Ahh mate why did you, whyyy?
I got an email from Angellist a few hours ago.

https://angel.co/newsletters/bitcoin-is-not-dead-041918

It says crypto job listings has doubled this quarter despite the price going down. So yea I agree with you that the next bubble is gonna be huge. It is ready to start brewing again.
Based on my own close circle of friends and family, over the last 6 months they have all shown an interest in crypto and asked me questions.  None have invested yet but a couple now have a Trezor and fiat on exchanges and have yet to pull the trigger.  There were high barriers to entry during the frenzy, exchanges were overloaded and couldn’t process new accounts quickly enough and it was close to the Christmas holidays so people just missed it completely.  The interest has held though, we have daily coverage in the media, scam coin adverts have been banned and regulations are coming giving the average investor a greater sense of security when putting their money in.  Last years pump was just a test.
See I genuinely think the opposite, on the basis that those who wanted to get into crypto already have. Before we had a ton of laypeople getting into crypto, but now I think we're at the point where Bitcoin's popularity is pretty high but I don't really see huge potential to get higher, particularly as, for most people, its use as a currency is irrelevant.
Most of the people that wanted a coinbase account are already verified and don't have to mess with that roadblock next pump.
Work with a guy who says Bitcoin is going to zero.  I find out he mined bitcoin back in 2010 and had about 9 bitcoin, but lost his private keys. Never mined/bought it again and probably kicking himself.  So next best thing is to hate on it.
The next bubble has always been a lot bigger than the last one historically
It only took a couple of hours for the rejection from 11.7k back in early March.

Sorry for you man, it was a risky move. I honestly don't know what to do right now either. I canceled a buy order yesterday at 8270, I chickened out. Feeling left out sucks. 
Bro stop TUI.

I wish you have a profitable trade very soon. 
HAMMOCK PARTY!
Agreed, hopefully 8200 provides support long enough for us to consolidate for the next move up in the next 12-24 hours. 

It seems to be moving in the right direction for the cup and handle formation. Something to watch for, anyway.

> 4hr RSI hasn't dropped below 44 in this run which gives me some reticence but u/_chewtoy_ made an insightful observation which is that RSI is generally a more helpful indicator in range bound trading

RSI not dropping below 40 is a pretty good trend confirmation. The bad part is that 1D RSI not being able to bust through 60 is also a trend confirmation. Down trend.
We may actually be in a range now!  https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8dksw2/daily_discussion_friday_april_20_2018/dxok3si/
The bulls ran free today as expected. You've been a good sport throughout and your one of the guys i respect on here. Farewell bullbear.

PS: I call you bullbear because your the only bearish bull on here. Somewhat of a realist. Shame, you could of been a great bull.
More like 1 million
well done indeed, taking profit is the most difficult part

4/20 has been good :)
I don't understand the logic of high leverage on a small percentage of stack. Isnt that equivalent of using 75% of your stack, with a ~1.33% stop loss? 

Except you now pay extra interests. 
damn your trade was ballsy
lolol well done man. 
Noob here. If we are to follow this TA analysis indefinitely, then it can only be implied that price will only go downhill, until it reaches 0. If TA is a self-fulfilling prophecy then we should all be shorting with a trillion times leverage because this resistance line says so, right? 

My underlying question is, under what circumstances would it be acceptable in a TA perspective to “healthily” and safely break above this diagonal line pointing downwards?
>70% chance this will break down and a 30% chance it will break up

I highly doubt these numbers, the linear ath line and the 3 month log line both broke on the 6.8 to 8 jump
Hmm. With alts on full bull, I'm skeptical about a breakdown here. But if it does break down, the downside is huge imo, 7.8 is nowhere near a real support so we're talking sub 6k imo.
To add to this, if we do turn around here that would be a double top (since BGD event) on the daily RSI at ~60. It hasn't made it above 60 this year (been rejected 6 times now).
Awesome break down. Thank you for sharing!
>Bitmex futures are still trading below spot, despite the obvious bullish movement. At the very least, it could be said that futures traders are more eager to sell than futures buyers are to buy.

I'd say that's bullish. Negative premium on futures is similar to a large number of shorts being open on Bitfinex. 

If I had to bet, I'd still bet on a short right here. Luckily I don't have to bet.
Dude, when we went from 6500 to 7800 last week I had long from 6400 that got wicked out from a stupid tight SL, decided to wait a bit before opening again and 20min later we climbed $1K. This was what $300? You'll catch the next one.
Step away for a while.  You're seeing things man.
Post of the day.
You sure that was ripple?

Edit: still a valid reason to be cautious
And of course there will still be the 'we need one more dip to 6k before we can rally' posts.
200K? Nah sitting in fiat for this, very comfortable in fiat, way overbought etc.
So very true. 8500 was never anything to really brag about. And here we are... excited about a 200 dollar pump when we were at this price point 4 weeks ago
Isnt it more about what it means. Breaking the downtrend line will be bullish at any level.
Just last night people were talking about how often the horizontal lines hold more weight than the diagonals
Very close to just unhedging and seeing how far it goes up before turning around. 

Even if we're long term in a bear market, the downtrend has been extremely aggressive so far. I wouldn't be surprised to see several weeks of buying after this. 

I said I'd reconsider if we blew past $8.5k-$9k and I'm definitely reconsidering. 

the r/r for shorting is just beginning to seem not worth it. I'd love to get the top but perhaps it's smarter to not fight the trend and just ride it out. 

This could very well be the top, though. It's a toughie.

I wouldn't mind unhedging at the local top and losing a bit on a pullback. This movement is starting to just look relentless again. 

I'm also inclined to be done margin trading because bitmex is basically unusable. 
waiting to 8800 now obviously.
I just got back in with the rest of my trading fiat 
Got in with 50% of my fiat. I never sold anyway.
Nothing dangerous about getting stopped out during a breakout with a small percentage loss, actually. Either way, I called the bottom at 6.5k so I'm sick of people calling me a permabear or shorter cuz i am shorting before logarithmic resistance levels lol. Yes bro, I short when the price is going up, not down.That's when all the bulls are here celebrating so it's the only posts by me they see.
In 1 year yes
I'm watching this too and expect btc to breakout once eth passes 600$ but beware of the mod lol
Volatility is back on the stock market so might as well enter crypto where the upside can be 1000x
Of course. If Bitcoin becomes part of the mainstream conciousness it'll get really ridiculous really fast. For perspective there are 24 million people Living in Shanghai alone and there are 21 million Bitcoins total.
Great advice. I'll feel a lot more confident in this run if we break 9000. Then the bullish flair will be reattached.
Does the fence hurt your butt? I always wondered...
It's been signalled, you all know what to do. 
I"m more bullish than you but this thing probably isn't going to 9k in the short term. People always get super bullish right before the log resistance line for some reason lmao
If this breaks the line here, I'm not bearish anymore

The question is: Do you short at 9k?
what's that?
I did. I'm scared now.
We're breaking up out of the downtrend that formed after the ATH in Dec. Waiting for confirmation is never a bad idea, though.
Yes. So, I did last week.
Nah man... This is absolutely unsustainable we have had a single decent correction since the BGD. If it seems to good to be true.. it probably is. I could be wrong and this goes to 12k though. 
Give me one valid reason , did we have seen some positive Bitcoin news today ? did they just release a Bitcoin killer app ?
Even if the market pulls back by a good few hundred bucks, I am still going to be in green. So no, I am not taking any profits yet.
only take profit here if you are trading by the hours... if you look at the longer time frames, we still have ways to go.
You mean short? I guess you cant win em all. I really enjoy your posts keep em up. Good luck on your next rrade
You mean short?

\*short
same. no biggie
>  Tight stops above 8650

If it doesn't break out; wicks can fuck you out

A poem by me; based on the story of my life.
I did/think the same. No stops tho, just gonna ride in BTC and see how the reaction to fib levels go
There's usually a volume spike in around 20 min when east coast gets to the office and then again when west coast gets to theirs. 

At least that's what my empirical evidence supports
Good job not buying in to the FOMO. A ton of lurker bulls coming out of the woodworks throwing out 300% target projections is an excellent time to let your limit sells hit. 

Worst case you can re-enter at 8800. 
If only there were records of some sort to reference
The charts seem to show that it was even more violent. I'm on mobile, so I'm going off of my memory of the charts. I would advice you double check. 
thank you for your service sir
Same could’ve been up 20k instead I down in the other direction 🙂
This is gold

Also BitMEX is playing the ultimate winning trading game here
4/20/18 12:00:00 -- $8,600     
4/21/18 00:00:00 -- $8,577     
4/22/18 00:00:00 -- $8,521      
4/23/18 00:00:00 -- $8,463     
Currently the zone to watch would probably be 8.5k-8.65k. By Saturday it'll be more like 8.4k-8.5k.
Bingo, Bulls climb a wall of worry etc. The constant worrying and bearishness on display from experienced traders is really solidifying my belief that a reversal isnt far off, or it is already in play.
well it briefly hit resistance and stayed there. it could consolidate more or go further. or reverse and dump again. no one knows but it helps to be close to the screens these days.
If it was a suckers rally most people wouldn't be so skeptical about it. 

Happy cake day 
haha, I sold a bit on 7.9k, re-entered for 7.95k minutes later cause I can't time the market.  

If I am expecting a btc drop, I make sure to get out of alts and stay mostly in BTC.  
So when BTC drops, alts mostly do too and then I get into alts with my btc stash and get out with profit and accumulate more BTC.  

I hated it when I sold my BTC and it went up more and you're staring at the screen hoping for it get back to your selling point.

Holy fuck, I remember that post, but don't remember that battle. Yet here we are again.
Well, if the downtrend is respected indefinitely, it goes to zero. It’s bound to at least limp across it at some point.
There is an old saying: It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his unrealized gains depends on his not understanding it.

No one is going to see the significance of the declining trends compared to price in a highly manipulated market.
Well, the pump from 6.5 - 8k was literally all shorts closing, and no new public interest or money is required for that. So of course there can be some divergence. But yea, until there is a lot of new public interest and money coming in there probably won't be a bull run. Doesn't mean it can't go up quite a bit with money within the space, though.
ETH leading..I think BTC breaks out
Some of us just want to fuck the banksters 
This is my thought process right now. It's all about risk management.
I disagree. This is an inexpensive place to let the market coil up and figure out what it's going to do.
Yes, I am short here, targets dispersed all the way from 8450 to 7650
Interesting... your chart is weeks old and we're basically at B already... having never made it to A. I think you could interpret our current position as B... which shows us pushing sideways through resistance.
Retest the 7k range? As in high 7k or 7000?
Good advice, and thanks for sharing.
I wouldn't sell based on this chart, holding from A to C is a safer bet if you really think we get to C. B could easily be a very shallow dip or more sideways. Good luck with your trades, I just wouldn't trust the TA to that level of resolution.
As long Finex is pushing the price with fake 500BTC support-orders i will stay in the position.
Realistically there hasn’t been a “ True” pull back yet like we are all expecting.

We were all expecting 7.5k in order to make next major next leg up, but we got 7.8k 
If it's a big correction and not a bubble popping, there's little reason we shouldn't see 10k soon and a good old consolidation there tbh. It's not that much % wise.
I think this is a prudent assessment... we haven't really seen a pull back since the direction change at $7k ... and the log resistance will be tough to move through...

Still we've been in a down trend for 18 weeks ... I don't think we're more than 4-6 weeks from a break 
Sounds like battered bull syndrome.

whats BGC?
Not necessarily, in 2013 we crossed the trend line then went down for a long time.
BGD > BGC
There's always the possibility of a fakeout friend
let's go bulls! where's MJ when you need him?
> I'm thinking of putting a stop buy of 8650+, which is i think I enough not to get stop hunted

Maybe not for now.  But a little bump and plateau there, or a drift up, and it's within range.  So you'd still best monitor and adjust IMO.

Anyway, that's barely a hundred up, prime Bart range.  (though the market is probably too hot right now to do the Bart)

"I feel like the next big move is going to be decisive."

The same line we hear every single day.
Also if we fall from here there is a possibility of a smaller double top. Double top worked pretty well for bears since ATH
I literally just drew this. Another reason I wouldn't open a long here. 
It's almost as if you can draw lines the way you want.
same. loss not so mini
This might be a good question to ask later in the day when the members who frequent this sub that live in Asia are awake.

Although I don't think they have become irrelevant, I would be interested to hear some input from someone living in the region.

If you think the tribalism is bad here, try being a bear on ethtrader
Wonder if we should get rid of the flair as its presence may mislead people into thinking that this is a place for tribalism...
We agnostics should band together in a sort of tribe and go after both bears and bulls 
The tribalism comes not from the labeling but from the nature of some posters who are more concerned with being right than reading what the market is trying to say objectively.  Perhaps it's human nature but I would have hoped this tendency would be less present in a sub with a culture and reputation like BitcoinMarkets is supposedly known for.
wow took the words right out of my mouth
Agreed. I think it's just another case of social signallig getting out of hand on reddit. At first I was hoping to squeeze some meaning out of the volume of people flagging for bearish vs bullish but beyond the obvious it seems people stick to their guns in a way that ruins any analysis- "choosing sides" in a game that's supposed to be balancing act for each player. Makes no sense. 
[yep](https://www.tradingview.com/x/TBgCGeAu)
Thanks man 
lol you fool. I mean thx
RIP
Bears are also still heavily upvoted to be fair
So much this.

We celebrated at 17k after 20k
Then at 11800 after 5800
Then at 10k after 8000
Then 8000 after 6500

Sentiment, some drawn lines and historical records all play a part here but trade craefully like I'm not.
You speak as though BTC trading is anything but gambling...

I'm more flabbergasted by short position here, seeing how much the alts have boomed.
Yeah, seeing posts like "it's a done deal at this point" has me worried.. 
Couldn’t agree more 
Remember the sentiment on March 5th? The last time we were at the log downtrend? I do.
There was even the potential for a monster inverse h&s then.
and $666 was a big one
Seemed like 4ever too or I was just high. That shit seemed like it was a joke for weeks if not months. Not even going to look at the chart.
Took me a while to get that one... if you know what I mean -.-
Ethtrader, is that you?
Blaze it up
In all likelihood, your trade is already liquidated...you just don't realize it yet. 

Here are the points where you could have entered a 100x long position in the past 2 weeks and not have been liquidated:

1. $6,400

2. $7,000 - $7,500 during the Big Green Candle

3. $7,800 - $8,050 yesterday.

4. $8,200 - $8,450 today

Any other 100x leveraged position has already been liquidated.

That's an insanely low margin for error.
Make that 75x and push liquidation just under 8400. That should massively increase your odds!
I'm 1X long with 100% if my stack. 
crazy trade... rootin for ya
50x i could understand, 100x is almost impossible since we already hit 8450 and stop hunters will probably fake out an break to the upside...
market sell a few points before liquidation buddy, liq price is before -100% roe
Wonder how many others besides me went to the Liquidation Calculator after seeing this comment and see what they could live with.
fun trade!
Following, good luck!
I guess BTC is getting high too
There's a major resistance at 9.2 before that, no lambos quite yet.
At 13.5 I'll officially reconsider my bearish sentiment.  Not before.

Pumps can have serious legs, but that doesn't mean the bear market is over.
The exchanges know their business depends on the high prices of Crypto more than when at lower prices and lower interest of the public.
Maybe even now if we break 8500
congrats on your long, mate. When do you plan to close?
I've been on the sidelines the last week or two, mostly just looking at the charts during my study breaks and joining some discussion here through out the day. 

But i will say, March was a terrible month for me and I took like a week or two break and came back stronger than ever honestly. Give your mind a change of scenery, exercise, hang out with friends family whatever. Honestly too much trading just burns out your mind after a while and you have a larger chance of making mistakes. 

This is purely my opinion and anecdotal to my experiences, but I feel the advice is applicable nonetheless. 
Sometimes the best place is the sidelines. Especially if your not sure and are on the back of some bad trades. Sit out for a while try and find a good entry. The market isn't going anywhere don't throw the rest of your stack away revenge trading.

Edit. some stuff
Take a few days to reflect and integrate the experience.  Watch the chart and the chat and imagine what you would have done and see what hypothetically would have or would not have worked out.  Don't get caught up in a loop of missing out during then, you don't have to have a trade open for every movement.  The market will always be here.  BGD/BRD are not going to go away.
There are a handful of trades that will pay huge dividends, and if you're good at identifying them, trading these obvious moves will be a more profitable long term strategy.  Over trading is how most novice traders lose money (I've been there several times).  There are a small fraction of people who can day trade and consistently make money but it's very difficult 
I'd take a step back, honestly. I've done it a couple times. Usually only a day or so, but watching the market out of position is very helpful.
Learn to look at longer timeframes. Ever since the big pump a week ago, opening shorts is not the best idea. The market is going through a reversal, you can't know if it's the end of the bear market, but a push to at least 9100 was/is likely. Sentiment is good etc. You should just go long on a consolidation, use less tight stops and take some profit along the way. Don't close your entire position, hedge yourself on futures or swaps. 

TA is not really invalid, it's actually been very smooth going. If you assume that most formations will break bullish instead of bearish. Only decent short opportunity was a couple days ago with the H&S, it didn't see much followthrough, that's your go sign to go long again. 

If you keep losing, change your position size. Trade much smaller until you get a feel for the market again. Scaling in and out of positions over longer periods of time also helps. 

Maybe you should take a break. I saw the same post three days ago. Enjoy the weekend.
I recommend to downsize 50% each time, until you get things right. So you start with 1000 USD, then you fail, now buy 500. Then 250, 125 and so on. This makes you be able to trade more but limit your risk
Felt the same after the first xrp run up. It hasn't abated for 3 days now
Wait for a dip and buy a smaller amount, if it goes up from there, you win. If it goes down, buy more in increments 
Take a breather. We're about to hit the resistance from ATH.
Well you could wait for chewys next trade and follow him. He's been spot on the past month.
I have them as another support/resistance reference point. Use traditional.
Yes, i use them pretty much constantly.  Super helpful in getting out of my shorts before the BGD.

Did a run down of it here: https://www.tradingview.com/x/8QJ8L7N5/
https://www.tradingview.com/script/shGui6GQ-MACD-Cross-Grid/

Here you go, my love.
Careful with stop buys. If I were ever to use one, I would probably set an automatic ladder. 5 stop buys with the same trigger (8800) with limit prices of 8800-8450. Something like that
Yeah I'm kinda hoping this resolves it's self within the next 24 hours. Have two dates lined up this weekend; this situation will definitely get in the way if we are still skirting that line tomorrow. 
He wasn't literally long iirc. He's out of position but virtually long with his cold storage.
I believe they expected us to bounce hard off the downward channel resistance from ATH.
Yep. I think we should all take a minute to appreciate how hard it must be to write a trading engine which works so well at actively preventing anyone from trading at critical points.

I'm guessing they forgot to feed the hamsters powering it again
The last run up like this I got paid half as much as I did in the December rally.

That dip to 6.5k cost me 3x (in interest) what I'd been paid on the rise back to 11.6k and since this rise back in the past week I've literally gotten *zero* interest on the whole.
Because just getting over that line isn't nearly enough to confirm a bullrun. If you are confident you should long those futures though.
That happened like a month ago?
I agree. The expectation would be confirmation of the double top and the price would elevator down. We'd definitely be talking about bubble confirmation and goblin town. Bulls would be saying there's no confirmation yet.
Yeah, I would be bearish in the short term at a minimum. Thinking "how deep is this correction?" Lol
"If this is such an obvious short oppertunity why is the price going up instead of down?"

Sounds like similarly dumb logic permabears were spewing at 6.5k a week ago lol, "If this is such an obvious long opportunity why isn't the price going up right now".

Bro, you aren't a trader and you have no idea what you are talking about. Nothing is "obvious" in markets. 


Yes, ill see you at 10k, at some point.
Yes, I expect some sideways and then a dump out of it over thenext few days. How fast it drops/recovers will gives us a good idea of how bullish the market truly is.
the noobs will yolo in above 9k just before the wedge breaks down....
[deleted]
the whole btc chart (since 2011) is a rising wedge
[deleted]
I've never seen anyone say the volume is good, only bad. 

Personally, I am seeing a trend reversal in daily volume and that's a bullish sign for me
The only wedges I have confidence in for the direction of break out are those big macro wedges.

It could be possible to break down 500ish below your support in the future, and create a larger wedge, as we coil up for a bigger % drop later from a higher point.  (these wedges tend to iterate)
To play devil's advocate, this is a prime scenario for a break down to evolve into a fakeout, because if the ATH log trend turns into support, a break down then bounce could end up painting a falling wedge on shorter timeframe.
1d RSI hit overbought in 2014 in April/may. We're overdue for a real "correction" upwards 

Think about it.. Most bull market corrections hit 1d oversold before bouncing. It wouldn't be crazy to see us hit 1d RSI overbought before coming back down. 
My mind is telling me nooooo

But the FOMO, the FOMO is telling me yeeeaaahhhh
There are two ways to interpret this. 

Strong rejection - Bearish

Small correction - Moderately bullish

Consodilation whitout significant correction - Extremely bullish. 
mind show us your chart. my 1D RSI is not even overbought.
And there's little to no new buyers.. think about that one. 
That wedge could break at this point and bounce off the descending line as support.
Alts are bored waiting for btc, decided to ignore it.
bitcoin cash cash is already a thing right

same as every other alt?
Well, I did hear they managed to take over the Bitcoin twitter account. Also, they paid for some paid placement in CNBC about how Bitcoin Cash is now the new Bitcoin.
I believe the main reason is because r/btc has been growing like hell, it's about to hit 200k subs now. Along with a huge amount of new adoption lately which has been highly improving people's sentiment.

Edit: Why am I even being downvoted for this. I was at +4 earlier and now I'm at -2.

Edit2: Ok it's clear now that these trolls are following me around and giving me a slew of downvotes on some of my comments. This happened suddenly at about the 20 minute mark after I made the comment. Yes, I've been watching, because this has been happening frequently lately. What can I do about this?
There are some very interesting developments happening on BCH. While BTC is waiting for LN and pivoting to "store of value" BCH is absorbing all the projects that no longer fit BTC.
by out you mean your short got totalled! you've been a die hard shorter breaking ears about downtrend collapse & death all along
this is good for bitcoin.
I'll give it to the bulls, this does feel different. 

Hard not to be emotional over it. Would certainly be exciting to get in at a "low" price of $9k. 

It's amazing how quickly sentiment changes but yeah, this does feel a bit different. Who knows. Bitcoin be crazy 

This would also be the perfect place to top out and wreck a bunch of top longers.
We've broken through resistance, but I'd give it several weeks or a couple months before claiming the end of the bear market.
The price needs to "close" above the trendline. Generally you want to see at least a four hour candle closing above, but many will wait until a 1d candle does to call a recovery. 

"Recovery" doesn't mean a return to ATH, either. It could bounce around into a new pennant shape.
Once the downtrend has been definitively broken and a new trend established above it. We are almost there. 

This certainly looks bullish at first glance: https://www.tradingview.com/x/U7n2kF7K/ 

So did this: https://www.tradingview.com/x/Sp0jUv0Q/  
The risk-reward of *social* investment always favours bears.

When you make a bearish prediction against a rising price, everyone immediately downvotes you, laughs at you, sneers at you. You suffer maximum "social pain" immediately.

After this, you have no more social capital to lose. So it's no disadvantage to you to keep calling for a dump. In fact, it's a better call - if you are WRONG, you've already suffered maximum social pain so no one hates you more.

But if you are *right* OMG the social benefit is massive. If you are the only person on the sub constantly calling for, say, sub $3K, and it *actually goes sub $3K* you will become a God of this sub... well, if you shorted.

So bears will always bear. Always. It's worth it.
The point is being smart. We are not permba bears or bulls. I was calling for a reversal at 6.5k, but expecting us to rally now is quite naive.

And the number where we know 6k ain't happening again is 12.5
What kind of inane tribalism is this? 
Props to those who saw the bottom, I saw it but got wicked out of my long around 6.8 just before the takeoff. The point of a bearmarket is to get weak hands to sell cheap, I guess there were really not enough sellers left under that point to override demand, bears profit from weakness but once its gone no one sane would look for a last 30% down if it can go 100% up.

It's hard to adapt really, moreso when you've already missed a lot of the action. But now I feel not fomoing is kind of stupid.

I'm looking the BCH action and the buy order book is basically empty, people are market buying, what do we need more?

Obviously I've missed a lot of profit being concentrated on BTC only, feeling uneasy about its sketchy action, that was a mistake. 

Even if trading it only, the other coins were painting the bigger picture for a while already.
Squeeky wheels. The trend sets the dominant voice in a trading sub.

The trend always breaks... Eventually.
But what if it goes to 12k then crashes to 4k you are both right. It dont matter who is right. The winners will be the ones to TAKE PROFIT :)
I was wrong to call for 3k. I don't think it will happen anymore. 80-20 chance it won't.

Sorry mate!
That was bad timing. Did you get stopped out?
> stop loss at 8720

Bad timing
That was quick, condolences
you think it will fall out? Or break up?

It’s a total toss ip IMO
And 8.5k now broken... way to go....
no point in using anything more than hundreds for precision. It's a very long term line so you should give a +/- 2-3% on it at the least imo. 

My favorite charting aggregate for long term movements shows we fell just short of it by like...$20. So completely negligible.

We're hovering right under it still, though.

I had it at 8550 but i just redrew it with more accuracy on the 6h and it should actually be ~8450. Going through 17252 and treated 11700 as a fakeout.
We broke it and are sitting on the launch pad. Checked a few alts and they held the BTC pair. This pump was mostly sideline money deployed. 
Similar numbers here:

Exited my underwater short last night, entered a new one at 8530. Does not look good for shorters if 8500 holds as a support. Slowly creeping up not only to break log resistance, but higher high (9,2k) seems realistic now.

don't get greedy.
No one got broke taking profits... just put a stop loss to lock it in
You're in a pretty good position if this goes over 8.6 - yes, it's always good to take profits, but you have a very nice vantage point, and even if we retrace a bit, there's no guarantees we go under 8k. Of course, there's no guarantees we don't either, but the short term trend seems pretty bullish so I think the r/r is worth it. 

In comparison, I opened and closed a long at 8.1, re-opened it at 8.3, closed it earlier at 8.55 and re-opened it at 8.5. I envy your position right now.

You could close it partially, but I think it'd be crazy to close the whole thing.
Realistically, you should take your profits and walk. Everyone agrees it's over extended and you've already made a lot of money.

The worst that happens is you miss out on more profits from the swaps but you get some (but less) anyway from the capital appreciation of the coins you receive when you sell the swaps.

If we're all correct and it does turn around, you lose out on more coins from your swaps if you hold. If you close and it goes down, then you lose a small amount on the new coins you received.

You shouldn't expect more funding payments in your favor either way, however, because if it does fall, it'll likely fall fast enough that you won't receive any payments before you get stopped out. If it doesn't fall, interest should go against your favor any higher than this.
You could high leverage short hedge (20x) equal value at 8500 and sit back and watch. Liquidation over 8900, set a stop limit on your long at 8800 if we pass it. Essentially lets you hold your excellent entry while making 8500-wherever you close your short a wash zone.

Just a thought. 
For large movements, log scale is the only reliable way to chart patterns and trends. 

That's because the move from $11,700 to $9,200 is far more significant than the move from $20,000 to $17,500. 

While they both represent $2,500 in decline, the former is a 21% drop while the latter is only a 12.5% drop. 

The big green candle we saw the other day that moved price from $6,800 to $8,200? That's a massive 20% move in a single 4h span. 

But that same movement from $10,300 to $11,700 was just a 13% increase. 

Linear scale assumes that all movement is created equal. The move from $300 to $350 is just as significant as the move from $8,450 to $8,500 was a few minutes ago.

And that simply isn't reality. 

So that's more or less why the log line is so much more important than the linear line. Because the linear line is operating in an alternate reality where we're expected to believe that $1,000 is $1,000, regardless of where in the market's lifecycle that movement takes place.
On linear scale a 50 dollar move is the same from 1$ to 51$ and from 8000$ to 8050$. But obviously the meaning of those two moves is very different: the first case it’s a huge move up, the second case it’s not even noticeable. 

Log scale evens it out so that each move is shown based on ‘how important’ it is (basically % change). So the move from 1 to 51 would look a lot bigger on a log scale chart than the one from 8000-8050, but they’d look the same on linear chart. 

For this reason the log scale is better suited for long term cases where the price range is so big (like with bitcoin). 
We got rejected approximately by the linear one at 11.8k first go around; we've since broken and invalidated it.

On long time scales and large price ranges, the logarithmic scale is more appropriate as it better captures percent changes.
Because we've bounced off it convincingly twice since December.

And charting in logarithmic scale makes more sense when considering large-percentage moves
Because the log line actually hits the historical peaks with near perfection, and the vast majority of serious TA is done with log lines, and TA works in large part because so many people use it (self-fulfilling in a lot of cases). The more variance in charting, the less accurate it all becomes.

/personal opinion

/u/mandy7 and /u/_chewtoy_ with the technical specifics
Bitcoin has seen exponential growth over most of its lifetime. Thus bitcoin is mostly charted using a logarithmic scale, and TA is applied on those charts.
Also I'm assuming its always base 10?  Has anyone ever played around with something like base 2 similar to binary? 
Each line is a wall.

The linear resistance was a wall.  The short term moving average was a wall.  If we break the log wall, the next hurdle will be the long term moving average.  If we get past that, well be in uncharted territory until a new formation develops.
When your moving up 10x and down by 3/4ths; you need to be thinking about logs.

1, 10, 100, ?; does not make 145 nor does 19k to 5k lead to -11k

Yes, don't chase fomo
idk, i'm in waiting for the pegged 0.2 to happen
Can one sleep on 4.2 Million USD?
Aaaaaaand it's gone
linear:

2 - 1 = 1

3 - 2 = 1

n+1 - n = 1

log:

2^1 - 2^0 = 1

2^2 - 2^1 = 2

2^3 - 2^2 = 4

2^n+1 - 2^n = 2^n (2-1)

Most assets follow log prices because of the principle of compounded interest on return afaik
There was a very insightful post about an hour ago on this. Scroll down and you should find it relatively quickly.
Log shows proportional movements.

If price doubles from $1 to $2, or from $100 to $200, it'll look the same in terms of vertical movement on a log chart.  Obviously the 100-200 movement is bigger, but in a real sense that magnitude doesn't matter.  Investing a given stack (100 units for $1 or 1 unit for $100 both equal $100) will still see a 100% gain.

Log charts are good for showing price change in a way that reflects proportional return, which is why they're quite common in investing.

Fraudulent trading activity on Bitfinex , what's new.
TA is a balance of probabilities game not a prediction game. If someone decides "nah fuck that I wanna buy a shitload of bitcoin" then that sort of goes out the window.
I think our poison is sticking to one-side for too long. Well i know i need to be more dynamic in regards to the positions i take.

I fell for it too: Went short, lost money - thought to myself, 'alright now its going to correct', went short again, lost more money.

Thought to myself: 'Alright we've gone up way too much now, a correction is definitely coming --> Went short again, lost more money.

Im out of a position for now I think i need a break. If i go long now whats the bet that it will finally correct. 


Tell this to people who shorted above 12K
What timeframe for stochastic?
I'm trusting it, don't see why sellers would suddenly show up while they can sell at 10k or whatever, they want to make money too
Surely any Bullish whale sitting on the sidelines will try and push this over. The reward long term could be huge. So many stop just on the other side as well probably
I have sold my alts yesterday, mostly own btc and eth due to me believing that there is a drop coming.

So i decided to get away from alts and stay in btc in case this goes higher at least my fiat value rises with it.  

I am expecting a 10% drop anytime soon but that doesn't mean it will happen. We might as well move 10% up from here and then drop.  

In uncertain times likes this, it's always good to take 2 routes.
If btc rises, I don't miss out on fiat gains. If btc falls, alts will probably fall with it and I can re-enter cheaper alts for short term profit.

I sold a portion of my coins at 7.9k the other day and 10minutes later re-entered slightly higher cause I said fuck timing the market.  
I would say judging by the sentiment in here (seems like a lot of underwater shorts) that a lot people here HOPE 6k wasn't the bottom 
The next bull run will blow everyone's minds. The gates to cryto are almost fully open. Its going to be glorious 
Even though I've been saying we'll go back down I think 6k was the bottom. I just think we need to confirm that people want this to go higher by making a higher low. I was thinking we'd have a higher low in the low 7's but now maybe we'll have on in the mid 7's. 
11.8k to confirm the w bottom formation. we didn't even break the 20k resistance yet.
still don't

last time we hit $6000 we went up to $11,500 then back down again

this time we hit $6500 and are still only at $8500 struggling to move up $100/day and most of the moves are caused by a single whale market buying 2000 coins at a time

so to make me think this was a bottom, this needs to clear at least $12000
$6500 felt like the whale's bottom to me.  A lot of money was spent holding that up, and kicked off our series of BGDs.
I still think over 50% probability that $6K is not the bottom.
Bull flags haven't don't anything in the last week or so.

I expect the bullwhale to come back any moment as the work is not fully done. I also expect bullwhale to finish its job completely (if its a good bullwhale).
I *hear* you can make money in this game.
It happened plenty in the summer and fall. 
All patterns in trading hold perfectly until they don't.

In times past, we've held stagnant for 8 months to 2 years before a big bull run came.  It is not uncommon for lulls to end with large percentage increases in a short time, but there have also been fakeouts.

Your first best bet is to just hold.  Many have lost their entire stack thinking they were clever enough to read the market.  If you think bitcoin is a $1T+ network, then buy, hold, and let others take you there.  If you're here to gamble on the small scale TA movements in hopes of making bank even faster, then know trading based on historical patterns is not a reliable strategy.    You must consider all variables, and even then, you will lose sometimes.
Many people say this because that's what happened a long time ago. But there was probably much more reasons to lose faith in btc in 2014 than in 2018 tbh. Every single person I know at least heard about bitcoin (of which like 90% think it's too late and envy those who got in a few years ago, tho). In 2014 nobody knew about it around me.

I'm personally working under the assumption that as the number of participants in the market grows the time it takes for the boom bust cycles to play out will decrease.  Instead of a two-year bear market I've been expecting a six month one.

I think monero has the biggest value of (Market Cap/Volatility).
thats what an actual use case gets you
Didn't you say earlier that the place to buy would be if we broke 8600 convincingly?
Looks like you're right so far.

Weekends, man.
Bit of advice would be appreciated. I've got a long on June futures @ 2x leverage with a cost average of 7530.  How far behind spot would you generally keep it - should I be thinking about buying on pullbacks to bring my cost average up to around 8k do you think? 
What's with the downvotes on this sub?
I opened a short at 8530, 4% S/L (stop loss), good luck with that breakout. Weekly, daily, monthly have simply touched the upper descending log trend line. I see the opposite (or believe the opposite), a touch to that lovely line and down we go. (that little fella was already touched). 

PS: Will close at 8430
PS2: I will go long at 8650, order waiting right there. That would signal a breakout to me, if the volume is right.
I want to say that 8200 is here to stay but it also seems like gdax is just giving the arb crowd free hopeful money.

Edit: I sold at 8300 on the 3rd rejection of 8400. This was a weak one too, just wishful thinking and maybe some M-F traders being savvy. See y'all on Sunday at the $7700 buffet. 
I don't see it as being FUD. I just read this article> https://www.coindesk.com/eu-parliament-votes-for-closer-regulation-of-cryptocurrencies/ 

which is pretty simplified and doesn't get into details but I'm on the side of regulation. We are way past the using crypto only for anonymous, darknet, back-of-the-alley transactions so I welcome regulation to keep crypto adoption on the right path towards mass adoption.

Me too, friend. Congrats on the profit. Had to watch all of mine on paper.
Same thought! I hope /u/insanid will be ready and prepared when the moment comes.
Good job! I'm less happy I closed my long around 8.3... :) 
Happened with me during 6800-8200 BGD a week or two ago. I went short at the last moment. Alarm ranged while the dildo suddenly appeared. I was driving, got margin called, closed short immediately and opened long, by the time we hit 8000, I broke even and closed. :/
Maybe add some margin to keep liqui below 8500
this guy fucks
Yup, closed a shameless bch long I had since 2 days for a fat 30% gain and opened a (hopefully) long-term btc long at 8790, sl below 8500.
most alts are going down, idk if we can sustain, they're the ones that push us up
[removed]
Seems like there was?
I don't really understand, when people see a big pump they say... this growth can't be sustained, it's just whales propping up the price. When the price goes up slowly (organic growth?)they say it's a bad sign because BTC only climbs with huge green candles that are caused by whale pumps.
Alts are topping out, longs at ATH on eth, looks like the party could be over tbh and this will impact/be drown down in synergy with BTC I suppose.
My buy limit orders are sailing deep into the rearview mirror.
I have the same bad feeling.

But at the same time, if we drop a few hundreds I expect a buying frenzy.
What does BGD stand for?
Well done! Wish I could say the same!
Anything less than 6 figures will be a disappointment in my eyes.

I really wish it was a trader's  sub and we would be talking about risk management/mitigation strategies rather than the whole "Well bears, you can pack up now", because it's a tell-tale sign that the dumb money hasn't left the market yet and there's enough weak hands to dump this thing after all
It sure hurts but I'm doing the same. 
lol, you're getting downvoted for being reasonable.
Evil, you spoiled it for ppl constantly trying to redraw wedges/triangles/poneys and getting lost with wicks
I just see a well contained trading range for the last week.
"weekend" anything is a myth.
From my research, Adam and eve formations are not always accompanied by large volume

Also, if you remove all the red candles of volume from the charts (ie, days people were dumping en masse from the huge runup), volume doesn't look terrible.  It looks more like whay to expect if activity had grown steadily from before october 2017.  The big red candles make current activity look weak, which is good if it signals the avalanche of sells is over
Cancer is also organic growth, though :/
there you have it, happy now? 
only time will tell
I believe there was a 2500BTC market buy that cleared that entire range

Or it could just be a glitch
The way I draw it, we are indeed hovering right at (still on top) that line for now:

Got a chart showing that? I'm at a loss.
I'm comparing apples to oranges a bit with the below chart, but here's one argument for why it's not at all over hyped:

https://imgur.com/a/WMXMJ4q

Each time the market has overcome a significant downtrend line in recent memory, the ensuing upward movement has been substantial. 

Now, one could argue that the previous downtrends pale in comparison to the duration and depth of the current one. And that's a very valid point. But until the market proves otherwise, the violation of a downtrend line is likely to be a significant milestone.

It may be over hyped, but that doesn't negate its value as a trend line to watch closely. Anyone waiting to FOMO in at 8650 expecting a new ATH will almost surely be in for quite a surprise, as it's very likely we don't skyrocket off of it. Breaking it remains significant, though, because there have been 3 attempts (and a 4th coming very very shortly) since we peaked in December and all have been summarily rejected. It really is a defining line for labeling this a bear market. 

People shorting it are doing so based on history, and it's a decent probability low risk/high reward play. I would stop around 8720 though, and the potential reward for a legitimate rejection (sub $6K) far outweighs the risk of getting stopped out $180 above your entry).
We just went through the log resistance line from December.  On my chart it's the first time that's happened in four months.  Not sure how this is going to play out.  I'm glued to the screen.  
Small players do small pops, bigger players do bigger pops. I don't see anything unnatural :D
RSI doesn't remain overbought or oversold forever, but it can remain above 70 or below 30 for quite awhile during a strong trend. 

When the market is rangebound, RSI is a fantastic indicator for predicting movement within the range. 

When the market is trending strongly (like it is now), however, it's not nearly as reliable.
You mean 8300 ?
what are you talking about?

This is an ascending wedge, a bearish formation. Where did the 10k target come from?
It's pretty clear what's up with it.  People are expecting a pullback, not a raging bull market.
They were far behind, then quite above momentarily, now behind again.
I am asking myself the exact same thing.
The exact same thing happened in the $4,000s after the market broke the resistance line from the $5,000 to $3,000 dump. 

Futures traders are just really slow to hop on a new trend. 

...

Or this is just another dead cat bounce and those savvy Bitmex traders aren't falling for it. 
Your fomo long is showing.
the fun thing with BTC it usually do not repeat it self three times :D So this might actually be different this time
In the last incremental pushes there, I shorted every little rise because it felt right even though it was very bullish in here, and got stopped out every time I left the PC.  Finally my faith confirmed and it went down, but only right after getting stopped out again on a *tiny* fakeout when I was away and I missed the boat.  Then I later longed expecting a bounce like we had at 9k on the previous 11.7.  Then held onto that waay to long in a twisted version of revenge that cost even more.  Shitty times.  I'm only just about to finally be back in the green from those couple weeks.

Just sayin to be careful about a static and hard single SL, you could lose even if you were right ;)

Edit:  after then is when I started laddering in and out of positions in smaller more grindy increments, and it has worked out better. 
I too opened a little short here. I am bullish, I think we will break log downtrend. But I doubt it will be on first try. Would happily see my short tight stop loss go off.
I agree. The issue is that shorting at different stops along the way was also the right thing to do according to charts. It's easy for me to feel confident considering I have longs at 6.6 and 7.9 open, but I'd be careful. If I had been stopped every time on the way up here I'd prob sit this one out. In fact, it's prob a great place for me to close my longs, but I'm taking a new approach of making less trades for larger profits instead of shorting and longing multiple times. 
I agree that a short at the log resistance looks like exactly the right thing to do, BUT if we do push through I believe it will shoot up to $9k and beyond very quickly. Bull flag forming at the moment so looks like we'll be making the attempt within the hour.

Personally I'm holding onto my long and moving stops up to $8,400 in case we dump to keep majority of my profit.
It's probably not very distributed at this point. If it continues to move up like that I'll start trying to evaluate how authentic the transactions on that chain are and determine if coins are becoming more or less distributed.

Could be a good time to start selling BCH for BTC again.
Nothing to see here, just got shilled by Fast Money and CNBC yesterday. 
Sellers are retracting because why sell at 900 when it's going to 1100 without resistance? So you don't need much buy volume if there's no selling, simple. If everyone's convinced the bullmarket is back, fundamentals / technicals / indicators are overriden really.
Its the name bitcoin in it..just like BTG. BCD, BTCP...people are blindly throwing many at it lol
Use it as an indicator for the BTC price

That's what I have been doing, very profitable.

Adding to my longs just as BCH pumps because BTC is sure to follow it. 
Google trends are inconsistent. Just like how the number of Coinbase apps installed doesn't count. A lot of people already know about bit coin or use the app. It's a big red herring and can't be used as any sort of indicator.
Google trends for internet have fallen off a cliff since 2009, the internet must be dead!

People aren't googling about Bitcoin, because they already know.  That's what the push and media hype the first time crossing $10k did. 
Random shower thought, but I wonder how feasible it would be to inflate the google metrics with a botnet.
I posted a good theory for the pump that no one wants to talk about here: https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8dksw2/daily_discussion_friday_april_20_2018/dxp35rc/
ETH/BTC lol
Short term? Looks undeniably so.

Medium term? Starting to look like we have some upside left. 

Long term? Nah, not until $12k is broken. Why that number? 60% ATH, that's almost exactly where all 4 corrections of 2017 hit bottom before rocketing up again. Blowing through it would be exceedingly bullish and put us in "healthy correction" territory again. 
probably not

possibly yes

All we need to do is hold above the log resistance, but BTC could hug the resistance line all the way down until we bottom out.

It’s all a question of when we see a pullback and how swift it will be
The bottom is very likely in for 2018, in my opinion.  I can still understand the argument that we are still in a "Bear market" though.  It really depends on what you mean by that.  If you are asking if you buy now are you guaranteed the price will only go up, the answer is no.  I do think over the longer term we are very likely to trend up from here unless there is some major regulatory trajectory change or a fundamental problem with the tech which is discovered.
Doubt it, basically you see downtrends and then a run up before it continues going down. It’s a good opportunity to “buy the dip” but this may be a sell the top.
No , we still see lower highs so expect lower lows.
The exact same could be said about the bears on the opposite situation
Maybe this time *is* different...or maybe not 
thats why you wait for price to stabilize without crashing, then you buy in. And after 1 cycle, you set your stop loss 1 pump back
Inexplicably low volume between pumps..
I'm envisioning shrimp and krill FOMOing in to enter under 8500 while whales are holding their fingers over the sell button to exit over 8200. Matches up with the shift in the buy:sell ratio on orders over 3BTC (moving towards sells>buys). I'm fully hedged in the mean time. Happy to close my hedge over 8700 or close my long under 8000. 
Shitpost with feelings but no meaningful reasoning. You can do better.
Wedge breakdowns suck for a multitude of reasons. Many times you could be inclined to just redraw the wedge.

If you aren't so inclined, it's annoying because the new resistance (what was the wedge support) is now ascending from the direction of the "break down." So any throwback is going to put you in a bad spot since it could break down a bit then consolidate then go all the way back up to that new resistance (now higher than where it broke down) to confirm it.

Not saying that's what happened here, I think it was just stop hunting since we're back in it.

Reference: http://thepatternsite.com/risewedge.html  
Notice that sky high throwback rate and poor performance rating.

One plausible scenario when the wedge actually breaks down is it consolidates a little below the wedge before moving up a little bit and then failing at the ATH resistance. That's approximately what happened at 11.8k.
I did notice this several times.. 
Let it ride. 
We just bounced off the trend line from the ATH, what do you think? 

Still not out of the woods yet though. Might try having another go at it but if that fails then you're in the money. Can you live if you have to exit @ 8600? If so, sounds like a good bet to make. 
I think you know the answer to this.
The fact you're asking means you're not 100% sure of your position...
The whales saw your post and thought it would be a good idea.
I doubt that 400M is much for bfx. But I like your shiny tinfoil hat.
Personally I don’t expect ‘buy bitcoin’ searches to go parabolic before all time high prices
Google trends are a lagging indicator, pretty useless for the short term.

Yeah, that must be all of the fake shorts ATH they have been stacking.

Oh, and you forgot to mentioned they introduced DAI, a direct  competition to USDT monopoly. Why would they do that? Hmm... maybe because all your points are bullshit.
Google trends is a trailing indicator, not a predictive one. If you're trying to estimate how many more retail investors are truly putting money into cryptocurrency markets, you're better off monitoring how the websites for the top exchanges move on Alexa and how fiat on-ramps like Coinbase rank in mobile app stores.

Re: Bitfinex, that's a separate issue I don't know about. That being said, from an outsider perspective, if they were strapped for capital, how would they finance a massive run in the market?
You have been posting this same thing for days.  Give it a rest. 
Remove your tin foil hat.
RemindMe! 2 weeks "Perma Bear bitfinex Conspiracy / Bitfinexed 2.0"
> Instead, the next day they reduced the capitalization requirement on their exchange from $10k to $1k and added 12 new altcoins to their platform

THEY DID WHAT?

How they hell didn't that make the news somewhere?
COSS just launched 1k capitalization requirements for USD. Could be BFX could be responding to market pressure.
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.ccn.com/bitfinex-implicated-in-laundering-drug-money-polish-media-reports/amp/

I'm guessing this is the news you're referring to
Wouldn't Bitfinex be violating some major fuduciary regulation by not disclosing a $400 million seizure? 

Edit: I know its a private corp. and not publicly traded, I am assuming as a financial service it would be liable to SEC (or the EU equivalent) regs.
Do you know why Poland confiscated the 400 million?
> capitalization requirement on their exchange from $10k to $1k 

What does this mean?

The google trends thing is really scary.

To put our current interest level in perspective, It's dropped all the way back to May-June 2017 levels.  But we're not at may-june 2017 prices and going up.
that's because although more people than ever know about bitcoin, no one is buying, there is no adoption by the masses
~~We need to retest 7500~~

~~We need to retest 7800~~

~~This is a head and shoulders pattern~~

~~We need to break log resistance~~

We need to break 9200 ?
Remember that time we topped out at 11.6k and then crashed all the way down to 6.4k...yeah, that could easily happen again.  This move up feels about the same.
We can never know. There are always bull traps and disbelief rally in bear market, just like we had dips and bear trap in bull market.
I'm not a bear but here is an argument why we could still be in for a bear market:

https://i.imgur.com/fvKuCXA.png

In 2014 we broke the log resistance, got a nice bull run, and then went down for a year to $200 or so.
We're still in a long term bear trend until we break 11.8
I heavily disagree with that being a break up. Atm it's still in the channel the flag forms.

Also refusing to trust a bull flag on the 5/15 min when we're butting up against resistance on the daily chart.

(Edited to be more excellent)

We are building this potential breakout pretty much purely on the back of ripple

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/pmV1uLC7-Bitcoin-Longterm-update/
Who's this again? 
Imagine how much Tether Bitfinex will have to print to prop up the price to 110K
We'll see. Could be a whale looking for a pump & dump... tricky though, so close to the resistance.
Yes of course.  What you said seems logical and rational, but you are not bullish enough, hence the downvotes.
You’ll probably just end up adding fuel to another squeeze.

We are awake? It's evening... 
Good morning :)

What's your entry, if I may ask. (curious)

https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#dominance-percentage

It's been a trend for a long time, and it's not a bad thing. Competition drives innovation and diversification/evolution of the market. If you're a trader it definitely shouldn't matter much, fuck the team sports the only team is team profit.
Have an upvote...fellow ETHbro refugee from you know where.  
I am tempted to do that myself.
Problem I have with alts vs. BTC, with BTC I can buy low and know that if I hold long enough, can sell high.

I don't know enough about alts to buy a 90% dip with confidence.

Also, don't you think that some of this alt moon-pump money will find its way back to BTC soon? BTC has lost 7% of the crypto market share in the past week or so (dominance down from 45% to 38%) :s
8913 and he got liquidated. Damn... that sucks man. This was 100x most likely
scroll down. comment says hmmmm
Thanks for explaining your reasoning :)
Diversify and assume the extra risk involved.
>this rally is horrible to watch sitting on the sidelines

We rallied 1.5k so far, that is not much, okay in &#37; it is something. But just remember that we made some of these 1.5k Swings within a day 3 months ago.
I'm assuming you meant 8500 on your sell and 8300 on your stop? 6300 is a hell of a stop.

Also, if you want a drop before a new surge through resistance, I'd be pulling for 8100, not 7800. I'm not confident 7800 would hold if we dropped there from here.
What happened last time
Long is long, so I wouldn't get too caught up on it, but it seems most people use it to refer to margin. Otherwise they typically say they bought back in, that sort of thing.
Sorry I know newb question... what’s a 1x long.. 2x?  I’ve seen folks reply at 75x long... wha what?
Now imagine a white vibrant unicorn running alongside a magical lake, take a brief stop -- and drink out of the lake with a few thirsty licks.
I've done the math: If we have an average gain of $100 per day for 3 years, I can fully pay off college.
If this is truly how you feel then you're free to stop antagonizing at any moment.  One doesn't have to scroll very far to find you trying to pick fights:

> Bulls are getting awfully cocky in here.
than

Seriously though, I've blocked so many annoying accounts that I mostly only see productive posts with the occasional new account that posts nonsense. 
Use a bigger timeframe and don't trade this. Besides, i still see an ascending triangle, with a fakeout. 
Exactly. And there is not very much volume!
If it’s proportional, then you wouldn’t need to remove 3 decimal places... Any two numbers are proportional to one another
Thats just you guessing. 
>flag part looks more like an ascending triangle, what determines your price target?

It's a bull pennant then.

And I'm not quite sure what you mean, price target once it's broken out of the pennant?

Anyway, triangles, wedges, and flags have all been unreliable for completion in a particular direction let alone their targets.

In any case, best one can do IMO is study the trend lines and key resistance/support levels to manage R/R.
> what determines your price target?

A coin toss
so far yes
Question answered - I think it was a cryptowat.ch glitch - order books are now refilled
Why do I hear this about literally every 100 dollar increment. 
you close your short?
https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8dksw2/daily_discussion_friday_april_20_2018/dxoaxvx/
8650 right now (Stamp). Finex at around 8700
I have two lines. One unmodified after 11700 rejection and one after. Both are two-point extended lines at the exact top of the daily candle highest in that region. The unmodified is at 8207 and the other is at 8530 on the 1H chart and 8230 and 8550 on the daily
Don't panic. We haven't even been pushed below 8450 yet. 
The question to ask yourself there is where to put your stop losses in that scenario? 

The stop loss for the short seems pretty straightforward (somewhere above the log resistance line: maybe $8700).

But at what point would you be confident that we're seeing a firm rejection from the log resistance line? Probably not until below $7,800. 

That's a whole lot of risk for the long with very little reward (because you could always long the breakout above $8700). 

So from a strict risk/reward sense, a long here is incredibly reckless and a short here is relatively safe. 

That said, even though the *rational* approach is to short here, I'd simply stay out of position if I were in your situation. 

If the downtrend continues and the market drops below $7,800, then there's likely to be plenty of opportunities to short. 

Will they be the ideal short entry? No, of course not. But they'll likely be pretty solid. 
It almost never is worth it opening at the same place. You want at least $150+ between entries if you do that. Even better to get the top and bottom of a channel/wedge. Probably not a bad idea to hedge balances (trading stack/cold storage) though--it's what I'm doing personally. I have a long open from 6410 and another open from 8280, but I'm higher leverage short for the same amount from 8520 until this picks a direction. Any movements are a wash for me currently, except for fluctuations on premium/discount between swaps and futs. I'm leaning up, still, which would be better for me (long futs, short swaps). 
In my opinion this strategy is a waste of time unless you're hedging an already open position in profit. 

Don't do it if you don't have a profitable position already or if you're in a loss. Your best bet is putting up a stop buy if you fear missing out or shorting the bounce if we fall below 7.8 or so and give strong indication that this was a bull trap. 
I have both open, but I opened the long like 4 days ago and the short yesterday.  They have a healthy $500 spread between their entries.  The long is taking profits in a ladder while the short is building its entry in a ladder.
Retail is busy getting rich af from other coins actually ^^ Looks like no fuck is given really
I vote 3.
They are telling you 75% chance of up
I don't think 3 is very likely (certainly possible though). The other three are all essentially toss ups to me.
You need a scenario where we follow the log resistance as resistance-turned support.
the price can go down without any volume if market makers lower their prices
Longs and shorts are measured in proportion to position size (in BTC). A long of 100 BTC and a long of 10 BTC are not the same value on Long:Short charts.

The price can decrease as longs increase if people are selling BTC without using margin.
It means someone is selling lots of coins that they didn't borrow from the exchange. Not everyone uses exchange financing.
I would argue it’s a good thing, if you’re a holder. If buying pressure were very low compared to selling, we would have bounced right back already. It’s putting up a long fight in trying to break resistance, at least.
It could be accumulation, or distribution, bulls waiting for the perfect time while cooling the rsi, or bears saying come at me bro, lots of confirmation bias today.

My take is a blast straight to 9.2 but just because it's very sunny since one week and I'm in a very good mood being 30% up on my fiat longing something.
It's really good until it isn't. And then it's terrible because we bounced off the resistance. 

Otherwise it's really good. Assuming we can punch through it.
Everything's gonna be ok.
https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/OHlO0FS4-Fractals-gonna-fractal-To-11-7k-updated/

was this it? 
In a real bull run it can remain overbought for quite some time.
After the run up the past few days, a pull back is inevitable. The only question is how much.
[deleted]
How many times does a bart have to occur before traders realize the winning strategy is selling on the pump and before the dump occurs? Bitcoin has been barting for a week now.
As long as there's no panic and dips are seen as opportunities and being bought up, not in my book
I mean didn't you say weeks ago that whales controlled the entire market? I feel like you basically said you expected this
it's bullsh#t
Terrible advice. Holding has its merits but there is no honor in holding on the way down if the signs are obvious (not saying this relates to the current situation)
RSI is hot right now. Don't be surprised if we drop back below 8500 for a bit or go sideways until it cools off. 
Historically, yes. 
Depends if people go from BTC to fiat or BTC to alts.  Probably more of the former, but as long as there is enough of the latter they'll sustain... at least temporarily.  (I'd actually expect alt dump considering most are topped off again)
I think so, *the* green dildo makes me think the bear market is over, if the bear charts don't break when it crosses in 2 day. The bull case is looking very weak and we all going to sadness.
70 coins is a wall? lmao
What wedge are you seeing?
Something something major resistance?
9k*
BGD time
By that logic there was “literally nothing to warrant” the bear market. Market confidence ebs and flows - do you think price naturally stagnates in the absence of specific new developments?
There are people who feel positive long term about the prospects for Bitcoin and it's price.  Saying, there is "literally nothing" to warrant another bull run is literally one of the most ridiculous things I have ever read.  Do you really not understand any of the reasons people might be buying Bitcoin at these and higher prices?  I don't want to write a wall of text, but if it would be helpful to you I might be persuaded.


I like listening to "The Crypto Investor" on youtube, very reasonable guy. He's not a crypto fanatic by any means - instead approaches this all from the mentality of a trader and market analysis perspective. He thinks Bitcoin and the crypto markets are in a giant, classic market bubble.

Moreover, his overriding thesis is that the market drop from January to now wasn't a bubble popping at all, just a hefty correction. Bitcoin is still in a massive bubble. Trade and invest accordingly.
If you sold for more than zero, then you didn't miss out.
The only time to safely nab the alts is at the bottom. You can easily get your ass handed to you with pumps and buying at the top.

Unless they're top 20 coins, maybe, possibly. It's easy to miss out but you'd be saying the opposite if BTC was rejected at 8300. Remember how r/cryptocurrency was calling for Bitcoin to be detached from alts, it was that severe and ugly.
My prediction is, today's altcoin rush, will be tomorrow's bitcoin absorption. 
There are new opportunities every day.   No FOMO :)
Alts are a hot potato. You do not want to be holding it. Be thankful you sold out at whatever price you did.
patienceeee    ~1 month
[no](https://www.tradingview.com/x/NYCDIKKa/)
We peaked above (resistance line ) but we need to maintain momentum and stay above the trend. This feels alot like 11.7K rejection atm imo. If we see a raging hard green dildo up past 9K then I will consider the trend broken.
I've got two versions drawn, and we broke the lower version, but the higher version we've only wicked above briefly.
to me yes
Ehh maybe try stocks or other safer investing plan then?
What dumps? That guy is out of coins, and other bigger guys want some.

Or is the sentiment around here still, "Stochastic fibonacci fractal on the 30-second candles! Great time to short, amirite, fellas!"
It's not sustainable. Everything is overbought.
The Bitfinex short:long ratios for XRP are currently:

XRP/BTC
708,311:10,737,196
(1:15)

XRP/USD
9,542,706:59,678,367
(1:6)

That doesn't seem sustainable.
One things about XRP is that it always recovers very well.  
Don't forget the whales.  They'll continue to DJ this party.  And the party will continue well past this weekend.  

(New to this? First big miraculous Bitcoin rally you've really experienced up close?  Well, the previews are almost over, and our feature film will begin shortly.)
Yes.
Doubt it. Just some much needed consolidation after that run. I'm currently 100% bitcoin and going to set a wide stop loss at 8070 and hopefully wake up to some good news. 

Cheers gents.
RSI can't go >100.

edit: wth 3-word post and edited
> consensus

You must be new here.
Wow, incredible insight. This has definitely never been said before, ever. This is 100% correct and will always be profitable, too. Definitely not confirmation bias either, I'm sure you've kept track of every single time the majority has been right and aren't just thinking of the few times it's very wrong.
> Any bears out there left?

Not me. I'm right, not left.
They'll strike when you least expect it.
55% bear, 45% bull checking in.

You've seen The Renevant, right?
Almost turned bullish for an hour or two yesyterday thinking BTC would realize the bear is over and catch up with alts.

But then, no.
the fact that they put the word miners in quotation marks does not help me trust their opinion
I personally can't understand how the bottom can't be supported by mining profitability.  It must remain profitable for the system to function.  It's predicated on it.  People are getting less and less reward and are mining against more and more competition.  I'm not saying that your linked analysis is spot on, but I would think a correlation must exist.
Funny how confirmation bias works on the brain. I see way more bullish sentiment in here than in recent memory
Don't be a meanie unless you're prepared to eat crow on a 10% drop from here (i.e. where we were 3 days ago)

That said, with BTC losing 7% market dominance in the past few days - I can see a tiny bit of money coming back to BTC to shore the price up somewhere near here
Rule #1, please.
What are people winning by eating shorts?
no but this will obviously capture the eye of people sitting on the sidelines and real life genuine FOMO is going to start pouring in slowly from the outside. 
Right.. this is just strange now
Obvious move by whales to liquidate shorts, and as a byproduct create fomo.  But whatever, I like seeing the moon kids have fun for a little bit.
nah, people are bullish AF right now for sure man
[removed]
At the risk of breaking from my normal calm, cool, and collected character:

ya'll motherfuckers are overtrading the shit out of this tiny range. 


You can't overleverage here. You'd have better luck fomoing on a real bgd or brd.
Short? I shorted 1/3 of my stack on theis little blunce above 8500, but I also feel a small drop coming so may look to hedge
“No one got hurt taking a profit”

Secure it, brother.
Nope, would be a pain in the ass because it means bears get rekt for nothing :( 
i wouldn't complain if that happens perpetually.
Not sure what you're talking about, all my alts are up today and yesterday.
I did the same yesterday. 
Every last one of my Alts is still out performing BTC by a decent to very large margin.  I've increased my worth in BTC by 40% the past week and continue to today.  Have held a large amount of AMB for awhile and it has really paid off of late. 
5k may be a bit low.. but i think we see the 7k again.
Also i think a lot of people have set stops, so once it drops hard, liquidating the longs and triggering some SL we cascade hard.
Woah please do not, there are people who will gladly talk to you and help you. Money is not worth those thoughts.

tel:1-800-273-8255
Don't do it dude. Just fight through the emotion, life is greater than stupid fucking numbers on a screen. I just lost a shitload myself I feel your pain
Bro... suicide because of 150k? You can make that back working!

How much of that was lost profit?

We could go down to 6k again, but it sounds like you need a break bro

Be safe
Dude. It's just money. Where did you get that $200k from? Explosion of Bitcoin price? 

 Easy come easy go. 
Soon after the BCH flippening.
Being a bear is just as dangerous as being a bull at the top. Suicide is most definitely not an option sir!
So many visual metaphors available.
When alts go down, it is good for Bitcoin.  When alts go up it is good for Bitcoin.  Ummm...ok.

And the price moving higher is never a bear trap.
We've gone up ~25% in just over a week without a retrace, not really a typical set up for a bear trap
You know you don't need to post bear trap every small dip.
These micro dumps kill my soul.
Some people here have a Roger Ver fetish.  That's cool, but keep it in your pants.

BCH was way oversold and the market says it should be higher...and now it is.
Remindme! 1 week. Dont think were out of the woods just yet.
I didn't seen higher highs , only lower highs, expect lower lows soon.
Name any coin with strong "Fundamentals" and please explain what those "fundamentals" are
Imagine a bunch of marketing types tried making another internet in the early 90's to profit off of it. They weren't engineers, they just "copied code" and couldn't hire the great engineers to work on their shit.

That is what we are seeing today with cryptocurrencies. Follow the engineers. For example, some Bitcoin engineers went and worked on XMR to fix their security holes.
I've been popping in a bit all morning. What do you need me for though?

I've been long since $8,130, since risk/reward favored a long over a short. 

Longing right here and now is super risky. 

Longing in the upper $8,000s might be less risky if the market gets there, but there's likely going to be a pullback at some point sooner rather than later... So I probably wouldn't advise that. 

If the log line breaks, just be patient and long the next 5% to 10% dip. 
You can't make decisions on your own?.. uh wait, ^ checks username.
he's long from 8180
Short it and find out.
It's just you. There's nothing to currently indicate we're headed lower.
Don't mess with it. Let it play out. Momentum to 11k will be strong now.
Press play FFS
Lool
Still holding that $3800 prediction?
Can you elaborate?
I think it’s possible we’ll see a new low in the next 2-3 months.

Noobs love alts though
'First we sell them the shit....'
they're up 20%

IN 2017 there were days where alts were up 100%
Because they inflate when BTC goes up and the sat value stays equal. That's the joke the "alts need to decouple from BTC" gang doesn't get. 
Bet it goes sideways and does exactly what you think it wont. Kinda kidding but not really.
So it'll either go up, or go down? Got it.
up or down . got it
BCH up 18%, Ripple up 20%, "the trend being enjoyed" has nothing to do with any fundamentals. Good luck with you BCH gamble but you are in the wrong place to evangelise.

Rule #1 for at least the second time in the past week. Putting you on a two day break.
Leave people to trade how they want ~  why antagonize?  Why try to alter decisions if no opinion is asked?
kind of missing the good old bart..
I EAT MY TONGUE
It's organic this time.
Just set a stop on 8610 and sit back. I wouldn't add to that until 8K falls. 
Holding my **x3 short** from 8505 very comfortably, with stops just over 8700 for some wiggleroom. Just going to leave it open and check on it tomorrow.
Taking a loss x3 really instills some confidence that your short was the right decision 
You're going to lose everything. Rule #1 - don't margin trade. These exchanges are wash bucket shop. They can add anything to the database to wipe you out.

Also, we are seeing the same pattern as last year. I sold at $3k to buy back in at $4k and sold at $6k to buy back in at $7k all the way up to $20k. We are in a bull formation. These exchanges are designed for one thing - to take your cryptos away from you.
That pattern is usually only valid on the 1m chart
Upon the 9th death, a cat shall grow angelic wings and fly upward unto the heavens.
because dominance will possibly never go back to how high it was. Lots of new money entered this market with no intention of supporting or sticking to btc
If it traced all the way back to 8.5 immediately I'm not sure I'd want to refill
Lol, it's still going, just shot past 8800
wait what? We're up like 3-400 in 30 min, still running, and you think it's underwhelming?
... are we looking at the same exchanges? 
bulls climb the stairs...this 2% at a time is one stair at a time. Also, it just hit $8800.

Yeah don't worry about it. I finish my studies this year and start working. It's a lot to me now but it's a life lesson and I'll make it back and maybe buy some more when I feel I'm ready ;)
Thanks, good luck to you too and cheers for all your contributions to this subreddit :)
Most likely a long. current week market behavior has been really convincing for me personally
it was a x25 leverage position.  liquidation was below 7950, could be considered risky by some since it was right on our big support channel. but the fact we remained above it for over a week convinced me we weren't going to visit this support again in the short term.
yeah, makes you think twice, but i guess that is when you go contrarian...
I think it's bullish if you just think to yourself "I'll make a profit as long as I sell before they do" 

but yeah, big players probably can't push this past $12k. 

I guess they could wash trade though 
I don't really think this is in preparation for a massive dump, it seems to be a push to get us out of a downtrend and incite FOMO imo. Whoever is doing it clearly wants us out of the log downtrend, I don't think they would suddenly dump if the bait doesn't stick. That would crush confidence and they seem to want to spread bullish sentiment.


Maybe a dropoff?
Even whales have their limits, id guess theyre just doing what they can to judo throw the momentum of the market in their favor. They cant sustain buying pressure on their own forever, but given the trends of the current market theres either the option to artificially inflate buys to cause a crash or push through resistance far enough to pull the tide with them. This a very mixed signal market right now, gotta play it by ear and remain vigilante
if bank accounts frozen, how do they pay for the "pump"?
Yup, probably. No real sense in standing in the way of a possible 4th rejection at the log resistance line.
It's a very short-term formation, and the market didn't make a whole lot of headway to the upside following the breakout. 

So I wouldn't put a whole lot of faith in it.

Even if it does hold, it will converge with the long-term resistance line in less than 24 hours. So you're basically pitting a formation that's existed for less than 48 hours against a resistance line that's held the market in check for about 5 months.
That does paint a more bullish picture, yes. 
That would put us [here](https://i.imgur.com/sKagNB2.jpg) if I'm not mistaken.
C/D is what they believe we're in right now. 

Doubt it since the graph posted in OP clearly shows pullbacks BELOW the resistance line. The BTC graph example has rebounds above them, not sure if that's one of the criteria required to validate this pattern, but it's something to consider imo
He's suggesting we are in c
I think he just made a plan to sell and now is regretting it 
Lol naw just making a joke. I'm still grossly overextended into bitcoin but the price is marching towards the "should have just held" price. 
Yep. 50x, got bored.
Oh, it's more than that, a good solidity Dev is like a unicorn.
This is why I think the same way OP does... This bubble saw all the individuals who wanted to invest directly in crypto jump in. The next bubble will consist of people who would never own actual bitcoin, but would invest if it was an option in their broker sponsored portfolio, IRA or 401K.

Basically, it's institutional money that I think will drive it. It's the people who, during the last bull run, still weren't sold, or saw it as too risky.
I should have specified, all the conversations are "how do I get in" and "which coins should I buy".  I think we're just now starting to reach a maximum awareness level which will lead to a new higher number of buyers next bubble.
I don't know about people around you, but I saw many around me who desperately wanted to buy but they got shocked about the difficulties of acquiring it. (Exchange hack risk, exchanges closed sign ups, Security risks, Taxation complications, Cold storage creation, etc). I would say 1 out of 10 actually bought and the remaining 9 missed out because it was "not that easy" for them. These people will be back once we are on the next all time high, this time with a better infrastructure, more tax advisors, easier tools to secure your coins, etc. 

And we haven't talked about institutions who were interested but had legal and technological difficulties getting into crypto. Those 10-20 hedge funds already here are just the tip of the iceberg. It is not a surprise that no one gets excited during a bear market. It is always that way, loud individuals never buy when the price is cheap.
I know someone in HI who just found out they can't get an account at any exchange, including Coinbase. (~~Apparently AZ is out, too, at least for CB~~.) So I suppose not everyone who wants one has one yet.
Fair enough. Would amend what I said to say we *could* wrestle with it all day.
I had this in mind coming into today.  My thought was, if we're going back down, it would be a quick, violent rejection.  The longer the price hangs around the resistance, the higher likelihood we break through.  
Nothing technical about it, just how I felt it might play out.
That’s what sucks about trading BTC right now. We haven’t had this type of action in a while yet the indecisiveness in the air is unreal.

What’s your next move? 
What’s TUI? I even googled it. 

Apparently it’s a bird from New Zealand that eats honey 
TUI?

Yup.  Short term trend is up.  Trend since $20k is down.  We're still in a bear market.

In the short term however, anyone trading should have their eyes glued to the downtrend line from $20k 
We're definitely going to hit the line... it's all about action off this line that'll decide direction shift... and that may take a few days to sort (i.e. we may get rejected only to retry in a day)

I'm only trading the break up with a long... or shorting if we move below $7800.. which is a fairly big range ... sidelines in the interim 
haha. Deff bull. Just tried to trade the breakout with caution! I like you too man... you aiight
Well, the point here isn't that the resistance line is invincible. Merely that the risk/reward is pretty strong for a short here. Significantly better than it was last night at around $8,200. 

Anyhow, it doesn't particularly matter if the market breaks above the resistance line in a "healthy" or an "unhealthy" way. As long as the market gets it done. 

However, if RSI is overbought — or close to it — when the market is hovering just bellow the resistance line (as it is now), that simply decreases the odds that the market will have the momentum necessary to break through. 

A "healthy" breakout is generally a stairstep approach up to and over the line. Up a few $100, sideways with some downward spikes, up a few $100, sideways with some downward spikes...etc. 

Which is actually what we might very well see here. 

Drop down to $8,000 or so here. A day or so of sideways between $8,000 and $8,200. Back up to $8,500. Then down to $8,200, sideways for a bit, and finally bust through.
the point is there's a chance it breaks up and not done...in which case you don't want to be a trillion times short.
Can you draw that 3-month log line? It should sit on top of the 4-month log line.
Since when alts on full bull are preventing a breakdown? Did you miss what happened in late 2017 and how alts were just a few weeks ago?

Alts state means nothing to what BTC will do especially when you see BTC up 3% in 24h and alts 20+%

I'm not against alts, got a lot in my portfolio, but your statement isn't true
Not exactly, since liquidated shorts on Bitmex are placed as limit orders, not market orders. So they wouldn't necessarily move the futures market up considerably. 

If the premium does start to balloon, however, it is true that open short positions would be falling all over themselves (aka: market buying) to exit before their liquidations hit. 
Aren’t stop losses not recommended on things so highly volatile ?
And 'I don't trust this one, fools rally' 
Even at $1000?
I think that's was common knowledge. Look 11.6k. or 7800.
> I'm definitely reconsidering. 

Sloppy you are indefinitely considering. :p

> bitmex is basically unusable. 

Bitfinex is much better. 
Lol
What do you see the price of Bitcoin to be in say 5 years time.  10? 
In other words, if as long as ETH holds its own S3 level, I feel very good about BTC doing the same -- just a matter of time.  S3 is THE major support/resistance line.  And ETH has shown to me to be very reliable as a leading indicator for BTC.  S3 has all along been the main resistance/support as to whether a bull market would start up or we continue the bear market.  

EDIT: ETH looking weak at resistance, BTC probably following.
Eh, wouldn't say its back. It's at 16.8 via Vix, which is still pretty sideways if you ask me.
Not logging into the exchange and leave the postition open.. yes sir!
Probably because it has no other way to get past it than to get past it.
It could just as easily become a supportive downtrend. 
Trendlines are a very weird and nuanced topic, because you need 3 points of contact to verify the validity of the trendline, but the 4th point of contact is often likely to break the trendline due to exhaustion, which puts you in the weird philosophical conundrum of questioning whether there was actually a trendline in effect in the first place!
I've been wondering, if we blast through it wirh high volume it would be seen as market confidence m, but what if we just go sideways and it gradually crosses like nothing happened? 
9.2 and 9.8 have become pretty established resistance levels. I think right below each of these is where you'd do it. I'll also be watching those closely to get a better idea of how strong this reversal is in general, I'd be moderately surprised if we crack 9.2, and be like damn this is fo reals if we crack 9.8.
We'll see if/when we get there, but there's undoubtedly some downside action due. I'm dividing the year up by quarters: down, up, down, up. Lines in the sand of course, but the first and last quarters will see the most movement imo.
In the past, yes. 

But this time feels different 
The whole world gambling.
There has been some massive buus over the last weeks. Great volume in my opinion. If a trade isnt going in your way then its manipulation or unsustainable? Perhaps stop reading magic poop cannons posts so much. Everyone is wrong - i have been wrong more times than right. The trick is to pick up that you are wrong and re think. Dont hold onto a trade.
What's a BGD? 
why are you so salty? Bitcoin dumps hard sometimes with no news either, i don't see you crying about that, just chill my dude

My stops are alarms, not actual stops.
And when central Europe does, and when Eastern Asia does...  Confirmation bias IMO.
 Thanks, and yeah an 8800 stop buy is set (small amount to join the fun) for now
If only I weren't on my mobile :(

But I'm sure it was similarly violent, if not more so.
I’m guessing this is UTC?
Yea, and because of this I'm getting my first fomo itch I've had in a very, very long time. 

It's not a particularly great time *now* to buy or long but I'm starting to think shorting may not be as smart as just waiting with an unhedged hodl/trading stack, which really might be the smarter move here. 

Who knows, though. I don't believe in the run long term so it'd just be another long term trade. I just think it's possible this blows past $9k and tries at $11-12k again
But in a way, it's still better to just wait and see. The "haha traders will be left out" meme is not a real thing, that's just a thing holders tell themselves because they do not understand that someone can make 10 swing trades, miss the breakout then enter when it's confirmed 10% up and still be far ahead
Yea I'm going to have to conservatively stick to my stops here, for once. But yea the risk reward is pretty good I think.
You are a long term holder rather than a trader so of course you disagree my dude. 


People have been opening shorts since 6.5k, if there is ever a good time to open one (patient trader like me bide my time), it is now.
I'd be curious to see an updated version of the chart.
I didn’t say we shouldnt see 10k soon, I think we will, but I think we’re overextneded for a break of the log resistance today to be honest
Agreed. I just can’t see it happening today
probably is. just being careful
Big green candle I assume. 
We were goxxed back then.

fair enough, but it's not everyday that you flirt with a 4 month downtrend
Are you still short from 8200-8300?
There's a reason lines need 3+ points of contact and there are rules about wicks, etc. 

Anyone that thinks TA is 100% bunk is simply ignorant or willfully blind. 

This green line has been locked on my chart for 45 days: https://www.tradingview.com/x/hRMzynJ2/ and https://www.tradingview.com/x/ri3xCYYf/  

A lot of people trade on TA. Trading TA is a strategy. Charting TA has rules. If you have a way to preemptively know what a large population in the market is expecting and/or planning to do at a specific point, you're gifted excellent targets for low risk and high reward entries.

Why wouldn't you take them?
Why close here? It's right at resistance. 
or verge or tron or ripple....

The only flair should be Ric Flair
"Bulls be smart", and your answer to that is about bears and their comments...
> trade craefully like I'm not.

I love this. This is what I'm telling friends / family from now on.
Apparently you have to wait for confirmation first that this is actually a reversal, that basically means you shouldn't buy in untill we have seen a 6 month uptrend. All those coins that are getting pumped doesn't really matter, play it safe. /Bear logic
Because it is, I mean seriously why are people on a fucking trading sub spamming those hold and all traders fail memes? 
good risk management imo

And how have alts boomed? They’re up 50-100% in 2 weeks and barely up at all for the month.

Why are people forgetting about the fact that this could be a dead cat bounce???

Are you all new?
> I'm more flabbergasted by short position here

You probably would've been flabbergasted when ETH was at $1440, too
This time it's different 
literally the same
That's right! I was just talking about this the other day. For some reason 585 seemed to stick too. 
>	your trade is already liquidated...you just don't realize it yet.

Spooky ⚰️
Captain Buzzkill over here :P
Let a man dream!
I think the green dildo is significantly different from the barts and it was 6.8-8
Catching the wick on that $7900 rejection on 4/18 would have been a  perfect 100x long.
Done. liq @ 8411.  Don't think it would matter if i push it any lower, and it would require me to add margin.
Madlad!
Well before.

Usually it's around -60% or so for a 100x position.
And don't forget about trading fees.
I opened a 100x long... and then I closed it :)
Of course it is, I heard there is this new Bear OG strain it's been smokin' lately.
What I've learned over the past week is that 'major resistance' means fucking nothing. When the whales want to pump through a major resistance they will just like they just did through the long term log resistance. 
Glad you'll "consider it" at 13.5.
Hold my beer
Was really temped because i'm up 77% right now. But since i'm only 20% invested i will wait this out a bit more. Support is amazing, and we might remain on the current level for a while just like we did with our climb to 8.2.

Will put a stop at 8.4 so i still take decent profit in the event of a big downpush
Sometimes I think looking at the charts too much or drawling too many TA lines makes me delusional and clouds my judgment 
Day trading is hard, swing trading is a tad bit easier 
Definitely, it's similar to bank roll management in poker. You shoot for something like 20-40 buy ins for the limit you play in, if you fall below that you go down a limit until you work up your roll to that amount again.
I feel awkward longing after a 23% run up 
The 19k+ ath?
In general it's very bad to follow another trader, you do not know their style, timeframes, risk limit and so on and do not have their emotions or psychology
If the market does break the log resistance line, it's unlikely I'll be making any substantial trades for the foreseeable future. I'll just be holding my existing long as well as my cold storage coins.
I was profitable 11/11 first trades and some of them I followed chew
Hey, I saw your post that got removed regarding OBV. I mostly use it to identify divergences, however, I recommend talking to https://twitter.com/CRInvestor because he uses as one of his primary tools and can answer your questions with bit of authority. 
Thanks! So cool
That's good to remember, I just hate that this such a potentially volatile juncture.
No, I'm literally long when I say I'm opening a long position. 

And technically flat when I say I'm opening a hedge short position. 

I'm 5x long with my trading stack. 

So effectively 1.5x long with all my cold storage. 

Nothing crazy. 
Ah, was going off memory.  I thought he was holding a position.
I'm fairly sure he's long on margin. He's technically always long unless he's short. When he says he's long, he's longer than his cold storage. yes /u/_chewtoy_? 
It pisses me off. What should've been a small loss, turned into something more. Gotta set those limit orders $50 away from the stop trigger I guess
It's my fault. After putting up with Kraken's failing trading engine for 9 months, I moved to Bitmex, and now Kraken is ok and Bitmex has taken over as lead crappy engine.
Long from 7530 👍

I just don't quite understand the mentality which is confident enough to push through the ath resistance but doesn't think we'll be higher in 2 months
Then why aren't people selling coins?

They sure as shit are selling futures.
April 6. I mean isn't it weird its been that long and nothing's come of it yet? Bitfinex shutting up is the weirdest thing
Actually you're right. Volume's not that terrible.

Oh shit, were gonna be REkT 
lol both sides are spamming the subreddit right now. not just moon boyzzz
[deleted]
Since we all think this we need to go one level deeper
Perfectly possible. We've seen several of those.
didn't say it was overbought or above 70, just high as it's been since ATH, at around 62 (but depends on exchange you're looking at)
We had enough buyers to reach 20k, why wouldn't we have enough to reach 8.8k?
this is what everyone is missing

it doesn't make sense, these massive pops

it makes sense only if this is a massive manipulation in order to sell
Any proof of either of these 2 things or just pulling stuff out your ass? 

I look forward to your knockdown argument. 
The guy who owns the bitcoin twitter account is the same guy as before, he's been around since 2009...

Found the r/btc zombie...
closed my short before, see my comment history, I am in fiat.. not buying here... good luck.
Yeah it feels different cause futures are STILL below spot.

They should be at least 1% above spot with this movement. Shorts should be getting paid a king's ransom for this movement but instead, longs aren't having to pay anything for easy upside.
Does the first chart count as a wedge since price breaks above that resistance line for a week?
If you prefer social capital to financial capital...then persist with your perma-x policy
my football team is better than yours, just admit it 
>  TA-wise let's wait until at least a break of log resistance before calling other people out.

This is fair. I guess me calling for people to admit they’re wrong is, in a way, me saying that option is still off the table - which it’s not. I should’ve been more careful with my phrasing there.. I apologize. My question should’ve been: at what point do you all admit the trend has *potentially* broken?

What I’m getting at is that it seems people are acting as though a retrace must happen and 6k must happen. On top of this, the ceiling for a potential reversal/bullish indicator (for some reason) keeps getting higher everyday according to people’s TA, yet the 6k target stays the same.. 

This is what’s bothering me. A lot of “it’s healthy for bitcoin” type sentiments. Just making a friendly reminder that bitcoin doesn’t have to follow the collective TA (and I apologize again if I’m beating a dead horse). 
lmao bruh I'm sitting here reading this entire thread in disbelief but also am mildly amused. it's absolutely amazing how quickly the market and this sub changes sentiment. Half of it is because there have been virtually no significant pullbacks. 

people basically feel invincible right now and think it's going to go straight up (which, really, it could)

I'm actually very surprised, two months ago I laughed at the thought of people FOMOing in at $9k.

 I mean I really literally said "will anyone really be FOMOing in when we break ATH resistance line at $9k in April?" and I genuinely thought it'd be ridiculous.

but here we are...

the sentiment really does feel like $11k again 
ouch dude
Yea
Lately it's been a complete shitshow. I think it will fall out (we're a tad overbought and it would make more sense to correct a bit before attempting the log bear trendline), however I'm not holding any position right now.


Agreed
Mine is Coinbase
same
Damn. I think I need to start lower
At the very least I'd say to move the position over to the June or even the September contracts. Take profit now and buy the next dip on either the June or the September futures. 

As we've discussed, they're still perplexingly in backwardation. If they start trading in contango, the rise in premium would move counter to the funding fees, correct? 

If the price is moving up, one would expect to pay funding fees on a long on swaps. Whereas the premium should rise for a long on June/September following a major breakout. 


Nice
This is what I would do. Your entry is great. You should try to keep it for if this thing can break the log line, but reduce you risk in this area.
Well said.
Thank you I hadn't thought of that, the movement from 1000 to 1500 is far more Sig than 10000 to 10500.  I appreciate everyone learning me a little.
So from what I understand, the reason so much stock is placed on the log resistance line is to identify and validate the trend, i.e. to know whether or not there is enough buying power in the market to make a bullish reversal (despite log resistance itself being an indicator).

Is my interpretation correct? If not please correct me.
And the TA technical post of the week goes to....
Thanks for that simple explanation. I'm just a cowardly HODLer with a minuscule stack, but I love reading this sub and just learning about what the hell the market is doing. This sub has taught me so much. Thanks yall!
Timescales don't really come into it, time is scaled linearly. It's the prices that are scaled in log
Thank you, it just seems arbitrary to change the scaling and then justifiably expect the market to respect it, but just like any TA I suppose it's valid through self fulfillment of respect amongst traders of said line or pattern.
good assessment 
I trade exclusively on mobile
I too frequently trade on mobile. 

Charting on mobile is an absolute bitch most of the time, but it can be done in a pinch if I have to. 
Is it possible to keep it in fiat on there?

FTFY

It wouldn't be very comfortable.  But to each his own.

Can you ELI13 that please?

You mean something related to the snowball effect? (When an asset is worth 100, going to 110 takes a big effort, but when its 1000, going to 1010 is just 1%)
I think your last eqn is wrong should be 2**n
Thanks
Good explanation!
How is a hidden order fraudulent? 
What? How is a hidden buy wall fraudulent?
I was on the half bear/bull side.

I literally couldn’t just get myself to hit the Buy button when bitcoin was up nearly 23% in a week. 

Time to take a break and wait for a no brainer trade 
Think most underwater shorts have more conservative targets than that though, such as 7.8.
To another speculative bubble? That'd have to be the *shortest* bear market after a major bubble in history.

Bear markets last *years*, not *months*. So realistically it would mean the bubble never ended cause fundamentals haven't even remotely caught up to this market.
We're going up over a half percent a day. That's unsustainably fast.
So many weird conclusions drawn in this comment.

The first time we hit 6k was off the initial crash down from the 20k run. The market tightened, and still is tightening. Obviously the run ups would be lower. You're describing the exact down trend triangle that we've been in since December.

Secondly, any evidence a single whale is market buying 2k coins a pop? Haven't seen this mentioned anywhere. I have no doubt large players are playing market maker games, but there is also natural buying pressure on the run ups as well as the consolidation periods. 

If you are waiting for 12k to call bottoms, you'll have missed out on a nice chunk of profits. Personally, the long term log resistance trend line is my indicator. If we break above 8600 with conviction and close a daily candle there, I'm calling bottom and a reversal. I imagine a lot of the market will be thinking the same. 
Been over an hour since the pump and buyers are still sitting there seemingly not knowing how to act on it. Makes me really doubt this.
From BGD 6.9k to 7.8k and on, they for sure have.
My teeth 
tether and bitfinex being super sketchy still gives me serious pause
I agree with this.  We are working on an ever faster time scale.
I've heard they all said this in 2014, btw 
I like big bottoms and i cannot lie.

That applies to the world outside of bitcoin at least. I hope it can be applied across disciplines.

I wouldn't be surprised if the price were being suppressed the past few weeks like people were claiming. If true, that would explain the huge bounce. Let's see if this can hold over the weekend/break $9200. If so, you have gained a new bull!
Can't talk now. *frantically counting chickens.*
it offends me that you don't want me to count my chickens. i like counting my chickens.
Guess I went a little overboard. /s
Not a use case regulators care for at all, though. 
It's certainly looking good, but it's not without risks. 

I was expecting another drop and some more consolidation before a break of resistance. 

Advising people to buy now would be reckless on my part. 
if nothing else, this will be at the top of the controversial sorting
Probably

Because of these.
The phrase "I have little doubt" is aggravating, and fair enough. Even with a link to charts, it still feels emotional.

This sub is one of the last meme-free bastions of actual trading. No politics, no "what is the real Bitcoin" no "I analysed the entrails of a chipmunk I just ran over and we gonna moon".

The merest hint of: "It's gonna moon, I feel it in my waters" is quite rightly discouraged.
Too many got liquidated 😂😂😂
There’s more permabulls/bears than rational traders who adjust to the market accordingly. Get a post that states a strong bearish or bullish sentiment and the opposite side reacts negatively. 
I must misunderstand you.  You opened a short at 8530 to close at 8430 for $100 profit? That's not even a 2% gain.  And then you have a 4% stop loss. This means you're risking 4% for a >2% gain.  Let me know how that strategy works out for you in the long run.
Regulation in this industry does little to actually protect *the people*, which is the purpose of regulation. Regulation won't save your BTC in a hack, or protect you at all. It's just about giving more information to Big Brother. Careful what you wish for.
Same me too, I agree that it will allow for mass adoption.

But... Smaller news than this has caused dumps in the past.

I'm long at the moment, just hope the buying pressure stays.

I am monitoring the situation ;)
Probably not the best place to open a long but goodluck nonetheless. Look for a better entry if we correct or CA your way down (if we correct, which is likely imo).
> they're the ones that push us up

What the hell?

And you went to this conclusion because...?
Well, it didn't yesterday did it?
Agreed. Was thinking this too. It's just saltiness in my books.
hmm, maybe people are losing faith in the asset going upwards for any sustained period of time? I mean, considering where we're at, it really isn't that unreasonable.
because we are in a bear market still and my TA is saying we could have a dump soon. we're close to very strong resistance and the buy volume is not convincing me, so i'd rather protect myself from a dump. 
 I really dont think so.  Buy orders are \>90&#37; of the market. Percentage wise, more of the top 50 BTC addresses are  increasing their stacks than decreasing, that hasnt happened for a long time. Alts are topping out because BTC didnt decide where it is going, so does the sat\-value of the alts and their price. We arent even getting close to 8,2k anymore let alone below that and the latest "dump" that started 40 minutes ago has already been eaten up. I mean its possible that we dump but it doesnt look very likely considering the sentiment lately. 
It's also Friday, which tends to mean sell offs if the week has gone well (and *vice versa*).
Or profit taking occur to btc and create buy pressure 
Yeah mine got far enough away that I closed them, and I will manually evaluate if/when we get back there.
ahem ahem.. Big Green Dildo.


big green dildo. look at the 1hr chart on april 12.
big green dildo
Agree. Talking about risk management strategies would help all our portfolios a lot more then taking the side of a bear/bull, although i do get sucked into it aswell sometimes.

Its like people here think that downvotes and emotional posts here will influence the market, but really its just being selfish and may lead to people taking the wrong advice.
what is wrong with this place? I have no clue why people are being so partisan
I mean, if you're going to use that analogy, I'm all for cancerous growth... That means it will never stop growing and never die on its own...
If you put it like that I think I'd rather a BGD.
lol, came here to say this
Someone is messing with my mind!  But as I am long, yes I am happy. :) 
Yeah, I might be splitting hairs...it just looked like when we did wick above the ATH resistance, that was the line we bounced off to drop back down below.

Interesting....I guess it is just people buying magic internet money and maybe there is no right or wrong way to analyze, just various versions that work better for some than others. Perhaps in this case it is too many looking at the same thing (for BTC) causing a self-full fulling prophecy of sorts? IDK, when you explain it and he does they both make sense. 

Thanks for the feedback, quality content as always.
You make a great point about everyone shorting it because they're expecting a bounce. Seems like a really great opportunity for the market maker to do a short squeeze again, which could give us a nice green candle to smash us through it.

Honestly if I were playing this I'd start with a small portion, and a stop around 9030, not risking more than 3% of my stack, and add as/if it goes down. 
what's your play chewie? Looks to me like a hedge isn't a bad idea
In fact, it's very good for a different thing. Predicting the strength of a trend. Gets it rejected hard when it reaches oversold or overbought levels? Then it is weak.
you are right, but the long downtrending line here and almost one week without a real down day also makes me think this is not so bad position. 
Regarding RSI, the daily RSI has been below 60 since January and seems to act as resistance for any reversal attempt, including this current run. 

Any reason to think this current move can break through? I'm doubtful because the previous ones had more volume and momentum but were still rejected at the 60 line.
https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/ascendingtriangle.asp

EDIT: I don't believe in the 10k target, and I'm pretty sure this won't go past the log line. Also it is probably not very valid as there was no reaction low at the beginning of the formation, but maybe that's what's getting the bulls hopes up
Sometimes ascending wedges can break up. I'm not sure but I think this is known as a 'running wedge'. I have a funny feeling about this could be one, no TA just 'feels'. Still got a long open from $8,020 with a tight stop at $7,990.
So everyone is willing to throw their coins on shorting futures but nobody's actually willing to *sell* their coins?

Something something hoarding. Something something bubble.
Um...I remember having to pay interest on my long during that period...
-.-'

Interest rates aren't matching all of your "fomo". The point is something is *very* wrong with this market.
It a always a good time to sell BCH for btc
LOL what? BTC is surely following BCH?  

What in the actual fuck...

Do you realize that BTC moved from 6.5k to 8.5k and bch followed this?  

Wrong about Google. People don't search for "bitcoin" once. Someone who is in bitcoin will oftentimes search it everyday. With keywords like "bitcoin price", "bitcoin news", etc. These keywords never get old and people will constantly search them whether they know what bitcoin is 1 day or 5 years.
But that's what you want to measure. That "lot of people", in relative terms. I do say, money that is not aware of Bitcoin already, is much more likely to buy than money aware of it for 1+ year, considering everything that happened during 2017 ("blockchain is the future"). 

I think we would need a fundamental change to attract new investors. LN could bring that once it's fully working, or an ETF, or more clarity in the legislation about Bitcoin. 
Even if that's true, Alexa is reporting declining traffic to the exchanges.

Searches may not be a valid indicator but site traffic is.
Is it possible that Google Trends is essentially more of a reactive indicator since the increase in price would draw media attention which in turn would get people searching the term more?
Most people I know barely know the word Bitcoin, much less understand what it really is.
I swapped out of my ETH at 11%, where exactly is your ratio at right now?
Was about to type the same thing, but thank you for doing it for me :)
[deleted]
Or maybe it's neither and the price will stay here for months!

There, we covered all the possibilities.  We did it reddit!
How long do you need to see before calling it "stabilized"?
That's all of the people that are still short hoping for a crash then fomo'in in when it starts spiking again. 
why arnt they exiting then if its over 8200 now huh?
Where do you get this buy / sell ratio data?
Shitreply with no meaningful input
yes you are right I should wait a bit longer, could higher my short entry with a few scalps here. Effective short entry 8420 now. 
I think nobody knows the answer to this :D
If you are 100% sure of your position then you're delusional, even if you end up being right.
> 100% sure of your position...

Nobody ever should be? That's a great way to lose money. 
Yup this is how I feel about this too. Seems a bit Bitfinexed Fanboy to me. 
It wouldnt even be there money. It would be whoever they seized it from.
Well, it is a lot to the users that can no longer withdraw USD from bitfinex. For bitfinex it is nothing. It was all clients money.
isn't that what it did last bull run? in fact it went parabolic well before it hit the ATH
You're right, it's a lagging indicator.

... But it's still dropping.
Alexa also points to the same. That is declining exchange traffic. Google may be a trailing indicator, but not a 2 week trailing indicator during a 70% bull run. There has never been a 70% generalized price increase in crypto and had a 2 week delay in google trends and even had declining search volume.
Meh. Just look how ppl market buy on coinbase in fear of missing out, that's all you need really.
Seriously, you need to be more astute and skeptical. We are operating in a space where my guess is that 50% of exchanges, ICOs, etc, have exit scammed, been "hacked" (including bitfinex itself), or went bankrupt and people lost money.

If there is any market where you want to wear a tin foil hat it would be this one. A lot of people would have saved money that way.

well, I think it would take a bit longer to add 12 new altcoins to their exchange, that was a planned move long ahead. 
The Altcoin thing overshadowed the change in capital requirement.
What does that mean?
It did make the news, check their Twitter.
I can't find anywhere they changed the capitalization requirement. 
[It's not in their announcements.](https://www.bitfinex.com/posts)
Yes, that is correct
how can regulations apply when they are packing their bags and moving to Switzerland
Bitfinex did not disclose it. Poland news media disclosed it, but they did not disclose the virtual currency exchange affected. No one knows of any other exchange, other than Bitfinex, that utilized that bank and could have $400 million dollars. Those involved are believed to be laundering money for the Colombian drug cartel. Bitfinex has no fidiciary responsibility to anyone other than their shareholders. 

When the news came out, Bitfinex said on reddit they would make an announcement to calm people's fears that it was not them. They then deleted all their messages and deleted mentions of it from /r/bitfinex.
Colombian drug cartel money laundering association
They need more fiat, and lowering the requirements will allow people who didn't have  10K to sign up now
It is also scary because "bitcoin" represents something like 5 coins now. Any search for "bitcoin cash" also counts towards the "bitcoin" keyword.

The trends data from last June does not include multiple coins. Only bitcoin. So my point being, it is actually worse than it appears.

People will say "But people already know about bitcoin". The 1 search someone uses to look up "What is bitcoin" pales in comparison to the hundreds people do daily looking up "bitcoin price", "bitcoin news", etc. So, really, it is not just new entrants it measures. It is the number of people watching or caring about it, period.

Yeah. People are pretty short sighted if they think this couldn't end in 3k or worse.

Hush you with your logic and rationality. That's not welcome here!
Well, there are certainly ways to draw it where it "broke up"

https://imgur.com/a/8YVptmF

But come on now, let's be realistic here. It's a formation that can only really be drawn on the 5m chart. 

It's more likely than not that the market will continue to bounce around in the $8,400 to $8,600 range and create a more compelling formation throughout the rest of the day.
Price broke sharply up from the apex of the flag; don't get semantic.  Whether it will lead to maintaining a break of the weekly resistance level, this step has to occur at some point if it was going to happen at all anyways.

Nice
I don't really care about the downvotes. I come here to get feedback and see other people's analyses. 
Have you seen shorts, though? They have barely moved at all. Longs have also stayed the same, roughly, so I'll concede there really could be new money entering the market. We'll see in time.
Well, I figured 9pm was late enough to call it a day out there. ;)
My last three entries were at 8102, 8190 and 8240. 
find some alts with a strong team who's been involved in the cryptospace since the early days.  Marry this with the coins that solve for the problems and bottlenecks that still exist in the space.  I'll provide some examples upon request but I don't want to start shilling coins.
The 100x greed.
Doubt it was 100x. 

That's still roughly $50,000 even at 100x.
Not sure if folks at that level are playing around with liquidation at 100x.
Much better off using stops. 
Not quite the one but it works, thank you
First, its not the same to win 1k at 10k , (10%) , but at 20k (5%)  .Second, he probably is talking about altcoins too. 

What do you bet he buys the top? 
I was a bit gutted I missed out on <notanother24hourtimeoutpleasethankyou> but I could of quadrupled my money and bought a house in two weeks while btc went up $500

Shit coin, but people can be overly focused on bitcoins performance forsaking the others. The two are interconnected and stability in btc like this is great for other coins imho. 
Yes, thanks I fixed the typo. 8000 and 7800 are strong historical support, so I think if we retrace, it will be in that area. 
7800 would be obliterated rest assured
We tried to go through it 2 or 3 times, depending on which chart you look at. Couldn't bust through and went down
11.8K > 6.4K.
google margin trading

1x long is literally just buying.

x means you are borrowing the capital to buy 3x (20x, 75x, etc) more coins than you can afford if you were to just straight up buy them. You have to pay back what you borrowed but keep the total profits on the whole x amount (or incur the full losses).

It's not for noobs and it's not for the faint of heart.

quality shitpost, have my upvote !
Honestly, with some genetic engineering, your vision has a higher probability of actually happening in the next 50 years. 
In no way was I trying to pick fights.
It was in response to the wave of overly optimistic bullish posts and heavy downvotes against anything bearish. 

I still stand by what i said because its true, but you're right i shouldn't have antagonised.

Btw even that post you mentioned was drowned out by downvotes which proves my point.


Hi
it is practically the same pattern of the last time: https://imgur.com/a/0pXyvxs

bullish case: happened before. not gonna happen again.

bearish case: bearish pattern repeating.

i think it is wise to understand the W bottom as it might predict where this is going.
>Any two numbers are proportional to one another

lol

"If two amounts are proportional, they change at the same rate so that the relationship between them does not change."

The >=thousand's decimal place makes this relationship more clear for the reader.


Let's see if it has any basis in reality long term.
Thanks. Yep, once it's broken out.
It's been 2 minutes and price is still below 8500.  You are confused.
yea cryptowat.ch is terrrible lately. Just go to bitfinex.com if you're ever unsure. 
because everyone has different lines on their chart. I agree, it's ridiculous.

but $8500 *is* the diagonal downward trendline from ATH that everyone loves, though. You've only heard that one time before, and that was the second time we hit $11.6k
After the feb dump bounce, and in mid march after dropping to 7.2 before pumping to 9.1, 8500~8600 was a big battle ground going up.  In earlier march it was very supportive of denying sudden drops.
I was never short. 

I just get out of my long and wait to buy in lower. If I miss the mark I have all my fiat to just buy in higher. 

And I still have 25% of my long open. 

I won't really short until the trend reverses and we are doing lower lows and lower highs again

I am definitely prone to panic.  This is my inexperience.  So I have been trying to make a plan and stick to it.  It's hard though!
Hey Chewy - you still holding your long? I have a medium sized one on futs from ~7880, and a large one on swaps from last night at 8330.

 Thinking of closing the large one here, and setting some lower orders to grow my futures position should we drop.
3/4 move down before potential move up... but I've refashioned the chart to make this clearer...
Very possible... I'm more interested in knowing which resistance points people think will be broken 


Oh, I didn't realize.  So, for example, the bitfinex shorts is 26636 currently.  That is saying there is 26636 of btc currently shorted.  It went down approximately 500 btc during that recent period, and longs went up around 250 btc.  Still strange to me that there was a net increase in buying but the price went down.


Ok, that makes sense.  So, could one assume that "day traders" more typically use leverage, whereas holders typically don't?

If you accepted that assumption, then could we suppose that on average day traders are bullish over the last few hours while holders are bearish?

Not trying to be a PITA, just trying to learn.

Thanks!
I just noticed this reply, that's the one - and holy cow that's really funny. Thanks for finding it

Bull runs usually do not start this far below the channel/envelope on the weekly while the daily is over bought.  But this is Bitcoin.....
Where are you guys seeing a pullback in BTC, it dropped 20 bucks.
I don't really follow alts, just BTC and ETH. But I noticed EOSUSD pumping hard, up to 20% followed by ETH and then BTC gains. And just now EOS lost about 4% and we had a mini retrace on both ETH and BTC. For a second I thought down on alts -> pump on BTC/ETH but not yet.
Is it barting when the graph looks like barts hair?
According to Bulls it's 100% organic , these markets aren't manipulated whatsoever
The problem for SOME of us is that getting out of a HODL is a taxable event. Which means you may have quite significant implicatios how lot the price must fall to be worthwhile.

Also you inform the government about your assets.

In my case, for example, I HODL. Period. I buy and HODL.

Once I will prepare liquidation, I will move my residence a couple of KM for a year. The difference betwe 33% gains tax - and 0 tax. Up to then, I rather keep my coins in cold storage.

I read that as hysterically, but both words might apply if that happens.
Alts recovered way more than BTC on this run. I would expect them to crash more if BTC falls, maybe not quite to the extent they recovered from (they were *really* low when BTC was in the 6ks).

It may be worth considering people fleeing alts to fiat could be contributing to the sell pressure for BTC as well.
on gdax
the one which I mentioned, but got downvoted to \-5, because it was only on the 5m chart and then broke up as predicted. 
You weren't kidding
Nothing to warrant a bear market? Yeah, the growth we've had the past year has been totally sustainable...
The point i was trying to make is bitcoins growth the past 12 months has been insane and completely unsustainable. Going by history, when bitcoin has had this sort of growth its been followed by a massive pop, low volume, and a slow bleed.

Obviously people here are going to have different opinions and history doesnt always repeat itself but I'm not going to be persuaded by what an internet stranger tells me. 

I'm completely ready to eat my words if i'm wrong but the proof is in the pudding.

Worth noting that in a long term resistance line like this it's less a line and more a zone with a 1-2% range. Don't think we can say we've peaked above it yet
to me, BTC is still at $20,000 but I don't know that anyone else cares.
I will, my son. 
It is sustainable if its a new bull run. This kind of shit went on for weeks in january. But yea its not a new bull run so you are probably correct in saying it is unsustainable. I'm thinking about closing my short on BTC and just shorting XRP/BTC. If BTC corrects xrp will go down harder with it. But its risky lol 
I’m scared to sleep. 

Sweat dreams bb.
This. There is no way to determine what "consensus" is (except at very rare times such as the run up from 17k to 19k where the sun was overwhelmingly bullish).
By consensus I mean posts by those here regarded as deities, most seem to follow their word like gospel
Sloppy, I’ve seen some new levels of sarcasm from you recently. I love it ;)
About as incredible an insight as you "offer" on a daily basis.  

Funny you mention this actually though.

If you see back a week or two ago, you'll see I said I have been keeping track of the main proponents here, yourself included!  And will be providing a write up in due course.  To give you the abridged version, you in particular would be better off gambling on the outcome of price movements, as statistically speaking you would have had more success over the past 2 month period.  
Revenant
Yea I'm with you here. A bunch of articles came out today referencing that Morgan Stanley estimate of profitability so it rekindled something I remembered people saying all the way back in 2016 about mining profitability inherently needing to prop up the price of Bitcoin.

So I'm not saying they are right or that I know for certain whether $8600 is the number but if you look at that log chart of profitability, whatever metric they have been using seems to have been pretty spot on over the last few years.
Precisely. There's a reason I 100% hedged my long positions at 8520 lol.
Some Bart nonsense or something
I wonder what this cabal of greedy market manipulators everyone talks about do on Saturdays? 
> traders

Holders are bullish as fuck, thats for sure. Most day traders i've seen are making excuses left right and center to be bearish.

Tuna sandwiches aren't free, my friend. 
that's interesting. coming from someone who, in my opinion, overtrades.

hahaha.. sorry chew... I think trading only becomes really interesting to me when we're close to sea change moments 

I'll likely be back to trading the day chart once this next trade closes :)

Sidenote: I haven't been on Bitmex in 4 months and noticed it's *way* more laggy... geez
Who said I'm over leveraged?  Was at 3x and only $40k contracts.. small bet just to play here.  Nothing lost, nothing gained at this point
went short when the trend line broke...

Still I'm not feeling super confident in these trades as there is a lot of vacillation in this price range... but we're far above the lower trend line, and just broke down from the higher trend attempt at the log line, so am expecting downside for the very short term
What’s your target for profit? 
This whole range is tough to trade ... I'm sort of dipping my toes in and getting ready for log to break or get rejected

I'm preparing all big moves at the intersection of log trend

It's spelled 'Ethereum'.
Glad to see the mods out in action
Oo killem
No margin, just a simple old trade. Very small amount. 
We were in a "bull formation" from 5800-11.8K too. Still a bear market. Held then, could hold now. 

Also, if you want to just HODL, /r/bitcoin is that way.
Do you see this as bad/good for the future of btc trading or irrelevant?

You're young and will recover :) It sucks now but it'll seem funny in the future
I tried that shit with options and I just lost money... lol
heh. They’re bored
TRX is looking to launch its main net here soon, and there has been a blatant pump in the last month by some big players to get the price moving. 
There is always a big bubble before a main net launch. Would it be reasonable to assume that it will follow the typical pump trend before the launch when the market is looking to stagnate?
after thinking about it some more i believe the way these coordinated groups/whales would make the most money is to 1. open long positions at $x, 2. crush the order books and spike bitcoins price 1.3-1.5x while accumulating, 3. open up short positions at $1.5x, 4. proceed to dump everything down to $.5-1x, 5. rinse and repeat

someone correct me if this is what you wouldn't do?
agreed.
That's how they prey on people. When people get bored.
I don’t think you’re necessarily wrong - a lot of people around me absolutely were put off on this basis, but has much honestly changed to resolve this? Taxation is still a pain with bitcoin, especially as in many countries you have to pay capital gains tax even on transactions you make with Bitcoin, if the value goes up from when you bought it to when you made a purchase relative to the fiat currency in your nation.

To be fair, I don’t think buying Bitcoin could get much easier either - if you’re concerned about your exchanges your options are still very much the same as they were before - sites like local bitcoins or Bittylicious in the UK. 

I don’t think those people will be back at the next ATH - if they weren’t here for the last one, why would they come back for the following one? Sure, it may cement Bitcoin’s position as a reliable investment, but it also assumes that we actually hit a new ATH, and quite frankly, I think that’s pretty optimistic. 
I live in AZ, Coinbase works fine. Friend made an account last night. 
I signed up for kraken while living in HI.  I might have used a mainland address tho. I don't know what their requirements are now. But that doesn't help for getting fiat on
Agreed. I can remember when it dipped back then. The sentiment around the subs was very positive, similar to today. Many expected us to break through the resistance since the market had been so strong in the weeks leading up to it.
I told you yesterday, go long.

You gut told you to go short which is why you did.

Going short now is like going long at the top.

Just buy and hold, trading isn't for everyone.

Buy and wait for 2 days. 
my guess would be trading under the influence
> I even googled it. Apparently it’s a bird from New Zealand that eats honey 

Haha. Bro its 'Trading Under Influence'.


As long as you don't KAKAPO.
As said above. :D
My short from 8100 waits for that drop to 8000 (although i don't really believe it will happen ). Might close my small long here though. 
Thanks a lot for your explanation! Cleared up all my questions.
my lines slightly out of date but still what I'm thinking https://imgur.com/a/JYNSX
Sentiment is shifting? Alts bottomed out this time, nothing to do with late 2017
It’s not all about liquidations. People will place market orders to exit positions manually if it spikes, which is partly why it spikes at all.

Regardless, the natural “pull” is towards settlement price always on futures. Right now that natural pull wants up a little bit. 
I mean, SL are an important part of risk management, a lot of people here use mental stops and set alarms. But I wanted to sleep and besides at that point it was 50/50 what direction the market was going to go. Only reason I went long was because it was a better R/R and we had been bouncing from the 6500 for a few days with selling pressure diminishing. 

or maybe I will wait for the next significant market move.

It's called a "sucker's rally" on the classic bubble chart BUT it's not actually a rally for suckers. "Sucker's rally" is what the bears THINK it is but in fact it's the start of the next cycle, and the point where people who are excessively bearish start to miss out.

This is what is rarely emphasised about that bubble chart. It's not a start, bubble, crash, death chart. It's a single wave in a cycle that repeats and gets bigger over time.
Yes. But at that point we would have already crossed even more important support lines 1 guess
yeah sometimes I really do need to just do the most disciplined thing and listen to my inner smart dude. 

I started saying this looked like accumulation and that I was itching to close my short at $6.7k but didn't do it until later. Silly me. My brain is smart but greed and lack of discipline makes me dumb 
How much Meth did you buy at $1000?
Stop being so right.
Maybe short term. This downtrend line is months long though. If we break through, the risk of shorting is astronomical
Then TA will be confirmed forever useless and should be banned irl.
You mean....like it did a few years back?
The further we push, the more confidence grows, the more volume we get generally. No guarantees of course
entirely plausible. if it goes sideways from here crossing that trendline, I suspect the price will go up as we'll be establishing a support above that major resistance.
It depends on how long we stay sideways. If we are range bound for 72+ hours between $8,300-$8,700, I would argue that's consolidation and appears to be bullish, but does not indicate the market is moving into runaway bull territory (e.g. seeing something like $18,000 by mid-late June).
nailed it, although I'm still looking at 12k as the real point where we might actually be out of this bear trend.
It will be different, because the breakout of the ATH resistance and subsequent resistances would end the 5 month trend, but what happens after is a big question mark.

/u/_chewtoy_ wrote a good summary of "what comes next" yesterday, so I won't rehash it. [Here's the link to it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8dbx5s/daily_discussion_thursday_april_19_2018/dxmy338/)
What's different this time? Alts pumping? Btc fiat exchanges with subpar volume?
To specify, all alts going up, leading to mass speculation on a global stage.
Enough bad news , Bitfinex, and recently other exchanges, are still under investigation by authority's
https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/ag-schneiderman-launches-inquiry-cryptocurrency-exchanges
Because a few people , maybe 5 or 10 , decided we should see a higher price, but keep buying those cheap coins.
> a large pullback back to 5.9 to 6.4k.

Pardon me, I don't mean to be rude but, wake up lad!
You're so full of shit, and the worst part is that you're probably following an agenda.

And some people here will believe you and lose money, which is terrible.
I'm bearish but that's a pretty delusional forecast. There's no way we go to 5.9 just to bounce back to record highs lol. If we fall under 7.3 it's game over until 5k. 
No. Looking at historical data, grouping it by date-time, checking correlation between hours and Volume and then performing a t test to check the null hypothesis. 

P value was low enough to reject the null and suggest there is statistical significance. Granted I didn't do any cross validation yet. 
Correct (I'm 99% sure that's my default timezone on TradingView).
Find a good entry mate and jump aboard.
> The "haha traders will be left out" meme is not a real thing

This is more a disconnect in methodology that holders sometimes can't grasp. To  a holder the breakout and run is a means to an end to the end goal price target, i.e. the ups and downs don't matter when its gonna be X in X amount of years. 

Traders bread and butter is that which holders discard as noise, which causes this mentality. So it's both correct and incorrect in a sense.
I'm both a long-term holder and a trader.

I don't think we'll rocket down, and you do. I'm looking for confirmation that the log trend holds.
Now is a good time to open a short with high leverage and jump out at the first $50 drop. If you're looking for a thousand-dollar drop, wait until June at least, and by then it will only be five percent anyway. The three-month window for shorting has closed.

If I were a mega-bull, I'd say this is a perfect time for a little beartrap. See how much fight the bears have left and pick up some cheap coins. If I were a mega-bear, I'd be freaking out.
1500btc market buy on bfx would do it, I've seen worse (arguably less with shorts squeeze etc)
Thank you!
Bubble crash started weeks before Gox in 2014
We are goxxed again. 160k coins waiting to get dumped
No, I decreased position substantially at 8310 after adding at 8380ish last night, but I had about 40% left that got catastrophic stopped out at 8410. 


What?
no it just means if you didn't buy in earlier, you probably should avoid buying in now until a pullback + bounce or slowly start buying instead of buying what is very possibly yet another local top. 

It's really not very hard to understand. It's not like this hasn't happened 5 times in the past 2 months. 

Sure, it could work out for you. but smarter people here do not like buying the local tops. They'd rather buy on a pullback or on seeing serious, sustained strength
I’m long since 6500.

The time to long was then. Now it’s time to play it safe

/TraderLogic
It's good to be cautious for sure and a comparison to the previous BTC bubble shows an uptick around here, while Q2 has historically been bullish for BTC, even in the previous bear market.

But there's reason to be bullish, methinks, as we didn't break down below 6k. And as alts are generally in tandem with BTC, a lot of the alts are showing breakouts from ATH downtrends / giant triangle. Not saying that alts money will flow back to BTC, but it may serve as a positive indicator of the general sentiment. 




Exactly.

And here we are. Technicals - worse. Fundamentals - worse. But bullishness abound.
could've been a 3,000 or 4,000 CNY point, I know back then even CNY numbers were just as hard to break as popular US numbers.
Depends on which contract period you were trading, and whether you entered your position before or during the bounce.

June futures dropped as low as $7,675. Even a long at $7,750 or so (when the spot market was trading at around $7,850) would have been liquidated. 

June futures also overreacted during the drop from $8,100 to $7,925 on spot. It wicked down to $7,821. 

It's quite likely that somebody who entered a 100x long at $7,900 on the June futures on the 18th (so between $7,950 to $8,000 on spot) would have been liquidated during that drop as well.
yes and there are major resistances at every 500$
I've been through the 2011, 2013 and 2014/2015 bear markets.

Every time I thought it was finally done... I was wrong.

Fool me once, shame on — shame on you. Fool me — you can't get fooled again.
Absolutely, at a certain point the over saturation of opinions and analyses is more of a negative. I second the advice of a change of scenery for a little bit, there will be countless opportunity's in the future with crypto.
Agreed, it can cause one to look too hard for patterns when there may be nothing there. Recently I've been focusing on my strategy, but I had issues when the market would be doing different things, (bullish, bearish, ranging). I found that sticking to just 1-2 indicators (if that) and going off just general trend lines and linear support/resistance is way more effective. 

Sorry for the word salad, but I've only had one coffee this mornin' lol
Swing trading works amazingly until bounds dematerialize in favor of trend... which is why setting stops at bounds of the range is generally a good lose management strategy when swing trading

Right now I don't see any good swing trading opportunities as we approach the log resistance from $20k


I can recommend this book to all traders http://jaredtendlerpoker.com/mentalgameofpoker/
There's pretty bad risk/reward for any position here. If we really are rejected off the log line, we should eventually go lower than 6400. There will be plenty of great positions to enter short for that. If we break over the line, it's likely we're headed way up. Waiting a couple hundred dollars to enter on the way up will not cost you a lot in the long run.
Did you feel awkward shorting after a 23% dump?
Yes. Here's a [chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/RXqAWnzb/). Ignore all the minor stuff, the orange line is the ATH resistance line.
This is definitely true. 

You don't know how much leverage I'm using, how much of my trading stack I'm putting at risk, whether I've had too much to drink that night, how tired I am, how emotional I am, etc.
Well I'm sure I'm not the only one who really appreciates you posting your trades along with insight on why your making the trade. It has helped me immensely.
Is chewy a user here?
Thanks for this, divergence is about as far as I go too.  Much appreciated.
Sorry to hear that. Without letting them off the hook, writing a database backend to deal with spikes in volume like this when you can't use the normal hacks of eventual consistency or not worrying about ordering must me quite the challenge.

For the amount of money they are earning though they could just throw money at an oracle exadata stack and I'm pretty sure that would do it
Trader dominated marketplace vs investor dominated.  Technicals vs fundamentals.

It's not really that complicated what's going on.  We'll see if we dump because we "should" for technical reasons.  There certainly is effort from traders to work things that way.  Sometimes traders do gain control of the market in the short run.  Alternatively we may see that there is enough buying interest from longer term investors, hodlers, users, etc. to overcome the bearish trader sentiment.
They're still having fun losing money on margin. Lol

Once bitmex rekts enough people, they'll slowly start to cash out and we'll bottom out. Or there will be some major bad news or something
Atleast its not r/ethtrader style spamming
>redditor for 9 months

lol

Edit - I realize the irony of my account age, hopefully this fellow does what I do.
Nah man let the bulls have their hayday. Of course I want BTC to be high and alts also... But this is just not right and everyone is blinded w dopamine and nostalgia.
sentiment has to be destroyed before we can make a new low below $6k. Capitulation is fostered and developed over complex circumstances. 

If we get rejected yet again from $12k and head down to $6k you can bet your ass it'll fall through because no one will need convincing then 
People have to be starting to see through these mindless comments negging BCH....
Wow, you're right. Who uses dogecoin, and for what?
Merchant adoption. Not necessarily usage, though that's growing too.
Lol you have +7. Has everyone really forgotten what adoption means?
Peer to peer cash

Edit: I don't mean to make this an argument about BCH vs BTC. That probably belongs in another sub.
Yes, attack me rather than counter the words I wrote with an argument.
I don't particularly think you should close your short, especially if you've held it out this long, but from the past we've only ever topped out when futures finally begin to flirt with a premium. 

I think it's the "last to buy" thing. Once futures start sitting in contango, you know the last permabear has bought/covered and it's time to turn around. 

I still agree with you fundamentally and long term, but I have no interest in holding a short open to $10-11k again. I'd rather just watch and see what happens on very low leverage or even flat if it starts to act retarded. 
I wasn't exactly intending to draw them as proper formations...as I drew them, the 11.7K is definitely invalid. I just meant to highlight the similarities between here and there. 
Oh I'm neither bear nor bull. I just try to be short-term reactive with a trading stack. The people worth listening to on here almost all have long-term stacks in cold-storage as well.
I don't think many bears have moved the goal posts. We're currently sitting right at the line you're asking for, when it'd be a strong indication bear trend might be over. It's exactly where we were at 11.7k relatively speaking and we know how that turned out. If that had broken up it would have been substantially bullish medium and long term. But because we're riding that line currently, and haven't broken (it's not a simple line or a hard number like 8.5, but a zone), the r/r for shorting is very good. Similar to the r/r of longing at long term log support like we were at 6.4
You did exit your short, right? What was your final exit?

I'm long 6410 (small) and 8280 (medium), but I shorted 8520 this morning as a hedge (since I have no cold storage--my longs are playing that role right now).
lol, it’s fine. it was 1x lev. 0.17 damage. no biggie
Seriously, I'm sorry. That was extremely unlucky. 
Whales are active on finex. So the number could be more important  on that exchange

Correct.

The only problem with using futures is liquidity. If his position is of any noteworthy size, he can't get the liquidity necessary to move into or out of the position. Therefore he'd eat up that difference in premium gain almost immediately.
Think of it like this. 

The line is just a visual representation of the following:

"As time progresses, the maximum $ amount that buyers are willing to buy bitcoin is decreasing."

At the top, it was $20,000. 

A few weeks later it was $17,500

A few weeks after it was $13,000.

A few weeks later it was $11,700. 

Right now it *could be* $8,600. 

There's nothing magical about the line. Investors who don't pay any attention to TA have no idea it even exists. 

What's really going on is that buyers are becoming more and more skittish as time goes on, and sellers are becoming more and more emboldened. 

However, that narrative flips once we see buyers violating that pattern and market-buying bitcoin at levels higher than one would expect them to.

The line just provides a visualization to see where that narrative flip takes place.
Well, yes, but when you're looking at longer time scales you'll probably be measuring relatively larger percent changes for whatever chart you're looking at.
Are you also giving away money?
Kind of. 

You'd just open a short position equivalent to the fiat value of the btc that you're keeping on the exchange. 
[deleted]
That's a different wall. That dump was 700 BTC which included what he mentioned.
Me too. It's almost 600 now... and growing?
I was lagging and afraid the dump is coming. I see 480BTC again.
If the price is $100, a $50 move is a big deal. 

If the price is $1000, a $50 move is less important.

On a linear scale both look equal in magnitude.

On a log scale the second one looks much smaller.
lol yeah, typo. I meant 2-1
It's spoofing and forbidden by law.
Is there such a thing?
Nah, human history is definitely speeding up in a general sense. Everything happens faster now. People expect to experience several revolutions (of tech, culture, whatever) in their lifetimes.

Not saying this is the end of the bear market, but IF it is, it'll just be one more piece of evidence that everything is speeding up until we hit, I guess, the singularity or whatever.
The bubble hasnt burst because its still way too small, we didnt even reach 20% of the dotcom bubble and that was before the money supply grew exponentially..
Yes, and when we hit $6,000 we bounced HARD

by comparison this bounce is pretty weak and it looks to be running out of steam

Secondly, all you have to do is look at BFX to see that

I'd give it at least a week after the log resistance trend gets broken to avoid risk getting bull trapped by someone who obviously knows that people are looking at that line for confirmation 
i think a major factor is the lack of volume 

the only time volume happens is when there is a huge market buy to move the price up $100

regular buyers aren't really buying and sellers aren't really selling yet waiting for a higher price...but sooner or later there will be a sell off that'll give everyone the big red candle(most likely when shorters lose patience and decide to recover their losses by going long)
Faster time scale would be 8-12 months (which is what I stated). That would be 50-67% decrease in the post bubble bear market.

It's literally only been 4 months, however. That's just *too* fast, especially considering the shitcoin bubble peaked in January, *not* December.

It's wayyy too early for shit to be starting a new bull run. A real bull run should also start with a run up in a reasonable amount of time (i.e. month or two). This took 10 days.

Shit doesn't happen *that* fast or the stock market would make shifts like this as well. It doesn't, therefore this is most likely manipulation.
I take your point, but in 2014 a whole bunch of market participants were taken completely out of the game by MtGox.  It's arguable that 2014 is a confirmation of the theory, not a contradiction to it.  
  
It's so hard to measure market participation though so who really knows.
you other bears can't deny
wait what? Are you back?
Please start posting again. There is a lifetime to count chickens. 
I can never count mine. They scamper about too much.
Oh well
This is good for Monero TM.
Are you still looking to short 9.2? (Am I remembering that correctly?)
And "ignorant hands".  Very emotional post. 
Agree to disagree.  Look at my posting history.  I don't post with any level of emotion coming through in my posts.  We just broke through a major line of resistance and that makes me excited.  So if showing excitement is discouraged, I missed the memo.
Not true and not funny to laugh at people losing money because they had a different belief to you. Downvotes were due to the emotional tone and dumb shit said in OP's post.
yes but it may discourage or reduce bad actors, ie scam ICOs and exchanges. I think its a step in the right direction. We are very early still
Yes in this market people lose their minds the moment they see the word "regulation" 
Much appreciated! :)
Correction is "imminent" since 7.8k lol, I looked at previous rounded bottoms and they can go really high before doing so, could do something like 10k -> 9.2. My sl is an alarm anyway so can re-evaluate if it gets there.
alts have been gaining 8-20% most days this week, but we're not gaining much, it's just my observation 
Generally alt gains to a greater extent than BTC gains, and quite often occurred before.  Similarly, alt losses occur simultaneously with BTC losses, but to a greater extent.

We're down from 45% dominance a week or two ago because alts went up more than BTC.  Three weeks before that, alts were higher because btc was higher, ~41% dominance.
Exactly, so just because that... 
Saltiness? pls dude I bought in 100% at 6.6k, even posted it here. why would i be salty. its called protecting capital, since we are in a bear market. ill buy in  again when we break up properly and not just spurt up for 5 minutes.
Fair enough.
Ah, thank you. I thought it might be Buy Ga Dip. 
I think it's the alt refugees who are finally not in complete despair and don't want to envision a life of being so far in the red again 
But what if people start eating healthy? 
Not splitting hairs, I agree with you. We did hover in a very similar way just above this line on April 15/16, only to fall below it again afterwards. I would not be surprised if this were also to happen here within the next 24h or so.
Here's the difference between his approach and mine:

Mine: Violating the trend line means buyers are willing to pay more for BTC **than one would expect they'd be willing at this junction**.

His: Making a new local high means buyers are willing to pay more for BTC **than they have since the last significant bounce**. 

His approach is safer, and more convincing. 

Mine is more risky, but also provides a better entry point.

Honestly, I have a good feeling about this movement. I'm long from $8,130. 

The initial move from $6,800 was crazy strong, and the fact that there hasn't been even a moderate pullback since is pretty impressive. Albeit more than a bit concerning. 

Like I said last night during a discussion with /u/mikexbt, there's really no compelling reason to enter a short here. There will likely be numerous opportunities to short a bounce if this does turn south. 

For example, if this drops to $7,500, you'd likely get an opportunity to short at $7,800 or even $8,100 on a bounce. 

If you missed that opportunity, there's always a bounce from $7,000 to $7,300 or $7,500. 

Whereas if this skyrockets here, the premium on Bitmex futures *should* move disproportionate to spot and increase dramatically. So a missed long opportunity at $8,500 could result in having to open a long when spot is at $9,300 and futures are at $9,600. 

From a risk/reward standpoint, long has been the best trading opportunity since the last bounce off $7,800.

I wouldn't open a long right here and now, but I certainly would long the next major pullback (5% to 10%) if the log resistance line breaks.
oh ok, you said ascending wedge
USD 30 stop difference, you are the expert it seems. 
> nobody's actually willing to sell their coins

People are selling their coins.  Someone is selling them every hour of every day.


Not sure what was happening on swaps, but the quarterly was trading a solid 1% in the negative until $4,400 broke up. 
Ermmm and when was that?

Every day is different in trading and that's with anything so something that happened a week ago is irrelevant.

I'm talking about the movements over the past 24 hours.

I spotted this trend and shared it, and if you aren't so closed minded and have a look you will see it happen.

There's not going to be as much selling pressure like there is with BTC, just because of the volume difference.

Open both charts at watch when BTC gets close to its next resistance point. If it's going to break through then BCH will keep going up. 
i checked like every hour in december, now maybe every few days
Yet when Bittrex opened up again for registrations they were overwhelmed and had to close again within the hour...
Just do the maths for the last bull run.  

Some of us got in sub $1000, if we'd waited for google trends to tell us to long you'd have been jumping in about $7000 later. 
If they don't know by now they won't be the people pushing us back to $12k.

They will read about it again at the next A.T.H.
What do you mean took profit? 
if its a pretty flat line for more than an hour, I think its a pretty safe spot to get in 
Greed and awaiting confirmation of rejection or breakout. 
/u/arsonbunny had an informative post including this topic: https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8dksw2/daily_discussion_friday_april_20_2018/dxomnkn/

It's order flow / trades counter data. 
So would be better that no top level shit comment was ever posted and we wouldn't find ourselves here
So you believe that all the money that was needed to reach 20k just vanished into thin air? Maybe alot of people that pulled out were on the sidelines waiting to buy back in?
from what I can see of the subreddit statistics I can find, crypto subreddits have slowing rates of growth as well
Nor where futures premiums stayed in the red the entire run up.

It's why this entire thing has felt completely retarded as fuck. Someone's pushing the market up but the derivatives are all selling hard. So this market is likely being manipulated in some fashion.

Could you link the Alexa traffic data? Last time I tried using their site I just ragequit.
..... my opinions on bitfinex are tainted by that haircut and rather unpopular, but..... tether enabled very shitty exchanges, shitty extanages enable pump and dump groups, pump and dump groups are fraudulent and are making shitcoins have a price higher then zero; shitcoin bubble.

I kinda thought it was on accident the role that tether plays in enabling that; but if they are cutting out the middleman and are expanding their customer base. Its not accident anymore is it?
Ok, but that wouldn't be bitfinex's problem,it would be the Columbian's.  Other than a sanction for aiding money laundering. They wouldn't have any maniacal plot to make it back through market manipulation since it was never theirs.

You required 10K USD to trade on Bitfinex until the other day? 
Or they just upgraded their trading engine to handle more users.
But but but muh granny believes in crypto! /s
Hey, totally agree with you there.  We break 12k, I'm full bulltard.
[deleted]
Yeah that's essentially what I'm saying. Not trusting a tiny formation like that on a daily scale, going to wait for something larger to form.
... There's two other 15 min green candles with the same exact size as the one you have as "breaking up" on your chart...

Were those breaking up too?
Excuse me, I'll have you know I have an IQ greater than 160. Just because your peasant mind doesn't understand my intellectual prowess doesn't mean I'm wrong. I'm never wrong.

So anyway.... I'm allowed to disagree with his analysis and explain why I disagree with it. I'm not being iamverysmart, just using a bit of common sense.
I can afford to lose what I lost. Others can't.
Yes getting downvotes usually means that you said something intelligent and rational that a lot of people are really scared to hear and face for themselves.  The easiest way to get upvotes is just post some bullish bullsh*t that makes absolutely no sense but gives people "hopium".
> so I'll concede there really could be new money entering the market.

just big traders trading, more likely. Remember there are people who bought 1k coins at $1k and then sold them at $15k+. They have an absolute fuck ton of coins and fiat ready to do whatever they want to the price. 
> to call it a day

What kind of crypto trader calls it a day? 
Like Monero that has been around forever and hasn't bounced as well as TRON for example?

There is no sense in the alt market - it's casino gambling. I can only see very strong long-term fundamentals in 3 of them at most
True. I'd be sweating hard holding from 8000-7800 though. 
Imagine me and you, I do

I think about you day and night, it's only right

To think about the girl you love and hold her tight

So happy together
Now imagine a fancy little leprechaun hastily undoing his trousers to give his tiny pot of gold a tug as he watches what would be the height of his small life.
>Btw even that post you mentioned was drowned out by downvotes which proves my point.

Alternatively a lot of people are tired of what you're complaining about in this post and downvoting you for being tribal. 
The last time this happened alts were in freefall prior. The strength of alts now indicates confidence in the market.
True, but last time there was no accumulation phase in the 6000-7000 range, and last time alts were not rallying. 

If this is a W bottom with the lowest low at 6500 and the confirmation point at 7500, then the price target (according to investopedia) should be 8500, right on the log line.. who would have thought 
On the other hand, the other one was a double top, a failed cup and handle if you will. Which is also the same patter that happened at the reversal, here we have and Adam and Eve, which is a common reversal pattern.We also have the alts boom. And its also worth mentioning that the descending wedge formed seems to have very strong support, plus the very strong horizontal one at 6.5k. 
Not going to happen, unfortunately.  Some of us rallied heavily for this years ago, but bitcoiners are overall very conservative.  
Well, your target usually is wherever the next resistance/liquidity pool is. 
wrong
Its not anymore :\) we are hovering around 8540
Yup, still holding my long. It's moon or small loss for me on this one. 
I liked the old one, please change it back to lots of up arrows.

Its like your sitting down during a rain dance; do you want us to starve to death?
Ah I see.  I got caught up in the conclusions of 3 up and 1 down.
The assumption is correct as long as daily traders use more financing than swing traders or long\-term hodlers. I feel it's likely to be what is happening but we don't have the data to confirm.
50, but climbing back up now
Yes.
Basically a bart is a pump and dump or a dump and pump. Basically, a green dildo up, then chopped trading for some time and a red dildo down. The formation looks like barts hair.

If you look at the charts, it has done this pattern a lot the last few weeks. It is likely a pump group stop hunting margin traders.
I think we were just all spoiled by the constant volume and nice movement from October to November. 

no one has any idea where this is going so big players try to move it in certain directions now. Some of them stick, some of them don't. 
Rule #3, please. This is low effort.
That's because there's less liquidity in alts so accumulating them causes more slippage. Someone is accumulating lots of crypto.
I hope it was a wedge of lime to go with that salt
yup... smaller wedge... I rarely have looked at smaller time frames until now because we're so close to log resistance, and so watching smaller moves as they cascade into larger

In any case it was a small long just to play the game for now... upside on the break is massive... will short if it seems like a clear rejection
You: "Bear trends are real."

Also you: "Price reversals and bull trends are not real if I cannot find and identify a specific reason for them."  

There is no more reason for one than the other. The market price and market sentiment meet at different points on the curve due to millions of factors that you could never accurately measure or predict. Pretending like price movements in one direction carry more weight than the other direction is silly. It is foolish to believe that there is always an easily explainable reason that a Bitcoin is worth ~5% more/less than it was yesterday, even though it is a functionally identical asset.
Go through the history and check out all the times Bitcoin pulled back 50% or more from an all time high price.  Look and see how many days to make the next long term bottom and how many days it took to make a new all time high.

2014 is not the only data point.

If history repeats itself, what should the expectation be from here?
Good bot
I've been preaching this for weeks haha. People want a magic number, it's crazy. At $8627 at 4:00UTC ON APRIL 20 2018 BULL RUN CONFIRMED
Good luck mama
It's not sustainable if it inevitably drops hard. Markets can be irrational longer than one can stay solvent.
It's a good trade, IMO. Short it around $1.05. I am sure they will pump it that high. 

This is definitely a new bull run, but it won't last much longer. It already has 2 weeks. A long cycle bullrun like you talk about requires new entrants. There are not new entrants. So, it will exhaust itself and panic buying will flip to panic selling. Dead cat bounce.
lol that bgd up my booty made me cranky I guess
lmao what....what are you even tracking? you realize every random thing I post isn't me opening and closing a trade...right?

also...I shorted from $11.7k almost exactly 2 months ago, closed it about a week ago...so...how is that worse than gambling?

for what it's worth, I have *never* said I am a good trader, I've never asked people to listen to me, I've even said before that I don't know why people regard my input as any better than anyone else's. Your issue is with other people's opinion of me, not mine of myself. So please, leave me out of whatever weird obsession you have with bringing down what you think are the "deities" here. 

Creepy that you're doing a write-up on me...seriously. Please leave me out of your weird little report. I have never asked anyone to listen to me or trade based on my input. 
good bot
hookers and blow.
that really isn't true, but there is a really good bearish case atm
The hodler in me is happy, the trader is nervous. Would not be surprised either way at the moment 
I fucking love this new meme, by the way. 

But seriously, there's no sense in entering into any new positions in the $8,400 to $8,600 range. 
Just because an alcoholic tells you that you drink too much, doesn't mean it isn't true. 

If anything it's probably more likely he's right, since he knows more than a thing or too about drinking too much.
You ain't seen nothing yet.

Wait until the market moves more than 1% in any 5-minute span. The entire platform shuts down and only stop-loss orders and the occasional market buy/sell make it through.
Sorry I thought you were the guy yoloing at 75x. 
It depends how and if we dip. Starting to feel like we won’t see a bgd across the trend line, so no reason to take any risk tbh
I pay stuff in USD not sats.
Satwise mine arent that bad actually
Doesn't really matter if btc is going up. 
Fair, I just hope he's alright, along with everyone else who was trying to trade rationally. These alts are just too strong. See you guys at 9.2-9.8.
Apparently this has trapped me into shit posting with you. Nobody else seems to appreciate us.
Just looked like chop to me, sorry didnt mean to sound like a dick

IMO the remaining coins will be locked in court battles for years ~  and the former gox owner has stated that he does not want them and will push for even distribution(based on stacks lost) to people who originally lost...

The court ordered the original debt be paid and it has been paid.  The court will not order any more sales.
[deleted]
Good for you. I will leave the later part for you to wonder if you will.
He got downvoted for posting something factually incorrect. Alts are not up 20% today and there were no days in 2017 when alts were up 100%.   

Of course there are many days when one altcoin is up 20% and some days when one altcoin is up 500%.   But that's not what he said.  
L14dy has a fan club that follows him around just to downvote him, apparently.
even the bot agrees :)
if you are short you are margining by definition
For BTC? Not particularly "good" imo but it's not the worst thing in the world. 

BTC was never going to be the only digital currency ever to exist. 

It depends on how quickly the other tech and coins develop and are used. BTC will likely always have its place and an actual flippening would occur over a very long period of time, but imo this is the beginning of how it would happen. It won't look obvious at any point though. 

But flippening talk is kind of ridiculous right now
Im not feeling so bad about where I closed my short now. 

Hell I'm finally making money on being long! 
Oh sorry I think you misunderstood, I meant I'll make the money I lost back through working, not trading. It's not an amount that I could never hope to see again.
> has much honestly changed to resolve this?

Certainly not right now. Although exchanges upgraded their infrastructure, all other difficulties are still there, including what you added. I would say 1 year from now the landscape will be very very different, and that includes better infrastructure, transactional capacity, cost reduction, better legislative framework. There is a clear tendency of more and more supportive comments from the banking world and regulators. I expect taxation to remain shitty for the next few years, but at least after the tax returns of 2017, we will have a clear picture what to calculate with. (We did not have that 1-2 years ago in *most* countries). 

> but it also assumes that we actually hit a new ATH, and quite frankly, I think that’s pretty optimistic.

Indeed, a new ATH won't happen without institutional money. And that is something we have no idea about right now.

The beauty of this is that countries and competing financial institutions also have no clue about each others' intentions (Will they get into it too? Will I miss out if I just stay ignorant?). All we can see is some of them going all-in (like Switzerland, Japan, Estonia, Malta), some others getting more curious (like Russia with its ambitions to dominate mining, South Korea sort of realizing it has too many bagholders to simply ban it or leave it unregulated). Even IF the whole crypto market is nothing more than a gigantic pump and dump, its decentralized nature (on an international level) can still trigger crazy outcomes. Even an insignificant exposure from institutions would be enough drive us back close to recent ATH. We will have a clear picture 6-12 months from now, when the infrastructure finally enables larger scale investments. 
Oh, you're right! Thanks for the correction. It was [Wyoming and Minnesota (plus HI)](https://support.coinbase.com/customer/portal/articles/1826671-what-countries-us-states-are-supported-for-coinbase-exchange-). I wonder why I had AZ on my brain.
Yeah, AFAIK Kraken doesn't work with the US at all right now.
the run up to 11.7k was anything but strong and almost everyone in this sub was commenting on the lack of volume on the runup. 
Correct.
And so the merciless trolling of the bears begins. 
Its alright mate, I hope you don't get too hung up with this. For me, first quarter of the year was bad. I reflected on my performance, came back better and stronger. Perhaps you could do the same.
[deleted]
Totally. 11.8 has been the ultimate de facto make or break point. A break of that AND YOU YOLO LONG LIKE THERE’S NO TOMORROW (at least till 14-15 range)
If you want to make money in this market, learn that (I'd say) about 85% of the deciding factor in Bitcoin going up or down isn't upgrades, regulation or bannings, it's sentiment. 

For the people constantly looking to short, we dropped **FOURTEEN** **THOUSAND** **DOLLARS**, if you didn't make money short then, well.  If scalping is your game, you best be good at it for the stress this market will give you. 
Interesting. Would love to see a write up about this, would also be interested in seeing if this correlation has changed over time.

But it doesn't really change my trading strategy, volume can go both ways, and it's also worth keeping in mind correlation does not imply causation.
Wow the real deal?!  It'd be very interesting for everyone to see a dedicated post about this someday :)
That's the thing I don't like about these run-ups. There's not a particularly great time to enter. I guess I could've entered at $8k, but it was difficult for me to justify entering a long after a 3-4% pullback on a 27% move up...lol
[removed]
I mean I don't really think that we'll rocket down here either but I still sold. The risk reward favors it - you risk ~2% profit and potentially gain close to the best position you could be in if the ATH line *does* hold.

I totally understand not closing a long in profit either because it certainly *seems* bullish enough to break through, just saying that opening a short here is decent r/r no matter your inclination.
you might be right, but all perma bulls where just as convinced as you are now on every other time we tested log resistance lol 
yes, but if we see another bart, I’m going to sell a bunch of Crypto as a protest for this bullshit. Thats how we fucked up the ATH in December. Slowmoon please
FUD ALERT: We don't know for sure if those 160K coins will be "dumped" on the market. Chances are Karpeles will get them or they will be redistributed to the victims. And even if the court wants them all sold for JPY, it will be done OTC and we will never know about it.
Your probably right 
Nice recall! How much do you miss those days now? Almost as much as the December highs?
What happens if we bust through that?
/u/_chewtoy_ posts his trades and thoughtful commentary. He's a highly regarded contributor here.
Not just a user, a trading god.
Yo very welcome. He’s got some great, free tutorials if you bother to look. Check out the ta links on http://www.therationalinvestor.ca/sub_seminar.php

Brian is a really friendly guy. Tell him you talked to Tim aka grahvity (me). 
agreed. that sub is just cancerous
blinded by sheer exhilaration and fomo
https://imgur.com/a/EVmwUnE
fake outs with upside moves and then going lower, until we finally get real capitulation before we can rebuild 
He was asking for a source.  Maybe you can provide it? That would be the "knockdown argument".
Source on this merchant adoption?

I haven't seen any news on it and, to be frank, many merchants had BTC as an option for a long time. Nobody was using it to pay for stuff though.
Give the man the argument he seeks. It is an insult to leave an argument half argued.
What does Peer to Peer Cash mean?  Is that a project?  A second-layer solution? A source so I can read more about it?
Oh, I thought you meant something new. Peer to Peer Cash, just like Dash, LTC, ZCash, Monero... oh and BTC.

The things you are expecting me to say have been said a thousand times daily since a year ago.

Maybe you should do your own research outside of the echo chamber. That's why I visit different subs even if I do not agree with the narrative.

Actually futures have gone into positive territory long before it was moving this retardedly fast.

On the move back up from 9's to 11.6, the futures went back to positive before it even broke 10k.
I have to concur. I feel uneasy about the similarities also.
Appreciate this response. Addressed my concerns perfectly. Thanks for breaking down the underlying bear logic here. 
I like to say I hit close at $7400 (and I did, but...I hit close...not market) so I closed it a bit higher due to some bullshit on bitmex and sheer panic lmao
To be fair, there aren't a whole lot of people here slinging contracts around to the degree that you and some others are. 

liquidity on perps is obviously never a problem, and the slippage would be minimal for exiting a long/entering a short on anything lower than a 200,000 contract position.
Appreciate the above information, cheers!
True that.... but regardless of the timeframe, set charts to logarithmic
it feels very different than giving away money
Why is it called xbt on bitmex?
I assume shorting is like saying: Sell when btc drops to 8300. When it happens I have the amount in USD on the platform?
It was a joke cause they're not suppose to take you if you're American, but they do.
The price didn't get down low enough to touch it.
Seeing a buy wall but a few btc smaller than the pre dump wall
Understood
So salty
A lot of laws are stupid.
You're not really that stupid right?...
Trying to hide your intentions with hidden orders is actually the opposite of spoofing the market flashing big orders... It's not forbidden by law the same way dark pools are completely legal.
I just created it.

Welcome to my world 
The Dotcom bubble pushed the Nasdaq to grow around 5.5x from the start to the top.

Last year's crypto bubble was 36x. Bitcoin, alone was around 16x. Also, even by the end of the Dotcom bubble, there was still a shitton of grow in the internet going on, fundamentals just hadn't caught up to the valuations.

The cryptospace hasn't actually grown. More people may have projects but nobody is *using* them. You only actually hear about this stuff from finance websites or ICO papers.

Outside of that stuff, I still don't know anyone actually using any ETH based platforms or any other alts to do anything except gamble on the price 5 minutes from now.

Amazon may have been *massively* overvalued in 2001 before the bubble burst, but people were still buying books from them.
We bounced hard on 6k and as hard as we bounced, we went down again.  
I am not sure why someone would want that back.  

I'd rather grow a couple hundred bucks a day and be happy about that.  
Every time some crypto goes high too fast, it comes down fast again.  

Anyone who is comparing this run here from 6.5k to 8.5k to the run from 6k to 11.7k and saying this is the same - these guys have no freaking clue to me.  

Just comparing the daily charts, you should be able to see that this is different.  
On the run up from 6k to 11k, we didn't really build a bottom, no wonder we went down so fast.  

Here, you can clearly see that we're building a bottom at 8k.
I have high hopes that 8k will hold.  
Look up Adam & Eve double bottom. That happens with a hard V shaped bounce first (6,000) then a more rounded slower bounce (6,500). It hasn't confirmed yet obviously but its definitely on the table.
Hope that happens; otherwise this is as feeble as the March attempt was. "The little engine that couldn't"
you don't decide whats to early or isen't in a market.
The wishful thinkers are downvoting you.
That's why you count them *before they hatch*... duh...
I have no intentions on shorting in the foreseeable future. 
Sorry - I personally don't have a problem with your post. But I *imagine* some sensitive types perceive "I have little doubt" as emotive and thus the downvotes.

I think my point about r/bitcoinmarkets stomping moonbois to the point of excessive force, though, stands. Other subs are... less useful.
People are losing money because they are stupid and greedy with leverage trading. So no, they did not lose their money because of their belief
You're making me feel better about wanting to add to my long here and raise my CA.
Alts have always rallied the most when BTC is stagnant or consolidating. 
Not quite. What you describe happens sometimes. Alt gain more in the beginning of a bull market but once Bitcoin picks up steam, usually at the first sign of a trend reversal or continuation, alts will drop because Bitcoin is pulling the whole market up. 
LOL
m*sigh*
Have you seen Americans?
Thank you for explaining it like I am my 5 year old(which I am in this arena). Makes sense the way you said it there. In bold reminds me of my dad voice. :) 
Heh. I nailed this. 
Have you moved up your stops at all?

Also, are you considering taking profit on the long position and if so, at what level? 
oops, sorry! but I don't really believe in the formation, see the edit to the comment you responded to
It's not $30 difference from where we are now.
There was a 2.5 day period with negative rates from late Oct 3rd to early Oct 6th. Everything else around it had positive interest rates. Longs were paying for the rise.

Longs haven't paid anything for this rise. They've gotten a free ride.
Dude, do you listen or re-read what you write?
You're saying "..as BCH pumps because BTC follows it".  
So when BCH pumps, you add to your BTC longs, because this is an indicator that BTC will go higher?

Now in your next post, you're saying look at BTC and when it gets close to RP, then BCH will keep going up.  

So who is following who now?
You're calling me close minded when the past 6months+ have always been like this? 

BTC goes down, all coins go down.
BTC goes up, all coins go up.  

If BTC was still trading at around 6k and 7k, all alts wouldn't be this expensive today.


Yes,  Its a trailing indicator not a leading one. 
Right, but that's my point. You were saying everyone already knows about Bitcoin, but I say no, they don't. I do agree the next round of people who begin to learn about Bitcoin will be those who Google it after seeing it in their news feeds all the time again.

That's what happened to me last Summer/Fall... saw Bitcoin all over my news feeds and finally investigated to see what it was about.
[deleted]
You spelled weeks wrong
They'll probably wait for log to hit so it's why there's a drop.
no but you said they will sell at 8200? well just have to wait and see..
Everyone is a meanyface ;__;

Also I think this is how you get temp banned
Oh
Yes, that could very well be. And a certain % of them I am sure that is the case. Likewise, a certain % of people are happy they are finally in the green again and selling. The 70% bull run does not correlate well with exchange traffic, google trends, and the fact that 1.5 billion more people (india / pakistan) have been functionally banned from buying bitcoin.

The market potential is constricting (by 1.5 billion people in that case alone), transactions on chain declining, exchange traffic declining, and google trends declining. Yet, the price keeps bulling largely driven by bitfinex movements.
You're assuming that it was tens of billions that pushed the crypto market that high when it's more likely that under 10B moved the market there.

If that's true, 400M alone went to cash in the Mt Gox case and that's not coming back at all. At least a few whales likely sold and probably put a lot to most of that in other investments/places (diversification is good).

Realistically, most of the money isn't likely coming back.
Here it is for coinbase: https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/coinbase.com
Of course it is bitfinex's problem. The money is now tied up in an investigation. Even if it is one day returned to bitfinex it could be 10 years from now. That is a big problem if users request withdrawals tomorrow which now Bitfinex cannot meet. That is functionally insolvent.
Never traded on Bitfinex, I have no idea. Isn't that what it means? Now I'm doubting everything I say
Your original post had none of that information. It basically just said "bull flag just broke up" after it had fallen from 8550-8450 and then bounced to 8475. 
I know. I was agreeing with your overall sentiment, just not necessarily the claim that the flag hasn't broken up. 

Because it has broken up; I just don't believe that's especially meaningful. 
Here I will help you out -- zoom in you will see a W formation which confirms end of short term downtrend (Read: the flag were we in);  we are now forming a handle from the spike that occurred.  Look at the flag then the W.  THIS is the difference from the candles you identified. 

https://imgur.com/a/nIPRZcs
"I don't think you understand what 'breaking up' means" is condescending. That's all.
Then they are fools bad at managing their position sizes who would go bust eventually anyway...
Ha! Fair enough. Maybe a better way to put it is that those firms that have the capitol to invest large amounts into crypto have closed for the day. 
I'm not talking about projects that have been around forever, I'm talking about individuals.  If what I said translates into Monero and tron then you missed my point.  Look at the projects Vitalik Buterin, Gavin Wood, Joseph Poon, Fred Ehrsam, Olaf Carlson-Wee, Alex "Sandy" Pentland and the likes.  They are all active in advisory roles of some exciting projects that shouldn't be compared to shit like tron.

I think anyone online tonight can agree that the bulls have been ruthless tonight against anything slightly bearish, but i see what your saying. 
I just want an even playing field that isnt overly bullish/bearish, but objective and unemotional. It would help all of our portfolios.
I'm fairly sure that your first sentence wasn't always true and the second sentence was said many, many times before. 
Not sure what you're referring to.
[removed]
lol ... if I could rain dance the prices, I wouldn't be here
aware. Which is why I use stop losses
I guess people have different definitions of bull runs. Your is probbaly right. I'm talking about a new bubble, like I'm saying this will probably reverse and there will be no new all time highs coming up any time soon.
ouch, yeah I bet it did
😂
> that really isn't true

We have a difference of opinion then good sir.
I'd even expand that to 8,300 to 8,700.

Inside of that, I'd stay away.
oh god... not looking forward to that o_0
Apparently leverage, shorting and quick btc sign up is all the rage because unlike other exchanges Mex says their volume is increasing each month
That's why their overload system is constantly maxed out. 
nah... the 'YOLO' thing is kind of a joke.  I'll likely leverage more if we break log
Yes but if you switched over to btc after that huge break.. You would have more USD 
lol
Everyone else has been short sub $7k, and by the looks of it will chase this all the way up.

It was a piece a couple of years ago by (I forget) about the epic short squeeze.  With retarded levels of margin and inexperienced traders it will happen every cycle. 
Right, so if it’s decided it’s just Yen for the claimants (which is BS), Karpeles has the option to dump the coins on the market this fall... am I still misguided?
Not even so much his trading tips but the neutral tone of his posts. Never comes off as Whiney or overly emotional. Always owns when he made a wrong analysis as well.

Thank you for the reply. 
Yeah. I did not misunderstood. You did. Making plans in anything just put a cloud on your mind. Successful life is not about goals.

No worries, my short was still incredibly profitable. Could've been significantly more profitable but hey, you have to learn from these things. 

Thanks though :) 
Mille ETH (0.001)
Yeah. I'm trying to find a way to normalize volume. Maybe volume / coins in circulation. 

Most data starts at 2014 which is nothing for actual for financial trends. Just wanted to find something to see if there's various times I should pay closer attention to the market.
I'm working on it! Been parsing through the data to find interesting trends and find a way to normalize volume. 

I just wanted to check the hourly trends quickly because everyone always talks about the market shifts and it seems like there's some statistical validity to that
That is true and I think there are a lot of other traders like you, and this makes sense too. 

You may just observe the market. It is never too late. All the very best.

My personal outlook has been very clear, I am gonna try not to close my long before 10K.
Just a heads up, there's a term in this that reddit categorizes as hate speech. AutoMod removed your post. Might want to avoid that.
I'm only saying that I think this is a bad place to open a new position. I'm saying this is a better place to wait and see what happens, and then take a position. You seem to be saying roughly the same thing... but I think it's worth waiting for confirmation before making the trade. A short in this range should do well no matter the entry if we break down.
What does "perma bull" mean? I'm not permanently bullish. I realize that the market can go down for periods. I am bullish long-term and short-term (1-2 months) at the moment.  
Either way it will be dumped. Imagine injecting 160k coins in the market.
What do you mean?
It means we're breaking out of the downward channel from ATH. It doesn't confirm we have left the bear market entirely or that we are fully entering a bull market, but it indicates the market is heading in a different direction. 

Breaking through, rising above $9,000 then moving sideways for a bit in consolidation would be a great outcome. If we do that, I predict we will be in a bull market for a bit (however it will likely not resemble the bull market from Q42017, that will be very, very difficult to replicate).
Thanks for the reply.
Thank you.  Just about to look over the OBV video now!
Glad I'm not the only one seeing this. We could just as well be wrong and this FOMO ridden rollercoaster shoots up to 12k
A source proving that @bitcoin was taken over, or that CNBC was paid to talk about BCH? I most certainly can't provide either of those. I don't think they exist.
BitPay and Coinbase to start.
Well, merchant payment solutions have come a long way in the past 6 months.
There have been threads announcing merchants accepting BCH every other day for the past couple of months, along with bitpay adopting BCH which allowed for adoption among all that are already signed on to bitpay, and purse.io is adopting BCH. To be clear though, the merchants that have been announced have been a large amount of local businesses and online services.
https://www.bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf
None of those are commonly used for money right now though. The prize is still there to be taken. I think BCH will win, although nothing is certain. Just a few years ago my money was on BTC.
Yes the arguments have been re-hashed thousands of times, we are in agreement. I too recommend anyone participating in crypto, or thinking of participating, to make sure they read all sides before making an investment or using a crypto for something.

I read everywhere, even places I have been banned from. I lived it. I watched the change in control over the BTC project and continue to wade through the resulting effects. 

Whether we agree or not on the best path forward it shouldn't be so difficult to agree that there is a real market-driven reason that BCH exists and is growing.
Your site plastered in buzzwords and the focus on selling VU Tocens (a crypto?) is dodgy as FUCK.
That's what I mean, and that's why I'm hesitant to short now, because we could see virtually the same exact movement again. If futures are still in backwardation, there may be some room left yet before people start thinking this is legit and they go back into contango again. 

I still think this is all just a mini bubble, with no new money and all based off of old sentiment and hope. 

Nothing has fundamentally changed, alts have no reason to be booming nearly as much as they are, etc. 

We've followed 2014 extraordinarily well so far, there's nothing stopping us from continuing to pull a 2014 and go full bull for a month or so before finally accepting reality, turning around at low five digits, and hitting new lows. 
I just looked and didn't realize liquidity was as high as it is on June's and Septembers.

Yeah I'd move to futures if I was him.

Also...I forget sometimes that few here move as many contracts as I do.
ISO 4217. It’s the international banking standard for currency code designations. This is why in every country you see `USD` used to indicate US Dollars, `JPY` for Japanese Yen, and so on.  

4217 also specifies some supranational codes (`EUR` for the Euro), as well as the so-called “X-currencies”. 

Some examples of the X-series would be `XAU`(gold), `XAG` (silver), `XPD`(palladium), and `XBT` (Bitcoin). 
Because it is FUTURES not bitcoin. But XBT = BTC in price ish.
This may come off as condescending and/or dismissive, but you aren't ready for leveraged trading if you do not already understand the concepts of shorting vs. longing.

Keep your storage coins where they are and play around with Bitmex's testnet platform:

https://testnet.bitmex.com/

It's fake money, so there's no risk to you.

Spoofing is bad
How much money went into the dotcom bubble vs crypto? We havent seen a crypto bubble

Well damn, /u/jenninsea got pwned. :P  All of us using that phrase did I guess.
Would you consider closing your long margin position if the price fails to break through 9000 on a second attempt, assuming there is going to be a second attempt of course.  
I wouldn't do that, each time I did it was a bad idea. Wait for a dip if you want to do so.
If that were really the case, BTC dominance would still be at 85%.  Or even 62% or 50%.
Light can't escape from them, so no.

Haven't moved my stops up at all. And I intend to hold the position indefinitely if this breaks up, or close it for a small loss if the market is rejected. 

If the market *does* enter into another bull cycle, a lot of people are going to get too cute with their positions and miss out on substantial profits (or worse, go broke by closing their long and trying to short the local top).

I don't intend to be one of those people. 

This is a pretty solid "set it and forget it" opportunity (provided the market breaks the log resistance line). It's not the type of situation where it's going to be easy to sell high and buy back in lower. 
yeah, I saw. it’s deff an ascending triangle, but with the impeding resistance line above, somewhat of a tossup. time will tell
Well, I too would like to see the premium skyrocket and my entry improve considerably. 

But I honestly don't see that happening until $12,000+. 
I agree with you the BTC started this run up, I was watching the charts when the kraken whale held 6500.

The alts will break away from BTC this year, and that has to start somewhere, I don't know when but it will happen.

Both statements you have quoted from me are the same thing, all I am saying is there is a delay on the BTC pumps and BCH will show you whether it will break through resistance.

It's a trading sub and at the top it says share trading strategies which is what I am doing.

If it helps at least one person then job done. 
And that doesn't happen during the down or consolidation phases.  Been like it since 2013. 
Om confused, why would they have made no profit  if they exited at $17k? 
grammar (sorry for being a dick - the opportunity was there and needed to be taken :p)

upvoted
It's pretty damn close already. Justification is already there imo, actually touching it would just be the icing on the cake 
Average exit point on a 5% BRC.
So I get all your points and I see you posting the same thing everyday which leaves me with a few questions for full transparency :

1. Are you long or short? Leveraged?
2. At what price or point will you say that perhaps you're wrong?
3. When Bitcoin was 500 did you think it was too expensive? 

I was in your camp about thinking we were going to 3-5k but that didn't materialize. I appreciate the point you were trying to make but the following is possible:
-people who are buying are doing so in larger dollar amounts than before plus the occasional institutional investor might be dipping their toe in and a few million of buy and hold removes coins from circulation
-there are a lot of apps in the space now that didn't exist before.  A lot more users have things like blockfolio / delta to check news and prices instead of googling it
-FOMO is real, lindy effect is real. This can go from 8k to 12k or 8k to 6k in weeks, most on this chat will say so, but you seem to be pushing one view with so much confidence. Why?
-when people are googling Bitcoin they're not looking for 5 kinds of Bitcoin, no one's looking up Bitcoin diamond and maybe they're looking up Bitcoin cash but if you have coins you own both anyways so why should I care which one they're looking up? As long as they're bringing in fresh fiat it only helps adding upward pressure. 
 
No reply to any of the questions, nice.
Thanks. I believe you on it, just a good tip to site (with links) as many of your claimed sources as possible. Makes it easier for the rest of us as well as those of us on mobile or too stupid/lazy to use sites like Alexa.
If it the Columbians money, they simple wont pay them out...
Yes, that is what it means. Now you can depost $1000 USD. Before you needed at least $10,000. You still need $10,000 USD to withdraw, btw.
I can concur, I just spotted  a hidden bullish divergence on the 15 second chart, and the macd 1 min just went up, expecting a pump any second
Sure, and you can also easily draw it to where we're still in the flag. Tomato, tomato: https://imgur.com/a/rxqWl6s
Yeah that's fair, I was probably a little harsh there. Should've just said I disagree.
Many thanks for the great leads friend :)
> the bulls have been ruthless tonight

You just made a post about how this type of talk is toxic.  This is unbelievable.  To refresh your memory:

> The bears vs bulls battle here is getting toxic and annoying
Eh? Quite a few posts talking about getting out now and going short with tight SLs. They have plenty of upvotes. As do people saying that they're closing their longs (ie top post in here today.) 
He thinks you're suggesting we make the price of bitcoin be represented in millibits...or whatever it is that would divide it by 1000.

So the price of bitcoin would show as $8.31 instead of $8315
[removed]
Yeah, new ATH are so far out of the realm of possibility. Just last week 1.5 billion people got functionally banned from buying crypto as banks / payment services can no longer be used to buy it (India / pakistan).

There just are not enough new people to FOMO. Everyone in the US / EU saw ads / blasted on TV crypto for a year. If they didn't already FOMO in, then chances are they won't FOMO in now. So, the real big new markets that are needed to bring in new entrants have been banned.
That's probably a fair assessment. Maybe even go as low as $8,200. As that's the most recent significant wick down the market's seen in the past 12 hours.
> leverage

Whenever we consolidate, traders seek out leverage platforms, because without leverage there isn't enough volatility to make money.
I should also sell at every high and buy at every low right?
I hope it's not going to be as bad. I'm comfortable with this 0.6% daily rise slowly boiling shorts.

Shit, I just punned all over this.

And again. Dammit, I did it again!

No problem. Keep in mind I'm just one dude that hasn't been here long in the grand scheme of things. You'll get a different answer from everybody
No pain no gain! :) I've learnt it the hard way already.
Possibly the easiest way to normalize it by day could be as a fraction of the daily volume.
i have a small feeling you will end up right 
hmmm interesting, I guess the ***stic word :P

thanks for the info
Yeah we only have slightly different views and it's mostly just a comfort level thing. Personally I'm more comfy shorting now (well, from 8540) so my stops above the resistance are very tight to my entry and if it does break up I don't lose much. I'm a lot more liable to overtrade/exit early/enter late if I waited for it to breakdown since I'd have a larger risk in the event of a fakeout. By short I mean sell for fiat, essentially being in a fullly hedged position.

For those who are missing the reference, it's at the end of the clip. I was just implying how times have changed and contrasting our current state of affairs. Sometimes the things we used to laugh at end up looking pretty darn good by comparison. 
Just wanted to thank you for sharing your knowledge.. I like gathering different knowledgeable perspectives.

yeah, it may shoot up that high, but if it does, it's a house built on nothing but hot air

and i don't want to live in a house like that
Yeah, probably not.  But I wouldn't be surprised if these are both true.
BitPay's been around *forever* and nobody was using it. Nobody was using Bitcoin back when it cost under 10c to send coin.
Can't scale exponentially on-chain.  That's why this exists:

Liquidity on the June contracts improved considerably once March settled. 
Lol I just read what leverage is. You guys are crazy. Is everyone here trading this way? I wonder how that works out if the price just rises and rises and everyone gets 100x of their gains. 

I'll try the testnet thanks. Absolutely not dismissive.
Yeah and most households were *using* the internet.

Nobody is using crypto. Not even the crypto whales use crypto. Want to know why?

Cause credit and debit cards are more convenient and cheaper to use.
Yeah, can't even get mad at that one. It was perfect. :D
Nope, I'm holding out indefinitely or until breakeven. 
Thanks, maybe I’ll set a limit $150 lower and only add about 30% of what my current position is. 
The Bitcoin Dominance Index is really just a gimmick. Alts coins are constantly created, adding to the index without doing anything. Most of them (including top 100) have an artificial supply that is easy to manipulate.

If you still want to talk about BTC dominance, give it some more time. Let the cycle do it’s thing. We are most likely literally at just the start of a new cycle.

*sigh*
bro, there is no delay.  the only thing that is happening is that BCH is catching up in alts boom that is happening for over a week now.  

BTC is leading this run and if btc drops 10% in an hour, all of your coins will do the same (probably even going to drop 15%).  

This is a trading sub but giving people the advice to look at BCH value and if BCH value goes higher, then go long on BTC "because it will follow BCH" is not a good advice.  

The other way around I completely understand but for that you had to watch the market the last couple months to understand that every coin is following BTC.  

There might be a time where alts are standing on their own feet but it will never stop the overall dumping when btc goes down much.  
As long as BTC pairing is there (and this will always be the case since some exchanges don't want Fiat pairing) there will always be a reaction from alt coins when btc dumps.  

I am going to block you from now on because if somebody in BTC (!!!) Market says, btc follows bch then I know you have no Idea of what trading is.  

There is no way, that you can ever make a good advice to me.
Case closed.

Agreed, people aren't Googling Bitcoin because it is down and therefore not newsworthy or exciting. However, people aren't "not" Googling Bitcoin because they already know about it.
They are right now just juicing up the glaze of the gloom or doom cake. Be patient.
ok cool lets see.
That's not how money laundering investigations work. They would have simply seized the *entire* account(s).

All the suspected drug money and any *other* money in there. The problem is, layering requires you to mix the bad money with good money at a high clean money ratio. So there would likely be more clean money than bad money. This would be a giant hole on their ledger and *could* make them insolvent (or close enough that they start doing risky shit like manipulate the market).
The money is not the colombians. The virtual currency account is associated with helping the colombians launder the money. The colombians already have their money separate from the virtual currency exchange account.
Is that also true for crypto? ie if I previously wanted to Trade on Bitfinex I had to transfer more than 10K worth of BTC?
I think the bull flag broke up
Happy to help.  Start to think of it as a network effect.  Like the top companies, the best alts have the most knowledgeable people backing them.  What I'll do is find a project with which I have long term conviction, find who works/worked on it and go through their Linkedin page.  Find who they are connected to, and research those connections and the projects they are involved in.  Since we are still in the early days, its easy to find projects that you can agree with that solves for problems that exist in the space.  

Problems that I see solving for in the near term include number of transaction in a block, decentralized exchanges, anonymity (not in the currency sense).  

I'm currently staying clear of projects that provides a service that doesn't strengthen the cryptospace.  For example, I won't invest in companies that support decentralized media, social networks, dentistry, and gambling. The blockchain will someday succeed in these spaces, but the infrastructure is too young.  It's still to early for them to succeed. 
You're misunderstanding me and obviously have something to gain from trying to keep proving me wrong. 

My point is vote manipulation and overly emotional bullish/bearish sentiments are ruining this sub. I'm using the previous overly bullish nature as an example, not as another way to antagonise and keep this feud going.

Sorry for upsetting you.
Yes the sentiment here changes quite quickly, its not the main point i was making. 
[removed]
chewwwy! I cant still we go full bullish. 

Been hoping to change my flair soon! 
Another alt is pumping every other hour and it's making any new bets in BTC extremely dangerous, regardless of the direction you pick.

It's not sustainable for them but holding on through this is a bad idea. Too easy to get stopped or liquidated.
Thanks for the clarification.
At least you take the time. So many drive by down votes without any actual discourse. I creep a lot here because the market follows btc. You and the more vocal part of this community have helped the little bit of alt and btc trading i do. 
Lets hope for the good. :)
np :)
They have been growing every year, although I haven't seen the figures for 2017 yet.

Plenty of people were using bitcoin back then. How do you think this all got started?
You mean under 1c. A fuckton of people were, including me...
Sure you can, just not forever. All we need is about 7 billion x 3-5 txs per day and we should be set. 
It has enough apparently. I don't think that the number of devs working on something is correlated with that project's success. There are plenty of eyes on BCH. I think it is safer in that it can hardfork as needed and has clarity in its direction.

As an investor I am looking at which base layer offers the best platform to build upon. I want to go with what has the most potential to be built on by future developers who are constructing their own services on top of a blockchain.
Only trade 100x if you occasionally smoke crack 
Even on x3 like I do, small mistakes become very costly over time, whereas one good trade can net you 30% gain in no time. The key is to be very patient... But it's very hard not to be in a position once you've tasted the dope. Not for everyone really, most would do better dcaing.
Most people who aren't straight up holding are trading using some degree of leverage. 

Some use 3x to 5x. Others go as high as 10x or 20x. 

Occasionally you'll see someone yoloing with a 50x or 100x position. But those are rare.
No. Normal people trade with low leverage, like x3 not x100 or x50
I spent a whole year of trading with no leverage before using Bitmex... Start with gdax. Learn and then you can try leverage.

Not that anyone cares but I also have experience on an institutional trading floor, computer science degree and econ minor. So I have spent a lot of time learning before doing. Owned btc since 2013 and JUST now am comfortable leverage trading.

You are correct jumping into leverage trading is literally a fool's errand.

You can make stupid money though doing it correctly :).

Yeah exactly... Its very early..... The difference is that the money supply grew exponentially since the dotcom bubble... Valuations will just get more and more stupid as time goes on...

Our debt fueled world is not sustainable 
Do you have any expectations of further retrace? Thinking about just 1x longing here.
> The Bitcoin Dominance Index is really just a gimmick. Alts coins are constantly created, adding to the index without doing anything. Most of them (including top 100) have an artificial supply that is easy to manipulate.

Oh, really?

In that case, just look at the top 15 coins at any given time.

That way there's no "constantly created" since N=15 in every datapoint.

All of the top 15 that I'm aware of have well-defined rules around their supply.  If you want to not count a certain coin from that 15, then we'll go to the next, but you'd better have a solid reason to arbitrarily exclude crypto-currencies other than "I want Bitcoin to look less bad."  Ripple for example - Neither of us may LIKE their supply rules, but they do have clearly defined rules around their supply that have been followed for years.

If you just look at the top 15 coins, the same thing has occurred - Bitcoin's dominance has dropped drastically since 2014, and really really drastically in 2017, with no recovery.

You're making up excuses for Bitcoin's disastrous fall in adoption and favor among competitors.  We all know why it really fell.
Lol
It happened just then...
Nah its going to be another 1k green dildo it just needs lube
Thats a fair point. If its enough to almost make them insolvent, then where are they getting the money to pump the market?
Yes, that is true, but with crypto you can withdraw any amount. With USD you need $10k to withdraw.
Lol damn you're petty. You do realize you were still wrong, right? It broke up 6 hours after you posted it was breaking up based on the 15 min chart...

And I couldn't be happier about it *actually* breaking up.
you asked whether it could break out and hold and I said so far yes, which it is still doing. The fact that you are reporting my post will most likely backfire and get you banned for being yourself.
[removed]
It hasn't grown 150x in payment adoption since the bottom in 2015.
Yes, people who were sitting on piles.

They weren't sending payments, they were effectively *selling* their coin. Instead of just selling on an exchange, they'd sell for goods.

You weren't buying it on the fly then turning around and using it to pay for stuff. You were holding it for a while, then paying for stuff because it'd appreciated in price.
You have to think in terms of txs per second:
https://www.visa.com/blogarchives/us/2013/10/10/stress-test-prepares-visanet-for-the-most-wonderful-time-of-the-year/index.html

Second layer solution is the only way to get close to matching these numbers.
Can confirm both 100x and crack can be amazing, But you certainly don't want to be doing either of them more than a coupleof times a year.

Edit spelling 
What happens if you do 100x and the price drops hard in a minute? You have to pay 100k to bitmex?
I should start learning this stuff as lokg as this market behaves so crazy. Is there like an ultimate trading guide where everything is explained from forex to stocks to crypto to those contracts with all the terms and stuff? If I find a site like this then I can work on something but if I have to jump from site to site and always have to read from the start I lose interest fast.
> Yeah exactly... Its very early.....

It's been 10 years and *nobody is using crypto to pay for stuff*.

The dotcom bubble happened around 13 years after the internet really came around and *everyone* was using it.
Honestly, it wouldn't surprise me to wake up to  $10,000 or $8,000. 
My intentions are not what you are implying. You  originally seemed to be suggesting that the dominance index is an indicator whether Bitcoin is going down or up. Bitcoins price could still go up if it’s dominance falls.

I just simply said that it’s a misleading metric. Alts outperforming Bitcoin is expected at this point but it doesn’t say anything about ‘Bitcoins demise’ 




Those udders aren’t dry, yet. Another 1k would be prime for a rinse and repeat.
Tether is owned by the same people who own Bitfinex. Bitfinex uses Tether. Tether isn't cash and can only be returned to cash by a select few (as far as I understand it). For the rest, it acts much more like a virtual credit system on an associated exchange (that you can't transfer).

So it could allow you to pump a price on an exchange like Bitfinex and drive people on other exchanges to buy up in cash, to arb out the difference.

The BGD was on Bitfinex (you can see the volume increase in Bitfinex but not in the cash exchanges compared to the two weeks prior) which drove the price up on the cash exchanges due to thin liquidity. Nobody's selling cause they don't know what going on and they're all too driven with FOMO/hope that the price keeps going up to sell for cash.

This theory all makes a lot more sense if you watch the futures exchanges which are all running with negative premiums on a hard run upwards. The premium should already have flipped to positive but still hasn't and every move up, it narrows then widens back within 15 minutes as people short futures and swaps.
Just giving you crap, cheers
[removed]
Are you comparing it to the price of BTC?

The price of BTC has clearly been driven in large part on speculation. I still think that the speculation was, or at least should be, based on the adoption and permeation of society by BTC to be used by any and all however they saw fit.
Ok then, well that settles it, you weren't wrong at all.
If you say so. I guess we will find out which chain makes it there first. Place your bets!
Leverage is divorced from position size. It only dictates how much btc you need to have in your account to effectively "finance" the trade. 

On Bitmex futures, you trade contracts instead of btc. Each contract is equal to $1 USD. 

The contract is effectively an agreement between the buyer and the seller that the buyer agrees to purchase $1 worth of btc from the seller at a specific date/time at the value agreed upon at the time the contract was purchased and sold.

If you don't understand that last bit, don't worry. It's not super relevant to your question. 

Anyhow, if you open a 1000 contract position at 100x leverage, you only need to have $10 worth of BTC in your account to cover that trade. At current price, that's somewhere around .0012 btc. 

If the price of bitcoin drops to a level that someone with $1,000 invested in bitcoin would lose $10 (roughly 1%)...your position is liquidated. Which means Bitmex takes the .0012 btc you used to finance the trade. (sidenote: it would actually happen a little sooner than $10, but I don't want to bog you down with the nitty gritty right now)

If you used 10x leverage instead of 100x, you'd need much more btc in your account to make that trade happen. But you'd have more wiggle room before your position was liquidated. 

So at 10x leverage, you'd need around .012 btc to open that trade. And you wouldn't get liquidated until the market fell enough to make somebody with $1,000 invested in btc lose about $100. So roughly 10%.
You cant loose more than you have deposited, and when the price drops hard and drops the value of your postition under the maintinance margin (the value you must have / stake in order to trede with leverage) then your postition will get liquidated by the exchanges liquidation engine.
Honestly though it was through looking for a major in college that lead me to this. I started with intellectual curiosity not money making (Bitcoin came after, i learned about the supply and demand of money). It was just luck that bitcoin was super relevant to what I was learning. 

You can trade something without understanding the fundamentals so the econ, comp sci etc.. isnt a hard requirement. Best way to learn how to trade is actually trying and failing with no leverage. 

For me I KNOW crypto is a big part of the future so when I started trading I used a lot of money. If you dont believe then you should prob start trading with not a lot (I'm not here to influence you).

Dude crypto started on a fucking mailing list and was developed by random dudes all ober the world...

The internet  was started by the government and continued by the  biggest companies in the world with the full backing of every university.. 


It alsl requires a far greater paradigm shift than the internet. Is hard for people to accept that our current monetary system makes us slaves to the banks.... 


> You originally seemed to be suggesting that the dominance index is an indicator whether Bitcoin is going down or up. 

I suggested altcoins generally move by a larger percentage than Bitcoin does.  Bitcoin moving more than Altcoins is not necessarily a good sign, as the speculative bull push could be petering out.

The metric could have many meanings.  There's lots of information to glean out of it, both short and long term.  You literally said it was a "gimmick" and is essentially meaningless, and then went on to imply that it's disastrously low number is just a fad that's going to fade shortly.  I countered those claims, and you haven't really disputed the fact that altcoins generally move in greater percentages than Bitcoin does during most market movements, both down and up.

And yes, one meaning of dominance dropping is a measure of how in danger Bitcoin is of (or how much it has) lost in it's first-mover network effects.
Thanks for the explanation and the time it took.

You can use a bitcoin hardware wallet to rub on your testicles for all I care, it doesn't mean it's something a rational person is going to do.

Only an *extremely* tiny portion of the coins are getting used for payments. The rest are being hoarded.
Simply follow the engineers who are working on solutions.  May the best chain win :)
I need to look into this.

What if btc goes up 1% in the first example? 
You think people care that they're slaves to banks?

Almost everyone in the western world has credit cards. Those are 10x worse than using a bank for a savings and/or checking account but you don't see anyone looking to drop their credit card.
I agree with you in using Bitcoin Dominance as an indicator.  From what we've seen in the past, when Bitcoin Dominance is decreasing, total crypto market cap tends to increase.  So it's a bullish indicator for the market overall, Bitcoin included.

I strongly disagree that Bitcoin Dominance dropping while the crypto market cap increases overall is bad news for Bitcoin.  Whenever people are investing in alts, it brings attention to BTC.  Bitcoin is still by far the dominant coin.  And if you think there can only be one successful crypto currency, then you're out to lunch.  

After Bitcoin @ ~39% right now, Ethereum is second @ 15.5%.  Both coins have co-existed and serve their own purposes.  So Bitcoin is still roughly 2.5x bigger than its nearest "competitor".  Then after that you have Ripple @ 9% and Bitcoin Cash @ 5%.  Hardly any threats there.  Even if Ripple has long term success, it's clearly not a replacement for Bitcoin.

Anyways, if you look at periods of success in these markets, Bitcoin and alts go up together.  Maybe not at the exact same time, but they take their turns.  When the markets drop, Bitcoin Dominance goes up.  On April 1st, Bitcoin was in the mid 6000s.  Dominance was 45%+.  Are you saying the outlook was better for Bitcoin then vs. now?
[removed]
Hoarded for what?
Then you'd make $10 and double your account balance from .0012 btc to .0024 btc. Provided you sell off those 1000 contracts 1% higher than where you entered.
Many are using credit cards for payments which is secure, effective and profitable if you are disciplined with paying back in correct time. They have both credit cards and saving accounts which now-a-days are nearly useless due to the FED's low interest regime.

So the problem with little/no saving in the Western world is mostly caused by the FED IMO.   
Bitcoin adoption will proabably be by necessity rather than convenience 
[deleted]
Too many people keep parroting "store of value" so I assume they don't have a clue how that actually works and rather just hoard coins.
Oh shit that totally makes sense. I'll think before I ask the next time. 50% gains for 1% rise is pretty neat.
> Many are using credit cards for payments

Debit cards do the same without the line of credit. People use credit cards because they don't have *cash* (i.e. money in their account) to pay for it on the spot.
What necessity? The US isn't going bankrupt anytime soon. As much as people like to complain about the debt, the vast majority of it is owned by US government agencies and the SS trust fund as well as Medicare trust fund. It's not defaulting even in the next 10 or 15 years. Not like 20 or 30 years even.

So what will force them to? People aren't switching cause there's no point to switch.
I'll agree with you in that I don't see the current upswing as an end to the bear market.  I was there in 2011 and 2014 as well.  I know how long the pain tends to last when these things drop.  More than anything, for the market to get enough momentum to jump into another bull market, you really need a huge amount of people to exit.  You need people to think that the whole system is actually dead.

Right now, even the more casual investors are still holding.  There just hasn't been enough pain yet.  The falls have been drastic.  Almost approaching the levels in 2014.  But that's just from sheer % drop from ATH.  That's not true pain.  True pain is locking your money into an asset for 1-2 years of bear market, with no particular end in sight.  It's the huge amounts of time that truly push people out.  

These same people that get pushed out are the same that jump back in during a bull run.  They already understand the concept, they have verified exchange accounts, they've been there before.  So all these people who sell during the bear markets and give up tend to get back into the next bull market at a decent price.  They're ready to take action.

These guys provide the initial momentum after the true bear market has run its course.  Then you get the real newbies jumping in.  They see it's happening again.  They watched from the sidelines each time in the past and this time they aren't going to miss out.  So they jump in and get verified on an exchange and get in around the middle of the next bull run.  They should do alright.

Then you have the absolute casuals.  The folks who are ready to buy the top.  They have zero understanding of the tech.  They don't even care.  They just heard their nephew is making big bucks with the Bit Coin and they want a piece.

Then it all repeats itself!
Better security with credit cards in case of fraud and stolen cards. With debit card your account may be emptied and the banks do not really care, your money your fault. Credit cards company care more since it is their money on the stake as well in case of irregularities.   
The US is not the center of the world.......

Many small countries are already on the verge of collapse..

Not to mention many European countries didnt recover from the 2008 crisis... 
Whoa... Completely agreed on all that.  That matches what I've found and it also matches some psychological patterns I found from the dot com crash and housing market crash.  It takes many many months and it's only after the despair and fear really get entrenched that the recovery can begin.
Debit cards can have daily spending limits enabled and federal law states that once you've reported the stolen card, you're not liable for further charges.
Yeah and those tiny countries don't have the wealth to push this up like this.
Its called "the domino effect"

It doesnt take a lot of money to move the price.... Remember that BTC supply is inelastic
Yeah it doesn't when it's all *hoarded*. If it's all being hoarded, then there's nobody to buy the second someone decides to *sell*.
Why would there be nobody to buy? Bitcoin keeps getting more and more useful while everything else doesnt
