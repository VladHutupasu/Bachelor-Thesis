If it ends up rising from here, people will say, "See? It was an ascending triangle."

If it drops, people will say, "See? It was a rising wedge."

That's why TA works. 
Lesson learned: If you are wanting to add to your position on a breakdown, and have been watching charts for the last 8 straight hours, do not dare get up to take a shit.

So who else thinks June is going to show some major, decisive price action based on our multi month symmetrical triangle?
As I stated in my previous [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8noyex/daily_discussion_friday_june_01_2018/dzxv4ax/) if the price was able to hold here the daily MACD would turn green today and it is now green. It can still turn red, though, if there are some big sells today (and the very first hourly candle of the day was a big red one, so I think some bears know this). While some may be taking this as a buy signal, others will probably wait for another day to see if it stays green but I think many traders will see a buy signal either today or tomorrow and that could help us break 7600. Also, I don't think 7800 will provide as much resistance as we think it could, just as it didn't provide as much support as we thought it would. We probably will bounce off of it, though, so it could be a good scalp but since 7600 has been such a huge hurdle it probably won't convince sellers to suddenly start selling 200 dollars higher or buyers to stop buying. For me, 7600 is the big resistance here and if it breaks then we're in the clear (at least temporarily). 
I didnt really follow the daily today but looked a little bit back because i was wondering why the hell 7600 is such a strong resistance. Most people probably know it but looking back at the chart, it is actually the resistance that needed to be broken to kind of start the rally to 20k. We bounced of it twice, went back to ~5,8k and then started the slow and steady climb to 8-9k and up we went to 20.

Im not implying that this is going to happen again. It is just an observation of last years movements. The market is a bitch and it is mostly impossible to predict the direction where we are heading (you can predict short term movements but thats about it for now).

My Bubble Aftermath chart. Day 0 is the very peak of the 2013, 2014, and 2018 bubbles. The chart tracks the daily percentage change from the high for the following 235 days. Comparing percentage change isn’t perfect, as a lot more money is involved when the price goes from $20,000 to $10,000 than when it goes from $200 to $100, but it is interesting to note the similarities and differences between the different periods.

A lot of people have been comparing 2018 to the 2014 bear market. If the fractal continues we may see another rally to the $11,200 area which relates to the $680 resistance that was hit in early June 2014. At that point in the bubble cycle the trends diverged and 2013 kicked off into a new bubble (which would be upwards of $80,000 on this chart), and 2014 rolled over and ultimately hit bottom in early 2015. Of course, we could chart a new territory and do something completely different too.

Disclaimer: I am currently long.
We have now offically the tightest 12h Bbands since the beginning of October 2017.

We will see a big move in June, no doubt.

Edit: Seems like on log scale they are even the tightest since April 2017. 
Closing my short from $7411.

I’ve been flip flopping out of shorts left and right for 36 hours way too often.

Headed on a 3 day vacation today and it will be a good cleanse from trading/Chart Watching/Reddit (Sorry Fam). 

I’m still gonna have some short orders stacked in the $7700-$7800 range Incase I get lucky, otherwise I’m out.

See Y’all on Sunday. Good luck this weekend ladies! 
Looks like the bottom of the wedge from where it broke down is now acting as resistance. Plus it's knocking on the bottom of the 4H kumo again, where it got rejected earlier. https://www.tradingview.com/x/blTcqIAc/


It looks like either one very big long or a big long that cascaded into a lot of other people's stop losses caused that drop. Either someone lost confidence in their long and just market closed it or someone is trying to hold down the market (I'm for the former since I try not to make conspiracies about whales and market manipulation, etc.) On top of that lots of shorts were opened. What's surprising about all of this is the fact that we are bouncing here so nicely. After dropping 2.5% in 2 minutes it seems crazy to buy it up but that seems to be what's happening. As long as another whale doesn't decide to throw in the towel here and drop the price further it looks like it'll hold, which is pretty bullish. 

Even though many people in here are bearish, or at least hedging and trying to play it safe, the overall market seems to be in the midst of changing sentiment, and there is one technical indicator that may be giving the bulls hope and that's the daily MACD. If the price holds here the next daily will be green and that generally precedes a markup in price. So while many in here are leaning bearish I think the ball is actually in the bear's court, and if the price can't be pushed down further, momentum will swing to the bulls for a little. 

TL;DR - I'm thinking it is actually up to the sellers, not the buyers, to push the price down here, and if they fail then momentum will swing to the bulls. But as we just saw, it won't take much for some big whales to give up and close their longs and break support.
Have you ever sat down and read through mainstream articles from marketwatch regarding btc price fluctuations? Everytime I see one I sit down to read it hoping to get perhaps an outsiders perspective on price movement and all I get is a poorly written, confusing mess.

Looks like Kraken is entering the final stages of its exit from Japan. Bunch of alts and bank deposits will halt for japanese accounts on June 8th.

background - Jessie Powell, CEO of Kraken said on Unchained they were exiting Japan completely due to the FSA doubling down on regs , compliance and over all knowledge gathering required to get approval after the coincheck hack. Before they were just interested in Kraken's japan entity. Now they wanted to understanding all aspects of Kraken's business... Nope!

Derisking here by closing half my long in small profit. 

Shorting is not on my table yet as I’m still optimistic short term. Moved my stop loss up to break even and my first target to close the rest from $7,700 to $7,970. Daily MACD is looking to turn green and the patience here is really running out so there oughta to be an explosive move soon. My bet is up

Edit: Exciting movement up! Such a Bitcoin thing to do. Makes me a bitter that I closed half my long but I’m excited and looking forward for the price discovery over the weekend. My eyes are still set for $7,970. 
Are flags valid patterns in crypto anymore? F...
These days, a bear flag is the dip because it barts straight up, and support break is the dip because it crawls back up
I think we're at a good place here.  The best thing would be for high volume but low price variability.  Let's play around 8000 for a good long while.  
Finally some movement! Looks like buyers are trying to close the daily with a green candle
Peter Brandt blocked me for implying we were going to the moon when he explicitly said we only might be going to the moon.

Will have no clue where BTC is going now.
That is one absolutely beautiful bearflag on the 15 min chart, so it will probably.... just bart straight up for reasons.
Pretty bullish that 7300 held. Pretty bearish we can’t get anove 7600

I hope we are range bound here for the foreseeable future.
More and more I look at the prices of Ethereum and other alts to understand the Bitcoin price action.

Now for example, the Bitcoin chart looks a little more like a rising wedge (bearish) than an ascending triangle (bullish).

But when I look at the ETHUSD and ETHBTC charts I can clearly see an ascending triangle about to breakout. 

Usually strong ETH price action pulls BTC with it.

BTC is not an island. There are multiple interconnections. If you want to understand the BTC charts, you need to look at the most important alts, as well.
Decided there is (almost) enough for me to open a long here.

- Hidden Bullish Divergence 2 Hour RSI.
- Looks like we've just made a bullish channel.
- ETH holding a higher low.
- ETH shorts ripe for a squeeze.
- Waiting for a 15 min higher low and higher high, like the one circled before entering
- Looking like there might not be a better entry if this is a notable swing.

Chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/QHAmO2Tn/

EDIT: Some perspective: https://www.tradingview.com/x/Qw1Savr1/ 
Not ruling out that we could touch the edge of the bear channel and drop like the previous action circled.

EDIT2: Just wanted to say I'm a very, very long way from being an expert.  Been doing this for just over a year and the only reason I'm in the green is because I know someone who is an expert.  They told me when to buy and sell. Have since spent a lot of time learning, but I am sure many of you here are better traders than me.
I just made a creepy observation... I'll get to that.

Still looking at price stability. A few days ago I posted this chart:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/QsCraIAe/

/u/lemarijuanas writes:

> [...] if we are comparing the two bubbles then we're definitely not at the same point in the cycle as we were in 2014 in terms of days since ATH.

I agree 100%. I hadn't thought about that.

Yes! The rate of change in bubble cycles shouldn't match up day over day. Instead, we should look at indicators to signal and eventually confirm market position. My chart is meant to illustrate a possible market bottom that is historically rare. Matching up those market bottoms and stretching data to match the peaks and valleys is more illustrative.

So what happens when we do that?

https://www.tradingview.com/x/tejeK3RY/

Looking at how these data overlap in the 55 week period following May of 2015 creeps me out. The similarities between then and now are... uncomfortably symmetric.

Past performance is not an indicator of future performance. I just thought this was really weird. It's hard to believe that it's the coincidence that it is.
Seeing a bigger ascending triangle with horizontal resistance at about $7600. The last interval between bart-down and bart-up was about 13 hours. Maybe we see a bart-up here at around 11am GMT? After that, I'm thinking double bottom at 7k, though EMAs on longer time-frames say we could see a move as high as $8550. I'm thinking double-bottom though first to give buyers more confidence in that as a local bottom. GL out there all.
7 minutes before the 12h, 6h and 4h candles close, what a COINcidence.
Think you could open both a long and short here and end up closing both with +2% profit within 48 hours?
Buyers have 0 Ammo to push this though $7600 a million times.

But they buy the dumps like it’s their fucking job.

You would figure this would go down lower considering the amount of times rejected off $7600

Edit; Added a short on bounce at $7411. If we wind up going sideways for hours I’ll close it 
What matters more/is more significant:

1. Sharp sell offs from $17k, $11.8k and $9.9k indicating a DCB and bear market for the foreseeable?

2. Higher lows from $6k, $6.5k and $7k indicating the start of a reversal and a loose “triple bottom”?

3. Nobody has a fucking clue nor meaningful insight.
Looks like bitcoin has absolutely no clue what it's doing. And same for eth. Call me when there's something to trade here, still bearish until further notice.

The chart I'm trading is bfx and the support hasn't been tested there, just looks to me that the market is scared to test it but doesn't want to get through 7.6 either, so what do we make of this?
1 week without trading. Waiting for 3 green days and a moving average cross on 1d for start consider things. Those fakeouts have no power over me
Closed my short at around $7510 for a small loss. 

I give up. 
I made this comparision: [https://imgur.com/a/Uhd7FE8](https://imgur.com/a/Uhd7FE8) \(Everything overlaps very exactly as I checked the pixel  values with the important dates.\)

Not sure what message I can take from it. One might be that if a price spike is overproportional to the attention is gets in the trends curve it is more likly that the price declines afterwards quite strong \(see circled mini bubbles\). 
Good luck for those who are trading this. I'm looking for a lower risk entry point.

Just a quick short term update. Could be forming a flag off the wedge breakdown \(read: currently \*are\* forming a flag, but who knows how long we'll flag for\).

7500

‘nuff said
I posted this [chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/JsAGjTKt/) a few days ago.  The resistance we're struggling with is a pitchfork median line.  It seems historically it's been tough to pass without BGDing over it.  And this time is no different.

I expect this to be our last crack at it.

EDIT: Disclaimer: The move up to the line has filled my short position.  But i did post a few days ago saying i'd long if we can close convincingly over it.  Which i still will.
Seems to be bouncing off 7600 for now, but were not out of the woods just yet

One thing i certain, its going to be interesting

EDIT: Watching the volume and we started rising with green candles, and this market has a way of flipping so we might expect some high volume red candles.
and here comes the bart 
Not much of a trader.
But hey, its golden ratio day!
Opened a tiny long in its honor near bottom of recent drop and have limit to close it at 7465, the 23.6% level between the recent local low of 7040 and high of 7600. Pretty confident btc gods will pocket me my 1% pnl in respect of Fibonacci!

Happy trading! 

Correct me if I'm wrong but double/triple bottoms need to happen within <100 bars of each other to qualify no?
The crazy conspiracy theory that we hit the top and bottom right around the 6th of the month would require this current bounce up before it hit the bottom of the triangle june 6th. I'm almost starting to believe it.
[removed]
Volatility and excitement are falling fast.  We're getting closer to my buy signals.  Few more weeks at least, but this level is holding surprisingly well.  Google trends is still declining, but slowing down.
Feels like 7500 is a big magnet. We keep falling below it and sometimes rising above but we keep on getting pulled back.
Time to switch from watching nervously if a higher high is set to watching nervously if a higher low is set. Bitcoin - not even once.
Something tells me that the whale/s that are responsible for these huge Barts aborted the most recent bart drop in order to try and fool people into buying by thinking we are reversing. 
Daily chart seems to me quite bullish. We are still in the giant wedge after bounce from 7100. Can't see too much selling pressure in last three days. R/R is not very good for shorters. So, my guess is that we gonna reach 7.8k in a 3-4 days, where we gonna see either breakout or huge sell-off to resist that level. 
Opened 10x long here at 7390 with 1st target of 7.8k and 2nd target of 8.2k. Have a good trades.

In 3 hours we have incredible tight 12 Bbands \(the tightest since November or early October\). In the next 24 hours a big move could happen, be prepared.

Entry requirements have not been met for my long posted [here](https://reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8noyex/daily_discussion_friday_june_01_2018/dzxrtso/?st=jhwfkbw6&sh=9b8385b2) 

ETH made a lower low and nothing about the price action here was able to convince me that we are going back up (no definition or purpose on 15 min chart).

Layering in short sells between here and 1.5% up.  Reckon we could still go up another hundo $.

Also, if you're into it, H&S reversal in the making on the 6 hour chart.

Targeting a 4-5% drop.  Looking to flip into a long down there.

EDIT: I also noticed this divergence https://www.tradingview.com/x/HRuO6G9c/.  Could any of the more experienced traders chime in with using the MACD histogram in this way?  I read about it being used like this but would appreciate any info or thoughts.
God this market is so boring that I opened a 50 contract 100x long just to see what happens, I never used more than 25x leverage before.

Now you can commence teh BARTing
And... last night pathetic BRD is gone
So even if we end up looking like we are going to break out of the wedge upwards, and start to shoot past 7600 and 7650, we have the descending trendline from 10k RIGHT above that. 7700ish bitmex/stamp. And bfex is 7800ish, so on any of these breakouts seems incredibly risky to me. Im short 7600, originally with tight stops but im struggling to justfify closing it before breaking all of these levels.
We really just don’t want to break down from our wedge do we now? 

Little baby wicks through, keeps teasing us 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/lRY2b0wF/

Short from $7500 from a little earlier in the night. Small guy, just to protect my cold storage. 

First target for breakdown is $7365-$7400. 

Edit: Went to set a stop loss and accidentally set a market buy and closed position. Walked away with a .40 cents gain!!!! So I’m out until further notice. I could re open at same price but I’ll just wait this out 
$7032 was the floor on this run.
I know this is bearville but I actually think a violent move up is in the making. Delusion ™

 BTC in a rising wedge here. looks to me now more like a rising wedge\(Bearish\), than an ascending triangle\(bullish\). still if you have your stop losses set no need to worry, but breakout coming soon.  [https://www.tradingview.com/x/1efoh3wF/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/1efoh3wF/) 
Looks like 'ascending triangle' broke down...
I'm hedge short here. I don't trust rising wedge breakdowns during low points on Bitcoin as a reliable shorting signal, but hedge short is the "neutral" position and is the safest bet here. I have buy orders a few hundred pips down that I hope will close my short and build a long position at lower risk entry points.
Bullish hope: If it is a iH&S it could be part of the right shoulder \(the left one looks quite similar\)
How would I calculate the change in RSI on a given price move?
Do companies like Kaiko and Coinigy obtain approval from exchanges to re-sell historical market data? According to GDAX for example, they do NOT allow re-distribution of marketdata yet these companies appear to resell them
ETH just dropped pretty drastically without a peep from BTC.  Be ready for something...  I'm guessing a drop.

Usually ETH will move with BTC but with higher volatility, this is a little unusual IMO.  It might bounce back when it sees that BTC DNGAF about their drop.  Or it could be a precursor.
Feeling good about my long from Thursday. Not even thinking of closing and kind of hoping we go down overnight so I can add and make the most of the huge run up that's about to happen.
Closed short from 7600 at 7410. Was expecting quicker fall from breakdown of wedge. Might drop more but my play was just based on the wedge and it seems like we might break the 15m descending resistance soon. Need to get some sleep anyway
Haven't been posting here as much, weather is nice and it's Yeezy season. I still believe much of this has been/is accumulation and the price is gradually getting marked up as we speak. I'll believe otherwise if we drop down below $6,500. 
the wedge broke down, next destination - 7200

lets say we make a new lower low in goblin town, where would you consider buying? 5k? 4.7k? or even lower?
rising wedge with decreasing vol on 4 hr. needless to say i dont trust this rise 1 bit
Meh... 10x long @ 7415, bounced nicely at the sym triangle support. A resistance re-test or thereabouts is likely enough for the r/r to be decent. 
Still feeling good about my long from Thursday at ~7.3K. Debating whether or not to add here because this is looking extremely well coiled for a big run up. Will add at 7.2 if it goes there, I guess.
Looks like to me BTC is liking these rising wedges lately. Personally expecting another breakdown from this one to test atleast the $7300 support  [https://www.tradingview.com/x/pJDmYphp/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/pJDmYphp/)

So... laws in China strictly regulate capital flight . It's one of the reasons of last year bull run. Starting from July 2018, ways of bypassing this law will be even more reduced. Hong Kong, a separate jurisdiction, had announced that anyone who carries more than HK$120,000(around $15,300) in and out of HK will have to declare it, though no restriction on how much one can carry, no taxes to be levied either. 
Previously HK has never had a limit or declaration law regarding cash carrying on one's body. 
This could be a bullish news for bitcoin. Or maybe not. Your call.
!short close 7621 100&#37;

Happy to close this hedge at a fairly small loss. Now it's just up to the market to continue and confirm some bullish moves. I'm not too confident in their ability just yet, so I'm gonna keep a close eye on things.

However, if the move does continue, we have a few major bull signals coming up very soon:

* Bullish 200/50 EMA cross on 1H chart
* Bullish cloud twist on double 2H Ichimoku cloud
* Bullish TK cross on double 4H Ichimoku cloud

Bitcoin surprised most this week by not descending into the depths, some analysts believed $3000 was on the table. I would agree that the current crisis in Italy is to blame for the shift in momentum, currently there is solid resistance at $7600, lets take a look.

It is important not to pop the champagne yet, even though the market has found support above $7200 and momentum is shifting. The Bitcoin market is still under a lot of bearish pressure and the bulls will have to keep on working hard to tip the scales.

There is a potential bullish channel forming should the Bitcoin price consolidate above $7600 going into the weekend and next week. We can see that the MACD indicator on the 1 Day candle chart, could be getting ready to produce a buy signal, which will get some longer term traders interested in the market.

As we know political situations rarely resolve themselves in a couple of days, and with the Italy elections on the way, it could make the EU markets shaky for a while. With that said we will keep an eye on how much capital is flowing into crypto over the next month, to confirm this trend .

Keeping the above mentioned in mind, consolidation above $7600 will most likely push prices towards $8000, where we will hit the psychological resistance level left over after the previous bloodbath. Should we fail to push higher, it is quite possible that we will retest the lower $7k zone again. Safe trades.

Did anybody anticipate this BGD who is not a "moonboi", "troll" or "shitposter"? Should we perhaps reconsider our downvoting policy here people, so as to not marginalize important messages? I wish everybody a nice and peaceful Friday. 

Edit: My apologies for being so blunt here, but I honestly feel that this sub would benefit more from listening to all the sides of a given scenario. TA shows the May slump happened far too fast and there's room for more bounces, there's a bull div on the 4-hourly and I've seen other formal arguments indicating a near-term relief rally. I haven't heard those arguments here in r/Bitcoinmarkets, and that worries me frankly.

And I'm bearish! 
Still holding that long from 7180. Can the BGD hurry up pls.

What's the best place for holding longer term leveraged positions. Longer term = >1 month. I guess looking for cheaper options here. 
Careful piling on with the shorts.  ETH hasn't made a lower low (yet).

Edit: Looking like it could be the same trick as yesterday. A chance BTC wedge just got turned into a channel.
What was the drop earlier today? 
Seems like we can dance around these levels all we want, in a process that could take another 3 to 5 months, but until we 'discover' bottom... in a fast big dumpening scenario, well we're just going to keep ranging around doing essentially bugger all. 

For the traders it doesn't matter too much in that sense of course but for the hopes of a more expensive Bitcoin, seems to me that unless we get that crash scenario and a true bottom is found, then we're going to be slowly declining for a long time to come. 

I know at the start of the year people laughed at those who mentioned a long bear market coming up but it seems quite reasonable now to suggest that this whole year could be a bear market. 

Are the numbers of 1 to 2k really that ridiculous? I for one am thinking bottom is around 4.5k but really I don't think any low number can be truly discounted. 

Anyone who sold at 20k and buys back in at 2k (should we hit that)... is a Goddam genius
2 possibilites: 1. we have another small leg up within the next hours until 7590, buyers give up, we bart down. 2. We stagnate for a little bit longer here and bart down from here. Plans for me: hedge short from here, naked short from 7590 if we reach it, bail over 7620.

EOS sent $120 million worth of ETH to bitfinex..getting ready for fire works for mainnet launch 
My tinfoil theory:

Anti-Bitcoin entities (threatened govts etc) are manipulating the price to:

1. Shake out traders
2. Shake out weak hands & hodlers
3. Shake out retailers (you can't use a currency that swings in value like this)

I also think it might be working.

I'm going to start laddering some exits of my hodl stack if we see $9k again.
It's abundantly clear most of the market has never traded anything, let alone Bitcoin.

You're selling/shorting a triple bottom.

Good luck guys (serious).

I'm still bearish medium term so if we rally above 7.7 we will probably continue the down trend to below 7k unless we go up above 8.2. If we  go down below 7k without a mini rally up things can get ugly. I'm talking about Toreo abuse.
Oepsie Floepsie.. Guys and Girls. Looks Good.

Just awaiting we are for 24 hours 76+.
Then adding some juicy BTC's. Long term - Cold - Ledger.


Don't we have Fun!!!!, Great room here!!, Great People!!

Are we about to pop? 
If you're short and didn't close at 7350 when you had the chance, 7400 is your new best hope for today.

Anyone keeping an eye on the Channel turned ascending trangle or rising wedge?

I thought we would bart down quite a bit more to confirm a channel, but looks to me like an increasing tightening range with decreasing volume on every move up or down
The bulls are really trying to drag this bear market out way longer than it needs to be.
[removed]
This a textbook Bart. All action above the second 15min candle. It's gonna pump to 7600.
[removed]
 Unsurprisingly **BTC** has broken out of the rising wedge, and have to see if $7300 support holds. if not **BTC** not looking good and will retest 7k.   [https://www.tradingview.com/x/Dl83gc7j/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Dl83gc7j/)

TA is not predictive but reactive
but it's not a triangle. so nah 
thats why you use more than 1 indicator and timeframe, always  
when everything lines up, thats when you do your trade
ETH is the one to watch! It's leading IMO. Very clear chart, whilst BTC's is confusing.

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/AkENnpIM/
better just buy and hodddlllllllllll

.... or you don't understand multiple bets
If it drops "the resistance was too strong". If it rises "everytime we touch a resistance it gets weaker".
What do they say when it Barts up then back down? Don't have a cow?
I think TA provides justification for anything, and everything.
No, it's a tightening range that can break either way. 
Just shitting yourself instead may have better risk/reward.

How do I quantify the opportunity-cost of taking a dump?

June or July. We'll need a resolution one way or the other by early August. It's not likely to cycle all the way to the convergence, so June seems likely.

Then again, I expect us to break down out of it in the next week, but BTC loves to say "Hold my beer and watch this"
My profound TA reveals the following:

As of the 6th of June the price will move towards the upper side of the triangle.

Since this move won't be able to fill an entire month, due to the lack of space, we will then break out to the upside.

[https://twitter.com/ArminVanBitcoin/status/1001448015931105280](https://twitter.com/ArminVanBitcoin/status/1001448015931105280)
Yeah I think this is gonna tank and people are gonna get caught with their pants down having thrown money at every dip for the past 6 months 
Me. I think we'll break up out of the triangle in late June at a price level around 8500.
I'd like to see us find the bottom in the next 3-4 days at $6950, then reverse course back towards the resistance line, finally breaking it with some 4th of July fireworks. 
Not sure how we get there but I reckon we're going sub $6k.  IMO we need to cull the moon bois, unsustainable projects and people waiting to drop bags off before a proper move up is possible. We might even get a bull trap going first by breaking through the roof of the triangle.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/rXlJ2qKF/
In my opinion that pump to 680 was the equivalent of the pump to 10k we just had. Daily RSI hit overbought for the first time since the ATH in both cases. Also a lot of people were pointing out how we just dropped under the 365 day MA for the first time since that drop from 680.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/j5JdSKlo/

The chart /u/jarederaj posted also shows the similarities between the 10k pump and that 2014 pump. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/QsCraIAe/

I don't think this will play out like 2014 though, imo we'll consolidate in this weekly eq and probably break up barring some terrible news. 
Interesting insight and chart.  Thanks
I think the two 2013 bubbles were both part of the same cycle. Its very similar to how ETH technically saw two bubbles in 2017, but Bitcoin just saw the one longer bubble.

Bitcoin's price requires a lot more capital now-a-days to create a blow-off top that ends the bull market.
Wasn’t the 2014 bear market caused by China banning bitcoin followed by the mt gox hack? How is now comparable?
It's the same width on both scales. It just looks different. Calculate the percent width to get consistent reporting.

See the teal line at the bottom of this chart:

I say up

PS: Standing in the mother of all immigrations lines, so expect more comments soon
can you share the details/graph?
I expect 3800 around summer so you could be right.
eh, I'd plan the other way. Set catastrophic low buying orders and hope to get lucky($5500 or so)

Much safer than holding a short and hoping the resistance line holds over 3 days without looking at the charts 
Make sure you pre-set catastrophic stops on those short orders in case someone decides to short squeeze the hell out of ETH. 

Assuming you can do that on kraken.
We're going to see some red. Planning on closing my short at your pivot support 1 area and open a long if it looks good.  If it doesn't look good, then maybe 6900. What's your play at the moment, mate?
It's one, stupid, sadist, narcissistic ... mother fucker.
Biggest problem with hovering in this area for the next few days or weeks is that we will open below the Ichi cloud on the weekly\(with the bearish cross already happened a few weeks ago\). This seems a given right now, or at least opening into a very thin cloud with little to no room for any down movement.There does seem to be room for some upside but I think it's too little too late right now. I think we're destined to go down before breaking 10K.

It does look like that move earlier was a big position closing though, Thanks for pointing it out. I'm keeping my long term short from the low 9Ks and have  building a short on Sept futures and hedging my gains on perps or June futures. Seems like the best thing to do IMO 2 main positions that are rarely touched and then you can day trade or hedge your short gains. Works like a treat if you can get a good entry and a day or two worth of movement in your favor and can move the lev to 100x and a stop in profit to use what you have left to play the bounces\(I only keep a small &#37;age of my trading stack on mex, 3.3x leverage is plenty for me most of the time\).

If we make a new low that loooks like heavy capitulation I'll probably build a long on the Sept/Dec futures and do the same. 2 trades with the trend \(1 long term 1 short\-medium\) and one that leans more bearish \(maybe the options or maybe just a straight directional trade on Sept/Perps\) when the time comes without having to giving up my position and re\-entering. When the market picks it's direction drop the loser and hopefully it's still in profit then your main position is already comfortably in the green.
Glad I'm not the only one.

!short close xbtusd 7580

Stopped out on this one overnight moved the stop down slightly before sleeping to avoid the major slippage with a 7600 stop.
Once it starts running up, it's not going to stop for a while.
when the volume and volatility comes back it will be. until then, chart on longer time frames, they're generally still working
it's all a matter of probabilities, for market to be efficient.
my thoughts exactly, the market is FINALLY agreeing on a price range and market makers are under the radar due to the US investigations. This is overall healthy  for the market. 
Why would you want to have anything to do with Peter Brandt in the first place?
Yeah but don't worry, bulls will get cold feet/wait for others to do the heavy lifting so it will Bart right back down
what is the meaning of bart
Fresh squeezed short juice is on the menu, I hear. Takes a while to prepare, but it's worth the wait.
You were right all along. $7500 is the value of bitcoin. Everyone pack it up, we're done here.
can we get a u/L14dy line that’s just a flat line at 7500 please? will you eat your dick if it’s not still 7500 by 2020?
ETHUSD can be drawn as a rising wedge as well by connecting the wicks on the upside on the 4Hr. Frankly, I wouldn't be excited about the price action when I see so many upper wicks. 
BTC used to not always be a big mess of barts and flags. BTC's 15 minute chart used to look a lot like ETH's chart looks like when it was at that price range. BTC today is all pumps, dumps, flags, barts, and farts.

I blame a higher use of margin and stops on BTC
I got Both in Porto.. So buy Both!
ETH/BTC is most deff painting a rising wedge imo

ETH/USD an ascending triangle.

Could mean BTC breaks out more than ETH... I dunno
My take would be this: *if* bitcoin makes a bullish break out of it's rising wedge, it's because market makers are chasing the ETH shorts. As opposed to BTC being *bullish af*.  If they can get them to close and/or take stops it's the perfect way of getting another bit of FOMO action going before a test and potential breach of the lower trend line.
where are you putting your SL?
Here are a few of my own questions, in case you don’t mind it: 

Where do you think the price has the potential to reach before another pullback? I’m guessing ~$7600? Do you plan on shorting or tethering once that happens? Where do you see bitcoin’s price in one month? I understand this is like asking for a crystal ball, but feel free to speculate or share your opinion.

Edit: Wrong numbers
So, do these findings influence what you expect to happen over the mid term? I know you’ve said that the mt gox bubble pop and subsequent decline was a one time thing, so would that imply that the 2012 line here has more weight?
you just took random point in the past to define the "bottom" and to match your narrative "55 weeks"
I just don't see how this can be a valid triangle. If anything then 7.6 is a horizontal resistance and we're in an ascending wedge.
goddammit, fuck this market.
Totally normal. No manipulation here.
then comes the lightsaber candle and you get rekt :D
doing that is the same thing as not opening anything until a long at the bottom/short at the top
It's incredibly frustrating for sure. It's been the markets MO for months now though. 
Might be a little speculative, but it almost seems like a few players are just painting accumulation/distribution barts in a rinse-repeat fashion. 

push price down, accumulate, pump price 300, distribute, dump price 300 etc. 
If you're in it for the long term, it makes more sense to buy out the dumps and get it cheap than to push the price up.  The dumps are so predictable at this point.  Just buy them out until the guy on the other side runs out of coins.  Pretty simple stuff.
Patience is the key here, a leading diagonal off of a pivot will often retrace deeply between to the 0.618 and 0.786 in an ABC Zigzag formation.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/ccy4Llnr/
Looked more like there were some huge hidden sell walls at 7600 to me. Multiple big buy orders (talking 200+ BTC) shouldve gone past 7600 easily but always ended up a few dollars or sometimes even cents below 7600. 
too many bulls got burned buying the top, so they don't chase the pumps any more

but buying the dip is nice and safe

of course that works until all the dip buyers run out of cash and then we have a massive sell off until you reach the more patient buyers. So i'm guessing this will play out like the drop from $8500..a few minor drops to $7300 that get bouhgt up, then drops to $7100 that won't, and then all the bulls that bought up their coins during the last 3 days will start dumping when $7,000 looks like its about to break down and then price just falls through the floor

The sharp sell offs are meaningless, as was the run up in December.  Both were artificial.  The cat is very much alive.  The three higher lows matter. The big shorts are about to capitulate in a big way, and we will reach a new ATH by late summer.

Of course, it's possible that the big bears will just be stubborn and keep giving their money away, but I doubt they're that dumb.
Probably because it's too obvious that everyone will just sell in the 7900\-8300 range. Who is left to buy in there?
I agree on the btc part. ETH has someone with 1 million coins that might be interested in selling (eos).
If that is true no one ib their right mind should be buying now unless the plan is to hold long time. 
I think the number of longs in trouble vastly outweighs the number of shorts in trouble. 
lol bro its nice trading right now. I think you can easily spot those dual barts on the charts, I too just noticed them today. Market isn't bearish nor bullish, it is both bearish and bullish at the same time during a 1-3 day period. 

I love BFX! Anyway, we have knocked on $7,600 a few times now. There are hidden sell walls in place, those are major barriers we can cross, otherwise we could fall. The first time I noticed the wall was at $7,599.7 and earlier today at $7,599,8. I consider these more important than other resistances. 

I am thinking its just a matter of time before we build enough pressure and blast through anything. That's what I make off it. hehe.
Nothing like the relief of exiting a position we are uncomfortable with. There's always another day.
Still love you. 
Happened to be watching the charts and market closed on the way up. I've got alarms at 7650 and 7320. Shutting off till then.
You're expecting a crash? 
On the weekly, that has only happened twice before.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/QsCraIAe/
Thanks for your chart/ I am quite new to TA. What kind of confirmation of this div is expected? 
did you trade with confidence?
I still have emails saved from Coinbase when I was DCA down from $800 or so in early 2014. Good times
Ok
You're a prophet!
take it back! let us move!!! you need to declare the new true price of bitcoin so we can get out of here man
Out of the woods? We can't even see the woods! 

 We are in a clearing, surrounded by an army of rapists and murderers, beyond that are the woods... Woods filled with paedo rapist murderers who want to sodomise our poor beaten cheap bodies, before throwing us to Roseanne Barr who wants to sit on our faces whilst she eats a Vindaloo.

That's pretty much where we are. 
  Pretty weak Bart with the lopsided head again.  The right side is always shorter and more expensive than the left side these days. 
The question is, is it the finish of an older bart or will it form a new inverted bart in 8-12 hours?
beat my shorts
textbook rising wedge broke down
Nice!!
There are 1-day bars.  Anybody who can't see that this is one of Bitcoin's famous "three higher lows" patterns, usually coming right before (within a month) a big run up in price shouldn't be trying to trade this.
I mean it’s not “crazy” or a “conspiracy theory”. It literally has done that for the past 6 months.
Removed. Rule 2
People still have disbelief that it can drop lower. When those buyers run out of funds, it will drop and then you'll see panic.

If there is one thing I've learned trading bitcoin, whenever I think a price is too high, it gets higher. Whenever I think I got a good deal, the deals get much better.

Right now we're in no man's land, and its not a good price to buy or sell. I'm waiting for a buy signal, and its seeming more and more likely it's going to be sub-6k.

Order books are massive at the 7k level, but I question how much of that is for show to prevent panic.
If it breaks 7600 with confidence I think we'll see a violent BGD to ~7850 from liqs and stops.  Too many people are seeing 7600 as a free short entry.
Perhaps u/L14dy was right...
Exactly, as long as there is no retest of 7000 I wont be fooled.
R/R *was* very good for shorters who aren't trading the daily. If you trade no/low leverage on the daily, then yes, it looks like we bounced off our pennant floor. You lose a lot of details in the daily, though, and the fact that we cannot seem to break 7600 is not at all bullish. We're also holding inside our descending channel and just broke down from a rising wedge. 

Until we break our descending channel (7750ish), I won't be particularly bullish. I wouldn't actually turn bullish until the market proves it can exit the pennant to the upside, currently over 9500 or so. We're a lot closer to breaking through the floor, at which point it feels inevitable that we're in an extended bear market.

Time to sell.
you mean overbought

wouldnt put too much faith in 15m charts though...rsi can go from overbought on the 15 to 50 by crawling upwards:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/HknsMPbE/ 
When analyzing the bbands of such longer timeframes, isn't it more probable that it will be a SUSTAINED move, rather than an abrupt, violent one?
unfortunate timing lol

just like $50 though. I personally don't understand why ppl are buying here if it's having so much trouble getting past $7600. could just wait for lower lol
nice
15m chart? Did you forget the /s ? :)
I am noticing that gradual price changes tend to be up where as sudden price changes can be up or down. 
that's not even trading more like betting on black which is always fun from time to time :P
I thought you’d sold up ? 
At least it's getting pretty tight now. Next one should be the real dildo. And it's going to be green 
why does it look like we are going to break out of the wedge upwards?
That might be why we're just drifting sideways for now. People (and especially market makers / whales) are waiting for the resistances to line up a bit closer before making any big moves.
What is the downsides of setting a stop loss at 7560 here?  
I'm thinking the same as you, but I'm not sure why I shouldn't just set a stop and ~~get~~ hope for a better entry instead of trusting that 7600-7700 won't all break.
My short entry is 7566.  
Edit: misspelling and wording.
Yeah, it seems that people in this sub are forgetting that resistance at 7,700\-7,800 is even stronger than the one we are trying to break now.
Looks like we will break from our wedge by endless horizontal movement
Lol at your edit.

Last time I did that  kind of mistake I accidentally doubled my position. Was worth it ;-)
I hope we won't get to 7.7 before breaking it down.
Actually feels like bullville in here, bulls are back downvoting the bear posts, excited about their ~~$500~~ now $350 3\-day move and failing to realize the current market climate.
Why's that?
Johny dont regret it and set your stops
why?

There's no reason for issues with VISA to impact the price of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not a visa competitor in any way. 
Visa permanently and irreparably going down might affect the price, but a temporary outage? Of course not.

Eth is slowly bleeding. I can see btc staying sideways until this eth mess with eos get sorted. 
Yep, we'll be hitting the downtrend from 10k later today and I'm also eyeing a break up from this triangle/wedge. This would produce a nice flip on the MacD daily which will result in a rally up to 7800-8000. Most importantly, everyone will start piling in because the 8.8k target at the top of the pennant seems like a near certainty at that point. I think we'll stall before breaking 8k and going back down to 7600 to confirmed resistance turned support, and considering the lack for overall volume, could very well see us breaking below towards the lower bound of the pennant. But that we'll have to see when we get closer.

Chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/assEGomL/
Yeah, talk about seeing what you want to see. That was probably the most perfect rising wedge + volume profile I've seen BTC paint in a long time. 
rising wedge, no? Textbook rising wedge on the weekly woth fitting volume profile
Yeah, that's why you short top of the wedge with stops above in case of break up.
It might be misplaced hopium/desperation, but I'm not really impressed until we get past 7250. I'm seeing some decently sized orders going through in Finex and this seems like nothing more than another little shakeout for the stop losses. 

All of this is cautious though, if we break through 7250 - which is a conservative target for the wedge breakdown - then I think we'll see (much) more downside. 

Edit: I'm not a believer in IH&S's anymore, this is based on trends + supports. Moreover, I'm finding this whole price movement to be very similar to our 6400 range. Longs/shorts ratio is starting to tip and bears are feeling pretty confident. I'm excited to see the resolution of this range. 
....what?
http://www.tradinggeeks.net/2014/05/technical-analysis-in-excel-part-ii/
EOS sent most of their remaining ETH to bitfiniex earlier today, I think that's more of a reason than anything else. Someone linked an article earlier.
Its ratio against BTC is breaking down from the rising wedge.
If ETH/BTC are fixed then why does the ratio they're traded on fluctuate so much?
Check out EOS/ETH 15 min chart and ETH/USD chart..EOS going up while ETH going down..are they converting ETH to EOS?


EOS launched today, right?  Doesn't have anything to do with BTC.

Best exit shorts can hope for today is around $7350, and even that is just hope.  Every minute we get closer to quitting time for the working-class Bitcoiners is perilous for shorts. People get off work, see that their bills are paid, and buy on Friday evenings at the beginning of a new month.  Remember the BGD back in April? That was a Friday evening.
Good call.

Not so fast ol chap, not so fast
How low could it go?

https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZmgIJgEC/

Pick any of these:

* 5.0k - Previous Major ATH (Fill the chart gap)
* 3.2k - WXY 0.618 Extension
* 2.6k - HVF Method Target
* 1.3k - Classic Charting Target

Don't expect to buy the spike low, but if we do go down here I would expect an extended period of low volatility accumulation. For example a spike down to 3.2k but an extended period chopping between 4k - 5k.

My money would be on the 3.2k target.
Some random dude in an elevator at a casino 4 months ago when BTC was 10k+ told me it was going to $4000.


4.5k absolutely. Even Goldman named it as a bottom, so I'll probably go all in at that point. Will abandon at a break below 4k or something. It's simply a too good opportunity to give up at that point. 

Small disclaimer though, it really depends on the way how we get there; if we're talking extended bear market with a slow-bleed in which we don't hit 4.5k untill  september or so I might reconsider, but if there's any type of velocity to the dump I'm game. 
Why do I have to buy if I can just increase my BTC holdings on the way there at no additional capital outlay?

Non-snarky reply: I'd probably commit additional fiat anywhere under $5K. 

edit: I'd probably commit additional fiat anywhere under $7K if I had a lot of additional fiat. 
When there are clear signs of reversal and after I've quit my shorts. If we keep falling I'm not going to catch any falling knives or guess any bottoms. 
Anything below 4 is a buy for me. 4.5 i'd start buying some in low amounts.
What triangle
Should work out well for you.  Things could get way out of control for the big shorts in a hurry.
Not a dig at you, but it's truly fascinating how people see what they want to see. The higher low on this dump is about the only "bullish" thing I see. That said, this market is schizophrenic, so any move wouldn't surprise me at this stage. I'm short from 7560 so I've got some room. 
I wouldnt be sure. Whales like to confuse us by going the opposite direction of flags
...and as i was typing that 150 sell order appeared again... lol

There are a number of bullish posters here that get upvoted for quality content. People get downvoted for trash/blinders posts, bullish or bearish. In general, the low-effort dumpster fire posts are heavily skewed bullish. 
I appreciate your post, u/occasionalredditor.  The replies you've received are a perfect example of why I, and I'm certain countless others, don't post when I have something I'd like to share.   Come on, u/jaderaj, this issue was part of your "platform" when applying for moderator.  OP was chided for sharing an opinion.   And his sentiment that this sub doesn't listen "to all sides of a given scenario" was most definitely supported by all of the rude replies.
I fail to see a bull div on the 4 hr. All I see are higher lows on both price and RSI. And if you're talking about the one from 7.38k to 7k over four days ago, that one has definitely already played out.

I agree a relief rally up to at least 7.8\-8.2 would make some sense, but as of yet buyers have shown absolutely zero follow through to anything above 7.6. That could change, but I'm hesitant to buy in before it does because the downside risk is heavy and bears have shown the capability to come out of hibernation at any time and actually provide some form of follow through.
We're still in the same range we were before...you expect people here to be able to predict every $50 movement?

There are plenty of people here who expect a relief rally to $7.8-8.2 but buyers have completely dropped the ball on pushing through. About 8 times now

And for what it's worth, most of the TA I'm seeing is neutral or disappointed with the lack of follow through from buyers as well.

the 4h bulldiv you're talking about most likely already played out. I mean it could continue to play out but...for whatever reason $7.6k is ironclad resistance
price went up $60 so far($7448-7520)

that's not even a 1% movement(.966%) 

the fact that bulls call this stuff a BGD just shows how desperate they are
What BGD? We went up less than 2%. Get off the 5 minute chart
Bollinger Bands were super thin.  There's usually a pop one way or the other when the BBands are that thin.  
I wouldn't close it on the first BGD unless it's a 10 percenter.
I assume many people buying here are just reloading mid-long term holdings after having sold around 9-11-15k+. Can't imagine 'they' would care much at all about pushing the price up, and in fact would be more likely to hold off buying as soon as things start getting too green for a bit.
drawing simpson porn, the resolution is just shit
reminds me of 9.3-9.4 all over again.  
if we even get over 7.6 then what, its not like buying pressure is magically going to turn up to wreck the much heavier resistances
Playing out the wedge?
Here's my theory: they stop buying because the resistance is still too strong, they're testing the resistance. Just look at what happens to the orderbooks and trade list as soon as we approach 7.6k.
I agree. I’m comfortable sitting fiat right now and got the popcorn out for the next couple of days.

I see no reason to trade this right now.
Seriously fuck buyers in the current environment. I've never seen such irrational behaviour. We're knocking for the fifth time now on the horizontal resistance, 100th if you look at the 15 min chart.
Only thing is bitcoin almost 'broke out' last time we hit 6500 and we double bottomed so I'm not sold yet.
Despite all the hate. Bitmex. Use the futures and you won't pay any fees. Perfect for longer time positions. Potential risk: Future price diverges from spot. Potential benefit: Future price diverges from spot. 
Bitmex 
There is always the ratio to consider; and I would not count them to always go in lockstep. (I'm not discounting what you said.)
how is the fact that BTC is leading this dump all on its own bad for shorting? 


Buyers getting cold feet at $7,600 for the 3rd time in as many days.

There doesn't always need to be an external catalyst for price movement.
Czeckslomania banned bitcoin.
IMO, it's a single person who is coming to terms that they are the last person to sell the "15-20k bottom". They can't handle being wrong.

You heard that right ... it's one, stupid, sadist, narcissistic ... mother fucker.



Wow, 2k. I never thought a bear would warrant the D word.
I don't get the logic of bottom frankly , to me it seems that the more BTC crashes the less people care , if it crashes to 2k it will be just overtaken by another currency , it's already lost quite a lot of its market dominance

Never a great point to buy ETH.  What a POS.  Blockchain has been reset twice in its short history.

Shouldn't eth be crashing, and taking btc with it? I don't understand how it isn't.
Butthurt ETH boys down voting..this is relevant info for BTC market also..
I'm currently holding a short on ETH from 578 for this reason.  Considering taking any targets just to see what happens.
[removed]
How would you say this would affect ETH and EOS?
I think this volatility is just what happens when there's a market with a whole lot of traders who entered only a few years ago but have holdings that cost them 0.05% or less of what they're now worth. 
I was thinking about this.  How much influence might some of the large permabulls like the Winklevoss twins have if they wanted to help stabilize BTC?  The best thing for BTC would be to keep it relatively stable in price and moderate growth.

Eventually due to scarcity if it was adopted as a currency/store of value it would necessarily increase in price to accommodate the additional value stored, but right now it is speculative, where the price is somewhat arbitrary.  Before that happens if the price stayed within a reasonable 5-10% band with a 10% annual growth it would look more and more "legit" and bring in more non-speculative interest.

>You're selling/shorting a triple bottom.


Yes, because a tripple bottom reversal isn't bullish until resistance has been broken. We're not even close to breaking said resistance, what's your point?


You're calling the bottom too early but yeah we get what you mean. For the record tho Im adding to my short at the triple bottom.
but I thought you stopped trading because you were bad at it and preferred to hold :P
Bearish.
Looks like a descending triangle to me 
How? Can you even show me one low effort bearish comment? 

As opposed to the 12 low effort bullish comments here?

Why is this place suddenly filled with noobs upset with people shorting? 

Really, I don't mind if people are bullish/go long. Makes sense, fair enough. But there is a vast difference in the quality of comments on here vs /r/cryptocurrency. 

Agreed. Since day one futures was the worse possible thing to happen to crypto. It’s been a downhill slide since day one that futures were enabled. These aren’t investors in a promising tech that can change the future of money. These are flat out compulsive gamblers that use BTC like a dirty casino gambling machine. 
"Bearish bs" = calculating 75% probability, based on TA, that the price is more likely to significantly drop than significantly rise.

Soon CNBC did an article about bitcoin being bullish so the hype is on the way, start the downvotes 
You know that a lot of people are short from high above?

If this is a reversal there will be a lot of chances to get long big. If this is beginning of next drop you may not get better shot than 7.6 short.
This is a trading sub. Please go away.

Congrats. I don't know if it occurred before, but you're the first person that I've seen use Bart as a verb. 
it's either an ih&s or rising wedge, the triangle just looks funky, I don't think those can be drawn that way. 

anyway the volume profile a wedge the best, and it really is pretty textbook:

How did you get 7.3 support?
It's not about being right, it is about why. Just making a comment like "I think" or "Looks like" for no reason is low effort and helps no-one. It just clogs up the daily thread and pushes useful posts down.

EOS moved over 250k ETH to Bitfinex some hours ago. Not very bullish. Etherscan details in the horrible Ethtrader sub
What's the resistance line of eth atm?
Eth only leads dumps not pumps. Remember what happened in Dec / Jan? And I feel the only real reason why Eth “leads” dumps is because it is traded against bitcoin which in turn brings the price of bitcoin down.

Thanks... I think?

It gets like this in periods of consolidation. It's hard to make a profit trading when the price only fluctuates a few percent a week.
It was initially downvoted. That tells you just how beartarded the market is right now.
We can trade within that triangle untill August...
Pretty sure bottom was found @7K. Well see how the week goes.
That would mean breaking the triangle. Too many people watching it to buy up that dip.
My chart is meant to illustrate historically rare (there are only two that are confirmed in the history of Bitcoin) stable market bottoms. It also tries to outline how those bottoms can be illustrated against long-term trading ranges. It's relevant in this discussion, but I don't think it says a lot about pump cycles.
The million dollar question is whether the bear market would've happened anyway as the upward trajectory was simply unsustainable OR if the news caused it.  Good arguments for both sides.
where u at fam
Care to share why?

3800 while still quite high in the grand scheme of things is really low for an asset class that has significantly more volume profile than back in September (last time we saw 3800 was something like Sept 20)

We consistently hit multi billion dollar 24 hour volume (its almost 5bn today), which means even if mainstream isn’t interested, someone is. Back in september it was more like single digit billion dollar volume

Seems strange to anticipate another 50% drop after a ~70% drop from ATH. Support at 5500 would have to get violated pretty quickly considering the fact that we’re almost in summer.

3 months to drop by 50% is a bit of an ask imo

So care to share why?

Also, if you anticipate 3800, you must be short. Just sold your coins or naked shorting Bitcoin?
I’ll set stops above 8k.

Won’t be constantly refreshing Binance like my life depends on it, so just going to set alerts and enjoy my golf trip. 

Thanks Hass 
You didn't ask me but thought I'd chime in. I've still got my long opened and waiting to close it on another test of the bottom of that wedge and will open a short from there. I've been saying this whole time I'm expecting another retest of 7.1k atleast, but its taking a lot longer than I first expected. I'll also be going long from 7.1k if we get there \- I don't believe we'll break it this time around.
Holding a short for the last 2 days amid this fuckery. Got in too early so my position is currently underwater. But yeah, my initial target is that pivot S1-0.7fib area but at this point I think if it really breaks we will test the bottom of the triangle for real this time. Stops above 7600.
It would certainly explain why some of the article clearing talking about past events is written in present tense.
I would rather have that than allowing somebody to impersonate me with a compromised email address and steal my funds.

Which is why I’ve moved my target up. If it blows past it, I think there should be a decent chance of catching it at the same levels I closed my position. 

I’d be very happy if this was the bottom but I’m not ruling an extended bear market out.
The market is finally agreeing on a price range?

During the last 3 months we've been from $11.5k to $6.9k to $9.8k to $7.3k...doesn't seem like much agreement to me

BART is actually B.A.R.T. Which stands for Buy Against Reversing Trends. When you see the price spiking and then quickly reverse repeatedly it's a solid TA confirmation of the B.A.R.T. formation. This formation works best on lower time frames.

Upon inspecting a B.A.R.T. formation the Moving Average Response to Gained Elevation is the standard deviation with respect to the local highs and local lows.

B.A.R.T. formations are typically seen as a breakout from a long sideways trend commonly referred to as a skating.
I'll believe it when I see it!

Last time we had such a problem it dumped badly....
So, when he said that, is he talking on a plate, fork and knife, with some ketchup or more of an autofellatio thing?

Asking for a friend
Hey, anyone who traded on that sentiment has come out on top for quite a while, no?

I will deff be surprised if we are significantly outside of 7500 for a sustained amount of time.

I wont eat my dick though...
$7250, because that would negate the idea that this is a higher low  *and* invalidate the HBDiv
You probably mean 7,600 mate. I guess we spent too much time barting in 8xxx :\)
TBH, there is a high chance it will be a scalp trade and close at the top of the channel. But if there is a short squeeze then there could be a week of upside.  I really don't know.  Like i said below 20% position, 2% stop, small gamble.

EDIT: Im all cash, waiting to buy back below the long term triangle later this year.
The 2012 line is projected from just before the start of an extended and unprecedented period of stability that followed from finding a market bottom.

If we're actually entering a period of stability, then I expect something like the following:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/f8mMjUUt/
https://www.tradingview.com/x/QsCraIAe/

I took the only two periods in the past WHERE **weekly RSI is descending to historically lows levels** AND there is a **6 + week following period where Weekly BBand width is less than 40%**

55 weeks is an arbitrary period of time that I marked on the chart. It's irrelevant other than the fact that it makes the pattern easier to see and it highlights the difference between price performance in preceding periods of price stability.
Here's the same chart when RSI isn't a factor:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/f8mMjUUt/
yea it's def not a triangle

I think he thinks this is it: https://www.tradingview.com/x/ACuIMEmU/


Yeah I'm more of a wedge guy here too. Ascending triangles are usually continuation patterns, and this would be a reversal. Not unheard of, but still.
I'm trying it. Opened both a long and short with an equal (low) amount with no stops. If/when BTC hits $7,675 I'll close the long (for a 2% gain). If/when it hits $7,375 I'll close the short (for a 2% gain). Normal position and trades otherwise. I may, for example, add to the short at $7,675 and add to the long at $7,375. It should hit both - eventually. Right? But it sure *feels* like $7,675 will be harder to hit than $7,375. Trading against myself? Lightsaber rektage? Or sure profits in-channel with steal patience? We'll see. Why not. 48 hours on the clock.    
 not exactly

1. you get two limit orders, so you get paid twice

2. You can set a market stop for both and only pay 0.025% fees

3. This strategy works even when servers are overloaded
Minus 0.01% funding.
Yes, but without having to guess the bottom or top correctly. Guessing, instead, that the price will range around this level.  
 
**Edit:** By ranging, I mean like Benjen Stark ranging North of The Wall.
Curious to know what you think about the next day, OES mainnet launching, they've transferred 200k eth just this morning from their crowdsale wallet to finex. 

I'm really not a trader but I like to read people here and since few weeks I have the feeling eth was driving the dance a little bit more than it was before. Are you only trading based on your TA of BTC chart or in days like this you add external element like, eos is dumping a lot of eth and brind the price down so BTC will probably follow it ?

Btw, thanks for your contribution to this daily, I really like few of you guy's, I'm an expat of ethtrader, there's no more people like you overthere! :P
I love how buyers even bothered to buy the dip at 7350 after getting rejected at 7600. 

A rejection at 7350 isn’t good for sellers but the way that buyers have been acting is just weird. 


The same with the sp500.. seems like we need a bull there too
The only positive things for the people shorting is they eventually give up. They can only prop the price up for so long before pulling the rug from underneath. 

At least it gives us nice short opportunities. 
I dont doubt it.

If i had the power to do that, I definitely would 
This is interesting.  How much of your overall trade analysis is Elliot wave? How valuable do you find it?  Thinking of learning here

Always find your charts helpful!
would be too nice to be true 
If it plays out like that I’ll be pretty happy. Made a killing shorting that lol 
Interesting insight. At a macro level, the economy had started to recover from QE and low interest rates by 2011, when the price continued to drop after a temporary recovery from the triple bottom. I guess gold wasn’t needed as a store of value at this time?
Where did I say it was 50/50? Where did I say nobody has a clue? I was trying to provoke discussion. Thanks for your insight.
It's a Mexican standoff probably, sellers lined up at 7.8, buyers at 6.8-7. The problem with that, is when one's investment doesn't grow he eventually cashes out for more rewarding ventures.
Clearly.
If buyers don't take this opportunity and push through $7,600 right here, then I honestly have absolutely zero sympathy for anyone on the planet who winds up losing money longing Bitcoin in the immediate future.

If this drops, it's a mess of their own making.
that is not my concusion, just tried to figure out how helpful this google trends curve is in general.
yes. to 8K
TBH those weekly bbands are looking scary...
Confirmation of it as a true local high in both price and OBV. If you want to call it early, you could say the single red hour confirmed it, but I'm usually a bit more cautious with divergence and wait for it to develop a little more.

To me it's an early indicator this small flag could be slightly biased towards breaking downwards though.
We all did. That was one of the main issues. 😐
for now ;)
I hve to admit that there is a small piece of me that actually believes that my “fair price of Bartcoin” meme has somehow influenced the Bitcorn gods and the market magically gravitates towards the price I deem fair.

I know it’s ludicrous... but leave me be :)
The best comment of today :D
BTC in a nutshell
people were saying the same thing when we crashed from $8500 

hell I was posting too "haha weak bears, can't even get through $8,200"

then it just kept crashing and crashing with no bounces and a few days later we were fighting for our lives at $7,100
Yep. That was easy enough for even me to get right! Short towards resistance and put alarm on for breaking it (to avoid catching a wick).

Now if it could continue dropping for a bit, that would be lovely 
So now that we're outta the wedge. Time to go long for 7600.
yeah, the question is how far down this will go. 

I'm not seeing as much support at $7000 as we had on the first leg down, so I think it'll break through on this attempt 

and then there is nothing on the order books until $5,500
When has bitcoin ever done the three higher lows pattern? 

2015 recovery was a few capitulation wicks (to the same price) with sideways in between. 

Every correction in 2017 was a V bottom/huge bounce *right* after a massive sell off

None of this sideways with no capitulation wicks bullshit 
Lol@famous. You my man, are trying too hard. 

I really do wonder how many noobs you can brainwash or "stoke" with your bs. But since your position (if you put your money where your ass is) creates liquidity for mine, I'll take it. 
Until we go below 6800, there is no reason to expect sub 6k

Can we all just please trade the chart. If you truly believe Bitcoin is going to 3k, then you shorted at 10k+.

So please don’t waste our time with this whole “Its going to goblin town”

If it goes below 6800... then yes.. Goblin town is highly likely
Possible, for sure, but it's also possible that this time will play out differently.
> When those buyers run out of funds, it will drop and then you'll see panic.

Not if those sellers run out of funds. If all the sell pressure dries up it takes little buy pressure to move the prices up.
If people are entering shorts around 7600, unless they're using crazy leverage it'll have to push up a lot further to actually liquidate them. 

I think the way we'll break 7600 is to drop to 7k and slowly build up from there. 
Breaking 7.6k with conviction would put us just over daily EMA 12. That's the next confirmation I'm waiting for.
So far ;)
You still out?
Yep. 8K next week
haha yes overbought, sorry first thing in the morning for me xD. Volume also dropping off here too. I predict we drop back to $7500 and then another push up
could be both, it just tells us a bigger move is very likly as pressure starts to boil. 
not too worried about it. Stops are above 7600. R/r is good.
lol looks like im fucked. Lets see what happens though, its not like a sideways action was unexpected.
I don't think it's ppl. It's a whale who is trying to make this situation as confusing as possible. The traders still remaining are arguably "better" traders than before, so the whale is trying to fuck with our minds
7545 now, dont see us going up too much. I think we should be below 7300 within the week.
That's one of the most popular timeframes for daytrading. What of it?
Lol, if you check the chart in my original post you'll see what i was looking for, I circled it on the previous dip.  This just looks like a bear flag.
yeah that's why some basic formations like rising wedges work quite well, buyers slowly buying closer to a local top, then it breaks out or down
well at least I got the market maker pay! 
sold up? You mean exited my crypto positions? Yest 95% of them last week, still have some at bitmex  since that the only place worth it with those conditions
What? I'm short so I'm obviously not strongly anticipating an upwards movement. I don't have a strong opinion either way but the r/r seems good shorting here plus its a hedge against my holdings. My point was just that I'm wondering why some people are focusing only on us breaking up or down from the wedge, if we break up from the wedge I'm not sure I would want to long or close a short there with all the resistance right above it. But i mean idk we could always BGD right through all that, I was genuinely curious as to opinions/reasons why that resistance should be disregarded on a breakout so i don't get reckt holding on too long.
idk i mean im a noob but it seems like we could easily breach 7560 and then crash back down from 7600ish or lower. Thats also trading on a smaller timeframe than im currently looking at.

Edit: I'm only considering loosening my stops because my position is small enough I could comfortably add at those levels if i really wanted to.
This will invalidate the wedge.
Well happy I closed my short. Woke up pretty happy. May re short here 
That would be pretty irritating. But you have to expect it in this market currently. 

I have some heavy short orders from 7650-7750 so I wouldnt be too mad with a push that direction. 

Would it be nice to test 7k again to establish it as strong support? Yes. 
lol yeah the longer this goes on the more comfortable I feel here actually   

sentiment is opposite of before BGD 
We’re above 7400 for quite a while, yesterday attempt at taking us down failed miserably and a gut feeling. We spent a lot if time in the red, if bears can’t get us to the glorious 6800 than goblin town is canceled 
He is delusional (:
I’m using my own stack to long/short so if we go downtown I’ll DCA and wait it out
Because the mad dumpers are out of coins to sell cheap. If they could do it, we'd already be sub 3K. Everybody wants Bitcoin. Soon the mad dumpers will see how foolish they've been and join the winning team.
Looks like it's about to break down ;-)
Yeah btc isn't meant to be spent
yeah thats why I went fiat...well that and the fact that alts are already starting to bleed out
Yup. It was so perfect that I started to worry that it may actually break up and didn't add at 7.6 :/
Put the quotes cause for some people it was an ascending triangle :P
I'm familiar with basic trading setups bud.

There are different trading style and setups that work for different people my dude. 
check 4h chart, we had such wick up down on the left side...
Fixed?  You seem to be confused.

Generally ETH/BTC will follow btc movements but amplify the magnitude.  i.e. BTC drops 1% ETH drops 1.5%, BTC goes up 2% ETH goes up 3%, etc.  I generally chart BTC but trade ETH for this reason.

In this case ETH dropped first and BTC didn't really budge, which seemed odd.  Now that we have history on our side I do see BTC dropping (as expected).

This is all for short-term.  Long term of course it walks all around depending on the market.
>are they converting ETH to EOS?

Does it work that way?
lol @ thinking the BGD was a bunch of working class joes getting their paychecks and simultaneously panic buying bitcoin at 7 am 
> Remember the BGD back in April? That was a Friday evening.

It was actually 4AM on Friday morning (7AM UTC).

lets assume you do not have BTC holdings because you have sold at a higher point in the past.
> edit: I'd probably commit additional fiat anywhere under $7K if I had a lot of additional fiat. 

lol, nice edit. Last time a bought a large chunk was sub 7k. ETH was sub 400. For long term holding I’m completely fine with that position. Note that I sold 50% of my long term holdings when BTC was above 15k. I’d buy significantly at or below 6.5k, but I’m still not certain that’ll happen. 
Was on my phone, sorry.

Was referring to the sym triangle on the daily, following up with a chart:

[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/p9IVeJsI\-Symmetrical\-triangle\-on\-the\-daily\-BTCUSD/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/p9IVeJsI-Symmetrical-triangle-on-the-daily-BTCUSD/)
I see the same thing as the guy you're responding to. The higher low is a big deal because it's the third one.  If you zoom out one year on the one-day candles, it's easy to see how the ATH is totally surmountable.  Once you've been in this for a while, these patterns start to look familiar.  It's just a matter of time before the float tightens to the point where the only direction we can go is up.  It looks like someone is buying out all the dumps.  If they're sending some coins to cold storage, the float tightens.  If some of the coins being dumped are borrowed, we have all the makings of some very big green candles on all time frames.

[edit -- I would also like to add that in the real world, I don't know anyone who is selling so these dumps definitely appear to be manufactured, not the result of flash panics.]

"Time is money" takes on a whole new meaning when you're hodling or even trading Bitcoin.

I think people who think 3k is on the table are borderline senile.

Yes, its possible. Anyone who thinks it will happen with any level of certainty is just ridiculous.

Keep your short open with stops at break even hoping for 3k, fine.

But anyone who will keep adding to their short on the way down anticipating 3k will probably short the shit out of the bottom IMO
it was a typo... I think.. 3 must be an 8
It’s been the only consistent trend we got going.

I'm not a TA wizard myself, I just read and try to catch up.
I actually tried to follow through myself and contribute towards it. But I am failing more than I am being successful now. If we don't cross $7,600, I will be out and definitely consider shorting it. 
Motion of the ocean man.... 
oh wow. I never look at 5 min chart. That looks pretty damn impressive on there. lol
Even in that case, probably won't close more than 20%, 50% at most. 

Time goes fast but it has been 4 months already since the bottom, 4 months we've been in this tightning sideways. I want a long that can be held for a long time, the potential upside is too great to pass up.
I don't think people buying here have a  plan really, usually those kinda people set limit orders or some shit nah? 

I think these people are traders like panic buying

I mean yea it could be whoever. I'm just annoyed that the market keeps trying to push through and can't do it. 

-_____- 

do it or give up I say!
yea I personally don't understand who they think is gonna suddenly show up and take this higher. but oh well, their spirits cannot be broken
oh yea I just mean if it doesnt happen here then why the hell are they buying. the wedge doesnt *have* to happen that way, it can still break down before this. 
someone's fucking with the market, or the bots, because every time we go lower, they fill the order books up real fat on the bid side. and then when we go up they fill it on the ask side. They have about 1k coins

Sure! Good to bear that in mind.
What i meant was I wouldn't open here ($73XX range) until ETH shows weakness. If you got an entry up in the wedge then great!! A few people have been getting caught shorting the dip the last couple of days.
I thought reaching that point wouldnspark further gains? 
Standard FUD from the Czeks. 
It's probably not just one, but I'm with you. It's highly irrational and costing them a fartton of money.
why is 2k so ridiculous then? I didn't say it would happen, merely that it can't exactly be ruled out can it 
> if it crashes to 2k it will be just overtaken by another currency

Such as what? and why?
I think people are just losing interest in crypto in general

Volumes are down across the board for everything. Pumps on alts are much weaker too.

People just don’t trust any moves up, so they don’t buy if they miss a move. 

Most crypto traders aren’t traders but holders. And holders just lost faith that if they buy and just wait things out that they’ll be profitable. 
Rename to bitcoin bear cave?
Can you see this going past 7600?
They have been doing it for months already. Here's a post from a couple of weeks back:

https://www.reddit.com/r/eos/comments/8hpiie/eos_is_cashing_out_210k_eth_sent_to_bitfinex/
Yeah and Tron is great woo
Ironically there are more comments like yours on Ethtrader than his
It's 5% of ETH's market cap. There should be discussion about it and how it impacts BTC, but what I'm seeing is pathetic.
It's getting reported, but I'm leaving it up. I downvoted you because of the lack of discussion.

On the surface, this belongs in the alt thread. 5% of ETH's market cap going to an exchange should produce discussion about the tail wagging the dog... or something. Two trailing comments and a link is insufficient. If it's important alt news then have a longer discussion, make a self post, support your claims... put your back into it.

Edit: if the level of discussion I'm seeing here is all we have to say about it's relationship to BitcoinMarkets then I'll pivot and interpret the discussion as off topic. It at least needs to have a chance to get on topic.
If eth dumps btc dumps, its relevant
:/ 

5% of ETH's market cap going to an exchange seems like legit news. Discussion about the tail wagging the dog should follow. I'm downvoting for the lack of discussion, but I'm leaving it up.
What you mad?
EOS will will likely use it to buy their own coins to create a FOMO run on launch. Bit tin foil-ey, sorry
Well they could be using it to stabilize EOS after mainnet launch or dump ETH for USD and pay for running a business 
https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/volatility-index/
Look, I'm buying this shit. I know what it is.
Knock yourself out.
95% of 'buy and hold'ers are guys who sucked at trading, so they are delusionally bullish trying to convince others to buy their bags...
No, I've said this numerous times. I don't trade Bitcoin because it's a store-of-value, buy the corrections/sell the ATH, and I make much more trading ALTs ...
Bear it up!
This. The extent of the bullish posts have equated to "Because moon" or "Go fuck yourself". There is a bullish case to be made, but if anything its salty bulls that are the issue in this thread.
I think some people take exception with shorters, because the bulls are ardent fans of bitcoin and want it to succeed as soon as possible.   They see shorters as increasing price volatility which could be a factor in delaying the mass adoption of bitcoin as a currency, since this would require a stable bitcoin price.  So naturally shorters/bears are looked at as an obstacle.   

I also felt this way as a newb, but have come to tolerate bears, as I don’t expect the price to stabilize until we get north of of 150k. There needs to be a lot more people holding and using it first.  Could take years. 
They are projecting their own holdings and can't explain their decision to hold during an obvious downturn other than hodl is the one true path.
Cause they catched falling knife hoping it'll moon in next 24h.
Yea lol , probabilities of what? Another Bart? Give me a break 
Thought about $7,599.9, but I think I can manage my risk better with $30 lower position in case I need to run. lol.
you are making me more confused lol
The punishment fits the crime.
Doubt we have many traders here that are short from $7000, but to be fair I'd be sweating fucking bullets here if I was with any kind of leverage. Being 5% underwater on a short is a whole lot more uncomfortable than on a long, imo, especially given the place and time here. 

Then again, I'm a dumb permabull. Maybe it's just the mooooooonjuice speaking!
Thanks!!!
Maybe he meant pop as pop the bubble?
Excuse me? How was what he said not related to trading?
[removed]
which other 2 linesdo you have in your chart?
IHS? That needs a lot of imagination.
people seeing an ascending triangle there is just wishful thinking. Rising wedge could break up though, but not very probable. Looking to close my long (from low 7400) and open a short around 7600
[removed]
[removed]
[https://www.tradingview.com/x/5OUCoZjA/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/5OUCoZjA/)  those three green bars seem good support levels to me. 
It's a wedge. If it goes up then it will break up which will be bullish as hell.
That's an ascending triangle if we count wicks.

Ok, this is funny now.
Yep, ETH is pulling like a train!
Really? Do you have source? Larmier needs the dump to continue, ay?
Seems to be a wick. 

Disclaimer: Im out of position. Would be short on BTC if it wasn't for the ATH shorts on ETH. Feel like they could be a catalyst for a big move up, but not betting on it.
I hear what you are saying mate.  But ETH rebounded from its dump at 1.00 (UTC) way quicker than BTC, I watched it, 2 charts side by side.  Was a leading indicator to close your BTC shorts.
OGs use Depends^tm + StadiumPal^tm. 
This is what makes me feel bad about this market. :/
I fully believe you. This is more humour than anything else. However, I enjoy this coincidence. And the poetic side in me \(not the realistic one\) wants to see an illuminati typ of 666 manipulation conspiracy ;\-\)
I'd really like for that to be true.  Just being cautious with my expectations for now.
I guess it depends how you draw it/which exchange, but that's where I have the support line around June 4th/5th.
Right, but I guess my point is that if we are comparing the two bubbles then we're definitely not at the same point in the cycle as we were in 2014 in terms of days since ATH.
Go look at the mtgox chart, there was another bubble back in 2011.
>Good arguments for both sides

There's never just one reason for a bear market, but I do think the news played a huge role. Bad news have a chain effect - some people start selling because of the news -> the price drops -> more people start selling because the price drops -> less people want to buy, hoping to buy lower -> price drops even more.. Buyers are discouraged and boom you have a bear market.
One could argue that without mtgox faking order data, the 2013 bear market would have lasted a lot longer. 2013 bear market was too short, which made 2014 bear market extra long, which made the 2015-2017 bull market extra long. The forces seem to be balanced now, so maybe we will get something in between (but probably closer to 2014 imo).
[deleted]
SFO. This is the most insane line I’ve ever seen
> We consistently hit multi billion dollar 24 hour volume (its almost 5bn today), which means even if mainstream isn’t interested, someone is

How much of that is wash trading? We can't confirm how much of the volume is legit.
Yes it is very strange, lots of people just spout out random ridiculously low numbers hoping what they say here magically makes the price go there.
I'm not trolling you but you just said that *this time it's different*, which you know... Anyway, nobody knows. In previous cases we've seen it go under 0.786 which is at 3600 EUR. So 3000 EUR is not an unreasonable 'bottom'. And if that happens bitcoin remains totally bull. 
Good move, i'd say we could be in this range for a little bit longer(few hours maybe).  You should get an opportunity. Keep your eye on ETH, should give you a signal when you're running out of time. (It's not far from breaking its low).

If we can hold 71XX I'm expecting a green weekly candle next week. and *possibly* the week after.  A long from here should be a keeper for a bit anyway.

Unsure what i'll do if we get a lower low within the triangle.  Good luck mate, hope you get you entry!


Is the red line the bottom of the triangle?
Ha, story of my life.  Trying to get better at not entering too early myself.  Closed 3 shorts over the last few days in this range. Should have only entered on this one.

You should be OK, i think It'll come down lower than 7280.
Yeah you're right. 2FA is as important as it gets. I just wish I can disable it while its still enabled and get the code
We are ranging between 7k and 8k for longer than before. No BGD to suddenly take us to another price range. Overall the market has been in 7K-8k range far longer than any other price.
Dude you should submit this to investopedia
Excellent, the first good explanation I've had the joy to read. Please educate us about B.G.D.
yea as soon as we all get bored/comfortable it has this habit of shutting us all the fuck up
Mmmm I’m ordering a takeaway pizza now.

No ketchup though, fuck no ketchup!
Most definitely my man 
Thanks. Quite a big gap I would say assuming we really struggle to break the 7,600. 
Yup, I saw this, don't like how it's drawn. There should be drop to beginning of the triangle and then establishing horizontal. Here we have establish of horizontal, then a drop and then horizontal again. If we count this triangle from bottom then there's just 1 touch point.

Doesn't seem right. If you draw a wedge it's perfect.
Yes that is the one I am referring to.  
The last bart-down conformed to my prediction, namely did not go below $7350. Still think this mother is heading upwards, albeit slowly for now.
why not at least place take profit orders in place, if a big candles comes and bounce back ?
True to all 3, just mainly talking about the profitability behind the concept rather than the technical details that could allow for some profit. Although I used to remind people of #3 all the time :P
Nope, you still have to guess the top/bottom correctly. I had someone explain this to me a while back too- trust me, it's literally the same thing as opening a short/long at what you think is the top/bottom.

think about it. Where do you close each one? Wherever you close your long is effectively where you think you should short. Which means you didn't even have to short in the first place, you could've just waited to short it higher. 
I pretty much only follow BTC and I try to eliminate as many external factors as possible when I'm making my trading decisions. 

I stick to charts, for the most part. 

So, unfortunately I don't really have an oppinion on OES mainnet or ETH in general.
People generally don't care about altcoins here, at all. BTC is the dog, ETH could probably go to 0 without much of an effect.
I use a combination of EW, TD and Volume Profile to give me target areas that let me use price action (Candle Formations) to give me setups. I am also trying to incorporate more volume/price analyse (VPA) into my charts at the moment.

EW is not 'easy', it is a complex set of rules and guidelines that often fit in different ways to the same chart, leading to a subjective analyse of the price action. It is important to always have and maintain at least 2 different 'counts' of what you are looking at. What it is good at is telling you where to look for things to happen and where you are wrong.

EW theory often explains the common patterns we all know and love and goes further to explain where you are likely to be in a trend once they occur. See a wedge, well they can only occur at the start or end of a larger trend. See a triangle, well they can only occur as the penultimate formation, see an explosive gap in the chart, that is often a W3.

While EW is a trading model, it is not a trading system, you need to use other metrics to verify your model and take high probability trades. 

For example, if I see a TD9 Buy coming up, as the price is approaching an EW target and a reversal candle is produced. That is the setup I want to wait for.
$18k was too nice to be true 
Yes good thoughts on the subject.  But (the majority of) what makes these patterns all look so similar is human psychology (greed, fear etc) coupled with a speculative investment.  The majority of people were just looking to make money trading gold ETFs etc.

Triple bottoms *can* work, but I personally wouldn't bet on one.

BTC tripple bottomed before : https://www.tradingview.com/x/faFKpD0A/

EDIT: added (the majority of)
Ok, poor reading comprehension on my part. 
That's why I sold GE early last year and bought GBTC. Best decision ever as it turns out.
Man, I am also very close to giving up on this. If this doesn't move up further than $7,600, that is it for me then. I won't be longing anymore perhaps and will consider shorting the coin moving forward.. :/
I don't know why you gave up so early, when the bottom of the wedge hasn't even been retested yet. This looks like classic re-test of the breakdown range before more downside, so far. Who knows if it'll just blast right through but it seems a bit early to close a short.
Dad voice Chewy =) 
 looks like they took the opportunity. 8400 here we come
Still ~50%. Not that tight yet. What's substantial ATM is the speed they are tightening. I think it will be another couple weeks before we're in a truly stable period. Also, anything could happen, but the market seems focused on pushing traders out and getting lean.
change it to $15000. but let us all know like...a few hours before, please
Order books? You trust those?Do you still believe in Santa Claus too?
Hey man, may be its because we are in 2018 now and things are not like 2017 anymore. I am just saying. hehe.
Look at September last year includeing and after the big V for but one example.

3K on 9/15, then up and down then 3600 9/22, 4250 on 10/5... afterwhich it didn't go down again until it had run up quite a ways.  Granted, our time frame here is longer, but look back and you'll see the same sort of thing right before the times when it went up drastically.
While I'm personally beginning to doubt all the calls for sub $5k (including my own) it is true that BTC never seems to..."go easy" on anything.

When people said $7.5k was crazy back when we were at $10k and hadn't even dropped below $9k yet, we dropped to $5.9k. 

When people said $10k was absolutely bonkers back at $1k it got to $20k...

Shit goes hard af and only turns around once people seem to have been punished/rewarded to an extreme.

Crypto bottoming out here just seems way too obvious, you know?

To me it's like "really? If I buy here I'm basically guaranteed 300-500% returns? Just seems insane. too easy
> If you truly believe Bitcoin is going to 3k, then you shorted at 10k+.

Yeah, so check out this chart I posted on the 8th:

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/NW1Q8ZS5-After-30-days-in-the-rising-channel-it-s-time-to-take-profit/

I got the sell signal on the 24th, but ignored it till the 6th. By the 8th I offloaded 75% of my assets, and then at the next bounce, I offloaded the remainder.

I have no cryptos currently.

No claim at fortune telling, but I put my money where my mouth is.

----

Here is the current chart, to show how well its stacking up:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/227spHum/

I put a bounce in that location to match the 6th of the month theory. No idea if it will hold.
I am taking this formation as my highest probability at the moment.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/zl6e6TE7/ - Which is a perfect example of [a zigzag-triangle combination](https://ewtaf.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Zigzag-triangle-family-1-300x196.png), one of the only cases where a triangle will result in a reversal. Remeber in triangles the action is *always* corrective (read:choppy) so this kind of price action we see is to be expected.

[This would be the bearish case](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ctnnHaVH/) I can currently make, **but until we break 6900** there is little point in even considering it.

[This is also this a very outsider scenario](https://www.tradingview.com/x/R9WjWL8v/) which was a very bullish one but the current deep retrace makes the channel pretty much impossible to meet expectations.
Sellers run out of funds?

We had 3 years worth of buying since our last bear market. Plenty of people willing to sell lower than our current price, they just don't know it yet.
the problem is that Bitcoin made so many people so rich, that there'll be selling pressure for a while

all those whales that are suddenly worth 20-30 mil each and are busy buying houses, boats and lambos will continue selling to pay for their car insurance payments and the like...they are basically addicted to the lifestyle at this point, so regardless of how low the price of BTC gets, these people will still be forced to sell

Remember, many people who forgot about BTC before its run up, have about 10,000 BTC in their wallets to dump on the market with.
I'm in, but I didn't post top level. I've been traveling since Wednesday night. I was out of position after my stop, and I was planning to just look at it this weekend, but I saw chew go 2x short so I figured it was worth a look. I went 1x short at 7540 yesterday evening and put adds in up to 2.5x short up to 7595 (all on Jun futs). I'm 2.5x short around 7560. Stops right now are over our wedge, but unless we blast back up into it (very little room), I might just move them above that channel. 
? In the short term volume significantly increased here, which is what you want for a breakout.
these dummies might finally push past $7600 lol. $7700+ and im out probably
Might not be that deliberately ill-intentioned... I feel like some big players see 7k as another local bottom and are not shy about buying up anything around this price area...
Oh I wouldn't know, I'm a swinger :) For me anything under 1 hour is noise. And I only go to that level to tune my entry..
my bad I didn't understand your first comment.
Ok, thanks.
Yeah, I just don't like to be underwater 3 times on one position :-P

I don't expect 7k to hold next time we test it. We go higher low, lower high, last one was higher low in a triangle, we should at least close to lower high to have faith in bottom holding next time we approach it.
How old are you?
We're on teams now? I thought this was trading, a zero sum game where you ride the market, up or down.
You jinxed it
Covert shill.
Fortunately I set my adds and stops before bed. Had adds up to 7595 I actually generally do better when I'm not watching it lol

I'm still only effectively 2.5x short, though. 
Ahhh, now I get it.

Yeah, no clue how anyone couldnt see that as breaking down. Or at the very elast simply setting stops on a short at 7650+
Oh, don't be mad, wasn't attacking you here, actually agreeing, ascending support is a bitch to short on a break out. That's why I stated that it's better r/r to catch the top of the wedge.
Are you saying this? 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/3nW8vcGD/

That's a Squint-A-Lot iH&S^^^tm if I ever saw one. 
That didn't answer my question. If ETH/BTC aren't constant (I know they aren't), and they fluctuate (they do), then how can you say that one leads the other? 

Of course you can find anecdotes, but where's the evidence that there is more than a temporary and casual relationship?

Also, BTC hasn't change more than 5% in value over the last 3 days. Today's candle is only 3% wide. How can you say there's a significant change when the current market is characterized best by its relative stability?
Coal dusted brows, lunch pails in tote walking back home from the bar with a BAL of 1.4 already having cashed that payday loan which they funnel, rabidly into the local BTC ATM. Likely all happening in West Virginia. 
I think it's just trolling, nobody can be that daft.
It was Thursday 12th April at around 12pm GMT. I remember because it was about an hour before my mates funeral started. 
Ahh gotcha. 

I stopped paying attention to him after *College Dropout*.
Right, but this is more a discussion point under the guise of Cronyism rather than a direct invalidation of any price prediction related to BTC.

Nonetheless, as I said in my comment below, I don't put too much emphasis on their prediction, only that they're pretty bearish on BTC overall but they even stated that was an interesting price-point for BTC investing. 

Side-note: Much of the financial collapse in 2008 was due to systemic high-risk mortgage issuance in the housing market, but also fundamental flaws in risk management and basing hedging strategies on a stable financial system.

edit: grammar.
Yeah, that's not exactly how I meant it - not placing blind confidence in their analysis. 

Nonetheless I think 5k and anything below the interest will be substantial, and even more institutional/big-boy retail money will be interested in taking a larger position as the r/r is really good on a longer timeframe. Moreover, large players that already have a position will definitely want to pounce on the opportunity to accumulate more, enhancing the scarcity of BTC in the market. 

This is assuming fundamentals don't drastically shift when we reach that point, and my perspective could prove to be completely wrong. Though I'm willing to bet the farm at that point.  
Probably DCA/laddered buys then:  

20% laddered under $7K  
30% laddered under $6K  
40% laddered under $5K  
10% 10x short from $7500 (or held in reserve if you're not trying to trade and just looking to build a long term position)
Many folks here may have me pegged as super bearish, but holding BTC with a CA under $7K and ETH under $400 is likely to end very well for you.

I'm trading to build my long-term stack, but when I saw sub $400 ETH in April I definitely was crying over lack of buying power. 
Ballsy, 1 tap with no volume wasn't enough to get me in.
Thanks for drawing that. I'm seeing the same thing.  What it looks like to me is that we should start to go up dramatically in July sometime.  Until then it may chop around a bit.
it was just an order on the sell side for 150 coins @ $7599(give or take?) (BFX)- appeared right as price approached $7600. did not get filled, disappeared when price dipped back below $7590.
That would kill all the fun.
yea I mean if $3k happens it's not happening any time soon, it'd be like another 6-12 months of bouncing around and shit. even if BTC never moons again I don't know if we'll even see $3k within the next few years barring something drastic. who knows.

it's not *that* crazy though. we were just there last year! what, 9 months ago?
SGB = Small green brain
You haven’t been rude here, but to be fair, other responses calling bulls desperate for how they choose to label a rise and telling OP to “get off the 5-minute chart” probably would be considered a bit rude, no? 


[deleted]
Yeah I edited my post to include that. It's so far gone it's certainly already played out with the first rise up to 7.6k. Once we fell back to 7.3k  it was done, that ship has sailed.
Honestly have no clue what's gonna happen anymore.

My suggestion to you is don't feel like you need to "contribute" at all. Although that's very noble of you, it's likely you won't make much of a difference and should save your money for potentially better entries. 

Good luck in your future trades mate. and don't just short cause everyone else seems to be. We could all get BGD'd again like in April :P
4 months of 5800>11700>6400>9990>7000 is "tight sideways" ?

edit: sorry, misread -- "tightening sideways" fits that profile a little bit better, but that's a pretty broad range of "sideways"
Actually, this is the exact opposite of panic buying. I do something similar on a couple of shitcoins with crappy volume where I pretend to be a whale -- whenever the price is dropping, put buy orders near potential support levels to soften the drop and load up the bags, then as the price goes up ease off buying and just keep a few smaller buy orders near resistances to add to my positions and see if other market participants are ready to take it further. If resistance holds, let it fall back - very gently, just a little bit, and keep building my position, then bring it back to the resistance, again and again until there is enough confidence in the market to go higher -- or until there is a bigger breakdown, in which case I'd let it drop some more before buying heavily at another support level to stop the fall and lower the average entry price. 
i think its true how people never want bad things to happen, so they always underestimate the chance of it and put their _faith_ into it not turning out that way. good for us that dont care so much about the price, bad for the people who can't see the warning signs.       
that said i do see a decent move up within a week or two, but dont know if it will be from 5k or from around this level(Doubt it).
Bot traders playing the wedge, human traders buying because of higher low.

Look at this sub, a lot of people buy because of ascending triangle.
Think about it. We're bouncing off ~7.5-7.7. Put all the TA aside. We dropped to 7k, then to 7.2, 7.3, 7.4... When would you buy? On the next drop... But higher than last drop...

If you get big volume you pay small or no fees. Traders are scalping this until the end. Even if they'll be wrong on the last move they're already in good profit.
Accumulation my dude 
Why would you short the swaps if you are looking for a longer term leveraged position?
You can hold a futures position until the expiration date, usually about 3-6 months out. It's subject to fluctuations in price not attached to spot though
Fee rate is recalculated, there are times when you get paid for being long.
huh? are you talking about funding? sometimes longs pay shorts and sometimes shorts pay longs.

If youre talking about premium then its only $100 for sep 28 expiry 
Everyone wants it to go up, but no one wants to use their capital to make it happen. 
Breaking that point likely would have. 

But bouncing off of it for a 3rd time should have been far more disastrous than it has been so far.
It probably would have if we made it over. At the very least there were a bunch of short stops ready to trigger. Alas...
they are a forked country
Yea, maybe 3-10 participants at the beginning of the week.

But now, we're down to that one asshole who can't handle it. You won't see it down here (below/near the trend line), because he knows the BTC will get chewed up and he can't fuck anyone over.

My 2 cents ...
Sure, like 1 million dollar BTC. Can't be ruled out. It can even go to 0, theoretically. 
I thought all the ETH tards loved their ERC20 garbage 
i think a big eth crash has the potential to hurt btc.  It seems that BTC is a flight to safety for crashing alts, but that algorithmic funds spread the pain back into BTC neutralizing it, and BTC then goes negative (but still outperforms).  That's why I say the safest move is to go back into fiat during uncertainty.





Got me with that meme right here.
It's amazing to me that a project like EOS can amass hundreds of millions in $. Lol
Hm so according to this the volatility has gone down recently. Certainly doesn't feel like it.
And?
Chill lovely traders there is no reason to downvote this. I mean if that is what the gentleman right here really thinks and wants to do, let him do it! You should not disrespect someone's else's perspective. Let him buy even if goes to hell later..
This may help:

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/triplebottom.asp

It’s interesting that you think that. The overwhelming majority of people I know who hold have never attempted to trade. Just my own experience. 
I usually try to reflect on my own past performances and experiences rather than that of *others,* to be more efficient with my future trades. Why would you care about the 95%? lol.
Sure, whatever. Get fucked.
Yeah agreed man, it's just simply buying the correction and selling the ATH, easy, don't know why others aren't doing it.
I'm not salty at all. Lets just say, I tried to warn you...
Wait. You expect the price to stabilise at 150k? Ok because nobody will sell right? :) 
Hint: If that happens it will make some BRD's that will shake your inner world.
bitcoin can be $300 and succeed...the reason you want the price to go up is so you get rich, don't lie to yourself.

Really, you don't need the price to be exorbitant for adoption.

If anything bears and shorters are stabilizing the price over the past few months. Isn't that what you need for it to be adopted? 
You realize HODLers/long term investors buy corrections, right?
"but muh triple bottom"
Yes, because all of us can only think and trade in terms of the next Bart.

The market is weak...We are in a bear market...that is why many traders in here are short to medium term bearish.
The weekly chart doesn't look good.
id argue you'd be at less risk with buy stop at 7601. even better less risky trade would be short at your point with stop at 7601, but i guess thats easy to say now
You might be very right about your call that we break up at this point. But putting a long from here, instead of waiting for 7.600 to break, is just straight nonsense. ( i don't even want to talk about a stop buy at 7599.9...??????). 
What he's saying is that the weekly triangle wedge has made a pattern that resembles a starfish's buttocks, this is both a bullish and wolfish formation, which means the next doji must have 2 stars or we will have to reset the board and try again next year.
my point was that was the very bottom. Most people with shorts open will have had a significant better entry price, many are in profitable shorts from the 9000 or 8000s
I mean, imagine someone here just constantly telling people to sell/close their longs. It'd be (and is) obnoxious as fuck

personally I'm torn between finding it entertaining and annoying. I want him to keep doing it solely so I can see what he does/says if we dump lol. will be more entertaining than any tv show/movie I have watched in a while
Because the only thing he ever posts is how BTC is going to moon and shorters are terrible people who are about to get rekted. 
it is. But indecisive/amateur traders (helicoptered millennials?) have no clue what to do when in comes to critical thinking or confronted with something that contradicts their view.

Well, ok. Not so sure about it but can't argue here.
Tbf I totally think it's a wedge too. Just saying that people will claim it was a triangle for sure if it goes up.

Added: always do your own research; so much fake news in this market sphere
I hope you are right! Your scenario would be ideal IMO, and more exciting. I was just pointing out the dull side of the coin. There's a very real possibility we could be headed sideways untill late summer. 
Too be completely honest no one really knows, it's all conjecture based on charts and previous trends. I personally believe we hit it @7k, then again I could be wrong also.
On my chart last drop to 7050 touched the support so it's higher now.
You'll be interested in this chart. About to make a post.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/IuszUcVl/
Oh, I agree 100%. My chart illustrates that point. I hadn't thought about that. I was thinking about that while I was looking at it just now and didn't realize that you were the person to plant the seed of a thought. Great observation.

Yes! The rate of change shouldn't match up day over day. Instead, we should look at indicators to signal and eventually confirm market position. My chart is meant to illustrate a possible market bottom that is historically rare. Matching up those market bottoms and stretching data to match the peaks and valleys is more illustrative.


> historically rare [...] stable market bottoms.

There isn't a 2 month period of price stability before 2012 unless you're looking at sub $1 prices... and I wouldn't characterize that period as stable.
Could be.  I for one believe news will help accelerate what was already in the cards.  Before big dips, you'll see good news doesn't result in hardly any upward price movement but the smallest set of bad news will tank the price 5% in an hour.  IMO, had the same scenario played out with 0 news at all, the price would've bled downward anyway (just a gut feel).

Also, I'm a firm believer in market cycle and market pressure being more important than a headline.  But I do admit that there are compelling arguments on your side of the fence, pointing at news being the CAUSE of the sell events.
I actually haven't considered this bear market being potentially a mix of the 13/14 bear markets... I really like that analysis.  I might steal it.  It's mine now.
Bruh Idk what you mean, America is now great again.  Get with it.

who knows...

Nothing would surprise me
I think the best the bears can hope for in the long run is MAYBE sub 6k again.

But I’d wager that won’t be happening in 2018.

More likely we just bump around between 6k+ and sub 10k all year than going all the way down in a rapid move.

But hey... it’s just reverse hopium.

I think ALOT of people are salty because they knew about the corn back in the day, maybe had some from 2013 and sold at 600 or some shit.

Sure, I’d be calling for 3800 too if it meant I could load up one lst time... even though 3800 is insanely high for my sub 1k ingrained bullishness. I doubt it goes that low
Im not saying this time is different, I’m saying that anticipating this correction to be on par with the worst we’ve ever seen since 2010 is a bit of a stretch.

Its already more than a small correction, its a full on bear market. Why does it have to be the most significant bear market we’ve ever seen?

3800 is 80%+ off ATH. BTC went up 100x in 2013 and then dropped 80%+ in 2014.

This time BTC “only” went up 20x and we’re already 65% off AtH

EDIt: I say this a lot: I’m not saying it won’t happen. I’m saying its foolish to expect it will. If it happrns... great... load up. But dont add to your short at 4k or 5k or 5500 because you think 3800 will happen. Just seems reckless
Thanks mate, and when you say keep an eye on eth, do you mean eth/usd or eth/btc, I haven't quite wrapped my head around the ratio so I haven't been using it as an indicator much.
Yessir, currently around 8960 give or take. 
Yeah I had a few chances to close for a small profit, but I do think eventually it's going to break down. This little pumps that fizzle out have not given me confidence to long, specially since I missed out on the good R/R of low 7K.
[https://www.tradingview.com/x/Yluxwv6X/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Yluxwv6X/)
....no? just patently false. We were at $6-7k for like 15 days...been here for like 8
BGD time :) 
Ketchup on pizza? I feel sad for you that you have to put ketchup on the pizza you eat.
Sure.  If i can enter in the 73XX range then the R/R of closing at the top of the channel around 76XX - 77XX is 1:2.  But I want to get a (partial) good entry incase this is more than that or the squeeze plays out.  Which I think *could* give us momentum for a week of upside.  TBH it's a small gamble, only 20% position.
the wedge is so perfect it looks like someone drew it 
I see, so you didn't like how it only touched $7600 once? What if we said horizontal resistance in actually $7550, would that make a difference?  
Also, I might be struggling to understand the difference between a wedge and a triangle. Found [this](http://stockcharts.com/articles/decisionpoint/2015/04/whats-the-difference-between-an-ascending-wedge-and-an-ascending-triangle.html)- seems to point towards this being an ascending triangle (horizontal or slightly descending resistance line). What do you think?
yea I mean it's  much more of an ascending wedge imo

https://www.tradingview.com/x/QabI6dze/
Interesting. That makes a lot of sense. I probably should have thought of that. First lesson learned.  
  
Maybe the focus is slightly different. This way, I don’t worry about hitting the high or low, or if it goes up or down next. Doesn’t matter. I worry, instead, about hitting the dead middle of a fixed range, and assume that it will eventually go both up and down from this point, with my 2% “stop-gain” on either side.  
  
This is probably a bad idea the more i think about it.

It's all right was just curious! Thanks for the reply! 
I get it if you don't care about erc20 token movement but I think you cannot rule out eth fron the equation atmbat least.. 
Thanks for the lengthly write up mate.  I appreciate it.  Going to do a bit of digging! Keep posting them charts
Less stressful long entries:

1) If we go down to 7100ish and set a higher low on the higher time frames. We will likely have a green week after that. Look to long from down there.

2) If this is accumulation and we go down to 6900 for the "Spring". Put some orders in down there and gamble on the triangle holding with tight stops. Or wait for it to spring back up and long from 7200ish.

3) Long once we clear 7650.

Longing in our current range is dog turd
Holding underwater positions for extended periods of time is really not my thing.

It's certainly fair to say that I may have exited too early, but my general sentiment about this trade is that I entered too early to begin with in the first place.
Yeah, I need to make myself more clear more often...

I was thinking about the moment they will break in either way ;)
If you were to take a guess, where would you see the price after things stabilize well enough?
No can do. That simply wouldn’t be... fair

ba dum dts
yes I do

you can fake buy walls. You can't fake lack of interest. the reason I went long at $7,080 was because we had tons of buyers at $7,000.

here is a comment I made when I went long: https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8mnaib/daily_discussion_monday_may_28_2018/dzqaxof/

> So I know order books are worthless, still its interesting to see # of buyers/sellers

>on bfx at 7000, there is 1332 buyers and another 886 at 6900

>but on the sell side, you just have 170-200 sellers per each $100 range.

>now this being bitcoin, if its going to bounce, it'll be doing so right before all those buyers can get their orders filled...so $7,000 is going to be a very interesting range to look at

>not saying it will bounce, but I'm thinking $7,000 def won't go down without a fight

and that was just 3 days ago. Since then we had a "MASSIVE!" pump of 7% and now the price is going back down again. In my book, thats a textbook dead cat bounce after crashing down from $8,500. 

Now look at the order books, we went from having 1332 buyers at $7,000 and 886 buyers at $6,900 to 594 buyers at $7,000 and 447 buyers at $6,900. And do you think people will put up as big of a fight at $7,000 when the discount is only 7% compared to putting up a fight at $7,000 when the discount was 17%
You've gotta be kidding, man. 3K to 3600 to 4250? Those are your three higher lows? those at 20% apart each and occurred within 3 weeks. There is absolutely zero correlation or pattern between that span and now. Famous "three higher lows" patterns?

Where do you guys dig this stuff up?
that would be $6k, $7100, and $8350 over the course of 21 days.

We have done $6k, $6.5k, and now $7050 (not to mention we're a measly 5% above that right now) over the course of 115 days 

also the highs in between each low in September were like...3% higher. the highs between each low here are like 50-100% 

you're actually comparing this

https://www.tradingview.com/x/T3qRFMuK/

to this?

https://www.tradingview.com/x/U0CeQshK/
Yes, seems way too obvious, but someone will have to sell to get it to sub 6k

I think sub 6k is possible, maybe even likely. But it will take some determined fucking sellers to get us there.

Time will tell
dont get all wobbly on me now sloppy.  Also, i have a day job and life is hard enough.  why do you think it can't be easy?  if you turn bullish i might go all in.
[deleted]
> When people said $7.5k was crazy back when we were at $10k and hadn't even dropped below $9k yet, we dropped to $5.9k.

A lot of people called this bottom perfectly, including when the price was still above 10K. I remember Tone Vays called it perfectly. Most people here think he's retarded though.
I respect this trade and I respect you for sticking to it. I didnt have the balls to short... got burned on the way up and decided a cool off was in order
> Plenty of people willing to sell lower than our current price, they just don't know it yet.

This is essentially how I see it. Lots of people have not had their hands tested and in terms of how many people are in massive profits- there's a lot of supply to go around. 
Plus with this bear market, they don't know when it will end. If they don't keep selling now, their coins could be worth half this in a year, and it could be 2 years or longer to recover. That's a long time to wait, especially if they consider they could move their crypto money into an asset that doesn't have high odds that it may drop an additional 50%.
That’s a great entry. I jumped in too fast when the wedge was barely forming having zero hopes for this to break upwards. So I was underwater for a couple of days. 
Volume is dropping on 4h, this is text book ascending wedge.

I don't like the 'text book' part. It's like sloppy pointed out. This wedge is so perfect that it looks like somebody draw it.
Bears are getting angry , good 
buyers dont know when to fucking buy. Where were they when we were at 9900?
You're right.. Eerily similar to the lead up to the $1000 BGD
I hear you. I use the 15min for tuning scalp entries.  15 min higher low followed by higher high, then layer in on the next pull back.

Its usually the first sign of a turn around. That way you're in position before the hourly higher high, almost essential for good r/r on a scalp.
He's either 15 or 50 lol 
I wish you can mute certain people like StockTwits 
These daily discussions are just yelling matches and bears jerking each other off.
:-(

At least it's gonna look more like a flag now ;-)

But really, if this gonna get back above 7.5...
You follow Tone Vays, I think that says enough.
Lol, so basically you reopened your last short but a bit higher?

Told you that was bad place to add ;)
Because they saw an ascending triangle...
I had my stops on Jun at 7652 and adds up to 7595 overnight. Got pretty damn close to my stops but hit all my adds.
i agree 
yes
You must be new. /S
I can't do your homework for you.  Pick some times in the last days where you see btc make a big move and you will not only see eth move (expected) but the btc/eth moves too.  btc drops, eth drops harder, etc.

What was interesting in this case was that they were significantly decoupled (for a while, btc dropped as I anticipated).
I love these bulls, they crack me up. The Church of Scientology called and they want their cultists back. They have the stones to call the bears "relentless." 
I was tempted to sell after not breaking through 10k, but I figured it’d be best not to try and time the market. I’m a long term holder because I still have PTSD from trading this market in 2013/14. I just like holding crypto, and I’ll take the profits when the %’s get silly enough. No swing trading for me. 
Bearish.
based on the bounce at 3k, I would say its out of the cards tbh.
Sorry if I've been too present in the sub. I will chill on commenting so much lately. Sincere apologies if any of my comments have discouraged you (or anyone else) from posting/writing comments here. 
[deleted]
> that ship has sailed

I've read that the bull div is still relevant. As I said, I'm not a wizard, but I had to go outside of sub to read such views.

And again: I'm bearish. 
Haha mate when I read about no follow through, I am like, lets do this. Now I am slowly realizing it is probably a stew ped move and I shouldn't be doing it anymore. huh. I am totally buying your suggestion.

Yeah mate not just short, perhaps it would look more like a mix of shorts and long, depending how the price moves. All this time I've been trying to save my long because of the reason that I am anticipating another BGC like last time or at least good upwards movement. I missed that BGC at the last moment when I shorted it on its final dip before the BGC. Rest is history, shit mate. 

I too don't have a clue anymore.. :(
Put on the 1D and zoom out, it is a broad range but it is also tightning.

In spite of all the FUD and the seemingly increasing number of resolute & loud bears online, price has yet to manage to make a lower low than that on the 6th of Feb. The pattern of each period of downward movement being preceeded by stronger upward movement remains unbroken even in this "bear market" of 2018.
That's fair. The way these dips are being bought up just seems panicked to me. At least compared to the buying pressure at the top. Price goes down$50 and it's instantly bought up. Price goes up to local high and suddenly everyone stops buying lol 

don't understand it 
i dont even know, i dont get why anyone would buy here. doesn't really make sense to me considering price gets smacked down quite literally every single time. think that's about 10 rejections from $7600+ now
I didn't meant long term LONG only. I meant a position (whether long or short) for a longer period of time, ideally over a month. Apologies if it was confusing 
This has been my personification of buyers for awhile now, and it's not likely to end well for them if the behavior continues. 

The Finex long vs short ratio has been holding at about 3:2 pretty much since just after the Big Green Candle. 

Buyers keep stepping in the way of downward continuation, but are also stepping out of the way at points of possible upward reversals. 

The lower the market pushes, the heavier the bags become and the fewer buyers will be around to create buying pressure. 

It's funny to me to see so many people on here who are super bullish at this juncture and can't wait for "all the delusional shorts to be squeezed."

Well, the reality is this:

1. There aren't really a lot of shorts to squeeze to begin with
2. Shorts opened in the past month are a hell of a lot more comfortable than longs opened in the past month
3. Even if there is a reversal, a "short squeeze" isn't likely to take place until somewhere back in the $9,000 range.


This market movement is really frustrating. I'm getting bored with this. May close my short from 7560 and just watch. It's super annoying. 
> because he knows the BTC will get chewed up and he can't fuck anyone over.

"He" is learning a hard and expensive lesson that he who gets the most BTC wins.  He who sells his BTC cries at some point.
This sounds like nonsense. In case the price goes way down remember to ask the question "is my long terrible?" at some point before the bottom instead of right at the bottom.
bit of a stupid point you've made there because 2k is only 73% away from current price and 1 million BTC is a 14,000% increase. 

We are in a bear market, 2k is perfectly reasonable as a price. Do I think it'll go there? nope. Do I think 6k will break? Yep. 

Is it possible that we get into the 4k region and bottom out there, of course. So 2k from that range is hardly a big stretch is it genius. 
I went on there for the first time ever today and its literally just Ethereum fan boys bashing Bitcoin and EOS
get it right billions not millions
Have you read it? It describes, in detail, everything btc has done since xmas.
I was a holder until I sold 'er...


Ask them why...

There are holders that bought and didn't trade cause they know they don't have a clue about it and don't make a big deal from it, there are holders who tried, sucked, stopped but don't try to hide that and there are the ones that come here and scream 'shorters gonna get rekt' cause they sucked at trading and can't stand that people can make money out of it. If you look at this sub the majority of holders is the third group.
If I'd count success ratio on my long/short I'd say it's close to 50/50.

Honest question. Why do people like you just can't imagine that their investment may fail? I'm not saying it will, but you don't even consider the possibility.
Damn
I’m not sure if it would stabilize at 150k. It might have to go much higher. 
Bitcoin could be 1 million dollars and still succeed.. the reason you want the price to go down is so you can short and get rich, don't lie to yourself. 

Really, you don't need the price to be low for adoption 

Notice how this works both ways...

As you said, price of bitcoin does not matter in regards to adoption, but volatility sure doesn’t help it. I do agree with your sentiments that shorters do allow for short/midterm term price realization. 
If price was $300 that would mean hardly anyone was using it right?   If millions of people were using it price would be above 100k. And we long term hodlers would all be rich. What’s wrong with that outcome?
Another thing that annoys me about shorters is they BORROW money to short.  It’s not even their own money.  It’s kinda betting against bitcoin. Betting against the vast majority of bitcoin hodlers. Not really a team player attitude.    

I prefer a “we’re all in this together” mindset. Let’s buy, hodl, together and watch the price soar.   Can you bears/shorters please try to see where we bulls/hodlers are coming from on this?   ✌️
This.
When it looked good it still crashed
Ouch bro, it was risky indeed. I need to be more disciplined with my positions moving forward. haha.
If we go down, I lose about .2% to .5%. If we go up, 1% to 5% profit is on the table.
Upbart for wolfish formation, I've been howling about this for weeks now
can u please explain that to me again I tried googling [starfish buttocks pattern](https://www.google.com/search?ei=4ZIRW-GzMIHrvASYjYCQAw&q=starfish%27s+buttocks+pattern&oq=starfish%27s+buttocks+patter&gs_l=psy-ab.1.0.33i21k1l2.18885.23495.0.24132.10.9.1.0.0.0.256.1213.0j7j1.8.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..1.7.1061...33i160k1.0.7ybChu_x2_4) :D

Yep, for sure.

You talking about yourself right? This dropping here contradicts your view. You can't stand that.
Are you angry about your long-term, savvy investment not growing in value because nobody's buying a cumbersome, almost useless piece of code designed to make a cartel and early adopters rich based on hype alone? Show me on the doll where bitcoin touched you.
ahh makes sense, thanks. 
I knew what you meant, that's why I said it needs imagination :P
People will claim whatever when it goes their way. That's why I don't follow 'people', I follow individuals here who actually know what they're talking about.
> Tbf I totally think it's a wedge too.

lol

just because someone uses it wrong doesn't mean it's useless.  I mean I agree that most of TA is dumb as hell but that's because the majority of people use it incorrectly or overcomplicate it. 

an ascending wedge *in theory* doesn't provide even a strong success rate, it's just a guide to know what you should be looking for and what's more likely
You can't make this up.  It's looking more and more likely that those shorts are EOS. 

Thanks
Gotcha. That was still about 2% above the support on mine...which isn't necessarily unexpected with a long term TL like that. Could very well have been the retest
>I for one believe news will help accelerate what was already in the cards.

Yes, that definitely happens too. Again, it's impossible to determine the true cause of the first sell-events because the market and their participants are so complex. But coming back to your original question - I think that without MtGox and the China ban the bear market would not have been so dramatic and the price would have recovered much faster.
thanks, gonna check it out!
I’m not a huge fan of this country. Huge fan of the people though. Such a great nation. Such weird laws and things considered “normal” sometimes.
Look seeing the monthly in log scale I see a sideways correction basically, which is very bullish. But this run started at 150 EUR and look where we are. At least that's where I count the start. It may take a lot of time before we enter another cycle. And a lot of pain. The market is going to shake out stronger hands that are still deep in the green. This is slow.

PS I would not short bitcoin right now even with a gun on my head mate, shorting time is over. Now I play the bounces. I like it fast.
80% declines are fairly normal for breaking parabolic trends, this current parabola started at around $315 imo, so about a 60x move. In 2013, there were two parabolas the first started around $7 and went up to $265, a 38x move. It dropped to $50, so about an 80% decline. It then consolidated under $150 mtgox ($130 on stamp) where the next parabola started when that level broke. This is when mtgox was faking orders like crazy and it ran up to $1200, only an 8x move (but manipulated), it then dropped to 150, so again an 80% decline from the top but a nearly 100% retrace of the entire manipulated parabola. 

I'd say the fall from 20k to 6k (70%) is about the minimum correction to be expected. *If* this large symmetrical triangle breaks down, my plan is to short with hopes to cover around 5k and get dream longs in the mid 4ks (where i see the next likely support and coincidentally what would be an 80% decline of the move from 315 to 19900), and then reshort the bounce and basically just play the new range until a direction is chosen.
ETH/USD.  My gut tells me BTC would have already gone down if ETH wasn't still messing around at the top of it's range.
Yeah you're right, no follow through! Hopefully a higher low will fix that.

Sounds like we make similar mistakes. Missed the good r/r long as well.  Too greedy trying to hold my short till 69XX. Missed the pump and some short profit.


Overall during the past 3 months. Which range we've been the longest?
Yeah, I see your point. I just really hope that market will finally decide if it wants to go up or down.
Ascending triangle is bullish, ascending wedge is bearish.

If we set 7550 then we've tried to violate resistance and got dragged back down every time, that's bearish.

It's really an ascending wedge. But that doesn't mean it can't break up.
So you think it ought to be drawn more like [this](https://i.imgur.com/gfZh8mn.png)?
Yes, this is what I'm seeing.  Looks pretty classic as a rising wedge continuation pattern heading down.  I don't wish it to be, but I'm prepared for it.
Haha no worries, I literally made the same argument with someone once and they told me I was wrong and I didn't understand how at first. It really makes sense at first until you realize that one position is losing you money, when you close out the one that made you money, you just make back the money you lost in the first place (as long as it turns around). It's effectively the same thing as waiting.

It's not a *terrible* idea, you just have to hope that the price goes your way after it hits the bottom/top of your defined range.

You're banking on getting the bottom/top right. Which makes sense in chop/ranging sideways.

But yea, the main benefit is maker fees + not having to try to open a position on bitmex while shit's going crazy. 

Aside from that, you might as well not have taken a position at all. You're essentially flat
Yes that sounds to be one of the best case scenarios I should be following. Thanks mate.
> I entered too early to begin with in the first place.

That’s almost Yogi Berra-esque 
Where we are now +/- 10%

You've never traded anything else, have you? This is not the same market you were looking at 4 months, 4 days, or 4 hours ago.
In my opinion we have plenty of time to break 6k, assuming interest and volume stays away for the next while which I'm pretty confident it will. 
Haha because making big money is never easy. You have to be incredibly lucky or incredibly patient. 

I'm not getting wobbly, still in my short, I just think it could be a bit more confusing. 
That's actually super interesting. It shows us how $5-6k will largely be thin air and if we drop through and spend any decent amount of time underneath it it will act as huge resistance for a while. 
Yes, and a lot of people will have called $3-5k perfectly if it happens. But the majority of people believe it's not in the cards, you know what I mean?
I’ve met him... he deffinitiely sounds retarded when he talks
I have really been trying to avoid leveraged trades as it can lose money pretty quick. Direct buying of cryptos at worse means bag holding till you're out of the red... (exit scams and hacks not withstanding). But watching people making the big bucks on the way down has me wanting to join in. Without it, all I can do is get out of my position and buy back in later. Runs the risk of missing out, but we all know this sucker bounces around several times a year =)
That makes sense, but how do you know there are still so many people in massive profits? How do you quantify this? 
There's a part of me that fully expects a slow bleed to 7460 and then a pop back to 7600. I'm tempted to just close my short right now and take a breakdown of 7300. This shit is annoying. 
Yeah but he was obviously talking about the 15 min chart in which volume increased.
eh this is just boring
BGD right about now would be nice...
Right, I get it. Never tried to scalp.. Too many chances to get it wrong the way I see it. Swinger forever!
You noticed that too, huh?
There's a small part of me that wants to close here for net profit on my last two trades and just wait until we break one way or the other. 
What does *that* say about your *shilling*?
Ugh, yeah. I've been busy and not watching it, but when chewy doubled down, I took another look. Re-opened 7545 (20% @ 5x) and then set 15% adds at 7565 and 7595 last night when I saw the wedge holding up. 

Our downward channel was approaching as well, so I felt more confident than when it was up at 7900.

Well, BTC has done stranger things. I'll give you that. 
Not really, but thanks. 
You are the one making a claim that ETH leads BTC, I'm simply asking you to provide evidence of that claim. You have the **[burden of proof](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/222/Shifting-of-the-Burden-of-Proof)**. Alternatively, you can concede that there is no evidence and retract the claim.
Man, it was either earlier today or yesterday one of these new bulltrolls actually posted "bitcoin only goes up". 
It's all good, man.  I apologize as well for saying what I did.  I was being defensive and I was caught off\-guard with your original reply \(which I appreciate you deleting\) about being too sensitive.  You comment a lot for sure, but I have never thought of you as being rude, so I apologize for reacting the way I did. I guess you were right about the "too sensitive" comment! :P  Perhaps you should've left it up!  You add a lot of good insight and bring a lot of value to this sub \- I think it would be a shame if you stopped.  That's not what discourages me from posting.  Sorry if my point got lost because I sunk in the mud with the other assholes who call people names.

Edit: I'm deleting my previous comment now \- it was an unfair thing to say. My apologies.
I like your posts and I'd not worry so much about singular comments. If you hear this from many, then that is different. 
Just ignore it, you don't need to defend yourself here. 
I know you're bearish; that shouldn't have any impact on TA though. The ideal of TA is that it helps provide an objective look at the market and removes bias.

Read baby pip's 9 rules for trading divergence and see if you can pick out which rule trading on it now violates.

The reason you haven't seen it mentioned much is because it HAS already played out; I'd be very skeptical of any TA that still mentions it. That particular div was mentioned quite a lot here when it first came about (and was indeed upvoted).

I'd recommend learning enough about TA to at least judge the validity of other's charts before you let their charts to sway your view.
The reason you're not seeing many bullish posts is because nothing as of recent has been particularly bullish. Most bullish perspectives are on longer time frames: the higher low, the bounce on the triangle.

However, the bounce has been completely flaccid, so no one really has anything new that's bullish to say.

Most of the bearish posts are coming from the perspective of witnessing a complete lack of follow through on every single push.

The 4h div has already played out, a 4h div doesn't signal a massive reversal, it's anything from a small reversal to a small relief in selling/buying. 

The main reason to be bullish would be because we've failed to make a lower low and haven't pierced the bottom of the triangle- however, like I said, absolutely 0 follow through. 

So naturally people go with the most recent short-medium term trend, which is down. 
Oh I chart the 4H/1D routinely, and I already have that formation.

I personally think the run-up of 2017 was a blow-off top that still needs further correcting to the long-term uptrend support (pink): https://www.tradingview.com/x/8UcM4DRB/
People believe bottom was in at 7k? :P
Use futures. Swaps could be okay but if you're on the wrong side of funding you'll get fucked. Tbf I've been on swaps for about 50 days (short since $9650) and got paid really well in funding the first few weeks- after that it's been about net neutral
Completely 100% agree, I mean even looking at the position tracker here you see a lot of longs that were opened/still open in the 8-9k range as opposed to shorts which have either opened around 7.5k or are within the 8-9k range. Shorts have positioned themselves in a much less stressful place and can indure more pain than longs at this point.

I feel like this should be a sticky on the daily to be honest. This whole BGD meme is even more annoying than the lack of follow through from buyers.
Just keep it open with stops above $7,700 or so. 

Eventually the market will get even more bored than you are and pick a direction. 

If that direction is down, then it's going to be very ugly below $7,000. 

If that direction is up, then you should have plenty of opportunities to open a decent long after your short is stopped out.
its barely been a day. Give it time.
But it looks like the your wedgent support is being tested, so you may want to stick it out a bit.
There's almost no chance of the price going way down any time soon. Every attempted dump gets bought right up, and we're talking about a commodity whose supply is very limited.
It matters not the distance but the possibility to go there. Both are so remote that are close to negligible. What are your reasons for Bitcoin to go 2k? Charts? TA? Tea leaves?
You're missing this critical piece of information from the description:

>while bullish volume should increase as the price breaks through the final resistance.

Look at the example given on the investopedia page, there are three key lines to the formation: (1) the triple bottom, (2) the resistance trendline, and (3) the take profit line. We're not above the resistance trendline therefore it's not a valid triple bottom. Do you trade a head and shoulders pattern when only one shoulder has formed? 
Can you show us any truthful data showing day or swing traders actually do well?  The overwhelming majority of stock traders get rekt, hedge funds get destroyed by simple index funds, is there any reason to believe the more manipulated crypto market would be any different?  Alternatively there is no reason to believe blindly holding one asset is smart or advisable either, but it probably beats trading for almost everyone out there.  Stock market data would suggest to us that a diverse portfolio of crypto assets rebalanced regularly minimizes risks and maximizes gains.

Be careful what you believe on the internet, everyone is a great trader and also has a 13 inch penis, if you hear them tell it.
You’re saying that the majority of long term holders in this sub scream “shorters gonna get rekt?” I personally think the long term holders are  actually some of the quietest people here. 
It's not just about the charts. Every single piece of news lately has been bullish on Bitcoin.

Try to find one fundamental bearish article about Bitcoin.
Heheh... You know if it goes even to 50k, which is more realistic, the volatility will wipe out everyone. I'm talking monster dildos.
the difference is I have never said I want bitcoin to succeed or that I want the price to go down (or up) for any reason other than to make money
Millions of people owned ripple at 3$ and now at 60 cents.
Most people on the planet could own a couple of satoshis. Price doesn’t have to go up for that.
> Another thing that annoys me about shorters is they BORROW money to short.

Not really, a lot of them just short the value of their bitcoin. Also, you're very confused if you don't think people go long on margin. Haha. Just look at bitmex to see all the people borrowing money they don't own to go long.


A parabola never looks good.
If you start at 7601, then 0.6%-4.6% is still on the table without having the risk of not breaking the horizontal resistence line...

Edit: i am not questioning your trade at all. Actually i am starting to sweat in my short, haha. Just questioning your entry here.
Hardly, it's by design.
Actually, this is all part of my very successful strategy. It's by design and I'm comfy as ever.
Even masters of TA will say it only works about 60\-70&#37; of the time \(maybe less in BTC?\). The real money is made in managing your trades. 
> It's about burritos in Mission screw that guy. 

No truer words have been written.  La Cumbre - Mission District.  It will change your life.  Carne Asada Burrito and try the chicken corn tortilla taco.

Spam or not - see my user name.  I know what the fuck i am talking about.
It's about burritos in Mission screw that guy. SFO security is near tops, saying nothing of immigration or customs.

3800 is a reasonable target for this wave but I will be buying there assuming there is one last wave to be dumped afterwards.

fair point. Slow grind down will kill the bulls, but the corn will survive 
Ok, with the PS ninja edit, I totally agree with you 👌👍
At 4k I’m longing the fuck out of the Sept or Dec futures.

Like 25x all-in with my trading stack
I get what you mean, thanks.
Haha yeah, I think a lot of us were waiting for that leg down that shoot up. I guess this is my revenge short for missing that. 
$6.5-7k
I'm bearish. I reckon we'll be in the triangle for a few weeks more though. https://www.tradingview.com/x/vgXeXq6D/ 
I mean don't you? The first touch of resistance drops down and then test a lower high, then a higher low, then a higher high, then higher low, then higher high, etc. it just looks much more like a wedge to me
on bfx order book

the "count" is how many buyers/sellers there are in that range

amount is how many coins total they have to sell/buy


Sure I have. My bachelors is in finance with an emphasis in investment and I've traded to some degree or another for about 7 years. 
But sub 5k seems ridiculous at this point no?

If we go sub 6k, then sub 5k becomes likely. But until we get below 6800... Im not even thinking about sub 5k nor taking anyone seriously who is considering it. There will be plenty of time to prepare for sub 6k, let alone sub 5k. Any talk of 3800 or 1750 bottoms is just masturbation.

I still stick to the assumption that the big dogs already sold and bought back. Or will at least buy back soon...
I don't think the majority of people actually think that, I think bears are just quiet right now. I notice that most of the people supposedly taking longs in this range are not the most experienced traders I've seen on here and most of them don't have a great case for why they're buying instead of waiting or shorting. There are probably more reasons to be medium term bearish at this point than to be bullish. I just wonder what the sentiment is going to be like if/when it bounces off of $5K. Will people think *that's* the bottom? I probably won't. Once the weekly cloud turns bearish, it's all cylinders firing for bears and that could happen as early as Sunday if the price trickles down a little further before then. 
Not only that, but until we are clear of the bear market, "calling the bottom perfectly" is pretty funny since we still don't know where the bottom is.
You've met just about *everyone*, according to you.
agreed!

Good luck!👍 
lack of mean reversion and a parabola means there are tons of people who've never been underwater.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/zVO0jOcj/

there's the last parabola with vpvr overlayed, showing where the volume was. This was about September 2014 before they had made new lows below a 70% correction (essentially where we are right now). notice the complete lack of volume between $150-450

here is what it was after we hit the bottom:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/nr4Jq1Ax/

here is what our volume profile looks like now:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/oyKx8oue/

even if you look at it starting at $1k there's a lot of empty space in terms of volume:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/NI6plfQp/

I could totally be using this indicator wrong but I believe this is how you use it. 
Well at the current price it only takes about 133 BTC to be a millionaire. Is there a way to see how many addresses have say.. 250+ BTC in them? 

I don’t know how but I’m sure someone here does
I’m expecting serious chop, that’s why I’m keeping my sl around 7600 still. There’s a chance this just keeps dropping and I don’t want to lose my entry. 
Tomorrow too plz and day after that would also be cool.
I've been 2 times underwater on that short already. I just can't believe it may go up once again.
Edited in the /s
I'll give binary and chad a pass because they're usually fun about it and seem like hodlers who chuckle nervously at drops.

These new guys are full-on moonboys are seem to legitimately believe the drivel they spout. Downright scary. Just waiting for their entire world/paradigm to unravel if this daily pennant breaks down.
thanks, mate, I appreciate that. I would rather not have any bad blood with anyone here, especially with people who have good intentions like yourself. I like this sub a lot. :)

I really appreciate it, and I'm sorry I commented that at all in the first place. Immediately regretted it, hah. 

I won't stop (heh, idk if I could), but I will make sure I'm keeping my bias in check when trying to correct people or add info to discussions
Well it has like 10 upvotes calling me a know it all lol. I can see how I came off that way the past few days. Usually when this happens it means I've been overzealous/commenting too much lately. I have to keep myself in check sometimes so I will try to chill a bit.

Thanks though mate :)
people seem to think TA needs to include every single possibility like on TradingView.

"Well, we have the 100ma on the 13.7 minute timeframe acting as support for the 300ema resistance on the 1d bollinger bands, so if the RSI forms an ascending triangle on the wedge of the 47 second time frame, it's possible we will see a 0.37% pump at 7:40 PM tonight- however, there is a bear div on the 9 hour time frame combined with a touch of the ichimoku cloud on a holiday weekend in which bankers will dump on retail traders. However, we notice that bitcoin reverse on the 6th, since it has done so 5 times this year."

reading through the TA on TradingView, it's pretty clear that people don't think TA is legit unless it presents *every single* possibility, no matter if it's accurate or not. but that's precisely what makes most TA so useless
Thanks for that. 
Sure I can see it going further down to 4k or maybe even 3k, though it seems very unlikely at this point. Anyway as long as that first support line and this year's low remain unbreached I assume the bottom was indeed in Feb and try to build a position to play the long term trend.

Definitely not going short when the 1D chart spent 3 weeks below the mean and near the lower bband without breaking 7k or undoing the BGDs from the 6th of Feb or the 12th of April. Even if we're headed for goblin town a bull trap seems due first.
The problem with your pink line is that we have been well above it for a year. It's wishful thinking.
I would be very very shocked if a lot of the extremely underwater longs in the position tracker weren't closed ages ago. 

People either:

* forgot they opened a position with the tracker
* are too embarrassed to post their exit for a loss and are keeping it open in the tracker with the hope they can save face at some point in the future
I will. I'm only 2x short. I need to just set alarms and stop watching it. 
I thought your stops were above 7600?
I typically trade multi-day. I just recently held a short for over a week. The market is being schizophrenic though, which is annoying. 
I can't take you seriously. You're suggesting it's as likely to go to 2k as 1 million. Even though we are in a bear market and 2k is not exactly far away.

Also please listen, I didn't say it would go to 2k. I believe somewhere in 4s. 2k is still a reasonable chance though.

If you can't see that then there's no help for you 
I agree with you. For one successful trader there are 10 or even 100 who failed. Money for the winners don't go from thin air.

My comment was meant to be a joke on those who think 'holding is _always_ better than trading' etc. Not always. But yes. It's not for everybody. I admire people who can say 'i can't trade', you understand that.
I'm saying that the 'buy and hold'ers... The whole group that woke up after China ban rise, the moon kids.

I agree that a lot of people that bought sub 1k are completely different and quiet here.
And we're still failing at 7.6.

That's not what I was asking. I was asking why can't you even consider a failure.
The big difference is bitcoin has max supply of 21 million coins, ever. This scarcity will help retain its price over the long term, unlike ripple. 
I don’t have a problem with borrowing money to go long.  It just bothers me that many people go out of their way to borrow money to short, and this pushes down the price for others who care to hold bitcoin.  I realize in the long run it doesn’t matter much since I believe bitcoin will succeed long term despite the efforts of the bears. It’s just a pet peeve of mine.   
Anyone can put a limit buy order at $7,601, that is too obvious. :p

Nothing to worry about mate, I like taking risks and yes this entry might not look all that too attractive to some as you also stated. 

I opened at $7,570 because it is serving as a *temporary bottom* between here and $7,600. Price is bouncing at this mark, or at least holding up as of now for 90 minutes now.

For your short bro, I do not know what to advise but stay safe and all the best. What is your entry if you will?
You feel very insecure about your successful strategy overall in your posts. I'm able to see btc succeed despite its fundamental uselessness as a tradable asset however. That's the difference between me and you. But until further notice there's nothing to write home about 400$ "rallies".
On bull run almost all of them broke up, on bear trend almost all broke down, that's why I said somewhere that if it breaks up then it'll be incredibly bullish, the breaking itself and Target above major resistance area.
initial reaction: username checks out

I know you dude! You OG
burritos.  mission.  i am hungry.
Close enough!
What is your outlook on EOS guys moving ETH to exchange? Are you not worried they will dump these coins after mainnet?  


Edit:That is the only thing which concerns me. Otherwise I absolutely agree with you on ETH shorts/longs ratio. This feels like a no brainer to long ETH and even BTC.
Yea well I can see both your points, at least on a shorter timeframe. I guess I was trying to zoom out and see the larger move here. I still feel like we're likely to see $7700 broken before heading back down again.
With 0 years of experience trading with the big boys.
Yeah i agree i don't think we break into the 6000s this time around, but i assume when/if we do and we make newer lows, those predictions of 3\-4k won't seem as crazy, but yeah they do now.
Yup, agree with pretty much everything you said. I mean majority purely in terms of # of people. Since inexperienced traders will always outnumber experienced ones the majority favors the bulls right now. 

I don't mean anything insulting by this, but really, it seems pretty obvious that most longing here are doing it for a quick scalp/with tight stops or aren't particularly experienced. 

And I agree about what will happen if we go lower. That's why I'm saying it won't be so obvious. Once we make a new low people will start to question their bottom-calling abilities and every low will just be more confusing than anything. 

Lots of sadness and confusion to spread around and large bounces will feel fake and lame- people will start to short and lose all belief in the asset until all of the naysayers and get-rich-quick people are purged and then we'll go flat/sideways and then up.
I have... I’ve been in Bitcoin since 2011 and I still go to all of the conferences. I have probably met everyone along the way.

They also come through my town a lot. Since I live in Switzerland, we get a lot of Bitcoiners come through and gove talks at the Bitcoin Association. Tone gave a talk last Nov or so
Damn sloppy you bringing heat tonight - appreciate it, will take a look over this. 
100 - 1,000	15611

https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html


I don't either. Normally I'm pretty strong shorting into chop, but I'm annoyed. 

I'm slightly concerned that we didn't break yellow: https://www.tradingview.com/x/Bf6LPKo7/  

A lower low would have set my mind at ease. 
It certainly could. This market is being straight up retarded. 
You'd think after 3 cups of coffee I'd be awake enough to detect it, but appreciated! ;)
I'm kinda hoping for it just to see if that shuts them up for a bit. With the boring price action and the moonboy nonsense this daily has been lacking in good opportunities to learn something new from the pros here.
I'm sad a lot of people here I like hold bitcoin because I want to see it dump just for the hysteria and utter disbelief 
The new guys that entered after 20k think this is just a correction. They may be right. But they're not like we are. We know it can go either way, we understand the market, they only see moon. When they'll see that this isn't a correction... Then we will drop hard.
you're a helluva good guy.
You’re one of those good know it all’s. (And yes! There is such a thing!🤓) Thought I was going to have to get in a fight to defend your honor!👊🏼🤷🏼‍♀️
e:spelling
Russian bot upvotes, most likely. Fakenews.
I think TA is legit without it presenting every single possibility.  Watch the over-generalizations.  And man- sorry we can’t all be as smart as you. 
80% of people here, in the bear cave markets, get its just probabilities.... I think.


No problem. I personally am losing faith in my personal predictions but it's also a very common thing to get pushed out of good positions due to chop. 

This goes both ways though- anyone long here could be potentially very profitable soon.

My personal take on it is bearish obviously but the longer this continues the more I am like "well, who knows now"
We retraced 95% of the growth off the April 12 BGD and hit a full-tilt FOMO bullrun through 9K and couldn't even breach 10K. The sheer number of people hovering over the sell/short button if 7K breaks is the exact inversion of the people doing that over the buy button at 9900. We might see the same inverted outcome where 7K holds and we ping pong back up to the pennant at 9500. Maybe we break it that time, and my BTC holdings will be thrilled if we do, but the current market pressure is downward and it's on the buyers to run it up. They're meekly buying the dips to 7250-7400, but refuse to push through 7600? Shorts are not piling up.

If buyers cannot commit to $7600 BTC, how are they going to commit to $10200 BTC? There won't likely be a legitimate FOMO run until 10K breaks (or the pennant at 9500 for TA folk), and we couldn't do it last time we got within 1% of it. Not sure why anyone would expect we're going to try again. 
I don't "wish" that would happen, but until the crypto scene corrects to the point that we no longer have startups with "tokens" and no actual functioning product worth billions of dollars, I don't believe in it. Verge is worth half a billion USD. If that doesn't tell you that we're still in the bubble, then go ahead and top off your kool-aid. 

If your plan is a 3-10 year hold/DCA, then sure, buying BTC for $7500 will go well if BTC survives that long.

If you think $4K BTC is not possible because we've been over it for a year, I'm not sure what to say. Look at the S&P 500: https://www.tradingview.com/x/UlpOI1uX/  

$4K BTC is an 80% correction from the top. It's entirely possible. I put $4K in the next 12-18 months about as high on the probability scale as $20K in the next 12-18 months. I want BTC to succeed. That's why I'm shorting it--to get more. 
I rarely set actual stops. I set alarms. 

$7,600 is/was a point to say, "stop everything you're doing and pay attention to the market now." A lot of the time I market close immediately after my alarms go off. Sometimes I wait a little while first to make sure the "breakout" wasn't just the market getting ahead of itself.

In this case, the market was already back below $7,600 in the time it took me to notice the alarm and turn on my laptop. 
I pointe out the possibility of 2k at this point, not 4k. Although 4k is absurd, 2k is simply in the realm of fantasy, where 1 million is. Distance does not matter, there must be a fundemental reason for BTC to read such extremes, not just because charts and lines says so. 
Yeah see that’s where I disagree bc nearly everyone I know who bought after China ban rise bought and are holding and just kind of understand that their money is invested and could vanish. They don’t watch the price much at all. I do wonder what % of the current market is still made up of money from the moon kids you’re describing though. 
I understand technology, math, and psychology.
Because he’s delusional, like one or two others here.

That’s not to say Bitcoin will fail. I want it to succeed. But to be so blindly bullish in a bear trend is going to wreck people. It’s extremely irresponsible to try and influence less experienced traders with stupid bollocks. Chad just makes me laugh as he’s clearly a ridiculous parody.
So you don't think anyone should *ever* sell their bitcoin? 
My entry is almost your long entry :-D. But it's a rather big position for me, so even if my stop over 7610 gets hit it will be quite a loss for me. Speculated on another rejection at this horizontal resistence, but might backfire since ETH seems to break out from its ascending triangle right now, and there is a lot of underwater ETH shorts to squeeze. 
Thus far, I'm 4/4. No insecurity to be found.
Yes i'm worried about that!  This market is so dynamic, so many things to weigh up.  There is the possibility that they buy their own coins with the ETH, to create a pump!
No, I'm an accountant. Kindly remove the stick from your ass. I'm doing just fine.
Exactly! But between then and now, there is no need to put numbers on the board that are more than a few days away. It will be a slow crawl down and then a sharp drop if anything, and I’ll be the first to hng up the horns if 6800 gives way (or is it weigh)
Yeah this sub hasn't come anywhere close to dispair yet.
I could kind of be using this wrong, just started using this indicator. I do believe though that in terms of "returning to the mean" we haven't really spent a whole lot of time in $2-5k. That's the main reason I think we will revisit there. There is really nothing particularly long term bearish about it, it's just one of the possibilities based on bitcoin's past experience with large bubbles/sustained run-ups
You sir are a saint
Agreed, I'd be more at ease with another leg down. Hovering here is just a tease, low enough to break the wedge, not low enough to confirm there is no trend reversal.
I just hope not. Gonna wait until 7.6 breaks. You know that if this goes below 7k things may get pretty fast and pretty red.
I've been getting caught with my pants around my ankles a lot lately because of my excessive use of sarcasm. It's me, not you.
The thing about kool-aid drinking cryptobros? Everything is bullish. Breaking down probably wouldn't make them less vocal unless we got low enough to shake them out of the market and send them to rage-cry in the bathtub. Sub 6K.

Ironically that's probably the time to start loading up. 
Yeah whatever you say soros ;)
thanks man I appreciate that. I try to be decent! You're clearly a good guy, too
You're always here for me and are the best. Thanks :D
lol you're too nice. But I don't want to be obnoxious. Moreso than I already am, at least :P

you're great, jrice :D
eh it's cool I'll chill on commenting on this sub for a while, sorry if I've been overzealous. 

Get a little overexcited/impatient every once in a while. Apologies to all. 
This sub does have a disproportionately vocal bearish comment section lately. But...given the past few weeks it kind of makes sense, nah?

There's nothing wrong with being bullish but the complete lack of follow through here has been disappointing, to say the least.
nice.

We just saw a spike in volume and a short term high up from 7410 to 7440 within a span of seconds. What would you think about this action if we see 7550 or 7600\+ again?
Can I ask what you do for alarms? I’ve tried a phone app but by the time it alerts to me anything it’s usually several minutes late. Do you have anything that’s actually pretty instant?

Also if you don’t have a stop set do you just hope you there’s no giant candle that screws you? 
Wait so now you think 4k is absurd?? Oh please tell me why.... 
That's the point, those who did like you said don't talk here much so it's hard to predict.

That meant to be a joke on moon kids and it got serious :-(

Tbh I don't mind holders, just frustrated because of those 'shorters gonna get rekt' and 'this is all over, goblintown' guys here.
So all of this is telling you that this is the only thing on the world that just can't fail? It's technically impossible for it to fail and will go up infinitely?
I’m guilty of it to the extent I only trade max 10% of my stack and I never borrow to do it. Just for fun so I have something to keep myself busy while waiting for bitcoin to escape the chop.  

Nothing wrong with people selling to buy shit with it.   

I think when people borrow to short (especially large amounts) greed has gone too far.  I know it’s idealistic, but that’s how I feel. 
Uh man when I read this earlier today, I was really thinking either one of us will be facing some disappointment. Turned out to be just right. haha.
4/4 for what?
Accountant eh, and?
Hmm yeah predicting the bottom so early isn't very ideal we definitely have a long, bumpy ride to go. Way is right :\)
Look at this shit.
Market closed on June futures lag at 7462. F#$k this noise, I'm out for the night. 
What you speak of is the capitulation/despair point on the classic bubble chart. I'd say Moon Bois are a decent indicator.
That is true, another reason I want it to just drop is so can copy you and start my DCA sept futs.
Lol i just want to see what they say in disbelief. What kind of extraordinary reasoning will they come up with for how it's bullish 
Of course it does, we are in a downtrend. Burden is on the Bulls until further notice. 

I appreciate the dissenting opinions, good for the soul. I am not convinced we are in a 12-18 month trend down, but anyone who thinks we are a few months from an ATH either is getting some good drugs or realllly believes in an etf. 
I'm fine with seeing $7,600+ again...as long as buyers keep on going after.

Another spike up to $7,600+ that hovers for half a day before falling again?

Ya, that would be rage inducing.
It's all noise until 7600 breaks, then it's interesting until 7900 breaks.
You are the one claiming 4k is a decent possiblity, the burden of truth lies with you. J don't see 4k because we consistently failed to even breach 6k and cryptocurrencies in general are maturing rapidly and barring any systematic shock, such crash to 4k is fundementally impossible right now. Your turn, enlighten me.
I hear you man, all good. Happy weekend to you 
Buy corrections
TBH this still looks like bear flag.
Lol, watched the charts, needed 5 min off and it pumped.

Tbh, rising wedge went into bear flag and then into ascending triangle. I suspected it'll go up. But it's still noise until 7.6 breaks hard.
Only if the premium actually drops to a heavy discount like last time we dropped down there. Even then I might be hesitant. If we break down from the daily pennant, I don't know where the bounce is. I'd probably have to come up with a pretty complicated DCA strategy in conjunction with a short position. I should probably do that ahead of time in Excel just in case haha
They saw 20k, they think it's just a beginning and a steal at those prices. It will need a lot more dropping for them to see.
> is getting some good drugs or realllly believes in an etf. 

bruh this is exactly what OP is talking about, reducing someone’s perspective to a drug- induced delusion isn’t exactly productive, yaknowwhatimsayin? 
You're saying going to 4k is fundamentally impossible?! Then you obviously don't understand markets at all.

Your naivety is scary. 4k is entirely possible. If we get to 6k again it is unlikely to hold for a third time. Triple bottoms seldom if ever do.

You are basing your beliefs solely on 'hope'. Which proves you know nothing about our current situation. 
You're correct: https://www.tradingview.com/x/AcV0kFNC/  

I'm just grouchy because I had an offer on a house fall through last night lol
I'll short our channel top near 7700 or a breakdown of 7300. At least I got out in green. Not a lot, but washed the loss from the last short I got stopped out of 
If you do, do share what you are thinking!
Ok, fine, i did not mean to be rude.

I feel like nothing in this market says we are posed for a run to the ATH absent something huge to the market, like an etf, in the next few months. Other good news has passed us by with little to no affect.

Fair? 
Yes, right now it's fundamentally impossible for bitcoin to go 4k. Technically everything is possible, and apparently you're only source of judging the market is based on technical indicators. 

It really amuses me that how, time and again, this market has proven the likes of you wrong and yet, again you simply accuse others of being "naive". Technical analysis is not a science, it's not an offshoot of statistics. To apply its empirical principles on a market as tiny, volatile and manipulated as crypto is naive. You're typically biased, and everything that you follow suffers from confirmation bias. Typical behavior, to accuse every opposite idea as being "naive" and "scary", this is a defensive behavior. something rings true deep in your unbiased cognitive functions. find that something and you'll have a better understanding of this market.
Don't get the house thing...
Messing around with it still, but got a basic calculator going.

I think that’s totally fair and you’re probably right.  Without some catalyst it could be quite difficult to approach ATH levels in the medium term. Have a nice weekend man. 
I can't disagree with that!
For you to say it's fundamentally impossible proves to me that you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. I'm done with you now.

Your lack of knowledge is appalling. Learn how markets work instead of talking absolute shit. 
I mean I'm in the process of trying to buy a house, made an offer on one, and it fell through. It's discouraging. Totally non-crypto event though haha
You would use 7X for DCA long? Or just to short while in goblin town.
You too, hot soccer lady. 
Yeah whatever, enjoy your underwater short
Yeah, I meant I don't get what means that offer fell through. Here you have a price for a house and if you want to buy you can negotiate with seller in real time
Personally, probably not. The leverage matters mostly due to liquidation point, though, and I was toying around with what would allow me to build from 6800-5000 without ever hitting liquidation along the way. If 5K fell, I'm not sure I'd want to still hold it, so it makes sense to maximize it based off cutting it at 49xx anyway. 

I'll probably keep playing with it. Realistically I'd probably use 5x. The goal is to build up a position exactly offsetting your short as close to your expected reversal point as possible. As long as you hold your short throughout, you're basically just slowly locking in profits off your short equal to your long add size as it drops. 
Appreciate it, junior ice 
Good guess.. But completely wrong.

Please explain to me why you think, in your opinion, that bitcoin fundamentally can't go to 4k. I'm all ears... 
Same here, we were just in negotiations with the seller (not yet with any verbal/written acceptance) and the sellers decided to pull the listing and rent it instead because they would have taken a small loss on the sale (supposedly at the recommendation of their tax accountant). Kinda shady and pretty shitty, but whatever. On to the next.
Yeah that's definitely something to think about. I think the plan would be dictated on how we go through/bounce around in the 6K range. If we even get there.
Oh... Ok, that sux. I had same situation but the other way, just moved in to apartment and owners decided to sell :-\
Heh, that happened to us 2 years ago. 
Build your own house, you won't have problems with sellers ;-)
