[Daily Discussion] Monday, April 23, 2018 -- TITLE
#New post: [\[Daily Discussion\] Tuesday, April 24, 2018 →](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8eho8a/daily_discussion_tuesday_april_24_2018/)
This has certainly been an exciting 2 weeks in crypto. The bear in me shorted all the logical places, and it went poorly. Fortunately, most of those were scaled in hedge shorts against long positions from lower, except the big hit I took on the BGC. All I really did since 8K was cost myself some profits as we blew through 8300 and then the log line. I closed my 8280 long at 8950 yesterday, but have reopened at 8830. Sorry I wasn't posting updates this weekend--was under the weather and was mostly on mobile on the couch.

We've attempted 9K 4 or 5 times in the last 48 hours. We're still in an ascending wedge, which gives me pause. I opened another short at 8950 which will scale up to 100% of my long value by 9280. I'll bail on it over 9400 and just get out of the way of the moonboys if that happens. 

We're up 30% in 3 weeks with no significant retrace. This feels unsustainable. BCH is pumping due to an upcoming fork in mid May (which makes so much more sense), but alts everywhere are skyrocketing. The recent pattern (week?) has been alts pumping BTC ratios high, then BTC following to cool off the ratio. I expect this to happen again here to pull us over 9K. 

We've got an ascending wedge, which we're on the support line for right now. We also have an ascending triangle forming on the 9K top, which I expect to break up short term. There's plenty of room in our ascending wedge to climb up to 9200.

Still holding my Sep futs long from 6410 as well.
I don't trade but I just bought a bit of bitcoin for the first time since january. I'm excited.
4 hour BBands are 3.8% wide.

Last time they were this tight was on November 24th. The BBands we're 3.5% wide on Nov 24th.

The time before, October 24th, the 4 hour BBands were 5.2% wide

BBands can break either way. You might be able to argue that they tend to break with the trend. Right now, there's debate that a trend reversal is real. The direction of the next breakout is meaningful in this regard.
SO half the traders in here are reconsidering their position, majority of them expecting a downtrend any minute.

Yet casual buying goes on above 8.9. every dip failed to enduce more sell off. 

Bears are running out of ammo. Bulls are more eager to buy at current price instead of waiting for the 8.8 and sub 8.7. they want to get in right now.

I added 3x onto my long position yesterday & today. Been waiting for big oppertunity and i feel like this is it for me
Remember: the meaning around hanging around a price range no matter how tight is contextual.  If we're stuck in a range after a prolonged downtrend then a true upward breakout (volume supported BGD 6.8 to 7.9k) it's probably bullish (idea behind bull flag).  If stuck in a range after prolonged bullishness and a subsequent downward technical breakout, it's probably bearish (bear flag) looking for more breakdown.   Consolidation in price is basically what we're looking at.  There is no true sustained selling since *the* BGD which means accumulation which means a good chance at another leg up.  This is evidenced by volume, volume is almost always the tell.  The longer this part takes, the larger the move will end up being.  The trend is your friend until the end.  There are zero compelling, substantive reasons to be bearish before a break below 8.5k which was THE MAJOR resistance turned support. Why do you think dips are being furiously bought up since? Unless that breaks everyone who is already long needs to sit on their hands.  It's a lot less stressful and keeps your eye on the big picture!  Impatience and lack of discipline is what will ultimately drain your accounts.  You'll be more successful staying in a winning trade until the end then trying to capture every little peak and trough.  Being even 60% right on 1 huge trade is more profitable in terms of mental and financial capital than trying to be 100% on 20 little trades -- not as fun sure, but that's what the casino is for.  The more you trade, the more a casino it becomes.  Almost all moves are fractals of a larger move, so if you can deal with a tiny bit of drawdown while staying with the trend, you will have a much better time.
Nobody worried about the lower volume the last 3 candles have compaired to the other weeks on the weekly chart: https://imgur.com/a/RXEFqWy
I wouldn't be surprised if we head up with barely any retracing until we're testing the bottom of the 2017 log channel (the heavy purple one https://i.imgur.com/xpkDB8Y.png), currently around $10.7k and heading towards $11.2k by May 1 (the bottom of the channel, not that we'll be testing it that soon).
Well, the market has successfully brute forced its way back into the rising wedge as I have it drawn. 

I'm sure others have it drawn more conservatively.

Either way, I'm back in my long at $8,870 with stops below $8400. 

If the log resistance line breaks back down, then I'll take the moderate loss. 

If it holds, I can stop concerning myself with this nonsensical chop.
400b market cap
This is what im seeing right now : https://www.tradingview.com/x/c4vUdXhU/

Bull penant inside ascending wedge inside very big ascending triangle. A break down could still allow for a break up later. 
I'll get a lot more bullish for the short term if we can sustain activity above $9200. Looks like we might be about to challenge it again.  
Opening a long here at $8,926 with stops below $8,800.

Risk/reward still remains higher for a long than a short, even if my confidence in a breakout to the upside is limited.

EDIT: My position obviously suggests that, at least in my opinion, a strong breakout above $9,000 would almost immediately blast through the "real" resistance level at $9,200.

*"There's no volume!! BART this! BART that!!"* -some idiot on a Telegram just now

Here's what I see: https://imgur.com/a/VdICXLi

I see: very-clear, consistent increase in trailing 24H volume across the market since early-April. The volume's definitely there.

2hr MACD (One of my faves) turned red 36 hrs ago, we've gone up $100 in that time. 

To me that says the selling pressure will have to ramp up for us to go down.  
https://imgur.com/a/S7UmJWw

So, we broke through both the ATH resistance and reclaimed the log support I've been focused on lately. Conveniently, we then retested and confirmed the higher log line as newly turned support shortly thereafter.

After that we've been chopping around. The 4 Hr chart is showing bearish divergences simultaneously with hidden bullish divergences. My chart is zoomed out but look closely and you'll be able to see both. That makes me inclined to believe it's mostly just noise and we don't really have an established range/trend (which is when RSI works best). Thinking we don't really have an established range/trend makes sense logically too since we obviously just broke out of a 3 month trend. That doesn't mean we've reversed into a long term bull trend, it could just be a less steep downtrend (see 2014), but it certainly means we're in a different situation now.

Short term, as /u/haserfauld just posted, I'm inclined to view the action post ATH breaking as an ascending triangle with a possible ascending wedge on longer time spans. As for the wedge, taking into account the large supports/resistances we've broken in the time span of the wedge and the lack of confluence with the wedge support/resistance and other trend lines I'm not valuing it too highly (but it's definitely there). That wedge support is crazy steep so it'll no doubt fall out at some point.

It's worth considering that throwbacks occur quite often with large breaks. If we throwback to the descending log resistance we broke,  by May 1st it would be down around 8k.

I've been bought in again since 8.6k (stops). Heavily considering this as just a long term hold - I've done pretty well overall since the 6.4k bottom and my average entry, while I haven't actually calculated it, is pretty low. For now, I'll be monitoring the log support we've reclaimed. If BTC breaks down through it on high volume in the short term I'll heavily consider selling to guard against a throwback to the descending resistance.

Given that I'm transitioning to a longer term hold mindset, you'll probably see me mostly stop posting unless the above scenario happens. I'll still be lurking every now and then (also on the altcoin discussion).
Still holding my 9000 short but I'm starting to feel the rumblings of a BGD.
Throwaway for obvious reasons. Have been a diehard hodler since 2013. Made my largest buy at 220. Hedl rock solid through it all, China, ragequit, China, ETF rejection, 2x, BCH, FUD FUD FUD. Held all the way up and down but then at 8k, after going through all those years of ups and downs, I got well and truly shaken out of the market and sold. I made enough to hopefully take care of my family without (major) financial worries, but I couldn't imagine it going down any more (portfolio was almost all crypto). Complete textbook shakeout.  

It feels good if I scroll out far enough, but man it feels bad too. It feels bad not to have sold anywhere else between 8-20k, and it feels bad to watch the price go back up being out of the market that I've been (winning) in for so long. (I locked up my profits for a while, so cant FOMO back in.) So many lessons here, but the main one being that the psychology of this stuff is a real bitch. Don't be like me and have no plan.
The stark reality: that feeling when you sell your stack early & obsessively ruminate on how the once in a lifetime crypto wide-adoption trend is about to pass you by.
Closed my $2mm long from $8908 posted [here,](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8e0z4r/z/dxrubxd) at $9188 for a total profit of slightly over 3.1%. I expect to see a better entry point as we bounce around below $9200.

Market in full buy the dip mode... alts still out of control which might create buy pressure on BTC or at least reduce sell pressure...chewy long...Mike long... let's FOMO in! Stop below 8740.
honestly should we still care about the wedge at all?

Isn't this just an ascending triangle at this point ?

Gearing up for the sixth encore of, "The Ballad of Heartbreak Hill".

This precarious market couldn't be more exciting. Even stalwart veterans are second guessing what were firm positions 24 hours ago. 

Back and forth, back and forth. The pendulum swings, but who's getting chopped?

ANDDD AWAAAYYYYY WE GOOOOO.

Heartbreak Hill (and BCH) is no mooorreeeeee!

Sippin' on sweet nectar by the shoooorrreeeeeeee!
Well, FWIW... [TOUCHDOWN!](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/YRZvdurN-The-target-of-current-bubble-lays-between-40k-and-110k/)

The dream is alive!
I see a extremely big ascending triangle, a very big ascending wedge and a small bull penant.

Who the fuck do I listen to?
It’s beyond hard for me to get anything done around the house right now.

I’ve been in my laundry room looking at the 1 minute chart for 15 minutes with intentions of a large candle going either direction as things are starting to heat up. 

We either make it or break it. 

Edit: looks like 9k is about to be tested on Binance

And Kraken is over 9k already. 

edit edit: Binance over 9k!!!

27 of the last 33 12h candles have been green. only 6 have been red.

Even in the December bull run, we had not such a ratio.
Just want to find out who’s in the same position as me:

Buyers have been strong recently, but have let up in the past 24 hours and have failed to breach 9k.

You want to open up a long Incase a BGD happens and don’t want to miss the price action, yet you don’t want to long and go short because we are overdue for a correction.

Best play to sit out? Or open a small long with tight stops? Or a hedge short? 
1h RSI is perfectly neutral (50) by now, and also the 4h RSI has come down from 79 to 62. The daily is still ok anyways.

I've been buying some more here, without leverage (btw, it's interesting to see that both Bfx shorts and longs have been virtually unchanged over the past days). 
These huge contracts always get me.  Wish I had enough money to lose this much:  
 
https://twitter.com/BitmexRekt/status/988576398037135360
Stopped out in profit on my 8800 long at 9200. There's been a signal line crossover on the MACD so might wait a little while and observe the price action before entering into another position.  
Good support level buy volume following these big legs up. If we hold 9.2 I think the same scenario will play out until 10k where the real battle ensues. If bulls win there I won't take profits until around 11.5k levels.

edit: assuming we even breach 9.2 lol
We're having an influx of r/buttcoin trolls here. Is it a bullish or bearish sign? I think it's bullish.
Any place has free Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies volume profile charts? I just wanna look at them for a few seconds. Seems pointless buying a TradingView subscription just for this.
If this does go through 9-9400 today it's going to be spectacular to watch.

more we stay at 9k it feels like players are accumulating.
the more we stay here more i think we will break it with a start of a big run..
Enky flipped bull: https://twitter.com/Bitcoin_Trading/status/988426094087897088

I'm still long, cautious that we can't break $9k, but IF we do I don't want to miss that candle..
Did we finally break through the rising wedge? https://cryptocharts.org/i/1524512923.png
Do you guys put much stock in moving averages as a source of actual support/resistance, or view it as just another indicator of where price is relative to historical values?

(It looks like today we're sandwiched between the 100 & 200 EMA on the daily)
Just a tiny long term prediction of prices where i expect significant resist and/or support in the future : https://www.tradingview.com/x/DFti7cgl/

It kinda looks like a Fibonacci chart. 
Just woke up from alarms and realized although I got stopped out in profit from my 8850 long , it was of course at 8921 and missed this BGD

Ah well... now let's see if 9k holds or not. At least I had some other margin positions and a take profit order at 9000 on futures. Interesting that swaps and both futures basically is the same price within a 5$ range now btw
Is that pop finished or is there likely to be another leg up to 9300-9400?

The height  of the ascending triangle puts the target at 9400, right?
First time in a while that I've seen both June and September futures trading higher than the swaps
I noticed this trend, correct me if I'm wrong: whenever BTC goes sideways or stagnates for too long before breaking a resistance, alts go crazy. BGDs almost simultaneously across most alts, inciting FOMO. It's seems like some big BTC holders trying to stimulate the market (and BTC) by pushing the alts when BTC won't make a move. As soon as we have BTC movement, alts are sold but not to the previous lows (FOMO buyers will not sell). Rinse and repeat. Almost like someone is doing a CPR on the market to get it going. It's working so far.
Is 9.2k a good entry point... Seems like cheaper entries are a thing of the past now
Please take any alt discussion to the [Altcoin Discussion thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8e8qpw/altcoin_discussion_monday_april_23_2018/). If your post pertains specifically to impacts on the bitcoin market, it can likely stay here.
400B Crypto Market Cap breached.  Think this will serve as the catalyst for breaking 9000 sustainably.  Stay tuned
Based on the channel we've established today, I suspect we'll bounce up now at \~8910\-8915.
9k - The war of attrition 
I re-opened my long at $8930 with stops at $8710.  The fact that this didn't fall off a cliff yesterday and bounced on $8750 suggests the market is ready to test $9200 before we recurse to the log line (if we do).
By my charts, we undeniably fell out of the ascending wedge. In previous weeks that would have caused a drop of $100-300+. Instead, we're trying to climb back into it. 

GDAX volume is back to very low levels (8500 volume). We've been hugging this lower line for what feels like an eternity. Mixed signals for me.
Fun fact, if we meander around in this range as long as we did 7.6\-8.4k before making a convincing move \(BGD anyone?\) then we have *5 more days of this left.*

I dunno about anyone else, but by god that sounds painfully frustrating. 
LBC transaction volume is continuing to rise thanks to Europe and Latin America:

* https://anacoinda.github.io/localbitcoins/europe.html
* https://anacoinda.github.io/localbitcoins/latin-america.html

USD volume is surging to All Time Highs in North America. This is mostly thanks to Canada.

https://anacoinda.github.io/localbitcoins/north-america.html

LBC appears to be very strong despite the bear trend observed in the overall market.

EDIT: **4 hour BBands are as tight as they've been for a while.**
9.2-9.3 is a historically significant resistance/support level. Just bc we rocketed up doesn't mean we'll blow through this range too (although the buying is ferocious thus far). Don't get caught with your pants down if this sputters out here and turns lower. Hate to be that guy, sorry. 
Every dip is gobbled with gluttony, sellers should really let 9k go here tbh, doesn't make much sense
I like watching how the market is behaving at the moment. Even though I am 1 feet deep, I like the trades that are taking place right now, they are very clear and contain a lot of information about the emotions and attitudes of the traders (other than the bots). 

We are determining the true value of BTC for the coming short-mid term period (which may eventually lead to a longer perspective). There is one group of people who see it overly valued, and there another group who see it as undervalued. Traders are being exchanged within these two groups. 

As I always insist how consumer behavior or human nature plays a crucial role in any given trade (in addition to the knowledge and skills being the prime factor), what I am noticing is that attitudes are being changed. Tight trading range and dips being bought up quickly are good examples.

I am finding it more interesting now to watch the trades taking place. Just keep it going folks, very soon we will find out where we are heading to (short-mid term). Cheers!

Jesus that massacre on Kraken. Thank God I exited my short positions before this.

http://prntscr.com/j990ok
All these longs opening seem a bit premature to me. We blasted right through the entire 7k - 8k range in about 15 minutes and have climbed another $1k without any hint of a retrace or testing any support. How can this run be even close to sustainable without lots of new money entering the market?

It honestly looks to me like the price is being propped up so whales can offload the sub-7k coins they spent so long accumulating. 
Back from work, we've moved $5. 


What a dick tease.  Still don't see this crashing down. 
[These mini dumps keep getting bought up veraciously.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/FXAYMRUH/)  We may have a little more downside here in the next few hours, but I'm still thinking we'll see $9200 before $8500.
Tough week for me. Thought I had set up a stop loss to close out my short before I left for the weekend but fucked it up somehow, just had to close it underwater for a big hit to my trading stack. Taking a trading break for a while.
Ah well, adding to my long at 8885 here. Either we totally break down 8600 or more, or the slow creep upwards continuing and then you want to be in a bigger, low leveraged position to catch that move. That  dips are getting smaller and smaller and bought up faster and faster makes me think this is the way to go here
Had a buy set on June futures at 8797 that would have gotten filled but I got spooked out on the last dip and cancelled it. This market is incredibly choppy and one side is eventually going to get hurt bad. Have your stops ready if you're short. 
[removed]
Moved stops from long up to 8700. If I get stop hunted then so be it, I'll happily ride an unleveraged position of BTC and sleep better at night. I don't see how BCH pumping can benefit BTC on longer timeframes. The inverse correlation will return if flippening speculation comes back, and if it has been propping BTC up lately I don't see why it won't also pull it back down with it. 
Out of curiosity, if we do break up from 9000, what's the short-mid term target?
bitmex giving anyone else problems accessing their site? 
Well cancelling my 8.8 buy offer for the june futures that would have executed has turned out to be quite the regretable play. 
.....and here we go second attempt at 9.1k lets see how it holds. Fomo eminent. New people don't be afraid to hold for real...your not in this game to break even or make small gains.
my take is that the whales are letting shorters accumulate their shorts before blasting through $9K and then $10K and maybe even $11K with one large move to squeeze them hard
[removed]
Back into the wedge, which completes in about 24 hours. Possibly a good short r/r to short the resistance line w/ stops around $9400, given that a pullback is expected and the range is tight.

Not a great sign, imo, if this keeps popping up past 10K and 11K, especially given the corresponding behavior of certain alts. Feels like a bull trap in the making. Then again, so have many other bull runs in the making. 

The corresponding 2014 bull trap topped out after about two weeks and the charts still look pretty similar, so there's reason to expect more sustained upside. However, this bear market is moving a bit faster, so maybe the it'll top out sometime early next week. Or maybe the bear market really is over and we'll be above 12K before we know it. Kind of doubt it.
The fact that we are not even testing support just go up, hover, then more up is just astonishing. I think it even might be time to change my flair to neutral or even bullish as we rocket in total insanity with FOMO towards 10K and the great beyond.

inb4 premature celebratiton
Closed the rest of my long from 7940 here. Might be a bit premature, just how my I closed the first half at 8530. My next play will be buy the dip or sell somewhere upper 9Ks.
[removed]
Volatility coming, right on the edge of the wedge with 2hr BB pinch.

Will it be the 2am pamp or damp? Personally I don't see it getting past that 9200 level if it goes up from here. R/R seems very much in favor of short. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/MKqWmvXy/
The amount of buy pressure here is crazy. I've closed out of my short at a decent loss in BTC but I think I'll make up the USD with this next leg up. I don't know if someone is collecting a lot because they think the bear market is over or the "money on the side-lines" is finally jumping back in. Even if we do break down here I don't think we are going down far. Everyone is probably in "buy-the-dip" mode and so I think we'll go down to 8.4 tops. That's where I would have broken even on my short and went long. And because everyone is in "buy-the-dip" that's precisely why we aren't going down. The market never gives you what you want.
I wrote last week that since the dips has been coupled with more sideways than previous months, I started buying physical BTC instead of just margin trading and feel quite comfortable with this. Seems like more people had the same idea, and they now consider BTC a mid term good hold(or to trade alts with?) and market is not only overleveraged driven. 

This could also explain the lack of Bart patterns last week, since those is a result of cascading liquidations or stop hunting. 
I've got some new side money coming in so I think it's time to finally build up a decent trading stack. Any recommended resources for a trading newbie?
I would be really disappointed if this doesn't decide tonight:

Looks like alts are doing the btc $6k to $12k thing. Lots of them up 100% in the past week or so...

Is it all this obvious? alts follow btc movements about a month or two months after? 

I'm actually thinking this is sort of bearish actually, it's not gonna be good for the space if alts dump back down over a month again 


I was thinking this could lead btc higher but given what happened last time alts mooned I'm a lil worried over it 
Short from 9200, stops on a clean break of 9.3. This run is promising, but given how overbought we are and the restistance in the 9.2-9.3 range, seems like a worthwhile bet. Also feels a bit like a blow off top (looking at you BCH, as well as some other alts). 

Sell when others are euphoric and buy when others fear, right??
What happened to u/binaryechoes? 
[https://imgur.com/a/NFIoBOr](https://imgur.com/a/NFIoBOr)

Chewy was bandying around the concept yesterday\(?\) that knocking on 9k for the fourth time would probably have it cave, as the buying pressure demonstrates a stalwart reluctance to back down.

On a 1hr chart you could definitely argue we've gone and had our 4 attempts, but on a 4hr we're about to either break down out of this channel \(8850 and below and I'd say we have, so I could be chatting shit before I even hit post, so balls on the line n' all that\) or about to finally break through it.

Just a bit of speculation, don't trade on this. Could go up, could go down ;\)

900+ btc buy wall at 8880 on bfx, someone's ready to buy the dip

it would take a pretty big market sell to knock us out of whatever pattern we've been in 
/u/MikeXBT and /u/_chewtoy_ 

Considering you guys both longed around 8900 ( congrats on gains) where do you guys both stand right now?

Im assuming you’re going to give the market a second to figure out what it’s doing before you make any rational decisions. 

Edit: Disregard Mike, we posted our comments at nearly the exact same time. 
Does anyone else think we might be seeing a bull pennant on the 15 min charts?


It would require ignoring a few wicks though, so I don't know if this is valid or not.


What do y'all think?


**Edit**: We just made a 25 dollar move upwards, hopefully this is a breakout of the bull pennant, but it is too early to tell.
Id place my bet as 9k+ by end of day 
I'm going short heavily if we fail to break 9.1k again.
Knockout punch looks imminent one way or the other (probably north because that's how it usually goes. I mean a dead cat worth $6k? Please.)

If Asia is as good at math as they say, they'll buy it up past $9k pretty quick. Then Bitcoin wakes up and pours a cup of coffee. Pours, not makes. 
Model price based on tx rate: 7-day average: $4516, 28-day average: $3986.

 Model price = 10^-0.638 \* (tx per day)^2.181 / # total coins.

Explanation is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2hyl9c/daily_discussion_wednesday_october_01_2014/ckxhy9y) with [historical graphs of price vs. model](https://i.imgur.com/HnZQ9rv.png) (last updated 2018-04-09) and [graphs of other correlations](http://imgur.com/a/7koaG) (last updated 2017-01-30). The code is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2oyrfq/code_for_tx_model/) if you want to improve on it.


**Accuracy of model and recent bearishness**

 Note, that this model has been doing relatively well if it is within *the same order of magnitude* of the price. That is to say, it is not a very accurate predictor of price, and to be within a factor of two of the market price (as recently) is effectively no strong signal. However, the prediction did dip just before the recent pop.

**Batching, UTXO count and so on.**

I have seen no convincing evidence that batching is currently a major effect to reduce the daily tx rate, and a cursory examination shows a similar dip in the UTXO network measure.
I am interested, long term, in alternatives to tx rate (given lightning etc) but I do not think UTXO count is a convincing alternative over, for example, unique addresses.
Parsing the blockchain directly for outputs per block is one possible alternative to deal with batching, payment channels notwithstanding.
Yesterday i saw a post about the top OKEX contract holder holding 4x the size than the next biggest contract holder. Does anyone know if he/she is long or short? 
https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZxBrPCU2/

is this hidden bullish divergence valid ? I wonder as it's right after a confirmed bearish divergence.
Do people in here remember u/Odbdb from back in the day? I have been a lurker since 2013-ish and I don't remember him... Honestly today was the first time I took notice of him as a "contributor".

Wonder what his deal is today. His post history seems fine up until today

Seeing that the daily cloud resistance is getting heavy if we cant break and stay above 9.2K (heavy resistance) then by also breaking the wedge by not having enough buy pressure we could be reentering the downtrend and go below it and thus turn it into resistance once more. 

Also seeing that the dips outside of the wedge on the hourly is getting bigger make it seem like wedge support is failing. Altough fakeouts are beeing rejected at the hourly cloud support. If we venture below 8.7K, then my gents the bears will come out of hiding and a retest of 8.2 or 7.8 K is inevitable (ish)

MACD is on the hourly about to turn negative if not beeing rejected and sent back up.

I noticed that the Orderbook on finex has added another 1K+ in depth in the 9K range

EDIT: FIXED LINK
question for the bears who deem every bit of upwards movement to be "artificial", "fake," "inorganic" etc:

What qualifies as REAL price increase to you? 

Examine your biases 
For those who say there hasn't been volume or FOMO. I get that this isn't exactly what you mean, but don't be delusional, accept the possibility, and that's all that it really is at the moment, a possibility, of reversal.

https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-nears-9000/amp/
Closed my long for a small loss at around $8,900.

Pretty unimpressed with the buying pressure at the moment.
Major resistance is at 9.1? 9.2? Just asking so I can get a better picture of a good entry point. 
So it turns out that I shouldn't have canceled my bid ladder for long [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8e0z4r/daily_discussion_sunday_april_22_2018/dxssic5/).

And the short I added to [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8e0z4r/daily_discussion_sunday_april_22_2018/dxsvjwr/) when closing that long has now closed at BE.

All in all, no regrets.  It was successful risk management that I nearly broke even in this chop, and I was positioned well for opportunities for breakout in either direction.  I'm quite pleased actually with the results, I even slept ;)

Not in a position.  *Want* to build a long but...
I have a question about trading ratios. For example, if I buy 1 BTC and 1 ETH, and they both go up exactly 10% and then I sell, I made 10%. If were to have made the trade using the ratio, would I have only broken even (the ratio didn't change), or since I needed to own the asset to make the trade, is my value still up 10%?

Entered a long at $8,955. Lets see how it plays out.

Opening a small **gambling short** at 8930 at x3 leverage. Let see how this goes. Not too confident about it.

**EDIT:** Adding to my short, MACD has flipped, Hourly about to be rejected of reentering the wedge (unmodified).
Long from 8.9 - took profit at 9.2 on half, leaving the other half open with stops at 9. Good plan?
Lol at those here trying to short an ascending bitcoin triangle at breakout to the upside. Then complain TA doesn't work?

If you didn't buy the 6xxx-7xxx dip you are not in favorable territory. Just hold on and watch bitcoin does its magic.

Does no one find it concerning that volume is solely based on whale movement? When the whale stops, so does volume. We're all celebrating whales moving one way, but what then when they decide enough is enough and move the other way?

I think I am going to wait for a good entry point to go long here.
https://www.tradingview.com/x/QumPFXaK/

Getting a little nervous here.
Haven't been able to sustain breaking above 9000.
Huge ascending wedge still in play.
Hugging the supporting trendline of the wedge.
Bearish divergence on 4hourly.

If you take away the increase of the mega short squeeze, it lines up nicely with prior support level around 8000 which also is a 0.5fib.

Even if this played out, could still argue a bullish reversal as higher low would still be achieved.

Certainly won't be shorting however cos the BGD dispenser could have other plans.
[removed]
Are there any regulars here? I haven't been here in ages so wouldn't know.
Oh, epic short squeeze? 
So I’ve nearly erased 50% of my losses over the last week with the current long I’m in. 

I dont want to be greedy with intentions this could go higher, and wind up losing a good chunk of my profit. 

I could close the long here for a solid gain or leave it open.

What do you guys recommend I do? I’ve never been in a position like this before

https://www.tradingview.com/x/dhVP7wYf

Gearing up for one more pump and/or a large breakdown. Makes sense considering profits have to be realized before buying pressure dries up. 
buy stopped at 9150.. hopefully it was the right move
Guys, this market is wholly manipulated. I'm not convinced that it can keep moving up until new money comes in, which I don't think we have--just too many plumbers and MLM moms and Uber drivers and insurance salesmen got abslutely pwned, and have told their friends so. Whenever the whale bears get enough longs to liquidate it will go down hard. That is what a bear market looks like. Drops, followed by runs driven by liquidated shorts, followed by drops.

If I saw strong evidence that retail was flooding back in, I would be so bullish right now. Otherwise, we are just getting ping-ponged by the whales.
Have my long from 8870 range, but with the current action it feels like either I ride this to 9200 and above or just lose it at 8500. Taking profits now would be to stressful 
My noob point of view. Alts are recovering more than bitcoin because the bear trend isn’t over yet. We could still face the 5k-3k, and if it come true, Alta will suffer more than bitcoin, and for this reason maybe the big player behind them are pumping their alts.
Shill me, I am new.

If anyone follow the Chartguys on Youtube, they called the breakout to 9200 30 minutes before it happened!  Even said it was happening tonight. It was incredible.  Here's a link to the video https://youtu.be/8fh0GGdvbEA

it's quite funny how much info is written about "muh whales" vs how little surfaces. Then big conspiracies in organizations like UN,  different kind of election fraud, or panama tax haven documents are quite easily found and talked about.



I uncharacteristically have longed this up from 8.2. I do think we will have a major retrace (15%) soon though. Probably from 9.3-9.4 maybe from 9.8. Can't keep going up, just like it can't keep going down. Will need to retest. I'm exiting my long, but will enter a staggered shorts from 9.2 to 9.8.

Looks like another failed attempt at breaking 9k. I don't find that to be particularly bullish. However, the buying pressure has been relentless so who knows....

After weeks of sideways, what has caused this pump over the last couple of days? Some big news come out that I missed? Or just the market taking a general turn? It seems pretty stable, surely not just random volatility.

If you draw lines looking for a justification for the current price, you have to go back to 3k.... and maybe yeah I could see everything since then to have been a little manic

On Bitmex I was always doing just perpetual, I did a *very small* June futures, luckily got in a lot lower and went long.   I know the month futures don't charge you a daily premium, do I get charged more if I close it before June? Is there a reason to keep it open until the June date is up? I was reading up on it and didn't see those questions really answered.  Also do I have to close it in June or can I let it ride for longer if I want?

Something about this doesn't quite feel right. I don't know how to describe it. I'm not entirely convinced we're setting steady footing over $9k, rather, that we're forming a rounded peak. That's my gut feeling at the moment, which I hope is wrong.
The recent up candle is basically caused by margin longs opening and margin shorts closing. That is not a positive sign especially since bitfinex led the charge over other exchanges.

Closing my long in slight profit.

Hey fellas, back with another LIVE analysis of BTC and the cryptosphere with perhaps some trading sprinkled in. Open discussion format for anyone interested.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wdg4a4iDewg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wdg4a4iDewg)
There is an old fashioned pump going on right now.  Forget your TA unless it can figure out when the pump is going to end (impossible).

An entity is systematically buying EVERYTHING except BTC right now and using BTC as a safe haven while bag holders fork over their fiat chasing inside info (rigged).  

If a coin moves get in quick while adding to liquidity to avoid fees and move back to BTC just as fast in the same way. 

Take no more than 3% at any time. If you are particularly daring reverse with the same shorts but ultimately, **Stay safe**.  This will end badly for you if you aren't careful. 
Wondering if traders keep buying the dips and no one buy in $9,000 range, how are we going to move across $9,000.

9k is slapping buyers hard in the face but they won't back down. 5th try on the 4hour and counting. They have until midnight UTC to break this wall before meeting the downtrend of the big wedge. 

On bfx 2750+ btc would be needed to be bought to break 9200. The same amount of btc would be needed to be sold to arrive at 8650, which interestingly is right on the previous long term support that broke through in the end of march (dotted red line).

I just closed my long from 8880 at 9010 but I won't be shortig this madness. I'm thinking of layering long entries from 8700 to 8400 to catch the rebounce. I will also put a stop buy at +-~~8225~~ 9225 to catch the pump if some whale decides to throw 25 million dollar into the fomo train.

EDIT: grammar

It seems the bearwhales have taken a break as well.
> I closed my 8280 long at 8950 yesterday, but have reopened at 8830. 

Same boat. Only regret is going a bit too heavy and not leaving enough room to add in that little dip to 8700s. We also had some hidden bullish divergences in that retrace. 

I think right now ETH is the one to watch as is about to breakthrough its [ATH log line \(bitfinex\)](https://www.tradingview.com/x/2QppNplq/). Maybe once that push is made BTC will blast 9200. 
> but alts everywhere are skyrocketing.

Skyrocketing to 50% of their prices 3 months ago.
Great call on the 6410 and your 9200 value has been breached as well!
When did you buy in January? Was that your first purchase? (I’m just curious.)
Welcome to the rabbit hole 
one hor less of sleep tonight, sigh....
I'm in a 4x long from 8787 but I'm seriously pessimistic on the smaller and smaller bumps above 9000. If we don't go above 9000 and stay there before the end of [this wedge](https://www.tradingview.com/x/h8NJiobo/) I think I'm going to reduce to 2x.
> BGD

I keep seeing this here. What does it stand for?
I have 1K usd on coinbase. You say I should turn it all into btc now instead of buying a little every few days and at dips?
Care to elaborate?
Volume is deceptive in this market, always has been.
That is just one exchange, and one btc market... Overall, crypto has had a bit of a volume pump these last few weeks

... and people seem to be MAD for the 100x casinos these days
This is literally the only metric I care about right now.  #Bearish
I think the big players are currently in no trading mode, for some reasons. I am not seeing big buys or sell that too often.
This. Every bit of this. My 6.6 long will remain open til we break 11k. At that point we'll have some SERIOUS evaluating to do. I don't see us dumping like last time now that the log line has been decisively breached and I expect it to be support. I don't think we'll shoot straight to 11 tho, I think we'll move sideways at points of resistance to establish them as support. Trying to contain my excitement as I do suffer from battered wife syndrome in this bear market that may after all finally be behind us. 
good to see you back on the long bandwagon!
Nice.  I'm still in my long from $8930.  I also moved my stops to log as I don't want to watch charts.  Gonna let it ride. 
LOL, I've been holding my breath for the last 120 minutes. Not to say we're out of the woods but damn... sooooo close to closing my long at 8820.
I mean the market either does not care about the wedge whatsoever or is operating off the linear wedge only. Slightly better chart than last time, left is log right is lin.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/aqsFOPnG/

It does seem to be respecting the bottom of the triangle consolidation and with the 5 point of contact in play it would suggest a breakout on the next side it touches. Ie. upwards. 

Either way you have a good risk reward defined in either direction now the amount of power behind this much consolidation should provide a large move. Trading a break in either direction would be the play in my book. Trade long a breakout of 9050 or short a breakdown of 8760
Little liquidity in the alt market distorts the true meaning of that number.  But, yeah, that's a bit crazy, especially since it means bitcoin doesn't have 51% market share any longer.
The wedge is broken on the log scale but is supporting on the linear scale at the moment.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/4Ias5Xoe/

Top chart is log, bottom is linear.
Essentially, we could break down from the wedge, finding the bottom line of the triangle for a bounce ? 

Next few days are going to be juicy. 
Great analysis.  The bottom of that triangle is my target! Short till there, then long depending on what the market looks like when we get there. I anticipate another crack at this resistance
I'll rather prefer to see a break up now, I am ready.
a pullback to 8000 then a bounce would make for a pretty nice inverse head & shoulders : https://www.tradingview.com/x/ydc2PJAR/

Curious as to why the $8800 for the stop level

9278 is the 0.236 fib retracement on bfx, failing there could set us back quite a bit, otherwise next target is 11306 (0.382 fib level) with intermediary horizontal resist around 9.7k which would coincide more or less with the 200MA, thus it could be possible we'd see our "needed" pullback from 9.7 to 9.2
Using actual stops this time, or still alarms? I'm using June futures for this (8860 entry), so I'm leaning catastrophic stops at 8720 and alarms just under 8800. 
What do you think about the fact that we did stop here right after going through the log resistance ?
Doesn't this stop look bearish after a breakout ?
Or is this log resistance line not that important anymore.
Your insight is so accurate sometimes it’s startling. 

Good call. 
Upvoted. I've been missing this, actually.

Telegram is just a troll box 
Yes you are right! But the MACD isn't just about the fast and slow lines crossing.  You have to take into account the 0 line.  So, whilst the price has gone up since the bearish cross on the 2 hour we have spent the last 36 hours migrating closer to the 0 line (105ish down to 30ish).  A move over into the negative would signal a price drop, back test it and you'll see.

The 1 hour is resting right on 0 now.  If the price moves lower from here the 1 hour MACD would be in the negative and would indicate a significant drop (6% last time).  This could drag the 2 hour down from 30 towards the 0 line and theres a chance that could cross.  This is how you get cascading moves up and down.
I would be very happy for btc to be back on track but on the other hand I would miss your analysis greatly! If it comes to that, much thanks for your input, i've learned a lot.
You have a great entry. Just set stops fairly close in case of the BGC. I doubt we'd break 9100 and just drip back down. 
Tings are starting to slide, BGD or BRD though I feel its going to be a BRD. BBands are pinching on the hourly and the fact that were stepping outside of the wedge is bearish.
I don't know about that man It doesn't seem like the buyers are mustering for battle the way they were...
Hey Dude, congrats on your gains. but Why did you Sell it all? Why Not just Keep x amount of Coins? i Think that was the mistake.
Most people I know in real life that entered Crypto have nowhere near the gains you've made. You've done really good for yourself and you should be proud. There's no perfect exit, but as long as you look back and think: damn, I did well and made quite some money - you're good.

Proud of you, stranger :) 
Always spread your emotional risk over time by selling percentages into resistance and vice versa into support.
If your cost basis was ~$200 and your exit basis was around $8k, that's a huge win. Never beat yourself up about taking profits when the percentages skew like that.

It is also wise to keep *some* skin in the game, in my opinion, as well as to keep an eye out for what look like new good entry points. But the big thing is, you should feel nothing but good about what has happened, and I offer you my sincere congratulations.
You had a good win, but you should have definitely kept some, even if just a token amount.  Don't beat yourself up.  We are still way down from ATH's.  Make a plan to buy on dips hopefully anticipating a major dip.  If it keeps going, at least you have some skin in the game.  I would try to get at least some back by the end of May.  That's the halfway point to the next halvening.  


Perhaps reading OnlyTheShitAdvice’s posts will make you feel better about not being in the market /s.

Joking aside, it’s hard being an outsider or no-coiner, especially since you have been in it for so long. I can never image not having a coin, it has become a part of my life.
Everyone has a number that they can live with. Be happy you got money to take care of your family. There is a trend of country bans. In the last 2 weeks 3 countries have functionally banned crypto. The future is not known. In a year this all could be banned in almost every country and the liquidity and price go to shit. 

You never know how things will turn out, so just be happy with what you got.
still far away from that mania bull cycle. Not to late to re enter into a small position and build up from here
What's your target, presumably long?

YOLO mode on. 
I think the ascending triangle is a more appropriate formation at this stage, yes
I also think it's an ascending triangle, seeing how the ceiling at 9k holds and buying pressure increasing at every dip

We'll just keep redrawing that diagonal anyway.  It's all about 9k and where ever the hell the upper 8's can hold.  You're new diagonal on that ascending triangle does seem to be the best one for the moment though, but we could just as well invalidate it too without a full breakout at this point.
I've been looking at that newer, less steeply ascending slope and setting more buys at it (around 8860) in case that support is going to be retested soon. 

With that flatter slope and the ascending triangle, I see this as a highly promising setup for a break-through of 9k.

Edit: Btw, the new slope line already has two additional contact points if you extend it further to the left (there it was as resistance, around 12:00 on April 20). 
I don't know why anyone would call that a wedge 
According to the author of that chart, it is now outdated.



[This](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/pmV1uLC7-Bitcoin-Longterm-update/) is his new prediction.
God damn!
this chart is super old, why are u reposting it?
At the moment a magic 8 ball would offer more consistent guidance. I've been asking it if we are going to break 9k and it keeps saying "ask again later"
Jesus, who speaks to your heart.

Nah who the fuck knows. Sometimes I think the moon boys have it right, because they don't have to think they have to scream LAAAAMMMMBOOOOS.
Go enjoy life and come back in 2 or 3 days (i think that should be enough to reach the apex of the wedge, the remaining options should break earlier)
I can relate! Brought my computer with me to the kitchen to make dinner and about burnt it all.

All this really tells you is that the market has spent more time recovering in the last 2.5 weeks than it has continuing the downtrend.

Which is not in the least bit surprising, since 25 of those 12 hour candles make up the period between dumping down to $6,400 from $8,000 and the strong bounce that's brought us to where we are currently. 
Personally I’m out until we break 8.6 or 9.2.
Prepare a vegeta mame to keep you busy
If you have to, I'd open a small long. I think there's more to gain from a long than from a short. I can't see us falling below the log line we been consolidating above of. 
Anything but sitting out.
I have been layering shorts without leverage since 8500, and will add more on 9100 if this does not go down. I think that market will behave similar like in 2014 but with shorter bear period (I hope). 
All the majors overdue for correction but buyer pressure is preventing it!

Seems like the influx is mostly BCashers.
butters/noncoiners exuburence happens at the bottom (6k?). Their capitulation is at new tops/ATHs. So trade accordingly.
https://tensorcharts.com/
https://www.tradingview.com/x/jFTx4R6w/ 

I think that's what you want
You want volume on the y axis so you see volume traded at each price?
The problem with bulls is that they think wherever BTC goes there is accumulation, we had accumulation on 6,5, in 7,5k and now. Does anyone ever think that this is maybe Wyckoff distribution?
or they're distributing. who's to say?
The more we stay just below 9K (and this is just my opinion) the more it feels like we tempt the big guys to cut bait.

There have been two pretty clear accumulation ranges in the past few weeks, and when "they" finished accumulating "they" have been very effective at marking up the price as [/u/arsonbunny explained well with charts here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8dksw2/daily_discussion_friday_april_20_2018/dxphzem/?context=3)

I don't believe in the benevolence of deep crypto pockets, so either the big players have already established the majority of their position (which makes sense to me because of the markup events) and they're just waiting for retail to build enough FOMO, or "they" are accumulating their short positions having knocked the other big guys out.
I really like how you want to be a part of the candle before it starts (if that is to happen) rather then waiting for a confirmation. My objective is identical. 

As for breaking $9,000, I am long for some reasons, I am sure you too have yours. But only time will tell. :)
Sure, but the market obviously doesn't care. At least not yet. 

The market could hover sideways for a few hours and yolo at $9,000 again and still remain below the breakdown point. 

Rising wedges suck pretty hard when buyers get a wild hair up their ass to fomo. 

Every touch of support is a strong buying opportunity, and breaking down past support is just a buying opportunity in disguise.
It's coming....https://www.tradingview.com/x/F8d76qFD/
We're looking for horizontal support to fail. Triangles can extend out indefinitely.
false* break maybe? edit typo
am following that closely too. 
They are pretty good. You can use them as S/R especially on higher timeframes but some work pretty well on timeframes under 4 hour as well. They're also useful to see how much the price deviates from them over the different timeframes. Like when we came down from 20K and we first hit 50D MA it bounced and when we first broke the 100D MA it broke slightly below and bounced above and when we went straight below the 200D MA to 6K it bounced hard and started to trade above it by the next day. They're also useful for watching the crossing on shorter period MA over longer period MAs to help you visualize the changes in momentum. Same can be said for EMAs they just react to the market quicker. They work better when they line up with multiple other trendlines/signals as always

Kraken already went to 9400...  
There are moments alts go crazy when BTC stagnates, there are moments alts stagnate too waiting for BTC to make up its mind, there are moments they go down while BTC is going on a major rally, it's really very hard to predict and I wouldn't trade based on that.

Otoh they have more organic charts, easier to follow simply because there's no-one trading them on high-lev (highest possible is 3.33x on bfx). Would be foolish anyway because 15% flash crashes are not uncommon.

That's the recent frustration with BTC, it used to be simpler, more stable to trade than alts but since the bitmexico infatuation you see dildos everywhere and it's unpredictable, the chart looks shit.

I blame it on gamblers and not on whales/bots.
Could anyone tell me what BGD stands for ? I see that term being used all over the place for a few days
cant confirm this trend. When BTC made that run from 6k to 11,7k alts werent increasing at all. In fact, they were losing satoshi value all over the place. This time however its the straight opposite.

Overall i think this could be a good indicator \(since new money is coming in crypto space\) that this is not another dead cat bounce.
Or it's just a market, looking what has bottomed out. No big buyers manipulating 
That's just your FOMO talking...  It's pretty silly to assume it'll never be below 9k again.
Are you really saying "it will not go below 9.2 again" and did 6 people upvote you in a matter of seconds? Are you an alt account of binaryechoes?
Do you think bitcoin will never, ever EVER go below 9K again? My take is there will be a pullback, and you'll be able to at least buy back in at 8800, even if it's very brief. 

However, FOMO works in mysterious ways. It's hard to say no.
A thing of the past you say?
9k rejected yet again...but I hope you're right in the immediate short term
Did you sleep through 7k? It lasted 12 days...
It depends a bit on how you draw it. I would wait for a more definitive confirmation.
Seeing the same... we wicked below the wedge only for it to be absorbed immediately, and now crawling back in o_0
But tradeable.
unless you're trading this range, then this is heaven. depends on how you look at it. 
USD transaction volume tanking:

I think the hopium comments and overenthusiasm are a great indicator that this is going back down.
I was actually thinking that yesterday. If the dips are being eaten so fast and their are not that many shorts to protect, why not just let the price go up and sell then?
Yeah, it's suspicious. I know people here always say that order books don't mean much, but the ask orders between 
 9k and 9.1k have increased with every try at 9k. 

By the time I get back from work (4/5 Hours) this mofo had better have picked a direction. 
This is exactly what is happening. We are finding the actual price of BTC.
I thought I saw that wrong.

How is that even possible lol 
Damn, I keep meaning to make sure I have stupid high and low orders set on kraken to catch those, because they happen somewhat often on Kraken (every couple/few months).
> How can this run be even close to sustainable without lots of new money entering the market?

There's been a *lot* of old money sitting on the sidelines after having dumped their coins on newbies at prices significantly higher than what we have now. 

Don't need 'new' money if 'old' money now has... more money. 
Zoom out
Conspiracy theory. The truth is how can they "prop up" the price while simultaneously "offloading coins". They can't be selling more coins than they buy while propping up the price.

A better theory is whales accumulating now to sell the coins at $100k. Btw, tether printed like 300 million new coins recently, so there is some new money for you.
The 15m is like tabletop mountain.
Lower highs and higher lows still so still just consolidating?
Stating to doubt the wedge and a breakdown.
You act like this is a natural, organic market.  It is not. And whichever way those who control it want it to go is where it will go
Oddly enough I think now would be the time to short, but it might look retarded in five minutes. $9.2-9.3 was my target to short but all I want to do is long lol 
Stick it in my veins!!!

Based on how long the market has hovered just below it, I'd agree with others who have stated that $10K would be the next target. 

The market hasn't been sitting here consolidating for the past 72 hours just to jump $150 up to $9,200. 

If this breaks up, it should be just as explosive as the previous two breakouts. 
10k is the next stop.  It's the weekly long term moving average.  Breaking through that goes to 12k.  12k confirms an Adam and eve double bottom formation, which typically signals prices are about to rise.  After that, no clue.
I would say 9.2, 5 and then 9.8k before the real deal big boss at 10k
If we successfully break up from ~~$9,000~~ $9,000 - $9,200, I would say $10,000 will be the target.


12k
I'm thinking we at least make it to $9400 if we convincingly break through $9000. If we then don't slip under $9000, it would show strength in the movement. Then I have $10k as midterm target. 
Hard 9250.
quit the web browser and reopen, and check your system clock is correct
And then down? You used to be very besrish. No more?
Will have hard time as shorts are decreasing.

https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSDSHORTS/
dont think we will see such big moves up again in a long time, shit is being repressed/controlled. im guessing we hit 200ma then shit the bed
If we hold above 9.2 I'll be inclined to agree.
Overall agree. Would love to spend 2-3 weeks consolidating around 9k-10k. Somewhat doubt we will and I have zero TA reason to think we will, but it'd actually make me feel more comfortable it's not a DCB than if we just continue smashing through 10k.

I don't really agree that some alts booming is a bad sign for BTC though, I think it speaks somewhat to confidence in the overall market. Most of the "promising" (as in could feasibly work out) alts fell a lot more than BTC so it's understandable for those to recover slightly faster. And it's a speculative/unregulated market so of course there's going to be your shitcoin pumps whenever the market is remotely confident. Also not a fan of the wedge but that's just me.
Great post. Welcome back
When does that candle close? It would be a good sign if we close above it I think.



Then again, I'm just completely blown away by the fact that we haven't a major pullback in two weeks. Where is it, when are we going to see a pullback?
Congrats to you on the profits tho!

I've never really paid attention to the charts aside from the past few weeks - but I can almost "feel" the buying pressure right here if that makes any sense - have there been other instances like this in the past few months/bear market or does this feel singular? 
Keep tabs on [btc transaction charts](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactions.html#3m), [google trend charts](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=bitcoin). They're great indicators on the overall usage of Bitcoin.

For price movement, use [cryptowat.ch](https://cryptowat.ch) and look at BFX + GDAX, as well as any other exchange + trading pair you want to watch.

For mobile apps (Android), I personally like [Bitcoin Chart Widget](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.esstudio.coinwidget). The app is great as a chart interface for mobile. Along with all the other features you'd expect out a crypto price app. There's also Bitcoin Checker, though lately the app has been really screwy as in not updating prices / alerts when it should.

Good luck.

Didn't Bitcoin bounce STRONGLY from 6k to 12k? It hit 6k only briefly, but the alts have mostly flattened out and have slowly started rising. Doesn't seem like the same thing that Bitcoin did.
This is the perfect comment for our new [Altcoin Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8e8qpw/altcoin_discussion_monday_april_23_2018/). :) It applies here too, just letting you know.
This seems to apply mostly to exchanges where bots can function. Many projects on smaller exchanges and DEXs stayed relatively flat through all of this. 
The pump being done by Willybot 2.0 cannot be done as effective on bitcoin. Bitcoin has more liquidity which means it has more inertia. For the same money it takes to move bitcoin 3% a day can be used to move the alts 10-15% a day due to their illiquid market.

What they need is FOMO. FOMO to sell the coins back to someone. And FOMO to create trade volume, which is another method the coordinated exchanges make money is by ensuring the trading gravy train keeps giong on. FOMO only depends on a rising ticker day after day. It doesn't matter what the ticker is. So, that is why alts are were chosen for the pump.


Nobody is euphoric right now, honestly. If you feel differently, I challenge you to show me examples of this sentiment.

But hey, by all means keep borrowing-to-sell along with all the salty, nervous bears who're holding onto underwater shorts. Good luck!
BCH ratio hit 0.5 ATH. Goodluck if you plan to short it or the market as a whole based on the BCH movement.
I was wondering this this morning. I think he may have been banned when lots of the more aggressive posters were banned (dush, gypsy) 
He's been posting all day, but looks like a couple have been modded.
We had a rejection on 21st March too on the way down from the 11.5 double top. Therefore we have had five goes at it.

How many times do you have to knock at a resistance before the market makers decide it’s easier to push the price down than up? Those who have fomo’ed in since the BGD must also be getting impatient too and considering taking profits here.

Personally I’m out now until this shit makes its mind up.
If this is the outcome, then you're not retarded...but the market sure is. 

Particularly Bitmex futures, which are currently trading at -$50 in relation to spot for the June contracts, and equal to spot on the September contracts. 

That's the bargain of the century if traders there ever decide that this isn't just a run-of-the-mill dead cat bounce before further decline.
[removed]
Good analysis. I'm sounding like a broken record at this point, but this is not a good time to short, and if you do, get out at 8880 because it seems like 50 bucks is about as far as the mad market seller can push it down.
I hope we get a chance to see if it's legit.

Personally I think the market should move past $9,200 shortly. I don't plan to close until around $9,800. 
Closed at $9188. Expecting to see a small correction for a better entry point. 
Just curious, do you really want to speculate on 15 min charts? Do you think the current R/R and market uncertainty make it worth trading at such short timeframes? Apologies for not answering your question.
Starting to think this was a pretty good call. Setting a target of ~9400. Let's see how it plays out. 
for me it is a bearish divergence, the line is declining\`?
On the same picture is hidden bullish and regular bearish. Meh, too hard for traders. Guess hidden bullish is more viable here since its the short term trend continuation. If bearish comes in play we can see short term trend reversal
There are rumours (and I think a small amount of evidence) that some account holders are paid to support BCH and sow discourse amongst BTC supporters.
honestly shorting at 8900 or whatever their entry was, wasn't that stupid. It had a 50/50 chance of breaking down they could have just as easily be the ones gloating 
They are idiots for shorting, but not because of the non news events taking place these past few months.
The hourly MACD is what i'm watching.  If we get a bearish cross and it moves into the negative, it will be enough to pull the 2 hour into the negative too.  Could end up with a cascading effect!

https://www.tradingview.com/x/eZS8IEfR/
I'll bite.

Using 62% FIB as a standard for mean reversion, we could drift up to 9.9k without breaking our current bearish pattern.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/cTTfi6a7/

I have been watching for 3 signals to confirm we are no longer in a bear market.  

First, I would like to see us break the major 62% fib from all time high 20k to our local low of 6k.  This would mean breaking 15k.  Not for a while.  I'm not above opening a long before that though, of course.  That would be a big, final confirmation.

The second signal is to break the local 62% fib from weekly level (grey box) and trendline breakout failure @ 11.7k to the local bottom of 6k.  This 62% fib is at 9.9k.  The next major higher high above 9.9k is at 10k, which also is a psychological level.  So to break 10k is confirmation of the second signal.

The third signal is to close a daily candle above the downward trend, which is at a steep, 24 degree angle.  We did that 4 days ago.  This resulted in a lot of excitement among bulls, news articles, etc, and should give us enough buyers to test the 62% fib level at 9.9k.  But only signals relief from bear market, does not signal the end of bear market.

For bears, 8.9-9.9k would be target range for short entry.
I accept that with the caveat that if it does bull trap significantly that the price is going to search for new lows. Sentiment can change quickly, as we've seen, so if momentum is lost at a crucial junction then expect cascading sell-offs, with only a handful of horizontal supports. Given that we're hardly pulling back between green dildos, it's hard to not see the parallels to May 2014. 
Don't be delusional is good advice in general
Personally would have waited for a breakdown of 8700, or even 8800. The selling isn't that impressive either to be fair. 
I'm looking for a BRD! that would help me to feel more confident about going all in here. I think if we're going to break 9k we need a pullback to let everyone else that is expecting a pullback get in. 
I believe it will take a big market buy/sell to push this thing one way or the other. It's pretty clear that even though buying pressure/interest is a lot higher than before, it's not still enough to drive the market. Buy the dips to scalp is ok, more than that and people still are afraid of a pullback (it's normal since half the people here are preaching for a pullback)


You and me both.  Really thought we'd be hanging out over 9k by now.
Eh, we need to get and stay over 9000 first. Seems hard enough right now.


Yes, around there. Pushing convincingly through 9200 could lead to a major run.
This has nothing to do with Bitcoin. BCH is getting pumped and it drags BTC and ETH along with it.

However, BCH is overpriced as balls and *someone* is going to take their winnings. It'll drop BTC back to the 8.8's or 8.7's when they do sell.
If they both go up 10% in terms of USD, then (not including exchange fees) it doesn’t matter how many times you trade between BTC and ETH, in the end you’ll still be up 10% in USD. That’s because in such a case the BTC/ETH rate would stay exactly the same. 
Your USD value is still up 10%, but you didn't make anything on the trade, just on what you're holding. 

For instance, I took out a small short on the BCH ratio, not because I think BCH is necessarily going down, but because I think BTC may pump and cool down the ratio. This was more of a "wtf BCH" trade than anything else, though. 
Alt resurgence across the board, which we didn't see with the other DCBs.
Stressful isn't it?
Well, the cat is clearly still alive and kicking. When BTC goes flat for a while, the next move is normally up.

Lots of reasons to be optimistic. We just survived a brutal three-month attack.
Why would you long resistance?
RIP :(

Here comes the big red dildo

I'm sure 9k will eventually break sometime in the next 18 months though
[removed]
Sell resistance, buy support!

EDIT: I agree with this trade.  There is a lot of selling going on here, hence we've been here for days without breaking through.  IMO if you are buying before such a significant resistance you are asking to be whale food.
It never left the wedge the way i have it. Need to get lower than 8870 (bitfinex) to leave the wedge (My wedge comes from the pump from 6800).
And with such a big pattern, it needs to break with volume and stay out of the pattern for a while, otherwise could just be a fake out.
Probably a terrible idea if you’re not confident about it.

But If I never hit on a 16 on blackjack when the dealer flopped 2 face cards, I wouldn’t have made money. 

Risk it to biscuit. 
So we shouldn't short the top of the range if bitcoin fails to break through? Got it.

You mean long squeeze? 
What does BGD stand for?

edit: oh it must be big green dildo
> Certainly won't be shorting however cos the BGD dispenser could have other plans.

Yes, I think this very thing makes the market untradeable in this price band. There is a stalemate in effect and it could be the only thing that breaks it is a large market order, which could be in any direction.
I closed my long from 8280 at 8950 yesterday, but scaled back in fully at 8850. I'm holding a short of 50% of it's value at 8950, though, with adds up to 9200. A retrace to 8650 (6-month log line, maybe invalid now due to support turning resistance turning support), or the ATH log line which will hopefully be support at about 8400. 

This feels kind of last a few days ago when alts pumped like mad and then BTC followed while the ratios dropped. I may be a smidge crazy but I also shorted the BCH ratio at .16 (just 1 @ 10x for fun).
It went down a lot. No more to sell
Oh please, plenty of shitcoins are up, don't try to find rationality in this market, especially with alts
Would that make you a regular? 
Lurking everyday. But since I look at larger timeframes usually I'll only post something every couple of weeks.
Nobody goes broke taking profit.
Be careful revenge trading, just make sure you're doing it because the market conditions are right, not because you want to make your money back. 
You could set a stop for breakeven if you're hoping this could be the big long to take you to riches but there is a really possibility this was the local top. I know a lot of respected traders in this sub expect us to cruise by 9.2 because of the drawn out battle for 9k but just about every short from <9k had their stop loss here so this could be nothing more than a stop loss hunt before the much needed correction.
[removed]
I don't get it, you don't even have to draw the line, the price dotted line does it for you, but most people seem to be ignoring the very clear ascending triangle there... 

And the bull pennant we are in. 

Even if the wedge breaks down the bull penant can surely pick us. 
Why would buying pressure dry up? One out of 20 people owns Bitcoin at this poing, and most of them are deep in the black.  Old timers are going to keep buying, and new timers are being added every day.  The only thing that will dry up is the supply of coins being dumped for no other reason than to drive the price down. 

Just my opinion based on supply and demand.  Here we have limited supply and demand that is only growing.
No its bullish. All TA and signs point to that. What is wrong with you perma bears?
I think the main reason you are getting down voted, even tho I agree with the fact it is manipulated, is that this is pure conjecture. There's no reason to believe we need any retail at all at this level to move higher. I saw a tweet from a guy who runs a BTC company in SF who said he was heading to saudi arabia to negotiate an OTC purchase of $2B worth of BTC. There are hedge funds and billionaires in every country around the world who want a piece of this market. A single large buyer takes the place of hundreds or even millions of retail buyers.  I don't think we need any retail buying at this level to move higher. 
LBC has shown stable volume for 12 weeks. We oversold and hit a double bottom. Now we go up.
While I don't think you're necessarily "wrong", I think you're marginalizing/discounting the effects of things like:

* Robinhood launching their crypto offering.
* The Rothschilds/Rockefellers/Soros/etc. publicly stating they are/will be entering the market.
* Goldman purchasing a crypto exchange and hiring traders to staff their new prop desks.
* LocalBitcoins volume at ATH in several jurisdictions.

This is precisely the type of "new money" that has the potential to move the market like this.

Is the bear market over? Hard to say, but if I was a betting man (and I am), I'd bet the bottom got put in when we spent a week and a half in the mid-$6,000's, after a 60%+ correction from the peak.
Again, getting downvotes because you're not hot and heavy to long btc.  The silent bulltards strike again.  

To your point, 100% agree.  VOLUME still sucks.  Either retail or institutional money needs to come in, or whale bears will bleed the leveraged gamblers dry.
[removed]
Here's the problem with comments like this. All the money plumbers and MLM moms and Uber drivers and insurance salesmen lost during the mania peak, is still 'in' -- it's not as if the 'smart money' that sold their coins back in January is completely leaving the market. All that money taken from newbs is going to find its way back eventually, and in a way that'll be sure to create another wave of FOMO and lure more newbies back in and repeat the whole process again. 
For now I see a bullish continuation pattern so I wouldn't stress too much. I'm normally not enclined to open a long below a resistance but I did here, looks ok to me. 9.2 -> 9.7-9.8
There's been a lot of discussion about this over the last few months. Do a full text search for 2014 in our current and past daily discussions.

Not really. You can see what people are thinking by just reading the thread. 
It hit 664 so pretty much there
I think the constant cries of "manipulation!" are so prevalent, because all of the ingredients are there for it to take place:

1. Volatile market with low liquidity: check
2. Unregulated (pump and dump or insider trade to your heart's content): check
3. 24/7 trading cycle (allows for movements to be timed when other major players are sleeping/commuting): check 
4. Poor asset distribution (early adopters/miners have a disproportionate amount of btc): check

It's pretty clear that the market *can* be manipulated under the right circumstances. So many here assume that it happens on a daily or even hourly basis. Some are pretty convinced that practically nothing happens that isn't pre-ordained by "they."
well, there was the whole btcd dude who sold ill gotten coins during the bear market.

it just takes time.

Panama papers was years in the making.

Also, no one of any importance actually gives a crap about Bitcoin price manipulation 
There are conspiracies in the UN? News to me.
Well, there was the Willy bot. 
Why not ride the long to 9.7? No way this is breaking down now.
move a stop loss to cover 9k or something, this volatile market will give you new opportunities
If there has been a reversal that's not necessarily true. Granted, I refuse to call this a bull market without volume and without going above 11.7k
This seems like the right thing to do - but I think the past week or so has taught us not to underestimate the market.

Belongs in alt daily.

The order book on the other side is STACKED

Unless a whale swing their dick with a 1000+BTC buy, 9k is not going to be broken with any sort of conviction
Not really.  The price is moving up in steps with a few big buyers. Otherwise it trades sideways.  These could just as easily be bear flags if the very few big players sold instead.
Further to the right
Using previous breakouts above a log resistance line as guides, somewhere between $12,000 and $14,000.
$8928
[Price after log break in the last two bubbles](https://www.tradingview.com/x/E1oofjDS/)
$10,000
If you scroll down below, I think you will find a very good idea yourself.
Half people wanting to catch the bull run half people wanting to unload their bags at a higher price point. So no one is selling. it'll cascade downwards very quickly when it finally corrects a bit 
I guess the fact that 8600 downtrendline was broken through and held up for a few days
Someone with money, or a group of people with money, had a sudden impulse to buy.  No news is required.  Unless you can predict people impulses, you can't predict individual market moves.  
> After weeks of sideways, what has caused this pump over the last couple of days?

Huh? I week ago the price was $1000 lower. A week before that $1500 more. Hardly sideways.

The last couple days, until just this past couple hours, was sideways however.
You might feel more at home in our new [Altcoins Discussion Thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8e8qpw/altcoin_discussion_monday_april_23_2018/?sort=new)
That's called a bubble. There will be more. 
Sideways is ok. Let the RSI cool off a bit before the next leg up.
The move up has to be convincing to other buyers, which I don't think this one is at this moment hovering just below 9.2k
Well I right off the bat we've been looking at some of the lowest 24 hour volume in a while and BTC has been moving up pretty steadily. 
You do not get charged more if you close before June. 

Your position will settle in June and be closed automatically. You cannot keep it open longer. 
I don't see any evidence of that happening here: https://cash.coin.dance/blocks

I still hold almost 1:1 Bcash to Bitcoin but my reasons initially were a hedge. I can't help but think that the longer bcash doesn't win, the less relevance it has. They keep selling it's strength as a payment but I just don't see the value there. There's just no need for another bitcoin. 
You posting this again for a reason? Just had to share with everyone your crazy thoughts and upcoming actions?
I expect you to be in crypto for many more years then
This has been the least threatening bcash pump yet. Roger pumped it to 0.50 back in Nov.

All it takes is a whale to push it to 9200 and hold it there a while and i bet a retrace won't appear before 9k8 or 10k and in that case it may only go down to 9k.
Disclaimer:  i have an underwater short
That's a good short, just not sure what you're target was. I know it would've been a small win, but I would've closed it last night in the 8.7s

Reason being because at best your short was going to get down to 8.6 at the log line turned support imo, and at worst it would bounce back to her and break 9k and you'd be underwater.

Again, this is my problem with trading every position, not ever position is a tradable one. I'm still long from 6.6 waiting to see if we fall below 8.6 then I'd open a short. If not I'm long to 11.7 for a nice big trade. 
Of course will be a retrace at some point.  But could be $10K.
We dipped into the 87xx range yesterday off of 9000. How much more retrace are you looking for? 
9.2k got rejected on GDAX, 50% of the Wall was eaten but then shot down

Sure, but most will be dumped directly for BTC and have no effect on price other than down when people want to get back into fiat. That’s the whole idea behind the alt pumps, accumulate big bags of BTC without effecting the price of the actual asset at all. 
Oh, don't worry. It's gonna be poked. Big, smart money is now in the game, and I'm not talking about those clowns back in Jan-March.

Locking in fiat value. For example: Lets say 1000 bitcoins in cold storage worth $10mm. By shorting $10mm, you would ensure that you always have $10mm worth of bitcoin, no matter how the price moves. If the price of Bitcoin moves up 20%, you will lose 200 bitcoins to the short, but your remaining 800 bitcoins will still be worth $10mm. Give or take. 
hes maintaining Fiat value of his holdings while losing BTC
Rule 3: if you're making an assertion like this please put in the leg work to validate it and show evidence for your claims.

When there are no coins for sale at 9000 anymore?
When there's no more dips, people will have to buy up up up
We had no exchanges to begin with, and websites that operate in crypto are based outside Iran. The ban is old news, official exchange offices and financial institutions are not allowed to provide crypto related services. They have no way to identify which transactions/payment gateways are crypto related, trust me, I'm an Iranian and live in Iran.

 OTC market and websites are thriving here, as IRR is depreciating rapidly and owning more than 10,000 USD in cash was made illegal in recent dollar crack down. Guess what alternative is becoming increasingly popular.
I replied to you earlier regarding you harping on India, now let's have fun with Iranian stats!

The median income for an entire household in Iran is $885.00 /mo according to a recent Aljazeera article, with 24 million of its approximately 72 million people living below the poverty line. While it sucks when any country or institution makes it more difficult to buy cryptocurrency, get real, this makes little difference to crypto markets.
keep trying perma bear, load up those shorts.
i m sure if i google a copypaste from that i article i will find it was published in 2013-2014. Plus since when Iran (and North Korea) allow their citizens to send foreign currencies outside ?
I don't get why people thinks the earth orbits the sun. We just move in ellipses around it . 
Its like you answered the question for yourself. Just as the bearmarket started with massive dumps the reverseal will start with massive pumps. How is it so hard to understand that people who sold on the way down from 20k and still have a large stack left are going to spend their money to get this fucker back up again?

Thank you for reaffirming that statement. 
It's just a single whale listening to techno.
The spikes aren't particularly weird when you assign some psychology to the market.

Buyers aren't fomoing in this range because they're hoping to sell $300 higher. 

They're buying every dip because they believe (either correctly or misguidedly) that the bear market is over and a new bull run has already started. 

A buy at $8,850 or $9,000 is completely irrelevant if your mindset is that you'll be able to sell at $20K+ in a few months. Or hell, even weeks. 

They don't want to get caught holding the bag if they're wrong...but they are afraid of missing out on profits even more than they're afraid of being left holding the bag. 

I mean, even I'm doing it...and I presumably know better. 
You're in panic-mode?
Hey, you appear to be butt posting. :)
It took bitcoin years to reach the value Dentacoin has now too. What's your point?
It is what it is.  I felt good dumping it for 4K when it hit gdax.  Let’s see how long it takes to get back to that level, if ever.
2 contact points for the wedge support is a bit dodge. Especially considering how recent the second point is
Yup, watching the same lines.

> stop buy at +-8225

9225 I assume
Maximum FOMO potential would mean a move by mm's at or around 23:00 UTC, Europe is drinking cocoa, East and West coast are running and Asia are getting up.
What a pointless, speculative question. 9K is the ceiling, until we break it. The only tangible ceiling we had to work with was the downtrend log line. Are you just looking for spitball conjecture? /r/cryptocurrency is that way
The sky is the limit 
What bull run?
Good lord that's a heck of a climb by ETH. I'll keep an eye there. 
Thanks! We're not out of the wedge yet, but I'm not looking to stand in front of this thing at this point. This pump is going crazy.
I don't remember. I started buying at the end of november just before the big run from 12-20K. In january I had most of my positions and only moved some alts around. 

What about you?
You must be new.

Well i was asking other people opinions.

But what i was thinking is that some big players are propping the price to certain level's so they can unload for another round some coins. 

Or my 2nd thought people are more scared to buy or sell coins and cause lower volume.
Not worried, as the price hasnt really moved either way. No low volume pumps or dumps either yet.
Yes its true that its only one exchange, but finex is one of the exchanges with high or highest volume, so its a good indicator to see whats going on. And those latest pump had barely any good reason to pump in my eyes.. 
The bounce off that dump was absurd and goes against everything I know and believe about technical analysis. 

While rising wedges aren't the best performing patterns in the playbook, I'm not sure I've ever seen one break down and break back in so abruptly before. 
I am long from $8,955 lol. Had a wrong entry this morning. Lets ride!
Entry?
A, but im working with a different bigger wedge. 

Besides, it broke down without dump or any significative effect on the RSI, so i say that wedge wasn't valid to begin with.
Or we could break up from the pennant. Two very bullish scenarios. 
well,im quite happy with the good old A&E there, don't need more reversal patterns.
The market is on the edge of a knife hovering at these levels. BBands are super tight on the 1h and 2h, and the lower band for each is roughly around $8,800.

If the next move is down rather than up, I'll want to cut it sooner rather than later.
actual stops. Won't have the luxury of closing at my leisure thanks to Bitmex's server lag.
There's nothing inherently bearish about stalling following the breakout.

There'd be nothing particularly bearish about a moderate correction here either that drops to the $8,500 area. 

Ideally you want to see the market confirm resistance-turned-support by dropping back to the line. If the market zooms right through it and never circles back to confirm it as support, you run into a scenario where there's limited faith in the rally. When it reaches a strong resistance zone, let's say $10,000 or $11,700, there's nothing propping the market up but fomo. 

That's when you potentially see a massive correction that *finally* confirms resistance-turned-support. But by that time, the support line might be much farther down than it is now (since it's a descending line). Maybe all the way back at $6,000 by that time.
I actually flip flopped a few times today and wound up closing this position at $8,900 and then reopening it at $8,870.

Unfortunately, for now, it's a private one (I built it myself, fed with data every 10 minutes from CoinMarketCap.com).

Re: log-scale Y-axis... I can toggle that. Not at my desk atm, but will share when I get back. Hang tight.
Hey Essexal , just a heads up this; looks like it might play out.

EDIT: 1hour MACD crossing now.
Thanks. I think I'll stop around 9075 if it blows.
Thanks. After selling some I had a kind of therapeutic relief which made me realize how burned out I felt. Then I decided to take a full break from this market. Like a detox I guess. 
I never understood selling 100% either.  I am a HODLer since 2013 myself.  I have never sold ever and keep buying more of it (and spend on the up sometimes).

Okay, lol. Where can I read more about this?

They're forking their fork because...why?
I'm just used to seeing small caps double or triple then fall back to initial price, but multi-billion cap coins it's a little unnerving :p
OP doesn't have the top line drawn in. [This](https://www.tradingview.com/x/JbNP3ukt) is the wedge, which has already broken down unless you redraw it. It should probably be redrawn or drawn as something else though because not much happened when it broke the uptrend.
Seems to have bounced perfectly!
The bullish case looks really similar and equally good for me!
Because:

1) Why not?

2) Many people follows it since a long time ago. It's a classic that has been the closest to a long time prediction that we've had.
it just replied no to me... i'm all in short
Oh. No biggie then. Just ask again later. Wish I had someone mentoring me.
The whole computer?
I’m assuming you still haven’t eaten with the latest price action that’s occurring in the past 20 minutes. 
I take my laptop with me to the toilet whenever I to unload my inner stock. lol.
I mean, Im not completely gone. Just sold a bunch. Gonna take a break from trading
go ahead. try me
lol
I will admit that it is somewhat saw a sight for sore eyes that bitcoin is kind of chilling around the 9K region personally the old stone interest me much I guess they can pump or not but I do have to admit that there hasn’t been any significant manipulation since we got out of the log trendline
Honestly, what are you trying to achieve at the moment?
[removed]
Wow that is impressive! 
Yes. The article says the new hire should "explore" the opening of a bitcoin trading desk, but since they in fact already do clear bitcoin trades for some customers, it's pretty clear where this is going.
fees and slippage
33, thanks ;\)
I believe we are going down much harder and deeper than that. Will wait until sub 8k.
Depends on the leverage.  Between 100k - 10 million.
minimum $100k at 100x leverage. I'd guess it's 50x cause 100x is just retard status so probably $200k at least. 
There isn't any small amount, regardless of the leverage.

Those few big liquidations freeze up their system in order to order match the other side, but mex loves them market orders.
8 figure contracts are hard for me to even fathom.  
Yep, and they came with a voting brigade.
I think at ATH/top their activity will go way down. If we're going up and they feel threatened, they will come here to FUD. 
That is fucking great, thanks for sharing. How did I not know about this? The scripting option is really cool, and the historical orderbook.
Holy shit! That's amazing. Thank you. <3
Exactly the whale(s) could be selling off at 9k, once the buy pressure fades then you will see the dumping. 
Thanks for linking back, I'd missed it. But don't forget that hidden, iceberg and scaled orders don't show up in this kind of analysis, which is nonetheless of great interest and value. 

That's not the ONLY reason I'm long. I don't think we're overbought yet for a bunch of reasons. I really only trade daily/weekly charts
Was that a dry heave fakeout about 15 minutes ago?
is that a camel?
Picasso, so nice to meet you. 
Surely not the pukey camel!


Lol you mean the bull is coming or the bear is coming?
Nice TA
Well something happened when we passed that rising support
horizontal support being 8500?
I watched a lot of 100 BTC or so buy walls get deployed to buy that dip right up.  So I would not be surprised if we see a bounce here, or at 8600.  I know I'm buying the dips, as I don't think the whales are done with their BGDs yet :)
I have absolutely no idea how to effectively trade this formation. So I'm going to stay away from it. 

The floor for immediate downside should be at or around $8,500. So there's little to be gained from shorting it. 

It's obviously retarded to open a long here as well. 

Setting limit orders in the $8,500 to $8,550 range might be worthwhile, but that's generally not my style.
Thanks. I'm still struggling with how much weight to give them at times. I guess it's just like anything else, sometimes reliable, sometimes not...but still useful to paint a more complete picture.  
Did it hold? 
I think margin trading has really killed bitcoin price movement. If it goes up, it's shorted. If it goes down, it's longed. Exchanges are making a fortune out of the liquidated margins. Betting against the house, that's crazy.
Can we stop using this term before it's too late? It's a pain to read, you always need to stop to look for that letter in between to decide if it's green or red.

Any evidence of new money coming in? How do you know it's not tethered investors buying back into BTC/Alts? I'm leaning towards this scenario because whenever Binance BTC/USDT has a ~1% premium an altcoin rally follows. 
It's a recent trend, started before that legendary BGD that propelled BTC 1000usd over half an hour. Since then it's repeating. Not a bad thing IMO, it's reviving the market.
This is fairy tale do not listen to this person. On run to 11,5 alts recovered by 100%, similar like at this moment
At some point it was never below $100 again.
They did... And ya I'm thinking sub 9k will be difficult henceforth since it will mean a fundamental break in the bull season... I had bought in at around 7.5k and sold around 8.3k... I don't think I can see those entry prices again unless something big goes down 
I mean it's v possible he won't get to enter until after we get rejected from $12k or he won't get to enter below $9k for a very, very long time. 
Statistically? Anything is possible.... We are after all going by educated guesses here, right? 
Previous bubble bursts have shown that we can trudge above the previous downtrend line for a while. Considering how low volume is overall I'd say this is plausible.
Sale is on, my friend 😁
How big is this wedge you're drawing? Does it only contain the price action since the pump from $8,500, or does it go back farther?
True, but I suck ass at stops, and I hate getting stop hunted. I guess that makes it a personal whinge, because trading a sideways market can be pretty unforgiving. 
These data show it going sideways for 8 weeks.
Also, that data was only for the United States. Here's the link for global data:

https://anacoinda.github.io/localbitcoins/all.html
Hopium? Gimme some of what your smoking. All I see are bear carcass and bullish FOMO buying driving the price up since the bottom. 
Price suppression and accumulation?
And a new generation of strong hands. Like what we gathered in 2013. 
I am glad to be part of it during this stage of its life cycle. One minute charts look like heartbeats since we crossed log resistance, which I perceive as a very good sign.
impossible to stop buy with this liquidity. I almost put a stop buy at 8225 and I would have been fucked! 
Under this theory, the FOMO is propping up the price and the whales are selling into it, allowing them to offload their cheaply accumulated coins to the new/re-entrants without tanking the price. If the BGDs up to this point have been comprised mostly of wash trading, then I can see how this would be a profitable strategy.

I guess the question is, if this is true, where does a market maker go from here? They have a lot of money and no coins. Sounds bullish.
Prop up price on exchanges, offload large amounts OTC.  Kind of simple.
With giant buy walls.

And by offloading OTC instead of on the exchanges. 
If we break the top bband on the 15 things are gonna get real spicy
When it goes, it's going to be spectacular. 
I think if this were going to dump hard, it would have done it yesterday... moving sideways allows RSI to cool off, and buyers seem to be in "buy the dip" mode which, in my mind, is putting us in a better and better position for another leg up.

Whales don't have granular control over the market at all times... if they did the charts would be a square wave minute to minute with prices fluctuating between 0 and then $10^15

Let's step that extreme analogy back a bit... big players can move markets just like your hand across a pool of bath water creates a large wave and, along with it, a subsequent cascade of ripples as sub waves bounce and intersect.  The contingent players in the market are all acting or reacting to these large waves - both reinforcing each other and canceling each out out.  This complex system is what we're all trading - whales or no whales - we're all surfing this same water.  

Lastly, what is "organic"?  If the entire market were composed of players with exactly 1 BTC doing their best to trade, the coin distribution would quickly find parity with the current environment as more skilled players extracted coins from those less skilled.  Even an ocean full of tiny plankton eventually congeals into a handful of giant whales.  Always.

[This best demonstrated mathematically by the Pareto distribution, which is found throughout all of nature, economics and social psychology.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution)
natural and organic belong on food labels. They have no meaning here. Do you have a conspiracy that one person controls the market or their a larger cabal conspiring together? 

Okay, if there was no "they" controlling it, how do you propose the market would look?
> natural, organic market.

and gluten free
I agree but just couldn't afford it going farther up. Not in a good headspace for making any decisions
You want to short here?? I don't know if I'd risk shorting before 9.4. And you know everyone has their sights set on 10 now.
Do we all really think Ver himself is doing this lol? Or is it just a term used for bitcoin cash advocates?
> If this breaks up, it should be just as explosive as the previous two breakouts.

If it breaks down?
I think the real big boss is 11.7, then and only then will I not wait for the rug to be pulled under me. 
Bullish short term, a bit unsure in the long term

 I think the goal is to get above $10K and then drop down to $10K to have it as a support line during which the main selling will start happening

long term I won't turn proper bullish until we get above $12K 
Oh good, you're still here. Place wouldn't be the same without you. 
That's just Bitfinex, though. More volatile margin positions are being built (to be fair, in both directions) on Bitmex and OKEX.


this is the daily, so unfortunately not for another 21 hours :\^)
Hmm so it will be a fork of the fork.

He's comparing BCH movement to BTC movement. Should be fine as far as the mods are concerned.
There are a lot of people saying they 'feel' the buying pressure is higher. If I was to offer a rationale for this, it's that the last few months of bear market have meant that when a resistance has been touched \(normally the log downtrend but others too\) and it was rejected the price would dump *hard* when it failed to breach it.

The continual attempts at 9k these last few days are the opposite of that. Even when it's rejected the dump is barely noticeable, and a great number of people here and elsewhere are convinced it'll recover swiftly. And as a self fulfilling prophecy, it does. 

If I was painting the line in an attempt to form a market wide bull run \(as a hypothetical mega whale/whale collective\) this is the sort of price action I'd try to generate. Resilience. A sense that it won't drop even when it does/should. A sense of buying pressure.
There were parts of the runup from the 5.8 bottom that felt like this. I recall the last push from 10kish to the 11.7 top feeling similar.
I noticed that also with checker, thank you for chart widget
That's my secret cap. I'm *always* awake. 
> Surely this can't "end" with BNB being worth more than AMAZ. Surely.

Ya, and BTC is totally worth 100x more than Amazon and Google combined. Why are you trying to apply any sort of value logic here?
oh I see your point yes 
Chosen by whom?
It's a short with a stop $100, when we're overbought as shit and the entire market has pumped like mad for the last 2 weeks. Not sure how this is a bad R/R trade
Dush got perma banned?? 
It's been a little quiet in here. Haha I guess that's why. Damn... 
Chad is still in town though!
Understandable haha 
That's fair. I think those attempts are far enough back and eclipsed by the breaking of the downward log channel that the market is 'ignoring' those attempts if this counting concept has any legs.

I'd suggest market makers \(if that's what is occurring\) might be inclined to push it up more if they don't want a multi year bear market. A simple explanation for that is that they also have huge stacks, rather than just fishing for shorts and longs. 

I don't think the FOMO'ers will be getting impatient yet. If it dumps down to 8.5k then I could see that happening. But the fact it hasn't 8.6k since the first recent attempt \(then 8.8k and 8.75k\) just doesn't have me convinced that a significant dump is coming. 

65/35 up/down at the 'mo. I haven't taken a position, but I'm in BTC not FIAT. What price points will you be looking for?
I see no reason to get impatient, if it really had to go down it would have done so. I expect MMS to wait for the whole US to be awake to benefit from additional FOMO, so give it a few hours.
i remember okcoin quarts trading at 10-15% discount when we were in 700-900. That was the bargain of the century. Yes, futures are too stubborn now.
I decided to 3x long June futures at 8850 with half the trading stack. I'll add the rest at the log line if we drop there. I'm tired of getting chopped up trying to time these candles, especially with the mex engine being so unreliable. 
There’s definitely more upside to longing than shorting here. 

Short: Bottom would most likely be 8750 where it would just bounce like it has been previously 

Long: Break through 9k / 9.2k and engage fomo and who knows where it would go 
Things are heating up now... this is tense
8880 is also where the newer, less steep ascending slope (green in chart below) currently sits. I'd assume at least some support there with or without our green wall spoofy.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/cp2bBfcv/


You do expect a correction, still, right? Curious why the fomo is so strong now.
yup still holding long from $8100.
Are you playing this out like your short from 8350 last week? 

Ride it out as long as it will go, and will close break even if need be? 
What are you seeing at 9800? Not seeing an obvious resistance line.
It's a good question. I tend to use 1h charts (which is also arguably a very small timeframe as well) but it was easier to draw on the 15 min charts. But I find that TA can work on smaller timeframes as long as it is not invalidated by a different pattern on a larger timeframe. I can't see a pattern on a larger timeframe that would invalidate this possible bull flag, except *maybe* the rising wedge.


Then again, I'm probably just seeing things and having delusions of hopium.
price is making a higher low and RSI a lower low, so hidden bullish div, generally occurs during retracement in an uptrend.

https://www.babypips.com/learn/forex/divergence-cheat-sheet
It's definitely hidden bullish divergence! Price makes a higher low, oscillator makes a lower low.  Wether it's valid or not is hard to say.
BCH propaganda actually sounds very convincing for someone who is new to all this as I’ve experienced first hand. 
Until you realize that the whole point of bitcoin is that one entity cannot shove their agenda down your throat.  
Sounds good, where can i apply?
How do you get 50/50? Bitcoin has generally increased in price in the last couple years, so aren't the odds typically slightly against shorts?
You are the bomb. Great post, keep us bulls in check. 
[removed]
No doubt. We break below 8.5 in a bull trap and I'm shorting this shit all the way to 4k.

With that said, I believe we've reversed if you made me choose. Either way, key is to not get rekt on our way to either 12 or 4.
Trouble is that if you are delusional, by definition you don’t know it haha 
I had the option to take a $20 per btc loss on my position or wait until I had to take a $120 to $220 per btc loss on my position.

I chose the former. 

I will reassess if $9,000 breaks conclusively, but it's certainly not looking like that's going to happen today.
We think of ourselves and how we are going to make money. I do for certain.
It may help as a trigger definitely. 
haha. Sometimes good things don't come as you expect them to. 

Hold on until it is possible for you two.
Thank you
Why do you think this is BCH pulling BTC up, and not BCH overreacting to BTC's rise (like many alts do)? Also, there has been a lot of positive things playing out with BCH over the last few months. 
> Alt resurgence across the board, which we didn't see with the other DCBs.

Remember how that went in Jan?
If you believe on that being a breakout
I'm not sure why you're being downvoted...this is now a quintuple/sextuple top at 9k (4hr view) - I just hope it doesn't savagely plow down 10% from here

Such a shame, i really do believe that BTC has better fundamentals than 99% of the shitcoins that have effectively doubled their price in the past week :s
I see some chances of it breaking upwards, may be not. I will close this position if get to $8,800 range.
Wall of downvotes
May be still too early to expect a BRD?

I'd wait out for the breakout confirmation >9.3k if you're not in position.


Sorry was away. In my opinion, slightly higher, perhaps 9.3 should be okay as it should give us a close to clear indication.

On the side note, I need to learn how to place stop buy orders at Finex. 
Long click on the 4th icon down from the top left - it probably looks like a pitch fork. Then go down the list to about half way to find fib retracement.
I meant if you remove the short squeeze from 12th April. I'm wondering if it's effect was two-fold - the actual price increase and also a psychological boost to get people buying. Without both, the price may have increased far more gradually. Perhaps along the lower support line I drew.
He means the short squeeze since 6.8k, meaning that without it 8k could be our organic non-GMO price.
Yep, the green bar that just presented itself.
1 shitpost a day and 1 x 24 hour ban.
Since I stopped coming here for several weeks, now that I’m lurking again I noticed that everyone is trying to trade every couple of hours. They’re commenting on $100 price moves and getting excited over wedges on the 5min charts. You just can’t trade that, I don’t see how it works. I think the addiction to the game overrides any sense of making only +EV trades. 
I revenge traded last week and took a decent loss to my stack.

Slowly just trying to build my money back with good entries.

Thanks slop
Bitcoin/crypto remains a niche product with real but limited uses. A lot of sellers at this range were heavily invested before it was trendy, and know just how euphoric and in denial this market still is. There's also the inflation from mining rewards to take into account, and the dilution of capital across alt-coins. Not to mention reticence about investing in a market that has been bullish for years beforehand and has, relatively speaking, begun normalizing downward. 
That is an interesting indicator. I'm not sure if LBC can paint the whole picture, but it at least shows one group has had consistent demand. 
All due respect but we spent about 11 days total in the 6000's.
I am a construction guy, which fits his profile of all the regular joes who supposedly got burned. Second bear market for me with paper swings that make your butt pucker. Am I out? Am I not buying? Hell no.

Actually started buying right around this level on this bear down and down to 6.8. Swing trading has been meh, but I got more now than I did in 2014, so the portrayal of people buying in, and then noping out forever after a drop, is IMO the opposite of what really happens. I think most people get hooked.
Not okay.

but I never got an answer to what a non-manipulated market is. It's a bit like saying that a animal is doing  when it wins a fight with a challenger . Well them market is the market and contains itself,  so either  you accept that and trade on it or not
so this shows my point, the things that happens is more or less known

Willy bot... not the idea I have in my head I'm assuming.

Edit: right, the mt.gox trading bot. Sorry had a brain fart.
9.4+ and 9.8+ have both been major resistance zones. We are overbought across the board, have been rising on lowish volume, and scraping or bursting through the mid-level Bollinger Bands, and are doing this all in response to almost no real news. I'm not sure, but this seems like a temporary point to go backward.
Can you please elaborate, this is not about trading alts but how the overall aggregate altcoin prices may affect BTC/USD?
Whales that are found in both Northern and Southern hemisphere never meet or breed together. Their migration is timed so that they are never in breeding areas at the same time.
But the people who buy at that price will probably want to sell higher so...

did you close your short or are you adding to it?
Do you think now would be a good time to sell? Not sure how much buy pressure is behind this, but it's rising a bit too quickly for me to be comfortable with it sticking. But then again it's Bitcoin, who knows.
OMG I can see why you guys were so  iffy about setting this up now...

Yes but not for a few months, that last one hurt. We should be in slow growth for a while and I'd like to make a geuss where that is.
It always seems the gains drift back down and buy side fills backs up and it's back to square one. Debating whether I should stop loss at 9100. I'm long from 89xx.

Edit: I understand about RSI but sell pressure is not gonna take a break here.
Ok, thanks. 
You pay a settlement fee, which I think it a bit less than a regular taker fee on most contracts but it's obviously more than the negative rebate you get for making the book.
Also used to have BCH as a hedge. Inadvertently ended up increasing my BTC stack by selling it for BTC when the sat value was good. I don't see the value of holding BCH as a hedge when the TX issue is moot at present. Maybe this'll change if the mempool suffers again.

This run is fairly typical of BCH in a bull market \(20&#37; spikes\), which is oddly giving me confidence that this is a proper bull run for BTC in the making, if we assume causation rather than just correlation.

EDIT: Causation not causation? Oops.
Low RSI means oversold. the Weekly Stoch RSI dipped very low and we can see it starting to curve up again and is implying the price will continue bouncing up. 

however, people don’t usually rely on RSI by itself but its a good indicator when combined with others
Um, just read the sub.  It's around 5:1 bulls to bears in here because we're nearing the magical 9.2k mark.  I've said it a few times already, wake me up after 12k along with good volume.  This is all just low decibel noise.
I've been calling it since we tested and failed to break 12k at the beginning of March.  1 BTC = 1 Million USD is going to happen at some point, but jesus christ folks have no patience.  BTC has two use cases, speculation and a shitty store of value.  For a little perspective, mosiac was released 25 years ago and folks were flipping out!  Imagine how much more useful the internet is now since then.
Plot twist : He didn't
If I'm remembering it correctly, there was a $1,200 retrace off of $9k and a $500 retrace off $10k in the early Feb. run up.
I didn't see a 8700 dip?  I was expecting a revisit of 86xx.  Ah well, I wont close it until we break 9200, and as we cannot stay above 9000 for more than two minutes, I'm still fairly confident.  
Incoming BGD in two minutes now?
No offense, but I feel like the subs collective target price to prove a reverse to bull market keeps increasing.

Are you not entertained?
Yeah, looks like you're right. It's actually #5 if we include the giant candle that put us on this range
Turns out I was right, though.
It is when the pump was less than 400 coins trading hands.
Until it's Gdax and then you know that you better get the fuck out before the whole thing crashes.
I can get excited in the 5 minutes it takes for a red dildo to push us back into the $8k range.
Hammered!!
you don't find these pumps suspicious in the least?
A break almost the size of the channel... Can't even argue of being a fake out. 
And with a massive triangle/wedge in play.
Oh it's not meant to mean anything. For a 1 minute chart to line up like that is just rare, it just stuck out to me.

Apparently 1 minute charts garner so much disdain, even when they're posted for aesthetics *shrug*
BCH / BTC ratio. Overall BTC market cap dominance has to rebound. When reversal starts to happen people will buy BTC using alts. Alts will start fall, btc will start to rise. 
Does this include USDt?
beautiful, thank you for that.
Rule 1: There are more excellent ways to say that this is an invalid observation.

He's a r/buttcoin troll. Look at his post history
I don't even know why you bother understating it. 

1. India population: 1.3 billion

2. China population: 1.3 billion
3. Iran population: 80 million

4. Pakistain population: 200 billion.


We are talking about 3 BILLION people where the market potential for Bitcoin has been severely hindered. The middle class of China is larger than the United States.

The GDP of China is larger than the USA / Europe on a PPP GDP basis. The combined GDP of China / India / Iran, etc, is larger than the USA even on a nominal basis.

And, now that market is basically crippled.

your a little late on this.  see my next post

> A buy at $8,850 or $9,000 is completely irrelevant if your mindset is that you'll be able to sell at $20K+ in a few months. Or hell, even weeks.

Nailed it, everyone I speak to about crypto (even the average joe) is nigh on convinced 20k is now a mere formality.
Personally I’m out in fiat now. I’d rather wait until a clear trend is defined to ride, rather than try to guess the direction before the move and be wrong. There will always be other opportunities and other trades. This is just chop chop suey to me.
OK there's a lot of buyers, that's understood. But how come the 9000 resistance holds so well? Are there simultaneously many buyers and many sellers, and they are so equal that the price says inside a 200 range for days? Hardly.

So if we stick with the thought that there are many buyers, then this means there is someone selling A LOT at 9000, in fact so much, that it's keeping the whole market in check. There have been several 1000coin spikes, some even above 9000, which have been all batted down effortlessly.

Isn't that at least a bit scary? 
no, I am just wondering what is going on!

BCHUSD doesn't matter. Only BCHBTC, in my opinion. $4K when BTC is at $16K is a lot different than $4K when BTC is at $8K.
Haha awesome man
true but that wedge is a bit tricky to define, i guess a better way would be having a thick line like [this](https://www.tradingview.com/x/aBik8zyv/) which would represent the range ~~below~~ at which there is more buyers than sellers


correct, fixed it thanks
This is actually a really interesting point that I should have realized long ago. This explains why I seem to miss a lot of movement. I'm gone from work and not yet returned home from my meetings. Hmm, thanks for pointing this out. 
*slow clap*

You are becoming an excellent member of this sub! I appreciate your comments 
Have you been in a coma since April 6th? The massive bull run that all crypto is in.
Just one lonely doji.
You ride this, you don't stand in front of it :) 
i did a show and tell with your mom too!
Lol
The breakdown was neither on volume nor had a significant price change. Hell, almost all of bitcoin breakouts to the upside started with an on volume breakout to the downside. Proof: https://imgur.com/a/HMKFebX
I'm perplexed tbh..

What is your reasoning for this action?
I have it breaking down from the rising wedge and finding support on the ascending triangle.  Not much of a surprise the bullish formation is stronger with current market conditions.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/FC8hWPl5/
I'm with you guys. 8930 June, 8950 Sept.
4x long from 8780. So 8820 was pretty much last chance to break even
´.
There's often a significant delay on a rising wedge breakout. 

The market can (and often does) hug the former support line from the downside for several hours (and even days) before there's a significant reaction.
If you say so but my wedge is drawn from the bottom of the BGD and then the lowest support point along the way and extended on a ray. Looks the same as your black lined wedge just depends how tightly you draw it.
Any position here is scary. 

I’ll be on the bench for this game 
That's my fear as well. I'll probably just move the stops up and forget the alarms, especially since it's a particularly busy day/week for me with work.
ok thanks a lot.

just compared it to the move after breaking the descending wedge at 7k which was way bigger although this line breakout seems to be more important imo.
put back in 10% or something and say fuck it. if it goes to $20k that'll be 25% and you'll be happy. if it goes down from here you'll be incredibly happy you sold 90% at $8k. 

It's crazy you watched it for that long before cashing out, good on you. 

But now you have the freedom to not worry. 

Do what you want, but it sounds like you just need a break from bitcoin. I say don't try to time the market and just reinvest what you don't mind losing and start over basically. 
Fork isn't until 5/15, so it could certainly continue. I'm not looking to mess with it anymore though.

> It's obviously retarded to open a long here as well.

Not really. I think it is the best place to open a X10-15 leverage long here for a quick doubling of your money. If I'm not wrong we should break to the upside. The support line "broke" but there is no sellers. It'll play a bit and then go up.

But that's what I hope for so maybe I'm biased?

Fairy tale wtf? Most alts lost in satoshi value on the run to 11,7. You can check this on any chart.
It was under 9k like 20 minutes ago dude.
:o Sloppy, that is a sloppy job of a post coming from you. Hey guys, 50% chance of rain tomorrow. Bad. All jokes aside, I’ve been following your posts closely and appreciate the solid, impartial opinions you share with the community. I have a great deal of respect for people like you and Chewy. Not sucking up, no reason to. I appreciate your honesty and impartiality, and how much it contributes to making this sub the most open-minded objective Bitcoin community I could find so far.
Yeah we are, and my guess isn't very educated.

To answer your question, I think 9.2K is a good entry if you're in it for the long haul. However, most people here are trading short to medium term. 9.2k is too risky right now if that's your play. I'd wait to find where this decides to settle, figure out the support and resistance zone, then make a decision. 

We could go to 9.8K, 11K, or stagnate a bit and drop back down to 8.9K or lower. It always seems that the worst predictions come after a big move, before support and resistance is defined.
Mine is since the pump from 6800.
That's why i'm not giving much credit to pseudo fake outs. 
Mine goes back to 6800 as well.
[This is how I've drawn it](https://www.tradingview.com/x/iP1oMekc/)
Actually, if you look at the 7-day average (the more pale lines) USD volume is rising even in the US. It's no wonder that the 91 day average is lagging behind, after > 90 days of bear market.

The spike in the 7-day average global transaction volume to a new ATH is quite impressive.
Yes that data was for the United States.

You may not think it's significant that LBC United States transaction volume has tanked in the last three months.  

Other people do find it to be sigifnicant.  
Works for me, I am too pessimistic to say that out loud. So I'll just think about it and hope it to true.
Jesus man, well said. 
Ok we can agree to disagree.  I suspect there are some big players who determine where the price is at any time.  Although could be big players whose goals are not always aligned.  But real organic volume is near nothing.
Not one person.  But at times (for weeks or months at a time), likely a small group of coordinated individuals have 98% control of the market.
Take a break, I got fucked by the first bgd too man. 

I think we got too used to shorting. ;) Forgot when BTC trends it trends hard 
I mean not really, my heart and FOMO are saying go long but my brain is reminding me that I said I'd short $9.2-9.3k a week ago. 
every trader and their mom is thinking about "let me buy in now and sell at 10k" Lol.

It should break down with a whimper and be bought up with reckless abandon once it touches $8,500.
I agree. The first rejection off 11.7K was well under the ATH log line. The second coincided with a perfect double top and rejection off the line. We've not punched through the log line, but $12.1K should bring whatever FOMO money is still on the sidelines at that point. 
yeah thats's like the "Haha you thought I was the real bad guy?" level, then another evil genius appears that controlled everything all the time
Ok, makes sense. I don’t think we’ll get anove 10k, but I learned my lesson when I shorted at 8100
I've got to second this. There are several sane and sensible posters here whose insight is most valuable. L14dy, Slopysynapses (sp?), Chewy, MikeXBT. There may be others I've missed, but these are the people that have made an impression on my reading of the daily thread.
I appreciate that. I meant more that I would take a break from trading. I sold some coins and now just gonna relax. Sub is still my favorite place on reddit though
Oh alright. Fingers crossed then. The best case scenario I can think of right now is we go up to 9.7k or 9.8k and then retest the kijun and bounce off of it and continue up.

This is one of those lines in the sand moments. I'm not the mod who removed that comment, but I agree with the decision. We have to draw the line somewhere, and this is a better fit for the altcoin thread.

We're still figuring out quite how to moderate this, so please lend us some slack for a while. :)
Trying to consolidate all that conversation to a different thread. The nature of that discourse is considered distinct now that we have a thread to handle it.
So it's confirmed not a client-side issue, thanks for commenting. And no problem. It took me awhile to find a crypto app with a solid chart interface.

Go for it, man. Not my money, not my problem.

But, I don't see any "blow off top" in any of the alts, certainly not ETH nor BCH. Second, what's your take-profit target? I suppose we'll test the 100DEMA @ ~8.8-9K.... but that's it? I don't see *that* much reward.
It's not a bad trade at all but I'm very hesitant to pull the trigger. I'm thinking $9.8k might be the first top due to that being the strongest, highest resistance since we fell from $11.8k. 

Usually when we get rejected it's very quick- if it's not, the pullback is very small. the fact that we're creeping up indicates there's more upwards movement left

I'm thinking of combining Mike and Chewys strategy. Not shorting or hedging til $9800 while also waiting for a better re entry down lower, between $8.5-8.8. 

That being said I'm going to re evaluate in 12-24h and see where we are. May miss a great entry though. I might short at $9250-9300 with stops above $9350 if we get there just for the r/r. 
Yup -_- :(
My strategy right now is:

1. Short if we dip below 8.6 as that would signify a lower low on this recovery. Would be confident in riding that down below 8k.

2. Short if we take another failed trip over 9k. Perhaps a low 9 high 8.9 short for a scalp.

3. Long if we break 9.2k with conviction. I would be wary of riding that much over 10.5k, knowing the 11.5/11.8k double top already experienced. Above 12k, all bets are off!

I'm merely an amateur at this, but trying to make sense and logic out of a quite illogical period in Bitcoin's history, and that's saying something for Bitcoin! :-)
How quickly we forget. I do recall a few wicks down to the $700 range when the spot market was still up above $760. 

If memory serves, that's actually what did it for me. I'd had enough of that kind of shit.
When it breaks its gonna break hard, i have no doubt we will se a big 1-2K dildo painted on the chart

No, I already have limit sells at $9,800. 

The market was overextended at $7,800. 

It was absurdly overextended at $8,800. 

This shouldn't continue much longer without a significant correction. 
I want to make sure I exit before resistance at $10,000. 
>But I find that TA can work on smaller timeframes as long as it is not invalidated by a different pattern on a larger timeframe.    

That's seems like quite a sensible way to think about TA at smaller time steps. Thanks for sharing your thoughts. 
thanks    
Bears aren’t permabears, they are just short term bearish

thanks for the suggestion.
I haven't opened any yet but I think you are right regarding breakout confirmation. My plan is to open a position before the breakout, incase it doesn't happen, close the position in time at break-even.

Let's see, I have mixed thoughts at the moment. 
Thanks. Much appreciated.
Right gotcha, I assumed you were referring to the dump that might happen from the wedge breaking down, without the effect that a long squeeze could have amplifying it
Sorry Chris, don't follow
Mods I've been shitposting as hard as I can and I have yet to be made a regular ;__;

Do you hate me? Why can't I have the right of passage 
Yep, seems they're all on bitmex too, gambling on high margin. We had a great week or two, price recovered nicely, we broke out of the down trend, and yet you'd think bitcoin died again in here. Too many people shorting every green candle and getting upset and confused when they're run over. 
OK, well, that's your opinion, and you're entitled to it.  I disagree.  Time will tell who is correct.
What is LBC? newb question, google doesn't turn up anything meaningful :)
It's effectively consuming the mining supply.
You're.... not wrong lol. I meant to type week and a half! Thx for the correction.
If you invested in 2014, you don't fit the profile. 
Lol were you in MLM stuff?! 
A non-manipulated market would honestly look pretty similar to the one we currently have. We'd still see significant movement following (and often leading up to) breakouts from key areas of support/resistance. 

Every time the market prints a bull flag (or a bear flag), everyone flocks to complain about how manipulated the market is. 

But it's not like those formations are unique to bitcoin.
ofcourse, most of the elite are probably in this for that sole reason alone
lol, my bad. btce
Open the root of this sub and read the stickies.
I eyeballed it a fair bit, but all I did was look at price approximately 28 days after previous smaller bear trends:

https://imgur.com/a/iOOKV2G

If you compare the current situation to the previous 2014 bubble instead, then price will be somewhere around $7,000 30 days from now.
I like to think I closed it at $7.4 lmao. I clicked "close" at $7.4 but close doesn't market close. I needed to hit market. didn't do it til higher. 

Re opened a much smaller short at $8.3 and got stopped out twice on the way up to $8.7. Long from $8780 now. 

Was taking a shit just now when we wicked $9200ish, I might short there with stops at $9300 if we get close. Not sure if it'll be a hedge or 1.5-2x

Note my $11k short was, at the end, a 55x short, lol. 
It's definitely not stupid. you can just rebuy above $9.3k. But you have to have a good plan. if you buy above $9300 and it dumps back down to $8800 will you sell? You'll get chopped up if you don't have an elaborate plan ready to deal with multiple outcomes. 
What tar am I stuck in? You compared us to another sub which you clearly hate, then claimed something without expounding on it in a way that would pass muster here. I do agree the market has changed, but you're the one making proclamations that require more evidence. Use more words. 

I do still think you would like the new thread.
What you talking about?
Top? From 6k to the top of the big red candle before we bounced. Bottom, average growth / 2 .


That's just my opinion

Next time the ratio drops below .1, I may buy some just so I can dump during the inevitable next pump.  It's getting predictable at this point.
How dare you to be bearish? Insta downvote to hell lol... This sub sometimes...
How does one blast off to a place bellow? I have no idea, but if something can, it's Bitcoin :)
Maybe find a wormhole on the way to the Moon perhaps?
yes 1500 actually, but the difference is we barely stayed 8 hours at 9k's door in february, and here we've been camping in front for 3 days
Lol naw, I'm not confident we see a BGD either. This whole movement makes no sense to me. Why I hate margin trading. Good luck tho. I'd be open to a pull back to 8.6 before breaking 9 and we are all winners. 
I mean my target has been $12-13k for 3 months


You'll get a confirmation bias because you're not going to see people posting about it until their price target is close. So as we go up you'll see different people say "I'll think this is it at $(current price + 1000)"
Right, but that's hindsight man. Your post contributed nothing. Your feelings are not decipherable or actionable to us.

I hope you made out well. I got rekt (mostly due to over-trading and trading fees)
It was suspicious at 6.9k, 7.8k, 8k, 8.2k, 8.5k, and now 8.9k. 

My suspicious views led me to short every time I thought it was a “ fake pump” ultimately getting destroyed. 
Everything is suspicious 
We should probably have a #ChartArt tag for treats like these
You may be wrong on your conclusions. Because the last time when dominance was rising, we had bearish period. Of course, dominance may rise because of BTC increase, and alts decrease, but the most likely scenario is BTC will decrease, but not much hard as alts. So, in this case the dominance rebounds.
Why the dominance has to rebound?
Maybe BTC price is being held back behind psychological 9k barrier so money is flowing into alts instead.

This is more or less how RSI becomes increasingly irrelevant in a strong trend. 

Whereas someone employing technical analysis might look at the recent market action and think, "holy shit, there's no way this can continue going up without at least a moderate correction," Someone divorced from TA sees the market at $6,800 one day and $8,900 the next and thinks, "holy fuck balls...I need to get in on this before it's at $12,000 again."
I spent like a minute trying to figure out what that gibberish meant and it turns out it was nothing - felt a lot like chart trading. 
Depends what your goal is.  My goal was make usd and I was holding Bcash and dumped it at near the peak.  So I consider that a win.  Bcash has had a hell of a run lately though for sure.  At some point a bunch will prob dump back to bitcoin.  We will see.  
It was easy.  I also dumped the rest of my bitcoin.  Didn’t feel like holding through that mess and it turned out to be an excellent exit of btc and Bcash.  
Why, thank you!
I'm zoomed way in on this discussion. I'm talking about the dump to $8,800 a moment ago and the bounce to $8,940.
FOMO, plain and simple.

I'm not a fan of this rising wedge people are charting since the pattern includes a breakout of two relatively major resistances (ascending log support, ATH resistance). When shorter term patterns bracket a longer term breakout, especially when their bias is in opposite directions, I try to not put much emphasis on the shorter term one. I think it's equally as valid to put us in an ascending triangle with 9k horizontal resistance after the initial breakout of the long term resistance.

Sentimentally my argument makes sense - people are placing more weight on the longer term pattern breaking than they are the shorter term wedge.
Well played. :)
Mate you have a very good entry. I think you need to plan your profits rather than planning to break even here. :)
well, if you are long from <8k i say you have nothing to worry about aside from losing profits.
If I touch the stuff it's gonna be after a major retrace. Hindsight is just always 20/20...
Fork splitting it into 2 coins? 
My bad ;) 
as i said there are only three coins I care to deal with.  maybe Monero too if we're getting frisky.

in the case of tx malleability, it is an overblown talking point from you know who that poses little risk to any merchant accepting bch. 
What are you complaining about?
Again, honest question, what is wrong with it now compared to previously? 

Im also new.
I’m all for comic relief and a little bit of laughter. I’m always joking around and making comments. 

Can’t be extremely serious all the time
Well, from a risk/reward standpoint with stops below $8,500 it's not bad. Which is what I've just done (albeit less leverage than you're suggesting). 

But from a technical standpoint, there's no reason under god why this should continue to rise without correcting first. 

And if it doesn't correct at some point soon, I shudder to think what the ultimate correction will look like. 

A rise to $10,000 would put the target for a long pole reversal at around $8,400. Give or take. 

If it rises to $11,700 before correcting, then we're looking at a potential drop from $11,700 to $9,200 to resolve the long pole warning.
I THINK NOT! 

Gtfo seriously.
pump vs dump 
My bad, I was thinking dollars. Most of the alts I follow recovered 100% from 5,8k bottom in February. So it took alts and BTC the same amount of time to recover 100%~. This time some of the alts are already 100%+ while BTC raised 25%~. I am talking dollars
And when it bounced past 100 for the last time, there was a "20 minutes ago, dude" at that point as well.

It seems very likely that we'll retrace, but any point could be our last. Up or down. Time is irrelevant.
Hahaha actually I'm just saying there's a good chance that the market doesn't allow him to re-enter at that price point is all and that the comment above mine didn't account for that- it just kind of assumed he'd be able to re-enter without being uncomfortable at some point.

And hey, thanks, I really, really appreciate that :) Thanks a ton, that keeps me motivated to keep commenting!
Yes, I did forget to mention long - term.... My bad 
I'd draw it like this then, and cut off some of the wick that started the Big Green Candle:

Looks like the market just bounced off support in that case.
Ya, you're going to want to wait for a conclusive breakdown before touching a short based on that formation. 

Personally, I'd wait for a lower local low below $8,760 before considering a short.
Glad to see other people looking at the details.

Yes! 20% - 25% on any timeframe is substantial. That's getting missed.
United States LBC transaction volume is down about 50% in the last three months.

But not reason to argue about a chart when anyone can look at it and see the obvious.

I hasn't tanked. It dropped with the rest of the market over three months ago. It has been going sideways for 12 weeks.
You can tell I don't entirely buy the idea myself, given the question mark aha.
yep, just really bothered and perplexed at what happened to the stop loss I thought I set up at ~8500
I think you need a rest mate.
So are you saying most likely we won't see sub 8k ever again?
Yup, once we see it break 12 it is all hell breaking lose and the big bull can be declared as far as I'm concerned. Til then, while bullish, I'm ready for any pain that may come my way lol. 
thanks bro ;)
yeah, this is pretty early, but the other encounters wicked over the kijun briefly then came back down -- this one seems to be holding its ground for the time being.
Keep up the good work.

On the "list of things I care about," alts are pretty far down the list.

>BTC and BNB are very different things. BNB is to AMAZ as BTC is to um, something. BTC can be valued at 100x half the stock market, while BNB will still have a real-world business behind it's value. Sure both have supply/demand but one is basically a security.

I feel it important to point out that BNB is not a security, "basically" or otherwise. BNB holders are not owners of any equity of the parent company. 
Are we looking at the same BCH charts lol?? Blow off top in ETH? Sure, not really, but ~70% in a couple weeks.. I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T BE BUYING IT HERE. 

And my target is probably 8.4-8.6 range, feel it out as we go. I really wouldn't look that much into this dude. I've been long plenty of times during this run and this is the first short I'm opening lol. I like the strength of the 9.2-9.3 horizontal resistance and (along with other factors I mentioned) seems like a good entry point for a short. Worst case? I lose a tad over 1%, big whoop.
We can lobby for renestatment if he apologizes.... 
What you laid out seems to be the general TA consensus at the moment, however I’m sure there are big players watching this very consensus to pull a reverse switcharoo on the rest of us.
I think all your price targets are pretty good.

Tempted to scalp now then given we just failed to sustain over 9k?
Same thought, indeed! I hope market agrees with us.
You really think it would correct inches away from snatching that tempting 10k fruit? Or the retrace would be necessary to gather confidence/consolidate for the 10k attempt?
So more of a medium term holding as opposed to expecting 9800 in the next day or two.
There has been a lot of BCH adoption (e.g. Bitpay), and the next hard fork is getting closer. 
Maybe some people see this as positive

Please don't get sucked into alt discussion in the daily. You're not getting a ban because it's not a top level comment.
It's what a seasoned member should have as a right of passage.
Localbitcoins (local markets)
that's why I think behaviour finance is so good to learn when trading in general, charts and markets are 80% people betting and FOMOing.

Sadly(?) BTC has traditionally attracted a crowd of programmers and engineers, that think fundamentals matter much more than they do and is biased by this

Look at this nice Jesse Livermore quote(From Reminiscence of a Stock Operator)

>There is nothing new on Wall Street or in stock speculation. What has happened in the past will happen again, and again, and again. This is because human nature does not change, and it is human emotion, solidly build into human nature, that always gets in the way of human intelligence. Of this I am sure.

>All through time, people have basically acted the same way in the market as a result of greed, fear, ignorance, and hope. This is why the numerical formations and patterns recur on a constant basis.

>I absolutely believe that price movement patterns are being repeated. They are recurring patterns that appear over and over, with slight variations. This is because markets are driven by humans — and human nature never changes.
> don't get stuck in the tar dino

He's referring to Dino :)
I guess my issue with the other thread is that "alt" is a huge specturm.  In all seriousness there is btc/bch/eth. thats it.  that thread is more penny stocks and snl than anything.  Im mostly dissipointed in this sub as of late. I know there has been a push as of late to "clean it up" but the posts are likend to watching a horse with blinderes on.  People talkin about good entries and how to relate them to TA.  

This market has always been the wild west and heavily manipulated.  It will be until major entities buy out the exchanges and politicians put (more) traffic lights on the on ramps.  

I remember when Lawsky was in front of Congress talking and that ruled the thread for weeks.  TA was splashed in but it was still useful because there wasn't a spotlight on the currency by the big banks.  

Anyway I digress this sub isn't nearly as usefull as it used to be but another one hasn't supplanted it.  

Strange days.

>On 30 March 2018, we are making the following changes to **Altcoin** products:

There'll always be that one time it wasn't predictable!
Easy: 1/BTCUSD on tradingview
Log line should be bellow 8500 now. If it goes down (and it's a big IF) i would expect support to be between 8450 - 8500 because that was where we spent more time bouncing before the pump that made us cross the log line. But i'm with you, would be ecstatic if it went there. But just not seeing it.
12k, and I change my flair and go all in long.  Until then, I'm still skeptical of this whole move up and it's love volume.
sorry you got rekt

so what's your plan now? buy all in?
Well you have to realise that it's important to know if it's included or not, regardless how small.

Money might verry well be flowing from alts back to usdt, but you won't be able to tell if usdt is included in the marketcap.

What we do know is that BTC dominance decreased, that of alts increased yet both btc and alts increased in price. To me this is a better indicator for money flowing back into the crypto market. 

Feel free to correct me if i miss things here
Rule 1: Let's not. You should know better.
Honestly, I would not even be surprised if it kept bulling. A manipulated market has no boundaries in either direction.
Anything for the agenda.
Noted and fixed
There is a difference between a ban of supply (drug ban) and a ban on demand (crypto ban). Crypto supply is unchanged by a ban unlike drug supply. It won't work like drug bans where price goes up.
Yeah but I'd say counterparty risk and the ease with which shorts are squeezed makes it more dangerous to go short in a manipulated market, unless you're the one doing the manipulating.

Exactly, beautifully explained. Behavioral psychology is huge.
That's what my head feels like sometimes after staring at charts to long 
Well done my friend.
wonderful trade, have you been slowly getting back into a better position now? or you're just waiting with fiat?
Or short it if it hasn't retraced a ton by early May. 
So you don’t know how BCH handles tx malleability. It’s actually been partially solved by the DAA HF and they did it differently than SegWit. It’s also quite an important fix.

In fact it is important enough that the developers started a working group about it. And since the change is non-trivial, they decided to slate it for after the May 15 HF. Soooo... it’s not exactly a “you know who” scenario. I think it’s good that this is on the BCash teams list and I think they make some valid considerations here. I still think SegWit is more elegant, but that doesn’t mean that MalFix won’t work.

https://github.com/bitcoincashorg/workgroups/blob/master/wg-malfix/summaries/20180130%20-%20Meeting%20Summary.md

I’m not surprised you’re so misinformed, but I expected an A class shill and you’re second tier at best
My main issue is the failure of this sub to adapt to the changing market. The mood of the sub is to put on blinders to the overall market rather than accept and adapt.
> But from a technical standpoint, there's no reason under god why this should continue to rise without correcting first.

Because it is bitcoin? It goes up and down fast and furious?

> And if it doesn't correct at some point soon, I shudder to think what the ultimate correction will look like.

remember merlin long pole alerts? They usually go on and on and on until people are confident enough and then you get the big hummer.
There you go, under 9k. 
It is EXTREMELY likely.  It's hilarious how many times I've seen people post "x value is the new floor for [insert crypto currency here]"

My favorite was a few weeks ago "Looks like $16 is the new floor for Nano".
No worries. If it's long term, jump in now! Maybe DCA a percentage as well if you're comfortable with that 
It dropped like 50$ on my chart but with a little change it would bounce from support. For me it didnt break, even though i closed 15% of my short there. Unless this thing breaks down it won't get any lower 
I'm with you... I have stops at about the same price.  
Well, as we all know, Jan-Mar'18 was the 2nd worst quarter in all of BTC's history. So it is not really a surprise that a 91-day average of anything related to the BTC market is facing sharp downwards.

Now, in your link, would you mind taking a look at the 7-day average in either of the two plots on the right-hand-side, and write here where this weekly-averaged trend is pointing?

Again, the chart shows all.  50% drop is considered "tanking" by most people.

You say "It's Good for Bitcoin".  Most would disagree.
Don't worry, I lost a lot of money in about 15m because I hit close instead of market on bitmex. Very frustrating and sad

Just means we have to be more careful 
You made a mistake, i'm being stubborn... Short from 8100 and almost 40% of my stack underwater. This time i'll set a stop to 9250 as the stop hunting should calm down for now. Its the 2nd time i lose this much, Last time took 2 weeks to get it all back

"never" is always a ridiculous claim to make. 

But we *shouldn't* see sub $8,000 prices until May 3rd at the earliest:

https://imgur.com/a/8KGTs6c

The market is currently north of the log-resistance line stemming back to $20,000. 

I would expect it to serve as very strong support if there is a correction in the near future. 

Since it's still descending, however, the market could absolutely remain above the line but still fall below $8,000 sometime around May 3rd.
[deleted]
The post in question was much more about BCH than BTC, and was one we likely would have removed before as well. (Though I've never liked being one of the final arbiters on what "real" bitcoin is.) Now there's actually a place on our sub to recommend the post be made instead.

Anything strongly linked back to the bitcoin market will be allowed to stay here. Scrolling down you'll see many such instances.

Uhh... I'm not seeing a "blow of top" here. Not yet, at least.

Can't we just settle in Buying $10 of bitconnect? 
I like that quote, and it's a pretty solid rationale for why flags, triangles, H&S, etc form time and time again. Despite the fact that TA is generally considered bunk within the financial community. 

A bull flag presents itself because everybody pig piles on a breakout, takes profits, and waits on the sideline to see whether the market will keep going or pull a 180. 

A head and shoulders pattern can be seen as the market overextending itself while hopium keeps the trend alive just long enough for one final half-hearted attempt to revisit the previous high. Once it becomes clear that the previous peak is as high as it's going, the market capitulates in unison and there's a breakdown.  
I see it similarly. Please go to the alt thread and establish a credible discourse for this line of thought. The purpose of that thread is to remove discourse around alt classification from the discussion of bitcoin trading and market forces.

Invalidating or validating specific alts is not something the mod team is able to accomplish through moderation. That has to be established by the community in a dedicated forum through consensus.
>It will be until major entities buy out the exchanges and politicians put (more) traffic lights on the on ramps.
If you think the market can be improved by more politically motivated regulation, you may  have failed to grasp the essential point of bitcoin.
Going to ignore you cause you wasting my time

That would mean 0.10$ btc
I’m long from the 8800 range. 
0$ is boundary indeed. I like this sub the most and sometimes look at rbtc and rbuttcoin for contrarian/ balanced viewpoints. Still can't fathom why buttcoiners (specially the OG butts) chose to mine comedy gold instead of riding the bubble wave and exiting smartly.
you can't ban bitcoin. see comment below from Iranian redditor.
I was under the impression that your post was about Bitcoin Cash... mainly because you said it was. This is the discussion thread for Bitcoin. If everyone posted about their flavour of the week altcoin whenever it pumps we'd never get to discuss actual Bitcoin.
[removed]
did it say buy or sell? asking for a friend
I have just been buying a little bitcoin when it feels like it is in the dumps.  I want to long some.  My gut just tells me hang on here and wait for what feels like near the true local bottom to buy more.  Maybe we already hit it and that’s ok.  I’ll just buy some each time it dumps hard.  Easy strategy for me is just buy more if it dumps $1000 or more below my last buy.  I might snag a large position later this year if it feels right.  I feel pretty good about my current situation with a decent little stack of alts and some bitcoin that I bought for less than current prices.  I went through a lot of stress and amazement in this game last year and needed a break.  Stress like watching 15k disappear in 2 days and then things like 20k appearing out of nowhere over a few days.  I didn’t know what I was doing but I did ok because I had targets and a plan if they hit and it did.  Now if I grab large stakes I will have a plan both ways.  My initial plan was long until something hit, which I think is fine if you are patient and you are playing within your means.  The game is so much less stressful to me now, but I only have around 5% of what I had out there back at the peak in December and early January.  
Ill admit I'm not as technical as some, OH YOU GOT ME. 

What I do know is that as long as the code is open source any deviations will move to the mean.

that leaves plenty of room for any non technical person to leave it to a trusted CTO.

maybe we found where your expertise lies.
So you want discussion on more than BTC/Fiat pairs basically?
Yep. Everyone pretends like they know wtf is happening but it's all mostly luck.
Following your logic you should never buy in because it is always extremely likely to retrace.
Agreed. It's getting close to do or die time in this tiny range. It's either blast through $9,000 and hold it for awhile, or dump down to $8,500 as the first stop and possibly $8,300 or $7,800 ultimately.
Again, the chart shows and says all.   You may not like what it says, but that's not my problem.
Can you see it dropping 50% in the last 12 weeks? Has it dropped 50% before and continued to rise?
hey dude just out of curiosity, are you in your 20's, 30's, 40's or older??
Do you own some gold&silver as an investment as well? 
Yes, that's true. I generally don't concern myself very much with external factors that might dictate "why" a particular move is happening. I'm mostly just concerned with the fact that it's happening.

I've been through the whole libertarian aspect of btc about 5 years ago.  It feels good, sure. 

The reality is that crypto is liberating in many ways but the fact is, with any discovery there is an equal amount of cost attached to any benefit.  Further, the difference between those costs and benefits are equal to the magnitude of the advancement.  That is why (hopefully righteous) people will be able to negotiate that gap for civilization's benefit.

Case in point Mt.Gox  soon to be Finex.  Welcome to the Wild West.  If you drink dirty water you'll get dysentery. 

Libertarians need to be focused on finding a real bitcoin jesus that will do what is not often done these days...the right thing.
1/BTCUSD just inverts the chart. He asked how you can "blast off" to a place below. On that chart, $10 BTC is above us. 
i think i've been burned too many times

i don't believe any of this anymore


I think a large number of people in buttcoin do ride the wave. I have made a buttload off of butts (7 figures). That still does not mean I will not call out the ridiculousness and absurdity and delusion when I see it. Taking fiat and mining comedy gold is what most people do.
Of course not. But you can ban it's value creation. This is done at exchanges. If bitcoin only can be traded person to person using cash notes well not many people will care enough to do it and it will strongly effect price discovery. It's value would plummet.
You can take that stance at your own peril.  The reality is that BTC exists in an ecosystem where it is no longer the end all/be all.  If you aren't taking into account "alts" good luck.  I have some shares in a petro dollar you can have.
After much thought I decided I don't know what the hell is going on. On the sidelines until we convincingly break 9200 (jaded until we break 9k) 
you said try me. I tried you. You failed.

A good shill would have googled. Maybe even learned something. A bad shill (second-tier at best) would have just ignored the question with a hand-wavy argument.

Be a good shill.
more or less.  this sub has become like much of the USA in general. very tribal and stand offish.  coupled with the fear that moderation=censorship leads to hivemind, the all to familiar entrapment of all social media. 

most are too ignorant to search out tools to circumvent "censorship" aka removed posts so the fear of being marginalized breeds conformity.  usa in a nutshell.


That makes no sense at all.  I didn't say "it'll never go up in price".  It's just silly to think it'll never go down to the 8k range again, especially when it literally just left the 8k range.

Also, a retrace is fine, that gives you an opportunity to buy some more at a lower price.
The only chance i get to minimize the losses is fomo'ing @9200 and hope it goes at least to 9500. 
Look at the chart.  I don't need to explain it to you, and if I do, then you have a problem and I can't help you.
I do apologize, but I prefer not to offer up much in the way of identifying information. 

Perhaps I'm being paranoid, but even an admission of what additional assets I hold could someday come back to bite me.

For example, let's assume for a moment that I'm 85 years old. You know I own some amount of bitcoin, and that I also have some investments in Gold and Silver. 

Based on my posting frequency, one might be able to deduce my approximate location as well. 

Perhaps you rummage through my post history and discover I collect stamps as well. 

Well, now you've narrowed down your search from "everybody on the planet" to "an 85-year-old man in x time zone who is likely a member of at least one stamp collecting group." 

Maybe you'd find mention of an underlying drinking problem in my post history and you start hiring task-rabbits to hit up local AA meetings to track me down. 

With enough determination, and the right data points, you can probably de-anonymize absolutely anyone on the internet. 

And I prefer to minimize the likelihood of that happening.
Thanks for the feedback!
Appreciate the honest response. Instead of hoping for regulation, real libertarians need to find (or help the market find) alternative solutions. I believe that is already happening.
Yea. But mathematically
Well guess what, the market doesn't care what you believe. The market is always right.
starving people with 8900% currency inflation would still care to use it. Anyways as others pointed out, better agree buttcoin is ded, am 100% out.
lol its late (where i am at least).  I'm not googling anything right now. I'll see you tomorrow. 

Not exactly sure what I'm shilling.  I'm just trying to avoid this sub becoming a btc/fiat only thread.  There will be no one coin to rule them all.  

I realize I said the magic words but let's be real, if we are all that fragile then we must look at ourselves first.
there other subs for anything not btc/usd related
Mods are aware. We're working on a resolution. We want to resolve this issue through friendly discourse and by censoring demagoguery (falls under rule 1). If you think we are missing something, please make sure to report the offending comments and/or DM us about the issue you are seeing with links and an explanation.

Very clever. Using your actual age and hobbies as an “example”, so that it’s the last thing people suspect. 
Ok, i totally get that and I'm really sorry that i asked about your personal stuff. As you stated above, that kind of shit could really happen lol.....

I just wanted to see what you think of precious metals in general. I still keep my gold/silver as an alternative hedge to bitcoin and believe that silver is getting ready for a huge breakout this year.

If you don't believe in them at all, I also wanted to hear your opinion since I can be certain and your reasoning will not be without merit. To be honest, i wish you are in a bit of older age bracket than being like 20's.... cause they just tend to write off precious metals as failed project and I can't blame them for it. hehe

>Maybe you'd find mention of an underlying drinking problem in my post history

We all know that part is true 
At the very least I think everyone on here assumes you’re a guy, unless that is you pull an AmericanPegasus on us. 
Crypto is like so many other revolutionary ideas: a relatively small number of people come up with it, then a relatively large number of people completely fuck it up for a while, and then it will either disappear for ever or evolve into something that kinda works but no one is 100% happy with.

You know, like democracy.
TY.  I realize im old school 90's flaming right now but trust me, I can make some very good points.  I've done it before long ago in the far far away.  I came along in the Cyprus days.
sure, but which right?

that it just keeps pumping up without retesting 8k?

or that it just keeps pumping from bots and whales?
We trade BtC/USD in here

There are plenty of other subs for altcoins and their BTC pairs

We now have an altcoin thread. Go over there. We trade BTC/USD as well as swaps and futures in here
And now a thread!
Well, one of the most interesting things about precious metals is that they definitely won't be precious "forever," and they might not even be precious that much longer. 

The universe is absolutely swarming with silver and gold. A neutron star collision produces silver and gold that can be measured in hundreds of earth masses. 

Not the available gold/silver on earth, mind you. But amounts equivalent to more than 100x the total mass of the earth.

Even asteroids between Mars and Jupiter are believed to contain vast stores of gold and silver. Far more than is accessible through mining on earth.

In as little as 20 to 30 years, it could be possible that humanity will be able to efficiently mine some of the precious metals from various asteroids in the solar system. Which, one would assume, would throw our entire economy into complete and total chaos.

For the short term, I don't see gold and silver going anywhere. There's life in the old bird yet, so to speak. 

But it's not going to be valuable forever.
edit, my b, someone else
I will neither confirm nor deny the allegation, as I've painted myself into a bit of a corner here where doing so would provide potentially identifying data.
Aha. That could explain why URafraid!
It's an unpopular opinion, but I share it with you. This is not a breakout. I think we re-test the $8000s soon.
I just meant that people will keep saying it makes no sense because it doesn't fit with some preconcieved notion of what the market should do based on whatever TA they are using, trading strategy or bias from short/long position they keep taking. Trying to apply sense to the market is a fools errand. The irrational movement of the market isn't "wrong." I could see this continuing to move higher and higher precisely because people don't think it should. People keep shorting every pump because they are denial of the bear market ending. I'm not saying I know whats happening either but it seems awfully similar to the inverse delusion of when everyone thinks they are going to be filthy rich during a bull market.
In due time I’m sure it will sort itself out and those that don’t adapt will go the way of the dodo. 
yeah. I can't disagree with you on that long term outlook. I'm still debating whether I should keep more in fiat or little more in gold/silver besides bitcoin. I'm like 90% in bitcoin right now and i can't really seem to trust any other asset class which you might find it a bit extreme. 

Thanks for your input btw. Your opinion is always helpful. On a side note, you remind me of the guy yolotrades. I used to follow him here :D
That was a different guy. 

I merely did the math on how many Bitmex contracts one would need to open (and where one would need to close the position) in order to afford 1 Subway tuna sub with the profits.

While I may love tuna subs, it's also possible I hate them. Or I'm indifferent about them. 
We're gonna need confirmation that this is, in fact, not you [(photo)](https://i.imgur.com/WvzTgkr.png) right after finishing a delicious tuna sub.
that’s ridiculous, this is a dedicated sub and plenty of regular posters here post in other subs all the time
I mistook /u/YRuafraid for the other guy. 

All I know about you is you have or had a dog, so you could be pretty much 80% of the planet. 

edit to add: tuna subs are great, when made correctly. Subway tuna soup on bread is disgusting though. 
If I confirm that's not me, I've increased your probability of tracking me down by approximately 1.4285714285714286e-8

If I confirm it **is** me, I've increased your probability of tracking me down by about 99.999999999999%

So ya, not going to confirm or disconfirm.
Fair enough. Maybe I’m just being an old Fuddy Duddy from back in the day and I miss the days where it was us against the banks and feds. 

I feel for a lot of the noobs here that buy into the posts.  It’s hard enough to make good trades in a legit market but then you throw in unregulated exchanges that have access to ALL the information and can act in it with impunity, will it becomes that much harder.  

Everyone needs to take all info into account to have any chance at beating the house.  It didn’t used to be lien that but now it surely is.
