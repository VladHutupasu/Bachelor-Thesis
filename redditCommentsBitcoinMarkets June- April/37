[Daily Discussion] Friday, April 27, 2018 -- TITLE
#New post: [\[Daily Discussion\] Saturday, April 28, 2018 →](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8fhion/daily_discussion_saturday_april_28_2018/)
As we collectively agonize over whether a $200 dump means we're going sub $6,000 or a $200 pump means we're going to the moon, I thought I'd zoom out a bit and offer two possible scenarios now that the market is confidently trading above the log resistance line.

**Bull Trend 3.0 Scenario**

At least so far, the current bear trend is only a bit more severe (in both depth and duration) than many of the previous corrections seen throughout 2017. 

If you compare the previous corrections to where the market is now, the red dots are essentially "you are here" points compared to where we potentially are now at $9,200.

This scenario would become increasingly likely if $10,000 breaks and hold and pretty much a foregone conclusion if $11,700 breaks and holds. 

**Bear Bubble Burst 2.0 Scenario**

As I pointed out a few days (maybe weeks?) ago, the 2014 bubble burst saw some interesting behavior after the log resistance line was broken to the upside:

https://imgur.com/a/zFUxj

As you can see, the market broke up, but very soon after started a slow and steady decline down from around $550 to around $160. Aside from a few false breakdowns, the log resistance line held as support throughout the decline. 

If the market is going to follow this path for the medium term, then we could see additional decline down below $6,000 over the coming months with slow and sustained selling pressure throughout that time. 

I realize this falls into the category of "great, it can go up or down. Thanks for nothing Chewy." But the point of my post here isn't to define which way the market is going to go. But instead what to look out for in the short to medium term.

If the market keeps pressing onward, then it's more likely we're seeing the first scenario play out and your bias should be toward buying dips rather than selling bounces. 

If the market starts declining again back below $8,000, then selling bounces becomes more advisable, or at the very least sitting on your hands and waiting for the "real bottom." 
Good morning everyone. I would like to share my personal story, since today marks a milestone in my (short) bitcoin trading life.

Like many beginners, i was attracted by bitcoin through its bullrun in 2017 and its omnipresence in the mainstream media. Finally, i pulled the trigger and bought in at 19.000 USD via coinbase with super high fees. Watched it go to 20k, celebrating i will be super rich super fast. Saw it flash crash in late december. Decided i will be a smart trader and sold my stack while the flash crash happenend, only to buy it back later for more money. Lost alot of my stack. Decided i would be a hodler now.

Read alot about the technology, but seeing the price crash in january/february made me interested in trading again. From there on i had one goal: at least trade myself to break even. I tried to learn all the TA and especially this awesome sub helped me alot to get familiar with all the stuff going on. I started with selling/buying on gdax and went on to Bitmex. In the last 2 month, i more or less trippled my btc stack, and today is the day that i also finally am break even in fiat. Thank you so much everyone for contributing to this sub. I especially enjoy reading (and sometimes following) the opinions and trades from chewy, L14dy, sloppysynapses, MikeXBT, haserfauld and sometimes the unfortunately banned Dushman. Thank you so much guys! Happy trading everyone.

Just a reminder, if posting your position (ie "I shorted at 9600") make sure to provide the reason for your entry or exit.  Please do not just post your position, the current price, or your unexplained plan:  these sort of posts are considered "low effort content" and are against the subreddit rules.  If you are looking for feedback on your trade you will want to write out your thought process behind your trade.  If you are looking to help others you will want to provide them with the information they need to learn.  Happy trading!
I got bored and did a read through of every comment in the thread, counting if they were explicitly bullish, bearish or not explicitly either \(general trading advice/discussion or balanced arguments etc\). Deleted comments were counted in neither.

Bullish: 76

Bearish: 56

Neither: 222

Hopefully I wasn't bias in what I was interpreting as bullish/bearish, if I had some doubt I put it in the neither pile.

A lot of 'everyone here is bullish/everyone here is bearish' comments get chucked around. I counted from the 'top' sort and didn't notice any significant divergence in the counters as I went \(aka, more bulls at the top, this didn't seem true\).

Obviously you could also do a much more complicated analysis by considering the up/downvotes, the amount of comments under each parent comment etc.

Figured it might be of some interest.
Does anyone sometimes forget what we’re actually trading? The state of cryptocurrencies and how we (traders) interact with it is pretty incredible. It might possibly be the best asset/currency/*anything* to be involved with from a trader’s standpoint. 

What do I mean by this? The current state of cryptocurrencies is almost ENTIRELY speculation based. Sure, fundamentals and news may drive the market some here and there. But for the most part, it’s simply one’s ability to use TA and wit to profit from a market that can move in any direction at any given time. Bitcoin could be priced at $1000 or $20000 and you’d have a difficult time proving that one price is better than the other given that the price is almost completely based on future expected utility/adoption/value. 

You can see this play out in the market too. TA is extremely prevalent and useful. Why? Bc there’s thousands of traders basing upcoming market movements on what they’re *seeing* in the markets. Self-fulfilling prophecy? Very much so imo. 

2 recent examples: Yesterday’s break up at 8.9 from the bear flag. A very clear resistance line could be drawn and once this line broke, traders rushed in to buy. Today’s break down of the mini H&S. Once the ~9150 neckline broke traders rushed in to sell. The target price of this H&S? ~$8920. Where’d we bounce from? You guessed it, just above $8920. Now does it always play out like this? No, of course not, but the relevance of TA in this market is undeniable and for those who don’t believe in it, they're either foolish or not looking hard enough (or both). 

Edit: couple words and grammar
Good morning Europeans. 

Yesterday I posted that I would like to see some consolidation between 9300 and the bottom of the channel we got back into (https://www.tradingview.com/x/oASSVxoc/).

And It does look like it's forming a pennant/ascending triangle : https://www.tradingview.com/x/MPURIEPk/.

We also had a nice hidden bullish divergence on the hourly that is playing out right now. If the price continues to contract for the whole day we could see a nice break out to 9500, then hopefully a pullback to 9250 to test it as support (no more parabolic advances pretty please). 

I will move my stop loss from my multiple longs (between 8780 and 9100) around 9050, in case btc wants to revisit the bottom of the larger channel around 8800.


Also, Is that a (weak) hidden bull div on the daily?
https://www.tradingview.com/x/6fYj0fqh/

EDIT: a word
I [posted a chart last night](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ot9ltL7V/) in a post [found here](https://old.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ezv0s/daily_discussion_thursday_april_26_2018/dy1ekge/) showing a trend line in red that seems to be flipping from support to resistance. While we dropped off it last night, we have now risen right back onto it, still functioning as resistance.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/5IO7pwDl/

Our volume has dropped off the wild run from Wednesday, but it's still higher than it has been for a lot of April. We do seem to be drifting upwards. I have the bottom of our channel right around 8800 right now, which is a little above my current long entry. I had stops set overnight, which I've left for now at 8870. I'm really hoping it doesn't start to look like 9K will fall, because I don't want to exit this position prematurely and there's support just above break-even, but a reversal all the way to sub 9K would be hard to hold through at this point. Anything down to 9150 won't alarm me at all, though.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/0OFmrd8G/

We broke up off our bull pennant from last night, but the run got truncated on the red resistance line, which was disappointing. Breaking above it and using it as support would be my ideal bullish case here. It puts us at 10K by the 1st. 

For anyone not in position, I would not open long here. It's extremely likely we retest 9150-9200 if not 9000. We're right under some sort of resistance and we're smack dab in the middle of our channel. I'd probably sit on the sidelines or else short as close to 9400 as you can get with very tight stops (9460). Keep in mind this is a sloping line, so entry/exit targets move with time. 

Good luck all.
After combining my own chart with others from people in this sub (mainly /u/haserfauld and /u/midnightocean ), This is what I ended up with:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/kHN887hs/

We are on a highway to 11k that is composed of different lanes. The black lines are the top and bottom of the channel, which was strengthened when we topped at 9.8k and bottomed at 8.6.



We are now finding support on the blue line after meeting the resistance of the red line. If the blue line proves to be a solid support, it could be an interesting place to open a long. Some scalping would also be possible between the blue and red line (the intermediate lane) while we consolidate before trying to break through the red line's resistance and switch to the fast lane (between top black and red line). 

If the blue line breaks down again, as long as the bottom black line holds (in the slow lane) it would be the best place to open a long in this highway.

Possible rest areas and crash sites are highlighted by the fib levels of the reversal from 6k to 11.7k. 

Don't forget to fasten your seatbelts and to drive safely.
Moving the stops on my long up from $8,500 or so to roughly breakeven at around $8,780. 

Setting actual stops as well, since I won't be able to monitor the trade this evening. 

A bit of a toss up in my opinion as to whether they'll be hit, but I'd rather not be long if the market breaks below $8,800 again.
I really wish I had longed 8750 with chewy. That price offered maximum fear for going long, I should have known it was time. 
EDIT: disclaimer, only been into TA for like 2 months so i clearly dont know shit. just having fun

EDIT2: also, todays daily is really small which suggests next day/two will be exciting

Chart link: https://www.tradingview.com/x/TTtkRppN/


What i see:


Weekly high probably set at 9770. Needs to stay above 7820 to maintain the up trend but can drop all the way to 6420 and keep monthly higher low. 


If next push on 9770 breaks it then I see the 10k psychological breaking too and after 10k, next stop is 11650.


Weekly volume climaxed one February dump which could possibly indicate a temporary bottom. Since then, weekly volume mostly been declining (specially April). Could that imply accumulation?


Im going to keep an eye on the length of the upper wick on this week’s weekly candle. I think it could be quite indicative of how next week will go.


Daily- bearish engulfing on 25/04 adds confluence to 9770 being a local top for the time being. Local daily support at 8500 which is also .382 of the current “channel”. 


What im doing: short at 9280 (SL 9480) to 8500 but might close early if we don’t break 8600. Looking to scale into longs in the 7k range.
[removed]
Long from $9300.  $9200 has held and direction is up.  Stops at $9180
Aside from the BGC on the 12th, and the mountain shaped peak on the 25th, this price action is basically consistent with what we've seen since the indecisive climb began on April 4th.  Nothing out of the ordinary, just chill out.

Wohoo had a great week trading. I lost a huge amount of bitcoin trying to trade mostly long from the original 2013 $1000 bubble. Was left with 5&#37; of my stack essentially. Margin called at $186 \(literally the lowest point after the bubble\). Was devestated.  Hard part of my life. I was young and stupid too. 

Had I kept it, I'd be set for life right now.

I've been trading ever since, mostly a part time hobby thing \- I used to trade $100 at a time initially, though I've been trading a lot more ever since the 18/19k bubble popped. I've vowed myself to get better at this and I'm finally at a point where I feel I'm making reasonable trades. Maybe I'm just lucky.

Anyway I'm blazed right now haha, kind of tempted to long this action \(that was my intention earlier\), but I probably won't. I want a break. 

Anyway hello everyone! Just thought I'd introduce myself.
I feel like lots of people are getting gun shy.  Isn't this the type of movement you want for up trends?  Opened long last night at 9220, still holding it. 

Edit:  I'll throw out what I've been looking at.  I tried to find a line that I thought could represent organic growth.  Last December/Jan was not organic I think most would agree.  I plotted [this](https://www.tradingview.com/x/VOravIaW/) line on Tuesday of this week and we've nailed it yesterday.  

[Here](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ptvuk7nb/) is that same line on the current 15 min.
I’m expecting a pull back in the 9.5k area thsi weekend. Hopeully we’ll take a breather and take a couplr attempts at 9300 first, then maybe 9450, back down to this range and sideways for the weekend/next week. That would allow RSIs to cool off, and hopefully restore investor confidence.

I think I’m done shorting the corn for a while

Not sure if it's been posted yet...in today's bottom-of-the-barrel crypto news:

[Launch Time? 82% of Institutional Crypto Investors Believe Bitcoin Price Has Bottomed](https://www.ccn.com/82-of-institutional-crypto-investors-believe-bitcoin-price-has-bottomed/)

The first sentence tells you all you need to know, really (emphasis added):

> Institutional investors *that have already invested in cryptoassets and are long-term bullish on the industry* believe that the Bitcoin price has already bottomed out and will end the year above where it is currently trading.

In other news, 82% of fish believe water is wet, and 100% of investors invested in *any* asset believe said asset is going up, up, up! Film at 11.
Still expecting this breakout to take us back up to 38.2% of the ATH as an extended fifth wave.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/YCD1pTBD/

We're hovering right over 23.6% and the BBands are tightening. Expecting us to spring up any day now.
Up, down, or sideways, all of us will wind up in a hole, a jar, or the bottom of the ocean one day.

Enjoy the money while it lasts, Death is the only guarantee.

Happy trading.
It would be nice if this would wait for a decent hour to pump. It always seems to happen around 4:30am my time. My price alarms woke me up :(
I closed my long from 9229 at 9337. It might have been early but oh well. I've had a pretty successful day or so anyways, and I'm sure my luck would have run out soon enough.
Bulls are fighting desperately to keep the price over 9200. You go bulls 

Disclaimer: I’m long 
And there's the H&S break down
Looks like the head and shoulders played out. I'll open a long if and when we get to 9050.
Head and shoulders breached... down we go?
Long short ratio is getting skewed again. Doesn't seem like too much actual fiat is supporting these pumps, just a bunch of leveraged longs and liquidated shorts early on. 
By having looked too much at the charts [one starts to find TA amusing](https://www.tradingview.com/x/4dSmj7Sb)

Disclaimer: 5min chart isnt very tradable.
So, I did a thing a few days ago where I dug up a lot of stuff from 2014-2017 to show people that no, this time is *never* different...it's always the same stuff (manipulation, pumps and dumps, price suppression by <insert evil entity here>, wash trading, exchanges, psychology, etc. etc.).

It seemed to be well-received, and I enjoyed the trip down memory lane.

However, I'm seeing a rash of "no, seriously, this time is really different! Stronger fundamentals, no Gox, new ATH around the corner!" posts popping up. I really don't understand them. I'm assuming those posting such sentiments are experiencing their Bitcoin first bubble cycle, *and* have never studied or experienced bubbles in traditional assets.

I'd like to hear from those that have been posting variations of the "this time is different" meme in seriousness. I'd like to try to understand why they think so. I've yet to see any convincing evidence or reasoning to support the idea, but I'm open to being convinced.

My counter-argument, abridged:

* No, it's not different, because humans and because psychology and because market cycles
* 2014 had stronger fundamentals than 2009-2013, and we still had a bear market
* It wasn't Gox (though its implosion certainly didn't help things, to put it mildly)...it was China bans at first
* If not for China bans it would have been some other news, or just someone sneezing somewhere, because the trajectory was unsustainable and that's what happens after such huge bubble-icious run-ups

NB: I'm very bullish on Bitcoin long-term. Still. I'm also not predicting tops or bottoms here. This could go to $10k, $11.7k, or heck even $17k before stalling out and bleeding out for many months. This could also bottom out at $6k, $3k, or $1.3k. I don't know.

Time permitting, I'm going to find some great posts from 2014 with similarly sunny reasoning. I hope that'll throw some cold water on some of the more naively optimistic here. I'll kick things off with [a chart from May 17th, 2014](https://i.imgur.com/FiSZygz.jpg) (original upload). The market was waiting with bated breath at the crossroads. Breaching the long-term downtrend likely meant the end of the bear market and rapid ascent to ATHs. The stage is set....
OK, one example. There's plenty more.

[Daily Discussion, November 20, 2013](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1r1eug/daily_discussion_wednesday_november_20_2013/).

The whole day's discussion is worth a read. Switch the prices around and it could have been written a few months ago. Too many potent quotables to list, but here's a few:

> Look at the bright side; this is only the correction on the way to 10,000 in 2014!

And:

> The sustained long term growth has been 1000% per year so far roughly. Considering most of 2013 was spend in the low 3 digits, I'd say 2014 will max out at low 4 digits (4,000 max??), and 5 digits (10,000) will only be seen 2015 some time.

> If current long term trends continue.

And:

> Also, the people who are talking about this being a crash...I think what we're seeing is natural growth. The bubbles that start to form are quickly corrected. Think about where we are now. Zoom out for christ sake. You guys are talking about $500 being a great buy in point...that was the ATH late last week. We're at $580 on stamp now... that would have been the ATH on MONDAY before the senate hearings.

> The hearings caused a quick bubble, followed by a quick correction. I think we've finally stabilized now that the exchanges/coinbase are working again. As a result, I expect continued growth

And then you come across some really poignant stuff:

> People have said that they believe this correction isnt over and will hit 200-300 (I think that we're done).

> I would say that even if the alleged bubble (which I believe is essentially over with) hits these sorts of figures, I figure the buying power at those prices will be immense. If you want to catch a bottom, then that's not a bad idea to buy, but otherwise...

> Given the technical data + recent news from china + november/end of year market optimism + general bitcoin optimism/greed + the fact that the market dropped ~60% in a day are all decent reasons to believe that this correct/bubble (whatever you want to call it) is over.

> I find it funny that the same people who aren't trusting of historical data also look to April and say that this bubble will take up to 2 weeks to play out. Things are different now, I don't see why that will happen.

> That's why I think we're done.

If I'm reading OP right, he's calling for an end to the bubble correction on November 20th, 2013...and thinks that two more weeks of correction is too long. I couldn't make this stuff up if I tried. 2014 was hard on many people, but must have been especially hard on this guy.

Also, read [this entire thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1r1eug/daily_discussion_wednesday_november_20_2013/cdilrgx/) for the coveted mention of "this time is different" along with all the same arguments we're still having to this day.

And this is all from *one day*.
I am saying this once and for all. 2014 is long gone and I very much doubt we will see anything like it this year or for years to come. There are many of you who stand to loose your money, your pride and even your sense of self by mindlessly predicting and sadly trading a scenario where 2014 is repeated. 
Look past your insecurities and trade with conviction. But please do not compare 2018 to 2014 unless you want to suffer from mental anguish when this thing paints new charts.


I bet I can sell this on craigslist for $8000 
https://i.imgur.com/G0eTlrN.jpg
if the value of bitcoin is spectulated based on rarity at what point does coins moving from large wallets imply buying demand versus selling demand? I see a lot of people freaking out about the mt gox wallets but if the talk of otc sellers drying up is true maybe accumulators are giving very generous offers to snag up coins without causing market frenzy... in fact wouldn’t the smartest thing to do to get coins without raising price be buying these closely watched coins and watching markets tank out of fud/fear while also snagging coins on exchanges? thoughts? hope I didn’t self my self too hard just curious what y’all think 
I just wanted to invite some of you to our community in Korea - day traders/investors on the domestic platform called Kakao. Ideally, expats and locals in Korea but got handful of people from abroad as well. Quality TA / no shills.

We're looking to balance our domestic perspective with those abroad. Sitting around 360 people. Sorry if this came across as shilly. Not sure where else to meet day traders interested in charting outside of Tradingview.

#Moon Math Update

I may have missed the window for a noob DCA series. A couple of canary indicators that will have me tossing in my sleep tonight.

### 1) NY Post claiming that Bitcoin is boring and has low volatility

### 2) This excellent contribution by new-to-reddit /u/stoic_fomo :

Shit.
I realized that I am the worst trader in the world, easily affected by fear and FOMO. I should have just held like the proper noob that I am :( ...
The 2h cloud has really contained everything for the last 24-48 hours. Just about to breakout to the downside. First target will be the kijun at 9k. https://www.tradingview.com/x/RpYyN7bW
Everybody ready for the traditional Friday afternoon BGD? One of these weeks, we're gonna get the MOABGD.

still long from 9470... This is the funniest ride ever.
[removed]
I don't think there's enough interest from retail to buy corn above 9k to sustain this for now (as evidenced by the declining volume after the last pumps)

Trying a short from 9250, we'll see.
Closed my 8760 long at 9350. I like that it's continuing the long term uptrend \- but the sudden spike up has me a bit concerned. I've had a few consecutive profitable trades, so much rather lock in my profit at this point. Possibly would look into another long if it dropped strongly.
Ha, go BTC go. [I was wrong!](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ezv0s/daily_discussion_thursday_april_26_2018/dy0glmc/) for now anyway. The market ran one of my profit taking stops at 8900 last night when it reversed on the [4HR TD9](https://www.tradingview.com/x/lT5XGBz5/) while I was out and has just ran the other at 9300. 

Still not completely happy we have finished correcting here would of preferred to see at least the 0.382 hit at 8.5k even if we didn't make my complete target at the log resistance line and the 0.5 @ 8.2k. Until we break the high @9.8k on large volume we *could* still be correcting, have to let the market decide now.

Since I don't know what the market is planning I am out of position sat in BTC. I still have a little bit of $ on the side to commit but without confirming the structure I have to wait before going leveraged long. [Here is my current chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/tWqbZTnd/) but it is uninteresting at the moment, just a couple of levels I am looking at but without confluence of signals I have no targets.

I honestly am happy to be wrong about last night, I still got out in profit and since it was not a full hedge of cold storage it is actually a more profitable for me to be wrong. It just sucks I have to wait now before I can commit to a leveraged long.
hidden bullish divergence on the 1h that is playing out right now:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/JGk0eUKh/

EDIT: also there on the 2h (but pretty weak)
Well that didn't blow through 9200 like I thought it would.  Still quite confident with my 9220 long though.  Happy Friday, everyone.
Critial level to hold IMO. Old log support line, then resistance, then turned back to support from 8.8 -> 9.8

https://www.tradingview.com/x/aqUnuzFU/
One of the most frustrating things in this game is being right, over and over and over again, and taking profits too early or getting faked the heck out and chopped to bits.

Felt reeeaaallllyyy toppy at 9300, so after deciding that even though I said Im done shorting BTC, scaled into a short at 9330.

Closed way too early when I saw a strong bounce off 9150.
Feeling bullish. Added to my position again. Dump eaten relatively well. 

Long from. 
: $8,777 
  $ 8792
  $9,122 
  $9,176 
  $ 9,201 

See y’all in the morning. Good luck and goodnight 
i nibbled a short here 1 CME contract 9355.. i don't short bitcoin ever but seems like a good spot

Doubled my long position here, just a little while ago. Fairly sure that 8,900 isn't going to break down and that this will log as another higher low. I'm not sure how much the sunk cost fallacy is playing into this decision, but the books were showing solid support at 8,900 and the bears elected not to test it.
Extremely interested to see BTC rally hard, especially after re-breaking the psychological barrier of 9k. As someone who trades largely off of market sentiment, I believe we will see a dominant BTC run, with Alts losing a bit of BTC ratio in the short term. As money re-enters due to a shift in sentiment, I think the space (in large) will grow over the next few months. As someone who has traded alts for the last 10 months, I have sold off some alts to reenter an unleveraged BTC position. 65% BTC, 35% ALTs currently. Good luck to all. 



Edit: Just for perspective, I successfully identified XMR, ARK, VTC, and SYS before they all showed outstanding raises in CMC ranking (growth %s). Check my post history. Always open to answer questions regarding alt markets!
No point in buying here, short term support has been broken. I'm waiting for 8.9k to buy back in, preferably even lower.
I posted this in the last daily thread but it was like 5 seconds before this new one was created, so I'll post it here instead and delete the old one:



____



If we get down to 9070, I'll enter a long from there, because that is where the 0.5 Fibonacci Retracement level is, that I have drawn from the February high at around 11,700.

What're some important tips to remember while trading on BitMex. I've finally decided to give it a try after considerable consideration. TIA. 
Would anyone open a long here? I got out of position so I could get some sleep and trying to decide if I should buy back in. 
On the one hand I desperately needed to lock in profits but boy do I wish I had at least left some of my long open from 8.9, would've been a lot more comfortable right now. Seems fairly precarious at the moment.
Scaling into a short between 9.3 and 9.4

This rise feels like a resistance check after breakdown from the ascending wedge that spanned from 8.6 to 9.4

Would probably bail not too far above 9.4, maybe 9.5

While we're all sitting around waiting for something to happen, maybe I can throw a few questions out?

I'm new to this and I'm just throwing some things together that I think make sense based on the very limited learning I've done of Analysis, I'm not real educated in what my goals should/shouldn't be.

Do you adjust your goals based on what the trend is?  If you believe we are in an uptrend, what is considered a short term position when it comes to trading?  Does that vary based on the situation?  Seems like it should be easier to grab a long position in an uptrend, and a short position in down trend.  Do you find yourself able to identify one or the other better and try to stick to those positions?  What kind of percentage gain are you trying to make in different trends/situations?  I have no idea what I'm doing, so hoping to learn some things to avoid.
price has been inside 2 hour cloud perfectly for 2 days now https://www.tradingview.com/x/CIOQqcVb/

Ok, short 9160 XBTM18 will close breakeven if it bounces.

Edit: Nothing to fancy this time HS break and 4H TD9 Short Entry in what I still consider a bearish environment (Opinion). Still feel we didn't retrace the bullish swing enough.

anyone use Deribit. Looking for some where to trade options
...and we're back over the daily kijun into the cloud! https://i.imgur.com/5N5EkNf.png

the bearish engulfing candle yesterday had me a bit worried, but I bit the bullet and kept my buys at the kijun (~$9k) and EMA 200D (~$8700) and it fortunately appears we bounced off the EMA 200-ish pretty strongly. edge-to-edge target is another date with the double top resistance at $11.6k--or, if you're on that hopium, the $12.9k flat kumo top (don't think this is that likely). if price maintains this range/goes up, we should be getting a bullish tk cross soon as well.

will be more or less sitting out for the next few weeks as this plays out (trade less, make more!) with my remaining fiat in laddered buys on lower tf support levels toward daily cloud support and stops below the cloud
Long from 9040. I might have missed the bounce but whatever. There's no leverage anyways. I think we have a lot of room to go up, 1h RSI is quite oversold.


Also, I think we can safely say that the rounded bottom did not confirm. Bummer. Hopefully we have more luck from here and we can get that Adam and Eve confirmed.


**Edit**: This might have been a bad call lol. But I'm not closing this just yet.
dump to what? sub 9k? 

my TA is as useful as tits on a bull
There is a small [H&S](https://www.tradingview.com/x/AKvdnzPk) forming that if the neckline is broken will result in a bart pattern (ish)

EDIT: Slowbleed and low volume

EDIT2: BROKEN DOWN @ 21:51:24 GMT+0200 (W. Europe Daylight Time) 
Hello weekend dip..
Note to self: stick to the plan.

Missed my 2nd target at 9.3, decided it didn't go as far as it should to set it as target, closed 8.8 long at my first target just above 9k.
so the Gox coins moved a couple of times and are now in this [wallet](https://blockchain.info/address/3DzSVk4veMCkNbNT9CdETeE26uWxmNbBnD).  this wallet is currently very active sending out ~0.2 btc a go.

fairly big deal 10% of GOx coins been sold
not too worried, this is just profit taking, still headed over $10k in a couple weeks
Caught a June futures 5x long at 8915. Setting breakeven stops since it's already above 9k. Hoping to maximize profit off the backs of panic sellers. 

This trade was mostly me front running the people frontrunning yesterday's low 

Edit: took my profit and got out. Pretty sure this whole recovery is a DCB and we will revisit 6k considering the lack of new interest into BTC as evidenced by Google trends. (Not a perfect indicator but overlay the price with Google trends data and tell me it isn't striking)
[Daily](https://bitcoincharts.com/charts/bitstampUSD#rg90zigDailyzczsg2018-01-28zeg2018-04-28ztgCzbgEza1gWMAzm1g7za2gWMAzm2g30zvzl) Out of the channel.  Long on all time frames.

[Weekly](https://bitcoincharts.com/charts/bitstampUSD#rg360zigWeeklyzczsg2017-05-03zeg2018-04-28ztgCzbgEza1gWMAzm1g4za2gWMAzm2g16zvzl) Break out to the upper side of the pivot.  Long on all time frames.  Last resistance at the bottom of the envelope ($9800) before FOMO.

TLDR;  Buy all the Bitcoins.
[removed]
Closed my long from 8980 (posted and deleted due to /u/joyrider5 sticky) for some fish tacos.

Bounce is not behaving the way i expected, green volume is poop and getting poopier on 15m. Expected to be staying above 9050 by now, but no dice. Looking more like a bit of consolidation before more red. 

Edit: Welp, there's my daily lesson on patience, i guess.
Are the chart formations that are relevant to linear scale typically relevant to the logarithmic scale as well?
Don't think it's been mentioned yet that the support held on the multi-lane channel.  Also the Sept 15th to Feb 6th support line is crossing there at the same point.   12 hr bitfinex: https://imgur.com/YaqCL7Y

Edit: Sorry, actually, zoomed in it looks like we still have room:  https://imgur.com/wSIc3Tr

Edit 2:  kiss that support.  https://imgur.com/FWRpsnX
putting stop in profit now that flag is trying to break to downside.... we are 5 mins from daily candle and expecting fuckery
Can a wedge this steep be considered valid?  https://imgur.com/bUOGU4x

If so it's about to pop, maybe one more candle can fit.  But of course the price has been doing nothing but popping in the last few hours, which effectively makes this wedge meaningless anyway.  Unless you trust that it will break up.
I'm thinking of cancelling my sell at 9.8, it looks like we will be hanging around 9k for a while and 1.2k dildo after 3 day of doing nothing is a thing that happened not to long ago.

9.3 being a local top after 9.7 doesn't make sense to me, thought poking 10k would be a thing
Shorting here

This old log support is getting pierced, it *could* still rebound off this but the daily stoch RSI crossing 2 days ago has ~80% of the time led to an extended bear run over multiple days despite the green daily yesterday (which lines up with previous stoch RSI crossings). Coupled with feeling that the rise to 9.8 felt too good to be true even to the bulls.

Ultimately expecting this to retest either 8.2 today or 8k tomorrow with some pit stops along the way which is our old log resistance trend line
Where are all the buy the dip people at? I finally went long at 9220 earlier today and I'm already under water. Bears owe me a beer. 
Closed my long with trade stack. ~15% down the drain. Hurts, but still slightly in profit overal. Could have been worse. 

Resistance on 9k increased 10 fold suddenly and I don't expect much buying pressure during the weekend. 

Opened a short x3 with 50% of my stack, will close if we move above 9.1k
Not liking the look of this: https://www.tradingview.com/x/FDfV4zGw/

Not entirely comfirmed and not the cleanest, but i can definitely see this playing out. I for one will definitely be hedging if we reach 9,1 again without blowing through it (or 8.8 if we get there first).

Per-capita long/short exposure data would be extremely useful.

Aggregate long/short exposure is much less revealing in terms of price influence.
well done bulls. very excited about that higher low. now it’s time for a higher high. get your moonmath donations ready 
As predicted last night, a weak bearish TK cross has formed on the 6h. If this becomes a crossover during the weekend, however, then there'll be some strong upside to come.

6h: https://www.tradingview.com/x/BK93N5x9
So the bears noped us back to 9.2k.  That's ok, i'll just add some more on this price instead.

[deleted]
Bullish so far how the market has reacted to the continuing movement of the GOX coins, seems likely that the 16k were sold now.

If it stays above 8800 after the weekend I will be buying back in.  

Market should be a lot healthier after the sell, it has been a black cloud over the market and that cloud just got smaller.
\[FUNDAMENTAL\] Been staring at the order book and the way volume is moving in relation to the price and I'm coming to the conclusion that bitcoin has turned into an online \(modern day\) casino, the type that novels from the 80s would write about when thinking of the future.  

Before I mention my conclusions from this thesis I want to mention what I've observed on four levels.

**DOM Analysis:**

To begin, if anyone stares at the order book from an exchange with plenty of volume long enough, they will notice that 70\-90&#37; of the trades are automatized.  And these aren't simple algos, they kick in when people are trading proportional to the volume of movement going on and have other strategies that I've noticed, such as spikes to fire stop losses, but that I won't get into because it's pointless \-\- as a human, your funds and computational ability will not exceed the exchanges and their machine and/or machines.

**TA**

Think the slot machines, people have developed strategies: convinced they could get money out of a machine when someone had played a lot and hadn't won.   So they always keep an eye out for these people and situations \-\- is that not what TA is constantly doing?

**Margin Trading**

The exchanges have enough funds to fill up with hidden orders both sides of the order book constantly, buying and selling all the margin calls and stop losses being liquidated.

**Fundamental Analysis**

Anyone noticed that bitcoin doesn't need to "scale" in order to work the way it does with margin trading through exchanges?  "Layer 2 will change bla bla..."  What's layer 2 going to do that will make it any more efficient that DASH? Ripple? or Nano? IOTA? \(no transaction fees\), bitcoin and tether are solid technologies that have found their vocation \-\- gamblers. 

**Conclusions**

The good news is that bitcoin's price will never go to zero since this casino will never be regulated and people will always remain convinced they can game their life to the moon. How? A combination of media saturation, changing the jackpot \(price of bitcoin going up?\) , and increasing/decreasing the difficulty of the machines trading.

The bad news is that the crypto market is tainted by this.  Huge institutional investors aren't idiots, they aren't going to place their money on a market that's centralized and manipulated with a casino model.  

The ugly will be the serious shit that goes down when the tech is good enough for legit countries with regulations to open exchanges and influence the price.

**Keep an eye out**

For noise.  News about stupid shit that gets you riled up \("4 idiots on twitter about to manipulate the market"\).  It's when they get you all emotional that the real important stuff happens behind the curtains.  

Price going up.  Ask yourself who is the person investing and why at that specific moment in time they would jump in? Would a company that's about to try out a new competitive advantage, and wants to be recognized for it so it can sell its new image want to exploit the shit out of their investment to get publicity? Or would they sneak in under the radar and appear as a giant green dildo on an exchange at like 10AM one random morning?

People that look like trustworthy individuals \*cough cough\* CZ.

That's all, have a good weekend!
As I sit watching a potential bull flag forming on the 5/15m, I'm curious: how many bull flags off of these barts have resolved correctly
Pretty clear H&S on the hourly (shoulders ~9300, head 9380, neckline ~9150), could be making a move to breaking neckline (and confirming) now
Does anyone here follow the videos of "coin mastery". Seems like a genuine and thoughtful guy.
stop loss hit at 9121.  bought back in at 9132.  Its looking like this is gonna reverse.

Looks like I won't be underwater for so long hopefully. :)

Was that dump somehow correlated with futures rolling over or whatever? No clue on futures Dynamics looking for education
Wish spoofy had the balls to go and do a 2000+ market buy. Now that would be interesting...
Short from 9366
To those who think April 27's $200 green candle was a "turning point": Let's talk again a week from now. I am not anywhere near being convinced that the post Dec 2017 downtrend has turned. We had a nice bull run since April 12, now comes another slump.
Is it possible to get both price and percentage scales (or any other percentage information) on the same chart with Trading View?
New to BitMEx: I am often getting the error that the system is overloaded and cannot change leverage or settle a trade. Is this normal?
What's the long/shorts status right now ?
Knocking on 10k's door. 

Are you planning on entering/adding long *if* the breakout appears imminent?
Ah. So obvious. I’m used to BGD too. Could also be BGD or BGP. I’m just a nice girl....
I still stand by my 10k 3 days rule, until then I am not buying back in.
You know what really grinds my gears? When you set a limit order and then the price moves between the time you clicked post and the moment when it posts to the engine, and gets excuted as a market order. I have now figured out how to fix this. Post an order at a different price range (furhter away) and then edit the posted order. The edit is a much faster process than the post, so you won't get executed as market. Will be doing this from now on.
looks like eth leading again? Am i reading it wrong?
Lemme know how that H&S is working out in about 6 hours for anyone shorting this or who just sold. See you at 9600.

Buy zone is approx $7200 to $7400 
[deleted]
the premium on futures disappeared so even though the price is recovering the future short at end of month usually makes $$

Did a yolo 25x long @9100, SL 9040 when the 2nd 15min candle was green and the first red had a big wick.

I'll probably be stopped out but the bet was quick reversal and not chopping lower than the big candle, it's not reversing as quick as the bet needed, maybe it'll bart but the SL probably cant handle a lot of bart hair anyway.

I'll just admit to myself that my favorite part is the gambling.  *shrug*  I think if I'm so willing to eat that loss and have a tight SL it's good RR? (shouldn't even try to rationalize)

I'm gonna lose online access for a little bit now, and not take this chance to close it now.

PSA: don't do this

Actually I have an existing long that will stop out a little bit lower that already took profit higher up, SL will lock in 3x the profits of the potential loss here on this gamble so I'm not risking realized stuff here.  It *is* a calculated risk and not a gamble.  Really ;)

*edit: lol all positions stopped when posting.  Overall green enough for the last 24 hours to be a satisfying balance to the 24 hours before that.  See y'all on the next round.

edit 2: reentered a normal 2x long at 9000 with 50%, not a full sized position yet. Will probably add to it at 8800.  Not sure if I'll keep it all the way to the next support after that at 8600 but certainly not below that.

50MA on the 4h chart has been holding up pretty well. Lets see if it'll hold through this dump. 

https://imgur.com/keqXtVu
You know what is fun? we are so used to barts by now that when it enters a feedback dump we all get ready for that bottom. 
If it's a 24 hour bart it puts us back to 8800.  Thoughts?

we're back to the 6am CST buy/sell wall and no volume.. saw this back in dec when things started getting weird.

I was planning to short the double top but if this recovery doesn't go past 9.3k I'm shorting early.  it might be a H&S on the 15 minute
the 16000 mtgox coins just moved to this [wallet](https://blockchain.info/address/3DzSVk4veMCkNbNT9CdETeE26uWxmNbBnD)    
still going to keep my long open because we reacted so bullish to the fud earlier, but if i see sudden 1000 coin sell walls im out :)

Last couple Fridays were consistent green. If you think it will be green again, you are crazy with the Mt. Gox and Friday slump looming over us.

Bart is some whale that got in and suddenly realized that his shorts are being eaten to a point that he had to dump it and we are back where we started.
Preparing a 100x. Short or long ?
[removed]
I wonder if those Goxcoins are being sold at we speak.
FOMO is dead. Panic is dead. This market has made it clear for a while now that sharp sudden movements in either direction mean nothing. Just another Bart, just another fakeout, etc. Not sure what this means, it's merely an observation.
bubble pop over
What exactly happened from 7k to 9.3k? I'm puzzled.
I miss the old Bart days.
Classic bulltrap. Textbook.

Bloomberg is speculating that North Korea is finally talking to SK because their foreign currency reserves have run out. There were many rumours that they were using Bitcoin. Does this mean that Bitcoin didn't work for them? Will they now sell reserves?
Made a right call but in the wrong direction yesterday. ~~Long~~ short from $8,735. Liq slightly above $10,000.
The chart with the red dots is all I needed.
I'll take scenario 1 please sir, thanks. 

Are you still in your long from the 8700s? Hanging onto mine for now. 
Excellent write up.  My only quibble is how you've drawn the log line from 2014.  In the immediate short term, it's interesting to compare how breaking the log line affected price in previous bubble cycles.

[This is how I've drawn it](https://www.tradingview.com/x/IrvEfKML/)  

If this most recent break from log follows suit, it should have us in the ~$13-14k range within ~2-4 weeks
Do you think what happened in 2014 is more context dependent (mt. gox hack) than market-cycle dependent? 

Or maybe it could be related to the diminished influx of "new money" in the market? There could have been enough  people that sold during the crash with the intention of buying the bottom, and enough people to join the rally when the bottom was seemingly in, but not enough new money (and too much people disgusted by the mt gox hack) to carry this beyond the failure point.

It will be very interesting to see how this plays out, as the crypto market has considerably more institutional investors than in 2014. I also think the altmarket will be crucial as it's much more interesting (at least psychologically) for new retail investors to buy "cheap" alts than to put money in a bitcoin they see as expensive. 
so basically if 10k isn't broken soonish we are in for a retrace to 8k
So what's you're saying is either go long x100 or short x100 ? 
Ok, see you on BitMex then!
Congratulations! That truly is a big milestone. Many would have given up in frustration, but you persevered. Kudos!

The good news: your initial losses are what we traders call "paying tuition" to the markets. You are hopefully now wiser commensurate with your initial loss, having learned many valuable lessons in return.

The bad news: *tuition fees are ongoing*, and on a pay-as-you-go basis. The market has many fresh lessons to teach, and even worse, some of the things you learned and are doing right may stop working (or work differently) tomorrow. So stay humble, stay nimble, and stay sharp!

I wish you the best of luck.
FANTASTIC

Now, in all honesty, its probably good to start trading a little more conservatively from now on. Easy come easy go, right?

If it was me, I would consider this a massive success and refrain from trading with my whole stack from now on, only what I’m prepared to lose... say 10%. But then again, maybe you are less risk averse.

Well done good sir. I raise my glass to you
Impressive.
Great. Oeps you forgot to name me?- LoL
wait what, Dushman is banned? that guy deserves to be in OP's list, surely there has been a mistake?
Well done, man. Truly makes me happy for you. The fact that you were successful over the last two months is applaudable, considering we've gone from 11.7->6->9.8 in that time. Means you're trading the trend and not marrying positions.

I simply urge you to not try to go bigger and bigger. Honestly, I'd take 30% of your stack and send it to cold storage, assuming you're a long-term believer. Then keep trading with the 70%. As soon as your mind starts thinking "I can keep doing this and make so much money" -- you'll lose half your stack. As the great Han Solo said, "Great kid! Now don't get cocky!"

Speaking from personal experience there. 

Good luck, man.
That's amazing. I'm way too emotional for trading so I don't. Of course in hindsight it always looks easy to 'spot the top and bottom', but while things are going on I find it very hard. Congratulations on breaking even!
good job mate
If you trippled your stack in two months and won't stop trading, you will lose all. Mark my words.


Nice job on making it back, must be a great feeling. I'm hoping to feel the same way sooner rather than later. 
Congratulations, CryptoNoo!
Congrats mate.. really motivating story. Very well done indeed. Now pls pls make sure u don’t get greedy or over confident and lose it back!! 

I am very much in the same boat at the moment. After losing a big chunk making a streak of stupid trades during Feb/April crashes, I am now looking to somehow break even. That’s my first and only goal for now. I have been really patient over past few weeks closely following the price/discussions but not feeling very confident to enter new positions (specially leverage ones) unless it’s a really safe trade. More than happy to take small gains for now to slowly build back up. Any tips/advice from this great group would be welcome...
Pretty much echo your story/sentiments exactly except my trip started a month later and will break even shortly. No leveraging or dark arts for me tho. Feels pretty good already, must feel even better where you are. Great effort, congrats... and yes, thanks all here for sharing. 
I think writing out my tea leafs and how it compares to stars could be a little dull for this sub. Are you sure I shouldn't just post?
I assume we have a time window to add reasoning later? Sometimes its important to get the info out so people could follow if they wish. Just working on the reasoning for mine, but these charts don't draw themselves :D
Love when people actually count all of the data to help escape confirmation bias.
Add 1 more to bullish cuz WE ABOUT TO MOOOON 
Very interesting.  Thanks.
> TA is extremely prevalent and useful. Why? Bc there’s thousands of traders basing upcoming market movements on what they’re seeing in the markets. Self-fulfilling prophecy? Very much so imo. 

Especially if you can consider multiple signals and formations, you're more likely to catch the whole of the aggregate behavior to move with the market more effectively.  (IMO) 
>The current state of cryptocurrencies is almost ENTIRELY speculation based

Huh? I'm here for the politics of it
Never mind the fact that it is traded 24/7.  Trying to go back to traditional asset trading is torture now.  
  
What do you mean the markets *close*?
My SL is 9030, same thinking.
Is this [wedge](https://imgur.com/a/ncezjjM) a valid pattern to follow? Seems to be reaching the apex so will soon find out
What's your opinion on the [blue line](https://www.tradingview.com/x/UvcnOCYR/) here? Also mentioned by /u/midnightocean. It seems we are testing it as support right now
Basically what I have as well. This is an ideal bullish scenario mid-term in my opinion. Lots of room for volatility while still maintaining an upwards trend. If that bottom channel line can hold for a while, we'll be in biscuit city. It will almost surely break in the coming days though, as it puts us over 15K by the end of May. I'd like to see it hold up to 11K in early May before consolidating in the 10200-10800 range for a while. 
I like this 4 line version.

Now I see that you could even further subdivide the upper region as well, which I'll do and see if it holds up as a resistance in the future if we get there.

Really beautiful how orderly this is.  It's almost like the *moonmath rainbow charts.
damn, you're scaring me. i'm long from 9177 and wondering if i should just bail now if we're going to visit 8.8, because i'm not sure we'll bounce up from it this time if we do revisit it.

maybe i'll wait to see if 9050 holds...
Did you do a market stop or limit stop?
I hedged my 6410 short at 9100 and bailed from my large long position on the bounce to 9030. Hopefully I don't get burned on that, but a retest of channel support (I have at 8850) feels likely. 
kicking myself too, now we almost back to ATH's.. (real all time highs not old bubble highs)

oof
welp... that was quick!  Will wait to see how far this dump moves before re-entering
except for the BGC, this is exactly what I would expect a recovery to look like
Although I wonder whether the indecisive creep up would have been even slower / not at all without the BGC providing some dutch courage.
Side note, to protect privacy and bias it's best to report the % of wallet being traded, not the actual numerical value of the trade.
I was making a bot to make trades based on the top users of the bitcoin flair game,  but people stopped really doing the flair game so I gave up on it.   That was in 2013/2014 though. 
it would be possible to make an app that you can trade with that uses an exchange's API and leaves a reddit post at the start and end.  It'd be a lot of work to make it support all major exchanges though.  It would also need to be open source because it would need you to enter your api key from the exchange.

A reddit bot could read a page and update a comment when you press a button, but it wouldn't know when the trade ends or which trade to post without setting a lot of specific configurations.  It wouldn't be very useful for posting real time trades.
Someone made a bot that tracks when Chew posts a trade, I guess that’s in the same ballpark 
The 3rd point shouldn't be automatic. The user should state that the position was closed/liquidated and the value at which it closed. I for once will change SL values a lot depending on the market. 
Other problem is that i can have a Long on USD and a Short on EUR, others here use Swaps, Futures, etc so you needed to specify the trading pair so the bot can keep track.  
!long XBTUSD 9215 0.1 2x -sl 8986 
then  
!long XBTUSD -close 9200 
or !long XBTUSD  -add 0.2 9010 
or !long XBTUSD  -profit 0.1 9010 
!long XBTUSD -sl 9200 (to update SL) 
and so on. 

Like [/u/veltrop](/u/veltrop) said, the 0.1 should be a % of the stack being used and not the value.
That way you can calculate the % earning / losses of the entire stack. The value of the stack is irrelevant.

I would definitely **not** use APIs to automate the process, it would only raise suspicions even if its open source.
This is doable. I'd probably link it into Watson to do a reasonable job of parsing the various formats and sentiments people use to share their positions.

Anything can be done with an unlimited budget. I wouldn't trust the quick and dirty version of this to have much accuracy or consistency.

This requires a long conversation.
Hi, welcome 
Man I feel ya.  If I could change a few key decisions from 2012~2016...

Edit: I'm also on a mission to reclaim my original holdings. Though I lost them not through trading, but cashing some out at 2013 silk road bust, and bad altcoin investment in 2014, and from then to 2016 by spending it to try to get back in the black for the coins I bought at 1000 of which the cost by then outweighed the remains of what I had bought at 10.  Worst is the coins I spent right before the current bubble cycle started, thinking that that was the highest price we would ever see again at 600.  
yo!
Were moving up very cautiously.  That is not a bad thing.
Apparently people only want moon or doom.
The chart is why people are getting gun shy.  I just flipped over to a short position. 

when's this dead dog gonna tank?  I wanna load up at a good price like 2-3k.  It's obvious it ran outta steam hours ago.


bubble unpopped

Yes consolidation between 9.5 and 9.3 for a few days would be nice, but I'm wary of the FOMO
I'd be much happier with a big dip before the weekend.
Scary when you realize water isn't wet, water just makes your skin feel wet

$3k incoming
Well, many if not most of the "common people" have already passed through the bagholder stage and have already been shaken out... (new ones, not old bitcoiners, of course). 
These 'institutional investors' will learn the hard way not to swim with the real btc whales who are building very large positions for years now and who built (and own) this bubble.
Anyway thanks for this post... I was starting to have doubts but now I'm more confident we will see new lows this summer! 
So 82&#37; say it has bottomed, yet only 47&#37; think it will be at a price above $20k by end of 2018. Interesting.
Hmmm the subdivision within your wave count is very hard to find/agree with. Specifically: wave 1 and wave 4 (and it seems wave 3 would end being the shortest impulse wave if wave 5 goes extended to your target?)

I have a different count and am almost certain wave 5 topped out at ~$9.8K (which yielded a near perfect 1:1 extension of wave 3 according to my count). Following on from that we're now either in B wave of wave 2 ABC correction or still in A wave of wave 2 ABC correction.
Personally, I plan to end up in a jar placed in a hole in the bottom of the ocean. 
Absolutely. Death is the only guarantee, so live well and meaningfully. 
The ultimate capitulation
Buy before it pumps and sleep well.
It’s counterintuitive how hard profit taking is. Should be the easiest thing in the world but damn, greed and ego are something else. 
Nice timing. I did the same with my long from 9,130.
nah they're feigning weakness to trap the bears.
target is bellow 9000, around 8950 or so
Does the candle have the close on the 1 Hr to confirm the H&S? Couldn’t we bounce from here and it would only put a wick down to the area, making it invalid 
Yet per-capita longs could quite possibly be at an all time low.
it is however quite likely that the bottom was 6k, or at least 4k+

20k to 4k is an 80% decline

Even though I agree with you that nothing is different this time around, one thing is abundantly clear: the magnitude of the dump is also not different

If we drop to 1500, that’s a 93% decline, and let’s be honest.... that’s at least a little exaggerated, no?
[Relevant Medium Post](https://medium.com/@DonAltCrypto/bitcoin-and-why-i-think-the-downtrend-line-everyone-keeps-talking-about-is-overrated-2a94468c75f8)
It is different (for now) because if it were not we would have broken the 60 week EMA in early april and dropped further down. In 2014 it hovered over the 60 EMA for weeks before totally breaking down. We were very close now, and it didn't happen. The daily bands (moving averages) in the model I use are turning up for the first time since they rolled over mid january, we are now firmly above them and another big move towards high 10k -11.7k would place them back in the correct order, so no it's not the same. It could always become the same, but that's merely an assumption and it would be very stupid to trade on just that assumption. 

I'm going to say it again but something like a long term downtrend line is rather worthless because you can easily go through this line by just going sideways. You can draw it in several ways, it's not 'pure', it's subjective. Many people will come to a different conclusion, as is always with sloping trendlines. 

Upvoted. Here’s my question to you: The 2014 bear market fell 86% from ath. At that time bitcoin had much less tailwind than it does today. So if this time is the same, do you personally think we will also bottom at 85-86% of 20k, or bottom a bit higher (and how much higher to reflect the tailwinds we now have vs 2014)?
Downvoted. Simply because your still clinging on to 2013/2014 repeating itself. Fair enough the previous Bitcoin bubbles were similar BECAUSE market conditions were similar. Bitcoin existed on the fringes back then. Now with futures, wide scale media coverage globally, the likes of soros and co entering, institutions being forced to enter the game too because Binance is eating their lunch, Nasdaq, hands off approach by all western regulators. And much more to mention leads me to conclude that your argument is like standing in the face of a full blown hurricane  while predicting it will run a certain course because a much lesser hurricane ran that same course a few years ago. Reckless.
This time will be not be different.   But which route will it take to the bottom?

I don't get why people compare 2014 to 2018. That was a whole different market and time. Market cap has 40x since then, crypto exposure is very high, alts are pushing the market forward in addition to BTC, crypto is on the agenda of G20, billion dollar crytpo hedge funds are out there and many more. Please, tell me one good reason why 2018 market must follow 2014 without being circle jerks about it.
2014 literally almost ruined my life.

But I dca-ed, and held, and life is turned out ok after all these years
Your on track to being named "The 2014 guy".

2018 has already proven to be much like 2014.  No one but you are saying they had to be 100% identical.  Those who did not compare 2018 to 2014 lost 60% of their money, so great job there.

[deleted]
The Wall Street journal recently posted an article comparing Bitcoin to baseball cards. Claiming how it’s a “ fad “ and tend to get boring after a month or 2 of collecting. Then you forget about the cards / coin for a few years to find out they are extremely valuable in the future 
BTC already reached the moon, and it almost certainly isn't going back.  It was an incredible achievement in human history, but it's likely over and done.  

Without the evils of humanity, BTC would be over $20K right now, on its way to $100K.  But it's been banned in China and India and much of its use has been banned in the EU and USA.   It isn't going to be allowed to get much bigger than it already is.  It just a sad truth that many do not want to accept.
I think it's a good idea to have a trading stack and a holding stack if you ask me.
over time you will learn how to flip a coin for heads or tails and make trades with the same success rate as the rest of us

I think you learnt an important lesson here. You can’t grow without learning. It’s what you do with that that is the important thing. Well done on the self reflection, you could’ve taken the easy route and just avoided it and be doomed to repeat the same mistakes. 
Make moves before they happen. Not after! Never short in a dump. Yes, sometimes you can do well for yourself. Most times you’ll just sell the bottom and hate yoursef for it.
Really interesting to me how the 15min through 2hr cloud all seemed to have supported this drop.  And that most of the time frames also have the cloud giving support at a very flat line at 9200, which is also prophecized by fib and other TA.

Perhaps this isn't out of the ordinary for ichimoku.  In the past I didn't see it being so consistently prophetic in multiple time frames, but I only checked it out a few times and got scared off by the complexity.  Have only just started looking at it seriously in the few days and am impressed.  Especially when I saw some confluence with TD.

Or the MOABRD.
[That's why I'm here](https://i.redd.it/qi6bg5qb5u601.jpg)

I'm actually starting to think that we might not get anything substantial today.  Might have a bit of a consolidation period for the remainder of today and through the weekend.  Then come monday or tuesday I could see a jump.  Still holding my long for now though.  If 6pm est comes around and nothing has happened, I'll try to close it at even/small profit and look to open something sunday night/monday morning.
we need excitement.. up or down dont care.  this is like trading.. bonds.. we got a bond market man.  where's our money badger?

Expecting a further drop here, based on the chart.
Thanks was a good read!
balls of steel
And I am short from $8,735. Our expectations and objectives are exactly the opposite of each other. lol. All the best!
How many days have you been drowning? 
he’s not permabanned, just on vaca.

And let’s show some love u/DushmanKush. Maybe he’ll be more excellent next time.

Also, he was heavy in BCh, so maybe he took a real vaca this time around ;)
Not the Hero we want, but the one we need. :D
Dushmankush and chewtoy couldn’t be any more different but are my favorite two people to follow in this sub for very different reasons lol 
Why was he banned? I didn't think he was bannable. Not like that Odbdb guy, I'm amazed he made it as far as he did.
just no
Looks to me like payday buys are happening, but I could be wrong.

Also, good luck with the short.  I wouldn't get too greedy, especially on a Friday when people are getting paid and OTC shorts get covered.
now there's a buy wall there

I think I've seen about 75% of TD9 play out (though this one here didn't actually confirm so don't think I can count it).  It seems like such a reliable signal for non-small timeframes.  Though my sentiment might all be confirmation bias.
Are you suppose to ignore wicks when looking for divergence?

give it time

we’re nursing the Honey Badger back to health woth little pieces of fruit and drops of water one at a time.

Let’s just get to the moon, doesnt have to be this year. Honey Badger still exhausted. Give him some space.

As long as we hold above 8500 from now on, I dont care what happens.
Still a nice trade, more than a scalp!
Seems to be breaking up. Only thing to do now is watching...
> even though I said Im done shorting BTC, scaled into a short at 9330.

So you admit you lied then...why should we believe you now?   
You run the risk of overtrading. Common mistake is to add to a position when you should be moving stops up and/or taking profits because of gambler/winner psychology (greed). Of course, these could be small amounts on low leverage but the fact remains that the more you drag your average buy-in price up, the harder and faster you'll get hit if/when the market turns against you. 

edit: and it will turn against you


I believe we will test 9700 level again before descending to 8700 again. Got my short orders waiting around 9700
I sold my long at 9350. Still medium term \(june, july,aug\) bullish but set a buy order at 9000, 8900, 8700,8500,8000.  Have some lower ones too but they're not important.

My plan was to hold the long for weeks but it jumped faster than I thought.

So here's hoping that we both win \(a dip\).

By the way what platform do you use to trade CME?
Man, the sentiment is all over the map right now. I’m 50/50 until a break happens. Volume has been low and it feels like the slightest breath of air can push it up or down right now. Targeting limit sells in the 9600 range and buys in the 8650 range. I expect us to remain within that range over the weekend and have no desire to trade the chop. 
What's the CA now?  Thoughts on how low you'll let this go?
A bit premature, but I hope you're right. Can still see this going down to 8.7k, and perhaps even lower if this is all just one gigantic DCB from 11.7k.
is this spot or margin? fuckin a about the support. I'm a simple man, i have seen enough buying and the recent bounce back up to 9.3 to convince me to buy and hold my spot. I am more convinced it wont be unprofitable long comparing to couple of weeks back ranging around 7k.
first voice of reason in a sea of bear posts
IMHO 9K is/was not a “psychological” barrier.
[removed]
9070 should have a bit of support, it it gets bellow then yes, 8k9 should be next in line
Attempted Bart thwarted.  I still have a limit order set at 8750 but starting to think we might have put 9k in the rearview mirror for good.
Sounds reasonable.
Always always always set stop loss
Don't use 100x leverage.
well the biggest and most common mistake is your risk management isn't at the level to handle high leverage trading. Most likely you started on zero to no leverage ie spot trading for a period of time -- you probably have done alright swing trading higher time frames where the precision of your entry wasn't extremely important and now you want to move up to the big boy table. Well first and foremost margin/futures trading (especially on high leverage) is not even in the same game what so ever -- yes the basic mechanics are the same but now you have to be very very precise with your entries because when the trade goes against you it will get real painful real fast. I see this happen so many times as newer traders get lulled into a false sense of risk management security that they can handle higher leverage but end up blowing themselves up not because they weren't ready but because they have been training themselves in a way that creates not the correct habits. Trading spot you can be entirely wrong with entry and have essentially infinite time to eventually be right -- even years maybe. With high leverage trading you have to be quick to accept your loss and move on because one big move (or even a smaller move depending on leverage) can wipe you completely out. 

Start with a very very small balance and blow up a few times to see what I mean. 
That BitMex is where the whales play.

Breaking 9,200 was a long signal for me. Although I'm playing it differently this time: Monero seems to be lagging behind lately so I bought some to trade back for BTC. Slightly riskier, but going long here for BTC has a good R/R if you ask me.
I would wait for confirmation that 9250-9300 acts as support
The way I see it: we are at 9350 at the top of a potential Bart back to 9250.
i would maybe open a small long here and scale in on dips, but im a degen fomoer. just make sure you got a decent stop
you can open a long anytime before 40k/100k if you're willing to hodl and happy with only 2-5x returns yearly

A number of questions here, and the answer to *most* of them is: It depends.  

Most of these are trader-specific and not hard and fast rules. Goals should be flexible and should always be malleable based on what trends the market is showing. The danger to this is feeling like spontaneous decisions are okay. They are not. You should have a plan based on trends and market criteria, and you should execute that plan if the criteria play out. If something changes, stop and re-evaluate--don't just do something differently off the cuff.

In general, trading the trend is the important X factor that comes with timing intelligent entries. You can find good risk/reward entries for long or short positions in any market, but in an uptrend, the edge goes to the better r/r long entries than the better r/r short entries. Opposite is true in a downtrend. 

The best traders here try not to identify as bearish or bullish, but most do have some internal bias, however small. Recognizing that in yourself and identifying what your bias is is extremely helpful. Divorcing oneself from that bias entirely is not possible but, at the risk of sounding existential, knowing your strengths/weaknesses and trading rationally rather than emotionally is the most important and the most difficult part of being a good trader. I still trade emotionally some times (a la "screw it, short 8960" last week), and I usually get wrecked on those. Part of why much of this sub looks up to chewtoy and holds him in high regard is his enviable ability to remain extremely rational and outside the forces of FOMO, at least to a higher degree than the average trader (by like 5 standard deviations). A lot of traders can pick a good entry, but most then get married to the position and/or chase it. 

As for percentage gains, this is entirely up to the trader. Scalping works for some people--it doesn't for me. When I open a trade, I generally am looking for many hours to many days or even weeks as a hold, and I usually have a rough target based on trendlines where I'll consider closing, but the percentages can vary widely. I have a long open on september futures from 6410 since 4/1. I'll hold that till settlement on 9/30 if this trend continues. My long from 8750 has stops just over break even, but my target is at least the next major resistance (11.7K), and I'm not looking to close there unless we're summarily rejected back to 10.8 (as of now).

Hope this is somewhat helpful. Just one trader's take. 
Depends on what timeframe you are trading on. I'm a swing trader so I make 2-3 trades a month at most, but the rule I follow is the trend is friend. When I say that, I am referring to the overall mid to long term trend, short term trades imo are high risk high reward trades because ultimatly they tend to go against the main overall trend so it's easy to get caught in a bad position if you don't keep up with your trades.

Here's an example of one of my trades I made recently with ETH (I have BTC, but the gains from ETH ha's been better at least currently). 

Sold the rest of my ETH when it was around 920 and didn't buy back in until 410 (this was after we spent a week or so in the sub 400 zone and started heading back up). Still holding on to that position currently, I do use TA often, but I find fundemental analysis (overall market sentiment) to be important also when looking at the larger trends. This sub remained bearish longer than other subs, but followed suite not to long after

So my advice, wait for confirmation of a longer trend, take a position, and stick with it. You might miss out on the absolute top or absolute bottom, but you will certainly make up for it in the long run. Look at all the people here who went short in the 7k to 8k area only to close their position at a loss, yes some had great timing and made some extra money, but many could have done better if they just stuck to their position. It all comes down to your risk appetite in the end and how greedy you want to be. Longterm is lower risk but has lower returns compared to someone who can time the short term like a beast.
If you're surfing you take whatever waves you can get, but only try to ride the ones that are favorable to you. You can't choose how far it'll take you and it may wreck you, but you can choose when to bail.

So set targets based on where you think the market will gain or lose or shift momentum, and choose your risk level and manage your risk.  But don't trade based on profit requirements. 
> Do you adjust your goals based on what the trend is? If

My only goal is to trade as well as I can....which leads to making more profits or losing less money.  That's it.

And there are times when 1% gain is a huge victory and where a 15% gain in minutes is a major defeat and you screwed up terribly.  And times when a 3% loss is a big victory as well, etc.  It just depends on the situation and market action.
Is this suggesting in the next few hours it would drop?  Indicated by the red cloud?
I've been using an altered cloud setting at 30 60 120 20 I heard from a friend in mid 2017.

Seems to be mentioned in article too: https://hackernoon.com/my-top-3-favourite-indicators-for-technical-analysis-of-cryptocurrencies-b552f584776d

I'd be interested to compare the two clouds long term accuracy.

Do you find default settings to be highly accurate for yourself?
Heh, pretty good advice from ichimoku then to have not traded the last two days.  Starting to really like this indicator. 
how to interpret it? I'm not familiar with this cloud graph
Id say the rejection off 70 is bearish and that were due for a pullback, but we were also severely overbought on the lower timeframes.
below 30 rsi on the 1m through the 15m. 

It's likely your breakeven stops will hit.
Echoing chewtoy. Breakeven stops are for when your position is already a clear winner (>2% market movement) and you're willing to risk all the profit to let it ride. When you open a position right away, you gotta give it space. 9215 is probably the tightest stop I'd consider on this. 
This dip is not done yet. Let's see what the next red 5m candle volume is.

In any case, we have made a lower high now and short term does not look bullish to me. 
Yeah I think I read somewhere that he wasn't allowed to look for his hard drive. Really sucks.

I signed up through a VPN a few months ago and browsed around a bit, but it appears to have very low volume and liquidity.
I'm not sure where you are looking at the chart for the 1H oversold, but at finex its not even oversold...
Don’t chase or force yourself into a trade (we just bounced $100+). Let it come to you (and if it doesn’t that’s ok!)

What’s your TP and SL?
9150 is holding as support for now. 9K horizontal support probably wouldn't hold unless we could hold 9080-9100. Channel bottom is 8800 right now.

Bears should have shorted >9300. Where to long depends on your outlook. Optimistic bulls should have taken 9150. Pessimistic bulls should hold for 8850. 
That sounds extremely useful, consider the milk market if every birth resulted in a milk producting cow, it would drop the risk of a birth by a ton.

Hard to say but the Gox coins are almost surely getting dumped right now. Tojo lied about not selling anymore until September. 
Looks like I picked a great time to go long!
[/u/skiptomydoo](/u/skiptomydoo) mentioned it some comments bellow
im calling this a consolidation H&S with a continuation and a breakout to the upside. market sentiment is relatively strong and we just had a pretty big breakout from 8.8k to 9.1k yesterday. think bulls are going to try hard to keep BTC above 9k.

we'll see though, i mean the pattern will complete by late afternoon if you're looking at a HS on such a small time frame.

edit: looks like me and simres right, HS broke down the neckline but rebounded really quickly and the bullish trend continues.
Can it break below the neckline which would make it go under 9k again?
how else are we supposed to pay for our mounds of coke? Gotta sell some coinz
a little ahead of schedule too

This always, if not plan B aka stoploss
Bury head in Sand and pray its not dumping - Thy.Bulls
Well that escalated/changed quickly..
Nice scalp. 
Okay but can you use Trading View?



Edit: But yes I agree.
Time to get liquidated.
It is behaving the way I expected.  The permabulls will likely have a very rude awakening and then blame everyone else for their losses.   And not lumping you in with them, but just saying.

(And for the record, I hope we don't drop to $6K or lower.  It is less money for me if the price drops.  I have most of my money in alts and can't short them as effectively as BTC.)




expect a 300$ pump any second now dudes.
yes
Exponentially more so ::wink::
Broke now right?
It can fit 2 or 3 more candles if it drops to the support line and starts shortening the range. But a descending wedge should break upward and is trying to. Breaking down such steep wedge only if it goes vertical

You may want to cancel your sell at 150.8 as well.

I'm thinking we bounce off of $8600. Seems like a solid enough support. 
Agreed.

Notional value of outstanding positions is much more important.

Maybe I'll build something for this.... hmmm
Just a few days ago we were having trouble cracking 9K so they can nope us all they want.  The trend is clear.  Seeing another sexy rounded bottom here as well.

The coveted 9200 support. 
They were likely sold OTC... Meaning no impact on market price. 
While gambling and speculation are very important factors behind price action, I have a feeling that you're missing the big picture (and have a bias for some new CCs) going all the way with this analogy.
I agree with the casino analysis. Why else should bcash have doubled when nothing changed about it fundamentally? The market is controlled by greed, fear, and ignorance rather than a careful analysis of fundamentals and a search for value.
About half. Same for bearflags. Early on they resolved correctly, then some fuckery, now it's a toss up
This isn’t your typical “ textbook “ bullflag”, it’s these weird bullflags we have been having during BART season that slant upwards.

During serious BART season 2 weeks ago, generally the bullflags would break down and bear flags would break up. 

Recently, the flags have been playing out more or less how they are supposed to. Minutes the bearflag yesterday on the 30 min/ 1HR from 9100-8750 drop wound up breaking upward with a BGD 
Target would put us back in the 8.8-8.9 range again, lol

Yeah I watch his video every evening while cooking dinner. I find him pretty unnofensive and his take on crypto news is usually pretty thought provoking. I like that he's become a bit more trader oriented recently too. 

Wwwwwwwassup guys!!!
He seemed like a nice guy until I signed up for his newsletter and found he was shilling Teekas Palm beach newsletter which was the biggest pump and dump rip off shit I ever seen which completely turned me off from him. He said it himself his goal is to make $50 million and he doesn't care how he does it, whether it's through commissions through shitty affiliates or what... but with all that said, his advice isn't bad in his videos. It's just the shilling from the e-mail marketing REALLY turned me off. Not that he gives a shit what I think, of course.
But why? You set a stop for a reason, why jump back in instantly? 
Peace is good for business.

much, much more longs than shorts (if I am reading that right) like 1/3 more and they are going in to more margin just to hold the dumps. this can only end well
There's no volume, I know it's not a popular opinion here but I think it's just being dragged up by ETH and EOS breaking out. 

Closed my short at a small loss because of it, upside is uknown really but I wouldn't count too much on a BGD here.
Select post only sir 
BitMEX does not have a "post-only" option like Bitfinex? (with this, an order either enters the book -if only for a split second-, or it gets deleted if you would have been a taker otherwise).
That's a tried and tested method. Otherwise select 'post only'.
That’s stupid, you got your wanted price.
no doubt this will retest 9700 or 710 \(ETH\) again, there it will be make or break time
In my chart ETH is leading BTC on finex, but some other altcoin could be the real leader.
Looks more like EOS leading the way. 
Seriously, not sure why anyone is shorting this. I'm 100% positive it goes up from here. 

This will be free money. Thanks for the cheap coins, bears. 

Easy. 
k
These dumpers are really losing their mojo.  Very little effect on price for some very expensive market sells.  It's almost like people want to take the free money they're handing out every time they do this.
Looks like for once it played out perfectly. 
Can confirm. I watch these charts more than the inside of my eyelids :)
Bears are going to discover the true meaning of pain in the upcoming months.
Gonna need a time machine for that one I think
How about this.... Ill sell you mine for that today but ill even give you a $100 discount for buying it early.
> but the breakout has been rejected (lagging span) and were back in ~~the~~ a cloud

>There's space for this to be a bull flag with an upper target of 9.4k, but ~~the~~ a base line is about to drop.

[FTFY, just returning the favor ;\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8f8uou/daily_discussion_friday_april_27_2018/dy1ppcp/)
I have no idea what a 'cloud' is, but we are clearly on the way down from April 25 high. 
well that was quick haha
That was short lol, sorry
that was a tough one.  the 15 min green reversal candle looked legit.
Are you saying that the discourse has improved or that there is actually less fud?
At what price are you going to finally buy? $15k? $25k?

I'd hate to see you starve holding out for $3k. Bear or not, you're a human being who needs to eat.
It may fall lower than this.
Unlike the HUMONGOUS volume on the dip. You bears are so delusional it's hilarious.
If you were so concerned about it you should have looked into it yourself and then traded accordingly. I don't rely on this sub for my trading and niether should you. 
Feb 25th MACD was about to cross too.
Dude, first, it’s at least 2 days out from crossing, could be 5, could not even cross. Second, it’s an unreliable indicator. Look at the last cross upward — stayed up for 3.5 days then crossed back down. Finally, it lags.

In my experience, MACD has very little predictive power, although it can be helpful post hoc. It is essentially a low-pass filtered derivative, so when you are trying to predict its crossing, you are essentially basing your prediction on a mentally estimated second derivative based on this slow crappy 1st derivative. Hopefully that should give you s sense of how easily your proposed method can go wrong.
> Thanks for putting your heads in the sand guys. 

Did you forget where you are?
If your points are well made and founded - and with charts for TA like this - then you'll eventually be listened to. This is a pretty big sub nowadays, and things can get lost in the flow. Don't be so quick to anger. :)
I thought the current Gox coins were sold off until next court decision this fall, was this some FUD I missed? thanks

Short here, just added at 9312. CA 9339
Both \- so you profit both ways.

The market is deeply undecided. With any luck, traders are losing interest and a few smart OTC investors will start to DCA in with smart money.
lots of liquidations
Could you be more specific? 
short squeeze and then people wanting to sell higher
Whales re-engaging after taking the spring/winter off.  Time to go up! At least for a little bit, maybe for a while.
Barts are just a way to shake out buyers/sellers and were impossible to trade off. Unless you enjoy people getting rekt I hope Bart is having an indefinite detention at principal Skinner.
You actually *miss* that bullshit?
Patience.
Could be a bear trap too.  Seems like these big dumps get weaker and weaker each time in terms of how far they move the price.  This current one has moved it all of 50 bucks.

If you were setting a bull trap, you wouldn't let the price drift up 30 percent over a period of weeks.  You'd pump it up 10 percent in a day to incite FOMO, then dump.
Guess i was wrong.. those two BGD wasnt a bulltrap ey? 
Salty fuckers.. downvotes wont turn back time. Its a normal part of this business. I also took the hit. Relax.
This is neither excellent nor what we do here. He could also turn out to be roght, don’t forget. It’s still a lower high for now.

The man made more money in the 6500 range than we can ever hope to trade up to.
Dude, that's very undudely of you.
I feel really bad for him - he's nice. But hey, it shows that his kind of speculators also mess up at times. Keeps you kinda sane.
Everyone trading on those short time frames is basically gambling, why do you care about his position
He sets stops, like any reasonable trader, and is most likely stopped out.
unfortunately many of the shorts who became so rich will soon go broke, because they will keep trying to short.  Unable to help themselves.  I popped my cherry in the 2008 financial crisis that way.. losing everything i made.  I know the psychology.  Don't question why or advise them.  Don't wonder how can anyone be betting against the run.. they just are.. it's a fact of the markets.  Just bet against em, and show no remorse.




Cool story. You might want to read the sticky on this daily.
I don't like what I see at all, too. No volume, chart painted by bots, basically we're at the mercy of the casino and there's little reason to think it will go up, but it will make sure to chop and make everone confused as much as possible.
Jesus Christ this is so unbelievably stupid
you just said their reserves ran out

what will they sell? Hopes and dreams?
> There were many rumours that they were using Bitcoin.

I doubt a normal nation state would be able to function solely on Bitcoin, let alone North Korea.

It's not like any other world government is going to accept Bitcoin in exchange for good or services.

Even under international trade barriers, it just doesn't make financial sense.
Or it could be their nuclear test site collapsing and the unreported fallout from within.

But yeah, sure thing Bloomberg.
I can't even imagine how one can hold a job at Bloomberg while being capable of this stupidity. Ignoring the challenges of using Bitcoin in a country without consistent electricity, the impediments to trace for NK go far beyond the available currency.
Lol, you could describe every bad trade this way.
Will you go for liquidation or will stop it earlier? The deciding level here should be around 9k8? 
I know. I gave the BGD a run for its money after seeing that lol
Yup. Isn’t it ideal 
Yup, still holding it. Will consider abandoning it if the market drops below $9,000, and will definitely abandon it at breakeven.
My analysis is always divorced from underlying potential causes of the movement. 

So I really don't have much to offer in regards to whether the Mt. Gox nonsense caused the market to behave as it did.
The market basically has an infinite amount of time to stay in the range between $8,000 and $10,000.

There are no major support trend lines or resistance trend lines that are converging on the market right now. So there's nothing keeping it down, and there's nothing propping it up really either. 

So no, there is no market imperative to break $10K in the short, medium, or long term. 
Yeah, i think you are absolutely right. Will atleast decrease the leverage (was trading 3x-5x, but always with laddered entries and a kinda tight stop loss underneath/above). 
Precisely. Don't trade it all - put a significant chunk away. And to the OP, well done!
What really helped me in not being too emotional was that i only invested fiat that i could absolutely afford to lose. Of course, it absolutely sucks to lose money afterall, but it really helps your mind if you do not need the money right now.

Just say so in the post then that you'll edit it soon. 
careful there cowboy
RIP IN PEACE
It certainly has sufficient contact points and development window. Interesting. Adds to the reward side of a short position here. I'm not about to close my long, but I'll keep an eye on this. Good catch. 
It's got a few points of contact. Probably at least as valid as the red one I drew. We've basically got 4 perpendicular trend lines going here, which is pretty bizarre. They're all upward sloping, though, so I'm fine with flirting around any of those lines in any order as long as we don't drop out of the bottom of the channel. 
Fib lines and trend lines are amazing to me. Also, someone posted a BTC chart yesterday with all possible MA lines overlayed in different colors that I would legitimately put on my wall. If we moon someday and I take a massive payday, I will canvas print that in 20x48 for the office wall in my mansion lol
Good idea, just added it to my chart. Something like this? https://www.tradingview.com/x/sZCoRiGK/
I'm not trying to scare anybody, but the market has already given up more of the gains between $8,800 and $9,400 than I was expecting. 

If it breaks below $9,000, I don't see much reason why it wouldn't keep dropping.
I always do market stops when I set actual stops.

I'm not about to lose my whole trading stack to liquidation just to avoid $20 - $30 per btc of slippage.
If this holds that'll be be too bad - your stops just barely got triggered!
BGC is definitely understandable given the significantly higher volume of high-leveraged yahoos shorting over previous recoveries. Shorts were higher than longs at 6900, and that was *such* an easy target.

(which I got caught in)
What is BGC?
Yeah that's what my gut says too.

But I think it was inevitable that at somepoint a fakeout would end in either a BGC, or a rapid chain of bull pennants covering the same distance.

If it happened at 9k instead of the beginning I wonder what would be happening now.  Ultra-parabolic and panic I bet.   If a 8.7k to 9.7k BGC did a full retrace, 75% of the posts here would be calling for 3k.
No way in hell would I give a reddit bot an api key to a financial service.  Even if the key was setup for read-only, that's still asking for trouble.
[deleted]
I'm not a coder, but I imagine it would be quite difficult to parse whether I've opened a position and where precisely I did so just from my comment history. 

I imagine the bot is instead merely tracking whether I've made a comment or not. 

For example, how would it differentiate between the following two comments:

"**Long from $9,300**"

vs

"Earlier today I considered a **long from $9,300**, but I'm not opening a position right now."
Lol do you have a link to said bot?
What's so concerning about the chart?

RSI has calmed down on medium timeframes and there's a massive amount of room to the upside before it becomes an issue on the 3d and 1w. 

While there's danger of printing a lower local high here, there's just as strong of a possibility that the market will print a lower local low as well and start forming a consolidation triangle between $8,640 and $9,750. 

And of course there's the possibility that the market will continue rising here and make a higher local high above $9,750 before sellers can dump this lower. 
I could see this dropping down to 9100 or so, but I don't see a downward trend here.  We are already at 39 RSI.  If that falls much lower I think we are going back up, and I think that if 39 holds, time will bring us back up.
Sure, the market will go to 3k just for you to load up. do you want a VIP notification to go with your order?

PS. I am 99% sure u wont be around crypto if it goes below 5K
[deleted]
You guys are dreaming if you think BTC will hit 2-3k
short the FOMO if it happens
You just shook my understanding of the foundational aspects of our universe to its very core....

It depends on what the definition of "wet" is, and what the definition of "is" is, and...I have to go. If you need me, I'll be in my contemplation chair, silently weeping.
> Anyway thanks for this post... I was starting to have doubts but now I'm more confident we will see new lows this summer!

I know some people probably think I'm a permabear with all these posts...I'm not. Just trying to be a reasonable about where we are price- and speculation-wise.

So with that in mind, I wouldn't go all-in YOLO 100x short off of this terrible article. The article is biased, but has nothing to do with whether we'll see new lows or not. I just thought it was funny, the same way that a "82% of Bitcoin haters and skeptics think its fair value is below $1" would be.
> These 'institutional investors' will learn the hard way not to swim with the real btc whales who are building very large positions for years now and who built (and own) this bubble.

I also don't know who I'd bet on in that hypothetical showdown. You have to keep in mind, the holdings of any one of 99%+ of crypto investors are a fraction of what a hedge fund guy would spend on a good night in Vegas, let alone as an investment. If institutions got serious about this space, they could build up positions to rival those of LTHs pretty quickly. They'd just have to throw $500M instead of the $5,000 some guy threw at Bitcoin in 2011....

Plus, a lot of the bigger holders are quasi-institutional themselves. Think Winklevoss, Draper, Novogratz, etc. Sure, there are some like Ver, but I think the techy/libertarian/anarchist/cypherpunk millionaire LTHs are becoming an endangered species.
Yeah, extended fifth waves are rare... the market is highly leveraged, which makes it technically possible. The fifth wave pretty much depends on the confirmation of a C&H, which has a target that stops a few hundred short of 38.2%

I decided to exclude the inverted bart because I believed it was unrepresentative of the market. I qualified it as an internal consolidation wave as part of a trend reversal. That's a good observation to call me out on, though.


Then I cant sleep because I will worry about it dumping. I prefer to close manually using alarms. I don't like using stops. I have been stopped out by long wicks one to many times. 
Yes, very well said. Looks like I also made the right move; we just fell down to 9280. Pure luck on my part.
closed at 9299 , open from 9022 after reacting to last night's breakout.

this seems to be slumping back. sells are being bought up nicely for now, but if this really turns down here, then we have made a lower high compared to 9700, which would either be bearish, or point to a consolidation phase around 9000-9100 levels.
More likely than not, there's no overarching strategy here.

Buyers are merely waiting to see whether sellers will continue to push the price lower or they'll give up.

Sellers are similarly waiting to see if buyers will push back here or they'll give up instead. 

Pretty much exactly how the market constantly plays out.
That's a pretty narrow window for success.

From the neckline to the target is just around 2%. 
Yeah but it closed now so it's confirmed it looks like. Oh well, it's a small one anyways.
Well...that's a tough one, but yeah, you make a good point.

Napkin math, from the $1,175 high to the absolute $169 low was a 
~85% drop. Taking that high to $250 instead (because the $100s were basically just two flash crashes), we still get 78%.

So, to your point, buying in the $3-4k levels (assuming parity) seems like great risk/reward from a LTH standpoint.

But there's one thing that gives me pause. See, during 2014, there was this ironclad cargo-cult thinking (that I was as guilty of as anyone else) that *Bitcoin never goes lower than the last ATH*. In that case, ~$260. As we bled out and got closer, people got worried/excited. It was a great time to buy! Bitcoin *never* goes lower than the last ATH (we had multiple past examples as evidence) so this is it, bear market almost over! Then....well, we ripped through $300, sorta recovered, and then really started plunging. And that's when I think the real capitulation and despair really kicked in. It was palpable. Bitcoin was dead, LTHs selling for pennies on the dollar, etc. etc.

That sort of thing is the reason that I can't entirely rule out $1.5k, as ridiculous as it sounds right now. Heck, that's even higher than last ATH still! Not saying it will happen...chances are, it probably won't. But it can. And "Bitcoin never goes below XX% from ATH" just sounds like the same sort of cargo-cult stuff, even though it's convincing from a probability perspective. It doesn't, and won't...until maybe one day it does.

So, not wholeheartedly disagreeing with you or anything since you do make a great point. Just a cautionary tale of sorts.
Shucks, if I'd have known about this one I'd have saved my breath! He makes the case much better than I did, good reasoning and nice charts to boot. Makes me sound like the drunk guy rambling at the end of the bar in comparison. Thanks for linking it!
Yeah and I was bored a few days ago and I looked to see how many days it took to get back to previous all time high after a bubble pop and this is my results:



**2011 Bubble**: *94% decline*: DAYS TO RECOVERY: ***631 DAYS***



**First 2013 Bubble**: *76% decline*: DAYS TO RECOVERY: ***211 DAYS***



**Second 2013 Bubble**: *85% decline*: DAYS TO RECOVERY: ***1,181 DAYS***



**2017 Bubble**: *(71% decline???)*: DAYS TO RECOVERY: ***???***


___


This isn't really the most useful data, but it does point out one thing: Each bubble pop lasts for a way different amount of time. Ours could be twice as long as the Second 2013 Bubble Pop, or it could be a quarter as long. No way to know for sure.
I appreciate the reply and the argument, but I'm not sure how to respond constructively since I don't put the same weight in TA indicators that you seem to. And I don't want this thread to turn into a pro-TA vs. con-TA argument; I don't think it's worthless, there definitely is a method to the madness and some good insights to be gleaned from indicators...I just don't personally use anything other than candlesticks and volume, along with support/resistance levels. Maybe occasionally bands, but that usually just tells me what I can already see on the chart anyway (volatility is dying down).

So, respectfully, I think the generalized counterargument to "indicator A, B, and C are different, therefore this time is different" is, "indicator X, Y, and Z are the same, therefore it's the same" combined with the "history doesn't repeat, but it rhymes" maxim we've been touching on. That might come across as overly dismissive; I'm not sure how to phrase it better. But even among EMAs and MAs, I'm sure you could tweak the parameters and time periods to fit the ABC vs. XYZ argument. So, I think that you're right insofar as the path we take this time will be different than last time, albeit in superficial ways (different indicators hit or not hit, different peaks and valleys touching different support and resistance lines, and so on)...but all that is mere detail compared to the bigger picture (bubble pop, market cycles, human psychology).
It's not yet clear whether 20k really was the top; at least the 'mother of all channels' suggest differently.

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/nRFcRpU0-BTC-Mother-of-All-Channels/

We could be in a 2013-like phase and the real top would be late this year or early next year. In 2013, BTC went from ~250 USD to ~64 USD. This matches the current ratios quite close.

EDIT: Fixed 2013 prices
I think that's a really good question, thanks for asking it! /u/L14dy touched on a similar point below in regards to percentages. I think the tailwinds argument is interesting. My take: you're right, objectively. We have an order of magnitude more of a lot of the things that count (mainstream media coverage, users/traders, Google trends, institutional investment, etc.).

But, here's the kicker: the price is also an order of magnitude higher now. As we know, generally speaking it's a lot easier to get an asset from $0.10 to $1.00 than it is to get it from $10k to $100k, due to the inflows of capital that would need to be involved.

So, we have a much larger army pushing the boulder up the hill; but the boulder is also a lot heavier than it once was. Is the army stronger than the boulder is heavier? Maybe, maybe not. I'm ill-equipped to answer the question, and I guess in a sense answering that question is what the market is actively doing on a day to day basis.

As for percentages, I'd be foolish to give any concrete answers since I just don't know. My gut feeling is, it'll be similar. But, we'll still be surprised. The "history doesn't repeat, but it rhymes" saying is one of my favorites, and readily applicable here. So in hindsight we'll see many similarities to past bubbles and bear markets, but with some surprising twists (it'll bottom out higher/lower, or take longer/shorter to play out, or something else).
First, downvotes are for spam and off-topic posts only. It's not a "I disagree" button. You're being a jerk.

Second, your ignorance is matched only by your hubris. Your argument, weak as it is, is *exactly* what's being referenced in my post, and in the great Medium article linked in one of the replies. Your entire argument boils down to "this time is different because this time is different," which is the same argument we heard in 2014. It *was* different in 2014 (record adoption, media coverage, etc.). The resulting bear market was not.

In short: fundamentals are different, news is different, adoption levels and price figures are different. *Human psychology and market cycles are the same*. So this bear market might be longer or shorter, lower or higher, but the specific differences people trot out to explain why we're on the verge of a breakout is pissing in the wind compared to the human psychology driving the price.

One last thing:

> Fair enough the previous Bitcoin bubbles were similar BECAUSE market conditions were similar.

You're only saying that because I assume you weren't around for those. They were all very different from each other, with different news, levels of adoption, fundamentals, etc. There were people like you for each one, proclaiming "this time is different!" They only blend together in hindsight, and because of the market cycle pattern. Ironically, you've just made my argument for me.
It seems you're confusing 'different' with 'larger'. The market is larger, the price is higher, there are more participants. None of that explains why the overall market cycle should behave any different than before. That's what the OP was referring to, I think.
This is all great for traders and people familiar with the market. I think it’s safe to assume a majority of new retail investors have no clue what the implications of any of those differences are. Those such individuals primarily react to price action. 

Although, it could be argued that with enough traders who are willing to buy based on these fundamentals that it could be the catalyst to draw in those new investors. 

I think that is what will eventually happen, but that requires a lot of faith to be restored in the market, which may (or may not) take some time, considering how this bubble popped fairly recently and how so many people got burned buying at the top and sold or those who are now “hodling” at a loss.  

As far as news coverage goes, I can only speak from what I’ve personally seen, and what I’ve seen on mainstream media outlets is mostly misinformation, or poor coverage on price action.  I do agree that having the limelight can be beneficial, but it’s only really true when that moment comes when Bitcoin or any cryptocurrecy reaches it’s adoption phase on a macro scale. (being adopted by the likes of Amazon, Apple, Google, etc.)

While the fundamentals have changed and become vastly improved, the fact still remains that human psychology is the only constant in the formula which will remain unchanged as markets mature. 
Bingo!

Great charts by the way; hadn't seen those before. Thanks for linking them.
because bubbles, man. That's really it. if the fundamentals are so different why are we following the charts so incredibly similarly?

All the gox stuff happened in early 2014. Why did we keep dumping all the way to end of 2015? 
There are more participants, but the market has also grown relative to the participants.  The technology hasn't actually really seen a ton of new adoption since 2014.  The vast majority of people are just using crypto to speculate on its price.  

Just because there is more money involved, and more people involved, does not necessarily mean this time around should be any different.  No one is storing their files on Storj.  No one is hosting any meaningful applications on NEO.  IOTA is not helping your refrigerator order you more eggs.  It's all conceptual ideas with no proven need.  

So one would say the reason today is similar to 2014 is that people are simply jumping in and speculating on crypto currency.  The price is rising because more people are investing, not because more people are using the technology.  So really, it's exactly the same as 2014, just with more people and more money.  Percentage movements still can play out exactly the same.
Because market psychology trumps news and fundamentals in the short/medium term (days/months/years). Fundamentals only set a baseline, and I'd argue that a) that baseline is a *lot* lower than the prices we've seen in the past 6 months and b) we can even dip below that baseline due to overly bearish sentiment (followed by a "return to mean" which is basically a return to the baseline supported by fundamentals).

Speculation was, is, and remains an incredibly large portion of this market, for better or worse. So the sentiment of speculators (traders) is much more important than whatever bullish news comes out. And the sentiment of "we're still in a bear market, sell now and buy back in lower later" trumps "some new BTC ATMs got installed" or whatever. That's why you saw all those posts in 2014 along the lines of "Expedia just adopted BTC! Why is the price still going down?!?!"
I don't mind that at all. If it tempers peoples' expectations and maybe prevents a few from losing money, great!

I hope you're prepared to keep running your site during the next 3 months to 3 years of bear market, through declining viewership, ad sales, etc. (and I hope that it doesn't come to that, but it's something you should be prepared for). I mean that sincerely.

Also, if you're publishing stuff...maybe learn the difference between "your" and "you're"?
Took a look at your site and...it's actually not bad. I appreciate what you're doing. Logo is very nice. Layout and intro is good. Loading is slow, and AJAX loading would be a nice addition. The iOS icons are a little gimmicky. The content needs to be fleshed out and given some CSS love. But it's a solid start; keep it up!
Yeah, exactly right! I was surprised to find the "this time is different" talk at that point, before things *really* popped; I expected it only in 2014 for the most part.
And corrected later to 600$
Read the entire day's commentary before spewing a bunch of crap. There are many a few (including you) who expect BTC to go sub 6k so their 2014 wet dreams are fulfilled. I'm saying we WON'T see that range and an ATH will be achieved this year. 

New Slogan: 2018 is NOT 2014.
yeah frankly it's pretty bullish that they are selling otc and not on exchanges now
Ah sorry, I'm an avid lurker here as well. Just to engage in our community I mean. We are trying to aid beginner investors and act as a hub for our domestic whales to talk shop. Got a good event on margin trading this Sunday for the crew... so if there are any locals in Korea or anyone wanna come from abroad lol, we're just welcoming good people in.

https://www.meetup.com/CryptoofKorea/events/249733063/
its just a curved trendline...  usually they dont matter a ton but this one does touch down in 6-7 spots so I think its useful.  This would be about 8th~ touchdown, except looks like we are breaking it unless we bounce like RIGHT NOW.
It's a fancy way to say that volatility is dropping. Looks like a less discriminating measure than BBands. I trust it less... but I've been worried that weekly BBands aren't going to contract before we rise again.
I have a huge book from the late 80s and early 90s. All the cards are wrapped in plastic. I've assumed that they're worthless.
Uh... well... that's just like, your opinion, man.
If you watched the SEC hearing, it hasn’t been banned in the USA. The SEC was just cracking down on ICO’s because the majority of them tend to be a scam. There was nothing but good news that came from the hearing. For example, the coin CHAT was recently found to be a scam and the owners were arrested. If anything, that’s good for crypto. The NASDAQ is considering getting into crypto, J.P. Morgan just hired it’s first employee solely to focus on crypto, financial advisors advise for their clients to allocate 2-5% of their portfolios into crypto, there is more news than ever about the USA supporting crypto in the future than there ever has been before. 

This is only the beginning.. see you @ 100k.  
I think that bitcoin going to the moon and bitcoin becoming worthless are both plausible, but your argument is straight up terrible.
This is not the moon we're still on the launching pad. Where did you read that it was banned in India and China, and why would that make a difference? You think rich Indians and Chinese won't use Bitcoin? Anyone who cares about preserving and the ability to easily transfer their wealth will use Bitcoin, banned or not.

If you don't buy a little bit now, there's a very good chance you will regret that decision for the rest of your life. 
yeah bitcoin's no secret anymore.. those who want to buy have already bought.. those who havent by now.. never will

Lol. You can't truly stop Bitcoin and people will continue to yearn for decentralized blockchain tech whether or not govts attempt to stymie it. Democratic governments are beholden to these very people and it's hard to see some governments even taking a stay at it because of how unpopular that would be. This is becoming *more* true with time, not less.
You're right! Thanks. However, it *is* tough to hold for a long period in these market conditions :(
Thanks for your kind comment. But the hard truth is that the whales' patterns are ever changing, and that there is no safe place to bet. I feel like whatever I "learn" is just result-oriented i.e. looking at the answer sheet and being like OHH, every time :(   
thank you!!!
...but that’s exactly what Bitcoin *wants* us to think!
And how did that work out for you?
HAHAA..... Are you waiting for a break-even? or u gonna keep your short hoping it will go even lower?
since 24th.....
Just a scalp, targeting to close at 9k even if it gets lower, tight stop in case it doesn't tank. Was out of the market and not interrested to open a long here, which I'd switch to if it tanks to say 8.8 (will start to DCA here)

Overall bullish, but 9.2 is not a dream entry. 
I find the TD9 Signals useful when combined with other targets, I don't trade them blindly since the final resting place of the 9 reversal (if they play out) can often vary wildly. If I see the price approaching a target and a TD9 coming up this gives me a high confidence trade.

I use the 4HR and daily chart signals, its good to play about to see what timeframe works best on different symbols but I don't just change timeframes to find a signal, I stick with those. A signal across different timeframes is very tradable. [Example](https://www.tradingview.com/x/RhAzEqr5/) on eth played out like [this](https://www.tradingview.com/x/pkgd84z7/) and I traded this short at the time for a easy $70(10%) move.

Edit: Example of signals in the last run up https://www.tradingview.com/x/S7GbAwSq/ you see we pushed through one of the four 9s but the other 3 got pretty close to the local tops.
Pretty sure RSI goes by closing price, so yes.
RSI only counts open and close values so the wicks can't be used (from what i've been reading here)

1.5% is a scalp, haha 
agreed. not going to get killed overtrading this
No excellence detected.
lol, you again
Yup, always be greedy at the beginning of a move, not the end. Has helped me a lot. If I'm not comfortable entering with a big position, I probably shouldn't be entering. 

Of course it's okay to scale in to manage emotions but it should be more top/bottom heavy if short/long. too many people add more later 
Yeah I’ve definitely been over trading. My positions above 9k are smaller than my main position’s sub 8k. I’ve moved my stop losses so I’ll still make a decent profit if we get to that level. I need to start making 1-3 entries instead of just buying dips. 

We will see what happens 
If you think we're going to double top off 9700, you have the wrong flair, sir. That's a ticket to bear city. 
IB.. still figuring it out though.. margin requirements are weird.  Thought i would be able to buy/sell a lot more
That's a sound position. If I could go back in time, I probably would have stayed out of this trade. I'm flirting with a consolidation phase that I'm basically gambled against.
Stop loss at 8,400. It's already more than paid for by the 10x long from 6,600
That's an opinion, too. Sure.
Very low margin. I'm being my own creditor. Effectively spot.
That is definitely a fair opinion. Breaking 9k was not my main factor in this analysis, far from it. It was just one of the many bullish points which has brought crypto back into the conversation, both in personal lives and on the news. 10k is the true "back into 5-figures" psychological barrier. I believe with how many exchanges have scaled to accommodate new users, (along with many other bullish developments in regulation) the timeframe until 20k might be even shorter than last year. 
I totally disagree. We spent two days chopping over and under before a clean break above just last week. Holding above 9k is important for bulls.
Altcoins thread is [over here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ezv20/altcoin_discussion_thursday_april_26_2018/).
Even when you’re “out of a position”

Stop losses can turn a bad trade into a good move or a “Im out of a position” into a short.

You will most likely get wicked and lose money that you shouldnt have had you not set a stop loss, but that SL will save your ass more than that
Thanks for the tip. I would've definitely done that. Just picking your brain here, what're the stops and profit margins for say a 20X trade? 
disagree -- the best way to learn is to start on 100x leverage with a very very small balance to establish good risk management habits, cut losses quickly when the trade is not behaving quickly and to be much much more precise with your entries. Probably going to take 3-5 account blow outs to get a handle on what the person is doing wrong and how to correct things then one can move down in leverage and has a much more solid base to handle leverage with the prior experience.
Derivatives markets generally outgrow spot markets. Not sure if 'whales' is used correctly here, although I'm sure many spot whales do hedge on 'mex.
Sometimes it can be worth it.  But this is not one of those times.
Great, i can go long soon. With tight stops and profit stops @9500
This would be for my trading stack. I have a separate hodl stack. 
I like the response and it's appreciated.  I knew my questions were vague and probably difficult to answer, but you at least gave me some stuff to chew on which is kind of the goal.  Thanks.
No thats not how cloud works.  Here is a cheatsheet on the cloud: https://i.imgur.com/UjPzwRy.png

Right now it seems we may kumo break upward from the cloud but waiting for volume, higher high, and/or 2 hour close to confirm.
April 20th had a similar red cloud on it.  And then btc exploded.  

I have no clue how these clouds work though.
I'm a big fan of Josh Olszewicz's 24/7 modified settings but no I don't have them on right now. I have been considering switching to regular settings permanently since I think they have been performing well since december.

Also should note I never take entries or exits based on cloud but I do keep it on lightly colored for quick reference of trends.
Higher time frames trump the lower time frames IMO
The price could also collapse here in which case I've got a head start of adding to my short entry later if needed. I just can't help lean bearish still so I don't mind playing the hs pattern here but I appreciate others are bullish I would rather not. If it bounces, nothing ventured nothing gain.
Guys geez, its not like the market does not have precedent for [completely collapsing in one death candle](https://www.tradingview.com/x/xwcWRIJ9/). I use a stop-limit on index to try and anticipate these movements, because I don't have a good structure at the moment I am very cautions with the trades. They either move quickly away or I get out.
I agree, that's why still holding some but it's important to ladder profits and pay yourself just in case. 50 percent profits on 100x is already 5x my risk so no matter what this trade made me money. Expecting some bearflag action here for now. 
when through a vpn?

do you know of any other sites that trade options?
My bad. I was looking at 1h Stochastic RSI, not regular.
Of course, I figured we might go higher, it's been down a few minutes though, not a big deal right now because I think it will go higher soon. 


I'll take profits at 9200 or so maybe... or whenever I think we are gonna go down. As for stop loss, I'll sell at 8900 probably. I don't expect this to be a very quick movement in either direction though.
Got in a cheeky little short at 9.3 right before it fell off but 9.2 seems to be holding well so far, might close it and open a long. Would seemingly confirm 9.15/2 as support.
[deleted]
If the dumping of coins is barely moving the market from 9350 to 9100 then that's a good sign.
it's selling .3 and .15 bitcoins every 120 seconds or so.. its obviously a TWAP bot dumping coins at about 20btc/hr.  This is what he meant by 'not hurting the market'  lol .. if u space out your sells and minimize slippage, it wont force the price to go down... or so im sure he says. haha.



9 downvotes on your post.  The hodlers here really try to suppress any bad news, but it ultimately doesn't work.  

This isn't "FUD".  This is BAD NEWS.
Excellent time to go long when Mt. Gox is looking to dump 16,000 BTCs.
Keep in mind its very small and the aftermath is not a huge leap down nor up. but id say if it breaks down 8.9 ish is to be expected.
Would you happen to know the cheapest exchange that I can use stop losses on in the USA?
well the 16k is all ready dumped, now the effect is the buyer wont be buying any of the rest of the supply so it may push market down.

Although it is only a small % a one days trade so market may hold strong, and now there is less GOX coins on the horizion. if price hold strong over the weeken it could be a great buy point
That is what they always do...well many of the hodlers and permabulls, at least.
Yeh we might test $8.5k but I didn’t want to risk missing out of low $9ks
Wouldn't expect anything less. ;)
5 min zoom https://imgur.com/rQ4G9uf

Not quite...
Looks broken out.  15 min has tested the resistance as support too but need a higher time frame.

Anyway, even though it broke up, it's not big so we probably won't go far, and we only have to go a little bit sideways to fall out of our ascending channel so this wedge isn't so great for a signal to enter a position, other than that we aren't breaking our of our channel *now*.
150.8 is at least a month away if you ask me
Im going to need it at this rate. :(
I closed my 9.7 short at 9.1. Send food and bottled water 
Wanna throw some BTC my way?
Hmmm, i can see an argument for that, but i find the strong base around the 8,8k area too obvious of a horizontal support to not take it into heavy consideration.

Also looking at it from a daily timeframe i feel makes an even stronger case for it: https://www.tradingview.com/x/OX8hrAVs/
Agreed. We might be charging up for a run to 11.7k resistance. 2014 behaved similarly. Broke the log downtrend from ATH, retested it, then went up to test 700 range but it lost steam in the 680s.
I'm not sure how you'd obtain this [typically proprietary] data.
A tiny part of me wants to push that slider to 7x and add the margin in while I can keep CA under 9K, but I'm resisting the urge. 
the only way this would not affect the price is if the OTC buyer would of only bought from the GOX cache.  there is now 16k less buyers this weak, but people are still selling, miners, profit takers etc.

Price may not fall but that just means that it would of gone up without this sale.
It does impact the market price, just not so violently.

Every OTC buyer is one less buyer on the exchanges.
Well, that's not entirely true. 

If they were sold OTC to buyer(s) who would have otherwise bought btc on exchanges, then the coins would have removed some of the demand from the exchange market. 

did you look at the wallet? at least some werent sold OTC.. too small

Right now for me to have a bias on a CC, I'd have to:

1\) Be convinced their tech solved the scaling issue.

2\) Be convinced they found a way to mitigate price volatility.
Why did BTC go up as it became less usuable and too expensive to move around? 
Unit insanity; the general public have the economic knowledge of a child who thinks 5 penneys is greater than a dollar. Otherwise why does the shitcoin market exist?
And I suppose this one is firmly in the incorrect pile!
Do you think the odd reversal of flag behaviour was due to the prevalence of the BGDs? So the market reacts irrationally to traditional TA formations?
I'm seeing a drop more to the 8,300 - 8,600 range. 
That matches the support line from the local bottom @8600 so it wouldn't be strange
Also, ETHUSD isn't showing that and it's been leading for the most part.
neither do I, till it's confirmed, just pointing it out
Yeah I noticed that from his newsletter as well. Makes me wonder if he just hired someone to manage that side of his “brand” or whatever. 
the big green reversal candle tricked me!

Remember when bulls were in denial from 20K and every dump was 'the bottom'. This is where the bears are now. A state of denial. 
There were some comments on yesterday's daily thread to that effect. April 12: I wish it were a turning point. I want to believe the slump is over, but I'm not convinced.
Price was up nearly 50% from the low on March 5th as well.
[removed]
$8,300.
Right click the scale and choose percentage - that information.
And they want to launch mobile app, there will be more users...

Hope they fix it soon.
Yes you can.  You must have stops/limits in place or you'll be fucked.
Closing position using the limit close or market buttons in the "Open Positions" box are counted as priority orders and have a much higher chance of going through and not getting rejected due to overload.
But because of the nature of longs and shorts, the natural ratio is around as 1.5 longs for every short. Because longs are much less risky. 
We're seeing sudden bouts of rapid high volume lately, perhaps primarily algo-driven.

I think this phenomenon is more likely to persist than subside.

The volume could strike at any time.


I don't understand, why do you look at the volume here?

I'm comparing to the previous breakouts, when there was no volume before the fact either. Volume only happened during the breakouts; or one can see it after the fact. But volume itself seems useless to indicate the next move.
yeah, silly me. My bad
lol, that's my bad. I never realized that's what it was for. Thanks man. Checked that box.
I don't think BTC reacts to the price of ICO tokens.
My chart is showing ETH slightly before.
yeah no
but mah' head and shoulders meme!!!
This growth isn't like the last few days. Happy in my longs right now.
while I definitely agree this seems very out of line. yadayada only a sith deals in absolutes yadayodayada
I do think this will hold but I don't like to say I'm 100% positive with anything in this market
I could see shorting here, but not based on a small H&S on the 1h.

The whole pattern only encapsulates ~2% in market movement. It's far from a slam dunk r/r profile.  
Imagine being a shortcel from 9.7. Lmao at bears. No but seriously this should bounce hard above 8.7 (probably 9k) or there's about a 70% chance it's a DCB. 
I know you're joking, but, yeah, pretty much.
Time machines work in the future too. So you really think he's that hasty to go into the future to buy at that price?
I’m just zooming out and looking at the linear trend line - nothing more complicated than that. Works pretty well though. I think this is the last hump though. Expecting 15k+ by July/Aug
So you’re selling yours for $7100ish? Deal. How much have you got to sell?
Lmfao
You've been RES ignored for sometime now. You use a modified system but you fail to mention it in your posts. It spreads confusion and reflects a lack credibility. I use the definite article because I use the standard settings; you're using modified settings so it's appropriate to use an indefinite article. If I ever stop posting in this sub it'll be because of people like you. Do everyone a favour and grow up.
Hah no sorry needed.  I had my fun to break all the rules.
Eh, I could rationalize, but it would look the same if a bear pennant was forming.   No way to tell how far or when something will bounce either.  The only potential thing I really had going for me could have been support at 9k, but IIRC it hasn't been much of a support point anyway. 
It seems there is less FUD, no korea or china or tether fud circling this sub

16000 coins arnt going to be dumped on exchanges it will be OTC. 
i've read some people theorize that this is to cover the last of the legal fees before civil rehabilitation can start
apparently not.. they went to that wallet and i see fresh unconfirmed txns on it, it's a high-transaction wallet, both in and out.  not good.

TA in no way affects price. It just tells you what the price has been doing. MACD 1d flipping to bearish just means buy pressure has dried up recently 
You are the one saying it's definitely not the Goxcoins.  I said it was a possibility, which of course it is.

And you are way overconfident with your macd theory.
Pretty much this.

All the perma bears and moonboys need to get wiped out, and infrastructure needs to increase tenfold before we see another true bubble.
> a few smart OTC investors will start to DCA in with smart money.

I always have to chuckle a little bit when this is mentioned, because (like with just about everything else market-related) it only really rings true in hindsight. If six months from now we're at $15k or $50k, people buying in now were smart money. If we're at $7k or $4k...not so much.

So, I don't think you need to be particularly smart right now to start DCA in. But you *do* need to be very confident. If you're smart and cautious (as smart money tends to be...that's how they got to keep all that smart money in the first place), you start DCA in after a protracted lull in price/volume on the way up. Think 2016 levels as opposed to mid-2014. Sure, you miss the rock-bottom prices, but your risk/reward is a lot better.
I don't understand what people want to see. Back and forth movement in an overall up trend is good. Continuous unwavering movement in one direction is what spells collapse.
Remember when he held thru an almost 8% dump and made money off it? the dude has strong, smart hands, so I think he'll be fine. 
I'll start posting my $100m longs from now on to lead the fools, will that be excellent?

Meh, this place is less than excellent anyway, perhaps it's best to leave. 
While he could certainly post a loss here, he longed $7.1k I think and held thru first dump to $6.5k and closed at like $7.3k. The guy is patient and there's a decent chance we see sub $8.7k again 
> shorts who became so rich will soon go broke, because they will keep trying to short. 

Same goes for the people who kept longing on the DCB to 17k.
Wait, just noticed this.  Did you just call people out for being shorts then say you went short on CME?
Ok I fixed it for you.
I'm all for enticing discussion, but come on people. This is not a courtroom. Last time I checked, posting on this thread doesn't require a PhD in palm (sorry chart) reading.
Thoughts and prayers.
It was actually a mistake from my end I, conclusively it is a bad trade so far. By right call I mean right entry point, by wrong direction I mean instead of long, I opened short. I am going to wait it out.
I will stop it earlier if I see it going totally against me but not exactly sure at what mark.
On the same page here. I have a 30% profit stop at 8975 and the rest at break-even for now. 
what do you think of mike's short from 8700? he is still holding on to it till 9600.

Would you consider reversing your position and going long at 9600?
That would be ultimate maximum pain: Sideways forever.
> There are no major support trend lines or resistance trend lines that are converging on the market right now.

In situations like this I sometimes like to look at the 100EMA and 200EMA for cross overs (golden or death). Interestingly, we have just had a golden cross over on the 4hr chart. The last time this happened was during the first week of March. It didn't hold then and we subsequently dumped to mid $6Ks. If this one holds that would be a very bullish sign for me (suggesting we're on the road to $12K+).

On the flipside, we are very close to getting a cross over on the 1D chart (unlike the golden cross over on the 4hr, this would be a death cross). If that happens, I think it would be very bearish (i.e. sub $6K in play).

Anyway, something to keep an eye on for longer term trades.
Yeah, I mean 3-5x is fine, but you can get really screweed in a flash crash. If you aren’t opening positions bigger than the value of your stack, better to just use 1x anyways.

My trading stack is 5BTC and I neevr open a position larger than 50k

Just made another touch now and seems to be holding.
Hoping for a bump now to high 93xxs
i'll probably risk a short it it gets to 9380 or so with stops @9480.
It's a high risk of being stop hunted but i rather be stopped there then after another BGD
I was thinking the same thing about that beautiful psychedelic MA line chart.

Hmm, I bet you could get a fib distribution to fit spacing of the lines on this diagonal highway, if you space 5 lines apart by 0 (bottom), 23, 38, 60, 100, and ignore the other two.  Diagonal fibs aren't a thing are they?  Anyway, cryptowatch doesn't have a tool for parallel lines and it'd be a little tedious and time consuming for me to be able to do right now.  Maybe later tonight if I get a chance.
do you have a link for this? 
Yup, more beautiful than mine!

Almost looks like a fib distribution doesn't it!
what do you see as the bottom if it were to drop?
Did you hold this even as it fell below 9000 yesterday? 
It might too... although the wick on Mex went to $9130 actually so pretty deep into my sl.  Setting stops is always a bit of a black art
I think it means Big Green Candle? 
Big green candle
thats why it would need to be open source.  So you could look at the code and make sure its not stealing your key.  Even then you wouldn't know if the download version has been altered.  But you could compile it yourself and use it that way, assuming you are able to read the code and verify theres nothing funny going on.
so the simplest why I could see to do this is the thread agrees to a custom format that a bot could scrape and interpret from the page.  So you would post:

long:8800

or

short:9300
SL:9400

when you close your trade you'd post

close:9000

And the bot would read these comments and post reporting on them every so often.  This wouldn't be terribly hard to write but you'd get people to use the format to be effective.  
[deleted]
I had the same thought. Plus you will occasionally say "hedging" --although I think you probably do still say short. I'm not really looking to tail your trades so much as I am to hear your take on the market or specific situations (as with a small number of other posters), so an RSS style feed of those posts is more helpful anyway. Cuts out a lot of the noise. 
Yeah, for this to be flawless it would need a predefined syntax. Otherwise it could create a mess of positions.

Well i guess ones entry is what determines how concerning this chart looks for the short term. 
> What's so concerning about the chart?

Bounce from $8700  to $9300 was fast and now a good chance of a drop to $9000...higher probability than jump to $9500 by my calculations.

And if $9700 was the next step in local top after $11,700 in bear trend, then also a good reason to be short.

Not to mention that some Goxcoins are moving and probably being sold, which obviously puts short-term downwards pressure on the market.
I also expect an equilibrium pattern to form between 8.6k and 9.7k over the weekend. 9.4k might be our new lower high and we might see a bit of a dump towards 8.8k-9k. 
well that's what hodlers essentially did. 

Agree. Just trying to say, majority opinion does not move the market, and may very well be wrong.
Either way, clarity on the count should be with us soon. The BBands are getting tight on the 1hr. I think if we take out $9130 with much volume we're going back down for a re-test of at least the $8.8K zone.
You use too much leverage
I'm not touching this, just found it strange his target of 9050 when the normal target of this H&S is 100$ bellow. Unless he's going long after a bounce from the target.
Also, 20k was a massive blow off top.

One could argue the true ATH was somewhere in the 15-17 range
Yeah but you had that "history rhymes" thing. That was pretty cool...
This is a good explaination, thanks. That still suggests bottom at 5120, which if we go there, why not 4800 or 4000 or 3500 or 3000? Legit nonrhetorical  question
Can we proceed with this conversation mid summer/ early autumn this year (2018). With all due respect, you will stand corrected by then.

PS; And I downvoted because you may as well be spamming. The 2013/2014 crash hypothesis has been argued many times before. Plus I'm a jerk.

FYI: If markets were so cyclical and predictable, there would be no market. Booms and busts happen but cannot be predicted to a perfect T. Which is what you are trying to do and you will be oh so wrong. See you in a few months.
Fundementals are totally different compared to 2014. True there was a bubble, and it popped. All bubbles pooping follow similar  patterns. It does not mean we're following the same exact path of multi year bear market. Back then Mt. Gox was the major exchange. Do we have same conditions? Same level of adoption? Mainstream media attention? There is no reason to follow that trend, there is no reason to go to 20k btc right now. So let's just see what happens instead of trying to impose our own confirmation biases on the market.
Because BTC was dead for most of the hardcore fans. Today is nothing like that.
I don't agree. Exposure is much greater. There is no single point of weakness such a s mt. Gox. Crypto acceptance both as currency and investment is much greater. Big tech players are moving in/ already are in crypto. The tech has matured alot. Instead of a market comprised of mostly Bitcoin forks, we have various blockchains, pos, smart contracts, tokens etc. We haven't reached full fledged adotion, but we're much closer to it compared to 2014. You're cherry picking facts to fit your narrative.
The problem is in your fundementals. You gauge fundementals based on old standards of just BTC adoption and what news outlet you have access to. I'm from Iran. Cryptocurrency is becoming rapidly popular here, I run a crypto telegram channel for fun. My followers are increasing day by day, asking me how to invest and what to buy. And these people end up buying BTC to trade and buy other cryptoes. All these news of institutional investors interested or already involved in crypo, they may not buy just BTC but other cryptoes as well. Today I have a meeting with an Iranian stock market brokerage that is interested in investing in cryptocurrency despite it being sunned upon by the government. On the whole, the market is getting it's fair share of new money, but not dumb money as it was in December.

I'm sure it's the same in many other countries. You are underestimating the appeal of cryptocurrency for the younger generation and just cherry picking the facts to suite your narrative because of confirmation bias or financial involvement such as underwater short. 
Im sure we will pick up a few decent writers along the way :) And no, coinmoon will never be abandoned, not on my watch at least. But please lets stay on the subject here. Bitcoin is all but past the bear cycle. And one of us will eat their words come this summer :(
You completely disarmed me there with your positive critique regarding my project:) It's a working progress that is far from complete. 20% the way there but you can see I actually intend to buidl something that can be used by the wider crypto community instead of just hodling and screaming long/bull/ath at every opportunity.  I wish you well with your trading and although i appreciate your kind words, I am sticking by my words. Bitcoin is past this current bear cycle. Many similar explanations out there as to why its highly probable the bear cycle is over. Check this out by Thomas Lee from Fundstrat :

>  There are many a few (including you) who expect BTC to go sub 6k so your 2014 wet dreams are fulfilled.

Straw man.  Your comment is worthless.
lol what wouldn't be bullish to you then? 

this is a classic "this is good for bitcoin"
Does that curve have a fixed angle of ascent?

Seems if not you could manipulate curved lines easily to fit any narrative, a la Parabolic Trav.

Genuinely curious how you would use these effectively.
I'm sorry, but I'm still struggling to interpret this. Are you saying the chart and lower volatility appears to indicate a big swing *down*, or just a big swing in general?
I doubt it. I recently stumbled across a handful of Pokémon and Yu-Gioh cards from when I was a kid, did some digging and some of the authentic first generation cards are worth upwards of $1,000+. 

If you ever have the time, look through the cards you could strike gold 
likewise.  I think that maybe if I have a Billy Ripken "fuck face" card somewhere it might be worth a few bucks, but otherwise they probably aren't even worth what they were paid for when I was given them as a kid.
WHERE'S THE PRIVATE KEY LEBOWSKI?!
you don't get 2 shots at a 10x bro.  We cant all get rich.  Best move is to short it to 0 and that's a 1x.. thats why shorts dont make much $$.



> If you watched the SEC hearing, it hasn’t been banned in the USA

That's great.  I never said it was.

>financial advisors advise for their clients to allocate 2-5% of their portfolios into crypto

And financial advisors advise for their clients to stay away from it.

> There was nothing but good news that came from the hearing

That sums it all up.  We will agree to disagree on that point as well.
>  that it was banned in India and China, and why would that make a difference? 

I'll just let that sit out here that you don't know why 3 billion people forcefully removed from the market would make a difference.
stupidest thing i ever heard... people dont ever change their mind???  some peoplle buy in bear others(most) in bull market....
That logic makes no sense, especially when there's a possibility that Nasdaq will open a crypto exchange. There is still alot of people who dont know or have just heard of bitcoin, and I bet you there are alot more that are afraid because they dont understand what bitcoin is. If Bitcoin succeeds in making itself a legitimate source of investment in the institutional field, there is no basis to say that new money wont come 
>  people will continue to yearn for decentralized blockchain tech 

Dencentralized blockchain tech is not Bitcoin.  Blockchain will continue to thrive and grow.  BTC is unlikley to see $20K again. Maybe some gov't sponsored cryptocoin will hit $300 billion market cap, but that's another story.

And it wouldn't be unpopular to ban Bitcoin.  99% of people wouldn't care and most would be in favor of it once you lie and tell them it's only used to fund terrorism and child sex trafficking, etc.
Put your hold stack into cold storage. That way it's actually a pain to move it which should be enough for you to just hold it and forget about it. I have a small trading stack but 80% of what I have I don't touch.
>looking at the answer sheet and being like OHH, every time :(

I know how you feel. I feel that way about college right now. And I know it can be soulcrushing.

Are you using margin? It could be that you're over-leveraging, causing panic to set in whenever the market moves against you. If you're trading without margin, it could be that you're using too little bitcoin and/or USD. I made some mistakes over the last few years of trading bitcoin, but that's helped me learn... And now I'm confident that I can be profitable long-term. Hell, I might even be able to live off of my trading. But I digress.

Maybe trading isn't for you. I'm that case, just Dollar Cost Average. Then sell if/when  you have a nice chunk of profit. 
I once heard on this sub that the best way is to trade between the knees and shoulders not the head and toes. 

I trade rarely, perhaps 4-6 times per year and this sub provides sentiment and feedback that I use to make longer term forecasts. I certainly have skin in the game but know what I’m not good at - day trading. 

Ultimately, all the whales want is more coin. Once you see this your emotions tend to settle back. I also enjoy a bit of FOMO, but you can’t have that without the dips. Learn to enjoy the ride, the view is much better that way. 
It knows that we know that it knows that...
But Bitcoin also knows the we know that *he* knows this, and that iocaine comes from Australia, and Australia is entirely populated with criminals, so we can clearly not choose the...
But what if it wants us to think that's what it wants us to think?
No to shorting bro. Its second time shorting has troubled me. I will definitely break even unless it keeps going down.

Whats your plan bro?

Nice call!
Thank you
Wouldn't it be funny if we've all just been repeating each other and it isn't true?
it is for Bitcorn at least
Yeah you're right. 

In that case, nice scalp. 
1.5% profit trades with any leverage will have anyone rich in no time.
mod used *intimidate*, it’s super effective
I can tell you what will likely happen. You'll keep "buying the dip" and watching you're unrealized gains go up and up. Eventually you'll say "that's enough buying the dip, I'm getting cocky." Then the market will finally have a really dip and correct down 30% and you'll panic close around breakeven. 

Take your profits or move up your stops sooner rather than later.
Yeah, I was clearly wrong... 🤔
I thought so.. everyone goes there first but IB is **not** friendly towards btc trading so I think it's good to look for other alternatives.

The CEO is amazing, and its a great stock but he's extremely bearish and fought very hard to not have BTC listed on futures because he believes price is going to zero. He makes it very hard to trade futures and said he will list BTC only because he's required but will set the worst margin requirements possible.
I sold half my stack at 9075 at a small loss because I just don’t have any confidence in the market direction right now.  
my man! 
My bad.
20x is insane. You can go to bed and lose it all. Don’t do 20x, you will get burned.

start with 1x short and 1x long. You’re not in a bull market, where 10x longs were too conservative.
I said that years ago when OKC futures launched -- /ES futures is the heart beat of the equity markets and it isn't that strange to think BTC futures/derivatives markets will be orders of magnitude larger than the spot markets -- I was laughed at back then btw, this was mid/late 2014.
Only worth it when you have a short open. short’s are mind numbing
I see like high powered wall street guys trading bonds making 5% a year and considering that a good year and I'm like uh buy bitcoin and make 300% a year... and it takes 1 trade.

Ah, this looks interesting.  I'll give it a look.
thanks for the cheat sheet
I'm telling you, man...you need to wrap all this up and sell it as an ebook / self-published / PDF / *something*. People will pay for it! Avoid the scammy marketing ("10 secrets to get rich quick" and whatnot), keep it TA- and markets-focused and no-nonsense, and it'll be a smash hit.
Ah ya, I see that.  I was going to say, a red cloud would go against my sentiment right now, but I'm all for learning.
Is that the name of what my settings have been on this whole time? Thank god I can finally read into it a bit more. Cheers!

Is there a quick list you run through of when to take entries/exits? I've got the entries part down... exiting is my bane.
Well, the bounce so far has already hit your stops.

My criticism wasn't that you are short to begin with. It's that your stops were almost certain to be hit even if the market does continue to fall.

EDIT: Edited from "the bounce is about to hit your stops" to "the bounce already hit your stops"
because Americans aren't eligible to sign up.  Not aware of any other sites that trade Bitcoin options, unfortunately.
If you're just looking to scalp, that's probably fine. If you're not hurting for profit, I'd wait to see if 9200 really holds or not and just set a 9275 stop or something. 
Tits on a bull would be a modern marvel that would revolutionize the food industry 
Market selling?
Yeah, all these hodlers talking about opening leveraged shorts at 93xx...
probably Binance.  That being said, unless you are planning on getting stopped out frequently, if you are more comfortable using GDAX or wherever you are currently trading at, why be bothered by the occasional 0.25-0.3% fee?  Just move your stop up by that amount.
9073 isn't low 9000
Ok, wicked :)
I got chopped out on my plan. Ended up taking a small loss overall. Pretty bummed 
Lol that's not that  bad really, that's a sweet trade 
Did u long above $9.2k? 😅😋
The support line of /u/j_ockeghem's triangle is almost redundant with the support of the channel we are in, and the angle of the channel way is a better fit (https://imgur.com/YaqCL7Y from earlier, but others have drawn it better).  The diagonal on that triangle is violating a bunch of candles on the left that it could support, and that angle change would better fit the newer candles too.

Anyway, I consider both this horizontal and diagonal, and think horizontals have a bigger impact on momentum.
At the very least, outstanding position X spot price would be valuable to be able to visualize.

Both of these are already available.
Too early, if this is reversal there will be plenty occasions to add.
On that wick I nearly manually closed the position to lock profits as it is.  Surely if I had had a higher ca I would have just done a break even fuckup.  Then try to reenter.   Not gonna chop myself up again.

Oh, and when I say "break even" that can often mean a loss of less than 1%, which I accumulated enough of the other day.

Must keep the discipline to keep the SL at 9k and ca at 8.9k for now.

As an experiment, and to scratch itch, I did a 50x 100 contract long at 9300 thinking "what if it doesn't dip lower".  Yup, that was a good verification/reminder of why you don't do that kind of impulsive shit with a real trade, as it would have exactly ended in liquidation. (Very good lesson that only cost 500 satoshis) 

That took the FOMO right out of me, like a parent forcing their kid to smoke a whole pack of cigs to make them hate it.  Of course... had the price gone up I would have probably ended up making a worse mistake later! ;)
By that logic an equal amount of supply was also removed from the exchange market, or am i missing something?

this wallet is likely the buyer (not a GOX account), and is now selling to smaller traders.  maybe a localbitcoin trader or something like that.  buy 16K at a 1-2% discount sell in smaller packets at a 0-5% premium = profit
Price volatility will go down with adoption. Right now we are still all speculating at what will get adopted. By the time its adopted the lack of volatility will make it a much less attractive investment and something you would have to be buying for the usecase
because no-one gives a shit about fundamentals.
Look at the price of bitcoin when margin trading and tether entered the market.
100->1000 willybot
1000->10000 tether
10000->20000 FOMO

The entire crypto market is extremely immature. We need this bear market to purge the filth can I get an amen
some many coins with real succesfull companies behind them.... maybe you should look into it bitcoin boy
Who knows. It's been gambling lately. I think even u/_chewtoy_ would agree that making the right call has simply been luck mixed with a good gut feeling. The sub helps a lot, but overall if you really look in the mirror and ask yourself 11.8k or 6.8k (both exactly 2.5k away), then I am willing to bet that both are equally likely, though I believe 6.8k isn't going to happen, and 11.8k will happen eventually. Either we just get a repeat of 2014, or we get a repeat of 2013. It probably won't be a repeat of 2015/2016 imo.
Yep, that’s why I’m laughing. Feels like we just can’t escape this range. I usually don’t scalp voluntarily, but I feel like I keep alternating between shorting around 9.2 and long around 8.8

Korean made protocol that allows decentralized apps. Basically Korea’s answer to ethereum/neo etc etc. Worth doing a extended google search over. Been my largest position since I sold all my neo for it when the ratio was too good to pass up. 
haha i said that before, could already be in "anger phase" because they are blaming whales and manipulation
Wrong. This sub is biased in whatever direction the price has moved in the last 15-30 minutes.
No, but the OP wasn’t posting a “bearish scenario,”  his post was a top post that was basically worthless. It was just a post essentially hoping the price goes down.  It had no reasoning or analysis. Have you noticed that Chewtoy posts bearish scenarios all the time and gets upvoted through the roof?   But how can that be if only bullish posts are upvoted?  It’s because his posts are objective and have thoughtful analysis, unlike the OP’s.

Yeah this is just stupid.  Anyway though if we retrace far enough it flips.
12 upvotes now.  This sub is a cesspool of bullish stupidity (and other forms as well).

Report his post.  I did.  The mods probably won't do anything, but there's a remote possibility.
You might be right.  I think we will stay above 8800 but what do I know.  
>I'm not experienced in TA (don't even believe in it much, tbh), but to me it looks like a bear flag.


>I believe we are going down much harder and deeper than that. Will wait until sub 8k.

that was 3 days ago.

your opinion isn't worth the bandwidth required to host on reddit's servers 
I guarantee that when there's a strong uptrend you'll know it and the volume will show. Rn we're at the mercy of whales deciding where we're headed. This doesn't indicate a healthy market.
some dude is downvoting you for no reason, screw him, have an upvote.

holy moly.. how did you trade in the crazy days without post only lol.. back when the exchanges were so ghetto and freezing up every 20 mins.


Then your ignoring the most reliable signal there is right now. 
Lol i was being sarcastic, I feel bad now. 
Oh I was being sarcastic, I feel bad that the sarcasm was so thick that people took it seriously...😅

I agree that shorting at $9150 based on h&s was sketchy though   
Shortcel lmfao
That was sarcasm.
> You've been RES ignored for sometime now

LMAO


> You use a modified system but you fail to mention it in your posts. It spreads confusion and reflects a lack credibility. I use the definite article because I use the standard settings; you're using modified settings so it's appropriate to use an indefinite article.

Look around at the cloud posts here and on crypto twitter and you'll probably find *more* people using the doubled crypto settings which seems to have become **a** (note the article here) *de facto* standard cloud setting. That you are unfamiliar/refuse to consider it does not mean others have not used it with success.

Awww :'(

Didn't know you spoke for all of r/bitcoinmarkets but ok. But if we're going to go down that path, I would point out that my tongue-in-cheek remark actually gathered more upvotes than your original comment!


> and grow up

Dude, you replied to my post with a pretty passive-aggressive comment and you kinda set yourself up and walked right into it for my facetious response up there--what exactly were you expecting? If anything, the fact that you replied with this instead of just taking it as a friendly joke and then deleted both [your comment on my post](https://i.imgur.com/Qs6ZgbP.png) and [your post here](https://i.imgur.com/fDodlHC.png) indicates to me **your** lack of maturity. Part of being a successful adult is realizing that there will always be people with thoughts and opinions you may not agree with and acting with humility instead of pettiness.
What?  Just giving the data behind the point that "about to" on MACD isn't a reliable enough signal to be the sole indicator for the next move, and will burn you more times than it will put you ahead, as has been mentioned here many times.

Perhaps in this case it was prophetic, but we don't know yet.
It sounds like you traded based on other’s trades, instead of making up your own mind and now are blaming others for your bad trade. I make bad trades often, but I recognize they were my decision and my responsibility.
Doesn't stop the counter-party then dumping them for a profit.
Thing is, what happens after OTC.

Then we have new entitie(s) sitting on a huge stack of BTC without knowing their intentions.
That being said; it's no use guessing at it, so I wouldn't let my trade decisions be influenced by this.

I don't know much about MACD but of course when the price breaks a trendline, and then makes a sharp move up or down, that is TA and obviously the price often reacts violently.  So not sure what you are saying but we probably agree but are using different meaning for "TA".

The real part is that there are no perma bears and perma bulls.
Bulls become bears and bears become bulls, its a circle that just go round and round :)

Its all about the gains of fiat/coins.
But can we hold over $10k until that happens?

K, thx.
Yep and we still have a ways to go imo. Sitting through the LTC bear market really prepared me for this. The day the last normie says "fuck this shit I'm out" is the day it will pamp like no other. Until then just sit back and be bear. 
Permabears are in the process of getting wiped out, wiping themselves out really.  Moonboys can afford to be patient and will be rewarded over time.  If there's one thing Bitcoin has taught me, it's that time is money.
Airn't ln node increasing at a high rate?

So 10 fold increase is next month? You sound like a moonboi 
Smart money refers to institutions and professional investors. It's less about having foresight and more of a classification of investor/trader looking for a market in consolidation and conservatively entering into a position over time.
Anyway, it's too early to call the action of the last 24 hours as either a trap or a continuation of a reversal.
don’t leave man! We need you. Come on, don’t you remember the 3k China FUD bottom. I was right there with you. Or the 1750 BIP 92 lock-in before SegWit. You were there then, be here now.

Just don’t perform hindsight analysis on another user’s trades; especially if they’re underwater
This was a b.s. comment.  

People here have seen his trades and confirmed the position, have you posted yours?

If you're a trader you know that you can go from  winning trade to a losing trade in a matter of weeks and also that you can have epic runs that turn into epic losses that can reverse back to epic gains, hopefully.  If you have adequate risk management you can end up ahead.  

Don't berate a trader when they took an L, period.
yup.. always sell the DCB, even if it goes a little higher.  Not worth the greed.



hehe guilty.  I'm a moonkid.. almost permabull but here i just think longs are too complacent.  and i just did one contract.  I'm really looking to move in and hodl with my whole stack.  Also options expire today so there's a huge premium on may which is the one i shorted.. so it was just like a tactical bet.  If it goes sideways i can just close tomorrow and profit off time value.. if it goes down i win obviously.. and if it goes up we got lots of resistance above us to test.. so i wont get burned too bad.




True, that's why I don't post useless "I short here" or "I long here" as nobody gives a fuck about it. If there are arguments and explanation on the "why" then it's totally fine even if the person is wrong on his analysis (or seems to be)
1 bitcoin = 1 prayer
Snakes and ladders
I wasn't aware he shorted at $8,700 and he and I clearly have a difference of opinion when it comes to imminent market direction. 

I have a lot of faith in diagonal resistance/support trend lines, and I always have. So my stance is the bear market is very likely on its way out and another bull trend is beginning. 

The only potential problem with that stance is that the market will follow the pattern established in 2014 and continue to decline for a few months despite breaking the log resistance line.

I'm already long from $8,780, so I wouldn't be reversing a short position at $9,600. I'd be holding my existing long position. 
Houston, we are in trouble!
There's the breakdown. Good call, sorry you didn't get your entry. 
On tradingview you can make fib channel. Would like to see /u/Trk- doing a version with it!

Not sure, this whole move is pretty perplexing. 

I'm not going to speculate here. 
Yup, my stops never hit. Came damn close though. 
Yeah setting stops on Mex is a pain, during pumps/dumps I always find the swaps price can be anywhere between $20-50 off from spot. Very skittish!
Ah so obvious. I'm used to BGD 
Ya, a standardized format would make this easiest
Now I'm curious if somebody has actually written a bot to parse my comment history.

I do tend to use fairly consistent language when I'm opening and closing positions. So it wouldn't be impossible. 
For somebody who was just interested in my exits and entries though, it would be possible for me to implement a % system that would make it fairly trivial to parse my comments.

For example:

%chewtoylongentry

%chewtoylongexit

%chewtoyshortentry

%chewtoyshortexit

EDIT: Initially had it setup as hashtags, but those don't work because markdown bolds them.
ya, somebody else would need to provide me with the syntax. There's 2 ways to do it, one simple and one more elaborate:

**Simple**

The required scenarios are:

1. Open Long
2. Close Long
3. Open Short
4. Close Short

**Elaborate**

The required Scenarios are:

1. Open Long + Place Stop Limit
2. Close Long + Remove Stop Limit
3. Open Short + Place Stop Limit
4. Close Short + Place Stop limit
Gotcha, for me focusing on the short term risk of a drop is failing to see the forest through the trees a bit. 

We're at a major pivot point now that the market has broken the log resistance line and  traded confidently above it for closing in on a week. 

Looking for a short entry now could be modestly profitable, but there's far more upside potential for a long in the medium term than there is for a short in the medium term. 

The absolute floor for a short over the next few weeks is likely to b $7,800 to $8,000 (unless of course the market breaks back below the log resistance line). Whereas the ceiling for a long in that same timeframe more or less doesn't exist. 

There's definitely resistance at $11,700, but if that breaks then there's essentially thin air up until $20K. 
Indeed... I made a quick edit to further qualify what I was looking at.
I don't want to miss the bottom, so I'm not trying to be exact.
I'd like to believe that, too. But it sounds too much like the "no true Scotsman" fallacy to me. (Probably a bad example, but similar reasoning).

What does the exact dollar amount of the ATH matter? By itself, nothing, really. But it's like other TA: the more other people think it holds significance, the more it really does. So in the case of ATHs, it becomes really important because a lot of people will be relying on it for TA (as a horizontal resistance, and as a starting point for a million sloping resistance lines). So from that perspective, I think the number itself and place on the chart is very important, and not so much how fast and hard it got there in the last days.
Haha, thanks! Wish I could take credit for that, but I didn't come up with it. I appreciate that you enjoyed it, though!
We've already touch 5.9K USD. I don't know where these numbers and ratios come from. I guess it's all just market dynamics and self-fulfilling prophecies. TBH I'm not worried about price as long as we stay within the MOAC that I linked to. I lot of people trade with these channels, so that's probably the answer to 'Why 5120?'. (And we've only visited its support twice and its resistance once. If you believe in Elliot waves, that would mean that we're still on the way up to wave 3.)
RemindMe! 5 months  
Care to refute any of my points, then, if you're so sure?

That's the difference between us. You're *so certain*, and I'm not. You write like someone that hasn't experienced enough market cycles and taken enough beatings. If you had, you wouldn't be so confident and arrogant.

I'm not predicting anything "to a perfect T." Just saying that dreams of new ATHs at this point are just that: dreams. We're much more likely to continue with the bear market than blast off to new highs. That's all.

I hope for you to be right. It would be wonderful to have another bull run; I'd hop in again and make a fortune along with you and everyone else. I just don't think it's likely to happen, and the bullish action this past week (along with the "different" fundamentals are not the ironclad indicators that you think they are.

Edit: removed stray quote mark.
We use the 2014 bubble because looking at the best example of a crash that we have is better than random guessing.

Mt.Gox did not pop the bubble of 2013.  It was actually China regulation.  I made a post about it on this subreddit here: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8cf586/a_couple_of_notes_on_the_201314_bubble_vs_2017/

In terms of exposure, there are definitely some very major bottlenecks.  Regulation is one which always looms.  USDT is another.  USDT is increasingly relied upon as tokenized fiat.  The US government could at any moment decide that such a token violates US securities / other law and destroy it.

The reality is that many exchanges are operating without any fiat withdrawals or deposits.  Binance, Poloniex, Bittrex, Bitfinex just to name a few.  They all rely heavily on USDT to at least provide exposure to fiat.  

Once again, plenty of new tech is being developed, but the vast majority of the companies making the tech are earning the majority of their money through token sales and appreciation, not through a sustainable business model which collects recurring revenue.  

So while there's a bunch of new coins being developed, the majority of them focus on creating a new Blockchain for any arbitrary adjustment they make to existing platforms like Bitcoin and Ethereum.  The idea that we need to make a separate blockchain for every possible application is ridiculous, inefficient, and a clear sign that developers are creating these tools primarily to profit off the token hype, not because they are actually solving an unmet need. 
I have never shorted Bitcoin in my life, and have no plans to do so. Confirmation bias? Definitely possible. It is hard to stay objective, as I'm sure you will agree. You yourself are dripping with bullish bias, though I don't fully blame you given Bitcoin's history and potential. I too, am bullish on Bitcoin long-term. Don't mistake me for a permabear or Buttcoiner. Bitcoin has treated me very well, and I still have high hopes for it. I just don't think we're out of the woods yet. Believe me, 2014 fundamentals and adoption were *amazing*. Probably better (in relation to price) than they are today, really. But it didn't stop the bear market then, and I'm not sure it can do it now. If I'm wrong, fine, I'll miss out on profits and hop on the bull train with you sooner or later. But I'm still waiting to see how things play out.

So, I am bearish...but with an open mind. I encourage you to be bullish...but with an open mind. Don't be so sure of things, is all.

Thank you for your perspective, especially the non-Western, boots-on-the-ground view. That is genuinely valuable to hear about.
I will be glad to eat my words (keep in mind, my prediction is that the bear market lasts longer than now and likely longer than this summer, but is not as confident as yours)! I'll jump in on the bull run and make a fortune alongside you. So, I hope you're right.
Good luck with the project, sincerely. We can use more resources like this in the crypto space!

I don't take Tom Lee seriously, he is a permabull...just like the guy from Pantera Capital. They will be right one day, like a broken clock, but I don't particularly believe them right now.

Keep in mind, people who bought in 2013/2014 and didn't sell in time because they listened to the Winklevoss "Bitcoin to $40k!" twins ended up underwater for many months / years. And we're still nowhere near their $40k prediction. Though, for the record, I think we one day will be.
Yep... Oh well.. we know where we are now
2018 is NOT 2014
thanks sloppy. always very level headed my man 
well everyone was worried that they'd be selling all of their coins on exchanges in the future so that uncertainty is gone
Great point.  I think curved lines only work if theres 5 points where it touches because anything else can be heavily manipulated.  Also helps if they are on a higher timeframe.

/kinda weird or dumb: I am not sure how I feel about curves yet but I have been making more efforts to draw them when I can and I am learning/watching.  Exploring curved lines are a natural extension to my thoughts on effectiveness (or lack thereof) of regular trendlines and my dissatisfaction of choosing between log vs linear charting.  Ie. trendlines don't work anyway- why not draw curved lines too?
The latter. Any time the Bollinger bands tighten up you could interpret it two ways 

1. There's alot less volatility than before 

2. Because crypto is naturally volatile, you can expect a big swing in price in either direction after a period of stability and no volatility 
In general. My bias is that it will go up but volatility in markets is unpredictable... and usually it isn't good for them. I'm mostly concerned that I don't have a measure for volatility that I trust. The market is either volatile, or it isn't... and right now it looks like it's both. It hurts my brain too.
I have a bunch of Ken Griffey Jr. rookie cards. He was my favorite player. I recall buying his cards from friends with my lunch money. I'm looking at this now and shitting my pants a little.

nah once your mind gets set its set.. thats how things oughtta be and its a tasty way to do it.. thats why those people who argue with other people about some political issue are dumb
a bitcoin hater will always hate from now on


yeah but theres a lot of funds you can already buy if people dont search for them they never find em.. there's a glut of tickers and symbols out there

Lol you're so off base here. 20K is a virtually gaurantee barring some sort of Black swan event. Also, what is this 'blockchain' you speak of? How is it different than Bitcoin? How is decentralization maintained by a blockchain? Please don't start rambling about centralized crap like ETH. 
I did that for XRP. Worked out well until my 200k profit just vanished in January :(
this is solid advice. thanks. just wondering did you sell your coins temporarily predicting this dip or just hold through it
Just don’t think about it.
my liquidation is right below 8000. Either that happens or I close it at 11.7k LOL..... 
Pretty much i have no plan. Next time I'm gonna use tight stop loss. gotta stop fucking around like this.
Like we´re all living in a little echo chamber of falsehoods and one day the rektoning will come.
Wouldn't it be funny if we've all just been repeating each other and it isn't true?
Sure, just let me know how you make overall profits with your win size so small. 
trainer red sends out monkyyy

monkyyy used shitpost, its didn't have much effect
I bought the dip so much from January to March that I *literally* ran out of money. 

To anybody reading, here's some advice. Don't do what I did.



(It's not *that* bad though because I'm in college and I'm not using loans to buy crypto and also I'm getting a job so I am gonna be getting more money anyways. But I went from a few grand in the bank to about 60 dollars. Not my proudest moment.)
haha WOW:
In the case of outright short positions, the margin rate for the CFE contracts is currently set at USD 40,000 per contract and the CME contract, which is 5x larger, has a requirement of USD 200,000.

200k to short one contract of bitcoin, lol.. like a 500% requirement atm.  INVERSE leverage.  awesome.

Guess they dont like people who short bitcoin !

Any recs for a bitcoin-friendly broker that will also take US citizens?  One that allows margin.

Smart.
Err... I was already using 3.3X on finex. Maybe I should start with 10X
Haha well trading isn't easy.  We are all learning.  Your question is kinda like asking how to trade but I will try to answer.

Strategy: Before looking for trade opportunities you should have a strategy for trading.  Every trade you take will be directed by the strategy and your career will either succeed or fail by your strategy.  The foundation of every strategy is risk management.  You'll need experience to understand risk management, you can't learn it from a simple google search.  It will take time and mistakes to build a good strategy with strong risk management.

Plan: Before taking position, you should assess the chart and plan out possible entry set ups, following the rules of your strategy.  Ie. "IF price does x,y,z THEN enter trade in this way".  To build consistency and make sure you are sticking to strategy, draw your plan out on a whiteboard or paper at the start of each day.  

Entry: Only take trades based on your plan unless there is a major fundemental change that you caught early (ie Roger Ver suddenly announces he is shutting down Bitcoin Cash).  Sticking to your plan ensures you will stick to your strategy.

Exit: Place a stop market order according to your plan.  You can modify it or cancel it as the price approaches, but place it anyways in case you are on the toilet or what not.  Again, this is all about sticking to your strategy.

Building a strategy

Risk: Most important thing to do while building your strategy is  trade with very small amounts ($1) and increase very slowly (perhaps double each month).  Since you have not fully developed your strategy, it is best to use small amounts until confidence in risk management is proven.

Trend: Most strategies follow 'the trend is your friend' rule and involve long entries in a bullish trend and short entries in a bearish trend.

Timeframe: Be highly aware of your timeframe that you are trading in and how it relates to your strategy.  Every timeframe has its own trend.

My Strategy*

My strategy is based on determining trend, determining likely strong support and strong resistance areas, watching momentum for slowing when we enter these areas, and finding entries that follow the trend and have more upside potential than downside (ie big reward, 'tight' stop loss).  You can see this in play in my posts, I hope, but maybe not..  After all, I am still building my strategy and I don't consider myself a career or veteran trader (yet!).

Example Plan*

We are in a downward trend on the daily timeframe. I've been watching for a short on the daily timeframe at 8.9-9.9k for several weeks based on weekly level, local 62% fib level providing resistance.  Since there is nearby a major higher high and psychological level at 10k, a short at 9.9k would have small downside potential ('tight' stop loss).  We entered the 8.9-9.9k range with strong momentum, a 5-point parabolic curve formed.  When we got a bear div and the parabolic curve broke it was a sign momentum has slowed and I took my short entry.

*Criticism very appreciated!
Heehee, I gave it a few dollers wiggle room to account for the retest of the neckline on your advice, ty.
doesnt look like a TWAP bot but its definitely sending lots of payments out.. 
it just sold 20 btc now.. either selling it on the market or distributing it to people.  It doesn't make sense.  But it's definitely not being hodl'd.




Compared to 9.7k it is
On higher time frames only by a pixel.  Doesn't feel like it's finished though...
Ah damn, that's too bad. 

I got stopped out at 9030, and later reentered at 9000 with the same size.
I’m long from November 2017 lol currently down 48% total on my crypto portfolio. Better than a few weeks ago tho, was down close to 80% 😳
Exactly.
~30% invested with avarage below 8.8. if support breaks on this level i still have the oppertunity to cash out break even or a slight loss or i can add to my position depending how much support is able to hold on lower channels.

Not worried about a slow bleed scenario a la 2014-2015 just yet


I've tried a couple 50x and 100x trades, always with $20 principle or less. I finally hit one, rode it up $100 and closed. I think it was a 1000 contract position at 100x down in the 8000s. I realized I made less than $10 after feels (although it was only a $10 position), and swore I wouldn't do it again. The highest "crazy" leverage I would ever consider is 25x, but I've never opened at anything over 10x. My long from 6410 is now at 25x since I wanted some margin out of it to put into my 8750 long. 
Think of it like this:

Let's say that it's a hot summer day and the ice cream man has setup shop on a busy street corner. 

There's a line of 100 people waiting to buy ice cream bars, and the ice cream man has 100 ice cream bars to sell. 

Suddenly a guy walks up with 25 ice cream bars in a cooler he's carrying. He offers to sell them to anybody who is interested, and 25 people step out of line to buy them from him instead.

This does not change the number of ice cream bars the ice cream man has to sell...but it does decrease the number of people interested in buying ice cream from him. 

It is possible, however, that the guy with the cooler found some people to buy his ice cream that weren't already waiting in line. In that case, cooler guy did not have a tangible effect on the supply of ice cream from the ice cream man or the demand for ice cream from his customers.
it is odd.. a big LBC trader in asia would make sense
strange one address getting a lot of coins:
https://blockchain.info/address/353jwBYFqUVgcgvFpC99FFork9JiChkHpq

has  a lot of bc1 activity.. not very widely adopted protocol

I don't know... look at the [transactions per day](https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions) and tell me they don't match with entering and leaving exchanges for peaks and lows.

What other form of adaption are you waiting for with bitcoin?
And then there's dogecoin and bitconnect. Even if the market was a very generous 10% not ponzi shit, the rest of the market would still need to be accounted for.
Wrong, the price has gone down in the last hour. But yes, bulls are out during bullruns and bears during dumps, its true. But in general of course there is still a bullish bias beside that lol
I agree, OPs post was shit tier, but is "Short 100x or stfu" the right response.

Also if I say "I really think were going to test 12k" during an uptrend with no TA to back it up, i guarentee you it will get upvoted. Bullish posts have a lower required standard to be acceptable. I cant see how you could deny that actually
> a post essentially hoping the price goes down

That's a misrepresentation. I **hope** BTC has turned the corner, as I wrote elsewhere in today's discussion. But I am not convinced it has.

Looks like I did something outrageous today and posted an opinion without backing it up with TA. What a heretic! 
Whoa, you have a list a mile long of abuse notifications from us mods. Of all people to claim we won't do anything...
theres no point, the main active mod is a perma bull
Dude, I said I don't believe in TA much. I don't think anybody's opinion is worth much when it comes to predicting BTC price, tbh.
I didn't trade much back then. And I don't trade if the volatility if going crazy. Neither limit not market. I usually just set trailing stops.
Which is...... ??
don’t feel bad, sassysynapes. I didn’t take a position other than my permalong.

Buying 16k BTC over the Counter and then market selling them will most likely not lead to profit...
if they bought at a price you could dump for a profit the trustee would just dump it himself

if you think TA affects price you have it backwards. TA tells you what the price is doing, not what it's going to do. You speculate based on what it has been doing based on historical patterns and data. 

1d MACD flipping bearish literally does not affect the price. It just indicates a potential inflection point, which gives you a better idea of the risk/reward of a longer term position. 
We are up and down 200 bucks quite often and doesn't always have to do with macd.

Anyway I was short, just based on the chart formation, but covered at 8910 and going to see if we crack 9000 on the bounce.  But I still have overall bearish bias...mainly based on the chart, but also fundamentals.
Watching 1d MACD for 2% swings doesnt make much sense imo, it could be a blip in the long run. I'd watch the 1-4h if you're concerned about 2% swings 
I'd say I'm pretty much a perma-bull which is not to say that I don't think the price can go down over periods of time, just that when it does, I buy more.  Pretty much the only reason I keep any fiat is so that I can buy the next dip.  If I thought it would always go up, I would just buy every chance I got.  Patience and discipline matter. 

By the way, the bears seem extremely emotional to me, like they just hate Bitcoin and don't care how much money they lose trying to drive it down.  We bulls are pretty much people who have learned over time that the rational move is to accumulate as much Bitcoin as you can because it's unstoppable in the long run.

Once you figure it out, it's like knowing the winning lotto numbers in 2020. 
Lets all just be honest... been said a 1000 freaking times.. this market is manipulated. Doesnt help fooling ourselves. 
haha wow. From "wonder how anyone can be betting against the run" to hey i'm just short one contract \[5btc right?\].

I feel like people quick to judge others trades when they so close to making the same one.  Perhaps I've been guilty of it too so good for us to check ourselves.
what do you think about FOMO buying and panic selling? If done consistently enough, without employing the use of emotion, could they be a good tool to grab onto momentum?

For example if you sell everytime BTC drops 10% and buy everytime it goes up 10% in hopes for taking profit off of 50% moves.
Every time i hope for one more cycle inside the pattern it breaks...
Anyway it's still holding @9200 so i'm going to wait to see what happens. Also checking if it will become resistance, for now it hasn't reached there so will leave the line there a bit more.
That's beautiful, thanks.
Are you going to take profit on your long or you expecting this to bounce?  
Yup, my stops didn't get hit on mex but did on other exchanges. Terrible start to the day. 
Good fortune (which favors the bold)

I’ll see myself out
Yeah it could be done. it’s not super simple, but definitely doable for someone who is able to get a little creative with their coding.  

Who knows, maybe it already exists

Maybe you’re not really a good trader, it’s really just because a whale bot comes along and makes a huge market buy or sell shortly after you take your position, which drives the market in the direction of your choosing.  

And when you get a trade wrong, it’s not that you’re a bad trader, just that the bot misinterpreted your comment.  

/conspiracytheory


Don't do this, it could have nasty market effects
Indeed it would be. You wouldn't even need the "chewtoy" part for my feed, as it already filters for specific posters. 

edit to add: I'm not the coder, my brother is the one that actually wrote it
If you do this I'm gonna set a bot. Just for fun with tiny amount.

/u/l14dy will probably also
Ahha I'd definitely be interested in this.
Something along this lines would do it
![short,long] [trading pair] [opening value] [% of stack] [leverage] [other options] 

* !long XBTUSD 9215 0.1 2x -sl 8986        
* !long XBTUSD -close 9200             
* !long XBTUSD  -add 0.2 9010          
* !long XBTUSD  -profit 0.1 9010       
* !long XBTUSD -sl 9200 (to update SL)    
  
I think sl is useless. I would go with a bot that goes with market orders every time you open or close. You sometimes change sl.

I would go with !openlong etc. Cause sl and entry point doesn't matter if it has to follow you.
For now, what would be a good long entry? 9150 with stops @9050 followed by 8950 with stops @8850 (pretty tight stops i know)?

> but there's far more upside potential for a long in the medium term than there is for a short in the medium term.

Maybe but I don't ever trade or hold for the medium or long term.  I don't like to ride out 5% or larger moves that go against my position.

I won't be holding this position for "the next few weeks"...more likely a few hours or a day at the most.  The next significant move upwards or downwards is all I care about.  $11,700 means nothing to me, because if I was long, I sure wouldn't hold until that level, unless the price went straight up there without any indication of a pullback, which is unlikely.  Also, don't believe the current fundamentals support anything remotely close to $20K, so limited upside with being long, just as with being short.

But your strategy and priorities are just as valid and probably more profitable than mine.  This is the only way I can trade though, because I don't like to unnecessarily lose money in the short-term even if it could possibly pay off with more in the longer term.

Thanks, beat me to it! Will be interesting to see. I don't mind being wrong. I just hate that arrogant over-confidence.

Also: what's the over/under on their account even still being active by then?
I write with a certain level of conviction. Simply because I am willing to make observations while considering CURRENT conditions. Ofc previous market events are worth noting but your going one step further by obsessing about a protracted bear cycle that was exabarated by a black swan event (mtgox hack followed by btc-e causing sell side pressure with over 600k BTC). 
That's like saying I like apples but since there is no apple around here I'll eat a hamburger.
Mt. Gox was definitely a major contributing factor to the crash. Crashes are always multifaceted.
I agree about lack of liquidity in the marker. Then again exhanges are moving to solve that problem. Binance moving to Malta for example. Also we have several alternatives to usdt, including digix which is pegged to gold. IMO more fiat gateways will lead to reduced demand for BTC and ETH.

Businesses have a very good reason not to build upon Bitcoin and ethereum blockchains. First unfair distribution of hash power and coins make these two prone to market manipulations, a faceless blockchain with hammers such as Mt. Gox or parity wallets hanging above is not a solid infrastructure to build upon:

https://arewedecentralizedyet.com

Also POW is not a substainable solution. Bitcoin solutions such as segwit and LN are still  insufficient to scale the network and many prefer to build them from scratch. Just because we have something that works for now does not prevent people from innovating. That's progress. There is a blockchain fever going on, true, many projects are applying blockchain to subjects that doesn't really need it and overcomplicate it (e.g. supply chain) but there are many more untapped fields that may benefit from a trustless decentralized solutions and we're still discovering them. We're much further ahead in progress since 2014 and anytime a breakthrough in adoption and technology can occur that will propel us forward. 
I'm not moon lambo bullish, I prefer steady sustainable growths over sudden pumps and dumps. No way a sudden surge to new ATH is sustainable. Cryptocurrencies are overvalued on the whole, all speculative assets are. But right now there is nothing new to burst that bubble. If we reach new ATH soon, then I will turn bearish.

Your welcome, crypto is much more appealing when you live in a third world country with high inflation and corrupt government. That is pretty solid fundemental, that enough people in these countries begin to adopt crypto.
As is the market and the conditions on which it trades.  

People expecting the chart to mirror what happened in 2013 - 2014, I have some news for you, and if you're a bear, you're going broke. 
I never said it was. You are hopeless.
ah that makes a bit more sense 
Thank you for helping to clarify. That's how I was reading it, but I'm still fairly new to trading and reading charts, so I like to confirm my suspicions before applying the knowledge.

We live in different realities.  Enjoy yours and I will stick with this one, where 2+2 =4
It works better for bitcoin, for ALTs I mostly just buy, hold then sell once I hit my target to get more bitcoin. 
Held like my life depended on it. I can’t compete with the whales and if you can just hold onto your coins you will do well. You would be amazed how difficult doing ‘nothing’ is. It is so easy to lose your concentration and overtrade in that type of environment, especially if it’s a hobby, as it can take over. I then bought all the way down and was/am prepared for another 2 yr bear market to keep buying (worst case repeat of 2014/15 which I don’t think will happen). 

Not good ‘trading’ as the dip was predicted due to the rapid rise, but my view is longer term (circa 2021) so although it was a big fall I believe the move up through the next few years will easily surpass it. There was a report here a few weeks ago showing that the main rises occur on circa 10 or so days over a year and if you miss these you can miss almost all the gains. I’m more concerned on missing these than scalping over a day or so. 

This was softened though by taking a few calibrated bets on alts so my FOMO & despair instincts were satiated over there. On reflection in many ways I think I am more of an investor than a trader and act that way. 
I lose
Don't get too hung up emotionally. Have your plans in place.

I'd say keep watching the charts closely, low probability of going sub 8K. Just be patient as you've been all along and it should be fine really. :)

5x
start with max 100x leverage with very little balance and develop good risk management habits and tighten the precision on your entries. Then you can move down in leverage and have confidence you handle that leverage (which you should be if you were just on higher leverage)
Glad you did. 

I can't say that I 100% agree with the short, but at least you didn't exit prematurely.
Seems to be stopping at the level it started... An extended BART disguised as an H&S. 
I think it's time to go to sleep, without any alarms for the first time in months. I want nothing to do with this chopping.
Tomorrow is another day.
Pretty salty given the market movements since then. I want to reenter, but I'm not a fan of this entry. I didn't like 9100 last night either though, so...
Wow crazy about the fees there.  It was swaps then?

Yes that was another lesson learned in practice, that you don't open a position at super high leverage, that that is something you build up to with a delicate balance for rare cases.

Ah yeah, may as well 100x that long and take its margin out of your way, you'll surely close it before BE anyway.
While i like this analogy and it makes a lot of sense, i see a strong argument to made for the latter to be true.

OTC buyers/sellers i would assume are generally looking for large quantities that would be hard to obtain on the open market without suppressing or inflating the price leaving them with a worse entry and a lot of effort in monitoring price action and setting buy/sell walls. Anybody looking to buy or sell 10s of thousands of coins would most likely look for a OTC deal long before they consider buying on exchanges.
oh well.... if you dont dyor you get burned
I said you probably wouldn't do anything.  I never said it was 100% or 0%.   But thanks for removing the "non-excellent" posts in this case.
Who is that?
TA is literally the only logical analysis that can be done on the market. if you cant analyze TA or back up your predictions with TA then your opinion is worth literally nothing. your opinion is no better than a coin flip.
true. the best move back then was hodl.

Alts give you the signal which way the market is moving. While that isn't always the case, it has been since the bottom.
 sorry that we weren't able to contribute insight as valuable as your "hay guys what should I do?"
It is when you go short on futures.
Of course TA doesn't tell you what the price is going to do.  It tells you what the price is likely to do or not do in the future.   But I have a feeling this is all semantics.
Gotta disagree pretty heartily on the bears being emotional thing. Every noob is emotional, and there are tons of them. I've found that generally lately people who are bearish longer term are a lot less emotional and much more level-headed about possibilities. 

Really, it's pretty even, although I'd say there are more permabulls than permabears (why stick around talking about an asset you think is going to $0). 

The difference is permabears stay away from bitcoin and don't lose their money. permabulls don't really care cause they think they'll be rich in a few years 


Like for example. I personally recognize that it can go up and down in the long term even though I believe it's going to go down. You on the other hand are 100% sure that it's guaranteed to go up. You're not being logical, you're being emotional 
I would imagine the bear's goal is to drive the price down during a wounded market to accumulate more coin. That seems like a more pragmatic approach to gaining more coins than just simply dumping money every chance you get.
I don't give a shit one way or the other.  Don't need to satisfy my emotions with rationalization.  Just riding the waves, managing the risk of entries and exits, and trying to make profit.  Don't give a fuck when/why a BRD/BGD comes, but always prepared to deal with it.
short 2 now actually... gotta find a better brokerage.  making a spreadsheet and making calls.


There's not really much profit to take at this point. It makes more sense to hold it until breakeven or wait for it to bounce and continue to hold it indefinitely.
I think you are exaggerating the weight of the users of this sub in the grand scheme of BTC
correct. was just thinking about this too
i would probably not create a bot but would have a SMS sent to me immediately so i can decide whether or not i would follow
Well, here's the potential concern with ignoring stop losses. 

It's fairly common for me to open a position before I go to bed and for the market to move considerably against my position while I'm asleep. 

I have alarms for this, but I'd want to ensure that any bot setup to follow my trades wouldn't get liquidated (or at least suffer unnecessary losses) because I slept through my alarms or because I closed my position in a sleepy stupor and didn't bother to post that fact until the next morning.
I would do this more of a database kind of thing, where you can see all the users with open positions, check their history and so on.
The bot part was just to get the info from reddit and put it in the database. 

I generally don't approach the market in this fashion (setting limit orders in anticipation of a dip). 

Instead I'd wait for the dump to lose steam and buy as the market starts making its way back up.

So I'd wait for the drop and long the breakout once the market starts trading above whatever short-term resistance line is formed by the dump.

This is what I did yesterday. There was a [clear resistance line](https://imgur.com/a/sC19b9q) formed on the 1h and I went long once the market made its way above that line and confirmed it as support. The red dot marks my entry.

I'd recommend looking for a similar long opportunity on the next moderate drop. 
I'd question how unlikely a straight up move to $11,700 would be. 

For one, the market effectively did exactly that the previous two times it moved from $9,200 to $11,700.

For two, the percentage change to get from here to there is 27%. 

The market already pushed up from $6,800 to $9,750 before seeing even a moderate correction. A 43% move. 

It's not as crazy as you might think to see an additional 27% increase from current levels before another moderate correction.
> I write with a certain level of conviction.

So this is your first Bitcoin bubble, yeah? Give it time, if you stick around through the bear market to the next one, you'll have less convictions and a more measured tone.

> black swan event

There will be no shortage of apologists for this bear market, however long or short it is. We've already seen it ("Futures!" "Soros!" "Mt. Gox trustee selling coins all year!" "Tether!") and I'm sure we'll create some more compelling narratives as we go along.
Well, we have propelled forward.  We've gone from a $21B world crypto market cap to $420B+ in one year.  A 2,000% increase.  And the only real proven use case for blockchain so far is decentralized value transfer.  And even that will need to improve dramatically before mass adoption.

EDIT: I asked my buddy this the other day.  Are there any new blockchain technologies from 2017 that have active users?  As in people using the new technology for its intended purpose or goal.  Not people speculating.
I do believe that is one of the fundamental promises of Bitcoin. So far it has failed to live up to its potential (in 2013/2014 we had similar promises and similar narratives, Greece/Cyprus/etc.) but I hope that in the future, that use case blossoms.

One thing to keep in mind...not to discourage you, but maybe temper your expectations: the adoption in third world countries is going against cashing out of early adopters. Supply vs. demand. Sure, you can call them stupid or short-sighted for cashing out...but that supply is there, and might be bigger than you give it credit. And certainly you can't blame someone that made massive gains for locking some of them in / de-risking / etc.

If you are right and that demand is bigger, then yes, we will see continued price appreciation. But if all the people sitting on 10x (or 1,000x) gains who want to cash out overwhelm the new adopters...well, that's how you get a long, drawn-out bear cycle. The news doesn't matter, that gets ascribed in hindsight mostly. Whichever "side" wins is likely to be self-reinforcing, as cycles tend to go. So if demand is fundamentally greater, we will see bullish fractal action as we did last year which builds upon itself. But if supply is greater, then the dumps will continue and increase in intensity as well.

Just something to consider.
what news?
So what on Earth was your point? Let me guess you started typing the moment your brain gave you something, anything to say? If you tried to grasp the concept of what I was saying, you would realize I was arguing the length/depth of this bear cycle will not be anything like the 2014 cycle. Which is in contrast to what other people are saying (some people are saying BTC  "must go sub 6k" in order for a full recovery to occur) Hence 2018 is NOT 2014. I'm not contesting the fact a correction took place, it did. Clearly!

Next time read the day's full commentary before jumping right in.
Yeah. This is a good day. I know what bad days feel like. This is not a bad day.
So someone is asking $1000 for it...big deal?   I could list one and ask $100,000,000 for it.  That doesn't mean that's the market value.

Here is the real value:

This, right here, this is irony.
the shit in his pants?
it wont all the hodlr's are hodling and all the haters wont buy.. what you see now is a bunch of people running hte price up and down to casino it up.  one guy flipping a bitcoin back and forth is enough to set a market price.


You think Bitcoin topped out at a few hundred billion dollar market cap? Why is '20k' the magic number that it won't go beyond?

I noticed you didn't answer my other question either. What is this 'blockchain' and how is it decentralized and how is it different than Bitcoin?

You don't live in a 2+2=4 world, you live in one where explanations and reasoning are apparently not required.

Nice baseless conjecture tho! Let me know if you end up formulating anything rational.
I don't
Hell yea!
etrade has an 80% requirement for long/short. better for shorting but not as good for long.  Still.. aint exactly bitMEX is it.  And i gotta have futures because the taxes kill you otherwise.


Sorry for the bother... But when would you decide to scale up the leverage? Would you do it on an already winning trade or when the market reverses after a big trend. As in high leverage, low profit %, or high leverage when high profitability? 
Aha. That's a good idea. I know I'm going out on a leg asking this, but could you elaborate an example with 100X leverage. 
See ya
Yeah I'd be hesitant to enter here.  Though we did just have a little drop and test successfully (for the moment) the support of the second lane of the channel.  So at least relative to the previous hour it is better...
Yes, swaps, and I'm pretty sure I market closed it. Basically:

$10 100x = $1000 position at $8K = 0.125 BTC. $100 spot price move = $12.50 gain on $10 principle - fees. It was silly. 

I guess I could 100x it at this point. It would free up 3/4 of the coin which I could throw into my newer long haha. My 6410 long is only about 8% in size to my 8750, but I should have done that at 9130 if I was going to, though. 
I did my own research, I just got exhausted reading shitcoins whitepapers. I'm waiting on grin. The rest can burn in hell.

I was talking about EOS specifically. BTC isn't rising because EOS went on a run.
You see people in here dogging Bitcoin all the time. They're totally emotional.  And the people dumping mass quantities at market prices are definitely emotional.  They're certainly not rational.  That's no way to make money.  If you legit wanted to unload a bunch of Bitcoin, you'd broker something OTC or do a series of limit orders over time so as to get the best price.  You wouldn't dump it on exchanges, and it's exceedingly clear that someone gets their jollies by dumping on exchanges in great 30-minute bursts.

Personally, I am up on every single Bitcoin purchase I've ever made, and I've made a lot. Over time it has proved to be a much better store of my wealth than any other instrument. I wish I had bought more Bitcoin 5,4,3,2,1 years ago and less stocks and bonds.  It goes up, I'm happy.  It goes down, I'm happy because I get more appreciating satoshis for my depreciating dollars.
I would hope so, but it doesn't look that way.  I measure my gains in satoshis, not dollars, personally.

It looks like they just recklessly dump massive amounts of coins every so often, and I can't think of a reason to do that other than to drive the price down. If you had a lot of coins to sell, you'd want to get the best price and would probably get somebody to broker something OTC, right? Just my humble analysis, but I think somebody is spending/losing a ton of money for no other reason than to drive the price down.
Amen
Please let me know what you find, good info to have.
I have like 8h time diff with him. To many entries in the middle of night here.
You're right. You had that issue once or twice where you didn't post exits right after. But still you tend to move them so you would have to have separate key word to move them.
> This is what I did yesterday. There was a clear resistance line formed on the 1h and I went long once the market made its way above that line and confirmed it as support. The red dot marks my entry.

Reading that was like a revelation after reflecting on my recent chopped up knife catching dca shitstorms in the same area.  
I'm not setting limit buys, just setting alerts around support lines and see if they hold before entering position. For me the best support for a long should be around 8850 (support line from the last dips to 8600) but you mentioned that if it gets there you'll probably close yours. 
I was doing that math this morning as well. We retraced 12% off the top, which is a moderate cooldown. Another run of half the size over the same period (14 days) doesn't actually seem that implausible. 
> before seeing even a moderate correction.

It depends on what you call "moderate".   As I said, I'm not gong to sit through a 5% pullback anyway in a long position.

And obviously bouncing off $6800 is not analogous to moving up from $9700.

It seems like extremely low probability this moves to $11,700 any time in the next few weeks.  Of course the price can be artificially pumped anywhere, but I have a bearish bias at the moment, based on the 1d chart.
I don't know why you are getting triggered and constantly implying I am new to this market. What part don't you understand? This is NOT 2014. And in due time, this will become a matter of fact.

Technology improves much faster when it nears adoption stage and I think we're very near.

Blockchain and cryptocurrency are a very new and novel phenomenon. People are trying to rationalize and explain this in terms they're familiar with, the same thing they were doing back then about the internet in 1980. I think the fact that crypto breaks the national boundaries and its rebellion against the establishment resonates with every person to some extent. There so much misery in the world and people will pay good money for hope.  This is one giant cult that people pay good money to be a part of and if they profit, well, that's just icing on the cake. 
Yes, I understand what you're saying. But even without profit crypto is a hedge against violent depreciation of assets in third world countries, e.g. IRR to USD ratio has increased 100% in the past two year. My sincere hope is gradually growth in line with adoption, too much volatility will kill both profits and adoption. Thank you for an engaging conversation. 
wathever dude.... above 20k in november mark my words
> What is this 'blockchain' and how is it decentralized and how is it different than Bitcoin?

Google is your friend. I'm not interested in taking my valuable time to explain the absolute basics to you.  Hire a tutor if you are that helpless and lost.

> Why is '20k' the magic number that it won't go beyond?

Ummmm...because that was the recent ATH before the bubble popped and the market contracted....and gov'ts started to even more aggressively regulate and ban cryptocurrencies.

I'm really curious where else you think I could have gotten that $20K number from.  You are funny.
read my other responses -- but I would suggest you use a very small balance on 100x to start and probably blow your account out 3-5 times before you start to get a grasp of what you are doing wrong and get it corrected. Most common issues are 1) lazy/bad entries or 2) not cutting your losses fast enough when the trade is not behaving correctly
also I am glad you responded -- I have spent years talking about this technique back to OKC futures launch in 2014. Most think I am either entirely insane or just trolling but I actually am not. In terms of an example with 100x I am not quite sure I know what you mean. I have explained a little more in a few more of my responses to you though. One thing I like to say is a lot of people grow up learning how to play Texas Hold'em poker and maybe at some point in time they learn Omaha -- at first glance it seems just like hold'em but with 4 cards instead of 2 cards but actually the game dynamics in terms of hand strength are entirely different and you see people with a flush or two pair betting heavy but that isn't that great of a hand in omaha. So the analogy is that those learning to trade on spot no leverage or spot low leverage are priming themselves to overconfidence in being able to apply their current habits and methods to 100x and be successful. So in order to learn you need to experience what you are doing wrong so start on 100x on a very very small balance and then you start to see where the holes in your risk management and style are. It could be for example that you are breakout/FOMO trader and you immediately get an entry where you are under water. Or maybe you are a counter trend trader trying to snipe a bottom. All those are valid methods but your entry and execution is far more important at 100x then it was at 3.3x -- precision matters 
I'm also watching this: https://www.tradingview.com/x/CjtUR7V7/  

I'm hoping to reenter under 9100
Yeah it's not the right time to add to these new longs.  Of course, if we go to 9500, and stabilize there, then yes, this is the right time in hindsight.  But for now the RR and price ranges are perfect on protecting some profit.
I have alarms set at night so it's no different from waking up from one of those. 
It would be a battery saver sometimes because i could turn of 4G connection and still receive notifications
Oh ya, that's a good point as well. 

I definitely think it could be done though. Just matters if somebody wants to take the time and effort to build it. 

I will say it would be a pretty useful addition to the sub in general. Because anybody could configure it to follow anybody's trades, provided we all agreed to use the same syntax. 
For me as well, but it does require a massive amount of time to monitor the market in this fashion. If trading is not a full time job, or if you value sleep, there can be a lot of missed opportunities. That's why I think your DCA method can be pretty useful, even if not ideal.
> getting triggered

Don't worry, I'm not a snowflake.

> constantly implying I am new to this market

Because your reddit account was created in 2017 (OK, fine, maybe you had others before); because you write like you're young and immature; because your brash confidence implies you haven't been hardened in the fires of *true* bear markets (in crypto or elsewhere, and I'm not talking about flash crashes and corrections). Or really market exposure in general...nobody that has been around the block a few times writes with such confidence about future prices. At best, they'll write about higher probabilities, price ranges, risk to reward and such. You're more confident that we're on the verge of another bull market than I am that the sun will rise tomorrow.

By the way, I do think another bull market / bubble will happen, and new ATHs will happen. Just not tomorrow, or next week. I think this summer is very unlikely, and this year is unlikely but possible. Past that, I don't know. Unlike you, I'm not making ironclad predictions. So it's a lot easier for you to be proven wrong than for me.

You don't have to, but I'd be interested to know when you found out about / invested in Bitcoin/crypto. I would assume late 2016 at the earliest, probably sometime in 2017. Is that right? No shame in it if so. I'm just curious.
You're right, and I share your hope. Thanks to you as well! This went far better than I expected; usually something like this turns into partisan nonsense and name-calling instead of a genuine exchange of ideas. Cheers!
then back down to 10k.. then back up to 20k..
i dont think moon...a trader's toy..
I understand what a blockchain is. I'm asking what this *other* blockchain is that is worth something and how it operates differently than Bitcoin.

In terms of 20k, we've heard this "Bitcoin is deducted" argument so many times at this point. Nothing has fundamentally changed except that the tech is constantly being developed and improving. Yea, Bitcoin bubbled quite a bit, largely due to noobs entering the space and the FOMO because of futures launching. That doesn't mean that growth has permanently stagnated, just that Bitcoin needs to undergo price Discovery and enough coins need to change hands before continuing up again. The equilibrium market cap is undoubtedly in the trillions or tens of trillions of dollars based on disruptive use cases. Again, barring a black swan.

These are still very much the early days.
I understand. And I will definitely try out this over the weekend. I meant how much should I bet, $10 at 100X?and say I make an entry at 9K what should I keep as my stop and how do I take profits? 
Shit now I'm nervous seeing that ;)  I had raised ca of my new position from 9000 to 9100 this morning and the SL is pretty close now too at 9030, hmmm we'll see if that's a mistake, I took some profits at 9400 but that will only cover half of the stop loss.

Anyway, you are being careful and level headed about your entry and not just jumping straight in!  So don't regret if you miss it, especially considering the last few days.  Best of luck to you.
I'm considering a plan that's a little bit risky (mostly profit risk, not principle risk). As I see it, our channel support is around 8825. If we can bounce around between 9100-9300 for another few hours, that support should be up to 8860. My plan is to set a 50% profit stop at 8980 and then adjust the leverage to 10x. That should reduce my position to 25% of what it is now (principle) still CA @ 8750. I'd add it all back at 8880, which should make my CA 8845, then set a SL just below my average.

It's probably too much to do. I'm fairly confident that if 8900 breaks, my position is in significantly higher risk of getting stopped out anyway, though. Might be worth rolling the dice.
You need bigger battery ;-)

I only set alarms when I'm in big lev position, I don't do it on low lev and when I'm out.
Another problem. I could become the sub's top trader by saying !openlong 100

People already post winning positions (oh yeah, I opened this 2 hours ago), but having any sort of tracking with the ability to sort would make this ten times worse. 


Syntax is not a problem until it's always the same. It even doesn't have to be the same if you use keywords. !openlong 5x, !setsl 8500, !movesl 8800 etc.
And about effort. Maybe not especially a bot but I can build a site that parses all those and show who is in position with all the details and history in real time.
Thanks.  I do still like this strategy that jaredrag and haserfauld introduced me to.

Had I not got caught in panic loops things actually would have ended perfectly fine.  What I mean to say is that chewy's advice here would have prevented at least one of my panic loops where I was already watching the market, and manually intervened to my detriment and then reset either risky or less optimized limits.  I didn't mean that I would drop laddering for his all-in approach.  I simply cannot manage all-in/all-out.

The specific strategy that chewy put here is just so clear and obvious.  Previously I wouldn't have considered the same timing on how it broke support there.  I wouldn't normally have waited for it to go back down after breaking, resulting in too high ca.  And then on the way down if I did wait long enough, I wouldn't have confirmed resistance as quickly, and would have waited longer to get further away from the line, again resulting in higher ca there.

Had I not watched the market at all that day, and left the orders and position in place, I'd have the *exact* same ca as now, and a few percent more on the trading stack.  Except, the position would be 3x larger and way deeper in profit.  (though the larger position is why i reacted so emotionally in the first place)
that means a lot of people are buying you dont make any sense dude are you high on crack?
Profit risk is the best kind of risk, unless you are in the doghouse for a previous bad trade and need to work your way up.

Sounds like a solid plan if you are willing to manage it.  I'll just stop mine all out a bit higher and try to reenter lower, but I need to lock profits for where I am in my trade log after a series of attrition losses, and my ca is already too high at 8900 for this game.  However your plan has less risk of ending up in no position at all, and then trying to reenter, and then getting chopped up, so go for it. 
I use it every time. If i'm in position to move my stop loss when price goes in my favor (no trailing stops on kraken). If i have no stop loss set then i use them to control price and see if i need to close the position.
Most of the times i just wake up, check price, do something and go back to sleep. If i take too long then i will take more time falling asleep after.
its the same traders buying on the way up shorting on the way down
no new money coming in.. no 100,000 users a day on coinbase like in dec.

seen the marketcap lately?  it grew from 200 to 420 bilkion..   thats new money sir
it was short covering and margin expansion maybe some new institutional buyers.

are you god?
how come all the trading is OTC and the volume on coinbase is 12k @10,000 and mostly bots now.  Before the exchange was so overloaded with newbs spamming market buys it would freeze up 10x a day lol.

OTC is instituional or whale buying.. there's no new fish coming in.


only couple percent of all people know bitcoin... everybody i know doesnt no shit about it... so people will keep flooding in around the world... also people age you know!!!  young people get older and interested in finance and bitcoin...  you dont make sense.... ill leave it here
