[Daily Discussion] Sunday, April 08, 2018 -- TITLE
#New post: [\[Daily Discussion\] Monday, April 09, 2018 →](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8avoxb/daily_discussion_monday_april_09_2018/)
We are facing a crisis of confidence that is eroding the public's trust in our bitcoinmarkets, and poses a real threat to our comment health, ... The strain on the daily discussion is deep and spreading. We have the remedy, /u/jarederaj. Welcome aboard!
Since we're in uncharted territory and there is not enough data to determine seasonality or cyclical trends within the BTC market, I just want to note that it's very possible that market participants will try to position themselves before the majority; stepping over one another to get a better base price. In this sense, a bull market could initiate before a "satisfactory" level of accumulation. I'm not in any way saying this is the start of a new bull market. What I'm inferring is that your expectations of where price should bottom out (in the low ball 4-5k area) should not surprise you if it doesn't materialize.
Gemini charges 1% fee if your monthly volume < 10BTC. It is outrageously high fee. I am leaving this platform. 
I find it unsurprising that Bitcoin would draw the attention of a man like Soros. 

If you’ve read his (brilliantly titled) “Alchemy of Finance”, it’s not hard to imagine the man viewing Bitcoin as being the world’s first primiparous “toy model” of an economy; one which demonstrifies what he’s laid out in writing.   
Namely, a domain where there is no such thing as a fundamental or “fair price” of an asset. But rather, prices of assets rise and fall as if in response to some weird force of social gravity. Where things are valued according to an amorphously changing, complex matrix of market participants’ own expectations and biases. 

That the act of engaging with something changes its perceived value.  
That the collective unconscious and prevailing trends of society gives rise to the rippling cycles of financial bubbles and self (over)-correcting price moves (e.g., the crazy run in December to ~20k, primarily because a slice of the world convinced itself that this thing *is going* to the moon. right. fucking. now. And people were desperate to not be left behind). The counterpart, or *yin* to that yang, are when events fail to occur … simply due to the fact they’ve been so thoroughly anticipated.  

To borrow some medieval Buddhist imagery, one can probably look at the entirety of the crypto market as one vast [Indra’s net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indra%27s_net) … only instead of jewels, there’s shitcoins with stupid cyber-goth names like “TRON”.

watching this potential rising wedge

https://www.tradingview.com/x/RtozXGX1/
The euphoria I get when I see a bit of green makes me realize how my expectations have drastically changed from end of 2017.
This has been an interesting afternoon to say the least. My hopium level is at maximum, and I'll explain why.

[This is my chart today](https://www.tradingview.com/x/zNdoYTlE). I know, I know, it has too many lines but they all work. They are from old resistances, I checked "infinite" when I drew them so they help me see long term.

As you can see, today we got into the purple triangle. We broke it down and went to test the green line that acts as support since we started climbing from 6500ish two days ago. But then, something magical happened: In order not to dump, it had to avoid breaking that line, break the previous support turned resistance AND break the EMA9. Bears of course saw this and put a 2000 btc wall to prevent that from happening. IT GOT EATEN, NOT PULLED.

Another thing is this: [this is the order book from when we had to break those 3 heavy resistances in order to avoid a dump.](https://imgur.com/4IyDL91) See how there are no "walls"? unless there is a very dedicated whale putting walls at random prices and intervals, those are genuine buyers. I said a couple of days ago I was hoping for the market to have found its bottom. Now I am more hopeful than ever.

As of right now, we are fighting the 7035 green line that has been acting as resistance for nearly a week by now. But clearly, bulls are more confident, the average trader/hodler doesn't want to sell, and bears seem to be exhausted.

As for me, I am out of any position, apart from my cold storage hold, since I once again refuse to trade against the trend and I still need a few more days of consolidation until I can either declare the bear trend over, or this just being a fake.

Any thoughts?

EDIT: spelling
Life protip: if you make a mistake, learn, dust yourself off, move on. 

Last time the price was at $7000, had less bitcoin than I have now. And that's all that matters right now. Yes, I feel a small amount of regret as to how I played the market, and how much I *could* have made. Could'a Should'a Would'a. But in life, whenever you let the Could'a Should'a and Would'a get you down, you're doing nothing except causing yourself pain. Nothing good can come of that. I've got like *four* longs near $7000. Small ones in Bitmex's Perpetual Swap, June and August Futures, and Bitfinex.

Best of luck trading, everyone :)

Disclaimer: I’m a noob to crypto and investing. I don’t know shit but im doing econ at uni and need to practice structured writing lol. Feedback is welcome.

My Chart [1]

Slowly getting bullish but cautiously.  

Why bullish? Well, we’re tight on most time frames including weekly. If this weekly candle can close around 7400 then I’ll get a bit more optimistic as we slowly creep up (would that make an inside bar on weekly with some decent bullish momentum??).

The positive news seems to be creeping in as well, Soros [2] and supposedly Rockefeller [3] getting in. at the same time, I think the news that they’re just getting in is bullshit. When BTC was flying up 20k and everyone was talking about it is when I think they got in. They knew it would go down and started shorting. If you know anything about Soros then you know this is how he likes to do things. Short it at 20k, call it a bubble on the way down to add more sell pressure. It bottoms, starts moving sideways and you suddenly announce you’re only just getting in to drive price up [google trends are bottomed and possible curving (4)]. 

Question is, are Soros and Rockefeller announcing that they’re in to drive the price up? This tweet [5] sums up how Soros plays. If you really don’t know who he is and what he does, consider looking into it. Crazy shit, look up what he did to Bank of England (Sept 1992) and the Bank of Thailand (1997 I think). Long story short, the guy doesn’t play nice. A max pain scenario (explored lower) wouldn’t surprise me as that’s what he likes. HOWEVER, apparently, he holds a lot of Overstock [6] so announcing he’s in the market to drive the price up also makes sense. He ties up the market, bends it over and fucks it as much as he can. Fair play to him though, made a shit load doing it.

Why cautiously? Soros made me think of a max pain scenario. I’ve been watching crypto since September 2017. I started putting money into the market around November. Rode up through December and had no intention selling. I always read that I should take profits cos the start of the bear market will make me puke and by the end of it, ill want to off myself.

I’ve not puked yet. I started getting interested around September JP Morgan/China [7+8] fud (-40% in 14 days followed by +160% into November) and then I started getting invested around the Segwit2x drama [9] (nearly -30% in 4 days followed by 240% to December peak). I’ve never invested in stocks so crypto volatility is only volatility I know. Am I just immune to it as this is all I know or have we not seen max pain yet?

Now, what could max pain look like? I doubt it will happen but imagine how brutal it would be. First, rally up to 9300. We’d break the downtrend resistance from 11700. Once we hold 7400-7600 bears will be either underwater or getting cautious, a rally to 9300 would wreck the bears from below 6800 and put bears from 7400-7600 underwater.
So, a rally to 9300 fucks the bears. Once the bears are fucked, bulls start to get happy. Once we break and hold 7400-7600 I can really see a lot of bulls jumping in to not miss the train. Bulls pile in, push the price to 9300 and then bam, we reserve for max pain. Where would we drop to? I can see 6k for a clear double bottom or a wonky triple bottom. Or, true max pain would be a drop to 4600-5000. That would extend the bear market by a good while though as bulls would have PTSD.

But I don’t think even that would make me puke.

As a whole, I think Soros and Rockefeller have had their fun shorting from 20k and now he’s announcing that he’s investing in the market to spark the fomo. Max pain is very much possible but unlikely I think. If we break and hold 7400-7600 then I might try to ride it up to 9300 and see what happens there. Whilst BTC moves sideways and up im gonna be looking at alts. BTC dominance is currently at 45% [10]. The December-January alt season was my first and I didn’t play it too well. Not making the same mistake twice. Rather be prepared and have an eye on some positions I like and not make it up as I go along. Did that last time, result was okay but fuck me it could have been so much better. 

BUT i am still being very careful. Bears might still have a good case, volume isn't looking great, weekly RSI is below 55 which acted as support and resistance (although it is now sat at 44 which has been a decent support). Daily RSI hasn’t broken from a downtrend and is below 46 which has acted as a resistance.

My levels and why I like them:

9100-9200: Very, very interesting level. Acted as resistance, was broken and retested twice end of November before running away to 16k. Provided support on 17/01/18 swing low resulting in a bounce to 13k. Fell through convincingly on second test on 01/02/18, turned resistance, tested AND rejected 03-04/02/18 dropping all the way to 5920. Did not provide much resistance on 14/02/18 and was almost tested on 15/02/18 before running away to 11700. After rejection at 11740 it acted as a beautiful support on 25/02/18 which permitted the bounce back to 11700. After the 11700-double top, the level got washed a bit before being tested as resistance on 14/03/18 and dropping to 7400-7700. Acted as resistance again after that bounce which pushed the price all the way down to the 6400-swing low.

7200 needs breaking+holding to break yesterdays (07/04/18) swing high to attempt 7400-7700 which acted as resistance earlier in the month, provided strong wick bounce on 18/03/18. However, this level didn’t do much in during February dump to 5920 BUT was a very active level in November. First acted as resistance that resulted in a dump to 5900 (meaning that if 7200 didn’t hold in Feb then 5900 was the next level to watch). After it was broken as resistance in November, was tested as a support which resulted in a goodbye kiss and a strong bounce to 9800. Another very interesting level in my opinion.

6430 crucial to hold -> weekly HL from 5920 swing low

4980-4590 for max pain

2980- last hope

[I just noticed that Gemini raised their fees to 1%](https://gemini.com/trading-fee-schedule/) for < 5 BTC monthly trades. That's a four fold increase.

That's insane. What the hell are they doing? [GDAX is %0 maker / 0.30% taker](https://www.gdax.com/fees) 

Even GDAX supports Segwit now, Gemini does not. I can't think of any reason to use Gemini .



Looks like twitter deleted @bitcoin and someone registered it for themselves lol

Volume has been picking up on finex. Several big pumps today. Staying out of position
https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8apt8i/of_daily_hodl_comments_on_reddit_over_time_oc/

HODL comments seemed to have bottomed at Nov. 2017 levels.
Another bullish outlook:

According to this comparision to the NASDAQ bubble [https://imgur.com/a/NF6YV](https://imgur.com/a/NF6YV) we should have reached the end of the bubble. The time span is much tighter on the x\-axis, but this might does not matter, as Bitcoin moves always faster than stock markets. According to the y\-axis  we should have dropped harder, but on the chart the y\-axis of NASDAQ does not start at 0 and the peak of the NASDAQ bubble is lower than the BTC peak. \(Its a chart from godmode traders.\)
Short $1.2m @ $7044. Expecting a 3%+ drop in a very near term. Rise was too quick and expected, gas already running out. Longs will close. Etc.

Stops at 4%. 
This volume is lower than Hermes Conrad in his prime limbo days.

Any suggestions for a guy using a highly configurable trading bot?
GDAX BTCEUR volume under 1k, it's been a looong time
We've seen a lot of talk about similarities to the 2014 bubble so I made an [overlap image](https://i.imgur.com/2qWG8RI.png) that shows the 5 month current graph in blue vs a graph of 2014. Based on this it looks like we're pretty close to the bottom and its probably not a bad idea to buy on the next dip. 

Edit: to clarify I mean the bottom before the June pump.  Not the real bottom of Jan 2015.
Out of all BTC positions for this week, and things doesn't look that bad to the upside actually when looking at 12h here https://www.tradingview.com/x/dHvst1IJ

First target is that 7200 short term resistance, that might turn into a support for an eventual next move to that big downtrend to 9k. But before that maybe horizontal 7800 level

I also see that all the lows have very long wicks below them which is good bottom signals and that price bounce up quickly

Also interesting to see that the wild action on ETH has stopped and now the battle is between 360 and 400$. since it got hit more than BTC in the last months, now might be the time to either buy more or look for trades on the ratio
Damn gdax 24hr volume is bullish af! Haven't seen it this high since Nov-Dec 2017! Definitely going long!
Opened a hedge short at around $7,100. Seems like the only logical thing to do here. Stops above $7,300. 

Edit: bearish divergence on the 1h and 2h

Potential hidden bearish divergence on the 12h as well. 
If this shit actually holds above 6k until the next mega run, I will be very (but pleasantly) surprised.
In the next few hours we'll (likely) either see us [breaking through the monthlong downtrend or an end to the current pump](https://www.tradingview.com/x/JL4kKcps/). I've put in my short earlier and I'm sticking to it for now.
ETH seems to be singly handedly leading the market resurgence.

Seems reasonable considering it's arguably unfounded market cap obliteration.
Look at bitfinex, why would any retail investor trust this market right now?
just closed out a long from 6800 at 7120. it's guaranteed to hit a new ATH tonight because of that. 
[removed]
Subtle but present bearish div on the 1H, closed my long from 6600 and opened a short at exactly 7000. SL 7250 in case there's a last leg up out of nowhere but doesn't look like it.
Meh, closed my short from 7060 on the futures here, this market feels to indecisive and I do not want to be catched on the wrong end. Hopefully tomorrow when it's monday a more clear direction emerges
Does anyone had a modified version of the Bitfinex / Bitstamp long-term charts without those random glitchy wicks down to $1.50 in 2016 (stamp), and $100 in Feb 2014 (finex)? 

It really makes it hard to long-term chart as it majorly whacks out the Log view.
Unusual for a sunday

If I were a scalping man this is a good short entry point for a solid 100 swing within the rising wedge, overbought* on 30m and just almost oversold on 1hr
Just read that Soros is getting into the crypto game and that he plans to pump our bags so we can all get rich together. He is quite the philanthropist after all. 

Bullish. 
Charting question: is this rising wedge still valid? (4h)

https://www.tradingview.com/x/lWfgrHfO/
I honestly feel that this is some type of bull trap. I ain't falling for it (anymore... or at least right now.)
I know a large crypto holder who exited fully in March with the expectation that tax season would be a bloodbath this year. He's in fiat waiting to re-enter.

How common do you suspect this is?  How much of this crash's selling was due to the expectation of others' tax burdens?
I'm feeling that supply is really drying up here. The people who are buying now are getting more ambitious with their targets with all these resistances coming down. I don't mean to say that demand is increasing but people are starting to buy coins and hold on to them for the long term, it seems.
looks like 15m ma cross started to form to the downside, still keeping my nice short from 7061 on futures. 6850 is target i think
has anyone found traders who live stream crypto trading with analysis? i'm surprised how few streams i'm finding
Wow everyone is bullish once again, just like a few days ago when we were sitting at 7500.

I want the next bull run as much as most bulls do but I think it's a bit delusional to consider $6950 as a bullish price point.  We can't post higher highs and we're posting marginally higher lows.

I personally think we're in a huge descending wedge but don't think it's going to break up until a couple of weeks.
The fact that we broke out of the falling wedge almost 24h ago now and are still sitting below the high of that breakout doesn't make me feel very confident about any bullish sentiment.
About to reach overbought on the 1hr which will lead to some pretty big hidden bearish divs from the 7.5 peak. 

Looking to close my long here and double up on my short around 7.1.

EDIT: long closed at 7095 on perps, nothing added to short yet because GF will kill me if i chartwatch much longer.
So, now there's big spoofys on the buy side and noone's  complaining?

Right.

Edit: I stand corrected, he's actually buying it seems.

Nice bullish setup occurring on the 15 min. could well perform and get us into a short term bull.
https://www.tradingview.com/x/0SM9qtEo/

Also on a macro level, the stoch RSI had a bullish cross on the weekly. 




4000 bitcoin walls. As if anyone is going to "buy it" . 

Oh cool. Now is 5000. Well, at least rsi is really oversold now. Maybe it will pump again now.

Edit Yep. 100 btc bought, and sell walls pulled. 
Can I ask everyone a question: who would trust Bitfinex with such amount of money (huuuge walls we don't see on other exchanges) after they got hacked and are generally in a very grey area?
One guy on here shorted a million bucks at 7350. You guys are getting played like a fiddle by the btc 1%'ers.
Does anyone have data on Bitcoin (since its inception) in reference to inflation and currency value vis a vis the American dollar? 
there is a 4700 btc sell wall on bitfinex
Staying out till 7500 breaks, better play it safe.
[Yolo'd a long at 7027](https://www.tradingview.com/x/dGyr86RK). It's been trying to break that 7035 barrier for the last 2 hours, I'm confident.

SL is in place already of course.
it's more like a large OTC trade being negotiated/settled real time while we and other exchanges watching.
Bulls pushing this to over 7k again, breaking resistance after several attempts. Why should I be bearish again? Legit question, not being a smart ass... 
Just for kicks, what possible FUD could come out these next few days to initiate a downturn sub 6k?
My daily analysis looking at:

* Bitcoin's push higher but possible bearish signs
* Ethereum moving to retest resistance
* Litecoin's continued dip to test support
* Monero as it also tests support levels

https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@matthew-analysis/daily-crypto-analysis-8th-apr-technical-analysis
So much buy pressure that we start eating into this 2k wall. That means something I think.

Set a Remindme! if you don't believe

Do I lose any money if I open a position before funding periods and exit it before I have to pay up funding for my position? Was wondering a I'm planning on some scalp positions with high leverage up to 25x, and will exit after $20-$30 movements 
Someone mentioned that whales often like to pump the price up in the short term in order to liquidate shorts before dumping again. 

What would be the benefit to them in doing this? 
Anyone else experiencing that Bitmex UI started to feel a bit sluggish? Is it just me or because the huge order volume/ticks updated so often ?
Think we have the volume to make it to the .786 fib at 7241?

https://www.tradingview.com/x/TlmDwvDj/
By the way, is there a reason no one (like it seems?) is market making on the futures on Bitmex? Sometimes it's a 10$ spread, for a bot or someone know what they are doing, this seems like easy money

Bears vs Bulls, like we do, but smarter.

https://play.google.com/music/m/D5sqkuy7is5yzuzbbry4or6iteu?t=TIP185_The_Bitcoin_Debate_part_1_w_Tuur_Demeester_Erik_Townsend_Investing_Podcast_-_We_Study_B Illinois 

I'm a bull who has never openly declared a position. If I can work onions into my diet, I can post a trade.

Long from $6954. New money (of my own) entering the market, boys.

I have a tight stop at $6888 with short term targets of $7,417, $7,929, and, finally, $8936.
I'm short term bullish (bought it at 6700) and think we can reach low 8000. Haters will say I should have closed at 7100.
calling it now. the bear market is over. If ETH breaks through the trendline(and price action indicates it will), this will pull BTC up to 7500, completing the pattern of a solid double bottom over the last week.

And both ETH and BTC are due for a serious retracement and any retracement is just going to further confirm the support they have been finding at current prices over the last week.

I think we'll be back at 12,000 by the end of the month
heads up in case someone else has this but my tradingview bitfinex feed stopped auto reloading, other sites pulling fine, bfxdata flowing normal. if anyone else can confirm
https://www.tradingview.com/x/S6ccLvh5/

This is what I'm looking at. The resistance line around 7k seems to act as support now, it has still to confirm but then the small ascending channel we're in should bring us to the month long resistance line (going through 11.7k and 9k) which is also the top of a 2 month long [descending wedge](https://www.tradingview.com/x/kGJ3iyHj/). 

All in all my opinion is that it will turn out just like in [february](https://www.tradingview.com/x/YdRLFJ1c/) where the buying pressure won't be enough to break out of the wedge and we will plunge to a lower low (my bet is low 5k).

Thoughts?
Of course, take my shower thoughts with a grain of salt. But I personally think all the bullish news that came out in the past couple days is to get people to buy back in so that we can dump one more time before an actual bounce. 
good frikkiin shite i closed my short at 6.6

being out of position is so much better than being underwater.

again, i expect a test of 8.4 if not 7.7 (which was the breakdown point) and hope the bears are prepared for this possibility.




No wonder GDAX fees are going up. Price is almost 1:1 to 24-hour BTC volume.
How is bitmex so incredibly bullish right now compared to spot despite a positive funding rate?  

Talk about the real counter sentiment trade. 
[deleted]
Looks quite bullish how this bear whale tries to spoof the price down with his 5k sell walls and people start buying 100s coins from it and price holds strong.
PSA: whales put up massive walls to get people to buy or sell in the opposite direction into their limit orders. 

The 5k btc wall is more "bullish" than anything
I strongly feel that people saying Soros and new ETF's are coming to save us forgot about how good the Chinese new year and wall street bonuses were.

Maybe, just maybe there is some possible bullishness when the next tax year starts though (am I thinking in a week)? But Soros, no.
On the aggregate, those who hold [non-bullshit] crypto(s) tend to be the ideologically-influeced independent minds with above par economic value skills. 

The folks keen on writing the trajectory of tomorrow.

The folks who will hold disproportionate power in a rapidly evolving, tech-underpinned global context.

That's part of why I hold crypto long term. 

User/holder demographic among the most important considerations when appraising any asset/asset class.
Feeling super comfy with my 3x long from 6913. This is now my second ever trade and I’ve made the right move. Stops at break even. Won’t be around PC today for 16 hours so I hope bitcoin is on my side. 
Wtf is with all this talk of Soros coming into crypto? Didn't he owe billions in unpaid taxes so he donated all his money to his charities so they couldn't take it from him?

Tbh this fake 7k sell wall on bitfinex is making me bullish af, closed my short for a small win and will sit this one out unhedged.
* Vitamin D deficiency
* Bipolar Depression
* Nonvolatile BTC price

... don't know where I'm going with this. Here's a pretty chart:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/OBNImI9l/

One time I saw a license plate that read 333-RUN, so when I got home, I started running around the block. Now I see 333 everywhere.

There is some amazing accumulation going on which leaves me to believe good rebound is upon us the coming days /weeks. thought?
Baseless, speculative Spoofy prediction: he's testing how high the market wants to go, using walls on both side to gauge fear/greed sentiment, and will let some of the asks get eaten when he thinks price is high enough and/or market dump a ton at that point. Then will drive the price back down once everyone has bought in and is ready to panic sell.
Longs starting to close, the 36k remaining can only hope that whales pump it for them, not exactly bullish.
Really great times for you bulls right now. It takes so little to make you happy. Enjoy!

My first TA based on Elliott waves. Could still go down to 5k but the long term trend would be to 40k by end of year.

We went "high enough," and dipped, and now he is unloading into the people trying to buy the dip.

I didn't *know* this, but it's interesting to see that my theory seems to hold some water.

We have started a better Sunday comparatively, more people joining the rally. Weekend dip was too weak. 7K inbound.
6h EMAs about to cross the first time since 25th March.
Let's see if the right part of Barts head breaks down now or not, yesterday there was a lot of buying when it started https://www.tradingview.com/x/xMN7sxLM
Daily tdi crossed. The last time it crossed the upside was feb 11 and we had a nice run up.

I admit that this is an odd one... But there’s a kind of head and shoulder forming on the 30 min chart:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/KobSTWv0/

Target would be ~6640.
1k buy walls pop up out of nowhere on finex... bullwhales take over! currently 3k buy walls below.

Edit: got pulled, best is to ignore them completly, in the end these walls \- regardless if sell or buy \- do not have big implications on the market. 
Finally set up an electrum wallet, time to start accumulating.

Lighten your stack a little for capital reserves. 

Could quickly resume turbulence.
Soros coming into crypto will usher in a new era of bulishness as the Bogdanoffs hunt the stoplosses on his short all the way to $200k/btc.
Very flat market, isn't that one of the more reliable bull signals?

We are looking at a spread of 60 dollars over the past 2 hours, I'm tying remember the last time that happened and I'm drawing a blank

Talking about shorts or longs, I strongly concur that it is not a good time to go short, except if you want to risk and make a few tens of bucks. The price is not going below 7K range.

I closed my 3 days old long from 6756 @ 7089 today. Waiting for another slight dip around 7K to go long again. 
Head and shoulders forming on the 1 hour?

Can anyone confirm with facts if there has been a double bottom on 4hr?
[deleted]
Had one of my best scalping days in many months, literally bought the bottom and sold the top for a total 7 successful trades in a row. The punchline? Just sold the $6.9k bottom an hour ago! Serves me right.

It's funny, too, because that $6.9k point was where I wanted to pick up some more (it's where it touches the resistance-turned-support-turned-resistance-turned support line we've been flirting with all day)...but fear got the best of me and I had to lighten my bags in case it was the start of one of those $100-in-60-seconds dumps.

Thanks! I'll be most active on week days and I plan to keep my finger off the ban button as much as possible. 

Continue reporting content that violates our rules and I'll mop up whatever I can.
Congrats  /u/jarederaj !
There goes the neighborhood 
well deserved and congrats 
Great news!
fantastic choice, much thanks for Jarederaj for volunteering.
Excellent choice!
Good choice, this will be a good thing. The guy knows his trading, is polite, and has a lot of experience and history on the sub. Cheers.
Nice seeing the garbage posts get [removed] when refreshing the thread today.
nice, he'll make a great mod I'm sure.
Congrats man! Best of luck
Good to see some developments here. It's a hard job, respect and thanks to all voluntary moderators. Excellent choice on /u/jarederaj.
sickkkk love that mang
Awesome

Make sure to implement his genius strike policy.
.... Are you serious? This guy is a total clown. He spent an entire thread arguing until he was blue in the face that alt coins are fractional reserve banking, which is mind bending in itself, and then refused to listen for dozens of comments.

The guy is hard headed as hell and knows less about bitcoin markets than a basket weaver. This is the kind of shit that is destroying this sub. 

Users like him ARE the strain on the daily discussion. He should be moderated, not made a mod. Jesus christ
Sup Jarederaj!
I doesn't matter how pretty the traders draw their TA. In the end it is the fundamentals -- demand and supply -- that dominates the price action. While TA affects market sentiment, it is not enough to go against the the real force for that much. Speculations of 3-5k etc are baseless if they don't have a good fundamental reason to predict it.
I don't know how they think they can get away with a fee that high, particularly when there are other options available. 
Use GDAX. Limit/Maker orders are free regardless of volume. I'll be sad if they ever change that because I wouldn't be able to do all my little trades otherwise.
> demonstrifies

Did you mean demonstrates ? Or that it actually removes monsters ?

Edit: +1 for primiparous. I'll have to try working that word into sentences now.

> Namely, a domain where there is no such thing as a fundamental or “fair price” of an asset.

I haven't read him, but does he explain why, since "money" and "price" are social concepts, there is no such thing as "fair price" for anything, fundamentally.

Of course, like clicking the first solid blue text link on any Wikipedia article, this line of argument always eventually ends up back at philosophy.
Agree with all of this.

> But rather, prices of assets rise and fall as if in response to some weird force of social gravity. Where things are valued according to an amorphously changing, complex matrix of market participants’

This is effectively just the value of a network and changes in a different way to a typical asset. I think this is what throws most people or tricks them into thinking it should behave differently. 
Upvote for primiparous, the word of the day.  I would suggest another Soros word is more appropriate for the crypto economy: reflexivity.  It's a herd mentality / reinforcement loop, too far up on the bull runs to the moon, huge correction downwards and crypto is dead, and the cycle repeats.  

I think Soros said his entire fortune was based on that theory and it makes complete sense to me as a contrarian.  Buffett basically says the same with his "be greedy when everyone else is fearful and fearful when everyone is greedy," and the whole buy when there's blood in the streets, etc. 
There is no such thing as a "fundamental price" or "fundamental value" of anything in the objective sense, regardless of the domain that you're talking about. There is only the "market price" (which is the fair price a buyer and seller use to transact at any given moment under free market conditions) and the infinity of values that all of us each subjectively ascribe to an asset from moment to moment.

Bitcoin is unique compared to other assets not because it lacks a "fundamental" value, but because there is such a wide difference of opinion regarding its fundamental value.

And that's just one reason why it is by far the most interesting thing going on in the world today.

I bought a beer today, just because it had blockchain in the name......I also bought one because it had SpaceX in the name. I don't know the point, but they are both things I like. They were both excellent.
I saw that wall go down but where is the follow through? Someone wanted to buy 2k coins only at $7k?
If it was a genuine wall then perhaps it was trying to attract Soros. lol.
Well said.  Coulda woulda shoulda is no way for someone to do trading
Exactly I'm riding the wave..but these signs are very bearish
Someone ended up posting your article today in our telegram group so I thought I would pull out a few points to discuss with you. Overall your piece is poorly written and is more of an op-ed then an actual analysis. So let's dive into some the points you make in the article.

https://masterthecrypto.com/exchanges-manipulation-cryptocurrency-market/

>Consistently Declining Volume: This leads to lower total fee revenue for exchanges, and an incentive to manipulate the price in order to earn revenue through liquidations rather than trading fees.

Yes the overall volume has been declining -- this is not something new or different than what happens after parabolic moves and we go into a period of consolidation. If you think the volume are bad now take a look during the 11 months sideways in the $200s. They will experience a reduction in trading fee revenue but that doesn't mean it is a binary condition that they need to do something illegal to change that -- they will look to expand other alt markets or maybe even buy a CFD forex exchange or add pairs themselves in other markets if it gets really bad. We also witnessed this during that long period of sideways in the $200s when many of us traders temporarily abandoned crypto trading to trade forex for months -- this time is no different. 

I don't think you have a grasp of the process of liquidation so I will address that later.

>Exponential Increase in Leveraged Positions: Both leveraged shorts and leveraged longs are at or near record levels. Shorts especially have gone from 8K outstanding in January to 33K right now, a whole tripling in outstanding positions.

This is another natural phenomenon and I don't think we are in much disagreement here -- as people that once were able to trade spot see their profits dwindle they will look to leverage/margin trading as a tool to supplement their trading profits by not needing as big of market moves to profit the same. They may even change styles to more of a scalper then a trend trader and utilize leverage that way.

>Both longs and shorts are bets on the price moving up or down and they have a “liquidation price”, at which they get liquidated by the exchange. Essentially, the exchange gets the entire stack they bet with and extracts a high market fee multiplied by the leverage.

This section I have the most issue with as it leads me to believe you actually don't understand the liquidation process -- we will use OKEX for our example (BitMex does nearly the same thing in terms of the liquidation process) when a liquidation occurs it occurs at a breach of maintenance margin — so let's say you pledge 10BTC to a 20x LONG position (10BTC x 20 =  200 BTC nominal position) -- liquidation will occur when the account breaches below 2BTC of remaining collateral (down 8BTC) which is equal to the 20% margin requirement — at the point of breaching below maintenance margin a **LIMIT SELL** gets placed into the book to try and liquidate the position — if the position gets filled any remaining collateral gets placed into the insurance fund where it will be sit there until used to offset future socialized losses. I might add that your liquidation price isn't some complete mystery price as they give you an estimated liquidation price that is usually quite accurate. So at no point is the exchange itself "pocketing" the remaining collateral to count as profits for the exchange -- it just goes to a pooled insurance fund that is updated daily. 


Edit: To be fair one criticism you could bring is that the liquidations aren't transparent enough to know what is the actual remaining collateral of each liquidated position -- there is one daily ledger entry of the collateral collected for that particular day which is really a bundle of 100s of liquidations so it hard to say if for example one liquidation had 2 BTC remaining collateral and BitMex or OKEX are only reporting 1.8 and pocketing the 0.2 -- I am not making any accusations I am just saying that is one vector that is hard to discern if they are being 100% truthful with. I actually wrote about this very criticism a couple years ago now. 


> The current market seems to be largely driven not by organic buying and selling, but by exchange driven manipulation

This happened after the last bubble as well as simple spot trading gives way to derivatives and margin trading -- OKEX futures experiencing record volumes as well 
So long
Good post including citations.  Excellent catch and link for Soros buying Overstock.  Third largest shareholder is a huge position.  This makes me bullish for the moment on his intentions with crypto.  I was nervous when he said dictators use it to stash their ill-gotten gains - thinking maybe he wants to destroy it for the "betterment" of the world.  Hopefully he contributes to the next bull run.  After the bulls run for a while, when he says crypto is overvalued and sells his Overstock, that would be a bearish reversal indicator. 
Damn you sure seem to work hard.  You will probably do ok and good luck.
dem missed chances :-(
Ya, totally agree. I’m still short but I’m happy to see a real market again
https://i.imgur.com/R4dzyTY.png
These walls won't keep the bulls down. They're useless, useless, useless.
Not the message he really wants to be sending. He's telegraphing his panic.
GDAX bumped up fees a bit about a week ago too. I’m guessing some exchanges are starting to feel the impact of the dwindling volume we’ve been seeing and are trying to scrape back what they can. 

Fiat volume for BTC (on GDAX) is only about $58M for 24h. On 0.3% fees that brings in about $175k. Few months ago they were doing probably $1M a day easy. Not gonna get an easier for these guys as the space becomes more competitive. 
Why did Twitter remove the acct of whoever had it before?
The account has been around since at least 2012 and there's no proof that it was compromised (a bunch of brony incels on twitter making the unsubstantiated claim is not proof). The BTC community has really turned into a fucking cult of mindless automatons, ironic considering how it projects this criticism onto BCH supporters. 
Because we hodlrs are napping
Does this graph distinguish between "I'm going to HODL!", "You're a fool to HODL!", "I don't HODL", "Stop saying HODL it's lame" and "WTF do these people mean when they say HODL?"

Wow that’s awesome. Really shows where the greed was highest! 
Nice buy signal.
So how long will we consolidate for? 
i saw that chart already, but still according to this chart we should see another bottom lower than 6k. I mean that at least what happened for NASDAQ. If you now believe those 2 have something in common or not is up to you, but if you compare them then we are not there yet. however soon. i also guess end of april or may.
also this, https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BITFINEX:BTCUSDLONGS , will it break 38k today ?
Good luck man.
I assume stops at less than 10% this time around, no? Maybe 3-5%
What would be your % limit in terms of upside?
Seems like a good r/r here with RSI overbought and rise on low volume...following you on this one. Last time i followed you it worked out pretty good, fingers crossed.
You're playing with fire. The majority of the U.S. tax selling pressure ends this weekend. This is the last weekend you can sell crypto in time to pay the tax man by 4/17.
invest in a sandwich-heavy portfolio.
https://www.reddit.com/r/futurama/comments/1rv4zu/i_found_hermes_irl/?st=JFR3W9G9&sh=2aa2c5a8
there is 0 volume on this sub as well
it's really ridiculous how one gdax/eur 'whale' [sic.] puts up a 5 btc buy wall, another puts up a 6 btc sell wall (0.01 euro higher), and then the price goes flat for like 15 minutes, with bots pushing their 0.01-0.02 btc orders

Makes me feel so bearish. Good to know OP is also on gdax/euro and I am not stuck behind with only bots. 
They raised their fees the other day, now they're among the most expensive exchanges on that market. An associated volume drop is hardly surprising. 
I mean, what do you expect? it follows the USD one with a bit of lag, no moves, no volume. 

If anything i take that as an indicator of how many people have bought or sold bitcoin for fiat...
That graph does not contain the bottom of the 2014/15 bear market.
you're talking about the intermediate bottom yes? the one before the run up to 60% ATH and then down to $170 over another year? 
Overlay 2015
Could you make one where the two peaks overlay?
> Also interesting to see that the wild action on ETH has stopped and now the battle is between 360 and 400$. since it got hit more than BTC in the last months, now might be the time to either buy more or look for trades on the ratio

Aye I definitely moved some ETH to BTC on the way down, I don't know if we're going to see a worse ratio in the short term, may be a sound time to move some back.
It certainly looks like we bottomed . But all this testing is making me uneasy.
Wow just looked at it. That's crazy low
The lower the volume drops with a stable price could indicate a true bottom forming. Time will tell of course.
Mate, can you please help me understand bearish divergence & hidden bearish divergence. Is it that price is setting higher lows while RSI & MACD are setting lower lows ?

I''m looking at the daily chart. From 3/30 to 4/6, closing price decreased from 6840 to 6610, while daily RSI increased from 30 to 33. Is that a bullish divergence?
If you connect the $11.7k and $9k tops, the line is up around $7.3k/$7.4k right now, and we already passed the shorter-term resistance line on volume and have been busy confirming it all day (so far). So, I'm not sure where that dashed red line in your chart is coming from, especially if breaking it signals the end of the monthlong downtrend...just saying.
Bulls will try to paint this double bottom that is in the making since 2 weeks. It looks quite promising. Together with the A&E double bottom this has really the potential to end the bear market for now and we see a retrace to 8.5\-10k.  The 2\-week double bottom is confirmed \>7.5k, at least then we should see some FOMO moves.
I have a long in at this level. I see a bullish MACD cross on the 4hour. Going to exit my trade at 7400 at yesterday’s intraday high
cha-ching. see if it holds.
There are a lot of reasons for ETH to be going up right now, the one thing I fear for it though is that when the bear strikes, ETH ALWAYS gets hit harder than BTC. And unless it gets some real upwards momentum going, it won't go up without BTC. I've found that it needs BTC to go up to "slingshot" off of. 
I made a chart for you. This is my granpa's TA. This shows why ETH may be leading as it is approaching this event from a better angle than Bitcoin, though bitcoin should also move up.

https://imgur.com/a/DvmbC
Impressive ETH and LTC volume on GDAX.  Over 11K traded on each in the past hour.

Multiple 2000 btc sell walls. Nothing out of the ordinary /s
What retail investor is looking at the bitfinex order book right now? 
Exactly. Until Bitfinex collapses or is audited there's just 0 trust in this market. These walls are impossible, no other exchange has such kind of walls. It's not even manipulation - I have no problem with people manipulating the market with their actual coins if they have this much. It's just that these walls might be fake money.
Sounds like a smart move to me.
Thanks brother, we will never forget.
Long? I'd take some profits now, take some more by 7500, keep some of it rolling. 

At least that's how I'm playing my long from an entry of 6660. 
Just going to hodl 
I agree, but right now it's a tough call because the [4H](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Hr2uuoEb/) looks bullish with higher highs and higher lows and declining bearish volume. RSI looks primed for another move up to possibly 7200. 

I tried a small scalp, but got stopped out when we dropped to 6990. I'm gonna sit back until a more decisive move. occurs. I'm about 50/50 holdings/fiat at the moment. 
I just opened one. Don't think whales are going to fuel any pump here. They're waiting for sub-6k
We seem to be at the same level we were yesterday, so today was a waste :) 
> Unusual for a sunday

Very.
Would wait for the 1hr tbh
You were right, good call. 
[deleted]
Unsure whether it is over, but dropped $92 on gdax. Great call.
>Just read that Soros is getting into the crypto game and that he plans to pump our bags so we can all get rich together. He is quite the philanthropist after all. 
>
>Bullish. 

Soros made his fortune shorting currencies then directly or indirectly causing them to collapse in value. If I was to derive any sentiment from this news, it would be bearish. 
Can we not downvote honest quesitons?

Not like he's telling people to trade on his bad charting, he's asking for input.... jeez.
you should first learn to draw such patterns. you went directly through the candles with your lines.
nope.
Until we break 7100 convincingly, I'm still expecting another dive into the low 6000's.
my general understanding is that it has never really slow climbed like this out of a massive correction/bear market. it will pump parabolically 
he's rationalizing his exit. he got spooked and couldn't take it any more. if he actually knew what he was doing he would have excited much earlier 
How much of the market is driven by US retail investors is the real question, and IMO it's way less than people on Reddit think, so I think the whole tax season/tax refund thing is a bit of a red herring. Minor significance at best.
Most people I know have been seling since Nov/Dec and exited a long time ago
All these resistances? Which ones besides 7k?
How did you do with your short yesterday? I closed half near break even and let the rest get stopped @7100 (between sleep and being offline didnt have time to manage it)

The thing about live trading is that there'd be hours and hours of just sitting around, with nothing happening. Although, I would enjoy a Youtube channel that did trading and analysis. Maybe a livestream every once in a while... 
There is [whalepool teamspeak](https://whalepool.io/connect/teamspeak) that has a [live stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj4C82mPOpc). A lot of the talk is just off-topic though so not for everyone.

I understand that you are looking for some high-quality analysis but that would probably be a short daily update only (plenty of youtube channels around - not sure which/if any is good.)
"I think it's a bit delusional to consider $6950 as a bullish price point."

What do you expect?  For us to gain 5% every day?  

Saying "I think it's a bit delusional to consider $6950 as a bullish price point" is pretty pointless as one day a 5% gain will likely be the start of the market turning bullish...point being you can never know 
It's ish, *ish* goddamnit. It can mean "not completely convinced the price is going a lot lower soon".

"I'm going full bulltard!" is what you're accusing people of. Not sure THAT'S happening.
It is testing the resistance established at the base of the bart during April 3-4.
with all these bearish momentum we had and slow and steady turn is not unlikly. 
Looking at the same, also this move was probably the midday funding pump. Short from 7090 and stops at 7230 or so
I also see some bearish divergences, even on daily forming, but overall trend at this moment is short-term bullish. Gonna wait for some short signals
I would start entring a short if 7150 hits and bail on my short at 7400
Upvoting before you get downvoted by bulls.

Edit - (Waves at bulls)
The same spoofy is regularly appearing on both sides. no one knows what the hell is going on. Washtrading i suppose. Bc there are 500 BTC market buys into spoofys sells and vice -versa.
I really like your analysis ! Very detailled and wise.
on what time frame is it oversold?
This is why no one cares about the order books.
Please keep us updated in real time
[How about a 7K wall as seen earlier today](https://imageshack.com/a/img924/9999/bkYoyZ.jpg)?

I wonder what purpose does it serve. From what I understand, the whale is trying to trigger the traders to buy.
Bitfinex traders will instantly downvote you, but it's a damn good question. I wouldn't trust them with a dollar, let alone those kinds of amounts.

This isn't "FUD" mind you, but common sense. It was, is, and likely will continue to be *incredibly* risky to trust them with any non-trivial amounts of BTC or USD.
I trust them with less than 10% of my stash. And even that I consider a huge risk.

Which is a shame since I could be doing decent money on lending, but NOPE
They drive volume. And the hack was long ago. 
10k could short a million bucks at 7350

What’s your point?
lol 1 million is nothing on bitmex
Guess we should all just stop trading then.
In english please?
somebody bought 300 of his btc and he added another 2000 to the wall LOL
now 6700
Quick question: why did you absolutely cut those candles in half? 
You mean dark pools?
Zoom out. All we're doing is consolidating after a big move (like we have every time before on our trek down from 11k). Not really an indication that we are going up or down, but the macro trend favors bearish positions. Best to hold a neutral position until the trend resumes or is broken (unless you like gambling with a 10-6 hand).
from what I understand, several G20 nations have started releasing tax guidance on cryptocurrencies which do not look good (specifically around CGT being due upon a crypto to crypto trading event)

also, on the countries that I do have bank accounts in, crypto purchasing is becoming harder as fiat onramps get shut down

no new money coming in, but continuous inflation means that the prices have to drop.

finally, I heard a rumor that the chinese miners are trying to suppress the price to shake out the higher cost miners so that they can corner the market. rumor stated that their target price is 3k (their break even price is 3.9k)
because fundamental adoption is not happening. no new money coming in, app installs, wallet sign-ups, transactions, Google trend is all on multi year lows 
Half life 3 is released and mining comes to a halt as everyone uses their graphics cards for their intended purpose.

Plebs stop buying bitcoin. Oh wait...
There was a market buy for 219 coins into it, and many above 50.
This is all manipulation to add volume and trigger and upward rally by the exchange since the trading has come almost to a standstill.

Good whale.
Volume is terrible 
Remindme! wouldn't mean shit.  If it goes to 8370 or not, you are still wrong if you are sure it's going there.
or ? https://www.tradingview.com/x/yPJ25Q8X
I hope you’re right. That’ll break it out of the downtrend line from ATH, right?
RemindMe! 7 days
Holy shit. You wizard. You got it right. 
just not worth it. you should refrain from trading if this is your plan tbh. there is no free money, you will make 10% off scalps and then lose it all in one big move when you think it's going to keep chopping around
The price goes up even more when shorts close
The core problem is liquidity and depth or order books in exchanges. Especially the last 2 months.

Went the price is pumping people are building up the depth of the order books, ie. more coins at each price level.

This means that the whales can either buy or sell _more_ at that given price point.
Without confirming or denying this theory, the idea would be that the “whales” could get a better sell point for their long or better entry for their short.
Market efficiency and minimize free-renters (parasites) effect. 

In layman's terms: they can close their longs selling into short squeezes
you can try disabling animations
Sometimes logging in and out helps when things feel a bit off.
It sluggish all the time for me and can't get orders through 75% of the time.
There are bots but they introduced API limits linked to volume, so unless you're doing the volume constantly your bot ends up throttled and dead. So they probably lost a few market makers by leaving them hanging on the API capacity.

This rant goes some way to explaining the situation, even if a bit hyperbolic:

/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/7x1l20/market_maker_being_treated_unprofessionally_on/

Bitmex actually provide a sample bot, one of their directors has "market maker bots" as his tag-line. So guess they provided all this stuff, then got big, site slowed down, blocked the bots.

https://github.com/BitMEX/sample-market-maker
I think he's saying that a breakout of this would *confirm* the double bottom.  Meaning that we will have bounced away from our second visit to 6k rather than going through it.

Just visiting 6k a second time itself isn't the double bottom.  It needs to break away and then people can start setting targets based on that.


As I understand it: This falling wedge in combination with a possible double bottom could bring us a reversal. This short-term bullish trend could also escalate into a mid-term bullish trend.

My two cents: I don't believe in the reversal just yet. There is no volume to justify a double bottom. We need volume now or go further down into 6k region in the hopes of some comparable volume to last time we checked out 6k. This would also be inline with his graph.
That is an agressive bet. Goodluck good sir!
Can you explain you're reasoning or source on "new money entering the market"? Predictive trading is pretty risky, why not wait and trade with the market rather than trying to crystal ball it?
Chances are very low it would go up to your higher targets in one shot without significant pullbacks; don't be afraid to take profit.
> New money entering the market

Did you lose all your money in your previous trades?
Sub 6k daily close within 72hours
The end of the bear market will come when we break through the resistance from ATH running down... Don't have a chart handy so can't remember where the line is now price wise. 

Otherwise everything else won't matter too much.

 Learn lessons people, we've been here before... Many many times. The bear market will only end when we are above that resistance line, we hold it and then away from it.

People are still way too early here to believe this is over. 
The bear market can't just be 'over'. It has to go through all of its natural stages, this takes a long time. 

-Hundreds of thousands to millions of coins need to turnover.

-Actual use has to occur

-Everyone that got burnt has to either sell out or accept their losses and not try to get out on a pump, that means you have to give people a chance to get back out at 18k and they turn it down

-A new ATH has to be in play, otherwise the value must fall to its floor, the level supported by use alone

 -The current limit of dumb money was 20k, there has to be a newer even larger source of suckers that will pay you off. Coinbase was the #1 app, where do you go from there? People will buy at 20 only if they expect someone else to pay 40. 


Number of shorts open/lines/news can't alter this cycle. There will be bounces all the way down for the same reason it blew up to 20, and the result will be the same.
I appreciate the sentiment but IMO no one can call that until we have sustained moves upwards for weeks.  We have been in a bear market since the blow-off top ATH.  
I fully agree. I still cant believe we have Ethereum under $400. Now is definitely when you should be buying.
So what are you doing?

Long? Short?

I’m not going long until we are back above 8500 for a while and not shorting unless we go below 6k
This guy charts.
uh what
Same here, tradingview isn't updating.
Strangely the tradingview-powered chart on their own site is working.
What makes you decide to cut off random candles or wicks in lines (and not others)?
Why must everything be a vast conspiracy. The volume is so low making this market do your bidding doesn't require some complex PSYOP. 
Fair assessment. All anyone has to do is zoom out to see that we're in a declining bearish trend. The key is to accumulate the smaller bounces on the way down with reasonably tight stops for when we truly reach the bottom. 
India and pakistan banned crypto. There has not been any bullish news. Unless you mean a prolific shorter (soros) announcing he may short bitcoin .
We broke the wedge and now we're just kind of standing there doing nothing. I think that's pretty bearish and the breakout should have been more violent. 

This could very well breakdown here but stick to whatever plan you got. 
Gemini apparently also increased their fees 400%. Gemini and gdax are pretty greedy after record profits last year. 
What are the fees going up to?
I don't put much creedence in the time of year thing but it does feel like this has enough legs to get to 7800, one of the longest and strongest log resistances. There's at least one bitfinex whale who is showing confidence that we have a ways to go. It also tells me that 6400/6500 is a powerful support line given how well it was defended and how well we're coming off it. I'm not convinced it's the bottom, though. Personally I think 7800 is the ceiling of this mini run. I think what we're seeing right now is accumulation of long term hodl stacks but I don't see FOMO coming back just yet, too many people are too recently burned.

And this may be getting ahead of things but long term I expect the long term log support (held at 6500) to form a massive descending triangle with one of two log resistances. If those resistances are broken beforehand then I will have to be much more bullish.

we had the same shit a week or two ago, still dumped
[deleted]
Turning bullish? 
to me looks like sellers tired of dumping at sub 7k and needed some push from their friends/soros/media to get higher exit price.


I just have a bad feeling about Soros. I suppose if it leads to a new megabull run then everybody would just be happy and not probe much further but idk
Are Wall Street junkies getting a bonus this year!? ;)
I just got it cuz I thought it was magic internet money and I like wizards. 
Well, think about it as "theme weeks". Last week's theme was "my brothers wife learned to short and therefore shorters are overextended and BTC will rise". This weeks theme is "Soros and XX are going to invest in crypto any second now". 

The theme usually develops during the week and culminates on the weekend (a weekend theme party??).

See also: tax returns, chinese new year.
Holders and people will long positions are scared and desperate.  So they are grabbing ahold of the Soros "news" and fantasizing that he is going to pour all his fortune into BTC and save them.
Think you're right my love, we're heading to slightly above 8000 imo.

It could be Soros or something lmao.



Okay I don't actually believe that (Soros is probably gonna try and short this into the ground) but yeah I've had the feeling that there's accumulation going on for weeks now.
Well if you want to know if it's one or few people...

Can I see your chart mate? Want to see where and how you place that wedge
agreed.. 36h rise now, and what have we actually accomplished? 400-500$ rise with price drooping after every big push. its soon time for dropping again and we have made yet another lower high.
[deleted]
Lol
LOL
seems legit i'm sold > >
Isn’t wave 3 supposed to be the largest otherwise invalidated?
On that scale I see it as 1 bull flag break up and 2 bull flag break downs. 

On the 4 or 6 hour scale I seee it as a single bull flag that's still too early to call either way. 
Well, that trendline remains strong in that regard. Maybe this is really the bottom.

Although i would not trace it so steep. 
Let's not do this kind of thing.
I can only dream of pulling off the same kind of stunt one day, but in the meantime I'm taking notes and also unloading part of my stack at these levels. I'll continue to rebalance based on signs of strength/weakness as we go along. All in all this has been brilliantly executed, the market was thoroughly tested at multiple levels and our friendly whale has been playing the sentiment perfectly.
who is he?
[deleted]
It's almost as if its an unregulated market.

Or better yet, once the money leaves fiat it can never be regulated.
Short getting crushed so it’s obviously manipulation? *yawn* if you are that worried about manipulation then leave the market or just buy and hold. Sure manipulation happens, as it does in every market but this sub gets hilarious with excuses when the price goes against their trade. 
You mean the 6k BTC sell wall? some big whales here..
Manipulation is word that has lost all meaning here. 
Mr whale playing mind games with small fish
Casual 49 mil
strange that it's always manipulation when price goes down, but not when up...
Nah this subreddit now only considers buy walls and increases to be manipulation. Sell walls and decreases are as natural as it gets.
How about the pumps/spikes up in price we saw over the last few days, and the buy walls keeping it up?  Now it is just the bears turn to play :)
What's wrong with someone wanting to sell 7000 btc?
Cross up or down?
seems it tried to break down but met with lots if buying again
Dunno if it merits its own post as it's pretty simple.  Make profits, pay tax.  Yes, I was one of thousands, if not tens or hundreds of thousands of people who had to pay tax on profits from selling on the run up and now can look forward to a potential audit down the line.  If there were no taxes, I would have plowed money back into crypto, but alas, taxes must be paid.  

I don't think this drove the bear market, as it was just one more factor on top of many.  Bear market pullback was normal after the irrational exhuberance of the bull run.  The tide will eventually turn back to bull, but no one knows when. 
It might be impactful, but I guess many outside of the U.S. would wonder by how much unless there are other countries with similar tax schedules?
As much as I love to disagree with you I genuinely think you're right. 

I'm finding it absolutely hilarious actually how this sub, seems to, in the space of an hour, go from full hardcore bull to bear again. Bitcoin goes up $100? CLEARLY THE BEAR MARKET IS OVER! Bitcoin drops $100? BITCOIN IS FINISHED.

I've come to the conclusion that the best way to trade is to do the exact opposite of what people here are suggesting.
30 min chart? Come on now...lol
People need to stop obsessing about walls and focus on actual market buys and sells.
Welcome to the hodl club. Be sure to accumulate on an offline machine.

Your question interested me so I looked and yes, it was in November to mid December 2017. Just that all of it was green. (Binance, based on daily volume).
[removed]
I don't think insulting other traders is a good long term strategy.
whats the funny part? Worked  well the last 3 months, at most you are wrong by one move upwards 
'Price is not going below 7k' is a big call when it's just $50 above (<1%)
maybe take a look at RSI on timeframes up to 2h, or look how many Half Bart patterns did not continue after the left side of the head
Thats not a head and shoulders. Thats a bull flag breaking down.

Besides, h&s formations are only worth after formed.
no

Uhhh maybe, but I'm actually looking at the big Adam and Eve double bottom on the daily. I'm pretty sure it'll fail, but it's a little bit of much-needed hopium.
Lets see, swings were:
6520, 6870, 6490
Looks like a double bottom to me.
Not to detract from your statement too much but you're comment is full of your August- December baseless prediction.

At least draw some lines on the chart to back you up
6900? you’re whining about 50 bucks per coin?

Close your short if a 1% move makes you uneasy. or just trade 100x

Are you talking about the gap? Looks like some data is missing, almost two hours' worth. If you look at the 5m on Cryptowatch/BitcoinWisdom, it's fine.
I saw the same on Bitfinex. I don’t know how to explain this, but either the exchange itself is having problems or some arbitration bots are going haywire...

There were moments in the past few hours when the arbitration between Bitfinex and Kraken was over $80.

Kind of, yes. He discusses how price reflexively determines value.
I've seen this happen in alts on binance a lot. Huge 100+ BTC sell wall gets eaten and price proceeds to dip shortly after. 
Last year before the bull market got wild, this was what happened. It was as if bots didn't want to allow any "roofs". But once those coins were out, they wouln't keep pushing the price. Organic buying took care of that.

Thanks, first year of uni so trying to get into the habit lol.

I wish I could take credit for the Overstock catch, I must've read or heard about it somewhere and remembered (might have been DataDash).

The way I'm perceiving the "ill gotten gains" statement is that as long as there is dictators, criminals or anyone that wants to use money outside the banking system will be pushed to crypto, mainly XMR, LUX or some other privacy coin. Bullish imo.

As for what you said about Overstock, completely agree.

Organic? With one or two rich fucking whales sitting at 7K suppressing the price for millions of others? It’s manipulative fucking bullshit. 
I believe they are put in place by bulls themselves in order to make volume and pump the price.

I even think its finex itself, it costs nothing for them since they pay no fees, and they can use our coins.

Good ol' fraud. At leas this time it goes our way.
Shorts underwater?
Good points and I agree, but for the record GDAX actually hurt themselves fee-wise; while they bumped up from 0.25% to 0.3% for the lowest tier, the higher tiers actually got pretty serious discounts. Given that (for all exchanges) the majority of their fee revenue comes from the higher tiers, they are actually probably making even less now than they would have otherwise.
Ouch. This is potential death spiral material. Doesn’t help the lack of demand. 

And before you all flame me, I mean fuel for current bear market, not “this means BTC is ded”

no its just the bottom before a temporary reversal.  Showing the real bottom would make it way longer.
Do you have an alert when someone mentions 2014? :p
correct
no i already closed photoshop and besides I don't think its useful to look at it that way.  I started them both at a month before the peak which is when they started to go parabolic.  The 2014 bubble was just proportionally a bigger jump.
No testing is healthy for the market to decide where to go next. The Bart pattern has also died down the last few days or so, showing that people do not fall for those pumps and dumps as much anymore
BTC/USDT volume on the U.S. based altcoin exchanges (Bittrex, Poloniex) is under 2000.
it's climbing though 
I'm referring to RSI divergence here. 

For the 12h hidden divergence, we have RSI making higher highs while price makes lower highs. This would be invalidated if the market breaks $7,500. 

The divergence on shorter timeframes is a result of RSI making lower highs while price makes higher highs on those timeframes. 

Divergences are essentially just conflicts between momentum indicators and price. When they are out of sync, it's often a signal that the short term trend is losing steam and a reversal is looming. 
bearish divergence:

price sets higher highs, rsi lower highs. example:

price $7000, rsi 75, later on price $7200, rsi 65.

hidden bearish divergence:

price sets lower highs, rsi sets higher highs. example:

price $6900, rsi 30, later on price $6700, rsi 40
[11.7k](https://www.tradingview.com/x/kwbgAqHn/) + [9.05] (https://www.tradingview.com/x/ufbclTs5/) actually puts the monthlong downtrend slightly [ lower than what I had](https://www.tradingview.com/x/c9CbRtsk/). How do you draw it?

(and I didn't say it signals the end of the trend... just that we would be breaking through it)
they had a dev meeting 2 days ago where they agreed to limit the ETH supply in the next implementations. They want to reduce the block reward and include POS in every 60th block to test the implications from that.
It's 5k and I think they've been just more patient in bringing up the price with then the previous bart formations.

Ah yeah that's what I meant
A market can move a lot higher up then it can go down, the best you can make on a short is 100% and thats if something goes to $0, upside potential profit is higher imo seeing as btc has already fallen about 70% now, typical bubble crashes around 60 to 80%. 
Not if he has a massive stake in Overstock as well.  See the post above by tree. 
Pretty sure that's sarcasm by DushmanKush.

Downvoted for the truth. Man.....
This sub is amazing : each genuine question are downvoted. It's a shame.
thanks :-)

the downvoting has gone to shit lately
that's why I'm asking.... 

if you cut wicks on the 1d, you'd cut candles on the 1h 2h and 4h. If you cut wicks on the 1h, you'd cut candles on the 15m, 30m. 
that is also what I read from the godmode trader analyst. if we transform 7.1k into support it is not unlikly that we found the bottom. so some sideways in the 7.1\-7.3k would be not bad for bulls. 
I am emotionally drained from all this movement... and all of my holdings is many multiples of pure profit. I don't even know how people not in my position are even keeping themselves together.
This could be a large Adam and eve double bottom happening on the daily chart. 
are you still in your short from 11.x?
It's a lot more than solely US retail folks that have spring time tax deadlines.

$25B in aggregate tax burdeon is not a minor significance.
Your MO has become to call every temporary stall in the dumping the bottom, post some super bullish comment, then act like you were just joking when it’s wrong, and talk about how your smarter/richer friends foresaw it all.
Horizontal resistance at 7k to 7.1 and a downtrend resistance from our drop from 8.5. Neither one is causing a breakout but neither one is being straight up rejected either so it looks promising. As I've said many times, the end of the bear market where we bottom out is when we go through all of the resistances without anything really happening up or down.
which of them ? I shorted 6850 or something and got stopped out on the move to 7k  at 6900, then reshorted 7060 and closed at 6960 something. Today was a strange day.  

any new position opened by you ?
> point being you can never know

so why be bullish...
I mean I'm expecting a higher high.  The best shot we had at a reversal was our runs to 11.2k and 9.8k.

We're sitting at 6.9k with anemic volume and there are people asking why they should be bearish and how Soros and Rockefeller are huge pieces of bullish news for the market.

Yes, eventually the market will turn but things haven't looked great for Bitcoin for a while.
Yeah, didn't exactly bounce very hard off of that support with much gusto. 

Also, when breaking out of a wedge you would expect a stronger move up and a retest of the wedge line later on, no? Not immediately falling back into the wedge to test previous resistance prior to breakout.
Yeah we could easily pump another 100 from here, wouldn't be surprised but not closing a position is identical to opening a position here and i rather not open a long at 7.1.
I'm seeing it on the sell side on BitFinex more often. 32 million sell spoof.
Thanks, I hope it could be helpful :)

Lol yeah. I had the same exact strategy. About 10%. Sure enough i lost it in the hack. It sucked, but not as much as if I had used it as my wallet. 
I would never put such a huge amount into an exchange that
1) was hacked
2) did a 30% haircut
3) never explained how the hack happened (details)
4) is registered in an unknown jurisdiction and is generally hard to get a hold of

but that's me.
I should've followed /u/SloppySynapses short at $10.8k but I was just cheerleading it.
Basically these “bart” patterns you are seeing are the result of low liquidity (far less participants in the market). Whales (people with a LOT of fiat/BTC) can intentionally move the market by making big buys or sells. There’s also a lot of stop hunting going on. Stop hunting is basically moving the price up or down where a whale thinks a lot of people have set their stop losses, forcing people to get liquidated, hence a further “pop” in price. TL;DR: Non-organic market movement.

What he’s saying (correct me if I’m wrong OP) is that one individual made an informed decision that the price will probably drop soon, and took a large “short” position against that because they can just zoom out and see that the overall direction of this market is still CLEARLY going down and these short lived spikes are just whale games.

EDIT: Downvoters (permabulls) gonna get rekt
and gone without any volume
If you mean the last three green candles, I actually did not. That purple support was drawn this morning. They cut the line, not the other way around. Fortunately it bounced off the other older resistance.
Zoom even out further. That's when you become a perma bull
Depends...is the 10-6 suited or unsuited, and what's my position?
Clarifying taxation and regulation on crypto is a good thing unless they outlaw it.  There's very little outlawing going on, most of the news is good (exception: India National Bank recently).  Chinese miner "rumors"?  Last I heard, China was forcing its miners to an "orderly exit" from the business.  I doubt they're plotting to depress the price as they relocate to other countries (if they do). 
> multi year lows

Google trends was lower for the majority of 2017.  Basically the entire year up until October.  You're making things up.
Installs, sign-ups, transactions and Google trends are more lagging rather than leading indicators. Agreed tho on adoption and especially no new money. More balanced for me personally as to where prices finally does break out.

Fair enough, but tight stops are involved obviously, there's a good chance I'll make profit and a decentish chance I'll get stopped out from a sudden Dildo out of nowhere, but right now when we're barting sideways and all it's actually not a bad idea to open a Long near the bottom of the mini channel or a short at the Top with higher leverage. Very very tight stops involved as well 
wil try, thx
i see, yes that could be a probable answer that they get hit too much by bots when the big volume appeared in february

Targets 2 and 3 are greedy, but I'm looking at them.

There seems to be a misunderstanding.

"New money entering the market" is either:

A-Outside fiat entering the crypto market for the first time, regardless of the investor's history.

or

B-New investors who have never invested in crypto putting in fiat for the first time.

I'm more loosely defined and go with A. You might prefer B's narrower scope.

Since I'm injecting outside fiat that I didn't get from a previous crypto sale, I consider it "new". I clarified my original post.
? No. This is simply new money that came from wagecuck pleb life. 
ah, the usual Dushman bearish comment with very precise price movement prediction.
Any specific reason/TA?  6500 held strong a few times, and now 7k is being difficult for bears to break (and keep it under). 
We need not only break through that resistance, we need to break through and stay above it, preferably make a strong bounce upwards off of it. 
If you can, post it later... I'd be interested in seeing it...
I'm not sure $19XXX was the top because "dumb money" refused to buy at higher prices?

Pretty sure it was because a whole bunch of people who were crazy crazy numbers in profit thought "this cannot last, I'm taking my $100K+ while I still can!"

Then everyone else went "shit the crash is on!"

Sure, NOW "dumb money" is like, fuck this I'm not touching it.
this is satire, right?

[deleted]
Because it confirms my bias! 
More seriously I think some trends can be broken temporarily and then retested afterwards, such as the two resistance line going down from 11.7k (one is more valid than the other though I agree) . I know some people are pretty conservative about cutting wicks but I think in Bitcoin the volatility and price manipulation is so high that forming perfect trends is nearly impossible. Although I'm still learning how to do this and I would be glad to be rationally challenged.
People like Soros and Novogratz absolutely know that what they say affects the markets. Hence many people here bullish about Soros buying up all their crypto lol. You don't need tinfoil on your head to acknowledge that influential people will attempt to influence the market if they can.
another reason to short the tops on bitmexico, this is implied long term holding collection, since you only get BTC back
India has not banned crypto. https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8agm01/no_crypto_ban_in_india_clarity_given_by_rbi/
I gotta agree. A whale could probably push it over for a bit, but this has been a real slog with tons of manipulated support keeping it up.
Not broken for me, how do you draw it?

There is correlation but no causation. Its positive if he gives up.
I don't think he's actually selling 5k btc. At least not yet
not really, if anything this upward slow climb is bearish. if it rockets past $7.5k I'll shut up but a slow climb is not a good thing imo

I was just explaining since so may people are confused by it 
Honestly, I have a hard time believing any mega-billionaire would announce his entry into a market before taking a position. 
> I just got it cuz I thought it was magic internet money and I like wizards.

Dude, why bother, your grandson is just going to blow all your gains on a Stately Pleasure Dome, with Caves of Ice.

Can't fault him for the damsel with a dulcimer though. Damsels are hot.

Many of the devs/engineers involved in crypto are wizards -> yielding networked power at scale & quietly playing with, not within, societal boundaries.

Ah, institutional money theme is back, and it's had a make over.
exactly this, it's like they want every news to be good news
Yep, great tool! Now turn it off, you're airing me out.
You're laughing at something you don't even understand, lol. 
Are you suggesting that there are multiple people posting 1000 coin sell walls on Bitfinex? That would be something.
Probably trying to say Soros

Don't you need new investors for growth?

Good question. I did some more reading and I found this text below from http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:market_analysis:elliott_wave_theory

Based on that source, the waves I draw meet the three criterias.

>Believe it or not, there are only three rules when it comes to interpreting Elliott Wave. There are many guidelines, but only three HARD rules. These are unbreakable. Guidelines, on the other hand, are bendable and subject to interpretation. Furthermore, these rules only apply to a 5-wave impulse sequence. Correction, which are much more complicated, are given more leeway when it comes to interpretation.
>
>Rule 1: Wave 2 cannot retrace more than 100% of Wave 1.
>
>Rule 2: Wave 3 can never be the shortest of the three impulse waves.
>
>Rule 3: Wave 4 can never overlap Wave 1.
Fully out for the first time since $6.6k (did some scalps in between but kept most of my stack in BTC on the way up). Feels a little uncomfortable to be honest, but this looks like a good level to close and all in all a good exercise in patience for me (most of my trades used to be super short term). Trying to learn from my last big mistake of riding a very profitable long back all the way down into a loss.

Of course, knowing BTC it'll punish me for learning from my mistakes by doing the opposite and making me FOMO back in at $7.1k+....
The whale on Bitfinex that's been screwing with everybody all day by placing multiple 1,000 BTC bids and asks, pulling some, and letting others get filled. The market's been in a frenzy about it. He's not active at the moment, but he'll probably pop up again soon enough. If you scroll down there's screenshots and discussion.
I doubt there's actual money on Bitfinex.
What is manipulation anyway ? They're just buying, selling and placing orders in a free unregulated market that nobody forces you to enter.
It’s the name of the game now. Ride with the whales or get rekt
yeap.. someone playing! someone wants to buy cheap! this is bullish for me.
When it goes down it's manipulation.

When it goes up it's mynipsarechaffin (because they get rock hard).
nobody ever sells around 49000000$ in a iliquid market in a sell wall. Because, as you should know, supply and demand, by announcing such a huge increase on supply, nobody will buy and sellers will have to beat him. Then he will buy from those sellers and remove the wall. Spoofing. 

If you wanted to sell that amount of bitcoin in a exchange, what you usually do is to set and order such as that it market sellls to any offer above a price. Usually limiting the amount sold per time because you don't want to artificially suppress price. 

But usually you just sell OTC. Thats a huge amount of money after all .

    
They were not random. Usually mirrored the dumps that happened before. Its all stop loss hunting man. 
You could tell they really wanted to sell because they set it a good bit over the market price and pulled it when the price moved toward it.  /s
Which has been the case ever since the last drop on the 6th. 
??? 30m is not silly to chart on...not the best but it's better than the 15m which lots of people here use...
I for real got laid once almost entirely because of a fortune cookie. I took this girl to some lame Chinese buffet because she liked it. Her fortunate cookie said something along the lines of there being romantic opportunities tonight. She was basically a superstitious idiot and this exact moment radically changed the trajectory of the evening. I only saw her a couple more times after that because she sucked, but good looking out Confucious! 
I'm guessing and hoping they were joking

Don't take it literally, what I mean is the range 6900-7050.
I don't  really know what RSI is. lol. Yeah last few barts are headed downwards, but eventually the rose up, so is people's trust and belief.

I am noticing this change in behavior and have a very strong feeling about this.
Thanks for the input 
Relax. Who's whining? You're jumping the gun with your judgements. I'm just mildly disappointed that I closed a good day with a poorly-timed trade and let a good chunk of my position go at what turned out to be the bottom.

Jeez, tough crowd.

It's a Daily thread; people post about their positions and how their trades went all the time. Unlike some of the posters here, I don't come here to gloat or only post winning trades. This was one of my best days (scalping-wise) in months, but it's not like I crush it on every trade (or pretend to). Hell, I was on here posting about how I got chopped out and locked in losses for a couple of days in a row a few days ago. It's just funny that I had to end it on a sour note, is all. Now I'm more out of position than I want to be, and I don't want to re-buy at this level, and slippage is killer if I don't time things right.

Also, I never short, and never have. I'm either long to various extents, or out of the market. And I don't trade on margin, either. 100X is a ridiculous suggestion.

You know people trade on different time frames, right? From two minute scalps to ten year long-term holds. Don't sneer at others' trading styles, it's unbecoming.

I should add that Kraken seemed to favour the lower end of that arbitration.

It's my goal to avoid banning people as much as possible. I'll be very open to unbanning people, too.

I'm not sure I always identify as a bull. I'm really bad at hitting my short entries, though.
Completely missing the point. You're argumentative in the face of reason, as is obvious throughout the rest of that thread, and completely devoid of basic knowledge required to moderate a bitcoin markets sub.
I guess so. I don't know why though, why not make all the money you can, it's not like they were losing any money based on the previous pay structure for smaller investors.

I can't imagine it's worth it for the bad word-of-mouth alone.
the small players either A) aren't trading, and thus don't take hits from the fees, or B) are on Binance trading shitcoins instead of BTC and ETH.
Aw, bummer. I didn't even know they excluded any states. 
what about Kraken? they are actually quite good those days
Punishing their enemies in order to get them to stop?

Its a trap!!!
All of it is just assertions. Market price discovery is a chaotic motion, no single party controls it. I don't doubt that there are some exchanges that trade against their customers, but that cannot drive the overall price movement long term.
Sure, fair play for putting some effort in your post nonetheless.
well done. Very well done
yo good shit with the links and citations! keep up the work
Based on their posts, did they make it?

Criticizing LN and blockstream's development choices, so what? Is your antifragile decentralized world changing cryptocurrency so pathetic that it needs saving from Jack and the Twitter team? 


If he bought and held, he would have made more. 
I'm happy for him. 
Maker orders only generate volume when there's volatility. Currently its about as low as its ever been. And at 30bps their taker is the highest in any exchange that I can think of. 

They've effectively dropped off our radar - there's always a better exchange to do the trade. And we're not the only ones. 
Alright yup, I thought you were saying the real bottom. Yeah that's a ways away.
haha no I just read almost every comment in the daily and tend to respond to comparisons to 2014 
Ok, but then your call that we're nearing the bottom is based on what, exactly? If the two don't look like one another so far, why will they in the future?
testing is healthy when you do it once, twice, thrice. But one of those may broken and then we would fall at least to 6k and that being conservative.
it is climbing, but avg price since mid March has been in the current range.
THanks for the clarification! Based on the divergence analysis, is it possible that price action will turn bearish in the shorter & 12h timeframes?
THanks. I am able to see bearish divergence on the hourly chart. There's probably some more room for this trend to continue.

Agree. I guess the "walls'" purpose is just to cool off the sharp and low volume upward movement for a while, so we have more stable and "healthy" growth. 
Retail investors are watching John Oliver, Billions, Silicon Valley, or something like that. You sir, Mr Zombie Turkey, are an invested chart watcher.

But yes... It's a poop show. 
why would that be funny? That's probably what will happen. Big organizations with deep pockets can control the regulations with lobbyists, why would they enter an unregulated arena?
They print tether and can manipulate on both directions either buying up or lending and shorting.
I’m only up $300
Looks like you were right.
Nice bot.
give it a few more hours until the next one.
Honestly I get a sense it's the start of a big red one 
lol!!!!
I really doubt big players will accumulate BTC on 7k. BTC can go higher now but we are still due to one more leg down.
The best ROI is not 100% on a short if profit is measured in BTC terms (which it usually is when going short).  

I short 1 BTC at 1x leverage for $100. 

I close my short at $0.01. I now have 10000 BTC.

Shorting is the best way to make more of whatever asset youre betting against. It's better than longing for sure. 
It's not about obvious here. It is well known that Soros has a great ability to find overvalued assets / currencies. When it becomes clear that he considers Bitcoin to be overvalued and is betting on that with his own money nobody will want to get into his way. 
Are you being sarcastic?
Well, you basically ignored 2 entire candles one of which is sitting entirely outside of your trendline.
Who is this godmode trader analyst you speak of?
if it's above $6k I generally wouldn't worry about anything 
Ya I'll start thinking that's a strong possibly above $9-10k

i probably should have closed below $7k tho 

still think I'll get a chance to 
yes will exit above $7800

$7500 will have me wondering

$7200-7300 will get me watching the charts closely again

It broke out of the wedge but didn't break through the horizontal resistance at 7-7.1k in the first place. If it break above it, 7500 is on the table.

Long-term bullish and perma-bull are entirely different things. I would imagine the vast majority of this sub is longterm bullish, and the most successful bunch are those not married to a position short-term.

tight stops means you will lose get stopped out very quickly even if it doesn't end up going that way. and due to slippage you will possibly end up losing even more. I'd just not try to scalp this, it's not worth it. most of the volatility/scalp traders here lose money, they just don't post about it.

every time you see someone post a successful scalp there's like 8 other people who just lost a bunch of unnecessary money
People were starting to complain about the UI freezing. 

There was that thing where whenever overloaded the buy/sell buttons would disable briefly (flashing on and off, unusable), so you'd have to get an instant when the button was enabled, rather than being able to spam it and have the order execute when it can.

So they did some UX changes around that and throttled APIs at the same time.
I think it qualifies as close enough at this point, particularly if the followup features of the double bottom show up.  If other stuff doesn't confirm it, then the "close enough" get's rescinded and double bottom invalidated.
What if they want to drive it into the bottom of the sea to get more coins and more control, before they pump it? Or just stop hunting up and down, upping the manipulation game? I don't think anyone would piss against the wind, they can make money either way, short or long. So it's not necessarily bullish news IMHO.
Ah I see, I thought you meant on the market as a whole would see an outstanding amount of new money entering. I don't entirely understand why you would mention that though, the way it's written makes it seem as if it's your reason for going long rather than you simply dropping cash in.

upper red line
👌
Biased much?
it's just that when the price stops going down people assume it'll go up
A decently fair point. Personally I think that those need to be justified on a wick by wick or candle by candle basis to explain the rational explanation for ignoring that wick. For instance, directly after the 6.4k flash drop you could make an argument to draw the line using that as 6.5k since it seemed to just be a very temporary overshoot.

But on the whole doing so is dangerous because it can do exactly what you said - confirm a bias. TA is supposed to be a data driven method to assist looking at the market without emotion. It helps make rational decisions. 

The second you start making subjective calls it gets dicey and you could be (sub?)consciously finding things that confirm what you want to happen. For instance, that upward channel you have drawn currently that ignores wicks with the support and uses them with the resistance. If you include wicks on the support you instead have an ascending wedge that would be bearish.
I think they  (soros and karpeles) are both french with east europe origins(poland, bitfinex fud coincidence*)

Ps: bogdanofs also french/ east europe
Yes, it effectively has. Banks cannot deal with it. No exchanges. Sure, you can buy via cash if you find someone on local bitcoins, but your ability to buy / sell bitcoin has been severely handcuffed.
linear scale.
I think its a market maker buying his own walls, trying to create some fomo/liquidity so we can move up, if it works and people start buying - great. If not we dump. Had a shitton of those last year, they worked great back then...
> slow climb is bearish

My god. And when it is in parabolic mode everyone screams manipulation and non organic move. Make up your mind people.
Are you sure they announced it? All the articles I saw made it seem like someone found out. Can you link where they announced? 
Sounds kinda awesome and well worth it, cheers grandson!
This is the kind of nonsense we have to deal with around here...and we wonder why more professionals and whales don't bother posting. Hmm....
Please enlighten me with fact based evidence.
The composite man XD
I've "matched" existing walls myself at times to screw with people and/or the wall placer, but at the four-figure BTC level? It's one person/entity, maybe a couple working together at best.
I'm a huge fan of Wyckoff's "composite operator" way of thinking about the markets. It applies in general to aggregate supply/demand of the market as a whole.

This isn't that.

This is one person, or at best a small group.
I was thinking maybe it was multiple man. 
New investors, or savagely over leveraged shorts and a couple whales. Either one.

Please note that i'd rather have more genuine growth, but the people who set out to liquidate all those positions won't give a fuck.
that helps, too. but having less people who borrowed money to buy bitcoin (in layman terms) its a positive. 
a DEGENERATE, degenerate gambler, that's what you are.

EDIT: Yes, I think that wedge is off.
or sideways!
thanks
oh ffs
That’s what pisses me off. If you want the government to hold your hand then go to the many regulated markets. These people are angry they lose money and want an outlet.
i bet someone shorted and wants to make sure to get it :D
I think some do buy and sell with big walls (although that one was pretty silly in size).... but if so they usually actually buy or sell some, don't just post and pull when price approaches.
Guess you’re not familiar with the bearwhale of 2014 and their 30k ask wall they left to be eaten away at for like 12hrs
I know what you mean, but this whole whale manipulation thing is getting on my nerves.

Even if it is so, who the hell cares? No point in complaining about it.

Call the FEDs if you really care.
so basically like 2 times... lol
Ok sorry, wasn't aware you were referring to a range. Btw, what's your certainty that it won't go below this range based upon? 
Fair play on closing your winning trade above, enjoy the spoils! But trading on 'feelings' isn't a long term strategy that will keep you winning I'm afraid
RSI shows the strength of an uptrend, and when it's "too high" or low,  this could show that the trend is at it's top and people start to take profit. With this bot driven market, I also assume a lot of them are trend following short/long and use this as a indicator
I was kidding too ;)

Don’t worry. It was all in good fun
Gotcha...just wanted to make sure people didn't think arb was responsible for a gap, or $50 movement.
Ah, that would make sense.

I bet this is Gemini's way to reduce traffic on their network / platform.  Rather than increase scalability, they are reducing traffic and cherry picking revenue from the larger players.
Because generally speaking, every person has the same cost to them (onboarding, AML/KYC, support, infrastructure, etc.) but some people pay $5 a month and others $50,000. They clearly want more of the latter and less of the former, or basically are charging the former a little more to make up for it.
Yep but few months ago they have so many problems. 
Thank you, this is actually the peak of my procrastination.

Was supposed to finish off 2000 words essay. Instead i ended up talking shit about bitcoin for 1000 words...
r/PersonalFinanceCanada is a cesspool of butthurt Canadian's who circlejerk about Electronic Transfer Funds/mutual funds, buying used cars, and living frugally. 

So chances are, no, they didn't make it.
Ya, exactly. Our standards are low lol
There are too many exchanges. A lot will disappear
Personally I think if bitcoin takes over the world it will be in spite of humanity, not because of it.
No I mean people like you.
I have no problem with criticism, indeed it’s healthy so is a fair competition. Blatant propaganda, confusing the newcomers and childish comparisons a la 95% of all r/btc is what I have a problem with. 

Also it’s not ‘my cryptocurrency’ lol. 
And the fact that it’s decentralized is the reason why BCH hasn’t been attacked with coordinated pumps and dumps like someone else we know ‘cough’. 

Anyway, a truly decentralized currency doesn’t need a Twitter account right? R/btc won’t have a meltdown over this then I guess.
> And at 30bps their taker is the highest in any exchange that I can think of.

Gemini said "hold my beer" and raised taker fees to a whopping 1% for the shrimp!
Haha, just messing with you.  
Hey Sloppy, you got any predictions which bubble we are most resembling? Are we using 2014 due to the maximum pain hypothesis and recency bias?

I think the last time(s) we died, they were shorter in bear market duration. 2012 ($13 > $8) was around 3.5 months, 2013 was 6.5 months ($198>$67), 2017 ($3000>$1911) was 2 months. 2014-16 was the Gox'ing and we all know what happened.

Still holding out hope that we can get a run of the mill 3-6 month bear market and boom, some catalyst hits later this year for a proper 2nd wind(ETF, Starbucks LN, Sidechain, MAST being used, etc). 
it's a temporary bottom, the bottom after that is way lower 
the bottom before the short term bounce.
or each try people buy even more, since they think that the risk reward of buying in 6k range and set stop loss below 5.8k is quite good
I'm sorry not mid march, but the last 10 days. I need my glasses.
The 12h hidden divergence is still too early too call. It's really just a potential hidden divergence at the moment. 

The 1h and 2h, however, are more well defined. 

Like all TA, it's never a sure thing. It's merely something to keep an eye on. 

If it does drop, it'll be a, "yup, that makes sense" scenario. If it doesn't, it'll be a, "well that's odd, but up we go anyway" scenario. 

Sort of like if there was a cold front moving in from the north, but you woke up to sunny skies and warm temperatures because an unexpected wind blew the cold front out west. 
Interesting. I'm guessing the difference comes from what time scale you and I entered the line. A 4-hour span contains 16 different points to start a 15-minute line.
Yep, that's what I'm seeing as well. Thanks!
They mentioned the number 60 in the meeting, maybe they changed it.
Not sure if joking or cerial.
Maybe funny is the wrong word. I just mean that I think the complete lack of regulation was what helped spurn the original bull run
https://imgur.com/a/WU6JN

Each vertical line represent a Tether printing, there is no correlation between Tether print and BTC pumping, in fact printing happen after or during a bullrun, when big player need liquidity to cash out, Finex print tether to respond at USD demand, not BTC demand
Close it before the greed takes over.
I duno I'm not expecting this to break 7k just yet. I don't know if it's one or multiple finex whales but they have been making some big buys right when I thought the levee was gonna break in the past day
If you're shorting BTC to $0.01 it's probably best to measure it in USD.
I'm measuring in terms of usd value.
And he was joking. 
Of course, but if you draw it longer time frame, those candles are wicks on the 1d. So you never cut wicks?
we can't seem to break 7100 right now - worried if we retrace back to ~6900 again we might not have the juice to make another attempt
I've never watched any account I've ever had fluctuate a couple hundred thousand in three months... granted, from a percentage point of view I have... but not in that much in value. It is stressful for me. I can't believe the balls of some people doing the same on margin... then get liquidated... then somehow pick themselves up again. Maybe I need testosterone supplements?! 
>Anyone who trades full time or works as part of a financial firm/fund deals with taxes quarterly and not on the standard yearly schedule most individuals do.

That's a statement of misplaced confidence. False.

I know many US, Canadians & Asians who invest/trade full time and pay solely in the spring. 

What % of crypto funds are taxed solely through dividend disbursements?

What % of crypto funds are have an offshore corporate entity? Many. And in such cases the sole form of tax is dividends, taxed as income, and paid in the spring.


hopium
I'm no accountant, but why would you actually pay taxes on trading gains quarterly when those gains could be wiped out by bad trades later in the year?  Obviously people should set the funds aside, but taxes are due on the overall gains for the year, thus they should actually be paid after the year closes.  
And a good chunk of them are buying back in lower, like you did, not exiting completely.  When you sell at 10k+ and the price is down to 6-8k, it's hard not to buy it on sale.  I'm no whale but I sold some on the way up and bought some back on the way down.  
I quoted him and asked him acccording to his statement, why be bullish if "point being you can never know". I'm not asking for reasons to be bullish lol. there's a ton of reasons for both, no one has any idea what's going to happen really
Yeah, thats basically what i'm saying. 

I'm not saying this can't still go up, but the fact that we haven't even broken 7,1 24h after a breakout out of a wedge makes this seem like a rather weak move.

EDIT: Well, there we go, i guess.
No biggie. I'm not 100% sure about the site being the issue, but it looks like your other comments are getting through.
Not really. Bitstamp and Kraken are great.
This is actually a really interesting point to think about. The Goldman Sachs backed Circle did just buy Poloniex...
FEels a bit strange that they are not more separated but yeah 
no man holders calling for the end of the bear market is usually a sign of the bottom. he's the first one to do it! 
Thanks for the nice argument. I've remade my chart based on your advice but have some remarks still:

My "ascending channel" is indeed more of a [risingwedge](https://www.tradingview.com/x/PddZ3Cjt/), good point, it actually reinforces my argument (end of the rising wedge + meeting the resistance will make it drop) . 

For the lower trend line of the big descending wedge, I can draw it like [this](https://www.tradingview.com/x/uCkga4sG/) and cut no wicks, or like [this](https://www.tradingview.com/x/tr6ESYSI/), cut 2 candles but have more contact points. Also, I could show it [on the 1d](https://www.tradingview.com/x/rlMBSOzi/) and those 2 candles become a wick that I could easily dismiss as an outlier/flash drop. Which drawing would be more correct according to you?

Also, I have no idea how to draw the downtrend channel we've been in since 19k, the steep drop to 6k makes it impossible to draw a parallel without[ cutting a few daily candles](https://www.tradingview.com/x/oktKYM7n/). 

Bonus question, what's your view on using log/linear chart? I use mostly log but I've seen the argument that for linear in smaller time frame.

Pretty long post so I won't be mad if you don't respond to everything, thanks for your time anyway :-)

I really don't think a wash trader would operate that way. Seems much more logic to cause a big red candle and then a big green candle than to spoof like this.
It's almost like I'm not convinced the market wants to go up...what a crazy position to hold huh? 

There is a very big difference between 1 dude market buying 1-2k btc and a bunch of different people buying as a genuine push. 

I mean, believe whatever yall want but I personally remember when this market used to look legit and most of this lately doesn't look super bullish. 

I really don't care if you guys think I'm wrong, this sub has been wrong since like $15k downwards lmao 

I actually do think there's a possibility this is the bottom, I just don't think a slow climb upwards is the way we'll recover. 
This sub has some special folks it’s best just to look downvote and move on. I think I’m learning it with muh manipulation posts.
Based on a Bloomberg leak from Soros' fund manager Adam Fisher:

https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-04-06/soros-prepares-trade-cryptocurrencies-amid-plunging-prices 
No it’s because some particular people in this sub are absolutely convinced 1 or 2 guys are completely responsible for all movements. Pretty dumb to willingly enter a market that is controlled by a guy sitting in his basement. If you believe that and you enter then you’d be better off abandoning TA, sentiment or anything else and heading to the casino for blackjack or pass line bets in craps. 
Actually he's probably right on that. If you follow "actualAdviceBitcoin" you know he loves to alternate between sell and buy walls and he has at least 7k btc on bitfinex. But maybe he has friends this time.
OK, let's put our critical thinking caps on.

Without any insider info, we see a series of 1,000 BTC bids and/or asks being placed and pulled all at once. Is it more likely that it's:

* One incredibly well-capitalized entity, motivation unknown, placing these bids and asks
* 10,000 individual traders simultaneously placing bids and asks of 0.1 BTC each at the same price point?

Now if your point is that we don't know whether it is a guy, girl, institution, consortium, cartel, alien, or my neighbor's dog doing that...well, I'll grant you that. But for some reason I don't think that's what you meant.
I don't care to prove to you that one person (or entity, doesn't matter in this case) is propping up the same 5k btc wall. I don't even understand how you could possibly think that's multiple entities. It's 100% a spoof wall.

this doesn't even conflict with your bullish narrative so I'm not sure why you feel threatened

I don't have any facts...believe what you want. It's pretty obvious to everyone else 
But now you have people borrowing money to sell btc aka high leverage shorts lol, this is the most fun boring game in the world.
In addition most legit giant walls are often hidden. If someone truly wants to accumulate or sell at a certain level they don't want people trading with that knowledge.
He didn't intend to sell. He just got eaten by fomo
I don't love it either, but it is the nature of this marketplace.

I'll put it this way, if the fact that someone could at any time sell thousands of Bitcoin and really move the price purely for manipulative reasons affecting traders makes you not want to own bitcoin, you better not own bitcoin.  Similarly if you don't want to be short something which can be forced significantly higher in price by a single market player in a very short period of time, don't be short Bitcoin.

There are lots of reasons to be careful with leverage in this space.  But the truth is none of these games can control the price in either direction forever.
I see 5 or 6 rejected spikes down. 
His 100x leveraged long 
True mate, trading on feelings has costed me a few coins in the past. I try hard to control my impulses, so far they are under control.

I hope I can learn more with you guys in this thread so that moving forward I trade even more efficiently.  Thumbs up!
Thanks for the informative post instead of downvotes, appreciate it cheers. I am holding my fiat as of now, it is still Sunday so we can sit on the sides and watch it unfolding. :)
I understand each user has an underlying cost, but in this case it simply can't be higher than what they were getting from each user, if it was then their business model is fucked up.

I don't know why we're talking about these users like it's a one or the other decision on the part of the exchange. 
I hate the personal finance subs. Anything remotely risky is instantly downvoted to oblivion. I'm sorry but some risk is useful in a portfolio, it's all just risk/reward after all.

Oh ok, haha
I've often wondered who their customer base was before today, now doubly so :)

That fee is for <5btc/month traders though, at more normal volumes, i.e. >100btc/month, it's a more reasonable 25bps/15bps.  Still high of course, but cheaper than GDAX.
>2017 ($3000>$1911) was 2 months

that was a bear market you guys.
The only true bear markets btc has had was after the bubble to $32 (crashed to $2), after the $1200 top (2014 bear market) and now. The other ones that you mentioned were corrections within a overlying bull market
I think it's definitely 2014 right now. Not due to either but simply due to the charts looking most similar
I can see we're having a slow bleed but what expectation do you have? 
so they can sell then higher. So we have lower highs and lower lows.
Appreciate it mate. Got a good lesson today on divergences. I'll look out for them moving forward!
Interesting if accurate. 

Right now it's running at 50 on the testnet I believe.

- "there is no correlation between Tether print and BTC pumping" --> doesn't need to be, finex can use tether to short as well

- "in fact printing happen after or during a bullrun" --> Look at the picture you posted: they have been printing USDt during the bullrun (nov and dec) as well as during the selloff (jan and feb) as well as the entire 2017 which is not shown in the picture.

iFinex had to post proof of its dollar holdings 1 year ago, then they said they were being audited by Friedman LLP, then Friedman LLP declared they didn't want to work for Bitfinex anymore and here we are. 1 year has passed, millions of tether were printed without any kind of proof and you tell me to trust bitfinex?

Do you work for bitfinex?

EDIT: damn reddit formatting
Not in this case since it is 1x leverage. I don't agree with DushmanKush with a lot of things but you can't argue with math. However, I think if you are using more than 1x leverage than shorting or longing has risks and neither is "better" at making more of what you want. 
this
90% of your wedge is entirely intra-day. how could you possibly be charting this on a daily timescale.

And no, i try not to cut wicks unless they are very obvious outliers.
Just a reflection here... it sounds to me as if you may be ready to take something off the table - perhaps put some portion of it in something without the volatility? Or buy some real estate with a part of it, or pay off your mortgage, or whatever might help lower your stress.

But of course you know best.
Career traders or new traders in the crypto market? I'm speaking of actual professionals. Yes I know we're creating a new batch of full-time traders in crypto, but they aren't who I am speaking of.

Any professional trader would be very wise to manage taxes quarterly, and those that don't probably aren't exactly professionals.
[deleted]
Yes they finally are, however, facing some resistance in terms of downvotes. lol. Cheers.
Yeah. No bad opinions about kraken at all... 
Why are people down voting this? Prop and flow trading desks would have a field day with a market this unregulated.
Whether or not we break that next blue downtrend line and head toward your red line is indeed the big question. I am bullish in the short-term so I think it will happen, if for no other reason than that the slope is so steep on that next downtrend that it would require more shorting for it to be maintained, but short interest is already extremely high. Even if the price falls slowly we'll break it; and if it's broken, I believe there will be more buying.
Last week his walls (like 6-8k) got bought up within minutes, and price barely moved $100 - what would be the point of this? And do you think big whales are just waiting to buy those walls at the exact moment he pulls them up? idk honestly, seems like some guy is just trying to create some movement by trying to ignite fomo
Lol what? u/SloppySynapses post makes no mention of manipulation. He simply stated that the rise was relatively tempered which is true in comparison to previous violent movements up and down. 
I never said he's responsible for all movement. i just think it's an incredibly blatant attempt at manipulation
 

You think dozens or hundreds of people are simultaneously putting up and pulling 5k btc? 
Correct, there are *very* well-capitalized players on the major exchanges, and they are playing 3D chess.

If you don't know aabtc or don't understand what we're talking about, please lurk, learn, research, and ask questions instead of downvoting.
Oh wow, so smart. I guess this guy with a 1,000 btc is responsible for all movement by placing limit orders and canceling them. I never thought about that! I guess this guy wanted it to drop from 20k to 6k by removing and putting walls up the whole way. 

It’s hilarious if you don’t think many people are involved in moving the market in any direction. Why would you actively trade a market in which one guy has the power to do this? That’s a serious question. Unless you had insider info from this person you’d be pure gambling. 

I feel so enlightened. Thank you! 
This is true, but not always. Hidden walls are great for the contrarian play...but visible walls work great, too. For example, place a large bid $10 or $20 above where you think there will be support, let the laggard shorters/sellers fill 2/3s of it, and then the market eventually runs out of sellers and the price bounces. Congratulations, you just got the best possible fill at the bottom of the movement, and also showed the rest of the market that there is strong support at that level.

Of course it's risky and not guaranteed to work, but neither is anything else in trading (and whales are not immune to this, contrary to speculation).
Wrong. You don’t leave a wall up for 12hrs without the intention to sell
He absolutely intended to sell. It was clear at the time, and he also confirmed as much when he did a reddit post a few years later.
> But the truth is none of these games can control the price in either direction forever.

This is the key. Too many people view whales/manipulators as billionaires smoking cigars deciding "let's make BTC $10k next week." That's not how it works, that's not how any of this works. Manipulation works best when the manipulator/whale makes the move that the market wanted to make deep down anyway. Massive buying/selling on a breakout/breakdown at a key decision point, when you're relatively sure the market was going to break that way anyway.

It's very lucrative to be the first one to buy 500 BTC during a TA breakout, and that's why whales do it when they feel the time and conditions are right. But it's also incredibly risky. We saw this the other day when someone tried to make the "suprise bear flag break upwards" thing happen, and it wasn't happening. Nobody followed, there was an immediate 100% retrace, and even worse (for the buying whale) the market saw the sign of weakness and immediately broke down from the bear flag instead.
Bonne chance! 🍀
would either look for 6800 for long or 7200 breakout long here 
It's not one or the other but yeah, neither of us know their rationale for hiking the rates on the low end. Companies do it all the time though, for a variety of reasons (like Netflix and Amazon Prime hiking their rates). It might just be that they got popular enough that they think they can get away with it now and keep enough of their user base. It might be that the shrimp are increasing their costs. It might be that they want to encourage the shrimp to trade more to get into the higher tiers, or leave. We can only speculate.
Potato Tomato
Look back at the commentary during that period, you would have thought Roger Ver showed up in the sub and was slapping people in the face with his dick, which was made of a an alt coin that was going to take over Bitcoin.
OK, so the question I guess I was asking Sloppy, king of the 2014 comps, is his thoughts on the current situation being a correction within a overlying bull market vs the two you referenced. 

Is there a specific duration or % decrease (or % decrease * months of duration = x variable) to define a "bear" market or is it a matter of semantics?
Sigh. I just cannot picture a multi-year bear market like that right now. But I guess that is what people said then? 

IDK, it just seems like its a bear market right now until a huge inflection point (ideas above) where Bitcoin is still on the tip of everyone's tongues and something happens = "oh neat, bull market." 

But you are right, the charts look alike. 

so basically two trends moving together, then a move gets more probable ? I like that
>"in fact printing happen after or during a bullrun" --> Look at the picture you posted: they have been printing USDt during the bullrun (nov and dec) as well as during the selloff (jan and feb) as well as the entire 2017 which is not shown in the picture.

Yes Tether printing happened before the big sell off, pro traders know how to recognize a bubble and Finex was printing tether in anticipation of USDT demand
The point is that you need to short more contracts than the entire notional value of your BTC portfolio to profit from a downtrend/dump.

It doesn’t matter in what currency you count your gains, but you should generally count the notional value of your portfolio in the opposite currency you are betting against
That.
Ok much thanks! 
I have no debts. I do need to take some off the table though.
Poor argumentation.

Where did wealth accrue most in 2017? What demographic held the bulk of ETH & BTC throughout?

Many (if not most) of the largest funds in crypto have offshore entities (i.e. Cayman). Most of the largest individual benefactors pay spring taxes.
missing the point of the conversation
They had a bad trading engine. Not anymore. But they didn't steal money and weren't hacked. Get a sense of proportion. You were saying others are not better, which just ISN'T TRUE.
It doesn't have to be the same guy, and they were just pulled from the orderbook. Think he sold 100 or so. 

It's just that, if i had around 7k of btc as this whale seems to have, and i wanted to artificially pump the market for profit what i would do is sell enough to get the candle to 6900. Buy back below 6900 and when hitting 6900 pump it back to where it was. Then sell over 7050. 
Literally one thread down he does and yes in this sub if it rises fast people scream manipulation if it moves at all people scream it actually. I think people are pretty tired hearing  about “muh manipulation”. 
I don't really care to defend myself here anymore mate, I appreciate it though. This subs bulls (and in general really) have a memory span of about 24 hours

How absolutely brain dead do you have to be to not see that 2k sell walls are blatant manipulation? lmao 
What is aabtc? I’m intrigued.

EDIT: nvm, Twitter.
Stop wasting everyone's time, stop strawmanning me, and pay attention. I made a very narrow claim based on easily observable behavior (the 1,000 BTC walls being placed and pulled are very likely one person, or at best, a couple of people working together). You extrapolated that into one person being responsible for *all* market movement, which is obviously nonsense.

I even [commented specifically about this](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8anmvt/daily_discussion_sunday_april_08_2018/dx1dmr8/) earlier today:

> Too many people view whales/manipulators as billionaires smoking cigars deciding "let's make BTC $10k next week." That's not how it works, that's not how any of this works.

And proceeded to explain when and how manipulation works, and when and how it doesn't.

If you don't understand what we're talking about, please lurk, learn, research, and ask questions. Stop embarrassing yourself.
Of course . But even whales can be delusional. Thats why it was so shocking. 
I remember being here and there were definitely people calling it another 2 year bear market.
It really depends, we could be in for a big run-up here...the 2014 bear market suggests we would be going to $12k here
Noooo It means we keep going down.

Seriusly. Don't trade. Read a lot, use a testnet, because you are clueless even to basic logic.
I think most of the bearish shorters who post here are not expecting BTC to go to $0.01 or they would not be here.  They will try to ride it in both directions and if they increase their BTC stash by shorting, that is a success and can be measured as such.  I don't short but if I doubled my BTC stack during a downtrend, I would definitely consider that a success and measure it in both BTC and fiat.

To be fair, you guys are both talking past each other. He says "you can never know" as in, you can't be positive whether or not a pump / short-term bull move is the start of a bigger run. However, he has reasons to believe now is a good (or better than before) time to have some faith in the bullish movements.
Old-school Bitcoiner, well-capitalized trader, talks a lot of shit, active on BitMEX and other markets. Seems he can back it up, best as I (and others) can tell.

https://twitter.com/actualadvicebtc

See the [BitMEX leaderboard](https://www.bitmex.com/app/leaderboard) for at least some proof, where he's been crushing it with amounts that would make almost everyone here blush.
I just could never grasp it! I think you guys make some HUGE assumptions and then go ahead and trade anyway even though you’re actively admitting you are at the mercy of a single person getting us past here. In this example what  evidence do you have that this mythical person is going to “drop it” once “he” sees it go past a certain number? 

Why would you seriously put money into a market that these people do that to and actively trade  it? It fascinates me because it’s worse than gambling because no amount of indicators besides an order book matter then. At least in blackjack if the dealer is showing a 10 and I have a 4 I should always hit. Sorry I don’t go through a users comments but frankly I don’t care to do that. This sub goes into hysterics screaming manipulation! With any movement. I can’t stress how stupid it is to actively trade a market that you believe in this while not being privy to insider knowledge. You’ve failed to answer this over and over. If you say you want to gamble that’s fine, but that isn’t really any sort of analysis. 
which was stupid because it wasnt more than a 40% correction...

and it was only 2 months. this is 3 months going on 4 and a 70% correction
That'd be cool. Then horrible later. Let me load up some gdax buys and kick it off. 
Yes, of course no one expects BTC to go to 0.01
Thing.
Do you have a problem with reading comprehension? You keep railing on and on about things that have nothing to do with what I said. Yes, part of this sub is delusional about manipulation sometimes. See my post directly above yours where I refute these claims. Yet you keep responding to me like I'm some tinfoil hat nut.

* I don't think we're "at the mercy" of a single person. I think a single person/entity is placing the walls, simply because that's the most likely explanation.
* I specifically prefaced my original post as speculation, because I don't have evidence about his/their motivations. Just my theory based on how and where the walls are being placed. If you have any experience with Bitcoin markets and markets in general, you'd understand that one function of spoof walls is to test market sentiment. If you want to understand more, ask questions instead of being a know-it-all jerk.
* I put money into this market because I do very well trading it despite all the shenanigans, whale games, manipulation, etc. I don't mind that this is a largely unregulated free market where well-capitalized players are free to do these things. The market will sort things out regardless of their actions. Manipulation doesn't matter in the long run. I just make a note of when interesting things happen, and one entity throwing around $41M of Bitcoin on one market is certainly interesting to me and many others here.

Seriously, you've been here for a little while, stop acting like a jerk. Learn who the good posters are, separate the noobs from the pros, and try to learn some more.
Was an unknown at the time, but as it turned out, the mother of all buying opportunities.
