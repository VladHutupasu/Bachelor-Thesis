Goooooood morning.

Set alarms last night in case shit hit the fan while I slept. NONE of them went off (volume set to 'mute'). In a cruel twist of irony, the only reason I woke up was because my dog took a massive shit in our bedroom and I smelled it. So I get up, clean up the mess, go to my computer anddddddd.....

Buyers may very well recover here and push for another leg up above $7,600. 

If they don't, however, and there's another leg down instead, that should be very concerning for anyone holding a long. 

At the very least, a technical bounce to $7,800 should have been a slam dunk for buyers. 

RSI is still oversold on the 12h, and it's just barely above 30 on the 2h through 6h. Sellers essentially left the house unlocked, stepped out to buy a pack of cigarettes and said, "don't steal anything while we're gone, mmmkay?" And so far, buyers have listened.
Closed all my shorts at $7268/$7312 for a nice gain ( Shorts: $7650/$7707) 

Simply because I’ll be making a speech today and checking the price won’t be a priority ( for once ). 

I’ve been on a hot streak recently and I’ve now made close to 100% of my trading stack back, and being a new trader I feel pretty accomplished. Although, it’s really not hard to make money shorting in a bear market.. but still. 
who's buying this dip??!! - this chart seems legit and i saw another theory yesterday basically saying this is the third and final drawdown before next run up.  The first one was the capitulation cause the volume was huge, the second was not as big and didn't go as low, and this one is the lowest volume and also has not gone as low as the last.  So risk to reward buying now seems pretty good

Man the term BGD is way overused. The short squeeze at 6.5k was a BGD. The reversal from 6k were BGDs. This is not a BGD. This is not even bigger than the previous 4h red candle. 

Thou shalt not take the name of thy BGD in vain
Buyers are still jumping in, but I'm beyond wary of the upward-sloping "bull flag" -- has barted down in most cases over the last 30 days. Still operating within our downward channel. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/wh978jHH/

RSI reset on medium time frames (15m-1H), and all time frames are out of oversold. Shorting anywhere from 7550-7600 with close stops offers a valuable R/R play for anyone skeptical that we'll retest 7800. 
We all know Crypto markets are being manipulated. Some of us seem to enjoy it, some of us seem to pretend it doesn't happen. But ultimately, it makes the market less attractive for many large investors.

Yes, Bitcoin being decentralized and unable to be tampered with is arguably its biggest advantage over fiat money, but that doesn't mean that criminals should be able to control the market. Everyone saying this is all FUD has it completely backwards. I know I sound like meme at this point but the crackdown on the obvious market manipulation is actually good for Bitcoin^tm .
I sold at $7280. You are welcome. DOH!
I may get my hand slapped for alt coin discussion in the daily, but the Turkish lira is losing value much like the euro

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2018-05-23/lira-tumbles-to-record-as-lack-of-central-bank-action-fuels-rout

The response in Turkey is to raise interest rates to discourage the need to print money so quickly

This is why I'm in bitcoin
Personally I don't think we're going to know for sure what the long-term trend is until we get closer to the right side of the triangle we're in. (You all know the one I'm talking about). For now we're just going sideways. Up or down, we don't know. But by late June or early July, we should have a much better idea of where the price will likely be heading for the rest of the year.


Sorry if this unhelpful, redundant, or useless to say but those are my thoughts on the larger picture right now.
I'm so sick of Crypto, I keep telling myself on every big bounce (like the latest one to near 10K) I'm going to sell but I never do, it's like a drug, like that girl you're obsessed with until you sleep her and then you realise she's nothing special.

Don't get me wrong, I haven't made any losses, I don't even know how much I'm up but I don't give a shit, it's no longer about the money, I just don't want to spend 4 hours a day looking at charts and thinking about this shit. It's not worth it, there are so much easier ways to make money in this world, heck I have a high 6 figures job, the amount of time I spent looking at charts from September-December 2017 alone made me lose money in my actual job.

So I ask if any one here knows, when the fuck is this going to bounce back because this time I am done, I am selling and I will let the crypto billionaires tell me I was wrong in a few years, at this point I don't care, just want my life back 
The feel of not being overinvested anymore is pure bliss. Yeah sure I see my cold storage value plummeting currently, but so be it, I'm pretty confident we'll go up in the long run. 

Meanwhile I'm enjoying a cold one on my new terrace which I completely funded with my gains, cheers guys :)
Shorted at around $7,550

EDIT: There's tons of resistance overhead, particularly at $7,800 that should protect my entry even if this does make a break for it to the upside.

The market fell short of testing the [triangle support line](https://imgur.com/a/jrYHG5U) that we've all been watching. It may fall within the confines of "close enough," but I'm leaning toward a final drop down to test it around $7,000. 

Also, in the event that the market does fall through support once it's tested, I'd prefer to be in a more comfortable position than I would have if I waited to short the breakdown.
https://www.tradingview.com/x/y7xxWUqr/

after we popped back into the channel, we bounced back off of the support line.

the main reason so many were saying they don't want to long this is because of a gut feeling that lines up with RSI. 

To explain, we haven't even seen a bull div yet; if you look at the last time we dumped to $7.3k, we saw a series of cascading bull divs from the dump from $8.8k. This resulted in a mini BGD that brought us back to $9.1k.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/TMgj0nFz/

Right now, we have 0 bull divs to speak of from the 1h to the 1d. We are just moving straight down in our channel with RSI hitting lower lows with the price. 

For me, I'm comfortable waiting to add more to my short at around $7900-7950. If we don't get there, I will just wait for another dump with a bull div or two before closing my shorts and then adding on a rebound, depending on how we react to the triangle trendlines. How we react to the support line will be very interesting and give a good indication of a continuation of the downtrend from $20k or a bullish summer. 

If we break above $8100-8150 then I will mainly be confused and have to reassess
If only for aesthetic reasons, take a moment to appreciate how much the market has been paying attention to Fibonacci retracement levels between our previous 6.4 low (April 1) and the 10k high (May 5):

https://www.tradingview.com/x/umdi6E4I/
if you thought gdax was bad, try Coinbase Pro.. 
  
I tought its not possible to make gdax worse, oh boy was i wrong..
I honestly cant tell if its bear or bull. Super weak on both sides. A good game of ping pong going on.
Since we're going sideways after a bounce and things are looking slightly confusing, it's time to poll!

Which first: $5999 or $10001?

Is somebody's bot broken on BFX? This Is the longest constant steam of 0.02 BTC market buys/sells I've ever seen.


Nice green candle here.  Too early to call this a reversal.  [There are some key resistance lines above that should be areas of interest and will present good short/long intersections depending on the break. ](https://www.tradingview.com/x/fIZ0Cshu/)

I still think it's highly likely we'll touch down on the bottom wedge support line here in the next few days.  Right now the line intersects at about $7025, and will put 1D RSI neatly at 30. Any buy off the line is likely to see a bounce and would be good RR with stops set just below the line.  Any decisive move below the line will be a big shorting opportunity as the market will likely test lower lows \(sub $6k\).  In this bearish case, I don't see the support line breaking without price making several attempts over the course of a few days in a consolidation pattern.

Similarly for a bullish case, I don't think we'll see a turn around without some level of consolidation in the $7000\-$7500 range.  If you're playing it safe for a long term long position, [I'd wait for a crossover on the 1D MACD as it's been a fairly reliable indicator for direction change over the last couple months in these longer continuation swings. ](https://www.tradingview.com/x/tRM0czwN/)

So did Wall Street Chinese finally got their New Year bonuses?
Closed my short at $7,340. 

Edit: bullish divergence is starting to form on lower and medium timeframes. RSI is also extremely oversold across the board. 

Holding a short is just crazy right now. 

The market could certainly continue being crazy, but it's not worth the risk.  

So I’m at work (I work for myself) and I just sold and made quite a loss. I think I’m gonna just play some Far Cry 5 for the rest of the day 
i tend to be a crypto permabull and just drawed some log scale trendlines since mid 2015. the trendline is today at around 2500$ and will reach the BTC ATH around 20k in August 2020:

https://imgur.com/a/0Gzl1ym

edit: this trendline doubles up every 9 months
Crude idea expressed with crude drawing tools, I know.  But I just wanted to put this out there to see if anyone else is expecting the same.

https://imgur.com/a/7UoT4r7

I'm basically just following up on the idea of the 30-day cycles that I posted about yesterday, and what that would look like within the context of the large pennant we're all watching.

I'm thinking we could begin climbing here until the middle of next week where we would:

* approach (short term) TL resistance around 7900 (also near the low of 7925 from a week ago)
* from there, continue downward with a test of the rising log support around 6950 on 4-June. 
* if it holds, begin new bull cycle to test descending pennant resistance around 4-July at 8680

After that, it's a wait and see game to determine if there will be a breakout, or continue downward within this pennant that extends out to mid-August.  

I know trying to predict the future is a fool's errand, just wanted to see if anyone had similar thoughts besides "when 3k?"/"when moon?"
Hypothetical convo came up today that involved taking a 60 day rollover from an IRA, buy close to the rising log trendline, set a stop loss at 10% below and cover the loss out of pocket to make up the difference and avoid any penalties if things go south. Otherwise, ride the wave back up within the pennant and take 20% profit if we get close to the large pennant resistance. Sounded like an awful idea at first, but maybe not all that crazy the more I thought about it. On a scale of BCH to BTC, how stupid do you think this would be?

Edit: this was predicated by the convo about the 30 day cycles between lows and highs which would give you enough time to put the money back. 
I've got competing narratives.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/kxS8mthK/

There's a red channel and a blue channel. The red channel is a bearish forecast, IMO, and the blue channel is a bullish forecast. 

Both forecasts show the April low as a sort of inflection point in RSI and price. Both trends pivot at that point.

The most plausible channel looks like the blue channel to me. Significantly more price history fits into the blue channel and the red channel looks like an artificial narrative that you can only create using price swings from the last 6 months.

The problem I'm having is that none if this really looks or feels right. The emergent narrative about bitcoin and the developing tools fundamentally prove the red channel wrong... but price performance for the last six months are showing that we need to change our long-term channel in some fundamental way.

BBands are as tight as they've been since May of 2017.

If we're not in or entering a period of focused consolidation then I have no idea where we are on the road map.
Tether's auditor Friedman LLP, was subpoenaed by the CFTC, looks like this news just came out for everyone to see.

> Friedman LLP, a New York-based auditing firm, was also subpoenaed by the CFTC after Tether hired it last year to assess claims that Tether held enough U.S. dollars, according to a person familiar with the matter.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-24/bitfinex-said-to-find-bank-in-puerto-rico-after-wells-fargo-exit
So bull divs are the May version of March IH&S. Not so many  patterns left now!
Why is the Bloomberg news particularly significant? Wasn't it a known unknown that investigators were going to start stepping in? 

Some people here succumb to hysteria rather quickly.  
I love how this Bloomberg article: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-24/bitfinex-said-to-find-bank-in-puerto-rico-after-wells-fargo-exit

Is a blatant rip off of BitMex Research Team’s work, which I called out a few days ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8jvhtv/comment/dz2xtfu?st=JHKL943G&sh=8087ea46

Note, BNY Mellon holds all of Tether’s cash (it IS 1:1 backed). This is entirely separate from the criminal probe re: wash trading, spoofing, etc.

(Also FYI, I live in PR and can confirm the crypto scene is growing very rapidly.)
This move up feels like 'meh, do we really have to?'.
For the first time since 2014 I'm thinking about putting new money to work. This CFTC investigation is exactly the kind of news to create the "blood in the streets" type of day, and that's when you want to buy. I'm expecting quite a bit of short term pain, but the potential for bitcoin 5 years from now hasn't changed. The genie is out of the bottle, crypto is not going away. Going to sit on the charts all day and maybe scoop up a few coins on a dump.
Read the Bloomberg news and exited my long immediately at $7375 for more or less no gain. 

!long xbtusd close 7375

Edit: I never trade news. Never. 

But an investigation by the Justice department is likely to cause some panic in the short term. 
Bull flag failed to break out. Breakout attempt occured on low volume. RSI reset and inside the bbands again. Downtrend not breached.

Short @7535. Alarms around 7675.

First TP is 7450.

Edit: First TP reached. Taking 25% profit.

Edit2: Bounced harder than I thought of that level. Taking another 10% @7465

Edit3: Got the rest out @7515. I can't math but if you followed you are in a little profit.
BTCUSDSHORTS still relatively flat on the daily.  Even decreasing in the previous two days as the cover.  I'm totally surprised.  I would have expected it to start forming a mountain by now.
Went outside for 10 min and then suddenly a wild BGD appeared and cleared all my short term limit sells. I guess bart is doing a comeback
Who here is a day trader and does not hold a regular full time position? In other words, who here only trades as a means of living?
If $bulls fail to break this line with conviction, this bear flag could/should break down soon.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/GQU1m1nH/

I mentioned it yesterday. I'm partially in fiat since $16k and I'm a patient bubble cycle trader since 2011. I'm starting to look for a long-term entry anywhere between where we are now and $5.5k. I'd love to see $5.5k as it would guarantee maximum pain before the market turns around. But I'm not sure $bulls are strong enough to push it that far.
If it doesn't pump 100-200 bux soon, does that mean its gonna drop here?

[chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/0MAj1Vxq/)
For any of you platform conspiracy theorists out there.. Bitmex DOWN contracts are at $7250 for May and expire tomorrow. Bitcoin dumped all the way down to $7256 this morning before getting rejected hard. Granted, this was a technical cluster, so a bounce there wouldn’t be surprising, but the timing and price significance does seem interesting nonetheless. I don’t mean to be throwing wild theories around, but I still thought it was worth sharing.

(s/o to Flood for pointing this out: https://mobile.twitter.com/ThinkingUSD/status/999805317130080256)
If the market can't get above $7,730 soon we'll see some hidden bearish divergence on 2H. 

Still holding my short, a little less confidently than when I initially opened it, but still not expecting my stops to hit above $7,900 anytime soon.
Since I haven't seen it in a few weeks:

[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/YRZvdurN\-The\-target\-of\-current\-bubble\-lays\-between\-40k\-and\-110k/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/YRZvdurN-The-target-of-current-bubble-lays-between-40k-and-110k/)

As far as I'm concerned, it's still holding up. Pretty.... pretty..... pretty fuckin epic. 

Don't worry haters of this chart. I won't post it again for a few more weeks.
Good day! I hope everybody is feeling AWESOME today, the Bitcoin market has followed my previous report, and we are currently testing critical support, lets take a look.

As you can see the market is in a bit of panic at the moment with sellers maintaining control for the time being. We can see the volume clearly picking up as we reach our critical support level at $7200 - $7400, like mentioned in my previous report.

The Head and Shoulders pattern has broken to the downside (for the time being) and this is a massive bearish signal for the Bitcoin market. As we can see the PPO indicator is hinting that there are some bulls appearing on the scene, however please remember a dead cat bounce is quite normal after a heavy sell-off in any market.

The cat could bounce as high as $7800, but most long entries on the market at this point should be considered high risk. For those wishing for safer trades, it would be better to wait for consolidation above the right shoulder of the pattern.

Like I mentioned previously $7200 is my longer term support zone, and should we fail to consolidate above here I would expect the bearish market conditions to continue. With that said I will be keeping an eye on the price action in this zone to show me the way forward. Those that follow my reports will remember that I mentioned $9600 as a good place to take some profits, now I am looking at good places to enter the market again. Safe trades.

Do not get tricked with this Green Candle. We're still in triangle. [https://www.tradingview.com/x/1xj572nH/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/1xj572nH/)
So funding rate turned negative on bitmex, meaning more shorts than longs. Did not see this in a while, but was not very observant either
Added to my short here at $7,630. Which is a rarity for me, but I just don't have any faith in a break above $7,800 and I can't see this going much higher. 

The 45m chart I'm working off of to hedge my LT position is going cray. Short from 8421 and still isn't letting up. I'm going to put the rest of my trading stack into this 45m chart, me thinks.

Crazy how this fractal has been on point lately
Not trusting this technical, probably rsi driven bounce. Staying in my hedge short, thinking about adding to it in layers up to 7.8k. Would bail completely over 7.9k i think. This might get expensive tho if i am wrong and it's more than a technical bounce.
Slight side\-topic.

Are you traders here using any specially designed trading interfaces? Or are you managing your orders using the exchange interfaces directly?

Please enter my research poll :\) [https://www.strawpoll.me/15761737](https://www.strawpoll.me/15761737)

The high\-level problem I'm having is, I'm often on\-the\-go on a mobile phone, and not in a position to quickly assess the market at a glance, manage position sizing, risk or even portfolio balancing \(exchange vs cold storage\).

Existing exchange interfaces don't have great mobile interfaces and leave every single option available to traders, regardless of my strategy or the situation or context I'm in.

I’ve been profitable \(both fiat and BTC\) in the past two months while being mostly on\-the\-go on a phone. I just feel I could be more profitable if I traded with a better interface that helps me more in these situations. I’m using Tradingview for charting, and Kraken's web interface for order management \(which really sucks\).

How are you all managing these kinds of situations? The sensible thing to do is of course not to trade at all in these situations. But I’m convinced there are betters ways to be a profitable trader when you’re on the go, at a glance, or have limited information available.
So the price bounced $200 in 1 hour and after 10 hours has moved up another $100.

The RSI's have cooled off so I'm thinking the DCB has peaked. 

Would sir / madam care for a short?
I'm annoyed and tired of this chop. Closed the rest of my short at B/E(fees included). Gained a bit by closing 30% down there though so I won't complain too much. 

Downtrend line is moving down at the moment. Will either short the next touch or buy the breakout. Probably buy the breakout cause the line already has been touched quiet often.
RSI has plenty of room to move up.

R/R for a short around 7650-7.7k is great for people who believe we'll see more down. I think we won't see 8.2k  anytime soon and would put my stop there, but 7.9k is probably the better stop. 
Opened a long at $7,350 with stops below $7,200. 

The same reason as I closed my short earlier. Bullish divergence and oversold RSI on medium timeframes. 

!long xbtusd 7350 10x 100%
Don't be too excited about this BGD. The volume is almost twice as low compared to few red 1h candles we had yesterday. \+ we are barely holding 7,500 level.
We have seen this current formation on the way down already haven't we? Looks like it'll go sideways a bit more then just drop back down to the previous low. 

3-4 hours imo 

Eitherway, the 72xx price definitely didn't have the volume of a bottom. 
[I don't know why it's so little used.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8lpstw/daily_discussion_thursday_may_24_2018/dzhuew3/)
Shorting here with a tight stop above 7900, R/R pretty great right now.
Long $1mm @ $7700. Expecting a short term bounce, worth a 3-5% scalp. 
I've been seeing this downward trend line, support turned resistance.  What do you think?  I'm betting downward bart to $7200s.

Edit: So, it looks like it was kind of trying to break out.  But now it is hard to say.  BTC is playing "just the tip"

Scalpped a wee little short from 7400 to 7330, only 10x so peanut money but glad i got to jump out in profit.

It was pure FOMO. When i realised that i wasnt following my plan and letting fomo to short take over, i knew i had to get the fuck out of that trade.

Hate to spread FUD, but: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-24/u-s-weighs-criminal-probe-into-bitcoin-price-rigging?utm_content=crypto&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social

Edit: I say FUD because I feel there is a certain level of uncertainty given that a criminal probe could lead to changes in the way bitcoin is traded. Whether it's bullish or bearish is another matter. 

Edit 2: Link I posted deleted twice from /r/CryptoCurrency 
Downtrend remains in tact. Zoom out and know your strategies and targets. Holding my large short from way up still, and holding my smaller short from this morning at 7380 (just added some at 7525). Still a lot of resistance overhead. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/PAAQW26W/

Hard to watch paper profits vanish so rapidly, but ask yourself what the trend is, why the trend is, and what your strategy was before the market spiked your blood pressure.
Bitmex traders losing faith. Premium went down to ~$30 on june futs.
I know it's rough but we are going to test support around 6850. I'm putting a small buys there. My crypto wealth got destroyed in the last couple days but that's life in this world.

i don't buy the justice dept thing. it might cause some temp. price depression but i'll buy that.

we might break the support line but i'm kinda sure we will bounce a bit from that before doing that.
The trend is your friend. Jumping back into a short after closing my previous one from 8350 at basically this price. Could've ride it out, but feel good about locking profits though.

Have two possible targets for this, bottom of the triangle we are in 7000s or falling through it around 6800. But will evaluate depending how we get there. Stops way up above 7800s. Would prefer to short from there but it's not looking likely.

Saving a tiny bit of ammo for if we climb back up.
So that BTG hack/hard fork raises concerns for the whole crypto scene as it is IMO. Any exchange listing coins that are insecure could find themselves hard forked and the exchanges could actually become insolvent. I mean this could have easily have been an attack on multiple coins rendering an exchange insolvent. It also raises questions on how decentralized exchanges would handle this. Anyone have any thoughts on it? 

Not so much price related this is very much a fundamental issue or am I missing something. This along with tether(and I believe they are solvent) could be the black swan event that people talk of. Many of the shitcoin exchanges use tether and this could potentially be an issue if attacks occur on a coin with decent liquidity to sell into.

EDIT: It's a double spend not a HF to clarify

How do people in here function in society?

I’m not saying we CANT go to 3.2k. I’m saying it’s extremely unlikely and this is a trading sub. Not a “I missed the bull run of 2017 so I need some bear hopium to load up on corn” sub.

This place has deteriorated over the course of 2 days... its insane

I’ll come back when this place is done going through puberty
Broke up out of the ** Trend Reversal Ascending Triangle**, as I predicted before. Not sure why I got so much criticism for posting this, but it played out.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/PP8ox1gc/

Added another 25% to my short at $7706. The resistance above is absolutely bonkers. I’ll add more on way up to $7800 if we reach those levels. 
[removed]
It's a bit premature but if we do bounce on the support at 6.8k this week, we could have a nice hidden bullish divergence on the weekly, maybe enough to break up of this triangle?

https://www.tradingview.com/x/a2XSuF6S/
BGD!!
Unexpected $100+ BGD just now, shy of $7500. How does this work? Was the BB FUD article not that big of
A deal after all? I was expecting opposite movement. Genuine question from a noob.
Like I said [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8lpstw/daily_discussion_thursday_may_24_2018/dzhrye0/), re-testing this [pink breakdown line](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Fbcbu2Y4).
Short @7581 Alarms above 7675. Let's see if buyers can get this up. Hitting the resistance right now.

Edit: Breakout seems to be ending in a low volume shooting star. Very bearish. Adding to short @7585. https://www.tradingview.com/x/zQ2i1GGB/ maybe some support here, but will break soon.

Edit2: TP1 reached. Locking-in 30% @7475
That was one hell of a Matrix Slow-Mo wedge breakdown. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/IQPVtADr/

Took long enough, we will prob bounce back up because it’s **BTC**
It's bit quite in here. I am really curious to see how it closes tonight.
Looks like we are forming a near Identical **Trend Reversal Ascending Triangle Pattern** like last night 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/Ur5jyFST/

The resistance line ( Blue ) from the descending channel is acting as resistance.. both last night and now twice today.

Last night we knocked 4 times before our 5th attempt blasted through.

Tonight, we knocked 4 times and this current 30 Minute candle could be our 5th attempt at the resistance line; where we could blast through like last night.

May close my short here for the smallest profit and wait it out.. only difference is the resistance descending channel line is flirting pretty hard with top of triangle.  Interested to see how it plays out. 

**Edit** Post From Yesterday : [POST](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8lpstw/comment/dzhj07v?st=JHL5ELD0&sh=83e1b4ea) 

Opened 3 BTC long at 7370, stops at 6.7k. RSI about to be on yummy levels today on all lower timeframes including 1 day, will most likely add more soon.
Seems we broke the immediate down channel and may go for a test of the previous channel line, which I have @7730 right now. I expect some chop here since we are close to the long term uptrend line (broken blue). I don't see much strength for a turnaround and eventually it might fall through long term uptrend, which would be quite doomy for me. 
https://www.tradingview.com/x/HJ5FwwJm/
I would be interested where others have their long term uptrend line. I suspect many will have it a bit lower than me. 
My personal red line was @8500, so I pulled out 50% of my stack into fiat. The rest is completely hedged in shorts. 
So, did we just retrace from the support turned into resistnace coming from 8,900? And are we going for 7000-ish, which is the longer term support coming all the way from April? Does it mean that at sometime we gonna see a really BIG long squeeze? If this happens will we go lower 7k support? 
There is this also from CFTC a few days ago, no announcement of a actual investigation, just that they are watching exchanges closely: https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/7731-18

Got knocked out of my short last night, thoughts on a reentry point?
Was that a capitulation wick near 7250?
I give up trying to open a position on Mex this morning. Looks like I'm sitting today out, which might not be such a bad thing.
Trying to reconcile these two charts.  BTCUSD chart price has dropped well into the BGD of 12th April but EUR price is still above the BGD. I assumed that above the BGD there would be some support but once that breached, support would be gone.

With the two different price positions, I'm no sure which price action is more relevant.

Any thoughts?
When do i have to turn bearish ?
If the relief rally occurs I estimate the target to be around $7550 based on mean reversion theory. 
Got myself in a bit of a pickle and could do with some advice. A couple of days ago I opened a 5x long at 8465 (liquidation is at ~6100) and thought I'd set a stop before being away for a day, only to find yesterday I obviously hadn't and that my long was quite badly underwater. 

Stupidly I hoped for a bounce that hasn't come, and now I am even worse off...

I'm not sure whether to cut it loose and take the loss or hang in there in the hope that we make it back to BE or even near enough to make the loss more palatable. 

I'm likely going to be buying in with FIAT if we break below 7k so I could use what I buy to add margin to this position to lower liquidation, but is that a stupid idea?
Is there something you can learn to get better at trading? I always seem to fomo and think the price will go up but then always lose 5% or something every time
12/16/2017 @ Close
Price = 18960
Open Margin Longs = 32976
Open Margin Shorts = 21127

12/22/2017 @ Close
Price = 13173 (low of 10k)
Open Margin Longs: 25596 (Low of 22k)
Open Margin Shorts: 13969 (High of 18.3k)

The good news is that as far as all-time longs open, we are not threatening that number (40K) - I will be alarmed if it continues to increase as the price tests lower levels.  

The bottoming of daily MACD is still very relevant, this is probably indicative of longs not closing since selling pressure on a daily/weekly standpoint is arriving at a current year low.  So there are conflicting things going on.
The 7270 looks like a double bottom imo, but we haven't reached the trendline at around 6950 yet... so... ?
This Coinbase Pro interface needs work. I can only see the Ask side of the order book.  They should do that part like the GDAX one with both sides showing.

[edit - never mind. I can see it on a big high-def screen.  They need to make it more tablet and laptop-friendly.]
Think it may be worth it to buy below and sell above 7.5k for a few days. 3 day and 1 week stoch rsi need to chill for a bit before I'll consider a serious move up. 
double top\* on the bitcoin hourly, maybe we make a reverse head and shoulders.

Ok guys, I've sold an hour ago. Enjoy your bull run. You can thank me later.
Hope you did not sell the bottom
Bull divergence on 1 hr and forming on 4 hr \(though admittedly a little of a stretch calling the first valley a true valley\). That bounce had some serious volume as well, and now we're in a bull flag.

Was on mobile but bought in a portion \(\~15&#37; of total holdings\) when we were down around the 7300 range as well.

Closing out the rest here, bringing the CA exit for the rest of my "short" \(sitting in fiat\) to about 7450. Hoping for a bounce back to at least 7.8k before further down, still generally thinking at least a touch on our favorite triangle is the most likely scenario before we truly make a new local high \(local being above 8.6k\).

!short xbtusd close 7450

\(Edit: Stops on this are tight, below the flag breakdown. Taking a risk on an early entry here and don't want to get caught with my pants down\)
I've made some great profits on scalp longs in the past day. From here this is my scenario and my plan: 

we will test 7750, I'll unleveraged short there. Then we can expect some chop and barts for a few days between there and 7k. Loosely fanned 5x leverage buy orders up under 7.4- 6.9k, stop loss under 6.9k which really don't expect to be get triggered. Ill hold these positions for a while, maybe to around 8.1-8.4k. Probably load up on shorts there. 

Here are my meme lines: https://ibb.co/jTpFi8

I'm writing this down here to hold myself accountable to sticking to this plan.
i think if this goes up it will fuck up much more people then if it goes down since kinda everyone expects goblin town
Now at the lowest level below the dick-line (25% below) since the bet was made 10 months ago...

You need to zoom out and look at the looooong triangle. I think it will hit 4,500 before rebounding.

peace
I woke up today seeing that some buy orders I forgot to close had gone through some BTC some ETH. I must have been so deprieved of sleep that I forgot to check active orders section before going to sleep. So I by accident made 10% profit tonight. Feels good man. But still this kinda shouldnt have happened.

I have now set new limit sells to scale into a new short and limit buys to scale out if price moves enough.
wow perfect double touch down on long term uptrend line and spike to first channel resistance. TA man

June futures on mex are finally at a very small discount (-$10)

I'd guess that when September goes to a near discount or sub $40 premium that we'll be looking at a decently strong local bottom at the very least. They're still at +$70

You can basically trade this market based on how wrong mex traders are lol

Keep an eye on the Trump Admin most likely unwinding the Volcker rule on the 30th.

This has pretty massive (bullish) implications for the crypto market and expanding to institutional investors (in particular, iBanks).

Edit:

Some more color... Basically tl;dr this enables iBanks to openly/freely run prop (for-profit) trading desks. Goldman/Deutsche/Credit Suisse/etc. have all been doing this in backdoors/roudabout ways (Example: GS 'funding' Circle, which in-turn operated as their prop desk via Poloniex [also GS insiders], but if the Volcker rule gets canned/re-written, this could open the floodgates for *massive capital inflow* to the crypto space. Yes, this also opens the door for potential shenanigans (e.g. front-running your Saudi prince & Sinaloa Cartel clients if you're HSBC) and #manipulation; I'll leave it up to your imaginations how that might play out.
With everyone else talking about dildos, I'll just mention...

That moment when your short was not stopped because of $1 difference on stop limit. Pewwwww :\)  I was watching this live and already gave up all the hopes...

Edit: The fact that we broke above the channel and returned straight back to it is very very bad for bulls. But we shall see, maybe this move is not over yet.
I’m trying to find the humour in this situation as for the first time in forever, I was briefly in the red yesterday. This is how far I’ve come, from being up 3000% percent to whittling down my gains thanks to mixing together the mantra of holding and trading. When I’m trading and things look up I usually end up getting back into altcoins( the reason for my gains)as I do not want to miss the potential 10%++ gains, and then when the thing tanks like right now I’m not sure if I should even bother trying to trade and slowly regain back my lost profits or to just hold and wait for the inevitable ride back up ( usually after I sell). Dilemma dilemma. Well Guess I’ll just meme about it for awhile and try to delude myself? 
Not that this really means anything, but we are now at 7 12 hour red candles in a row if we stay this low. Last time this happened was at the drop from 17k, and last time before that was at the drop to 1800 \(both also 7\). Didn't scroll back any further to see if i could find 8 in a row. Again, not commenting on the likelihood of us continuing to drop, just interesting.
This is surprisingly accurate: (not my chart) https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/2EJ1ylA0-BTCUSD-Simple-Fractal-Scary-Symmetry/
Hopefully just the exchange investigation and threat of prosecution will scare some of these manipulators into ceasing their activities.
Oh man, stop-loss on Mex filled at 7731 while I slept. I was so happy to see 73xx when I woke up. Now I feel kinda sick. :-(
Should someone I know who has a bitmex account, but lives in a “banned” country, be concerned about this US criminal probe?

What are the chances Bitmex will lock this person’s account?  He only used VPN to create account and hasn’t taken any other measures to obscure his country of origin from Bitmex.

Should he make a new account. This time being very careful to hide his location and identity from bitmex, and then use a “tumbler” to transfer the coins?  


Breakout or fakeout?
I think the market at this point is likely to do something like this:

1. re-test of the breakdown line at 7500

2. drop to support at 7000 (top of log downtrend line)

3. bounce to as high as 7.6 - 7.8K 

4. drop to 6K (bottom of desc. triangle)

5. bounce to mid 6000's (one last hoorah for the bulls, retest of the log downtrend line)

6. drop to 5K (previous resistance turned support)

7. another big, drawn-out DCB (classic Bitcoin)

8. Bleed/drop down to 2.5K-3K range (Stronger and better tested support, close enough to the previous ATH)

9 bounce and trend reversal (LN and halvening hype)

Unless there's a big shift in sentiment and environment in the meantime. I think the bear market is probably only around its half way mark right now. I don't think the market can bleed out past Q4 or Q1 next year before finding a bottom. 

volume after this BGD has dropped dramatically and 7.5 is on a knife edge. I feel like it's going to drop like a rock here rather than continue up, though biased.
I wanna short this so bad.  Thoughts?
Small short from $7589 Because if the buyers can’t break through $7600 again, just lol.

Will add more on way up. Literally same plan as yesterday. Worked out well too. 

I refuse to long until 7.2k, and the shorting R/R is fuckin dirty. 

I also expect to meet some resistance at the small horizontal purple line:

Where we tested $7650 5 times Yesterday before a breakup. 

**Edit** Added 15% at $7616

**Edit Edit** Added another 25% at $7606
Is it safe to say we are exactly where we would be without the $6900-$8K BGD? If that's the case, $10K seems like a pipe dream with the sad volume. Some people call it accumulation I think nobody really wants to buy to hold.
So someone please tell me what charges any investigation will file since there is no regulation act on crypto to crypto transactions

Ah right, there are nothing to investigate since its no law against it
Just my [volume node thoughts](https://snag.gy/sJUcg1.jpg), I think we probably drop to 6.8-6.9 levels bounce up to where the most volume has been 8.2 (red line) get rejected find support at 7.3 than bounce up off the trend line + volume node and maybe out, I think we bounce in these trend lines awhile longer though. 
/u/MikeXBT are you still long from 7.7? Have your feelings changed since you entered in, still looking for 3-5% upside? Where have you placed your stops?
The blue line has been acting as resistance/support for the past 10 hours or so:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/WfmAXlsC/

Zoomed out, it's this trend line:

Other than that, this current bounce was exactly at 0.786 fib of the recent rally to 9.9K.

Any ideas for a stop loss target for an average buy in with 25% stack @7350? I'm personally just thinking hold it and hope that 7k support line holds, maybe buying more all the way to that line.

We've now tested/thrown back to the previous support of this wedge and found it turned to resistance. We'll see if the actual breakdown happens now; notice the tightening BBands on the 15 min as well. Obviously should always be taking any 15 min formation with quite a large pinch of salt, maybe the buyers will actually show up to play.
This is the part where greedy bears get a blow off bottom for a nice higher low, proving once again the Feb low was the bottom. 
Epic shakeout. Nice spring into the accumulation range.

This might be a "out there" but I noticed that todays pump, though also being in the cards for technical reasons, almost perfectly coincided with Trumps announcement to pull out of the North Korea summit. Gold also massively pumped while the USD is going down atm, and stock markets also not doing well.

So the question, is BTC becoming an investment choice in uncertain times like gold?

Edit: rephrased the question. 
This sub is very bearish.

Time to go long.
Do you think this is enough capitulation to kick start a proper bull run to ATH (over months) or do we need more blood?

Do you think it's sideways for months after this or will volatility be back?
Fun Fact: 
This is the biggest one hour green candle we have had in the last few days.

April 19th @ 7 am was the last biggest one and just a bit bigger than this one.
Here's what I'm seeing.

I reentered a position with a limit buy at 7450 this afternoon. I'd hoped to get in at 7250, but just missed it be a few $$ before the pump today. 

My reasoning for reentering: We finally set a higher high and higher low on the 4H chart. We then set a lower high and are currently looking to set a higher low in the next 3 hours or so. 

It seems that the worst of the FUD is behind us at this point, and although there wasn't a 'V' shaped bounce, we did get a decent bounce with continuation. I have a Stop set for 7250 just to play it safe since that would mean we've broken our lower low from earlier today.

Current resistance: 7629, 7734

Current support: 7446, 7269

So with 7400 being broken/battled a bit, is it a pretty much foregone conclusion of going to 7200/6800/6600? (I've heard all 3 numbers quoted as being pretty much end points of the drop with most saying 6800/6600 being the end points from what I've seen).  Do I need to worry about my very profitable short somehow facing a big bounce back from the 73xx level?  I know that every situation can be different but I am relatively newish to trading and the bitcoin space and haven't been through the previous dumps like some of you have.
Down 10&#37; on total investment. Cutting this would mean my profits reduced to 20&#37; of my total investment capital.

I have to update my hashrate spreadsheets less and less often these days, but we are still growing geometrically, so updates still have to happen. I just plugged in 31 exahash/s, and this gives us a US residential electricity cost per coin of $4500. This is just the electricity to run the mining units themselves, this doesn't include air conditioning or rent or staffing or capital expenditures on the miners in the first place. I figure $0.10/kWh is probably too high for the average miner, but this overestimation makes up for ignoring the other costs.

the part that's relevant to bitcoinmarkets: assuming some miners want to accumulate long term, this puts a price floor at ~$2-6k depending on how far off my $4500 is from their costs of mining.


* 3.4GW used for hashing (0.02% of the world's power)  
* equivalent of $8M of US residential electricity per day  
* earning $13.3M a day at $7400  
* equivalent of 2.3M Antminer S9s running constantly   
* that's $4.8B spent on mining chips ($2k per S9)    
* and those chips collectively earn $4.9B a year in mining revenue    

Collectively by revenue, this operation is around the size of EA or Chipotle and the total cost of the chips is like 1/3 of an aircraft carrier. I know it's not exactly TA, but it helps me get some ideas of the sizes of things involved.
My original target was around here but because of this article and how bearish the bounces are I'm just going to keep my shorts open(added a little actually).  
I will just wait until we have total long capitulation before I close them, think thats what is going to be required for any meaningful bounce today. Will probably open a scalp longs at 6.9-7.1k though

I got prematurely stopped out of my other long, so I'm setting loose stops this time.  Hopefully we are close enough to a bottom that I won't get destroyed on this trade, but I'm prepared to ride it out for a while nonetheless.
Some hopium for the bulls, at least there are now some bull divs popping up (1h being the nicest i think). Don't know if it will play out though.
There seems to be a falling wedge triangle here which kindof looks like a bearflag.

Smaller timeframe:   https://www.tradingview.com/x/joxYpFHE

1D: https://www.tradingview.com/x/GOYfQ3j8

The daily volume is rising and were still continuing the descending channel pretty well. It seems to be that we bounced off the daily BB and are currently just consolidating and cooling off the MACD and RSI for another run on the goblintown express. The same applies for ETH, and probably any other shitcoin out there as everything is connected.

ETH Chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/J0J4Jljw (For the purpose of comparing it to BTCUSD descent im using the ETHUSD pair here not the ETHBTC pair)

So i am currently expecting this to continue down and will hold or increase my short from here. Will reevaluate at 7.8K

EDIT: Also seeing that we on mid/high timeframes have crossed down below the ichimoku cloud were in for a bear treat. Although this is by now a lagging indicator.
Are bears running out of bitcoin to sell? All indicators point to exhausted and stripped naked bears. The fact that the majority of btc is lost or held by stubborn hodlers, the market is being moved by quite small players. I sense these 'perma bears' have finally exhausted themselves out and we are about to get into a real bull market soon.
reading some of permabears comments is quite funny, they think its going to dump straight to 6k and they all become millionaires overnight on their shorts 
[deleted]
[deleted]
I realize I'm getting ahead of myself here, but as we inch closer to the log support line, I'm curious what your thoughts are with respect to *how* we reacted to that TL the last 2 times it's been tested.  

At $6k, there was a sharp V bounce, in contrast to the last time when we hung around that line for almost 2 weeks until the "BGD event" sparked the runup to $9990. 

Does that offer any kind of insight as to how that line may hold up in the future?  Or was it just a product of how we approached it?

EDIT: e.g., high-volume, sharp decline at 6k vs. "easing into it" the 2nd time around.

The natural 2018 reddit market cycle of delusional bulls:

3) may/?: bull divs everywhere
4) ???
5) no profit 
Here's the weekly pivot chart that I have that shows 3.2k as the next area of support on the year.  We lost 8.5k again and margin longs continue to build up which is not good for bottoming prospects since 6.4-7.2 was a prior accumulation range that already tested twice.  Further more there is no long term price level where there would be a clear double bottom that we have not already breached.  This is why I was always so insistent we needed to keep above 8.5k.  But instead, with price basically slow bleeding since ATH - margin longs are trying to fuel the next and probably biggest leg down through what is supposed to be the strongest support on the year (S3 - 8.5) since there is no floor until 3.2k.  If longs closed as we approached this level I would be more confident that we would hold the previous range of support.  But we're likely going to continue what's been the slow bleed since ATH until the cascade BRD at some point.

closed short went long at break of 7400,,,we'll see if this was a good move

peace
I think we are a bit oversold and the market has overreacted a bit.   I think we will head back to 8200ish. 
Weak hands are being shaken out. I could swear I've seen this before. My gut tells me that at some point this year we're going back to 20k territory.

Great, good luck. Good luck. I just sat on the computer and I got to open a x10 on bitmex :D
This could develop into another "first week of April". Hovering around the same trendline for days...
200$+ Kimchi premium indicative of anything?
why would retail ever invest in something that keeps crashing every month? they already don't care about BTC anymore , most of my friends think its a ponzi scheme and they don't even check the prices and still think we are at 10k lol 
Stops triggered on my short - but for what I'm not sure. Not impressed so far but I suppose this might play out over a longer timeframe. Options are either to reshort w stops above 7.8 or scalp a long but might as well stay out of position for now. 
Remember the "CFCT decision about ETH security" news that was more "someone mentioned that they may have a meeting sometime int he future"? 

This from Bloomberg is in the same category, old media journalists doesn't understand the  importance of sources and confirmation of information
Let's see if there's a bounce off 7200.

Hitting 7200 should coincide with an RSI of around 20\-25 on the hourly.
Because of the FUD we are not expecting any decent bounces?
Bloomberg: "FUD" with a grain of truth.
!short xbteur close 6300
Does it make sense to put laddered buy orders from 6850 to 7050 in case the capitulation will happen too quickly? 
Isn't it true that manipulation (spoofing and wash trading) create great opportunities for those who aren't spoofed and also works against advantage of expensive high frequency bots? I say "manipulation" is the best source of regulation. 
i started my day with buying back in at 7350, oversold rbi and such

then i read the news about manipulation;
then i read the news about tether and bitfinex;
sold half at break even

yet the market didn't give a fuck and went up;
is this some sort of strength that it's being shown now? or is it just scared tether holders putting their money back in btc?

Taking some minor profits here. Expecting another correction today.   Will jump back in probably later today to try to catch the weekend rebound (hopefully).

> The Justice Department has opened a criminal probe into whether traders are manipulating the price of Bitcoin and other digital currencies, dramatically ratcheting up U.S. scrutiny of red-hot markets that critics say are rife with misconduct, according to four people familiar with the matter.

Looks like this is why we were dumping. The dumping was happening BEFORE the news came out so clearly people knew this was coming out.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-24/bitcoin-manipulation-is-said-to-be-focus-of-u-s-criminal-probe
Institutions are accumulating like crazy OTC(OVER THE COUNTER).

Along with that, I am very bullish that even with this so called FUD. I have a strong feeling this is going to be one insane bull run when it kicks off. Things are brewing behind the scenes and this news from Bloomberg is just perfect for whales to kick off a sell off and purchase more via OTC. Things are going to get very interesting in the next few months. I wouldn't worry too much about all this at the moment. 

EDIT: Regulations and other KYC's are getting in place. This will bring about a ton more money into the market both from individuals and institutions. Coinbase is already preparing for this along with other exchanges. Thus why I say its going to be mega interesting in the following months. On top of that we have the halving to look forward too as well. Its just going to be bat shit crazy. 

Bears butt hurt. Thats fine downvote all you like you like. TA cant save you with your lines.
I repent. I expected BTC to drop straight through 6k due to the major FUD and stated that here. Surprisingly BTC is UP since the news.. what in the h..
volume is starting to pick up too
[deleted]
The fact that the Blooomberg article was published at 7.4k means that possibility of 6k holding is out the window. I'm not touching BTC with a ten foot pole for the time being
2 months calling for sub 7k and now everybody is wetting the bed? I thought you were all tough bears opening 100x shorts.
Anyone else having their Delta app adding a bullshit $1 portfolio?  
Do people think the [BTG scam](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hacker-makes-over-18-million-in-double-spend-attack-on-bitcoin-gold-network/) poses any threat to traders? Article says: "While no user has lost money, the attacks are still dangerous because they might destabilize an exchange's backup funds, or may lead to its insolvency, which in turn may prevent users from withdrawing funds."
sold my ether stack at 601, hope i can buy the dip again. made a nice lil profit already.
[deleted]
[removed]
The dip is finally over. Looks bull now. Rejected 7k sorry bears. 
So many margin longs still, I am skeptical that there will be a true bounce until this is cleared.  Moreover...with so many margin longs still open probably around the price range of 6.4-7.2k of which we are, how will this not tank before it truly gets better?  The only question for me then is at what price will the selling cascade begin to manifest?  At the moment, it seems truly unfathomable but my pivot levels are showing open air since losing 8.5k -- with the next long term opportunity for a support at 3.2k - when this happens exactly, I do not know but these weekly pivots are calculated for the entire year so I imagine it will happen at some point in 2018 and we may have a perfect storm to see this happen sooner rather than later.  I thought 7.4k was unfathomable last week.  I feel I now have to re-examine my assumptions and bias about BTC price movement patterns but I am getting to the point where I will not add to cold storage until we hit 3.2k price - which in my view is a foregone conclusion.  BTC is only good for temporary trades on technical movements until then.  Right now I see BTC as bearish as it has ever been this year, so please be careful.
ok everybody i just bought some, hopefully i can celebrate this weekend that i got the bottom Lol
so there is no way to actually verify whether the article real or just FUD? 
Well just look at that.

That was the big triangle support wasn’t it? 
[deleted]
sad to see BTC die like that , all that selling pressure was so strong during the last weeks , guess now we know why
[removed]
Going long from 7640. Even if we continue falling i think we can get close to 8k as we along this bear flag on the 4hr.

Edit: Bear flag
How I think this will play out, margin longs will continue to increase at an unimaginable rate until ~5k then a cascade of liquidations will take this down through to 3-4k range before stabilizing at the lowest possible support pivot calculated for the year around 3.2k.
I'm loving this shit. Longed 4400 and closed at 4600. Woke up this morning with my 4300 buys filled and just closed those out. These are scalps but I'm keeping certain orders for a longer hold, although I won't enter those here (short 8.4 or long 6.9-7.2) 
Nearing the ~$300B crypto market level where it's far more feasible for influencers/media to move the market via a pump than FUD.

Retail is buying more coins than ever: https://anacoinda.github.io/localbitcoins/all.html

Maybe they haven't got the message that the bubble has popped almost half a year ago?
We didn't take the Bloomberg article into account when predicting our targets (break of $7.8 -> test of $6.3k). We have to adjust our $6.3k target because of this extremely bearish article and, because of it, have re-adjusted it to $4.2k. Should $4.2k not hold, then we expect bitcoin  to drop to $1.4k, with a mere 15% chance of recovering when this target actually hits (meaning; 85% chance of bitcoin dropping to lower 3 digits 100-300$ area).

Bitcoin future doesn't look bright. It is critical $7.2k holds, otherwise, we expect a dump that crypto has never seen before, one from which it most likely won't recover. 

All in all, we have decided to take the words of Warren Buffet, Bill Gates, and the Belfort more seriously. With the FBI investigating manipulation, one should only assume the worst. We believe Bitcoin is in for a prolonged bear market and we are confident there won't be a recovery/bull run for the year to come.
Test
Bullish!
Alright guys there's your buy signal.
Had that happen on a hot July morning. Opened the windows and didn't have time to clean before I left for work. Wife who worked night shift, was welcomed home to a steaming hot house with piles of shit all over the kitchen floor. (yes, suprisingly we are still married) 
I have a related dog shit story. When I was younger I also woke up to a pile of dog shit in my bed room.  Waking up to that smell is one of the worst things.  The difference in my story was that we didn't have a dog.  I was the most confused I had ever been in my life and still very tired so I went into another room and went back to sleep.  Come to find out my mom took in a stray that morning.
I've done that with my alerts/alarms before...very costly mistakes on my part.
Waking up due to the smell of dog shit...lol that’s just too funny :)

Hope the rest of your day goes better

Mike, don't you steal anything
Doesn't look like buyers are very interested in playing the "let's push this to 7.8 only to get dumped on" game while everyone knows the short-term target is 7-7.2 tbh.
They will be facing sell pressure from:

* underwater longs closing

* traders reshorting or adding to their shorts.
I admit, when you first came here I thought “this guy is gonna lose everything” but you’ve turned into a great trader and contribute a lot to this subreddit. Great job. 

Honestly, you’ve outtraded me by far. Wish I made the progress you have. 
Fuck yea, good job man.
Nice bro. Well done. Get yourself something nice to celebrate that day. I recently cashed out all of my initial investment (i entered BTC at 19k LOL, was down like 80% in FIAT value at some point before i discovered this awesome sub and BitMEXico), and am now playing with the house money only. Feelsgoodman. 
fuck ya!! i kind of regret moving my stack to binance cus i cant short. but luckily at this moment im back in ether at 575 ;D
I'm definitely getting trigger-happy on the buy button. I'm being patient though.
the sellers are running out of coins and they will have to load back up, also fear and blood and negative news seem very high
That link is encouraging, thanks
I know I’m not alone in being pretty confused about the panic in this sub. 7500 range was a given and could have been predicted weeks if not months ago (I did so in this sub several times).

It’s strange to see people claiming the sky is falling when BTC is simply revisiting the 12-months long trendline which it has respected thus far on all previous bounces.
Me.
Ah, that's okay, I dont have a Phd so I doubt he'll scam me
Niceeeee~!

(do comments also help?)

Edit: As I already had a post. There's currently a position open by /u/avatarr in the asset "gypsytoy" which now also has a ticker on the top. Though I'm always happy to be up to date on gypsytoys status, don't think it belongs there. 
A+ on the work of this bot. We should get more people on the notifications at some point. Don't know how we'll figure that out though.
Just use this account for a day and you should be good. Will be upvoting all posts from this account, this is good work. Cheers!
I tried to make "big green buttplug" happen a few weeks ago, but it was about as well received as "fetch"
Amen. I saw someone exclaim BGD after a $30 price hike the other day. I can sympathize though because sometimes you don't realize how zoomed in the chart is. 
IMO, candles don't enter BGD territory until you go >3% in 1H, and it really should be more like a 5% threshold. 
Fine MGD.  Medium green dildo.
When a real BGD comes, bears buttholes shall burn and tremble in pain.
There's pretty decent potential for a $150 pump to $7,700 if this doesn't bart first. 

But it feels too early for a full-on reversal.
Only thing giving me pause to jump back in a short is some alts are pumping. I don't really follow them, but saw EOS and LTC getting a second pump just now.
Opened a hedge short to protect my long gains. Will most likely cut the long if we drop below 7.4 again.
the interbank forex markets are also "manipulated" in that banks do larger/lower quotes and whatever. that's just the market marketing along  as usual
lol, don't panic rebuy. Wait it out, you'll be ok.
Let us know when you buy.

thanks for your sacrifice

Lol @ Turkish Lira being an alt-coin. Genuinely made me laugh.

I guess it is a shit-coin though, they don't even have a whitepaper.
Mate, your overinvested thats why you care so much. Take some off the table, don't have your whole net worth in crypto and it's honestly easy as fuck not to care and make better decisions.
Selling 2/3rd of my stack was the best thing I ever did for my stress levels. Even if it admittly it turned out to be near ATH, but at the time I was convinced I was going to miss a 50% runup so I kept a third just in case. Put away some for savings and entered the regular stock market instead to quite some success.

I have a altcoin not in the top 10 I should probably sell off too. Might rebuy crypto in the future but not at the current point. My other regret is not selling 2/3rd of my BCH as well, but at the time the taxation laws of "crypto you got from nowhere" was unclear.
If you aren't in a leveraged position, just get rid of all crypto notifications and go away until the next halvening. You'll either lose the money you have invested \(it's money you can afford to lose, right? right...?\), or come back a lot richer than you are right now. No point sitting around stressing out about it if it's affecting your day to day life and mental state, no money is worth that shit. 
You are about to capitulate which is generally a sign that you shouldn't sell. I'm sorry about your situation. I would suggest waiting for a bounce to sell personally but it's really your call. 
What’s your job ?
Time to go long?
Same boat here, picking up my new, crypto financed, ducati this saturday.
Sold everything that i had on exchanges (40%) two weeks ago, and also kept everything i had on ledger/paper.

Life is much easier now :)
Grats on your terace!
nice, im looking to tether back up around 7.7 after buying the dip
You're still shorting June futures, even with premium gone?
On mobile at the moment so can't post chart but it looks to me like there is a downward resistance line from the 8200 drop, through the peaks at 7940 and 7720 and then the current pump bounced off it almost exactly. Look at the 2hr to see what I mean
>For me, I'm comfortable waiting to short this at around $7900-7950. If we don't get there, I will just wait for another dump with a bull div or two before closing my shorts.

I'm confused reading this
Since you wrote this comment we made a new lower low on price. And if we maintain this level for a couple of hours it looks like bull divs are developing on the 1\-6H charts. Volume is also slowly increasing.

Will you action on your plan to close your short based on the last few hours of development?

Edit: Wanna emphasise that I don't think the bull divs are far from confirmed yet, just something to keep an eye on.
Okex situation is apparently resolved so that could take us to 8k. It would be a nice entry for sure.
I may have this backwards, but if it's a FIB retracement, then isn't it drawn from the ~6400 low to the 10K high and then retraces from there?

When I draw it, the red starts at 0.0 on the top, near 10K.   You seem to have it opposite with the red at the bottom.
I really hate when you try to fil in an amount and then scroll down to place the order it scrolls your amount instead of the page. 
It's so ugly. I can't see that they've added any features except zooming on the chart. 
I find it not that bad... maybe it still needs some personalizable settings
Weak bears? The price has been pushed down from 10k to 7.2k in about 2 weeks. We went from 8.7k to to 7.2k within 3 days. That's pretty determined bears if you ask me :\)
Uhm, still pretty bear if you ask me. Minimal bounce, hasn't crossed any resistance yet, Little volume. If we can sustain or increase here pushing through resistances, then we're in business. 
I'm afraid it will drop in the next 1-2 hours as we are approaching the downtrend line...

There have been surprises in that kind of situation, but not many.
When in doubt, zoom out: https://www.tradingview.com/x/pe32dB8W/

inb4 zoom out to 2014
Zoom out a little and you should have your answer what is much more likely.
So far I feel relaxed knowing if it goes up; my long will come closer to the surface; if it goes down, I have my more than double stack to add into it; and; Not really considering sub $6,000 prices so no plan as of now. 

I think the price we are currently trading is in very close proximity of the bottom from where it will take off for another run, especially given the fact that we would have found our triple bottom in about $1,000 range.
I love your polls.  You bring out the snuggly bear in me.  (and I'm forced to admit it to myself)
[deleted]
It’s getting increasingly tough, in expecting support at 6001 and resistance at 9999
This is fucking fascinating! Please keep posting/sharing these.

It's basically a 5050/coin-flip (maybe some *slight* bearish-bias).
I think we'll go down more before hitting 10k, but it's hard to imagine breaking 6k currently. Ask me again in a month or two and I may reneg :)
Take a screenshot and forward it to the Justice Dept twitter.
This has been happening on the sell side a ton over the past few weeks, but yea this particular example was one of the clearest of it happening on both ends.
Dude wtf is happening 

Edit: over now that was bizarre 
That pump really didnt agree with his stomach lol
Ahahahahahahha
Looks at his lovely lumps 

*my milkshaKes bring all the boys to the yard*
Funniest thing I saw today. Thanks ;)
is this not a H & S ?
It's consensus bro thats why
That made me laugh.
Nicely done. After that initial early close the other day you got back into your short at a pretty good point. 

Got knocked out of my short last night sadly but had incredible gains so can't be too sad.

Thoughts here? I just opened a long on futures at 7.3 - premium being 0 was too tempting and R/R seems good with stops below 7.2, maybe even 7250 (or maybe that's too tight). Hard to say what'll act as support at this point.
Really nice trade once again! 


Would you open a new short again if we hit 7700ish? I am most likely going to do that
Perhaps this decision is too hasty. RSI was well reset last night on medium timeframes, and the Justice dep. news is exactly something that people would take as the legit reason for this fall. Not all people involved in BTC will react as fast as this sub does, so theres bound to be some more falling after the initial sharp candle or two. 

I actually added to my short, but gave up @ breakeven after seeing how 7300 is holding well for now. But definitely keeping my original short from 8300 still open. 

Just saw that you only now discovered the Bloomberg article, so maybe you did not factor that in yet.
Wouldn't it be good to open up a high leverage long just a bit after the test of the triple bottom trend line? So one can get the confirmation that it holds and the trend likely follows to the upside of the daily wedge the following days ?
This actually sounds plausible to me haha
Intriguing.
So you’re predicting a perfectly straight sideways yellow dildo... haha, your nuts! But honestly this may be the direction the market takes! Thanks for the good post! 
Yep that's really dumb idea, that's not clever, deft or shrewd. Just as stupid as borrowing student loans for Bitcoin. 
Not stupid at all and just a calculated risk.  However, stop loss does not always work and always a chance, you will lose all your money if you leave the BTC on an exchange.
i won't be able to add much to the risk conversation, but consider a self directed IRA.  I did one (just recently closed it down) for real estate which i held for 5 years and it worked well.  At least you dont have to worry about time frames and as a bonus you can keep all your gains in the IRA tax deferred or free if it is a Roth.

edit: i thought about moving some of the funds to BTC, but i wont fuck with my retirement $.  Believe me I thought about it, but I don't want to risk eating dog food for a cool million that may never show up. 
I borrowed 30k from my 401k last year, and then when I didn't need it anymore, it made a quick stop in cryptoland before heading home.  Even though I doubled my money in a month, it was a terrible idea and I can't believe I did it in the first place.
Risking retirement money to trade the range for a 2:1 is pretty close to satoshi's vision if you ask me. What happens if the funds get frozen at the wrong time due to AML investigations or something?
Don't mess with your retirement funds.  Even if you mitigate risk, if bitcoin dips, you may be tempted to buy the dip to recover your losses.  This could lead to a chain reaction of gambling and you may lose it all.  Only invest what you can afford to lose they say.   That said, I am a firm believer that bitcoin will moon within the next few years, but even *I* don't risk my retirement funds.
Here's a fun thought: this bubble burst is like the mid 2013 bubble burst, not the 2014 one. To be fair, fundamentally that one was driven by media attention similar to December 2017.

\\#100kEOY #bullish

\(Mostly joking\). Really though, I generally agree. But I think it's always good to keep in mind this is still an emergent asset class so it's not really a surprise if the market does something it hasn't done before, whether that's up, down, or sideways. Obviously that's not ever going to help forecast the price so we do the best with the information we have.
Can I help you come up with a good working TV strategy? I feel like I've made so many iterations and have a good feel for most indicators to come up with one that fits your trading style. PM me, and we can talk about it if you'd like. That RSI strategy simply will not do.
I am nervous that nothing looks or feels right because the Justice Dept could start dropping FUD bombs like China kept doing last year. 1 step forward, 3 steps back. They may end up being pro-BTC, but in the short term, I would not be surprise to see an exchange go down or something else. 

Cannot imagine they would announce something like this w/o having something to go on.

Dunno, black swan shit scares me at this price, last year all the China FUD happened at much lower. 
Bloomberg is the bear MVP today.
>“I, and many others, suspect Tether is being used to effectively counterfeit hundreds of millions of dollars of perceived value, which are being immediately reinvested into Bitcoin,” Tony Arcieri, a software engineer and independent security analyst, said in a Jan. 19 report.


so basically a random guy on the internet. what a scoop

>Friedman LLP, a New York-based auditing firm, was also subpoenaed by the CFTC after Tether hired it last year to assess claims that Tether held enough U.S. dollars, according to a person familiar with the matter.


Again no source or date, this could be like their last fake news article about 3 months old investigations.

Over all, this is (actually this time :D) good for Bitcoin since institutions with friends in the media are getting scared and post this stuff NOW and not 2 years ago
Interesting how all these articles are coming out now. Jeez this game is rigged
That's not news and that's not even the point of the article. Only you can spin up Finex FUD day after day. 
So I'll keep holding my short for now, then? The market behaves irrationally around tether.
Oh goodness, a classic "load the FUD". Interesting that Goldman Sachs now have a crypto trading desk.
Get the F out of tether. 1 tether is not worth $1.
I'm pretty sure ING also stated they did business with Bitfinex.
About time.
missing them c&h days
I'm seeing a firefly doji on the hourly! 
"The investigation is focused on illegal practices that can influence prices -- such as spoofing, or flooding the market with fake orders to trick other traders into buying or selling, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the review is private."

How people can regard this as serious news or something that can have serious effects on the market is beyond me. It happens all the time.... 5 people will get fucked, the other hundreds doing it will stop it or get fucked later, if anything comes from this investigation at all. 

There's always FUD on red days. People need a narrative, the media creates this on purpose, even after the dump to give the impression that the dump was because of it (and to get views because everyone will read it). You see this happening in markets all the time with for example Trump and his timely releases of information about his trade war. 

To where does the CFTC's jurisdiction extend? Most exchanges aren't registered there, and how will they go after international players?
I dont think its significant in any way, unless people make it out to be.
This market always overreacts 
My favorite Bloomberg move today was how they updated their OWN first article, with a reference to the article, **within itself** that the price went down because of the article

>Bitcoin extended its Thursday declines after Bloomberg News reported the investigation, and was down 3 percent to $7,409 as of 9:32 a.m. London time. It’s down more than 20 percent since a May 4 peak.


The government there is exceedingly in favor of crypto there. Makes sense since it's pretty poor. Anything that would bring money in is worth taking notice of and promoting. 
you're right, and thanks for sharing to show the comparison.

Is the move to PR for crypto users largely due to taxes?
Feels like the wife giving a lazy HJ
Weakest reversal of all time!
It feels like "you shall not pass!"
Perhaps volume petering out at the end of.....https://www.tradingview.com/x/7Yo5whBs/
The price is down about 5% on that CFTC news.  That is not blood in the streets.

The news is out four hours ago and the reaction to the news is mostly done.

And the potential for bitcoin 5 years from now has changed for the worst, with many nations banning it since 2014...China and India being the major two...and the EU and USA hasn't done strict bans but have regulated it into something very different than it was 4 years ago.
We have seen Many Many bad news about Bitcoin... and look where we are now.


Just tweet that it's a *witch hunt* and everything will be fine.
People here discount how bad news got us to the price we are at now.  It has happened all year.

And I suspect you trade news if you get in fast enough.  That is the absolute easiest money in trading.  Although with all the insider activity, it is difficult to do that these days.

One of my best trades ever was when Gox went under and I heard the news fairly quickly and shorted.  
just regulation.. investigation

Will be good after all.

You do not like that price is manipulated ... or??






isn't the dump irrational? if people were really scared and rational shouldn't they withdraw their bitcoin and usd (the fastest way being to convert their holdings to crypto)

Edit: Lmao wedge broke down right after I exited

Edit 2: Stops above 7600, depending on how it's looking then I may just move them up to 7800.
No one wants to short 300$ above the log support which has been tested a bunch and held thus far. To me this shows SHORTS then to be slightly smarter than longs, since longs were opening under log ressitance at 11.7k and at  9.9k lol. Although the longs opening in the low 7k will see good profits.

Can you explain what that chart is representing, also how do i find that on tradingview? thanks
max "gain"? Seems risky, no? Why not just DCA throughout the cycles?
Wouldn't the price have had to go much past $7250 for MEX to actually lose on those contracts?
True, it is interesting timing. 
How can we see it if it's hidden
nice catch, i hadn't looked at the 2 hourly.
The market moving against you dread is only slightly less discomforting than existential dread.. (or is it the other way around)?  Give me a bit of that Bearoin, Chew.

Here's a chart that actually makes sense and isn't fueled by hopium](https://imgur.com/raFe4Cx)

We're due to spend a year or two below that line..we're currently right above it.

People expecting a double bubble like 2013 - in my opinion, we had a double bubble in 2017. Don't believe me? Look at alts like Ethereum. Multi-month bull run at the start of the year -> correction -> stability -> 1 month explosion above $1000. Not only that, but the psychology is the same: The beginning of the year put crypto in the limelight, people started hearing about it but took it's potential for granted until the massive runup at the end of the year where everyone FOMO'd at once. Sounds like my experience with 2013
I would turn quite negative when  1 candle closed below the red support line I said for a long time. did not happen yet at least  :D
When would it be invalidated anyway?? 
Unfortunately:

One thing I have learned in my painful career as a gambler is that bragging when you get lucky and win a few trades will plunge you into gloom and unacceptable beatings very soon. It happens every time.

Going 50x short just because of your username
Not that it would change your statement but why did you cut wicks on the bottom right but not anywhere else?

Also, that's not a triangle. That's more arguably a descending wedge.
I still think this mainly has to do with stamp and Gdax being over Bitfinex. If Bitfinex were ahead of them swaps would be ahead 
It hasn't happened in a couple of weeks, I don't think....or at least not in the last several days for sure.
That's not what that means. Shorts always = longs on bitmex because futures are 1:1, its not like spot on finex where longs can outnumber the shorts or vice versa.

Negative funding and futures discount just means bearish sentiment, it's caused by the mark price trading under the index price.
Theres some confidence.  Can you explain why you are so certain 7800 will hold as resistance?  

I’m guessing it’s because the buyers just had their chance to break out right there and they stalled pathetically at 7650?  

But what makes this situation such a “sure thing” for you to double down?  


(I know it isn’t really a sure thing).  But this is the first time I’ve seen you do this, and it must be based on some rock solid analysis and we want to hear it.  
I know you prefer to watch the market behavior, but if you were given a pass to pick any number, what do you think the next bottom is?.. 7k? 6k? 4.5k? Just picking your brain. :-)

Edit: better yet, what did you vote on Sloppy's poll?lol
I think the same, this bounce doesnt inspire confidence in bulls. 

It could be a little squeeze pre dump

Also, what is your current size / leverage of the postition /u/_chewtoy_ ?
We'll never see bitcoin above $7800 again? Damn, I better start looking for a nice bridge to sleep under :(
I panic closed my short when I saw it break 7625 which had been resistance all day, but this is pathetic. Reopening short here. Will give it a few minutes to see if it wants to try to break the bbands on the 15/30/1hr and that's it.
Hopefully everything goes as planned. Read something about a guy that went all in even with borrowed cash and got burned up
How low can we go....criss cross
Seems like they're having severe technical difficulties. Hope they won't have a problem on rolling back trades and stuff.

In my experience, Bitcoin never delivers a single big green candle. It forms bull flag on 5m charts after such a candle and delivers another nominal green candle 15-30 minutes later. It's another story that it could form a BART down 2 hours later. I used to close my red / break-even trades earlier, now if it is right after a 'first' green candle, I let them ride.
Technically, its not a technical bounce. Technical bounce would be a gradual increase in buying activity because of RSI overheating. This was a completely random 2K coins bought in five minutes, so I'd say it was just a pump. Person/persons involved might or might not have considered the RSI as one of their decision factors.
Oh man I'm in the exact scenario as you and have thought about this too. Great question. Maybe get a tablet?
BitFinex's mobile application has great functionality. 
Trading on mobile makes emotional / uninformed trading easier. I'm personally just fine not having a mobile trading option available.
The trading I do is fully auomated - so I use whatever the broker has as an emergency tool, but generally have a web based position overview that my trade systems update.
It could bleed up for the daily close, but I do expect a drop soon. 
A short has quite terrible risk reward here. Around 7k the risk/reward is damn near 0. Better to wait to break below 6800 with conviction and then bet that we paint a lower low and watch it bounce or bleed sub 6k. Short the bounce or draw the line in the sand at 6400 and pull the trigger.

That’s what I’m thinking
Just wondering are you not concerned about FUD articles ? thx
Yesterday : "Ohh no, 7800 fell!!!"

Today: "YAY!! we are at 7500 screw you bears!!"

Hmmm...
Wasn't that dip caused by the news about CFTC looking into fraud?
r/R: Risk over Reward or Reward over Risk. In your case I'd say Reward over Risk, with reward being pretty great, but usually I think the r/R means Risk/Reward ratio so in that case you'd say your r/R is pretty low. I'm not sure really...

edit: why the downvotes? I'm being technical, but can't deny facts.
77~~ is the short term bounce in my opinion, I'm shorting.
Godspeed my benevolent Michael.
Hi Mike, would it not be worth pushing above 7800 as support turned resistance, then seeing if it drops and confirms as support again before longing?

I've been stopped out of my short and am re\-assessing position.
Is 1mm $1 million. Just curious, slightly new Here.
Long $1mm @ $9277. Short $1M in the 8000s. Now long once again.

Gotta love it.
My interpretation is that BTC is trying to get back into *this* channel it broke out of:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/9pWodSt6/
Oops, posted something similar about the same time. It SHOULD breakout based on the momentum and direction.. (my guess)
"Just to see how it'd feel.."
Need to post this poll in r/CryptoCurrency daily. When we get 95&#37; bearish votes it will be time to go long :\)
10k not before next yr
ATH downtrend resistance is around 6.8 now. Should be around 6k in around two weeks. I'd say we gonna test it before it goes that low.
Not trading this one but I’d bet $5999 or at least a test of $6000s before we break above $10k.
Drop to 6.8-6.9, back to 8 then up and out of the resistance and over the 10k rainbow.  Love how bearish the poll is, good stuff.
On that note, going to close a bit of my short.

I hope you added earlier when I made the post 
I'm betting on a bit of a bounce here due to the little lower bottom formation that formed over the past couple of hours. NORMALLY this is followed by a decent bounce and an end of the dump cycle. 

Don't think we'll bounce much higher than we did last night to around 7700, but at least it will provide a bit of respite.  
Send this info to the Justice Department ASAP.
Most likely just to spam the engine
Where was your stop loss? It is too early to say, but maybe it is good you got stopped.
Use lower leverage and be a little more patient. I only set stops at a gain and add sometimes if things don't go my way at first. It works pretty well. Gains are smaller but more frequent. By setting a stop-loss you're setting yourself up for a loss because a big candle or wick in the wrong direction takes you out. And big candles in either direction are guaranteed in this market.
I'm having a hard time getting used to it and accidentally double posted orders that got filled this morning. Little new features, some weird features that make no sense, though it might be a bit faster than GDAX was.

overall grade?: 4/10 - it's still ass.
haven't traded on it but I switched over bc GDAX kept on lagging. i like the added feature that you can finally zoom out on the chart. Otherwise not much difference. Looks like they are getting prepared to add more coins.
My gripe is that you can only look at the order book OR the transaction history. We used to be able to see both at the same time.
Migration is on the 29th June.

I seriously can't notice any difference, other than minor UI changes.
It looks kinda retro to me.

They kept all the good and the bad, bugs included.
June 29th the switch happens. I like it so far. No major differences really just slightly different design. 
Pretty much the same
This is actually good for bitcoin (tm)
I find it funny that they still have doubts if bitcoin is being manipulated.
> The illicit tactics that the Justice Department is looking into include spoofing and wash trading -- forms of cheating that regulators have spent years trying to root out of futures and equities markets, the people said.

RIP Spoofy.

Bloomberg even mentions it lol:

> Last year, a blogger flagged the actions of “Spoofy,” a nickname for a trader or group of traders that have allegedly placed $1 million orders without executing them.
Don't see this as fud at all.

Edit: Fuck i hate bloomberg. Publishing a shitty 2 paragraph article while bitcoin is on the brink of crashing. The irony of bloomberg publishing an article about manipulation ahh.
"Developing" . . really no story to print at this time. Very timely for Bloomberg.
"according to four people familiar with the matter."
Huh, interesting. Not really FUD, just not particularly good news. Although this really shouldn't come as much of a shock to anyone. 
> A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment and CFTC officials didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Complete speculation. 
I see it updated. No press release at Dept. of Justice yet.
Reminiscent of the UpBit allegations that proved false.

It'll be interesting to see how this plays out.

Does that state encourage us to use DEX?
yep hodling strong here, will reconsider past 7650
Closed my hedge from 7.6 at 7.3, rehedged at 7.5.
Falling wedge in the making? https://www.tradingview.com/x/8lyAXd2f/
sell the bounce or not to sell the bounce. This is the question now..
Where do you put your stops?
My scalp-turned-great entry from 7620 hit the stop loss while I was showering, could've been more but not gonna complain about profits.

I'm not gonna be able to babysit this for a few hours or even check charts. But I'm sticking to the plan, setting SL way high and letting this ride. It is what it is, I'm already in profit from the scalps. 

My body is ready for all the stress of watching that unrealized PNL disappear.
Good call on holding your larger short against everything. I got stopped out on my shorts last night so missed the drop to 8.3, but opened a cheeky long on futures. Now I have the predicament of cutting it here or not. I'd open a hedge short on swaps but the funding situation is not attractive. 
be sure you have $$ .. to cover
Was pretty obvious, after funding rates already switched to negative. People are finally jumping on the short train. When it gets to a discount, i will close my short (just a hedge short, but profit is profit i guess).
My crypto wealth got hurt like nearly every one as well but that’s why it was from the start a small portion of my wealth so i can stay wealthy

But the maximalists can always find solace by saying they still own the same number of coins....
That looks a bit rushed imo... Good luck
You'll likely know very soon if this was a good entry or not. :)

You know I'm pulling for you (and me).
Sauce?

Edit: Double spending and 51% attack. Another reason not to dip your toes in shit coins.
One more reason to root for Bitcoin. The network of miners is so large, that this kind of attack will be highly unlikely to nearly impossible there.

Not so sure about most altcoins.
Another reason for exchanges to not list shitcoins.
link?
this is what happens when u say u will change algorithms against asics. u do not do that or your coin will be destroyed .. do u understand ?? capiche ?? /s
> It also raises questions on how decentralized exchanges would handle this. Anyone have any thoughts on it?

A true decentralized exchange would not have custodial control over the coins. So in a double spend attack, the victims would directly be the users. 
I swear, every - single - time this sub calls for 3-4k it's time to go long. Low lev, very large SL in case of last leg down but it works every time.

That's called inverted greed and is as delusional as 100k this year.
Some people here are completely full of shit. They cry wolf for months and when it comes they shit themselves.
I was one of the fools who was calling for 4k when we were at 6.5k, I learned my lesson. You know we're close to the bottom with this kind of behavior.  We just need short to pile up again. But I don't think we'll have a short infused BGD this time, the memory of the short squeeze is too fresh.
No offense but aren't you constantly making incorrect predictions along the lines of "I honestly can't see this going below 8.2K"? Seems like you are almost always wrong when it comes to speculating on what the market is going to do.

5K or 3K are very real possibilities. If 6K breaks, 5K is the next stop and that support is not all that strong. Stronger support is found at 3K and even *that* is not all that established. 

Don't be naive.
The correlation with trading volume and comments on this thread is bizarre. 

Do agree, there's much more noise now than a week ago.
I've got to say, I really don't like you, but lately you've been actually acting ok and posting non retarded things, which is nice
I rarely talk down on people but this guy and self referring 3rd person is cancer lol
It's a cesspool right now.  There's 3-4 people I read and only check 2-3 times a day recently.  Love jokes but theres not even much content anymore.  What poses as content is, as you say, some ridiculous post about 11k or 3k in a week.  
Don't go I enjoy your valid input u/L14dy
that's why  he is a .... Dud....
Useless
You are the one who said people were morons for "panic selling" at $8600 a few days ago.

$3200 is not extremely unlikely, but it's a matter of calculating probabilities. I don't know or care what the odds are of it going to that price, but I know that people who predict it (or $10K) are not stupid.
Is kraken's margin pool refilled? I'm always afraid of closing a position to reopen it higher (or lower) because i'm not sure if it will be possible to actually open it again.
If we keep the downwards momentum it would provide a good spring to pop up from, but I think it will only manifest if we get a good capitulation wick on really high volume, otherwise the mediocre price movement will persist. 

Edit: LTC is on the verge of falling out of its triangle, whilst not really being a market influencer, could bode poorly if its a precursor for BTC. 
This is what I think will happen. Might bounce a bit sooner too at around $7k
What does bgd mean?
My guess? Lack of significant dump from east coast on learning of manipulation investigation.

Or solar flares. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
People have been looking for a bottom for three days and everybody is ready on the trigger

> Unexpected

or not...


you gypsy witch
Seems to have lots of resistance and the green candle got smoked. 
Hm, the first resistance I see in my charts on the way up, is a little above $7700.
Maybe it's just my bias (although I went hella long this morning!), but as many here have noted, seems like a good as any spot for anyone not in a position to open a short here, several resistance lines above slanting down as we go along. Not sure if a big pump would necessarily break them. This morning's seemed to encounter a fair bit of resistance as well.
Yeah... this thing doesn't seem to breaking down quite the way it should. The hell is going on right now? Just makes me want to invalidate the whole thing. I guess we're sort of hugging the descending line? A slow bleed would be maddening. 
Bet u a bux its gonna be a doji.
Sometimes I can't tell if TA is useful or just tea leaf reading. You're seeing an ascending triangle, but all I saw today was the left side of bart's head. Been waiting for the other side to draw down.

Can't wait till we have bart TA, where we go over the formation, if the ear will be drawn or not, and what that means for the future of humanity =)
The second one could play out as an ascending triangle but that first one is pretty clearly a bear flag to me.
I've been keeping an eye on the longs/shorts, and the ratio is becoming slightly more balanced. As expected, longs are taking the bounce to close their position, and shorts are opening up there, making the odds of a squeeze much lower.

Though it's premature to say, we could be oscillating here for a couple of days in 6500 style to balance out and then choose whether we want to go up or down. 

What happens below 7k? We'll officially be back in goblin town again, however we might only momentarily be there. I expect the lower trendline to be SOMEWHAT defended as it's decent r/r for a long + good to close a short. Whether or not we'll stay above we will see, but if we go below I think we might find some support in the lower 6k and then 5.5k. Assuming substantial buying pressure there any lower will take some time to play out in the form of a slow-bleed. 
gotta hodl til that capitulation wick 
See if 7200 gives you a technical bounce, if it doesn't then anytime really.
Yeah 7800. :\-D

I missed it as I was in a meeting though!

A long from around just above 7200 might not be a bad shout for a scalp.
Well the decline is actually getting faster now, so anywhere here could be a pretty good spot. Or do you see any signs of this slowing down?
there's capitulation posts coming out now. I suspect the bounce is in after another leg down but could be here 
No. Capitulation will be far more aggressive. Like it was early February.
not even close to capitulation yet. US needs to wake up first and longs need to close
https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/EURUSD=X/

EUR/USD changed about 6% last month
EUR / USD is like 5&#37; down since then, that's probably the main reason charts don't quite line up. 
Hmm, I think we're now finding support due to technical indicators being oversold. If we took a bigger breather after yesterday we would've pushed down harder than we are now. 

I'd say the channel of the second chart will be interesting to watch if we can break back into that channel. Right now we're going down nearly parabolically, which is normally also unsustainable. 

I'm not sure about the horizontal supports/resistances. Some people have been arguing they've been more important on this descent, but I'm not really seeing it. 

I just noticed that the log resistance from ATH is currently intersecting with the lower support of our two lows (lower support of the pennant). Would really be something if we went all the way down to test that thing as support again....  
Didn't EUR tank recently? so btc/eur is going to be higher

what is % of stack if liquidated?
This is where it becomes difficult to be objective. 

If you would enter a short here, cut it loose.

If you would enter a long here, ride it out and place stops as if you were opening a new position.

You need to forget about gains/losses to date and make every decision on its own merit. 

I was in your situation last week, short full stack at 8100 with liquidation at 8600.  I knew it was rising on poor volume and would drop back down so I bought the dips (remember I was short) to protect the short and raised liquidation to 8850 which I thought was a highly unlikely perch for price to reach. 

I suggest not using new money to protect, rather shorting some of your stack during bounces to keep liq below 6k. It should at least bounce one more time before finally dropping under.

No new money, use current position to protect. 
Other than the fact that you done goofed, your best bet is to draw a line in the sand and determine where you cut this loose.

I would say that if 6800 doesn’t hold, we are almost guaranteed to go sub 6k.

But why cut it loose at 6800 if you’re gettin liquified at 6100. Maybe just set market stops at 6200 and pray for the best
Don't assume that $6K is going to hold the price. Adding margin on the way down can fuck you more in the end. The market looks pretty shitty right now and a bounce would probably not go back up to $8500.
I was thinking low $3000's if $7000 doesn't hold. https://i.imgur.com/aLoXrrv.png

Big money could and may just wait till their favorite coin gets a fiat pairing so they can avoid buying BTC all together. 
We believe a break below $7.2k, which we are only mere tens of dollars separated from, will guarantee test of $6.3k, which we believe will be broken. In that case, we expect $4.2k to be the next target. In short; bitcoin won't trend upwards for the coming 12 months. We believe $8.4k+, where you open your long, will not be seen before August 2019.
>Is there something you can learn to get better at trading? I always seem to fomo and think the price will go up but then always lose 5% or something every time

I suggest trading on larger timeframes, lower leverage. Read about TA, and pay attention to market sentiment. 
#PATIENCE 
Trade *very* small amounts for many months.  It'll sting when you get a "big" win and it doesn't amount to anything.  In those cases don't get overconfident and increase your stakes yet.  Wait to be profitable over I'd say a 2 month period of time before using real stakes.  Accept that you won't be able to profit off of the current trend.  Don't worry, this never ends.

And read this sub daily :)


experience is best teacher honestly, it's just that most lose too much and will be out of the game before they get a chance to learn what they need to be successful in the long run.  This is why most people invest and hold for long term, because most people are awful traders and will not be able to stomach drawdowns.
A) at peaks and bottoms do the opposite of what you feel like doing. Sell only on green candles and buy only on big red candles. Seems easy but so tough. 

B) go to cryptowatch and use their default ema (the lines that are already there) and use those as guides if you really don’t know what to do). Also add keltner channel or bbands. Usually if a move touches or goes passed it, it will usually come back down a bit. These are the times to sell or unload some. You will also find much more liquidity if you do it properly. 
dont over trade.
Take screen shots of your trades bro, that way you know what you did wrong or right. 
Trust me when I say use stop losses, and triple check that you have actually set the stop loss before walking away, I speak from bad experience!! 
Meantime you research how to trade better switch to paper trading immediately.
RSI had to cool off...  we will never find the bottom in a single drop. It takes time.
It's not a double bottom. We haven't breached resistance around 7.8k. Even so way too short of a timeframe in my opinion. At least have like  three days between the bottoms before something can truly be called double bottom. Looks way more like horizontal support. HVN in that area so that was to be expected I guess. Also RSI was low as hell. It had to bounce between 7.1k and 7.3k to avoid a new historical low on the 4h IIRC. Or at least had to go sideways.
You can see both sides of order books. Hover your mouse over the order book and toggle it and you can adjust.
It definitely needs work. Right now it's just a clunkier version of GDAX. I have to go full screen width to see trade history, I have to scroll down to hit the submit order button on a limit order, it's not as quick to jump to the different markets... I'm hating it so far.
GDAX is the absolute worst on tablets, it never shows the charts (price or order book), even though it will on a phone with a similar or even smaller resolution.  At least on Coinbase Pro you get enough of a chart that you can see like, 5 or 6 candles.
Was weighing this in my mind as well, but IMO I don't think a few 1-3% scalps would be worth risking missing the big move up, when it comes. Just my opinion
I was thinking this myself. 7.3-7.7 range.
I'm seeing this too (the hideous purple line):

https://www.tradingview.com/x/5KT9l18t/

The descending neckline is perhaps not ideal from long position's perspective though..
This is like a textbook return to the mean 
Sentiments horrible right now. Everyone’s expecting a bounce, markets will probably surprise and do the exact opposite, squeezing longs.
Agree on the relevance of this line. We have seen on a number of past occasions that lines on both scales are considered by the market.
buy high, sell low, my friend

How do you make 10% profit on a long position when the price drops 7%?  The bounce off the lows have only been 1%.  So did you buy right at the low with very high leverage?
I did the exact same thing.  Worked out OK for me too , but scared the shit out of me.

Ended up with a pretty big position open, way over what i would want to trade counter trend with. Closed out now!

[deleted]
Agreed, though I’m still waiting for panic to set in. In April, futures were trading at $100-$200 under spot before the reversal happened, and everybody was trying to short it into the ground. I wouldn’t be surprised if we are near the bottom with futures premiums dropping, but it seems almost too easy for this to be the bottom. Everyone seems to be congratulating themselves at predicting where the bottom would be weeks ago, and lots of margin longs are open waiting for the reversal to appear. Once everyone is convinced this will never stop going up/down is the time to start going against the trend in my opinion, though I’m willing to be proven wrong.

I'm by no means an expert on this, but how is it exactly bullish though? It means, among other things, banks can invest in their own interest and against the interests of their clients.

I can also see this unfolding as: sell crypto to clients, then short the hell out of it(?)

looks like it
You and the rest of the market, most likely.
You should post a link in the daily to a separate post. That way, it won’t clutter up the daily and people who only read the daily will see it. 
Hi /u/houseme , pretty nice post but probably better for a separate ~~post~~ thread? This is way too big for the daily. Cheers!
Useful, but definitely not the place for this. 

Possibly make a thread in the Subreddit and post this.

Thanks! 
This isn't where this should go. Use the daily alt discussion thread.

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8lpsvd/altcoin_discussion_thursday_may_24_2018/
I would post this in the alt thread. I hope /u/jarederaj will let this one slide without a warning. This is genuinely helpful but just doesn't belong in the daily. I mean if chad isn't banned yet you shouldn't be either.
I'm still just watching: https://www.tradingview.com/x/1MEfjbak/


It seems like this has happened a lot lately where the last wick up goes above the channel before the retrace
Exact same situation here. $1 away. But it's not over yet. Part of me wants to close here to be safe. 
I'm not going to pretend I know how to do this profiting from the market well, but holding means holding exactly when it's hardest to hold, because there's a good chance that's the bottom.    If you aren't strict with yourself emotion will get the better of you and you will be played. Not saying this is better than being a good trader, but it is better than being a bad trader.
As soon as this will start look inaccurate, another 1 out of millions of charts out there will take its place and be accurate.

LE: Not saying it's not impressive, at least until now. But i don't expect to continue playing exactly as he mentions.

Asking for a friend.....
+0.60% 24h price

Clearly a breakout! /s
Nothing broke. How many short adds at 7590 is BTC going to give me? Sheesh

https://www.tradingview.com/x/QY3J9VBF/

edit: actually it was 7580. 7595 was a couple hours back
ain't a fakeout until i sell hahaha.
its at 7400
Source?
What made you switch your stance on this being a drawn out bear market vs it being a moderately severe correction? Just curious. I kinda noticed it happened after you came back from your ban, you were generally not very receptive to the idea before that. What changed your mind?
I’ll counter with a drop to 7k’ish, bottom of the big triangle then bounce to 13k.
Better than longing right now, I can tell you that 
There's pretty solid R/R here. Even more so than earlier, as our overhead resistance is just above: https://www.tradingview.com/x/t41xJy9C/
Don't.

Edit: told ya
real advice, perhaps wait for the 4 hourly candle to close. also b bands are your friend
Hello support turned resistance? https://www.tradingview.com/x/rj2EHzjF/
Hoping for an identical movement as last night seems like pushing my luck. Somehow feels better to be sitting out and potentially losing profit rather than rushing back in and potentially managing an underwater short for the next few days.

We did make a new low, but RSI refused to go as low as last time, perhaps indicating that there was less power in the decline.

Tomorrow will tell if we have made a higher high.

Edit: another two things to note here, alts have rebounded with a vengeance, and trading after the last drop has actually been quite active, compared to past few days.
Stops?
Bro, you keep killing it. This should be illegal or something.
RIP to ur shorts
We don't need to do shit. You know who does though? ... all the bears that have been selling/shorting the last couple of days.
Nah man, US .gov can always hit 'em with the "sponsoring state terrorism" or "danger to national security" angle.
Some lawyers obviously think differently because the regulators wouldn’t move if they thought there is no case
There are laws for everything.  There's a book called "Three Felonies a Day" about how everyone commits these. So they can just bend and twist some existing laws and nail their enemies for whatever they want.  And crypto exchanges are the enemy.

But there really is rampant manipulation in crypto markets, so if they can discourage some of it, that will probably be good for traders...probably.
Regulation is typically formed as a response to some events. An investigation uncovers those events, not only to discover illegal behavior. 
Spot on in my opinion. Expecting break out to the upside, and that double bottom to be very uncertain looking and chop city.
the sellers volume is really scary
Things can look too cheap. \(even if they aren't\)
>People escaping Bitcoin and Ethereum into alts?

Just keep pressing the button until your order goes through.
and on bfx a series of 12.5 stacked every 10 cents in price.
The highs aren’t convincing to me. I think a big drop will be incoming 
I've already sold. Waiting to buy.
I sold too low earlier while trying to scalp and got caught out. Then I bought back in too soon on this drop. Hate when I do that. Can't complain, though; I still gained a bit, despite my bad moves.
Who is buying and sell Higher?
Not that I'm advising selling here \(I'm holding\) but I mean selling the china fud much later than minutes later would have been a good move \(and in many other instances..\)

2k daily candle? :-)
maybe its better like this.
15 min isn't bad for entries / exit, stoch rsi is quite helpful when things are quiet
Still too soon to call it *the* bottom in my opinion.

It looks like we're ranging inside a pretty big symmetrical triangle right now, so higher lows and lower highs are to be expected.
Way too confident, this kind of thinking is what will get us a capitulation wick.

people who think like this think they have strong hands until they end up selling the bottom because they never considered it a possibility 
this is the part where delusional bulls go long and get rekt on the final dump under 7k in 24-48 hours
Did you just say ...”higher low”
if bears got a 8k+ entry they can relax until next year
6000, 6500 now 7200?
> So the question, is BTC becoming an investment choice in uncertain times like gold?

Simply put, definitely not. BTC has fallen over 25% in the past 2.5 weeks. That is not an investment choice that is attractive during uncertain times. Technically, it's not even really an investment, it's just speculation. 
The pump happened like 30 minutes before the announcement no? I've noticed that Bitcoin and Crypto has much more of a correlation to SP500 than anything else, just that BTC is a lot more bearish   
FYI SP500 went down on open so I'm saying that 'stopped' the pump
Ah and I thought Europe finally did something that caused speculators to believe in the EUR again. Instead USD just fell. #SAD
I suggest talking to someone who has experienced hyperinflation before and asking them what they would do if they had the opportunity to buy bitcoin. Obviously it’s not the perfect ideal choice, but people in desperate situations don’t have the luxury that people in the first world do in terms of investment choices. Currencies that go through hyperinflation rarely recover. Bitcoin usually does... 

Edit: Also, remember that for people in this kind of situation, converting rapidly devaluing currency into bitcoin isn’t about making sick gainz, it’s about reducing losses in purchasing power.
Maybe just putting a toe into the water as seen by some nation states over the past few months. But when you figure just how massive that market is, even a small percent gains over the next few years will be interesting to say the least. 
even tho this sub is probably the best its still full of confirmation biases 
"capitulation" 

LoL what capitulation?  
We don't need blood, we need buyers.
Nobody's capitulating though. 

Finex longs still far outweigh shorts, and longs are increasing as price declines, while shorts are decreasing.

There actually haven't really been that many "capitulation" events in bitcoin's history. 

The last significant one was the drop from $300 to $160. 
1) no, not nearly enough.  We are in the “cheap coins” phase.  Plenty of hodlers are still increasing their stacks.  It’s capitulation when the  so called “hodlers” lose their faith, sell their coins at a loss and find out their hands weren’t really all that strong in the first place.  BTC will be forgotten in the news.  The number of comments in this thread will plummet.

2). Then there will be quiet for months or even years as smart money gets back into the markets.  But for now, we will keep the volatility.
I dont think so, I think we need a proper blow off bottom in order to reset the market. I'm thinking 3/4k
Nobody knows how much blood in the street is enough sacrifice. Personally I'd like to see us break down into uncharted territory to feel safe. 

But passing  time will also bring confidence into this market.

As more and more participants get indoctrinated with bubble trading wisdom from veterans who already lost their virginity in one of the 4 prior bubbles, I tend to believe the market has to find other ways to fuck the people.

Thinking outside the box - one way is, to fuck "the people" not invested in crypto at all + fiat inflation.
People aren't going to be as willing to invest right after a bubble like we just had, it's going to take time for the market to recover and come back to where we were. So unless you want to trade chop in a downwards trend then you're better off just taking your money out and waiting until the price is low enough for you to buy in.
I think we're nowhere near another bull run and there really hasn't been any capitulation. Just look at this thread. Almost everyone is long.
I think all we need is the asshole who keeps stacking the books at $7500s and keeps popping 50-60 BTC sell walls in a desperate attempt to close his short lower to go away.  It wouldn't exactly be a rocket booster but it would definitely be a good start.
I don’t believe in this “ higher low “ indicator on 4H. 

2 days ago you posted [this ](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ky3fx/comment/dzcq87y?st=JHL1BYJD&sh=8bed9035) 

Pretty much an identical post, but now just at a different price point, we were in the mid 8’s then. 
The problem is you've been saying this for the past two weeks ...or others here have.
Longs to shorts ratio is currently around 3.2 : 1.9
Any real data behind your statement? Or just assumptions?
Waiting a little more could give you a better entry. 
How reliable is it? I mean is it possible that it will bend back?
This sub is mainly being taken for a ride by the market. 

Everyone bullish at $9k. Wow what a  surprise. 

Everyone bearish at $7.5k. Wow so surprised again

Most people here have 0 idea what the fuck is going on and their opinions change accordingly. I can't blame them 
Although I'm a permabull, I disagree.

All perspectives are needed for the full picture.
Not "perma" anything...when I look at the charts and they look bearish, I am a bear. There is no "team" bull or bear.

peace
You have to realize that not everyone talks about his position all the time. I've been short for weeks and have been bearish all this time but I'm now long, closed all my shorts and bought my favorite shitcoins again. Many expected 7.2k to be the bottom, myself included. I started to doubt that because everyone was anticipating it. We got there after a pretty serious dump. And suddenly everyone has forgotten about it. Good place for a 'reversal' towards 8xxx. It places us right in the middle of the triangle, with major cycles about to turn. Daily RSI is almost oversold, if the market wants to break the absolute lows, we need to cool off first.  

There are many short/long term permabulls on this sub, but I doubt there are that many permabears.  Most bears on this sub are long term permabulls.
Gotta disagree with you, Permabear keeps people grounded and questioning. Perma bull tells you your investment is going to 100x and that when you short you personally are stealing peoples money (ive had that one so many times).
Might this be related to the Bitcoin-Gold hack where 18 million dollars worth was double spent off some exchanges?
I think you're good, I'm in the same boat and not sweating. I'm gona exit at and just above 7 and probably enter into a long. We will see a bounce here somewhere and it should be pretty aggressive. I'm picking 7, and expecting price to be back up into the 8's soon after. I'm leaning towards thinking it will keep going up after but I'm happy with w/e. Thanks btc.
We bottomed out on Feb 6 and April 1. That same support line extended out is now at 68xx. If we continue dropping that is a very likely place it will hold. No guarantee of course.
Though anything can happen, I'd say selling right now is really not optimal. Most indicators oversold including the daily, and we're starting to get pretty close to the lower support of the major pennant, where at least a meager bounce is expected.

You'll have to make the decision yourself, but I'd advise to wait until at least a retest of 7500 to see if we'll pop through it. 
Long term holder and now you are worried after 1 month? 
You either have too much money in or are not long term holder.
As long as you got enough cash/income to pay the bills for 3-6 months, wait it out. 30% fiat is fine. If your invest is keeping you up at night, sell a little out gradually. Don't sweat it if you don't need to.

With hashrate changing so often as you mention, usually changing upwards (and quite significantly at that), shouldn't you also factor in buying hardware to keep up with competition

Also, have you factored in the plugged in energy required to cool 31 exahashs?

I think most large mining operations are running on electricity costs of 4 to 5 cents / kWh so you’ll need to adjust your figures somewhat.

Wait for the daily RSI to be oversold before considering buying anything in this market tbh
Were is your liq? Weren't you long from something like 8.4k? I would honestly think about closing that one on a potential next leg up and reevaluate the situation...i mean it all depends on your leverage here.
Agreed. Wouldn’t even consider opening a long anytime soon. Some big players are going to exit and chill until they find out what this means.

sadly. that is what happen now. sure it is not straight to 6k. slowly until the last blood of your kind has been shed. then we bounce.
I just want to collect discounted bags as the emotional run for the exits.
If you didn't intend to enter and its at profit, i'd exit. Even if it was at loss itd probably be best to exit
News about justice dept opening investigation into btc price manipulators got me shook. How many big players will this news scare off? I’m thinking a good bit. 
Hmm, I still think we'll see a bit of a bounce, but I just saw a big spike in longs opening up again, though the ratio has improved slightly compared to yesterday. 

could go both ways, but the dumps should become slower as we go down. you might want to ladder closing positions so you lock in some profit and see how far it climbs? 
Right I did some quick math. 

Drop 1 (v-shape) --> 24hrs <$7000

Drop 2 (pre-BGD) --> 13.5 days <$7000

Expected --> 175.5 days <$7000 --> which is about 5 months.

Good luck!
For clarity’s sake, we didn’t bounce straight back up in February. It wasn’t an immediate aggressive bounce. Most of the aggressive selling occurred several hours before. The price dipped gently below 6k and drifted back over it a couple of times. Then a couple of hours later there was a BGD to set off the temporary recovery.

all the "weak hands" sold at 20K lol 
All the newbs I know irl either sold already or are bag holding ripple on binance accounts
Weak hands is just a term for someone smarter than you who isn't bag holding as the price continues to drop.
Enough with the weak hands narrative. Weak hands are long gone, they sold a long time ago. It's understandable that you are angry and scared, but don't blame it on weak hands. Admit that you bought a highly speculative asset that can be worth a lot more in the future, but can go to 0 too if it fails to be adopted.

Same as me. My current thoughts:

1. If we push above 7800, then drop down to confirm it as support, open a long.
2. If we push up to 7800, then are rejected 2\-3 times to confirm resistance, open a short.
3. If we drop back to 7650, then bounce but fail to break 7700, open a short.

Well it's unnamed sources so we don't know how serious this is. Remember when the WSJ had unnamed sources say that the SEC was meeting to discuss if ethereum was a security? And then it was a bit nothing-burger that date... so we don't really know anything and even if they are starting to look into it could be a year before anything actionable.
The market usually doesn't react to news at all. It's only an illusion. Many people see strong movements and then search for news to explain it. But there is no causality.

Bought yesterday. Will buy again if it dips again. Thinking about entering a small short here just for fun.
No, we are dumping cause bubble popped, its natural market cycle, stop being delusional. 
remember bloomberg and bitfinex? they are the fake news site of crypto
So, cracking down on shady behaviour in exchanges is considered a bad thing? I would welcome to get rid of manipulation.
Cannot have anything to do with longs opened at 7.4-7.5 seing that it's going nowhere with no volume. Im-po-ssi-ble.
Still we were rejected at 9960 on May 5/6 and THAT started the swing down, don't forget that. 
So Four people can Screw... and put Crypto back Multi Mil $. in a few minutes.... Hmmm Interesting.


I find it hilarious, how MSM, and most of the people have always the need to find excuses or reasons why the price dumps. If only looking at the charts you can see it all. The bubble burst . We were highly  overleveraged and overhyped. Its time to reset! get rid of the dumb money, and start over. Even if we have to retest the last ATH at 1.3 k. Institutional money know how to read this better than retail investors and at these levels is not where the smart money will enter. We are way overpriced for that. 
> we have the halving to look forward

28 May 2020 meh...
Not yet they aren't. Give it 4-12 months. I've got amigos who work in institutional asset management.
Not sure why you are getting downvoted. Don't know anything about 'institutions' accumulating, but OTC desks struggling to find enough sellers to meet the demand has been a recurring theme for a while now. I assume it's not in their interest to start buying up supply off retail exchanges, if anything they are probably more interested in keeping prices suppressed as long as possible while the buyer demand remains high (as prices getting higher would likely see lower big buyer interest), which would explain why they might not be able to fill all the buys quickly, but yeah.

Heck if you don't believe this go ask circletrading or whatever for a price quote and a timeframe to fill a 5 or 6 figure btc block.
Institutions buy low. They may already have bought in heavily back last year. Just sayin.

What news?
This bart pump is with spike volume and its decreasing which isnt good for a breakout.
I really don’t like people like you. 
I'm naturally bearish, but how can you possibly come to that conclusion?
Who exactly are you taunting here? Bears are happy right now. Bulls are in disbelief and shambles 

Not sure who your comment is aimed at. are you trying to give bulls a kick in the ass to cheer them up? 
Who's wetting whose bed?

Edit: nvm. bed is soaked.
No. 18 mio. is peanuts for exchanges.
What made you wait till 600 to sell? We had 800 and 700 weeks ago.
long term holders (myself included) have seen this cycle time and time again, this is nothing new. The last time bitcoin 'lost hope' and "was boring" was back when it went from 1200 to 150-200 and flat-lined for months. I'm not a trader and held for 5yrs, I wasn't selling at 25k cad I sure as fuck ain't selling at 8-10k
Ehm, hodlers hold. That's where the name is coming from...
yep crypto is dead. Pack it up and head home.
I (hodler) cashed out enough in the 16 - 20k range to keep me going for a few years. I see no reason to cash out any more at these levels.

This is true for me. I cashed out a couple days ago at 7900. being that I am not a daytrader and looking for LT entry, I am just sitting on my hands right now until I see a positive trend in the market. the low volume has been worrisome. last time I was a no coiner I was fomoing like crazy. this time not so much. 

The market makes me change my mind often so I may feel very different in the near future but right now I feel like the market is about to tank worse than Jan-Feb and the R/R is not worth it for me. I'm also a degenerate who puts in way more than I'm willing to lose.

For those of you that remember /u/yolotrades, this is kinda funny. He cashed out (half I think?) at about this price in November in fear that all the hodlers where going to cash out at the moon price of $10K and he was close enough to his goal. 

Wow how 6 months and a market cycle can change perspective on price.

Strange, but I actually agree with you this time :\)

Edit: holding my short until 7,550.
Would wait with any decisions until 7700 holds. 
It looks more like a regrouping before another push down. I am still waiting.
We shall see. 
You're already almost $300 above the "bottom" ?
doesn't really matter from trading perspective. Whether real or not people are likely to take it poorly in the short term
it is real
Yes you must travel to CFTC headquaters and interrogate all employees or otherwise you apparently won't be able to "verify" it.
The walls on Bitmex are huge on the sell side in comparison...

It's xbtusd
short ~200 from it
I've definitely seen it in the other direction too, but especially a little dip prior to a pump is not rare at all. 

I don't really see what you're trying to get at though? Someone thought bitcoin got too cheap and invested heavily just when people started to pile in to sell (maximizing liquidity, minimizing slippage)

[removed]
To short? Okay.
If anything this is a bear flag...

Bounced just below 7.8, I'd say that was close enough to test it as resistance. Long here is risky cause appropriate stop should be below 7.2.
what bullflag  
4hr is a gravestone doji, super bearish
Honestly I don't think there's much chance of us going under 6.5k. This is already so oversold.
this is utterly ridiculous

You will get utterly rekt with completely ludicrous expectations
Quick maths, 33k margin longs at 7k is 251 mil, at 6k its 200 mil.

This won’t make the price drop 2k.

In feb bottom, 10k longs got liquidated at 7.5k and the price didn’t move.
I could see this easily playing out. I agree with the assessment, but not the numbers.

Thank you, I try!

Of all the bart formations in recent memory, this one is likely to hurt the most if it retraces 100%. 

Because it wouldn't necessarily indicate that selling pressure is overwhelming. Moreso that buying pressure is underwhelming. 
Thanks, means a lot. In the beginning I definitely sucked tons of ass. Opening and closing positions 10-20 times a day. I’m still not the best and will never be the best, but practice makes perfect.

One of the best things I’ve learned in my month and a half of trading is patience. Over trading straight slaughtered my stack in the beginning, but the more patient you are.. the less chance you have of over trading and finding the best positions. This sub has definitely been a major part of my crypto life/life, and I appreciate every one of you fuckers. 
Now, I’ll get out of the markets way for the time being and enter when I find the right position. Thanks homes

That was me making a point. I thought it was funny. Sorry - I'll close it at break even. 🙂
"fetch"?

Edit: looks like [Ten Thousand](https://xkcd.com/1053/) might apply to me here.
It’s not going to happen! 
This made me chortle. 
Tried this but some think m = mega. extra confusing.

I'm thinking more RGD r = regular.
I almost never go against you on my trading account, but EOS just jumped 10% and it's the hot coin the market wants in on the most right now... could be a good indicator of a reversal at least for a little while. Long from $7533.
Indeed. It depends how actively someone wants to trade. I find trying to take positions with 1% stops to be much too stressful, but folks that play higher leverage may.
Doubt that LTC got anything for us right now, EOS is in front of a big launch, so I predict a higher price in the following days.
Yep, right now EOS is at +10%
That's the trick 
To be honest the interbank forex market is the closest you can come to crypto, no regulation at all because who should enforce it? 
Overinvested emotionally, not financially
yeah I already sold 1 rd in the last run up to 10K, this time I was going to sell another 2nd and then keep a bunch of alts , some I believe in, some could go through the roof and I'd be rich , heh who fucking knows, some of my friends are equities traders and even they said they don't have a clue when it comes to crypto 

but obviously before I even have time to sell, it crashes 20-30% because crypto fucking bounces harder than Sasha Grey 
I could afford to lose it, would be shit but not the end of my life, I'm in a decent paid job and have no kids to look after so 
im not going to sell it while its down, I don't need the money, it's not about the money to me, it's just the stress of living in this world, I wish I had never found it, and also, 90% of people I know think I'm an idiot for putting 50K+ in this which is also not a nice feeling
i sell alternative data to hedge funds, it's a booming industry right now. Lots of fundamental funds trying to catch up with systematic trading firms and now labelling themselves as "quantamental" 
Thanks, also grats on the Ducati :)
There absolutely should not be any premium right now based on the recent market movement combined with the limited time until settlement.

The premium really shouldn't jump substantially at all unless the market gets above $7800. 
Ah. Haserfauld has already posted it in his last comment as the cyan line. I've got mine slightly different but it looks like the market is bouncing off it for now
to add more* sorry. I have been talking with other people about adding because if we do break below the symmetrical triangle then a $7.8k+ short will be insanely profitable because the target will be very low. 
The bull div I'll be looking for will be larger and obvious on 4h+ time frames. Not a small one separated by 8 hours. More like one where we dip below $7k but fail to make a new low on rsi. Maybe even twice
I thought the same, but I just looked it up and I think both are valid.

they kept the bugs! fantastic SDLC practices!
I liked seeing recent trades to the right of chart but now you have to switch between orders and trades... Don't like..
i swear, switching from ETH to BTC is a pain now.
But it looks like they a re getting ready to add new coins. Listing more trading pairs would not work with the old gdax layout.
Don't introduce facts and numbers into this discussion.

It's always interesting when someone asks you what your predictions will be and you realize they're different from your position/assumed default bias. 

Like back at $6.5k if anyone asked me what's more likely, $8k or $5k? I'd have said $8k but I still remained short...

The hardest part is ignoring your feelings and listening to your brain

One might say....the market pumped his stomach
It basically is. It's a rounded top / H&S / few other things. The vomiting camel is basically a comical approach to charting a DCB/rejected rally.
Nonsense. Whales are returning some of the Mother Day's gifts for a refund. That's why.
I'll open a short again once buyers give up again. Wherever that might be. 
We'll see what happens if the market gets down there. 

I rarely base my positions on what I assume the market will do. Instead I prefer to react to what the market actually does.

The market may not bounce off that line, opting instead to drop right through. 
BYD FTW!
Yeah, that was my snap judgement too. But, with the right risk mitigation strategy and trading plan, seems like it's not as stupid as I initially thought. 
That would be my biggest fear. Even with a stop limit, it hasn't always triggered with a big move. I suppose you'd have to have a pretty decent spread to be on the safe side.
No its not calculated at all if you can calculate this market youd be rich without borrowing money from your retirement. Smh
Good suggestion, I just don't know much about the mechanics with that scenario. I thought that would involve a bank as the custodian that had to approve any investments, and I didn't think "gambling on crypto" would qualify.
Yeah, that's kinda how I feel...Even if it were to work out, was is really a smart play? 
Lol. Yeah, we figured you'd have to allow for some pad time out of the 60 days for bank transfer time as well as any exchange shenanigans, so it would probably be closer to only 1 month in the market. But you're right, they could always throw a wrench in the plan.
I said the same thing..risking more than you can afford to lose is breaking rule #1. That's where sticking to the plan with the stop losses comes into play. But anyone who's been drunk at the blackjack table saying "it's about to turn around" knows that can be hard to do.
When late 2014's bull market took off it was driven by imaginary money from willybot though.  Wasn't a real organic bull run.
Not a strategy. I'm stepping back and taking the whole market in. Trying to think about position and narrative. I'll look into details when I have a better sense of where I think we're at in a larger story.
did you read their update from their previous article, when they admitting the price fell "due to the article"? lol

>Bitcoin extended its Thursday declines after Bloomberg News reported the investigation, and was down 3 percent to $7,409 as of 9:32 a.m. London time. It’s down more than 20 percent since a May 4 peak.


Or they were subpoenaed for another reason. These subpoenas happens hunderds of times for big companies.

1) Be Bloomberg journalist

2) Have friends at banks with money that are fearing crypto

3) Produce a FUD article

4) Your friends shorts with leverage, while market selling

5) You get a nice % of the profit

easy to make money those days for some
The game is rigged because bitcoin is rife with fraud and manipulation, but if you want to blame the media for reporting the reality of the situation then that's certainly your prerogative.  Seeking a scapegoat is a classic time tested strategy.
Well to be honest it's a BB article dated today, it's not like he himself made it up :P

The only example given in the article is that a blogger wrote about “spoofy” who was placing $1m orders then cancelling them.

That’s absolutely nothing in the bigger scheme of things. 

This article is based on “4 people said”, it’s nonsense.
Since crypto markets are unregulated no laws can be broken so this is pure fud 
The US is pretty good at throwing it's weight around in jurisdictions where it should have no power.

Not really. That's sort of my point, the sub acts like [this](https://imgur.com/gallery/o5GYA) but often times the market doesn't do the same. It speaks to the disparity between Bitcoin Markets and Bitcoin *markets*. 
I am insanely bullish on PR (and any other hurricane devastated locale with desirable tourism) irrespective of crypto. Vulture capitalism.

The Chinese money is starting to flow into the Caribbean as well. You would do well to invest in distressed luxury real estate IMHO. The potential upside is huge. (Hank Paulson & Peter Schiff are already doing this)

No other reason to move there. It's more expensive than most of the US even though the island is poorer than the rest of the US.

Yes.

> And the potential for bitcoin 5 years from now has changed for the worst

So I guess all the companies and development projects centered around bitcoin that have launched in the last 12-24 months are a figment of my imagination? Is Lightning all vaporware? Is the US Futures market and ICE prepping a crypto exchange and Goldman starting a bitcoin desk ruining bitcoin's potential?

The long term horizon has never been better.
> The price is down about 5% on that CFTC news.

Wrong. You can't separate what was caused by the news and what wasn't.

>And the potential for bitcoin 5 years from now has changed for the worst, with many nations banning it since 2014...China and India being the major two...and the EU and USA hasn't done strict bans but have regulated it into something very different than it was 4 years ago.

You can repeat this as often as you like but it's not true either. the regulation and enforcement is related to exchanges and ICOs. Other then sensible regulation on mining, Bitcoin itself remains untouched.

Your FUD is so stale at this point. I'd recommend inventing a new tactic. 
You think so? 4 hours ago it was 1am on the west coast of USA. Currently just now 8 am on the east coast. I expect another dumpening when everyone wakes up here. 
Only down 67% in the last 5 months.
~~No collusion!~~ No wash trading!
Bad news got us here? It's been good news for weeks.
The issue/risk is if we find out 90% of the price and value is due to manipulation and when they stop, we find that btc has a significantly lower actual value than now.
Fud dumps are often irrational. That doesn't mean they don't occasionally occur. 
I'll likely step away for at least a few hours to see how the market reacts once the us wakes up.

I agree that you can draw that formation. But I still considered it a bull flag due to volume dropping off after the initial pole and lower lows and highs forming.

Maybe I'm looking at too short of a time frame. Charted on the 15 min.
Hmm good points
Do you still have any of that massive short position still open?
While I agree that you can make lots of money that way, don't you feel like you miss out on a lot of trading opportunities with all the bounces?

  
Live in Houston by chance? I see the name. In regards to the hurricane? I moved away from Houston 1.5 yrs ago, that's why I'm asking.

Nice, I started in September last year. Cash out a set amount every Sunday.

I trade strictly on GDAX with LTC/USD being my number one pair, but I also do BTC/USD.

bulls == $bears

It's always good to keep that in mind.
it's bitcoin daily but inverted. You put a 1/ before the symbol so it inverts it with math.
You seem to have missed the "partially" thing. I'm also not going for maximum gain. I never go all in or all out. I found out, that it makes my decisions unbalanced and unhealthy. 

I'm basically DCA in close to the bottom (reduce risk in fiat position) and DCA out close to the top regions (reduce risk in crypto position). My time horizon is quite long (months and years).

For this cycle I tend to believe I have to act on a shorter time frame.

I’m admittedly a bit unclear on the contract details, since I haven’t researched it further. Could someone who knows a bit more on the topic enlighten me? Is the strike price based on how many people buy the contract then?
To partially answer your question, the details of the DOWN contract includes the following information for early expiry: “If .BXBT touches or falls below KO Barrier Price during the life of the trade then early expiry and settlement occurs using the KO Barrier Price. From the contract specifications: Settlement price = 0.1 * (Strike - KO Barrier) /  KO Barrier.”

While the price details in terms of profit/loss are admittedly still a bit murky to me, I assume that the breakeven price you cite would likely be for the contract buyer, rather than for the exchange itself. I would imagine the exchange would be incentivized to avoid touching or falling below this barrier price regardless to avoid early expiration and settlement costs, correct?
only bears can see it 
They don't think it be like it is but it do.

Shorts definitely got lucky this morning with the bad news sending the market down 6-7%.   Although some of them shorted, because they knew more bad news is never that far out, so less luck there.
Because I drew this yesterday
I think he just means interest is paid to longs by shorts, nothing to do with price. 
The easiest way to think about this is that if prices are falling faster than the underlying exchanges then the rates will go negative.

I screwed up the bot, but it's 20x with 100% of my trading stack. 
i can sell you a bridge for the remainder of your btc.
Oh we will for sure.  But we have to go down first and wash out the bear market, really find the bottom.  Then we'll recover.  Are you patient enough?
He trades with a portion of his hodl stack so he's fine. 

In terms of his entire bitcoin stack, he's only 2x short.

For anyone unfamiliar with margin trading, this means that he will actually *make* money off of the price going down. 

Going 1x short on bitmex is the same thing as selling/being flat, meaning you're not making *money* off it going down, you just make more bitcoin. Anything above 1x means you're officially making money off of it going down.

Afaik he hasn't done this in a very long time, possibly early 2017? which makes sense, since bitcoin has largely gone up or sideways since 2016

Getting a tablet is a good idea \(don't know why I haven't thought about that before\). But the device itself will only change so much.

Entering an order can take up to 2 minutes sometimes if I'm not logged in to Kraken etc.
Totally agree! I've fallen for emotional and uninformed trades a few times! But given the context I'm in, my situation won't change and I still want to be able to trade well...
Do you mind sharing what bot or automated tool you’re using?
It's not terrible r/r. It's actually pretty good. $7800-$8200 is one of the strongest supports in the entire range from $6k to $12k. it will serve as incredible resistance overhead. 

On the other hand, there's not much between here and the $6ks. 

that is why we're having such trouble getting  above even $7.7k. Because everyone knows the entire market will sell $7.8-8.2. Notice the ask side is significantly thicker now than it was any time on the way up (buy high sell low am I right?)

Every attempt to get past $7.6-7.7 is shot down pretty quickly 


RSI is basically beaten to a pulp yet we can't even manage more than a 5% bounce 

As long as you're below 10x, a short from $7600+ isn't too bad. 

And unfortunately, if we do drop below $7.4k again it will feel very dangerous to short. So if you consider the future prospect of another visit to $7k and a possible drop below that (which could end up signaling an even larger move down), a short here is possibly much better than waiting to see what happens.

RSI has only just dipped below 30 on the 1hr. I'm surprised by that given how fast the dump has just come.

Well played. Mine from 7630 closed at 7380 overnight, but I re-opened the hedge prematurely on the bounce from 7250 to 7380. 
Possibly. Keeping an eye on it.
That depends on what your short/mid expectations are. If you think the downtrend remains, than 7500 is above the midway point on our channel. By 8PM EST tonight, it will be the upper boundary. 

This move pushed RSI out of oversold territory on every timeframe but 4H. If we chop sideways between 7450-7550 for the next couple hours, that one should clear too. 
On the smaller underwater short, I'll consider bailing if we break the channel (>7700). The larger one I'll probably bail over 7900. I'm in no hurry to lose that position. 
Yeah...that will be a hard pill to swallow if we do climb another few percent. I should have listened to /u/citral23 telling me to close "close" to my target ;)
Where's your long open from? If it's under 7400 I'd just set stops at 7400. 
I'm surprised that there's still a premium there. After all those drops they should be at discount by now..
I can't argue with that. Having patience and not chasing positions has been somewhat of a weakness of mine. Definitely something to work on, so thanks.
Lol and your underwater short!
https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hacker-makes-over-18-million-in-double-spend-attack-on-bitcoin-gold-network/
The problem is that exchanges accept these coins. What I'm saying is the community is so fractured in the projects and exchanges have so many things they are trying to keep up with anyway how are they going to monitor for double spend attacks (sure you can raise the confirmations or throttle WDs) but the point is that it's an attack on part of bitcoin infrastructure indirectly and an exchange going insolvent would be very bad. Tether just further centralizes this risk. I agree I don't fuck with alts but this could be a systemic risk since so many projects are very amateurish.
Im no alt believer I'm just saying that this is a possible systemic risk whether or not you use alts. I'm starting to think that a BTC only exchange would actually be a worthwhile investment to mitigate this risk.
I agree but they probably wont because they make so much in trading fees. A BTC only exchange would actually be something I would move to just to mitigate this risk. I would move completely to bitmex or okex but having my entire trading stash with the ability to leverage it up too much doesn't usually end too well.
https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hacker-makes-over-18-million-in-double-spend-attack-on-bitcoin-gold-network
Ye that's my thinking. Raises some interesting game theory questions when it comes to alts if these exchanges become a reality. Hell it raises some interesting game theory questions as things stand.
>  the memory of the short squeeze is too fresh.

oh man, that was so good
yea i think shorts learned their lesson
So you’re calling me out for making incorrect predictions? Guess what... my predictions aren’t below the 6-9 month low.

I’m not naiv... I’m saying making such a prediction is ridiculous for now
*Naive* 

Why isn’t 4.2K a real possibility or 3.122K

Why is there a next stop. How long is a stop. It all sounds like conjecture. 
It's not bazzare. Trading volume is causal to comments.
thanks... I guess :p
well said
lol, Ill just be posting less. Really thought 7800 would give us a good bounce.

Kinda done trading too. Lately haven’t been making the best calls and I make more money just working than trading at this point. I know how to trade... there’s very little learning experience here left for me.

I’d rather just work/code to make money. Trading isn’t worth it anymore for me

I guess give it a spin for adding to your short position, pretty good entry point right here 
LTC looks more like a descending triangle, but anyway Charlie bailing doomed the coin I think, especially since you have so many alternatives now.

Yup, I'm one of them.  I am convinced this is nowhere near bottom yet though.  In my opinion there really isn't a reason to dump crypto except only to find a lower buy-in point.  FUD comes and passes.
Hm, interesting, hadn’t thought of that. Might serve to curb their enthusiasm on attempting to short this FUD again.
Well, to me based off what I’ve been reading, at least :P I don’t hold much but like to stay on the safe side and was not expecting a BGD given such negativity all over the place. Definitely not complaining.
Ascending wedge resistance. Very short-term on the 15 min. Seems like it broke through but is struggling a bit.
Yeah, the BGD at 7250 was an attempt to start a rally, but nobody else is trying to start it either. At least not as many longs that are closing which are underwater.

I wonder if we will get a true "long squeeze" or if a slow bleed *is* what a long squeeze really looks like--just sustained selling pressure constantly as underwater longs cut bait.
Probably just some minor chop chop chop before the forbidden LRD. I’ll be holding onto my short. Although, I am getting plastered at the beach tonight so I should probably close early 
Bingo!
Bart, fart, Mario cart, or shart.. honestly who knows where this is going. 

All I know is it looks super super similar to yesterday and we rocketed out of the reversal ascending triangle and it looks like bulls are making a pretty strong attempt here. 
I'm sure "puking camel" began as a joke, but now it's actually a thing

>No new money, use current position to protect.

Can you clarify what you mean by this please? If I am already in for my full stack I have to either sell some and take a loss on it or add new money to then be able to short.
This is the conundrum. If I set a market stop at 6200, what's the benefit of that over just risking liquidation (apart from the tiny amount I will have left)?
this is utterly ridiculous

I know big money... they’re not buying anything that’s not in the top 5
Psyops account. Others beware
Also scaling into the postition is great. When you think you are sure, use 10% of your stack to buy/sell then add if it moves against you. More wiggling room and no fear for BRGs or BGDs.
Okay thank you, honestly seems like a good plan. Thank you!
How do I add those? Like I have no prior experience lol but I really wanna learn. Like I see lines but I really don’t understand it 
And make a log in a spreadsheet of buys/sells and their price points and cumulative&periodic gain/loss.
I'm curious. Why are you always cheerleading for a drop? It's a great way to get rekt in this game, even if your only investment is emotional, as yours largely seems to be. 

Wouldn't want to be short right now. You guys are going to get massacred when the folks who were dumping early this week cover over the next few days.

I hate it too. Even the colors suck. Gdax is better 
There could just about as easily be another big move down instead.

That's what traders do, we make the best predictions we can based on supply/demand/tea leaves etc, we just keep stop losses incase we are wrong (which I have). Also predicting chop is a very reasonable & broad prediction to make based on fractals and experience trading Bitcoin in this context lol
No, I'm shorting 1x, but yes, it's basically the same thing in practice.
I have you tagged as "more abrasive binaryechos" -- so I'm not surprised you're bullish off this technical bounce. 
Price is down 63% in the last few months and pretty close to 2018 lows, so that could possibly have something to do with it.
You can be .25x margin long and completely unsqueezable tho
That makes sense too 
Cuz that's precisely the point where you saw the real FOMO buying begin in Oct. 2107
Used x3.5 leverage and the whole stack. And on ETH it hit at the very bottom on the dollar.  on BTC at 7270.
one can hope, I just can’t trust BGDs anymore
[deleted]
Now if only that had a short ayconame like bgd I would push it hard
interestingly enough, the poll option with most votes so far has been right more than wrong. 

Unless you count $7925 as not hitting $7899 and you count the spikes above $8600 to be $8600 being hit  first. 

Personally I say $7925 is close enough

This sub was largely in favor of $10k before $5.999k at $9k+ though.

Like, 66-34%.

Now it's 44-56% and we're closer to the bottom than the top. 

If, at $6.7k it becomes 34-66% then a large portion this sub is simply changing its mind with the price fluctuations 😅

The only confusing thing is that people change their minds (who'da thunk anyone would change their minds in this market? ;) so you can't exactly say people were wrong if they decided to change their mind.
On deribit 
Edited my original comment for more color. 

You're describing the lowest-hanging fruit: a bank front-running its dumb/retail clients. While profitable, in the grand scheme of things, this is a drop in the bucket compared to profits derived from trading *against other banks* (remember, Lehman & Bear were the biggest losers in '08/'09).

In terms of capital flow *into* the cryptocurrency market (e.g. truly adding to "market cap"), this would open the floodgates. 
More like pigs screamings.
My man. :')
I won't argue that. 
We’re still in downtrend lmao
do you think it’s possible we don’t go sub 7k on this dumperino?

6800 will be the one to watch for me, but we just retraced 50% of the BGD and I don’t think we go lower. But obv I’ve been wrong plenty of times
Including you, sir chew? 
I had an add on my underwater short at 7595. Hit on that wick. Someone market bought a metric f#$kton on swaps. 
before posting, discussed it with mod and they wanted in the daily.. i just was a dumb ass to post it in the wrong daily thread.. now its in the right one :).  In other major subs, we crate separate thread for em
Beat me to it.
sorry wrong thread, will post in the new alt discussion from now on

This chart convinced me to move my stop limit a bit up. Above 7,700. Thanks mate!
Did we just fall out? On mobile and can't tell 
Yeah, those fakeouts are annoying are not they? I have been very very unlucky in such situations previous week.
Doesn’t feel like it’s anywhere near the bottom now though haha 
Plus, us revisiting 7k isn't exactly unexpected. Big question is if we bounce or drop more. 
Most of these manipulators are very smart...or geniuses.  They are already filthy rich at this point and they will judge risk/reward and many will decide it's time to cool off and find a different hobby.
My guess is that will be the last one you'd actually want to have filled. 

Buyers should either give up or push through here (he said hopefully).
We'd have to get back over $8000 for a shot at a breakout, I think.
Well, it moved above the trendline. But it seems it pulled back right after it...
I was talking about a quick retest of this pink line.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/0YKFKoUB

It might just fall through though. Primarily looking for the bounce at 7K.
The sacred chart. 
They're one in the same for me. Severe in Bitcoin is all relative. The ups are just as violent as the downs. A bear market in Bitcoin is extreme but doesn't really represent much else other than exhaustion and re-distribution, at least in this phase of things. I have no doubt that this is the same cycle we've seen before. If we go below previous ATH at 1.2K, I'll call *that* more than just a correction.
Which triangle?
Yup. The bottom of our descending  channel rejected it 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/81bu9TdY/

Have that on my chart too. I feel like this is either the make or break point for the bulls 
I’ll DCA up to $7825 and bail of $7900 ish. Opened 25% of my position here 
( Knock on wood) I’m doing pretty good. Don’t follow my trades though lol, I’m bound to get burned eventually 
Hold on there cowboy. Don’t jump the gun too quick 
Welcome to goblintown my friend ;\) 
yes, but then it makes 0 sense that CFTC is investigating since they can not even prosecute people
Yeah one could easily guess where those lawyers(that produce 0 value by the way) are employed
>But there really is rampant manipulation in crypto markets, so if they can discourage some of it, that will probably be good for traders...probably.

But "manipulation"  can only occur against some measurable critera. Those critera does not exist, it's for me like investigating the trading market in Diablo 3
Not cheap enough compared to march lows. Strange market reaction anyway. 
I expected them to crash harder and faster. Many of them are not responding at all. It's very strange.

Just kidding :)
All Bullish! Don't leave cash on Exchanges! 
That's how you become a wick
you can use scaled order on Bfinex where you can define a range to place orders
yes but quick decision is the key. not like "hmm should i sell.. maybe yes i do it"
[removed]
this is the part where delusional bears think the dump under 7k will be the final one. We are on a collision course with 3k.
Would be nice. Still a bit too soon to call this one over though unfortunately.
True, just found the coincidence between the announcement, gold pump and BTC pump almost down to the minute interesting. 

But you're right, ... maybe one day. 
Hmm I thought I got the notification at pretty much the same time. 

I'll look into the correlation with the SP500, sounds interesting to keep tabs on. Thanks!
Yeah, lots of people dismiss this idea outright, saying that Bitcoin is too volatile and unpredictable to be a valid hedge. I don't see it that way. It's difficult to gauge what the current correlation is, if any. But theoretically Bitcoin provides a safe-haven because it's fundamentally de-coupled from the rest of the economic tangle. I don't see a good argument for why capital wouldn't flow into Bitcoin during these situations, even in its nascent/speculative phase.
I'd love to see a VEFBTC chart, but there is no decent VEF series on tradingview.
Even if it *weren't* full of confirmation bias, it's very hard to quantify or qualify sentiment based on just reading through the daily. Even if you could accurately gauge and measure, you're just looking at a select number of people who post here. The market is not Bitcoin Markets. Some people think everything the community exists in a vacuum.
Looking at the 15min BTC chart on binance (compressed) makes me think up as well as the sub sentiment. That's a hell of a drop to look at.
Yeah. Think I saw 3 guys  here capitulate. The rest are buying the dips like bitcoin is free money 
I wish we could tattoo this on every person's forehead that thinks BTC needs to essentially die for it to go up again.  BTC did okay without capitulations from $160 to $19,000.  Everything doesn't have to match the meme chart we've all seen that is referenced like some holy text.
Capitulation will start when 6k breaks and there is no real bounce at 5k, then we migth see some fomo selling hapening. Everyone that bougth after september and before 7k will start to feel the heat
Do you think it's valuable to observe open longs vs shorts for capitulation as a sign of weakness to buy, perhaps?
The drop to 6.4 in February for example, that was a brutal, fast drop with a V-shaped recovery.

That's what I mean by capitulation, when it happens, everybody agrees the dump is over, at least temporarily. 

I don't see that now tbh, but I don't know whether that's completely necessary for a recovery either.
>no, not nearly enough.  We are in the “cheap coins” phase.  Plenty of hodlers are still increasing their stacks.  It’s capitulation when the  so called “hodlers” lose their faith, sell their coins at a loss and find out their hands weren’t really all that strong in the first place.  BTC will be forgotten in the news.  The number of comments in this thread will plummet.

This has literally happened at least twice now. BTC has fallen out of the news and the number of comments here and on other subreddits has drastically fallen since the peak. If you're expecting the entire BTC community to completely empty out, you're being totally irrational.
You've got it completely backwards. Hodlers don't sell. They write it off and forget about it for a couple years, then check the price and find mad gains. 

Historically, the only capitulation in Bitcoin is by bears. I have no doubt that the math will work out the same for the current crop of bears, just with bigger numbers.
But when will you know it’s “low enough”.  Could be low enough right now, or it could go down to 2k.  No one really knows.  We all have our guesses.  Personally I think we will bottom out very gently in July-September around 4.5k,  others think we already bottomed at 6k.  

Other people believe that BTC is essentially worthless and the bottom will never come,  it will just go down and down until no one wants it anymore.  
That's because capitulation already happened twice. 
There's been a shit ton of capitulation since 20k, but this markets now have thousands of buyers layered at all levels so you'll always find people longing dips even if we crash to the core.
Equilibrium patterns don't always break upward, but they do give you an indication that a break is approaching, which gives you an opportunity to take a position and set stops to get on top of the trade or exit it if necessary.

Establishing a higher high, then a higher low and lower high, etc. tells you that whatever run or drop that may have been occurring previously is due for a possible change of direction. As with most TA indicators, there are a lot of factors to consider, such as RSI, Shorts/Longs, etc.
If the day ends up it will bend back
and if it doesn't bend back it still doesn't indicate direction
these are just confidence intervals to help give you an idea of the range of the movement in either direction
At the moment I'd say no one here has any idea what's going on. You could probably flip a coin and trade accordingly and still do better than most traders...
I’m permabull just because i want my holdings to be worth more not because every day I believe it will moon. The permashorts on this sub do think(very loudly) we’re going rock bottom every day all day. The doom and gloom here is exhausting even when we’re above 9000
Can I **please** have my money back though? :(
How long have you been in the game?
Valid point. 
Who’s been right more often? 
div element, it's used to define sections (or divisions) of a page. 

This can be useful for applying styles and presenting information. 

Short for *divinations*, which is what most people in this sub are practicing. 
Thanks, I'll take note of it. The daily RSI is currently at 34. I will give it a good few more hours before determining what I am going to do with this trade, not going to jump in too soon. 
I am long from $8,275 3.3x. Liquidation just between $7,000 and $7,100.

I haven't lost a dime so far, neither did I made any. Either I will let this ride upwards, or I will add more stack as said to bring the CA lower from $8,275.

btcusd is fine when trading spot. 
Isn’t it btc in USA?
Depends on the Exchange. I have no filter whatsoever, you can short Legacy if you like :) (the worst that can happen is no PnL calculations since no exchange has that pair)
Yeah, at this point i'm also convinced they wont really play put.. thats why i said hopium :-D.
>lol how hard did you hit the hopium this morning?

You're as much of a zealot as the guy you're making fun of. 

7400 yesterday was massively oversold, as many indicators showed, so your whole 'every indicator' argument is obviously either a) delusional or b) showing a massive lack of knowledge when it comes to trading. 

Anyone being rationale right now would be open to either scenario. 
Aww thats cute. Unfortunately we are living in reality and its very clear bears are bleeding dry. Ive closed my shorts and waiting for the right entry point to long. Most realists are planning the same
How big was the spike in new longs?
Cool, I should have plenty of time to get in position then. 
That would actually bode well for a bottom confirmation if it took 5 months. 
Right, I guess all I'm trying to get at is if lingering around a TL longer the second time instead of a more dramatic reaction tells us anything about the next time it gets tested and likelihood that it will hold up.
market orders

edit : i don't like to give too much info but i am trading on an exchange with low liquidity so sometimes one can frontrun the move

edit 2 : tightened stops to B/E
Not *way* above in the 1H-4H range, but above. 
It's not "way above 30" on the 4h through the 1d, but it is fair to say it's above 30 on those timeframes.
Maybe we are a bit oversold on the weekly from 20 to 7.4k, time for a retrace to 15k
Ok buddy. Who is selling? What percentage of exchanges' activities are retail?
No, to highlight my idiocy. Like a scarlet letter.  A warning to all not to do what I do. 
Yeah, there's hope. That first week in April was depressing.
What? No, a month is the longest timeframe. Not even the universe is a month old.
its mostly old bulls wasting their gains  from last year.  no new money coming in


this seems like a solid plan to me
how? it was tiny 
futures exchange commission something
right

like we've never had the MT Gox market crash
bruh too risky lol, at least wait for a bottom
\+1 Bloomberg are the worst mainstream news outlet when it comes to publishing FUD.
Agreed. But this could bump it into panic selling as people may be fearful for their accounts on exchanges.
Don't you know anything, the price only ever goes up because of manipulation. Real value of Bitcoin is somewhere in low tripple digits!
Classy move
So do I amigo. Also look at the OTC numbers amigo 😊
Just going to downvote you straight.
How do we know what is a reasonable price? It's not like BTC has a fundamental value. I wouldn't be surprised if BTC dropped to 3k, 4k this year

Downvotes for simply suggesting the possibility lol this sub

It's becoming apparent insiders already had this information and sold like hell, which is why we saw just straight drops without bounces. Before this news, I wasn't sure if the log support line would hold at the speed which this is dropping. Now, it's like adding weight to an unstable car hanging on the cliff
Reliable method of cheering up a bull.
People saying they're scared, people losing they're shit and thinking about quitting crypto, people saying these are the biggest sell walls they've ever seen etc.

I don't understand, I thought bears were dreaming about time, they're time to shine and short the fuck out of this market. No?
day trading, in 575 and back out, but ya i sold at 775 week or so ago. side note i kinda got burned putting my stack in alts with the first bitcoin bust when it tanked from 9.3k lol trying to recover some loss. only going to trade btc and ether for now.
👍🏻 at this point we feel nothing 
Amen.
[deleted]
This was the smart thing to do and I wish I would have done it. Just cash out enough to cover living expenses for like 5 years and HODl/wait until the real bubble when you can retire. No worries about trading and 5% moves or chasing losses. Kudos to you
He had a plan to cash out more after certain milestones, but he never updated his cashing out status.
Reading this sounds very interesting, even though I wasn't around that time.

L14dy, promise me that if given the chance and I'm wherever in Europe you are that we can have a pint or two. You're one of the few over the years who's been consistently level-headed.
Maybe it's the royal "we".
There is no WE in crypto!
Are all those walls legit?
2-3 days ago is the opposite
and btc go down 500$
How much of that is market manipulation though? How much stock to you all actually put into keeping an eye on sell/buy walls? So many are constantly pulled that I really stopped paying attention to it at this point. 
It's whatever you want it to be. If I wanted I could !long gypsytoy 12345
Don't forget that order books get cleared on big moves and it takes a while to get them filled as people wait to see what's going to happen next. Usually it takes a lot less coins to reverse the direction before market decides to fill the books.
point taken sir, deleted my post.
I didn't realize that no one was allowed to be bullish here.
Rule 1 - drink it in. That's a terrible place to send someone.

Yeah i meant bear flag apologies, leverage is low and keeping a close eye on it.
sure better to short after $500 drop 
that's a bit of a reach
Hasn't closed yet, and whoops i meant bear\* flag

´Hold my beer’ - The corn
oversold perpetually? when hasn't it been this year? that hasn't stopped the price from tanking since ATH
Tell that to those who bought ATH with no guarantee it ever gets back there.  Nothing is ludicrous with BTC.
I think margin longs will continue to increase until 5-6k this is the key.
Subjective.

Consider the magnitude of FUD required to take the market down 33% from a low $300B vs. up 25% to a familiar $400B.

$300B globally is peanuts.
I took it as frustration.
No that has the default 0000. But alas still nobody has found a way in.

LBC has introduced KYC as well.

They pay a hefty premium to get into the market. Over-trading on LBC is quite costly. So I tend to believe the net effect of LBC is reducing the overall supply.
I thought we all wanted an end to whale manipulation.  I for one would love to place limit orders on Gdax without 30 coins suddenly appearing .01 under current price.

why are you shorting while RSI is oversold instead of waiting for a jump to around 8k to short? \(or are you  just looking to take profit around 7200?\)
Let this house burn down. It's more gratifying that BTC gain dominance, even if the only way to get there is to crash the price. Alts must die.
Trade, do not have a hodl stack yet. I will try to go the haserfauld way and build up one. If i lose it all, all good, i will not have lost one single penny.
im referring to more to the big picture.  The first time we went down around feb.5 was the capitulation.  volume on GDAX was around 100k if i remember correctly and we touched 5900.  the next crash was on lesser volume between 30-40k (if i remember correctly) and it hit like 6500.  Now we are at 7500 and the volume is around 17k.  So the theory is that the big whale sellers are low on coins and this bear trend game is coming to an end and they will need to load up and start a massive bull run so they can play the Game again
Ah haha, no worries I had no idea, I thought it was a glitch!
You can use the delete command for that 
Exit any open positions, close your charts, and go watch Mean Girls. 

Trust me, it's a better use of your time than trying to trade the market at the moment.
It’s from a movie, “mean girls”
....red green?
Just GD?  Before the BGD people used to just say green dildo around here.
Saw the same thing, tempted to scalp a tiny long even though the trend is down.
you and u/danceswithpizzaz are brave to trade EOS even if it's due a technical bounce that far below the daily kumo.

Just be careful for a busted hype cycle and play the LT game with EOS as you u/Keats_in_rome likely is. Trading EOS when you're LT long is probably working against yourself. You'd be stuck babysitting a position which would take away your time from research and staying up to date on the fundamentals.
When did you buy? You need to cash some out is all. You're over invested. Turn your digital money into real money and live life again 
Were you in position while the premium finally died? I can't recall. Definitely some small amount of vindication that I opened with a $100 premium and finally got that bonus. :P
gotcha thanks. good post
Thanks! I love small insightful posts like these ones :)
They can't both be valid, because it is about retracing the move and the key fib levels are not symmetrical, above and below 50%.
With a lot of fantasy you could even describe the current situation as an IH&S.

A **lot** of fantasy.
But she is so hot tho...

edit: that 5k bitcorn I mean...
You need to edit this.
Well it’s 1500 down and 2500 up. If we get to 8k then we in real no mans land 😬
How do you determine when buyers have given or are giving up?
So if it Breaks i assume you Short then (at least I would do that)
The easiest person to fool is yourself. If your strategy was so tight you wouldn't need to be doing something ridiculous like borrowing money on a 30-day float from your retirement account that sounds so ridiculous I actually hope you fuck up lose everything and owe the IRS money
> No its not calculated at all 

You could not be any more confused and lost.  You have my condolences.
I dont think the one i used does crypto, but i did not ask.  I know they are out there though.  It is really a simple process and sounds more complicated than it is.  They are just a "custodian" of the assets to confirm compliance with IRA laws - mostly that you are not using those funds for living.  But i dont think they really mind where the money goes.  Once it is there it is pretty much yours to do with but stay within the rules or you run risk of jeopardizing its tax free status.  GL
at the time (November '17) it was justifiable because it seemed like there was nowhere to go but up.  I made some (in retrospect) terrible trades, but somehow still ended up making profits.  If I did it in the current environment, it would feel more like reckless gambling.

A couple of other things to consider: When I cashed out in late December, I left about 10k behind.  Within a week, that 10k was 30k, but by the end of January, my gains were erased, and I'm down to 4 figures worth of house money, which has been sitting on the sidelines since mid-March.  

I think the lesson to be learned is that if you really know what you're doing (which I don't), you don't need to borrow that money, because you can make big gains with any amount, and even more importantly, you can lose big time even if you know what you are doing.  Arguably, if I was still trying to trade these last five months with borrowed money, I could have gone from being up over 100% to in the red.
Surely as the writer/editor you're frontrunning a short...
Fitting, considering the content of the bloomberg article about manipulation.
The same as normal markets then. It’s the same thing there. 
Did you read the article? It's not what the article is about. The subpoenas have been known about for months.

I encourage you to look at /u/BitcoinTrolling101's history, it's nonstop Finex FUD.
I assume you mean 6850? Ironically 6850 and 7850 are probably the two places I'd look to bail haha 
Yeah idk, but ING only confirmed an account, which could mean anything -- dormant or actively used.

Guess we'll just have to see how everything pans out again. 
It's not even bad news 
Most use USDT though, so It'll be interesting to see how that plays out. 
All that is great... and the potential is still worse than it was in 2014.
Yep and people will never use email when they can just send mail through the post office and telephone books are still awesome. 
I, on the east coast, looked at the news when I woke up and laughed. This is the same recycled FUD over and over and people see that I think
Why 5 months? Why not 6 months or 7 months or 12 months? Arbitrary time frames can yield scary figures.

You're truly the master of FUD.
Yes, bad news this year got us here.
They should have done this last year when the price was $3000.  Much of the damage has already been done now.
or opposite

Who knows.

May be a “buy the news” event. Any DOJ investigation will likely take (well) over six months, and I wonder if the price of bitcoin be *higher* with less manipulation?  
  
Edit: Possible pain for U.S. exchanges near-term, but long-term, how would it be to have NYSE type crypto exchanges in the U.S. and some more renegade ones abroad? May attract Big Money. Coinbase and Gemini already targeting this market.
Not really. My view on what was going on \(bull flag \-\> ascending wedge\) changed, there was a high volume \(1000 BTC in 15 min\) attempt at breaking up that failed, and I saw a chance to essentially exit at break even \(slight profit\). I took it. That's me revisiting my analysis and processing new information, not FOMOing in/out of a position. I stand by the original entry, and I stand by my exit. I now have slightly more fiat than I had when I sold at 8450; not going to push it.

As I said when I entered, I still lean bearish towards a touch of the bottom of our symmetric triangle at the very least, so I'm certainly being cautious. This was always going to be a relative scalp.
Doing the same \(caveat: I really dislike using 15 min charts but since I had entered on that time frame I exited on it\). Lower highs weren't forming though, higher highs were: [https://imgur.com/a/G5ZIvnL](https://imgur.com/a/G5ZIvnL)

And ascending wedges are characterized by volume dropping as well.
All of it. Almost added to be honest but I didn't. 
Can't know when it'll bounce or not. Also at my scale, day trading doesn't really make you much compared to the free time you enjoy by not working. 
Pretty sure if you do it for a living it's fiat.
How are you doing so far?
No, the strike price is fixed (7250 this week). What varies is the contract price. I bought one yesterday as an experiment, it cost me 0.000147 btc to cover .1, so roughly 65x leverage. The current price is lower now, presumably because we are only a few hours from settlement. The KO price is around 3600. So it's not bad if you need to hedge for a week, but over longer timescales it would be pretty costly.
lol
Hey Chewie,

If you make 1&#37; a day, you get a boatload of returns \(compounded\) by the end of the year.

Would you try doing this? So you can either aim for 0.1&#37; everyday with 10x levg or something like 1&#37; with 1x levg. 
I try not to *creatively* chart, but it's some hopium for my underwater short that I'm holding anyway lol
Stupidest "breakdown" of an ascending wedge ever. Probably just more noise on the charts.
The universe is not without irony.
Minor nitpick; the grey shape is still a wedge - triangles have horizontal tops/bottoms. Wedges have slopes in the same direction with the anti-directional line having a greater slope.

That said, nice spot.
Ah, I see. Makes sense. Thanks.
Well ya lol

I've just had people say it's representative of sentiment. Which it kind of is but I do think it's mainly bitmex following bfx
yes this
Didn't you admitted being short when you thought it was going to 8k the last time?? :-p
Damn that’s a pretty big position. With how irrational the market has been lately, it wouldn’t be impossible to retest 8,000 before testing 7,000, don’t you think?
Woah, am I off base or is that unusual leverage for you?

Babe, my patience is infinite.
I used coingy a while back and moved over to trading view but I think this may be worth trying out:

https://www.coinigy.com/bitcoin-exchanges/

It supports orders through kraken and uses the tradingview engine for charting. I actually may go back to it now that I think about it. Have to pay for it after a month.

https://www.coinigy.com/s/i/5b0726a4cd1cf/

using that on a tablet shouldn't be too bad.
Nope. That said, while it has a name it is a complete platform that has been developed in house using basically C# (there are like 75 lines of C++ code that deal with one particular data feed). So, the name would mean nothing to you.
I disagree. Primarily because I think the bottom is in, and I don’t consider shorting in a dump to be a good idea.

But yeah, I see your point
And timeframes too :)
don't act like there won't be people here bullish about a bounce at $5.5k lmao 
Kindly elaborate on where I 'missed something'.

I made no statement as to the status of these positions. 

In fact, I'm well aware they're closed. And I don't underestimate MB.
I think ATH resistance line is stronger here, if that one doesn't establish as support it's gonna get ugly. But those are close to each other right now...
lol
All you had to do was short to be on fire lately lmao the selling is insane 
:( I didnt agree with his long at all, it was extremely risky and didn’t see us getting higher than 7850. Recently, the big players haven’t been affecting my trading decisions I’ve been going on my own route.

And Yeah, I’ve been killing it recently. Started doing more of my own decision making VS following people’s trades on the sub. Ever since our first bounce up to $8800, almost every trade has been in the green. I’ve now made almost 90% of my trading stack back in the last few days. The last 3 days I havent had one red trade. Guess I’m doing it right now lol 
It's possible that the engine treats market and limit orders differently so they want to see latency limits and whether limits are being pulled as a result of the back and forth.
Hmmmmmm, not that I can find.

I think you can either wear sunglasses in front of your screen, or you're screwed. :(

sorry.

Ha \- brilliant! 
Wow they added a lot. Thanks 
I see it. Thanks.
The specific reason for the probe is. It could be focused on ICOs as the CFTC and SEC have publicly expressed a desire to investigate. 
"according to four people familiar with the matter."
$65M. They come from money though, so it's not like they hit the lottery. 

They made a hell of a lot more off of their Bitcoin investments. I guess the media just loves to remind us that they were involved with FB. 
I closed 2x 8.3 at 7.6, but earlier I lost on 2 longs, so I'm basically at BE on last trades.

Was stupid not to add on that 8.3 short when we broke 8.1, but thought it was too risky.

We're still oversold on higher time frames but this bounce wasn't too convincing. Still think we're about to test 10k resistance line but will bail this hedge if this moves further up. I think 7.7-7.8
I don't like giving lessons, it's just that it happened to me a least 3 times, so close, so close, now what if I could triple that and reimburse my loans, greed kicks in and I lose my ability to think rationaly and lose half again.
I closed it lol. I saw my target and let it slip up salivating about 6800. I think I can chill on the fact I doubled my stack in a couple of days. That was too good to pass up. Let’s see if this little rally has legs though. 


!short xbtusd close 8500
Yeah, you've got almost $100 of rope I don't have.
> Guess what... my predictions aren’t below the 6-9 month low.

Point being?

>I’m not naiv... I’m saying making such a prediction is ridiculous for now


It's not ridiculous. This is looking more and more like a big descending triangle that will break violently to the downside if 6K doesn't hold (and it probably won't after a 3rd or 4th attempt). 5K is the next reasonable target but that's not all that strong. Buyers *should* step up at $3K but even then, who knows? Real support is all the way down at 1.2K. 

Those are just facts about the charts. Unless something changes, that seems most likely at this point. Even if this is a giant *symmetric* triangle, it's still a continuation pattern from the upside and is more likely to break down. 

Assuming that $6K is the bottom at this point *is* pretty naive.

I never said they weren't real possibilities but the reason I said 5K or 3K is pretty obvious if you look at the chart.
Just HODL and forget about it. This market is crazy and this sub is beginning to reflect that.
I am not going to go back through your post history to prove you wrong, but those with decent memories know what was said.
That link leads to a daily with hundreds of comments that I"m not going to sort through.  It doesn't link to your specific comment.
You borrow BTC to short, and USD / EUR to go long. I assume they have easier access to BTC, since I have never heard of them running out of margin pool for shorts.
Always throw a stop on before you throw beers back 
If we bottom at 7200+ we paint a higher low. Even if we go to 6800 we paint a higher low. As long as that happens, I am happy. Not too worried yet, but if it goes below 6800, I am quite certain we go below 6k.
btw, wasn't knocking your post. I enjoy your content.

Huh, I never tried a mid-sleep dump. I'm adding it to my bucket-list. It sounds nice.
Is your personal descending wedge still on-par with its RSI?
That's good efficiency 
Take a loss on some, by closing a small part of your long (sell just enough where you then add the proceeds of your sell to margin).

So in bitmex it goes Sell Position (say 50,000), then you'll get maybe .5 btc in your available balance. Then Add Margin in your Open Positions row, and add the .5btc to margin. That will lower your liquidation point.
You won’t lose your initial margin. If you get liquidated, you forfeit both your maintenance and your initial margin
That guy has been calling $3k everytime there is a dip btw
When you feel like your missing it and want to buy more for more profits SELL! and when everything is going to shit and your questioning if this bitcoin thing is even real??!! BUY BUY 

And even the best trader fails a lot, it’s just winning slightly more then you loose that gets you going in the right direction. Learn your exchanges stop losses!! Best of luck buddy ! 
I'm not cheering for a drop. I'm stating a fact, that's hardly emotional. 

If you check my posts, you'll see I offloaded all my cryptos on the 8th. I'll buy back in when we turn around. 

PS: I don't even short.
Some people bet on the asset going  the other way. While bitcoin has largely gone upwards over the past several years, the past 6 months have largely been downwards movement combined with a large range. 

We hit the top of our tightening range and are nearing the bottom. While it's very possible we bounce off the bottom of our tightening range(~$7k) a drop below it would likely signal more downwards movement.

Even people who don't believe in TA could tell you that. 

No one who has bought low or sold high has been rekt since $12k unless they're on very high leverage. They've had a chance to get out at breakeven or in profit about 4 times now.


Have you even considered the possibility that we go below $6k? 
High volume node. Indicates a price area in which a lot of volume occurs. Usually found near psychological levels as well as horizontal support and resistance. It's harder to pass through HVNs because they indicate a zone of a lot of demand or supply. 

The opposite of HVNs are LVNs.

There are different ways to visualize these. /u/mandy7 is a great and friendly trader and knowledgeable regarding that area. Ask them if you want to know more about this.
Hmm is this not valid as well?

I sure hope bitcoin doesn’t hit $4500 in 2107
Much has changed since then.

It's very possible, but I think $6,800 will be irrelevant if the market gets down that far:

https://imgur.com/a/XCzvZZ4

If $6,950 goes by the wayside (and stays broken for a few hours), then there's a strong argument that sub $6,000 is already a foregone conclusion.
> 6800 will be the one to watch for me, but we just retraced 50% of the BGD and I don’t think we go lower. But obv I’ve been wrong plenty of times

You've been wrong many times because your predictions are not based on collective TA or a specific set of rules, just a single random indicator or no indicator at all. You said in a previous post that you want to stop trading because you already know how to do it. Do you though? Most of your trading posts are painfully wrong and based on very little. Honestly, your price predictions almost always sound like gambling.
We'll see what happens if/when we get there.

I could probably count on one hand the number of times I've set preemptive limit orders to enter a position without first watching in real-time to see how the market handles a particular support or resistance zone. 

I do it relatively frequently to exit positions, but rarely to enter.
I think the psychological impact of the Big Green Candle will reverberate throughout the market for some time to come. 

Far more important than the actual market movement was proving the simple fact that **it could occur without warning at any time**.

Fomo has always been a reality of btc, but the prospect of 17% gains in 4-hours incentivizes yolo gambles far more than in the past. 

EDIT: The irony is that it may not actually ever occur again (or at least not anytime soon).
Missed a double-down add by $6, should have been more diligent and more forgiving when trying to compare the resistance line on spot price to the fut price.

Double down to refill all the profits I've already taken. ( and I took a few panic profits at the middle of that green candle as it started going up, in fear of an *actual* BGD)
High five for constantly refreshing the thread 
Thank me if we drop without hitting your stop :P
Very unconvincingly. Under 7500 should be a clear drop out. This is hugging just under the support line.
Sent them your warning. They dun goofed and now the consequences will never be the same.
Considering I've been adding to an underwater short on each of these (that's still underwater), I really hope too (on the giving up). I initially opened prematurely this morning (7330), but have raised my CA to 7460. Fortunately the initial open was small, but now the position is large enough that I don't want to hold it and my main short from 8310 on a break of 7600. I'm hoping to market grants me the opportunity to set b/e stops in the coming hours. 
At least 7850. I probably wouldn't want to open a fresh long anywhere between here and 8K though, you're right. 
but why did you so adamantly reject the idea of going lower earlier but now you think it's not only possible but likely? 
On mobile so can’t attach it now, but it’s the big one starting back in feb.
It does make sense. They can change behavior and affect the market price by doing this.  

I am against most all gov't regulation of crypto, but cutting down on rampant manipulation would not be terrible for Bitcoin.
You know the song 

I fought the law and 
The law won
Wash trading and spoofing have been illegal for some time. Those things are a common occurrence in this unregulated crypto market. The fact that the market is unregulated doesn't make those things legal.
Sometimes, yes.  But most of the time, it doesn't work out that way.

And you can also use a limit order and then even less likely.


I see, good way to sell 100+btc i guess
Maybe, but it's not going to happen now. Not taking profit on your short if we get to 6xxx is as retarded as people not taking profits in front of 10k. We'll retrace back towards 8xxx before seeing sub 6k. Don't be a permabear, it never goes straight down. That's way too easy. 
This is the part where every time it drops I feel nothing
There have been a number of occurrences like this. The tin foil "it's all connected" side of me likes to find patterns, but I really don't think non-crypto world events have any measurable affect on crypto. 
Yea, even the polls I take could be all fucked up. I personally check this sub less when I've just taken a huge loss and am taking a break from bitcoin. So if I was naturally bullish and just took a huge loss I'm not going to be here to vote on the poll or express my sentiment, upvote bullish comments, etc
it was obviously manipulated down just like before it was manipulated up 

who's to say it won't be manipulated back up again
You either need capitulation or new money.  New money won't come in until breaching ATHs.  Right now it's a shell game between traders with TA as the rules.
But...$160 *was * the capitulation. You can't just start the price from there and say it we didn't have capitulation after that. 

It went from $300 to $160 like twice, nah?


It's not something I usually pay that much attention to, but it can be helpful in certain circumstances. 

The span between $6,400 and $7,300 was interesting, for example. 

If I recall, a large chunk of longs closed in the mid $6,000s, and a large chunk of shorts opened. Yet price managed to make a higher low in relation to the previous drop. 

If we saw similar behavior at any point in the foreseeable future, it could be a recipe for a bounce. 

But so far longs are stubbornly adding to their positions and shorts are remaining relatively consistent and/or dropping.
The second drop into 6ks didn't really have the same frenzied selling into a V\-bottom. No real reason to think there *has* to be one, as plenty of times things bottomed out then recovered without one. 
What your talking about is the opposite of capitulation...If everyone agrees the dump is over, how is that capitulation? Capitulation is when everyone (or almost everyone) gives up on hope of a recovery and cashes out / temporarily leaves the market.
K
It was much much worse in 2015.  That's what /u/significant is referring to.
I’m talking about “hodlers”.   Note the quotation marks.  

I’m not talking about people who have been in BTC since $4 and are sitting on their coins for the long term. 

I’m talking about the people who bought in around 10k end of last year and got a taste of “mooning”.  They held through the ATH, and didn’t sell there, or at 17k, or at 11.7k (either time).  These people heard about bitcoin late, through friends who maybe are real buy-and-hold investors.  Their friends are telling them “don’t worry, it’ll eventually go up again.”  And they want to believe.  

And for now,  their investment is maybe about even, maybe down 20-40%.  They think the bottom is in or is close.  

When this slowly bleeds down to 4K and their investment is 50% or 80% down, they will capitulate.  They will sell low.  That is the way this goes.  

Only once all these weak-handed “hodlers” have given up hope,  will the bear market end.  And it won’t happen with a flurry of activity like we’ve seen in the past few months.  It will be a slow, painful death.  

This isn’t my first go-round.  
I don't know. When we fail to make lower lows repeatedly on decreasing volume we are probably there. Just like in 2015.   
I'm thinking 1.2-2k as the 'perfect' target. All other previous bubbles have retraced to previous ATH, so 1.2k.
It would be a lot easier to program a bot to do this, but I might setup an alt account to post trading decisions based on coin flips.

Heads = long
Tails = short

Flip the coin every 24 hours and either hold the existing position or close and change positions based on the results.
no

Depends on your timeframe.

Perhaps no dimes, but you seem to have lost around 10% value. Unless this is a long hedge?

You can't say what exchange you're on? Ok...

As always, skeptical of people claiming moves retroactively, especially in this case where the opportunity to trade twice at the price was basically non-existent.

Hahah. No worries, I was just joking mate :)

Thanks man. We'll see...
It went up $100 in 1 minute
no such thing as CFCT.

you mean CFTC 
There are exceptions. That's what the word "usually" implies.
If that's the real price, so be it, I don't care.
Source?
What has fundamental value according to you ?

I think if we got that low we'd only tap it briefly and then rally hard. I mean the prospect of 3k bitcoin sounds pretty nice and I think a lot of people will back up the truck at those prices...I would. Even at 7500 I'm a DCA buyer.
A reasonable price is simply the risk you're willing to take for your investment to do x3, or breakeven at worst. 7k doesn't seem too bad in that regard, 3k seems a bit too easy, let's hope a longs failcascade provides that opportunity but it's a bit far-streched imo. Maybe a wick to 4.8? Place your bids...
Just how coinbase is investigating inside trading when they launched bitcoincash
That's good news. 
Well you at least got good taste because when the shit hits the fan and all the dust settles the last ones left standing will be Bitcoin Litecoin and just a very few others. 
Let me get this right, you're looking at a chart [like this](https://www.tradingview.com/x/J3Cv2gYZ/) and that red arrow is the article getting posted. And you think THAT explains the whole drop? The drop that started more than two weeks ago?
You realize when the username up top is different that it's a different person writing the comment right?

Surely you understand we're not all the same people? 
This is just another volatile day in crypto IMO. I see this frequently.

Legit taking into account that bitmex supports up to 100x leverage so you can create a $87 million wall with just $870k. 
On the way down it has always been stacked that way, even on the drop to $6,000. 
There are so many at different level prices, even if some of those are fake or get pulled, the difference is still considerable. 
Wasn't any need to delete it, haha. No need to censor your own opinions or dialogue, fostering discussion is always good!
It's not about being bullish or not. It's about claims / predictions being backed with substance. Put in some effort to make a compelling argument.
you are but claims for either ‘side’ must be backed up with some form of TA... or at least something more than that 
[removed]
Why you go long on a bear flag? Resistance is at 7.8, we just failed to even get close to it. r/r is shitty here.
Well, yeah, short here with stops above 7.8 is definitely better r/r than long here with stop below 7.2.

It's not after a drop. It's after a bounce that happened after the drop and failed to break support turned resistance.
yeah maybe, i have a hard time seeing it above 7.8k. think already topped out
[deleted]
True, it sure acts against all obvious indicators sometimes. I guess we'll just have to see. I still think this is a smart time to start buying again.
It is ludicrous to put long term price predictions out there when they are below the 6-9 month low

Same reason I shorted the other day at $8,150 when 1h RSI was at like 26. 

Buyers just aren't taking the opportunity. 
not him but for me it'd be because buying pressure is abysmal and if we go lower it'll be very uncomfortable entering a short.


in a strong move down rsi is often ignorable until the intensity of the move becomes so weak that it's stupid to ignore 
What makes you think we'll go to 8K? We just fell from 9.9K and any attempt to climb back up with low volume pumps had zero follow through.
Something that gives me solace is the fact that whales need for the price to go up in order to make money as much as everybody else, they can increase they're stack by 30%, but if the price goes down 50% they don't make money.

They need for the price to double once they've loaded up in order to make some fat gainz.

Its just a matter of time really
Here's the comment thread where I went long on gypsytoy:

https://reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8lpstw/_/dzhz6wu/?context=1
Yeah, that's what I did.
Preach
LOL. Fair enough. Added to my "to watch" list. I'll find time over the holiday weekend.
A few years ago, a couple of my friends lamented that Mean Girls was leaving netflix. Not a few months ago, my wife was out of town, and lo and behold, Mean Girls was back on Netflix. I watched it. It explained *so much* of high school. It was ridiculous.
I give up.
I wouldn't long the crashing crypto king because the redheaded nephew of a duke is having a good day. 
Oh Im not touching that crap, I was using it as a sentiment indicator. And why I'm hesitating to open another short right away. I was hoping for another little pump to short from there. I've caught a couple of pumps before in BTC after EOS starts. But past behavior... yada yada. Just being careful.

I appreciate the heads up though.
Sorry I wasn't clear. I don't trade EOS. I was using it as a signal of a possible return to strength for the markets. Definitely holding onto that gem for as long as possible and reaping the airdrops. I have started trading BTC more actively recently, mostly trying to get enough so that I can open margin shorts to hedge my total crypto holdings. My goal is to get enough BTC on Bitmex that I can hedge over over 50% of my holdings with a 10x margin short, but I need to trade up to that amount.
i bought most of it October/November, I already cashed out a bit from gains, I only left VEN in there because I thought it was going to go up with June mainnet implementation, wish I had sold it when it was $8 or $9 in January.

I got it at 0.22 cents.... feels bad man
I was, I shorted last night at $7,600 when June was at around $7,660 and closed this morning when it was around $7,350 and there was no premium.
No fucking problem
They aren’t symmetrical but the .786 and .236 are close enough, talking a .022 difference.  The .618 and .382 are symmetrical.
Very good question, I am curious to learn more. I have always drawn it from the low to the high, and the levels often being hit so exactly seemed to justify this.

I glanced at the link by /u/babies_eater, according to which both seem valid, but as they are not symmetrical there would be a bit of a difference.

Is there a commonly accepted "proper" way to draw them?

Yeah I'm just dicking about, we're going to goblin town. 
I don't deserve to live.

Just a thought exercise, man. To be honest, I thought I'd get more replies that shared your opinion because  mine was the dissenting voice, and I was just curious what others outside our circle thought. Thanks for wishing ill upon me though, internet stranger!
Cool, that's something no one else brought up, I'll have to read up on the requirements. 
PS: I'm also hardcore against screwing with retirement, but I was surprised how I came around to the idea if you can try to mitigate as much risk as possible.
Thanks for sharing. Luckily, I've been around long enough to see both sides of the (bit)coin. We're obviously not in the euphoric stage anymore when you can afford to play it loose and still come out on top. We're at an interesting crossroads that could pay off big, or not...and it's all in how you play it. (Or don't)
I know, i know. it's a combination of things thats all
Thanks fixed it...good luck my friend
so maybe they will go after tether to shut it down to protect US customers, imagine the fud lol   
edit: actually didnt they already?
Maybe so. Like many have mentioned, the weak hands have mostly been filtered out. I guess we'll see
If the top of the bubble was when bitcoin saw the most interest (as evidenced by Google trends, media coverage, and website traffic data) then 5 months ago is when the majority of bitcoiners "invested", thus it's the most relevant.  
> the price of bitcoin be higher with less manipulation

lol
Oh yeah I referred to the third try @7550 as failed bull flag breakout. When you look at the fourth try it definitely is an ascending wedge. Apologies.

Btw I really like using lower timeframes during volatile times. During chop 1h and 4h perform the best.
wow, nice work!
It does take a toll on your free time, especially with a 24/7/365 market.
Or trade crypto/crypto pairs and cash out to fiat. I'm much better trading crypto pairs than fiat pairs. 
More than good enough to cash out $1500/wk. Some weeks I make profit for 2, 3, or 4 weeks at once, and some I lose profits for a week.
Oh wow, thanks for sharing! I didn’t realize contracts were so cheap, though it honestly just seems to be insurance against catastrophic collapse if the KO price is $3600. I still don’t see much of an advantage to these contracts personally, but an interesting experiment nonetheless.
If you make 1% cumulative a day, you'll have all the money in the world in a few years. Try it. Don't forget to drop us a bone when you've made it :)
Pulled the trigger at 7530, let's see how this goes. I want to believe.
Have some patience. 

Sellers are le tired. If this is going to continue down without going up first, there's probably going to have to be quite a bit of sideways movement between $7,400 and $7,700 beforehand.
Maybe the bears decided to take the stairs this time.
Such a bitch of a breakdown. Like get your shit straight BTC
Ascending support is a bitch to short. Price can go up above your entry and still be broken.
Thought I'd try to be crafty and "aggressively" "trade" the "breakdown" - woops lol. There goes a hundred tuna subs. Another "fun" lesson. 
i use it more like a feeling where a nice BART could come, since I assume people are more overleveraged than they should
it was a bit  more complicated than that. I basically thought the path of least resistance was up instead of down.

But I also was holding a short from $11k! 

So I got complacent and greedy. I would have never actually shorted <$7k without extremely tight stops.

I was even telling people not to short basically. Which should have been a signal to me to close my short. 

I in fact *would* short here so it's different. 

The risk is potentially high in case of a random BGD but the confluence of factors indicating a BGD is not there. and the reward is much higher in the case of a catastrophic sell off.

Imagine it  does dump here. Where do you short? $7.5? Awkward, that's the middle of our range. Could work out though. $7.3? That's near the bottom of our last dump. It could bounce. 

$7k? That's the support line. You'd be putting yourself at risk of getting bounced out even if it does break thru

$6.8? Not strong support, can easily fall to $6.5 or $6.4 before bouncing. 

Anywhere lower and it just gets very uncomfortable to short 
It is unusual. It's twice what I normaly short with. 

So I'm actually short for a change against my cold storage, instead of just hedging my cold storage. 
Yeah, that's low for him 
Relax, it's just my trading stack, which is only 10% of my total BTC. 

I can exit at breakeven, if this pops back up here. 
I'm not your babe, friend!
Might give this a shot as well. Thanks!
I was very hesitant to short anywhere in the $7ks yesterday but after seeing the price action and the complete lack of buying here I am beginning to think the market is largely waiting for $6k to buy. 

it's not the safest of areas to short that's for sure, but if you consider the *possibility* that the bottom isn't in then a short from here becomes much more enticing. 

I know you think $7.5k is the fair price of bitcoin but you have to keep in mind that the market is sometimes retarded and goes from $1k to $20k back to $4k for ridiculous reasons. 

While $7.5k *could* be the fair price of bitcoin for 2018, it doesn't mean it will simply go sideways forever. 

Perhaps your "fair price" is more insightful than you even realize and we end up with a 200ma at $7.5k at the end of 2018. But that doesn't mean we'll be at $7.5k. 

The market is constantly trying to correct itself, which means prices are *always* wrong. So your assessment could be right but the market needs to understand that maybe $3-5k is too cheap before it can agree on $7.5k 

If anything, if you truly believe $7.5k is the fair price, you might be inclined to think we should head lower first so we can confirm that with voracious buying and a complete inability to go much lower
Sorry, but aren’t you implying that he opened long at 92xx before price went down, so it was a bad trade?
Yes, they're just $200 or so apart at the moment.
Yes every trade in the last 10 days has been a short for me and almost every single one has been profitable. Didn’t open 1 long lol 
good for you man! by the way the support i posted didn't hold at all.
Interesting theory.
I don't think that's accurate actually, but I mainly meant spoofy plays with 1000 coins, not 100. 
> Federal prosecutors are working with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a financial regulator that oversees derivatives tied to Bitcoin, the people said.

It specifically mentions bitcoin tho

What's the correct close value?
Sure bro... whatever you say

I never said 6k is the bottom. The only thing I have been saying since the beginning of the year is that 7.5k is the fair price of Bitcoin. Do with that what you will, I really dont care

Be careful with how you treat people you are in a disagreement with. I don't want to see you two rage out on each other.

it was a broken link. My comment seems to be somewhat gramatically incorrect though. I think what I meant was “you could close your short now and wait for a better entry” but I do realize that I would be moving the goalposts by saying that.

Just trying to be transparent, so I posted the comment

Got it, thanks for clarifying.
good to know
Has it occurred to you that you're only rooting for a drop because you want to buy in again?  Do you see the market dynamic there?  If you were a jealous no-coiner hoping for Bitcoin to go to zero (which it will never do), I could understand you a bit.  It sucks to see smarter people getting rich off a train you missed.  But what you're doing... ah yes, I have done it, my man.  Think about how many of us there are hoping to buy the dip.  Does that say "extended bear market" to you?

I've sold thinking I was going to buy back cheaper so I know how you're feeling, but let me tell you, the first time you miss out on a two-month 200 percent gain while you stubbornly cheer for the price to come down, it changes your perspective.  I have missed out on BIG money doing exactly what you're doing now, my man.  Good luck. If it goes down more, I'll be right there with you buying. But I won't make the mistake I believe you're making again.

[edit to add...] I do think the parent's analysis is valid.  We may see some intense covering pretty soon.  
Tagging you as another guy I'm watching :-p got you, coingurru, sloppy, chewtoy, and l14dy on my watch list.
yep... hodling is fine for people who can't trade, but if you offload at the top and buy back at the bottom, you can substantially increase your coin.

Worse case for me, I took a healthy profit and if I miss the bus (I won't), then I'd just buy at the next buy signal. 
I appreciate your reply buddy. I am aware of one method: horizontal lines drawing method :D..

Also there's volume profile indicator for paid members on Tradingview
oh dang, i haven't jumped in yet not sure whats going on. i'm anticipating short term drop but i could be wrong. hope the boat hasn't left without me lol. im not gonna chase.

edit: wow right when i wrote this a big fat red bar hope there's some follow thru 
RSI oversold everywhere, nearing bottom of our downward channel, otherwise fundamentals unchanged and no particular reason to assume BTC is any closer to widespread adoption and success?

Yes.

Quite possibly just a big short taking profits, too. 
In traditional finance, both bears and bulls make money. Its pigs that are slaughtered in between.

When those that yolo long with an irrational amount of their capital, they're not bulls but pigs.
I prefer not to name names. But you all know him very well.
Have to agree with chewy. I said if 9k broke we'd fall hard and so it's clear that if 7 breaks, it'll crash. 6 just won't hold against a third beating.
What about ATH resistance? It's somewhere around 6.8 now.
Can you please just move on with your life my friend?

I would appreciate if you stopped wasting your time writing comments I don’t read

I sold my entire stack at 13.5k and rebought at 8k

Feel free to lecture me on TA. I dont really give a shit

now get off my dick homie

also... notice how I didnt come out and call you out for gambling away your entire stack since December? Just drop it bro. I’m fine. I have more than enough profits to bet on a 7800 bounce pr a 6000 bounce and more.

I can sell all my Bitcoin right now and go retire. But I don’t because I think Bitcoin will outperform in the long run. If we go to 1k again, then you can say “I told you so”

Until then, let me gamble with my 5BTC. Focus on your stack, not mine
I've been saying for a while that it was such a perfect storm of contributing factors...it would be very hard to formulate those again. 

The warning signs were there, though. I mean, you saw them, even though I'm sure you didn't expect that move. I think *a lot* more people will be watching the long/short ratio. However, a lot more people will also be rolling the dice on pumps as you mentioned, so who knows. 
I don't know if it's something to be proud of...
I want to say thanks for contributing to this subreddit. I am new here \(in trading\) and really appreciate any TA in learning perspective :\)
Bleh. Waiting to jump on a breakdown/breakout to not risk anything, even if it means a smaller win, but this movement is really chapping my ass.
I didn't warn them about anything.  
I'm in the same shoes as you on these last underwater shorts.

If it goes above 7800 I'm letting it go and cutting my losses which will be pretty steep by then!
I'm confused as to what you're asking. I changed my mind because the market seemed to lack *oomph* on every push and quickly started to look like the same framework in as in 2014. I initially thought that Bitcoin was still the talk of the town and had lots of reasons to pump further. It's amazing how quickly that changed though. The primary thing that keeps me concerned is the behavior of alts. It's infeasible to me that the alt market can remain so inflated. The silver lining of Bitcoin going down is that dominance is going up. Until shitcoins bleed out a lot more, I have no confidence in investors in the space. It's embarrassing that so much time and capital is devoted to trading things that are completely valueless. 
I think this lobby/lawyer overcrownedss is a nice sign of this 5 steps of an empire theory, now US are at the last step
> The fact that the market is unregulated doesn't make those things legal.

Well it does, or provide me with a law regulating this. 
Agreed, I need to get away from the charts. I'm starting to see too many non-existent patterns, haha. 


This is why the long vs short ratio should be more concerning for folks than it appears to be. 

It's like the scene from Super Troopers where they demand the group of stoners pull over even after they're already stopped on the side of the road.

"We're already all long! We can't go any longer!"
Yes but those were bearish episodes within a bull market (2017) this time we're talking about ending a multi-month bear market.

I think it requires slightly more extreme measures this time, but maybe not...
your comment males no sense 
I kinda doubt sub2k.  It’s fine if it happens.  But I will not wait for that if the volatility is low for a long time (months)  in the 4-5k range , I will start accumulating.  
I thought more like flip to enter, exit either on 2% loss or set a trailing stop after 5% gain, flip again when position closes.

I could bet it would be profitable in this chop.
And you're not a bull? How did that happen?
>Perma
lol that's a different div. 

bull div is bullish divergence. when a technical indicator makes a higher low but price makes a lower low 

indicates weakness in a move down 
lol. I was really busy when it crashed and then I started pretending like I am not in a position. I am trying to not get too hung up with this trade, looking at the positive side. In the worst case scenario, I will walk away with some decent loss. 

The new stack I just bought is already up by roughly 3%. Thus I am still determining whether or not I will add this to my position.
It isn't a long hedge and yeah correct, the value is definitely lost. 
Gdax. I have no access to bitmex here 
:)
Go for it. Should be protected but i never really tried it myself.

Let me know what you find. Just don't delete the tables :D
> Fyi we're not even oversold on the daily yet.

I agree with you for sure. But you're talking about a longer timeframe. And that might not even play out. The recent dip on the RSI on the 1D could be the actual bounce. Neither of us really knows. But looking at the previous two dips it's entirely possible this was a third and less violent one. 

There is plenty of room over the coming days to push up. Which is what I'm currently trading. After that we will see. 
it's a bucket shop
and then...came back down?

Idk man, I can think of multiple occasions where bad press at least agitated drops.
Stocks and bonds. I don't think I'm making a radical statement here.
I agree. if we got that low, prices around 3k could be THE bottom (probably). But who knows. At the start of the year, nobody knew 10k, 8k would break
Clearly it was a single seller  (also a whale) who had a time machine, but also delayed 2 weeks to sell.
Obviously that article isnt the only factor. Insiders must have had this info weeks, months ago. I am not THAT simplistic
Happens to the best of us. Lets retain poise.
Ok so all of a sudden people denying the sentiment has been bearish for the past 2 months, begging for sub 7k, even sub 5k?

Is this not true?

Jesus, talk about hypocrisy.

Thanks!  I'm still learning and am trying to weed out the fake and legit moves.  Any recs on what to look for?
Cand you send me "just" $400k ?
Looking on the longer time frames we still have room to move upwards and still be in range of the bear flag. I'm not sure, usually when we've dropped significantly and stall for a bit we'll get a few random barts and chop before continuing further, so I'm hoping to scalp and get a better entry for a short while I'm at it.
We're also pretty oversold on the longer timeframes, I don't think we continue falling just yet. 
Maybe not in this move but can defenetly happen on the following weeks
It's unfathomable right now yes.  This thing is if BTC does not, then that is out of the ordinary for BTC.
Fresh money can come in to save underwater positions though
I'd prefer to speak direct to your father.
I am keeping a close eye! Don't you think that buyers could grap the opportunity at any moment?
I think we see 7800\+ before we fall sub 6k for the simple reason that RSI is oversold on the daily.

edit\- will study charts more and if I feel with conviction that 7800\-8000 is a sure thing before sub 6k i would add a small long position
exactly my thoughts too
Haha, that is pretty funny. 

I was just confused when I looked at the list, haha.

my apologies for my interference. 
lol very well put
Nice. Glad you got to take advantage of that after being short through an inexplicable premium for so long. 
Considering it is a retracement of a move, I would assume drawing it in chronological order.

Also, I just read this "The most significant Fibonacci retracement level to watch for is the 0.618. This is the inverse of the golden ratio, 1.618 or phi. The 0.618 retracement level tends to be the maximum pullback zone where fear climaxes as the final sellers throw in the towel and bargain hunters rush into the stock to resume the uptrend. On downtrends, the 0.618 price level should be where the final buyers are exhausted as sellers take the opportunity to unload their positions and short-sellers jump off the fence to push down the price and resume the downtrend. Some traders prefer to wait for two to three candlestick closes above or below a Fibonacci retracement level to confirm support or resistance before placing a trade."

So if you have it backwards, .618 is not going to be in the right place. 

But one site just says  to use it when you have a high and then drops, like you can't even use it from an upwards move and what follows after that.   I doubt that is true.  Lots of contradictory information.

Yeah, it was just a stupid joke. Sorry about that.
No ill upon you just a financially painful lesson in common sense :)  dont fear it pain is a major pathway for learning. 
What's 'a combination of things'?

i'm telling you that this guy spreads Finex FUD all the time. He'll turn anything into FUD. This is the same guy who was trying to scare people a few days ago, saying Phil Potter left the company. 

The guy is a dumbfuck.
What, why is that the "most relevant"?
Nice :]
The advantage is that your losses are limited to the price you paid for the contracts, unlike with a hedge short where you could get liquidated if the price went up too much.

I guess it could be useful for example if you were buying a house with bitcoin, and had to make the payment in a few days. You could insure your coins for a fraction of their value against a big drop in the market.

edit: digging a bit deeper, it seems that the KO price is always half of the strike price, because at that value the contract is worth its nominal value (0.1 btc). So in other words, for each contract sold, Bitmex has to keep 0.1 btc in the insurance fund to cover the worst case scenario. Currently there are 1,347 contracts sold, so Mex should have 134.7 btc in the fund. So hardly likely to bankrupt them. If the price stays above the strike price then they keep all the money from the contracts sold, which I don't see a figure for but it should be around 2 btc this week assuming my trade was average.
The only criticism you’ve given as to why it won’t work is that I would become really rich if it did work...
Dayamn, dat is a suhweet wedge
Are the only people buying atm sellers? Lol
They just tripped. Let's see if it cascades or if it was a fakeout
Fortunately (unfortunately?) I was already short before this, but agreed. At least descending resistance isn't far above us. 
Lol fair enough, sir. Thanks for taking the time to explain it all. I don't short but I'm also not buying here. If it breaks up convincingly and start a new trend I'll guess I'll buy some. Hopefully when you guys switch and think it's a good time to go long.
>I was even telling people not to short basically. Which should have been a signal to me to close my short.

Don't you hate that? I was telling people not to buy Bitcoin at $14k, but wasn't selling any myself :/
So then you mean 2x of your stack, right? 20x of 10%.
wow it looks like its really breaking down right now at 7420.
current price is 7450. Do you expect this to go to 7650 or straight down from here? I would be surprised if we dont see 7550 before we go down
Completely agree.

But personally would rather long an overreaction in a dump than short at the exact price point I consider a fair price for Bitcoin.

You deff hit the nail on the head with this comment, considering I truly consider 7.5k to be the fair price
I'm not sure how you derived that from my comment. No.
I expect it to act as some form of resistance now. Might bring a good short opportunity if we bounce back up to it 
Closed about 7510. Thanks for fixing man. This is what I get for giving /u/mandy7 shit yesterday about messing up the bot.
Lol hahaha
>The only thing I have been saying since the beginning of the year is that 7.5k is the fair price of Bitcoin. 

Based on what?

Also, you *have* said many times things like "I think we're going to push up past $9.2K before dropping at all. I can't see us dropping below $8K"... and then we drop below. I'm not entirely sure how you're arriving at these conclusions but I have to think you're kinda just making these statements up.


How is this hand waving? Do you not understand what horizontal support looks like?
Ok got it.  Perhaps I should have quoted his past statement, but am too lazy to do it.  However, I shouldn't have paraphrased, even though I was close.
"Panic Sellers never cease to amaze me. Some poor soul thought it was a good idea to sell at 8680 on this dip.

Anyone can look at the chart and judge that comment for themselves.
I mean, I bought back all my coins in the 8k range in February.

Sold at 13.5k on Dec 31

Bought back at 8k after the drop to 6k

I am currently just HODLing everything except for a measley 0.48 trading stack after I withdrew ~90% of my stack to my ledger a week ago.

I won’t be selling ever again I think to be honest and not sure I will start trading with more than my 0.5 BTC for a while. Maybe stop trading entirely
!long BTCEUR profit 6313 25%
Sorry, it was a toilet based joke.
Has it occurred to you (and I don't mean to mock you, I'm really asking) that most of us thinking it will go down aren't hoping it goes down but we just...think it will? 

and we're betting on it, which means yes, we'd like it to go down to make money. but you've got  the cause/effect backwards. 

I'm not bearish because I'm shorting, I'm shorting because I am bearish. If the charts (and general news) start looking bullish again I will be bullish. Even if I personally think bitcoin is a piece of crap (which I don't, not necessarily, although I'm not sure I think it's a revolutionary asset)
Why are you watching, and what are you looking for if you will?
Yup. You could have bought at $7k and sold at $11k, bought at $7k, sold at $10k and basically made as much money as you would have buying at $7k and selling at almost $16k.

People like to hold for long term but there's a reason traders love bitcoin- there's a *buttload* of money in trading the swings
Eh, you just called Bitcoin a traditionalist finance
It's going to be a hard pill to swallow for a lot of people, but $6,000 isn't some magical support zone that the market *has* to respect.

Bitcoin isn't dead by any stretch of the imagination just because the market decides it's worth less than $6,000 for some period of time. 

Sub $1,000, that's a different story. But an extended consolidation period anywhere between $1,000 and $6,000 would be "typical" from a "bubble pop" scenario. 

Bubbles don't just pop and miraculously recover in the span of a few months. 

I think we're both in agreement that the aimless chop between $11,700 and $6,000 has been far more surprising than a drop below $6,000 would be. 

The market shouldn't be as resilient as it has been, considering how violently it dropped away from $20K.
Sorry, didn't realize your comments were off limits for criticism. If you don't read the critiques, at least others will (and yeah, it's pretty clear you're reading my comments anyhow). 

Sorry you can't take feedback, bro. Doesn't mean I won't provide it though, sorry.
You were expecting an incoming reversal too.  Just not *that* kind of reversal.
You're most welcome. Always happy to contribute and help interested folks. 
Yeah, fakeout central. $9MM buy wall at 7500 on BitMEX is super bearish. Someone is trying very hard to hold up the popsicle stand.

Are you mentally charting tickers yet? I don't keep the charts up all the time at work but I have a ticker. I can visualize what's forming over the span of hours haha
(Bitcoin is 100% being used as a flight to safety asset right now, the question is if that has a measurable impact on price.) 
>"We're already all long! We can't go any longer!"

Lol, I'm dying over here.
Both drops into the 6ks happened in 2018 during, arguably, a bear market...Not sure what your talking about.
I mean the drop a couple months ago after our doubletop at 12k, not something in 2017.

And really, I'd imagine a longer correction / bear market is far less likely to actually end in a single sharp spike into a feast of buys than by a sharp slope down that becomes less and less steep then turns into sideways then eventually starts moving up again. 

Pretty certain that the end of the bear phase we're going through right now is going to come from sellers running out of coins rather than buyers overwhelming the sells, and that's not very likely to paint a deep V\-bottom.
In my view, the bull market will not commence and cannot without a proper accumulation phase which just hasn't begun and still requires a number of months.

Sit tight, it's going to get boring.
probably wise, getting below 4k is going to be a big task. The volume node at that point is huge.
So do you plan to hold your short until then?
I'm bullish when the market is bullish. It happened when i realised "I don't have to hold through 70% crashes" Long term i think we are going up, but Short term we are going down by a lot imo
Perma starts somewhere.
people call anyone who thinks we're going to sub $6k permabears though. Most people here would call me a permabear but I'm just waiting is all 
My description was better.
*Short-term goal is to regain the lost value if I can*
Okay, carry on. 
I didn't mean by me. I respect your work too much.
cex
Not before liqing me silly.  And what chart are you looking at where it came back down? I want to borrow that one
He's right man. Usually the market doesn't react to news, it just uses the news as an excuse to go where it was already wanting to go. If no news comes along to pull the trigger, the market will eventually go its way anyway (and people on /r/ethtrader will whine in bewilderment that prices dropped despite "only good news").
Tesla says hi...
Whales sleep by resting half of their brain at a time. That means they can still surface to breathe while they are sleeping.
The sentiment hasn't been bearish though. It's basically been split depending on how close we are to $6k or $12k 
SODLERS
3M with another 3M in BTC? That is pretty damn good. 

Guess I am the poor guy in this sub. 
I dont consider myself an expert, but here are few things I've noticed over time:

- Bitfinex has the larger amount of fake walls & hidden walls

- Compare all the orderbooks to see where the resistances are at

- Take a look at the ratio of buy/sells within a $xxx range (I usually do $300 or $500)

- Think how much is needed to swing the price one way, and how far would the same amount push it the other way.
No but a tiny bunch of just 40 customers with $10k each can create a $40 million wall. 
I agree with that, I just disagree with target of 8k. If this goes so high then I'd say we reversed the downward move and going short there would be shitty r/r.
Missed a mom joke opportunity.
Well that may be true, but between here and 6k,  a lot of money can be made with a short.  

The short term trend right now is down.  If you want to go against it that’s fine.  But betting with the trend tends to pay out more often than not.  
My question is though: if I were Mr. Whale, I was running out of coins and expect for a bull run to begin sometime, why not buying everything now instead of risking waiting a few days/weeks only to buy at a higher price?
No worries.

Incidentally, the link to the comment is one of the columns. This obviously doesn't work if the position is entered via PM.
I'm all for scalping some volatility on alts, but I'd be more inclined to short then 10% EOS pump for the inevitable 20% drop when BTC stops bleeding up.

Which it just did. 
Yeah seems to be a slight difference based on whether its a downtrend or an uptrend. I'm just confused when to decide we're in a downtrend or we are in an uptrend? Should I flip it if we retrace more than the 0.5? I'm confused. 
Thanks for the quote, that makes a lot of sense. That means I consistently drew it the wrong way around (luckily the actual consequences are small).


lol its okay it made me laugh 
Fair enough. I really hope I didn't plant this seed in anyone's head now who ends up getting rekt. 
I do not disagree with you :D
Quite possibly. If longs are increasing and shorts are closing, then the bulk of buying pressure is coming from shorts closing. 
If it's a fakeout then I'm gonna have to find a cheaper alternative to tuna subs for lunch
Well, I doubled my hedge so I'm 2x short from 7.5. hope it won't Bart me.
Yup lol its the worst feeling in the world. I longed the DCB at avg of $14k and watched it go all the way to $17.2k. I wrote a big comment comparing the DCB to 2014 and literally wrote "if I were disciplined I'd sell here and buy back in at $17.5k"

well guess what I did...I closed at $14.5k -_-'

 I think the worst feeling with trading is when my discipline fails me and I turn out being right...
Straight down is my guess, but we'll see. 
Sorry ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
It's kinda holding actually. I have my eyes on this: https://www.tradingview.com/x/X9N9Zinj/
Should be fixed now
But that's a good trade. 10%. Well done. I'm holding out for now, I think our failed fomo rally to 7600 *after* this initial run was telling. Immediately after the initial big pump, I stated I expected to see chop between 7450-7550. Thus far that's basically played out. Our downtrend resistance was at 7650 when we pumped. Now it's at 7615. If we can hold off under 7600 for another couple hours, I can set stops relatively close on my underwater short.

Honestly I'm somewhat expecting this to bart down after another couple hours of chop. 

If you can grab 7550 short somewhere around 4-5 hours from now, that will be a prime entry for tight stops (7625). 
I have given explanations before.

The comment you quote above is regarding the current price action, not my assessment of the “fair” price of Bitcoin

Nail me to the cross for thinking 8k would hold. I really don’t give a shit what anyone thinks.

If you draw the pennant on the log scale, the support and resistance line meet around 7.5k

The long term log support from 2011 (Bitstamp) is going to be at 5500 by the end of June.

It costs about 6500 to mine a single Bitcoin (closer to 7k)

7.5k is half of the price on 1.1.2018

I honestly don’t need a reason to assess what I consider a fair price.

Also, looks like the market just agreed that sub 7.5k is too low, so how about you go draw some lines on your chart while I enjoy this view
no worries, it’s there. I added it
you do realize it bounced to 8980 right after
and I never called someone a moron. I called him a poor soul
nicely played, sir.  Have all the coins you ever had plus a shit ton of fun money to travel the world? Not bad at all. 
I would prefer that the price only went up. I have no desire to sit around trading this. But if the price is going to go down, I'd rather use that to my advantage. Trust me, it's a PITA to whip out the hardware wallet, transfer everything to the exchange, and offload. Then sit around waiting for a buy signal that may not come for months, maybe years. But that's preferable to sitting around watching my coins go negative and praying I won't be permanently losing enough money to buy several new cars.

After I sold, the price went up for a few days, there's always a time you second guess yourself. But that's how this works.
I've shorted and won, but only after my initial investment had gone up by 1000 percent or more. Also only with a tiny portion of my BTC, playing with the house's money.  If I had ever taken all of my money out -- which I never did, thank God -- like mysql, I would have felt pretty terrible a couple times when I was sure it would go down, sold then watched it go up.

I'm not saying shorting is bad, but selling all/a large portion of your coin is pretty dumb because you can't always buy back cheaper.  Trust me on this.  This is the voice of experience talking to you.  I'm not poor by a long shot, but I'd be a lot richer if I had never once sold BTC.  

PS -- I'm curious to know why you think it will go down.  Do you think people will panic and sell for some reason?  That or a gigantic, mega-retarded bearwhale are the only scenarios that can really bring it down much, and the second scenario will be extremely short-term.
They are good at trading and talking about the corn. And some of them are pretty damn funny. I don't follow their trade, but they seem to know what they are doing. I'm sure there are a few more guys here, but those are the standouts so far to me.
I don't dismiss the hodl meme because there's some truth behind it - it works out for people who don't know wtf they're doing. For anyone who would have panic sold the bottom, or during a massive bull run when 10 days make up the majority of price increases, it's the best play. But in a prolonged downturn, it really behooves people to learn at least the basics of trading. (I know, hindsight 20/20 and all that)
Beyond the wild swings, if you're trading based on the daily chart, it's pretty easy to spot the trends and buy/sell based on it.

What /u/Stokinator misses with this, is that we can be fairly sure that selling at the start of this downtrend can be profitable later because this is still part of the bubble deflating. Bubbles don't wrap things up in a neat little package 5 months later. They take time to unwind. While people sit around and say that "this time its different", the odds are not in their favor that we can moon anytime soon. It takes time for a market reset or fresh blood to enter. 
I agree. I was expecting it to decline to under 6k the second time. The bounce on the first I could see as shorts were closed and the few that sold at the top came back in, but the second was just dumb and shouldn't have happened.
Chew, what do you think of all the other factors in the crypto market? Finex/tether issues, whales/bots, scam ICO, shit coins, regulation crackdown, etc. IMO these are the kind of shadowy shit that keeps Bitcoin back from a 'legitimate' investment.  Sorry, thought it was appropriate to ask given the stream of FUDs the last couple of days.

BTW, why do you pick Bitcoin as your preferred market? Do you do any alts or other securities? Seems like a guy like you could perform well in most markets (if you don't mind me asking).


Fully agree, if we break down the pivot at 6k you guys better be ready since 3k is:

* The next extension target. (Projected from the 20k high to 6k low from the 11.3k failure.)
* The 85% parabolic break retracement target.
* The large triangle breakdown technical target.
* A log support line

It could get ugly real fast bring your scuba gear. There is a chance for support at 5k so all will not be lost.... maybe. On the plus side, one million dollars buys a lot more bitcoins at 3k than it does 6,8,10,20k so less money will be required to make one of those nice green candles.

The questions you need to ask yourself now while you are of sound mind, "Are you prepared to lose it all and take it to zero? If not where is your out level." 

I might post a chart later but busy tonight.
>The Act provides federal regulation of all commodities and futures trading activities and requires all futures and commodity options to be traded on organized exchanges

has 0 to do with bitfinex. has 0 to with commodities. futures yes, but those are just a derivative contract 

Iranians and Venezuelans are both using it, agreed. 
/u/_chewtoy_ is on a roll today!
Yes but that recovery wasn't enough to finish the bear market, since we're still in it.

Maybe we need something stronger to finally end it and reboot the market
I’m swing trading. So not continuously.  But my bias is towards holding shorts for now, yes.  
So in all those years you never sold thinking it was going down only to see it go up like mad? You must be very lucky!
Well, permabear is a silly term to start with. But since we’re talking about it, I think a permabear is more someone who truly believes that there is no value in bitcoin, and there never will be value in bitcoin that comes close to the current price. Even a permabear/permabull can say I think the price will go up or down from here, it’s what that person attributes the rise/fall to that reveals their bias. (It’s just dumb bulls buying again/it’s just dumb bears selling again) 
ya probably better for him to learn what that kind of a div is so he can get a job instead of trade lmao 
It's better they are found by friends than enemies :)
you made it sound like the funding flip is what fucked you over. did you just get fucked because the market moved up? or because bitmex pumped for the funding rate?

liquidations aren't even affected by bitmex index price, it's the mark price, which has nothing to do with the funding rate.
Probably someone hunting stop losses.  Gotta be careful. :(
It's good, but Rich AF would be above 50m.

Just think about it, buy a house, nice car, let's say you spend 50k/year, which isn't big amount, you're set for about 25 years if you have 3m. It's good life, but far from Rich AF.
$3m is a lot obviously but it's just a comfortable amount to live off of without ever working again

It's $50k a year for 60 years 
Yeah I will be closing once in decent profit, I doubt we will see 8k as well but we might get close.
I've already spoken at length with his mother re: his BGD.

She stated she'd prefer to sit on a longer ratio position.
betting against it would be going long. Im not long.
i agree with that theory, i wonder that myself too.  Maybe tonight at 3am there will be a BGD Lol
There is a beginning and end point of a move that is going to be retraced.  If the end is higher than the beginning, that is obviously an uptrend.  That part is obvious.

This site seems pretty reasonable:

Sure and we both learned something with fibs today.  I should really use them more often than I do...easy money sometimes.
Hey if you're short from 7530, you should be doing fine haha
I hope you weren't over-leveraged and held strong, my friend 
*golf clap*
I joked around in the office that we had a crypto noob sign up for bitcoin at 16k as being the sell signal. 

Noob had dreams of buying a truck with his bitcoin winnings. Now he doesn't want to talk about bitcoin.
I may be overestimating buyers I guess.

Can I ask what &#37; you're up against the market since btc was $1k? \(or just YTD if you dont know from $1k\)
Looks like straight down it is...
if we see 7600 will you exit at breakeven and then start shorting at 7700 and 7800?
I love you.
Yeah Barts were in the back of my mind but that +100% ROE was too sexy to pass up. Thanks for all the input on this trades though. Hands are getting stronger every day. 
> The comment you quote above is regarding the current price action, not my assessment of the “fair” price of Bitcoin

But those comments are often dead wrong and based on nothing.

>If you draw the pennant on the log scale, the mean is somewhere around 7.5k

Why is that the fair value price? If anything that's just a convergence point before a breakout or breakdown.

>It costs about 6500 to mine a single Bitcoin (closer to 7k)

That means nothing. Mining costs are dynamic and based on market feedback.

>7.5k is half of the price on 1.1.2018

Lol. So what?

>I honestly don’t need a reason to assess what I consider a fair price.

The point is that a "fair price" is a rather stupid concept, the fair price is the *last* price because that's what the market decided. If you're meaning a *stable equilibrium price*, then I'm not seeing how you arrived at $7.5K. Seems incredibly arbitrary to select that as a stable price point.

>Also, looks like the market just agreed that sub 7.5k is too low, so how about you go draw some lines on your chart while I enjoy this view

Lol, you're beyond reproach. You think your musings on price somehow qualify as intelligent but they're just random dart throwing. Good luck with the masturbatory self reflection.
Not "right after" and you didn't say it was an imperfect entry.  You said "panic selling".  In that case, eeryone should try to panic if can enter a short and make 15% return in less than two weeks.

Yes that was poor paraphrasing on my part.  I was being lazy.
Exactly. Why the heck would I not want it to go to $50k? I could make 600-700% gains on 1x leverage.

Who doesn't want that? 

I'll take money over being right. But until there's some clear signals that it's going up, I'm going to be very cautious and assume we're in an extended *bust* part of the boom bust cycle.
I hope it stays down for a while so you and others can come to your senses and get some before you're buying back in at 3-4 times today's price.  You will never kick yourself so hard if that happens, and it very well might.
I only trade with around 10% of my stack, so I'd prefer eternal Q4 2017, but recognizing bearish times and trading accordingly is better than sitting there with my thumb up my ass getting pissed off all the time.
You can't always buy back cheaper...but for the past 6 months there's only been about 20 days where you could buy back cheaper than now. 

I get your point but your question was initially about I
his motives and desires and I basically wanted to say it has nothing to do with that. 

While you have primarily been burned by trying to short, a lot of people have been burned by trying to buy the past 6 months. 

And hopefully most of us have a plan for when bitcoin starts pumping randomly again. There is no guarantees, but you can protect yourself and assess risk/reward and act accordingly.

I watched my investment go from 200+% down to 90%. I decided I wanted to be more in control of my investment and acted accordingly
For the most part, I'm a one-trick pony. 

Apart from my decision to exit my long based on the Bloomberg FUD this morning, I almost never base any of my trading decisions on external factors. 

An exchange gets hacked, several hundred million in tether is printed, some country decides to ban bitcoin...these don't really factor into my trading decisions. 

I trade based on technical analysis, and that technical analysis is based on **effect**, not on **cause**. I don't care if bitcoin drops below $6,000 because an exchange gets hacked or because a group of whales gets drunk and decided, "wouldn't it be fun to sell everything we have all at once just to see what would happen!?"

As long as the market goes along with the move, I'll follow along as well. 

As for why I only trade btc, that's because it's volatile enough to be profitable but also established enough to play relatively nicely with technical analysis. 

I'm aware that there are shitcoins that will jump more than 100% in the span of an afternoon, but I highly doubt I'd be able to trade them with the same degree of confidence with which I can trade bitcoin. 
Yup, and now Turkey too. It’s just getting started. 
Very true. Do you have a dev instance? Or do you just yolo and do it in production?

PMs might be better from here.
I was assuming that maybe he can still generate income. I mean if you gave me $3m I'd feel rich AF, but i have assets already, i guess. The $3m would buy all my extra stuff. 
As a middle aged corporate warrior having the time to choose what I want to do without worrying about bills again is rich AF.   Fuck the toys. (But I wouldn’t say no to them)
Well, he does still have a similar amount in btc and can invest the fiat with compounding interest. Look at the entire world and $3m puts you im what %? 

Stawpoll, what is rich AF. 
You’re a wizard harry! 
Waiting to enter a short? 
Doubled it again at 7.6 ;) somewhere around 5x lev now...
Funny how both options were right: went straight down then bounced back up to 7550 all within a few hours.
nope
Probably. Might exit sooner. 
You very well may have been right on to close there. Next few hours will tell. My "strong hands" may lead me to closing this thing at 7920.
honestly at this point I’m done with you.

I didnt even read your comment.

Goodbye
Pretty sure only an extremely seasoned trader would have held that short through the move to 8900+ and an extremely experienced trader would have never sold at that price point in a dip.
No worries bro. I just hope you can appreciate that I have nothing to hide. I’m not a malicious person, I dont wish anyone a bad investment. I’m just trying to make sense of this.

If people hate me for my comments, I guess that’s fine. But I am not trying yo ridicule anyone for their trades, but I agree that the poor soul comment was less than excellent 
That's one of the nicest gestures I've seen from a permabull. So thanks for that. Most of the time they seem angry that anyone ever would want the price to go down
Just like it won't drop to the bottom in one day, it won't climb up in one day either. There is no fear about missing the boat.
I stick to btc because the derivatives market is the largest and I prefer lower volatility underlying with liquid derivatives that allow for large leveraged trading.

This is because while liquidity could be low in the derivatives, their underlying value is based on the spot of the underlying asset. So there's a limit to how much slippage there actually is in the market. In other words, I can take large positions and know I can sell without cratering the market itself when I unwind my derivatives position.
Cool, man. You definitely have a style about you that made you a staple of this sub.
I have local copies and still have the old site, i can set up a copy of the database there for testing purposes and abuse :D
very small short position. Will be looking to add at 7700,7900,8100 levels. Stop loss at 8350.
Nice. I pulled some margin from my large position and added it to my underwater short last night at 7600. 12x from from 8310 (June) with 80% of stack, 17x from 7460 with 20% of stack. Way, way more leveraged than I like to be. 
now its back down to 7513.

I think the best option here is to short a bit, add more to shorts at 7750, then stop loss at 8250
Yeah, noticed that.
Yeah that's totally reasonable. Just throw *even more* of a temper tantrum. 
It isn't just a "dip" until it stops dropping.  It is only a dip in hindsight.  

Anyway I wish I would have shorted more up there myself.  I have lost 5% of my funds during the 25% drop from $10K, so could be worse, but I should have made 5%.  I am far from a good trader, but I never accuse someone of "panic" selling or buying, because it makes no sense.  You never know what is in their head at that time.  You must panic to panic sell.  Being a crappy trader and shorting a dip doesn't mean that you were panicking at the time. It could have just been poor calculation of risk, reward and probabilities.
It is just arrogant to say someone is dumb to buy or sell at any time.  I do not do that, because I have been humbled by the market many times and know that I do not have omniscient powers to always be right.

But perhaps I have done the same with hodlers before, so I can relate to being overconfident in my approach.
I'm already short from 7350ish
I should've set the limits to b/e overnight.

Alts jumping this hard has me a little nervous.
username checks out
May I ask why you sold at 7350 instead of when it was at 7500? Not trying to be a dick. Just curious. 
What are you drunk or something?
I thought we were going to get a big red candle so I set the limits prior to any issue with overload.

Sold at 7500 then again at 7330 and 7300

It bounced up right past my lowest one putting me in a loss position in the first hour.

When it went back up to 7600 I didn't add to the short.  
I'm not confident it won't jump up to 7.8k at any moment.

it’s a berlin thing. “toy” is a berlin diss term and hence gypsytoy is a funny diss. All meant in good fun ;)
well if you can bear the loss then a stop loss at 8200 wouldnt be a bad idea
Oh, ouch! I've been dissed by someone who can't see that they're not an emperor and they're not wearing clothes. 

Seriously, dude. You really don't need to strut your stuff like it's special when you're just pulling numbers out of your ass like most people. Your arguments are not well defended because they're based on nonsense. *And* you can't even be bothered to read criticism of your bullshit. So it's pretty clear you just feel compelled to make random predictions from time to time and pass yourself off as some sort of oracle. It's kinda obnoxious, especially given that you routinely make posts complaining about *other* peoples' low quality posts. Look in the mirror.
That's significantly higher.. do you see that much of stronger resistance up there?
I literally could not care less whether someone believes my predictions or not, whether they are unfounded or not. they are my predictions, and I dont consider myself some kind of oracle.

The diss was just a joke. I actually like you and your posts. 

You’re reading way too much into what weight you think I put into my predictions, but feel free to carry on. I for one, can’t be bothered. I have better things to do than argue with people on the internet
Its not that I see stronger resistance there, its just that I see us hitting 7700, 7800 levels before a major dropdown. 

I think the best advice I can give you is reduce your position right now so that you can stomach seeing something like 7800 but also keep enough shorts to make sure you dont feel like you missed out in case we drop straight from here 
You don't need to argue, you can jsut admit that you make predictions that are much more ridiculous than saying 5K or 3K is possible. You just pick random numbers based on your "feelings".

Good point. I can't babysit this today.
I'll reduce position at 7450

Thanks
Days later but it finally worked 😅
du bisch wükli eifach zviel kollege
Cool story, bro.
