[Daily Discussion] Monday, April 16, 2018 -- TITLE
#New post: [\[Daily Discussion\] Tuesday, April 17, 2018 →](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8cts74/daily_discussion_tuesday_april_17_2018/)
Just a reminder that you don’t need to trade every single day like the people commenting do. I probably average one trade a week based on my strategy.  I see *some* people here opening trades like they’re playing roulette. Idk about you but I prefer gambling with odds better than 50/50.
Worst trade of my last two years.
Long'd (over leveraged a bit) a LOT of contracts at 8.25last night. Watched it go deep in the green through 8.4 and decided not to sell.  Then got absolutely destroyed by that 1m candle.  Thought I could hold overnight before getting liquidated (price down around 7920) but woke up to that depressing e-mail.  Learn from me -- margin trading is gambling and, when you're feeling cocky, stop trading.

-2btc on that trade.  Holy fuck, feels bad.

You guys have inspired me to take a trip down memory lane with all this talk of "manipulation," "high-volume pumps/dumps and low volume the rest of the time," and "it was never like this!"

I open my archive, and every dozen or so screenshots, I'm seeing stuff that would make you guys blush.

[Exhibit A](https://imgur.com/a/EWXMr), and I just started looking. January of 2017. Three gut-wrenching candles within one day. Each 3-5%, the equivalent of a $300 or $400+ move now. Can you imagine how many longs and shorts got rekt? Bonus: I spy ETH (that I thought was *wildly* overpriced) at ~$10.
After pushing up and up in a remarkably overextended rally from $6,800 to $8,400, the market finally decided to cool off a bit and give up some of those gains in the form of the correction we are seeing currently. 

How deep it goes should provide some very helpful insight into whether or not this is just another dead cat bounce or the beginning of a full-blown trend reversal. In order of bullishness, they are:

1. Bounce off $7,800 followed by a new high above $8,400. This would put the [long-term resistance line](https://imgur.com/a/8e62A) as an immediate target. It's currently sitting at around $8,750. 

2. Bounce off of $7,500 followed by a period of consolidation between $7,500 and $8,400.

3. Bounce off of $7,300 followed by a period of consolidation between $7,300 and $8,400.

4. No bounce and a full-blown Bart Simpson back down to $6,800. 

There is an argument for additional horizontal support zones at $7,100 and $7,000 flat, but I'd find it unlikely that they'd hold for long if $7,300 breaks down. 

At least for now, there's nothing to be particularly concerned about if you were bullish yesterday. This correction was long overdue, and is not especially surprising. 

As long as this doesn't retrace 100% of the way back to $6,800, then we'll have the beginnings of a nice, solid bullish trendline that could bring the market up and over the long-term resistance line in the coming weeks. The first point of contact being the start of the Giant Green Candle (or whatever we're calling it these days). The second point of contact being wherever the bottom of this particular decline is.

Ideally we'd see a 3rd point of contact prior to a breakout of the resistance line, but we'll have to wait and see.

This is the bullish case, and it's all predicated on one of the above support zones holding strong in the $7,000s. 

The bearish scenario is pretty straight forward. If the market breaks down below $6,800, then I'd expect buyers to finally throw in the towel and concede $6,000 shortly thereafter. 

If you are out of position, then continuing to sit this out would be my recommendation. The risk/reward on a short is abysmal between $7,950 and $7,800, and it doesn't get all that much better below $7,800 (aside from scalping 2% - 3% down to $7,500). Conversely, opening a long here has a slightly better r/r profile, but you'd have to be prepared to hold throughout the $7,000s.

I'm short currently from around $8,330, and will likely hold onto it until breakeven at this point. 
Closed my $1.2mm short from $8388 posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ccvku/daily_discussion_sunday_april_15_2018/dxeb02i), at $8022 for a total profit of 4%. About to head onto a long flight with no wifi, prefer to stay out. 
Alright. My balance in Bitmex is now officially back to where it was Nov 1st 2017. That's a few days after I opened up a tiny^tiny short at about $5600, that I added to and held throughout the runup to $20K. I survived and learned and now I think I've become better at risk management and order spread. It was an exercise of patience and control. Now, I'm at breakeven (in BTC balance, in the green in USD value) from when I chose to open a short at $5600
Oops. Opened up a short in Euro because I didn’t have my glasses on. I’m now even more confused 
Briefly on the subject of hidden bearish divergences, because they've been very helpful in pointing out Dead Cat bounces in the past. Right now we are seeing the potential for hidden bearish divergence on the 1h - 1d when compared to the bounce from $7,300 to $9,200.

1d: https://imgur.com/a/ZYl7o

4h: https://imgur.com/a/DUSpf

The only thing I would point out about this particular hidden divergence when compared to previous ones is that the Big Green Candle is more or less entirely responsible for the elevated RSI on lower timeframes. Had the market taken a more leisurely pace to get to where it is, RSI might not be making higher highs when compared to the push from $7,300 to $9,200. 

Anyhow, the market needs to push above $9,200 to invalidate the hidden divergence. Until then, it's something to keep an eye on.

Opened both a short and long at 8080. 

Stops around 8200 and 7950. Expecting a big move once a direction is established and if I get chopped for both positions I lose around 3%, a risk I'm willing to take.

Let's be honest, we're all just gambling at this point.
Last time I checked Bitcoin's volatility index, it was 4.40%. "Right now the price feels pretty stable, volatility should be lower", I thought to myself. [Turns out its at 4.72%](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/volatility-index/). Moral of the story is that one shouldn't be too hung up on how one feels. Reality is there, doing its own thing. And that it's always a good idea to take the time to see how reality is doing, because it might just be that reality proves how you feel wrong. 
Apparently someone just loves to buy Bitcoins below 8k recently.
Lol suddenly everyone in this sub is "bart this" and "bart that"... did the crypto kids learn a new word? 
Ok, last one for now. [Exhibit E](https://i.imgur.com/CMSy9FV.jpg) (original upload), June 2014. The elusive "Bart" formation, albeit short-term, but with an actual plausible-sounding manipulation narrative and presented in a humorous format.

My goal in digging through the archives was to ~~sit in my rocking chair and reminisce about the good old days~~ demonstrate that all the common talking points and market action of today were just as prevalent a year ago, in 2014/2015, and almost certainly earlier. I'm talking about manipulation, wash trading, pump and dumps, "Bart" formations, shady exchanges, price suppression / accumulation narratives, etc. etc. etc. It all happened then, it's happening now, and it'll likely continue for the foreseeable future. Your goal as a trader is to adapt to all these things, and even use them to your advantage when possible. Complaining and speculating wildly won't get you too far. And if you can't adapt, then your best bet is to switch to a long-term investing strategy and save yourself the heartburn and sleepless nights that you'll get trading.

I hope that enough commenters will see this that we'll get at least a *slight* reduction in the types of comments we're seeing non-stop lately (optimistic, I know).

I really enjoyed my trip down memory lane; lots of good and bad memories. Plus, I dug up enough ancient material for a month's worth of Throwback Thursdays! If you guys enjoyed them, I'll post some more soon.
[Exhibit B](https://imgur.com/a/BKHVu), November 2014. This is a funny one...all the elements of a modern-day /r/BitcoinMarkets drama, including:

* Terrifying 1,000 BTC ask wall!
* High-volume dump!
* Followed by a (literally) dead market!

BTC 30m Analysis:  

* Support turned resistance.  
* sRSI topped out and looking to move downwards.  
* Bearish div in play
* Downwards breakout of the cloud preceded by a bearish TK cross.

If the 0.236 fib doesn't hold I'm expecting a test of the support at the green box.  


EDIT: Formatting
Exited my long from 6487 at 8038. 

I feel we're shaping up for a small breakdown. I'll get in position again  after that.
My head is telling me to short this but my gut says to stay out of position. Gonna go with my gut on this one.
Shorted at 8,015. Thank me when we pump to 10,000.
Exited my short (8100 CA) for small profit at 8030. Bear flag appears to have broken up. If the downtrend line breaks (8070), I'll be sitting on the sides. Otherwise, I'm happy to re-enter around my exit if we stay within our channel here.

edit: back in 50% at my exit roughly (8040). Downtrend channel held so far. Will add the rest if we retest 8100, stops above 8150. 

edit: added the rest back at 8025. basically a wash on the entry/exit, so I'm going to continue to cite this position as short from 8100. 

This is roughly what I'm watching: https://www.tradingview.com/x/m6ZCxDsV/  
Do you ever load the 1 minute chart thinking it was a 30m-1h one and you are like When the fuck did this happen?
Tried to post this yesterday but it had a youtube link (*b/c I wanted to credit the guy @CarpeNoctom*) so the post sorta disappeared, and made me think I was shadow banned. Btw whose idea was it to auto-remove youtube links? That's just disappointing. How are we gonna post the DBZ 9000 videos? 


Anyways

- bullish divergence^TM

- price is at least touching the cloud with high probability (~8800-9000)

- if it gets rejected at cloud, bearish af, lower lows incoming 

- if it breaks into cloud, it's going between yearly pivot and end of cloud (11-12.5K) with high probability

- if it breaks though the cloud, 16K in sight

- if it breaks that (*ETF approval, central banks adding BTC reserve, etc*), then we've reset the [2017 bull run](https://i.imgur.com/ZiM19RB.png), and I'll be rich again

- also a possible adam & eve bottom, similar to one [one we've seen](https://i.imgur.com/Z17KcHA.png), which helps the case of a trend reversal 

- for the non-traders (*everyone here and myself*), adam & eves have a sharp V bottom w/ high volume (adam) and then a second rounded bottom w/ low volume (eve)

- this will take days to play out w/ surprises in between, obviously, stop bitching about a day's volatility 

- also, 8400 is not significant, if we get bitchslapped back to bear it'll happen around 9K, so i'll double down on point two 



And don't you fucking forget: https://i.imgur.com/sP8b91A.png




**TLDR**: It's either going up, or it's doing down


Can I interest anyone in a bit if FOMO? 

A cheeky long a few hours ago.  Nearly came out a few times but sticking with it for a bit now.
Added a bit to my short from 8.34 at the top of the descending channel at 8040 and 8025 with tight stops at 8120 (channel line looked like 8050 and didn't want to get stopped out on a wick) in case we broke out of it. Average entry position is now 8.2. 

Feeling comfortable for the first time in the past week. Grateful to this sub, which I only started reading the past few weeks, for all the insight. 
[Exhibit D](http://i.imgur.com/XJKYk29.gif), original upload (author unknown), circa October 2015. Blatant, egregious wash trading on a Chinese exchange (those are CNY prices) back in the day when men were men, traders were honest, and markets were organic, free-range, and GMO-free.

I'm as shocked and surprised as you are, really.
I'm on a roll now...deep in the archives. Somebody stop me!

[Meme interlude, October 2015](https://imgur.com/a/Mk4dQ). You know, those halcyon days of Bitcoin, before the invention of manipulation (but after the invention of dank memes) when Bitfinex was an upstanding, reputable exchange.
Not much volume on this drop
https://imgur.com/a/9vJAn

BTC 1D Analysis:    
As of now, the daily isn't looking that good. (This is a little premature since the daily has yet to close)    

 
* Bearish engulfing forming.   
* Price halted by the 0.382 fib.   
* We're beyond the BBands. (Always seen a pullback when this happened.)   
* RSI rejected by horizontal resistance (previous rejections match up with price rejections from trendline)  
*  There's also a bearish div formed from the last high (around the 0.5 orange fib).   
* Stochastic RSI overbought and moving downwards. Last 3-4 times this happened we witnessed a >20% drop. (Though I doubt that'll be the case this time)   
* MACD histogram bullish momentum just changed to bearish.  
*  Price has been increasing with volume decreasing. This is usually a bearish sign.
Question please; would this be considered a Adam and Eve double bottom? 
https://www.tradingview.com/x/GY479shw/
I posted this yesterday but didn’t get much feedback. 

Rookie question. 

Suppose you had enough of a specific crypto to move the exchange price somewhat significantly and also had cash on hand. The currency is low volume without much movement either way. Volatility is low.  

Would it be most profitable to place a series of large volume buys and sells of an equal value apart then let the orders be filled back and forth all day -or-make less frequent whale moves to force the price up for a day or two and then back down for a day or two? 

Thanks for any feedback guys!
Still waiting for a proper retrace to jump back in. Seems like it won't happen, or probably will when we retest the ATH downtrend at ~9K.

What are the chances we will see sub 8k today or in the following days ?
If you need to calculate capital gains from a GDAX fills.csv, I have created a PowerShell script to do the calculations. That is provided either all transactions are done on GDAX or you manually input any transfers and their value when they were initially bought or finally sold. Check out https://github.com/weedoveropiates/PowerShell-GDAX/releases.

I just released an updated version to fix some bugs I found. Remember to be careful what scripts you download from the Internet! If you understand PowerShell, you can see this script is doing nothing malicious.

Please Enjoy!

Any guesses why we seem to have so much support at 7980 right now? Hidden buy wall?
Feels like this could go all night. Currently 50/50 with limit transactions set for 8300 and 7600 in case something crazy happens overnight here in the States. Good luck, gents.
This has nothing to do with short term pricing per se, but I'm guessing Coinbase wouldn't invest $100MM to buy a startup to stay in the forefront of being a retail cryptocurrency "store" if they thought the cryptomarket wasn't going to keep growing and attract new retail customers. Unlike the past bear market where crypto wasn't remotely as popular as it is now, this bear market has made headlines and dragged on and I would think Coinbase, amongst other exchanges, would have every incentive to finally put a stop to this bear market.  
Haven’t posted here in a while since I have been trying to spend less time looking at charts, but this is what I am currently thinking about. On one hand I still feel pretty bearish since volume did not really pick up after the big spike last Thursday, and now we are falling again, but there is one thing that is a little different to me about this pump which is that it seems to have been driven by smart money vs. a big short squeeze like we have been seeing a lot lately.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/C1aUnU6g/

You can see that shorts declined a bit on the $1,000 rise, but they didn’t REALLY start covering until after the price had already hit $8,000. There was also media coordination to go along with the pump. Do you think it is a coincidence that news broke that [the Rockefellers and George Soros had entered crypto](https://www.rt.com/business/423559-rockefellers-soros-rothschilds-cryptocurrency-investment/)? That was clearly planned. There is no way this information would be released unless the people involved would somehow benefit from it. My guess is that Soros, Rockefellers, etc. had been shorting Bitcoin and had been accumulating for some time now. Also there was a segment about Bitcoin that aired on PBS NewsHour on the same day. That program is partially funded by The Rockefeller Foundation. Also, all of the insane price predictions for 2018 came out around the same time.

So now we have to try to figure out the motive. It is either that they want to kick off a new long-term rally or that they want a better short entry. I believe it is the latter since I do not see a ton of sustained buying volume, and Google trends are still on the decline despite the positive sentiment.

One thing I have started doing is looking at an inverse Bitcoin chart to get another perspective:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/nkguCGJ3/

Everything is flipped here so the price falling would be bullish. Based on this I would say there is still a bit more downside (upside on real Bitcoin) before we continue the uptrend (downtrend on real Bitcoin), but nothing would surprise me.

Also, for fun I charted Parabolic Trav’s tweet count vs. the price of Bitcoin. Check it out on twitter:

Bullish elliot wave TA update.

A bear case is starting to emerge as we approach descending log resistance from the ATH. I should draw up, but for now I'm just commenting on the bull case.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/4SVmnFoT/

You can see the last post where I projected we'd find resistance around 8.5k here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8bwesq/daily_discussion_friday_april_13_2018/dxb0ojx/

I got lucky on that projection, but it does seem to somewhat validate that we ended the third wave and currently retracing. We could go as low as 7,500. This is a bad place to take a long, but it's an okay place to distribute buys that increase in value as we descend down.

Using a DCA to enter a long position in this area puts us into an excellent position if we are going to attempt to break descending log resistance from the ATH. Breaking the log line with our fifth wave sets us up nicely for a slow (for Bitcoin) rise back to 11k next month and 15k in June or July.
3D MACD is crossing over to the upside. Let’s see if it stays up there. If it does for the next few days, it would be a very strong buy signal for me.


We barted yesterday. And there was a tell-tale bulltrap forming right before 8450 got rejected!

I think this is a healthy pull-back and I don’t anticipate too much downside. 7800 should hold, but time will tell.

Looking to re-enter a hedge at 8200+. Since I closed my short from 8250 at 8022, I can stomach a move to 8500+ without me.

If 7800 doesn’t hold, I think I’ll just short to stay sane
Who's this D4rkEnergY guy on TradingView?

He has a huge number of views/followers but does he actually have any credibility? All his recent posts have really clickbaity titles and they're all just drawing comparisons to 2014.

Not to mention he also runs a paid VIP group.

Hows this guy any different to Suppoman?
Updated daily stoch RSI crossing chart:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/Jd9segbz/

We did have one fake out (bright green line) when it bounced a day later and then recovered before recrossing and going down more significantly, but that was after the week long run up from 6k.

The chart says what I don't need to say, which is I would be cautious about setting up a long and expecting a continuation of the bull rebound up past 8400.


edit (from another response):

The overbought/oversold metrics on sRSI work very well *with* trend, so overbought indicators are not strong during bull markets, but conversely, an oversold crossover of daily SRSI was very good at predicting the bottom of a dip/start of a new rally during the bull run to 20k, though not 100%:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/Sh8T2GFB/
so is this the stop hunting dump before the pump?

or is it the dump?

nobody knows. no wonder we are seeing zero follow through nowadays.


buy order open @ 7866 for a scalp. 
As someone who's kind of / sort of flipped bullish I'm happy with this retracement. The medium green dildo yesterday was like someone saying 'I can do this too boys' rather than Thursdays BGD which was like someone setting a new trading level to adhere to.

I was up until 2am last night waiting for a dip and it hit at 3am local. Hit some orders on the way down and went a bit further but I'm not worried.

The only thing that is popping up in my head right now is that I hope it's not a repeat of the DCB to 17k and 11.8k. Because it feels like it a little, if it is then 6k isn't off the cards. But it's a gamble I'm fine with taking (for now).
I haven't been this uncertain on what position to take in a long time, definitely sitting out for this. Any opinions?
If anyone is underwater for taxes this year, the IRS is offering penalty relief as part of their new "Fresh Start" initiative. Might help some here who got wrecked in the bear market.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/LchpD3CX/
Exited my short at break even. Downtrend line is broken, been away from the charts for a few hours and I'm not confident holding what feels like it may break up. Haven't redrawn, but looks to be an ascending triangle on the 30m/1h charts. I'll reassess in a few hours when I'm back at the computer. 
Seems very Bearish in here again. Am I the only one seeing a nice bull flag forming on the 4 hour that has managed to stay in the channel so far?

Edit. Also, wouldn't this constitute a good risk/reward trade. Tight stops just below the channel which coincides with 8k. Then see if it manages to stay within the channel as it could move to the top of the channel or resistance at 8.5k.
Model price based on tx rate: 7-day average: $4131, 28-day average: $3768.

 Model price = 10^-0.638 \* (tx per day)^2.181 / # total coins.

Explanation is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2hyl9c/daily_discussion_wednesday_october_01_2014/ckxhy9y) with [historical graphs of price vs. model](https://i.imgur.com/HnZQ9rv.png) (last updated 2018-04-09) and [graphs of other correlations](http://imgur.com/a/7koaG) (last updated 2017-01-30). The code is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2oyrfq/code_for_tx_model/) if you want to improve on it.


**Accuracy of model and recent bearishness**

 Note, that this model has been doing relatively well if it is within *the same order of magnitude* of the price. That is to say, it is not a very accurate predictor of price, and to be within a factor of two of the market price (as recently) is effectively no strong signal. However, the prediction did dip just before the recent pop.

**Batching, UTXO count and so on.**

I have seen no convincing evidence that batching is currently a major effect to reduce the daily tx rate, and a cursory examination shows a similar dip in the UTXO network measure.
I am interested, long term, in alternatives to tx rate (given lightning etc) but I do not think UTXO count is a convincing alternative over, for example, unique addresses.
Parsing the blockchain directly for outputs per block is one possible alternative to deal with batching, payment channels notwithstanding.
I'm 25x leverage long.

Much wow. Such fun!
Adding to my long, stops below $7600
[Exhibit C](https://imgur.com/a/taRsA), two screenshots. Even in October 2015, conspiracy theorists were working overtime to concoct rich stories of manipulation to explain away perfectly natural market movements.

I don't have context for these two shots, but my favorite part is that they seem to be by the same author (judging by the annotation style) and that that same author has two wildly different and equally implausible manipulation narratives for the same price action.

The focus of this exhibit is the manipulation angle, of course...but you have some familiar chart elements as well (bart-like pattern and dump-followed-by-surprise-pump on the 22nd).

Side note: "just a trap before selling picks up" turned out to be an amazingly good time to buy. The bull run would more or less begin right after.

8k is a nice bottom - I can live with it.
"Bart" is only a term that got coined in the past month because while spikes are nothing new to BTC, the spike -> flat -> spike back down have only started happening en masse recently, March 26th being the first day when several happened in a row. Now they are growing in scale.

Why is this happening? Is this a result of the mainstream being mostly exited? Because while big powerful candles could happen before, there was much more of a flow to them that I am guessing was a function of the non-trader/non-crypto obsessed market making buys and sells that when along with FUD or FOMO. Any other theories? Whales holding a larger percentage of coins and so their pumps and dumps are even more pronounced?
If 6k is was indeed the true bottom, would that have been the first double bottom in bitcoins history? 
Apparently one of Korea's major exchanges (Coinone) is opening an Indonesian branch. Not sure how good their local exchanges are right now, it's a pretty big market, though. 
Holy cow I just nearly got faked out by that candle - had a stop set at ~8110 to close my short and open a long in the case of another BGD - figured that would be the price that would be the decider between a genuine BGD and a mini-pump and I'd be able to ride it up. The price reached all the way up to 8100 on Bitmex before getting smacked down.
The traditional battle for the daily close is on :)

This latest dump had pretty low volume...buyers have evaporated
Buy the dip mode : active 
Given the severe drop from $8.4k to $8.1k, the fact that we haven't dropped below $8.0k with conviction strikes me as surprising. Super low volume, yet the market hasn't been scared into action by such an aggressive drop.

I'm in a 'expect more pain' mindset \(not trading\) and just holding. I say as much, because I absolutely expected a significant retrace if we lost any momentum, and that sharp of a drop feels like it should've triggered it. Just a tad confused really. Just #bitcointhings I suppose.
This time if we get to 8400, I think we will pass it fairly easily. To me, it certainly looks like race to 10K.

I have seen the last BGD live (from 8100 to 8400), within 4-5 minutes the whale (single institution) bought around 3k-4k coins. I am sure whoever that institution is, has already done it's research. Otherwise, who would buy that much of coins to be sold at loss later. The price is not going down, this is what my analytics suggest me.

I think most people are shorting here, they might get trapped. Trade safe!
Personally think further down is the direction in the short term. Then we'll need to see whether a higher low plays out before creeping back up.

We've had an EMA cross and a MACD cross to the downside on the hourly, looks like a MACD cross to the downside is playing out on the 4 hourly, and RSI is still close to 60 with more room to go down. On the daily, yesterday's gains are almost wiped out by this morning's drop.

Also concerned by a potential double top at 8400/8800 similar to the 11.8/11.5 double top earlier last month that would make me pause to open a long here unless scalping.

Disclaimer: I have no open position having closed a short from 8250 and using Bitmex charts. Will try to sit out now until this pushes past 8400 or drops below 7800 with conviction.
Anybody thinks this is a good safe point to go long? We have already touched 8k twice now so may start going back up?
I been noticing alts are not bleeding as much this time when BTC drops..Is the sentiment changing?
Short from 8340 - what's a good place for a stop? 8.25? 8.3? 8.4? I'm not thinking of resistance/support lines. Rather, my main concern, as someone pointed out in the last daily, is that this move could play out like the Bart right before the huge green $1k candle. In which case I'd want to catch it on the way back up.

Guys, what is the difference between no-position, and 1x long leverage on BitMex?
https://twitter.com/DannyHallwood3/status/985843787237875712?s=09
https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/DXY:CUR 

USD value keeps dropping.

Do you find this a useful metric?
I saw someone asking the other day about early warning signs of an upwards break from the huge bear flag.  Here is some TA using Andrews Pitchfork that indicated something might be wrong.  There is annotations in there explaining the whole scenario.

The pitchfork can be a very powerful tool!  Hope this helps someone.
Good Morning Traders!

After closing my long yesterday (quite early during the day with good gains), I sat on the sidelines as the price swinged around 8300.

I was tempted a lot to go either short, or long, long at that time however didn't made any sense due to huge resistance around 8400 -8500 region (order book is a great tool at times if you know how to analyze it).

So what did I do? I placed a buy order at 8000 and went to sleep peacefully knowing that if the price gets low, some big player will hit 8000, fill my order and the price will move back up. That is exactly what happened.

I am now riding a long from 8000, not sure until when I will ride it. :) 
Funny thing is, if this goes below 7.7k, there's no covering shorts to give it some bounce since all shorters were liquidated during our pump
Monster hidden bullish divs all over the place. Bears need to smackdown now or see you at 9k.
We're just hovering over the bottom of our ascending channel established after the BGD. Let's see if it holds. Not trading this one.
3,000 BTC in sell walls up to 8100 on okex futures. Rule #1, don't fuck with the whales.

Evening all,

It has to my attention that the @bitcoin Twitter account is being exploited by Bitcoin Cash again. They're tweeting scam links and shaming bitcoin to over a million people. This only reinforces people's opinions that bitcoin is a scam scheme which is false. Please if you have Twitter, help me in  spam tweeting Twitter support to sort this mess out. 

Thanks 

Take a look at Bitcoin (@Bitcoin): https://twitter.com/Bitcoin?s=09
I dunno guys, this rise is looking like a duplication of the 7300 to 9000 rise. Both have now had 25%ish rises predicated partially on mass short liquidations, then roughly 7-8% drops. Both times we also had a large short FOMO as we approached a symbolic level (7k vs 6k). 

If we double top here just like last time, I am convinced that this whole pattern is merely just the whales liquidating shorts before commencing downward.

text book gently caressing bear flag, we will go sub 8k 
3 day MACD flipped green today. Usually this means rally, but last time this happened we went lower in days after. This probably can't repeat twice in a row.
We might be double bottoming at 7.9 and could break 9k tonight. My humble analysis. 
Feels like a big whale is unloading. Waits till price recovers and drops many times. 
I have a buy at 7900 I placed this morning, let's see if it hits in this classic US wakes up dump
Further downward movement should offer an accumulation opportunity today.

Targeting buys at 7810 and 7610 in case it gets extra-spicy. 
As planned, I closed my short from 8100 at breakeven (inc. fees)

There's really not much to trade here, selling has no momentum, buying has no volume, I'm not really interested. Hoping for a better price to sell or to buy.
I really don't know what to do here...
Can anyone recommend an exchange to margin trade on besides Kraken for people in the US? Kraken is relatively easy to use, I just dislike how you can’t adjust your positions, set trailing stops, add to your same position without opening a new one, ect

This is nothing more than a technical retracement, don't lose your shit about it. It's either going to be a double top at 8.4k or another heavy rejection at 9.1k that will send us back to the bottom. 
Just wondering since tomorrow the 17th is the final date to file your taxes if we should be expecting a bump in the price. It seems that is the sentiment going around. Just having an open discussion to gather thoughts on this. 

Edit: I do think the end of tax season will have a significant effect on prices. My 2 cents
Breaking upwards...interesting.
CBOE XBT/J8 closing on Wednesday.  Wonder what that will mean for price action over the next few days.  Anyone have thoughts? 
Hey all. I know the below theory have been posted by a few people in the last few weeks. But I’m gonna post my own take on this, just for added insights.

I’ve studied the 2014 bubble a bit, and read up on two seemingly important concepts:

1. Institutional/whale order flow
2. Wyckoff market cycle

Disclaimer; After reading up on the above topics, I do admit that there might be a degree of both “wanting to fit the pattern on the chart” and “hoping the bottom is in”. That said, I do believe there’s some merit to the below ideas.

Not gonna cover the topics above in detail, but I finally understand what “stop hunting” _really_ is, and how to potentially trade them knowing how institutions/whales would tackle this market with low liquidity. But here are two decent resources to start with:

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ffxSdX48VI
- https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/070715/making-money-wyckoff-way.asp

Wyckoff’s first rule is; the market never behave in the same way twice but rather unfold through similar pattern of different sizes, extensions etc. Keeping that in mind when comparing the 2014 below will be important, because time scales and extensions in my comparison are indeed not the same, but rather _similar_.

When getting into the actual Wyckoff market cycle, you’ll notice it fits well with the institutional order flow pattern. Stop hunting and liquidity zones is the name of the game! I would highly recommend reading up on it.

Part over-simplified version of the Wyckoff cycle is; accumulation (with failed sell-offs) -> breakout -> throwback (into accumulation channel) -> re-accumulation -> correction. The cycle isn’t necessarily a reversal or continuation pattern, it’s just a cycle that keep on happening on larger time frames from time to time.

2014 - looking at the 2 day chart, I’ve mapped out important points in the decline, as well as the Wyckoff cycle that marked the reversal of the trend: https://www.tradingview.com/x/XsgB6sEs/

2018 - similar pattern can be seen for this decline, but on the 6 hour chart instead. And here I want to point out the similarity to the Wyckoff market cycle that _potentially_ can mark a reversal of the trend: https://www.tradingview.com/x/Y9tqmDwe/

And one last note; a Wyckoff cycle can emerge in a trend continuation as well, as it did during Oct-Dec 2017: https://www.tradingview.com/x/GVo5l3Go/

---

As for the current market, considering all of the above, I would expect a throwback into the accumulation channel soon. Perhaps testing $7250-7400 before reversing into new local high through re-accumulation and then a final leg up where the cycle ends with a correction.
Live analysis and BTC trading, open discussion format for anyone interested.

About to be on a bus/train for a while. I was looking at the google play store for charting apps or a trading view equivalent. Are there actually any websites or apps that work while you're on the go, regarding charts?

Only reason i ask is i want to see some more info than what blockfolio and related apps provide.

Cheers
Noob question regarding bitmex: on the stops tab, what is the difference between price and stop price? The "stop price" is the price it triggers at and the "price" (limit price) is the price it attempts to execute at? So let's say I want to put a stop loss on a short to protect against a big green candle - should I put the limit price slightly higher than the stop price in case it just blows through the order book?
The downward channel turned into an upward channel...
[removed]
Has anyone done real research into whether or not weather patterns have any effect on BTC price movement?

Because it's snowing over here, and the BTC price is moving down. Would really like to get involved with this research if it's honestly being conducted.
Think Kraken is leading this dump.
Head and shoulders forming?

Have some capital sidelined.
How many mini barts to make a mega bart?

I'm out at break even. Too risky after not carrying on up earlier. 
So frustrating.... I got stopped out of my short on the long wick..... I looked away for 5 minutes. Oh well it was a tiny position and Im only out 25 bucks 
[deleted]
bears got trapped
If you buy now, you buy from the whale who pumped it up and starts to deaccumulate now. IMHO

Anyways I closed my short from 8244 @ 7944, will reopen if we rebounce here. 
I'm ecstatic about being back in the 7k range after bungling most of my trades in the past week. After learning how Bitmex worked I realized that if I had known about margin trading a few weeks ago I could've opened a very low leverage long in the 6k range with a low enough liquidation point that I wouldn't have had to worry about it too much (although maybe that's just hindsight, I guess I couldn't have been sure the bottom was in).

But now that I've lost a chunk of my stack I wonder if a low leverage long in the 7k range with what I've got left will be foolproof enough - maybe I'm just spooked from trading but it makes me realize nothing is impossible with regards to the 5-6k range. 

I'll be looking for strong support at 7.2 as many here have suggested. Though as far as bullishness goes it would probably look better if we didn't go below 7.5.

I'm hoping this recent pump has made people realize that just because the market crashed investors didn't abandon hope, they've just been accumulating, which means anything over 6.5k should be fiercely protected at this point.
Usually these big bears that short the European instruments don't punch themselves out until Thursday night.  Looks like this one's going to run out of inventory by Wednesday. Still probably a good time for a short (or long if you're willing to wait until Friday when they cover).

PS -- It's really fascinating that someone seems to be so eager to market sell mass quantities of Bitcoin when there is no money to be made doing that.
I'm still of the opinion that we are on the verge of the big breakout and it is confirmed. I won't tell my sources (its odors stinks) but that it is what it is for me.

I'm putting my money where my fu'ing mouth is. I increased my crypto portfolio by 60% (crypto value). The USD value continued to plummet as I kept buying.

I'll be keeping a vigilant eye these few days but I think we are not very far from the breakout. I already exhausted my financing options so i can't buy more even though i think the price is a steal.

tldr: we are going higher. just wait it out. it is going to be a bit painful but it is happening.
So admittedly, I'm not sure if there's a rule for a flag-to-pole ratio, but this bear flag is really clean. Just waiting for it to break and then off to the races.

What has changed from 6.8 to 8.4? Did more merchants begin adopting Bitcoin? Did Bitcoin find some use outside of gambling and hodling to get rich? 

The answer is no. Bitcoin is as useful today as it was last night before the dump as it was at 6.4 2 weeks ago as it was at 150 during the dog days of 2014. Not very useful at all. 

As long as the fundamentals for Bitcoin are piss-poor all traders should adopt a bearish bias in their trading, most especially after a clear bubble burst. 
We are still bouncing around in a giant bull pennant on the 4h and 1 day( looks a little crappy on the 1 day ). This morning, we got rejected off the bottom of the pennant around 7885. 

If it were to play out where we reach the top of the pennant we would be looking at a target around the price of - 8360-. If rejected, we could be bouncing in the 8000-8300 range until the 20th of April where we would look for a breakout or breakdown of the pennant.

Tweezer top candle sticks on the 1D chart. Let's see if the day closes with an engulf red candle in 40+ minutes.

wow, big hidden sell wall in the 8000 in bfx.
short term prediction for a beautiful bart to complete on the 6 hr
I find incredible how the number of shorts and longs is flatlining low since the big short squeeze, if even traders are deserting the place after millenials left, that's really depressing.
just 9 hours ago I got downvoted for it will go down under 8k.... got 36 dislikes. Seriously, is it my obiligation to be an idiot perma bull on reddit? Might as well write it as a rule of this sub.

If the btc price can be 'manipulated' by a group of whales, why would financial institutions buy in and put themselves at risk of being held ransom by these whales?
It's going down to under 8k. 
Will tax day + verge connect tmr have a negative impact on btc price? I tethered at 7.6k and thinking i might have fucked up. 
Possible head and shoulders forming on the 4H? Not able to link chart currently. 
Someone opened a long earlier, waited for $5 profit to go grab a subway sandwich. He opened a short for tomorrow's coffee/breakfast.
It's one of the most difficult things that I'm learning as a young trader. Let the trade come to you. Scale in trades, etc.
There are so many better things to be doing with one's time than staring at charts and babysitting short timescale positions unless you're a degen gambler gettin your fix ;)  

The less time spent the better in my view. Nowadays I plan my trades out fully in advance setting exit orders for profit/stop-loss when I enter into the position. Then I go on with my day focusing on other things. 
[deleted]
25x leverage is not your friend, man, especially with $15K positions. Sorry for your loss. There's a reason many of us keep it at 5x most of the time. Also, if you have a position that far in the green, break-even stops is basically a given. 

Zooming out helps. Crypto time feels distorted, but having a liquidation point just under $8K when we were at $6800 4 days ago was unwise. Take a step back, reevaluate, and *definitely* don't revenge trade. Good luck man.
Oh, look, it's another undercapitalized trader getting rekt using hilariously excessive leverage

25x leverage is gambling and it's not even the informed, card-counting kind of gambling, you're just laying down a massive position on black
Been there, done that. you’ll make it back.

well, at least if you don’t fucking trade with a liqui at 7920 when the price is 8400... What the fuck man? Don’t do that again. You liqui needs to be well below the 24 hour low.

You’ll make two BTC back. No biggie. I trade with 5 and I’ve been down more than 2 BTC and made it back in 30 days
I see your memory lane and raise you: https://i.imgur.com/LsuMgMH.png
Thank you.

Getting sick and tired of all this BS manipulation shit. It's not any more manipulated than it always is/has been, these jumps are just byproducts of a relatively illiquid market. Yelling manipulation is a complete copout and stifles actually helpful and concrete analysis. How do you quantify it? What evidence is there that the quantification is valid and not something else? It's essentially unprovable and undisprovable at the same time, so completely useless.
Those are futures (less liquidity) and the recent BGD was 20% in 30 minutes. But I would genuinely be interested if you can find other historical examples.
Are you referring to barting action among things you're saying have been around the whole time too? I agree w/ the rest
wait, how is the fact that it has always been manipulated an argument against it being manipulated just now?
good job Chewy
> I'm short currently from around $8,330,

Bet me by about 15 US. 

I agree with all of the above. Though I'm expecting a rally afterwards mostly because of the 3D metrics. I highly doubt that we will go below 7500. I'm hoping to exit around 7600.
Thank you, great recomodation again! 

Do you ever do minor trades to improve the entry of your position, or you never do this? 
"I'm short currently from around $8,330, and will likely hold onto it until breakeven at this point."

"If you are out of position, then continuing to sit this out would be my recommendation."

How do you reconcile these statements? Unless closing will push the market against you how is holding a short distinguishable from opening one at the same price?

Your input is always very much appreciated. Thanks. 
good short Chewy..yesterday some dude was upset he followed your short and it went up to 8400 LOL wonder if he closed at a loss..I hope he did for being a dick
Sorry but all of this just seems completely obvious and is entirely inconclusive so what’s the point?
Well played yet again. Better safe n sorry. Always good to take small profits which is what I have learned the hard way!!
Mind if i asked what sort of work is it that you do?   
Good lord. Talk about being around the block and back - like 27 times. No better teacher than experience!
Seriously lol'd at this.
I've been extremely skeptical of your posts as I've been lurking here since 2016 and remember your exit after the crash from 1160 to 735. However, since you came back your posts have been informative and useful, and I have realized not to judge you by one bad trade. Just wanted to say props for the continued quality content, keep it up.
If $9200 invalidates the hidden bearish divergence, it will be invalidated within a week. Personally, I'm hoping for a third higher low at $7500 but the latest dumper doesn't seem to have as much ammo as the last one which makes sense since supply is tight.
Haven't found any info regarding this and I'm still learning, so I'd like to know what generally invalidates a div?

Speak for yourself. We've had an ascending wedge forming for three days. Last night offered an excellent option to short 8350+, and many of us did. I was already short 8120, but added there.
both ur stops are gonna hit now, i think, this range is terrible really to set stops, either ride it both ways or just pick a direction and stick to it. 
Noob here. How do you profit by going both long and short? Care to explain? Thanks 
Sometimes reality comes in the form of a BGD AND SMACKS YOU RIGHT IN THE FACE. 

Volatility is up bc we had a 25% jump in price over the course of a few days. But the “volatility” we think of really is missing. Over the last few weeks there’s been very little movement outside of the 2-3% dildy every 8-12 hours. Price manages to hang within $100 ranges for half a day quite often now - consolidating for what feels like forever before (somewhat) picking a direction. Unsurprisingly, volume continues to dwindle as well. The BTC we grew accustomed to from November to February is gone for the time being. 
Its going down, so I would still trust that instinct 
Yeah, its a new chart pattern haha, tbh its been reliable in the weeks previous, same with inverse barts lol
Post some more, I'm really jnterested and I like your approach.
What about futures whats your opinion on them? 2014/2015 had no futures.
Yeah, totally dead markets with not a single trade were a thing before. They're not now. I can't remember the last time I saw more than a minute or two between trades. That alone means this market can move and react faster than it used to be able to do.
Nice job avoiding the bulk of the chop between $6,400 and $7,500. That zone was a minefield of indecision, and your patience certainly paid off nicely. 

Great trade.
Well played. This is actually a beautiful short entry. 8020 with stops at 8100 makes so much sense.
Rising wedge on the 30/1 Hr; some fucked up type of bull flag on the 1 Day slowly forming. A half complete head and shoulders on the 4 hour. We are at the bottom of the rising channel on the 4 hour. RSI is high. 

Hours of 50-75$ price swings and almost a straight line on the chart every day followed either by 5 minutes of exciting fun up or down with a BGD or BRD. 

I’ve never been so unsure of bitcoin. 
Good call. Head and shoulders forming coupled with the lack of overall volume following the pump tells me we won't stay up here for long.
So far it looks like its just confirming the breakdown of the post-BGD rise. If it makes it above 8100 it might be something more
It seems to be on a [downward channel](https://imgur.com/a/JatGn) no?
Or better yet, a smaller downward channel inside a larger one .
Similarly, a couple days ago someone linked to a daily from 2014 here, and I forgot I wasn’t reading the current.
I wish. I just load the 1D chart and think nothing changed since late December hahahah.
Often. Scroll back several screens thinking, well, that's not familiar at all. 
Happened to me today whilst I was half asleep lol. 
That rule was implemented a long time ago. It actually works quite well. We allow through the posts with on topic vids when we see them, but sometimes we miss one. If you  get stuck in the spam filter again just shoot us a message! We'll take care of it.
8500 IS significant', it's the weekly breakdown level.. too many people hoping for higher rn not seeing the reality 
I'm all in since the dip to 8k. No idea if it was a bold or stupid move.
I am sticking to my long @ 8000. 
Indeed--good entry. Remember we blew through 6900-7600 without stopping, meaning there's a very small % of recent longs open below 7650. I'm still expecting a drop to retest that range (7500 +/- 2%)
Everytime i am comfortable at a trade, everything goes other direction quickly. So don’t want to jinx it but, good luck :)
I like this guy.
Well on the daily we have more volume today than yesterday's green. And today is a bearish engulfing (unconfirmed).  So does not bode well for tomorrow.
I've seen people cite low volume as good/bad depending on whether we are in a bear or bull scenario. Would you mind sharing what this might mean? Does it imply fewer buyers?
If true, then that's actually not a good thing.

That means orderbooks are thin on the buy side.
Mini Bart back to the 7975 level no? 
Sideways for a bit more...
Yes, but only if it confirms at 12k, so we still have a long way to go.
If you're the most powerful player in the game, anything you want to do will work, as you literally have a crystal ball and just need to worry about liquidity. But you're not - so any strategy is associated with risk, and believe it or not, whales also hunt each other.

Both strategies you described have their risks and profit potential, which someone with enough capital should know to evaluate properly.

I just read through the code and can vouch that its safe. Even if you are not familiar with coding you can see that this is just looping through your trades and doing the requisite arithmetic. Thanks for this helpful contribution.
Because I opened a short at 7960.
I guess the question should be why so much resistance @8k. The fear of whale dump. 
I don't think Coinbase alone could put a stop to this bear market. Honestly, the only thing we need is time. Time for everyone's memories to reset, bottom out, fizzle sideways for a bit. 

After this I can't see it being that hard for interest to spike again, albeit with some updates (LN?), proper adoption, and good regulation/institutional money news.
Or you know Circle dropping $400M on Poloniex.
Also please stop proliferating this MM/mm for million bullshit. It's only used internally by some financial institutions because they're stuck in their ways. **$100M**
Do you have a source for that 100m? I would imagine Coinbase paid a lot less despite the original 121m investment in 21inc.
Assuming a bear market is bad for institutions is where you're wrong though, they short the drops harder than we do. It allows for accumulation at a low price ready for further institutional investment, bitcoin isn't ready to fly yet and only when it is, will we see the likes of our bull run to 20k again 
[deleted]
The inverse chart is fascinating. Shows your own internal bias at how you view each trend. And LOL @ ParabolicTrav
And I shall be yours.
I'll be surprised to see sub 8k. I say that with my inner bear looking over my shoulder and my bull side in a fetal position.
Let's wait what happens @12 and @16 cest although i think it will go up slowly for the next 24/48 hrs until we hit the log resistance.
you don't know the great D4rkEnergY ?? He has come to show us the way of the COMET NAMED BITCOIN oh praised be his words and wisdom!! 

D4  loves you
Possibly a sock puppet account used for PSYOPS (e.g. FUD / FOMO) Think about it, there is no way to see the actual list of followers on TV, meaning they can be just bot accounts to upvote this guy's posts.   Same goes for MagicPoopCannon. 

If there was an option to block posts on TV, I would have blocked these two accounts immediately. 
Ah, so I wasn't the only one who thought his titles were a bit ridiculous lol. "*Scary BITCOIN-Comparison - 2014 and 2018! You Won't Believe it!!*" I guess it attracts clicks on Facebook from people with "*Professional crypto investor & trader since 2017*" in their job description.

edit: to be fair, I still kinda liked that comparison, just that title lol.
On quick look it's basically [2 expats](https://coinrunners.vip/meet-the-team/) who started a Korean crypto community with some Koreans on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQfb-EyVE0jpYzf2zyYEl5g/featured). It seems like they started in October 2017 so still pretty new (and only on Tradingview and Twitter since February 2018.) They are selling "VIP memberships" on their site CoinRunners with "*Ranked #1 Top Author*" as selling point.

Overall, it does seem reasonable that they have a real following in Korea. But it seems strong marketing (clickbait titles, descriptions, etc.) to me too. Since I have only seen a few charts from them, I cannot really comment on the quality of that.
I don't read his posts, but I've noticed more and more recently that every time I go to tradingview, it looks like those "Around The Web"/"Suggested For You" boxes that are on most websites all over the front page.
He seems like a very strange dude with zero credibility
Amen, though one thing is sure: 
One of the bounces will be the last before the new bull market!
Careful with that, this is looking like it could fall off a cliff
> The only thing that is popping up in my head right now is that I hope it's not a repeat of the DCB to 17k and 11.8k. Because it feels like it a little, if it is then 6k isn't off the cards. But it's a gamble I'm fine with taking (for now).

We'll know soon enough when we run into the ATH log resistance.
Staying 50/50 fiat/bitcoin until this thing works out. 
Just closed, reopened and closed my short in the span of 15 minutes. I need to step away obviously. All I can think to say is: you can't trade every movement. If you think you're gonna miss out on some nice action - there will be other action down the line.  
Yea I’m dumbfounded rn
I'd consider waiting for a short at 8.4 if I were you, I'm in one  @8.3 with SL @8.2,  expecting a failed retest of 8.3 bearish order block 

EDIT: Not financial advice 
Whatever you do, don't short unless you're feeling very lucky that day.
Don't worry we need these naysayers, they'll be the ones buying our bags from us at the top.
?

Why? The good thing about markets is you can make a prediction, and wait and time will prove who is right. Those habits from democracy where someone being wrong is a problem for you doesn't apply, you can just buy what you believe in. 
I don't see it on the front page actually.



Anyways I couldn't really care less. It'll be nice when they see that they were wrong, but overall, it's not a big deal if you ask me. 
Well those no-coiners are the ones you have to convince to buy coins so the price will go back up.
Im actually okay with this. The longer it takes for bitcoin to go mainstream, the longer this bubble will stay in tact and the more opportunities we can profit. When crypto is sought by 10% or more of the population, that when i suspect volatility will die off and things will begin to stablize
300 contracts is roughly equivalent to .0375 btc. You would have needed to close your long at around $8,200 to afford one tuna sub. 

Your trade earned you about $.50. Give or take. 
one day a whale will eat all your tuna.
Can you please stop trolling.

Earlier today you said you don’t trade Bitcoin

Now you trade 300 contracts for a subway sandwich 

Below you troll some more.
This is really more ideal for a chat atmosphere. Might I recommend the Slack? See the sidebar.
We all know the rule that after 5 hammer we have 1 rocket
have you tried your method on the other side of the 20k peak?
The higher low indicates "yes" to me.
Hammer 🔨 time
Specifically saying "this time is different" without any substance is silly. But...

The drops are getting less and less significant and unless you're suggesting RSI *always* works as an indicator, the pattern will eventually break down, as all patterns do. So it could happen this time, not that this validates the people saying such.
But let's accurately give weight to the probability of tail events.
This is a healthy retracement™
Yep. This time the bottom has the Kardashian formation.
Thinking about closing my short from 8.3 as well - my only fear is that this is a fake out soon to be followed by a dump, but that may just be the events of the past few days coloring my perception, and I'm not sure exactly what the motivation for a dump right now would be... 
Bear flag on the 1 Hour. Short entry around 8120 could be a nice play

I mean if it drops much more we'll seem to have broken the flag boundary. And it's an odd bull flag since it's slanting up.
"Bull flag" will likely break down to set a daily higher low. Not really bearish but it's likely to drop some more


Feel like this is the last drop before the start of a bull market. RSI indicator is looking good, 1 week rsi is peeking up

I went the opposite way. See you on the other side man.
why only use 1/4th of the max ? 

(No don't)
Reasoning? You think we're defending 8k well? I would agree except  that our bounce earlier got slapped back down from 8.1... Kind of wish we had explored the 7k range more so that I could feel more comfortable opening a nice long here.
Turns out this guy is a manipulation-detecting savant; I found [more of his work](https://i.imgur.com/fc1Y2qG.png). According to him *an entire year of bear market* was caused by a Chinese hedge fund suppressing price and accumulating coins.^[*citation* ^*needed*] Sound familiar?
Just went 100x short on bitmex testnet and got liquidated in 1 minute. Damn manipulators!

Expect 7k.
How about the “institutional players” everyone is talking about — Just fucking with us minnows, shaking people out of their positions? Is this how they plan to finally “kill bitcoin?” 
Arsonbunny believes exchanges are manipulating the price to earn revenue from liquidations.

No, it's not new, we saw these years ago. I used to call them block patterns to myself.
Exchanges  (finex) stop hunting.  It’s free fucking money. 
This is not the first time I've read someone insinuating that Bitcoin always makes V bottoms.

While I can't remember a significant double bottom in recent memory, the bounce off of ~$200 was a triple bottom.
IDR 110,376,822 this is what 1 BTC will cost in local currency.

We may go back up. The downtrend resistance in this mini-bear flag was at 8050 and we popped way above that. May just be recharging. ?
You've failed Your Highness. I am a Bear, like my father before me.

If your hodling for the long term, short term moves are just some additional entertainment. 
Two times I opened high valued longs in 11.7 range during the last runs, got liquidated both times.

I think you need to calm down a bit, relax, analyze your situation, learn from what you have experienced, never to make the same mistakes again, invest only what you can afford to loose, be patient, have weekly targets to make gains rather than quick gains which mostly result in losses.

All the best! 


I think there are many like you (at least I am like you) and this hesitancy is ultimately handicapping any bull run attempt, as I am not entering back my fiat into crypto until I am more thoroughly convinced a new large bull movement is about to occur (we break the log resistance from ATH) or that the bear is more or less fully satiated and discounts are available. I am fine missing out on some of the early part of a bull run with my risk profile.
It doesn't even sound like you are having fun, just make a diverse portfolio, rebalance once a month, and enjoy making more money than if you were trading.  You can get new hobbies that bring you joy.
It means uncertainty. It's a healthy retrace if it doesn't trigger a dump. 
Buy the top: detected
this mode was active one weeks ago
I'm not surprised at all. The alts will tell you where this market is going. They started recovering first and haven't been scared on these latest drops. You can see it in the price action. The dumps don't have follow through. Just like all the bears said on the way down DCB "The bounces don't have any follow through", this is now true of the dumps. Dead Cat Dump? 

Bears were hoping on sub-6k to accumulate, but because of the high volume breakout and the strong bottom we made they are forced to accumulate here. So we will probably consolidate in this price range for a few more days until we have enough strength to break through the 1d cloud. This is the time to scalp or sit on your hands.
> Just a tad confused really.

Every honest Bitcoin trader.
um. As far as i can see, leverage is frozen right now. No one dares to move. Wise choice.
Personally i believe its going to breakdown even more
I would think so, just buy in half so if it does run up you will not regret it. If it drop lower then dca
nobody frikkin knows, its a coin toss really.

if i were you i would open an equally sized short and long here.

the trend is still downwards, but could see a random ass green candle taking us upto 9k even.

so this way, your long doubles in size if on medium levg. and you can use this to add to your short when we lose steam.

on the flip side, if it were to dump here you can always close your long if we go below 7.6k,
No ! The big money who bought in the 6.8 range took profit at 8.4, what's left to support the price? Your grand-ma?
I keep a close eye on alts, since it's the only trading method I use to accumulate more bitcoins. The alts I have paid attention to bottomed out in SAT value after the second drop in the $6600 range. Once BTC started chopping in the $6600-$7100 range, it started regaining most of the SATs that it lost in March/April and those lows have become strong supports even when BTC is mooning or dumping (which previously used to be dumping grounds for alts) Also many of the alts, at least on binance, have more 24hr BTC volume than GDAX. 

My thinking is, just how I was in 2014~ holding BTC, many alt holders, especially those who got in Dec/Jan near ATH are not selling since they are down so much. If you visit the alt sub or /cryptocurrency you will see a lot of "would rather watch it go to zero than sell now" comments. Now that alts have proven in the last couple weeks to outpace BTC in regaining some value, I think many alt holders are gaining confidence and simply are not willing to sell.

I don't see the strong alts hitting lower lows unless BTC dips below $7200 which many, including myself, would invalidate this last BGD pump. 
they bleed more or less the same in average. the BTC dominance was 24 hours ago 42,23 and is now 42,21 according to coinmarketcap
I'm actually gaining sats from the BTC drop.  Certainly indicates people aren't dropping their alts immediately now.
Market sentiment towards Bitcoin has changed. People want moonshots, bitcoin price (and history) psychologically is against moonshot (near term 10X gains). Therefore they go for alts. Also as I've said here before, Alts are more appealing (and welcoming) to new investors. Also Alts have faces, those who can be held responsible (and nagged to). BTC has none, and most normies find that scary. Idealism aside, I find it scary what happens to the market when the coins in the satoshi wallets moves. 
i opened a short at 8.25 currently got stops at 8.2, tbh might close it nowish if it struggles to get under 8k ill just take this small scalp
Not sure why you're getting downvoted...the post is on-topic, and while the fear may be unfounded, "good place for a stop" is a reasonable question.
If you are too greedy with the stops in that scenario you will have a lot of slippage. I would put it in 8100 . Not because Im bullish, but because you may be forced to settle much higher in that case. Look at how big the wick is in the big green one.

No need to worry about a stop, this shit is gonna dump hard.

This is the nomenclature I assume for this sub

no position = HODLing BTC, i.e. no position open on Mex. The value of your portfolio in BTC is flat.

flat/hedge = in Fiat (sold), equivalent to 1x short on BitMex with the whole value of your trading stack. The value of your portfolio in USD is flat.

short = you have an open short position. This could less than the notional value of your trading stack, in which case you are 1x long the difference between portfolio and position size. In any case, you stand to lose BTC if the price were to go up

long = Basically, more than 1x long. If the price were to go down, you would lose BTC


1x is, in reality, 2x. Your underlying btc + equal amount of borrowed btc.
If you go 1x long then you are in effect borrowing fiat to buy coin. So if the price of a coin goes up or down your margin will adjust accordingly. Leverage only affects the amount of margin required and the liquidation price.

Bitcoin’s price moves way too violently for this to have any affect. Dollar may be losing value but unless we wake up to a 200$ big mac tomorrow, it won’t affect btc price so much that you’d notice it. 
time to buy gold
You lucky bugger.
> order book is a great tool at times if you know how to analyze it

You mean manipulated crypto order books are a reliable indicator.....hmmmmm
There's an undeniable hidden bullish div on the 1w, but other than that I don't see any hidden bullish divergence on lower timeframes. 

1w RSI fell to around 40 during the drop to $6,400 but only got down to around 44 during the drop to $6,000 back in February.

EDIT: There is definitely standard bullish divergence on lower timeframes though. The dump from $8,400 to $8,000 dropped RSI lower on the 15m and 30m than the drop from $8,000 to $7,900 did. Lower lows on price but higher lows on RSI.

Bitcoin's been attacked ever since I can remember. We've had the jealous no-coiners w/ their repetitive slander, the institutions threatened by BTC, the shitcoiners who support scams b/c they missed the BTC boat, the retarded "*forget Bitcoin, blockchain is the real innovation*" crowd trying to downplay BTC and leech off its innovation, the Ethereum "flippening" crowd trying hard to take the spotlight away form BTC, prominent devs who rage quit and turned against the movement, a scammer who pretends to be Bitcoin's creator, miners with significant hashpower that tried to steer BTC development, a group of authoritarian figures making back-door agreements in an attempt to centralize bitcoin development, memepool being spammed to purposely raise fees, LN channels being spammed to discourage progress, an attempt to divide the community with straight up lies and propaganda, r.btc and r.buttcoin trying to spread the propaganda, social engineering campaigns funded by roger ver, the whole XT/Classic/BU obstructionism which finally led to Bitcoin Cash, where you'd think they'd be happy having their own fork but instead they spend all their energy spreading anti-bitcoin propaganda using bitcoin.com and @Bitcoin in an attempt to steal the Bitcoin brand while discrediting the real Bitcoin. This is where the saying "FUD" comes from, which hilariously is borrowed by shitcoiners when they haven't experienced even a fraction of the shit Bitcoin gets. Where the hell is the "Ethereum Classic is the real Ethereum" propaganda? You see Vitalik on his high horse pointing out how "his community" gets along with the ETC community. Ethereum has it fucking easy, and most of the other shitcoins haven't even grown out of their diapers. They would be in fetal position if they got even 10% of the shit Bitcoin has been getting for the last decade. Listen buddy, you should be fucking glad Bitcoin is battle test and proven itself to be resilient over and over again. Why the fuck would I trust my millions in garbage like Verge or 99% of the other shitcoins that would be crushed if they were in Bitcoin's shoes. Bitcoin is hands down the most shit-on and the most resilient crypto there is, by far. We have been challenged by almost everything you can imagine and we're still going strong. 


On another note... this is hilarious:

You do know that bitcoin is not owned by anyone right? They can do whatever they want, so many cry baby’s about this twitter account , censorship is never the answer, it goes completely against bitcoin main point of decentralization. Prove that in fact your version of bitcoin is better and that’s all you need to do 
You can also spam Twitter support that this guy is not really God:

On the bull case, you could liken it to the first 11.8k top - there we fell off at the linear ATH resistance level. This time we fell off at a log support-turned-resistance. If we can fall down to 7.2-7.5k and then climb back over the next week, that resistance will cross with the ATH resistance and could set up an attempt at the log ATH resistance at 8.4k similar to the second 11.8k attempt where we failed originally. Maybe the situation would be different enough on that attempt to where we break through then.

Or this was all just a throwback to confirm the log support we broke initially at around 7.7k as new resistance and we continue lower.
* How does a double top point to liquidating shorts? IMO, it is liquidating longs & commencing shorts.
Why wouldn't we? that would be 5% move from here. 
Bitcoin does that sort of thing all the time.
Yes I do. Because the "short liquidation" was extremely sketchy and driven 100% by bitfinex. Lately most of the volume has been margin trading according to bitfinex, which means there is very little cash inflow. Sustained bull runs need new money.
Yes. 7400-7600 .5-.618 fib retrace and it was previous resistance.
What is the difference between today's textbook bear flag and yesterday's textbook bullflag? 
With this being the 3 day chart, wouldn't this just be leading on from the recent massive green dildo and subsequent pump?

Surely the 1, 4 and 6 hour time frames are more appropriate to pay attention to at the moment, which have all crossed to the downside?
Say that to the Kobayashi hour.
> This probably can't repeat twice in a row.

That's a pretty arbitrary assessment.
....wat?

"We just fell 5%. Look's like we're about to break out of a 4-month bear market."
Possible double bottom. 64% break down at this point, but we've been breaking up on double bottoms at this point lately.

If we break down I don't think it will go under 7.5k... and then we reverse back up to (maybe) break log resistance.
Personally I think we'll see 7600 before we'd see 9k.
Feels like a big whale is accumulating. 

Buy up slowly in small amounts and occasionally dump to bring the price back down in order to continue accumulating.

(Not trying to be a dick, I just think most of these things can be interpreted either way).
I would move that down while you still can. You underestimate how angry the US is on Mondays
I think it will get filled, whether it's a good thing or not, remains to be seen. Its looking like a descending channel on lower time frames. 
We bottom at $7.5 either today or tomorrow, then it's off to the races.
Sometimes just NOTHING is a good choice - watch, relax :)

The first part of your statement completely contradicts the second one, I'm lost.


It will be as significant as the Chinese New Year and the Wall Street Bonuses 
The average tax refund for Americans is between $2,500 and $3,000, [depending on where in the US they reside](http://www.businessinsider.com/tax-refund-average-by-state-2018-1).

According to bitcoin.com, [around 5% of Americans have invested in Bitcoin](https://news.bitcoin.com/survey-60-of-americans-have-heard-of-bitcoin-5-own/).

So, assuming the 5% of Americans already invested were to roll 100% of their tax return into bitcoin (very doubtful), that's about $40,500,000,000 that could hit the bitcoin market. 

That amount of fiat could purchase 5,062,500 btc instantly. 

A few problems with this math:

1. Many (perhaps most) Americans have already filed their taxes and received their refund. So potential buying pressure could be at the tail-end rather than the beginning stages.

2. People have lots of things to use their refund on, and traditionally allocate very little of it for investing. While the number of folks investing/saving is higher than you'd expect, [it's still less than 50%](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/20/heres-what-americans-do-with-their-tax-refunds.html).

3. Bitcoin has been in the news lately, but not in the "best investment ever, buy all the btc!" sense. It's mostly been negative press focused on the volatility and rapid decline from $20,000. Anecdotally, I get a lot more, "damn, dude, bitcoin is really tanking huh. Do you regret investing in it?" than I do, "holy shit, I can buy btc for $8,000? What a bargain, time to invest!"
Most people have paid taxes by now
https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-rally-tax-day-dont-bet-farm/

As always, take whatever those shitbags write with a pinch of salt though.
I don't think it will have much of an effect based of previous years. Did a quick check on the significance of US Tax day on the overall market cap since 2014 and there wasn't much. Even though this isnt the best indicator to draw conclusions from its still worth looking over.

For now anyway. It'll be interesting if sentiment has changed in such a way that a fairly continuous rise is self fulfilling. If everyone thinks the bear market is over dip buyers could sustain a rise up. Volume be damned.
Doesn't seem too strong to me (edit: may have spoken too soon) but have to let it play out obviously. Considering adding to my short position (8.3) in case this is the last time we're over 8k for the next few days but that might just be asking for a kick in the teeth.

Yes, or just use a stop market order. With most stop, you probably just want to gtfo out of the way asap, so market orders are better.
Hmm. I need to confer with the mod team, but I'm thinking a Kickstarter is going to be a nonstarter here.

*Update* - We have decided against allowing crowdfunding as an extension of our other policies. Sorry that wasn't more clear before.
This might be news to you but the weather is not the same everywhere.
I highly doubt it.  Maybe the winter weather and the lack of other stuff to do pushed some of the new retail investment last November/December, but even that likely has minimal impact on the market.

What is a Whale? A whale is not as small as us. Most whales are bigger than a bus! A whale is not like a fish in the sea. A whale breathes air like you and me. A whale can't walk upon the ground. A whale must swim to get around. A whale is a mammal just like me. But its home is in the deep blue sea.

We just love to talk about whales affecting everything. All the while knowing there's nothing we can do but follow along. Yet we still feel compelled to complain about it as if it will make a difference.
Why would a whale deaccumulate *after* crashing the price with market sells?

>  Bitcoin is as useful today as ..  it was at 150 during the dog days of 2014.

> As long as the fundamentals for Bitcoin are piss-poor all traders should adopt a bearish bias in their trading

With this logic you should have been bearish for whole of 2017. I doubt that would have worked out well.
So, per your comment history. You bought 19K and then panic sold it at $6.4K, Your attempts to drive this lower are futile. Just rebuy $19K
> What has changed from 6.8 to 8.4?

More people are buying and trading alts. Most alts are traded against Bitcoin. More volume in alts = more liquidity needed from Bitcoin. More liquidity needed = price goes up. It's not complicated. 

> As long as the fundamentals for Bitcoin are piss-poor all traders should adopt a bearish bias in their trading

You must have had a very profitable 2017 with this line of thinking. 
I was in a travel agents the other day and saw first hand how shit it is for some people to send money across the world using Western Union. They had to wait until the counter opened before they could send, were then charged an extortionate fee to send it, and then they will have to wait days for it to reach the other person. This was for 3 different people in the space of 5 minutes that I was in there.

Crypto has the potential to eradicate this and many other backwards situations that exist in the world. Yes, it's not there yet but it soon will be.
you know that there are other books than "The intelligent investor" about markets those days right ?

How is Bitcoin not very useful?

Where I come from, I can walk up to any ATM and deposit BTC there for cash. 

I can trade it for any shitcoin

I can cross a border with vast amount of funds

I can send my mom 10k to fix up the roof in 60minutes. She can sell on Kraken and withdraw to her bank account if she wants.

Not to mention when I gotta pay my homies for something we did. IBAN? SEPA payments... lol

More like GDAX or Mycellium
that being said, its fundamentals are actually stronger than when it was 20k, give or take ( : 
sure if you view of fundamentals is shallow and one dimensional.
Not really. It broke down quite definitively this morning:

https://imgur.com/a/eLKpA

EDIT: If you want to be extremely generous, then this morning's dump is producing an [ascending triangle](https://imgur.com/a/It5IZ). But that requires one to pretty much ignore 90% of the market movement since April 12th. 
probably a scam? do you have 20,000 btc?
Probably trying to unload stolen BTC. Obviously stay the hell away.
It already isn't engulfing the top wick of the previous candle, so...
Hammer on the 12H
Idk too man it seems like the price is either going up or going down
Strong TA right here. Going all in
8500 looks really difficult, unless lots of new buyers hop in.
if hidden, how do u know if it is big or small?
How do you know?  It didn't seem to get stuck at 8000, it moved all around, 8014, and is now bouncing down a bit.
I think another failed test of breaking $8500 will drop it back down to $6900 to complete the bart formation.

Are you at the gates counting who had left and who is still in, and their ages?

In this case, the downvote brigade was likely a combination of the message and the manner in which it was delivered.

I actually do agree that, for the most part, bearish commentary is not particularly well received in this sub. Almost everybody here holds some amount of BTC, so it really shouldn't be too surprising that — as a collective — /r/bitcoinmarkets does not want to hear about the value of btc dropping. 

That aside, however, your post lacked any supporting analysis whatsoever:
 
"It's going down to under 8k." 

Congratulations, you were 100% correct. But why did you feel that way yesterday? Was it because your buddy, Mr. Bearwhale told you he was going to market sell 15,000 btc in an hour? Was it a confluence of TA indicators that lead you to that conclusion? Did you trip over your sofa, bang your head, and have a vision of bitcoin at $7,950?

Without supporting your claim, you should expect to receive more upvotes than downvotes. Particularly if your claim happens to be bearish.
Next time instead of a low quality price prediction comment with no reasoning or substance, open a position based on your belief and post that up, you're much more likely to get recognition and possibly even make some money. 
You must be Nostradamus 
post a 1+BTC margin short next time, and then we’ll see if there’s hair on your chest.

Other than that... hindsight trading
did you give a reason *why* you thought it would go down? 
People who draw lines on paper will just keep drawing them until it fits their idea.  Goal seeking....

The price went up going into the tensions in Syria.  The tensions are released, the price is going to go down.  Not to $1,000 (I hope), but its still going down to about half of the rise.

This is not rocket science.  You are right to call it when you see it coming.  A reddit Karma score means nothing in the world.  We cannot turn them in for money can we?
People hate reality, and I'm betting some think reddit comments and sentiment have enough pull to influence the market.

Spam. I miss the days when people created Reddit self posts to share information / start discussions, as opposed to spamming articles from some random site for the sake of increasing traffic.. 
If financial institutions bought in en masse, the current "whales" would soon become plankton.
It can be manipulated because the overall marketcap is low.
My 2c is that financial institutions are buying in for the long term. Think years and years. Fluctuations within mean nothing. 
Great analysis
We should ban people who post this wothout at least a brief history of a few quality posts

Verge is meaningless outside of the vergins who believe in it.
That's premature right now. You could argue a potential left shoulder and a head. But at least wait for the right shoulder before you call a H&S maybe? You can't just ignore 33% of a pattern.
Yep, been watching this. It's one of the reasons I think we might touch 8100 again before we drop. Almost just happened, too. 
A tuna sub to be exact, which I think cost only $3.
I look forward to this day. I'm still just so fascinated by the movement of the market that it's difficult for me to keep from checking it constantly. Probably doesn't help that I work from home.

This is why you outperformed the sub, but good job either way.
I mean if you held through 5 years you've outperformed almost anyone. As most holders don't exhibit that much resolve.
> Been there, done that. you’ll make it back.

lol. that's not how it works.
Understood.  I've honestly never opened as aggressive of a position and I chose to do it when the risk / reward was ridiculously shitty.  I think I was in the mood to get abused.


Yall need to step your yolo game up. My liq is usually 2-300 away. Buy at support/sell at resistance. Exit immediately if it breaks.
I fold, you got me there. Wasn't around for those good old days!
Actually, on second glance...was that 2013 or 2014? If the latter, then I remember it. For some reason I thought it was the 2013 bubble to $260 when I first saw it.
If I recall correctly (I welcome those with better memory to correct me), OKCasino futures was the market with highest liquidity and volume at the time...and is still significant even to this day (though of course the China bans put a damper on things).

Also that price action was mirrored across futures and spot, as it usually is. Though upon closer inspection it appears you are right to a certain extent, the moves were less pronounced on spot...looking at the tickers in the tabs I had open, as best I can tell, spot was $920 high / $902 low (give or take) vs. $936 high / $870 low on futures.

> 20% in 30 minutes

I am *sure* we had plenty of those over the years.

> I would genuinely be interested if you can find other historical examples.

Yeah, I'm having a lot of fun digging in the archive. Will report back with more.
I'm really not sure what people are referring to with this barting thing, but [this chart shows the hourly of Mt Gox in late Nov-early Dec 2013](https://www.tradingview.com/x/c5CERfQT/). 11.29-12.1 especially look rather Bart like to me.

Or [this one.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/xh0BVJtt/)
I don't know if I can find Barts that "clean" (well-formed) in the past...but yes, referring to the general market action of high-volume pumps and dumps amidst uncertainty that create weird formations on the charts (as you can see in the shot above).
Well, a lot of people around here were acting like some of the phenomena was new; I wanted to demonstrate that it wasn't. Also, some people can look at the older examples I posted ("Chinese hedge funds suppressing BTC!", 2014) and say, well clearly that theory was nonsense and we were just in a bear market...then turn around and look at the same nonsense today ("Soros shorting BTC to $0!") and take it seriously.

The overarching point is that the market is the market is the market. If there's manipulation, then you might as well just get used to it and work around it. And it's human nature to construct creative narratives for things that have more reasonable explanations. These theories are easy to create but very difficult to prove/disprove. It's best to just ignore them unless presented alongside very compelling evidence (and "look at all these coincidences!" isn't very compelling, either).
Usually not, no. I generally stick with an entry and either hold it or give up on it if things go south. 

For example, I had a short from $8,030 that I closed at $8,080 prior to the move up to $8,400. I described the movement as "stupid" at the time and had very little faith in the prospect of continued upward movement. So I could certainly have just added to it on the way up, but opted instead to get out of the way and reevaluate. 
When I make trade recommendations, at least a small number of people follow them. 

The difference between opening a short at $7,950 vs holding an existing short from $8,330 is how much you have in your trading account to support that trade. 

let's say you shorted 1 btc at $8,330. On paper, you currently have about 1.1 btc. If the market goes back to $8,330, you have 1 btc. 

If you short 1 btc here at $7,950 and close at $8,330 you have ~.9 btc. 

What I'm essentially saying here is the following:

1. If you've got some profit from your current short to support the position, then let it ride and take the risk/reward of seeing $7,500 before we see $8,400 again. 

2. If you don't currently have profit from your previous trade to support the position, then stay out. 

People hold me accountable for the recommendations I make. I have zero issue with folks missing out on profits because they held a position too long based on my recommendation. However, I try to avoid forcing fresh losses on my followers because I advised them to enter a position at the wrong time.
One of his main reasons is hedging his cold stack. I enter most of his trades but leave early / take profits because i have no hold stack so when i enter a trade is to make money. This is something people following other traders positions must understand, if the reasoning behind the trade is the same between traders.
I entered a bit bellow his entry and left @8100. Was it early, yes, but if it bounced from the bottom of the channel to 8300 again it would almost count as a loss for me, specially since i had a losing streak last week and my last 3 trades were break even, so i really needed a win.
R/R to open a position is not worth it anymore here. However being short from 8330 he has quite some room to let it breathe and see what happens without immediate danger of being in the red.
"Cut losses quickly, let winners ride"

That should pretty much explain it.  If you're a few hundred points in the green, you can afford to wait it out in case it continues to break down.  If you open a short here, you could very quickly be in the red.
Actually, he closed for a loss and also opened a long near the top. 

I can certainly understand someone's frustration when they follow one of my positions and it doesn't work out as they'd hoped, but if you can't stomach a 1.5% move against a position then you're going to have a bad time. 

He exited too early and ignored my recommendation to set stops above $8,500.
Technical Analysis cannot give you insight into what *will* happen. It can, however, give you insight into what *should* happen. 

For the analysis I offered above, you don't have anything particularly actionable in the $6,800 to $8,750 range. But it does provide insight on what should happen if the market starts trading outside of that range. 

I provided a much more actionable analysis yesterday and earlier in the weekend when I called out that RSI was ridiculously overbought in the 6h timeframe and the upward momentum was starting to wane. I recommended shorting at $8,330 last night.

Hehehe, yeah! You know, I have three years of experience in bitcoin. But it feels like I've learned more in those three years in the market than I have learned in the last 11 years of my academic education.
I wish I was kidding lol . I’ll just be going by colors on my P/L instead of numbers. Green is good 
I appreciate both your skepticism and your ability to judge my commentary at face value rather than with an established bias based on my past trading performance. 

In my defense, when I rage quit at $760 I even acknowledged at the time that I was very likely selling the local bottom. I was emotionally drained to a point I hadn't even realized was possible when I initially started trading in the $200 to $300 range. 

The six month break I took between $760 and $5,000 helped me step away from my emotions and focus more on technical analysis. My performance has improved considerably since.
Hidden bearish divergence is seen when RSI makes higher highs but price makes lower highs compared to previous upward movements. 

The inverse is true for hidden bullish divergence. 

Well, once price makes higher highs and stops "diverging" from RSI, then the argument for divergence evaporates. The two elements that you're comparing (price and momentum) are no longer diverging: they're in alignment. 

The same is true for standard divergence.

This occurs when price makes lower lows but RSI makes higher lows. 

If RSI dips to make a lower local low on the next push down, then it's back in alignment with price and all is right with the world (from a divergence perspective).
Shorted hard when 8400 was failing on that last few dribbling attempts. Overbought on many timelines, running into old log support turned resistance, daily stoch RSI about to cross, and tight stops were not hard to place in case the bull was real and the resistance broke
Short from 8349 here, added at 8094 with another planned add at 8149 if we get back up there. Stop set at 8169. Gonna start taking profit at 8009 and then in installments on the way down if it breaks 8000. 

Edit: 8009 filled a second after saving this message. Here we go...
He places stop loses and expects to get stopped out of one position while riding the other one. So he will have about 1.5% loss on one position but will recoup that on the other one if the move is substantial and if he doesn't get stopped out of both because of wild swings.
You don't if you have both positions open, they effectively cancel each other out. I'm currently unsure of the direction BTC will go, but I do expect huge momentum in the direction it picks. So if I open both positions with relatively tight stops, one will get stopped out from the move and hopefully the momentum will keep going. I will hold the remaining position.
he hopes for a big move obviously so his long/short gets stopped out quickly while his other position makes big gains
Agreed. 

Tho market being as it is....I just keep seeing Homer chocking Bart... fucked. 
2014/2015 had futures, but they were OKCoin futures. They were a major force in the market, and there was always some funny business going on due to their unregulated nature, high volume, leverage, etc. (we call them OKCasino for a reason).

I'm guessing you mean regulated, big boy futures like CME/Cboe? Yeah, it should be interesting to watch. Right now volume on those futures is so low that I think their market impact is negligible. However, if volume increases, we should see them have more of an impact. While I don't put much stock in some of the wilder futures manipulation theories (gold/silver/uranium/etc.), I do think the "tail might start wagging the dog" in terms of futures affecting/controlling the spot markets due to arbitrage effects, etc. That would actually be really bad news for your average Crypto Chad retail trader, because I suspect that the institutions / HNWI that play those markets play much more serious and subtle games than we see on Bitcoin markets today.
You weren't kidding; [look what I just found](http://i.imgur.com/jgdA3th.png). October 2015. Weirdly high-volume period creating some ugly chart patterns, followed by many minutes with *literally 0 volume*. Talk about low volume and low liquidity!
You're right, but I have to admit my post was a bit tongue-in-cheek (I think Bitstamp, or its feed, literally died after that move...no way did people not trade at all after a dump like that).

But yeah, there were paint-drying days where you could see 3-5 minutes go by with no trades. Especially during the bottom of the bear market.

The one thing I really miss about those days is you could set an alarm for 1-3% and not have it hit for *days*. For the past couple of years, alarms go off constantly. I miss my beauty sleep.
Thanks Chew, I appreciate it. I'm thankful for your posts and insight as well.
what a beautiful long 
Are you adding to your short here? 
I think we've got a decent chance of retesting 8100 before diving downward to the ~7600 range. Though it may take another day or so. Support and Resistance have been pretty firm in the 8050-7910 range today.
Bah this isn't tradeable. So frustrating. Best to stay out of position.
Agreed, but since 8100 is my entry, I was wary to hold until there. Borderline weak hands move here, but I held this short through the trip to 8400 and didn't want to do it again. I do expect 8100 to hold though, given this stall. 
Yep, I just had updated my post with my chart. I've got a bit of PTSD from the BGC, so I have been managing stops/positions more closely. Downtrend channel seems to be holding, so I did re-enter 50% of my position at 8040. 
doing gods work
We shall see! Good luck.
good move, if it goes down, just hold and don't care about until you break even.
What do you know?
Thanks! I've set up stops and I'll take some profit or break even if things reverse hard. And if they reverse hard then I suppose we could say that's fairly bullish, so in the long run it wouldn't be the worst thing.
Pumps usually have less volume than dumps. Unless in reversals of trends.
Is it a bearish engulfing though? I thought it's supposed to have a small-bodied green candle followed by a long engulfing red. In this case they are similar-sized.

yeah I was just speaking to the one occuring in the past hour.

I think we are in for a very red day in the next 2-3
Usually a breakdown / breakup has a lot of volume and momentum. This one is slooooooooowwww, not showing much interest in going either way
High volume would indicate high volatility and yield large movements in either directions over a short period of time. The direction of the movement depends on many different circumstances.  Low volume usually would indicate a stagnant or accumulation phased market that is more susceptible to manipulation. 

So pretty much  high volume would mean that the market is going to probably move.
Thank you.
Thanks, I was wondering if the increased trading volume with small buys and sells help drive more interest on the exchange without a panic dump. 
Excellent point, thanks. 
Funny that you're downvoted since your prediction already came true.

All due respect, but that's a pretty noobish take. Bitcoin is known to double in price in astounding bursts.  How many times did it do it in just the past year? Would not bet against $20K by the end of June.
Thanks, edited. ESL but I don't want it to be so obvious ;)

nope dont think so, just wanna take a 100 usd swing.
I checked the chart and no 
Well, we could blast through it and still bleed out after... Same thing happened in 2014, iirc.


haha crazy, thats my plan aswell, hoping to open a long/short if and when we find a solid support/resistance.
I'm afraid if we do reach 8.4k a short might not be the best move from there.
[deleted]
Agreed 100%, but try telling that to the buttcoin/nocoin crowd when it finally dawns on them that they missed out.
Maybe he's got a coupon. 
This comment tells you everything you need to know about chewy. Even a shitpost like this gets a thoughtful, well reasoned response. Truly a legend.
I like you
at last, the sandwich heavy portfolio pays off for the hungry investor!
I am feeling the hostility in your words my friend :(
The overbought/oversold metrics on sRSI work very well *with* trend, so overbought indicators are not strong during bull markets, but conversely, an oversold crossover of daily SRSI was very good at predicting the bottom of a dip/start of a new rally during the bull run, though not 100%:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/Sh8T2GFB/
Before distribution every dip was bought up, so while it DID indicate local tops, they were quickly bought and new highs were formed within a week or two after.  So it would have been a good play to sell at/near tops and then rebuy if you play that game (I don't). 
Well until now we´ve only made a lower high, no?
Higher low remains to be seen.
I mean, I figured the chart spoke for itself, but I guess I can translate to words if you need.

* Post distribution (the large selloff after the ATH), the daily sRSI has been extremely accurate in predicting "tops" of each rally/bounce.  The current situation is setup with the sRSI well into the "overbought" range, indicating a reversal is coming in the not-too-distant future.  

Note: sRIS does NOT predict price targets, only momentum on a daily scale. 
The market has regained some of its bullish tenacity, that's for sure. The break down to 7940 4 hours ago would have dumped the market 2 weeks ago. Buying confidence is definitely increased, even if it's not enough to break it out yet. If we spend the night over 8k, I'm not sure I see a high probability of my bear scenario playing out. 
Closed my short and it drops $30... what is going on...
If we get there, I'd consider that. 
Hmm. This move may have been premature--that's what I get for being cautious. Thanks, I'll re-evaluate. 
Slanting up makes it a bear flag, though it's within a very slight upward trend which makes it ... nothing, basically. This is noise within a dying, very large bull pennant that extends back to December. It could drop here, back to the triangle support, or it could pop through.
Fair enough. If we can stay in this channel and move up again I would be pretty happy.
Thanks. Is your wedge drawn on linear or log? Mine is a bit higher than yours
Not invested more than pocket change, so no.
I hope i'm not biased, but why can't we go to 250k$ / BTC, before we go to  6k$ ? :( /s
Just don't think that the bulls will give up so easily with all the good things happening with adoption in the background. Expecting a bounce back to retest ~$8200 at least.

just fucking with the short term traders, on a macro level it doesnt really matter
More likely, a whale or group of whales has worked out a method to extract profit from people in over leveraged positions.
It's an interesting thought and certainly in the realm of possibility, but without any proof it's hard to really take the allegation seriously. 
That's an OG reference
we sort of double bottomed at 3k during China FUD. It went 3k to 4.2k back to 3.5k and then bounced off 3.5k convincingly 
$160 was a double bottom in 2015 ... but only on Bitfinex as far as I know. First one happened in January when I bought my first Bitcoin. And the second one happened in July. It went over $300 twice in between but hung around $230 for most of that time. By August, it was back to $500. 
i think we are in an upward channel now, so slowly going up
That assumes that, in the long term, bitcoin will keep rising indefinitely. 

I'll grant you that it has done precisely that since it's inception, but there will come a point where long-term holders who entered above a certain $ point will never be in profit. 

There are some who feel that even $100K btc would be undervalued. 

There are others who feel that even at $8,000, btc is ridiculously overvalued. 

Time will tell which of the two camps are correct, but I have always been skeptical of the "buy and hold" mentality. 
> Buy the top: detected

I don't honestly know. A lot of folks are calling the start of the bull market and / or the end of the Bear. It's gambling I guess. I'm a lot less bearish than I was.
I'm always late to things.
Well that would be one reasonable answer to why the market didn't dump, that the overall market sentiment has shifted. My issue with this is the continuous exceptionally low daily volumes. 

*Dead Cat Dump* is a great name, but does conjure up a pretty grim image in the mind.
I agree sir
If I was a bear in this market, I'd have shorted from $8300\+ and expected a dump to mid 7s. I do see people closing their shorts now, rather \(IMO\) preemptively as I would and continue to expect a retrace to mid/upper 7s.

Why has the market essentially ignored a nigh on instantaneous $350 dump? Bears should see this as great news. Bulls should've been shook. But nothing. It's like we were never at $8.4k. 
You mean bulls are now forced to accumulate at 8k, which they are reluctant to. Nice entry for bears at 8.3-8.4.
Hah! I very much like to admit when I have no idea what is happening. I think human behavior/market sentiment drives BTC mostly, and I'm dead confused that a \~$350 drop didn't cause the market to dump harder *as it has literally been doing for months now*. So I'm just a tad confused ;\)
I see two group of traders here.

1. Those who are waiting for the price to rise so that they can open shorts; and;

2. The new comers who are attracted to the market again due to the recent rise in price (or even those who are just sitting on the sidelines waiting for clear indications). This group of people have greater buying power. I can see this group over powering the first one.
Thanks. Interesting answer. Although I understand the benefits of opening both long and short, I am not sure I can be disciplined enough to use it properly. Knowing myself, chances are I’ll start to panic and close one when it starts moving opposite direction only to find it quickly changing course and screwing up the other position as well..!!
yea I've noticed that as well...I think they will bleed again if BTC breaks the log resistance around 8.8 
After a while people just say 'fuck it, I'll ride this to 0".
8K is gonna break. You really think we’ll never see sub 8K BTC again?
What gives you that impression? Are you going off the macro trend? Looks like a double top around 8.4/8.8 on the daily similar to the 11.5/11.8 double top earlier. We've just had an EMA cross to the downside too.
you don't borrow btc on futures, but the rest of your argument is right
You're right, but I'm definitely accumulating big macs right now just in case
> if you know how to analyze it

You missed the later part.
Worth mentioning the 15 min bull div in your edit may already be playing out/have played out, though. 
https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZIJSs1va/

Maybe he's talking about this? Not confirmed yet though
Might be talking about this? Significant divergence on the 1 Hour MACD.
https://www.tradingview.com/x/77cGt9eM/
I think he's talking about the decreasing RSI during the ascending wedge we just broke down out of. You can see it relatively clearly on the hourly. I think the break down indicates that it has already played out, though.
Whalepanda is lying in that tweet. See: https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8cocth/to_the_twitter_liars_like_whale_panda_and/

Also your assertion that Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is not bitcoin is just plain wrong. It is servicing one side of the August 1st fork. Claiming that it is somehow a scam cooked up by Roger Ver or anyone else is disingenuous and ignores the history behind the [genesis of bitcoin cash](https://hackernoon.com/the-great-bitcoin-scaling-debate-a-timeline-6108081dbada).

Edit: Downvoted for the truth. Stay classy, /r/bitcoinmarkets. Keep deluding yourselves that the core side of the fork has some magical property that makes it bitcoin and nothing else. Meanwhile people like me will be here to call you out on your blatant lies and wishful thinking.
This. This is Bitcoin. This is decentralization. Anyone in the world can fork Bitcoin and call it Bitcoin. The coin with the most adoption and hashing power wins in the end. This is how consensus is done in Bitcoin. If the version you support is so great you have nothing to worry about. Censorship, lawsuits, threats, those all just show me the people reacting this way aren't so sure about their version and have to attack the other versions. Replacing FIAT and finding consensus is a messy process. 
Using the twitter name @Bitcoin for something that isnt BTC, but a shitcoin Bcash, is fraud and misleading, they should get their own twitter for their own shitecoin, instead of misleading uninformed people of twitter.

It is damaging to the bitcoin community and makes us all lose credibility to normal people.

@Bitcoin should be Ran by the Bitcoin core Dev team. Just like How mcdonalds owning and using burger kings twitter would be total madness

Anyone who Disagrees is a Moron
"Your version of Bitcoin". Bitcoin is Bitcoin. Anything else is an Alt. Hijacking the name of something just because it is decentralized is dishonest and misleading.

Naive people aren't following 'God' and making uniformed life decisions due to this account shilling trash though 
The initial rise from $6,800 to $8,400 is where shorts were liquidated. 

If the market does make another failed attempt at $8,400 and confirms a double top by falling below $7,800 then that will convince him that this whole move was orchestrated by whales to shake out shorts. 
Not really an answer. The burden of proof is on the force of change, not on the status quo. Your answer is as convincing as me saying: why wouldn't we go to 8400, it's only a 5% move up.
2k move up with no retrace and 4 hour bear div...?
If you look at 3 day chart you can see MACD would flip either way but few days later. Smaller TF looks as they do... They can change fast also. I think this might test 7800$ then hard bounce based on that 3 day (and daily - MA cross) setup.
Funny thing is it already happened twice in a row: 17k and 12k. 
Charts and sentiment are strong right now. I'm seeing a correction to the true value of bitcoin in the next weeks around 28-40k
Maybe this is too much of a conspiracy theory, but what if we go back up to the downward trend line around 8030, people start to think a double bottom is in, open long, and get dumped on?

As long as we don't breach 8030 it seems like we're still in the downward channel to me.
Everytime we are about to breakout, some random Satoshi Nakamoti comes and say we will go down first. lol.
>down while you still can

BItmex is not known for performance those days
Good possibility of this region offering support.
what are we doing?    
Doesn’t that run the risk of your assets being frozen if they realize your from the US? I’ve read some horror stories. 
oh i'm not referring to 7000. I meant 7k as we got below 8 again.

Chill out guys, it's a joke
I'm saying it's a good idea to be buying incrementally while we drop lower because this is just a minor retracement, BTC ran up several days. The daily chart has it's higher high, but it also needs a higher low for the trend to shift (to an uptrend). That's very likely to happen. 

The real test is in a couple of days. If there is no momentum and it fails to produce a new higher high, chances are it's going to 6.5k again. 

Also, those that already invest/trade heavily in BTC may not be getting a refund at all if they made any moves during the Nov/Dec run. In fact, many are finding out they need to sell some of their holdings to pay their taxes.

I expect this to be nearly a wash in market impact. 
> According to bitcoin.com

lol.  There is your problem right there.  
I seriously doubt that most Americans have received their tax refunds yet. Most people are probably like me (lazy as fuck and like to procrastinate) and are probably waiting till the last minute to file. I filed a couple days ago, and I definitely know where some of that money is going in the next couple weeks. 
Not all Americans get tax returns...
I think most people have filed.  The people that pay, will pay tomorrow.  At least they should.  I started moving everything last week so it will show up in time for me to file.
As always 😊
Every trade you make, even crypto to crypto, is a taxable event. If you ever get audited you will be fucked.

I've used the market order before but between pressing the button and it executing can be +-$50 sometimes - setting the trigger beforehand would be more precise, no? Also market orders have higher fees? Or am I wrong about that?
Well, TIL. Thanks, man :)
How does global warming effect the price then?
No it was the stop market orders activating. Mine (and others I guess) stop short was set at 7990. As soon as the price reached that it instantly dropped because of the market sells. My order got filled at 7960.
Legit, checked by the minute and they both fell at 14:38 CEST but finex probably lead it. Just some lag from kraken maybe? Never noticed before /s...
Pardon?
Was kind of a mini-trap
he can do both, open limit sells and wait till gets filled. when no further growth, dump coins, wait till limit sells get filled... and so on.
some people must learn by playing with fire
Bitmex works? could have fooled me! The most overloaded platform in bitcoin right now. So much I have to really wonder if it's overloaded or on purpose.
:)

You're right. At the very least I'm playing it much safer now
Was short at 6.9 and in disbelief after the BGD, figured no one would take the bait, and shorted again. 
It's evident in the bursts of volume that accompany the big red candles.  There's no reason to sell that way other than to drive the price down... which is not what you generally want to do if you're a seller of something.  If I wanted to unload 10,000 BTC, I'd do it quietly over the market, not by going to an exchange and dumping it all in 15 minutes.

I'd love to be the guy lending the coins to the big shorts though. I'd take the proceeds from the loan, wait for him to dump, buy him out cheap, then laugh as he scrambles to pay me back my coins.
Yeah I should have been clearer. The graph looks very "spiky"..Any direction, up or down is rejected almost immediately. As soon as it seems to be going down, lots of buys. As soon as it seems to be going up, massive sells. But only until it's back in the the 8k region.

Of course as I'm writing the sell pressure has increased and it's dropping^^

And then they pay the exchange fee to convert it to fiat and wait for days for withdrawal. 
don't think that was a serious post.
So much this, the use/value of bitcoin is lost on many privileged first world people. 
You just proved my point because everything you claim Bitcoin is useful for relies on converting the Bitcoin into fiat first LOL. 

Man oh man. This bubble hasn't popped yet.

market buys dont move price. And they were a lot.
because i saw 20+ market buys of 0.5 while the market limit order was 0.38. 

It was around 50 btc or so. if i counted well. 

or the bfx ticker borked up and repeated the same order a lot.
My thought too
15k shorts but your point stands
Well Mr. chewtoy you are a respected member of this sub, so let me put it this way, If, there is a reason for a prediction, but that reason is almost impossible to prove, will you still disclose such reason?
My gut is my reason, I do not believe in TA. This is Bitcoin. TA isn't reliable in the stock market, why would it be reliable in bitcoin?
Are you really relating the price increase to the tensions in Syria?

Mind blown...
Me too, I miss the good old days of trollers who won't forget an incident that took place four years ago. Black heart scarring darker still! LOL I just love James Hatfield. 
That sounds like a gamble. While institutions are buying up, whales could decided to cash out leaving the institution bagholding. 

I suppose institutions would then launch a campaign to convince retail of an amazing investment opportunity in order to unload their bags.
depends how far BTC goes. If it goes to 100k, then a whale’s notional BTC portfolio if they sold now would only be diluted 12x, or 8% of original.

Never forget that the traders who have been in Crypto for a long time have many resources at their disposal, e.g. insider information, collusion with exchanges, preferential fee structure etc.

The old timers on BTC don’t think much of institutional clients. Money don’t stink but why would an exchange want to gove some hedgefund an edge? For money... which means that the whales have an even stronger position.

I think we are just establishing a decentralized market where the big players will remain lone wolf traders, even when the hedge funds arrive.

Is a hedge fund really going to start spoofing walls to spook the market? Or Bart us down to a lower price point?

I dont think so
Its a scam, bcc bring negative news to crypto too
Hence why i said “ Possible”. Yes it’s premature, but there is some validation to it  
Don't get me wrong the market is often entertaining/fascinating to watch. Nevertheless after a certain point I realized that I was my own worse enemy when paying too close attention. 

I had many plans that would have worked out but bailed on them because of short-term noise that wouldn't have been noticed if I wasn't watching the price movement so closely.

Interesting, thanks for looking into it.

> I am sure we had plenty of those over the years.

Oh ya, definitely. That's why we all play this game, right? What I mean is that the recent BGD happened with no movement suggesting a trend in that direction (or a clear reversal sign) immediately prior. Actually, there was a small downtrend (which brought on the shorts), and then a huge response. Almost more like a bounce, but with the bounce being much larger than the precipitating fall. 

I just don't think this kind of thing (and barts) were as common in the past because either (a) there weren't so many clueless people making high leverage bets and there were fewer whales with the means to exploit it or (b) there was enough liquidity to absorb it. It's not until now that we have the confluence of low volume, high-leverage margin trading, and whale games that allows for this kind of activity to dominate the price.
I did the other, basically. I had a stop limit, but didn't set it deep enough. Instead, I added at 8350. 
I see where you are coming from. 

Short from 19k, price is 6500, can keep the position open as a runup to 8k is a relatively small movement.

Short from 6500, a move up to 8k will smash you.
maximum pain geeez
am i wrong for opening a short at 8330, and then closing it at breakeven because i really didn't think i would have the time to monitor it well and didn't want to fuck the trade up again?
You do realize it’s complete pseudoscience right?  If you can’t accurately predict what will happen then what “should” happen isn’t certain at all. 
Any reason you started posting your trades lately?
Most impressive sir!  We appreciate your input here :) 
Any thoughts on shorting the living crap out of Euro bonds expecting interest rates to go up? risky?
wow, didn't know you're from toronto
You've seriously got the best luck. 
Lol this is my favorite trading strategy ! 
I think you misunderstood my question (thanks for the info anyway, a refresher is always nice). I was wondering how does one come up with a number ($9,200 in your instance) for the point of invalidation.
Ahhhhh I see, pretty smart idea (never thought of it that way). Thanks man appreciate it.
Eat my shorts
I'm fully back in CA @ 8030 (which is where I exited briefly, so technically still short 8100 less minor fees). 
I don't think we break 8100 unless we're going higher (8200ish): https://www.tradingview.com/x/exFcp01W/  
Oh ya, I get you 100%. Market has been too unpredictable recently so it's probably a wise decision.
The sell book of BTC and ETH also concerns me, a whale could literally buy it all and send us to the startosphere, don't want to play with fire. Wise decision to protect capital.
Hey, cyoreligion, just a quick heads-up:  
**occuring** is actually spelled **occurring**. You can remember it by **two cs, two rs**.

In fact, double bottoms generally fail to confirm and end up going lower around 64% of the time (not a BTC specific stat).

Okay interesting, thanks for the link. I guess they really wanted to get that guy as CTO too.

Jeez bot you must be fun at parties
good bot!
Yes, yes: the “deal with it” rally! I distinctly remember /u/moral_agent’s charts with those pixelated sunglasses slapped onto the rally to $680 from underneath the descending log resistance line from ATH.
would be a double top formation, descending wedge on the  4hr, I think more reasons to be bearish here 
I think fun is the wrong word.  
I take sandwich math very seriously. 

I'd hate for somebody to open a 300 correct position, close it $15 later, go to Subway and realize to their horror that they're still $4.50 short of their tuna bliss.

You said it better than I would've, so hats off to you.  ^ This is exactly right.
Agreed, higher low is not confirmed until 11 something.
The weekly RSI just crossed to the upside, what now? 
I understood that all from the chart.

Yes it has been an extremely accurate way of predicting tops of each rally/bounce since the ATH.

Are you implying that this will now and forever more be correct each and every time?

My point was that every pattern breaks down eventually. Dismissing those that say "this time is different" \(as I believe you were originally implying\) is equally as silly \(albeit with the odds in your favour\) as claiming that an indicator/pattern will always be correct in predicting a pump/correction/reversal.
I’m short from 8028 and 8072 and holding. Will most likely bail if it breaks above 8200 
We did drop 6% last night/today so this retracement is not shocking to me but I also understand being cautious. I got one of my better short entries in a while up at 8400 so I am not feeling the heat.

Exchanges already have a goose that lays golden eggs. There's no reasonable motivation.
Ok so if someone put a wallet with idk 100 BTC on the table in front of you and said “you shouldn’t take this but if you do it’s ok” you wouldn’t take it?  What more do you need?
It wasn't even that long ago! The market was trading in the $200 to $300 range about 2.5 years ago. 

I have spices in my cabinet older than that. 
I generally view that entire movement as a triple bottom at ~$200. 

The drops to $160 were outliers and the market only traded below $200 on any one occasion for a few hours. Maybe only a few minutes (it's been awhile and my memory is hazy).
Kind of feels like we're in no man's land if the channels have crossed over. Not sure if I should leave my short open or close it and set up orders at 8.2 or 7.9 in case there's a sharp move in either direction.
Chewy, the master of rationality. IMO I think there are too many external factors on the global stage for btc to stay at the current levels. There are too many family offices, HNWI's and many others invested to let this slip. Of course these are just my thoughts. 

I still have the same rationale, for btc to succeed - each one needs to be worth 6 figures (USD) a piece. It either goes much higher or the experiment fails altogether. I think we'd all be happy with the former. 
At what point do you personally stop being a holder?

Edit: I know you have a cold storage; that's what I'm referring to
You just bought a resistance, that's not smart in risk management terms.
longterm you're still early
Because it was instantaneous, if it took 1 day to drop that it might have more credibility, this case was a huge market sell and could be a bear trap. Traders are becoming numb to this type of market manipulation with no follow through.
Don't think you're wrong with your targets. Just a bit impatient. Lots of accumulation is going on in this range so the drops are not going to be fast
This isn't like January. A lot of people took advantage of the discounted prices and are still up 20 percent or more even after this small obviously manufactured dump. Price would have to go sub-6K for people to even begin to worry, and it's not going there.
I am number 2. Relative to the buying power in the last 3 months, 1k of fiat i would say it's greater buying power.
hell no, problem is im impatient and when i finally get to the green in my trades i look to close quickly especially with all the "barts" happening lately, tbh my position is just a bit too big for me to be comfortable unless it gets to sub 8k, ima give it like another 1-2 hours XD

Edit: its fucked me recently because i closed a long a bit too early right before the huge 10% spike happened so im aware of the possible profit im missing out on by constantly closing quickly, its just nerve-wrecking because their is no constant trend it feels like
100% macro. This "runnup" is 100% noise. Yep, we'll slowly step down after this double top. 
You missed the point...why analyse something entirely unreliable and manipulated...the irony
Ya, divergence on the 15m or 30m isn't likely to result in a massive reversal. 
What you are describing would be considered bearish divergence though. Price making higher highs but RSI making lower highs. 

When looking for divergence, you're looking for the strength of the current trend to diverge from the movement of the current trend. 

Hidden divergence is generally seen when the market is temporarily moving against an overarching trend. We've seen hidden bearish divergence, for example, during pretty much all of the previous dead cat bounces. 

You'd want to be looking for hidden bullish divergence during the decline we're currently seeing. Not during the upward movement that preceded the decline.

No, you guys forked off and have now a little shitcoin called bcash. You should be ashamed of yourself for trying to defraud naive newbies out of their money by implying it is bitcoin.
I agree till the bitcoin core part. Ideally there is no spokesmen for bitcoin at all, definitely not in the name of bitcoin. So ideally that account would never be there. Since it is there, imo just best to ignore it.. not much else we can do.
Bitcoin is the ideia , and all of us can upgrade it however we wanted , you just need the miners and the community to follow you , and the strongest one will win at the end , I’m invested in bitcoin and I’ve never invested in bitcoin cash , but what you people do to try to negate bitcoin cash is being completely childish , you don’t want competition so you just want to censor it , sometimes I feel sad in being part of this wonderful community 
> Bitcoin is Bitcoin.

lol

All they have is a twitter account with the bitcoin name, I’m not saying what they say there is true in any way, I’m just saying that censoring the competition is not the way to do it, bitcoin cash is as much bitcoin as bitcoin itself , and in the next years we ll see who who will win, my personal opinion is that bitcoin cash has no chance , but what do I know , if bitcoin cash is such a scam like you guys keep shouting you don’t need to worry since it will be no competition 
LOL.  I guess you don't know much about religion ... other than the Bitcoin religion.  Maybe the world needs some central authority, like you or Twitter support, to tell them the true story? 
[deleted]
Good clarification. Thanks u/_chewtoy_
Your absolutely right both are just as likely 5% swings(and sometimes more) are the norm in bitcoin.

That's your target? Good luck, man.

Dude...
We are not seeing the same charts for sure...
3x to 5x increase in a few weeks? With this anemic sample of volume?
Any explanation that describes the market as an entity with a will is likely a false machination. There are more possible outcomes than are possible to describe.

Describe regions of resistance and support instead of the personality of the ticker.
I'm saying this based on the red Ichimoku cloud that we'll be going under on the 30 min chart. I'm not just posting this randomly.
I share a similar sentiment. And no, this isn't based on my "gut". Check out the two charts I've posted below for some reasoning if you care about that.
No I've never heard of them freezing funds. I have heard that if you lose your 2 factor Auth, you could be screwed. Use authy with cloud backups so you don't need to worry about that.

good point. I'm not going to revisit the math though. 

The point of my post was basically that, while a substantial amount of money could potentially hit the btc market due to tax returns, it's either already been invested, or it never will be invested.

In either case, it shouldn't have a significant impact on current price.
I wish I was getting a refund.  

But, if you can project your income you shouldn't get a refund.  Every year it seems I have to pay because of a single, un-forecasted event.  This year I write the check happily.

You're right about both things.  The issue becomes- if you use a limit you're taking a risk that you get stuck out during a massive movement (like the one we had last night).  A market order guarantees you get out, but you could get stuck with a shitty exec. price.

I'm talking about a stop market order, so that you don't have to spam the button during Mex's token 'overloaded' times.

Market orders are taker orders, which do have higher fees, but a stop limit order that is executed against existing order is also a taker order. Since that's what usually happens anyway, I prefer to just use stop market orders.
its a double-edged sword. stop limit will put in an order at that price, but it also might not trigger. 

if you have a sell order at 8000 for both prices and then the price plunged straight down, it won't trigger until the last trade is < 8000, and it will just sit there unless someone happens to buy it during the downfall.  market order is better for that.

limit order is better if it crawls up or down to that price, since you'll almost always fill it in that case.

you can also put a stop limit order with the limit price way higher/lower than the stop price, which is effectively the same as a market order.
Global warming went 25x short at 8450.

But that's what I said? :p 

> Decent market sells while triggering stops.

Whale is still selling like 100-500 BTC that triggers stops (let's say 500-1k BTC) making it go even lower all in same few seconds. Potentially whale even fills the stops with his buy orders.
Three fiddy bud
Even as it stands it would be better than using WU, and it will only get better. 
You would only convert Bitcoin to fiat if you thought it would go down.

And I’ve been around long enough to know that the weak sayce bears like yourself are dime a dozen and all cry so hard when they get left out in the dust
also, it takes 5 days to transfer funds from Europe to the US

Let that sink in
segwit is FAR more adopted, including big exchanges, transaction times are much shorter and cheaper at the same time, LN is growing, yes and it generally points in the direction that even when (if?) BTC becomes much more adopted, it won't have the scaling issues we saw (which were combined with spam attacks at the time) ( : 
That's not to say that the market won't take that breakdown and turn it into a more clearly defined, longer term pattern. Something [like this](https://imgur.com/a/dFqGF) is quite possible over the course of the next few days to weeks.

EDIT: Some of the best advice I can offer someone new to charting is to avoid drawing short-term patterns based on significant short-term movement.

If there's been a substantial drop, or a substantial pump, following a period of consolidation, then the odds are pretty high that they came as a result of a **breakout** from a formation...not as a result of the **creation** of one. 

If two points of contact on one of your lines are spread extremely far apart, and one of them is coming at the tail-end of a strong upside or downside move...then there's a decent chance you're doing something wrong. 

Also, you ideally want to have at least three points of contact to define any trend (short or long term). The more the better.
Sometimes formations can be fairly ambiguous, but this is one case where there really aren't multiple ways to draw the ascending channel that formed following the Big Green Candle. 

It formed and broke down.

That doesn't necessarily mean, however, that this is the end of the post-Big-Green-Candle rise. The market could very well remain rangebound between $7,800 and $8,400 to form a more convincing flag.  
Please don't post the details of scams. I don't want to be responsible for managing that content.
Probably the malaysian mafia.
Not saying the daily looks good and I'm mentally prepared for a dip, but you just can't call this a bearish engulfing. Check out how a bearish engulfing looks like: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearishengulfingp.asp

And I mean it just literally isn't engulfing the whole candle (the very top of it at least).
Yeah, I saw it too. Was hard to crack, but the green whale(s) managed to do it. Which gives me some kind of confidence.
Perhaps it was a dolphin unloading its stash. lol.
Of course, I always try to provide rationale for my exits and entries. 

If I were taking a position because I had a "hot tip" from a whale, I feel it would be important to disclose that and let other people decide whether to believe me or not. 

Same goes for if I entered a position simply because I "had a feeling."
Even a broken clock is right twice a day. Just because your prediction was right, that doesn't mean your reasoning was.
> My gut is my reason

There it is 
Hey nothing wrong with gut, but writing off TA as complete BS is why you probably recieved 36 dislikes.

This is a trading sub, that pretty much evolves arround TA based discussions. When you pop in with "my gut's telling me sub 8k is going to take place" you might aswell just move to r/bitcoin or r/cryptocurrency

People want informed reasons for your claims, thats why most people are here. To look at TA from different perspectives because that of yours only will never suffice for long term succesfull trading.
There are reasons other than TA that would be perfectly valid arguments for an impending decline. 

Perhaps a Google Trends graph showing a decline in searches for "buying bitcoin." 

A link to the percentage of open longs vs open shorts on Bitfinex. 

A negative news article.
To be fair, if you based your post on gut feelings and emotions, the people that downvotes you are also basing it on emotions.

You are no better than the ones screaming Bitcoin will reach $10k this week based on emotions.



This is a trading sub where users post their sentiments and back it with reasons other than just gut and emotions 
why would *you* be a reliable indicator vs. TA?  I'm not necessarily knocking you, I'm just saying, there has to be something better than "gut feeling" to make a post worth submitting.
your TA isnt reliable.

The entire world economy is connected.

There were all sorts of stories last week of russians and others who were moving their money out of "freezable" assets.  And this morning there talk of more sanctions against Russians businesses.

I don't think it is a huge leap that some of that money flowed into crypto.  I am not suggesting for a second that MOST or ALL of it went into crypto...but with an asset cap this small, even a small movement of cash into crypto would make a difference.

There is 0 validation to it. Patterns are binary, they're either there or not. Until the right shoulder has completed, there is no H&S in play.
Very easy to say when you were accumulating < $200 bitcoin
To re-fund my gambling (bitmex) account, or not.
That is the question.

Yeah, I actually partially agree with you there...margin trading has made things crazier in some respects. I think the BGD made perfect sense because the shorts were just begging to be squeezed and the $6.5k support tests were making shorts wary and bulls more confident (and I put my money where my mouth is by riding it up, even though it cost me in the weeks prior by getting chopped out 3x beforehand). What I can't explain (and where I agree with you) is why it happened *there* and not before or after. That's one of those mysteries of life, I guess.
You were layering sells right? What is your CA right now?
Of course not. The only thing that would be "wrong" would be trying to catch every single 3% to 5% move. 

If you can't pay attention to the market, and you don't want to rely on trailing stops to take profit and stop losses to protect your trading balance, then you probably shouldn't be taking positions at that time. 
You're never wrong if you have good reasoning
nothing wrong with that imo - 
patience is a virtue but not being able to monitor trades, even with sensible stops, can lead to regret later on if it doesn't pan out i would think
I've never successfully won an argument with somebody who dismisses technical analysis as pseudoscience, but here's what I will say:

1. You are absolutely correct that nobody has ever successfully proven that any TA provides a statistical advantage over the market. Or successfully proven the exact mechanism that causes Tylenol to dull pain. Or why humans show an overwhelming bias toward right-handedness.

It's possible that nobody can prove a statistical advantage, because there isn't one. But it's also possible that nobody has taken the time or been able to apply the proper combination of indicators to their study.

2. Not all TA is created equal. I try to focus on indicators that the market anecdotally respects. MA/MACD crosses, BBand compression, RSI, and trend lines. 

3. Most importantly, it works for me. I don't particularly care whether it's due to a shared group delusion by market actors, or because it actually works.
Just leave this sub if you don’t want to talk about strategy and TA.  The guy you are arguing with is one of the few people on this sub worth listening to, who consistently gets it right when it comes to picking profitable entry and exit points (which he posts in real-time without fail). 

You aren’t adding anything to the discussion by saying it’s pseudoscience.  If you want to prove your point, why don’t you go through his post history and look at every entry and exit point.  Then convince us that his entries and exit points are statistically no better than choosing at random.  

My guess is you won’t do that because it takes work. But coming in here and telling people that their analysis is meaningless is easy.  
TA is a study of social response. Nothing to do with math/economics/finance. 

If 30% of traders understand/trade off TA, then you basically have 70% of the market throwing darts or catching waves. The market chops around with these yahoos until criteria/patterns are met/formed. At this point, TA traders execute their strategies which pushes the market in the direction TA suggests. The Bitmex cowboys then jump on and act as catalysts. It's basically a huge self-fulfilling prophecy in many cases.

Outside forces like major news, massive market orders, etc break the patterns and cannot be predicted. Anyone telling you what *will* happen is full of crap. But you can absolutely predict what *should* happen and try to make your entries at optimal risk/reward positions. 
It's ok, buddy. Keep trading on emotion and gut feeling.
It helps to move the market if you are consistently right. There are bots that scrape Mike and Chewy comments
I totally agree with that comment. Awesome that you do that, Mike. Although you should never blindly follow anyones calls and do your own TA (as far as possible), it's nice to get an insight into people playing with higher stakes. 
The6 checking in.
Besides the fact I just opened a relatively large short position in Euro, yes my crypto luck is definitely on the higher side. Now, is there a way to distribute my crypto luck into other aspects of my life? Who knows. 
My previous response wasn't particularly clear. So I deleted it. 

Anyhow, $9,200 isn't just a number I plucked out of the ether. 

It's approximately the highest point of the previous substantial upside move the market made. 

When looking for divergences, you're basically taking a span of price and time and comparing it to a previous snapshot of price and time. I thought it might be helpful to zoom in here.

This is what the 12h RSI and price looked like when the market bounced from $7,300 to $9,200: https://imgur.com/a/zXo39

And this is what 12h RSI and price looks like now as the market bounced from $6,400 to $8,200: https://imgur.com/a/NeIaN

If you [compare the two](https://imgur.com/a/2Rziz), you'll notice that the price is substantially lower now than it was at $9,200...but RSI is substantially higher:

12 RSI at $9,200 = 52

12 RSI at $8,400 = 68 




This falls under the category of trading ideas that sound clever on paper but usually end up just losing money.

Especially with BTC, setting 1.5% stops on a long/short from the same entry is asking to get chopped up. The better play for opening a long/short is when there's a wedge forming (of any kind). Open your long at the bottom of the oscillation and the short at the top. If you've got $100+ between your entries, it makes a lot more sense if you're trying to catch a candle. 
Not so smart because we had lots of considerable fake outs before the bigger movements. It would stop his wining bet and leave the losing one to be also stopped.
That move requires manual stops to be safer and a movement far greater than his stop limits because he will only start wining after 1.5% + fees, so if the movement is just 2-3% might not be worth it.
seems silly when you can just use 2 stop entries and therefore save on fees
That is what we saw with the last BGD (8100-8400).
Why would that concern you? Don't you have a hodl stack? 
Good bot
I don't like you
Thank you. No volume so we know this isn't happening soon.
You’re exactly right! It’s hard to get out without hodlers panic selling with low volume though. 
Oh man how embarrassing. Well it all turned out well in the end I suppose....
That's true, we will see what happens.
Sir please take into account the sub of the day promotion in your calculations. I purchase my tuna subs each friday for 4$ and refrigerate the other 6 for the rest of the week. Therefore i was only short 3.50 today. :P
the weekly is too long of a timeframe to be useful IMO and also it's stayed oversold and crossed over and back since Jan 8th
I'm implying the trend is true... until it isn't.  But really, if you're betting against something that has happened 5 or 6 times in a row, then you're essentially gambling.  Another way to put it - at this point in BTC's market cycle, that trend is extremely accurate.  

I am watching for signs of prolonged accumulation, which would essentially be months of sideways.  At that point, the indicator will likely fail considerably.  But for the time being, this volatility cannot be sustained, which is essentially what the indicator is saying.
What can we look for to confirm a rising wedge? Lower volume?
Yeah that explains it.
Do you know what happens in the fable of the golden goose?
I think this is far-fetched too, but haven't exchanges been raising fees recently to cope with decreased volume?
Actual fucking proof. That's what I would need. Thanks for asking.
You cook, too? oo la la, the whole package! :P

edit: my brother was acquiring at that time. Mentioned it a couple times, but I never dove in. Oh well.
Below $200 about a day the first time. I guess I got lucky buying my first bitcoin on that day... about January 2nd or 3rd. You're right it did not stay below $200 long the second time. 

https://i.imgur.com/err0v4I.jpg
For once i'm glad i'm out of position... Almost entered a short @7960...
Going to set alarms @8000 and 8100 and going to sleep.

'the master of rationality'... You mean basic common sense right?

Not exactly ground breaking theory is it. 
I've technically stopped being a holder almost a dozen times now between $20,000 and $6,000. 

Whenever I open a hedge, what I'm doing is opening a short that's of equal value to the amount of BTC I have in cold storage. 

So I stopped being a holder at $19,100 and started being a holder again at $17,700. 

I stopped being a holder at $11,700 and started being a holder again at $9,800. etc.

From a technical standpoint, I'm not at holder at this very moment. Since I effectively sold everything at $8,330 when I opened my most recent hedge short. 

But I think your real question is: "when will I cash out everything and stop trading or holding bitcoin." 

And the answer to that question is that I'm still quite a ways off from being able to do that. 

I'd only really call it a day if I were to acquire enough wealth via trading btc so that nobody in my family ever has to work again unless we chose to. And even with all of my recent successful trades, I'm still only about 10% of the way there. 

So if btc were to rise to $80,000 per btc then perhaps I'd sell everything and throw in the towel. Provided I don't do anything stupid between here and there and lose any substantial portion of the btc I've accumulated.
True, finally happening now though.
One could argue the same for the "obviously manufactured" pump that got us here..... Price would have to go above 9k for bears to begin to worry. 
If you think it is greater than it definitely is. 
noob here but isn't it better to be making many small profits where you're more certain, rather than holding out for larger profits in an area you're less certain?
Thanks, much appreciated. I just closed my short from 8250. Would rather take profits as we go down. If we drop back below 7800 with conviction, I'll re-open.
I think manipulations serve one purpose only, to change the behavior. Once the behavior is changed, no one cares when they start making money.

These manipulations are very critical in analyzing the market (at least for me). I try to determine what direction the manipulator wants to go to, I then go in the same direction.
Seems like we're knocking on 8k's door but no one's answering right now, might be people/bots trading this bull div?
Thanks, that makes a lot of sense. I actually couldn't imagine what OP was talking about so just trying to take a stab, even if wrong. This is quite a helpful summary -- appreciate it.

In fact, it could be argued that Bitcoin Cash is closer to the Bitcoin that Satoshi envisioned, so to call it a scam simply because it uses the same name is just wrong.

That being said I dont think bitcoin cash will ever overtake the original bitcoin, no matter how much better the tech may be.

Seriously, read the post. who wants to censor bitcoin cash?    
this is not about winning in a few years.

this is about protecting noobs from being fleeced by a group of known scammers.

It has nothing to do with censorship but with disarming criminals.
>I’m just saying that censoring the competition...

Can we drop this meme already? Nobody is censuring anyone, they just blocked the @bitcoin handle, other handles can and still do spread the bcash propaganda freely.

You're starting to get it :) Trying to switch from bearish to bullish and back all the time will lose most people money. Sticking to shorting the tops or longing the bottoms is much easier than doing both. 

Given the trend since January, can you really blame him? 
The broken clock comparison does sound vapid, especially when you consider that we are in a bear market.  
Friend i am assuring you that bitcoin price can only go up over weeks. Even billionaire Tom Soros is buying it now.
Here to help you my friend
Bitcoin is always at its "true value".
Take it easy dude,. You might be right. Its just that I hate it when we are about to break up and people start coming and saying we are going to go down.

Can you please share that cloud, there might be some good information in it.  


Both of your posts below are quite informative. Unfortunately, I don't know how to read or write complex charts like those, so I understood what you said and agree with some of the said points. 
It just made me feel excluded. I get so jelous of the tax return people. :( Then again I am working for myself, so that's a plus. 

I wonder how many people pay vs don't pay.
bitcoin.tax or cointracking.info will be your big friends
Oh I see - I never even noticed that little tab/arrow. So with a stop market order I just set the trigger price and it executes at the closest available price basically?
I dont trade bitcoin

Where can I spend my segwit or LN Bitcoin at? Which stores? Where are the large retailers signing up to implement LN? 
Thanks Chew. At this point it’s just trail and error for me. Even if I throw up a chart that I believe is right, constructive criticism is always good for a beginner. 
I consider it very healthy. That ascending channel was unsustainable, but i was hoping it would hold out a bit more.
Thank you. 
Sigh. The broken clock makes a surprise reappearance twice in one day on the sub.
Guessing the market is a trader's profession.
I agree with your reasoning and I think it’s probable that there is a connection. If you ever want to discuss the impact of geopolitical happenings without the downvote brigade, please feel free to PM me. 
I can tell lol, was simply pointing out what I see. That’s all 
is it completely enpty? If not, I’d try to make due with what I have left
100% agree with this take. Thanks for hunting down the great historical examples 
Yes. My CA is about 8150. I didn't have the nerves to double my position up at 8350, so I only added about 25%. Feels obvious in hindsight, but the number and size of those green candles one after another was freaking me out.
the downsides of being a busy 16 year old
exactly man, this is /r/bitcoinmarkets, people can go to other hodl subs if they don't like all the trading stuff here
Man I love programming!
Agreed, just wondering if that's his rationale or what 
You're right, this was a hasty trade because I became impatient during the 8030-8100 zone. Got stopped out of my long at 7950, also closing this short basically at break even so I've actually lost a tiny amount on fees. There was a move but not a huge one. Someone has been flashing a 350 BTC bid for a while and actually did soak up the whole amount at 7950, wonder why.
Hey, TriangleSushi, just a quick heads-up:  
**therefor** is actually spelled **therefore**. You can remember it by **ends with -fore**.  
Have a nice day!

No, not anymore. I consider Bitcoin a niche and wouldn't buy it for more than 1-3k. This whole "we will one day pay our coffee with bitcoin" narrative sounds extremely stupid to me, it's very impratical for that usage. Remains evading taxes / money laundering (but anon coins do it better) and gambling I suppose. Niche.

Oh man, it was great fun in another wise painful time: no embarrassment to be had whatsoever. I'm amazed you stuck with those bubble-watch charts as long as you did. Cheers!
good luck, careful not to fomo into a trade 
you can have extra 20% if u use a gift card bought with BTC.
Yes, volume decreasing as the price rises strengthens the case of a rising wedge breaking down

Exchange collapse is a fact of life.
I have a hard time believing exchanges are struggling to make enough money.
I have spices in my cabinet that are at least 2.5 years old...that data point alone should give you all you need to evaluate my cooking prowess, lol. 

Are you a guy or girl? For some reason your name comes off as feminine to me, but I don't understand why linguistically
I'm not just talking about his recent comment. The guy always talks real. He's one of the few on here I've got a lot of respect for. 
you need to start a chewy hate club with gypsytoy
What leverage do you follow for your short hedge? 1x? Does that mean an amount equivalent to 50% of the cold storage will have to be on Mex?  
I wouldn't read too much into it either way.

Buyers are cautious of buying above $8,000 because of the rejection from $8,500.

Sellers are cautious of selling below $8,000 because of the previous bounce off of $7,800 that catapulted the market to $8,500. 

One side will concede at some point today and we'll either see a strong push to $8,200 before there's another "decision point" on the part of buyers/sellers or the market will drop below $7,800 and we'll have a similar standoff at $7,500.

Nobody cares about bcash any more. The name stealing coup failed. Let's just laugh at Ver' s instability instead. 
I think you completely understood what I was saying , and I’ve been in the bitcoin community  for a while , I’ve just never used reddit prior to 2 years 
More excellence, please.
you. And you want Twitter support to help.  
Oh I don’t know , trying to boycott their twitter page maybe that? And not to talk about bitcoin sub reddit one of the most  censored sub Reddit’s I’ve seen , I’m completely against censorship to different ideals , if you don’t agree argue with them and learn from it , don’t silence them
If they're truly scamming people and acting illegally then it needs to be brought to Twitter's attention. This is something they should be handling.
How is a fork of the bitcoin ledger a scam?

Well played, trollmeister 
Yeah, some dude pulled off it with the 8450 pump. Literally 10 seconds lag between send and pump.

This is the most beginner friendly, exhaustive and clear resource I've found out there to pick up TA.
Don't feel excluded. Tax returns just mean you paid too much in the first place. There is an opportunity cost to not having that money in hand until it is returned.
Exactly right
which is 100% irrelevant to the discussion

you posted on r/bitcoinmarkets
let him in!!!!
That’s gambling my friend, not trading . 
The downvotes don't bother me at all.  Its not they "mean" anything.
Basically completely empty.  A couple thousand sats left - not enough to scalp effectively.

Going to have to deposit if I want to keep playing the game. 


bitcoin is a new asset class, not a way to buy coffee. Right now, Bitcoin is the only asset that is easily transferable across borders without intermediaries and also readily exchangeable for fiat (and will remain so until Monero is easily exchangeable for fiat). Eventually, one of the interoperability protocols like Aion will make it easy to buy coffee with any asset you own (including Bitcoin, fiat, Apple stock or the 20% interest you own in a Beijing condo) without credit card fees. But that's not what Bitcoin is for. 

Idk if it goes to $1-2k but I'd much rather be long from $7k for a year from now than short. 
Outstanding, thanks for your help!
Has there been any indication of this? Not sure I know how to read volume - should we be comparing it to the volume on the most recent rise?
Edit: It looks like it's decreasing to me. 
Did you say bitcoin and old spice? https://www.coindesk.com/mel-b-record-bitcoin/
haha guy. My name was the result of trying to come up with a unique AOL Instant Messanger screenname 15 years ago and mashing on the keyboard until I got something that I thought sounded cool.

^#deadserious
My hedge positions are on 10x leverage using 10% of my cold storage. 

I'd honestly be a lot more comfortable with them if I changed to 5x leverage, but that would mean I'd need to expose 20% of my cold storage to counter party risk. Which is not something I'm really interested in doing.
I originally opened my short position at 8120. I added last night at 8350, but not heavily. It pulled by CA up to 8160. My position still wasn't the size I wanted, and we're in agreement that it should move decisively one way or another. I'm obviously expecting down, as we haven't tested support on anything between 6900 and 7600 since the big green candle. I went ahead and added to the position size I wanted (50% increase) at 7995 just now. CA now 8100, and setting breakeven stops this time.

Wouldn't their Twitter page rightfully be '@bitcoincash'? and anything otherwise is pure deception 
nobody is complaining about bitcoin gold or any of the other forks.

It is the people involved with bcash and the way they try to deceive people into buying that thing.

 
Is the timeout chair comfy?

And you, too. You can have this debate without calling people names.
Eh it doesn't go straight down. $3k is a lot more likely than $20k imo 
Appreciate it mate, will definitely go through this in my free time. Was actually looking for something like this. Cheers!
perhaps he thinks this sub is supposed to be the same circlejerk as ethtrader (where nobody is actually trading anyway lol)
Trading is gambling. 
fair enough, just thought I’d offer. 
> Bitcoin is the only asset that is easily transferable across borders without intermediaries

how? wouldn't you always need to go through an exchange like Bitfinex to change it to/from fiat?
I'm not really comfortable shorting here either because it doesn't matter what I think it's worth, what matters is what people think it's worth and supply/demand. There is little supply left in the books, ofc it can appear out of nowhere in case of black swan or whale cashing out but counting on it is gambling. It don't see any upside to your examples compared to existing means of payment.
Yeah I'd just compare it relative to prior volume  but I'm far from a TA expert. In general if you just scroll back several days/weeks our volume is getting smaller 
Lmao it sounds like a word for some German female thing 
Do you use leverage when you enter a new long positions as well?  
Great, makes sense. As per my math, if you're using 10x leverage you could expose (1/(leverage +1))% of your cold storage i.e. 9.0909%. 
I'm deciding about each side of 8k like this. Is it a bear market or a bull one. Once I decided that (currently bull) I trade accordingly.

I mean to them they are the real bitcoin , and to you , you guys are the real bitcoin so why should we  get it? In the perfect scenario  there should be no one having that account , since no one owns bitcoin , but that will never happen

It's plated in bitcoin.

Yes, but less.

Usually 3x or 5x.

EDIT: In the grand scheme of things, I'm actually not using very high leverage AT ALL in comparison to my cold storage. 

When I'm short 10x of my trading stack, I'm actually in a neutral position.

When I'm long 5x of my trading stack, I'm only 1.5x long in relation to my cold storage. 

This is why I often set stops higher or lower than someone trading on high leverage would be able to tolerate.

No, to them they are the better bitcoin , not the real bitcoin. If you read the Twitter, you'd realise their exclusive aim is to undermine bitcoin.
gaining market share? 

What btc/bch chart are you looking at?

Maybe you should ask one of the poor souls that got tricked into buying bitcoin cash (there you go buddy) at 0.5 btc how that market share thing of yours is going.


Still look exactly like gambling to me.
You know, I actually think that's what it was. And now that you explained it his name doesn't seem feminine anymore, because I really think it was the "frau" jumbled up in there that was tripping my brain up
And as I said before I don’t agree the slightest of what they do , but is removing  their account the answer? I don’t think so 
>If you read the Twitter, you'd realise their exclusive aim is to undermine bitcoin.

Bitcoin Cash is the side of the fork designed to rescue bitcoin from economically illiterate central planners. Nobody cares more about bitcoin more passionately than the BCH crowd.  
Once again, I don't want their account removed, by aIl means keep the followers, simply rename it bitcoin cash.
He problem is that to them they are the real bitcoin , in my opinion there should be no media accounts using the name bitcoin because it’s not owned by anyone , but that will never happen , so I think the 2nd way to do it is simply letting everyone have whatever they want , to make it as balanced as possible
