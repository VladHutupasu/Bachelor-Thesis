Taking a trip back in time today ponder and reflect on how far the bitcoin and cryptocurrency ecosystem has come over the last four years; the stories, the fears, the pain, the laughs and the love of bitcoin via the users of this community. Here are the last daily threads from this date exactly one, two, three, and four years ago. It's interesting to see the commentary from back then on what the members discussed.

Lets begin and I will walk you through the last four years:

The month of April 2014 was five months after Bitcoin blew up into it's last bubble to an all time high about $1,000 for the first time in November/December of 2013. In the months after, Bitcoin took a pretty serious battering from bears, dropping to the low 400s by the date of this thread. This feels very similar to where we are now because we hit our ATH in December of last year, and have retraced a similar percentage in comparison. The despair is evident in the thread back then. Lots of blaming 'PBOC'. Funny to remember that China was such a big fear back then. In the months after this, Bitcoin did rise to over $600 that summer, Only to sink below $300 by the start of 2015, touching a low of $160 (Ouch).

 In hindsight, this is one of the best times to have entered the Bitcoin speculation space in the last 5 years. GBTC becomes available this year in most brokerage accounts, which allows most US Citizens to buy Bitcoin in their Roth IRA(tax free gains). This is also one of the darkest, most painful time to live through for bitcoin speculators/hodlers (myself included) that came on board at peak of 2013. Complete devastation as $1,100 has now retraced to less than $250. For context, if we see a similar retracement from our ATH, that would put us from about $19,950 -> $4,200. Luckily we seam to be healthy above 5k but who knows. Anyways, reading the discussion is interesting looking back. A lot of despair, even the top thread, u/rabidmonkey1 has capitulated and sold all of his holdings, presumably in the $290 range based on his/her comments. Many users are debating actual bitcoin fundamentals, and suspecting further lows below $100. While others are happy with being in the 200-300 range. Interesting look at Bitcoin's last great bear market.

Funny how Bitcoin is exactly the same price it was almost exactly two years prior. This was a good sideways year up until that point. Starting in January in the 400 range and cruising along up until this thread's point. Bitcoin will continue it's rise through the summer to a peak above $700, and hanging out in the $600 range the next fall, ultimately ending the year an inch shy of 1K. Posters comment how Steam has re-enabled Bitcoin payments. 

Interesting comment from u/BlackSpidy

> So, bitcoin's current value is about 38.6% of the ATH. My best guess at when we'll be regularly trading above $1000 is maybe... Late 2017.
> 
> I think bitcoin is pulling off a great recovery from a bubble that saw its value go up 100 times in less than two years. Do assets that go through such drastic bubbles recover this much in this timeframe?

2016 was a dramatic year for Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies. Four months later, one of the largest hacks to affect a Bitcoin exchange happened. [On August, 2nd 2016, Bitfinex announced that over 120,000 BTC was stolen via a hacker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitfinex_hack). This was a massive event, and it caused Bitcoin to rocket below $600. The community manager for Bitfinex at the time was active on this subreddit and added further explation to issue. 

Also drama during the summer of 2016, Ethereum suffered [ the Dao hack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_\(organization\)), which caused a massive crack in the Ethereum ecosystem with the decision to hard fork and correct the error that July. This was the origin of the now competing blockchains Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. It was quite a fun summer!

Oh 2017. How has it only been one year? Why does it feel like Bitcoin is so different now? One year ago today, we were inching are way on top of $1,000. A month before in March 2017 we saw the SEC strike down the hammer and reject our coveted COIN ETF and SolidX prospectus to list ETFs. Our dreams were crushed. But alas if only we knew what would unfold in the later months. We were still dealing with fallout from the Bitfinex hack, and their solution was to credit all affected users with the haircut with "BFX" tokens, that were slowly redeemable by the exchagne to slowly pay back users.

u/shadowboyah Provides some excellent commments on the situation in his comment: 
> Prediction :
> 
> The situation on BFX will get worse, which is bullish for the price. Let me explain why :
> 
> 1) Some arbitreurs will realise that holding Bitcoin is better than trying to profit from the price difference, hence they will buy back and stop selling at BFX.
> 
> 2) Some people will buy from other exchanges, in order to cover their short positions on BFX (so that they don't get margin called).
> 
> 3) Some people are buying Bitcoin and depositing it to Bitfinex to earn interest (we are seeing the cost of borrowing going down already probably because of this. More Bitcoins lend, lower interest rates)
> 
> 4) Risk takers will realise that the best place to take a risky leveraged long on Bitcoin is Bitfinex for the following reasons :
> 
> a) Cheap margin available (low cost to borrow USD to buy Bitcoin, lower than Kraken, OKC and Bitmex)
> 
> b) There is a constant amount of USD in the exchange, but a declining amount of Bitcoin in the exchange as people withdraw Bitcoin only. At some point, there might be a balance between bitcoin deposits and withdrawals, but I don't see when this could happen.

Well here we are. We are living through exciting times for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, and are five months out of the largest bubble in Bitcoin's history. No one knows what the future will hold, whether the ETFs will come^soon , if Mcaffee will eat a dick, if BTC will go to zero or the moon but the important thing is where are living in a modern world of change, and I'd bet that crypto is here to stay. And it's been a damn fun journey so far. I wish all of you many profits and BTCs to be had! Cheers
Point and Figure https://i.imgur.com/N4eJMZv.png  We are in a long column of 12 O's.  47/57 long poles in the last 12 months have gone beyond 12 O's.  A 50% retrace of this column would bring us to $9028 or higher.  Our range is between $7,776 and $9,776.  Out of the 42 long poles this year, there are only 2 unresolved long poles. From April 13, we must retrace to at least 7,473 to resolve a long pole of X's. From April 21, we must retrace below 8,505 to resolve a long pole of X's.

Resistance: I have been preaching about 9.9k-10k being a major resistance level, being the first major higher high after the log downtrend breakout, thus confirming the breakout.  Also at this level is a local 62% fib from weekly level (grey box) and trendline breakout failure @ 11.7k to the local bottom of 6k.  The next major higher high above 9.9k is at 10k, which also is a psychological level. So to break 10k is a major confirmation that bearish market is over.  https://www.tradingview.com/x/cTTfi6a7/  In this older chart, I draw 3 arrows pointing to major levels that show the bear market is over.  From bottom to top: 1. daily closes above downward log trendline.  2. New major higher high after breaking downward log trendline.  3. New major higher high after breaking 62% fib.

Well we didn't break that #2..  You didn't think we would do it on our first try did you?  :)

Support: https://www.tradingview.com/x/mwPY0nYA/  8.1k-8.2k we have support.  This would successfully retrace 50% of our PNF long pole from April 21.  At this support level we have a weekly level, a wyckoff throwback, and volume profile node.
Good news fellow frenchies, crypto gains now taxed a reasonable 19% instead of the previous unbearable 45%. Also total exemption if resell value under 5000€.

Regardless of whether or not you think this recent price action is legit, I think it is unwise to compare the crypto market today to the crypto market of 2013-2014.

There has been a fundamental shift that has happened in the last year. Crypto is about to be traded on the nasdaq. After Gox, the general sentiment was that bitcoin would die and be considered a blip on tech history.
i feel like we have clearly entered a bull market, anytime we move sideways for awhile we are probably going to go up, just like during the last 4 months everytime we moved sideways you'd have this feeling of 'oh, shit we are to go down soon.' 
After a very good day of trading on the 24th, I had an abysmal day getting chopped up yesterday. Out of position right now (except my Sept fut long from way down), and I'm trying to zoom out a bit here. 

Macro: https://www.tradingview.com/x/b1kdSMyO/  
Micro: https://www.tradingview.com/x/qdiAczz4/  

It certainly looks like a double bottom off 8650. (edit: although not visible on the 4H chart, and "double" anything on short time frames isn't particularly actionable intelligence). Interestingly, we wicked almost exactly off the line I had as the bottom of our uptrend channel since the BGD (light green). We also found support near the 8-month log line zone (purple). If I'd been awake this morning at the turn off 8650, I like to think I would have entered long at 87xx. Doing so here (8920) is significantly less appealing, but if it is a double bottom, we should at least hit 9200. The catch-22 is that if we drop back to 87xx, the bullish case weakens. 

As of now, I'm waiting on the sidelines. Of course, since I'm exercising patience this time, we'll probably rocket up to 9200, but oh well. If we pass 9200, a retest of 9700 to confirm/break a double top is a high likelihood. 

Good luck all.
2 days ago everyone was writing about how we really really need a healthy pullback to continue our run. Now that we had a 13% correction (9.8k -> 8.6k), panic and FUD everywhere. I don't know, for me it just looks pretty healthy overall. The only thing that worried me yesterday was price decreasing but longs going parabolic. That situation has somewhat evened out here. Would not short this personally. I am long with DCA 8.8k so far, buy orders until 8k, S/L at 79xx.
https://www.tradingview.com/x/qFDG6w2b/

So apparently we bounced off of the channel of /u/haserfauld (bottom on black line)n which coincides with the 0.5 fib level from the reversal from 6k to 11.7k.

We are now finding resistance at the support of the previous channel (light blue). 

My favorite bullish scenario: we break through it, find resistance at 9200, test the support of the blue channel before going to 9.5k.

I'm a bit disappointed that I closed my long from 9000 at 8700, but I opened another at 8780 (followed chewy). I opened another at 9050. If this shows strength I will scale into a big long with a target of 10k.
Long from around $8,780.

Not too far from where I closed yesterday.

The dump trendline on the 1h broke earlier today and the market just more or less bounced off the line: https://imgur.com/a/fV0NOlf

There's still potential for downside, but stops below $8,500 should be fine here.

EDIT: Removed the word "panic" before "closed," as I feel it was an inaccurate representation of my mindset at the time.
The 4hr is hovering just above the EMA50 and MACD zero line. If it goes under, that will mark the first time since the run up from 6k. Even if you were going to long here, I think it’s worth waiting to see where it closes and/if the market reacts. Even a knee jerk drop that just bounces back up could provide a better entry imo. 
Got out of my long just shy of $9000 for a small profit. Think I'm gonna take a small break and come back later tonight. I'm honestly hoping we rally to 10k soon, even if that means missing some profits on my trading stack.
[Rounded Bottom](https://www.investopedia.com/university/charts/charts10.asp)


Continuation Pattern:

>The rounded bottom continuation pattern doesn't signal the end of an uptrend, but rather occurs in the midst of it. During uptrend, the price may pullback and form a rounded bottom pattern before starting its ascent again. The rounded bottom is one type of pullback that occurs within trends. 
During a trend the price pulls back, levels off, and then begins to rise again. This forms the cup or bowl shape, similar to the reversal pattern. 



It is ***possible*** that we are seeing this, but it has yet to be confirmed and there is nothing that says it has to confirm.
I bought in, resume dump. Sorry everyone. 
Where is my favorite bear Dushmankush those days? 
As my great uncle used to say, "Well, I'll be go to hell"

If this thing has legs and, especially if it breaks 9.2 with confidence, the bullish case will be pretty hard to deny.

Longs vs. shorts is still at 60-40% on BFX, which gives me a bit of pause, but it seems there may be sufficient reserves of buy power to keep this thing chugging along. Other reservations come from 1d and 3d Stoch RSI, which both recently crossed to the downside. But, as has been pointed out before, these indicators can stay saturated for for a while during period of trending action.
June Futures seriously looks like a bargain right now on mex. 
Long from 9209. Actually it's not on margin though, so there's no leverage.
lmao @ 2000 btc buy wall on finex, it's like the avengers just showed up

edit: bah it's gone. avengers are weak.

edit 2: avengers are back baby
9200 seems to be holding VERY well. 

Edit: Nonetheless, BGD coming since it tends to be the trend 
As I mentioned I would do in my last comment, I entered a small long position now that we've broken through $9200. Another very tight stop set around $9100.

Pretty much the only reason for entering is because we broke through $9200. I'm also getting that 'bullish' feeling...
Pretty sure Bitcoin is both bullish *and* bearish right now.
Breaking up out of a bear flag... Jesus... This is about as bullish as a steak with steak sauce, served with a cheese milkshake. Hoping we can complete the cup&handle here.

I've been having vision problems, lately, and the recent price action doesn't help.

"Is that an 8 or a 9?"

Ocular migraines suck.
Really glad the rounded bottom I was watching seems to be playing out. Wanted to post it before but only now just had the time :(

Before: https://imgur.com/a/BM3KnWL

Now: https://imgur.com/a/366dAV8
Didn't catch the break but went long at $9109 and closed at $9280.  I don't think it'll go much higher before testing $9200 as support.   If $9200 holds, I'm expecting ~$9500
I was bored, so I thought I'd write an analogy of what divergence is conceptually. Obviously feel free to ignore if you already have a good handle on it.

Imagine a tug of war game where instead of both teams constantly pulling, they each get periods of time to pull as hard as they can while the other team does nothing. A hidden divergence is when one team pulls the rope even harder on their new turn than their previous turn, but they still end up losing ground. In that case, the other team has a better shot at pulling further than their previous turn even if they can't quite pull as hard as they could before. That particular situation would bring about a normal divergence, where one team can't pull the rope as hard as they could the previous turn, but they still end up gaining ground. In that case, it implies the balance of power is shifting towards the other team, it just hasn't provided results yet.


To explain a bit more (without an analogy):  

Most indicators used with divergence indicate some form of "momentum." When it's high, it means there's a lot of momentum in the buying direction and when it's low it means there's been a lot of selling momentum lately.

If the price is making a lower high but the indicator a higher high, it means that even with more recent momentum than you had at the previous high the market still wasn't even able to beat that previous high, which is a bad sign (hidden bear).

If the price is making a lower low, but the indicator a higher low, it means that the new low was made with less selling momentum than the previous low, which implies the momentum is shifting towards the buy side (normal bull divergence). The reason people are somewhat cautious trading off those immediately is that the momentum is shifting bullish, but there could be many (or not) lower lows before the momentum actually crosses to the buy side and the trend reverses.

Obviously, there's a similar reasoning for a hidden bulls/normal bears just in reverse.
Im buying the dip. I didnt draw a line, I snorted one. Entered long @8690. Currently in a heavy long position in ETH at 555 EUR, slowly averaged down since drop to 490ish EUR, havent had time to check break even level. Playing with those mental stops today cause Im high as a kite. ETH seems to be consolidating and theres a nice symmetrical triangle going on. Will keep eye on either side of breakout. BTC tested 8600ish levels 3 times already, perhaps a little bounce up is justified.
Did not trade for 24h and took some profit above 9200 and off some alts
Incredible what a peace of mind it brings :D
Never hit my limit long of 8745.  Starting to wonder if bears have run out of steam or if they have one more push.

Edit:  Moved my limit long up from 8745.  5% at 8845, 5% at 8855 with 2x leverage.  Canceled 8745 limit. Bear volume looks low to me.  Hoping they can get low enough to grab one or both of my entries, looking for more bull volume.  Trying to be careful I'm not chasing something that isn't there.

Edit. Canceled all orders, going to look for better spot. I won't second guess chewtoy.

MGD while longs are closing? After a daylong test of our support area around 8700 as the result of the retrace everyone was waiting for? Bullish af.  Nevertheless i closed my long here from DCA 8.8k. Will re open if 9.2 breaks.
Even though I said I was taking a break until later tonight, I think if we see a strong push through 9200 I may have to enter back in.
I missed my entry earlier at 8770 by a few dollars and decided to wait. When is a good place to buy back in? After we break 9200? 
We are fully back in the ascending channel that we broke out of 24 hours ago.  Though anyway, better to go by the redrawn widened version.

(I can share a chart if you want, but there are plenty examples of this channel if you scroll down.  And my chart has like 12 other lines on it)
Haven't been able to get into GDAX all afternoon, on any browser, on any network. I'm starting to get pissed off but have literally zero recourse except whining on Reddit.
If we were spending time above 8900 I'd be a lot less bearish (I was bullish yesterday when we weren't closing candles below 8900).

Reasons I am bearish now. High volume sell offs often have continuation. Daily bearish engulfing (find me the last one with a small shadow that didn't have continuation).  We just had a big move up (at some point there has to be a pull back). We rejected from a level that is significant on higher timeframes (https://imgur.com/nZXYL7J). Often after breaking a significant down trend line you set a high and then there is a pull back to find a new low (if bullish you set a higher low and then make a higher high). Finally, the current lower timeframe structure also looks bearish to me, like a complex h&s that is consolidating below the neckline (https://imgur.com/a/UpOqBi9).
Alright, bears, which threshold do we need to cross next? 


~~$9.2k~~

**Bull Market**


Glancing at the charts, all I see is a Biblical prophecy hailing the return of [Adam and Eve](http://thepatternsite.com/aedb.html).

That's technical, let's look at a few fundamentals.

Is development and investor interest slowing, or picking up?

-From what I have seen first hand, [picking up](https://cryptoinvestsummit.io/).


Are young demographics more or less excited about the asset than current market veterans?

-More excited, [without a doubt](https://www.bnn.ca/millennial-leaving-boring-banking-world-for-crypto-industry-1.984956).

Generational sentiment is a long-term indicator--perhaps the longest indicator-- that I use to gauge investment potential. Simply put, Baby Boomers are wrapping up their time as thought leaders. As new waves of more receptive investors take the helm, I expect capital flows into crypto to expand rapidly, if not exponentially. One day, there will be a generation of children born into a world where crypto is ubiquitous. This is approximately 30 years from now in my estimation.

I talk a big game to solicit strong opinions from those who disagree, but sometimes the tail knocks over one too many pieces of china. Expect more attempts at value-infusion in the weeks and months to come. (Third attempt to get the format right on this thing, let's hope it works.)
Long from 8853 with stop below 8500. We're gradually making higher lows on the hourly but can't get past 8950 which means it's coiling up tightly, I'm ready for a dildo.
Holy moly - does this count as breaking 9.2 with conviction? Please don't tell me this thing is going to go parabolic and implode on itself again.
At the same time we broke out of our wedge, eth broke back above it's downtrend log line.  Maybe we will see a confluence of upward momentum helping each other up from here (or maybe we already just saw it and thats it).  Gives me a little feeling we could see a decent bump up.  Again, it seemed that eth lead the way, breaking the tip of its ascending triangle, when btc then changed directions in the middle of this wedge it just broke out of.

Could of course fizzle out too ;)
Quick and dirty explanation for Gox coins moving from another forum:

>So, current shortfall to cover all initial claims (20 MUSD ?) + Coinlab provision (70 MUSD) + Tibanne provision (42 MUSD) = 16000 BTC. That seems roughly add up if we are to assume that the Court will only allow CR on the condition that all existing and potential claims / costs are covered in JPY.

The coins will be sold OTC and only with court approval after the trustee asks for it. With roadblocks out the way, gox civil rehabilitation can begin and gox victims can look forward to approx 20% of their btc back.
Closed my short from ~9200 here at 8870.

This might just be a bear flag but it looks like there's a decent chance it breaks up. I may re-enter if the situation looks clearer
Market definitely feels like it's about to explode in one direction...
Long from 8.8 - feels good. Any advice where I should set stops to avoid getting caught in the chop but still hold onto my position? I'm thinking 8950?
Bears are in denial, both price and shorts increased today.
For now we have slightly broken out of a falling wedge after finding support on the log line from 3 to 6 to 6.5k, and might be heading back to 9060. 

Fib retracements from 11.7 to 6.4 have been very much respected by traders so keep those numbers in mind.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/bctCuDyE

Don't know why the downvote brigade jumped on me, but it was a bad idea to short after a 1000$ dump and bull divs on the 1H RSI in terms of risk management. Don't follow MikeXBT or anyone else blindly, do your own research as usual.

Good luck, I'm out of the BTC market for now as it proves to be too emotional atm.
4 hour volume decreasing some, way above vwap, prob find red candle over next 4 hours and daily

I don't care if this sounds cliche but /u/_chewtoy_ is God like recently.    Thanks for the gains.
Anyone else have the exact same feeling from the 23rd? This is the exact same feeling from the 23rd for me. Besides the fact we are coming from the high 9’s instead of the low 8’s. 

8800 with a pop right to 9100-9200. We definitely have more obstacles in the way now but the feeling is definitely the same .

Essentially pick a position long or short or out. It’s gonna pop just a matter of fact which way, but a lot of indicators are pointing down. 

Long from 8777 , GL all 
Every dip is being bought up quick but then the buyers disappear, no idea what to think
Closed half my long @ 9250 earlier but wondering if I should add back to it here - what do we think the intent of the buy walls is?
Any suggestions if looking to establish a position for the next 3-5 days, with minimal adjustments? Right now for the short term I have limit buys set down to 9100, with similar size stop sells laddered under 9k (only enough to offset those particular buys). I don’t short (gdax), so trading is moving in/out of fiat. Currently about 60% in with a CA of 9050. If my limit buys hit without triggering the offsetting stops I will be 70% in. I thinking odds are we will move up further in the next few days.
you guys notice bfx no longer leading volume? friggin okex? and binance in second
as a follow up to my post 1 hour ago about bull div on 1-2 hour:  just had a large bodied green 1 hour closing far above vwap.  Still inside 2 hour cloud, finding resistance at volume node, recent daily close, failed break out point from 2 days ago.  IMO that 1 hour bull div has completed and we can move down again soon.  Support at 8.1k-8.2k likely to be touched before resistance at 9.8-9.9k.
Long from 9225
At some point, Bitcoin wasn't ever going back to 3 figures.

You'll be here to witness the last time it's 4.
Short $2 MM @ $8722. Stops at 7%. May add to this position, depending on how the market behaves. The violent rejection shows that bulls are exhausted and over extended. 
So after being out all day since the early hours of the morning, the price has moved.... $20. Looking at the charts further to my [post yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8eqr52/daily_discussion_wednesday_april_25_2018/dxz21e6/) I still think we are on track for at least 8.2k. 

Looks like triangle consolidation with declining volume before continuation, maybe we break up like before but the [short fuel](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZfEvZ3X0/) is not the same as we had when we sprung off the bottom.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/RubB2txM/ is my primary chart at the moment.

A measured move gives another target in the 8.1k range along with the other targets given before. The only thing against all of this is we are on a [4H TD9 buy](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Z8dkpwP4/) which should offer some relief. The caveat to this is the candle is yet to close so it could drop over the next 4 hours of the current candle or it can happen on the candle before or after then bounce.

Disclaimer: Short from 9500 (2x Trading Stack)

Outlook: Shorterm - Bearish Mid/Longterm - v. Bullish

edit:Fixed Link, Corrected 7.1k to 8.1k
Gox fud already priced in. Long from 8750. Let’s do this. 
let's all quietly buy...

So I’m new to TA but does the last day or so break the Adam and Eve pattern or that still a possibility despite a big red candle on the way up? 
Price volume action is looking like Feb 24 - 26 and April 4 - 6. We had a small uptrend after these periods as well.
I feel like BTC never gives you a free lunch and will squeeze every bit of blood from every major move to the very brink.  Never takes the path of least resistance.  
I can't be the only one unable to access gdax right now, can I?
I think that as ascending wedges often breakdown they will first breakdown with conviction then try to climb back above the wedge support then fail (if bulls or fomo isnt totally insane) and plummet into the abyss afterwards. 

[WEDGE](https://prnt.sc/jakohg)
Swaps $40-50 over spot, futures $20 under. o_O

We have a bullish divergence, a falling wedge, and a *potential* bullish cross on the MACD. Things are looking fairly bullish, in the short term at least. 



If I'm wrong, tell me why please.
They really came out of the woodwork yesterday. One little dip, and it's the Bitpocalpyse.

The bull's resolve is stronger than it's ever been this year. Fear is waning, confidence is waxing, and the bears are running out of coins.

It's shaping up to be a fantastic summer. Don't let Debbie Downers ruin your mood.

Still have my sights set on $10k. PentarhUdi's recent update is worth a glance. Happy trading.   
Seems to me like a very nice three wave falling wedge is being created, somewhat reminiscent of the falling wedge from 11.7k to 7.3k, albeit being much smaller in scale (run up was also less violent) 

based on the waves, and fib retrace, 8.5k is a very interesting level to watch for a reversal. Though I wouldn't be surprised if we wick through it as a fakeout, I do expect some upwards movement following it. 

Target: 9.15-9.3k 

Good Luck Chaps!

https://www.tradingview.com/x/SSxNe42k/
feels bullish, alts bullish, but until 9.1k is conquered id stay out. 3d looks like shit and would have to do a crazy retrace today or tomorrow to look good. bearish until then.    
looks very bottomy on several timeframes and the bearish volume is slightly decreasing, so maybe theres hope actually?  
I really thought the gox coins would have a much worse impact, looks very good that its holding so well..
best question ever:

**Alistair Milne**: If the Mt.Gox administrator moved BTC and Tether printed USDT of the same value at the same time ... would the Bitcoin price move at all? \(16.000 btc moved = \~ 128 million$ and as far as i know 130 million $ worth tether issued.\)
still hodling my long from 9470. Pray for me :D
We seem to be skirting this red trend line that keeps flipping support and resistance. Right now it's acting as resistance, and it will be interesting to see how the night plays out.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/ot9ltL7V/

I won't be watching since I'm going to bed, but I'm riding my all-in 5x long from 8750 (thanks to chewy for the nudge when we dropped--I posted bullish this morning but we were at 89xx and didn't like the entry). I'd really rather not get stopped out of this position prematurely, but neither am I going to watch a solid winner turn into a loser, so I'm setting stops for 30% below 9K and the rest below 8850. I would sleep so much better if this pops over that line, but that's consolidating around 9400. Doesn't feel likely in the next hour. 

Still holding my Sep futures long from 6410, and I'm grudgingly thinking I'll set my stops at 9K for real this time.

Good luck all.
Notice how strong the 8.5K level holds - any hint of bearish momentum dries up the closer 8.5 gets tested.  Longs have been increasing at a higher rate showing that the dip is being bought up in a frenzy whenever it seems like 8.5 could be breached.

I never wanted a pulback in the first place, but as someone tried to explain it to me earlier, I agreed with him that the growth in price didn't looked sustainable.

Now this whole pullback has messed things up. Since the opening of today, I have been feeling that we will visit sub $8,600, it could bounce or turn ugly. Lets see.
No reactions to a buy wall. 100BTC sold as a reaction of similar sell wall. Hmm interesting!

Respecting the bear pennant?
If we go back to barting for a while then we should see a BGD soon since this is a textbook bear flag.
Bearish TK cross soon to appear on the 6h (in 2-3 candles time in the absence of a new local high/low). 

6h: https://www.tradingview.com/x/SfLkS5Xn

There's a chance we may jump as the lagging span hits the shoulder of last weekend's consolidation, but it's unlikely to take price above the momentum lines. In fact, imo, it's more likely to drop rather than jump. Kumo and kijun support on this chart are approx. 8.5k
Could we be seeing a repeat? https://i.imgur.com/1i7x4RC.png

Just noticed that ever since bitmex added the depth chart, I have become worse at trading, and have become more often scared out of or sucked into positions when seeing where flats and walls are.  Gonna kill that widget.
waiting to see the how the candle close in 20 mins time, shooting star means we are going back into the wedge
Day 1 of beginning to learn some TA.  Day 2 of trading.  I suck at this and I know.  Only by doing this will I learn.  Feel free to critique.  Thanks!

I'm looking at [this](https://imgur.com/a/7OhFs7H).

Red line indicating lowering bearish volume.  Green line indicating my target entry.

I learned that lowering bearish volume is an indicator of bulls still feeling as they have some control of market.  Each dip has had lower volume than the last.  I'm looking to grab a position.

Targeting a long position with a limit set at 8745(my green line) with 5% of stack at 2x leverage.  I've set a stop loss at todays lowest wick as I don't believe we will go below that with the decreased bearish volume.  We might not reach my target entry which is fine with me.  It means I avoid the uncertain time.

Edit:  Incorrect amount listed for limit order.  Fixed.

Edit: 1236 EST.  Limit order still in place.  RSI is hovering 40-42.  If we get any movement down I think my entry is still good as the RSI will drop closer to 30.  I think the market is pretty bullish right now, just hesitant after our drop yesterday.
I need some help on how to go long on Kraken. Let's say I have .05 bitcoin in my account. I want to go 5x long. My .05 will be .25 correct? How much do I enter on the "amount of XBT to buy" field? 
Entered a small long @ $8859. Very tight stop set around $8700. Aiming for an exit around at least $9000.

Reasoning: RSI holding steady in 40 - 50 range. On balance volume is low but rising. MACD is over the signal line on the hourly.
Anyone notice trades disappearing of the Trade History in Gdax? I flip back and forth and few large sells were gone?
For US taxes - is it legal to split up your income by buying two opposite positions (say long btc and short btc) and then realizing a loss on Dec 31, and selling the other position for a gain on Jan 1?


Added to my long from 8777... @ 9201 

I may be making this call early, but 9180 has held twice now. 

Will most likely bail if 9k breaks, still for a profit. Position at 9201 is much smaller than 8777. 
Adam and Eve forming?

1000 BTC buy wall on finex at 9150 flashed and disappeared, not sure what to make of that
I'm not understanding the excitement of breaking out of the short-term resistance line (from 9700). The market has had essentially *zero* reaction to it - meaning it doesn't care about it as a line. 
     -edit: we also broke upward from this line yesterday when rising over 8900; resulted in a dcb to 9200 before falling and "redrawing" the line at a lesser angle. Yesterday's bounce after breaking the line was much more vigorous than this one.

I'm not saying we won't go up from here, but I don't think that line was acting as resistance. I think price action is due to finding support instead. There is lots of support in the 8800 range.
https://www.tradingview.com/x/0ajx1BLP/

8810 looks like a pretty solid base.

Although... Can you instead take it to mean that the price keeps dropping to 8810 and will eventually break down?
Closed my long from 8800 at 9250, gonna open a short to hedge my futures.

Everything is bullish when you convince yourself hard enough!

Is anyone else seeing a lot of posts stating that "x is happening, this is bullish!" where x could be literally anything?

That's a dangerous game/mindset to play my good friends, tread carefully at this crucial moment. Try to use critical thinking and not let emotions run wild.
Restating my prediction for a 9.8 top

We will eventually break 10k, but the type of person who bought in during the mania, simply won't be here I don't believe the general public memory is that short the fact btc drop 3/4th from the ath won't be lost on them and they should be more cautious this time around; such potential buyers are hurt and licking their wounds from buying during the mania.

There is a huge element of unit/round number fallacy in this market, where a big chuck of investors are thinking "bitcoin is expensive at 9k, let me buy some shitcoin for a few dollars"

I believe we will bounce off 10k quite a few times, but twice is fairly safe assumption, and you'll see people like me joining the sell wall to buy back in probably hours after the fact, as drop down to 9k is 10% profit while hovering around 10k is a tiny lost. The push above 10k needs to happen when the irrational people are sleeping or their sell at exactly 10k gotten eaten by the *standard* buy pressure 
In know it is a short time frame, but we have an confirmed H&S on the 5m
My intuition says having dropped on huge volume from 9800, I should not be long until there's some sign of recovery evidenced by convincing volume.  Absent of the volume, the recovery would be end up being price consoldation for another leg down (bear flag).  Basically, if trading -- it would be safer right now to be in a bearish mindset unless proven otherwise.  Example: BTC was bearish until the BGD from 6.8 to 7.8k.  In theory, we need something similar to be convinced of a bullish breakout. 
This action is clearly playing out on the 2h chart. Kumo base holding strong, but some gnarly kijun resistance to break now. Recovery target of 9.4k.

2h: https://www.tradingview.com/x/x4Yuf4M7
Quick question.  I sent my BTC/ go to cash allocation back to coinbase.  I just got back in.  I knew the fees were high but when you are buying BTC for the first time I guess you don't notice as much.  Between the premium and fees you will leave alot on the table over time. 

I was using Tether on Binance, but the more I learn the less I trust its long-term stability.  

I know it is a bit off topic, but there has to be a better/ safe option if for now you just want to go between BTC and US Dollars while you learn more about trading.  

Thanks for putting up with a noob.  I'm learning. 
Not a high level post whatsoever. 

But, pull up the 1H and the 1 day chart on GDAX. Pretty damn similar. Neat!

(On mobile, realize charts would really strengthen this post..) 



A moment of silence for all the brave souls market buying into the very tip of a bear flag....
we are still above the point where we blasted through the resistance line last Friday.

That has got to count for something 
lol this market. are we really gonna fill their shorts again? we are making it too easy. im back to cash at 9300 till the barting stops or we've held 13k for a few weeks. 
Another pump with barely any volume.  I don't trust it.  Good luck my bull friends.  
which line on the top should I use the for the wedge? the 9.7k imo is a bulltrap region https://www.tradingview.com/x/LDDj6qC2/
Should I be charting and trading on logarithmic scale instead of a linear scale? I mostly tend to chart on 1h charts and 4h charts, and once in a while I will do 1d charts. But I tend to stay within that range.
Noobie question for experienced traders. I am trading on Kraken, but it is not really good option to hold longer positions since the fees are taking a lot % if you let them roll. What is the best way or an option to open a longer time frame short or long with or without margin?
Ha. The 1h chart does the ew perfectly on the way down. Hope it does in the way up.
Holy smokes, look at that volume. Quite the contrast to the 195k\-250k I was used to seeing.
what happened? Oh a big player pulled his liquidity from the ask-side on finex, then market closed 520+ BTC long. Conclusion: (likely to be a stoprun) market confusion, liquidity shake-up.

haven't made a move in a few months, but I've been watching this 'barting' phenomenon and the market as a whole very closely the past few weeks. I was holding mostly eth but I've traded it for BTC at a nice profit, and I'm shorting 5x with everything at 9270. there is too much f*ckery going on, nothing seems organic, and CME closes tomorrow which I'm banking on. good luck everyone, and hold on to your shirts
*Still talking about BTC*

ETH/BTC seems to be bullish.  Recently this appeared to be a leading indicator for BTC/USD.

Thoughts?
$200 is a very small jump in BTC terms.
Honestly, what an absolute fool one has to be to sell btc right at the start of a new bull market. Every ask in the order book is a monument to human stupidity.
Bitcoin has thrown out some bearish signals on the 1 Day candles, lets take a look.

We can see that there was quite a lot of selling volume on the Bitcoin market yesterday and the bears took control of the 9k zone, for now.

I am looking for the market to stay above $8800 in order to remain bullish, however our trend line already broke once this morning dipping into $8700.

With this kind of market action I will usually wait to see when the bulls jump back in the party.

For now it still looks like a healthy correction and if we get a 50% retrace, some traders will seriously consider buying the dip.

Resistance is currently solid at $9000, should we consolidate below $8800 I would expect lower prices incoming.

[The green box is a possible buying opportunity](https://cryptosignals.trade/forums/topic/bitcoin-btc-technical-analysis-april-2018/#post-17597) should we see a sell-off again in the BTC market, this is not set in stone, prices could go lower or higher than what I predict.


If the 5m and 15m rsi and MACD play out, I would expect a drop into the 9100’s here. Edit: I’m trying to say that if it doesn’t happen, then bulls have the upper hand for a while longer. It would be relatively common for the 5m rsi to dip to overbought right now (since it is trending strongly down) before bouncing.
Is it just me, or does this rejection of 9.8k feel like the 11.7k rejection from February? That would be one scary-ass DCB...
wish I had held my long instead of closing for a big loss (to me). I guess I should have never expected any less than maximum pain. bitcorn can be a sumbich

We're going full bulltard again, aren't we?

About to close the biggest green 4h candle since the original BGD.
Theory: Yesterday's weak little dump was 100 percent shorted (borrowed) from Euro instruments, the same ones JPM was "buying" back in October or whatever (they weren't buying, they were covering shorts, anyway...) and they have to cover either by tomorrow at Euro market close or next week. Forced buying. Gotta love it, baby, prettiest thing in the world.
I think this has more steam once the morning gets here for EU and US. Opened long @ 9220.  Stop set at 9060 just incase. 
[deleted]
Closed my long from 8710 here. Afraid it once again might be a bit premature but I am hoping to get an even better entry at 8400.  Let’s see
Bearish engulfing candle on the 1D chart, with the highest volume we've seen since our breakout of the 6.5k "bottom."

Still considering a long for a retest of the highs
[deleted]
The time to buy will be @ $9,750.  No sooner.
https://www.cryptoground.com/mtgox-cold-wallet-monitor/ 16k BTC moved
https://www.tradingview.com/x/i0xd8XYQ/

So if 8800 support breaks, it would probably be safe to say that this big ascending wedge is completing with maximum pain. Shot up to wipe out shorts and trap longs and then KAPOW!
The good thing about this drop is that somr of the ticking time bomb underwater longs from yesterday closed. DCAing into a long here down to 8k. 
https://www.tradingview.com/x/rjPQL7p8/

Not convinced about falling to these levels because RSIs are getting too low but I'm thinking potential supports at:

8627 (0.382fib)

8550 (resistance turned support)

8273 (0.5fib)

Failing all that, 7918 (0.618 and previous support)

How does that sound?
we broke out of the falling wedge. what's the target?
Balanced. Indecisive. Up? Down? The market doesn’t know. So it creeps sideways in the dark. Buyers and sellers check the wind an wait. Which do you fear more; missing gains or taking losses? This seems like the perfect time for a whale to push the market where they want it to go. One big buy to FOMO up, or one big sell to domino down. Have to pick a side. Looks like exactly half of us will be right. Good luck. 🍀 
We have been stopped right below the 1HR cloud resistance line(9275) for over 3 hours.

Bitfinex
This is just a bounce to the trendline, to get a boost in a couple of days. 
Well on the bright side even if we go down as low as 7.8 we could then form a massive inverse head and shoulders formation to propel us past 10k. That's some hopium for ya. 
This is looking very convincing as end of our mini bull run. Any bulls left?
Lower highs, can't touch 9k for the moment. I think we'll be seeing lower lows soon, probably a test of 8.4k in the next 24 hours.
[removed]
Golden cross on the 3 day is almost certain.  By late next week, I expect us to be testing 10k.


gotta love facebook groups like "the bitcoin bears" lol. I know to smell manipulation everywhere is ridicilous - but the same way that the russian trollfarms run BOTH SJW and gunfanatic groups to divide the US; I can picture some professional trollfarms with a similair mission for Bitcoin - paid by? everybody set to loose if crypto keeps getting mainstream attention
If we don't make it back up to 9,2/9,5 by Sunday, we're gonna have one hell of a nasty weekly reversal candle.
Just closed my short from $96XX.  Have opened a long for the first time since I closed my $79XX way too early. IMO this is the first decent entry since then.

Lower blue channel in here is my buy zone: https://www.tradingview.com/x/tYkuobPR/

The biggest lesson I learned from being stopped out of 2 shorts in this move: Trade the chart, not what you think will happen. Ie: right now i think this will drop and violate the pitchfork channel; we are in a bear flag.  But the chart and pitchfork theory says this is a great spot to long. We are still with trend!!

Short from $8,735. Lets see.
Since the price is boring. A challenge, for fun


Who can write a contract or regular program that lets 2 people exchange a secret (some value) for payment in such a way that at no point one person has both the secret and the funds?

Here’s a possible problem statement:

Person A has a time series of publicly accessible values in some time frame [0,T], say the ticker price and volume of Bitcoin.

Person A wants to obtain a list of times ti where the volume for specific exchanges and the price jump according to a specific heuristic (possible encoded in the contract)

How could Person A purchase this information from another Person B such that both are guaranteed to obtain info/payment if they behave honestly

Falling wedge aside, this just looks like lower highs and lower lows to me. 

I'm underwater on a short from 8750 (so maybe grain of salt here) but can't say i'm worried yet.

Edit: are these just salty downvotes or does anyone other than /u/L1ady have an actual retort to this?
If it doesn't push now to over 9170 its just creating a lower high... Not good for bulls. Lacks follow pressure. 
It can always bull flag as usual before the next round but this is looking like a failed attempt.
I won't chase this.... still another c wave correction down coming imo. Fomo is obviously still strong up here with how fast this rise was and whales have more bags to let go up here before they push price down further.

Back to Barting?
Is this it?  Are we going up?

Why did someone come in and downvote every comment?
Tether pumped another $130mil. If that was over the last week or so could that have moved the price $1000 up? Around 14000 btc. Anyone more clued up to how that will affect the market overall?
Stop loss @ $9650. Let's dip a little.
Do you think we are going to break down any moment now. 

Upvote if you think so, downvote if you don't. I personally think it will. Gracias! 
So 8940  is resistance once again, but i feel like a re\-test of 9700 is on the cards if this breaks up. I have no idea if BTC or ETH is leading the market rn, so you could watch out for 640 on ETH aswell.  Since Prices are hovering below the resistance, i would be really uncomfortable with a short position here.
looks like a forming pennant
This looks like the start of a larger move down to me (ie a higher time frame pull back). Major support is 7800, with a lot of volume around 8100.

how asymetric is the order book on bitfinex? so many sell order placed above and so little buy orders placed downside. that is not normal, no wonder we are getting rejected.

See, but the thing is, the price is an order of magnitude higher now. You can't just say "It's traded on the Nasdaq now! Market cycles don't apply!"... that's *why* the price is an order of magnitude higher
So why has price action mirrored 2014 so well? 
I was just about to post the exact same comment.  double bottom, confirms at 9200.  if we don't make it I'll be looking to short if the green bars start getting really weak.  This could still come crashing down.
We failed to make a higher high on this last small run up. I'm expecting it to test 8600 again, and if it breaks through I'll be watching the 1H RSI and pull the trigger if/when the RSI drops into the 20's. Otherwise, I'll continue to wait for a higher high with bullish follow through. 
I’ve noticed this too and it’s ridiculous. Also, when we are pumping many bears are silent, but as soon as a small drop comes they come back out and tell us how they knew all along we were still in a bear trend.

On the flip side the bulls tend to lose their shit at small gains too. This whole tribalism is absurd. We should not have bulls versus bears, we all want the same goal, which is to make money and a successful thriving bitcoin is the best way to achieve that. It’s okay to be currently bearish or currently bullish but to be a “bull” or a “bear” is stupid as hell.
Yeah, Crypto is where noobs and morons come to lose money.
only the buy high - sell low folks
Why are you using the base as zero, instead of the bottom of the trough at 6450, which gives us a pull back of ~37%, which is within normal range of BTC pull backs.

6450->9800->8600->current price of 8832.

We had a ~52% run upwards, followed by a ~37% retract from the top, netting us a ~36% movement upwards.

All prices are GDAX.

Not everyone!!
Since i opened up a smaller long position at 8777, I would like to add to mine.

What price do you have in mind to add to your position? Assuming we break through the 9200 resistance, find it as support, then open a long from there? 
I'm curious--when you enter, do you usually just fully commit (100% stack), or is it varied? I often scale/ladder, and half the time it goes well, and half the time it really doesn't. I'm not sure I've ever seen you add to positions, so that's always been my assumption. I assume leverage does vary, except when you specifically state you're hedging (100% short 10x). 
technically I would do the same here, but because of the MtGox thing I stay out. It is not confirmed, if the trustee sells the coins OTC or at regular exchanges. 16k coins is a lot of supply short term.
Target in mind?
I've been scaling into a long around here as well, but my stops are a little higher up: just below 8600. My thought process is that we haven't seen anything below 8600 since 4/20/18, so breaking that would signify to that we're really heading lower. Are your stops below 8500 to account for a potential fakeout/bitmex over-excitement?

Just curious about your approach to stops/alarms. The R/R does seem pretty good here either way, but to me it looks like stops could be fairly safe being a little tighter.  

edit: missing words.
Tough luck 
If you look back at the past six weeks, even the past three months on certain scales, you'll see a lot of nice rounded bottoms. Sometimes an uptrend happens and you hardly notice it because of short-term anomalies (ATH for five minutes in December, little dip in Jan-Feb). If you're looking for trends, the direction is definitely up. Short-term, who knows?
Only 7% upside to go!

Longs have generally always been higher than shorts though. although I agree that less longs is better long term
Many of the permanent (26k?) longs there are unsqueezable.
i still think 9,7k is the make\-or\-break point once again. Could be another double top like 11,7k followed by a big selloff or it will continue to run up to probably 11,7k
> If this thing has legs and, especially if it breaks 9.2 with confidence, the bullish case will be pretty hard to deny.

I might say that about $11.7K, but not 9.2.   Right now, the price is trading sideways at best.

Uh oh, “cup and handle” is four letter word ‘round here.  
You are really looking at the chart with rose-colored glasses if you think the market is that bullish right now.  Look at the 1d chart.

Makes sense, although that's quite a bit of speculation.

Is this implying a cup and handle? 
Oh, and look at that, traversed directly through that cloud!
What has convinced you 9200 is support ?
great analogy!
So which case would you say we are at currently?  The price is making lower high, which is a bad sign?
That's a real nice analogy.  
To be fair as much as you seem well and truly blazed I think you may be onto something here. I can't shake the feeling that we're at a local bottom of sorts.
You seem wired. Good luck!
Any of you aware of the Mt. Gox bitcoin movement? Apparently 16K BTC just moved out of cold storage to an exchange. 
See folks, this is why you need to be able to stay away.

Opened and closed more times than I can remember in the last 2 days at "break even" for a loss of 5% to the trading stack.


Cheers my friend 🍺
I didnt have a position open over night for first time in over a week. 

God did i sleep like a fucking baby. I was actually excited to wake up and check the price.. 
If they hit, you'll probably wish they hadn't in my opinion. 

The market looks like it's either about to invalidate a bear flag or drop back to test the bottom (and possibly break down):

When things are really volatile, I like even the 1m charts to see what price points have the most volume.
You missed you entry ?

It was at 8.8k the whole day lol.

Good spot for 100x long /s
From what others said before , wait until 9200 is broken with conviction and when it turns to support seems likr a decent r/r

Unlike last time, seems like this is a gradual climb instead of a FOMO x100 train. Where last time we just blew threw 9200 right to 9700. 

TRK stated below a blow through 9200 then some consolidation/ bouncing between 9200-9300 would call for a decent long 
Next time break up the bid into a few smaller ones in a small ladder.  Even if only one of them triggers, you'd be able to add to it here for a better ca then you'll get now.
Over time, people never regret buying Bitcoin, but BOY, do they regret selling it (Yours Truly included). Time is money.

Yeah, that's some BS. I'm sending my GDAZ coin back to the mothership ASAP.
That's strange...I have several tabs on PC and mobile is accessible no problem.
I don't see the head and shoulders per se, but I definitely think you have a good point about our current consolidation being below the consolidation point established prior to the recent breakout. Good eye.
There's really not much difference between $8910 and $8890.   Don't let psychological resistance confuse you, especially for such a minor number.   $9k and $10k are bigger numbers to watch for.

Some of us don't get this.
We are following 2014 almost exactly.  Good luck.
' Alright, bears, which threshold do we need to cross next?'   8500
>I'm ready for a dildo.

That sounds like a personal problem.

But I'm looking for another run up to test 9200. I'm not sure we're going to see any 5% 15m candles any time soon, though. 
> I'm ready for a dildo.

So ambiguous.
Update: sold approx 70% of my position at 9184, leaving the rest overnight to see what happens. At least I'll be able to sleep knowing I took a nice profit. SL moved up to a little above BE.  
If it is going parabolic and shoots to moon, even now would be a reasonable entry point 
But but this time it's different..  it's very predictable , they will pump and dump again, many bulls will get trapped in again like the last fake bull run.
I am a MtGox Creditor by myself and can confirm that this is officla information from the internal Forum.

Source?  If true, that's great news for everyone.
I read the minutes from the March meeting and my memory is that what was sold between Dec-Feb already raised enough cash (~400 million USD) to cover all claims. Why is there still a 132 MUSD shortfall?
Sideways explosion it is then.
Yes, but which orifice?
8.8
I'd probably do 9000, lock in at least a 2% profit.

Disclaimer: I have no clue what I'm doing.
Yeah, there's no way i'm dropping my long at around the same entry until breakeven at this point. 
Close half @9200, if it breaks add just above 9200.
8950 seems like a good place to close if it goes back down

do you ever short past 1x (of whole stack) on leverage? 

and are you actively trading this? Just curious. Your insight is great as always 
Well, depends on which of my trades you've followed lately. 

I'm sure there are plenty of folks more than a bit salty who followed my previous long trade that I opened at $9,073 and closed at $8,760. 
he's proof that good trading is more than just luck. That said I wouldn't  follow anyone blindly.
Absolutely, he’s like 90% success rate on his trades since beginning of March 
nice timing!
In my uneducated mind, I saw the 23'rd as slightly different.  There was build up all week that was slow and steady from 17th-20th/21st.  Then Friday came and people cooled off for the weekend.  I felt like a boom on the 23rd or 24th was imminent.

Here we've just went through a quite a pullback from the 23rd.  I honestly think people want to be bullish but are hesitant after this pullback.  I think each side is kind of testing the waters again.  We are well above the 30 day moving avg, and below the 5 day moving avg.
BBs getting tight on the 1hr. I think we'll know soon. 
> Anyone else have the exact same feeling from the 23rd? 

To me it feels much more like 21-25 February. 

On February 6 we bounced on huge volume and continued to climb upwards on lower volume with little selling pressure for 13-14 days up until 11.7k. I remember during this run many people (including myself) felt like it was unsustainable. When it finally topped off at 11.7k we had a 0.431 retracement before we went up again. However, bullish momentum seemed to have been lost, volume was low and the price was thus unable to reach the 11.7k top of February 20. We double topped and we all know what happened after that. 

Our current run also started a high volume green daily candle and it was followed by 12 days of lower volume with little selling pressure, similar to the February run. I'm not going to say "fractals gonna fractal", but it's definitely possible that 9.7k was the local top. If our current retracement continues downwards I'm expecting it to bounce anywhere between 8100-8500 (0.500 and 0.382 retracement levels).

We're currently trading in a large triangle as [can be seen here](https://i.imgur.com/kyygCJR.jpg). I'm not sure if we'll break to the upside. That said, I'll definitely try to catch the wave back up and will scale into a long position. If price gets back up to 9.5k I'll employ a tight stop in case we do double top. Breaking the triangle and 10k will be very bullish signs for me.

Are you not concerned at least a little by the recent rises? I can't shake the feeling that we may have hit a local bottom.
Isn't the hourly RSI a bit low to open a short here?
Targets for today? 8500 and 8300 seem to be valid resistance-turned-supports.

Good luck on your trade.

Edit:  Actually asking, not being a pain in the ass.  Wondering if you will add to your short now that it went up a bit.
Why not have shorted yesterday? I’m confused
Short ~~$2mm~~ $2M @ $8722.
Not going to argue with MtGox movement...
yeah combined with options expiration today and like 3000 BTC in open interest that my broker shows that all need to close positions. lol.  Yeah sittin out today.  Might be some good buying opportunites coming up when the dust clears when it hits around 2k.



That sounds really bad, I don't believe you.
Think so too
you first
I think a breakdown to 8k would invalidate the pattern, even if we made it back up to 11.8k

We are still above the resistance line and the dump was completely organic, if a little exaggeration 
The pattern completes at 11.7k, and it breaks if we make a new low under 6.5k. Anything in between doesn't really matter.
The Adam and Eve hasn't been confirmed, but it is still possible to confirm it. When and if we get to 11700 without going below 6500, that would basically be confirmation.
No A&E pattern to speak of until we break 11.8k. At this point it's still just squiggles on a chart. My best recommendation would be to completely forget about it for the forseeable future.

But no, in the event we *do* continue up past 11.8k, the past day or even the next couple days wouldn't invalidate it.
Nah, I've been getting the error since mid BGD. We're able to load it on mobile though.

Where does that line originate?
I was shocked June was like 80 under during the spike so I bought some. 
Is that... bad? Or neutral? I actually don't know what anyone means when they say 'swaps' or 'spot'.
someone called his bluff real quick and dumped 100btc on him
gif or it didn't happen.
Probably Bitfinex itself spoofing.
Sperm whale just showing how big his dick is 
That would be on bitfinex order book
2k buys straight through the book for over 30k
Pretty chart and solid analysis. That bull div is also present on basic RSI, though more slight. But I like being a party pooper, so to play devil's advocate:

- Nature of Stoch RSI is to provide a lot more signals, but it also provides a lot more false signals. One recommendation I've seen is to mostly consider the signals that go with the trend. On the hourly we're in a down trend, so a bull div may not be an overly strong signal.
- In the same vein, I'm wary to trust Stoch RSI on low time frames.
- More generally about that divergence, it may have already played out - it occurred before this recent bounce. Don't go chasing divergences, you may have already missed the boat.
- Falling wedge has plenty of runway left. I believe the average wedge breaks somewhere around 60% of the way to the convergence of the lines; we're about there but it could certainly take another leg down.
- Potential bullish MACD cross; don't count your chickens before they hatch. (Edit: just crossed, but barely and it still has 50 min before confirmation)

Again, mostly just playing devil's advocate here. Carry on.
is there hidden divergence and "visible" divergence? or is it implied hidden divergence whenever RSI div. is mentioned?
[deleted]
I think we are in a recovery.

I was pretty pissed off by the 9750 fuckery and FOMO run, but I’m happy now. I just want slow and sustainable.

Hope moonboys learned their lesson, and quite confident we retest 10k in early May
And what would the trustee do with those Tethers you think? 
Swap them for fiat, which means BFX needs to buy those Tethers back with real dollars..


[deleted]
Don't be me that rode a short from 8100 up to 9k8. Wasn't getting liquidated until 10k5 even so i lost 30% trading stack closing it @9100. Could have held on for a while more but the risk of it going up was high and this time there was no expected retrace to save me.
If you have free margin open a short to hedge the long so you don't lose more.
Pray like in R.I.P?
this is only a question of time.
Hope you’re still holding it. 
Sell 9.2k buy 10k.  profit!


What if I told you that this was the dump. We were at 9700 two days ago
[deleted]
And your fiat will depreciate in value every second you hold it.  But OK, it's your energy. Spend it as you wish.

Yes, fiat is guaranteed to lose value over time.  It's a design feature.
they said not to look into that btw...they said movement likely doesn't mean anything 
Means nothing. The bankruptcy requirements were covered by the $400M of sales in December. At this point it's in the court's hands whether the coins gets liquidated and the proceeds go to Mark or if the coins get distributed to the account holders who lost their coins.
Why does 8k coins seem to me like a small amount?
2014,2018, next goxxing in 2022. 4 years like the halvening.
I feel like you can't really expect a whole lot out of alt discussion in general since most of it seems like a bunch of PnDs. like, alts are even more speculative than btc and btc is already insanely speculative
I removed every top comment from that thread, and about half the comments in this thread. Including yours. ;)

It appears the sub has hit an ebullient phase.
Well America is awake and the price hasn't shit the bed. So that's something.
The thing about opening the more profitable positions, is that they often have this icky feeling about them at the beginning like you describe.

I'm not saying though that because going long here feels shitty, that that implies it will succeed.

Just saying that you can't let that *feeling* get in your way if you have other reasons and a plan.
Hmm I never thought about that before...
BRD you mean?
thats what i thought so too, hopefully we dont see a double top though.. i have a feeling we'll break through it this time. this reversal seems way more aggressive than the last time we went from 12k to 9k to 12k
I feel like this is a bear trap and about to pop soon also.
I feel almost all alts are going up, btc tends to follow much later. Also the fact that 8700 never really fell after many attempts tells me we are going up. 
I don't follow alts much, but from what i understand alts move when bitcoin goes sideways (as it is doing). Then whenever bitcoin chooses a direction alts follow. Probably an oversimplification, but that's the gist of the cycle from what i understand. 

Would love some clarification if anybody's got input on this.
Alt coins have been leading the rally
Agreed, that's a good indicator. It's been dead for a while (even the last run it didn't move) and that's a massive green light imho and I'm reassured in my position.
A bunch of alts are green again - XLM too.

Does anyone know *why* Bitcoin tends to follow Litecoin? I thought Bitcoin was the one that leads the market.
Potential for a very large inverse head and shoulders on LTC 
For once I observed ETH lagging behind BTC on the little bump up we saw, and they're stalling out and looking to iterate again on the coil since no volume.  I won't feel the market vibes unless ETH breaks too.
Looking at Bitmex order books is almost counter productive at times.

I always have the bfx order book / depth graph and trade history open while using Mex.
Yeah shooting star on lower time frames, I'd believe it too if it materializes on the 1hr.  (only learned about this formation recently)

Edit: so we get a doji, maybe similar prognosis to the shooting star. Let's see if that turns out to be the local peak.
One tip I can share is that it can be helpful to break that limit into a few smaller ones laddered across a range.  To help avoid missing the buy by $1.  (of course, that could just end up with you having a smaller position than you wanted, if you center the ladder on your target and we exactly hit your target)
You need to put 0.25

I'm new, but I believe you just select .05 as your amount, and select the 5x leverage button.  It does the rest?  I could be wrong!
I think they just had a brief (partial?) server outage. I had trouble getting on there for a bit.
its called 'end of year tax move' and every business in the world does it.

Sure but I fail to see how that would work. If you take a loss on purpose you still have to make up the money you lost.
It seems like cheating the system or something but I can't think of anything that would make it illegal. Someone more informed should answer though.
With two bottoms at 6000? If that is what you mean, then yeah, it's *forming*, but it can easily fail to confirm.
9065 was resistance turned support.
First mistake of shorting, don’t do it when it’s pumping. Wait for confirmation.

Balls to the wall. 
Curious why you chose 9115...
The hidden divergence is kind of weak but, ya, it's there.
Sounds like this could be a good spot to short. 
We're about 150 away from confirmation on an A&E double bottom on the 1 hour. Market looks very undecided at this point.
If we can't breach 8950 in a hurry here, we also have the makings of a shallow descending triangle forming to support that case: https://www.tradingview.com/x/KMKgNWqq/

At this stage, we can't retest the floor without breaking the uptrend channel, so if we do, I expect to go lower. At this stage I just 100% hedged my 6410 futures long and I'm waiting for a clear break. 
Yeah but there is also bullish divergence on the hourly. Seems like most time there is bullish/bearish divergence, there is the opposite divergence hidden, or am I just overthinking this?

https://www.tradingview.com/x/j5MrdTNG/
Soros is waving. Wave back. Go long.
9700 was 0.6 Fib level of ABC correction, and also horizontal resistance from March.
The longer we hover around here the more likely a breakdown, imo. Support can only be tested so often.

Either we break 8950 soon or another dip is in order.
8800 has been epic support and resistance for quite some time (relatively speaking).

The only time it showed weakness in either direction was the first time we broke it going up in november.  And it was soon tested as support after that.  Since feb it has always been a battle ground.

It's also the 50% fib from 5.8 -> 11.7.


lol i remember we all used to worship that chart in dec.  So do I buy now for a 4x or 10x.. thats the only question.

[Update from a couple weeks ago by the same guy](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/pmV1uLC7-Bitcoin-Longterm-update/)
100% confirmed and guaranteed. 
The biggest issue in Crypto is that people don't stick to the plan.

If I would have made a survey at 9750 of who would go all-in if Bitcoin dipped to 8700, I'm pretty sure a bunch of people would have said yes.

Now 8700 and no balls.
Sidelined bear downvotes anything not bearish :).
Still holding that long from 9700 eh? :)
The same thing can be said vice versa though. A lot of TA ends up being people finding patterns that fit their preconceived bias one way or the other.
I see a lot of people who make bearish pronouncements based on silly reasons too, and any well reasoned bull argument seems to get downvoted into oblivion so that may be why you're not seeing them. Right now there is almost no reason to think this is going down in any time frame beyond the next few hours. Also no reason to think it's going up in any time frame inside of 60 days. Nobody knows.
Speaking of fallacies, why would we need (all) the same buyers from november/december to break 10k ? 

If they want to buy a coin like TRX, they will help bitcoin (the gateway) rise unless ETH ratio breaks new high.

"as drop down to 9k is 10% profit while hovering around 10k is a tiny lost." This is very true though, and the main reasoning behind the concept of resistance.
> Restating my prediction for a 9.8 top

That would give us a similar scenario as the February run from 6k-11.7k, that'd be brutal haha. 

As much as I hope this is the start of a new bull run, I'm not too sure. Besides psychological resistance at 10k, we could also face resistance from [this triangle](https://i.imgur.com/kyygCJR.jpg). Breaking 10k with conviction would be very bullish.
> We will eventually break 10k

Maybe, not definitely.  Not "will"...might.
Bitfinex has moved 130 million usdt from treasury a few days ago , sure they will prop up the price to 10K , they are probably busy doing it right now.
can you chart it for me? 

nice, it should bring us to 8.5k then

edit:actually where's the neckline?
I hope we do punch up to 9400 so I can set my $9K stop on my $6410 long without fear of being meaninglessly chopped out. 
If you have account with Coinbase - switch to GDAX - Limit orders are free.  You only pay fees if you buy or sell into market.
use a different exchange, one that has fiat USD/BTC pair
Use GDAX.
It's owned / operated by coinbase and uses real $$.
ACH $ transfers into gdax are free and the fees on the exchange are significantly lower than coinbase's. 

Coinbase is good for a quick onboard. I wanted to buy a few weeks ago and didn't have fiat at another exchange so just punched the buy button on Coinbase and got the price at that moment which more than made up for the fee. If I had waited several days for money to tranfer to another exchange, I would have paid $8.3 or whatever instead of the $7.5 I paid at Coinbase. It has its utility.
I've actually had a pretty good experience with square's cash app so far and they sent me a zero fee debit card for free :) great Coinbase alternative. 
The moving avgs are very similar.

The most impressive part is, it seems to be working! (This time.)

Upcoming resistances: ~$8,960 (downwards sloping resistance line from recent high and $9,170 bounce); $9k; $9.2k.
Ya, that's important context for sure. I think it's hard to avoid the tendency to measure price relative to recent exuberant peaks, so people loose track of the underlying trend. I'm still short here for other reasons, but staying resolutely above 8.7 would be quite bullish.
FWIW, the PVT looks more random since the 24th than it was before that. That still seems to be mostly true now: https://www.tradingview.com/x/S0cX2xu0/
[removed]
I would use the red line. It doesn't leave out the top of the wick at 9700. Besides, it looks more wedge-like. If you use the red line, that would be exactly how mine is drawn, like *exactly*. Lol.
always log

What fees without margin? The trading fees are not exactly super low, but for a long position hold they are pretty much irrelevant. Margin is not so nice - but then it is totally irrelevant if you do not do margin.
I mean, technically without margin you are just buying and selling...so shorting would just be converting to dollars and longing would be buying BTC with dollars...

Edit sorry only saw without margin. With margin for longer timeframe a you'll get a few regardless cause you are borrowing money, so I don't get the question.
Could you show a chart? Noob in EW here.
I discarded that line, the one it matched better was a line from 9170 (previous top) to 8940 (latest top). At least on Bitfinex
First of all you are selling wrong. Use gdax limit sells
lower the amount to cover fees. like .4999 or something

or you could try deposit to gdax, then withdraw to external BTC address from there. I don't think I usually pay fees but I may be mistaken

oh nvmd he's trying to sell. well deposit to gdax and do limit order like was suggested above
Check to make sure it isn't already in order.
Try to use a limit sell and check if it works , might be due to fees 
> there is too much f*ckery going on, nothing seems organic

yes, totally agree but everyone here is in denial
CME generally has no impact on the market. People tend to over exaggerate on them.

Best of luck on your short, I’m playing the opposite side of the field. 
I'm heavy Eth actually, hoping to jump out around 0.09-0.1 into BTC before BTC takes off again and drives the ratio into the toilet.
1m charts are bad for your health. 
It's percentages that matter not $.
through 9k resistance? yeah lets not deny this jump is building a pretty strong bull case. this is much different than bottoming out at 8.6k and jumping to 8.8
~~Not much follow through~~. Staying on the sidelines.
Did your other account get banned? 
agreed.  can't wait till we enter a bull market.
Should have at least changed ur name to The __Brad,

Chad, I had to upvote this even though you're a bit abrasive. You're right, and sometimes the truth hurts which is, I guess, why people downvote you.
And you know this is the start of a new bull market how? 
I think that's not the problem. Bulls were expecting a healthy pullback, but a pullback in which they can control the rejection and cool off some indicators. This is not consolidation after 50% growth, this is bearish daily reactivation, sellers are back in and are making pressure with lower lows. We have daily massive hidden bearish divergences, RSI breakout, and an engulfing candle. Maybe bulls are expecting even lower prices to reactivate buying, but so far this is not looking good for them.

It would be more similar if it double topped at 9.8k.
On the first leg up to 11.7 people were commenting on how unnatural the price rise seemed. Comments during the rise to 9.8 sounded very similar. I think we do dip a bit more, double top just under 10 and then retest the low 7's.
Not really though. It slowly grinded towards 11.7k. There were no serious attempts to break it, look at the volume. The run towards 9.8k was a classic moment where the market overreached, got very overextended and the smart money took it's profits. I expected this kind of pullback at 9k, didn't happen... That's why the start of the correction was a lot more swift and violent. 


You should really not be afraid to be a buyer soon. It's what i've been waiting for ever since the first BGD. First time i'll be deploying my full capital again after months. Sure the market could always turn, and get rejected again at 9.8k but that's just guessing. 

Close. We'd need another climb up to 9.8k in the coming days and *then* get rejected to truly mirror it. 
Yep, feels exactly the same. Think BTC under 5k is in play. 
That one had increasing volume whereas this one has decreasing volume. Sellers are not pushing hard, for now.
Bartard? if we dont get Barted, w r good.
That's what I'm observing to. Keeping my short from 9200 open.

Interesting to see that everybody here seems to be opening longs or closing shorts. I guess we'll know who's right within several hours.
I'm not experienced in TA (don't even believe in it much, tbh), but to me it looks like a bear flag. 
I think it's a pennant.
still waiting for the $1300 entry...

Yes, hold through the retrace and then buy *immediately* below the double top. Check.

To another Gox wallet. I really don't get the continuous posting of this without some initial thread scrolling.
the only thing that’s “strange” about this is the fact that all the fucking BTC are sitting on a P2PKH output.

What a bunch of amateurs
Big sell signal, sell before the dump or get left behind. 

If that's what you're thinking, do consider the possibility of OTC also, this should never be an indicator to trade on unless it's for a 30 minute scalp on panic sellers.
I like your "mega short squeeze" label as if it's a major historic occurrence, haha. 
Maybe we can finally stop redrawing that bastard.
Sounds good to me!
could be a fakeout idk
9k+ for 24 hours would be good news for now
Not a very convincing breakout.  We might just redraw it.

Edit: now I'm convinced.
This always seems to happen around 8500-8800. Every time we pass through it. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/ekIQsIl9/
that's what I've been watching tonight. Scaled into a decent short, average about 9265.

quick edit: not that i use them a lot, but the 15m bbands on bmex are getting real tight. We could be looking at a $100-200 pop here in either direction. 
Three days ago anyone who made any semblance of a bearish post got downvoted into oblivion.  Now those people seem to have gone quiet...

edit: short from 8890
Me! I think we might get one more red candle own to 8.5 in the falling wedge, but in my little three wave fractal calc the final dump should be around 8675, which we almost perfectly hit.

We could very well break to the upside of this falling wedge within the next 6-12 hours.

A full candle below 8.4 I'll be becoming very wary. 
Bull checking in. All good here. 8k though and I might start to flip. Cashing out a little to rebuy if lower.

But otherwise ok.

Generally spirits are better now I feel we're past the lowest point (5.8k). If I felt we were still in a true downward slide I'd be completely different about things. A lot of other people are probably feeling the same way which will hold things up for longer.

Edit, downvoted for answering a question? We all take hits, including you underwater short holders. Clicking an up or down arrow will not change the market direction.
currently buying the dip! No TA,  but to me right now the reward is worth more than the risk 
Can't say certainly that the bull run has ended, but yeah, things are looking red short term.

Why should anyone write a complex smart contract when we assume honesty anyway? Person A would send the payment and person B sends the info if both are honest.

I think the way you intend a solution to your challenge to work is impossible to achieve using a smart contract, because its code is public so it cannot contain the information that is sold by person B, otherwise the information would be public before payment.
I wouldn't. 9200 if you really want to, but the target for this break should be +/- 9150.
intriguing move knowing that Kobayashi can dump at any moment. Is it him creating FOMO to unload, or MMs stop hunting?
I meant a target of 9000.

I tend to agree with this interpretation of the channel versus yours: https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ezv0s/daily_discussion_thursday_april_26_2018/dy03iw5/

But if we jump back up and steady climb, it'll be time to redraw the channel anyway.
or it’s a bounce from a very bullish local bottom. good luck I’m not touching this
go ahead. I'm adding since a few days. 
It broke up...
Price movements over 15k have only been a distraction to shake you in before 6k 
I'm fairly sure said that at like $10k on the way down and then got rekt and taken off leader boards. lol
Reading that thread gave me cancer. 
[removed]
lower highs? When we pumped from 6k to 11.8k the first time in Feb, we never even got to 9200 before crashing back down to 8k.

When we got to 11.8k the first time in Feb, we crashed back down to 9.2k.

There is currently not much to be worried about. But it would be good/important for us to hold above 9k for a day at least
agreed, cant see this blasting upwards right now. a bit worrisome that we bounced off 8670, but at the moment im treating this bounce only as a chance to get better short entries.
this makes literally no sense. I don't understand the arbitrary numbers of 'if it doesn't hit this number then bad.' at first everyone here said 'if we break the trendline we are confirmed bulls, now it's 'if we don't hit 11,753.23 by april 29th this is going down.' How do you guys come to these conclusions and give things a deadline? 
It doesn't have to. Consolidating above 9062 (important fib retracement) would be good enough for today. People always have incredible expectations "bearish until 11.7" then what, "bearish until 20k"? Aknowledging a bottom has been found would gain you way more money than thinking the way you do.
I think the dump today was a good thing. We made our first low, and it is above the resistance line.

Lets wait it out

Not usually by that much but also, Tether is printed in response to money going in. It also gets destroyed too. It's in a constant state of flux and while it can be an indicator I wouldn't rely on it too much.
Both you and the guy are wrong. Tether printing means money entering, or money being sidelined . Specifically the later.

Dude, this isn't Facebook, man.
Hey, you pissed everyone off, which made downvotes, which made the price go up because of your rule!  Gonna ping you next time I am holding a long ;)

I'm sure everyone would love to know specifically why it looks that way to you.

Your post was almost entirely sentiment.

You essentially said the same thing with:

> Will drop to $7800-$8000 range before

Tldr: I want my buy order to get filled at $7800 to $8000. Please Bitcoin don't go up.

I disagree. I think the battle for the market happens between bulls and bears in the 8.5 and 11.7 range of log lines from the ATH. Falling below 8.5 means we simply have redrawn the line at 9.7 instead and are continuing the downtrend. Meaning your 7.8-8 range could be cut right through regardless of whatever support you may see.

With that said, the fact we have now consolidated twice at 8.8 and tested the log line of 8.5-8.6 twice, leads me to be bullish on our ability to continue to go up and face the final test at 11.7 in order to truly declare a reversal. 
False there is not word as "must" or "will"

I'm pretty sure this is unsubstantiated and doesn't make any sense, so you got 2/3. Next time try to add some kind of "I told you this was coming!" sentiment to get the full triple crown. Still, I want to say thanks for trying! You showed a strong effort. 
I thought he was putting selling on hold till September

it was probably an OTC sale, i don't see why he wouldnt do it that way.  And I doubt anyone buys 10k coins OTC with the intent of just dumping on the open market.  Would be like burning money.

You can find multiple sources on Google, which the original would likely be in Japanese and I wouldn’t know where to find. Here’s one of the stories reverberating his words: https://www.clien.net/service/board/cm_vcoin/12043612
Wow props to you for being in this space from the beginning

About once every other month, for BTC.  In 2017 there were 6 long poles, all X's, that went unresolved.  About one each month over the course of the first 6 months of 2017.  We would have to go to $789 to resolve the first of them (dating back to Jan 2017).  Unresolved poles almost always happen at the bottom of a major pullback (as opposed to when making new ATH).  The exception being in April 2017 we passed $1,297 without ever retracing back to it and left an unresolved pole there.  That event likely had to do with the excitement of the first ATH in 2 years and sudden influx of media attention.  Sometimes the price leaves the poles far behind before retracing back to them, but I am not supporting the theory we are going back to $789 or $1,297, just parroting the data.
joyrider5 posted it earlier, but I have not read through the whole thing.

"Hallucinations of the next bull run"
I think its a bunch of different moving averages at different timescales. I've seen something similar called Guppy Multiple Moving Averages (GMMA)
Of course, I'm not ruling out the possibility of a lower low but I am just saying that if you expect there to be a long period of consolidation after a low like we saw in 2014 I think you will be disappointed. There is too much money to be made and too many people invested in the space.

Although he is a contentious character for his politics, George Soros has a theory on assets like bitcoin that is genius. "Reflexive" assets he calls them. Basically what is in the beginning irrational exuberance  actually makes the investment in an asset more rational.

So tons of money gets pumped in for no reason, the money attracts developers and visionaries. The visionaries and developers use the capital influx to create stronger fundamentals, more money rolls in and on and on. It is a more nuanced explanation of positive feedback loops.

edit: 
Also the Soros fund is now trading crypto. They definitely identified the potential for reflexivity.
Well in general, "bubbles" have similar graphs. This is not unique to crypto, go look at the nasdaq index. You will see similar price action. The difference is, once a sell off has been completed the price can recover in different directions. I have actually been seeing the most bullish news for crypto coming out during the last month or so. Insofar as that the majority of wealth is concentrated in hands that have not yet invested in crypto. Baby boomers in the US. That's why wall street wants to legitimize crypto, so they can package it up and sell it to retail investors on the street. 
Humans find patterns everywhere doesn’t mean they are related
Just the descending side does it. The way up was much longer and much more gradual.
I'm leaning holding out until it confirms, or at least until the bear flag gets invalidated: https://www.tradingview.com/x/dGkqPqMt/  

Longing 8720 made good sense from a R/R perspective, because tight stops made sense. Too much air above *and* below here for me, especially after my day of bad entries and exits yesterday. 
At this point, the "double bottom" formation is nearly the same width and variance as the "double top" on 8950. In general, I don't trust double bottoms/tops that aren't visible on the 4H chart, which this isn't. If we run up to 9800 and turn again, that's trade-able. 

Sitting on my hands until the picture is clearer.
ETH had a higher high at the same moment, and that is my leading indicator recently (and at the moment it tells me what I want to hear...)
Can confirm I've lost a shitton. Genuinely questioning what I'm even doing with my life at this point. 

Disclaimer: Bitcoin isn't the only reason I'm questioning what I'm doing with my life. But it does highlight issues with myself that have been around for a while. 
a 37% retrace? No. that's not how math or English work 
If we break through 9200 hard I would be a bit wary of a double top, I really want this to consolidate  between 9200-9300 and the bottom of the blue channel. If it does, I think the r/r for a long will be quite nice!
The drop to 9050 after the wick to 9147 was the time to add. Better to be aggressive early in the position and cut the position quickly. At this stage, breaking 9200 and holding above it is a good place as you mentioned. 
Personally I added enough to bring my break even to 8900, which I think is stress free breathing room to hold through potential volatility around 9100.
Whenever I enter, I use 100% of my trading stack, but at varying levels of margin. 

Usually it's at 5x leverage. 

If I were so inclined, I could conceivably up my leverage and use the freed up margin to increase my position size and improve my entry.

However, this would run counter to the core of my risk management strategy. Which is to cut my losses early and let my winners ride. 

Trying to escape a poor entry by adding to your position always seems to me like trying to put out a fire by throwing matches at it. 
I generally avoid trading news/rumors and stick to trading what the market is doing. 

Right now what it appears to be doing is undergoing a much-needed cooldown.
16k coins would mean the reverse BGD we had 3 weeks ago from 6.9k to 7.6k.
It'd be nice to see $9,000 hold as stronger support this time around. 

Depending on how the market behaves in the short term, this could easily be a position I hold until $11,700. 
A false breakout from this range is a real possibility. If $8,640 falls on Bitstamp, the assumption would certainly be that the market is headed lower. But I'd want to wait until at $8,450 or so to decide whether to cut it loose or not. 

$8,250 would actually be a clearer "abandon ship" point for me. But I don't plan to hold out through that much of a decline.

> If you're looking for trends, the direction is definitely up.

I'm a bit of a permabull but really, zoom out.
A bit more than 7% actually. More like 8%. It confirms when we reach the same price as the most recent local high. That is why there is plenty of room for failure in this pattern and we should not start celebrating too early. 



**Edit**: Actually, one could say that the most recent local high was in fact 9150, in which case we would have finished the pattern by now. So we'll see.

Not moving and staying below $9180 
Depends on the time frame. Daily? Sure, lower high. 15 min,  who knows, could be a higher low. Hell some time frames (like weekly) could be a either a lower high or nothing on the way to a different lower high or even a higher high.

Once you understand what divergence is, though, it's much easier to pick out on charts.
I don't agree. An analogy should be something people can easily relate to. This one is a non-existent version of a game.
Your comment reminded me of going long at 6800 before the big green candle.

On hourly chart I see an inverted h&s, along with incrementally smaller red candles scalping the tops, and we have been making higher lows all day. Makes me transiently bullish, as in expecting new move to test 9.2k. Edit: new to TA, learning a lot here: thank you
cryptowatch?  Come on chewy...
I was procrastinating and then I got busy at work. 
I was too tempted to wait for 9.2 support so I just added a bit to my long. Was pleasantly surprised to see my average entry price is now 8888.88. Feelin' lucky.
I wasn't very clear, what I meant is I think it would be quite bullish to bounce between 9250 and the bottom of the blue channel (that is slowly being tested as support [right now](https://www.tradingview.com/x/VSk9EpEr/))

I guess that would be asking too much but seeing something like this would be great : https://www.tradingview.com/x/oASSVxoc/
Yeah it's not a true h&s pattern. I got the term "complex h&s" from CryptoSniper where the shoulders can be triangles or have multiple peaks. I think market psychology-wise and who is winning (buyers vs sellers) these can work as bearish patterns.
8900 is previous resistance turned support and now resistance, it's a high volume level. It's not really the psychological significance that I care about, I simply round the range to the closest round number, because there is some minor psychology to that. The pattern and price action are clear to me. The line on my chart is actually $8914.4.
What reasons do you have to believe there will be negative price action for the next 1.5 years other than the weak assumption that history will repeat itself?
Good thing everything is fundamentally exactly the same too.  
[deleted]
This year will be much worse than 2014 in terms of the bottom, i think bulls will have a bad summer.
I've got some profit taking on my long around there, and not set anywhere else higher yet.

If we manage to get near 9200, I'll immediately set a BE SL in fear of another high speed sell off.
If it's a big friendly dildo then it's absolutely no problem!

I'd much prefer a slow and steady climb but these past few weeks have lead me to never doubt the possibility of dildos coming along and fucking as many people as possible.

Yep, and in a perverse way, a lot of people will end up filthy rich because Gox locked their BTC away from their weak hands.

It definitely wouldn't invalidate it, after all, the Eve part is supposed to be slow with tons of pullbacks (and this runup so far has been more V shaped/parabolic than anything)- it's just that there's no reason to count on it or even really think of it unless you're long from like $6500. 

Anyone hoping that'll work out is doing just that- hoping. A breakout from $12k would be exceedingly bullish though and would confirm it on a close above like $13k.
Which is kinda tautological.

I personally only look at targets in h&s and ih&s formations, and only after they've been formed
I can't get in on either of my mobile browsers, probably for the best i guess, but, motherfucker.
Funds are safe 
The lines are from the wedge forming from 6.7K and up the arrows are what I think is possible steps for a bulltrap
Yeah I'm very close to longing this just for squeezing some money out of the disbelief rally. 

Difficult decision to make here though, would've been much better to long $8800 
It's confusing, mainly.

Perpetual swaps are a derivative product on bitmex that allow people to trade bitcoin using contracts. They follow spot price (the price on exchanges that actually allow people to buy and sell the underlying product) rather than determine market price. You can still arbitrage bitmex, but price discovery on bitmex itself is discouraged through funding fees. 

Funding fees are meant to tether the price to spot exchanges- if bitmex starts pushing too hard, the cost for holding a long open indefinitely increases. Opposite for dumping/shorting. 

Futures are different in that they are settled on an expiry date. 

There is no funding rate that tethers the price to spot- they are extremely speculative and are meant to allow traders to hold long term positions and speculate on the future price of a product over a longer period of time. 

Futures on bitmex regularly used to trade 5-10% above spot price when the market was incredibly bullish. (this is called contango)

When the market is bearish, it trades under spot (backwardation).

Usually when bitmex is bullish, swaps trade a bit above spot. If swaps are bullish, generally futures are as well.

Seeing swaps far above futures is confusing because it means people trading swaps are very bullish and eager to buy but futures traders are hesitant and a bit more neutral/bearish. 

Swaps generally have significantly higher liquidity (you can long/short large positions without moving the price much) so that's one benefit- but that's also what makes this so confusing- usually when spot/swaps start to explode and go bullish, futures go even *more* bullish due to lower liquidity. 
Spot price is market price. For example, a few seconds ago "swaps" on Bitmex were at 9300 when spot price on Bitfinex was 9255. 
Hehe..   well that whale has left me feeling a tad lacking.
No , it's spoofy bot.
Thank you for the reply. I considered the fact that the bullish divergence might have already played out after I posted it here, and I have to agree that you are probably correct.



Also yeah, the further down we go on the rising wedge, the better I think. If we are lucky we bounce up from the bottom of it, but if not... I don't know... fuck I guess?
Hidden and regular divergence are different things. Hidden generally implies a trend continuation for whatever trend is present on the time frame you're looking at. Regular a reversal.

Hidden bear: price lower high, indicator higher high.  
Bear: price higher high, indicator lower high

Cheat sheet:  
For bear divergences you're looking at local highs. For bull divergences local lows. For a bear div, if the local high is lower (trend is down) you'll be looking for the indicator to be higher now. Otherwise, if the local high is higher (trend is up) you'll be looking for the indicator to be lower. For a bull div, if the same concept. For a hidden div, price higher low (trend is up) = indicator  lower low. For a normal bull div, the trend is downward; you'll be looking for a lower low that results in a higher low for the indicator. 

For additional information, most indicators used with divergence indicate some form of "momentum." When it's high, it means there's a lot of momentum in the buying direction and when it's low it means there's been a lot of selling momentum lately.

For a couple examples, if the price is making a lower high but the indicator a higher high, it means that even with more recent momentum than you had at the previous high the market *still* wasn't even able to beat that previous high, which is a bad sign (hidden bear). 

If the price is making a lower low, but the indicator a higher low, it means that the new low was made with less selling momentum than the previous low, which implies the momentum is shifting towards the buy side (normal bull divergence). The reason people are somewhat cautious trading off those immediately is that the momentum is *shifting* bullish, but there could be many (or not) lower lows before the momentum actually crosses to the buy side and the trend reverses.

Imagine a tug of war game where instead of both teams constantly pulling, they each get periods of time to pull as hard as they can while the other team does nothing. A hidden divergence is when one team pulls the rope even harder on their new turn than their previous turn, but they still end up losing ground. In that case, the other team has a better shot at pulling further than their previous turn even if they can't quite pull as hard as they could before. That particular situation would bring about a normal divergence, where one team can't pull the rope as hard as they could the previous turn, but they still end up gaining ground. In that case, it implies the balance of power in the tug of war is shifting towards the other team, it just hasn't provided results yet.
So I suppose you're Debbie?
hmm yeah. I think we will find out the direction for today at least in the next hour, but this double bottom makes it so tempting to flip my position rn


Bitfinex facilitate OTC, the $130M required could have been deposited by someone who wanted to use their desk. 
he obviously will go and buy ETH so that he can dump those on gdax for fiat..
If I was a whale, I would have secured a mega short position and subsequently dumped the usdt on the usd/usdt pair on kraken. This technically should create an instant devaluation of the crypto market as a whole, from there just take profit, rinse and repeat 
He asked for prayers, not hope, different strategy
if i open a short to hedge my long, what should my stop loss be for that short?
(or buy lower if there is an opportunity)
or lose way more than that over trading
I mean....imagine if you did this at $19.2k.

With the order books being so thin, 8k can fuck us up or moon us up 
Thank you. I can't say I've never been guilty of shit posting but I keep that for r/cc. Thank you for the great work!
Price usually shits the bed between 2100 hrs - 0700 hrs UTC.
Honestly, veltrop is completely right about the best positions feeling like shit when you open them.    When you open into exuberance, that's a bad sign.
Before I went short today, I opened a long, what I noticed was the lack of momentum or pressure to push the price up. I closed it quickly with 0.xx% loss. If I felt the exhaustion, I think others might feel it too (or are alreay feeling it by now), by others, I mean all those who bought the coin today above $8,850.

I try my best to trade in the direction of the market. Someone asked me a couple days ago when I was long and the price was above $9,200, I think it was sloppy. He said what if we visit $9,000 $8,800, $8,700 and so on and what would I do to my long. My response was "I don't think it will get there". I was wrong. 

Going long here can be glorious, but only if we know that the market is to go up. I am personally confused and feel more inclined towards a drop as said above. 


For quite a while, nearly every bear flag broke up, and most bull flags broke down, resulting in the bart patterns.
shh. i'm not supposed to be awake right now. ;) But it looks like this just fell out of the 1H cloud i was watching all night, we could keep going. I don't think we're dumping far though, we're just consolidating for our next (larger, long term) leg up.
I suspect that the same whale(s) are backing both coins.    Litecoin is a Lightning-compatible coin that is friendly with Blockstream, therefore BTC investors tend to view it favorably.    In contrast, there are ETH whales who do not view LTC or BTC as favorably but often have a positive view of BCH and DASH.
What could be the reason for eth leading in general? 
I remember from the 8975 break up, LTC did lead the way.  Certainly something to keep tabs on.
Fully agreed. 

I'd kill the orderbook widget too, but it can be essential sometimes for juggling order placement when scalping.

Which site do you use for the bfx orderbook?  I switched to cryptowatch a while back but it gets really laggy and seems incorrect at times.
well, I have another trendline not from 9.7k so waiting to see if this break upward


Edit: forgot to add chart https://www.tradingview.com/x/DdwSqSST/

Good tip.  Something I will consider for my next target trade.  Appreciate it.  Makes a lot of sense!
How can I figure out when I would be liquidated if I open a 5x long at 8800?
That is how it is supposed to work. Better yet wait until someone who uses Kraken answers your question.
You realize a loss for the books in the previous year but there's no real loss since you were just hedging. it's a way to realize a loss without truly selling 
It works by changing your tax bracket.  As a small player, I'm trying to pay the zero percent long term capital gains rate.
Tru
What would be confirmation 
Then it might be too late.

Ballsy move but good r/r.
Starting to look like a deceased feline displacement.
It does look that way, we broke out of a rising wedge to form a descending triangle.. I expect us to drop through 8700 sooner rather than later.
isn't that too low of a timeframe to talk about A&E? I thought there are supposed to be weeks between the two bottoms.
Time frame too low for an A&E but more importantly an A&E is only confirmed when it breaks it's middle high.


nice find on the descending triangle. I don't really understand your channel, what is it based on?

The way I drew it (and /u/midnightocean as well), we're already out of the channel  

https://www.tradingview.com/x/V0csPDvb/
That's a fair point, I've actually asked myself this question before. If you find opposite divergence within the same timeframe, which one wins? 

I think as a hidden divergence implies a continuation of the trend, then you can spot it more easily on smaller time frames. As the regular divergence implies a reversal, you would need to see it on longer time frame to confirm (your bullish divergence is pretty clear on the 1hr but weak on the 2h).

I'm not sure at all if my assumption is correct, it would be nice if someone with more experience (like /u/mandy7 or /u/_chewtoy_ could give their take on this).
Yes, I'm referring to the downtrend line drawn from 9700 down to 8840 that we just broke out of in sideways price action.
> The longer we hover around here the more likely a breakdown

my opinion too. I've seen the early hours of this thread and how people were selling then, I guess you've seen that too.
Not necessarily. Confidence takes time to be reclaimed, the longer we don't dip further and consolidate here, the more confident the market becomes. Sell volume is declining and the bottom is rounding, looks ok to me.
It held us for *4 days* last week.
You stopped? It's still right on track...
Are you from the future? 
truth is im rusty.. i forgot there's always bluff FUD before a big move up.  One of the most reliable indicators.

dammit me included.. so what do i do? buy now? 
I had the discipline not to FOMO but now i cant pull the trigger

I went in deep from 9.15 to 8.75, and then castrated myself at break even.

In my defense, 8.9k was a terrible place to have the CA though with yesterdays fuckiness, and we are still below it.

Back long again, with a *tiny* long.
I don't mean the exact same buyers, but think demographics, the buying demographics haven't changed and those demographics now have anti-bitcoin people who are very upset with it talking allot of shit
The probability is extremely low that we will not break through $10K again. Float (supply) shrinks every day, and demand is not going to diminish. $10k will fall again almost as surely as the sun will rise in the east, probably sooner than you think.
bounce off the resistance line would be good right now.

Otherwise, it was just another fakeout
neckline is 8770, being tested for resistance right now
Best one?  Thank you. 
Yea that too. It’s kinda trippin me out tbh lol. Literally only difference would be that if instead the daily dropped to 6.5 instead of 7.3. 
I didn't (and I never short, in general)...but I'm not understanding you. What am I guilty of? I wasn't buying (or holding) BTC at the time and so wasn't exposed to what I see as a high-risk, low-reward situation of buying in at the tip of the flag.
I closed my short from 8250 at 8820 thinking “Holy shit what a candle”

now noone is buying. lol
It's three parenthesis, and you're an (((**asshole**))) for using that dog whistle anti-semitic garbage.

Grow up.
That is seriously not excellent. I'm giving you a 30 day ban for that one.
did it just break down???
and 4h is the best one to pay attention to if you are not micromanaging your positions imo
From the top : it goes down , then up a bit, then down, then up a bit , then down . So let's hope it isn't just coincidence. 
CME likely has a large impact on the market.
its expiry today and there's alot of volume



I keep seeing people saying it has no effect, but since month 2 it's been down down down, so I gotta go against the herd on that one. good luck to you too in your trade
A 2-3 % jump. 
Hey, it's follow through. You rang?
No Crypto\_Chad69 is still alive and well, seems like I logged to the wrong account this time though. Welp.

In 2030 people will be linking to the legendary comment by "The\_\_Chad" instead of by "Crypto\_Chad69", that kind of sucks to be honest.
Yep like I stated "bearish signals"
But the price rise isnt even remotely comparable? Look how volatile and steep it was back when we approached 11.7k. Its nowhere close to that right now, we might have had some long ass green candles but other than that the growth seemed pretty "organic" if thats a word we can even use for BTC. The dump right now looks much more unnatural than the pump of the last weeks, in my opinion of course.
Heh yeah I was about to jokingly say that recent 9.8 isn't the DCB of 11.7, because 11.7 gave itself it's own DCB already.
Fresh positions here seem like a bad idea, regardless of long or short. If you're holding short from >9K, might as well hold it. Long from 87xx also makes sense to hold, although the margin for error on that one is smaller (where I am currently). 
There's a good chance you will be right, I'm just playing conservative given my overall feeling of uncertainty
Still waiting to profit off my $18.5k purchases. 
wha??
[deleted]
so in your mind a trustee, for shits n grins, goes through security procedures to enter a SCIF room to do some housecleaning with 160,000,000$ worth of bitcoin?  Maybe playing wallet pong? 
the same wallet he used to sell with earlier this year...?
care to explain?
IF they ever would make an OTC trade, is there a way to asses the impact of such a trade on the regular market?
And isn't it logical the buyer(s) are prohibited (for a certain amount of time) from selling it on the regular market?
Me too, even more because shorts are even lower than 3 days ago and still  lowering.

Edit: wrong comment. Apologize, did non notice the chart.
Haha! Maybe..
Agree. Feel like a fakeout. All those who bought the dip relentlesslyduring the runup to 9.7k are all gone now. 
Sadly yes. It's a breakout of 1% from a clear wedge. I'm betting we're back down again shortly.
Even a redrawn version is about to break now... There goes my paper profits due to greed again...
Good luck with your trade.
They are currently to busy griefing their liquidated long entries @9.5k. Seriously, people who act like this is a fight should stop trading.

If you want to make money you should play the sentiment, and not stick with one forever
very interesting. My reasoning is similar

The market is bullish overall?! How on earth have you come to that conclusion. Jesus 
until we make a higher high on the weekly, break previous high (of 11.7k?) we are still bearish overall
> the market is bullish overall

What are the technical signs that make you say that?
[removed]
Because the next Cross is CRITICAL!
Because more people will believe it's going to work. More people will believe it's working if the price starts going up... That's my hypothesis.
Death cross is over rated.  During the fall from 1200, it basically signaled the end of the dip just like it did with the fall from 20k.  Golden crosses are more promising.
Because more people here are long and holders than short.
I suppose it depends on the moving average timeframe.  I'm specifically referencing the 3d bitfinex chart at bitcoinwisdom
Wait, really? Or is that sarcasm? Not saying I either agree or disagree but sarcasm is hard to convey over text, you know?
I don't think were passing 10k today.  
The next "y" <time unit>s will be critical.
Often true.

Also, that it would be a strong reversal candle is simply a fact.

Happy belated reddit brithday!
No SL mate, just manually keeping an eye on the trades. 
yes, then give me the OP_Codes
Currently walking, but here’s a sketch:

Person A pays to smart contract

Person B performs computation

Person B tells Person A to post the data for specific days to the smart contract

Person A does so

Person B now selects the subset of days required for the desired list of times

The contract computes the verification and transfers payment

the result is now public
Target met, nicely done

Gotcha. I’ll keep my long open then (from 8780)

'Big up the East Coast massive, Booyakahshan'.
Haha that's possible too 
I'm talking shorter term, since the short term top at 9,7.

Sure, we can still turn around and head back up, and this may be it, but i'm expecting another lower low first with an actually decent bounce. This reversal is looking weak to me. Just my 2c.
9170 was the latest high. To make a higher high it needs to go above. Then a higher low puts us on the right track. 
I'm am by no means Bear or Bull, i just want to understand where it is  going to jump on the train. 

We'll set lower highs all the way to $20k and then be overextended, requiring a significant correction.

**/s**
you're talking about a completely different time frame than he is 
Just comparing to the other BGD, although this one is picking up the slack now. 
“Whale” watching is actually a Wyckoff idea. Look into the “Composite Man”. Trading with the market makers is a good way to make returns. 
Oooh I never got why you were so bullish. You don't know that people can make money off the price going down. 
Smart money bought in the low 6ks. They have to take profit at some point. They don’t want to push the price down, atleast not too fast. But their bags are simply too large for the market so taking profit has that effect, hence the 50% retrace here. Once they have taken enough profit they will dump just enough to get back to their buy levels, accumulate a bit, then start pushing up again. It’s how the market works. To think they will never take profit and price goes up to infinity is simply ignorant.
Same. Super annoying.
It's been a dead thread for the last 2 hours because nothing is happening, and this thread is basically treated as a chat room.  I'm not sure what you expect.  When there is action it is usually quality comments.
only destroyed once, and it was a fraction in comparison to what is printed
Shouldn't that imply, that during bull runs, it is destroyed? Which only happened one time (small amount) so far.
I thought tether get their $ from buying btc? How else do tether enter the circulating supply and replacement for 1$ to 1usdt?
they consolidated the coins into 1 wallet.. no move to exchanges. lets not spread FUD. of course idiots will plaster this alll over /r/cc and cause mass panic and drive the price down. good job.
1000 likes and we can go to the moon. 
Just trying to get a feel of what other traders are feeling. :)
What a great way to get an idea of market sentiment /s
Hahaha. I have had a similar past experience. Ask u/csasker if he remembers when I turned bearish.

As for the price. Lets see how it holds up!
It's obvious  
He's short 
Very high volume sell off after a 3.5 week rally. Daily RSI went over 70 (highest since the ATH, actually bullish sign but suggests a pull back). Rejected from an important higher time frame level (right shoulder of the inverse h&s failure). Broke the 8900 level (support from previous breakout) and now consolidating below it without having had much of a bounce. The lack of bounce is very concerning to me.

Finally, geometrically we may have made a complex h&s type pattern, which has a measured move target of around ~8050.

https://imgur.com/a/UpOqBi9
Me too!
maybe you are right...

but also between 8.7 and 8.9 are only 0.7k coins
nothin else is happening though.. this action is like watching paint dry.  Boredom leads to conspiracy theories.

Heheheh, thanks :)

I've done 3 years' worth of winning and losing, and now I think I'm an OK trader.
Thank you for the thoughtful reply. I like this way of thinking about price movement.  Assuming we did in fact bottom out last week, and poless at the bottom of pullbacks go unresolved, it may be prudent to plan for $8500 but not $7473.
1170
awesome, thanks! I expected like a whole book of literature, but this will do for now
Eh, here's his quote on bubbles:

> I have developed a theory about boom-bust processes, or bubbles, along these lines. Every bubble has two components: an underlying trend that prevails in reality and a misconception relating to that trend. A boom-bust process is set in motion when a trend and a misconception positively reinforce each other. The process is liable to be tested by negative feedback along the way. If the trend is strong enough to survive the test, both the trend and the misconception will be further reinforced. Eventually, market expectations become so far removed from reality that people are forced to recognize that a misconception is involved.

>A twilight period ensues during which doubts grow, and more people loose faith, but the prevailing trend is sustained by inertia. As Chuck Prince, former head of Citigroup said: we must continue dancing until the music stops. Eventually a point is reached when the trend is reversed; it then becomes self reinforcing in the opposite direction.

The second half is the most important part to me. I see is going through this right now. 

Notice how the price is going up despite faith in the asset weakening? l14dy, the ultimate moonkid, starting to lose faith in the market, joyrider said months ago that the market looks weird lately, tons of old bulls doubting the asset. The barts, the way we all laugh at the manipulation but deal with it as long as it makes us money. Notice the churn of the traders  and investors here? So many new usernames but people from when weeks or months ago already gone. 

I can see it happening, can you?

Lots of people are beginning to doubt their faiths in the asset and are starting to see the holes and cracks that show weakness. 

I can't see baby boomers exposing themselves in a big way to crypto yet. The alt cleanse isn't done. Once that happens I'll have a lot more faith in the space. Right now crypto is just a big pump and dump
You have a point but there's also the fact that BTC is highly prone to price discovery and restesting an area around $1K isn't that absurd to consider, even in light of bullish news, which to be honest, I don't see all that much of lately. Real bullish news would relate to the tech, imo. Particularly LN news. If LN starts getting implemented by big players then that's a precipitous event that could trigger a true return to bull form. This stuff can't be traded to the moon without upgrades and infrastructure in place. 
They are definitely, 100% related. it's a bubble pop. Like the other guy said, you can see this in virtually any other market that underwent a bubble pop.

The problem is finding the bottom, really. 
Yep, I'm sitting at 50/50 cash/crpto right now until a clear break occurs. 
Been keeping an eye on LTC as well. It's currently in the tightest equilibrium pattern and should break first.
Hey man, I didn't mean it like that.

Trading is basically impossible to learn without losing money. And even once you've learned it, there's still a high chance you are losing money. If you are questioning what you are doing with your life, then the best is to learn something new.

I learned pyMC this week. It's great. I'm playing around with some cool Monte Carlo simulations.

Last week I learned d3. I always used it, but never got into the new v4 library.

The week before that I taught myself to river surf and skateboard (ollie is all I got for now).

These are all things that are free-ish, and should keep you motivated. There's more to life than Crypto. I know I seem like I'm here all the time, but it's just because I usually have my phone with me. If you need any support, feel free to reach out.

You could learn to code (if you can't already), you could learn to use bitcoin simnet/regtest, you could learn a new programming language, a new skill. The world if your oyster. Just reach out man. I'm always here if you need a homeboy to lift you up!

if you're ever in Zurich, let me know. I'll show you a good time.

EDIT: Obligatory thanks for the gold

Yes it is. Retrace means to go back the path taken. And if you need help with math:

9.8-6.45 = 3.35 (length of the run up)
9.8-8.6 = 1.2 (length of the run down)
1.2/3.35*100=~36% (% of the run down compared to the run up)
Luckily those nice adds we have in the 8700 range keep our DCA average down and if we break 9200 they are in a pretty safe zone, for now 
I’m taking things a bit slower and more cautious than I have been, adding at 9050 would have been ideal but my aggressiveness and new to trading addiction has led me to a fat loss 
On of your greatest strengths as a trader seems to be your zen-like ability to divorce positions, and to not let your previous round of sentiment&desires poison your next move.  (At least that is this amatuer's view)
You know that old extinguishers were actually small bombs designed to explode in such a way that they took air from around the burning area making it to stop burning because of that?

Yeah imo clear sign bulls haven't been broken yet. After reading the old dailies that person posted earlier, I realized we have a long way to go in terms of sentiment. It's possible we just bust thru it all and go upwards but we're not climbing a wall of worry yet, there's still so many weak handed/new money cock sure bulls here who haven't given up 

although I wouldn't mind going long again, it was quite nice making money off btc going up
I'm not an expert at otc or how exchanges handle that /u/L14dy is pretty knowledgeable on it.
This has been what I've been reading too.
I saw one on 1 minute chart. And it's not a joke.
I believe ive seen them on alts from what I can remember from looking into it around December 

Never bitcoin though 
I mostly see it realize on smaller time frames (crypto being < 1 hour, traditional markets being < 1 week), larger time frames has been very rare in my experience. 
Ah... thanks for the catch... for the record I wouldn't call $9200 support yet... it'll take a few hours... which is why I'm out of position
Resistance* on the run up. 
Hmm, I didn't see it at first, but I checked and see what you're talking about. Doesn't look like too strong a support, though. I wouldn't depend on it holding.
Fair enough, but it helped clarify it for me. What would you use? 
> An analogy should be something people can easily relate to.

I don't see anything in the definition of analogy that necessitates this
Look, I get that it's not an actual real world scenario anyone is ever going to encounter, but it's still an analogy. Analogies are just using some other, more easily understood situation (or whatever) to capture the essence of something more abstract. It helps if that more easily understood situation is a real world/every day occurance, but it's not actually necessary. It can still be a hypothetical.

Given that, I don't believe my fictional variance on a tug of war game adds much complexity to the comparison and it paints a very accurate picture of what divergence is. I've noticed a lot of newer traders here recently asking questions about divergence and just thought it might help someone.
It's exactly the same shit as the china fud to justify the whales shorts.

Shorting here, after a 1000$ drop and bull divs on the 1H RSI is the worst thing to do in terms of risk management, even if it ends up being right this time for whatever reason it's a horrible practice.


Apologies. Also I'm not fudding at all. Simply wanted to know people's opinions. If merely stating something causes fear, then that's some really fragile mentality. 
Christ, guys... I'm on my third trade in last two weeks...
He's long from 8780, i think.

So, similar position you were looking for.
$8,647 on Stamp. 
Not usually a fan of H&S formations, but this is an interesting one. Closest I've seen in a while. A break up here would confirm it if we hit 9150. 
I've been using bitcoinwisdom forever. Sometimes it's hard to move away from a tool you're comfortable with even if you know there are better options.
Cool number.  But if I may tempt you, if you add 10% to your position at 9100, your ca will only go up to 8900 which is still very comfortable here ;)
Thanks for clarifying, apologies for throwing your name in rotation 
The market is completely overbought in relation to what's production ready today. 
What reasons do you have to believe it will go up other than the weak assumption that history will repeat itself? 

Not trying to be snooty, but the assumption that it will continue to go up because it always has is just as bad if not worse since it's so nebulous and doesn't account for time frames and market movements
Pretty much is except the network in 2017 showed how poorly it has scaled. 
There was no Black swan event, the bubble was the same as 2017
what would be worse than 650k stolen coins from mt gox dumped on the market in 2014?
I'm planning to do the same on my 8760 long (per chewy this morning), and I'll probably actually set that SL on my 6410 long over 9K this time....

yeah...the one I was going to set at 9500...
Look at you blatantly showing preference based on color while calling me out. How hypocritical. 
Who said I was a man?
Lol this is insulting to dush. His prose is clearly very different and more sarcastic. 

This dead, gloomy "bitcoin is fake and will always go down" is too straight-faced for dushman.
Good ol permabear dushmankush haha haven’t seen him here in a while.
Don't worry I've seen this guy before, liquidation should be near for him b
we all know where those 20% bitcoins are gonna end up.. market sells.  And party time with the proceeds.


They were probably do salty that they closed last one in a loss and didn't follow the next one ;-)
i have the same long at 8780 with .5 btc :) hope this breaks 9200
In general, you'll catch some flak/downvotes for posting top level that you opened a winning position long after you opened it. It lessens credibility. Unfortunate somewhat, but true. At least you posted it 5 minutes before the 3% green candle haha
Mexicans
Maybe. 
I'll buy more cheap if somebody wants to give me a discount. Setting limit at $8750 but not confident they'll get it there.
Seems like it. Makes sense it’s more or less the alt exchange 
I'm fairly confident the battle in 2018-2019 will be in 4 to 5 territory. If we hit 6, maybe we can start the "btc will never be 4 digits again" meme. BTC has crashed 80% more than once. 40K could still see a return to <10K. 
More excellence, please. This is the second comment of yours I've removed today.
Consensus (dev conference), Edcon, Plasma, Sharding, Casper FFG and plenty of dApps going live.
What is Gox coin and what is this Gox dump ?
Hey Mike, are you still holding on to your short or are you expected this move up to continue?
lol, I meant more like yesterday the risk/reward was far better. If you missed the entry yesterday, seems better to sit on your hands.

I guess I just always learned that it is imprudent to trade after a move, always before.
And m is short for thousands. Not confusing at all.
A legacy use, internally only. Common public documents use the modern M and B for million, billion, and k for thousand in line with scientific use.
Can you not?  I’m sure it would be not worth it, but should be possible right?
Well, it might not be as unlikely as you think.

If you consider this another DCB and likely continuation of the bear trend (as i do), pretty much anything between 1,3 and 5k is quite possible.
a mt gox sell-off caused the price to go from 1000 to 100
was it absurd then?


wouldn't it be funny if he got hacked though. goxxed the gox
neither
I’m long from 8800 there too and will close only at breakeven I think the risk is worth it. 
I honestly cannot understand why you are surprised. This has been full on bull mode for almost a full month now. Every dip is bought up quickly. Every bounce has follow through. We've broke the down trend line from the ATH. Several of my non trading friends were waiting for confirmation the bull is back to buy in, we got that and yesterday's big dip was exactly what they been waiting for to get back in.
So you can buy cheap on Bitfinex and sell for profit on Bitmex. Alright, I understand I think. Thanks.
Thanks alot.
What's your SL?
36 hr bull run then a weekend dip would suit me fine.
I would watch and not set stops to prevent stop hunting. To be sure i would say 9k2 but from 8k9 its still a considerable loss. If it breaks up i would risk @8960, that's the most recent high and should try 9k2 where you can close the long or reopen another short to make sure it goes up. If it comes back down i'd close the long and ride the short to try and recoup the losses.
Why not just set stops and let it ride? 

No real signs of a reversal yet.
Have fun buying back higher.
It's called inflation. Look it up.
too lazy but I promise :) 

Kobayashi said it, I think. he just said not to look too much into the coins moving aroundm and that it's not a sign of an imminent dump 
No idea, really. All I know is Kobayashi (I think) said not to look too into it
16k coins isn't even a lot...so yes 
Don't think these 8k coins can moon us since they can only be sold? (Don't think they will be sold anyway since all MTgoxxings are postponed)
I did a "break even" close enough times in the last 36 hours to lose 5% of my trading stack.  

I totally agree with you about trying to trade in the direction of the market as much as possible.  It's situations like this that chop us up.
Thanks for the tip, never watched that chart before maybe I'll give it a look.  (geez, yet another tab)
Less liquidity in LTC and way more minnows so the big money moves become apparent more quickly. It is a good indicator, actually, and one of very few existing alts with a future IMO.

This is what I'm using at the moment.
Leverage determines liquidation, obviously. To find liquidation (roughly), just take absolute value of:  

Long: ((1/(leverage multiplier)) - 1) * entry  
ex: ((1/5) - 1) * 9000 = -7200 = 7200  

Short: ((1/(leverage multiplier)) + 1) * entry  
ex: ((1/5) + 1) * 9000 = 10800
In round numbers, 5X gives you a margin of 20% (actually will be a bit lower) . 
So going long you want to find out what value is bellow 8800 by 20% so you just do 8800 / 1.2 = 7333. In this case, for safety, i would consider my liquidation between 7400 and 7500. 
If you were shorting just do 8800 * 1.2 and that would get you 10560. Again for safety, would consider bellow 10000. 

I thought so too and was wondering where my profits were. Someone else posted and I believe them that the amount you enter is the total position and you divide by leverage. So, if you select .05 and 5x leverage you are leveraging *.01* at .05x for a TOTAL of .05 exposure. To leverage all .05 at 5x, you'd enter .25 and 5x.
I see, in the US your losses are capped at 3k a year so that is also a factor.
11,700, which is where we saw the top of the 'Adam' section, and has also served as pretty tough resistance for a while. Remember the double top at the end of February? It hit 11,700 twice before falling down.
I prefer lowering my risk, you don’t need to short the absolute top or long the absolute bottom to make a good trade.
You must be good with the ladies with those choice of words ( or men ?) 
If we're going to be literal, the only candidate for an A&E double bottom is on the weekly. Also noteworthy, in that case, the further apart the two bottoms are the more likely it is that the pattern will confirm.

I was pretty explicit about the scale I was looking at and where confirmation ~~was~~ is.
The 3-day trendline prior to the BGC. Breaking that trend was summarily rejected (hello $1100 4h candle): https://www.tradingview.com/x/Da60o874/
It's important to remember not to chase divergences. Your bear div is in the process of playing out, but who knows how far the market will go with it (it could have already bottomed). Those bull divs have definitely played out, but now I'd start to look for a hidden bull div to confirm.
My understanding is that when trending upwards, bearish divergence would not be confirmed until there is a reversal.

So if you see hidden bullish divergence and potential bearish divergence at the same time, the hidden bullish wins until the potential bearish is confirmed. Trend is your friend and whatnot.

What constitutes a reversal is where I'm still a little fuzzy. Is it a confirmed lower high after an upward trend (or higher low after a downward trend)? That seems to make most sense to me.
Sure, that's one way of looking at it. Could be said that that's what happened around the 6,5k level. 

Personally i see this as the less likely outcome, but who am i to say.
Yep, coming from a runup, basically forming a big old bull flag

This time we're coming from a breakdown, doing the same would form a big old bear flag.
im very sadly on the sidelines.  I wanted to buy the dip but i got FUDDED.  I'm rusty trading, i forgot fake FUD is the best indicator of a bull run.   Someone wanted in cheap.

You only have to answer this question:

Are we in a bull or bear market, then trade accordingly. As longer term is better for your sanity and wallet.
"the buying demographics haven't changed and those demographics now have anti-bitcoin people"
hard to tell, have you seen this tweet for example ? https://twitter.com/fundstrat/status/988817606604881920

Besides, i'm pretty sure it's climbing with a lower volume, which means less buyers. Price is mostly perception based in such a market.
BTC will see 30K this year.
If you have a Coinbase account you can use Gdax and transfer in/out instantly from Coinbase and use 0 fee limit orders.  
depends where you are located

If I didn't know better, I'd think you were being sarcastic with a description like that.
5X short on Bitcoin right now??  This will not end well.
I should learn my lesson never to post in the midst of a BGD.
Chad, you can't even log into your account and you're calling people stupid. 😘
your edit cracks me up lmao 
Wanted to reply to the comment below, my bad
We could be (roughly) here: https://www.tradingview.com/x/nkFDnnbz/  

Not a fractal person, really, though. 
Unattributed quotes of simple phases means you disagree with the definition. So nostrilBob thinks bitcoin will go below 6.5. I find this laughible and poking fun at it
I believe that you are unduly biased towards a particular coin that heretofore was relatively unknown.  I accuse you of promoting said coin.  I even accuse you of contriving a use case in an attempt to illustrate the advantages of this coin.



Was it? Hmmm.
there’s a “1” at the front of that address. Both recipient and sender.

Which means the guy is not using segwit and not using a multisig, but a P2PKH
he's talking about the short squeeze that already happened
I had a long that was stopped out this morning.  It's been awhile since I fell victim to the overly-conservative stop loss.  I'm back in that zone by pinching pennies from having a series of poor trades.  Looks like I am negatively reinforcing that loop.
cheers
I want to be there to buy the sauces if possible.
And now?
Look around you?
its been a great 2018.. havent you been paying attention?

The golden cross specifically means the 200 and the 50 moving averages. Just change the indicator parameters in settings. The default on wisdom is 9 I believe.
Nope. Not sarcastic. Have seen BTC explode in an upward direction too many times after this same pattern (big drop followed by lots of nice rounded bottoms, flat periods, BGDs, and general trend upward).  Yes, I think we will crush 10k tomorrow, maybe even tonight if Asia sees what I see.

[edit -- $1000 up in one day has happened several times, even in the "bear" market... not sure if $1000 in a day in the other direction has happened, even in the "bear" market)
Looks like not today.  Pretty soon though.  The days of four-figured Bitcoin will be far in the rearview mirror in a few months.
[deleted]
We stayed in this range for 3 days exactly over the last weekend without it being "one hell of a nasty... blabla". There is literally no argument for your hypothesis. It would be entirely the same thing if I say: "If we dont break 9k today we are going back to 6k." Its nonsense. Which doesnt mean it cant happen, but there is no actual reason for it to do.
Oh, definitely. I wouldn't look to close that thing at all right now. The short-term bearish case just took a sizeable percentage drop in likelihood of execution. 
Haha.  Thanks for the explanation  ;)
We're approaching the 8960 local high on the 5m chart.  If that hits, it kills the narrative.
I don't care who is bearish and who is bullish, but I don't think BTC cares about random targets at all. We were supposed to struggle at the 'trendline' but we literally blew right through it. What people do with their own money is not my concern, I just dont understand these random numbers. Can't I also say that 8700 is a higher low and couldn't I use that argument all the way back to 20k for whichever narrative i'm trying to support? Not saying you're wrong, you may very well be right and we crash to 0 by end of next week, I just am trying to wrap my ahead around so many posters here. 
Endless. 
They dont need to destroy, they can just buy it up and remove it from the market. 
> Shouldn't that imply, that during bull runs, it is destroyed? Which only happened one time (small amount) so far.

Well no, it would mean when money leaves it is. You can trade with fiat on exchanges (yet).
No because it moved hands
No... it doesnt. 

It does mean that in order to keep 1:1 with the USD, Tether has to buy up USDT (remove it from the market), which is what they've done so far given that USDT hasnt gone far below 1 USD in bull runs. 
The value of money  in sidelanes in any platform trading against tether. 
Question is why go through the trouble of doing that?

Looking like that little bump up is just the start of another smaller iteration of tightening this coil.
You delivered. 
Didn't we just move from 8.75 to 9.15 in one push?

Give it time.
So we're speculating on coins being sold but never left the wallet? Seems like a stretch.
You're saying it was a pre-arranged transfer AND that it occurred as a market sell? Those are incompatible
well i saw 10k go to one address.  If it's OTC that's a big buy.. 100 million..  people like that dont usually play those kinds of nickel and dime games.  They dont have the stealth.  They spend all their time just getting into position and worrying about slippage.  You cant daytrade that kinda cash.  But George Soros did do that with the pound.. didnt he start talking recently? uh oh..



Only been around since January serious question any tips?

So there's multiple ways to take the one excerpt that you included but he also mentions that if negative feedback is introduced and the trend still holds it leads to more exuberance.

So far bitcoin has been able to hold its trend. It held on to long term support if it never reaches a lower low. Soros mentions a lot the creation of a "super bubble" preceded by a smaller bubble.

Just in the same way a nuclear bomb is set off by a smaller bomb. So he would likely ride the super bubble up and short the fuck out of it when it gets to what he considers to be the top.
I don't believe there will be an alt cleanse per say, I think there will be an alt explosion as in the number of alts. The alt cleanse will most likely mean the main "alts" will bleed off market share to new projects and btc and eth will continue to grow in a more stable manner. 
In my opinion, the tech doesn't really matter right now. So few people are actually capable of understanding how a blockchain works. Most investors will see it as "the new internet" which they did not understand at the time either. Billions of dollars flowed into sham companies during the dot com bubble because investors did not fundamentally understand the technology so marketing won.
The first case you can’t really call a bubble pop , it was simply a huge scandal that completely digilimitazed bitcoin that resulted in a devastating lasting bear market , the recent bear market was in fact due to a bubble pop due to all the euphoria from the huge bull market with insane % gains , completely different story from each bear market , just because their graph is similar doesn’t mean it will maintain it in the future 
Wow, where did you aquire this newfound emotional intelligence? I like this L14dy
Legitimately tempted to travel to Zurich now haha. 

Genuinely hugely appreciate your words - just admittedly Bitcoin can be stressful as hell. I've lost a decent amount the past few weeks but I do to a degree justify it to myself by reminding myself that, to be fair, I've learned a hell of a lot about trading and markets in the process. An expensive lesson, yes, but a lesson nonetheless. 

I've done a decent amount of web dev before - I consider myself fairly decent with Ruby on Rails and before that object oriented PHP with various frameworks, but I ought to learn more skills. I've admittedly not been working in a while beyond the odd freelance job and I suspect part of my uh, depression, lately, has been down to the fact that I've been very much dependent on gains on crypto, and I think, quite frankly, it's a lot easier to make better trades when you aren't dependent on them. 
I should say, it's a bit more nuanced than I made out in the previous post. I went from not much, to gaining a shitton, to losing a decent chunk of the shitton trying to chasing it on its way down. 
no we retraced TO there  . it wasn't a 37%  retrace 
I try to remain as objective as possible. 

I can't claim I'm completely divorced from emotion though. I still get a bit worked up from time to time if things don't go as I expect them to. 
Ha, well I'd ideally like a position I can set and forget, but the market just keeps pushing up so massively that it doesn't make sense to keep holding onto a position. 

We'll see how this goes. 
This is getting ridiculous...
Didn't see that guy but yeah, DK's attitude was markedly different than most assholes/shills/trolls/whatever that have a presence here. It was readily apparent he was only interested in himself. Even when he was sucking up and being nice to someone (e.g. Chew), he was clearly only trying to weasel brownie points and build up his reputation. He was basically just playing theater in the comments. A true sociopath if I've ever seen one online. Or just a pre-teen.
I put "Chewy Take the Wheel" by Carrie Underwood on and went 100% 5x long at 8750 this morning, so that's nice. 
Yeah I saw it on an alt once but that's it lol
Good call and nice close. I think I may end up doing something similar, holding above $9180 for a bit would have me itching to long
this
thank you
Yes. Look at the 1hr chart today, 9100 might be a better choice to hold. Could use a re-trace soon.
That's generally the point of an analogy...lmao like what 

if I made analogies about divergences by comparing them to advanced biochemistry would it be useful to a hairdresser? 

It's not in "the definition" but it's the general purpose of using an analogy. 
You stated that it was moved to an exchange ~  that is why people are demanding proof or stop stating that.
That's a brittle spirit
You go slow and steady, we like to crash and burn. 
For me as a noob i feel like i need to make every move count, if i'm off position i'm missing out. It's more probable to hit a winning trade if we open a lot of them, even if we close most on BE or small loss. The problem is that we can hit 10 in a row and be on the top of the world, or miss 10 in a row and deploy our stack. 
My luck tends to force me in to the last one, flipping a coin should be profitable than following my own choices :)

no need, thanks for the shout out!
I just gave you several reasons. Investor interest is growing. Developer interest is skyrocketing. There are more crypto jobs than ever before as financial institutions open their doors for the first time in history.

This suggests that peak investment in crypto is yet to come. Thus, the price will continue to trend up for years.
A new industry being built around this speculative market that knows it needs mania to continue in order to justify itself in the near term

What would be the expected time frame for these coins to hit the market? Will the trustee have to hold them until September in case of CR as well?

My apologies, also...chances are it'll be more diluted than straight sells, but who's to say.
Yeah if you're gonna follow his trades I feel like you need to follow every one. if he makes a losing trade that's all the more reason to keep following cause he will win eventually 
I followed chewys lead, as well as you. I feel like I’ve been making bad trades so I didnt feel obligated to post it because people would assume “ oh look he made another bad trade “, yet I’ve had my good trades too.

oh boy... i'll keep it short

mt gox = biggest exchange in 2013.
Got hacked, lost 600k btc of the 800k btc in storage. (this hack took place over the coarse of a few years)

Legal actions ensued, they had to cover the stolen 600k btc for about 400$/btc. 

They sold 40k of the 200k btc that was stored, this was sold during the september > jan bull cycle and during the jan > feb crash. (it was sold on avarage price of 8k$ iirc) This generated enough fiat for them to cover all the charges put on them.

The remaining 160k is still stored, when the news leaked about the previous 40k being sold a lot of people got freaked out, anticipating the remaining 160k to eventually get sold aswell. Mt gox claimed they are not selling untill at least september 2018. 

Just now 16k of these remaining 160k moved to a different wallet again, why is anyone's guess
the 16k Mt. Gox coins that have been moved but as stated by kobayashi "wont be sold". With a supply that large they could dump us back to goblin town. 
So my question was if its resonable to assume that people who fear a dump is incoming are selling, or are fleeing to eth.
  
Also if we consider that they sell off, they would also sell off all the btc fork, like Bitcoin Private and so on. Now imagine a 16k sell order on the Bitcoin Private order books.
>Hey Mike, are you still holding on to your short or are you expected this move up to continue?

Still hodling that short. Stops around $9600. 
would be epic if he just ran off with the BTC himself, claiming it was a no-win scenario.

I'm not in disbelief- I longed for the first time in...3 months a week ago. I'm saying the market is in disbelief and the disbelief rally can go pretty far. 

I personally think we'll turn around still- downtrend breaking is nice, but not nearly as bullish as some people make it out to be. It was an extremely aggressive line. 

I put more faith in horizontal lines than diagonals, and so far it's worked really well for me. 
8923, id put it higher if i had a better entry
[deleted]
[deleted]
ofcourse they are going to tell people to calm down, they don't want to ensue mass pannick that cuases a 5k drop in value because everyone fears the off load. 

Its like a crashing plane and the pilot saying "it's ok, we'll land it down safely"

This is going to get sold as fast as it can, lets just hope they are actually smart enough no to market sell this shit
Even if he speaks the truth I think the psychological impact of it will give us a dump anyhow, but tbh if I was in charge of those coins I wouldn't dare moving them unless it was a security measure or I was selling them. Too risky
>All I know is Kobayashi (I think) said not to look too into it

Ok, the market should be satisfied with that response...
Unless they send it to bitmex and go 100x yolo
I think best to stay in one position and stick and minimizing multiple trades.

And thanks for being on the same intellectual level as me. 
This doesn't take account value into  account though right?  Isn't your margin call associated with leverage and total account value?   This only works if you're leveraging 100% of your assets right?
The 3k limit is only for capital losses applied against ordinary income. Capital losses in excess of that carry forward to future years and can offset future capital gains with no limit (and can continue to take 3k increments against ordinary income until exhausted). 
Yeah but I mean what's going to happen if we do it 11,700... that confirms that what then will happen?
Yes, but the closer you are to the line the smaller loss you'll get when you're wrong. Better to take a hit here than short lower and wait for 9.2 to close it.

That is small risk. He's got like $100 sl, how much lower can you get? I wouldn't short here but can't say it's bad move.
Well I certainly know my way around a thesaurus, if you know what I mean. 
I see, interesting. It's a bit rough but it could work! If I remember correctly it would play nicely in the "bullish lite case" of /u/midnightocean where the market hasn't quite found its channel yet but is still bullish. will keep an eye on this thanks
Very good point.

And conversely-conversely, looking back, it has also broken *down* from a big old bull flag on about march 24th.
Do they have the coinbase buy premium?  I just tested it again.  BTC was trading at 9108 on coinbase, but to buy is 9176 plus a $22 fee.  No wonder tgey make so much money. That is out of my USD wallet, no other party involved. 
Already approved there.  Just took awhile.  Was def my first choice.  I have not really looked at their fees but I'm betting they are a good deal lower.  Thanks again for your help. 
Gemini's fees are brutal
> For someone who is sure the price is going down

I'm not sure, and never said I was. I just think the risk/reward ratio is poor and it's dangerous to market buy during such a formation (and based on what happened right after, we can see why).

> abstaining from shorting is the same as buying

It's absolutely not, that's a very...misguided notion. I'm not sure why you'd think that. Being in a position, long or short, carries risk. I was out of position, and so was not at risk, which is very different to being short (where I'm exposed to the risk with the hope of getting the reward). This is of course putting aside the whole overly-philosophical "not being in a position is a position" stuff, because my focus was on r/r.

I had to chuckle because, with all due respect, your argument reminded me of being [not even wrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_even_wrong).

I personally tag any person having multiple accounts as pure trolls (thus: stupid)

I don't get the point of needing multiple accounts except for going into bad behaviour.
He's right though. If you're selling right now, it doesn't speak well of your intellect.
No problemo 
Eh, I can sometimes be interested in fractals.  But definitely not in this case with our flat-line run up looking totally different.
I don't think that's what he meant, but even if he did, there's absolutely nothing unreasonable about thinking $6.5k wasn't the bottom...
seems like it. he would only move those coins for two reasons; security or selling
What is a p2pkh? 
multisig could might be an improvement looking at the balance of the wallet...
They could be using secret sharing externally instead of p2sh multisig @ the protocol level.
Agreed, lots of money there just not being spent on Bitcoin. Which is a pita as ignore it too much and it drags stuff down anyway.
BCH due to fork I understand, any specifics why EOS is so resilient?

I hope this does not get deleted as altcoin discussion, as it's quite probable that the performance of the strongest altcoins will become a bigger and bigger factor in BTC price. 
Well, damn alright. Could you chart some of those previous patterns you saw? I'd like to see them myself. Might consider opening a long if I like what I see (I already had a long from 8813 but closed it at 9268). 


Also keep in mind that past patterns don't always play out in the future, but hey I have no reason to not believe you right now.
~~This~~ "z"  is good for Bitcoin.

That's what the weekly candle looks like. Shooting star doji. Typically a reversal candle. If it stays that way it will continue to be a signal for a reversal. I said nothing about how the market would react, nothing about price targets if it stays that way. The market could completely ignore it, sure. 

I just mentioned it in case people weren't looking at weekly charts and might be missing this, i feel, rather important piece of information.
Sure does, that's my bail point.
Confirmation bias dude, spend hours on charts and drawing lines and channels, searching for patterns. You search long enough for things you will find them. TA has uses. TA as a religion is a thing, though, and lots of people here are desperate for a "system" that works for them to get rich.

Support/resistance levels are a thing, and that's where a lot of targets come from, but when you get into more convoluted and complicated signals with many factors, like MA's, clouds, fib levels, wedges/flags, channels, etc - things get much less reliable and way more voodoo, yet people cling to them as if it's some sort of mathematical reality.

The chart is a psychology chart, not a scientific one. I think that's what people forget when they get too attached to patterns.
It's clear you don't know what you're talking about. 9170 was the last local high. Anyone can see that.

If it is removed from the market during bull runs, wouldn't they have a huge stack sitting around to be released in market downturns instead of having to print new ones?

Otherwise; Tether circulation could only ever go up.
Could be OTC
Discussions at times like this leads to clicks anyway. I am trying to be straight to the point. 
I'm aware. And my choice was to get a few laughs out of your low effort content. Just like it was your choice to post this. Isn't freedom of choice wonderful?
[deleted]
the trustee basically came out and said he did OTC sales only.. not market sells.  OTC you arrange a fixed price ahead of time.

> any tips?

Because you *can* use margin doesn't mean you *should* use margin. The most I've ever lost is using margin in conjunction with market orders. Long story short, a 0.001BTC margin short of an alt turned into a 0.003BTC, 0.006 BTC, 0.01BTC, 0.02BTC etc... Chasing the price upwards. Looking back, what I *should* have done  is place 0.001 BTC margin sell orders separated by 8%-10% from eachother. I would have held an underwater short for a while, but I would have made it out in the green. 

Then there was a less extreme repeat of that. And that's how I turned 0.9BTC to 0.1BTC. But now I'm buying dips and cautiously playing the swings in bitcoin and alts. I'm holding my bitcoins and using them as collateral to long bitcoins at Bitmex, very very carefully. I have small buy orders that are $200 apart, whenever one is filled, I place a sell order of equal or slightly lower value $200 above. I have sell orders that change from $200 apart to $300, to $400 apart, depending what 3% above the previous order approximately is. I'm sticking to $200 for buys until we decisively break through $10k, even if the sell orders change to $300. It's a little bit of a brute force approach, but it's been working for me. I've been accumulating on each buy order (the sell orders that replace them are always smaller). And I'm careful to make the largest leverage I partake in to be under 3X. The lowest buy order I have is at $6000. If we drop directly to $6000 right now, my leverage should be about 2.7X, if I've calculated my loss down there correctly. I highly doubt we drop to $6000 without catastrophic news. I sometimes google formations and make some small adjustments to buy or sell orders if there are basic formations that seem to be completing.

That's all I have to share. That's what I do. I hope it helps! :D
So you think Soros entering now is the beginning of the run instead of the top? :p 
Eh Ithink it already happened. 

When Dentacoin stops pumping  I'll say alts have been cleansed. 
Why? Why more alts? What do these alts do? Why so many of them? Why are almost all of them centralized? 

I agree with Sloppy that this space is a joke until all this trash gets washed away. BTC, XMR & LTC are here to stay. The rest? Eh, it all looks like total trash to me. People are only trading alts to make money (and accrue more BTC). The end of this phase cannot come soon enough.
I dunno. Scalability is an outstanding concern and is a real challenge to realizing Bitcoin's full potential. LN should help a lot and proof of concept is certainly there but seeing some more real world use would go a long way in assuring investors and will hopefully all-but-kill BCH and other shitcoins for good.
Uh you realize bitcoin had several bubble pops before 2014 right? 

Meh it's whatever, I've had this argument a billion times lol. Same things said back and forth, no one ever agrees. 

The disbelief that you have right now is the same exact disbelief 2014 peoples had. 

Also, there's nothing barring another guy coming out and saying he was running a willybot again. 

Remember the 5 btc every 30 seconds on GDAX guy? Yeah, I remember. That's 600 btc an hour...at 5 digit prices...

it doesn't matter how the price got so high anyway, the bubble popped, people sell. 
I have my moments I guess
We all get depressed man. Happens to the best of us. Even me (believe it or not).

Just pick yourself back up. I had a couple losing trades last week (all of them happened on Friday) and then I got a little pissed off because it made no sense.

Haven't traded yet (salty I wasn't awake for the candle through 9500, woke up to 9500 and didn't pull the trigger for some stupid reason)

The most important thing is to pick yourself back up!

And yes, you really should get a job if you are dependent on Crypto gains. Or sell some Crypto to have a safety net.

This could come crashing down to 1500 in no time. Don't be stuck in a bind. Good luck!
That's still not bad.
I'm actually surprised that you didn't hold that 6.8 long. That could've been the one to fire and forget or at least leave and hedge with a short in case of a drop.
yeah he really wasn't that bad. esp towards the end

true sociopath 12-15 year old boy .. is there a difference?

I honestly miss it, if we start another bull run I will be way happier than if this goes to $3-5k 

did you really tho? 
Wow that's nice.  

I was already confident in my position and with his endorsement I increased it another 25% to become 75%... But at 2x.  Wanted so bad to go in deeper but after the last 2 days I just couldn't take the dive, didnt have the room for the risk.  Should have taken a day off yesterday!
Got ya bud
I think we might re-test $9000, and if it holds well enough, we might establish it as support. But right now, the highest reliable support I see is $8600.
> if I made analogies about divergences by comparing them to advanced biochemistry would it be useful to a hairdresser?

Well that depends on the audience, doesn't it?

Not all analogies are perfect, sometimes you roll with what you got, divergence doesn't really lend itself to neat and tidy examples
I really hope you aren't comparing my simple change-up to advanced biochem (and newb traders to hairdressers) lol
Does the word "apparently" mean nothing to you? I am tired of this fanboi behaviour without any room for any discussion, whether positive or negative. 
You need to limit your downside 
We have now broken through the bottom chart, did you add? Or going to wait for a pull back 
A industry is filled with shady people , frauds and scams. 
Nah.. bitcoin market is bigger than any manipulator.. it is organic, gluten free.
Who said I was weak and odd? (They were right)
dont know.. It's so slow its not even funny.. been going on for years.  I wouldn't exactly call it a short-term concern.  
From a creditors point of view...optimistically by years end.

By Japanese Court's time...by the time our first born are grandparents themselves. Our great grandchildren will likely be noveau riche trillionaires.
He's talking about the victims.
If you want to blame him then yes. But if you follow every one then you can't blame him cause you're in good profit.

I follow a lot of his trades, but never blindly, I follow the ones that I agree with and there was a time that every one I followed was the bad one, which meant we were both wrong. It didn't mean that I can blame him for my bad trade.

Didn't agree with that previous long and was right this time. Agreed with last one and so far so good.
From Reddit - ETH:


[–]OperationNine -2 points 5 minutes ago 
The reason BTC dumped right before $10k (besides the fact that it was overbought) is because the Gox trustee arranged an OTC deal on April 26th.

Since he doesn't gain shit from selling the coins...the people buying it from him dumped the price down so they could get the bulk coins cheap.
it'll have to be sold sooner or later.   Or is the trustee going to pay all the victims out of his own pocket?  Rip off the band-aid.
Last Mt Gox sell off caused a 90% decline though..

May I ask how you are calculating your stops and what the 7% refer to?
I think it's time for me to take a brake from trading. Huge streak of bad trades, and the good ones i let greed take over and turned profit into losses. 
SL @8940 (outside of the possible wedges still in play and the 15m BBands)
Looks like you are winning - nice job.
I don't know man. This inflation thing is really hard to live with. I went to the bank to get some cash to buy something, but by the time I got to the store, my cash had already devalued by 0.000000001%.
But why would you want tp?
post above says they consolidated them all into one wallet. see? nothing. 
> lets just hope they are actually smart enough no to market sell

someone can do some nice frontrunning with that.
soviets move tanks on the DMZ border .. 'nothing to see here.. dont worry about it'.  Sniper lines up red dot on your head.. 'dont worry about it just checking the barrel'. 

Markets arent prone to panic or fear.. they're completely rational!

eh plus he said he's done selling. it won't be until like September until the rest of the coins are released 
if he wins.. he pay the investors 1x and keep 99x. if he lose.. he got hacked again.  



Yes, if you only use 50% of your available funds you have have to use 1.4 in your calculations so in that case, your liquidation value will be 6285 and so on.
You can use the [Measure Rule](http://thepatternsite.com/measure.html) to calculate a potential price target. You take the difference between the top and the bottom and then multiply it by 'percent meeting price target'.



The top of the formation is 11,700.


The bottom of the formation is 5,900.



The 'percentage meeting price target' is 62%.




11,700 - 5,900 = 5,800


5,800 * 0.62 = 3,596


11,700 + 3,596 = 15,296


Rounding that to 15,300, we can expect it to potentially reach a value of 15,300. But keep in mind, there is only a 62% of that happening.


**Edit**: This website uses 66% instead of 62%, making the final value 15,500. I don't know where I got the 62% from. However it is close enough to not be very important. Just wanted to point that out.
We stayed at 8.8k the whole days, shorting it 1h after a pump isn’t that smart.
As it could very well break up from this bear flag here. There's good support here, but also no follow through. So i favor the chances of this breaking down.
Go to Gdax.com, sign in with your Coinbase login.  That is their trading platform.  You can transfer in coins/fiat instantly with zero charge and buy w/ limit orders at 0% fee.  You can also transfer in cash w/ a linked bank account or wire transfer.  Coinbase is a user friendly retail ripoff.  
Gemini recently raised their fees to 1% from .25%
As others said, simply login to coinbase.com, but then open a new browser tab and open it to gdax.com -- you will already be logged in, and can transfer your coinbase balance to gdax using the deposit button (free to transfer). Then, use gdax.com for all activity. FREE limit trading, and even market trading is .3% vs coinbase's ridiculous fees. Exact same company, just different websites with different fees.
Kraken is also trustworthy and since their upgrade usually works fine (it was an overloaded disaster last year).
*Ohh....* Yes. Yes we did.
I know sentiment is all over the place. It's really funny lol 
eh, it's a lot smarter to sell here than at sub $8k. 
the most secure thing you can do with a cold wallet is not touch it without a damn good reason.. like to sell.
I think the former
http://lmgtfy.com/?q=p2pkh

You can check my post history for the tech rants in early December
:D

Yes, they could. I didn't even think of that. They probably are not though :D
DYOFR.
I know Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a good friend of mine. And you, sir, are no Bitcoin. :)
Seriously, why is this even a discussion? You are literally pointing out a fact (i.e. if this particular price action happens, this is what the candle will look like)

I don't get how that is a contentious point
Oh okay, I totally misunderstood your comment then. Dont even know what I read when I read it the first time...
If the trend line holds as support, we may get a nice bull flag pattern going forwards.
The resistance at 9000 has been relentless since the 21st.  Feels like Jon Snow is manning that wall.
That's the thing that is so stupid. If you want to argue TA is risk management to set targets for yourself and cut losses, I can see some value in that, just as I can using bankroll management to gamble with, but to argue it's predictive literally at all is madness. I can give a chart to 20 different people in 20 different time frames and they'll come up with a thousand different ideas. 
Who cares about a local high besides just trying to make small trades it's pretty irrelevant, it's almost as if arbitrary numbers are arbitrary and depending on who is drawing the chart can come to their own conclusions? As of 48 hours ago we were at 9750 can't you see that? I get that you like to use TA as risk management but to argue that it is predictive is false.  So if it goes over 9,170 are we headed to 9.7 again, how's that work? 
> True, but then it would mean no (net) fiat money left crypto since the 800B mc we had.

Why? Tether get's destroyed, market cap goes down.

Thanks
I think he likely entered longs at the long term support line and told everyone he was going to start trading after he already built a position. The price never went below his announcement.
You shitpost once in a while like most of us, but when you're on point...man, you're *on point*. You weren't even around for 2014, right? And yet you hit the nail on the head. Literally every day of 2014 someone would come around and say this was just a temporary hiccup and we'd be back at $1k+ any minute now. Fast forward a few years and it was "obviously" a bear market and "obviously" the fault of Gox / Willy bot / etc. Nevermind that it was actually the China bans that set off the initial panics, and nevermind that the darn thing would have imploded under its own weight regardless of the trigger or what people would have assigned in hindsight.

Well, nobody wants to hear it, but there are way too many similarities between then and now. This time isn't different. Now I don't know how much lower this goes (maybe $6k was the bottom, but I doubt it) and I don't know when the next bull market will start...but like you said, it's basic psychology and market / business cycles. $10k+ is going to be a minefield if and when we get there, unless we get there so long from now that everyone from this run is shaken out and the painful memories have faded (I'm talking months/years, not days/weeks).


Well, if you take all of my trades since then as 1 single trade, then I'll still effectively long from a bit below $6,800.
All he did was:

1. Attacked people with pejoratives for having the opposite position as him

2. Made predictable, bland and unoriginal sarcastic jokes that were almost never funny

3. Pretended he was a TA master but begged Chew for advice at every turn

Guy was pure scum. Glad he landed in the shitter.
Well it's less concerning when the sociopath still has acne. 
Yes, I really did. I'd made a number of bad trades, but my gut was telling me at least retrace this drop, if not continue past. I was on the fence leaning long in the 87xx range when he posted. 
No haha i just had to find something that would make a knowledge discrepancy apparent in my example 
Do the words "chill out" mean anything to you?
Will try and wait for better trades instead of gambling on what will come next, a BGD or a BRD. 
And start locking in profits even it it reduces my chances of hitting big. Slow and steady. 
Not necessarily disagreeing. I just see great incentive right now to whip up another frenzy this year, based on actual developments or hand-waving (and many who have staked their reputation and resources on the idea that the market will soon validate how ‘revolutionary’ crypto is....)
In that case, mea culpa...made an ass of myself.
Yeh I only add to my position if he opens after I have one open, otherwise I ignore it
This is made out of thin air again.. There was a massive profit taking on most alts prior to btc going to 9,6, which makes sense because BTC is the gateway to fiat.
as far as i know, they already sold 40k btc back from september 2017 to feb this year to cover all the expenses they were charged for.

The remaining 160k fully belongs to them now
It happens dude. I have that problem too. Holding on to my positions for too long is something I do all the time....   
But a small break can do good sometimes.   
At least your stop was better than mine :)
[deleted]
Thank you very much for this explanation, this would be great to see. 
We stayed above 11 for a long time, then it pumped to 11.7 and dropped to 9 eventually. Was short at 11.7 bad?

I go with r/r. 9.2 is resistance, shorting it with stops above is good r/r. Will it be profitable? We'll see. We had a lot of fake pumps lately.
So no buy premium? Coinbase is ridiculous.  Just tested it again to make sure I was accurately shocked the first time.  BTC was trading on CB at 9108, but to buy was 9176 plus $22.  That was direct from my USD wallet so no other parties involved.  
Ye exactly..same wallet he used to sell with earlier too. Feeling very confident hes selling these coins
Bro. I've taken a look at the charts and can't find any. If you want people to take you seriously at least show us what the hell you're talking about.
>you are not a decentralized ledger 


Uhhh... thanks?
Nice to meet you Sir. When moon Mister Bitcorn?
I'm not sure i understand what you mean. Bull flag on the weekly? Don't think i get it/see it.
Sorry, removed my comment before I saw yours, because I was thinking net fiat money couldn't have left.
This tether thing always leaves me scratching my head.

Edit; btw, Tether never gets destroyed in market downturns.
You're welcome! It's always a pleasure :) 
Hah, thanks man. I've spent quite a bit of time reading 2014 dailies and just dailies in general (mainly 2014-2016 and Nov-dec 2013) actually, which is why I know anything about it. Since most of my interaction with the bitcoin market is this sub, it's really almost like I was there. 

and it's very similar to now. I would really love for $6k to have been the bottom, but if this plays out like 2014 (and it is playing out incredibly similarly in terms of price movement AND sentiment) it'll eventually go a bit lower. Doesn't need to be anything crazy like $1k but $1k wouldn't even be that bad, really. 

I just think the market needs to cool off and chill out in order to make room for the next run is all 

but yes I agree with everything you wrote. there will always be a reason in hindsight
Well, if you count your penis length along with the spine then it'll be longer...

You know it's not how you count this.

I'm not judging here. It's just you always say you want fire and forget and then you just close them all. In that case you're more in making profit than leaving it open. Maybe consider second trading stack?
eh he never really insulted people personally or harassed them seriously. It was clearly all in jest. He was obnoxious but was at least funny about it. 
give him a gun and some go-go powder and he's good to go acne or not.

yeah I was pretty close to it too. Figured we'd at least chop around first but it's hard to know if I'm overtrading or on the money 
Dude.. I'm ok with someone saying, chill it's no big deal. Or like the first comment pointing to some information. But just look at the rest... 
Few years ago i saw huge potential in the cryptocurrency industry but i no longer share this opinion.  The technology is revolutionary and wonderful , the industry and people around it have become very toxic.
I always consider his entries and exits. Ignore if I have different view. Sometimes helps me to decide if I'm not sure, like today, was looking for entry since he closed that previous one, took me an hour to decide whether I should enter at 8.8 even after he did.
they have to cover the victims with 500$/btc so he only have to cover a certain amount of FIAT. What happen with the remaining btc is unknown. But im not sure that he already has enough money to cover all the peoples losses.
It will be hit shortly (probably before i post this). 
Will clear my head over the weekend and see on Monday if i keep trading or withdraw the remaining of my stack.
I lack the discipline for trading, always wanting a bit more. Its good for improving ourselves in our lives, but terrible when it comes to trading.

$9300 is looking like support.
Sure man, happy to explain it. Mostly because it makes me excited. I wish there was a 100% chance of this lol.
9.3k/9.5k is the real resistance I ain’t shorting before that unless it gets weak.

But meh debatable, However i don’t like fomo shorting after a pump.
Correct. Coinbase pricing is = gdax pricing + premium + padding + exhorbitant % fee. Gdax pricing = gdax pricing.
No matter if hes selling or not, these coins are a permanent source of FUD. And if it gets confirmed he sold 16k coins despite telling everyone he wont make a move, the market will go to shit very quick.
the coins were moved to 14LuAvrRzAmeikgaafs7H5695xs5dVXqA5
and yes.. it was last used to send out
2018-02-09 14:09:43

What did the price of bitcoin do on 02-09?
I checked.. nothing.


What exchange? Kraken?
Brah, man to man, some gratuitous advice: Don't give too much thought to random internet dudes whose username you don't see often on here. This place is flooded with paid shillers/fudsters and paid voting brigades. You let them get into your head even a little bit, your own logic and research becomes tainted with their bull/bear view. In other words, compromised. It's their job to do that, and one of the reasons why this daily's sentiment is often opposite of what you should do is because they're driving the sentiment. Just becareful out here. I might be a paid shill bc stokinator is saying shit that competes with my position. You don't know, so best not to interact too much with randos, especially if you don't have your own mind made up and a plan to go with it. 
You do not have the hashing power of the Chinese, American, and Russian government combined. Put it that way.
Everyone has their own moon.  Mine is when I can pay for everything in Bitcoin and the idea of selling to dumb dirty dollars is absurd, probably 3-5 years.  Yours may be a lambo, maybe 1-2 years depending on when you started and how much you put in.
Well, I think it goes without saying that I change my mind constantly — for better or for worse. 

In an ideal world, I'd be able to open 1 single position that I hold for several weeks as the market gradually stair steps it's way back to $11,700. And that's my hope for this position. 

Again, ideally, I'd wake up tomorrow to see the market at $9,500. I'd wake up the following day to see the market at $9,200. The following day $9,700. The following day $9,500. The following day $10,100. The following day $9,700. 

Slow and steady. 

But the reality is more likely to be:

Wake up to the market at $10,100. Wake up the following day to see it at $9,200. Then $9,900. Then $9,000. Then $8,600, then $10,000. 

That kind of volatility is hard to just sit on my hands through. 

So how I play this position will depend entirely on how the market behaves going forward — as it always does.
Surprised you think such trite and predictable sarcasm is funny. He was just posting the most reject copypasta and calling people names. There was no surprise or depth to the "jokes" he made and he had the most self serving attitude I've seen just about anywhere on reddit. He sort of shaped up after the mods called him (us?) out but he couldn't keep his veiled ego from sticking its ugly head out in every post. Plus, he was trying to pass himself off as TA proficient but he really wasn't. He seemed like a sociopath to me and I really wouldn't describe anyone else here that way. One of a kind.

edit: Also, I'm sure this guy is working up karma on a new account so he can start posting again. Can't imagine it'll be too hard to spot him again. Wasn't there already a theory that he was someone else?
Ok then:  chill, it's no big deal.
Set a target, if it goes over then set stop loss on your target and let it ride. If it comes back then you still in profit with your target, if it rides further then move your stops to another target.

F.ex. I have my targets every $250 per BTC, if it goes up 350 and looks like it's gonna pull back I set stop on 250 and let it take care of itself.
I'm not saying you should. I'm saying it's not bad trade. And you're saying it is just because you don't like it.
That purchase on gdax would have been 9108, plus either $0 fees if you used a limit order or .3% of your purchase total if you used a market order.
I'm curious is there a site tracking the satoshi coins?  or are those coins lost?

Otc orchestrated by a japanese exchange. Probably bitflyer
> This place is flooded with paid shillers/fudsters and paid voting brigades.

I'd need to see hard evidence to believe that. What is much easier to believe is, "this place is flooded with idiots, noobs, and people with big talk and nothing to back it up." That's much more realistic, and those kind of people are plentiful (and post for free).
Oh. I thought I did. Well that's a bummer :(
> Mine is when I can pay for everything in Bitcoin 

2% chance of that ever happening in the USA or EU.  It's already illegal in China and India and several other countries.
I understand that, really. I'm just pointing out that you say one thing and do the other one, we know that this market is almost impossible for fire and forget, so maybe either stop hoping for it and say this every time or just do it and leave it open.

I've tried fire and forget but volatility is just too tempting and too scary simultaneously.
I think you just took him too seriously. He's a nice guy, really, afaict and he has calmed down quite a bit. Some of his humor was predictable and juvenile but a lot of it was just stupid enough to make me laugh

I also like crypto_chad69 and binary_echoes though, so I might just have bad taste in people. 

I also like you even despite all of the shit that has happened. I tend to like anyone that can make me laugh and doesn't take themselves too seriously. 

Sometimes I wish you'd lighten up a bit but I figure you're just intense by nature

I do agree he needed to chill out a bit especially when he started getting a bit cocky. but he did and he'd probably be okay now

Afaik he is still here but you probably can't tell who he is because he's not shitposting anymore. 

btw, I ended up hitting "close" on bitmex during the huge pump over 1h at $7400. Didn't hit "market" til $8000. 

I thought it was hilarious that you "while you're trying to figure out the buttons on bitmex" comment came true. 😂

It really sucked, cause I lost a lot of profits. But whatever. Lesson learned. bitmex mobile UI is hard to navigate and the panic was terrifying 
I tend to scalp more than big trades, today i had a short from 8870, on bitfinex the lowest it went was 8650 and bounced quickly over 8700. The only stop i could have put was a breakeven above 8800 and would have been stopped. Thought about setting a profit stop @8620 or so (on kraken actually would have hit) for 50% of the position but kept hearing in my head "8500", "8200"... 
More than ever believe that the secret of trading is exiting positions more than entering them.


And, you can ACH into and out of your bank account with $0 fees.
The wallets associated with “satoshi” are public, so you can check what’s in it .  Just that no one has access to it, at least that’s what everyone believes.  If one day, the coins move from those wallets, it will be a big deal.   
Haha your version is much more true and readily verifiable. 
Sorry to disappoint you, but it's better to play the hand you have rather than the one you wish you had. :}
Things I can already buy with Bitcoin (directly):

* real estate
* vehicles (more and more dealerships are accepting BTC)
* airline tickets (Cheap-o Air)
* electronics (NewEgg)
* hotel rooms (Expedia) 
* landscape services (my lawn guy is delighted to take it)
* accounting services

I can also buy any consumer good though not directly through bitcoinsuperstore.com 

In Japan I can pay my utility bills.  In Costa Rica you can already pretty much live on Bitcoin because everybody takes it.

Never say never.  I'd say in 3-5 years, most businesses in the USA will be happy to accept BTC.
Perhaps you should stop asking me for targets then? Or perhaps I should stop giving them when you ask. 

Since targets are generally more guidelines than hard/fast rules for me. 

I think perhaps what you're really asking when you want to know my targets is, "what do you you think the market will do next?" or, more accurately, "when should I close a position opened when you opened yours?"

And if that's your question, then that's quite literally impossible to predetermine. Absolutely, 100% impossible. 

Is $9,750 a good target? Fuck if I know, how'd the market get there? If it took it's leisurely time, that might be a terrible place to exit and you'd miss out on all the gains between $9,750 and $10,800 because you closed at $9,750. 
He has no responsibility to you. He’s giving insight into how he trades and He can change his mind as often as he likes.  
I don't think he was a nice guy, though he might have been acting the way he did because of personal turmoil. Maybe deep down he's a good guy but his persona didn't match that at all.

crypto_chad69 and binary_echoes resemble your classic troll. /u/dushmankush did not. He wasn't in it to entertain others here or stir up some fake drama for laughs. He got a rise out of diminishing others and was only ever interested in himself. There's at least [one other person](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ezv0s/daily_discussion_thursday_april_26_2018/dy13pj1/?context=3) in this thread who agrees with me.

>I also like you even despite all of the shit that has happened. I tend to like anyone that can make me laugh and doesn't take themselves too seriously.

Either way it's quite a different case, is it not? My criticisms, rebukes, ridicule, etc are pointed, and they're pointed at specific ideas, not people. With DK, every insult, joke, criticism, brag was aimed at bringing the other side down. If I'm being critical, even if it's over-critical, the criticism is directed at a set of idea, separate from the poster themselves. Also, I'm not a troll, unlike these 3 guys. Even a piece of sarcasm or joke I post is always obvious enough to pass the smell test. I'm never trying to play the psychology of others. *

>Sometimes I wish you'd lighten up a bit but I figure you're just intense by nature

I'm intense about misinformation and posters who are faking expertise or analysis. That shit's really not cool and should be called out or moderated. I just report that stuff now, per my conditions of release. I've got a sense of humor though and do my fair share of shitposting. In fact, I seem to recall you calling me out by name for being funny a long time ago.


*I have done this in ETHTrader on occasion but I was provoked to do so.. and it's ETHtrader. 
It's easy to enter, it's hard to exit. You're right.

When I don't hit my target I usually end up in a loss, that's why I try to find perfect entry right on the line so that my loss will be very small.

The secret of trading is cutting losers fast and letting winners ride until you make decent profit.

I'm lately cutting my winners fast just to make some profits, cause we aren't in the market that will let it ride far. That's why I said you're rushing. Short from 8.9 is risky. It should have 9.2 sl, which for me is too big. It's entry that you need to prepare to lose if you want profit from. That's why I'm out. 9k long was too risky for me and 9.2 short was middle of the night but 9.1 after bounce from 9.2 was the entry point with good r/r, not 8.9.

0.1% chance of that happening.  
I think I'm getting misunderstood.

If I ask for a target I'm actually asking for 'what do you think will happen now and where do you see resistance zones'cause those are usually your targets.

And it's not that I criticize your trading style. We've been arguing on different occasions for months and I never tried to fight you in any way. I'm just pointing that since drop to 3k you were looking for fire and forget and every time you decided to close. Just wanted to know if you're actually looking for this or just hoping that one day you'll manage to leave it open.

And it's not to fight you. It's just I've tried it myself and failed and lost hope for such entry so I decided I won't look for it any more. Helped me a lot with taking profits. Was just wondering if you really believe if this is achievable or you're just hoping.
No fighting.

That's fair, and he did do quite a bit of the weird psychology trolling. perhaps I'm biased because he was insulting other people and not me. You're right that it was a bit more manipulative than funny at first.

When people started listening to him and liking him he toned it down a bit though. 

I do think he could come back and be fine. 

Also, your ethtrader comments (and comments towards me and a few others) were *very* aggressive, I saw some of them. It's nice that you don't try to play mind games and are very straightforward with your insults and judgments, but that doesn't mean it was any more pleasant. But that's in the past and you seem way more level headed now. 

I do think you're funny, and I like you more when you're funny over aggressive.

How'd you get unbanned btw? I was considering appealing for you after I saw that you PM'd chewy. 

Also for what it's worth I do side eye arsonbunny now, since he seems to post *after* movements happen rather than as they do. lol

The guy is clearly smart and knows some good stuff but the trading in hindsight thing is su

Not enough for me to really care, but I do believe you and the ops mommy about the faked screenshot a bit more now. 

Still think you were too aggressive about it and it's kind of silly drama, but thought I'd say that 
Got stopped at breakeven, at least it didn't close in the red. 
Now i'll wait. Chewy entered a long but i find it to risky for my taste, only if it drops to 8600 or so for SL @8500. Shorting 9200 also seems risky unless it gets clearly rejected. 
Now i just watch.
Yeah, well, actors aren't known for their brains... especially American ones.

So I'm just gonna say you're wrong.  
It's absolutely achievable, but it's not always the best approach either. 

And I know you're not being combative, don't sweat it. I'm not angry or annoyed by this discussion. 

Anyhow, take a look back at $4,000 to $20,000. There were a number of "set it and forget it" opportunities. You could have bought anywhere in the $4,000s, anywhere in the $5,000 to $5,500 range to start with.

But was that really the best strategy? In hindsight maybe, but what about in real time?

In real time the market pumped to $7,800 and then dropped to $5,500. 

Somebody simply holding a position from $4,000 went from 95% profit to ~35% profit with no guarantee that they wouldn't wind up closing at breakeven. 

After $8,000 broke, you could have "set it and forget it" all the way up to $20K. Watching the market fall from $16,000 to $13,000 would have stung a bit, but not nearly as much as watching the market fall from $7,800 to $5,500 would have. 

From a quality of life standpoint, I'd like to have the foresight to just hop into a position and let it ride for a month. I'd have a lot more free time if that were the case. 

But practically speaking, doing that requires you to sit and watch your profits drop significantly and just ignore it. Which is a very difficult thing to do, particularly when you see it coming ahead of time. 
I think he's just frustrated with my approach, which I understand. An entry is only 50% of the equation. You need an exit as well, and I don't provide exits until I make them.

However, to change my approach would almost certainly flip me from a profitable trader to an unprofitable one. 

If I said, "I'm going long at $8,780 and taking profit at $9,280" then he'd be a lot happier. Because he'd have a nice giftwrapped little position package. 

But that exit is also purely speculative and it would be downright irresponsible of me to provide trading advice in that fashion.
Who's fighting?
>When people started listening to him and liking him he toned it down a bit though.

Yeah but it wasn't genuine friendliness. Everyone knew someone in high school like this. Someone who was manipulating people all the time, like they were lab rats. It's the same sociopathic characteristic on display here. 

>How'd you get unbanned btw?

Reasoned with mods and agreed to leave whatshisface alone.

>I was considering appealing for you after I saw that you PM'd chewy.

Anything for Chewy.

>Also for what it's worth I do side eye arsonbunny now, since he seems to post after movements happen rather than as they do. lol

Oh yeah, *that's* his name. Must resist urge to comment.

>The guy is clearly smart and knows some good stuff but the trading in hindsight thing is sus

Must fight inclination to lambaste.
i"m not an actor...long story about the name.
So if we know that this may not be best strategy, and usually we don't know if it was until after the fact but we know that BTC is volatile market so if you want fire and forget then you'll have to deal with huge lose of profits then why you keep saying that this is the one you'll keep open if you already know that you won't cause you already know that slow and steady climb is almost impossible here?

I think this was my original question and I think the answer is that you actually hope this time will be different and it ends up being the same all Bitcoin after all.

And the target question was a bit off from me. But it was faster to type. I expected something like 'if it won't break below 8.5 we should see 9.8 before another pull back'. You're right. Should ask 'what you think'. Will do next time.
Yeah I understand where's he's coming from. You also say one thing one minute and change your mind the next (with little apparent reason).

But it's whatever, you're not beholden to other peoples' standards and if your trading style works, then it works. 

Either way, providing consistent updates in real time (without whitewashing and fudging success) is both generous and all one can really ask for from another trader on the internet.
Ok, I'm being misunderstood.

I've explained this in other comment.

I'm just a bit disappointed that after all those discussions you still think I'm the one that will follow you blindly and blame you when it goes south.

This whole discussion was about 'belief in fire and forget' position and somehow it turned into 'i have a problem with chewtoy'. How did that happen?
lol I don't know why you think I love chewy so much. I just meant that it reminded me you were around still and probably wanting to be unbanned. 

I checked up on you a few times and saw you posting in skywalk's sub and felt bad because you looked very lonely. 

When you messaged chewy and he posted about it I figured I could use that to sway the mods into letting  you come back. 

Has nothing to do with me doing something for chew. 

Can we just clear it up that I have a lot of respect for chewy but I in no way idolize him?? Really, man, it's just cool to see someone who's down to earth and a good trader. It's nice seeing someone likable excel at something, that's all. 

Very honest, stand up guy is all. His experiences with losing a lot of money and crying about it and shit also resonated with me 
Oh, OK. Sorry for assuming.  I still assess your opinion as incorrect. :)
Because I truly do believe that I'll keep it open indefinitely when I say that I will. Because I'm in a different mindset when I open the position than I am once the market has moved on from my entry. 

After the explosive move from $6,800 to $8,400 my long from $7,900 or so felt like it could stand the test of time in the short term. The market might whipsaw a bit in the mid to upper $8,000s, but my position was more than safe and there was no compelling reason to close it on the horizon. 

Then the market broke out above $9,000 and just hovered. Once it hit $9,300 I was skeptical, so I closed. At $9,650 it was just so absurdly overbought that opening a fresh long would be both irrational and reckless. So I shorted.

Your stance is that I shouldn't even bother stating that I intend to hold it indefinitely, because that's ludicrous. I should know that at some point the market will become so overbought that I'll have to close. 

But just because I've closed a lot of my recent positions prematurely doesn't mean that I won't let this next one ride. So as long as my mindset when I open is, "this one could be a longer-term winner" then that's the analysis I'll offer. 
I've replied to him. That's completely not what I wanted to argue about in this discussion.
I wasn't lonely, I was just itching to respond critically to shitposts. There were a few posts I saw in particular, can't remember them now, where I was just waiting for someone to step in and say something but, because I was nowhere to be found, the posts went unturned and even upvoted at times. Shit was driving me wild. 
I don't know if we understand each other here. Not saying you closed prematurely cause this would indicate that I argue about some kind of bad trade.

But you're right, we have different mind sets. I'm more like 'i think it'll go up $500 and if it does go there I'll think about keeping it longer' and you're like 'I'll ride it to moon, but when it goes hard up and stop I'll secure profits'.

And once again I understand more of your style thanks to this discussion which was a good lesson about trading.
I think we're on the same page now as far as what we're discussing. 

To expand on what I said higher up:

A set it and forget it position is only really possible at the beginning of a trend reversal. Doesn't matter which direction, up or down. 

If you were to compare where we are now to any other point in recent history, we'd be at $4,100 or so. The market just jumped to $4,450 after bouncing around between $3,500 and $4,000 for a few weeks. 

A trend reversal is very close to being confirmed with a weekly open and close above the log resistance line. Although others would argue I'm calling that too soon. 

The market may drop a little farther there down into the mid to lower $8,000s, but it's quite possible that will be the last buying opportunity in the $8,000 range for quite awhile. 

So if there were ever a time where it was possible to open a set it and forget it position, that time is quite likely now. Or at the very least soon.
Yup, won't argue here.

The question is 'is anyone actually capable of opening 8k long, see it go to 11 and watch it go down to 9 without closing'.

Numbers are a bit off but you know what I mean. Seeing position in green is one thing, seeing 80% of your profits evaporate and do nothing about it is different thing.
Well, it's essentially the hodl mindset on a micro level. 

So I'd argue that there are plenty of people who can do exactly that. Just not necessarily you or I. 

For me it just requires complete and total faith in the inevitable bounce as well as faith that the market will make a new local high. 

A clearer trend line would be helpful in this hypothetical position. The ascending log channel was fantastic in that regard.
