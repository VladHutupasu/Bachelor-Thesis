[Daily Discussion] Wednesday, May 23, 2018 -- TITLE
#New post: [\[Daily Discussion\] Thursday, May 24, 2018 ‚Üí](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8lpstw/daily_discussion_thursday_may_24_2018/)
/u/ready2maga asked a good question about the demographic of the trading clientele on GDAX. 

*****  


At this point I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs primarily or mostly bots, and an occasional institutional human trader. 

Here, I‚Äôll show you how this can actually be semi/quantified somewhat.  

On GDAX we can keep track of other people‚Äôs individual orders. It‚Äôs a UUID but what we don‚Äôt know is *who* it belongs to. 

Luckily we don‚Äôt really care about the identities of these other traders as much as we do deducing some of their *trading characteristics*.  

&nbsp; 

So we‚Äôll posit a simple hypothetical here: 


1. That traders, both the human as well as the algorithmic kind, have a more or less consistent reaction time when it comes to the speed at which they can modify or cancel their orders.  


This seems pretty reasonable. Using this, we‚Äôll filter through the limit orders on both sides of the book and group all orders with matching UUID‚Äôs, remove all match messages, and just focus on modifications (cancel) messages and arrange the orders into what I‚Äôll call ‚Äúlatency buckets‚Äù (where we‚Äôre deliberately contorting the word *latency* to instead mean  ‚Äútime between updates‚Äù).  

If an order of size `Q` gets added to the book and then modified/cancelled in a certain number of milliseconds, `Œ¥t·µ¢` (more accurately a certain *range* of milliseconds: `Œ¥t·µ¢‚Çã‚ÇÅ+Œµ < Œ¥t·µ¢ ‚â§ Œ¥t·µ¢‚Çä‚ÇÅ-Œµ`) then it goes into the *i^(th)* latency bucket. Now, if a *new order* of identical size, `Q` gets submitted to the book within half of the temporal standard deviation of the potential match order‚Äôs latency bin, then we‚Äôll *link* that order ID with the previous one. 

I‚Äôm leaving out some detail in the interest of not overcomplicating this post, but the end result is that we now have a view of the unexecuted limit orders on both sides of the limit order book, and linked how we would intuitively imagine them to be linked (this linking of orders helps dampen some of the skew that would otherwise result simply due to the fact that machines are able to replace/cancel faster than humans by some orders of magnitude)
Anyway, we can arrange these in order of size, latency, activity at price, and run various statistical tests on them, etc. 


Now we need to find a way to represent them graphically. 

Since we‚Äôre basically dealing with multidimensional records here, we‚Äôll condense all this down to just two columns of data:

1. Order size.  
2. Latency in milliseconds.  


One idea would be to represent them as `x` and `y` values and plot them that way, but it would be difficult to interpret the resulting plot. So instead we‚Äôll take each pair of numbers to be polar coordinates: `(r, Œ∏)` where the logarithmic `size` is the radial length (distance from origin), and the `latency` is the angular deviation from a vertical line. 



Here‚Äôs what we end up with.  


* [**Buy Side**](https://i.imgur.com/J8xWocg_d.jpg?maxwidth=2000&shape=thumb&fidelity=high)  
* [**Sell Side**](https://i.imgur.com/willqZ0_d.jpg?maxwidth=2000&shape=thumb&fidelity=high)  




&nbsp; 

So you can see that the charts reveal some interesting detail. 

Aside from the obvious nature of the heavy sell side activity this afternoon, we can see that the charts are rather visibly bifurcated into human and machine reaction times: with the activity such as it is being concentrated more to the machine side of things. It is also apparent that the order book activity is heavily dominated by a relatively small number of high volume entities.  

On a technical note, the plots are actually 3D. The third dimension, *time* (recency) is depicted by (HSL) luminosity values. Thus the more recent an update is the brighter it appears, while older updates gradually fade into the background etc. 



&nbsp; 


*****  


**N.B.**

On the bid chart I‚Äôve labeled the major HFT market maker that every trader on GDAX knows well by now. They‚Äôre the ones who run that annoying, timer-based, *Please FOMO You Dumb Mother%@&$!!‚Ñ¢* momentum ignition algorithm; the one that stacks 30 or 31 BTC on the best bid/offer.  



&nbsp; 

*****  

**ETA**: it‚Äôs interesting to take note of the *temporal variance* between lines of identical length (i.e., updates of identical size orders). From the extensive tests I‚Äôve done on this topic over the years, the variance in reaction/update time is typically much smaller with machines than with humans (which accords with common sense; since system trading‚Äî even the event-based kind that‚Äôs reacting on a per-message basis‚Äîtypically incorporates some form of **timer** somewhere in the run loop (if only for rate limiting purposes); whereas humans I would imagine typically do not make trading decisions on a timer lol)

Oh look, it's bouncing *downwards*
I think among this sea of red and excitements, one thing we all appreciate is that how the mods are doubling up their efforts to keep the sub clean and focused. Shitposting to thank the mods. 
REKT: Liquidated short on XBTUSD: buy 308540 @ 7637.0 REKTosaurus üé∞ üí∞ üî•

You really have to wonder how much people are gambling on mex if they're getting liquidated on a short right now...

So, I see this symmetrical triangle referenced a lot. This is a *BIG* formation, and breaking it would mean we will see a big move. The question is whether we break up or down.


Symmetrical triangles are continuation patterns, so my question is: Assuming that the triangle pattern continues, do we continue the uptrend or continue the downtrend?

Personally I do not know, so I'd like to hear some opinions and thoughts on this.
How did GDAX web UI become so buggy in the past month? Used to be rock\-solid \(I'm talking about the web UI, not exchange going down often last year\). Now portions don't update correctly half the time and need to refresh the browser often.

/rant
I know yall hate 2014 comparisons but...interestingly enough we are at the literal same exact % of ATH to within +/- 0.5% in terms of days after ATH

on the 157th day after ATH 2014 was at 39.5% of ATH, just like we are right now. 

$20000/$1150 = 17.3.  7900/17.3 = ~$450, the exact price 157 days after ATH. kinda wild huh

https://www.tradingview.com/x/8dQzn7sF/

Even more interesting, and some possible hopium (!), they went on to 60% of ATH after this. This was even after a hard rejection from their equivalent of $9.5k. Sound familiar??? :O

So who knows! Maybe we have a bullish summer. The decreasing volume while coiling and sort of sagging downwards is similar as well. I'll be paying extra careful attention on May 31st :P 

Also note that a few days after tax season (April 15th, I think?) ended there was a huge pump in 2014 and 2018. Not sure if it's just another coincidence. 

anyway, this isn't meant to be taken that seriously, I just thought that exactly 157 days after ATH both 2018 and 2014 being at the same exact % of ATH was funny

-------

for anyone who wants to check the dates. ATH in 2013 was 12-04-2013. 5-10-2014 was 157 days after.

Our ATH was on 12-16-2017. Today is (or was) 5-22-2018. 157 days

I'm targeting a limit buy in the 7250 range.

Once RSI cools a bit on the hourly, we should see further movement downward, and below 7600 the next support is 7200. I think this will be our bounce location as it appears it will be a self-fulfilling prophecy at this point. This is also near the current log support from 5900. There is potential for a bounce back to the high 8000s/low 9000s before bouncing (again) off of the descending log resistance from 11700. At this point I will likely exit all positions with Bitcoin (including my HODL stack), as I think we are headed much lower from there. My plan is to accumulate as much as possible when the bottom is finally found (my guess is in the 4000 range). 

Apologies for the long range on this prediction, but I think significantly more pain is on the horizon based on today's action. 

Hopium scenario: We still have a ways to go on the Daily chart before we reach a lower low (6400 range), so it's possible that we will establish a new higher low and see an extension of the equilibrium on the weekly chart as the summer plays out. 

Current mood: Bearish

Well at least I guess no one needs to worry about taxes on gains this year.... :D
Ill be adding to my short from the mid $8200‚Äôs around the yellow circle on my chart ( If It gets there), if not just gonna let my baby ride

https://www.tradingview.com/x/UnxzyUFG/

Pretty weak bounce off the $7860 and I dont think the bulls will have the juice to burst past 8k. 

The super strong support that turned resistance is acting as even stronger resistance, we are also bear flagging pretty nicely right now, similar to the one above our current bear flag that broke down. I expect this one to fall as well. 

Longs are increasing, shorts are decreasing and the price is continuously dropping/ barely increasing. I‚Äôll bail on my short over the top of descending channel if we break back in, probably around $8160 where I‚Äôll break even on my short.

Took 30% profits before at $7888. For those going long, good luck.. my bullish feelings have drifted away for now and when they come back, I‚Äôll swap long. 

On that note: Goodnight all its been an exciting day of trading. Make some money you sluts 
The crypto business is uglier than most things. 

It is normally perceived as some kind of cruel and shallow money trench through the heart of the financial industry, a long plastic hallway where thieves and pimps run free and good men die like dogs, for no good reason.

4h RSI is at 19.4, i do not find a lower one even 1 year back. https://www.tradingview.com/x/sVLfJs0H I think start to scale in to a low(3-5x) leverage long here is not a bad R/R

Also my gut feeling tells me, the big cryptos VERY rarely drops below 10-15% several days in a row

edit: Longing 5x 7625 here,  First target profit 7800
My 25x leveraged long was liquidated while I slept 

Lost about 10% of my total crypto capital
I believe, there's another bear flag forming right now. Its target would be in line with a resistance line in my chart at around $7450.

I can only hope that this will be the reversal... :-/
There is something therapeutic about dumps like this. It‚Äôs a chance for a resolution to the horrible situation we were in, edging down from just under 10k for many consecutive days.

Sometimes you have to crash down to rise back up.
this sub is so bearish, I think it is a good time to go long 
Buyers just stepped out of the way. 
It's possible we get a bounce here.  RSI is pretty guttered on most timeframes.  [Here's a quick comparison to the last sell off from $9.3k](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Qyj505w8/).  Both are roughly $1100 from the peak with RSI at similar sub 20 levels.   If we retrace half the drop, it'd put us at \~$8k.  

Still this may languish towards $7k as it's beginning to feel a bit like a capitulation in the making with longs still holding positions. 
https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/GKZ5fhX2-Two-Scenarios/


Made this to show my thoughts on the situation. It's pretty simple really. We stay in the triangle for at least a month and then, depending on what happens at the upper line in late June, that will determine the long term trend.
I'm still short here, limit buys to close position and go long missed by $5 on the low. It feels like a matter of time before we drop down again. I'm looking for 7-7.2, maybe a long wick into the 6's. Sentiment still low, longs still growing. RSI/MACD will be ignored until we see confidence return - the most likely place for that is the 6.9 area we've previously seen confidence. I'll look for a long above that area.
I am starting to realize that this sub is full of gamblers. Reading a bunch of stories about people who got hella liquidated... I mean, wow. I had no idea. I thought people in here were sensible with a good head on their shoulders.

To those of you who didnt just take a huge loss, here‚Äôs my rule of thumb:

1. Never naked short Bitcoin. That is, never short more than 1x composite leverage. You can go 25x short, but never with more than 4% of your entire crypto stack

2. Never go more than 1x long composite leverage. That is, never EVER buy more contracts than the value of your entire trading stack.

3. Always set stops. You can have generous stops. In times like these my stops are below 7800. Tight stops are a better option most likely.

Disclaimer: I made a bunch of profits in the bull run and I never trade with anything but my profits. If I ever lost all my profits, I would never trade again.
Pretty interesting, I just found the angle and height of last two bounces are (nearlY) identical. 

If this plays out like our last bounce we should go up about 3.5% here and then go down another 5.5% to about 7600.

Chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/6y9fGD44/
The price action last night and this morning fit into my chart way better than I expected it to. We broke through our smaller downtrend channel and bounced off the 10K downtrend log resistance turned support. It didn't take long to break that too, though, where we fell to our larger downtrend channel support. We bounce off that to retest the 10K downtrend log as resistance again, which held, and now we're flirting with our channel support again. If this breaks convincingly, we may finally get the mirror of the BGD down to the low 7s.

Macro: https://www.tradingview.com/x/mzL9V1gq/  

Longs are up against shorts slightly. Futures premium has faded some, but still $60+ over swaps, while swaps are still trading above spot by $20ish.

Still holding my short, no plans to close it any time soon. Last night I tried to scalp short $100 movements. Won 2 out of 3. I have another small one open from 7870 on swaps (spot was 7850 or so). 
Sitting directly on previous resistance, tested twice in November, 8th and 16th before the runup. 

If we fall through that resistance turned support: likelihood of a triple bottom? It'd meet up nicely with the log scale ATH downtrend on the 29th / 30th

Forgive the noob chart/noob post, I'm new to this so criticism is welcomed. Let me know if I'm missing any big indicators.
It's looking more and more likely that we'll visit the bottom of the [large pennant forming on the daily](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Il9RvQlZ/).  Price targets in the $7100\-$7200 range.

Underwater longs may get a [technical bounce around $7630 when price intersects the support line](https://www.tradingview.com/x/xvtIhrSf/) formed on the decent from $10k.  I don't expect much of a bounce here... maybe $8k max.. as many longs will likely be bailing on positions. 

I'm a buyer at the bottom of the wedge.  Safe trades!
The breakdown at $7,900 and subsequent events is almost textbook Wyckoff Distribution Phase E:

"Phase E: Phase E depicts the unfolding of the downtrend; the stock leaves the TR and supply is in control. Once TR support is broken on a major SOW, this breakdown is often tested with a rally that fails at or near support. This also represents a high-probability opportunity to sell short. Subsequent rallies during the markdown are usually feeble. Traders who have taken short positions can trail their stops as price declines. After a significant down-move, climactic action may signal the beginning of a re-distribution TR or of accumulation."

Hoping for some consolidation/accumulation in this range.
Potential ascending triangle forming here. I'm not convinced, but I'll be looking for the ceiling to break: https://www.tradingview.com/x/SshK3Wi9/  

Yes I cut wicks. Volatility has been bonkers. Still holding my short though. 
I think it's kind of interesting thread with the thesis being that 2018 isn't 2014 because there are less weak hands this time and more money sitting on the sidelines waiting to add liquidity to the market in the 6k-7k range.  I'm unconvinced, but I don't have access to  the chatter in the OTC market.  

https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/999384961315692544
I see a lot of people talking about the long:short ratio and saying that a long squeeze is likely and it's kind of becoming a meme at this point. How is 30k longs significant at all when the daily volume just today for example was 852k btc, and 38.5k on finex? 

I remember in February during the crash to 6k pointing out that longs were a lot higher than shorts, but it didn't end up meaning anything. ~8k longs closed around 8k but barely moved the price at all, then as the price went from 8k to 6k the same number of longs opened and didn't start closing until 10k.

I know many here are not too interested in fundamentals, but there is a lot of exciting stuff going on right now that sooner or later will be appreciated by the market.


[Follow up on the last trade.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8l74h5/daily_discussion_tuesday_may_22_2018/dzdu98u/)

[Heavy bearish momentum through the TD9 buy](https://www.tradingview.com/x/cOOrKSF3/) and low RSI levels on the pinbar hit my stop for a 1% loss, but since we never broke the top of the pinbar only a 50% position size was entered.

With the break of the previous pivot at 7840 leads us to a more extended correction and we look to lower targets. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/gKUCuYWk/

The first target we have already reached with the confluence of targets around 7780 being the 0.618 retracement level, the 0.618 WXY extension and a 1:1 lower degree ABC extension.

The more extended target lands us at the 7100 level reaching the 1:1 WXY, 1.618 ABC and the 0.786 retracement. Getting down this low is scary since it breaks the most generous channel I can draw given the current wicks.

**What next and trades**

*Longs?*

We could put a pivot here but being on a 4/9 on the 4HR TD and 2/9 on the Daily TD ([Above TD Chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/cOOrKSF3/)) makes me hesitate to reopen the long here despite the RSI being oversold on even more timeframes and being sat on support. I like the stars to align with my trades, others may take the risk.

*Shorts?*

A decisive break down of 7780 here would point to the lower target of 7100. [Opening a short with tight stops \(1.3%\) above local high at 7900 could be on the cards.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Byf83A5A/) It's not a nice place to short with a high risk of a fake out, but some may be forced to here to close or hedge any long positions they may have as the potential downside is large.

Have fun and good luck out there :)
Good thing I waited for Consensus! 
Longs are not closing, the insanity.
7.2& 7.3 might bounce stronger. then we'll fly around in volume gap  https://www.tradingview.com/x/AX4uYHbI/

I hope we do breakout today. if not we're gonna stay in this range and fill it
Had my limit order filled @7500 USD. There is longer term support @7400,  RSI is @historical lows on most time frames, we have a lot of red candles in a row and we're outside the bbands. Alarms below 7350. 

Also we just reached volume climax on the 15 min. Should really bounce now.

Edit: I don't want to mislead and clarify that I trade BTC/EUR but base my entries on the BFX price. I entered as soon as 7500 broke @6443‚Ç¨
I so want to cover more of my short and go long here...but I'm scared...

Plus it it literally didn't work the last ten times that I tried it.
Coinbase buying Paradex DEX seems pretty good news: http://fortune.com/2018/05/23/coinbase-paradex/

Their comments about financial freedom (and Paradex being closed to integrate with Coinbase ASAP) are certainly promising.
Long from 8190 still open, ouch. Added some more at $7500. Abandoning if we close an hourly below 7400 or if RSI cools off sufficiently without any upwards momentum.

Taking a few weeks off after this one ;) 
Just in case anyone isn't aware.

May 13, OKex CEO resigned. said he was going to take a short break. 

https://twitter.com/ChrisLEE_Crypto/status/995866481945559042

Then

2 days ago OKex CEO joined Huobi. 

https://ccn.com/cryptocurrency-exchange-huobi-poaches-ceo-from-major-rival-okex

OKex suspends withdrawals and fiat trading. 

https://dailyhodl.com/2018/05/23/bitcoin-dips-okex-releases-update-on-suspended-withdrawals-and-fiat-trading/

>"Please do not worry about any rumors circulating on the internet. We will continue to provide you stable and trusted service as always."

>OKex currently has the third largest 24h volume

this is possibly the reason for the relentless dump..

If OKex withdrawal are re-enabled then fears will probably subside and we'll see a bounce. It's possible fears are legitimate though. 
**My take on the next few days/Weeks for BTC**

Long wills continue to pile up like no tomorrow, possibly reaching as high as short levels prior to our BGD that caused the short squeeze. Perma bulls will start calling market reversal and it was the local bottom and shorts will begin to reduce as we slowly climb up to the $7700-$7850 range.

Over leveraged longs will continue to slowly boost the price up, until we hit heavy resistance at $7800. It will be nothing but a **Dead Cat Bounce**. We have failed to make higher highs and this is mimicking the $11,700 run pretty perfectly.  Big players will start loading up on shorts around $7800 ( I will be doing so as well ) only do dump on the euphoric n00bs that went way too long on this climb up. There will be a long squeeze that will bring us to the high $6000‚Äôs or the lower $7000‚Äôs and we will test the bottom of the symmetrical triangle.

I think this is going to play out very similar to our last BGD. We will hover around $7200-$7600 range as volume drops and long start switching to shorts as we failed to break past $7800. We will see an abundance of shorts starting to open and it will begin to look just like the $6400-$6800 range before BGD. We will see a short squeeze and another BGD that will start a small trend reversal to test the upper part of the pennant.

**This is all just a theory and the way I see it playing out. I‚Äôll be shorting the top of this DCB and longing when it consolidates in the low $7000‚Äôs range for a while** 

Feel free to throw your theory/ hypothetical prediction at me. It would be interesting to see what other people think is going to play out . 

**Edit** : I‚Äôm slowly adding into a short here, just added 25% of my total short at $7653 and will add 3 more trades up until $7850
Longs now 33k:20k in shorts.  Delusional folks out there.
Guys! HUGE FUCKING NEWS! You can actually scroll the chart on Coinbase Pro!
Time to re-evaluate my flawed trading ideas. I was doing rather well until I decided to return to alts as it really looked at one point like we were going back up. Welp. I‚Äôve lost a big percentage just moving around in alt land, and becoming conflicted again. Do I cut my loses and pull back into bitcoin and slowly but surely earn a steady but relatively smaller profit, or pray my alts recover. It‚Äôs a game of saw for me now :/
clsoed my scalp long for a little 1,5&#37; profit. 
Still crazy to me that shorts are closing faster than longs opening atm.
long 6470 euro, oversold up to 12h, good for me. 
Short from around $7,920 with stops above $8,200. Explanation in edit to come.

EDIT: The market is currently testing the former support line of the rising wedge that broke down yesterday: 

https://imgur.com/a/JQcTb4n

If the support line breaks, there's still the resistance from the wedge to contend with. I'd probably cut this before my stops hit if both wedge lines break, at around $8,050 or so. 

Also, I made a bad call to exit my short from $8,150 when the wedge broke down. I gave buyers too much credit and assumed that they were capable of breaking back into the formation just as they had earlier in the day. The breakdown shows incredible weakness on the buying side, and suggests that $7,800 probably isn't long for this world as support.

This bounce is the best opportunity I'm likely to have to hop into a position while the wedge resistance is still holding but support at $7,800 has not yet broken down.
Exited my short at around $7,530 for a nice short-term gain.

Looking for a bounce back up to $7,800 to reshort.

EDIT: Alternatively, assuming additional decline here, I'll just reshort the next strong bounce. There's always the potential that this keeps dropping to $7,200 or $7,000 before bouncing.
I just noticed these 30-ish day cycles that have been fairly consistent since January...

* 5-January: Local High of $17,252
* 5-February: Local Low of $6,000
* 4-March: 2nd High of $11,700 (double top)
* 5-April: Local Low of $6500 (I realize the low of $6425 happened a few days prior, but 6500 was the lowest low that began the next uptrend cycle)
* 4-May: Local High of 9990

If the current "channel" (if you want to call it that) that we're in continues, I could see hitting the rising log trendline around $6950 on 4-June....

Or we could just shit the bed and run straight through $7k tomorrow. What do I know?

Closed my short for $1mm from $8222, posted [here,](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8kae50/z/dz7x4w6) at $7964 for a total profit of 3.2%, or $32k.

I set 1% trailing stops when we confidently broke $8000. Finally filled. 
With every market sell there's more bitcoin in the strong, muscular hands of Chad bulls and fewer in the limp-wristed hands of virgin bears. I enjoy this process.
I came in here to lurk a couple days ago because I thought this place was the smart version of r/cryptocurrency and everyone was talking about how there was gonna be a bull run. I'd like to speak to the manager plz 
Please don't make me turn the daily into Swiss cheese. Post something substantial and avoid gloating about your epic gainz.

Edit: This is out of control. I have other things to do today. Please downvote and report shit-posts. I'll swing back in with the ban hammer later.
Closed my short from 8350 at 7550. Tiny leverage and position size so overall gain only about 1% of my whole portfolio but hey, i dont mind.

think im gonna start fishing for longs soon with stops at 69xx. but for now just watching whats going on

EDIT: considering entering some alts for a small flip back into BTC, some of these poor bastards are -20 to -40%, so tempting
I think this bounce will get us to min $7800 ... I have very little hope of a sustained rally, but I believe it'll take about 24\-72 hours for this to play out based on how soaked longer term indicators are looking.  

In the last sell off from $9.3k, we bottomed at $8.2k with similar RSI levels \(across multiple time frames\).  We then recovered $700 of that dump within 3 days.

If things play similar, it'd put us at $8.1k by the weekend.  I don't believe we'll make it up quite this far however based on current sentiment, some low hanging resistance lines, and the completely anemic buying pressure.  

I'm waiting on the sidelines currently and will jump into a short position once I feel this faux recovery is complete. 
!short XBTUSD 7600 1X 13%

Have been offline for the most part of past 24h so I am hopping into position with this bounce. 

I think there is no real support, just overheated RSI
Got stopped out on most of my trading capital during the night, now 80% in fiat.  Biggest risk for trading now is third party one, exchanges not working when you want to scalp. 

I do not even feel the despair/chaos panic selling yet, and this worries me. This is more the slow grind down until 1-2% of the mid term holders each level think they sell at something like 100-200% profit and get's over with it

On the other hand, when that part is over we are out of sellers
Anyone out of position...a short right here (7925 at time of posting) with stops above 8000 is a phenomenal R/R. All the resistances overhead.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/a9oswz3R/
Closed my long at 7725, stops hit. Never would have hought it would hit less than 24 hours later, but here we are. Lost 0.25 on my trading stack... meh

Going to see where this is going, but looks like 7200 here we come
My simple n00b plan of buying below 8k, especially during low RSI times, and selling above 8k, especially during high RSI times, has been working quite well. /u/DamonAndTheSea has a nice graph of a large pennant with 8k as the center line that I have quite liked and refer to.

I'm not sure how long this strategy will work, but I'll continue patiently. I'm buying a little here.

Best of luck y'alls. 
Managed to get out of half my long position in the bear flag before the dump.  Damn that was brutal.  Got stopped out of the other half.  Down just over 5%.  A decent chunk gone.

Will take a break!
Surely some sort of bounce here soon. Even if just for some respite. At this rate we'll be sub 7k by tomorrow. 

What a funny old day so far.

Tone Vays told me this would drop ha I do actually like him, I know many don't. 
At least the volume, which I was concerned about, is coming back but it's on a downtrend. Does this mean anything for the medium term?
Price just jumped to 7768 on huobi. I thought it was about to be a BGD but I checked other exchanges and price didn't move there. Must have just been a fat finger
Im coke'd up and I just drew these.   


[https://imgur.com/a/rIxUpHp](https://imgur.com/a/rIxUpHp)

Im just drawing, painting, having fun.  Trying to find consistencies that are actually irrelevant. Im having a good time! My hobby, I'd rather draw these than some type of other art. Not making any trading decisions, though. Why this coke got me so rational? All this feels more useful, than drawing cars, faces, animals or naked portraits of fellow gamblers. I do feel like we are at an extremely important moment here, right now, right here, we're here, right?  

Well.. Next stop soiledanusville

Been there before and I didn't like it.

Wonder where we'll be in a year... I'm assuming we'll be able to look back and laugh. Christ I hope so.


I thought a drop below $7,800 would be enough to shatter the premium on June futures.

Nope, still trading at a 1% premium. 

Perhaps it will decline if there's a failed attempt to pull back above $7,800 here. Probably not though. 

I don't use the term "delusional" lightly, but that certainly appears to be the case when it comes to Bitmex traders.

Coinbase are retiring GDAX on June 29th and rolling everything over to Coinbase Pro.

Hodl onto your butts
Calling the bottom at around:

MCap: 225-270 B$,

BTC- 5500$ - 6200$

Reason: 

If nothing extraordinary happens, we have failed to break the bear market which started from Jan. 2018. A very similar scenario (almost identical) had happen already in 2013/14.

Huge bull run at the end of 2013, bounce in January 2014, and a massive bear market (with few bounces) for 2 years, all the way in Q3/2016. The pattern this year looks the same. 

Further to add to this, we had really great news in the last months on global scale, pawing the way for regulation and adoption, yet nothing really happen price wise, which leads me to the conclusion that general masses (from the DEC run) are fed up and this in turn discourages new money. The general public is not interested in crypto for now, again. We need some organic growth before the media picks up again and fuels the next big run-up. Until then, other problems can be solved (use cases, tx count, UX etc.)

This are the reasons why I applied the pattern from 2014 to this year and estimated the numbers above. Will see how it works out, I will proceed to cash out a part of my holdings to (hopefully) up my stacks.

Opinions welcome, cheers
#Fuck. 

I wanted to get shit done today. 
Shorts dropping significantly. Longs increasing.

Shorts: 19462  
Longs: 33352  

This is ominous. The best case for a significant bounce requires shorts closing for profit or shorts getting squeezed, all while longs FOMO in off a relative low.

We have none of the pieces of that puzzle. 
Longs are growing while the price slides. Basically, all the buy support has been from people doing margin trades. It is very likely this will continue to drop another leg to at least low $7000s

!long BTCUSD close 7741

Got stopped out of what I felt was a very loose stop. I‚Äôm staying out until at least tomorrow. Painful. 
At what target price point are we expecting the majority of the longs to be liquidated? I would think a lot of fresh longs were opened in the $7800-$8000 range after the BGD spike from $6800 to $8000
Still have the horrible feeling that bottom will only be found once the majority are broken. 

There's still way too much optimism in most places you look. Maybe 3 to 4 months spent under 6k will do it for lost people. 

Anyway i'm short from 8100 and just seeing what happens here. Good luck people because this could soon quite easily be back into the 6s again. From there I really don't know what will happen. 

This time though, much more likely that we'll form a new low
It's stop hunting now. Don't get wicked out.
If you ever see my comment just do the opposite. Once again retaining the title of worst trader here. RSI is at 19,on the 4 hr, and we dropped out of the bollinger bands. we have to rebound soon. What is a good entry?
Can 4H RSI get even lower than that? It should be a good entry point but it feels that Crypto is panicking and I've missed some major news or something.
Anyone have any thoughts on this overlapped fractal I was playing around with before? It's our drop and sideways before the BGD. 

It should have pretty much played out by now, except for another slight bounce with minor lower low (would probably create a bullish div on the 4h)

Chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/bll97FJE/
Daily BBands sitting right here. Good time as any to buy back in a little bit. Probably going to either hold what I buy here until the support in my picture breaks or we bounce to 7.8k\-7.9k and fail there.

My chart is pretty boring and what a lot of people have drawn. [https://imgur.com/a/0cxukGQ](https://imgur.com/a/0cxukGQ)

My view here is moving to more long term as we start approaching a major decision point for the market \- if we bounce again off the support \(or make a higher low beforehand and have a serious, sustained bounce back over 8.2k\) now is a great time to start a DCA.

That said, the amount of longs not closing and shorts not opening here coupled with the sell volume makes me a skeptic of the prospect that we'll have a truly significant bounce before testing that support again.

!short xbtusd profit 7510 20&#37;

\(Note: typo in my position \- short from 8450 not 9450. Also have a logged position showing a 6&#37; loss on a short but that's actually a gain closing at 8200 rather than 9200. Fat fingers...\)
I closed my 8300 long yesterday at 8100 for a loss.

Long at 7510. Stops at 7280. We‚Äôre pretty oversold right now, hopefully can scalp this up to 7800. May abandon early if the selling pressure continues. 
Are longs expecting 
BGD? Shorts are pretty low..not sure if they squeeze will happen unless we see organic buying..

Trade Setup.

* Entry : 7200/7100 - 1/2 Each
* Stop : 6850
* Targets : 7800 / 9100
* R/R : Appox 3.8 (If half profit taken at each target)

Looking to play off the [TD9 4HR](https://www.tradingview.com/x/R8bojdkb/) buy in the next hour once again, I am looking for one more final leg down on the last 9 candle. This is a more aggressive trade where I will be setting limit orders lower down without waiting for a reversal pattern to produce, the 7100-7200 zone is a strong confluence area where a reversal is likely to happen.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/B1bAt74b/

One of two things happen here if we break down the current pattern, we hammer out the increasingly popular larger triangle, or a more bullish case is we start a strong wave three with much higher targets. We will in both cases have to respect the strong support turned resistance at 7900-8200. I would take some off the table at these and consider readding if we break the resistance. Stops would be below the break of the possible triangle, this is quite a large stop at 4% so size your position accordingly.

If we break upwards here I advise caution, we are going to smack headlong into strong resistance only $200 up so the R/R setup on the breakout is poor.

Sorry it's not much detail there are more indicators I am not going into but it is getting late, there is a good chance we don't even make it to 7200 and I need sleep. Good luck all.
I was comparing 2014 and now (again), and maybe there is some hopium.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/PbWktngp/

Back in 2014, the support line was clearly in a downtrend, and the price contracted for almost two years, forming some kind of giant falling wedge.

Here, the support is trending up making higher lows (5800 then 6500). 

But still, symmetrical triangles are 50/50. This one has to break up if we want to see bitcoin above 10k in 2018. We'll know in a few weeks.

The downtrend still hasn't been broken on the monthly chart.

*In my opinion*, we just reached the end of the E wave of the corrective trend and will start a new market cycle with Wave 1 very soon.

>**Wave 1**: Wave one is rarely obvious at its inception. When the first wave of a new bull market begins, the fundamental news is almost universally negative. The previous trend is considered still strongly in force. Fundamental analysts continue to revise their earnings estimates lower; the economy probably does not look strong. Sentiment surveys are decidedly bearish, put options are in vogue, and implied volatility in the options market is high. Volume might increase a bit as prices rise, but not by enough to alert many technical analysts.

long from 7570 , its down almost 10&#37; in 24 hours , bears are getting way overconfident , expecting classic BTC action
I've got the feeling we've arrived at some sort of equilibrium. The hype has gone some time ago. 

This drop also feels less filled with panic and "this is the end" comments.

The market participants who are easily panicked have left the market and are licking their wounds.

A good moment to reset the market. Slowly start a new cycle, beginning with "wave 1".
Expecting at least a dead cat bounce around 7200~7400. 7200 is perhaps what everyone considers the "perfect" entry position, but from my experience, bounces happen a bit above what everyone is eyeing
I'm seeing 2 options.  

Option A: we broke up and out of a falling wedge (bullish) only to return back to it (largely bearish).  Odds dictate we will break down/below the falling wedge support now.

Option B:  There was never a falling wedge (just a coincidence) and we're really in a descending channel.  

Both options aren't really great, unless your a margin-short whore (which I'm not).

3d MACD turning red. I think $7000 is the rational price point for the market to test next. 

I hope I'm not the only one excited for extended opportunities to trade and accumulate down here right? If we had the same price action but between $10k and $15k, I'd probably be wrecking myself with FOMO and hopium. Down here, things just seem more calm.
Just saw a 130.000 SHORT get liquidated at 7605. A true 100x bitmex degenerate :D
Accidentally closed my entire short at $7541 trying to set stop buys... instead I just market bought lol.

Welp, In the last 5-10 trades I‚Äôve made nearly 75% of my stack, erasing almost every loss I‚Äôve taken since I started trading. 

May have not been too terrible of a place to close. Like others are planning, I plan to re-short a strong bounce. For now, I have 0 intentions to long.

Instead I think fibs have the power, almost too annoyingly reliably. They're bouncing us around, consolidating price into a big triangle pattern again. I think we'll just tighten up until August. I'm fine with this, I make most of my money for the year in the summer, plenty of time to DCA in.

The next funding period on Mex shows a predicted negative rate. Make of that what you will,  but this often happens when we bottom out.
If I didn't lose shit tons of gains in my alt and just held BTC I wouldn't be panicking since it's chopping about 10-15% up and down.

So what's so different this time? 
Bears still have a little left in the tank before declining volume (the red squares) takes over. I would consider that weakness if they don't use it.

pray for me

small position
Price at 7720 triggered my stop limit which was filled at 7750, closing a long from 8850. 

Honestly I hate getting stopped out because I am certain the position will be in profit or at least even eventually but to become a good trader you just need to accept those losses. Stop losses fucking you 5% on every other trade and you making 15% on the other trades is much better than winning 7/8 trades but losing 80% on the 1/8th trade.
Is it "Sell in May and go away"?
This is eery, expected at least a bounce back over 7800 but zero bounce is incoming - maybe we will indeed complete the H&S MOAB's back down to 6500

Sadistically went all in at 7861 as I love pain.
Adding to my short here, general sentiment seems to be to long this but I think we are about to go down very sharply once the S/L cavalcade kicks in. Stops above 8k
Noticing how large traders are taking any sign of buy side liquidity on BFX  as an opportunity to close/sell. Seems like the first sign of any buy wall over 25 BTC is immediately ate.

***Very theoretical post incoming***


Although counterintuitive, I believe this much movement on such low volume is bullish. Obviously buyers have not been present up to this point. The only reason we stopped dropping (I believe) is because sell-power fell off. Look at past dumps. They have all contained massive sell volumes on the daily. But this dump isn't nearly as large (volume wise). This leads me to believe that those who want to re-enter are smarter, waiting for the price to stabilize in order to avoid catching a falling knife. The buyers looking to re-enter aren't "buying the dip" like novice investors, they are waiting for the sell side pressure to dry up to optimize ROI and downside. 



All of this leads me to believe that true wealth, not retail investors, are looking to enter. Thoughts? 



Let it be known I double majored in Theoretical Hopium and Alternate Reality Studies 
Bulkowski's Adam and Eve Double Bottom breaks down 64% of the time. At 62% completion, the A&E broke down.

http://thepatternsite.com/aedb.html
Now five times testing 7800.  It's unlikely to hold much longer, even though the chart says oversold.

Edit...broken...and now on the way to Goblin Town...
So where is that promised Inverted H&S lol
The pace is accelerating. Looks like we could reach bottom target much sooner than my date of 6/1. Not a lot of support in between here and bottom price today of approx 6820 . . chart https://www.tradingview.com/x/HpVEVV4b/
5x Long from 7500, hoping to scalp a bounce.
Longs just increased to 33k WTH..
Since this dump reached its first bottom, the price has bumped up against $7650 three times. You can draw a horizontal line between the three attempts. The third attempt is happening right now.
Longs are increasing to catch this bounce... lopsided longs just mean this bounce won't move too far up the chain before heading back down.

The lack of long capitulation is making me think we may actually break down from the pennant on the daily when we hit the $7k range... capitulation may not begin until the sub $6k range if this actually plays out
I see comments here about how all these longs opening are delusional.


Now I want to say that I am not long, and I think the price will probably keep going down, but for the people that are opening longs, I can definitely see where they are coming from. The RSI is *very* oversold on multiple timeframes and we‚Äôve had several red candles in a row, and we‚Äôre hitting the bottom of the B-bands. 


Does that mean there is FOR SURE gonna be a bounce? No. As I said, I think there is still more downside. But to call those longs ‚Äúdelusional‚Äù when there are several factors that make a long seem like a good idea just doesn‚Äôt make much sense to me. 
For any battered bulls out there, humor is how I deal with the tough times. He who laughs, lasts!

PS. It might be difficult to believe but until we break 6500, we're trending up. #stillbuyingthedips
Cant be that surprised. 12 hour emas crossed. Surprisingly the default emas on binance have been a solid tell for a good while now. Not sure if the majority of the bots are just using those.

For those who are short, when are y‚Äôall taking them sweet profits?

I‚Äôve made enough on these trades to go to Disney land but I‚Äôm not sure when to close. Little scared for a phat bounce.

Also, this volume on the dump is pretty depressing.. weak sauce AF 
When some of you talk about "the market cycle hasn't finished yet", what's the target to assume it has finished? 
I wonder what the opinions are about longs increasing once again to 33K. Seeing this I'm almost certain that the drop is not over.
Cancelled all the orders to build a dca long on Sept before this last drop.  Feels like more of a liability right now.  Will wait for the premium to go away or get a bit closer to the base of the macro triangle at 6.8 and maybe figure out the good buy range.  Would rather not catch a giant V. Maybe I'll just end up buying in manually when the time is right. 
I know this might sound like a stupid question to some, but how do futures premiums impact how BTC/fiat performs?  I'm not understanding the connection, for I am a simple man.
Is there a term for people who get rekt because of volatile fiat currencies fucking up their entries?

Seems like EURUSD is BGDing from the bottom right now. BTC/EUR longs getting rekt even harder.

We broke down from the bear flag but we continue to push down with a higher RSI (bullish divergence):
https://i.imgur.com/eUOUQ6d.png

It is a bit stressful but I'll be adding onto my long here just because the indicators say to - bullish divergences, RSI is oversold, volume is picking up and the 6hr looks like it is ready to bounce. And even if we do continue to fall I can't imagine I won't be able to get out at breakeven in the next few days. R/R is just too good not to long imo.
Reopened my short at around $7,600. 

Stops above $7,900. 

Buyers just are nowhere to be found, and this small bounce has reset RSI on low timeframes (although not much has changed on the medium timeframes ‚Äî they're still oversold).

But I'd rather be short and wrong than neutral and wrong in the current market.
What's more likely come the summer...

Over 10k or under 6k?

The odds are under 6.

We are in a bear market and swinging back out of our little upward pump of recent weeks. There aren't many bullish signs left. It sucks but I get the feeling reality will bite in the next month with some serious speed. 

Ah, and we're back to sailing the Red Seas. 

I'm honestly surprised that price is holding around 7900 so well, despite the little dip overnight into the mid 7850's. RSI 1H/4h is quite oversold, 1h MacD is trying to flip green, and we're desperately trying to cling on to that 0.618 fib from our local high. 

I expect a bounce here and the development of a rounded bottom. Suck it bears! (s/l ~7800-7700, will keep an eye)

I definitely screwed up the bot thing. 
Looks like a pretty textbook bear flag. Opened a medium-sized short at $7850 in anticipation of another leg down.

Interesting, I assume a small rally for the big volume coins on Paradex 
Looks like a bear flag taking shape now, signaling a further drop. We are already decisively below the 50-week MA.
This has been the easiest downtrend to trade ever. No bounces or upward wicks to scare me out of my short position from 8,450. I hope the way back up is this pleasant.
[deleted]
In retrospect, I should've closed my scalp long by now.  Looks like the bounce just had a lot less steam than I expected.  I think there's a chance we'll get another small bump here while the RSI continues to reset, but I'm not holding my breath.  Probably gonna close for lunch money.
"Inflation [of the Peso] has failed to slow this year and remains near 25 percent, above the bank‚Äôs target of 15 percent."

Jesus christ. My condolences to the Argentinians.

The thought of no viable alternative is an ugly one.
I can't believe the amount of comments in here about opening longs.

As somebody who has been seriously burned by perpetual failed knife-catching attempts in the past.... stop it!

At least wait for some kind of a sign that this is turning around rather than trying to predict the bounce before it happens. Anyone expecting a sudden BGD is going to be disappointed imho. Zoom out of the 15m graph and look at the daily. This shit is rekt. I wouldn't be completely shocked to see us go below 7k today. 
How is everyone doing? 
That was probably the most unconvincing little dump I've ever seen, like my cat when he's constipated but wants to show me that everything's alright by taking his post-breakfast litter box detour. He's like, "I'm OK, everybody! I am still in rhythm." And we're all like, "Yeah, thanks for making the effort, Felix."
There's a very strong likelihood that we're not dropping past the last higher low of 6500. I'd wager we dont even fall past 7000. If you believe that, nows the time to start  buying in increments on dips and positioning yourself for the recovery which has taken place EVERY single time from these levels.
I can‚Äôt believe people can see anything other than another leg down here.

Three taps at 7650 rejected on low volume in a downtrend. Looks like an RSI cool off to me.
20 years from now on, i can say i was here, @ the battle of 7.8k!
Just noticed the funding is almost gone on bitfinex. Only 6 million left under 0.075. Someone just added thousand btc to a long as well, basically this bounce was all one guy. Not reassuring for sure.   
I added to my short   
Edit: 4 million left!!!!!!111 loooooooool no bounce 
I believe we are a ~ week away from the sadness market, I'm a perma bull and I'm sad so it's soon. I'm confused how without a repeat of mtgox sized fruad, and with the ln launched and extanages hair cuts dropping from safer practices, but I'm making the call anyway. I want to say 7k will be the 200. 10k in early fall/late summer. 14k next year. I'm going to start swing trading on every move up from now on.

Time to get a job and set up whatever is the new bitpay. The fomo and doubling in price every 3 months is at least a year away in my mind and there's a chance of a 4 year cycle from the halvening and it will be staight up 2 years and no major moves happen until we are a year away from the halvening from miners shifting from investment into profit.
So we are basically looking at a giant dead cat bounce since April 12th?
Hardly any blood in the streets. This dump hasn't even began in regards to %. Wait til those longs start to liquidate. 

Fully in fiat for the first time since 2014. I'll start to scale in if 7k holds WITH volume.

Good luck yall, this market is going to get brutal for both sides.
I'm back into short position at avg 7930 after a quick long when we bounced. I feel like its primed to dump again here. Weak buying, still lots of longs open, sentiment getting worse. I don't really see many compelling reasons for price to rise much higher from here before it goes down
I'm entering a long here according to my plan which I mentioned [in my previous comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ikz1u/daily_discussion_friday_may_11_2018/dytmrf5). I did go long at 8.2 as well and [closed](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ito6f/daily_discussion_saturday_may_12_2018/dyuugfh/?context=3) it out when the bounce didn't look good. I plan to do the same here.

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/78jlzqxx/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/78jlzqxx/)

Here's my reasoning for entering a long now, this is a drop of 15&#37; since macd crossed down which is in line with previous macd crossovers. We reached the .618 retracement and the expected 7.8k support. While 7.8k held on gdax and stamp, finex bounced off .618. I'm placing my stops at 7800 and 7750.  


Edit: Stops hit
Alot of dojis on the 1h, rsi still oversold up to the 4h, bull div on the 1h, i will try a long here from 7850. Stops under 7750 in case there is another wick under 7800.

Edit: closed for a tuna sandwich profit and switched to 100% hedge short. Looking too shaky for me, might jist be a textbook bearflag playing out.
What the fuck.... My buys from sub$7,800 all got filled just now but now I‚Äôm afraid.
A huuuuuge amount of ...200 longs... finally closed on that dump. This is denial.
Guys... Guys... I shorted today at 7943 at 23x :0
Well at least the volume is back :))
The amount of longs have been rising during this dump from 9.9K. the bulls just doesnt give up and are adding to their longs. This doesnt make much sense as the amount of shorts havent really increased much at all. 
Best fit lines created with VWMA 100 and 200-period death and golden crosses.

.786 retrace on last bear market would correlate to sub 3000 prices for this bear market.

Still holding my long under the belief this thing is going to bounce harder than a cheque I wrote when I was 17.

Albeit nervously.

Edit to add I'm catching a 2 hour flight shortly as well. Maybe I should add some stops.
There seems to be a few layers of support here:

- Golden Ratio Fib line from our swing to 9990 (low end of yellow highlighted area)

- A trend line from a weekly swing low from last year (2980, Purple dotted line). That passes through our prior weekly swing low (6425). You can see on the chart that previous one of these lines (black dotted) acted as support on our last bounce on the daily. 

- We seem to have found the bottom of a declining wedge. (line with breaks)

- ETH is also slumped over it's 50 DMA. So hopefully it will stop pulling us down for now...

Other bits: 15 min MACD just crossed, oversold up to the 6 hour and bullish divergence everywhere.

Chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/mIbQCfe0/

Disclaimer: In a slightly underwater long. I want out of this position.
We are on the same oversold RSI levels that when BTC value was 200$.  (Week chart). Be careful my friends with your shorts games.
The differential between longs and shorts undermines any bounce potential. I guess only reason we are not going further down is the RSI.
Waiting for the 10 and 30 EMA to catch up on the 4hr before I do anything.

Break below 6800~ would be ugly. Don't believe it'll happen, but something to watch. My bet is on a bounce in that range, or around 7000. I'll be accumulating. Happy trading ya'll.

Sooo...what are you guys looking at in terms of possible areas of support.  

I've got the the log support line from Sept through $6k currently sitting around $6840, and the 365 day MA that we haven't been below in a little over two years is at $7300-ish.

Anything I'm missing?
Nothing but air down to $7400 at least.
Does anyone take stock (aha.) of the RSI on the weekly chart, or is it largely ignored now?

It hasn't been -30 oversold since January 2015

*EDIT for clarity, it's at 45 right now. Lots of room to move down.
So when does this latest d-bag cover? That's the billion-dollar question.  I'm guessing either Friday or Monday. 

(That is not a low-effort comment!) This was clearly a big fella dumping for no discernible reason other than to get his rocks off by driving the price down a few hundred bucks for a couple days.  It was not panic. I asked my whole phone tree. Nobody sold.  Nobody's panicking.  Some of us bought.
For those who like the Ichimoku (20/30/60/120 settings), I wouldn't be suprised to see a relief rally (if btc has any life left lol) to the daily kijun at about 8210 before heading lower. By the way the hourly kijun is also at this level right now, and I have been watching that for shorting opportunities lately

peace and good luck
This looks so much we will not see 10k soon again and the outbreak of the pennant is downwards! 
OK, I call first signs of panic now. This thread is the best for crypto and has usually a lot of good long comments but when it's several oneliners per min, its a good indicator. 7200 next maybe then bounce
Capitulation will happen. It always happens. The mega down-trend wedge we've seen since $20K closes off with its bottom support levels around July 1st. There's still some time to make some small plays, but moving into the first week of June I'm going to move entirely to the sidelines.
BTC bounced from the 1D lower BBand and ETH is hitting resistance of the 1D Ichimoku Cloud.
This should provide some temporary relief, although that means RSI will cool off.

Will close my short here and will re-open lower if this keeps dropping
i'm longing 7.3 https://www.tradingview.com/x/7ubXZPhc/
7.2 won't happen imo. Let's see if this plays out
PSA: For anyone who got the ban hammer for making a low effort comment \(like myself\), you can politely ask u/jarederaj to lift the ban and he will most likely comply
I can't find a time when the 4hr RSI reached this level and wasn't followed up by a good 15-20% rally. 
Got to say this sub is so much better during a bear market.  Most every post is about actual trading.

You are seeing very, very few posts like  

 "$3000 by July!   No doubts!"        

"We will never be above $8000 again...ever!"      

"The best tiime to short BTC was 6 months ago.  The 2nd best time is NOW !!!!".

I wonder if all those cultist hodlers have already sold above $15K or if they are curled up in a ball in the corner, muttering to themselves so they are away from the keyboard.  

Anyway I'm glad that is back to being a trading sub, and somehow must suspect it will remain this way for quite a long time.




I‚Äôm full on bearish again. If we break support line of symmetrical triangle, [we‚Äôll see $3,500](https://twitter.com/peterlbrandt/status/999347137321172992?s=21) according to Peter.

Edit: I‚Äôve built up a fair amount of Karma by maintaining (reluctantly) a neutral outlook since BGD, so go ahead and downvote me bulls.
Added to my short from my post here: [Post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8lggj8/comment/dzfefr4?st=JHJ6BO8A&sh=be042a10) 

One of my ordered filled at $7949 and now short from the mid $8200‚Äôs and $7949. We have a bunch of resistance ahead. 

The bulls managed to break through the descending channel resistance line that was being lil bitch all night, where it seems to be acting as support (for now)

https://www.tradingview.com/x/8GhzYcuW/

Luckily for the bears, you can just slowly bleed down a descending support line. Pretty good R/R, I‚Äôll bail over $8000 or re evaluate when we get there. 

I had to opportunity to close the short for a nice scalp/profit in the high $7700‚Äôs, but I was asleep. 
Today I once more saw FUD in the newspaper saying that Bitcoin should have been banned. I laughed.  All that click bait circling out there just as bitcoin price goes down while when it was mooning the same newspaper said buy bitcoin and how to buy. The irony of it all.

Also added some corns to the short

!short btcusd 7780 add X1
I expected some pretty strong support in the 7,800 area, but there is none whatsoever. If 10k was only a DCB we'll be seeing $6k within a week.

Where my bulls at??

!long XBTUSD profit 7578 50% 
**!long BTCUSD 7,567 1X 100\%**

I'm not confident in this trade at all so follow me at your peril.  I just think we've sort of stabilized here \(at least for now\) and with the weekend approaching we may see a bump Thursday\-Saturday.  I'll reassess at that point.

Setting a fairly tight stop just in case this tanks further.
Going long now, iniate the golden bullrun
I am still betting this bounce is the real deal and will add to my long at about 7540 if it dips down that far, before heading higher.

That would be about 50% fib from the mini bounce so far.
Switching flair back to Bullish. This correction from 9.9k has been substantial, and I don't think we will drop below the 6.8-7.4 range. I have placed my bets, and rebought my alts. I don't think we will go far below 7.4 (if at all). If we do, I'm hunkering down. On the short side, the plays have already been capitalized on. Time to go long for me. 
I‚Äôm not worried, we are just setting up for a great June 
Just bounced (temporarily?) on the .5 fib...could be an ABC correction ending at around 7770...I am not by any means an Elliot Wave guy but just a thought

Edit : It's funny that i am not even considering going long here even if it plays out like this...just don't want to be long, period.peace
Well we have formed an **Trend Reversal Ascending Triangle** on the 15 minute 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/VtoKKBt4/

A break above it would put us in the 7700-7800 range if there bulls can pull through, where a short would be a fantastic R/R.

Or you can just short the top of the triangle and close at the bottom which has been pretty profitable for scalps all day 

**Edit** A Ascending Triangle in a downtrend is a bullish reversal  pattern, unlike an uptrend where it‚Äôs a continuation pattern. So for those being a dick/down-voting me, read before you start attempting to roast me 
Opend a moderate long here, RSIs might be too oversold to go lower and we reached this line again: [https://imgur.com/a/Le1elVu](https://imgur.com/a/Le1elVu)

\(\+I see 3 hammers in a row on the 1h chart\)
So, the big question is if 7800 is the new 6800 or not here I think. If organic buying picks up this might be a good entry. But the volume and action is so low, I do not think it is for now, mid term horizontal support is 7500-600 range for me


and remember the bad news post yesterday (https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8l74h5/daily_discussion_tuesday_may_22_2018/dzew1bw/) ? The old classic 4h ma crossing did not lie :D https://www.tradingview.com/x/QxBMXxxW

Coincides with the 'wedge' and a high(ish) volume node so putting my orders there
do not margin long this unless you know what you are doing.   
margin longs are sky high and they have no funding. any bounce from 6.9-7.4k will 100% be a dcb   
longs must be dying to get out on any bounce

Weak bounce into early US hours doesn‚Äôt bode well. Thinking we‚Äôll test the weekly 50 ma for real, doubt it will hold. Below 7750 and its game over i think
Crypto gods where art thou
Smart money is buying here. Believe it or not, I know this because there's a 200 btc bid on QuadrigaCX. When Canadians are buying like that, well, Canada = smart money. Same shit in the last few crashes. They load the fuck up when theres blood on the street, and this late into the bubble phase this is as bloody as it can get.

I agree that the amount of longs is bearish, but I don't think they will capitulate as long as it stays over 7k, and I don't think we'll get that low (soon). 

Not biased. I just closed my 8480 long at 8650

EDIT: Noob perma bears downvoting me. It's funny because I was getting downvoted by permabulls when I told people smart money is selling here (above 11k)
You can't do it bears!!! You don't have the power!
So we are watching the movie "The herd" featuring many Crypto Sheep, selling their investments in fear of the big bad Wolf, who will eat them. Pathetic.
The February low was 6000 and happened really fast. Then came several lows around 6500 in April. I am bullish and I think the next low will be in the next week or two around 7000 and we will keep slowly going up from there with higher lows until it spikes up over the ATH and we get another crash.
Definitely oversold at this point. Time to consolidate and move up
Any bulls left in this new bullmarket? Don't be sad!

Soo, what happens on a triple bottom over a six month time scale?
[removed]
Is it a wholely silly consideration to think that 5800 \> 6500 \> 7200 is on the cards?

Only concern being lower and lower highs until we have a monotenous horizontal chart for the next 18 months with 8k being the mean. \(next high might only be 9k\).

Miners will be appeased, bitcoin will be stable\(ish\) and TA be damned.
I'm expecting a few bounces before a new low of $5K, followed by another bounce before bleeding down to the actual bottom at $3K. It's hard for me to see it going under support at $3K, which is much stronger than all other support we've tested since December. Of course, even stronger support exists down at $1.2K. 

RemindMe! 6 Months 
What program do you guys use to day trade?
prediction: we keep dumping until AROUND june 5th and then a big green dildo of $1000 up in 1 hour with 3000+ btc volume.
Another shakeout. Obviously it's needed. But it's not fun...
30% in tether at 7800. Contemplating where to buy back in. Patience will be key here. I don‚Äôt want to get too greedy, thinking 7300. That BGD is definitely still in mine and I‚Äôm sure a lot of other people‚Äôs minds though haha Are there any decent supports until 7200? I‚Äôve seen a few Comments that think we‚Äôll bounce off of 7500. 
So, we're reaching the absolute lowest resistance point in my charts. What will happen, if we break it?

https://i.imgur.com/7X8903o.png

Right now, i'm pretty sure longing anywhere in 7k range is the crowded trade which will get rejected. I reject my former analysis, and will long the breakdown of 7k immediately. 
This uhh... might not be the best moment to point this out but, 

we have a pretty clear **unconfirmed** bullish div on the hourly.

We seem to be forming a tiny bull flag...

Retest of $10,000 by midnight, i'm calling it now
Damnit I don't want to sleep; I'm holding 1/2 in paper which is horrifying but the reason I took that position isn't over yet and a solid 2/3rds of this thread is bear for different reasons
Figured we'd have had that little bounce by now but nothing so far. 

Obviously a lot of people out there are in that no-mans land. Too fearful to go short, too afraid to go long. 

Should we break with conviction under 7800 soon, for me that's break under 7700, then I think we'll get the next leg down. 

Still, figured we'd have had an attempt to get back to 8000 before that happens. Maybe it will happen this afternoon but Bitcoin, she seems a bit shy at the moment. 

Hopefully soon we'll get that good ol flash of the panties and some movement will return either way.
Can anyone point me to a nice SHORTS VS LONGS chart that also shows the price of BTC on it please?
Hey guys how do I copy part of a fractal pattern in trading view to overlay it with another fractal?
I have a 0.18BTC, 25x short from 7932 and wan't to add 0.2BTC to my position if we go below 7750. Can anyone please explain to me how to do this in an easy and safe way?  
I will move my stops tight, but I'm unsure how I actually add to gain more and not just to add leverage.
What happens if I raise to 50x?


Edit: on Bitmex  
Edit 2: I took my exit @7907 and opened a 10x short with more means also @7907. Stop @7951. Thank you all for your replies. 
Can someone explain longs and shorts? I see the current price and we are no where close to most of the prices mentioned about the longs and shorts
Can someone explain to me in layman's terms what the relationships is between price movements in BTC and ETH? I've heard bits and pieces, but would appreciate a fuller understanding of how they move. (Someone mentioned once "triangulation bots".. WTF?)
Yea it is and it isn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs real utility would be aiding bitcoins LN as the two can technically share transfer routes. This could help bitcoin scale out globally as BTC isn‚Äôt inherently designed to accommodate the worlds pop. Long ways out though, nonetheless exciting and could be something special.
buy orders set..6.9 - 7.2..been patient and almost fomo last week.. 
Hoped to do a quick scalp, selling back some BTC @ 6763.60 ‚Ç¨. Since then it hit 6763.52 before jumping over the cliff.

You win some, you loose some...
what is the saves place to store fiat? I plan to get away from Bitfinex and just want to hold my fiat on an exchange \(or 2 or 3\). the less KYC they do, the better! no tether!
Who is foolish enough to buy BTC UP/DOWNS at BitMEX opening price? Only they can sell. Customers may only close their longs. Just look at the chart lol
Time to set up some limit buys at ridiculously low levels on various cryptos and exchanges!

I've played with the fire on BitRekt with leverage many times before in times like these, but this is not that time for me.

Omar coming for the crypto market...
any theories on why this is happening? I was expecting a dump but not a *dump*
Staying in the 7's for a while might not be a bad thing. This is the range we always blast right through on the way up and the way down without establishing any support/resistance.

Closed this short now but i feel like this could go further down but seeing the RSI is oversold on the mid to lower timeframes just screams for a bounce. Also we are currently at the edge of the lower BB. Will now wait and see if this shit bounces or keeps falling before entering a new short.

Thinking of reopening a long at 7355
[deleted]
I dont see us reaching 10k for a long long time if ever. No followup after pumps, any movement is instantly rejected, alts dump when btc is sideways, they dump even harder when btc dumps, noone is actually buying the dip except gamblers(no volume at all). I am bearish for the first time.
The only wallets that even have enough coins to support a dump this big (estimating 25K BTC min over the past couple of days) are exchanges themselves.  https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html Those are also the only big wallets that show big movements in the past couple of weeks if you care to look into it. Take this private wallet accumulating: https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/1KAt6STtisWMMVo5XGdos9P7DBNNsFfjx7
vs 
Bittrex with four 5000-coin withdrawals over the past couple of weeks https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/16rCmCmbuWDhPjWTrpQGaU3EPdZF7MTdUk

A lot of this was borrowed and will need to be repaid. Look for the MOABGDs when that happens.  And move your coins off exchanges if you're accumulating.

[edit -- AND let me re-iterate: if $7.5K is the bottom of this dump, we're in for a nice ride up]
Institutional money entering the space was already priced in. This is how markets work. They were front run in Nov and Dec. I hate how people keep repeating the same mantra about how institutional money will propel crypto back to the new highs. It's just not going to happen and it doesn't work that way. 
Please no more dips, I don't have any fiat left.
This is relentless.   People will eventually give up trying to catch the bounces and just stay short, which will just accelerate the downtrend.

I lost so much from trying to catch bounces over the last several days.  I have mostly stayed short, but probably lost 3% of my funds, due to my alt coins getting decimated while I was trying to get 1 or 2% gain from a bounce.  Plus I just didn't short enough when I was loaded up.
https://twitter.com/PeterLBrandt/status/999347137321172992

Exited 40% of my long from 7500/6443 here @7597/6500. Bounce looks weak and shorter term time frames have gone from dead RSI to stage 4 cancer RSI which may be enough to continue trending downwards. Keeping tie other half just in case this is another one of these slow low volume climbs up to 7.8k.

Edit: Exited another 30% @7630/6537

Edit2: Exited the last remaining 30% a little below breakeven.
Just been reading about the triple bottom formation which is bullish. Please look at the 6 month chart. It's clear to see to me anyway. Could be wishful thinking. Thoughts?

Coinbase president on CNBC at 530est today. Wonder how the market will react depending on what is said. 
Coinbase Pro, JP morgan wanting their own blockchain, then amazon and google both wanting their own blockchain. No movement. All of this bullish news and nothing good happens. 

Some dumb FUD about ICOs being illegal in the US (which isnt news), and BTC takes a giant dump. This keeps happening since 10k

I think this is the first time I've been legitimately afraid crypto is never going to recover. No new blood. Nothing brings them in. Google trends for BTC are lower than 2014. 

Veterans, has it ever felt like this in the past? I've only been in crytpo for about a year, and I've never come close to feeling this hopeless.

My last limit stop was hit on my short.

Looking to reshort if the big descending wedge on the daily on the 1d breaks down, long if it breaks up or follow chewy if he enters a position before that. 
My tight stops were hit a while back. Exited my long, got into a hedge short. Will add to it later if we can't get above \~7950. As it stands, I'm still in the green unless this starts going over \~8300.

Went from \~8400 short to a small 7975 long for a nice profit which I DCAd down to \~7940. Bailed on that long at \~7875 and got into a hedge short. Will sleep better this way.

Just a shower thought.

I don't know which one is worse, trading BTC/USD on bull market or BTC/BTC on bear market...
The likely outcome I see here is longs will take any potential bounce to close out minimizing losses whilst the indicators reset, and shorts will take their chance to short any substantial bounce, which would bring back a balance between the two over the next couple of days while we oscillate some more in this range. 

Due to the high volume in our latest dump I think we can expect a retrace of 5% max (assuming all attempts at break through 7600 [support -> resistance] don't get sold into immediately) after which we'll have to see what the balance is again between the bulls and the bears.

We should definitely see a higher low within the next 24 hours if we dont take the expressway to goblin town (with everything so oversold, I don't think it's likely) 
Would I be crazy to reopen a long here?

About 130 million dollars net cash is flowing into the crypto markets per day.  Short sellers are fools here.  Any downward movement and these idiots are in here talking about "falling knives" etc.  Or "wait for the trend to reverse before going long".

Which is all stupid advice.  It's a way to try to encourage a herd mentality so that no one buys.  The problem for them is that day traders are not the entire market.

The amount of money coming into the market is huge.  They are running out of time and are trying to kick the legs out from under the market.  It's not going to work for them much longer.

Buy everything you can here.  
re MtGox dumps.. My understanding is they are pretty much over now and for the remaining 100k coins are most likely to be distributed back to claimants as BTC under Civil Rehabilitation \(restructuring bankruptcy\) in the near future \(later this year\) if it is approved.  Can anybody corroborate this?  I did a quick and dirty poll of Gox recip and found around 2/3rds of them plan on moving btc to their cold wallets while 1/3rd said they would sell some of it and keep the rest in btc.
There's no hope for bulls left. Too many longs and increasing closing shorts means there will be little fuel for a (short squeeze) pump, thus price will not recover anytime soon.

Bitcoin will be $3k before $10k. Capitulation is near, conference didn't do anything positive price wise, and bulls have been consistently wrong for half a year. Next major pump will be in 1.5 / 2 years, until that time, DUMP.
!long XBTUSD 7428 100X 100%
As predicted, we dropped to $7.8k. Luckily for bulls, it has recovered ad didn't convincingly drop below it. If it did, the next target would have been $6.3k. Our data indicates that there won't be a retest of this bottom and that an "epic" bull run is on the horizon. We expect the price to have recovered in the high 8k's, possibly lower 9k's, by the end of this week. Opening a leveraged long here.

Edit: To answer a recurring question:

We decided to refer to myusernameiforgot in plural form as we believe singular form doesn't convey our greatness satisfactory.

Gone are the days when Dumpy the Bearwhale could drive the price down 10 percent in one day.  Looks like he only has about 300 more coins to dump on GDAX.  Maybe one more down day. Or not. Maybe Pumpy the Bullwhale buys him out.  Doesn't matter.  Bull market fully intact.

Time to think about covering, Dumpy!
lets assume we expand the 3d bband to the downside: [https://imgur.com/a/O3Ih0tH](https://imgur.com/a/O3Ih0tH) this is log scale, 4k is def. on the table an realistic scenario.

Time to go long compadres.
Accoring to the volume, at relativly stable prices for the last 2 hours, I assume there's a *lot* of demand here.

Hopefully the bears run out of steam now...
Here we go..up up and away...

I've got to say I will start to scale back into a short though above $7700 if we get there..although depends on how we get there, I suppose.
When will people in this sub start to realise that trading futures on bitmex only loses you money in the long run? We have 5 bil volume for BTC and 3 bil volume for XBT... 
BTC is holding up well.  We must not forget that for most of its existence, BTC has been worth a tiny fraction of where it stands today.
Myusernameiforgot was 100 percent on the money, APOLOGIZE!

Who thinks 2k per bitcoin is going to happen?

Ignore the green candles and direct your attention to the left. We're done ... cooked like a turkey.
It‚Äôs times like these when I like to flip the charts and just set stops for a bounce to the previous supposed on the 4H chart. It helps to prevent knife catching, and while you don‚Äôt get the very bottom of the dip, you never have to worry about the price running away from you. Fake outs excluded, of course. 

Edit: I should mention that I don‚Äôt margin trade, and am currently all cash. 
Let me guess. Bitcoin futures expiring soon.

As we predicted earlier, $7.8k broke and our next target is $6.3k. We expect this target to also break down, which puts our expectations for mid-term BTC price at $3k. We are short and mid-term bearish on bitcoin. We expect the price for all cryptocurrencies to trend downwards for the remainder of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019. A recovery is expected in April 2019, with the previous ATH being broken in September 2019. Those who are long, or even leveraged long, should reconsider - because the price will only go southways from here. This truly doesn't look good for bulls!!


**3 Rules for Trading:**

1. Stop reading and listening to Nassim Taleb. This guy is a pop-sci hack and his work has been widely refuted by actual academics. The few legitimate ideas put forward in his books are over-simplified platitudes. Lots of people across the crypto-sphere (less so here) seem to have bought heavily into this personality cult and it's likely destructive to their decision-making. This guy dismisses stats and math in favor of his own conjecture on subjects he's not all that qualified to speak on. Buyer beware. 

2. Don't forget that going long 100x against your BTC is actually long 200x. 

3. Remember that an alt today is worth much less than a dollar tomorrow. 
These threads have turned into a BitMex shilling forum.  Mods should ban anyone trading on that site.

If this misses my limit order at $7499, I'm gonna be pissed.  Dumpy the chump. What a tease.  Thought I was gonna get more cheap money.
Finally a downside BART after several days of waiting! Is this whale or whatever protecting his long over now ? :D
Longing this is more risky than having longed at 6k a while ago. This will break down feriously very soon.
Is it possible that some of the selloff is due to the worries about the "crackdown" and the markets coming around to process some of this information? (http://www.nasaa.org/45121/state-and-provincial-securities-regulators-conduct-coordinated-international-crypto-crackdown-2/)


Tether has returned to 1:1 with 150k buying at that price, this is a break down of my doom prediction, maybe its a temporary return its like 15 minutes old. But Selling half of the half I had in toilet paper at market price and putting in greedy market orders for the rest for a profit. 5 am sounds like a good time to take profits and get some sleep no?

edit// actually fuck paper, it's all going
They have knowledge I‚Äôm seeking though. I can deal with the gloating, I‚Äôm just trying to keep my mistakes to a minimum. 
so, I know the technical reasons for the selloff. What's the retail story though? Coinsensus selloff?
What if btc goes to 2.5k network wise? (then the crowds will cheer if it hits 5k again talking about how risen by 100%)  Is there any impact?
I don't see any impact on transactions, if anything lower price point might mean less interest and we could stay in the 1sat/byte for comfortably, right? 
If so, aside from store of value, there is no reason that demand couldn't temporarily be depressed and we see 2k or 3k till the end of 2018?

I don't want to be the cliche in here that when btc falls everyone calls for new lows but just curious.
Wicked down to $7401 on Bitfinex...could be painting the tape for the reversal.

You see this often with local tops and bottoms.
Interesting that yesterday someone sold one million tethers for ~$.99 each. We have to go back almost two weeks to find an individual transaction of that amount. 
Seeing as the bitcoin price moves in waves, with each crest and trough roughly proportional, this price action was completely predictable, especially when looking at the weekly candles. 
Calling a reversal trend at 7k$ the 06/06, every reversals happened the 6th of the month, and 7k just matches the support trendline we had for a while
Another great short entry, thanks bulltards
Bitcoin's feels like its always been a 7 coin.. feels like its worth 7000-7999$.  Was definitely overvalued as an 8 coin and undervalued as a 6 coin.


Am I the only one who noticed that a lot of this has to do with shaking off bitcoin cash's attempt to overtake bitcoin? BCH was nearly .2 btc a few weeks back. Now it's lower. 
This is not organic buying and selling it is being manipulated CBOE , bankers etc.Every bounce is being pounded on immediately. They are desperate to 'tame' bitcoin as GS has said they would do.

 edit. go ahead and dvote me ..boot lickers
[deleted]
the buying pressure with a 5 in the price will be insane.  if by some magical reason it gets down to a 4 in front the buying pressure will probably shoot the price back to 7k in like an hour
Fuck the fat finger market buy order on Kraken.
Edit: 280+ BTC market buy order with a <400‚Ç¨ spike upwards. Lot of shorts were rekt by SL although being in huge profit.
Really hope this goes down to hell and that position gets liquidated in maximum pain. F F F F F F
I think I love you.
Human here. I trade on GDAX. Yes, there are bots galore, but it's we humans who put our finger on the scale and tip it toward the green or red side. PS, wish I had another upvote.
Replying to this post so I can read it later. Very cool analysis!
Can you explain how you got the data to do this analysis? It‚Äôs really nice 
Awesome analysis. I don‚Äôt really understand charts but I saved it for tomorrow. Really cool methodology to analyse the order books this way!
So amazing. Is there a general name for this heuristic? Going to try to prototype a poor man's version this weekend \(it looks the devil's in the details in the bucketing/linking logic...\)

\(I swear, every time you post, I'm in for hours of Googling for more information and it's a deep deep spiral. :\) I guess the wisdom here is, is, people YOLO'ing their BTC manually in the web UI are mostly wading in dark waters with minimal information.\)
Right there with you man. Long 2x 50% stack. The lack of any bounce is absurd. Good luck to us. 
the reverse of the an upwards dip
God damnit. Not sure what to do about this one.
Some large players use liquidation as a stop loss to avoid slippage. This is a bad example, since there's plenty of liquidity on the orderbook to handle a 308,540 contract stop loss. But for higher values it can work in their favor.

For example:

You want to short 2,000,000 contracts at $8,500 but want to exit the position at $8,600 if you're wrong. 

If you open a 10x position, when your stops execute at $8,600 it's possible you could lose an additional 1%+ to slippage. Since the orderbook could be so thin that there simply aren't 2,000,000 contracts on the orderbook between $8,600 and $8,700. So the bulk of your order might execute at $8,750 or something. 

Instead, you open a 2,000,000 short at 50x that will liquidate you roughly at $8,600. Which is roughly the equivalent of opening a 2,000,000 short position with a stop loss that executes and fills at around $8,640. 
Overleveraged bottomshorter.
I have it reaching about 6990 by June 6 then continuing up from there. At some point I would think there will be a catalyst to break out of the wedge.

I've read that these formation tend to break up about 70&#37; of the time.
The triangle isn't the issue. What is happening overall:

The bubble is deflating. There will be bull traps along the way, as more people are shook out and the reality of limited upside sinks in each trap suckers in fewer people.

The only reason for people to buy is because they think it is close to a bottom (or they think other people think it is close to a bottom, yes, effect is the same). Given the extreme imbalance of fiat to btc at current prices this means no one can win (cash out) unless the price keeps falling
If we broke down convincingly (not some low volume break) and stayed under then we're definitely heading downwards quite a way 

The triangle comes after a precipitous drop. 35%. so it'd be a continuation pattern 

and by definitely I mean probably. Nothing is 100% 

but going below $6k isn't nearly as big a deal as people think. of we're above $3k by end of 2018 we're doing great lol 
Right now it is consolidation following correction after the parabolic swing up.
I think: That is quite a long period for this triangle to play out. Anything \(FUD/FOMO\) can happen in this time\-frame.
I didn't break up on May 6 under higher volume so why would it bounce off the bottom now to break out?
GDAX is absolute garbage. I hate how entrenched Coinbase is with their first mover advantage; their product offerings are terrible and their CEO has no vision.
At some point recently they did an update that made it worse. I remember I could leave the screen and come back to it after a while and it was working. Now when left in the background, it kind of just desyncs and breaks and I have to hit refresh.
I've noticed that also, I'm guessing it's the lower liquidity on the books, the spread gets quite wide at times.
Yes I think the similarities to 2014 are quite amazing.  We'll see if this next movement matches up with what happened back then.  If it keeps following the 2014 path, then we can expect a low of around 20% ATH, which would be somewhere around $4K. 
dude you can't just come and serve the bulls such hopium, they will fomo every bounce :(
But...but...this must be coincidence, because "2018 is nothing like 2014".  The ecosystem is different and the world is different, blah, blah...

Thanks for reminding us how similar it is to 2014 and that was likely to be true the first moment it dropped below $19500.
Sweet mother, that pump in June. My body is ready. 
Nice analysis. Although "past performance does not..." etc.
>Even more interesting, and some possible hopium \(!\), they went on to 60&#37; of ATH after this.

I wouldn't call an opportunity to repeat the worst bull trap in bitcoin history "hopium", but maybe that's just me.

Nice post!
Yup, we still have delusional people in the building, give it another week or so
It may follow initial 2014 cool down graph from ATH, but I doubt it will follow a year long downtrend. It IS a different market now.
Some people are shorting this...
I lold
Lol bro, I'm starting to be convinced by your trading chops.
We only dropped 10% in 2 days...
Good thing I'm a pimp then. 
I have the last three month in a spreadsheet and the MAX range on a negative day is 17%. Max loss open to close is -10.7%.
Why the FUCK did you go 25x long with 10% of your stack in margin...

10% of your stack is supposed to be your trading stack... you just lost your trading stack.

Stop trading
Pigs get slaughtered. Don't touch 25x lev.

One thing I have learned in my painful career as a gambler is that bragging when you get lucky and win a few games will plunge you into gloom and unacceptable beatings very soon. It happens every time. -HT

Liquor, ladies and leverage.
:( 
REKT IN PIECES 
This made my b-hole tingle a little bit
Hmmm, not sold yet. Can you repeat that last part with a "Master Wayne" at the end? Alfred also makes me feel better.
It works like 90% of the time 
Still there is more longs opened than shorts :\)
The bottom isn't in until shorts pay funding on Bitmex.
Hm. I think this sub is pretty balanced at the moment...
The disbelief is strong though. This should bounce back up to $7,800 at some point in the immediate future. Will probably hop back above it for a few minutes. 
Yeah this is falling knife territory, I'm excited for the fireworks of the long squeeze, even though I'm still long. 

Edit: how are longs still not closing? The ratio just keeps increasing. This is starting to feel like early feb where we spiked down hard into 6k. 
I agree, this does seem possible.
the sub is full of 100x bitmexers making bets on the next 2% move.  Thats what bitcoin is now.


There are a few names that have been around for quite some time but you'll see many more that join and fizzle out after a month or two of leveraged gambling. The sensible ones are still here in the background.
I think it's okay to do if you have a risk profile set up for it. For example have a hard line in the sand where you don't let yourself add money to your trading stack if you get liquidated. 

too many people don't have rules on how much they can add to their trading stack before they take a break.

In my case, back when I was just an idiot FOMOing in one way or the other, my trading stack got liquidated a while back and I had to add to it right before my big short. I told myself that if I got liquidated again I was going to simply wait until I saved up enough money to add more.

I think it's important to see trading as a really expensive hobby (if you're a bad trader) and only allow yourself a certain amount of money to spend on it for a while. Eventually you'll see gains but it might not be for a while for some people...
You know what is absolutely beyond hilarious about your comment?

**Let me remind you of what you said 3 days ago**

"I used to have a system, but now kinda wing it"

**And yet now you get on your pedestal and proclaim:**

"I am starting to realize that this sub is full of gamblers. Reading a bunch of stories about people who got hella liquidated... I mean, wow. I had no idea. I thought people in here were sensible with a good head on their shoulders."

I mean it doesn't get much funnier than that does it!
I feel like a bit of a gambler atm.  Started with a 5% *scalp* position at 8050.  Then DCA'd that into a 15% position in the next bear flag at 7975.  As of now I'm in for 30% as I just doubled down between between 7900 and 7800.

I now have 1/3 of my fiat on the line in a trade I wasn't even that sure on.  Was just a punt.  I stand to lose half the profits I made (if stopped out) from the short I closed to flip into the long. Damn should have just kept it open.
Nobody is going to listen to that advice, and if they do, when it's convenient to break it they'll think "huh, I guess I'm about the break the L14dy rule" and then break it anyway. 

There's a two step program to getting wealthy with BTC

1. Dedicate 5-10% (more if you've got the bravy-gravy) of your pay to buying BTC
2. Hold/Lend that BTC 


You do realize this sub is also full of people who's money you and I both are trying to take when we trade, right? 
Just wanted to say, I really really like the thoughts and analyses you are sharing here. They are often very original and give some fresh perspectives and new ideas to think about.

Having said that, I would not mind if the 2nd part of your projection would *not* replay that way. ;)
Nice spot! I will be very surprised if we won't get even a small bounce after so many days of bleeding!
I agree with you. we might see a little bounce but the selling pressure remains intact and if BTC falls below $7800, it can drop to the levels you mentioned. 
I feel like channeling Peter Brandt here and want to ask why there are so many lines, it isn't like this is a Mariners navigational map. I like the idea of the bounce, but that red line it is bouncing off is only anchored by the current price, it seems to me. 
After the buying pressure we had last week up to yesterday I thought we would see an actual bounce. Maybe test the downtrend line from 9K and probably confirm it once more as resistance. I still have 70% of my short at 10X and I'm itching to add before this breaks down again. I'm betting on a boring sideways day though.
Short is the way to be for the moment.  A long squeeze could happen at any moment.
Nice charts, nice analysis!
Triple bottoms aren't particularly common. This could actually be shaping up to be more of a descending triangle, which would be bad.  We broke the downtrend ATH line as you know, but our failure to make a higher high was a big defeat. Best case IMO is this is more of a big wedge than a triangle. The fact that our lows were 5800 (Feb) and 6400 (Apr) could translate into 7K (Jun). If that coincides with a test of the ATH downtrend line as support and we bounce off the bottom of our wedge there, things could start looking up. If we break back under the ATH line and the wedge support (both around the 7K mark), I don't see how we don't make lower lows.
Nice spot! Haven't seen that sup/res line referenced to Nov highs before.

And yep, you've got the support line down below right.  That's the one everyone is eyeing.

The only other one i have is the one we're resting on right now: https://www.tradingview.com/x/IcVBau1G/ (purple dotted line on chart)
I think that‚Äôs the same level everyone has been watching lately. It looks like we are forming a big descending triangle/bullish pennant on the weekly (depending on who you ask). I would at least expect a big bounce at that level, with this in mind.  However, if it continues to drop from there, things could get ugly fast.
That spot(7922) is support from 5/18(4hr) turned resistance.
I have the bottom of that pennant sitting at $6900
I thought so too. The buy zone for me was 7.4-7.6. I saw from your comments you are active in the Lisk sub, can you give me a few of your thoughts on the project? You seem to have more knowledge than the average project fanboy (meant as a complement, of course). 
what??? english dude!
On my chart we just broke below this triangle. Need to wait for the market reaction.  
Edit: and here it is one second later :\)  

I mean, a bounce here is really likely. I think it'll develop more into a bear flag over time on the 1h-4h taking more than 24h to play out. Wouldn't take any of it seriously unless we break 7800, then maybe a small reversal is at play here, but as you, I remain highly sceptical. 
I covered my short and opened a long in the mid 7500s (avg entry), but I'm still not convinced either.  This could just be another bear flag that ends with another plunge.

But I am betting it is the start of a proper short-term trend reversal.  Chart just says we are oversold on the shorter time frames.
Looks like a bear pennant to me 
I like it as a potential triangle...the price target would be exactly at the breakdown point at 788x
Whatever it is, we should see a move pretty soon. 

Declining volume suggests we‚Äôre in some type of formation. 

Edit: I'm leaning more towards a rising wedge.
Wow I haven't clicked this link but was just about to post my thinking.

Can/will this go lower... Sure quite likely. But again now for the THIRD time I am having to come out of the woodwork and explain that simple longs \(ultra low leverage to none\) and DCA on the way down is the answer.

The BTC protocol would have to fundamentally be destroyed for the coin to go to 0 so we can rule that out.

For it to go to 1100 it would have to be adopted by as many purist as it was in 2014 and no1 else believe in it.... We can rule that out as well.

So BTC's floor is 1100 let's call it minus a fundamental breaking of the protocol \(or massive regulatory hurdles, which we all know are over with in the USA at least\)

Now the next thought experiment we do a poll, "would you buy BTC at 1500, 2500, 3500, 4500, 5500, 6500, 7500?"

I see the biggest bears have "targets" at 3500. So the answer in this sub is 100&#37; buy at 3500.

In a simple manner that's what your liquidation should be at if you are margin trading then at worst.

From there you can simple assume the probabilities.

Let's assume the price is going down from here 7500. A 100&#37; sell \(which is a bearish af assumpion but let's assume the sentiment here is right\). The price is 100&#37; going to remain lower than 7500 where by selling is a good move.

Now it simply becomes 3500 \-  7500. Somewhere in this range is the correct buying point.

Internalize that, if you are short right now you are GOING to want to close within that range even by the more bearish estimates.

We haven't talked about BTC scarcity, we haven't talked about the diehard HODLers, we haven't talked about the fact that we are \-65&#37; off ATH, we haven't talked about miner economics or the countless investment in this space. We haven't talked about the smart ones who will want to buy back in when the price is right. We haven't talked about the fact that we rejected our first re\-test of 6000.

Given all that that means we are likely closer to 7500 than 3500 in the "perfect entry" battle.

So again dumb math not scientific or meant to be:

\[must buy\] 3500  \<\-\> 5500 \<\-\> 7500 \[must sell, assuming it is a must sell, I disagree\]

One would then assume the perfect buy is somewhere between this and 5500 \(coincidentally our other local low\). The 3500 number is just taken from the most sensible doomsday post in here .

What's my point? BTC may not do the moon thing to 20k we all want in the short term but is almost by all accounts a value buy at these numbers.

This is now the third time I'm ranting like this  in favor of the common sense long and re\-long method but whatever. If I am wrong and BTC dips below 3500 guess what I'm doing.... longing.

It feels scary because we are down but if you could remove yourself from the fear it is really basic logic. We have the cheat code we know we are way off of ATH.

Kinda like when ETH was at 180 after getting to 420. If you believe in the asset why would you short 180? What are you expecting?

Anyhow short away peple, BTC is dead etc.. etc...

I genuinely will keep buying on the way down and weirdly I would love the price to dip.
I‚Äôve never seen the NVT thing before. Very interesting actually. 
I ain't convinced either. 6k, 3k, it's all the same to the MM's in terms of ease in getting there. But one has a 2x multiplier on *all* future gains. No reason to not reach for it, other than to keep the hope alive. 
I consider myself new money and i am on the sidelines.  I really should just DCA, but i am looking to buy and hold long term and i am greedy.  So, here i sit.  I have some limit orders in just above 3.5.  they may never hit. if not, i will likely move the capital into traditional investments.  I really dont want to stomach a 50% hit buying in the 7k range.  I may lose, but at least i preserve my capital and dont have to ride it out under water for x amount of months/years.  What if it were to go to $1k ??  HA !!
Guess you forget the 1k green candle in an hour a few weeks ago. 
If we dump they will capitulate. This is what happened with the Soros Pump/BGD

But even if we don't, there doesn't need to be a long squeeze through liquidation- it's just that when the market seems to think it's got it all figured out lately it turns around. 

For example...the $400 premium on futures that appeared literally at the top of our last 50% run-up. Futures were hitting $10300-10400. At the *very* top of the top. That is dumb as fuck. And the $3,000 premium at $20k, the literal ATH.

clearly futures traders on mex are idiots because when the premium gets large the price turns around. When it gets to a heavy discount it pumps. 

40k shorts on finex at sub $7k. 15k closed in about 2 hours. 

Clearly the majority of margin/derivatives traders have 0 idea what they're doing, and when indicators signal that they appear *very* confident in themselves, we here all take a step back and say whoa, these guys are usually idiots. Should we really follow them?
Longs always tend to be in greater numbers than shorts.

You've got to be a different breed to maintain a short in a highly volatile, limitless upside market.
short alts against Bitcoin might be good idea. 
Could be a hoax, there was a similar situation with MIT working on LTC last year.
That conference was an utter failure and probably gave bears some great confidence.
shorts are just as sticky too when they are underwater
They seem to be starting to close now.

How do you get the volume nodes on the right in tradingview?
I got chopped the fuck up to the tune of about 7% of my trading stack in S/L‚Äôs and exchange fees the past 3 weeks...I‚Äôm with you brother.  I checked the price and it was sub 7400 and all I could think was 7200 right around the corner.  
Paradex is build on the 0x protocol. That explains the ZRX increase today. 

It is also going to be removing the GDAX brand and renaming the platform as Coinbase Pro.
I closed at 7725, but yeah... this one‚Äôs a bit of a genital wart if ya ask me

Don‚Äôt worry about it... you‚Äôll be fine
I have the same, any comment to how long it's feasible to hold on to that if we enter a sideways market next 3\-4 weeks? 
~10% drop because of FUD is classic Bitcoin. It's starting to feel like home again. I'll be in tears if that turns out that OKex withdrawal FUD did it again.
I had a BTC withdrawal yesterday that was never sent and was about to email them.
lol, I was with you until the short squeeze play at the end.  You think lightning will strike twice?  My guess is we'll be chopping around 7-8k for a long while until late summer.
This is the bounce that will push it to 36k:18k

Then guess what.
More people buying than selling at least on margin 3:2 ratio YET price keeps falling.

this game is rigged. Fundamentals are bullish and we are so undervalued its not funny.
So, more pain to come...
[deleted]
How about setting a stop loss and take profit on the same position?  That would be something actually useful...
Great, now I can zoom in and see all the gaps in the chart due to lack of volume. 

Edit: oh shit there's actually a try it out button. 
if you click to the "coinbase pro" thingy does one need to reregister (or can you re-use your gdax account)? What exactly happens? I didn't click it yet because I have many open orders (which I cannot cancel now).

If they did the job ok (for some reason I expect they did something wrong...), orders/funds would already be synchronized between two platforms[*] and you don't need to reregister. 

[*] Earlier today there was news coinbase acquired Paradex platform, so I am unsure whether the "Coinbase Pro" is just redesign/rebranding, or migration to a new platform
Aside from being able to scroll the chart and having a more polished looks (I guess?) it's exactly the same. 

You still can't do mark-ups or Indicators other than the default 12/26 EMA. Hardly deserves the 'Pro' moniker. 
can you?  I can get it to zoom in and out, but not scroll.
we have seen this cycle about 3-4 times now. btc pumps, alts pump harder, btc dumps, alts dump harder. i'd get out of alts until btc looks like it's done dumping then put it all back in (if you're a gambler)

at some point alts will capitulate and not pump again tho
If you have a diversified portfolio then the last week should be all the evidence you need. Alts were pumped up and never fully deflated. Get out with whatever profit you can while you can.
I also closed a scalp with almost no profit. Back to watching from the sidelines. 
the BGD short squeeze was a massive shot of PTSD for shorters
Thoughtful analysis - wanted to add that breaking up and out of a falling wedge, then BACK INTO IT again is incredibly bearish.  This kind of thing usually leads to breaking out downward, as that's clearly the direction of the market currently.  Could get real, real nasty.
According to MACD and RSI on 2-4 hr timeframes, it's starting to look really oversold. No worries about this, you think?
Are you going to add to this if $7800 breaks down?
Missed your entry. 
I have just a small short position from 7915. Would have added more margin if i knew you were also short. Lets see if it bounces a bit so i can add some margin.

Is there a reason you closed here? Seems like there's a little more thin air below.
Chewy get's to post like this because it's Chewy. It's not an example for everyone trading xbt on bitmex.
Do you still have all your cold storage boxed in with a short?
Damnit, shoulda went with my gut this time. 7500 felt so shaky.
I‚Äôm wondering if this resistance at 7600 will hold and I‚Äôm thinking of shorting here with lower leverage than usual.

then if the price rises to 7700, increase my position, and at 7800 increase again and then cut losses over 8000.

Do you think this is sound strategy, or am I asking to put myself uncomfortably underwater if I take this strategy? 
Your right on, many have been watching this also.
>If the current "channel"

Do you even triangle bro?
Well played.
Nice.
Profit is profit, well placed trade. Although I think we go down more. Eth H&S and BTC hitting new lows doesn't look good
What type of leverage do you use?
thanks for the laugh
You‚Äôre so funny
That's it, and let those little wimps try to pry that shit from my hands when it comes time to cover.
Just depends when you catch it. 50% would call a bull run and have a chart to prove it and 50% would call a bear run and also have a chart to prove it.
Dude, I did the same.
And the  guys who I had chosen to follow a few months back were flabbergasted why everyone was buying at 8300+ and were 99% sure the price will fall....

Maybe we find what we are looking for haha :D
Bring the pain, please!
epic gainz? We are down 10% the past 24 hours you insensitive fuck/s
Man I do NOT like swiss cheese either.  That stuff tastes like feet.  Not my fetish!
It's odd that I can't remember seeing a lot of posts removed during the bull market when people are sharing their excitement about their trading profits.
What alts in particular?
The difference though is that dropping below $7,800 pushed the market past the most significant (and last major) horizontal support zone between the start of the Big Green Candle and the top of the rally at $10K.

$7,800 was the only support zone that the market ever really bothered to confirm as such during the entirety of the rally. 

Now that it's fallen with relatively strong conviction, it should prevent the market from bouncing as significantly as you're suggesting. 

I could very well be wrong, but $7,800 should be the top for any bounce within the next few days.
Part of the problem with the last two bottoms is that we never got to the despair stage, and perhaps that is a necessary precursor before we can go back above 11.7k
I have resistances at 8050 so sl at 8.1 should be better.
and a hidden bearish div on the 30min
Need to wait 5 minutes to see the size of the pump. 
Added to my short although my stops will be very tight since I've already let too much profit slip away, was a high leverage play. Would probably cut if we break the 7930ish resistance and reshort if necessary. 
L14dy, couple of days ago: the value of btc is around 7.500USD. So you seem to be right, after all. Really sorry for your loss! Don't get tilted all too much from it, plenty of possibilities to make up for it! Go for a looong walk with your doge and get some fresh thoughts. 
Thanks man... back in March I noticed that $8k looked to be the center crossing for the coil we were forming.. [months later this turned out to be correct.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/gHOr04UE/)

For longer time frame trades I'm watching the pennant... a break below would suggest a $6k retest \(and likely lower\).. breaking above would have us on a path to revisiting the $11.7 \- $14k range.  I don't think the pennant will break for at least a month.
I don‚Äôt see why that triangle says it will break up. Symmetrical triangles are continuation patterns right? And since there was a drop preceding this, wouldn‚Äôt that mean it will continue the downtrend?
Same here, down about 7%, I was hoping for a bounce with 4h OS RSI but never came.  Gonna stop trading for a bit and get out of the market‚Äôs way.

Should have been better about my stops.
Tommorow? You mean in an hour? There are no buyers to be found yet 
Well, clearly when there's selling going in people aren't afraid to run for the exits. 

However, what I'd say is more meaningful is the decrease in volume on a larger timeframe in our successive dips. This means more weak hands have been shaken out and more people are holding. It could be due to the fact that we haven't hit critical pricepoints yet, and if we do get below our support at 6.9-7k we might see a big snowball effect, but so far it's still low and you could argue it's promising.
Hopefully it means more liquidity in the long term as large holders distribute some of their coins. Just means more pain for bagholders though, unfortunately.

"Lovallo and Kahneman argue, however, that most of these failures are actually the results of flawed decision making. When predicting the outcomes of risky projects, executives easily fall victim to what psychologists call the planning fallacy. They make decisions based on delusional optimism instead of on rational weighing of gains, losses and probabilities. They spin scenarios of success while overlooking potential problems. Consequently, they pursue initiatives that are unlikely to succeed. Research into human cognition has traced this over-optimism to many sources."
Not limited to bitmex. 32k longs on finex.  where I imagine at least a third is underwater....and they are adding
I'm honestly dumbstruck by the continuing futures premium. Just... come on guys. 
I'm just sitting here waiting for my free extra 1%. Maybe 7600? How can traders be bullish on a 5-week time frame right now? We just retraced all the gains we made during the previous 5 weeks. 
Do you have a target for the "bottom"?
Maybe it will come down if/when the BGD is wiped out. Until then, hopium is a hell of a drug.
What was really interesting two days ago was the premium on all the alt pairs on bitmex vanishing. I don't know what to make of that exactly, but it happened and it happened quick.
Explains why 0x/zrx is blowing up

Holy shit nice. Way to step up your game Coinbase
Nice then I might not be the only one on btc/eur anymore!
Can this 0x work with altcoins or only eth tokens?
If you're pricing the current market against the last bubble, you'll see $1,100 to sub-$200 is the same as $20,000 to sub-$4000 now, just over 80% drop.

And 4k is a very nice trendline to bump off of:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/CqvhRBTF/

But like the 2014 fall, it could take us another year to get there.

The diffference is that in 2014 a lot more coins were produced by miners per day than now. That is the parameter why I think it would **not** go as bad as 2014 \(also no MtGox scenario yet\).
That scenario would imply breaking the bottom log support trendline (currently ~6.9k my chart), setting a weekly lower low and devastating outlooks on the market until the Mt.Gox legal sessions are concluded in September. Hope not
I think you could be right, but the positive news bit is not valid. All we currently have is announcements of future announcements. If we're waiting on average Joes to be interested, we need announcements of actions and then a buffer period, e.g. for them to see it in action. 

To me it's like when Google makes an announcement about a project they're working on. I think "that will be cool if it plays out". I'm not rushing to buy more Google stock. I will forget about the announcement until I see the actions and the repercussions. 


It could play out like you say, but if the good news turns into actions this year I think we'll see a very different outcome 
We believe this assessment to be incorrect and are confident the bull trend will resume shortly. 
sell in may and go away
lol, gotta babysit your short?
Look at longs/shorts first time we hit 6k on a drop from ATH. They also opened on the way down to close after we bounced.

A lot of shorts can be squeezed but a lot of longs are in fact 1x position, they can wait out a lot.
Many shorts are closing for profit here.

But yes, would be more encouraging if was bouncing harder and already above $7600.
"Buy the dip" imho.
Longs close, new ones open. it doesn't mean they are the SAME longs holding since 9k.
Isn‚Äôt the long/short ratio similar to what we had before the drop from $8k today? So falling to $7.5k did nothing to the long/short ratio?!
It all seems too easy. I wasn't really reading this sub much before the BGD. Was it as obvious then? I know all the pieces of the puzzle were in place. 

I would expect shorts to close faster in event of a BGD then longs in event of a BRD, but maybe I'm looking at it the wrong way.
Where do you get the short and long numbers from?

You should've closed that when 8050 broke
Longs are notoriously difficult to shake out. Particularly in bitcoin. 

Max leverage on Bitfinex is 3.3x, I believe. But that's assuming somebody is 100%, all-in with their entire account balance.

Even if you longed the absolute top at $10K, the market is still only about 3/4 of the way to their liquidation point. They'd be boned at roughly $7,000. 

But they can always add to their position, or increase their account balance to prevent liquidation. 

Realistically, I don't think we're likely to see any significant liquidations until $4,000 to $5,000. And that's assuming the market even makes it down that far.
Sub 6k would lead to mass capitulation, I really doubt youll ever liquidate big finex longs.
As chewtoy said, longs are pretty hard to squeeze on BFX.

It's more a question of at what price point will they start giving up and stopping out, or how many have already turned bearish but are waiting for a bounce to close.
> RSI is at 19 and we dropped out of the bollinger bands   
   
That works well in an uptrend.
maybe now, maybe 200 USD lower, roll a dice
Yeah it can go lower but it's extremely low. The worrying sign is the lack of longs closing so far, meaning there will be more downward pressure on the horizon as they close out or get liquidated. 

We'll have to see if this will bounce at all...
day\-RSI is still not at the bottom. Long\-term it will go lower until we touch the line on the day\-chart
This is extremely interesting.

If the fractal plays out, expect 7200-7600 to be the range and maybe consolidate here... while shorts stack and we have another short squeeze for a BGD
I had the same thing in mind 2 weeks ago but price moved higher than I thought. 

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/NB09Sb85-Fractal-from-the-descent-to-6-5k/ 

But anyway I don't think the drop will stop here. This is no man's land, we had volume at 7800 and 7200, 7500 won't hold

I went long at 7520.  I am thinking the same thing about bounce to 7800 or so.  
One just happened on Finex down to $8401 and then immediate bounce higher.
Fundusa safu
Yeah, seems like it is acting up.
funds = safe
Sounds like a good plan. I‚Äôll be waiting for 6.9-7k for my limit orders. With similar stops as yours. Or a reversal pattern and bullish divergences that signal accumulation.
If this is playing out like 2014-2017, count me in. I don't care if the price goes down if it goes up a lot more in a couple years. BTC isn't a Christmas toy to be discarded, it's a pet puppy that sometimes poops on the carpet but it's worth it in the long run.
One interesting point at your first chart.   If I believe we are in a revisit of 2014-2015 Bitcoin bear market then the time axis for the peaks are compressed by about a factor of 2 in 2018 vs. 2014.   It took ~3 months for the first drop in 2018, 6 months for the first drop in 2014.   It also means our absolute bottom might be here in the next month or so (took 1 year in 2014, maybe will do it in 6 months in 2018).

Hence if we are in for a 2014-2015 repeat this may happen over a shorter time frame 12-18months vs. 24-36.
I‚Äôm sorry but I feel like the only people comparing this bear market to the 2014-2016 are those who weren‚Äôt in it then. The alt market, especially ETH never had an impact as it does now on Btc market. 
Remind me again how reliable an indicator past performance is of future performance...
There's a subset of users getting mad at me when I take action about this. Not sure who my master is. Maybe the sub can let me know how they want the rules enforced?

Current policy is : 

1. warn
2. 1 day ban
3. 7 day ban
4. 31 day ban
5. perma-ban

A very small subset of rule violators find themselves on a fast track.
Bullish.

I'll concede when you can only afford rice with ketchup. 
I love how you continue to post here even after they temp ban you over and over. it makes me laugh lol. 

Love your spirit, you are one of my favorite permabulls
As long as ice cream is involved I'm always bullish
thought you have no word "bear" in your dictionary.
[removed]
Exactly what I've been thinking through all of this.  Basically everyone left is in for the long haul.  Everyone that couldn't take the heat was knocked out over the last couple of months.  There simply aren't many left to panic sell which is what this guy/entity selling down the market is finding out.
I don't agree with you except the part where you imply this drop feels different. I went full fiat no coiner mode last night even though I am long term bullish and generally believe the common mantra "everything below 10K is just noise" The issue with me is how long do we stay below 10K and my own answer is a long time. Like you said hype is dying, Consensus didn't do anything, and gov't are doing some heavy handed regulating and bullish news for BTC has had no positive effect.

Everytime I open up my coinbase app to check BTC prices, it defaults to 1Y price comparison where we are still up $5K from this time last year. Maybe this is "wave 1" of the real shakeout. I hope I am wrong because I love everything about crypto.
I would not be surprised if we see 5k in a month. I will lock away my fiat so that it protects me from going long and doing stupid things. 
Someone's going to end up rage crying in their shower later. Poor BitMEX cowboy.
lol anyone that uses 100x deserves it
Yes when you have a very clear extended down trend, there can be huge gains.  I increased my Bitmex acct balance by about 1000% in the last few weeks.  I still lost money overall, due to my holdings, but just shows the power of good trading.
Worse mistakes have happened. Nice fat fingering!
Couldn't this break down just as much as up?
fundus are safu
same here, great timing...
https://www.reddit.com/r/BinanceExchange/comments/8libzl/binance_down/dzfqdyl/

Yep it‚Äôs part of the game. Ideally it‚Äôs a ‚Äò3 steps forward, 1 step back‚Äô type of thing. 
sell in beginning of may and go away! yes!
Sell in January come back in December. 
When it goes up again...
when the permabears here start going long(the ones who got downvoted last week for calling 7k, for example) and longs closing here  https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSDLONGS/
7200 there should an alamo-type stand. Not a bad idea to scale into a long from 7200-7000 and cut at 68xx
once you start seeing green.
You never know with 100% certainty.  But yes support lines help as well as volume and breaking resistance lines on the way up.  Also RSI, whatever that is.
From what I can tell, if price is flat or rising for 72 hours it's a good sign. Or if bitcoin is incredibly cheap (circa 5500 - 6000)
This realy looks like its going down a lot.. maybe with stops?
ETH can lead BTC on price movements, and heads up here in the past has led to people taking profitable positions prior to the BTC move. Personally, I appreciate ETH price movement heads up, particularly if it's a big move.
Wasn't really monster. The order book is just paper thin.
It‚Äôs seen it empty a handful of times. It‚Äôs pretty annoying.

But.. it can also save you from making some shitty trades 
which margin pool? the BTC (margin short) pool, or the EUR/USD (margin long) pool? 

I have never seen the first one empty, the latter is empty often.
Really? For me it's constantly used up. Maybe they have two pools, one for EUR one for USD.
For real?  I wonder what the implications are...
oh man. I can't wait to hear what you think about the dump tomorrow.
Can you expand on that thought a little?
this one actually got a laugh out of me

My favorite poster in this sub tbh
>as I love pain

As we all do! Otherwise we wouldn't be here. Good luck!

I hate pain, despite my ability to tolerate it beyond all known parameters, which is not necessarily a good thing. -HT

Really you should reduce your short as price goes down not increase, otherwise price bounces and you end up losing a lot of profit. You might even end up losing money. Its an amateur mistake that many do, lost so much profit doing that
curious to know why now? I've been in your shoes when I was on sidelines for weeks but looks like this dump is just getting started
Sure just keep in mind when that line is broken everyone will rush to find another longer term line down below. 

There's nothing wrong with believing in it but all of the support lines that keep popping up are like you gaining 100 lbs over a year and then losing 50 lbs in 3 months and someone says "dude you're still gaining weight" 

Sometimes you gotta look at the possibility of a trend reversal 
When you stretch your time horizon long enough, BTC has \*always\* been in an uptrend... but this sort of doesn't matter when you're trading on monthly, weekly... and certainly daily intervals.  It's more important to know local trend.
I like it, add another line from ATH touching on 11.7k and 10 and you have a beautiful simmetrical triangle about to conclude!
I agree. The November December bubble was just noise.
Yes, pretty obvious imo.
My thought is that you can't have an "uptrend" with 70% pullback.  I don't' care what the price was in 2011 or whenever.
Hopium. Cant believe people are still doing this. Must be chart no. 39292 with some random line that explains ¬´everything¬ª. I wish it was that simple.
a tangent off that parabolic rise can be charted either way, not too reliable methinks
False
It's just a technical bounce, nothing to see here. Let the longs squeeze resume.
Quite possible >7600 was the entry to grab. I got stopped out of my last scalp (been scalping $100 movements short outside my long-term short on june futures, which I never closed). I was getting too aggressive, so the market slapped my hand. I followed chewy at 7620 on swaps for a less aggressive scalp. Plus they're still paying shorts (???).
I‚Äôm watching that too

https://www.tradingview.com/x/r55syoIX/

Zoomed in:  https://www.tradingview.com/x/9emWSk0Y/

Seems like that old support line from the *Advance weird heAd and double right shoulder* seems to be acting as resistance now.

> o re-en

I think buyers are weary of buying back in at these levels given 7 weeks ago we were down in the 6k's. From those levels price went up 150% to 9.9 and has now dumped to 7.5 in 3 weeks. Price rocketed up from 6.6 and alt euphoria returned, with many alts doubling in a matter of weeks. As fast as price goes up, it falls down.
Oh, a lot of people bought a lot today, believe me. Your hypothesis is incorrect but your conclusion is dead-on: there is every reason to be bullish right now.

By the way, one of the reasons I love Bitcoin is that it freed me from hopium. It's as close to a sure thing as there is as all those with vision, patience, and discipline will see over time.
To me the relatively low volume indicates interest is lower than it was in late 2017 and that this isn't a capitulation wick.
We are here to laugh at the odds and live our lives so well that Death will tremble to take us. 

That Bukowski?
Are you planning to exit your long?
Thar she blows.
Ouhw owie, plz no more bitcoin.
Boom goes da dynamite 
you failed it.. ahhh
What about the A&E bottom
Cheer up. We may be painting the left side of one right now!
I feel like this will finally be the bounce.  

And I can't stand when people talk about their "feelings", so please excuse my lack of TA to back that up.   

But we really are oversold and it has to bounce sometime..just can't see it going that much lower, absent of bad news.  Even a drop to $7200 would probably eventually bounce to $7500 so not much risk here...sort of
At one point they cant long anymore, unless someone starts printing ze tether again. 
And?

It's beginning to look like Wyckoff Accumulation Phase A:

*"Phase A: Phase A marks the stopping of the prior downtrend. Up to this point, supply has been dominant. The approaching diminution of supply is evidenced in preliminary support (PS) and a selling climax (SC). These events are often very obvious on bar charts, where widening spread and heavy volume depict the transfer of huge numbers of shares from the public to large professional interests. Once these intense selling pressures have been relieved, an automatic rally (AR), consisting of both institutional demand for shares as well as short-covering, typically ensues. A successful secondary test (ST) in the area of the SC will show less selling than previously and a narrowing of spread and decreased volume, generally stopping at or above the same price level as the SC. If the ST goes lower than that of the SC, one can anticipate either new lows or prolonged consolidation. The lows of the SC and the ST and the high of the AR set the boundaries of the TR."*

Looking at the 4 hour chart, it seems like psychological support was right around 7,920, then it bottomed out around 7,440. The Automatic Rally had shit for volume, but the Secondary Test has failed so far to break below 7,440 on the 4 hour chart. Gonna wait this one out a bit and see if I can take a position closer to 7,520. 

EDIT: That moment when you blow your entry because you decided to hold out for another $40 price movement.
I think we all know this is going down further anyways. The buying volume is too weak, has been too weak and will probably remain weak. Even though I'm out of position I will gladly buy higher for some real bullishness
You guys are wayyyy too obsessed with the long/short ratio. It's an indicator, but not gospel. 
What‚Äôs weird is the bounce in eth and Ltc while btc longs increasing, shorts decreasing, but price remains suppressed 
yea I'm surprised they are not closing yet..this is about to get interesting..looks like DCB to reel in more longs..
most longing from here are announcing its for a quick scalp so don't see too much of an upside
[deleted]
Fellow long term holder here, yes good to be positive.

Based on ‚Äúfacts‚Äù nothing _too_ scary has happened, $6500 low and now $7900 holding for a bit is great if that‚Äôs as bad as it gets.

The fear only comes with what ‚Äúmight‚Äù happen...Btc useless / zero, put in prison without reason, and McAfee eating himself...damn, I‚Äôve gone there again...mother!
Thanks for that
Would you close the long position and not buy dips if we got to 6300? 
üëã 7700.
lol time to buy?
It might spike down to 7kish briefly on panic selling, but would bounce strongly. But yep, 7500 is the buy zone. Have been saying that for weeks.
When it actually bounces. I just keep moving my stops down, but it hasn't even threatened a bounce since Sunday.
I've been taking profits on the way down, and adding on the bounces.

I will be letting this ride now with stops a couple of hundred dollars above where we are now.
OMG, do not go to Disney, what a waste of money. Take the kids somewhere else. 
Around 7.2, it really depends how we continue dumping now. Low volume bounces would be the most bearish and in that case I might not close until we get a proper bounce. hoping for a clean v bottom 7-7.3k. Also keeping my sept short open and will add on any bounces. Imo we are about to see a brutal bearmarket
I took profits on about half my short, took out a long that's about half as big as my short for the coming bounce and will reshort at 7800 or so. 
i'll take anything between 7.2 and 6.8. Watching that daily RSI as well
They don't know, just a guesstimate.
Most are comparing it to the 2014-15 bear market.  In that case, BTC hit an ATH of $1200 USD and subsequently bottomed out about a year later around $200 USD.  That would put the expected bottom price at around $3.3K this time around.

For these things to actually be able to build up new momentum again in the future for another real bull run, you need some real bloodshed.  You need people to lose faith entirely.  You need the majority of the people to actually think it will not recover.  They need to sell.  Alts need to get decimated.  I'm talking most alt coins losing 90-95% of their value.  


4-4.5k being the **absolute** floor. 5-6k target range. I've held this mid-term price range since before the dumb April BGD. I don't change my stance on target prices on little % changes like most here.
People haven't learned to stay of Mex yet.
Gearing up for a long squeeze if/when 7500 falls. Particularly if we bounce back up to 7700ish to incite fomo longs / short closing. 
We are nearing a support trend line. Zoom out to look at the weekly candle stick. It looks like giant triangular formation. 
Yeah, good call. Especially since the premium is STILL +$130. That's crazy. 
I've generally found a strong sell\-off a day or two before an expiry.  ~~CBoE~~ CME futures expire on the last friday of the month.  So I'll go ahead and call bottoms here.

Edit: CBoe \<\-\-\> CME
Bulls Make Money, Bears Make Money, Pigs Get Slaughtered

take your guess :D

>  And even if we do continue to fall I can't imagine I won't be able to get out at breakeven in the next few days.

look at RSI as we dumped from $9k to $8.2k. it went sideways/down the entire time.

Not saying it's a bad idea to long, but there's a decent chance that we continue to dump from here and not hit this price again for a while. There have been many times when we dumped and RSI basically resets on a bear flag/1-2% bounce and then continues lower
Rest in peace.
R/R still not good. You heard him fellas. Close down the longs.
Will you add to it if/as we bounce higher?

I hate to say it but again I think it's a pretty aggressive position. Your s/l is absolutely fine as I don't see us reaching that anytime soon, but I though you would've been able to get into a short another $100 or so up from here. 

As always, Good luck nonetheless! Though I do hope i get to exit my long at B/E, please?
How can one see your trades and follow you? Want to learn from them! someone mentioned earlier that you have a really good success rate 
Hey Chew, 

I was considering opening a long at $7,660 but it never trigger. 

Could you explain your reasoning a little bit further for entering a short around the same price range?

How did you differentiate a downtrend continuation from a bounce considering extreme oversold indicators?

Just trying to learn from other traders when I'm wrong. 

Cheers.
Sorry Chewtoy. I do opposite 
log or linear scale?
People calling this a bear market are gonna be in a world of pain if we eventually get a real bear market. 
7.8 is a support, last stand, it may go sideways here for a while before it breaks. People still have hope until we're above BGD price.
It sure isn't bouncing very impressively.  We might need a $1000 quick plunge before any kind of decent bounce.
How do you "acquire" a decentralized anything?   That's like acquiring Bittorrent or Bitcoin.

It's only really visible on the 5m chart. Which is way too short term to draw too many conclusions on the next move:

Don't get overconfident. Taking the profit is the hardest part.
username checks out
Surely an asset that can fluctuate 70&#37; in a few months is the solution.
The amount of times Ive prevented myself from catching a falling knife and then gotten in after some sort of confirmation of a reversal, is exactly the amount of times Ive lost when making trades.  


I never try to catch the bottoms, I just let the bottoms catch me. For a good ride upwards, that is. Because only a bottom has enough force to pull me up to any significant place.  


You'd rather be inside of an elevator, than hang off of one under it.
You may not understand risk/reward very well.  Opening a long at 7820 had low risk/high reward.

If it bounces, it could bounce pretty hard and also be a double bottom and really run upwards.

If it doesn't bounce, then cut your loss at 0.5% or so.

Just because some cannot catch knives very adeptly doesn't mean that everyone else is unskilled with it as well.
They should stop buying so that you can make money on your short position?  Nice try.

Goblin town. Jk. Tripple bottom off 6700
Is anyone still hodling here?  They are being awfully quiet, which is understandable, but just wondering how many hardcore holders are left, vs those who sold at over $10K.


The fact that your cat's name is Felix is even more disappointing than this drop.
Dead cat dump?
[deleted]
I agree and I'll actually be surprised if we go below 7. I've had my eye on the 7.1-7.2k range as a likely bottom.
Probability is way over 50% that below $6500 will be revisited.
Ha, and look what Bitcoin does :-)

I‚Äôm stopped out of my short now in profit. Will step back and re-assess. Still making up from the BGD.
So why don't you put your money where your mouth is and short this? 
IMO market is in a state of shock. Low volume dumps of the past two weeks are sketchy af. And PTSD from BGD is there for a good reason.  Smart thing here is to be out of position and see how this unfolds. Pretty of cases for both bullish and bearish scenarios. It's up to crypto gods now.
I'm just going off of sentiment and my own feeling here.. I've expected BGDs following dumps several times now and been validated, but here I don't see it happening. I think hope is close to fading and if we're not experiencing misery then it's at least apathy on the buyer/hodler side.
There is a IH&S forming on the [15min chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/U0iTc7Nf)
Please can you explain this to me?
If people are convinced that the price is going lower, why all those longs are opening? 
Yeah ceo email just went out on Wallstreet:

"Sike! just kidding holdler bros. Herd iz cancelled. See ya in 4 years lolz" 
It's a time for patient accumulation. Buy the dips, sell the tops if you need dollars. Of course, sometimes you sell the "top" and it turns out not to be a top so generally don't sell. The dips and bottoms are a little easier to call. Got a nice order filled today right at $7500 thanks to a tip from a poster on this very board. Good luck. Keep the big picture in mind.
>  I'm a perma bull and I'm sad so it's soon.

So soon?  I'm surprised it took you this long to see the obvious.  

> I want to say 7k will be the 200. 

Ok then perhaps you still don't see it.

>  I'm confused how without a repeat of mtgox sized fruad

Gov't bans and regulation have been much worse than Mt Gox debacle.

> The fomo and doubling in price every 3 months is at least a year away 

Well "never" is at least a year away, so you may technically be correct with that one.

And I never thought BTC would never get to $20K, so I could certainly be wrong with my price forecasts, but not about the huge change in fundamentals that gov't draconian and regulations and bans have brought.  And add Twitter/FB/Google bans as well...which were probably "encouraged" by the gov't.  That is all going to limit the adoption of cryptocurrency, which of course was their ultimate goal.




you are right on one thing at least "time to get a job" and stop thinking bitcoin is your magic retirement fairy
No. Those were the D and E waves, in my opinion. But we can only say for sure if we travel into the future and check.

buy fear, sell euphoria

easy to say, hard to do
In fact, as I see it longs are still UP compared to 12 hours ago. Crazy.
hope you can close it and not get system overload BART'D
Its the inversion of shorts piling on to the rise from 6400-7200-6800. We know what came next. 
Why wouldn‚Äôt it make sense? People paying attention to trendlines will be thinking about going long. Not sure why that‚Äôs unexpected at all...
We just need to look at 1.1k down to sub 200. >80% drop means sub 4k now.
i've switched long. If we drift back into 77xx or below 7750 ill probably close. r/r seems nice here. stop loss at \-1.5&#37;, target 8.1k, 3.5&#37;
patience and you will be rewarded
I covered and opened a small long, even though it has backfired on me the last ten times.
Hourly MacD also about to pop over. Not sure if we'll bounce here, but we will likely reset a bit here before we drop more. 

Nice analysis!
the second time...weekly is at 45 and it got down to 29...
This was never something to worry about.  

The ratio is still more than okay compared to historical data. Longs also had an ATH of about 41k. So we're not even close yet.

I think it's a poor indicator and even poorer if used to indicate a dump. Longs are really hard to squeeze on Finex.
That's a reasonable conclusion
Honestly right now is iffy to say the least, but starting to DCA very slowly here isn't too bad of an idea. 
You might get a 10&#37; discount if you wait
No. Wait.
buy the 50 week MA, sell if it breaks by more than 5%
Buy BTC.
fundus are safu!
Binance has definitely lead some dumps over the last month. 

Seems like today it is too 
That is a mighty H&S right there.
If it doesn't pop much further here, it's perfectly abiding by the downtrend support of the earlier wedge. 

Chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/colFLQiZ/
It was clearly not just one person selling to drive the price down  That much is obvious.

There was a lot of panic selling involved by many people, as always during these big declines.
I sold a few BTC at 8100, does that count toward your anecdote? It's not 1 guy, it's a bunch of people selling followed by some liquidations and stops hitting on the way down.
shorts were actually dropping throughout the entire dip, and longs are rising in proportion (whilst the price is dropping)

this "dump" appears to be longs closing, either whilst underwater or to take profit. Either way, it doesn't bode well for BTC
What evidence supports a July support level? What chart are you using?
Bears will capitulate before bulls. Zoom out. It's still a bull market.  If you had told me a year ago that we'd be over $7K today, I'd have thought you were nuts.

And if these CBOE boys think they're gonna push Bitcoin around the way they did metals, they've got another thing coming.
Wouldn't be surprised at a large wick out of the daily BBands though, followed by a decent bounce. We've been doing a lot of daily BBand wicking lately.
i'm longing 7.4, (Insert Link) 7.3 won't happen imo. Lets see if this plays out
My friend got banned and has no idea for what. It could be that the mods are hodlers and feeling extra butthurt today, so lashing out at innocent posters.

During bull markets, it is acceptable if this place is a perverted circle jerk, but if someone mentions they profitted from the bear carnage, they are banned....very sad and so transparently obvious what is going on.
It could stay this low with another sell off down to the low 7's in the coming hours/day and then rebound. Eventually it should bounce that much
you realize that would bring us all the way back upto $8.9? You think we're just going to retrace the entire dump? o_O 

Yea it usually does retrace quite  a bit. Think we need to look for data from farther back though. Comparing patterns from 2016-2017 to now is...Hm, not going to achieve comparable results. I would look at times when we went sideways/down for a while like 2014 a

Another issue is you are measuring from the bottom of the dump.. We could see a bull div on the 4h before a pump meaning the bottom isn't in yet. it looks obvious in hindsight but if you look at past dumps you'll see that 4h rsi bottoms out before the price bottoms out a lot of the time. 
This is a misrepresentation of this sub during bull runs from someone with an account that's barely one month old. 
Buying here is the best possible trade someone can make.
I'm a cultist hodler. AMA!
Guess i'll add here then. Blows my mind people still listen to this guy when he has been consistently wrong.

Before you call me permabull, Tom Lee is an idiot too.
so where is that?  just above 6.8?
That guy looks like a hobo. Shouldnt an expert in TA be Warren Buffet rich? Even if they are right 60% of the time, right?
The bulls are waiting for this shitstorm to be over, and find a bottom before buying like a frenzy. I‚Äôm one of them ;)

I know patterns don't hold forever but I'm telling ya, I think June is gonna be good as well.
A bounce form $4000 to $5000 is 25%, but not sure would call it "great", given the circumstances.
Fwiw  an ascending triangle after a dump can be considered bearish and a continuation pattern
Pretty much what I'm doing, have been adding to my short at the top but will close out whatever I added at the first sign of a break upward. 
Yeah .. I think there's a decent chance this peaks above $7650 and then claws its way up to $7800 \(likely slowly\).  I'll be shorting from this range if we happen to get there.
Not picking on you in particular and I have nothing against people making money shorting ( I don't do it since I don't have the skills, stomach or patience) but to me leveraged traders longing and then flipping to a short, this overall sentiment of this game, is what's going to keep BTC from ever breaking out. The average holder such as myself doesn't want to be caught in the crossfire of the manipulation. This sub probably has no bearing on the market but all I'm pretty certain that some of the top Tradeview traders are just paid shills to help whales make money. There will never be any growth until the whales and MM want it that way. Look at the organic volume..there is none.
Please read up on what an ascending triangle is before posting. This is a bear flag/pennant. 
Hammer time....

They're not dying to get out. If they were, they would have gotten out in the $8,000 to $9,000 range. 

They're dying for lambos and $20K btc. They're dying for somebody to swoop in with a big green candle and put the market "back on track" to a new ATH. But if you extrapolate their mindset based on how they've behaved between $10,000 and $7,450, they aren't dying for an opportunity to close.
Impressive.
Hmm, 5500 would be really bearish, I really hope it doesn't get that low as I think it'll take quite a while to recover from that, barring a capitulation wick. 

It's looking grim though. 
I remain thouroghly unconvinced. 
I don't see much conviction in either direction 
Roller coasters always have a little bit of an incline before the next drop
As much as this is a Meme, it‚Äôs really not funny. 

Suicide is a serious thing and people have invested their lives into crypto. 

Definitely a sensitive subject and should not be thrown into the context of a joke. 
It has become a meme, it has been posted every time the price dropped >5% in the last months.
Not yet. It's somebody being a comedian. 
the funny(or sad?) part is i don't know if you were sarcastic or not :(
Good thing I'm already dead inside
Not yet.  They are having a really bad day, but they aren't ready to jump out a window yet.

Sadly, that time will probably come in the next few months.   Let's hope not though.
The price dropped 4 percent and it's "game over" lol.  You guys are desperate.  Buy everything you possibly can here.
Double bottom at 6k isn‚Äôt a problem. 7.5kish is the 12 months old trendline. Not sure why anyone is overly concerned.
Stop trading against the trends bro

Can we stop this meme already? 
Canadian volume by far pails in comparison to world wide volume. But there's probably next to no traders on Quadriga just investors so I suppose that could be an interesting metric to measure demand by investors none the less.
You underestimate my power
with this volume they have!
Apparently they don't need much oower nobody is buying only 10k volume on gdax is hardly convincing 
daaaaaaamp!
> we will keep slowly going up from there with higher lows until it spikes up over ATH

You had me under there. 


Or for RSI to cool of before a further move down.
you misspelled down.
ethtrader still thinks that we've been in a bullmarket because of the bounce from 6.5
That's called a huge descending triangle (since we have edit: lower *highs*), and we break through the floor on the 3rd or 4th attempt. 
[removed]
I was bearish from 9.9 to 7.4-7.6 and rebought back in (that range was my target). I do not realistically think we will see this bad boy go under the 6.8-7.4 range. BTC today is not the same as it was even last year. Way too diverse of a buy-side to drop that far IMO. Although we heavily weigh TA, many do not. Market sentiment at the end of the day rules the cryptospace. 
No.
Don't ask if it's silly when you know it is not.
My three targets for months have been 8k,5k,1.3k with support at 3k but that was already tested so i don't weight it as much

peace
Are you in a position supporting this or is it just your feelz?  $3k is a bold prediction.

I guess miners are not interested in your charts and will not allow the price to put them in the red. And they will be in the red around 5000.
I use Chrome. Heard some crazies are actually on Internet Explorer, but I'd advice against that. 
The program I use is called BuyLowSellHigh , although i use it mostly at night time so it might not work for you 
I think we need to bounce hard here or we're going to accelerate down. Cant see us holding our low. I have no target for my shorts except for the 48-5200 area. May take profits on some mex contracts but I have entries on sept futures I may keep that is a 50x hedge of the majority of my position on that futs at like 8700. I'm day trading perps with a 25x short at 8460 with about 70% of my mex stack (which I buy BTC like 1-200 bucks worth for good looking trades 10x trades and it's up lot at the moment). I don't think we'll break those levels so I'm going to turn those up to 100x trades and try and play some bounces on the june futures or maybe look at next weeks UP and DOWN contracts could get interesting if we start getting some volatility.
We already bounced lightly off 75xx, but it doesn't feel like we're done. There's historical support around 7200 and decent very long term support around 7000. You could always layer buys from 7200-6800 and buy back in whatever is left if we pass back through 7600. 
> if we break it

Draw another chart of course! 
Most people are watching the green line: https://www.tradingview.com/x/CcRukW7E/

man has this sub turned into ethtrader or what?

what's next, 'when moon'?
Hmmmm, new low BUT bullish div on the 1h, good volume and a nice wick. Close of the hourly will give a clearer picture. 
You guys just never stop eh? 10k by next week confirmed, right?
During the last two major dips (5900, 6400), when the Daily RSI has gone below 35, there has been a significant bounce. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm watching. Currently at ~37
is bullish div a new meta? lmao at bulltards
It's only bullish divergence if we don't continue dumping. We could still reach a lower low on the RSI.
Call whatever you want you literally habe nothing to lose being wrong 
7600-7700 was my last big buy until we break 6500. Lets see what the future holds Chad!
Retest of $7400 today while the noob and fomo traders on here start crying for sub $6k. A week later we‚Äôll be back at $10k+ while they fomo in right away.
Right on cue after you posted the bounce came in lol. Seems to have petered out around 7950. 

I imagine 7800 will fall before too long and then the real fun begins.

Bars pattern tool.  Its in the same tab as the price range thing
Increasing the leverage will free some of your initial used margin. With the amount that gets available again, you can add more sold contracts to your initial 25x short via a stop market sell with a trigger at 7750. Disclaimer: don't do it. Don't do it. Just don't. 
isolate the margin  with the slider and you will add more without increasing leverage when you sell. if you sell on cross you will increase leverage
To simplify - if you double your leverage using the slider, 50% of your assigned margin will return to your available balance, without changing the number of contracts you have open.
When people say things like "longs are at 30k" they're talking about the \*amount\* of people long vs short. Like, longs are currently at 32k and shorts are at 20k. That means there's 32k BTC tied up into leveraged longs and 20k BTC tied up into leveraged shorts.

It's usually used as an indicator of market sentiment. When the ratio is higher in favor of longs, it's a sign that traders generally think the price is going to go up. When it's in favor of shorts, traders generally think it's going down. It's worth noting that in a "normal" market there's generally a bias towards longs.

Sometimes the trader sentiment is right. But when its wrong, it can result in a "squeeze" that results in the market moving against sentiment very quickly. In the current example, if we start dumping with unleveraged BTC, the drop could at some point get ugly fast as longs closing starts to accelerate and shorts opening starts to accelerate as well, greatly increasing the selling pressure.

Long, you buy.
Short you sell.
  

But there are websites that allow you to borrow bitcoin, so lets say i borrow 1 btc at 10k, shot it (sell it). an buy it back at 9k.
I give the borrowed btc back to the owner and made 1k profit.

But also remember that if the price goes to 11k i have to buy back 1 btc to give back to the owner. 
They almost always move together...and that is true for all the other altcoins as well.

If BTC shoots up 10%, then ETH will probably move up about the same amount.  And same if it drops.
Among other things, if you see the ETH/BTC ratio dumping at the same time as BTC, it means confidence in the alt market is down and the dump could be worse than usual
are you lost?
Your bank account
Choose one: exchange that doesn't require KYC or safe exchange. You can't have both.
you could x5 short on bitmex with 20% of your stack
thats called a unicorn
Gdax has insurance but kyc...kraken has very little kyc but no insurance i think. Thats the ones i use anyway
Probably Gemini, GDAX or Bitstamp.

EDIT: they don't match your less KYC criteria. 
From what I understand they aren't supposed to be traded, they are more like put and call options.

it's like when you think you have to take a small deuce, and you sit on the can... just a bit comes out... but then you feel it coming... you know it's gonna be bigger than you expected... that's what's happening.
everyone is cautios after the big dump, and is scared. So everyone is selling before they are left holding bags.

Ya I dont see it going much lower though the daily candles look like it could stay in that channel till it drops to the 61.8&#37; retracement that I think Goldman put out last week? I dont because we are going to be getting below the average cost to produce right? Here is a marketwatch article from May 11th quoting fundstratt's statement that average price to produce was $8038.

Ever? So this is the highest BTC will be in let's say, 10 years? Jesus.

You'll probably be the biggest bull and call for 100k when the bear market ends.
So this is FUD, beware:

but this really seems like bad news is on the way. This dump is relentless. 

I heard from a friend who heard from a friend of a friend (loool) that OKex may be shutting down? Would be in line with your theory that only exchanges hold this much bitcoin 

This is 100% unverified claims though. I just am personally trying to rationalize this relentless dump

If anyone has heard anything similar I'd be curious to see it

**Again this is completely unverified FUD.** 
what is MOABGD?
People stop down voting and not leaving a reply as to why you are downvoting.. gutlesss wonders

Always save some for the capitulation stage

Actually that's fuel for bulls.
>People will eventually give up


I don't think so, traders can be relentless.

Is it bad that this made me laugh?
A triple bottom is not bullish until it's confirmed by making a new local high in relation to the bottoms. 

Until then, it's just a potential triple bottom that has no real inherent bullish or bearish bias. 

That would require bitcoin break above $11,700 or so. 

So sure, it would be very bullish if it occurred. But for now the market is more than 50% away from reaching that milestone. 

EDIT: For some perspective, it's only about 21% away from dropping below the bottom at $6,000 and invalidating the pattern.
https://www.tradingview.com/x/BZMn0kR9/

If the circle area hold and shows a strong bounce, yes we could see the symmetrical triangle break up if it bounces there when the resistance line is tested. 

But, triple bottoms are *risky business* when it comes to BTC 
It's very bearish to be near a double or triple bottom, because good odds that you will crash through the floor the next time you touch it.
don't have any specific data, but historically tripple bottoms don't play out for BTC
Could happen, maybe should happen... But probably won't happen.
If you link it to BTC should be fine.

Don‚Äôt know if shorting the ratio is a good idea as of now, as eth already dropped 10% today and will likely bounce at least a little. Better to wait for what happens now before entering a short, ideally in a higher position at resistance or so. 

Moreover, I think if eth will plunge BTC will also take another big leg down leaving the ratio somewhat in balance. 
I posted yesterday about it being in a potential head and shoulders.  I would wait until tomorrow/next day to see if a right shoulder starts to form.  And then maybe short that.

If you look at it's history, it's never rolled over after a big run. Always a blow off top or a H&S. 

EDIT: And also from a purely technical standpoint, ETH looks less bearish as of now (https://www.tradingview.com/x/7S3jdOwq/).

Where the trend line at currently?
Welcome aboard
I'm willing to bet this has..... little to no effect.
Little to no immediate monetary effect, but a lot of white-collar professionals watch and respect CNBC, so it definitely is bullish for the space in general if all goes well. 
This is totally normal and expected for crypto.

Most of us are dead on the inside.

Everything is fine.
Come here young one, I'll hold you.

The long term pressures are really *long* term. You have to [zoom out](https://i.imgur.com/qnEOusr.png) to see the overall trend of adoption. The trend since last year is a bubble, a short term deviation from the overall trend. People probably mistook this bubble for the long term trend, and started expecting it to continue forever. But parabolas can't continue forever. 

Right now we're just sideways for months, I don't even feel like we're dropping. A year ago I thought the bubble would top out at $6800 and crash to ~$2k. I was very wrong about the ceiling, and now I think the floor is more like $4k, but would be surprised to see sub $6k again. The short term bubbles are super unpredictable to me, I have no idea when they will trigger or where the price will top/bottom. I don't trade for those. I trade for the ultra long term, just DCA and hodl. It's super boring, but it works.

I can understand feeling hopeless, I felt stupid for still buying at $200 in 2015. But I kept buying because I was convinced the long term was predictable. Just DCA and forget about it for a decade, proof of work generated consensus is going to change the world.
2015 was hopeless mate, nothing looked good. Getting back to $800 so I could break even and the wife would stop holding the wasted money over me seemed impossible.
China has also been running some major anti-crypto propaganda the last week. This seems to have completely escaped the crypto space around here. Unsurprising, as I sometimes feel most of these subs are oblivious to the actions being taken in Asia.
This is less than fuck all compared to 2014/15. Go outside and plant a tree.

Back then it was still more than possible crypto would dwindle to nothing. You may be in for a two or more year wait for real action but it will be back.
How is companies thinking of developing their own blockchains (effectively competing with BTC) bullish for BTC?

EDIT: Also, you should sell.
It is fud if it is real. The crackdown started and Bitfinex is asking for some countries social security numbers.  It should be a short term decline. I am still bullish long term.
The main danger in 2014 was that crypto was going to die out, because no one cared.

The main danger in 2018 is that too many people do care, so gov'ts are going to effectively render it powerless.

So yes, this is worse.
You have a chart of that descending wedge?
would not open a short with this RSIs oversold. Retrace might come in here. I just stay in Fiat but consider to open a small long here as I think we will retest if 7.95k holds as resistance now... 
wrong thread buddy
If we go to goblin town, wait for me. My money will not transfer until next week. Then I can buy at goblin town prices. 
Absolutely. We just had what coyld be considered a technical bounce from being oversold, and that bounce was weaker than expected and currently collapsing.
No more crazy than taking any position in this market.
No. But you need to babysit it. May end up just a scalp. Could end up making some kind of flag and back to goblin town. 

PS This is not financial advice :)

Haha. You'll have plenty of time. The real bottom will be one no one is buying the dip over 
oh look, you can buy it for the same price again...
[removed]
Proof? did I miss something? You got figures on deposits and withdrawls from the fiat gateways?
Really? This reasoning is kinda absurd.
You can have infinite arguments pro and against bull market.

I say this - people are sick of crypto, last conference kinda strenghtened my view on this - only "moon talk" no developments..

Big players (insitutions) who may invest in crypto in nearest future, dont want to buy 8k BTC, they will manipulate the price down as much as they can.

We are back to what price level now? November? If it goes to 6.8 - 7.2k , then we are where - October/November (probably wrong, lazy to look at data)

We havent had a major depression inducing crash for several years now - I think that we are in a perfect ;position now to go all the way down to 6k at least...

And when we recover in 6 - guessing - 24 months?, BTC will be ripe for institutional money and faith may return from ordinary people as well


Since 20 May total 50 billions $ being pulled out of crypotmarkets. So, no, the money here is not only entering. 
they're going to sell like they won the lottery.  Use common sense.

> Bitcoin will be $3k before $10k.

That really isn't a very outlandish prediction  I would maybe put that as 40% probability.   
I keep running into issues with your posts. The word count on this is high, but the meaning behind the words I'm seeing, the user reports, downvotes, and your pattern of posting comments like this have me worried. 

This isn't the first time I've had to make a similar warning.

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ikz1u/daily_discussion_friday_may_11_2018/dyt0yy4/

My hope is that I don't have to keep commenting on this issue.

Yes, there are a number of people who are doing worse that you can point at. You are being singled out because of the number of reports your comments produce. 

Please improve the quality of your posts. I'm begging you to do better. The alternative is that the community keeps reporting you and I have to keep removing your comments and giving you temporary bans.
I too speak in absolutes about Bitcoin 
While at it with your 8 ball, mind telling me who‚Äôs gonna win the world cup?
> Too many longs and increasing closing shorts means there will be little fuel for a (short squeeze) pump, thus price will not recover anytime soon.

How does price going up suggest price going down?
Go big or go home, as they say. (packed yet?)
Err 100x on a 100%? That‚Äôs straight up yolo
How'd you get a long below $7430 on bitmex? o_O lowest price was $7431

And 100x? is this a joke lol 
‚ÄúOur data‚Äú 

You‚Äôre so full of it 
So your changing your prediction by 3k based off what must be less then 1 hour candles?
Hmm, you know what they say, data never lies. 

If I were you I'd go at least 25x lev or more, get all the bears rekt.  
"Our" data? 
Who is we? Do you work for a crypto fund?
Who is "we"?

But this is definitely the best part:

"Our data indicates that there won't be a retest of this bottom and that an "epic" bull run is on the horizon"

Got to laugh.
So shouldn't that then be "Ourusernameweforgot"
Bull run comfirmed
Amount of longs is still way higher than shorts, not sure which side gonna get wrecked first.
how high do you see a bounce going from here ? I'm thinking like 8.2k max   
or are you thinking reversal here?
Unfortunately not. Not yet. It will correct more and more over the next months. 
thisisfine.jpg
"Fully intact" lol

Reality need not apply
then the dump would need to go this fast for another day or 2..
Throw in ETH into the mix, together with the noobs and 2k to 4k is possible.
It may be too late for the next 4-6 hrs, but price will most likely be lower in a week or two or a month.
You will [deeply regret](https://twitter.com/peterlbrandt/status/999347137321172992?s=21) holding this opinion if we drop only a few hundred more.
Or just an RSI cool down ready for another leg down...
my gramma saw the longs:shorts ratio; told me to short it.
Calm down.
Assuming typo $7700
When will people like you realize that you are talking complete shit that doesn't make any sense?
This is the reverse manipulation post.  The phrase he is trying to promote is "trading futures on Bitmex".  Then all of his buddies jump in and downvote him because they are the "real traders" and he is a loser for saying Bitmex futures are bad.  In the end Bitmex gets more free advertising.
18 year old loses use of his legs in a horrific falling accident. Now he must be waited on like an infant and may never walk again. "Don't forget, for most of your life you were just a kid anyway."

[removed]
definitely not.
i hope so just for bulltards' tears
We're almost down to the last support level before sub 2k is likely
What happened to 'we will never see sub 10k again'?
I like you better as a *bullish* troll.
[removed]
Hope you took that short as I suggested.
Why is 6.3k your next target? Thats where the was volume support previously? 
I'm not sure what you mean by his work has been refuted by "actual academics." A lot of his work is about the mathematics of fat tails. AFAIK no one has "refuted" any of this. I think you mean he has been criticized by "actual academics" for his aggressive ways of online debate, which is really more of a compliment than anything. I don't know of anyone who has refuted the notions of skin-in-the-game, nor black swans. He didn't invent those things but in some cases he formalized and popularized them. And also he has nothing to do with bitcoin: I think he's mentioned it in some tweets, it's not like he's an out there BTC bull or anything.
regarding 1, yes for trading and finance the books are not good but for a lot of references to behaviour finance, philosophy and so on they are great imo
Do you have reasons? I trade on Bitmex, why should I be banned?
Ban the by far highest volume exchange? Rightttt. There would be noone left here
[removed]
This isn't what we're here for. You're mischaracterizing the intent and purpose of this sub while denigrating participants.

Bears and bulls are not literally in a fight. There isn't a right side and a wrong side. It's just a long discussion that uses a lot of metaphors. It isn't literal.

Please reflect on rule 1
No, bitcoin is dead, all Cryptos are dead, this nascent technology has no future. I suggest you panic-sell all your bags to me at a 10% discount.

P.D: don't
Here come the liquidations
Move it to $7501. What difference does $2 make?
As much as you‚Äôre  a troll and a bipolar BullBear, you‚Äôre probably right here lol 

*insert rude comment here_______*
Another example of our earlier conversation here.
Fraudulent ICO's give Bitcoin and other legitimate coins a bad rap. Protecting people from these frauds is a good thing. 
possibly to the list of other FUD but main thing is nobody wants to buy BTC at these prices. seems like only buying action are bulls fighting for their positions
yep.

bitfinex hired a new chief compliance officer and their no kyc champion phil potter just quit working for bitfinex
ICOs don't really affect Bitcoin except that people usually buy into them with Bitcoin.  I would welcome a "crackdown" on ICOs because it's a great idea that could become the new stock market if properly regulated.  I would rather trade equities directly on a blockchain with a perfect record than trust my broker and clearing houses and all the stupid, unfair stuff they do now.  Nobody should be writing contracts on my shares but me.
sorry but I have no idea what you are talking about :D
I think you need to reply to messages instead of making full posts. If you‚Äôre on mobile press the little arrow below a post, don‚Äôt full in the comment post as that makes a head post. 
Don't think a whole lot of retail is left... 
No new money, no FOMO. The sooner you realize it, the better for your cryptfolio.
I guess people don‚Äôt always sell the news.. they sell on sentiment 
SHIT DUDE THAT'S INSANE! BULL RUN?? BEAR MARKET?? WHAT DO I MAKE OF THIS???
> completely predictable

You must be very rich by now...
Uh huh... sure it was...
lol
That's a bit like saying we always rally after Consensus....!
Good to know your feelings.
BCH is irrelevant to BTC price action.
I think its 100% alt holders like me capitulating. I became a no coiner last night. Was up 80% a couple weeks after re entering in April and left last night 1% down. Could have been much worse had I waited. Definitely looking to re enter with a different strategy and mindset next go around.
Most ratios with BTC as the divisor tend to fall during BTC dips. 
No, nobody cares about BCH that much. Their onchain use is weak, their exchange volume is also much lower.   If anything, BCH users would dump their BTC to buy BCH and you should see the ratio increasing higher than .2.

BCH may try to make changes to get to BTC status, but i don't think BTC changes things because its worried about BCH.
Does this affect how one should approach trading the market?
Delusional. AAPL = 926B and in a bull cycle, BTC = 129B and in a bear cycle. I love BTC, but that's an absurd thing to say.

Edit: He's saying first to $10T, not $1T. That's a much more likely proposition, although I still think he's wrong.
You have the misunderstanding that we will shoot straight to 4k. If we get there, it will be an event that takes a year to happen. People will give up on buying the dips and start to question if crypto has a future. 
Ok so this post is to talk about things happening to try to make them happen.  It's basically to try to implant the idea that its' realistic that we see 4-5k.  It's not realistic.  
Please don‚Äôt downvote me...but I‚Äôm curious for those that are downvoting, why is this guy‚Äôs comment being downvoted? Is it not true?

Thanks Chewy, just got mah edumacation for the day
But this is not a much better option.
You're likely to get auto-deleveraged and actually end up exiting far before 8600. So I suppose if you calculate the rate of auto-deleverage based on liquidity then you assume you'll be exited closer to 8550 you'll be okay.  
If you're in a long the liquidation will move even faster against the position to have you exited $100 higher than you anticipated because the value of your BTC is falling at the same time.
If you let Bitmex liquidate you instead of using a stop you will lose all of your maintenance margin (1%) assigned to the position. Even if the liquidation engine is able to get a better price than your bankruptcy price the difference will go towards the insurance fund. Larger positions are required to post more margin (0.5% per 50BTC).

If you use a stop just above your liquidation price there is a chance you get to keep the difference.
Has to be in the 50x or 100x range.
Unreal.
Forcing a fakeout will be immensely profitable. I‚Äôll definitely be placing some limit orders to scoop some up in the panic.
Peter Brandt says about 3600 is a downside target of that, I believe.
Anything under $8000 is a steal for you, right?
2.5k my all in price

They should be offering at least 10 different coins by now. At least adding one every 6mo.
I'm curious if there's any gossip about what &#37; of high\-volume users even use the web UI. Probably the answer is "very very few," with anyone half\-serious or high\-volume using the API. If so, fixing web UI bugs is gotta be very low\-pri for them...

Paging u/The_OPs_Mommy who I remember had some solid posts about GDAX clientele.
It's not the spreads \(they're pretty tight now, anyway.\)

Software bugs only. E.g.: literally the sections of the screen are displaying data from different time points or no data at all, somewhat related to when I switched to GDAX's browser tab. Gotta keep refreshing the browser to get everything in sync.
Honestly a double or triple bottom at $3-4k would be super bullish. Some people thought $3k was the moon at the beginning of 2017


Not saying we necessarily get there, but I don't think we're in "BTC is a failed experiment" territory until we're below like...$700-$1k
I know I almost feel bad. I mainly just thought it was interesting. 
I think I would question the nature of our existence if we really followed 2014 that closely
Although "history tends to repeat itself" in so many ways.
Of course, mainly just thought it was interesting. though I'd be cheating myself if I compared to 2014 so often but ignored all the times where it was bullish for a while. 


Are you talking about me? I mainly thought it was funny. If there's anyone here more bearish than you you're talking to him ;)

short since $9650 my man (the first time!)

or are you agreeing with my post that we are headed in the path of 2014? 
He‚Äôs literally just throwing numbers / data out there. There is quite literally nothing delusional about that. Even their opinions are skeptical. Stop being a dumbass. 
yeah but someone reporting from bitmex seems quite improbable but yeah
Worry about taxes?
Definitely don‚Äôt follow my trades, although I‚Äôve been doing pretty well recently lol 
wut m8?
Are you still holding your long from yesterday?

but thats like 100% on 10x leverage
That's a nice statistic, is this for BTC? You also track the others? I think a rough estimate is to add 5% more for each top 10 in mcap
Trading is a zero sum game. It's nice that you want to help give them advice, but keep in mind that it's their money you wish to take when you make a trade.
> 10% of your stack is supposed to be your trading stack

That's not true at all.  It is supposed to be for you, but not for everyone.


Haha no worries mate, I‚Äôll be fine

But yes, taking a break for now 
Why the fuck are you triggered it was his play, stop commenting woman

Sometimes you have to crash down to rise back up, Lil Wayne. Oooh. Yeahh.
it was always like that, it is not a helpful indicator for me.

in the past at some moments a lot of longs were open and price went up and vice versa.
Exactly, lots of people underwater blowing bubbles with the fishes. We as a sub might be bearish, but the long/short ratio still suggests people expect positive price action. Or they are refusing to give up there positions for idealogical reasons (the perma-bull).
funding is easily manipulated by large hedgers since gdax has 0 volume.
No on uses Bitmex.  Bitmex is a scam.
We may not if we mirror the BGD. If 7700 falls quickly, it may cascade. But yeah, I wouldn't open anything right now. I just moved stops on my second short from 7860 to 7852 haha. 
user name checks out
It would seem so
When their entire stack is $500, there isn't enough pain taking stupid gambles for them to learn anything.
Doubtful that many people in here go 100x or even 50x very often.
Line in the sand is the most important part of a strategy

Along with the ability to realize you are terrible at something you enjoy
For bad traders I would rather suggest to buy a book about trading, that expecting to waste more money. First learn your business. Set yourself rules and plan your trades. Then trade your plan. 
He also mocked people for "panic selling" at $8600.


What I wrote above is not a system... it‚Äôs a rule set.

A system would be determining how and when to enter trades. And that is basically voodoo. Also, my comment was largely satirical when I said I just wing it now

The only funny thing is the fact that you are still here. You dont post trades, you dont contribute. You just waste your time trolling
yes, I realize that now
Haha, thanks! 

Yeah I also hope we reverse here soon to prevent a prolonged bear market but everything's starting to point to a (slow) bleed in price, with overall interest diminishing and volumes heading down. My poor holding stack is taking a beating today. 

Ps: Where've you been?? I don't see you posting very often anymore. Welcome back!
Yeah, I'm not expecting any trend reversal here, just some potential bouncing levels. 
Yes, was only to demonstrate that the angles of the bounces are identical, thus potentially also resulting in another minor bounce. 

Rest of the lines are just noise that I use to keep scenario's in mind, not relevant for analysis. 
We may still bounce. I wouldn't add here. If we do break down, you should have plenty of chance to later. Don't compromise your existing entry. If we bounce and your entry is $100 lower than it is now, it will be a lot harder to hold in the face of it. Shorting BTC is rigorous work and often requires stronger hands than holding it, as odd as that sounds. 

Edit; or scalp short on swaps. Makes it easy to catch other movements or cut bad "adds" early
Your reply is basically a much more eloquent version of mine. I agree with pretty much everything you said here, thanks for laying it out so clearly.

Anyway, 7k is likely shaping up to be a big test of where we are headed for the next few months. I think we are looking at a very interesting few weeks ahead (you might even say they are CRUCIAL for bitcoin?)
Agreed on the higher high failure, even with the exuberance back in the market two weeks ago (which likely wasn't even new retail money). With that in mind, it's hard to see it doing anything other than retest the lows in the near future
Cheers, hadn't been following the lower line from 2980. Makes sense to be hovering where we are currently. I did wonder about the validity of the wicks but it seems those lines are respected by the price movements somewhat
I jumped into LISK when the ICO happened about two years ago, so it‚Äôs been a long haul.

I separate my thoughts about LISK into two components: concept and execution. Conceptually, I think the idea LISK has about sidechain implementation and DAPPs is the best solution to scalability in the cryptoverse hands down and the focus on making everything function in JavaScript end to end (including the blockchain) is brilliant. The idea is awesome.

The execution side of things is where I think the team falls apart. I think they get so lost in perfection at times they lose sight of the larger picture of how the space around them is evolving. For instance, it‚Äôs been two years and they are set to release Core 1.0.0 within the next two months. Competitors who have come after them (NEO, Stratis, EOS) who compete in the same space all have mainnet and SDKs completed (EOS will by June I believe). The communication with non-devs is horrible. 

Could LISK become something? Possibly, but they have alienated a lot of investors in the space and I don‚Äôt see an SDK or sidechains realistically arriving until late 2019 (Q3/Q4). I have sold off a portion of my stack and will look to revisit LISK after Core 1.0.0 mainnet launch. 
Short from >7650 and long from <7550 are best positions to be holding currently. You can stop out at minimal loss when the market makes up its mind. 
Pennant shouldn't have a flat ceiling 
Yup. I‚Äôm looking at 7200 for an entry. 



Or I would be. If I had any money.

Always good to keep in mind.
What if it were to go from $5k to $40k?
RemindMe! 1 year 'Bitcoin history isn't on his side but only time will tell?"
Could you explain me how to short/long alts? I have seen there is only few high market cap alts on Bitmex. But I don't need to have them in deposit, right? If I just have btc I can already short them, right?
LN is making big improvements. Hope to see elltoo asap.

Wouldn't short all alts; there is some actual innovation happening as well. But for most of them I wholeheartedly agree.

For example we'll see some competition for Ethereums ERC-20 tokens (OP-Codes enabled on BCH, and Tari on XMR).
Ltc is pretty much testing grounds for btc. Not surprising at all
or they're being forced to at this point..
VPVR indicator. 
Yes, I thought $10K would hold as resistance, and I have a bearish bias, but even with my aggressive shorting, I managed to lose money overall on my entire crypto portfolio.   I just try to catch the bottoms and tops, for bounces and dips, and doesn't work out much of the time.

But we still live to fight another day.  Some of our fellow soldiers can sadly not say the same, and they may be gone for good.
Yes. Definitely a big deal for 0x / ZRX

Up until now Paradex has focussed on ERC20 tokens so it seems Coinbase aren‚Äôt concerned about the SEC branding them securities, or that being decentralised means this doesn‚Äôt matter. (Or they don‚Äôt care)

Hopefully they‚Äôll expand to other coins.

Coinbase Pro is a much better name than GDAX which always seemed a bit random

You know I almost closed my short when you went long?

Your gut trading is sometimes completely illogical and right.
Wait until China bans BTC again...
This is actually hilarious. Where is the China bans bitcoin memes... 
Realistically think about it, We failed to beach 10k on 2 attempts. We have tried two times now to reverse this bear market but have failed only to get rejected back down into globlin town. 

If this turns out to be a **DCB**, and buyers fail to push it above $7800, people will start losing confidence and think we need to test the $6000‚Äôs before the market can reverse.

People were in that mindset at the $6400-$6800 range. 

**Buyers at $6800**: We have failed to break up past $7000 for multiple attempts, so i think we need to see a new low of $4000 before we can reverse the trend. So now, let‚Äôs start shorting it because the entire market believes we will be going lower. 

I think we will see something pretty similar to that range, as buyers will fail and being swapping to a short to say ‚Äú We need to test the low $6000‚Äôs before we can reverse back up‚Äù. Shorts will stack up and longs will decrease. Anything over $7500 will be shorted and we will range from $7200-7600 until the shorts are squeezed and we see a BGD 
I cant wait to short it 
BGD?


^^^^^^/s
>this game is rigged. Fundamentals are bullish and we are so undervalued its not funny.

That means it's an opportunity to buy. When the market does something clearly contradictory to logic then that suggests it'll reverse course as fundamentals slowly start to kick in.
What fundamentals?
Jesus christ... 
You can reuse GDAX account, I just logged in. It's honestly kind of nice, but the lack of trading metrics is a bit meh. Feels MUCH smoother than GDAX has been in recent weeks though, good lord. Now I can at least see how badly I'm getting raped in real time. 

Oh yeah and everything is already synched. basically plug 'n play.
rebranding/slight redesign.  I clicked the try it out button and it immediately logged me in.
I think the "pro" element lies in the side-stepping of the maker fees in the app. 
 Really regret it man, I‚Äôm the undecided person, can‚Äôt be a bag holder but not a die hard trader either. Has dealt me a bad hand as my profits have all been whittled down now, really need to re evaluate how I do things.  I only know a few of my alts now are oversold, one of them is NANO which has just rebounded back ever so slightly above oversold on 1D. Meh not very sure now 
True, but with stops in place as the price drops, they should be able to protect against it no?

I can't believe longs are still increasing. I guess people are trying to catch the falling knife, but this is not the place. The 7s have never really shown much support nor resistance compared to other price ranges.
Clearly. I'm not surprised shorts are profit taking.

More surprised longs aren't beginning to considerably close.
I agree, but isn‚Äôt that the opposite of what‚Äôs happening here? It looks like we broke down and out of a falling wedge, and are now attempting to push back into it. Fakeouts can happen in either direction, though I don‚Äôt see much potential for upside at the moment.
We're either at a point where oversold RSI is going to be pretty irrelevant, or the market is going to green dildo it's way back into the $8,000s. 

I'd argue that both are pretty equally likely at the moment, but the reward outweighs the risk of being wrong in the current environment. 

**Wrong**: Small 2% loss

**Right**: at least 5% near instant gains as overleveraged longs abandon ship below $7,800.
It's not. 2h and 4h RSI is 28.

In a downtrend you should treat 20 as oversold
No, I'm generally satisfied with a 10x position. 
I agree that there's still potential for this to drop a little lower (perhaps as low as $7,200) before there's any sort of bounce, but I try to avoid counting on timing the absolute bottom. 

With RSI as oversold as it is on short and medium timeframes, we're at a point where this could easily bounce 3% or so at pretty much any moment. There doesn't even need to be a major support catalyst to cause a bounce. It could just occur based off of technicals.

So better to take some solid profit sooner rather than suffer through the bounce when it occurs.
I disagree that there should be different rules for some, but in my defense I generally prioritize posting the position entry/exit first and then editing with more in-depth rationale after the fact.
 ‚ÄúAll animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.‚Äù -George Orwell, Animal Farm
He always come back to edit his post and gives rationale anyway if you give him a few minutes
How is that a bad post, from anyone?   It is about as relevant as you can get and even discusses strategy for a further decline.
Not at the moment, no. Whenever I close a 10x short position I'm effectively 1x long with my cold storage.

I wouldn't read too much into that though. It's not like I'd suggest opening a long of any size at the moment.
Did you misinterpret the fact that I closed my short as a suggestion to open a long? Because that definitely wasn't my intention.

Or are you just kicking yourself because there was an additional 1% of downside on your existing short following my exit? 

If it's the former, there's a strong chance you'll be able to close in profit sooner rather than later.

If it's the latter, I wouldn't sweat it. The market should see at least a moderate bounce in the not-too-distant future. 

Continuing to hold a short at the moment is playing with fire a bit.
Ha! I guess I'm a little late to the party.
Of course, bro...but I usually skip head & shoulder days.
>What type of leverage do you use?

10x with 5% of my stack. Posted with the original trade. 
I think he uses 10x 10% of his stack (or the equivalent of 100% of your entire stack)
*Counting to 100 and taking deep breaths.*
I think you forgot the /s

7%
Do you save the best worst comments for later viewing? We'd love to see it. :)
Report them next time.
i think its best to already have your favoured alts and then just pick them up when they dump

Personally, im fishing for NEO, ADA, ONT, ICX, ZIL, BLZ, AION and BNB off top of my head. got a lot of coins i want exposure in, just a matter of picking ones with best R:R atm
I hear ya... we're sort of floating in mid air currently with no restraints, and so it's possible this dump continues all the way to $7k.  Any bounce here is simply a technical one... and may be driven up slowly by bots or still hopeful bulls.  If the local low holds through the night however, I think we may see a mournful push to $7800

Time will tell
I think a good indicator for this is for true shit coins dropping to $0. So far they have held on and even outperformed the major cryptos. 
Safer stop play, but higher loss risk. If we bounced off 7800 and broke 8K, a minor fomo rally wouldn't surprise me.

edit: You have it at 8050?  I have the top of our downtrend channel there. That's a good call, really. 
The point is that if you wait 5 minutes, we'll either be over 8K and you'd have been stopped out for a 1% loss, or we should bounce off resistance and drop back down.
Out of curiosity, was that on June? What's your CA? I wish this futures premium would get more realistic. Are people honestly still bullish 6-weeks? Should be much closer to neutral. No reason to go into discount yet, but yeesh. 
;) Don‚Äôt worry. The losses are really nothing major to me. I just didn‚Äôt expect this to drop so quickly. Thanks for the advice though :)
I was in the same boat (RSI bounce). But tbh my main problem was boredom. Started intra day trading.  Closed my short which in part had been open for 5 days, because I thought it was "medium term trend", in favour of a long for the "immediate term" trend.

Completely moronic tbh.

Good luck with your future trades and enjoy the break!!
I think you hit the nail on the head. Vol is decreasing because more permabulls are buying coins on the shakeouts. Well established idea that the initial adaptors in any market benefit the most. Those with wealth who identify BTC as valuable will continue accumulating. With true wealth comes a risk tolerance of years, not months or weeks. 
i unfortunately agree with you. I never even heard of wyckoff theory until recent but seems like its playing out perfectly 
Nothing like coming home at 7 in the morning, snorting that last line and going 100x leverage to test your luck
Note that stimulants increase performance on iq tests and they were used in the wolf of wall street.

Your overlooking the 3rd option, both.
lol more importantly, did his chart make any sense?
He actually has a point with the red support, Masterluc has the same one: https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/pmV1uLC7-Bitcoin-Longterm-update/

But it doesn't look like it will hold. 

Sloppy I know you're pretty bearish (although quite rational) but how likely do you think we break up from this symmetrical triangle? 
as long as I make enough to replace the ruined underwear then i'll be happy. 

Really need to start buying brown trousers. It's just common sense 
The total amount of longs open hasnt really decreased during the last drop to 6K so that means there must be alot of low leveraged longs out there
What does "futures premium" mean?
I think you might have to move the goalposts on that to below $6,000 at this point.

If breaking $7,800 didn't do it, then they'll just become more and more crazed between here and $6,000.
I see two decent support lines here at 7.7 and another at 7.6

After that, nothing til 6.8 (though I'm sure it will bounce in the low 7's

I don't, but the futures market appears to believe the bottom was $100 above current price, lol.
Seriously thought the 0x + Coinbase rumours made no sense. 

"Why would they list an exchange platform token?"

Oh. They didn't have to, they just bought a dex that runs on it. Didn't expect that.
I am not much in TA, just have knowledge of the basic stuff. If 6k$ breaks, all hell would break loose for sure, with 4k$ getting a real possibility. Thanks for the input.

What I would measure against going to 4k$ is that a lot of bigger players (Mining gear producers mainly, big holders, mining pools) would put a big fight on that line, we already seen the artificial pump just below 7k$, with the same moves to be expected, someone makes a lot of profit on these pumps. I read also, as of now, BTC mining is not profitable in normal circumstances (BTC price of 8k$) , below 7k$ anyone with major rigs in western countries starts to feel real pain by loosing major profits. Below 5k$, all but a few non western countries (China, India) are full scale unprofitable.

and for the giggles, if you got to CMC and put the chart for BTC to April 10 till today, the classic "Bart" formation is about to close...

I could see us dropping even lower with the BTC-ETH synergy, and possibly how they could both pull each other to lower lows. If bitcoin goes down, ETH does too, which affects BTC, and vice versa. Bitcoin losing its market share is a total curve ball we have never seen before.
What similarities do you see between now and 2014? The shape of the chart (linear) is not even the same.  We hit the peak twice in Dec 2013 (only once in 2017) and were at a lower low ($453 following $510) at this point.  We're at a third higher low at present ($7800 following $6000 and $6600).  Technically, the chart does not look similar at all.

Fundamentally things are different as well.  Back then, 400,000 stolen coins were being dumped.  A lot of coins are being dumped now, but many of them will have to be bought back.  The market was much smaller back then in terms of the number of participants and the amount of money involved. 

I don't see any solid basis for comparison and think that if this dump bottoms at $7500 (which it might well not), it would be quite bullish.
Oh, you are right, didnt think of that one. Important addition that i need to keep in mind. Thanks
Looks like you missed a very important "not":  That is the parameter why I think it would **not** go as bad as 2014 
i agree i think the market is drastically different.  
You're forgetting that Bitcoin has lost significant market share and ETH movement also affects BTC. I personally see the outcome matching what we saw in 2014, possibly even worse if ETH freefalls, which affects BTC, which then affects ETH, and so on.
At this time, any negative news on MT. gox would be really bad. 

If those coins start to get liquidated, just judging by the last time they were "only" moved to other wallets, oh boy...
Are you a king?
Buy in December and get bent over 
This is the most exciting day in crypto since BGD. 

Who doesn‚Äôt want to waste their entire beautiful day ( 80 and sunny where I am) in their house watching charts like a crack whore 
I did. :) Caught it pretty much at the exact bottom too, if this holds which it might not.
Well yes, obviously. Could be new ones or people adding to existing ones.
Basically. If we move up to 7700ish, I could see longs go to 36K while shorts drop below 19K. 2:1 is terrifying on the level of Shorts>Longs. 
No, you're correct. It wasn't so obvious then (except in hindsight). Short squeeze is substantially easier to do. 

Not many saw it. Chew did. Got his entry in very shortly before the BGD.
BTCUSDLONGS and BTCUSDSHORTS on tradingview.
Or maybe when 8k broke.  Sigh 
Truth. I am totally gambling most of the time. My ignorance is costing me.
I'm reading it this way too.
Yeah I know haha. Sometimes I get rushed trying to update the bot as close to when I make the trade as possible, and especially when I'm on mobile I can screw that up a bit.
!short xbtusd profit 7450 8&#37;

Buying more back in, will continue doing this down to 6.8k. Hey justanotherlogin, if you see this and it's a quick fix, could you update those two positions in your databse? I'm sorry I suck.
Always the best timing with exchanges i swear 
Haha, reminded me of this:

https://i.redd.it/vzvg2c52nim01.jpg
I went through the 2014 bear market. I'm actually thinking it'll be worse this time because Bitcoin market share is the lowest we have seen, and ETH movements are affecting BTC.
50% of the time sometimes but not always
It's literally the only indicator we have. Not agreeing with OP, just being pedantic.
Today is definitely the most fun I‚Äôve had perusing this sub for a while. 

Humor/ Serious TA/ Predictions/ Trolls/ Tons of Sarcasm.

Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm a millennial and I enjoy this genre of stuff, but having some light comic relief is definitely needed at times like this where things can get hairy.

There‚Äôs definitely a significant amount of shitposts today, some worse than others. But it‚Äôs hard to draw the line of a absolute terrible shitpost and just some guy messing around trying to make people laugh. I don‚Äôt agree with the backlash you have been getting, as people have been consistently attacking you for being ‚Äú Too rough ‚Äú as a mod. You‚Äôre doing a great job keeping the sub clean and on topic, but sometimes you can be a tad harsh on some. 


yer doing a fine job. a fair compromise means no one is truly happy. I think respectful cheeky commentary is fine for entertainment reasons. there is a bitcoin market constitution, no? 
Please for god's sake come down hard for a bit and hopefully things will improve

peace 
Maybe we should start a ‚ÄúDaily troll box‚Äù thread to separate from TA on this thread? 
Probably because everyone has different opinions on how it should be run. Maybe do a poll to have a generic opinion of how the sub wants to operate?
At this point, if you can‚Äôt beat em join em

When in rome

But it‚Äôs kinda strange. Im sure itll get better on its own soon enough.

I thonk a lot of people went heavy short is all and the gains are getting to their heads
Whereas you just get banned outright permanently from r/Cryptocurrency if they feel like it like I did.
Part of the problem is the alt thread. It's so out of place and only attracts zombies. These people then spill out into the rest of the sub. This place is better when it's primarily Bitcoin with the occasional alt-related post. Inviting those savages to take up residence here is madness. 
We don't agree with 4 and 5. 31 day and perma-bans are not very rude and very cruel.
Rule 1
I'm 100x 100% short from 8.1 (June) CA. Sometimes you get lucky and you don't get kicked off the horse ;)
Happy little accidents.
You never know
System overloaded  - massive buying frenzy?
The Chinese will continue suppressing the market for as long as possible to weed out competing mining pools and ASIC manufacturers.
Not changing btc's algorithm in response to Bitmain's ASIC patent was a huge mistake and we continue to pay for it.
Gotta give it to them, their customer service is really on point. 
...of 2020.
You are gonna close there?
I might try to catch a wick to 7100, maybe.
What are your plans for this? Set stops and wait to see if 7200 holds? Or close position and reshort? I can't help but get the feeling we might not see 7200 given buyer behavior past two days. 
Cut? I remember before we had the run up to 9k it was hovering around 6.7k to 7k. So hopefully there‚Äôs support there. 
I second this^ Thanks for the heads up on ETH!
Good point, it dropped from $595 to $565, so I quickly assumed it was big.  I'll delete.
USD pools 

Could be related to their other issues too
positions are set. long vs short. golden bull, the goddess of all barts, coinbase pro... next week on bitcoin. 
People using too much margin? Shorts 'bout to get a BGD in their little po-po? The world may never know.
Lol, that rhetorical question is like the kind my dad gives me when he's about to kick my ass.
he has tight stops...I get what you're saying but if there is a strong downwards trend after this (which is very possible) this could be a very good entry. Tight stops makes up for losing profits. 

It's not amateur if the r/r is worth it and he's not just adding to be greedy. If he would normally short here then it's fine to add. If he's adding for the sake of getting rich because he thinks it's going to tank for no good reason then yeah, it's amateur

I am no bottom shorter and even I am thinking this is not the worst place to add since there seems to be absolutely 0 bounce. a short with a stop loss above $8-8.2k is not a bad idea. 

It will be very difficult to enter after this if we continue to drop
Just getting my feet wet at this support range. Only in for 25% of my budget. Next target is 6900 range
I agree. I was tempted to increase my short at 7625 but bottled it :\-D

I was concerned I was getting too greedy. Looks like the bounce was an RSI cool off. I just can't understand the number of longs given we've crashed through 7800.
lol, it went just high enough to trigger my take profit stops. Guess I bungled those but in any case I shouldn't have gotten greedy earlier and should've closed in the 7.4 range. 

edit: and my phone won't turn out so I'm locked out of 2fa login on mex for the time being. fml lol

edit 2: it only triggered half my stops! i'm getting too lucky here, i better watch my back.
Zoom out.
Of course there is less interest. Retail
Investors got slaughtered and the price keeps tanking and is rarely in mainstream media for its price. Greed drives interest. There‚Äôs nothing to be greedy about in crypto. People want easy money. There‚Äôs no easy money in crypto now like there was in Nov. 
Oh , ... I though you meant Charles Bukowski as in the part where you can find me curled up behind the couch where I've been for the past 3 days. 
I like my TA with some drunken poetry mingled in.
Inspiring quote, thanks!
That's one.
I'm probably going to add to it, actually.
I'm looking at 7547 next. The Eve breakdown was Adam's fib retrace of .618, and they are playing with the fibs really nicely. 
maybe it comes after the consensus pump
Snagged a long at 7464 on GDAX for similar reasons, I *felt* like it had gone low enough, but god damn did it get sold into when it started going up again. Between longs refusing to close and how big this drop is, I can't imagine people don't jump on any opportunity to exit if the price starts going up even a little.  Back out at 7520.
That's how I feel.  We're incredibly oversold all over the place, so I think there's going to be a bounce somewhere soon.  
Repelled.
Does every accumulation have to be followed by a distribution, meaning that we restart the Wyckoff Accumlation-Distribution Cycle? 
At one point I was convinced we would go lower, but now I'm not so sure. on the 4 hour, 2 Hour and 30 minute charts, RSI has cooled and is moving up, OBV is moving up, the Wyckoff trade ranges for accumulation at this level haven't been breached, and the 30 minute chart even looks like it's trying to paint a cute lil catapult formation (just recently failed the third test of 7,639 which would have made the triple top). Waiting to hop in around 7,520ish again.

EDIT: Bullish catapult from the 30 minute PnF chart was realized to $7,720 from $7,520. Next move should be a retest of support o the trade range at $7,440 possibly moving into a spring pushing below the support line 5% or so.
eh I used to say this until I got a huge green dildo made of 15k shorts in my ass. It's definitely worth paying attention to. 

This really is shaping up to be the reverse of that day 
I agree that many are obsessed with it...  but there's some merit to this metric... lopsided longs in a clear downtrend mean potential for liquidations and forced sell\-offs which increases downward pressure 
Since when are dead cats worth $7500? Enron had a DCB... because it was dead. This is not Enron.  The cat is very much alive, and as soon as these clowns run out of coins/have to cover, that will become readily apparent.
I would not use this sub as a unbiased cross-section of long behavior.
Well it totally depends on your leverage... 

I think most who are bullish are expecting a bounce and reversal at \~$7k when price intersects the large pennant formed on the daily

If longs remain in majority down to $7k, there is the potential for market makers to push price below the line causing a cascade of liq/sell\-offs ... all fuel to push the price lower.

Inverse happened in April in the mid $6's
Close, no way! My strategy is based off time, not price. If we were to break 6,5, I would stop buying until we hit 4k though. PM if ya want more details.
I would take the term ‚Äú don‚Äôt try to catch the falling knife ‚Äú with 7636363 grains of salt right now 
Yep. There was that massive BGD for a reason from 6s. I highly, highly doubt we will reach down there again. 
staggered buys each 80$¬†is the way here
Bounces have been like 40-60$ at most. 

It‚Äôs literally sad. Buyers can hold the price up, but can‚Äôt bounce it back up 
7.2k possibly for a full close and swap to a long? Seems like a decent play 
Don't take them all the way to goblin town.
You short? 
Couldn't agree more. I sure as shit don't.
If it ever hit 3.3k again i'd lose my shit and buy with everything I could.
if you're going by when it bounced off the 200 MA during the 2014 bear market it would put us around 3.3k if we dropped there right now.  But realistically it would take months for us to drop that far and the MA would be about 4k if we took another 6 months to get there like it did back then.
Well at least it fits my body I guess.
This is true. But right now would either be the bottom or the middle of the range and we bounced to 8.6k which I feel would be where I'm longing the equivalent of. 
Rest in pieces
I'm confident. I'm scared, but I'm confident, lol.
> R/R is just too good not to long imo.

he said it's too good not to long
I'm rarely super picky with entries. Sure, maybe I could have gotten an entry $100 higher, but there's no guarantee of that. 

In this particular case, I was watching the market struggle to make it through the $7,600 to $7,700 range (which it still is struggling to accomplish). I had to make the decision of, "enter now and suffer through some period of being in the red," or "wait to enter higher and run the risk that the market is going to drop lower again before you have that chance."

Generally speaking, I usually go with the second option.
He doesn't add, his short is him hedging and going flat and not net short. 


My success rate is actually not so great. Somewhere between 55% and 60%. 

My ability to maximize gains and minimize losses is what makes me a profitable trader. 

I post all of my entries and exits here in the daily, so you can follow me here. Otherwise there's a bot created by /u/justanotherlogin where many folks in this sub log their trades, myself included. 
When RSI is incredibly oversold, it should serve as an open invitation to buyers. If there's any weight behind a bounce, it generally takes the form of a strong V-shaped pump. Not a lagging, .5% at a time stairstep. 

Because there was no strong push, despite RSI being ridiculously oversold, I saw it as a sign of weakness.

I could be wrong, but that was my mindset when I entered the position.
Whenever anybody is shorting you are doing the opposite. 

I don't think I've ever seen you post anything other than:

1. "Bears are about to be in trouble."

2. "Shorts should cover here." 

3. "Adding to my long."

4. "Opening a long."

Nothing wrong with being permanently bullish, but it's not like I'm surprised that you're doing the opposite here.
Found *one*.
Same, bought at 7500. Stops in place but this is massively overdone now. \(imho\).
how is this not a bear market? We've been going down for 5 months already wtf
This is more like a happy little correction. A real bear market is pain. Pain beyond pain. Especially for hodlers.
So what is it then, just a little 5-month pause in the bull market?
this is a bear market. Doesn't mean it won't get worse. I for one am expecting 6k to break, then down to 4k and a 50/50 at that point if it breaks. I'm also of the opinion this would take months to get to. 

We'll be very lucky indeed if we get back to over 10k by the end of the year. 

right now, this is the first third of the bear market for me 
Wouldn't it make sense to be short if you think this is a bear market. In which case if we get a "real" bear market they'd be even happier.

Why would they be in a world of pain?
BGD?
Yep I agree, though I thought bears would've pushed past it by now.

Given the lacklustre volume past the 0.618 fib, I'm willing to take the position here and will abandon is we get past 7800 (probably 7750) losses would be minimal. Feeling a lot of bearishness so I expect some shenanigans to catch people off guard.  
Don't expect a strong bounce like in February. The market is very different now. 

When it starts to go up, it will be slowly at first.

>**Wave 1**: Wave one is rarely obvious at its inception. When the first wave of a new bull market begins, the fundamental news is almost universally negative. The previous trend is considered still strongly in force. Fundamental analysts continue to revise their earnings estimates lower; the economy probably does not look strong. Sentiment surveys are decidedly bearish, put options are in vogue, and implied volatility in the options market is high. Volume might increase a bit as prices rise, but not by enough to alert many technical analysts.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_wave_principle

Having said this, it *does* look like a bear flag. I expect another drop. But only a little one. To around $7750.
If 7.8 breaks we might see just that.
They buy the team , the knowledge, the infrastructure.  The TX are decentralized, but not the platform itself. Just like sausage sales are decentralized, but you can buy a sausage stand
*Decentralization* is a misnomer when it comes to *decentralized exchanges*. All it means is that you retain custody of the coins in your position.
Paradex has 0x, OMG, REP and others
Lol at that bull flag 
The hardest part has been not giving in to greed and increasing my short position, with hindsight I wish I had been greedy, but I know the second I increase leverage is the second we see a recovery.
Early days into a decades-long pursuit.
If I wanted to go up in an elevator, I wouldn't jump in while it's falling towards the ground.

Unless Im misunderstanding, you're saying that you lose every time you0 wait for signs of a reversal to open a position? But succeed opening longs while we tumble downwards?
This is, borderline, a rule 1 violation. I've removed it so others can't see it.

You've been warned about this in the past. Please edit your post and show me that you know how to avoid breaking this rule.
There have been posts all through the night with people opening new longs and complaining about being liquidated on the way down.

There is absolutely nothing indicating that we are going to bounce hard here.


Yes, because my comment is going to influence the entire BTC market.
Learn from this - or else.
You'll be alright chap. 
IMHO, crypto has a pretty bright future, even if we crash down to 3K, that's still about five times up from the start of the bubble and the next two halvenings are 2020 and 2023 (or 2024) respectively.

If I were you, I would sell the stocks, use the profits from the stocks to pad your normal bank account so you have some feeling of a safety net.  Then hodl the crypto, don't buy more crypto, and add to your fiat stack (by saving money) so you have more safety net.  Also, if crypto goes down big, you have money to buy crypto cheap from your savings.

Just my 2 cents.
That‚Äôs my buy in target 
I turned off selling on my trading bot. Holding onto what it bought in the last week.  Convinced we will make a higher low here then start the next wave up.
Nope just added some to dca my position. 
I sold a large chunk around 9 to pay taxes but not sold another coin. All of mine is in my short. 
hodlers aren't on a trading sub (generally)
Names have been changed to protect the innocent. I also don't monitor my cat's shit's that closely. With Re weak dump: I've come to expect this. Bearwhales aren't what they used to be back when they had 400,000 stolen Gox coins to dump. Ah, those were the days!
Noice.

Sounds like his cat is alive and pretty smart.  Dead dump cat?
Third higher low. Look at any period before a big run up. It's there. I count 6000, 6600 and 7500 (assuming this holds, maybe 7000 if it doesn't). Not sure why this occurs. I suspect it is a symptom of diminishing float as people load up on the dips and send to cold storage. But it's definitely a thing.
Backed up by the charts. 6k to 11.7k  , 6.5k to 10k were higher lows and lower highs.  7k to 9.5k is my guess this time.
Maybe 7.4k is the bottom...

Edit: shit better add the /s
How are you calculating that?
Maybe I‚Äôm already in position and don‚Äôt need to short here.

I‚Äôm just providing counter balance to what I perceive to be nonsense hopium.

I agree with the threat of the BGD, but the conditions for it just aren‚Äôt there right now, as has been well documented further down the thread.
In order to use margin on bitfinex you need to lend coin/USDT from other people. If there is no more USDT or coins available to lend you cannot use margin anymore. If you lend you also pay rates, paying high rates is very unattractive for long term positions, so people are less likely to use margin.  
Right now theres very little USDT available to lend and its at high rates. You'd want there to be at least 40 mill + available.
this just shows most people are convinced its going up 
Hoping for a short term bounce maybe?
Nah. If the government could kill it, they would have done so long ago, back when it was only a weed coupon for Silk Road.

That's what you guys don't get: Bitcoin is the most anti-fragile financial instrument ever invented. That you don't get this and probably spout, "Blockchain not Bitcoin!" betrays a woeful lack of understanding of the technology and its profound implications. 
As soon as I setup sell orders between 18-25k it was the ath, so, yes I'm quite sure.
Which governments are ‚Äúbanning‚Äù cryptocurrency? I‚Äôve only heard of India doing this.. whoopty-do. 

Most governments have acknowledged cryptocurrency projects, and are working on regulating (because they realize they can‚Äôt make this market disappear).. 

Regulation here is important for bringing in the masses... and for bringing in institutions like NASDAQ... So how exactly is this bearish? Maybe bearish for some alts, but definitely not for bitcoin. The liberal mindset is long gone when it comes to cryptocurrency regulation.. Not like regulations will scare away potential investors.. I think it‚Äôs more likely to scare away old investors and scamming devs. 

> And add Twitter/FB/Google bans as well...which were probably "encouraged" by the gov't.

lol.. it just seems like you‚Äôre slightly delusional.. seems like you think governments are out to kill cryptocurrency. What‚Äôs more likely are these sites found that most cryptocurrency ads were for scam ICOs, so they were removed. Not like bitcoin or Ethereum need goddamn ads (albeit Bitcoin had community paid ads on here years ago.. but it‚Äôs just not the same as advertising some bullshit ICO)... To assume government had a hand in this is just a tin foil hat theory to back up your narrative that governments hate crypto. 
Which bans? China banned and its huge there still? 
So I see you have a mega bounce after point E. What price is that? It‚Äôs blurry 
That blue line is pretty funny. Has that ever happened before in crypto or other markets? (pretty sure that no, it has not)
Most of us expected the bounce to reverse off the log line, breaking that threw many of us for a loop. 
You mean right after the BGD?
heart says long, head says short. 
!long xbtm18 open 7920 2.5x 50%
Do it slowly and don't use too much leverage. It's pretty easy that way.
Brekt
Yeah, I already took some profits :\) Learning on other peoples mistakes.
3D has yet to establish a best fit line for the current trend which is up. This is the trajectory it's on if it maintains its current course.

Largest deviation from best fit line was a 50% drop. Current deviation is 53% drop.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZuPskYfd/
scalped some profits now baaack again short. Don't have any confidence in buyers. Short from 7900, stops split into four from 8150 to 8250
Yeah, rewarded by losing your money.
Thanks!

Don't even need a big bounce to get out of this long at b/e. Just a decent sized bear flag should do it.
but but under 50 is oversold!
Yeah I mean people have been saying it's been a good time to DCA since $16k right?

That's worked out well so far hasn't it.
Yea, It's going to be bad for a while.
And liquidations. Free fuel!
no, maybe you didn't get the memo
its one trader, one whale, massive manipulation and if it wasn't for this whale dumping, btc would moon
You might laugh at how simple this is: it's two lines. Bitcoinwisdom, 3d chart, linear connect the February and March lows. Switch to log scale, and connect the $20K peak to the almost $10K recent peak. The point of intersection is around July 1st. I'd rather see it break downward so we can get it over with. Breaking upward, while positive, just means we're probably going to see extended sideways movement for a while with no real direction or sentiment.
Was watching on Kraken instead of Bitfinex. 
On Bitfinex only now did the BBand get touched
It could also be that you don't know what you're talking about.
This is definitely not true. 90% of the sentiment on this sub has been bearish for the last 4 months
What did you expect to happen when they make the creator of Moon Math a mod?
For some reason I would feel better if that happened. I don't know why, but I feel like we *need* to hit 7200 again. It's probably irrational, though.
Sure why not? We've retraced much worse selloffs several times since the 20K high. 
Speak the truth!
The price just bounced about 2% so buying under $7800 was actually a good move.
How many thousand percent are you up since you first began hodling, and how hard did you laugh at the "curled up in a ball in the corner, muttering to themselves" comment above?

Me: several and it was a good belly laugh.
Add here, and you‚Äôll likely be succumbing to an emotional response. At least wait til we bounce off $7200. Our current level holds zero technical significance other than a temporary RSI recharge before continuing to drop.
I've got it at around $6850 currently..
Well it‚Äôs moving as time passes, but currently it‚Äôs just above $7100 (someone better at drawing lines please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong)
I hope that if I spend 50 years day trading that I don't rely on book sales and twitter followers for my income.
the guy is a hobo but warren buffet has nothing to do with TA
dito. and i'm patient as hell.
>Doing this without a signal we are done falling is premature.

For me the buy signal is when BTC is down double digits in a 24 hour period and the other coins significantly greater. 5&#37;/9&#37; isn't a buy signal. 10&#37;/18&#37; is \(usually\)
Yes it is extra risky but you also give yourself opportunity for an extra 2 or 3% potential profit before a bounce is more confirmed.

What sold me on an impending bounce is that wick down to $7401 on Bitfinex...although it is not showing up on Bitcoinwisdom..just Trading View, so not sure how valid it is.
It might be, but I never try to push my luck too far. I have realized a substantial increase in purchasing power, specifically catching a bunch of eth at great value. Especially trading alts, on a BTC reversal, the sell-side disappears. Far better to buy in prematurely than be stuck market-buying when the sell side vanishes. 


Sure, BTC could go sub 7k, but I don't think it will, and if it does, I have already profited on this drop from 9.9. I'd rather not miss the upswing. 
Well, how about we breach $7500 and fill my damn limit order first.  Frickin' tease.  Dumpy the chump must be running low on coins by now or else he'd surely bestow some of his very cheapest on me.

[Edit: OK, well, got some! Gonna set two more buys, one at $6.9 and one at $6.6. Wish me luck!]
Yea this is like a reverse ascending triangle considering they usually are when the prices rises, forms a triangle then rises again.

In this case it fell, created a triangle and May fall. Usually when it falls it creates a descending triangle though
If we don‚Äôt get there, what‚Äôs your move? 
This is the case with normal currencies though. Forex traders don't destabilize the currency. 100x leverage and whales/early adopters and dumb money do
Is all a matter of perspective.

8083 is my goal to close it. 
Sad to see you bearish, my fine burrito brother.
for that to become real the bounce would have to be super high volume and break 8k again i think, otherwise I just see us bleeding back down
8-9k range most were in the green, now 1/3+ of all the longs are underwater and many pay high rates. I'd be very surprised if a few thousand longs didn't close on a bounce
I could see trying to catch the falling knife at these levels.  Of course will probably go much lower, but if by some miracle, this was the bottom, then could be some big gains in the coming years.

Personally, I think BTC will never see $20K again, or even close to that.
5500 isn't all that bearish imo especially if it happens quick.
nothingburger.jpg
Well just starting...of course has to take out some more key levels and stay above support for awhile.  But at least some hope for longs who played the bounce.
Yes, it's likely to bounce back to $10K but even $8400 would be a nice gain from here.
thanks for your thorough analysis !

p.s.
have a crystal ball for me ?
Agreed, but it was not meant as a joke, I actually consider it a real strategy. 

Like shorting financial equities after a terrible event.

You could argue that is not morally correct, but that's another subject. 
People who invest their lives into anything that isn't dependent on them are basically idiots who shouldn't be allowed to invest.
Mhm
The only people that are concerned are short sellers trying to scare people.  It's a great time to buy.
I agree, shorters are making a big mistake.
I was the one saying what you are saying to me when people were saying smart money is buying at 10k , 9k, 11.5k, etcetc. Then at 6.5k, I said smart money buying here. Now I am saying it again. Don't confuse me with the perma bulls.
Yes, any post about "smart" or "dumb" money should be reported and deleted and banned for at least 24hr.
That's my point. The vol isn't relevant. Canadian's buying 200 btc to me are a demographic that represents smart money in general (investors/longer term swing traders who buy and hold for a while)
Dump em!
"Lower lows."
I see lower highs since december.
What are the lower lows you're referring to?  I see higher lows on the daily timeframe.
It looks like we have had higher lows. 6000 \(02/05\), 6400 \(04/01\) and hopefully this one higher than that. Maybe 6800 if we pick 5400 from 11/17 and say higher low is going up by 4/500?
But that's not really the case is it? with higher lows and lower highs. I guess it depends how low we go during the current dump.
Thanks for helpful response!

Is it a bad thing that it was already tested?
Yeah I'm short. $3K isn't that bold. Everything above the break of previous ATH is in play, imo. $3K was tested a lot more than other ranges. It's also closer to the absolute bottom. It's also a range that I think will give bulls renewed energy, especially if most people are waiting to buy in the 1.2K range. It's hard to me to imagine people actually waiting until that range to dip their foot in again. $3K bounce could easily manifest the kind of FOMO we haven't seen in a while.
They're not *my* charts, horizontal support is clearly visible at these ranges and more-so at $3K than $5K. Miners can and will only do so much. They'll shut of their machines if necessary.
This one is for noobs. Pro use BuyHighSellLow.
> I think we need to bounce hard here or we're going to accelerate down.

I have another point of resistance in my charts at around $7450. Which would correspond with a bear flag target, which might be forming right now.

If it goes below that. Well, that wouldn't be nice...
I'd agree there's definitely more downside. Shorts decreasing, longs still increased (Seriously wtf?) 

Either we're in for one of the greater bamboozle's in Bitcoin history, or we're on a slippery slope. 
If 7800 couldn‚Äôt hold what chance does 7500 have? At least that‚Äôs where my head is at. Thank you though!
It seems, some people have the same line as me in their charts. So far it's a big resistance. I just hope that this is it, or I'll get worried.
This is what happens when mods let themselves be bullied out of moderating. This place should look like r/science when it hits the front page and the posts that don't follow the rules all get nuked into oblivion. Instead we get yet another crypto subreddit.
Yes

When moon?
Small bull div on the 2H as well. But it might be worth waiting this out a bit. I have a feeling there‚Äôs room for a lower low (or double bottom) on the RSI, as absurd as it might sound.
Yeah that's true, edited my post. 

I'm keeping a close eye. 
That's my secret
I hope you're joking 
I can find a shorts vs longs chart that is good but I'm looking for one that has the price on it too.
You're the best thanks!
Thank you. I will don't don't do it then.
Would you have put in the leverage now, and add more sold contracts later, just to save time in ~~buying~~ selling frenzy? Or do I risk more by doing that?
Yeah okay makes more sense because I did try to understand it by studying it. And in stocks I knew you could do that but didn‚Äôt know you could on bitcoin as well. 
Thanks, so if ETH drops faster than BTC, in other words, it means it's a worse dump than usual. What's the reason? It means the sell panic is stronger among ETH owners and they sell it for BTC as gateway coin out to fiat?
Idk, enlighten me if I am.
truth is no exchange is safe. just unsafe and sader
which executive?
C'mon. You can be a better person than that.
chill 
Lordy u sound like Archie Bunker lol. 
Thank you. Where do you see it? Bfxdata keeps crashing for me.
Some leverage wasnt accounted for there. It was x5 ish as I added on the way down.
Sorry for that. It was meant o say that when alts drops it affects BTC. I‚Äôm using it as a indicator for my trades on BTC 
How does a company acquire a decentralized exchange? Seems like a paradox to me.
I agree. Seems to me like Coinbase is not only trying to offer up trading for hundreds of different cryptos, but also make it easier/safer/quicker for institutional money to enter crypto. Bullish news all around, imho. Time will tell, of course.
Looks pretty much the same to me except for being able to zoom the chart.
‚ÄúPotentially years‚Äù the new album from ‚Äúno new buyers‚Äù is available in stores now.

‚ÄúWe‚Äù as a community clearly don‚Äôt appreciate it tho. This guy is just giving his opinion and it gets downvoted. Is there a downvote bot running, or are people just assholes? If one disagrees with something you should comment rather than downvote, to add to the discussion...unless it‚Äôs just blatant shilling or shit talking.  I know this internet karma is a trivial thing that means nothing in the real world, but it does have some kind of psychological worth, and if people just go about downvoting, the effect will be suppression of discussion. Just my opinion tho
Okex? 
That would be brutal. I closed my scalp short (50x from 7830) at 7480. Just reopened with profits from 7520. 

Leaving my June futures short untouched. Premium is finally fading.
woof. quite some fud
Chinks are just the gift that keep on giving to bitcoin.
Whoever the fuck thought it was a bright idea to not do what monero did needs a sound thrashing.

Presumably Mother Of All Big Greed Dildos
Because it's bullshit. I know a buyer was looking for over 100k BTC OTC 2 weeks ago. There's plenty of coins available to dump on the market. 
his short is from like $15k. not everyone here trades on the 15m time frame.
Well that depends on what each of us consider the capitulation stage 
No bulls left the building 
I think he‚Äôs saying that‚Äôs the statistical endpoint of the formation breakdown (if it occurs).  I‚Äôm sure the probabilities are based on past equity performance...which prob isn‚Äôt worth shit is this insane 24hr market.  
I think that's the technical target for the breakdown.
Will wait for a bounce to open a short might quickly get trapped if i open now
Agreed, if anything the time to short the ratio was 0.085. Below 0.75 might actually be a good time to long it. Always a tough play though.
My charts show ETH breaking down from the H&S yesterday, which means it will likely test the neckline for resistance in the coming days. I agree though, ETH doesn‚Äôt look as likely to tank in the short term now.
I think it was in the 6500 to 6800 range
thank you kind sir
Unless is something like coinbase adding new tokens? And even so, it might not do anything
Nice pep talk but saying that it can easily crash to $2K (which is basically what you said) is not really encouraging to those with stubborn long positions at these current price levels.

But you are correct that even if the price is $2000 tomorrow, it is still huge gains in the past 9 years or so...both in price and adoption rates.  


This. This this this this this
china has a tightly controlled currency, cryptos going to do the most damage to their model.

As an absolute last resort, governments actually start trusting their own citizens.  That's when crypto will flourish.

Right now we're still in the delusionary period (that the genie can be stuffed back in the bottle).






How can we stay informed about this?
Bad news is "FUD" in this sub and FUD is not allowed.

Remember this is the sub that had auto-censor for the words "Ethereurm" and "Tether" for quite awhile.
Sure, but in what form?

Having fedcoin or Google Coin, registered to your identity on the blockchain really isn't what many of us signed up for.
When they all are neck deep into the "blockchain" hype, it will become self evident that the "global blockchain" that joins all the private blockchains is the real innovation here.

That's what happened with the private intranets and THE internet.
Because they won't be able to actually compete, they will be centralized shitcoins.
No centralized "blockchain" can compete for long term value with Bitcoin. Most of these blockchain initiatives are just hype anyhow. 
Yes of course...great point there.  And don't forget gov't issued coins....just legislate the competition.  Make it illegal and then your coin can thrive.
governments can only hinder adoption. not render it powerless.  

i'd love to see them put the money in to try before quantum computing becomes legit
[descending wedge](https://imgur.com/a/YEo3hfw)

We broke out of the big ascending one into the smaller descending one.

This pattern was broke already but we just re-entered it.
At least the lower bound is still intact and should provide support.

Hedge short = stay in fiat. I wouldn't enter into a large short with this RSI either.
oops
I'll try, but the train's scheduled for dump o'clock, so make sure you don't miss it.
I think you‚Äôre right. My finger is getting itchy. My last three trades have been terrible so I‚Äôm trying to make at least one good trade for the week 


Edit. I‚Äôm wondering what Asia is gonna do when they wake up. 
pretty much 
Hmmm maybe I‚Äôll wait until a get home from work.  I‚Äôll be driving soon and then reassess 
So true.  The bottom was the genesis block.  Since then all the "bottoms" have turned out to be not so bottomey.
Missed laptop mining BTC in 2010... the fuck.
I mean if you knew what it was at that time.  I found out at 2014 and bought in a good chunk and sold near the ATH and now I've just been chasing the good ol' high.
There are always some guys who buy the bottom. I bought the low in 2015 @$160 and it felt like harakiri. But nevertheless paid off well.

The market has changed since then.

* We've had the block reward halving since than. Which reduces sell pressure relative to 2015.
* We have a huge ALT-market, which works as an overflow valve for excessive speculation.
* We have matured markets and market participants who will reduce volatility (through leveraged shorting and longing).
* Mt. Gox like situation doesn't seem possible anymore including stolen coins sell-off thereafter.

Conclusion: as bubbles in Bitcoin are mainly a derivative of its underlying volatility I expect us to reach THE bottom quite earlier, than in 2015.

Still haven't bought in since I sold at $16k. There is still plenty of time to decide on a better entry. And even if we find a mid-term bottom here chances are high we go for a local top next instead of a new ATH.

My take away: Either the bottom is already in (spring/summer 2013 scenario) or we're heading for $4k+, and as everybody is looking for $4k I tend to believe we'll see a premium of around $1k to that estimate which could result in a bottom close to $5k.

The longer I think about it, the more sense it makes sense as it would bring in heavy shorting if $5.5k fails, which will as a side effect stabilize prices. Greedy money entered the game above $5k as well. So only old-timers and long-term investors will be left by the time we reach that zone. They won't miss the chance to load up on high value coins.
When the daily has barely any activity like in 2014, that's when you know we're at the bottom
So no real bottom ever?  If people were buying throughout 2014 and 2015 (which I assure you, we were) at what point do you think even more people will stop buying now?
Actually, we are only back to March rates.
I find the level of nonsense here at times ridiculous. Where do you get this shit? Google market cap if that‚Äôs what you are getting at. It‚Äôs not what you think it is
why should they be any different on average than a hodler?
thank you, we will take this into account in our future comments
On what exchange are you seeing the price go up? lol

it's a sea of red mate.. we're $70 above the bottom with longs increasing by the thousands
Assuming there still is a home after
Plus, it was posted one hour after the bottom so i also have my doubts

Bitcoin: ÀãChallenge accepted!¬¥
will not be at 4k tomorrow or the day after for sure. 
Imo there is very little to no justification for a huge drop like that ... I guess it could happen, but far more likely is that we continue to respect the uptrend. Again, not sure why anyone is concerned at this point.
Ok thanks I fixed it.  I guess just shows how quickly we dropped, that my mind hasn't totally adjusted yet.
Perfect comparison.

Ok, we‚Äôre do you think it will bottom out. Just curious to other people opinion
Hmm the bulls seem insulted 
I think you mean 8k. 
yea......he owes me a bitcoin! haha jaykay. He said he'll give me one if we ever go on another moon run. 
It was all a dream man! I underestimated the weak. Ohh ... the humanity. Sell or short, it's the only option.
Don't do it man! I know what you're thinking. We're going deep though. My new targets are $4.2, $42, $420, and $4200.

His books make wild assumptions and extrapolations based on incomplete data, which he spins into nice little catch-phrases. Lots of people, not just in crypto, blindly buy into concepts like "skin in the game" without considering that the idea is over-simplified and potentially not accurate or useful in application. Perhaps *refute* is the wrong word but very few in academia take this guy seriously and it's not because he throws fits and strokes his own ego nonstop, it's because his work is laughable.
Because Bitmex is illegal for Americans to use and the structure of the site is likely a scam intended to steal money from people.
Huge percentage of BitMex volume is wash trading by insiders.  The high volume is intended to lure people into the market that think its legitimate so that their money can be stolen from them through price manipulation on the exchange.  The site is a scam.

I might move it to $7554 but I'm going to let it sit for a bit.
Yeah, and why don't people sell at $9999 ? Much easier than $10,000.

Rude
Harry had a relative in crypto? Interesting.
phil quit?   oh shit.
Toilet paper is usd

the tether chart dipping to .999 for 24 hours, 2 days ago I didn't like the looks of it so I sold 1/2 my trading stack; the next day tether had that .99 spike and btc fell
I'm assuming he or she is referring to USDT/USD on Kraken.
Hahahaha why the downvotes cmon this guy nails it its fucking funny. I upvoted.
Nah I just figured this out couple weeks ago. Seriously, if u look at the weekly candles, you'll see how each subsequent wave is proportional to the previous one. It's like a rubber ball that was dropped. The bounces get smaller and smaller but have the same basic shape.
Lol sounds just like me on Feb 5
To put this in perspective, AAPL has more liquid CASH (almost all of it held off shore btw) than Bitcoin‚Äôs entire market cap.

We‚Äôre still early boys. Relax and BTFD. 
My bad. Typo. Now edited.

Yes not $1T, **$10T**.
good point. well if I'm able to accumulate more coins at 4k that'd be great but i don't think its realistic cause that would be like re-living through last summer
Agreed. It's supply and demand.  There's plenty of demand even at $7900.  That will only increase if we go down further, yours truly included.  Supply will run out too.  You can only dump so many coins before you have to a) cover or b) buy more to dump.

Whoever is dumping all these coins is fighting a raging current of demand.  The market wants to go up, and it will correct in that direction eventually.
Haha. It‚Äôs funny that you provided an explanation to my question as I was writing my question 
Why is it not realistic? We are still in an obvious downtrend from ath. It may take a long while to get there but 4k isn‚Äôt way out of the question. 
if it plays out like the 2014 bear market its actually exactly where we'll land.
Lol Truthfully ill be amazed if it goes into he low 7's
The selling pressure if we get back up to 8k will be massive.  If by some miracle we make it back to 9k it will probably shoot back down to 7k in like an hour.

LoL

why would I need upvotes? One comment in /r/funny and it will earn me 100 comment worth of Karma. Genuinely impressed with how the mods are keeping this sub clean compared to other subs, especially within these times that doom and gloom is in peak performance.
Your liquidation price is relative to the margin you used to open the position though. 

For a 50x, 2,000,000 position that's 5.33 BTC.

So a liquidation will reduce your account balance by 5.33 btc. 

Whereas a 2,000,000 position at 10x would require 26.65 btc to maintain. 

In the scenario I've outlined above, the liquidation scenario sees -5.33 btc as a result of the trade. 

Whereas the stop-loss slippage scenario that executes at $7,600 and fills with an average of $7,700 results in a loss of about -8 btc.

we'll be lucky if it stays over 360

anything under where I initially bought btc yes :p
Not seeing that. Sometimes there are local bugs. Have seen alerts from Coinbase about that on my phone.

Edit: Not recently but in near past
It will be difficult for it to push anywhere near $1K IMO.  I just feel people would hoard it up so hard once it starts getting anywhere near there.  The potential upside is quite obvious.  BTC can quite clearly gain momentum and push up to $20K and beyond again.

So when you get to levels like $2K, $3K, even $4K, it seems like quite a no-brainer long term.  If you have some money to throw around and you can get 25 BTC for $50K, why the hell not?  It would certainly be a reasonably possibility for BTC to retest the ATH at some point.  

So there's a reasonable chance BTC retests the ATH within the next 5 years.  Be conservative, say there's a 30% chance it reaches 80-100% ATH again.  Then if it does reach those levels, there's a 30% chance it surpasses the ATH and goes truly moonward, potentially up to $50K.  Certainly not something you could call "impossible".  That would be about a 9% chance BTC breaks $20K in the next 5 years.

And the downside?  Even in a conservative scenario, how could you expect BTC to spend any time below $1K?  It's had so much exposure this past year, and the amount of verified users on exchanges has surely increased exponentially since $1K was hit in Dec 2016, and dwarfs the verified users from Dec 2013 when it hit the $1k+ ATH.

So you have a situation where if BTC were to hit $2K, you have a small risk of losing half your investment, a risk that it trades sideways, and then a reasonable chance to 10X and beyond.  Even if you assume there's a 70% chance it drops to $1K and stays there on average, compared to a 30% chance to go beyond / retest ATH, say at an average price of $18K, then that's:

$2000 Initial Investment
$1000 * 0.7 = 700
$18000 * 0.3 = 5400
$6100 USD

So your EV on a $2K BTC over 5 years would be $6.1K.  And I'd say that's a conservative estimate.  So I just don't see how BTC could possibly spend a significant amount of time in the $1K - $3K region.  You'll attract so many hoarders at this point.  Something would need to go massively wrong to see these prices.  Either a massive stock market crash, or some sort of fundamental flaw in the cryptography behind BTC.
You could also say that 5-10-2014 was closer to $435 or ~37% of the ath or ~$7360, which is closer to where we were in early april before the bgd. I think the pump you see in late may 2014 is the equivalent of the pump to 10k. Of course the dates aren't going to align perfectly, that's just silly.

Also if you look at the daily rsi it reached overbought for the first time during that may 2014 pump, just like this 10k pump. Some bear hopium is that in 2014 we at least double topped before heading to goblin town and we have yet to bounce here.

yep may add to it at 7800, but 7725 is my line in the sand. If that crosses, I‚Äôll take a cool off period or may stop trading entirely until we go significantly below 7500
Only for BTC, didn't get around to doing the others yet. 

I'd say the top alts would be about 25% more volatile if not more.

In any case, I'm not adding here just yet because we're only at -6% or so, unless we see a substantial amount of longs closing. 
good! I would advise you to come back and take another 10% of your stack to try again, but if you get liquidated, I would stop entirely
Hint: that's his persona on these boards.
grow up
I think in this case it may be the problem that alot of these longs are underwater af while there are nearly 0 shorts to squeeze. Hence, we need some organic buying power and i don't think people are buying actual BTC atm. 
Dude, you're just upset because a week ago you were predicting the most explosive bull-run BTC has ever seen, and now here we are at 7.8k.

You seem like an emotional wreck whining about Bitmex on every post you can. Step away from the keyboard for a bit, or provide evidence.


My sentiment the last few days was that the buying frenzy on Bitmex was predicated on the assumption that, "falling below $7,800 is impossible." 

The futures market still appears to be stuck in that mindset...despite the fact that it happened. 

I'm really starting to wonder if they'll ever accept it, or if the premium will just continue to rise as the price falls. 
I just took 30% ROE on what was supposed to be a scalp. Might've been premature lol.
Lol, this is literally me. Constantly failing to pull the trigger when making the right call. Pull the trigger when making the wrong call. 
Yup lol. I think most people here would do better off if they just saw it as a very, very expensive hobby. No one would continually pour money into it if they stopped seeing it as a get-rich-quick thing and more as a fun thing to do and get better at
Well yes, of course, you'd spend money on things to develop your skills like any hobby. My point is more that people should stop seeing it as profitable and see it as a money drain at first. 
It's ok, many gamblers find it hard to admit they have a problem also...

Let's break down your comments:

\- **I don't post trades** \- why would I? I don't feel the need to prove myself among random people on the internet, meanwhile you circle jerk with the deity like "Chewy" and others, consistently losing money looking at your recent trades

\- **I don't contribute** \- you see I'd say I contribute a lot, in fact far more than you and many others.  You spend your time posting losing trades and drawing lines on a chart, throwing out bullish scenarios and being in a state of denial; yet myself and others have spent the past few weeks warning about exactly what is happening now. If people followed myself and others they would have profited significantly, as I have done...you can't argue with cold, hard, facts
Been silently lurking here every day, though posting less. Busy at my day job, plus my last couple of trades were not so smart, so I figured just holding should be my thing for a while.
Yeah I completely agree. Right now I'm sitting on a very comfortable position that I could ride for a few days. If we see 8.1 or thereabouts maybe I'll consider. 

Depends how slow the day looks scalping a few movements might be a nice bonus. You still using crazy leverage on those? Or that was a one time hit it and quit it.


$7000-$7200 seems to be crucial for me as well as others looking at a longer investment timeframe but the question remains does the general public, Mom and pop retailers even care? Where is the interest? Where is the volume? If we keep on relying on short squeezes BTC price has to go much lower. There has been mostly good news about bitcoin and prices have reacted negatively. 
FWIW, it also made sense to bounce at the 61.8% retrace of the runup from the local low of 6425 to 9990.

Yeah it is interesting.  I'm not expecting this to hold us up for too long though.  If we make it through today (*big if*), then maybe it'll hold till the weekend.
Thank you very much. I really appreciate it. I knew it held some similarities to ARK (was an investor early on with them) but the contextual commentary is appreciated. I actually picked up some LSK on this drop, as I have been interested in awhile and it seemed oversold. I will be looking into it a lot. Thanks again, best of luck. 
Snuck in a cheeky little add at 7620, and will probably just cut the entire position if we go above 7650/7700 to be safe, but at this point the upwards movement hasn't been very convincing. 
Where are u placing your stops for your short? At B.E? 
it kind of is more of a bear flag though. Not a pennant but just a flag. Although I do sort of agree that if we bust thru $7650 we'll get to $7740-7800ish

This is not the sub to ask those questions. 
Say what now?
Tbh it's hard to be a good trader when you trade on whole market. I used to trade alts but I ended up missing entries on BTC and alts, to many charts to follow. I stick to BTC now, yeah, it moves slower but at least that's only one chart to follow.
It all comes with experience man, I went through a similar state last year. Now, if my personal indicators are showing that BTC will dump then I'll liquidate my alts, for a small loss because I do tend to hold just in case, but in the end I buy back in at a cheaper price. I did it this morning just in time before the drop to $7900.
Sorry, let me provide a visual (4h) - https://www.tradingview.com/x/For3W2pX/

I had been watching a falling wedge for some time.  The break up and out was a good time to go long, but the subsequent return has been very bearish.  I've also marked a potential downtrend channel, in the event I'm way off and the upcoming price action doesn't match with a failed breakout of a wedge.  In either case, doesn't look good.
He's talking about the bigger falling wedge in blue (starts at 9950)

He might be talking about this formation on the 6h:

Gonna fake out a  BGD over 8000 and stop the chewtoy's cultists.. says the manipulator whale..HA!
If you don't mind me asking, what's the bot that people use to follow your's and other Bitcoinmarket's orders? I'm not on an exchange that gives an option to short, but I am curious for when the call would be once a reversal happens. Thanks.
And you always come back and fill out your thoughts. It's more that you've established a better pattern of behavior and less that you have a different status. Poorly worded by me.
Before it was edited it was just a position.
It doesn't seem like a low effort post to me either....
Once 7500 broke I was expecting much more serious downside action. Not mad about it though. As always, thanks for your input chew!
would you long at 7300 with stops to 6900 and take profit at 7500 and reverse to a short at 7800?
Dear Chew, do you think you'd long the corn ever again? :-P
looking to reopen shorts any time soon?
When?  Two years from now?
Yeah, it all depends how you draw things, that channel support that we broke, I don't believe it was a support, so my line is it's resistance.
We are getting rejected by the 15m Ichimoku cloud (which i know very little of) and should have another test around 7915 within 1 hour.

If it does indeed respect the Ichimoku resistance than after that is 7870 and decreasing so we either break 7800 or enter the cloud to go test 8k.

The pump seems to have stopped so it wasn't the usual 200$ dildo so yes, a short around 7915 should be great. Had a small limit sell @ that level but only a third hit. lets see if it wicks there again
It's now at 8.1 on June, so like 8020 spot I guess? I was fairly aggressive yesterday with adding to it and am definitely overleveraged. Should've taken some profit last night but oh well. Will set tight stops and will still end up in profit, just less, if this blows up on me. 

Future premiums are concerning, blowing up with every little sign of hope.
Every coin I buy during the dips, isn't available for trading anymore. Bit by bit, piece by piece.

For at least 2-3 years, maybe even longer...
Yes, everybody and their mother is watching the same tightening range on the weekly
Eh mixing time scales like that I believe opens up all sorts of see what you want to see bullshit
Hahaa! You be the judge of that!
Almost 10k fresh longs have opened since first of may, all underwater. But ye probably very low leverage, still probably a lot of sweaty palms out there today
Yeesh, I suppose that's possible. It does seem like a 100% retracement from 4/12 gains (sub 7K) might finally shake them. We'll see. 
How will you choose when to exit your short on this?  It seems like there is a good chance for a bounce coming up, just based on the fact that there haven't been any real bounces on the way down over the last day2, I could imagine that both shorters and prospective longs will see that as a new change in momentum.

The lower we go the higher pressure a bounce off support will be, and as some point it won't be a DCB but a full blown recovery, right?  Less BGD and more FOMO.

Thanks, just trying to learn!
And now 400,000 found coins have been/are going to be dumped.
You are trying to argue points I didn't make. All I said is if op thinks we are in a similar situation as 2014, then 5k won't be the bottom.
Fundamentally we better, sure. But the price is also significantly higher. So that may be priced in. 
> Fundamentally things are different as well. Back then, 400,000 stolen coins were being dumped. A lot of coins are being dumped now, but many of them will have to be bought back. The market was much smaller back then in terms of the number of participants and the amount of money involved.

Back then, China, India, Iran (10+ other countries), Twitter, Google, Facebook, etc had not banned Bitcoin and other crypto.

That is 10x worse than a few coins being temporarily dumped on the market.
thx
He‚Äôs a cock
How did prior scenarios play out where we had such a ratio? When we hit $5.8k in feb and $6.5k in April?
Excuse the noob question but what does BGD stand for? Thx 
Thanks
Yeah a lot of indicators are pointing towards that range. If we stabilize there for a bit I'll probably add to my long. For now it seems the express to goblin town. 
Only time will tell.

For now, longing seems like trying to dodge a bullet from point blank range

For real...  I guess I'm stuck in the position I'm at for now....
Yeah percentage wise it could be worse. I feel the bulls have used up all their ammo this go around and now needs to go back to drawing board. Do you have a target? I think we might bounce up to low $8K around and then finally go to no man's land. I don't think it will happen on this drop just because it would be too obvious.
I've found a minority of users mistake my own humor for mod abuse... and lately there's been drama around my mod powers... and I'd rather quit moding than have people thinking I'm abusing them.

With shit posting, there are brief periods where I'll strongly enforce rule 3 so as to cut down on the number of repeat comments that have no quality. Today, some people got upset about me giving up and other people got upset because shit posting [Edit, even my own] got out of hand. [Edit: I was also criticized for threatening to enforce in the sticky]

So, I do take a nuanced approach, but as a sub I think we need to develop an identity around this issue so that there's some basis for my actions. Are we upvoting or downvoting shit posts? Do we care if we turn into a troll box? What are we willing to give up in order to maintain the sub the way we want it?

We can't have it both ways. I need direction on this.
Rules in the sidebar. (the lack of) Clear enforcement policy seems to be the primary source on unnecessary drama in my mod duties.

Also, it really isn't possible to consistently enforce. Some people don't get caught. It's the internet and mods aren't perfect.
I agree. Heavy handed moderation to aggressively filter out shills and FUDsters would be great. Also remove people who just post the same shit over and over. 

Someone other than me needs to debate you on this.
Nah, that'll attract shit in general to this sub.  They should take it to the actual trollboxes elsewhere.
We can only have 2 stickies.
I'm not into taking a democratic approach to this. It's not like I can verify that any given poll is an accurate representation of participants. I'm hoping we can all have a "come to Jesus" moment by way of discussion, instead.
That shouldn't be happening here. If I feel influenced by bias in any way I kick it over to the other mods. I think they do the same. For example, I was not involved with the decisions to restore gypsy and I wasn't involved in the decision to ban DushmanKush. I shared my thoughts, but otherwise stayed out of those decisions.

In any case, if you feel like a ban is improper we're happy to review and lift the ban.
I've been trying to post in there more. It's perceived to be the wasteland that it is. My hope for what it can be and what it is are at odds. Everyone who wanted that thread assumed the conversation for the daily would spill over. 

It's not working (so far?). Encouraging alt discussion to move over there is universally resented, but if people don't move the alt discussion from this thread to that thread then the thread is fucked.
I really hate giving those two out. It's uncommon to get more than a warning or 1 day ban, though.

Even when I fast track people I'll try to give out less than a 7 day ban.
Would you be okay with unbanning DushmanKush if he apologized to you? 
You weren't kidding about being over-leveraged. Holy shit dude. That's one way to rebuild your stack. (Generally a much better way to lose your stack, but golf clap on it working out).
So you are at like 600% ROE. Dude....
well I guess that got answered.
Going down with crypto. Solidarity at its finest. Or just "Planned Maintinance" like bitmex
To the downvoters, the Chinese have been responsible for extreme volatility in btc for years. Nothing has changed. Those fucks are still the fly in the ointment.
I may close the scalp there. lol 148% ROE so far (it might be 40x). 
I may close the scalp position on swaps down there. Not planning to close my futures short for a while yet.
That's just personal risk tolerance. IMO if we drop below 6900, there's little reason we stop there. That is a 100% retrace of *all* the gains since the epic short squeeze. I'm not sure why we'd do all this and then bounce off 6700. 
Inverted Bart incoming on the 1D candles.
Your dad and I should go bowling.
got it. smart
I know advice is not always appreciated, but I urge you to take breather and not chase entries. I typically get wrecked immediately following great trades because I get overconfident. You had a huge win today and it's fairly likely the market will give you another good entry in the coming hours/days. Again, just a word from someone who has doubled his stack in 1-3 days about 4 times and proceeded to lose 25%-50% of those gains the following day chasing. Every time, except this one (so far). 
Loosen up your stops. Don't be greedy with stops is my mantra. I either breakeven or win a lot. None of that 2-3% profit bullshit 

Look at all the cats here getting pushed out of their shorts. but they missed a move from $9900-7500 now

Yeah zoom out to when the bubble clearly started to pop in January...that's the range you should be interested in
Using Eve's bottom to our 9K run I have .618 about where we are right now. Which is also lining up nicely with the bottom of the kumo 
https://www.tradingview.com/x/6Vheaamj/
!long XBTUSD add 7646 10%


Just realize what a good call this was, right on target.
Nice entry there. 

If the price can somehow hold at around $7500 for the next few hours, some more bargain hunters will probably come in.
And?
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
So theoretically the answer is yes. The idea is to trade during accumulation and distribution phases of the market and view the actions of the market as a whole as the behavior of a single individual (the composite man). The trick is looking at when and where those overbought and oversold areas of the market occur. A great free resource is: 

http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:market_analysis:the_wyckoff_method 

I generally use Wyckoff with Point and Figure to swing trade.
I've also seen the opposite scenario play out, where shorts vastly out numbered longs and the price still shit the bed as shorts covered. Point is, this entire market is manipulated by the whales. The short/long ratio is folks placing their bets on their next moves.
Of course, that's the rationale of a well oiled, logical, liquid market... 
bro shorts are down to 19.6k VS 33k longs..there is nothing to cover lol
3.3 lev, do you know the math or have a formula?
7707* grains
No I'll just set a stop buy and let it ride. May change it to a trailing stop.

Trying to not over-trade, so once it stops out, I'll take a step back and re-assess.
yes from 7905
Yes, it will only be possible for it to drop to 3.3K if it's long and drawn out.  It needs to get to a point where people actually just lose faith entirely.  

If the price continues a steady decline for another 1-2 years and we eventually fall on 3.3K after some more bouncing around, while at the same time seeing alts drop to the floor, and many not ever recovering, that is when 3.3K happens.  If you still have the balls to throw money in at that point, you should be rewarded.  But it won't appear to be such an easy decision by the time it happens.
That makes sense, but do you have any idea yet as to a downside target? Are you expecting us to still go substantially lower? 
oooh okay. That changes things.
Anything above 50% would be considered ‚Äúreally good‚Äù, in this context I think.  

Especially since there are profitable traders with success rates below 50%, and many non-profitable traders as well obviously.  
Appreciate it 
But need to remember that sometimes oversold is ticking time bomb. It goes sideways to cool off a bit and give signal to buyers that sell off ended. Then we have a BGD.

Psychologically, a lot of people burned trying to buy the dip on drops from ATH, now they learned that need to wait for sell off to end instead of catching the falling knife.
Very Insightful, I appreciate your reply.
and he's always selling his bch for btc.
Perfect. 
You know me. 
Very long. Can effort it. 
Same I did when we were at 600$
No worries.

Sorry.. I never said: Bears are in trouble. 
I too am buying
Shit ton of resists overhead (old falling wedge support & resistance, Eth 600 .5 fib retrace level, 8k horizontal). Good luck tho, don't really like seeing this thing go to shit.  But if Chew says short, I'm inclined to trust his read more than some others here.
The number of posts that seem to be disconnected from reality and still getting upvoted are on the rise.
Because we still have the same low as in February, the 200 MA is still sloping upwards (although it's flattening), there was a 100% move after the February low and another 50% in April. We have been going sideways for 4 months, not down. That's the reality. 

A bear market will mean breaking the February low and many more lows after that with a downward sloping 200 MA and without those sweet 50% or more swings in between. 
bitcoin corrections don't last more than a month or two, this is a bear market
No, it's 5 months of indecision. It can be just a long consolidation and break upwards eventually and make new ATH's in 2018. Or it can become a bear market and drop down and remain down for a year or more. Nobody knows for sure. 
People will not like to hear it, but yes. Exactly what I am expecting too. And it might set in panic as well later in this descendance and then we really see ugly days. 
I think it's pretty easy to comprehend the users comment?

\- They are not referring to themselves being in a world of pain

\- They are referring to the legions of delusional people here who cry 'recovery' at every tiny pump

Its a good quote but the place we are in now is more important 

> Wave 2: Wave two corrects wave one, but can never extend beyond the starting point of wave one. Typically, **the news is still bad**. As prices retest the prior low, **bearish sentiment quickly builds**, and **"the crowd" haughtily reminds all that the bear market is still deeply ensconced**. Still, some positive signs appear for those who are looking: [volume should be lower during wave two than during wave one](https://www.tradingview.com/x/2wcJp82h/), **prices usually do not retrace more than 61.8%** (see Fibonacci section below) of the wave one gains, and prices should fall in a three wave pattern.

We are at 61.8% now but it is important to note we could still go lower before we continue.
Technically it already broke and I was pretty underwhelmed by the stop losses. I doubt there‚Äôll be a significant cascading effect if we do it again.
Sausage sales aren't decentralized.   Anyway, I still don't get it.   It doesn't sound like true decentralization if it's owned and ran by a central authority/company.
Got source? Can only find a Twitter confirmation for OMG...hm wonder how the pump will be
[deleted]
Well, I'm opinionated. But who else here isn't... ;-)
Wall Street bonuses will pump the peso
I expect upwards movement, so I jump into the elevator once it hits the ground floor. Im going up. I hate walking up.  


I root for a bounce right around this area we're at.  


My guess means nothing, though. I am 50&#37; certain Im wrong.
Ok I agree that one was a little too snarky.  I edited it, so it's more reasonable.
Rule 1
All we have sometimes are the technicals and indicators and have to make a bet when odds are in our favor, even if it doesn't eventually work out.  

I'm just not sure where to set a stop for a long here.  

And you always want to have a stop in mind or things can get way of control, very quickly.  I've made that mistake many times in the past, but not so much recently.
You aren't a holder if you are shorting.  Shorting is the opposite of holding.

And you aren't a holder if you are paying taxes, because taxes are only owed on realized gains, and you don't owe those from holding.
I love how you get downvoted because people dislike how correct you've largely been since January. You can have the most innocuous comment, and you get a flurry of downvotes because people see you as a sort of perma-bear force causing their gainz to magically evaporate...
Here I am. January 2014. I join reddit a few months ago but I read these posts since 2017.
Yes they are.  They make up 90% of the posts during a bull market run.
90% of my holdings are in cold storage and will stay there even if we go to $1. 

Edit. Translation:  I can be a stubborn mofo 
true, thats why I think its a good idea to start scaling in now
So true. The bottom was the genesis block. It's been all up since then.
With empirical data.  And from the chart.
That's very bold, the very nature of BGD is that it is unpredictable. Hopium comes from market fundementals. We hear only good news and the whole cryptoverse is maturing rapidly. And we already experienced a capitulation phase but for some people it was not enough, or the original BGD burned them so bad they want revenge, therefore they still want to see BTC down in goblin town so their bias is satisfied. On the other hand, the bulls still don't get that 20k BTC was an abomination of FOMO by the masses that was ridiculous and we may needs years to reach there, but that does necessarily requires a bear market.

Thanks for the reply, really appreciate it.

And is it correct to assume that the rates are dropping because people are selling back into tether to sit this out?
The sentiment in this sub seems to suggest otherwise. Very interesting.
you mean those are scalping longs? I doubt it. 
I get you are obsessed with whether it can be "killed' or not...if Bitcoin and other crypto can be irradiated from the earth so there is not one trade or transfer or utterance of his name.  That's great if that's your fetish....but no one else cares.

What matters is real gov't regulation and banning cryptocurrency, so it becomes very difficult and illegal to obtain it...that buying and selling it becomes illegal and there is the danger and reality of prison for those who break these laws.

This has dramatically limits usage and adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency and that is what has been done.  It lead to lower market prices as there are less people holding and buying BTC than would be without the regulations and restrictions and bans and penalties.

The fact that Bitcoin permabull cultists even argue against this point just shows how utterly and totally delusional they are.

And I don't say "Blockchain not Bitcoin".  

I use Bitcoin and i understand the benefits of using cryptocurrency that still remain at this point in the USA.  However if I try to sell a friend $1 in Bitcoin, I can be imprisoned.  So I wisely decide not to do that.
I have no idea what you said there.  
Ok we live in a different reality if you think China and India bans are insignificant.
That's just a rough trend, not a price target.
Well, I got it from here. So I guess it has happened before...

Has anyone been able to determine if the mt gox trustee has been selling his coins the last few weeks steadily driving down the price?
yea lots of us were confused and said nothing really warranted it but whatever. at the top (~$9700) I told people to reign in their emotions and not be greedy but meh people don't listen 
 !long xbtm18 close 7880
Atleast he will get a place on the bitmex rekt hall of fame
My money....

Bought at 600$... whats your problem / point?
Not far off actually. It WAS sparked by a whale (whale referring to a trader, or group of traders). It's relatively easy to drive the price down, hunt liquidations, use that to fuel your red candle, and reload at the bottom.

These are low liquidity games. When it's most profitable to drive the price down, you better believe the big players will do it. When it's more profitable to ride the wave up, they'll do that too.

I'm NOT saying we'd moon if not for this/these actor(s) . The reason they can do this is *because* we were in a period of stagnation and low volume.

Edit: quick lesson here: you remember those huge wipeout candles, right? The price suddenly spikes/dips a hundred points or more in one candle, just to essentially end up where it started. They clear liquidity on both sides of the books. But, why?

The actor here gains a competitive advantage over the rest of the market. The market sees what happened. We see the volume, the price range, etc. But the actor here now has data that *nobody else has*: they know exactly how much of that volume was their own, and exactly how many buys/sells were wiped out (read: where the liquidity is).  This competitive edge is enough to make you a lot of money if you use it right. 

You'll notice that these candles are precursors to larger moves. The direction is determined by the data collected in the wipeout candle by the player.  It's not quite as simple as "how many buys and sells were there", but you can think of it that way and be on the right track.

Make no mistake, this market IS manipulated by whales. We are at their mercy. The lower the volume, the more true this is. If you want to make money in this market right now, think about what they're after.
2 points of contact is not really ideal. But if you chart the downtrend on the monthly the intersection is also july 1st. 
Is using linear and log charts to create a single trend lines a thing?
Yep. Just making the point that since March we've had plenty of times where we've wicked out of the BBands by up to 10&#37; and still closed the day near them or within them.
No it hasn't, you just see the posts more 
Also, you're acusing me of mod abuse here... which I take pretty seriously. Do you really think I'm showing favoritism to Bulls? If so, how and where?
You should read the FAQ there sometime.
Game theory tells me that 7.3 will be a bounce as people anticipate it bouncing 7.2...on the other hand it could still go as low as 6.8
Well, to be perfectly honest, I'm not in such a nice position. 

I'm actually nearly 20% down right now. 

I started to buy in December, and have been adding every dip since then to average my costs down.

And yes, sometimes I felt like curling up in a corner.

But I learned a lot about the tech. I'm convinced that there's a huge chance that it will revolutionize the way we transfer value. And that the price will reflect that in the future.
Tongue in cheek. Waiting for the 7000-6800 range. 
Thats my point. TA is a joke lol
Exactly. I target a certain % down for the alts I want to buy from the average of the last upswing (~8.6). When that number hits, I buy, incorporating BTC momentum for +/- a few % points. 
We think very similarly. 
It should go down a bit further from here, maybe 6.9.  But it will rocket back up because these dumped coins were borrowed and will need to be bought back.
Well we have a couple touches now forming an ascending trend line... so if we fail to break $7650, then I'll short when price falls off the trend line.  Obviously I'd prefer a higher entry.  Not interested in opening a long right now despite crazy low RSI
you can't possibly compare the volume in the forex market to crypto.
This is much more clean looking than a bear flag where the resistance slopes up / support goes horizontal.  You don‚Äôt have to cut out wicks either.

Thanks Fire 
Rule 1
[removed]
May I ask Why there? I'm not seeing any resistances there?

I'm also looking for an exit on my trading long, but can't really decide where.
makes me sad.  I just wish we could get this over with, but it looks like it may be drawn out over a period of months. 
[deleted]
Hence if it's a capitulation wick, if we break to 5500 and fail to garner any serious bounce in the subsequent days I'd consider it pretty bearish in the long run with 10k being months in the future not weeks. 
No thanks I'm full.
Longs have rised again to 32k hoping for a short squeeze. Shorts haven't, or not to a level that seems very interesting to squeeze. Retail isn't buying, the little green you see are shorts closing and longs opening mostly. Conclusion : very unconvinced this will bounce, very possible the longs squeeze will resume once RSIs are reset.
No, you can use your own logic in the laws of momentum though.
Even if true; it‚Äôs not a reason to poke with a stick is it. 
Yup.  When did two weeks become a "trend?"  I have been very disciplined during this dump, resisting the urge to buy.  Hope it gets to my limit.  Feels like it will.  There will have to be a big bounce at some point pretty soon because nobody can sell this much BTC without having borrowed some.
Lol thats the trend? 
Yeah but 6.5k was obviously an accumulation zone. This just looks like normal trading. I mean I am still long I hope you're right but I don't see any significant bounce here. Nor do I see accumulation. Big market buys and sells happen often enough. You can't just say Canadians this Canadians that. This ain't south park.
You're joking right man..? lol 200 btc is nothing...

why are you always trying to trade the opposite of the trend
Oops, I meant lower highs. Thanks for the correction
That's the thought process behind my 7000ish Alamo/last stand comment. We'll see if we even get that low or if the market defends 7600. I don't think it will for long, personally. 
Wasn't 4/1 6600?  I look for that three higher-lows magic.  If 7500 is the bottom of this dump, things are looking up.
Yes, the 5800 low in Feb and the 6400 low in Apr should translate into a 7000 low here. If we retest low 6000s (which I inferred from his "triple bottom" phrasing), then we should break it this time or the next if we make another lower high. 
[removed]
Only that my take is that once a zone has been tested, then it is weaker the next time price gets there
Not having much luck with BetTheBank? Why not try RandomRedditStrategy. One weird trick that increased the size of my stack!
My pro status is confirmed.
I actually just accidentally closed my futures because I opened it a long position just under 7600 on the wrong contract... Guess I'll keep my perps one open until we see a decent bounce as long as funding is in my favor even though the rate is low with a breakeven stop. None of the time frames look that good at the moment (but then that's when you get the best entries) IMO. Loosing 8200 area isn't good since thats a major level for volume traded. Ichi doesn't look good TDI are giving bearish trades on pretty much all TFs. The MAs don't look great on higher timeframes. Lower highs. There are bullish divergences but it feel to me like it's in dangerous territory now and the bulls aren't buying to hold we got big players they're buying to mark up and sell back still but I think that will only happen until it becomes too risky and lowering price increasing longs and decreasing price is pretty damn bearish.
If we bounce hard off >7200 back up to 7800, then dip to 7600, we'll see long pile on to extreme rates. It's basically the inversion of the BGD setup. 
I don't think it has much chance, personally, by BTC is a fickle mistress. *If* you believe BTC is going to succeed long term, $7K is probably not a terrible place to hold. If you got out at 7800 and back in there, you've increased your stack 10%. Not bad. 
how did this even happen? I was gone for a month or so, last I remember jared was nominated the "tough on low\-effort posts" moderator
not today =\(
yeh im thinking a little more room below before buyers takeover
People don‚Äôt change, markets don‚Äôt change. Emotions run high during our downtrend. The strong traders come out ahead while sheep get slaughtered.

And no I‚Äôm not joking.
I would personally trade not over 5x-10x (and even that is already alot !). If you change the leverage via slider, the only thing that will change is your liquidation price going down, and you free some initial margin (aka: you lose less btc, but you get liquidated faster). I would not recommend it, since at something like 50x a 2% move will get you a special announcement from the bitmexREKT bot.
Right now, your liquidation should be around 8200 (25x @ 7932). If you move the slider to 50x right now, your liquidation is giong to drop to about 8050.

If your stops are at break even (or at least a little below 8050), the liquidation point won't make a big difference since your stops would trigger before liquidation anyway. That being said, I don't think preemptively changing the leverage is a great idea, especially when you're talking about 50x. It just adds unnecessary risk/stress to the position at this point. 

If you wait for a drop to 7750 to bump the leverage up, you'll have a little more cushion to work with (still not great, but better). Your CA will be about 7835 and liquidation would be about 7950. 

You can certainly do it without losing money if you're using really tight stops, but you'll need to decide if doubling the size of your short is worth potentially botching an otherwise profitable trade by getting stopped out early.

Wouldn't be worth it to me, but you do you.
You can.. and I would suggest not doing it.. until you are very versed in the process and extra risks 
Right, basically, if the ETH/BTC ratio is more or less static while BTC is dumping, it's probably isolated to people's opinions of just BTC. When the ETH ratio is dropping along with BTC it indicates crypto as a whole is tanking.

On tradingview you can type BTCUSDSHORTS or BTCUSDLONGS to see the respective charts
I have no record of that position being updated. If you do multiple position changes (add, profit) you can issue an update command before closing like ! short btcusd update XXXX 5x and that will update your leverage and set your average value to XXXX.

If you do the add command the site will recalculate your average, just need something like ! short btcusd add XXXX 1x and it will add 1X (in this case) to your total leverage @XXXX and recalculate the average.

We get it, you work for Coinbase.
True. Just noticed that. That's actually a nice feature 
I'm 22% in the red on a USD long, 16% in the red on an EUR long.

I honestly don't believe I'll see break-even this year - and it's too late to cut my losses so I have no choice but Hodl or be liquidated when the price moves down another 30% (which it probably will, as there are no people saving money weekly into Bitcoin (like should happen organically by now))
come on mate, it was sarcastic
thanks
And that changing what I said why?
Something between 1300 and 3000 for me..
Hi there mate, yes ETH/USD broke down from a H&S yesterday.  But the H&S we're talking about here ("If you look at it's history, it's never rolled over after a big run. Always a blow off top or a H&S.") is a potential one forming on the ETH/BTC chart.

That was a reason to wait before shorting the ETH/BTC ratio.

And also the chart I posted suggests that ETH is slightly less bearish than BTC when you compare them against USD (if you consider long term moving averages and their setups on the respective charts). Another reason to wait a while before shorting the ETH/BTC ratio.

Hope that clears it up for you!
It will do very little damage.  People will not use it and risk imprisonment.
then dont. still will benefit the ecosystem
I agree. Still doesn't make it bullish news though.
Yes they can hinder adoption, which leads to lower prices.
would also not hedge my Bitcoins now, if I would have some.... we get a small bounce sooner rather than later. 
Perhaps try to trade the trend 
Are we there yet?

try 6 digits brah
50 week MA dude, look it up and see where we bounced from it last time. don't think it will reverse here but its not a bad buy
What uptrend are you looking at man? We violated the parabolic advance in December. The target back then was $4K which seems pretty darn close to Peter‚Äôs updated target of $3,500 IF (big if) we break down from this symmetrical triangle.

Also, symmetrical triangles are CONTINUATION patterns. Meaning we‚Äôll likely continue to drop since that was the trend prior to formation of said symmetrical triangle.

Little to no justification? Ha...
Except it's not, because the kid gets into horrific falling accidents every couple of years and ends up climbing an even bigger tree after a brief recovery.

I guess he can regenerate limbs and the doctor should stfu because clearly we are dealing with a mutant.
$5638.45, money back guarantee
17k
Or when we drop back to $10? ;-)
Are you sure it's not just 420?
I'm in academia.
>Because Bitmex is illegal for Americans to use and the structure of the site is likely a scam intended to steal money from people.

Are you aware that not everyone on the internet is American?

The structure of the site is a scam? I'm not even sure what you're saying here. It's only "likely" if you have some kind of rationale for this.
It is not.
Sounds like someone got liquidated. 

I dunno man, I feel like I'm stealing coins from them.  
Dude I‚Äôve traded there for well over a year, back when the liquidity was so bad you had $50 spreads on futures. When I market bought on perps id move the price 0.5% Lol.  The rise in liquidity has been perfectly natural, I‚Äôve seen it happen in real time.
It's high volume because right now, someone with $80 can trade with 1 BTC.
No, it's boasting, and it's mean spirited. A number of people are living out a nightmare right now and you've decided that this isn't a place that's okay for them to communicate about that.
Please report bull boasting. I take a lot of that down, but it's hard to keep up with sometimes. It's not a small task to keep up with.
"Accio Tether"
yep. thats why bitcoin is so magical.

no more phil potter magic is bad news
I wouldn't be alarmed until Tether drops to .94 or so....well before that, but it naturally fluctuates a good bit around $1.0000000
yes I lol'd on that one. 
I'm disappointed because even though I cashed out up 300% in March, I could have cashed out more than double that in Jan. Got greedy with "this time it's different/broke out of the beartrend" hivemind mindset and got burnt again. I need to go exercise
But based on that nor is $40k ‚Äúway out of the question‚Äù.

His point is that posting fantasy scenarios as if they are fact has little value.

120 million dollars per day is flowing into BTC and the market is growing on top of that.  4k is never going to happen.  It could have happened two months ago but not now.
This is worth a read on it works https://medium.com/@Austerity_Sucks/why-you-should-never-use-your-liquidation-price-as-a-stop-loss-on-bitcoin-futures-30655f280ddd

In isolated margin situations (not cross) you will not lose more than the posted margin, your account balance can only be reduced by the posted margin. This is the idea behind isolated margin. Remeber you get liquidated before your position goes bankrupt, however, if you get liquidated the engine will ALWAYS keep the difference. If you hit stops and there is a chance you can fill some of the order before your bankruptcy price then you keep the difference, if you get slippage the position is liquidated anyway and the insurance fund pays the difference.
my name on there is korean as fuck it's funny
Exactly 
Going long in an obvious bear market...wise move
lol I'm holding mine. Willing to ride a bounce to break-even up at 7850, but I don't think it's coming yet, not with the rapidity that 7700 fell. We'll see. 
just go away bro

you‚Äôre a waste of time. I didnt even read your comment, I never do, unless it‚Äôs one sentence

Cant imagine why anyone would
Fair enough, the chop has been brutal, opened a long this morning but really sub-optimal entry, will probably try to exit at BE, as I'm not really seeing a bounce and look for another entry lower. 


I ran 50x on the movements from 8100-8000 and 8000-7900 with my mouse hovering over market close. Now I'm only running 10x and babysitting less. It's a small amount compared to my primary position, but I'm net up 5% on stack with the 2 wins form last night. I've got an entry right about where we are, but it may have been premature. I could see a climb to 7900-7950. 
Wait, people actually buy bitcoin? They don‚Äôt just trade it?

But seriously, I agree. That‚Äôs why I was a bit suspicious when people thought the latest pump was the start of a new bull run. My guess is, once the price stops falling so hard and people feel comfortable investing again, we can find a solid floor for smart money to start buying back in. Each pump this year has gotten fewer and fewer people to FOMO in, so my guess is that whales will likely start to accumulate for a number of months in the hopes of starting a new long-term bullish cycle. That may not be until the end of 2018 or in 2019 at the soonest though, if we‚Äôre being honest with ourselves here.

There are a lot of solid fundamental reasons to invest in both bitcoin, as well as many up-and-coming alts though. It is much harder to invest in the stock market, at least in America, and crypto offers many would-be investors to put money into pursuits they believe in. It‚Äôs a promising, albeit heavily manipulated market, that I believe many potential young investors are still interested in despite the recent price action.

What are your thoughts?
Absolutely. Happy to give you some thoughts on it. 

BTW I think the way ARK handles DPOS is far superior to LISK. Happy trading and best of luck.
The one from 7620 or the one from 8310?
Triangles are continuation patterns, and this would be a reversal, so I'm probably off base. 
There is blood in the streets, I have always done well getting in then.   Can it go lower? Ya, but I see us on the lower end.  Anything is possible, I dont see 3k but anything is possible.   Through out Bitcoin's history we're on one of the biggest crashes/ corrections, so ya I think DCA is smart.  You have to remember its not a traditional market so you gotta be more forgiving if it drops 50% which is insane but compare that to when it goes on a real run and theres no question for me.  Insitutional money is getting in left and right and just starting, we're so early it's insane. 
Thanks mate, will check it out :) 
Forgot that doesn't work, it's called "visible range". 
I believe its been banned over 10 times. So it's at least 1000% illegal at this point.
Are you kidding me? So we aren't allowed to joke on 2nd level child comments now?

I can understand top level comments should be quality posts, I can understand bans on shilling or not being nice to others, but come on, chill out a bit.

We could argue here if this was a joke, shit post or reference to BTC being immune to FUD as we were waiting for this drop to happen, so China banning Bitcoin now would probably have the same effect but the point is that users like binaryechoes who mostly post shit like 'we'll never see x again' or 'this is all over' are posting their shit all the time and still coming back but users like dushman who was harsh as hell but actually posted a lot of good content got banned.
There‚Äôs a tiny /s
really, if you think BTC is going down you should just put in small shorts on alts. If you think it's going sideways or if alts have completely capitulated, put in small longs on alts. no TA really necessary lol it seems like it plays out the same over and over
Huh but what would you usually do after BTC and alts have dumped already like in this case? BTC looks like it has some room to fall further so not sure if I should even liquidate now before a bounce possibly happens 
Oof, yeah that‚Äôs pretty ugly. Thanks for sharing that image, I hadn‚Äôt seen that one yet.

The margin for error is too high. 

I've definitely been overtrading lately, and I'm trying to take the approach of "less is more" in regards to trades over the next few weeks.
Of course! 

Buyers just need to, you know, keep buying. 
lol. Sure.
Just curious--why don't you think that was channel support? 5+ touches? Genuinely interested in your take.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/1CrqCu30/
I know (based on your other posts) that you could use a good win. I'd encourage you to set your stops above likely resistance/wicks, but in profit. On June futures, I'd look 8054ish. The good news on this is that all the overhead resistance lines are downward sloping. If you can survive any retests over the next hour or two, you should be able to creep your stops down. It's a hard call to make. I've been stopped out of so many positions trying to protect profit and ignoring resistance lines. I've learned to either set stops up where I expect them to only be triggered if I will be happy they triggered or else just close the position where it is. 

edit: if this zone doesn't hold, I'd want to bail. But I'd want to survive wicks up into it. Hence >8050 (7975 spot)

https://www.tradingview.com/x/GVs450fr/
This is what I'm talking about. Those who see value in investment vehicles don't risk losing it. BTC prices in 10 years will dwarf the prices of 2017. 
What's your mother's TA on it?

Mine bearish but she keeps calling it buttcoin so I'd take her opinion with a grain of salt.
I'll probably hold this one until $8,000+ to the upside, and look to close around $7,300 or $7,100. 

There's absolutely no logical reason why buyers should be able to pull this back above $8,000 in the immediate future.
400,000 is "a few coins?" 

Also, isn't the largest exchange in Hong Kong? Last time I checked, Hong Kong was part of China.  Indians don't have any money anyway, and the rich ones will use Bitcoin banned or not.

Facebook and Google "banned" Bitcoin? Mmmkay.  I'm glad to not see those scammy ads.

This market is NOTHING like 2014.  I was in the market then.  It was a lot different.  A lot of us just threw up our hands and put our wallets in our sock drawers, writing the little money we had spent on Bitcoin off.  It worked out.  I don't think we'll have to wait so long this time.
Sorry, they are a cock.
Subbed, want to know the answer too 
It's a bit of a meme here (Big Green Dildo). Basically it's a giant single candle (I typically consider >3% in 1H). If people refer to *the* BGD, they mean to $1000 candle on 4/12 that took us from 6800-7800. 
Bitcoin Going Dumb 

jk big Green dildo.. named for the uncanny resemblance between a large green candle and a big Green dildo

You the best.

Promise I'll be more careful in the future lmao.
I can log in. But they did kick my existing tabs and force me to log in again.
Yeah I think we'll go up a bit, and drop down over the course of few more months. My conservative target is $4k, but I could totally see this hitting 2.5k to 3.5k, because ETH doesn't really have an obvious long term support, and ETH will likely take BTC down with it to find it.
Don‚Äôt quit moding! I get your humour. You‚Äôre doing great üëç 

Yea no matter what you do, not everyone will be happy. It would definitely be good to find a nice medium for the sub. Where we can all generally agree on certain things with leeway in either direction. It‚Äôs hard to please everyone, as we all come from all over and have completely different points of view on nearly every little thing.

Possibly make a thread where people can post their opinions on how the thread should be ran/monitored/ censored? 


Ever been to /r/DaystromInstitute ?  They discuss star trek like we discuss btc&trading and have a very high standard.  It's a good example of a community with an identity and order, seems fairly well self regulated, though the mods appear often.  They're a bit extreme though, to the point of losing their sense of humor in general.  Great place still.
Yeah perhaps there's no good solution. I still think it attracts the wrong crowd though. This is the one mainstay crypto sub that isn't some fucked up circlejerk. The fact that openly critical discussion from all sides is, for the most part, supported here is quite amazing. It would be a shame to succumb to the soft bigotry of low expectations. I remember this place being more densely populated with insightful content back in 2013. It's become pretty diluted with crap since then. Still #1 though.
We would be okay with that. 
It's only fitting I'd make it back the same way I lost it. If I close here I will have made half back. I feel like this wants to drop more in spite of RSI screaming it shouldn't. Will give it a little room but will probably close soon. 
Holy fuck... I was too quick with that scalp lol.
Where do you think we‚Äôre headed? 
I went up to 7x of my initial investment in terms of USD valuation, down to 3x, back to over 5x, cashed out all the gains, left my initial, moved it to BTC and starting all over again. Gains are meh cause playing safe until I get some money that I can lose on risky moves.
Doubled your stack? Fuck yeah mate. Take some of those sweet gains and treat yourself 


well, they did lock in a 600% ROE but I hear ya ;)

Yes and most indicators point to more downwards movement. The amount of longs opened means it  will potentially be very violent

BTC price at entry \- \(BTC price at entry / 3.3\)

This will tell you the lowest price BTC can go before your account balance hits zero.  Some exchanges liquidate prior to your balance hitting zero to avoid slippage.  So be aware of this.
I'm not the first to post this triangle, but it's starting to look pretty valid:

https://imgur.com/a/JNtyL57

Support is at around $6,850 at the moment, and I'd be surprised if the market didn't drop down to shake hands with that support line at some point in the next few days to weeks. 

There's also a very strong possibility that the market will drop through it, in which case I have no idea how low it could possibly go. 

Whether I'll have the luxury of continuing to hold this short until that line is tested is a bit uncertain for me though. The market could very well pump to kick me out of my position before dropping to test the support line. We'll see.
While I generally agree with you, I get the sense that this sub has very high standards for what constitutes a high success rate.
yep, feel like either I'm going nuts or everyone else is in full blown denial
Stop it, I'm about to go to bed r/nosleep
Exactly. The bear market hasn‚Äôt even *started*. 


You don‚Äôt rise to an almightily $19k without suffering a three year comedown. 
Oh, that one. Weird how a single candle is significant enough that a name can be associated with it.
True, I'll have to take a look at the price movement and if there's a bullish div or something to feed the necessary hopium. 
I don't think we will see that again anytime soon. Most shorters have learned their lesson and are more careful now.
McAfee says $15000 in June, you say in 3 years.

I guess, the truth is somewhere inbetween.
Well, Wave 1-5 describe a bull market. We are in a bear market right now, about to enter a bull market. So, *in my opinion* we are in the last correction wave (Wave E). 

http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:market_analysis:identifying_elliott_wave_patterns#horizontal_triangles

When we enter the bull market, we start with Wave 1, not Wave 2.

Thanks, homie :) Just want to make sure we can keep things positive and productive.
My post isn't removed? I assume this is about the part I already edited out.
That's not true. You have to pay taxes on your bitmex trades which I had last year. Can't just appear with a lot of coins to sell out of nowhere. People ask questions and the tax man wants to know why you didn't give him his cut. 
They can hate me all they want. Won't change the fact that they're wrong and betting a losing game.

I even warned them multiple times to stay out but nobody listens to me.
Curiously, vocal bears are almost nowhere to be found at that time too. Such a coincidence 
Lol, nice non-answer.
Charts suggest an equllibrium pattern with higher lows 6k, 6.5k and lower highs 11.7k, 10k.  There's no reason to believe this pattern will break without substantial negative news.
It‚Äôs not really bold though is it? Just look at the charts and the data! Take the emotion out of it. I don‚Äôt think any/many people want to see Bitcoin in ‚ÄúGoblin Town‚Äù. They just want to find a bottom and get this over with so we can start a long term recovery.
Rates will go down if people close their longs yes. This will return the funding to be available for lending, but right now the opposite is happening.
bulls are usually very quiet until it goes up, short same. most posters here are very biased to their position and don't like to post unless it goes their way. so  i wouldn't put too much weight on the sentiment here
China ban was way before last year run up, India volume insignificant. Prove me wrong Where's the data. 
Man i hope your right this is just getting annoying.  Especially if it keeps going down slowly like 500 a week
I have a significant (to me anyway) chunk of change in transit to me after selling some stock which should arrive mid next week. I want to be in position to buy the bottom here.  This is gonna be tricky. 
except elliot waves are complete bullshit. even for TA standards.
I'm familiar with the pattern, but that blue line pointing straight to the moon is hilarious, come on.
As far as I know, we won't know that until the next hearing in September. Even if he was, though, I doubt it was more than just additional incidental pressure and not a cause

For a macro-scale view of things, yes.
Hey man. How's it going? lol
Actually I think you've done a fair job TBH. I did get a little worried when you went on a power trip to show that you could help clean up the board by spamming it with the same post about stopping the shitposts lol. I think when a community grows quickly then it becomes hard to mod because the old culture slowly gets eaten by new beliefs and culture and memes. Back in the day the meme was 'hodl', 'this is good for bitcoin' and we had genuine discussion on the tech, morality of what the tech allows and now it's all price memes and I would have guessed that a low percentage of investors have actually read the whitepaper and even less understand it.
Best of luck to you.
TA is simply factoring in past price movements into your predictions for future price movements. I think it can be a useful tool.
I'm confused...where did I do that?
Sorry. It was more of a sarcastic post, my intentions weren‚Äôt to be mean. Was just trolling him.

I‚Äôll be better 
That's not a bear flag. A bear flag by definition is an ascending channel following a large red pole. Nothing here is parallel. You even drew a horizontal support line. I would stop correcting people if you don't know even the most basic formations.
Rule 1
> Usually Ascending Triangle formation is a bullish pattern. But rarely it can also occur in a down trend when the prices make false break down below a support level. After break down the demand increases more than the supply, pushing the price up. Now it acts as a reversal pattern.

I‚Äôll take my pat on the back when you‚Äôre ready 
I will close at 7950 already and reopen at 7900 again to close at 8083 and might reopen at 8000.

it is the middle of the 2 lines in my chart, dont think we will reach that top line again, just wanna play is safe. 
True, I should have said in the forseeable future.  If humanity doesn't become extinct, it could happen in 100 years, just due to inflation.
Short squeeze is not likely, because this is a strong bear market and most everyone knows it.

Of course you could shake a few out with a pump, but they know it's almost certainly just coming back down.
Oh, I agree, suicide is not a joke, but suicide because you gamble with life savings and lose... Well, should've been less delusional and smarter.

There is always someone who loses here, it might be you, you should know that.
I agree it's nothing. Vol isn't relevant. It's about the demographic that buyer represents. And an oldhead friend of mine is buying ~20btc here to hold here. I consider him "smart money", he bought in 2013 originally I think.

Anyways I'm not even long myself, although I am placing long orders at lower prices
Why defend 7600 when you can buy lower? It's the same reasoning we've seen on all drops, though there's increasingly less bounces because fewer people FOMO, and fewer people panic sell. I think we'll get nudged through 7k to trigger stop losses and then pop back in for another lower high cycle, which might take us nowhere and we fall back down out of the wedge, or we break up. 
I may be wrong but [cryptowat.ch](https://cryptowat.ch) is showing me 6425 on 04/01 on the 12hr for btc/usd on bitfinex
gotcha
5800\-\>6400\-\>7000  is a rising support line
Perfect.
I don't know if that holds true given that the initial test was after a breakout (expected, almost always happens) and this future test would be over a year later, after much greater upside. What you're saying would be more applicable if we'd already tested it after 20K, just like we're about to see with $6K imo.

Then he got a little criticism for over-moderating and said he would take a step back. 

Being a mod is hard and you never please everyone, or even most. I preferred the heavier hand personally.
I honestly think there will ‚Äújust‚Äù be a technical bounce soon. This market is bound for a downward journey. No doubt in my mind about that.
So you're saying back at 10k in a few weeks then. 
Did not know there is announcement for that \^\-\^
Yeah, I understand, I have had a couple of those in my inbox. But if my initial short goes from 7932 to 7748, I will be well in the green. So my thoughts were that by using tight stops I could add more BTC to the game and still get stopped in the green if it doesn't go my way. 
Am I mistaking. Totally stupid thinking?
(I'm still not sure witch buttons to push)
Thank you. I guess I agree. But is there something my remaining funds (0.2BTC) can and should be used for here to improve this trade.
My initial thinking was that I wanted a simpler and faster (and less cost for fees) way to make a trade like this:
1. Take profits on initial trade @ 9749. 2. Put profits + 0.2BTC in a new 10x short from 9749.
Just doubling down on the racism now, eh?

You really can be a better person, no matter the price of Bitcoin or just about anything else.

Maybe give it a shot...
I may have missed the update part but i will be sure to check better when updating the postition in the future.

Never too late to cut losses...
> as there are no people saving money weekly into Bitcoin

You're wrong.
Things can easily turnaround just as quickly as they dropped, it just doesn‚Äôt seem like that at the time.

If by 30% more drop you mean you get liquidated in the low 5ks then I think you‚Äôre definitely Ok. 

Would be surprised to go below 7k and would genuinlely be amazed not to see 10k in the next few months. Prob drop again then though.

It always sucks to be on the wrong side of a large dip though (which as a holder I always am). No real way out other than decide what loss you are happy to take or decide to keep holding. Good luck either way.




20% is a big loss but far from 'too late to cut it'.
Lol. I get that. I wasn‚Äôt addressing you specifically or trying to be rude or call you out, but in general, I don‚Äôt understand the downvotes on a some of these comments. 
Why in your opinion would this happen ‚Äòthis‚Äô time, when it could‚Äôve last time from ATH? Just curious. 

I don‚Äôt trade, but I am super keen to add at 6900-7200 btc and 500usd for the ‚Äòother‚Äô one. 
I see, thanks for clearing that up! Your chart showed the ETH/USD ratio, which confused me. Anyway, I agree. I just closed my short on the ETH/BTC ratio last night, as I‚Äôve been expecting at least a small bounce here since it‚Äôs unlikely to keep dragging BTC down in the short term.
It's tough to say what the net effect will be.  Bitcoin might become harder to get hold of.  Might go up in value.

That's cool. I'm still essentially short from 8300 and I can't picture climbing above that in the short term. Absolute worst case scenario for me at this point is I get out at break even.
You make it sounds so easy. üòù
I wish. I'm waiting until the BTC-ETH synergy calms down. Probably several more months.
You misunderstand. Marketcap going down does not automatically mean that 50 Billion has been pulled out of crypto. It means the price of coins has been going down.

If shitcoin ABC has 99% of its coins tied up on an exchange which is having problems, the price is dictated by the remaining 1%. If it halves, the market cap halves. If it doubles, the market cap doubles. This could mean a change in millions for the sake of a few thousand dollars.

Maybe 50 Billion has been pulled in a couple of days but don‚Äôt base it on market cap
You are so stupid.
he‚Äôs just a troll.

Ahaha, seriously. Doesn‚Äôt anyone see it‚Äôs going to be a historic low?
hey man that's $10 in my pocket!

I didn't mean to imply that it was an advisable strategy. Merely that it's one that some traders employ. 

I'd agree that it's a terrible idea and you should always set stop loss orders immediately before your liquidation price.
Dear Mr Korean As Fuck, it has come to our attention you may have unreported gains for the 2018 tax year...
Using the word ‚Äúobvious‚Äù is an interesting way of proving your creditbility /s
This feels worse than Feb-March to be honest. I don't follow your harder to invest in stock market statement. Are you younger than 18? 

My mindset as far as investing is an investment should be treated as one. Unless you are already wealthy or a high net worth individual, the only way to gain wealth in the US (outside of hitting the lotto) is investing. Putting money into crypto as this stage of the game is not investing; it's calculated gambling. There are no solid fundamental reasons to invest in crypto. You are not getting any shares of any companies; you are merely gambling on the speculative nature and value of a coin that currently has no real-world usage nor is there a promise of any in the future. You can only sell at a price that somebody is willing to pay. Price is not based off of earnings, value or anything.

I'm almost 40 and am heavily invested in any traditional investments you can think of. Crypto is the last thing I put my hard earned money in it. The problem is many people, assuming they are young and naive, want to skip the hard work and traditional investments to use crypto to get insta-rich and many of them are paying the price. Just because a small % of people on the internet claim to have gotten rich off crypto doesn't mean the success can be replicated. Making money shouldn't be this easy and it won't be.

The crypto game, as I call it, is evolving every day and the sooner you recognize the trend, the more successful you will be. 

I think we are going down a lot this time around just because every bullet to pump the price up has been spent with little effect. Tone Vays has been getting ridiculed lately for calling $1300 bitcoin but the man knows what he is talking about and has made some correct calls in the past. Maybe he is not so off.

Good luck
7620
Still can't find any indicator called that way, weird
I'm pretty sure binary was banned today.
I think you misinterpreted my joke.
Dush was banned for harassment and ban evasion. I offered to provide the sub with a full report if Dush said it was okay to share all our reasons.

Edit: I'm arguing that the good does not outweigh the bad. You can't let people off the hook just because they're productive sometimes. Dush crossed a line and there were consequences. Now, apparently, he's only giving people part of the story and eliciting sympathy so they'll defend him in the sub... which isn't helping his case.
The volume of shit posts today is so huge that I had to give up and take a break. I'll never be able to get rid of them all.
Where do you short alts?
It is until it isn't.

Why should I put small orders on alts when I can go big on BTC? Not a fan of diversification.
I'm waiting on a reentry when I see the signs that it'll bounce, if it breaks this support it'll most likely drop to $7.6-7.5 and just stair step its way down with a few bear flags to 6.8 or that support level around there. It's honestly up to you, don't panic sell though. 

If BTC bounces, then great, I'll wait for a confirmation that it isn't a fakeout then jump back in. I'd wager that most of the sentiment here is bearish. 
Got it, thanks
Glad to hear it.  Here‚Äôs to getting back to mid-April form where you were bordering on 100% win rate.   
I chart on stamp, for me it was more like descending wedge that broke down, but was more interested in support/resistance from 10k which broke down at 8.1, it was stronger line than the one from 8.5
Thanks for the advice. I've set stops accordingly. Buyers have been weird past 48 hours so I'd rather still get stopped in profit and reassess I think, although this is a very juicy position. 
And... exhale :) 
Phew!
She doesn't care, she says to react to price movement with a clear plan in mind for both bearish and bullish scenarios, not try to predict what price is gonna do
>  I'm glad to not see those scammy ads.

I"m not glad that no one sees cryptocurrency advertising now on all those platforms.  We agree to disagree there.
hahaha thanks for the explanations :) 
i feel like we should have a bitcoin markets glossary/lexicon word bank
Why do you use ETH as such a strong indicator? I do use alts in general as an indicator since a lot of newbie alt holders have a disdain for holding BTC so if they capitulate or sell off they generally go straight into fiat via BTC so I see the impact.
My hope is that censorship is a non issue here. I don't believe I censor. I do delete posts that violate rules, though. People who believe that is censorship need to make their voice about that heard. That's a specific and nuanced issue.

I think some people are worried that they cant criticize mods... or that the only way to be critical is to make an accusation about abuse. That's not how I want people to feel. Anyone can criticize my mod actions at any time. It's always relevant and on topic as far as I'm concerned.
We get a lot of credit from the reddit community and the CC community for having a strong and independent identity around rule enforcement. I'm asking y'all to help me and not assume thta I know what i'm doing when I enforce.

In an ideal world I'm only responding to reports... 

Is this sub aware of what it's changing into and do we want to be the ting we are becoming? How do mods enforce when the demands of the community are inconsistent?
"We"? Haha is there multiple people on your  account? 
Dude. Close half now.  Or a third.  At least something.

Edit: a little bit of a retrace is in the cards.  If it retraces kinda high like to 7800 or more, you might panic close it (or safety close it)  Take some of the pressure off.  If this goes straight to 6.8k, it shouldn't be regrettable to have a slightly smaller postion on the way there, considering how you got there.
Stops over 7750 makes some sense, but that's totally your call. I probably wouldn't have advised as tight stops as I did before if I'd know it was 100% 100x. You crazy, brother!
If we're going to reverse, it should be 7000ish. That's why I expect a bounce down around there if we make it that far.

If we can't reverse, then I expect we retest 6K and probably break it. I think 5Kish could be on the menu as long-term support. I'm not really hoping for that, but I'm semi expecting it. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/HRfYOVkR/
Since last night, pretty much, yeah. I'm damn close to the threshold where I can move double what I put in into cold storage and start again with what I put in. That's huge for me, and the milestone I've been chugging towards for a while. 
:D
Do you have a link to where this is reported/being discussed?
> OKex CEO left

Been poached by Huobi apparently. Probably just another case of any news being bad news in a bear market.


That'll do it.
Oh seriously fucking hell.

There‚Äôs that black swan 
Ah okay, I do agree we'll go down to that line, though I hope we bounce enough so I can unload my bags ;)

Thanks for your view!
Hah!  That‚Äôs probably because no one else keeps track.  
people are in major denial i'm afraid 
Yeah I agree that we probably won't see that soon, but people were opening longs at 9.8K on our last run so... There is a lot of dumb money around.
We could hit 15k. There are going to be fakeouts along the way. But hitting 15k next month seems like a stretch.
All depends on how you count it if that's your opinion then its cool but my count is different. I assume you think we are putting in a final triangle Y or Z also perfectly valid.
[deleted]
I removed it so other people can't see it.

If you remove that last sentence I'll bring it back. My post was just a warning.
I'll caveat that I think you can be a bit brash in your tone at times, especially in Feb/March from my recollection, but at the end of the day  the numbers speak for themselves. 

And at this point, you've been right enough to be a dick about it, especially in light of the bi-polar moonbois who are at best right 1/3rd of the time, but continue to come into this thread daily, posting verbal diarrhea that's nothing more than cheering on their usually bullish positions. 

Although to be fair, you don't post that often, nor do you really explain your positions when you do, so I guess something has to fill this thread every day.

It's just funny how you and Chew are 2 of the best known posters in here who've been largely right for 5+ months now, and you get perpetual downvotes, while Chew gets a following looking for auto-updates on his position....
Not sure what you are reading, but the sub is full of bearish sentiment lately.  

our friendly AmericanActor can only do so much.. being and oracle7 days a week is hard after mfrstookhismoney
There will definitely be more "substantial negative news".  That will help the price get down there for sure.

But zoom out on the chart and shows that likely will drop below 6.5K.
It is bold, to predict such a thing from charts. Bart patterns and BGDs are most like market manipulations. Unless we know the intention of the people that start them up, it's ver unlikely to predict them although the general conditions can be expected to repeat themselves, such as they come when you least expect them. And some sideways movement usually precedes them, so I give it you, its probability can be expected in some conditions.

Oh believe me, many people here want to see goblin town. Some out of greed, some to justify their biased weird TA and some are even /r/buttcoin trolls that want Bitcoin in the mud. 
Right, makes sense, thanks.
It would be impossible to prove you wrong about any of this, because you refuse to accept the truth.   You actually consider a market of 1.3 billion people to be "insiginificant".  Enjoy living in your fantasy world.  I will not join you there.
Maybe not. There are many bears in this forum, predicting much lower prices. 

We are all just reading tea leaves here...
Like I said, it's a trend. Not a price target.
This is retarded yet again 
The culture has shifted a lot. That's something I've had to grapple with personally and I think I've accepted it. There are some OG instincts that I've had to start ignoring in this new paradigm. 

Part of me hopes that we can get back to our roots, but I know we can't. Posts have improved in other ways and I've learned to appreciate them.
https://www.tradingview.com/x/mihA4sPT/

Damn it, that random dude was right!
https://www.tradingview.com/x/mihA4sPT/

I‚Äôll take the pat on the back. 
Since he won't, here you go:
\*pat\*
I get you, but one person doesn't make the market. Personally I'm wary of people from 2013 who are excessively bullish. They've seen insane gains, that euphoria and bullish mindset will take years to wear off. 

find someone who has never entered the btc space and is an intelligent investor and is thinking about buying here...then you'll have a good indicator 
Because buyers are absolutely insane this month. No good reason, but that's my reasoning. 
Indeed. If we break 7000 (convincingly), I'd be inclined to count the wick to 5800 as a capitulation wick.
Cool...not really in disagreement with your analysis just that 3k for me is just slightly less strong but splitting hairs...peace
You will at least get an email ;-D.
Yeah, but it is also a fast way to make a winning trade a losing one. I recommend the bitmex testnet, you can try out everything you want there for free (and play around with all those button)
Maybe I misunderstood your original comment. I thought you needed to bump leverage up to 50x to free up the .2 XBT. If you have the .2 available now, there's no reason to move the leverage slider at all. Just wait for your target and sell the .2 to add to your position (and stay at 25x). Your CA would be about 7835 and liquidation would be about 8100 for more cushion than going the 50x route.

If it were me, I'd use that available .2 XBT to bring my leverage down below 15x and let the position ride as it is (hard to complain about a 30ish% ROE if the price hits that 7750 target). I generally stick to 5-10x though. 
Yea, seriously!
Explain...

Would love to see sources about how many global BTC "weekly DCA buyers" there are. I'd be surprised if there were more than 10000 of us (but I have no data except for gut feeling)
Liquidation is either EUR3200, or USD2400, whichever comes first.

But I'm stuck at USD$9800 and EUR7530 positions, and I can't DCA down, or my liqui points will go up. 

I am now convinced that this is going into the $2000s as per 2014 - hence why I'm too scared to buy and raise the liqui point.

Also don't want to be paying MORE interest than I already am for the next 18-24 months:

EDIT: As you can see, a return to $10k in a few months will LITERALLY mean I would have been better off putting money in a bank and earning 2% interest.

Might make a tiny bit of money on the EUR position if it reaches USD10k, but that'll be a 5% win for a 4 month wait.

I fucking suck at this trading bullshit.
get ya

yep, i agree that downvotes are being over used sometimes on this sub

personally i didn't downvote and rarely do
Sorry about that, i see how that could be confusing.  I hope iv clarified it a bit better now!
It is pretty easy to say that if you cut back on the number of people who buy it, then it leads to a lower price.'

That's not to say the price will definitely be lower in 10 years than it is now, but banning Bitcoin does hurt the price, not help it.
:/
Bet he's great fun at parties. 

No, a historic low would be less than $1
Until we're above $10 ;-)
You said "very few take him seriously" and I disagree. A bunch of people take him seriously. Here's his many thousands of citations

https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=64BtMdsAAAAJ&hl=en
Higher for now. Over 7800. If it breaks below 7500, I'll move them to BE
Hmm not sure man, works for me, do you have a pro account?
We talked about this. I understand mod role, I know it's hard and there will be always somebody who isn't satisfied so I try not to comment your strategy unless it's not targeted in me or someone I know.

Joking about bans when you shoot with them left and right is a bit inappropriate, especially when you should know that amount of shit posting from my side is marginal.
Stop over moderating dude jesus christ. Chill.

This sub was fine for a couple years without your overmoderation and it will be fine still without it.
you can do it on bitmex and bitfinex, although I'd be very careful. shorting alts is dangerous territory
I guess. I personally believe it's really that simple, though. if it doesn't work, oh well it's a small short.

the main reason you do it is because the risk/reward is kind of better for most alts. the % swings are larger which means you can use smaller positions and hold for longer while making the same profit s
Because the moment you Tether you go out of the crypto train. I prefer to trade alts so I'm staying inside. Just my views.
The "Teddy Bear" comes from 1902 when U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt (a.k.a. Teddy) refused to shoot a bear cub that was brought to him. The act of kindness spread quickly and the name "Teddy Bear" became popular.
I‚Äôm really hoping for a bart up so I can have some good rest and a break though, lowkey panicking but not panicking as sure I‚Äôve still profited but I need to take some money out real soon to put towards a holiday, and it means taking out money I recently put in at a loss overall 
Thanks
Well done holding it. I'd move stops up above the last break on futures. Maybe 7920? 
Wise mum.
No, we decided to refer to us (being "myusernameiforgot" - names are not translated, otherwise "ourusernameweforgot") in plural form because we believe singular form doesn't convey our greatness satisfactory.
Do you take manipulation into account too? What about short squeezes or long squeezes? 
Nah now you leverage it all and keep doubling your stack until liquidation 
I‚Äôve seen you mention before you essentially diminished your entire cold storage stack and only had a trading stack. 

Seems like you have done well for yourself in the 8k range. You‚Äôre a great trader and i definitely respect/look up to you. As I‚Äôm still learning myself and a pretty bad traded, I‚Äôve learned a decent chunk from you  
Every time I've been "very close" to my target it turned badly because greed. Just do it now, or 50% something.
yeah, I think that's it. 
I agree.
I count like this.

But I'm not an expert. Then again: Who is in this market? ;-)
it is, The platform is built on top of the 0x protocol, which provides us with a simple, elegant standard for handling settlement without necessitating user accounts or taking custodianship of users‚Äô funds. This solves the problems of trust and third-party reliance that exist on centralized exchanges, completely removing us as an attack vector. Paradex users maintain absolute control of their tokens right up until the point where their trades are validated and finalized, all while never having to create an account.


I just bought all tokens Paradex list when I saw those news and posted. zrx at 1.06 :D woho
Ok thanks.

Sorry... I got triggered
Chewy and I have the same short term overall market outlook most of the time and same long term all of the time.

We differ in our strategies and scale. 
I only know that you probably read my comment diagonally ( :
What on the charts?
What was your assertion? It was something something doom and gloom, never reach ATH cuz bans. Am I right? 
yeah but some of these tea leaves are better than others
What was the price of the bounce at Point E, 7000?
Don't get defensive, moon *is* a Bitcoin target. 
But this time I'm with you. I have the entire account 10x short from 8309 on June. I moved it to 15x to free up margin and I've been scalping 25x. My last one was up to 100x short from 7760 (originally 50x from 7830, added on the bounce back into 77xx). Just closed it at 74xx and reopened at 7520. That "scalp" was actually a 15% stack increase lolol.
At least we got people who know what they are doing supporting the network. My main problem is the more divorced we get from the tech as a community in terms of our understanding the more open the network is to possible social attack. Up until you could buy a HW wallet handling PK's on paper was a fucking nightmare but now most people keep their BTC on an exchange, you had to be technically savvy to keep your shit secure. This is why I think BTC is far from ready for mainstream adoption. 

All the basics need to be totally seamless for people including the backup of your keys, things like multisig by default (so you can carry around a 2nd or 3rd key to authorize a transaction/channel too make it harder for someone to steal your phone/trezor/nano etc). Security is one of the biggest factors when it comes to the average person, imagine the news of when the first billionaire btc investor is kidnapped and the old XKCD (https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/security.png) crypto scenario happens because people been bragging about their gains on FB...
No you weren't right about the formation. That's like saying "price went down. Obvious H&S". Nobody disagreed on the price going down.
I agree but it goes both ways. A lot of dudes here joined high and have seen nothing but misery and crushed hopes for the last few months. They are selling during a crash, and they are also biased because of their experience during the last few months.

heres what  i'm looking at anyways. You really should be closing ur shorts in those green zones.

https://ibb.co/jTpFi8
If they held up to here then probably they'll hold way down until they realize that bull isn't coming...

Smart investor? Damn, bought at 9.5...
Very friendly customer service :D
Thank you. I probably wrote it a bit clumsy.
I almost did what you say here, but in a more manual way, as you can see in my edit. I'm happy with that, and I appreciate your expertise.
Thanks, I love your contributions to the sub by the way. Just wanted to add my two satoshis!
That's true, but you're also cutting back on the number of people who sell it.

If you believe that the value will collapse, I'd short privacy coins now.  Just a matter of time before they're all banned.  But they have a huge underground economy and desperate addicts and criminals who want them.  The price could skyrocket like liquor during prohibition.


I said very few, as in the consensus is that he's a blowhard. Citations do not equal endorsements, I would think an acedemic would know that. He's controversial and well-known for sure, that doesn't mean he's right. 
no, that's probably it. Thanks for your help anyway :)
I'm curious about what makes you think I'm banning people so much.
Classic overreaction to a non issue is classic.
Or you just lock your capital in something that won't give you enough profit.

I understand your point, did that and decided to stick to BTC for now.
You get out and miss the drop. I saved a lot of gains in a drop from 20k because I was trading in USD, wasn't holding crypto when we went down.
Eh, not so much on the manipulation front. We're seeing a long squeeze of sorts here. I think if we dump (quickly) to 7200, that would only be possible with a long squeeze.

Shorts are actually down from this morning. No short squeeze coming any time soon. 
When I call you sobbing from the bathtub, you better friggin listen. 
Appreciate the kind words, man. Yes, funds that were originally "okay to lose" became "not okay to lose" due to life and I was forced to liquidate everything I had in March. I was very fortunate to sell my BTC at $11.3K and ETH just over $800. I've been trying to rebuild it since. Still only up to a quarter of what I had, but I thought I'd have to be out of the crypto scene until next year. Pretty stoked. I'm hoping the market throws me a bone and drop to 7300. That's where I'd hit my target. 
Well, I did close my scalp short from 7830 at 7480. It was a "scalp" that actually turned into a massive position. I took profits on that and reshorted the profits at 7620 with Chewy, tighter stops than he has. My big decision will be where I close my short from 8310 if we bounce significantly (7800)
It happens. Take a breather next time you feel that way. The conversation will be a lot more productive.
Ok poor reading comprehension on my part there.

But there are usually quite a few vocal bears during a bull run...just like there are some vocal bulls lately.  But they are traders, not holders.

Please don't get all worked up about prices in this chart. This is a rough trend estimate. Not a concrete price prediction.

Wave E could stop and bounce now, or it could go lower and bounce then.

Or this pattern is wrong and the price will behave in a completly different way...
Yeah I'm sad I didn't add more. Dush has been telling me in discord that the time to be greedy is now the entire way down jn $8ks...he was right. I should've added a lot more. 

My short is now around 85% of what it was the first time around and it  was a big short. Thing is I have way more margin to short now. I should've gone to lime 10-20x again. I'm only 6x full stack right now. 


Everything is a mixed bag. Without doubt, we will continue to move toward more entropy and the impact of that entropy is impossible to predict.
Thanks dude! Yes agree with what you're saying about the dragging down. 
Privacy coins are already getting banned.  The Japanese gov't pressured the exchanges there to delist ZEC, XMR and others.

> That's true, but you're also cutting back on the number of people who sell it.

You don't understand markets.
Then you have access to a "consensus" that no one else does. 8000 academic of a single book says otherwise. 
Read your sticky post :-P

It basically says 'behave or ban'
"I'm allowing you this one shitpost" = overmoderation. Period. 


Or you get out and miss the gains. The crypto market is still a market with an upward trend, therefore I prefer to stay in. I'll play BTC-USD with a dedicated stack once I'm rich. For now I'm looking essentially to maximize my BTCs
True. Do you think btc will ever reach ATH again? Do you believe in it? 
I mean put a part in cold storage and trade with the rest.
I'm feeling your struggle from last time. Damn man. If we bounce to >7800, am I going to have steel hands? It's been "easy" thus far. That's part of why I've scalped movement on swaps. I'm really hoping we don't crack 8K again on any ensuing bounce. That will be hard to hold. 
supply/demand what else is there to understand?

*Privacy coins are already getting banned*

I expect that trend to continue.  There's still time to make trades based on it.  I've been very tempted to short some of them.  But the biggest risk is illiquidity, which I've seen increase values, by making them 'stickier'.  Hodlers tend to hodl when it's a pain to sell.



Firstly, do you not understand that citations are not the same thing as endorsements? You get that, right?

See how often Mein Kampf is cited.
The percentage of people who are banned is a lot lower than my sticky indicates. I post the sticky so I don't have to ban as much. Most days, nobody is banned.
That was a joke. Try reading it again and look for context clues.
Well, I missed some gains on the way up, I missed all the loses on  the way down, cashed out my gains and I'm now trading btc/btc.

It all depends what you want to achieve. For me it was usd valuation to some point, then I can go with BTC and don't care if it drops significantly.
I do. I'm trading primarily to build my BTC holdings, not to capitalize on it failing. I think we could still see new ATHs in the next 24-36 months. A number of things have to change--first and foremost the laws/classifications surrounding it as an asset in the majority of the world. If the US would open the door to it as a new digital currency type asset or something similar (*not* property), then maybe. 
There's no such thing as an "endorsement" in academia. There is such a thing as a citation. Nor is there such thing as "consensus" that supersedes citations.

Edit to respond to your un-noted edit: we've reached the Hitler reference! Congrats! If you can't tell the difference between citations of an economics book and Mein Kampf I think we're done here 
how condescending
Doesn't really matter how many are banned if you threaten everyone that isn't sticking to thread...

But I get the point. You forgot the /s and I'm over reacting.
Ah, I get the "joke."

A shitpost made with the moderator tag would be another accurate description of that comment. 
Ugh I‚Äôve lost quite a bit daytrading. I don‚Äôt do it as much now and I‚Äôm better but still. Wouldn‚Äôt the us gov be afraid of the power of btc and couldn‚Äôt they ban the use of it somehow? What about altcoins? 
> There's no such thing as an "endorsement" in academia.

What? This is an asinine statement. 

>Nor is there such thing as "consensus" that supersedes citations.

Citations don't tell you anything about how the authors are using the work or whether they support the thesis or not. It merely suggests that the work is influential for better or worse. 

Something tells me that you're not in 'academia' in the sense that I mean. What are you halfway through your undergrad? There's no way a serious academic would make arguments like "I'm in academia", as if that refuted my point at all.
How is that condescending? It's paramount to this conversation that one understands what citations are and aren't. They're not endorsements. Do *you* understand that? 
Your comments do seem out of proportion for my actual mod activity... which is pretty light. I post a sticky telling users to report and downvote, then walk away. Doesn't seem like a big deal. It's a 1 day ban or a warning 99.99% of the time... on mostly user reported comments. It's not a big deal.
Also, most people who ask to have their ban lifted get their ban lifted early.
I'm sorry, but you fell for Godwin's law and thus brought an end to this particular conversation. Resorting to personal insults is just sad, and your inability to deal with my pointing out that you have no proof of this "consensus" is equally sad. Citations of contemporary economics books are never "for ill" like in your Hitler comparison. Oh and no I'm a professor 
Well, one would think an academic would know enough to be able to distinguish between a citation, academic influence and consensus. And you don't even know me and what I think or understand, so that last question is simply.... condescending!
Well,I don't see admin console so I need to believe what you just said, right?

You're being harsh on your comments, that's why I assumed you're really banning those people.

BTW, we're not sticking to the thread, should you ban both of us for 24h? :-P
Now you're just excusing yourself to be taken as more friendly guy.

You don't need my approval on your actions. You're the mod here.
Godwin's Law? I hope you understand that you're invoking your own fallacy here and that my point and example are both valid. Godwin's Law really doesn't fit here, at least not as some sort of informal fallacy. 

What personal insults? I'm merely skeptical that you're an academic, as you claim to be, based on several non-sequiturs. 

The fact that you can't distinguish academic citations from endorsements of the work cited is insane. Again, I can't believe someone "in academia" would commit themselves to such fallacious arguments, though maybe you're just using yourself as an example of Taleb's target. 
How is it condescending? Firstly, I'm not even discussing this with you. Look above, the user doesn't seem to grasp this difference so the question is fair. Sorry you're too much of a snowflake to handle such direct questions. 
Check my post history. I've spent more time interacting with you than moderating.

I don't understand why you're so upset with me, but I've always respected you. I'm going to stop interacting with you now.

I hope you can find a way to forgive me for whatever I've done.
I serve the community. It's not my sub. This isn't for me.
There is no such thing as an endorsement bwahahaha 
What do you mean by snowflake? 
 I said that I completely understand and don't agree and that's different. I don't have to agree, I'm not here too make friends or make community better. I respect you because I know how it is like, I would do it differently, that doesn't mean I don't like you or I'm upset about your decisions.
This exchange to be perfectly honest is giving us plebs the impression that you're using mod status as a superpower to aid in harassment, because it's perfectly reasonable that this guy felt targeted from the get-go. There's no way you could possibly expect him to know all this background info and context that's only in your head that you're mocking him for not knowing, and frankly this guy deserves an apology instead of this defensive posturing.
That makes absolutely no sense. Do you know what *endorsement* means?

>noun

>1.
an act of giving one's public approval or support to someone or something.

You're trying to claim no such thing exists in academia? You're out of your mind, fellow! (pun intended)
Thinking that my conversation with OP was condescending on my part. The guy literally doesn't understand what citations are, which you could easily see if you read the exchange. 

The fact that you're complaining about me clarifying the distinction between the two words is quite strange. 
Hrm... this is weird, because I've had a lot of interactions with /u/v4mpyre and I never got the feeling there was any animosity between us until today. I'd describe our interactions as categorically friendly. We've communicated for months, if not years, that way. I'm not even sure what background information I assumed he had, so your comment has me confused, too.

If I'm  abusing my mod powers in any way it should be pointed out. Maybe making a joke using the mod flair was poor taste? I thought it was funny and then it broke out into this. So, I'm really confused right now.

Can you point out where you think I'm harassing people with links? I'd like to review that so I can better understand what you're talking about.
Citations are measurable existing things. Endorsements are not. In academia citations matter and exist, endorsements don't. You are confusing a denial of a thing mattering within academia and the denial of the thing itself. We are merely back where we started with the point going whoosh over your head again. Do you have ANY evidence that outweighs 8000 citations for a single economics book, beyond "Hitler got citations too"?
Please clarify then as to what the distinction between citation, academic influence and academic consensus (and snowflake) is. If possible, avoid the ad hominem
I already said it. You made an inappropriate joke that I took seriously, overreacted and now we're here. I just don't like to be threatened by ban when I actually trying to do my best to go with the rules and share my knowledge here...

But the way this guy said it... He's right at some point. Your posts sound like 'I'm mod now, I have power, you guys better behave'. I don't like this kind of behavior. I think the best mod is the one that you can't see working but you know he's there and doing his job. But again, you don't need my approval here,  you do you as you think it'll work. I have experience in this and I know it's freakin' hard job and I'm glad that someone is trying to do it.
> Citations are measurable existing things. Endorsements are not. 

Endorsements are measurable but it requires analyzing each paper that cites his work. So, you're wrong there.

>In academia citations matter and exist, endorsements don't. 

Wrong again.


>You are confusing a denial of a thing mattering within academia and the denial of the thing itself. 

I'm not. Agreement and disagreement is pretty fundamental to any academic field. Again, the statements you're making are absolutely absurd.

>We are merely back where we started with the point going whoosh over your head again.

Lol, nothing you've said has whooshed me, I assure you.

> Do you have ANY evidence that outweighs 8000 citations for a single economics book, beyond "Hitler got citations too"?

No, I don't. No evidence that would satisfy your standards of "I'm an academic and I like Taleb, therefore most academics like Taleb" (keep thinking that one through, dude). What I do have for evidence is leading academic figures (i.e. mainstream academics who represent the consensus in their field) dismissing Taleb's work as pseudo-scientific and lacking rigor.

It's beyond belief that you think *endorsements* or agreement/disagreement doesn't exist in academia. It's one of the most absurd arguments I've heard in a while but believe whatever you like. I'm certainly not interested in trying to convince you of anything, given that your framework for understanding revolves around n=1 anecdotes. Good luck with that!
I already explained snowflake. Are you really not familiar with this term?

Citation is a reference to a work.

Academic influence is the popularity of the work among scholars *or* the familiarity of the work within the field. 

Academic consensus is the mainstream view. 


I'm sorry I made you feel that way. I thought we were joking around and I posted some stuff that made you feel uncomfortable.

It would help me if you could link to the posts that you find upsetting.

If it's any consolation, you are probably the last user I would ever take any mod action against. The idea that you felt threatened by me at any point is mind bending.
Whoosh. Your hypothesis is that the 8000 citations are all negative. But that's just not how things works and not how papers accrue citations in modern academia. The vast majority of all citations are always positive in academia, as the bad papers are ignored. You don't know this, so you think you can wiggle your way out by claiming that the 8000 citations are evidence of disagreement. But they're not. Just straight up - they're not. Proving it would require going through each one, but in modern academia NO paper accrues 8000 citations due to disagreement (and note how you've changed your notion of "endorsement" to the more appropriate "agreement FINALLY).
The best I can come up for snowflake is an ice crystal of snow, I am afraid. I certainly didn't read an explanation from you. I suspect it to be an American term?  

I'm glad to see that we do agree on these terms, but the argument as to why citations are relevant or not relevant to academic influence (consensus is a different matter) still needs to be made. 
That's the problem with internet. Hard to say when people are joking...
> Whoosh. Your hypothesis is that the 8000 citations are all negative.

Nope, again, keep strawmanning me.

>The vast majority of all citations are always positive in academia, as the bad papers are ignored.

This is just completely false. In order to steel-man the opposing view, you need to cite the appropriate material. This is not the same thing as an endorsement, plain and simple. 

>You don't know this, so you think you can wiggle your way out by claiming that the 8000 citations are evidence of disagreement.

I didn't claim this. What is with the straw mans, seriously?

> Proving it would require going through each one, but in modern academia NO paper accrues 8000 citations due to disagreement

That's simply not true. Where you're getting this assumption from is beyond me. What is it exactly you're an academic of where the standard is to only cite papers you fully agree with?


> (and note how you've changed your notion of "endorsement" to the more appropriate "agreement FINALLY).

I didn't change it? What the fuck are you talking about? You make up so many ridiculous straw men that clearly are fabricated out of thin air. Endorsement means agreement, you dunce. The two are synonymous. If you endorse a paper, then you agree with it. It's the same exact thing. Duh.

There's no way you're "in academia", you're probably just getting your undergrad and think that's the same thing. No serious academic thinks and reasons the way you do.

This has already been discussed to death above. I'm not going to continue to waste my time on this subject. The point is that Taleb is a blowhard. 
That's a problem, yeah.

It's problematic that you have the impression that there's too much moderation happening... Or that it's being mishandled in any way. I'm hoping you can keep an eye on that. I'll check in with you once in a while about this. I view you as a stable and centered voice and I get conflicting feedback on what needs to happen with moderation... For obvious reasons.

Thanks for speaking up.
I'm losing IQ points just talking to you - you accuse me of straw-manning but offer no alternative. Given 8000 citations are evidence of widespread agreement with Taleb within academic communities, what counterevidence do you offer?
The alternative is that the citations are a mix of support and dissent. Duh. 

You're the one who's claiming that all citations in academia are a statement of support, which is just absolutely absurd. I can't even explain how idiotic this assumption is.

Interesting how you can't explain what field you're in and what the common practice is for that field. Obviously use of citations varies across different fields but I know of no such field where citations are the equivalent of endorsement. (oops, I used that word that you don't understand again)

It's amazing that you're excusing the many straw-mans you've introduced to this conversation. I'm pretty sure the IQ is flowing in *that* direction. 
I never said they are 100%. That's you again. It'd be incredibly high though. People cite influential papers - not bad ones. There may be a few exceptions (Freud, Hitler) of people who are cited a lot but people disagree with. The burden of proof is on you to show that the 8000 citations are majority in disagreement (good luck haha). Here's an easy task. Go take a random sample of 10 citations and see how it is mentioned. Post them here. If 9/10 aren't positive or neutral I'll withdraw my point. 
>I never said they are 100%. That's you again.

Sorry, I misspoke. You said the vast majority. (which I take to mean __?)

You said:

>The vast majority of all citations are always positive in academia, as the bad papers are ignored.

>It'd be incredibly high though.

Source?

>People cite influential papers - not bad ones. 

I already said that, you imbecile. Influential is not the same thing as being mainstream or widely agreed-upon. It's unbelievable how you don't understand the definitions of simple words.

>There may be a few exceptions (Freud, Hitler) of people who are cited a lot but people disagree with. 

Lol, this is actually an example that's much closer to a fallacious version of Godwin's Law than what I said.


>The burden of proof is on you to show that the 8000 citations are majority in disagreement (good luck haha).

Why? Why is that burden on me when you're conception of *citation* is wildly inaccurate

>Go take a random sample of 10 citations and see how it is mentioned. Post them here. If 9/10 aren't positive or neutral I'll withdraw my point.

That's far to qualitative for you to not just throw up your hands and yell "unfair!" I'm not going to go through the trouble just to prove something a moron on the internet.

Again, unbelievable that you're backtracking now. Maybe it's because you finally learned what the term *endorsement* means.

Get a clue, dude. You're exactly the type of pseudo-intellectual I was alluding to in my top comment. What a coincidence that such a Taleb-devotee would start rambling pseudo-intellectual crap into the thread. The universe works in mysterious ways.

Still trying to figure out what kind of "academic" you are. Maybe if you let me know the field you work in, it'll be more clear why people are not citing counter-examples. Please, enlighten me on this. Which field do you ~~work~~ study in?
I didn't read this full comment because you've been repeating yourself for a while now. The majority of all citations are positive or neutral, not negative, in academic papers. 8000 citations in economics in 10 years means it is a highly influential work, not something that everyone disagrees with. I suggested a qualitative way for you to prove your crappy point, which, to paraphrase, is just: "people are citing him but it's mostly negative" - you can pick random citations. Go ahead then. Your path is clear. I care so little it is unimaginable, but you clearly care a great deal. 
> I didn't read this full comment because you've been repeating yourself for a while now. The majority of all citations are positive or neutral, not negative, in academic papers.

Show me the proof.

>8000 citations in economics in 10 years means it is a highly influential work, not something that everyone disagrees with.

**Influential =/= Agreement. You are absolutely retarded if you actually equate the two.**

I didn't read the rest of your comment. Two can play *that* game.
