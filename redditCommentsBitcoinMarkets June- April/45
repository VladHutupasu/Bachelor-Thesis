[Daily Discussion] Thursday, April 19, 2018 -- TITLE
#New post: [\[Daily Discussion\] Friday, April 20, 2018 →](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8dksw2/daily_discussion_friday_april_20_2018/)
4/19/18 UPDATE. We exited to the upside of the channel from my last chart on [4/11/18] (https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8beaek/daily_discussion_wednesday_april_11_2018/dx62nhh/). Please note: that old channel is still in grey on my new chart.

Building on that, I have now come up with four short-term scenarios.     
Here’s the [zoomed out, macro view](https://www.tradingview.com/x/m9SY9iz2/).     
Here’s the [channel changeover](https://www.tradingview.com/x/qoUlK0uz/).     
Here’s the [four scenarios](https://www.tradingview.com/x/a1xyX9oj/).     

**Bull Case:** We continue within the immediate channel (the support line is bright green) with a price target of $8,800-$9,000 for April 23. This would be very bullish as it means we have forcefully broken through the downward channel from ATH.

**Sideways Case:** We leave the immediate channel but stay within the broader channel (the black lines). We likely see a moderate retracement to 7,800-$8000, but consolidate at this level with a price target of $8,200 for April 27. This would indicate the log resistance from ATH is going to be a major source of downward pressure on the market.

**Bear Case:** We drop out of the broader channel for the next three weeks, but stay above the brief support created in early April (the light blue line). This comes with a price target of $7,500 for April 8.

**Uber Bear Case:** We drop out of the immediate channel, the broader channel and fall below the brief support created in early April. This would indicate a significant reversal of the progress from the past month and that the market is still in the original downward channel from ATH. This action yields a price target of $6,900 with resolution shortly after May 22.

These charts might be a little messy, but I’m still getting the hang of this. Just to give you a bit of background on myself, I was an associate at a macro hedge fund and an analyst with the alternative asset management group at a top three U.S. investment bank. I have experience with fixed income, forex, commodities, derivatives and interest rates. I hope to do a larger macro analysis of bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market in the near future. 

**Important disclaimer**: This post is just a personal opinion and should not be considered investment, financial or legal advice.
Can some of you whales buy 160k BTC, and be done with it already ? We're tired guessing here!
I think right now even bots are confused.
Time for some fundamentals.

Localbitcoins tx# at all time high (27k yesterday): https://anacoinda.github.io/localbitcoins/all.html

In case you missed it (I certainly did): Canada daily volume going up 10x (from $100k to $1m in a month): https://anacoinda.github.io/localbitcoins/CAD.html
Fun fact: The last time the 4h Bollinger Bands were so tight was Nov 25, 2017 :\-\)

EDIT: Sorry, forgot to mention: Bitfinex
I guess the battle between 7800 and 8400 will decide where the market is going short/mid-term. 
Bullish volume has been strong the past 12 hours or so. The price keeps moving deliberately up and the dips are less pronounced. How ironic would it be if we just sideways'd our way through the ATH log resistance? 

RSI is a little warm right now on the 15M (61). We've had some decent retracement after the BGD last week, but with the 50MA and ATH log resistance so close above us, I'd say it's pretty unrealistic for us to break through. This feels a lot like $11.7k. If we are rejected from 8400 repeatedly today, I would expect another dive to retest 7000. 
sometimes i have to ask myself, are things too obvious in trading?  https://imgur.com/a/tmpXAuo

https://www.tradingview.com/x/H84cHmId/

it could also just be accumulation before a runup but fairly strange place to accumulate
I'm not actively trading right now, just hodling. So that's my disclaimer here. What happens next may also be partially tied to the risk appetite of global markets. But strictly from a fractal pattern recognition and wyckoff perspective, this looks like a "last point of supply" moment similar to October 5th of last year, but on a larger scale. I wouldn't be surprised to see an E2E move on the daily cloud in the next few weeks.

Just wanted to say thanks to all the traders in here (/u/_chewtoy_, /u/C4H8N808, /u/L14dy, /u/Trk-, /u/veltrop, /u/mandy, /u/purboie and others) that regularly post positions and advice. I've managed to grow my Bitcoin stack by 25% since I discovered this sub. 

I don't always agree with what you say, but it's awesome to have a varied and passionate sub to reference my own decisions off of. 

Currently sitting in crypto and waiting for a break one way or another. I have a SL for 30% of my stack at 8170 as I believe if we break that support we are in trouble. I'll be increasing that SL if/when we move upward. This thing has legs in my opinion, and since I'm currently sitting in profit with my SL, I'm feeling fairly secure in my position.
Had a shower thought: buying bitcoins now is similar to what it must have felt like for those buying and squatting on web domains back when the internet started.

there must have been a community or forum somewhere where people would talk about buying one word random web domain names like chairs.com, apple.com, toilets.com, etc where they talked about how valuable these would be in the future if and when the internet became big. 

As the internet got more and more popular people would sell their domains off at their "moon" price and the value of these domains kept rising and rising.

People on the outside probably thought they were a little crazy just like how outsiders look at us with our "magical internet money."

I looked up some of the biggest domain sales in the past...insurance.com sold for $35million USD. PrivateJet.com $30million USD. Internet.com $18million USD. Moon!!! [source](https://www.godaddy.com/garage/the-top-20-most-expensive-domain-names/)

just a random thought. hopefully we will also get there someday too. 


Short on time due to work so I'll keep this short:


Localbitcoin data suggesting a somewhat substantial change in buying activity: https://anacoinda.github.io/localbitcoins/all.html


Seems like market sentiment has been slowly shifting back to bullish. Based off multiple google trends metrics, interest could be slowly building again. Looking for an upward breakout. Bitcoin rich list shows out of the top 95 addresses (excluding the top 5 which are cold wallets for exchanges) 20 have shown a NET buying (bullish) 1 month mentality, whereas only 5 addresses have shown a net selling 1 month mentality. Seeing as whales do move this market, it truly is in the realm of possibility that the bear market is very close to ending. (https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html).



Flair switched back to bullish. Have been back in position since my buys hit a few weeks ago.


EDIT: Out of the top 495, only ~5 Addresses have shown a net selling mentality, and ~52 have shown a net buying mentality, based off address amounts. These numbers are over the last month. https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html 


Edit: Obviously not investment advice, these are just observations. Good luck everybody.


I have a question for the bulls here. Short term I can understand the optimism, it's hard to deny the momentum we have right now. Medium/long term though, I wonder what your thoughts are on what's going to sustain growth?

The initial runup from 8k+ was pure retail mania, average joes buying crypto with the hope of getting rich quick. When the bubble burst there were projects with multi billion dollar evaluations that had no adoption and borderline non existent fundamentals (tron,verge,dentacoin,etc). Even the solid projects were all grossly over evaluated. 

So if this is the start of a new bull run does it mean we are just hoping for the same thing again? That the market will become over evaluated through retail fomo and that we're on the bottom of the ponzi? If so, does everyone  think that the public will be lured in again? A lot of people got burned last run and while the ecosystem around crypto has grown I find it difficult to see people pouring back in at 12k plus after such a brutal crash. It was a very different situation when btc was constantly making new highs as opposed to rebounding from such a drastic decline.

I definitely believe in the value of crypto but I don't see fundamentals alone driving us to ATH's anytime soon. That being said I don't fully rule out the publics greed and the medias ability to push this higher, it's just hard to gauge the publics sentiment from this isloated pocket of the space we share in r/bitcoinmarkets. Any thoughts?
These sells unloading as it all gets eaten away like nothing is amazing to watch
Many have said it over the day. The one I thought was touching was from u/chrisgilesphotography

If today is gut-check time and we go down with this ship, it’s been an honor trading with you gents.

Learned a lot last year, learned even more this year.

Never give em an inch, never let them see you bleed. Smiles for the haters, champagne for my homies!

To the moon!

Ps: I’m hedged as of now
Had a short open from 8180. closed at 8150. 
Dumps getting weaker, and support is moving up by the day.

Opened a long on this price aswell for 25% of my stack on a 10x leverage.

Also adding 10% of my fiat to my hodl stack
Kraken just prevented me from FOMO'ing in. Thanks I guess?

This could go on a long time. For those who are in a position right now, good luck. 
378 btc market sell on finex and the price barely moved at all.

Is finex always like this? 
I reckon theres enough RSI in the 4hr to take it over 8500 just my 2 satoshis worth.. 
[deleted]
So I have now woken up earlier than normal, and longing futures from 8125. Like a predator waiting for the prey that appears at the lake to drink at 0700 UTC and then strike a profit

Probably we do a Bart down to 7900 here instead https://www.tradingview.com/x/S9RuKFSS
Moved the stops on my long up from $7,990 or so to $8,090.

This is starting to look heavy, and BBands are getting pretty tight on short to medium timeframes.

If this breaks down, it has the potential to break down very hard. 

I'm not exiting entirely, however, as the reverse is true in the event of a breakout to the upside.
Ever Since this bart crap..I bought back top tier alts and so far they are dominating..collecting SATs..I'm waiting for the ATH LOG to break so I can dump them back into BTC
Kraken experiencing issues again.  Last time Kraken stuttered for 30 minutes, marked the end of the relief rally.  Bad omen or just down right fuckery, I’m hedging my position.  
stop out the longs, then stop out the shorts. within five minutes. LOL    

Remember when we were in a massive ascending wedge leading up to 11.8k that just barely broke down from its support line but then chopped a bit before continuing to rally up to test the log ATH line?

I really hate putting stock in fractals as a "this is likely to happen" but they're valid as a "this *could* feasibly happen." In that vein, I think the ascending wedge everyone is drawing is a valid formation, but how the market responds to the wedge breaking doesn't necessarily mean an immediate retrace to 7.8k or lower even. Obviously it very well could, but we could also throwback as far as the log resistance, which by Saturday will be down around the 8.5k range.
Oh.

[Well then](https://www.tradingview.com/x/8mBz6wpo/)

I can't imagine being in a bitcoin holding pattern with a greater bunch of misfits. Good luck everyone.
Tethered at 8220, bought back at 8350 like an asshole. Probably will go down but don't expect it to go below $7500 which is about 11% down and hopefully can continue to hedge with alts. However I believe we will go up in the mid to long term and the money I am losing from lost work productivity is adding up so I give in. Good luck to all
After many hours of TA and fundamental consideration I'm finally ready to make a trade here. My conclusion is that if a coin is propelled into the air by a thumbnail thrust violently upward on one edge, the resulting spin will create a 'flip' motion. The properties of the flip are such that once it lands and settles, a binary signal is produced. Heads facing up indicates a time to buy, likewise if its tails, then a sell signal is confirmed. Hope you guys find this insight helpful, good luck out there.
Dumps became so weak, supports absorbing sellers easily and this looks like it's ready to explode through the log resistance any day now. My guess is that in the next couple of days either we break log resistance with good volume, or we range here and log actually slide trough the price. But I don't really think this bear market is over, if it is this was all about bigger bubble. 
To me BTC still looks very uncertain. I am not totally convinced the bear is over yet and expect consolidation to be the reality for a while. Very uncertain and therefore untradeable over shorter timeframes.

For anyone from another forum reading this, etheraddict has banned me as I seem to have hit a salty nerve. Therapy clearly isn't working.
a few days ago someone had made a TA chart with a whole map of a fantasy landscape - can anyone link me to that again? reddit search blows for this kind of thing
The 12h cloud has about one new candle left for an upside breakout. Due to professional commitments, I'm still trading these high timeframe charts and will look to close my long positions if there's no strong move to the upside in the next 24h. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/xcx9HBOZ

That said, I have been adding and taking profits with the chop, but this is just micro-chop; I think we've yet to see the market's response to the BGD of exactly a week ago. Volume is looking solid, but if there's a single player or group of players behind this, I expect to get f*cked myself, so I'll be locking in profit at some stage soon.
I love those mexican standoffs within a 3$ range (8232 currently) at the charts
With the dip that just got rejected, I anticipate another big green candle incoming very soon
I've gone long from 8200.  I've decided it is going up.  Hit me!
I'm having a hard time avoiding FOMO on ETH...  I'm banking on the idea that A. those with BTC are trading it for alts, thus pushing their price up while holding BTC down, meaning that as a whole the market is gaining strong ground and B. once/if alts slow down/reverse people will send their value back to BTC, pumping it.

The issue with that theory is that there are lots of paths from ETH to Fiat these days, so a reversal of alts might not do much for BTC.
Done deal at this point? Bulls seem to be clearly winning the battle

Added $1mm to my $1mm short [here,](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8d2u4j/z/dxke5qp) at $8322. Stops at 5% of CB. I'm not convinced by this slow creep upwards.

Edit: Corrected a typo. Yes, I'm short. 
ETH made contact with its ATH log line 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/hGIxFhep/

Breaking it as I type, think this might have legs and hopefully BTC is next.

EDIT: That other chart was from Coinbase(?), this one from Bitfinex is $100 away from ATH log. https://www.tradingview.com/x/3xuhtoFc/
sold another 25% of my long from $6500 here. 

Leaving the last 25% with a 7800 stop-loss in case this thing goes to $10K
There's about 1500 BTC scattered down from 8.1k to 8k on finex. It seems someone really wants to accumulate right there, which I don't think is a bad idea. We're still a ways off until a bull run but if we do drop from here the max we'll go down is to 6.5k and form a nice double bottom on the daily with 8.4k being the high and then we'll be right back here in several weeks time. Just remember that even in 2017 we bounced from the top of a channel to the bottom several times and there's plenty of low's to buy and high's to sell. Even if we break this resistance we won't go straight to 20k. I doubt we'll even make it to 10k before we have some kind of dip.
Props to all those trading this $8k range as it has been difficult. We're approaching another inflection point where the market will have to decide if it's going to test the historical resistance with a promise of a short term rally or retrace previous lows.  I think we'll see a decisive movement in the next 1-3 days.

[My top level assessment of the current situation](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Ty1Og4TU/)
korea and japan are fomoing, so thats cool.
I bought my first bitcoin in mid January.  I was down about 60% when I started reading this sub everyday. This sub and some decent alt picks now have me up about 15% with no shorts or leverage, just long or cash in varying percentages.

I'm not used to making money in crypto. I'm used to throwing more money in to DCA.  My entire gut is screaming go to cash.  My brain is tling me to put more money in to get my BTC to ALT ration around 75/25.

Help! 
I'm getting the feeling there is going to be a long squeeze here.
If you are trading in USD and think this isn't moving, try trading in UKP.  Boy.

Where does everyone have their ATH descending log trend lines at? What price would we have to close at to break it?

Thinking of opening a short as high as i can catch it since i dont think we will smash straight through, atleast not straight away.
For those of you who went short thinking we would break down out of the ascending wedge. What’s the game plan now? Where are your stops set?
No idea where this is going. Set stops at 8500 and 7800 for the night. Godspeed gents.
These threads have been pleasant for the past 3 days. I wonder who's missing.
(anecdotal) r/cryptocurrency is meme'd up beyond recognition anticipating lift off.
I am ready. Please don't hurt me again Bitcoin. 
'Make sure you have tight stops in place'

Oh my word
Five 12+ coin market buys on GAX during that break through 8275. The whales have arrived, it seems.
Remember when we were testing 11800? It feels a lot like that.
Short at 8240 5x leverage. This bear may have a few legs left. I expect us to retest 7800-8000. Stop loss at 8375. 
Seems a lot more choppy than usual this morning. Like there is strong reactionary buying and selling pressure.
With those weaker dips, I think it's time to buy more spot price real btcs. Another good reason is alt coin trading, they have started moving already and to have btc prepared is good 
Here’s some advice before you start taking others. Go to a one day chart that shows a significant movement.
Go to the previous days daily.

See who is and isn’t a genius. 
Almost everyone on tradingview is expecting a retrace before we hit the log line. Maximum pain?
bulls are not letting this dip, 8160 was eaten quickly
Can we get a fund together to buy these two one tuna sandwich each?

I am long from 6850 5x. Took from profit at 8250.

For the first time in a long time I am completely unsure where we go next.

The long term resistance just has me thinking we could go to 4 or 2k even. But if I ignore it I just see us rising to 20-30k without much in the way. It’s bonkers what that rise did to all TA. It like two scales interacting with each other and the bigger scale is just too heavy for any small scale support. Eventually we crumble everytime. I’m stopping out at 7850 if we get there just out of pure bewilderment.
Feels like I'm the only one here sitting this out. Gonna be trading the breakout and/or shorting from 8500-8700 depending on the resistance there or joining the masses after that.
https://www.tradingview.com/x/dwpHgAgb oh god what is this

I had a lowish order at 8222 that got filled. Now for the real test of 8250 :D
I was gonna say spoofing, but that guy is actually buying a lot. 
[removed]
Can anyone actually point to real activity increases? Or is this just people, that sold, buying back in?

The only increase I saw was the post about the coin count in the LN increasing from 10 to 16, which is a *joke*.

EDIT: The only activity increase I see are on OKex and Bitmex in the number of open contracts. Back at 11.6k, Bitmex swaps topped out around 525M contracts but fell to around 335M by the bottom two weeks ago. They're now back up to 471M. Mind you, they held in the low 300M's late last year during November and December.

So it's clear people are moving coins over to Bitmex and using them as collateral to gamble in hopes of winning more coins.
If we get past 8500 on bfx, all hell will break loose
Likelihood of aggregate crypto market cap breaking $1T in 2018?
Shorting here with stops at 8420. Pretty safe imo considering this wedge, the resistance ahead and I got a strong feeling our market maker loaded up on his shorts. Also I checked the full order book and the big buys below 8100 don't look legit and might get pulled if we go there.
Really thought i would have woken up to a big dildo in either direction. Why is this taking so long to pop?

Watch out for April 26th - The downtrend from the ATH intersects with the past week's bullish uptrend support line.  I believe we are set up for some big moves either way.  I'm just hoping it's to the upside.
Long from 7940. 3D MACD has turned green and successfully remained there longer than last time. 

Log resistance is a very strong magnet. Expecting to close half my position once it hits that trend line. 


ETH is still pumping like hell. Will we follow? Really tempted to fomo long into this.

I'm not entirely sure, but I found what ***could*** be a small rising wedge on the 1h charts.

This is what I have. Is it okay that there are two wicks that momentarily broke out, or does that invalidate the potential pattern?
Hey fellas - been on vacation for the last few days. What’d I miss? Sounds like more of the same as The Bartings seem to continue. Hope all is well with you all. 
It seems the trend line from 8460 is making the current rising wedge break down :

Loos to me like we are at the end of a symmetric triangle. First upwards breakout attempt (an hour ago) was pulled back into the triangle.

The triangle will close in about 4 hours. Bigger move to be expected within that time frame?
Someone flashed a 1500BTC buy wall @8200 on BFX. What's the point, really? I think most of us by now are not even considering those walls, and we all now all pumps and dumps come from hidden orders.
https://www.tradingview.com/x/T0tqTAma/

Looks like we broke out (with a successful retest) of the range that we'd been in for the past week, just depends if it can bust through the resistance the fakeout a couple days ago failed to break.
I'm not trying to fud at all but isn't "taming bitcoin" what the futures guys said they would do?  What if being stuck in this range like this with shorters and longers both terrified to make a move is just the new reality?  I know the volume isn't enough in futures to do this, but maybe the guys that made the ["taming bitcoin" proclamations](https://www.coindesk.com/cme-groups-leo-melamed-well-tame-bitcoin/) know about psychological effects on spot markets, etc.?

Also, partially related, have barts ever been seen like this in the history of bitcoin?  I don't remember ever seeing it look like this.
How are you guys drawing the major ATH resistance line?  Depending on if you use 17k or 11.7k as the 2nd point of contact, it results in a couple of hundred $ difference today, so I was just curious what most people were doing.

Bitstamp daily... all I'm watching right now is this

https://imgur.com/a/8Z88IwE
While the SAT value has not gone down significantly, the volume on the alts I'm watching have really gone down. Is that a sign? Being already surprised that the mini alt bull cycle preceded the btc bull cycle, seems like rules change every time.
For everyone who is adding to their shorts here: I'm not saying you're wrong, I get that the ATH log resistance is in sight and whatnot, but are you really sure you want to do this before there's any positive confirmation that this is going to roll over? Missing a little bit of the next downtrend will probably not kill you but getting rekt might.

The closer we get to that ATH line, the more likely it is that some whale is going to push very hard to rocket past it; and meanwhile, some alts are already rocketing past theirs, which is overall very bullish for this market in this moment.
Probably too good to be true, but something to watch for moving forward and it would fit well with the current market movement.

alts leading rally: it's not a bitcoin bullrun but money within the space being greater fool gambled. Will come to an end soon I think.

I called 6.5k as a local bottom but I don't think this will be a new bull run here. I am a seller here
lol 1500 BTC buy wall at $8270
Mr. Bollinger says the time is ripe for another move. anybody else doing drugs? 'coz you don't need it as long as crypto trading is here!
What is the difference between : 

- the last time we reached 11.7k, and everybody expected a new bullrun. At that time, all alts were dropping like hot.


-now, when we reached 8.2k, and everybody (almost) expects a new bullrun. Only this time, alts are going nut while we expect BTC

Don't all coins look a tad bit too overbought? Expect this to go down before going up again. Overall looks quite bullish
man i feel shell shocked from the last few days. im currently in fiat.  all signs point to a retest of the log resistance as far as i can tell. but my ptsd from the last few days tells me that as soon as i enter a long it'll finally retrace back to 7500. Clock is ticking, we're almost at the end of our wedge. 
There are some slight bearish divergences for both PVT and Accumulation/Distribution on the 30-minute chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/QMckyHl9/

This could all be negated with another BGC, but if I were a bullish whale, I would be waiting to do my thing until we get much closer to the ATH downtrend, so that we can assuredly blow past it. So we might be in a bit of a no-man's land right now.

Still long and holding.
How realistic is it that this might dump 10% over the next 48 hours? When's the last time that happened? I want to believe that 7.8-8 would hold at least temporarily but I'm also worried about a cascade effect.
Liquidation on my long is ~7.5, I could either use my unused margin to lower it or buy more contracts with that margin and put in some fresh fiat, but that'll take a couple of days to reach my account. Of course I know the smart course of action. But the situation is tempting. 
Does anyone actually believe we'll break the ATH log resistance in the next couple weeks?  We're close to it
I think going sideways here would be the best case scenario for the bulls. If we can stay above 8.2 for the next 24 hours I can imagine this will make another push up and I'll be closing my shorts then. I don't think it will take much, though, to start a wave of selling that would put us back under 8k. 
It's crazy what the past few weeks have done to me.  
I am now thinking something is wrong if there is no big drop.  
[deleted]
I don't actually believe on this one, but man, wouldn't it be nice? 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/VMwesVDz/

It could even be more bullish if i used the 6k bottom to trace the blue line, but 23k would be too much.
I know we've had lots of bullish action, and I'm still long with a chunk of my (small) stack, but to me right now this feels like I'm watching a toddler on its tippy toes, at the top of the stairs, going for something just out of reach.
It seems the volume is pretty good right now. Am i a newb, or am i right ?

Rising wedge on 4hr? https://www.tradingview.com/x/t3p9gYtn/

Considering shorting to 7.8k and then stacking buys at intervals down to 7.5k but dont have the balls lol

edit: not touching this, off to bed and busy tomorrow so no point entering anything.

which line would be more significant out of the wedge resistances? https://www.tradingview.com/x/iqFomQsx/


Looks like i wasnt deceiving myself seeing this ascending triangle : 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/uhEbX3LS/

It seems the support on the buying side it gets better and better each day... look how fast we came back to 8160 range.
There is one thing I’m 100% sure about. 

I will not be sleeping tonight. 

Adderall and Red Bull and charts till I die 


Bartman needs to happen now for the shorters.
My observation has been that the alts have lead BTC rallies and when alt runs start to exhaust, BTC gets fed from alt profits and goes on a run of its own to level out the ratios.  This is what I am seeing here.  So when I see BTC dominance fall, I see new money that will be moving into BTC at some point.  This is what I could see catalyzing BTC over 8.5k.

I'm standing PAT (default long, trading stack agnostic) myself until the market decides to break up past 8.5 or down through 7.8.  Interested to see whether this plays out.
Anyone with an eye on long/shorts that can tell me if the selling on finex is spot or margin?
How are the bbands looking at the moment? 
kraken loads but won't let me cancel my open orders and their support page is down. woo boy.

edit: now they're just down when I try to log in from mobile
triangle about to end soon. tight stops ppl
Tax year settled, 3-4 month bear market already and people screaming bull are the main reasons why a red dildo isn't making me reach for the sell button. It could be the same for others.
With all these bounces (up-down, and down-up straight away), i don't think even scalpers had any time to do anything today.
Pretty much:

                       The domino effect 
A question for both bulls and bears, do you feel that your outlook towards the market has changed in the last 24 hours, if so, how?
Interestingly it seems that ETH is already on its log resistance line and fighting for the breakout. It could be a good future glimpse into bitcoins actions. 
Is bitcoin the "bonds" to altcoins' "equities" in a modern crypto portfolio?  I find crypto portfolio creation fascinating and have been thinking about this a lot recently.

>**Bonds**

>The relative stability of bonds helps to balance the risk in a portfolio. Bond interest payments are added to the portfolio at regular intervals whether the bond issuers' immediate growth prospects are good or bad, so when stock markets are going down, the value of bonds often rise or at least fall less, which helps to balance out portfolio values during volatile conditions. An investor who wants to limit the risk of losing money in the stock market will want to have a heavier allocation of bonds in his portfolio.




>**Equities**

>Equities have an important place in a portfolio because they promise the highest returns over time. Equities also carry the most risk. Equity share prices can fall dramatically at times depending on stock market conditions.

Transactions per second are going up again, which I believe it means new money is coming in (or money that got taken out).

That last 24h has been wick city. Suggests to me that people are expecting a breakout but bulls and bears keeping things in check for now.  Won’t be long as the wedge on the 15min is narrowing
Added more to my 8240 short I posted about a few hours ago at 8390. Had a stop limit set at 8375, changed to 8525. I’m skeptical of this bull

I just can’t get myself to believe that we won’t test 7800-8000 again
Okay, what.


I have never been more confused. Everything was pointing to the bear side. We had a rising wedge, we had bearish RSI, bearish MACD. But still, we broke *UP* from the rising wedge.


I am lucky I chose to stay out of position.


This market sometimes, I swear.
It's really been the M.O. of this bear market to push up against resistance for extended periods of time, bringing back FOMO and the appearance of a reversal, only to quickly snap back lower. Think of our first test of 11.8, then revisiting at 11.6/11.7, or the bounce to 9.8, or from 7.3 up to 9/9.2. We're nearing the ATH log resistance and everything *feels* quite bullish, but were not quite there yet. If there was ever a time for another fakeout, this is probably what it would look/feel like. 


I think today we will hit log trend line from 19K around 8550
Can someone help me out? I’m looking for a digital thing that looks sorta like a digital clock... you can put the names of about 3 crypto coins in it and it’ll constantly stream the prices of those particular across the screen in real-time. Someone linked to it a few months ago and they were for sale. What are they called?
Wtf is happening ?
Alts led the way. 9.8 tgt in 3 weeks. Alt/btc ratio needs to cool off. 
Getting down to crunchtime for the hourly ascending wedge. I think we're going to break down violently and I'm positioned accordingly

https://www.tradingview.com/x/vyQKu7Ys/


Short 200 contracts at 8250, I'm usually conservative but this is a relatively big contract for me. 10x leverage. If we make a higher high above 8.4 I'll bail. 
Does anyone have a graph of the ATH log resistance
https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/HIIQLGOd-Try-again/


The fact that this has been so accurate is scary as hell to me.

And this is also extremely worrying.
There is a bearish presence missing from this sub the past few days. 
[removed]
This sub should be renamed the bears den. Everyone else is partying like it's 2017 and you guys are still poopooing the bull run.
Don't worry guys Bitfinex is bullish and will not let the Price down before the log trendline get at least hit. We can all go 100x margin long until there...lets dot it!( sarcasm)

I'm bearish for the next couple of days:

-We are in a short term up-trend from 6500->8300. 
-This looks to be a triple top forming....

Unless we get real good news, I could see us just drifting back down to $7500 over the painfully slow course of the next two weeks.

Which is fine for me because payday is comin' up so heyo!
This is getting ridiculous, bears can't even move the price for 1% anymore. Really thinking to close my underwater shorts, luckily that I was not greedy and lossses will be small. 
Here comes the manipulation.
I'm pretty sure a lot of this sell pressure comes from yolo shorters on bitmex gambling away their trust funds through leverage and bad decisions.
Is it not weird that this entire 'mini run' was started by an obviously manipulated BGD? There's really no difference to the fundamentals or any news which should have sparked this. Isn't that odd? Would like to hear your thoughts.
I get the feeling we're going to break the ATH > Bulltrap downtrend where longs pile in, with the short squeeze already happened killing a lot of buying pressure we'll probably drop to test to confirm as support but then fail on the bounce to go higher than 9100 which should help us push down through the higher volume nodes into the 4700-5200 area where very little volume has been traded.

I'll close my short from 8450 above the 50d SMA which is a slight profit(probably breakeven with fees) and look for weakness further up. Wont be going long with any decent amount until we pull back and have a clearer idea of where we seem to be heading. I'm going to trade with the trend until it's clear it's changed (with stops to save me from a giant fomo candle and alarms for where I want to evaluate what to do with my position).

Our local high of ~8470 was just under the 50D MA, weekly resistance, top of the daily bbands(which we touch before going to the bottom in this bear market) and a pivot point. S1 on the daily pivots is showing around 5075  which coincides with a gap in the volume profile and very close to the 5K ATH with a high volume node below 4750 which should also act as support IF we get there. That's my long term play that I'll probably leave run unless we break the 50D MA. 

On the bullish case it's a little weak, if we stay around here a bit longer we may well push up but it doesn't feel like there's enough buying power there at the moment but we shall see. Taking a long here feels like taking a long at 11.7K just with less potential reward so unless you've been holding a long for a week pre BGD (or w/e it's being called) I just wouldn't consider a long here.

Ichimoku seems to be showing some interesting info but I'm new to it so I'll leave that one to people who can interpret it better than me cus I'm still trying to wrap my head around the terminology and how it works.

Here's a chart (without the MAs because it was just too cluttered - be kind it's my first time really using TV) simply illustrating the bbands movements of piercing top band, testing middle, bottom, reverse and vice versa - we have tested the top and haven't ridden along the top on the daily since the bull run that I can see from a glance. Pivots and volume profile and how they seem to nicely align with 5K : https://www.tradingview.com/x/MwR9kQBS/
[4h BB's](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ly7KQNx2/) looking fucking juicy. If we breach [1D BB](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Aa2FLBK1/) with certainty (and close above it) could be the beginning of another mega-bull market.
I woke up early to check to see if this rising wedge was still looking valid with last night's contact points:

https://i.imgur.com/qGAxQ1W.png

Thoughts on where to enter this? A quick scan of the sub makes it feel like an upward breakout is inevitable, which usually gets my alarm bells tingling, but it feels like the deep pockets will spend the money to push the price to log resistance.

if 8300 can break with conviction will ride it till 8500 for some good scalping. Staying in tether at the moment. Looking at buy orders at 8090 as well. Tricky tricky.
[removed]
Current stop loss is 8000 for a small loss. I'll be bumping it up to 8050 if we reach 8250. Trying to keep a $200 gap between the price and my SL.

What do you all have as stop losses if this thing gets sent to the Upsidedown?
I'm thinking about going short and long here, equal size positions, and once a true clear direciton has been established, closing one. Long the swap or the future? Trying to weigh out the pros and cons here. IF we break up it could be a big one meaning long futures could be good, but they will take a beating if we dump which I think is more likely than a big breakout.
Seems like a possible ascending [wedge](https://prnt.sc/j7jra9) is forming on the daily. Might be a good entry for a short above bearish resistance but a dagnerous entry as there might be lots of FOMO if we go past that line.
[deleted]
Closed my long from 8.2 - I figured I'd be happy if it went up regardless of whether I was in position or not but if it went down I wouldn't be happy. 

I looked at the 1D and just saw the perfect Bart formation crying out to be completed and I'm just too spooked. If I had a better entry point between 7.9 and 8.1 I would've held on but this is a bit too precarious. 
Curious to see what happens after it breaks 8400
Anyone else looking at shorting the ETHBTC ratio? Bitcoin is likely to reverse here or soon and everything else should tank harder in this scenario. INB4 not bitcoin related. I'm shorting ethBTC meaning it's a trade with bitcoin
Organic growth till the dildo that rules them all.
I think now it's the perfect time to go yolo long, min 10x leverage. Worth to try with a few bucks.
Brian Kelly on again today talking about Bitcoin on Fast Money #bearish

Bullish, this is the turnaround guys. 
[deleted]
Doesn't look like this Bitcoin bull train is stopping anytime soon. 

u/DushmanKush and the regular bears got liq'd? 
Bullish momentum looks strong but it is possible that this is just one giant trap for bulls whereby we get a massive spike up right above the log downtrend line to shakeout even the strongest of bears before we get dumped on to the tune of a 2000+ big red candle.  

Edit: Why do my posts never show up? 
Is a stop market buy at around 8,350  terrible idea right now? Maybe a bit higher?
Crossover on the 1h
One thing I don't understand about this rally is the complete reverse of the 'normal' narrative, which is; new money coming in first goes to the safety of BTC and when a bull is established in BTC, people feel comfortable enough taking risk (with these gains) which then flow to higher risk alts.

But now alts are leading the rally, how come? Maybe the 'new' money is coming from established users which directly go to alts? Or is it some manufactured rally for max pain?
grrr same time as yesterday...Now lets see how we shake back..  Hows volume? Hows RSI? 
These wicks seem longer than usual. Catching the chart when it's dumping is scary - always fearing the BRD - but I check a minute later and it's back to the steady gentle rise we've been experiencing these last few days.
Haven't seen a candle wick like that in a long time.
Which is good exchange platform which allows margin trading with Fiat collateral rather than XBT / BTC?
https://www.tradingview.com/x/AJ2QV2jM/

These sudden spikes reached the resistance and support line of this rising wedge.

Does that mean something?
Looks like the action is started. Has to cross the day high.
What timeframe would y'all recommend monitoring as far as timing the next Bart-move?

Alternatively, what price would you set an alert for?
Hey fellas, wanted to share this live analysis of BTC and trading. Open discussion for anyone interested.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfD74F2QOoU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfD74F2QOoU)
Is this looking more like an ascending triangle than an ascending wedge to anyone else?  Or is my bias showing?
Anyone got any idea why June futures are trading behind both spot and September futures. That makes zero sense to me
So I'm seeing a lot of people shorting now which seems to be the obvious move. (I am tethered up since 8220 since I don't do leveraged trades) Why aren't you guys afraid of the short squeeze/ stop loss hunting in this highly manipulated market after seeing it so many times in the last couple weeks? It just appears that MM are punishing those making leveraged trades that would otherwise make sense in any other market. 
The order book looks stacked with underwater shorts looking to dip out on any retrace. 
You know how I see this?    The bear market from December 17th onwards to April 9th was the A-wave of an Elliott A-B-C correction, and we're currently in the B-wave.    This will be coupled with a C-wave to take BTC down below $2000, although if the A-wave took this long, one would seemingly think that there will be more upside before we resume the downtrend in wave C.
So i have an underwater short from 7900. I missed the dip to the low 7.9k yesterday by a few dollars. I'm really torn now. Last time we had a rising wedge like this, it broke up and we had a short trip around 8.4k. There is also a lot of buying pressure so touching the log resistance is not impossible. I could close it now at a moderate loss (12% of my trading stack), but the choice is difficult. Any advice?
The 1500BTC guy is back again, flashing it's penis at us.

#flashingshouldstayillegal
This starts to make me feel really uneasy here...

I mean if the bull is real we should be over 8400 since some hours...
The question is ...  are little Barts  giving a hint for a possible  huge Bart?

The latest episode of[ Buy or Sell, What The Hell](https://thedistributedpost.com/2018/04/18/easy-on-the-regulations-23/) talks about Bitcoin price action and gives some key pointers as to what is likely to happen in the markets. Also covers the shifting regulations with Kraken and Binance and how it will impact Bitcoin trading. 
I know this isn't entirely BTC related, so if not allowed go ahead and remove. It seems a lot of alts are moving with or without btc and maintaining when it spikes downwards. Does anyone have a site that shows BTC in comparison to alts? It used to be there and had a bunch of listed but I forgot. I think it would be helpful for btc trading in this situation.

Be patient. Given regulatory risks and bans on advertising and the recent bank bans in india / pakistan and the low google trends searches, it is likely this will break down as no real FOMO is being created (other than whales FOMOing each other).

Buy when it is 15% lower and save yourself money.
Is it happening?


Added to my short. I’ll prob get bent over and handed it to

BTCUSD shorts are rising and I don't think it's clueless people opening them. So if you're buying now, it might be from big money ready to dump on you, just a heads up to assess the risk buying right under a big resistance.
Looking bearish
Oh look at that, just another 150+ BTC Sell wall. Nothing to see here...
System overload in 5 seconds.... start the bull FOMO clock

The battle for the log line will be fought at 8.4 and the battle for 8.4 has to be fought right here. If bears don't hold 8.3 then the momentum alone will carry us over the line at least temporarily. 

Bears to your battle stations else hand over the tuna like chumps. 
What a trap. Hidden sell wall @ 8,296.8. No one knows how big but it is going to get chewed up soon. 
Daily Bitcoin Update (4/19/18) + Technical Analysis

Significant selling pressure on gdax atm, with 120 btc for sale within a $1 range. Noticing this elsewhere, too?
Gonna hedge a bit and sell 50% of my stack if we make 8300 again (purchased at 8130). I'm showing the ATH log trend line at 8360. Will set a SL to buy back in if we break 8425. I'll happily take the loss if we break the log trend convincingly.
Dominance going lower and lower, where are the guys saying it would go back to 80%?
Before FOMOing in at these prices, look at it this way. It is uncertain that prices will be much higher than they are now (10%+). However, it is almost guaranteed they will be lower. So, my point is, you can guarantee (very high propability) a lower price point just by waiting versus taking a huge risk of a swing trade that goes bad on you. The reason for why prices will definitely head lower:

1. More and more bannings which represent about 1/3 of the world population reduces future growth potential (india / pakistan / china effectively banned the easy purchase of crypto).

2. ICOs created incentive to spend 100s of millions on advertising to bring in new sheep to fleece. With the crack down on both ICOs overall and on ICO advertising (advertisements soon to be banned on twitter, facebook, and google platforms) it creates less avenues to reach those sheep in order to unload bags to them.

3. Several exchanges are under investigation and facing regulatory issues

4. 400 million dollars of a "virtual currency exchange" fiat accounts were seized by polish authorities. It is likely one of Bitfinex accounts though we will never know as they did not release their official statement as they said they would

5.  Mania is dying. "Bitcoin" searches in google are down to July lows, which is really low considering "bitcoin" encompasses 5 different coins whereas that keyword only represented 1 coin back in July

6. On-chain transactions are at 2 year lows.


Is it just me or is btc stable as fuck?

I am not sure if btc was this stable ever before.

I am refreshing my exchanges page every few minutes because I have feeling the price froze on me but nope, it's not moving.
[deleted]
I still don't understand the general overly positive outlook on shitcoins with Lightning so close on the horizon...?
Breakout failed? I guess it's time to test the other direction... I'm scared...

See you at 8230 in an hour...
Thoughts on how these exchanges screw you. I have some BTC on Whaleclub which I use to short / long depending on... stuff. The rest of my portfolio is USDT on Binance. So - on Whaleclub - even if I successfully short say BTC and increase my holding when the market dumps - the value of my BTC held on the exchange also decreases relative to fiat? So am I correct in saying my position relative to Fiat / USD remains the same if I short with no leverage - i.e. the increase due to my short is offset to the decrease in the value of BTC held?  
The alt shitkids are ecstatic over what appears to be sudden bullishness.  They're going to get suckered in and lose a whole bunch more money before selling their January alt bags a few months from now at 3% of ATH and then FOMO back in near the top of the next actual crypto bull market years from now.    

Short alts, short BTC, and do it all on low leverage because the liquidations flow in both directions.
[removed]
My last comment not withstanding, I have a noobish question. The main altcoins I watch are those on gdax - ltc, bch, eth. They've been pumping the last couple days, but in the last hour their ratio is dropping significantly. Could this be a sign that people are now cashing out of those in anticipation of a large rise for btc (get money into fiat to buy btc)? Or, if it is a sign of anything, is it more likely a precursor to a btc back-step?

Great write-up.

You'll likely get some "so it could go up, down, or sideways. Thanks asshole" responses, but this is the type of prescriptive analysis that keeps me posting here. 
Saved this in a word doc. Please post more.
For the bear case, did you mean May 8?
Given that we're about a month later and we seem to have followed somewhere between bull and sideways, do you have an update?
your bear case is way off. That line should be pointing straight down if we get under 7500 lol
Shit guys. Looks like we're going to actually have to buy some of this if we want it to go up. Where's the fun in that?! 
Ok
My bot is confused, it wants me to buy something called MTL - bad bot.
Seems like bart has no hair anymore, only edges. We come from one edge back to the other.
Anything special about LBC in Canada vs other countries buddy?
Not at all. You can see the actual volume here: https://coin.dance/volume/localbitcoins

A bunch of $1.00 transaction does not matter. What matters is actual volume.
Localbitcoins volume is making new lows weekly.

https://coin.dance/volume/localbitcoins/all

With their KYC/AML enforcement as of late, it will just keep going down. 
Both of those could be explained more by tax season and bank issues driving people away from exchanges than by fundamentals. In Canada, taxes are due April 30th and Quadrigacx has been struggling to give everyone their money, finally about to catch up at the end of the month. 
Exact same price too lol 
tighter than Dick's hatband
This post seems familiar...


But the battle between 8400 and 9000 will be fought with sticks and stones.
Personally can’t see this thing breaking down now, not sure where it would be going if it did. Would just be another weak downturn before bouncing back up. 

Upwards on the other hand has way more potential and driving reasons IMO

Also bears on this sub have gone very quiet compared to a week ago. Not seeing many of the 1-3k guys shooting their mouth any more 
Hint: it’s up.
I think theres a big difference to 11,7k, since this time the whole market and most alts are on the move upwards, while last time only BTC was dragging the market up. This time it feels like BTC is held back only by bears who desperately want to see prices \<6k$. But who knows.
Yes, I believe that it actually is distribution. I don't know when it will break down so I'm not in any positions right now, but I'm sure as hell not gonna long this.
Shrug, if it is accumulation, maybe attempts to lower the price in recent days to accumulate lower failed.
You always find a way to incite the FOMO in me, thanks :)
Thanks for the shout-out and I'm glad you mentioned you don't always agree. You shouldn't. Relative to some here I'm still a noob as well so take my analysis at face value. It's just what me, some random dude on the internet, is thinking.

As a word of advice to everyone new reading these dailies: view everything with a critical eye (hell, even this very post!). In the end, it's your money and your responsibility. Don't make a trade based on someone else's analysis unless you understand it. For instance, I don't have much knowledge of the ichimoku cloud, so I try not to put much stock in people who post TA using it. Not because I think it's bad analysis necessarily, but because I can't verify it (or don't feel like taking the time to).

When someone here posts some chart, try to make sure you really understand all aspects of it. If someone posts a chart using an indicator or pattern you haven't heard of (or even one you aren't rock solid knowing all about it), go Google it and learn yourself on it. There's plenty of free resources out there. For instance, the pattern site is great for chart patterns and includes trading strategies for most patterns and how reliable they are.

Furthermore, try to get an in depth understanding of them rather than a surface level. Don't just know what a bull flag looks like. Try to understand *why* they form and the underlying market sentiment that causes them. Additionally, pay attention to other contributing factors to a pattern. Many patterns have characteristic volume profiles or price action leading up to it that makes them more reliable.

And as far as indicators go, don't just understand the signals they give off (ie overbought vs oversold or divergences for a variety of indicators). Try to understand the basic calculations of the indicator and what they're trying to quantify, many aren't terribly complicated and they can help give you a better perspective of how to use them. For divergence, make sure you understand *why* it's a divergence on a deeper level than "price did this, indicator did this."

All of these things are generally a single quick Google away. For many things you'll end up googling them multiple times (I know I did), hopefully internalizing more and more information about the subject matter and making your understanding of it more and more nuanced.

In the end, experience in the market is certainly a very important factor and irreplaceable, particularly from an emotional standpoint, but learning as much as you can as quickly as you can about things you see mentioned will get you up and running faster. Learning/studying historical BTC data will help greatly as well. As you get better and better at understanding and making your own opinion regarding other people's charts, you'll start seeing more and more things on your own and become more and more self reliant.

One last note, mind that most resources were put together for traditional markets, so time frames for patterns will probably be a bit longer than in the crypto sphere.

Okay that got a lot longer than I was planning. I'll probably post it as a top level comment next daily.
Also thanks to u/mikedbc (?), u/haserfauld...
I was surprised to see my name in there, I'm way less experienced than those guys! But thanks I really appreciate it :-) Safe trading!

Whatever the hell "transaction volume" means... it looks next to meaningless as the price has fluctuated greatly while that first graph grew fairly consistently.

https://coin.dance/volume/localbitcoins/all

Volume of trades on localbitcoins is still trending down.
If bitcoin jumped from $20K to $100K in the same manner it jumped from $5K to $20K, you bet your ass those same people who got burned on the way down from $20K will be chomping at the bit the second time around. 

And there will be a fresh crop of FOMO investors who missed the last big move throwing their money at the rally as well. 

As a collective, humans are pretty dumb. Particularly when it comes to money. 

For many, throwing $1000 at bitcoin when it's on the way up is not too different from throwing $100 at lottery tickets when powerball gets up into stratosphere. 
I would be super surprised if Coinbase (expansions, index fund) and Gemini (large block purchases) would be going through the capital expenditures to support these ventures if there was not demand from bigger fish. 

For the people I know that own Bitcoin, I think that it is speculation and FOMO for the next thing that comes out, side chain/LN adoption, ETF, overtakes a portion of gold for reserves, etc. 

As someone smarter than I said, at some point, with the risk/reward being what it is, it is actually not terribly smart to NOT own some BTC, just in case. 
my take is that the real FOMO won't happen until BTC crosses over $20,000. Once it does, thats when the next bull run will actually start for real. Up until that point, most people will be too scared to buy a dead cat bounce 
Supply, demand, and trust. A handful of neckbeards made Bitcoin worth $1000. Only a small percentage of people own any, and many people who do own are accumulating happily on these dips. All it takes is for one percent more to adopt, and the price will explode as the supply, in reality, gets smaller over time as people accumulate and send the coins offline.

Trust is important as well. Nine years is a pretty long time, and the Bitcoin blockchain is by far the biggest, most decentralized and most powerful. In time it will be considered a safe-haven asset, but it's already being seen by savvy investors as a good hedge against traditional market chaos. It has nowhere to go but up in the longer term, though many of us are hoping the fools smash it back down so we can get more before the next explosion up. If you've been watching Bitcoin for any length of time, you've seen this many times, a big "crash" followed by a huge run up. I absolutely guarantee that we will smash through $20K at some point this year.
> The initial runup from 8k+ was pure retail mania, average joes buying crypto with the hope of getting rich quick. 

Except it really wasn't. I can count the amount of people I know irl with crypto on one hand. 
> So if this is the start of a new bull run does it mean we are just hoping for the same thing again?

Ab-so-lutely - nothing has changed.
Slow and steady rises are the most dangerous times to go short. 
I'm not fucking selling!
what did he say, profile is deleted
3 good moves imo.  Especially the 1st and really especially the 3rd one.  2nd one is a coin toss, but great RR at this time.
and why are you continuing to trade on a platform thats so dysfunctional? 


I’m Assuming your either waiting for 8500 to break or 7800 to fall to enter a position?
The breakdown could be very brief though--that is not some giant end-all rising wedge.
Yes. I've seen 500 btc buy or sell into a hidden wall just for the price to sit there afterwards for hours

I think we'd be better served to go somewhat sideways for the next 12 hours, but if Bitcoin gonna moon, far be it for me to stop it.
But pumping to wash out a bunch of shorts is a fairly new phenomenon. How does that change your calculus about previous patterns via those emotional reactions? (This green dildo is sharper than the last... ouch!)
Craeful! Bears drink from the same lake.
If we go to 7900 I think I'll have to recharge my long again.
Out of curiosity, are you on swaps or futures? I know you usually quote spot but trade futs. The discount on June futs has been pretty extreme, such that an equivalent stop of 8090 would still be sub 8K. Wicks have been ridiculous though. I feel like given my entry on June futs (8070), if I was going to set 8030, I might as well set B-E. 
What made you change your mind on your short from 8.3?
I think I know the answer, but do you ever short alt ratios?
So you’re expecting it to break down? But you’re staying in your long because the upside is huge if it breaks out? 
Almost completely unreachable. I assume this is a traffic volume thing which would be bullish long term but after that extended downtime I have serious misgivings about them.
Isn't Kraken shutting down?
For lack of a better word, wedges "suck." 

They don't perform especially well when they break out "as expected."

A breakdown from a rising wedge has no defined target for the breakdown, and it's quite common for the market to retest support-turned-resistance at some point following the breakdown. 

Since that line is ascending, you could very well short the breakdown only to find that your short is underwater a few hours or days later. 

When they break out counter to expectations, however, they're a lot easier to trade. 

A breakout to the upside here would likely see the resistance line of the formation turn into strong support. A long entered above the resistance-turned-support line becomes stronger as time progresses, because that line is ascending. Quite rapidly in this case. 

If this breaks down, it's still a risky short play until $7,800 falls. 
I think that's what a lot of us are seeing. The fact that we've been mostly in tight, sideways movement today is helpful in that once a break occurs, it should be rather decisive and violent. So the opportunity to trade the move should be there. You just hope there isn't a huge fake-out like last Thursday, though.

[Good question.](https://snag.gy/Zb4Okq.jpg) 
Buy side looks incredibly stacked. Not so much a reliable indicator but the bears have been in incubation for the past few days minus the random barts. 
*pulls out trumpet*

*awaits signal for Reveille or Taps*
Hopefully Bitcoin does you right, but if it's any consolation from a meta standpoint this feels like one of those runs that just gradually pushes its way up regardless of the sell walls and resistance in front of it. 

At least for now. I'm targeting a 8450 sell before we pull back to the low 8300's.
The most beautiful description of a coin toss I have ever laid my eyes upon.

I can automate that!
But how does one flip a digital coin. I have long since forgon the archaic  coins of old.
If we slide through, it could just become support and we still drift down.

Welcome to the club, guys a joke better off out of that cesspit. You were always alright.
He banned me too for questioning him once. He’s a nutcase. Your posts will be missed. 
:(
Agreed. I'm sticking to 6h and above.

Sorry to hear that. There seemed to be many underlying issues there that made me steer away. Ironic, tho, if you think about it... low volume subs.
> etheraddict has banned me

He has far too much influence on that sub, shame that the best people still go there.
Hey, that sucks he blocked you. Ethinsider used to be my go to for crypto lurking but it has gone downhill for sure. For all the plebs,  please keep posting your thoughts somewhere on Reddit because me as well as others still lurk your comments and do appreciate your insight. When this party is all over I would like to buy you guys your drink of choice at a bar on the beach somewhere. Thanks man. You may feel like posting thoughts on the internet are worthless or non impactful but trust me they help. If you are ever in Tennessee and need anything just PM me

He’s crazy
> etheraddict has banned me

Wow, that sub has really gone downhill recently.
Does the last 24 hours sway your opinion on BTC at all or still just noise? Good call on [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ETHInsider/comments/87h6xd/biweekly_rethinsider_discussion_march_27_2018/dwdigx5/) by the way...
That guy looks like bipolar. Is there anyway to follow you?
Of course the bear market is not over. In the last month alone 1.5 billion have been basically banned from buying bitcoin (at least with a bank transfer). We have an ungodly number of bitcoins that will eventually be sold that the ICOs collected and from the MtGox settlement.

And, the marketing arm of crypto (ICOs marketing crypto in order to generate returns) has been killed as facebook, twitter, google are all banning crypto ads. Not to mention the general regulatory crackdown on ICOs.

Google trends is down, big. And, it continues to decline (july lows now). Transactions on chain decline (two year lows). No, this bear market is not over yet.

You can't focus on price jitters especially in a manipulated market. The big picture is what sets the trend and the big picture is still very bearish

What would you consider a breakout? Closing 12h above or a high volume pump?
Damnit, this market sometimes. I had a long from 8182 and closed it at 8164 because I thought we were gonna break down from the rising wedge fast, but instead we bounced and I opened another long. 



I have never been this indecisive.
Dumps are becoming very weak
since a couple of days I am waiting for a bigger drop but it's not happening.  

A lot of coins are in the green and I think we are due for a 10% drop at least.  
Might happen after the next green dildo.  
That's what the whales expects us to think. 
Double digit leverage hopefully.
Good luck!
I mean... if you're not already in ETH, then don't buy ETH right now (assuming you are in BTC and not fiat). Altcoin ratios tend to come in mini-cycles, so you're going to to want to buy when the sea of red comes back. Historically, when 95/100 altcoins are green compared to BTC, it's a good time to sell the ratio.
You can buy a lot of alts with Eth too, no?
The ratio is approaching historic lows already. Now is not the time. The ratio will likely reverse during the upcoming crash where alts crash more than BTC and thus the ratio will go back to 42% or so.
At which point does btc start to wonder why it's staying still in an ocean of green? The answer in the next episode.
It's definitely not a done deal. One $300 red candle is all it takes and can come from anywhere.
[deleted]
bulls need to push through 9000 on volume for it to be a done deal.
Had to change my forecast and adapt. Not always easy... Yes I think it's good for some green.
Looks like it. I was expecting more of a drop. But, I'm not sure the last couple days qualify a a cooling off period.

I'd put it ar 65/35 at this point. There's risk of that log channel. I'm only in with 5% of my trading stack at this point.

Cautiously optimistic:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/RFGx5E31/
Lol haven't been here for like a week and the same people are going "idddddkkkkkkk about this guys, still sitting out". Think we'll have to pass 20k before these people switch (for the time being at least)
bractals... 100  down small bart. 500 down medium bart... 1000 down geant bart
Assuming you mean short, yes? 
Are you meaning short? I’m with you if that’s the case
My sentiment with shorting the market right now is you are either going to be a little right... Or very wrong. 

If the downtrend does continue, there are likely to be numerous decent shorting opportunities between here and $6,000.

Whereas if there's a trend reversal, there's a strong possibility you'll be caught on the receiving end of another massive green candle. 

From an R/R standpoint, shorting here isn't worth it. 

In my opinion anyhow. 
Very ballsy with all of these alt coins pumping. But hey. Bitmex rekt is always entertaining 
When it goes to $8600 will you add another $1m?
What’s CB?
Target 78XX or letting it ride?
but it's going up brah you should be long
Remember when we all thought eth was following btcs bubble burst just delayed by a month or so? The eth chart now looks like btc dump to $6k and back to $12k. it retraced the entire dump with very little selling on the way back up 

although the retrace could technically go all the way to the original place where it fell out of the symmetrical triangle (which is what btc did) back to ~$900. Would be kinda wild...
Litecoin approaching the ATH log line as well. Things are looking up.
I've never played with alts on mex, but I just shorted XRP 15x @ 10350 when I saw it 400 sats over Binance lol
Quick question: in the volume profile on the right hand side of the chart, why are some sections red/green vs. purple/blue? What's the difference?
I'm sitting on a 25x long from 6410 on Sept futs, but it was small. Only the first 2 of 10 knife-catching orders executed. It was originally a 5x position, but I moved it to 25x after the BGC. Seeing that 600%+ ROE makes me feel better lol. I'm thinking about putting a stop at 8150.

Sounds like you played that position beautifully, though. Congrats.
nice trade, 
Well done.
Definitely going to dip very soon. I think if we can't break 8.4k today, it will drop to sub 8k again.
Yeah all the people buying this top should rather be setting limit buys  from here to 7.8k.  (though it might not come again...)

I might buy more if we dip a bit.  But I have a feeling that most the late comers who have bought above 8.1 are going to sell back at a panic loss rather than lowering their CA with additional buys.
Looks like ETH is done making decisions, im expecting BTC to follow.
Based on BBand compression, I'd be pretty surprised if we were still within the $7,800 to $8,400 range by the end of the day today.
The biq question remains: how tight should i set my stops?
They never overshoot the top

*cough* $20,800 *cough*
Wait, where do you see that? Is price increasing on a Korean exchange?
Well, that could just be half of Bart's head forming...
Search interest still relatively low. This could get interesting.
Lol that’s crypto for you
I think you're in no man's land. 7.9 was a beautiful place to go long. I'm still a bit skeptical here. Maybe after 8.5 or 9. I'd love to discuss some alts options, but that's against the rules of the sub. Best of luck. 
Your gut sounds very intelligent.
In order for there to be a really effective long squeeze, we'd have to break under 7600. We elevatored from 6900-7600, so there's a disproportionate gap in longs in that range. If there's a big squeeze, that's where it'd have to be. 
the suspense is more interesting that any gains
kinda due for one, it went up 30% without a retracement after a week(I think its very important that this whole enchilada started on 4/12 and today is 4/19)
BTC already pumped. More likely the next move will be a dump of all coins with alts dumping more.

Might be good to set a ladder around your target instead of a single sell.
Over 8400 for now. I almost closed on the retrace to 8310, but this pump is crazy. I have to cut losses somewhere, though. 8500 should stop this train, but I'm surprised by the steam behind this.

No shithead bears insulting any positive TA because they have to protect their shorts. 
Well, Bitcoin is back in my news feed. My builder and personal trainer have talked to me about it in the last week. Summer, when people buy things you sometimes need Bitcoin for, is bearing down on us.

I feel like the interest is coming back.
[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8dcw4c/i_believe_were_about_to_enter_the_bull_run_to_end/) fucking post in particular. Jeeebus.
At the top of an ascending wedge just under the 4-month downtrend line? Sounds about right. 
It's far better than it's been a few months back, I remember "Hidden gem"/"Rate my portfolio"/"Recycled meme" posts every single day. *shudders*
> beyond recognition

You mean, back to normal? ;)
ethtrader meme launch sequence has been initiated.
My god, first time I went there just now. What kind of a shithole is that? They are talking about the flippening.. dude wat?
Social currency coiling.
I'd lube yourself up just in case. Bitcoin loves fucking with us
spread those legs ;)
Not that tight!
I watched that too. $99,700.90 each. Weird. EDIT: Fees I guess? Probably 100k buys...
Lets give them a warm welcome by crossing 8300. :)
check the daily, this time we have more sideways and stronger support. looks like a solid bottom building.


it feels exactly the same. I just closed my short, just. like. last. time.
Perhaps we are here: https://www.tradingview.com/x/e1SsRmqe/
On the 4h you can nicely compare them. If you're into drawing lines, the run up to 11800 was a clear rising wedge, but now we're in some kind of undefined figure. Also the RSI was much higher than now. That's all I have to add.
I was thinking the same thing earlier.
not at all
I have exact same entry, stop and leverage. 

Best of luck mate.

Ur gonna be above average today
Can't win 'em all.
It seems a little subdued in the alts as well. Profit taking?
>Like there is strong reactionary buying and selling pressure.

This has been going on for a while imo.
so you are saying to do my own research and actually work?! Are you nuts?!
Good point, but double edged sword because there's also confirmation bias since there's still a lot of luck involved.
9k it is then!
TA slider says BUY still. The r/r on shorting here is rather good given the rapidly-closing ascending wedge. We're close enough to the top that tight stops are possible as well. 
What is with the tuna sandwich thing lately? I missed something...
looks like around 2k BTC traded hands in that 15m  on finex
[deleted]
I'd put that stop under 7800, that's our most prime support for now. 
I'm still sitting out expecting a drop below 8k.  There seems to be way too much confidence in an imminent bull run. People quickly forget that we've just recently had a gigantic leg up and haven't retraced at all.
I'm with you. I'm 75% bitcoin at the moment with a SL at 8000. The chart is insanely bullish atm, alts are taking off, sentiment is high, and no FUD news to be seen. 

Buying pressure looks good with 8240 apparently the new support. Is this the beginning of the next FOMO run, or unsustainable growth propped up by the renewed interest in alts? Time will tell, but there's no way I'm going to try to trade this until it does.
I'm kinda sitting things out, still holding half of my long from $6500. But I wouldn't buy in this price range until the market decides if its going up or down 
Weren't you planning to add at 8.3. Did you close your short? 
8280 on Binance got rejected like little Timmy at highschool prom 

Edit: Timmy got it in. 
so did I, After selling ay 8265 too.
Short 2% of stack 50x 8280. Ride to liquidation if necessary. Haha

edit to add: this was satirical. I'm not actually doing this.
Only 50 coins got bought and there were 22 orders comprising that price point. No one even knows which of the 50 coins were bought.
Sentiment is the metric here, not activity. 
No, though there is strong evidence of activity decrease:

1. Google trends for bitcoin is down to July lows which is really surprising since that includes searches for Bitcoin Cash/Gold/Diamond, etc. 

2. Exchange traffic is rapidly declining according to Alexa. 

3. This decline in traders is evidenced by Bitfinex lowering capitalization requirements from $10k to $1k.

4. On-chain transactions are at 2 year lows.
It doesn't matter, when fomo kicks in, fomo kicks in. Don't be stubborn, plenty of money to make on the way up.
There is also the possibility that the activity didn't increase but bitcoin @ 6000-8000 was undervalued for the current activity. so you are seeing a markup.
Why do you care or need activity increase? 
0-100% chance.
100%
Slim to none. Probably won't break it until late 2020 or early 2021.
This is the absolutely obvious play with low risk and high reward. Which is the only scary thing about it.

The fact I'm seeing people FOMO in as 8300 approaches gives hope though. 
Same, but with tighter stops. Let's hope it's not a 3% stop hunt before the drop :) 
You rang?

Wait for an actual break of 8.3, this thing could reverse in a hurry if we don't crack it soon imo
On my chart ETH is about $18 away from it's ATH trendline.

Edit: ETH https://www.tradingview.com/x/TfEvT7yb/
Its overbought on most of the charts... I would buy back on a retracement

You didn't miss much. Same people buying and selling.
I was just about to point that out.
That's actually a trend line that goes right back to december ATH, it hits the top of the pre bull trap, bull trap on the 03/03.

You never know if there are bots out there buying and selling based on which side of the order book looks weaker.
The vast majority of trade volume is done by bots, not people behind keyboards. Spoofing that bid wall probably has some efficacy in encouraging bots to buy into the seller's likely limit asks.
We're testing it, bang bang
> What if being stuck in this range like this with shorters and longers both terrified to make a move is just the new reality?

Then it stays there until the reality breaks, which will happen sooner or later. Remember, supply is limited, SERIOUS money not invested and the miners wont create the same amount of coins forever.

Seems like the just bitmexed a bit. 
More likely sell some alts for BTC before they plummet. But either way is a net win comparatively. 
I think that alts are more likely to run with BTC rather than drop. They aren’t necessarily mutually exclusive 
Honestly alts have been doing their own thing recently despite BTC’s value. 

The first 6k dip alts absolutely got slaughtered.

Second 6k Dip alts just rode past BTC on a bike 
Correct me if I'm wrong, but if BTC tanks, don't the alts' strength vs bitcoin jump up for a bit? Would it then be a perfect time to dump alts and accumulate BTC? It's just something I've been pondering this morning as I try to come up with a strategy in case we have a break.
btc from 2014 bought at 650, underwater for 2 years.

> What’s the LONGEST you have ever held an underwater position?

2 years. LTC. 

Worth it. 
I bought several alts over the summer that ended up tanking and held them until the last alt season in december.  

I have friends who bought btc at 18k and are still holding.  they will never sell it at a loss.
3 days. Lost 1.5 BTC. Never. AGAIN.

Shorted at 7k (after shorting at 5912) and exited at 8.2k in Feb. I felt soooo god damn stupid. Made it all back tho
5 weeks, EOS long I averaged down from 10 to 6. Then exited at 26% gain last week :D
2014.
I’ve been underwater for about 12 weeks, after buying at 17k
Everyone donate 0.05% of their gains to the underwater guy!
3 weeks and i made so much BTC from funding and now im way green
2.5 Months (an alt). As I'm buying every month more coins with USD I slowly build up my position until I closed it at break heaven last week. Was fun...
6 years in stocks. was an insurance company and so far underwater... bought around 2006, crashed and Never returned in 2008
Not exactly your typical leverage long, but ever since February i have been adding bitshares collateral to protect my BitCNY (a derivate of CNY backed by at least 175% of its value on bitshares guaranteed to have a value at least equal to CNY [unless the economy crashes]) debt from being margin called.


https://wallet.bitshares.org/#/asset/CNY

Fortunately there are no fees on those, and im in very hard profits right now. 

Almost 700% on that one, but out of pure fucking luck because i went yolo calling the bottom and for once in my life i ended up being right. 
During the 2 year bear market, I held on to the coins I purchased at $600-$800 the entire time down to $200-$300

So, 2 years.
I'm still holding one BCH I bought for .2 BTC. I think I'll just hold the bag or sell if it ever comes to break even.
It's been a bunch lately, bearish.
In the relatively unlikely event that the market does break through, it'll be interesting to see if it keeps on pumping or if we instead see it play out like it did in 2014:

https://imgur.com/a/zFUxj

After the log resistance line was broken to the upside, downward movement continued for several months as the market hovered just above the line.
It means consolidation. 
Bitcoin bulled first. Just because it bulled half as much does not mean it bulled. It started the mini bull with a large BGD and will end it with a BRD.
H&S is way more reliable at this time frame and market didn't give a poot :'(
So is everyone else so let's hope it happens. I got up early especially!
I noticed whenever BTC hits resistance and goes sideways, alts are used as springboard to pierce through. Of course this only happens when market geniunly wants to go up. Easier to pump alts ratios (smaller mc, communities hype, already bottoming, etc)
no one is buying Spoofy's wall... this trick is getting old.
A little over the top no?
where?
After 200 have been bought it will be pulled. It always is.
Aaand it's gone... 
I thought the depth chart on cryptowatch was glitching on me again.
https://imgur.com/a/xNMaD1X someone really want the price to stay 
he's been spoofing that for the last hour at least
Did he say which way? The mob wants to know.
I set alarms every 2 hours to check the price.

Am I doing this right?
He referred to altcoins though.
When we reached the double top on 11,5, alts mostly recovered 100% ~ from the 6k dip. At this moment only some of the alts are recovering that fast (at least the ones I want for my long-term stack). And I bet no one sane is expecting bull run now, we are still in the log downtrend, let's first break that resistance and reach new daily higher high above 9k. Then we can talk about the new bull run.


If we are truly in the long-term bear market, with every drop and rise alts will act differently so comparing the price of the alts now and 45 days ago makes no sense to me, just an interesting fact.
You just described the difference.

Another detail is that ALTs didn't get hit so bad by Feb 6th visit to 6k, and that they really hurt at our recent visit to 6k.  So the fact that alts are pumping now may be a balancing act with that.  I think most alts are still below their february level, where as bitcoin is currently above that.
yeah i agree with you on this one. feels overbought short term. Longterm however we are sitting at 8k from an ATH of 20k so it is still a solid buy considering the bullish momentum its getting recently. It is a tough decision at the moment. 
Yes, but they are pulling back. Neo hit $75 overnight and dipped to sub $71. Climbing again but it's been the same across most coins.
Next time plan in advance, have a solid entry point, stick to it and you wouldn't be sitting on the sidelines.
For anybody wondering what BGC is, it's really quite simple.  While a Big Green Dildo™ is a fake pump meant to inspire fomo, a Big Green Cock is certified organic, rock solid, and primed for more action.

Let's get it boys.
A friendly reminder you're already aware of:

My friend, margin is a tool to be leveraged only in select circumstances when your confidence in the trade is high enough to warrant the multiplicative risk. 

Cryptocurrency is rewarding enough where even conservative trades yield higher than average returns. When the uncertainty nears local highs, I take my finger off the button and start taking notes.

> How realistic is it that this might dump 10% over the next 48 hours?

I would say about 30% likely.   And 60% likely it will drop 5% over the next 48 hours.

People are WAY overconfident here.  I don't get how they have any money left if they trade.  

80% probable
Yea i bought and it actually didn’t fall immediately. If thats not bullish I don’t know what is.
same direction for bouncing off it and then back to doom
> I am now thinking something is wrong if there is no big drop. 

If there is no big drop, then there’s not something wrong with the market, just means you (and many others) were wrong in your thinking/analysis... 


Not saying you *are* wrong, as anything can still happen. Just saying don’t blame the market when it goes against your TA. 
Battered bull syndrome. 
This is what the markets will do to people over time. Back in early 2016, the U.S. equity market was down something like 18% from late December through mid February. The only reason retail investors weren't running for the doors is because most of them lived through the financial meltdown in 2007/2008/2009.

Similar to what you say, at the moment I have a SL TP on a 7.9k long set at 8k (already took plenty of profits on this one.) And build a new long laddered from 7.9 to 7.7, with heavier gravity lower.  Then SL on that half and half at 7.65 and 7.55.

Not sure if I will stick to that plan at all. In any case I'm likely to adjust this if we go down in any way other than a BRD.

Edit: for potential upswing I'm covered with profit taking ladder up into 9k's on that long.
I saw the same but then I chalked it up to hopium.
So it still has a chance to get rejected at the top? 

           Give me hope. 
People don't really fomo/panic sell right now because they expect it to be a fakeout. We are going to need a big whale to push us into a new direction
Alt's didn't recover on this mini bounce either. (mostly).

It has normally been the other way around; new money first seeking safety/defaultness of BTC, then BTC rallies, people feel comfortable enough putting it in higher risk/volitality alts.

that is not what happened last time but who knows this time it may go backwards.
I don't really get this point of view. Why would alt/btc price affect the btc/usd price?  It's not like people are putting their alt profit in USD before going back to BTC. 
I doubt it. This was a whale driven pump. It was not FOMO driven and it did not attract new entrants based on all external data. Thus, it is likely that both just crash. Of course alts will crash more. They went up more due to less liquidity. They will go down more for the same reason.
Not much action on shorts, longs are gradually closing but nothing substantial. 
lower timeframes have some room to compress (15m - 2h), whereas the 4h and 6h are the tightest they've been since the drop from $9,200. 

I'd expect a fairly significant move at some point today or tomorrow. Either up and over the log resistance line at ~$8,600 or down below $7,800.

Hi, Kraken support here. Please feel free to contact us at our support channel, by opening a ticket at: support.kraken.com 
i think everyone probably has tight stops now, which will lead to the bart pattern to be finalized. 

$7800 is the line in the sand here. If that goes, we'll probably have a 15% down day
GOGOGOGOGO!!!
Tbh that red dildo made me try and fomo-short it but thanks to bitmex's laggy engine i wasnt able to. Saved me from some losses there.
Bear, not particularly. Don't think this will have strength to get past the long term log resistance
Bear(ish). Last 24 hours? Not particularly. Tightened stops on my long, though. 
I closed my long on profit. Not due to insightful TA, merely getting scared by these market movements, including the recent violent spike in both directions. If the RSI were much lower, I might have been inclined to take more risk to keep the long open.
I’m pretty bullish mid to long term but just tethered into everything after reaching my goal of making 2 btc trading alts since I think we go down a bit below $7800 resistance just because I feel like we need to sustain this little run. There’s nothing organic about recent pumps and dumps and I’m ok with that but I don’t see enough fomo to sustain unless we re watching the beginning of alts decoupling from btc and in that case alts alone could keep btc propped up. 
Yes. BTC bears know this is the last stand and the rest of the market has shown it doesn't care. 
Bitcoin? Stability?
Most of us are here because of it's volatility
Alts are probably more like the penny stocks and Bitcoin is probably more like Nasdaq... but on a MUCH smaller scale and way more volatile and unstable.

Comparisons to traditional instruments break down quickly.
No, I think that's a ridiculous comparison. Bonds don't lose 70% of their value in months. 
You're comparing apples to oranges. Bitcoin is a riskier investment than 99% of equities. I don't think you want to equate it to bonds. However, if you are drawing a comparison you could say on a relative basis, BTC is less volatile than many of the alt coins, which means it should have a heavier weighting in the portfolio (assuming the investor leans balanced/conservative).
it has behaved like that since december. No guarantee it will keep doing it.


Yes, LocalBitcoins is at ATH transactions, too.

https://anacoinda.github.io/localbitcoins/all.html

I think this means that every coin that's released into the market by miners is being rapidly bought up.
Do you mean transactions on-chain? No, that has not really gone up. It is still at 2 year lows and well within the range randomness still: https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactions.html#3m

It is also a metric that is fairly easy to manipulate (refer to the bitcoin cash pumps that would spam bitcoin prior to the cash pumps). 
Removed for rule 2 violation. first offense. No biggie. Please adjust.
If you look at the wicks generally the down wicks are done on pretty low volume and the up-wicks are down on higher volume. To me this indicates that buyiing demand is quite low and a big sell will dump this very easily.


You should generally trust horizontal lines over diagonal ones, and a rising wedge low volume fakeout upwards is pretty common. 
The 3 day MACD  and 1D MACD are pushing upward. We've had higher lows. Bigger time frames carry more weight than smaller patterns and they are indicating up. We're going to at least test the down trend line from the ATH soon. My opinion of the longer time frames is it will beak upward slowly and we'll get a denial rally. 
That should tell you that TA is not in control right now, so why are you trying to use it to try to decode what is going to happen?
TA is mostly a pile of doo-doo.
It could all fall down still. We haven't passed the 50SMA or ATH log trend yet. Be prepared if it does.
No, everyone *feels* like a hammer is about to drop after a whale decides to complete Epic Bart.

The two most-viewed TradingView trolls are preaching the same thing--one more leg down before going up.

Sorry, but it's too obvious. I don't believe that the people copy/pasting trades from WonkaShitTrebuchet are going to make money that easy. 

Time will tell. For now, we're going up.
Sorry but it's different, the rise to 11.7 was slow, half-assed, uncomfortable, and alts weren't pumping. There's a possibility it will be the same all over again, but I don't find it that comparable anymore.

Edit: there's some serious weakness in alts rn so let's see
Check out google trends for bitcoin keyword (which encompasses bitcoin, bitcoin cash, bitcoin gold, etc). You will see it is sinking to July levels despite representing 5 different coins now.

There is no FOMO. 
My crystal ball says 4am~10am UTC on the 21st.  (where log downtrend intersects november/february log support)
.....tickers?
I'd love one of these as well.

Just like this-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN2RRBSAsn8
mean reversion
Not speaking for BTC, but for right now the wack a mole of pumping alts seemed to have cooled off for a minute. For the last 2 weeks all I did was buy any alts on my favorite list on Binance that hasn't pumped yet and then sell a few days later. My intentions were to build a solid long term portfolio beyond 2018 but these market conditions are unsettling. Nothing about this feels right until we go back and give a bit back of the BGD. 
Looking at the same thing. hoping to break through the log trend and invalidate the bear TA here.

I generally avoid reading posts from technical analysts who use TA tools to project or predict future price action. 

It's one thing to anticipate how price will continue to move after a particular price level support/resistance is broken, and quite another to plot on a chart price movements weeks or months down the road. I find that it's often the elliot wave hobbyists who tend to do the latter for some reason or another.

Simple TA is the best (i.e. concepts of support and resistance and technical formations/patterns that can shed some light into market psychology). You are likely to find that you are a lot better off practicing and perfecting your application of such TA, and avoiding price predictions posts which can potentially cloud your analysis by producing the basic emotions of fear or hope.
Not really.... the lines up to mid march is very predictable as thats how all corrections from ATH look like
as long as it's not a bunch of posts talking about goblin town or other bullshit i'd welcome it. 
...and that you said it so freely indicates there is more bullish action to come.   (note:  you haven't been down-voted by -47 slaps already for questioning the bull run).  Good indication that people are still fearful of this climb.
Better add more into your shorts now.
The reverse happens when the market is declining.

There's not as much to say for your side when it's moving against you in the short term.  Long term, of course, is a different beast.
Seems a bit premature. I would wait for eth to stop pumping.
Took some profit at 8350. Limit order in for 8450 if we make it. The RSI is getting hot on the lower timeframes. Should be a good opportunity to accumulate a small bit when the hammer drops.
my luck
Me too, added at $8330 on bfx. Avg of $8365 now
1/5 position size of my old short.

this sub is one of the only places you can find people who are realistic about bitcoin. Everywhere else it's either moon or doom

This is a Technical Analysis and Margin Trading zone. The goal of most of the posters here is to get ahead of the market's next move, so considering how bullish Bitcoin has been the past week, we are anticipating a correction at any moment. 

Bitcoin being Bitcoin, TA is often a 50/50 proposition, but it's better than blind guessing.
The majority of the very vocal posters in here were short sub $7k.
"bull run"

yeah okay
Was plenty bullish in here 24~48 hours ago.  Maybe you could offer some bullish analysis if you feel it's imbalanced, or share your bullish trades.
The thing is we haven't even gone up THAT much in comparison to last year. You guys don't sound like you're partying, you sound desperate.
But to me, from a non-TA look at things, I see these attempted moves to lower the price get met with a lot of buying power.  That seems pretty bullish (or bullish manipulation...but why trade against the trend) to me.
While I agree with the analysis....

* Triple tops are rare. Third time is a breakout, they say ;)
* Even if, that would just be more chance to buy. 7500 as interim new low would actually establish that the downtrend has ended and it is building a solid foundation ;)

Yeah, paydays ;)
I wouldn't close it quite yet. We're still inside the ascending wedge, despite the fakeout. 
I don't know about that, it's been about 4+ days since the local high of 8.4k and bulls haven't been all that motivated to drive the price up either. 

They've only shown that they are happy to buy in the 7.9k-8.2k range then wait for someone else to move it up. 

But how long until the ones that bought in the 6k range become impatient and start taking profits?

I actually think the more time passes without a new high is worse for bulls than bears because it's killing momentum and draining confidence
[deleted]
Probably some exchanges hunting longs.
It does seem risky to me to try to short this when a group of people are determined to keep pushing the price up.  But it seems bearish to me that BTC is primarily going up these last few days only due to whales causing big spikes.
Chads gonna chad
You should know by now cryptomarket has nothing to do with fundamentals in any shape or form.
I am not an expert. However, was that manipulation just a combo of large market buys, triggering known overlevergered short liquidations, along with traders eyeing that very specific outcome, which the market maker knew would occur? I think this happens in equities also? 
I suspect most of these sudden market movements is actually caused by bots.  And the BGD was caused by a giant short squeeze, which I guess is like being caused by bots in a way.
I think it's odd too. I was bored earlier and playing around with charts and thinking about this and it's led me to an amusing conspiracy theory:

If that BGD hadn't happened we were going to break a major trendline going all the way back to 2013. The last time we broke it was at the beginning phase of the 2014 bear market. Here's an image/chart: https://imgur.com/a/vbitLpc

I think the BGD was/is an attempt to prop up the market, incite a new bull run and avoid a prolonged downtrend. The subsequent suppression over the last few days has been orchestrated to give alts a chance to run thus adding to FOMO and positive sentiment (I guess in the hope that this will then help BTC stay above ~$8K and slowly go up).

Unfortunately, I don't think it is going to work (might get us up to $9K but not a lot further). Why? There's no new meaningful amounts of money coming in, BTC and all the other majors currently still suffer from a severe paucity of real world use cases (beyond financial speculation), regulatory uncertainty persists and most of the volume on exchanges is fake i.e. very limited liquidity (nice tweet here illustrating this: https://twitter.com/ChartGuys/status/986742180659286016 ).

So basically nothing has changed in terms of fundamental reasons behind the bear market and it's unlikely to for at least the rest of this year (different story in 2019 and 2020 I think).

This obviously is problematic for the big boys heavily invested in mining and running exchanges (look at Kraken's hysteric response to the New York attorney's letter a few days ago - I suppose they're paranoid about having their dirty laundry uncovered). So what do they do? Fake it until they make it lol. Keep the bots wash trading on the exchanges and throw in a BGD here and there to try and keep the market interested (hard to run a functioning exchange if literally _everyone_ is short) until fundamentals change and another organic bull run emerges.

I know that's what I'd do if I were in their shoes and faced the same dilemma. No (current) regulations to stop me ha!

Edit 1: remember Vitalik's tweet: "have we earned it?" In my opinion not yet. Ergo: nothing has changed in the market (other than the BGD that sparked this mini turn around).

Edit 2: a good bell weather as to when crypto has _really_ matured to the next level is when something like NEO no longer exists: https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/970294228122263552?s=21
if market makers kept the price sub 7k they would have ended up with no BTC to trade with. All the BTC would have gone to hodlers' cold storage.
imagine what another one would do to the market right now...

No, not really. We're in a low volume part of a huge pattern. Any large buys or sells that work with the ongoing pattern will be followed. If this had broken the trendline that would have been weird.
I agree with you, think of the bgd as a paradigm shift. It's size completely reset the chart temporarily, which will have it's aftershocks, after which we'll need real fundamental change to turn the ship around
Have you looked into using 30, 60 and 365 day MAs? I would assume that might fit better since cryptocurrencies are trading 24/7/365, unlike trading on stock market.
The market needs to avoid collapsing in on itself first. 

Something it has been entirely incapable of doing since $20k.
I imagine I'd be looking to enter short around 8350-8450, and alarm/stop over the resistance line. Haven't examined charts closely this morning though. 
> rising wedge 

 vs

> an upward breakout is inevitable

Seems Barting became the norm.
Preferably hatch one of those BGD, water it, watch it grow upwards towards the sky, possibly the moon
I wouldn't put a stop loss that high since a single whale sell will probably trigger your stop loss without compromising the bullish pattern and you'll miss the retracement.
I'll only sell if the current uptrend support line gets invalidated. Currently around $7900
I pay attention to the wicks of all retraces/support when I choose my SLs and try to set them slightly below support. In my case I'm now moving mine up to 8028. Speaking only for myself, I would not pick an SL of 8050; I'd wait until it climbed some more and then put it at about 8088.

Having said that, this doesn't always work and I have been burned badly, including just a few days ago when I got stopped out of XMR. I am kicking myself over that one.
I hope you are aware of the 1h candle a few hours ago that moved like 2-3% in each direction to rekt people like you :P
I've seen a number of people consider this in the last couple days. I don't recommend it, but it has some appeal. It makes at least some sense if you can separate your entries by the range. Long 8150 short 8250, etc. Stops would need to be deep (7750 and 8550 for instance) in order to not get chopped up. You're essentially surrendering profits from the "correct" entry until you close the other one. It has appeal mostly due to the cluster that is the MEX engine, and feeling like you want to take a position and not being able to. Trading into a breakout is basically impossible on there now. 
That's actually a legit strategy in options trading. It's called a straddle..Buy a put and a call at the same strike price. You do that on the expectation of high volatility..One of the 2 will be in the money, enough to cover the cost of both options, as well as a profit..
Watching the same thing but my resistance line is closer to the apex. Honestly I think just above the log line would be the prime place for whales to get short orders filled when the fomo comes in, and then dump out of the wedge. Similar to when we popped over it previously. 


Don't think so. If we follow that pattern and we break resist the fomo will cause that wedge to break up.On the other hand, a channel is equally possible, and i think that bitcoin has used more channels than wedges lately.
Were you around when alts in the Top 100 saw XXX% gains in a single day?

Was that more or less rational than BAT going up 35% after announcing a DOW Jones partnership?
Even if it goes up from here, don't regret closing in profit and having mitigated risk.

Btw I don't think it can still be called a Bart if it is visible on the 1D.  You mean the potential Marge?
I learned the hrd way that shortig shitcoins is a gamble.

ETH could theoretically decouple and moon while we dump.

If you short, I would hold off on leverage. If you think trading futs on lev is hard, trade altcoin futs on lev in an illiquid market
What makes you day it'll reverse? 
Why the downvotes? Posted this when we were at 8110, and now we're back to 8160 ?
Anywhere i can long with as little as 1k?
Not watching it right now, but he talked about BCH two days ago and that worked out well for them.

If it keeps knocking on the door eventually somebody is going to answer
Did you miss you're 6k entry you talked about?
He posted three days ago that he shorted 8425 (and specifically not lower)

Also I remember him saying he holds more BCH, so he's probably doing a-ok right now.
Stop market buys to enter a position are always a terrible idea.  Buy high sell low amiright?  If you think it'll hit or go higher, buy now, or set limits to catch dips.

Edit: QED: https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8d2u4j/daily_discussion_wednesday_april_18_2018/dxltzyo/

Not sure if he got stopped out or not, as his followups were posted right around when we dropped to 8100.  Point is that anyway, he could have just put limit buys where his SL was, and then *now* he would be sitting in comfort.

8.35 is right below a potential resistance line (through 6k, shown in red). So if you plan to get in below that line, you might also consider doing it before it hits 8.35, instead of waiting until then. (personal bias disclaimer: I am long here)

Btw, further above, the log-downtrend is at ˜8.65 right now.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/JsH2RdrF/


Has tether had much volume over the last day or two?   
basically the alts bled much harder than BTC, which in turn means that when BTC pumped, it eliminated the resistance so all the alts broke out and started pumping because the order books were pretty thin 
could be consolidated money from btc going into alts because the losses from the recent downturn made people go riskier to gain back losses.  Alts have a higher return, so the money is going into alts right now. Max pain now would be to take btc lower and alts go even lower.
See [my post from a week ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8beaek/daily_discussion_wednesday_april_11_2018/dx7kmsd/). I'm more of the mind that the BTC price is being suppressed by short interest and derivatives speculating, thus reducing demand for the actual coin.
It is new naive money looking for quick gains.
Nothing just happened....it moved 0.5% and then back. I would expect those are mostly unchanged.
Thought that might be the squeeze before the break but it just kind of equalized out.
Yea, haven't seen wicks like that since hours ago! 
BFX or Kraken
It means that wedge is accurate
I hope this isn't another Icarus moment. We've got some serious resistance ahead.
If you want to catch the next potential Bart, set an alert on volume for 150-200 on the 1m candle.
Bear market trend is not broken. 2-month forecast (june) sentiment is not bullish (or it would be a premium). 5-month forecast is more bullish than 2-month, but still bearish. 

If we break up hard out of the downtrend, expect those both to flip premium quickly. 
I'd say there are a lot more FOMO bulls now. But they are skittish, so even a little reversal will send them market selling and dumping the price hard

It is really a balance of probabilities. The market is fairly pushed up already. There has not been a lot of FOMO, which means that the whales who are pushing the market are likely already bought-in (they have effectively FOMOed themselves).

So, given that, it is likely we will experience some retracement and continue in the downward channel.
[deleted]
> Why aren't you guys afraid of the short squeeze/ stop loss hunting in this highly manipulated market 

Because I'm not afraid of a 1% loss when I"m going for 5% or much more gain.
You can't use a 4 month wave on bitcoin man. 

Besides, you can use them to support whatever narrative you want. For example, the most logical starting point to chart EW is when there is a strong reversal of a trend, a clear top and bottom. 



So you can say 20K was 1,then 12 was 2, then 16.6 3 , then 12,6 4, then wave 5 all the way to 6k

So you can  say 6k bounce was wave A, then 9.4 B, then 11.6 K wave C, then to 6.5 D, which would put us in wave E.

It even has credibility because it behaves in a very similar way but inverted.
I don't actually put any predictive power to that, but if people start to, then the target would be massive.
$2000 is unlikely from a purely technical perspective.  But bad news can certainly pound it down that low and much lower.  And virtually guaranteed there will be more gov't a$$f*cking of crypto users this year and beyond.
So you think down?
If you want to commit to exiting, then after first reducing the position here a little, do a laddered exit with limits on the rest between here and 7800, perhaps with most of the gravity near 8k.

You'll hate me if that works flawlessly though and it goes to 7800 and you mostly break even and miss some profits.  If it goes to 8400 you'll be glad you closed some, but still hate me for for the rest of the percentage.  You'll probably still hate me if it goes down to 7900 and bounces back with some of the position remaining.  You'll really hate me if it goes sub 7.8k.

> I missed the dip to the low 7.9k

Anyway, you don't miss dips/pumps if you do ladders.  I never put all of a trade on one spot.  Always ease in and ease out.
If it makes you feel better... 

I accidentally closed my short from 7930 for a fat loss last night. Yes I was angry.


BUT, it sure feels fucking good to disconnect from that short. One stressful short to hold considering this thing could rocket in 2 minutes and you won’t have time to react 
I would wait and see how far we drop when we get out of this rising wedge. Lot of resistance between 8.2 and 8.4. Consider closing it on the low when we fall out of this wedge.
Price could easily plummet $1000 when price gets rejected at that retarded line, so why close it now.
You're saying, it should be illegel to place 12m bid? why?
That’s like saying 

“ It should be under 8000 by now “ 

Works the same for the bears 
What I think is that it is gonna go up, but at a very low speed, the kind we have been experiencing in the past 24 hours.
I've been dreaming about what the market will look like when we break out of the ATH descending log trend line since early March. 

Somehow, I don't think it will include a Bart caused by a heavy hitter manipulating bots, but I'm open to it if it's possible.
I don't think it's irrelevant. In fact, I'd argue it goes towards sentiment analysis. One of the reasons to feel bullish. Granted one big fucking red dildo and that sentiment can change, but right now I think it speaks volumes. Personally I think sentiment and fundamentals are bullish. Technical on the other hand the bear is still in the room, but that bull could be in sight. 
because 1% movements is just chop so the alts are free to do their pumps

if BTC goes down for real, the pumps will crash even harder. the same lack of liqudity that adds up to bigger pumps vs BTC, also add up to bigger dumps vs BTC
you could... just look at their BTC ratios
I've found [This](https://onchainfx.com/) site to be useful. You can tailor the list to include BTC ratio along with 7, 30, and 90 day change. 
I think the real fomo for pleb investors like me was the ridiculous alt run. Still beating BTC but looks like it's cooling off for a minute
Really dont mean anything by this, but why would you add onto your short now? Interested to know your logic here.
looks to be, just retraced that last pump in a single 5 min candle
 
under $8000 would be confirmation

under $7800 pretty much a sure thing 
Wrong move bro. 
It's not High Frequency if you have to wait for it
No it’s not clueless people, just gamblers.
If shorts keep rising then a squeeze is the play for a whale. This is no man's land. If you have a long opened closing it is prob a decent idea, but I wouldn't open a short either. Sidelines for me. 
where are you seeing that?

* there were 33,000 longs and 37,500 shorts on 4/11
* there were 27,500 longs and 26,500 shorts on 4/12
* there are 29,500 longs and 23,500 shorts today


That's what I'm thinking. looks like a double top right?
why is this downvoted lol 
is a 150 BTC sell wall supposed to be impressive?
Nah, scalpers will short the shit out of this back to 8160.
Uhhhh nope
If we sideways for some hours between, for example, 8160-8220, most of the times the 150$ pump will come when we are in the 8160 range. We haven't had a slow,natural pump since i am watching trading charts.
[removed]
wrong

its not the bears defending a line, it's the bulls 

the trend line is still down, the bears can just wait things out and the trendline will simply resume itself

the bulls on the other hand MUST win the reversal...so they are the ones fighting for their life  
Seems a little spoofy. Trying to draw bots in to the selloff. 
That's a pretty low ATH trendline. Mine is still up around 8.6k.

And I mean it's obviously not just a line in the sand, but I wouldn't say we're testing it until we get to around 8.5 (ish). I think a 8425 SL is a bit too low if you're trying to catch a break up of it.
I think I've written that I think it will go over 70%.  I stand by that.  XRP is over .80, lol.  The bubble will burst.
Think longer term and it will become clear
I again stopped reading  as soon you said the word "guaranteed".
oh sweet summer child. 

Back in the $200 to $300 range the market would often be stuck in a range far tighter than $7,800 to $8,200 for several weeks on end. And even after the breakout above $300, long periods of consolidation were quite normal. There was about a month where the market was rangebound between $400 and $420. 
[Bitcoin's 30 day volatility index is at over 4.5%](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/volatility-index/). I've personally seen the volatility drop as low as 0.7%, bitcoin's not the most stable it's ever been. 
It has been this stable before, many a time. Give it an hour or two :)
Is there a new payment per post/comment token I am unaware of? 
How can you tell that?
Shitcoins are more illiquid so they move harder = easier to make money
My shitcoin portfolio is up 66% from last month, that's why..
The LN isn’t working, doesn’t even work in theory. They genuinely don’t have any idea of how they can achieve decentralised routing.

Now imagine there is a version of bitcoin that wasn’t subjected to the artificial capacity limit, that stuck to the original design and retained and further built upon the effortless utility that bitcoin enjoyed pre-blockstream.

BTC seems to think it can survive on network effect but overlooks the reality that the network hadn’t actually been built yet... the price was always speculation upon the vale of the network that would EVENTUALLY exist.

That’s the network the competing version of bitcoin is building, the network that is no longer possible on a hamstrung BTC chain.
altcoin hunter dont give Two fucks about use Case, they want to Ride the Next bitcoin to the Moon. they see something rising they fomo.
nah not yet, gonna be a few more hours
The story of 19th April 2018
I.e. The only way to make money on exchange where your trading pair is a crypto currency (BTC) - is the use leverage (in a bear market where you would mostly short). Bull market - different story obviously.
[removed]
Doesn’t mean anything imo. Probably a bit of profit taking after pumps that’s all.
This is a pretty common occurrence.  People move in and out of the pairs.  The major alts fiat ratios will climb, and then you migrate into BTC for a while.  Then it cycles back again.

Picking your points is what its all about.  If you could do that successfully, you would be typing from a beach in Fiji.
I think the general consensus is that there is going to be a major move up or down soon, either case alt ratio goes down.

Personally speaking I have a feeling BTC is going down in the short term and also wanted to secure the nice profit I made in alts the past couple of weeks. I don't have enough faith in the market to let my profits ride (I have been jumping around alts) only to lose it all and not have enough to pay taxes.
This looks more like a sell into Fiat situation. BTC is is about to correct heavily imo. 
It is called "pump and dump" because that is the order of the events. First the pump. Then the dump. We are entering the danger zone where the "dump" begins.

Don't read into anymore than that, but if you are holding some coin then better trade out.

ETH ratio on gdax has gone from .064 to .067 today. Seems like a little pullback would be justified..wouldn't read too much into it regarding BTC prices 
I suggest you invest on salt minning stocks then. 
I'm sorry you're frustrated, but this is not a high quality post. Tell us where the bad market touched you.
I stopped reading as soon you said the word "guaranteed". 
Thank you. That means a lot. My hope is even if the price targets/dates aren't exact, this kind of analysis provides a rough forecast for where the market is heading on a short term basis. That being said, the giant price run on 04/12/18 ($6,828 -> $7,769 on 4H) is something like an 11th standard deviation move. A true black swan event. No TA could have accurately predicted that. But, good TA can help inform investors of trends, trend reversals and when breakouts are more likely to occur (so they are able to take profits and/or adjust their portfolios accordingly).
Yes! Great catch. Absolutely meant May 8.
For the record, I upvoted you because I don't entirely disagree and I think discussion about these things is exactly why we are all here. If we breach the brief support created in early April, there is a good chance it doesn't take two full weeks to go from $7,500 -> $6,900. The fall could happen much faster.

If the Uber Bear Case does end up happening but we bounce off the log support from 2017 (the dark blue line), then it's very possible we stay within that channel until late May. 

If we drop below the log support from 2017, then all bets are off. I don't know where the new log support would be, but on Jan 1, 2017, BTC traded for $963. The bottom could be far away.
Some Banks banned crypto purchases there, right?
Banks here have been hammering hard on buying crypto the past months. They have been blocking credit and debit purchases to any exchanges.  
Yep KYC is fucking them up.

all their traffic is going to paxful.com now instead 
Sorry, has someone made this point earlier today in here? Wasn't online today, caught up in meetings... Didn't want to steal anyone's earlier observation, though. Sorry if I did.
Don't talk shit about Dush! 😡😡😡😡
It's really a toss up at this point, long wicks on green and red candles

Buy order book has thinned up considerably since the first BGD, and longs have really piled up now so it could also go down, I wouldn't call it either way.
I am feeling that way as well. Yes, buyers will get exhausted, but every time a dip is rejected, buyers recharge their batteries.
Bears had the chances to get as much honey as they like, at a discount, two weeks ago.
Now it's time to sleep the whole winter!
Also explains the 1500 BTC wall that gets used on bitfinex to prop up the price. Obviously you would only put up a 1500BTC buy wall if you are selling. I have seen no sell walls.
it would make sense someone propped it up to keep selling their remaining coins before offloading the real markdown 
Does this sub have a wiki?  Because that sort of thing should be some of the first stuff someone understands.  Particularly the first paragraph.

For sure, of course if we breach 20k it's pretty much guaranteed that the public will pour in and create the mother of all bubbles. What I wonder though is can the bulls push it hard enough to get us close enough without some big change in fundamentals.
That sounds logical. And now we can all calculate how long does it take BTC to get that high again without FOMO. 
Except more coins are trading today than at any time. The whole "supply offline" thing does not really hold anymore. You can see this by looking at the bitfinex cold wallet and see people are adding more and more coins to the exchange to trade, screw cold storage! https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/wallet/Bitfinex-coldwallet

Not to mention, many coins that have been "locked" such as the mtgox coins are coming back online to dump. Not to mention mining, increased bannings which reduce potential demand, etc.

Fuck, even the advertisement ban of ICOs at google, twitter, facebook, etc, is huge. The cycle of creating a scam ICO and spending $100 million to make a billion fleecing people brought in a LOT of new money because it created an incentive to advertise huge. That is all disappearing.
That's is just purely wrong. Crypto talk was in every office and supermarket line. People who did not know shit about tech or crypto got involved. I'd be very, very surprised if they did it again after the lesson we all had. 
You're right, my wording was wrong. It wasn't average joes like the plumbers and taxi drivers, but millenials/college kids buying mindlessly with no understanding of the fundamentals.
Except you know, Bitcoin is now banned in several countries. And, the primary mode of reaching new people was ICO funded ad campaigns and with both the crackdown on ICOs and advertising (via twitter, google, facebook all banned) this mode of getting new people to buy crypto is dying down.
May you rest with the utmost peace and kindness in your soul.
Na, I just got his name wrong. Something along the lines of “No better degenerates to HODL with”
US customers permitted without having to use a VPN located in another country, fiat trading, trading of actual coins rather than just contracts, leverage and shorting possible, no real problems between last downtime and this morning.
And switch to Bitmex? I heard it's been working great... Bitfinex requires at least 10.000$ so its not for everyone.
Their platform had been solid since their upgrades and earlier fiasco.

I was luckily able to cancel my open orders just now but they told me if they had filled while they were glitching I was SOL. Pretty lame but what are you gonna do about it right? Not like bitmex is exactly a bastion of stability
>continuing

well I just started trading on kraken, so lesson learned 
Yes that would be the plan, will try not resist the fomo (on long or short) before those levels but it will be hard. But it's hard to make a plan in chop city 
Careful 8.6 at least before adding more imo
I have my .700 Nitro Express with Bear stop hunt modification  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.700_Nitro_Express
I'm on June futures with an entry of around $8,070. 

My stops are around $8,019. 

So I'd take a small loss, but the June futures have dropped down into the mid $8000s a few times in the past 24 hours without breaking lower. So I'd rather not set my stops at breakeven. 
basically FOMO 

he'd rather take a small loss instead of fearing of missing out another leg up
risk vs reward. 

Bitmex's inexcusable server performance has forced me to completely change my trading approach. 

In the past, I could safely wait on the sidelines and trade the breakout in a situation like this. Now I don't have that luxury.

If the market breaks up above $8,650 or so, the June futures could already be trading in the $9,000s by the time I'm able to place a buy order on the books.

If it breaks below $7,800, the platform could be untradeable until $7,300. 

If the market breaks up here, then there's a strong possibility that the bear market is behind us and it'll be nothing but blue skies ahead. 

To the downside however, there's still plenty of support zones that would offer a temporary bounce and an opportunity to hop into a semi-decent short position. 

Reward for a long = strong position going into the next bull run

Reward for a short = short from $8,200 instead of $7,800. 
Nope, I only trade Bitcoin/usd. 
Precisely
Why don't you google for a sec before writing such nonsense? Truth is: They are shutting down their Japan business.
Only in Japan.
Yep, I 100% agree. I hate wedges.

Just wanted to show that a breakdown of the wedge might not be an immediate violent move down as people think.
And I'm saying the move *might* not be as violent as everyone is expecting, at least not immediately. Everyone was expecting a breakdown of the wedge that broke down at 11.25k to be bad news bulls (me included) but it got caught at 11k before rallying all the way to 11.7k and then truly getting thrown back.

Chart: https://imgur.com/a/sY8WT5G  
Notice the wedge break down that got caught quickly and the subsequent push up to the log ATH resistance (all while still remaining below the wedge support). Then we got rejected at the resistance and the wedge really broke hard.

Not saying a violent move won't occur, I still think one is fairly likely, but there's precedent for something else to happen.
I don't trade bitcoin but since I believe the price will be higher than it is now months from now, I am going to try and trade alts to stack up BTC and when the tide changes I will hopefully have more bitcoin to enjoy than I do today.
Sure but sentiment changes then, crush channel would be broken in that case
I'm all for being skeptical but some of these points I really don't agree with.

> And, the marketing arm of crypto (ICOs marketing crypto in order to generate returns) has been killed as facebook, twitter, google are all banning crypto ads. Not to mention the general regulatory crackdown on ICOs.

This will only hurt shitcoins and scamcoins. Have you ever seen a Google ad about Bitcoin or Ethereum? Every social media (or Reddit) ad you see about crypto is about some ICO-coin created by a shady dev team that want to make lots of money. Also, the US government said about crypto that they don't want to discourage people from participating in this happening, they compared it to the rise of the internet. They want to end ICO scams, not crypto entirely.

> Google trends is down, big. And, it continues to decline (july lows now). Transactions on chain decline (two year lows). No, this bear market is not over yet.

Maybe it's a matter of interpretation, but I don't see it that these metrics are down a lot, I see it that they were up a lot and now we're going back to the normal. Last year July? That's great, we're almost back to February (or whenever the bubble started).
I’m bearish, but you make me look like a bull.

Holy bear

I think you are over trading.  We're at pretty significant resistance (https://www.tradingview.com/x/gEtghmFm/).  If you're bullish; wait for the next pull back and get a good entry for the next attempt at a breach.  That way you won't be having to flip positions at a $20 move against you cos by the time the price is at resistance you're already looking at decent green P/L.
Im in the same boat.  I think we'll head back to 7XXX range then up for another attempt.  By then the line will be a bit lower and may be an easier breach.
"The Whales" (tm)
volume just now wasn't negligible though
The time to buy ETH was last month when weekly RSI was 19 and the price was below 400... :P That was the market basically giving you free money that either would totally crash or at least go up 10%
I'm currently 80% in BTC, 20% fiat, looking for a layered long exit for half of my btc starting around 8400, ending at 8600.

You are right, sometimes it's just hard to sit on your hands...
Yep.  All the ERC tokens.
Or, we don't crash....
One $300 red candle would be interesting. I suspect another would follow, and then we'd be in the untested 7000-7600 range, which would be all kinds of bad. 
If I had to give a figure I'd obviously make it up.

30-40% more probable to see 8500 before 7800
90 percent.
Definitely not out of the woods yet, but what would take to turn the market bearish again? A lot more than smashing through 8300 resistance
Yeah, people are still very suspicious after the bear market.

But I think its pretty clear both fundamental and technical inputs are bullish now.

Everything is aligning for a massive run.
Would 1000 down just be a marge at that point?
hahaha "bractals" I love it.
>Assuming you mean short, yes? 

Yes, sorry. Fixed. 
[removed]
>Whereas if there's a trend reversal, there's a strong possibility you'll be caught on the receiving end of another massive green candle. 

We were at this price around three days ago. I think we need to move much farther to even consider possibility of a trend reversal. 
What if you're still holding an underwater short? :)
Mike and yourself should just get your thoughts stickied to the top of the thread daily. Appreciate the thoughtful discourse, as always. 
>When it goes to $8600 will you add another $1m?

LOL. Most likely not. 
It's not million...
Cost base I think.
cost basis, I'd assume
>What’s CB?

Cost basis. 
Dude's got millions for a reason
Don't quote me on this, but since different prices become support/resistance the color difference reflects that. I'm still new to this indicator and TA.
Same thought. Cancelled my 8300 sell. Think I'll hold on for a bit see where this goes.
anytime now...
BBands are certainly constrained... but I'm not convinced we'll see a big move soon (unless it's up as we're bumping against the top of the wedge.. but this seems unlikely to me).

My bias here is that we'll "Bart" into the Decision Zone and see another big candle. :)  Time will tell!
Chew, I'm thinking of setting a stop buy at 8.3 and a stop sell at 8.05 - I'm a bit frightened to take a position right now because of some losses I've taken recently. What are your thoughts on these entries?
I often find that setting the tightness of my stops proportionally to the tightness of my butthole works well.
That's very personal based on your trading strat.  If it were me and I were betting bullish, I'd set stops below the inside wedge I've drawn here... opposite for bearish bet. 
Depends on your position, depends on the timeframe you trade in, depends on what kind of returns you aim for.

But if the last 2 weeks tought us anything, it's that tight stops is the best way to fuck your trades. 
Very tight it seems, you can pay with Verge a subscription on pornhub to see how tighti mean.
One of the guys in here sold the top of the BTC korea pump during the alt coin craze even though he doesnt even live in Korea
And, again, Bart has no hair. Straight bounce back up.
the only real advice
Not sure about this one.  Crypto market cap is $355.8 Bil @ time of this post.  It has passed the previous bounce from March 21-22 of $354B~ when BTC bounced back to above $9,000 USD.  This most recent upswing has taken place over a longer time span from the March 21-22 swing as well.

When the crypto market cap rises as BTC is falling in dominance, it's a very strong indicator.  It means people are willing to take risk again in the crypto markets.  When people are feeling confident enough to play the alts, that's a bullish signal.  I fully expect BTC to pop back through $9K and regain some dominance shortly.  When the market's going up BTC and alts just take turns.
Realistically there isn't much resistance until 8.6. 
Hey that’s me, added again at 8375.

No shame. Feeling good
Dush is long right now, I believe. I actually have a lot of love for that dude. Went from blatant shit posting, to curiosity, to thoughtful analysis. I enjoy his content very much these days.
Sure its people here being bearish thats the issue and not the fact that comments like this gets upvoted (which is pretty funny when you answer with hostility to a question about why its been peaceful here recently). Shorting actually helps stabalize the price or helps propel it upwards if its done wrong but its obviously those damn shithead bears fault that this place isnt nice and quiet. Its fine to squeeze them and laugh when they get rekt. Your the excellence this thread needs obviously😑 
I live in Montana. I moved here from Seattle last year and it was like stepping back in time. When I mention Bitcoin to people here they look at me like I'm mentioning moving to Mars.

Pretty sure it's satire though right?
"Has double checked his calculations at least 3 times"....... not sure I trust this guys maths
Agreed, although it wouldn't surprise me if a 1k BGD blasts right through it. Such is the market.
that's what she said :O
looks like you may have blinked right before the sell off began, but it'll probably not go down right this moment so you'll have time to get in later
For what reason did u close ur short? 
Feels wrong, doesn't it? That makes me think it might be right.
Why not at the next peak? 
Learned a lot of hard fuckin lessons in that green square.  (hedged the way up, longed the way down)
Hang on, wasn't it a test of the same resistance?
I started scaling into a short at 8.2.  But it's still super tiny, was too late. 

Have a long too from a few days ago with entry point at 7.9, so a decent spread to work with there.
RIP.
I got rid of my stop limit. Letting this one ride out
It's quite a novel suggestion after the ICO craze I know but bare with me.
You still out of position?
Some guy shit-posted that he closed a 300-contract long from $8,000.50 at $8,015.50, because he only trades enough to buy himself a Tuna Sandwich from Subway each day. 

...

Which is ridiculous, because a 300 contract position opened at $8,000.50 and closed at $8,015.50 would only net the trader about $.50 in profit. Far short of the necessary $5 to buy a tuna sub at Subway.
$100 movement.
Either that or much higher. 

This is a situation where even 1 failed support zone will likely trigger a cascade of selling. 

If $8,100 breaks down, then I see no reason for the market to bounce again until $7,800.
Ah yes. Maybe 7700 then. Or as chewy says just take my profit sooner and get back in around 77-7800
Yeah been OOP since 7.9
yes i took profit with an automatic order at 8261 now again.. this is too scary :D but so fun
Same. Manages to add a .15 BTC short at 8296. 
I count 120. Maybe im just sleepy. Point is, that guy really wants the market to confirm that as an ascending triangle, no doubt. 
Sentiment doesn't really matter in bubbled asset.
They still have $10k listed as requirement.  Where are you reading that it changed?
>This decline in traders is evidenced by Bitfinex lowering capitalization requirements from $10k to $1k.


where did you read this?
That's all very interesting. Upvoted. Still would not recommend shorting or selling right now.
The problem with FOMO is that when it collapses it is normally quite a fast descent. Better not be holding the bags when that happens.
Not likely given my estimations of cash stores in BTC back at 11.6 and how low actual transactional utilization is. It would have the largest ratio of extrinsic to intrinsic value of any non-producing asset I've ever heard of, outside of maybe art (which is pretty much a scam anyway).
Cause without it, you can't get a price increase that's going to hold? Arguably the price that's there now is not sustainable given current activity levels.
I'd say it's more like 50-50.
lol
Yeah those stop hunters can be brutal. I'm considering adding if we go higher to dca my short.

the Government just wants to control crypto, know who you are, where you live, what you bought with your crypto so that they can tax the crap out of it, and goad you back to the traditional banking system
This is why I love crypto. They can do whatever they want but they will never be able to control it.
Digging themselves a very ignorant grave.
Hey. No sell, only buy.
we have a bit more room on the 4h though
When is the halving again?
Even with log scale, on gdax they are definitely a couple hundred dollars different. 20>17 is appx 8250 now, while 20>17>11.7 is still up a couple hundred dollars.
Yeah, I've been using log scale on bfx, but it trims the wick of 11.7. If I draw to that wick instead, it raises the overhead target from ~8400 to 8600 today.
Yeah, looks clear on your chart.  Bitcoinwisdom, not so much.  It probably doesn't matter in the long run.

Edit: meaning I should probably be cautious in that range anyway and wait for a very clear confirmation
Huh, just tried opera and that hasn't yet worked for me.
Isn't it the opposite? The 2018 low for almost all alts was mid March, not early Feb.
I should have done this.
You must have made god like money. 


I’m in pain after my 600$ loss.

1.5 BTC? How did you deal with that 
That's what you call a 'rough one'. Glad you made it back.
5 weeks is too much of a mental brain fuck 
Same here, don't know the exact entry point but it was something like that. I've been partially closing and re-opening in order to lower my entry point without taking too much loss (now cost average is $7k), so I don't know if this counts as one position. Also, whenever new Bitmex futures came out I transferred the long from the old to the new futures.
I was underwater, until I was drunk last night an accidentally closed my position for a loss 
What is this funding thing and why have i not heard of it 
Which alt lol 
6 years? How fast did you age 
infinite amount of pain right there... so 9.1k would be the level to watch for a double top?
That's my real concern regarding the bear market. While breaking the log resistance is a necessary step toward a bull market, we *ordinarily* will come back to test resistance as support.... and this resistance-turned-support line would be a quickly descending one.
Alts have been pumping way before the BGD since it started to consolidate in the 6600-7100 range.
Actually, in the days before the BGD, alts started creeping up in SATs. That was my signal to open longs on eth, XRP, and ltc, while building a btc long as well.
haha welcome to the club :D  I have stocked up some red bulls here since it's too early for me lol
Which is exactly why nothing will happen so as to cause maximum brain fuck. Bitcoin gotta bitcoin
he's not showing hand (adding/removing fast). The wall is there and up for grabs. call him on is bullshit.
the fact that the whale didn't just market buy the next ~$100 range just shows he isn't too serious about buying($8280-$8400 would fill his order)

to the right. always to the right.
I just choose a min and Max values and set alerts for those. So i can sleep most of the night unless something strange happens or it hits my stops or profit levels 
more like 15 minutes..
I suggest you research the available theory surrounding sleep.
Here is some inte'rest'ing stuff.
http://highexistence.com/alternate-sleep-cycles/
So basically, it's a correction of the alts ?
Wise words
Risk management and smart stops along with making rational (relatively) low risk/high reward trades.

Even if 60% of your trades are losers you can be profitable overall on the 40% winners.

Here's the first lesson: traders don't peg probabilities of a dump based on sentiment on a random internet site.
careful that's a snake
When is the parade?
I've been seeing the same, but wasn't sure if it was a case of seeing what I wanted to see.
link?
In this case, every TA out there is worthless, asides from the daily sideways scalps.
Hash and catching up on UK politics until my blood boils for me. At least it'll take my mind off work
Tequila is my top choice. ( Patron is trash)

Grey’s anatomy? Might as well throw a bible, green tea and steamed veggies in the mix. 
That sounds incredibly awesome, but I'm fairly certain I'd be passed out within an hour if I did that. 
“ Insert your mom joke here “ 
Can only do that once every two days my friend =( 
My theory was that after the gains made from alts, money gets moved to the safer haven of BTC which then comes the BTC price pump.  Similar reason why money gets moved from BTC to tether, except you eliminate volatility either up or down in doing that.
yeah idk why anyone thinks alts pumping is bullish. it has indicated mild to moderate to extremely severe drops in btc.. alts pump after btc does...then they both dump. 

Also something skiptomydoo said the other day stuck with me.

Bitmex handles most "volume" but Bitfinex moves the market. Someone could easily open a 2k btc short on bitmex and pump Bitfinex up to $8450 to get it filled. once it dumps back down the make significantly more profit than it took to move the market.

That's what all these barts are- dudes getting their orders filled 

Anyway this is looking weak and unconvincing. Nothing has changed or is different until we blow past $8.5k and subsequently $9k. 

$6500 to $8400 is ~28%, 7300 to $9150 is ~25%.

We're very overdue for a larger pullback and all these spoofy buy walls aren't particularly inspiring. 

Can deffo see a pump to $8350-8450 again, but until then this looks and feels pretty similar imo 
I bring this up literally every time someone mentions it, nobody ever seems to get it.

The only time alt/BTC trading effects BTC/USD is when people are buying in to alts with fiat (using BTC as an on ramp) or fleeing alts into fiat (again using BTC as an off ramp).

That and triangle arbitration.
I'm a bit bearish short term but bullish mid-long term but you are super bearish aren't you. Are you shorting?
thanks
thanks, your support site was also not loading for me on desktop but could submit one on mobile.
Exactly what i posted 2 posts above you. You dont even have time to scalp these.
Interesting. Would like to hear more information from other bears too, as well as the bulls.
> Tightened stops on my long, though. 

Cool. So are you not proactively monitoring the market? I mean are you not planning to sit in front of your laptop till the actions happens?
> I closed my long on profit. Not due to insightful TA, merely getting scared by these market movements

In future, looking back at your decision to close might look like a wise one. All the best!

The markets is extremely volatile today I must admit.
> I think we go down a bit below $7800 resistance just because I feel like we need to sustain this little run.

This is unlikely, but a plausible scenario. 

Congratulations for achieving your goal. So are you on the sidelines as of now?
But compared to altcoins, it is somewhat more stable, and that is his point.
I mean btc fell 60% and alts about 70-80%, so it's a start for "stability."

The thing that gets me is I wonder if it is a situation like the one Buffett describes here-

https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/26/buffett-when-choosing-between-stocks-and-bonds-i-would-choose-equities-in-a-minute.html

The gains from the equities dwarf the gains from the bonds making the "safety" of the equities greater long term due to opportunity cost losses by having some of your portfolio in the less volatile but slower growing bonds.  This implies I should make a portfolio of almost total alts for long term performance if bitcoin has begun behaving like "bonds", which I believe it has.  


I think its a good analogy. Bitcoin is the store of value/source of liquidity for ICOs and alts that aim to provide services/functionality (like equities). No need for interest as supply is pre-determined and capped. This to me is Bitcoin's value proposition.
This comment totally confuses me. I must be missing a large chunk of information that would lead you to believe that this is a good comparison.
Is the top chart BTC volume or number of tx?
https://blockchain.info/es/charts/transactions-per-second?daysAverageString=7&timespan=1year

They are going up. 

I know you can spam the network, but you can't prove they are doing it. So either you decide to believe in the conspiracy theory or you decide to believe it's organic growth. 
i think talking about the relationship of alt coins with bitcoin is no violation of rule 2. But there has been a bit of spamming about it so whatever.

Who are the tradingview people? Magic and?
If anything the alts look strong rn, ETH and BCH pumping like crazy. (unless you're talking about just the last hour or so)
I would be worried if google trends for bitcoin was high and we were still at this price.  FOMO follows price increases.  July was at the foot of a mega bull run so this represents a good opportunity to buy before FOMO begins by the masses.
You don't have to search Google once you know how to buy and use Bitcoin.
> Check out google trends for bitcoin keyword (which encompasses bitcoin, bitcoin cash, bitcoin gold, etc). You will see it is sinking to July levels despite representing 5 different coins now.
> 
> 
> 
> There is no FOMO. 

This is extremely bullish. It means people already know what it is.
I think google search trend is the most BS metric to look at as far as predicting the price. 
That doesn't matter.  I own BTC and the price will go to $20K again shortly.  
Yes thank you
Surely that's a big green flag for the market?
Bro i closed for 4 tuna sub loss. This is a nightmare. Mi familia!
Much appreciated!
[deleted]
I actually didn't notice that. I feel better now.
Something something clock is correct twice a day.
Yep its a trading sub after all. I appreciate when i read an opposing view whether im bullish or bearish it can help me form a more rounded view and its always good to have your view challenged especially when you have money on the line. I dont get the whole bullish or bearish circlejerk, there are other subs for this.

On top of your short from 10k+?

May I ask why you are feeling bearish vs bullish? 
Where did u place ur stops? 

I’m a smidge bit nervous 
I'll give you that. It is a legit trading advice most of the time, vs moon kids and "TA is voodoo" crap from the other subs. But if you focus on BTC charts alone, your missing the macro picture.
disagree, in hear it's where people are realistic or call doom , i remember a few weeks  ago so many people being sure we were going bellow 2k
Bitcoin going moon IS realistic. That's what has happened since 2011. IDK about you but I call those things trends.
If you’re suggesting TA is often a 50/50 proposition then actually it’s no better than blind guessing
You have a point. But, Im not trading against the trend. Its just that longing or buying at these levels is just zero risk reward imo. So i think a short position is much better in place for a possible rejection.. so, im looking to open it at around 8500 -8600
 
While retail traders are like...yummy once the log trendline is broken its FOMO time and we are bull again.
Institutional money is like... yeah let they provide liquidity with  FOMO into our astronomical short sell order that are above the trendline..
huge wick up candle , pushed back into the downtrend.  I've seen these things before.... not buying.  i will be bull over at 12 k.  just playing the short term swings in and out for now. 
I mean I don't think we are out of the woods on the 2018 downtrend yet, BUT, I do agree with you that a floor of $7500 and a slow rise back up would be a yugely bullish good sign (for the bulls). I have a small short open, just to see how she goes.


What would be a good level to close an underwater short then? Edit: If it breaks upwards.
This is my interpretation of the market action between $7,800 and $8,450 as well. 

I've said this before, but the onus is not on sellers to continue the bear trend, in the same way that the onus is not on Sisyphus' rock to continue to roll down hill. That will happen naturally once Sisyphus gets tired. 

The onus is on buyers to reverse the trend. And the approach of, "buy the dip and wait for somebody else to keep the buying pressure going beyond resistance" is NOT the path to a trend reversal. 
it's a tease, i doubt much of the selling sold into that wall. Various posts claim it pops and vanishes all the time. I wouldn't take this as a confidential basis to justify your short position imo
You short? Thinking of hedging again
It means if someone comes in to buy 1000BTC, those 3000BTC will FOMO in at a higher price.

It means if someone sells 1000BTC, 2000BTC will still be there to buy.
Seems like. 
How so? It looks to me that a lot of money has been entering the alts (maybe OTC buying) lately. And that money ends up flowing to bitcoin after some consolidation.

A lot of alts have broken long term resist, almost all of them show a rounded bottom,and in many cases you can find a gigantic cup and handle that promises increasing their value a lot. With the market being connected, such movements are to be expected.
Oh I do know that. But people seem overly optimistic in regards to something that is obviously manipulated to shit.
Could be possible. How do you explain the rest of the BGD and BRD that we've seen in the last week. Seems it's very rare for crypto to actually move naturally but rather up and down with sudden __% buys and sells.
Really when you look at the chart since the last BRD yesterday it's mostly been sideways/slightly upwards movement but for the "pumps" that happen at crucial points. Very easy to think we're being played.
12 bitcoins mined every ~~day~~ block (as pointed out correctly by dalovindj)
but then people don't have someone to blame for getting their shorts liquidated. Not sure how often you read here but any movement but sideways according to many here is manipulation, and even sideways is because reasons. 
it was nowhere near the largest daily volume, it was the largest hourly volume. the daily volume was actually relatively low considering the size of the move 

I don't think it was one individual player, but squeezing 15k shorts was an extremely profitable move that I really doubt was just completely unintended. 
So you think that there will be a larger correction than what we've seen?
I only really use the MAs on a longer timeframes and the 50,100/120,200  seem to be the best IMO - they seem to consistently work as support and resistance across a load of timeframes. I know people(and bots) use the EMAs more in crypto because they react faster to price movements. I know people double the Ichi settings which just gives you a higher timeframe cloud from what I understand not sure why this has to do with crypto trading 247 though. 

I'm not entering multiple trades a day anymore so looking for the 10%+moves. I make more money by swing trading over multiple days sometimes weeks especially now we're getting tiny swings instead of 5-10% swings daily. I may chuck a little coin on mex to do some day trading though if I feel like it. It's quite nice getting an entry and then having a full days worth of movement in your favor so you don't have to constantly be worrying about it and can move the stops to break-even, in profit or use trailing stop depending on how far along in the trade you are but I find these difficult to get right.
How I feel: https://imgflip.com/i/28ptu1
This wedge is definitely being respected on the bottom line touches.
Yesss! Give me a whale and I will hatch such a BGD that as it grow bigger, it will give birth to morebaby BGDs. lol
You really think there will be a bull run after a $200 pull back in our current range? In the past month, the furthest we've pulled back prior to a BGD is at most $150. 

I think that if we get rejected enough to trigger my stop loss $200 below the current price, then we are not going to be recovering to that price again any time soon. Just my thoughts.
Yeah, SLs aren't a perfect science, but if it crashes, the benefit sometimes outweighs the risk. 
I'd be looking for a 4h candle. Nah bro my specialty is shorting fakeouts, dont worry about me 
Haha, yeah I guess it would be a Marge at that point
Can confirm the brutality.  Usually stay away from those on mex now.
Yeah, I sold some ETH for BTC around .09ish bc I thought BTC would lead a recovery.  I’m getting spooked already.  I thought we’d see at least .04-.05. 
Smart traders use high leverage all the time to reduce counterparty risk.   It's terrible advice not to tell people not to use leverage.

If you use short and use leverage and your liquidation price is 20% above the current price, then I would say you are fairly safe.
Linear resistance right here, then log resistance at 8.5k lol. Highly likely this will be the reversal point, if there is one.
Basically said if we get through the log resistance, we may blast off. 
Sold 170 in 2015 and bought 19.5 in December. Unloaded at 6401 on April 1. Looking to rebuy on a confirmation breakout above 400k 
Same goes in other direction. 
Long term stack yes

I have a trading stack from $6500
So that explains his bullshit attitude
I think it's a typical beginner's mistake: IF it goes up I want to buy, but only then. It seldom works.
Maybe I'm just letting the bullish sentiment get to me.

I've been waiting for a test of ~7.5k before committing the rest of my fiat from the sidelines (having bought in with 50% at 6.7), but I'm getting FOMO fever.
No, pretty stable.

/u/Wardser is probably right, but it still feels a bit off to me.
There is no evidence of new money. Google trends bitcoin interest continues going down every day.
luckily.. looks like that was just a trap and I fell for it. Sold out.didnt wanna get dumped on..  Guess I'll just buy som alts now...
Thanks - yea I did look into them before. BFX takes ages to sign up for due to backlog and Kraken has loads of bugs Im told (specially with high volume)  and no stoploss option if I am not mistaken - so no go. 
It means TA self-prophecy at work, until a whale comes into play. Just read how many people on this thread have stops both for shorts/longs based on that channel.
We need more confidence, resistance will be overpowered easily.
Cool, thanks! Which app would you recommend for volume notifications? I've only ever done price alerts and that was using Coinbase
Makes some sense I suppose. Just seems odd that we have a rising market (people seem to think it is worth more) but that the same market thinks it will be worth less in 2 months!

A premium flip would be nice since I'm long on June. 
I commented elsewhere but I think the real FOMO is in alts and even that is cooling off right now. 
So you think overall traders have learned from the last 2 weeks not to over leverage? 
Down over months.    In the short term, the Elliott theory indicates there may be a better entry point for a short.
How could I hate such good advice on risk management? Thanks for the lesson. 
He will love you, trust me.
i'd get out now if I were you rather than wait for the rising wedge to play out. the couple of rising wedges we were in, price went up.
Except all the bears have to do if it doesn't rise is be patient, and unload on supports (7.8, 7.5, 7.3 etc)
My guess is it will meander sideways for a bit, possibly even riding it down from above the line.
Yeah, that's what I am pretty curious about, sentiment seems to be pretty bullish right now with most coins except BTC.
I could, but i remember there being a site with a bunch of coins laid out one page comparing to BTC. i just can't find it. 
sweet this will do! 
Yes, I understand that, but there is very little liquidity in alts. Everyone knows that when alts reverse they reverse violently and rapidly. Thus, what happens with alt pumps that are not corresponded by real new market entrants is they fizzle out fairly quickly and then everyone races to the exits as fast as possible to capture what liquidity remains until it is gone.
Closing in on the top of the ascending triangle, failed to break the daily high, bulls are having trouble making any serious movement, ect 
I think if we break 8100 it’s balls to the fucking wall 
Until it’s the right move 
Same gamblers who shorted sub 7500 too.
Well retail is buying and the price doesn't move up so it might not be the most foolish idea ever.
Rose to 27k shorts in the last hours

I don't know what will happen tbh, but I'd rather miss on a green candle than take the risk of a giant red one for now. 
Log downtrend being violently smashed through within next 12 hours. $450 candle. 

This is just a wild guess based on no TA or anything. 😉
Because he didn't provide any reasoning
do *you* have 150 BTC?
$1mil being thrown around like its dollar bills being rained on a strippers ass? Yes that's impressive.
60% of the time, it works everytime.
yes :D That was a pump for ants
You were right. I mean like..really right, only off by $3. It went back almost instantly to 8163.

Wondering if it's really just scalp shorts or if someone is trying to control the price. Is there really much $$ to be made by scalping such movements?
Of course not, I love this ms. Better than any strategy game 
[removed]
If you draw the trend line from six months ago, we are still in a bull market. The bulls don't have to do anything except buy and send their coins to cold storage, reducing supply. Bears are in a world of hurt right now. Tomorrow morning will be a time of great covering. Shorting will not be a good idea for a while.
[removed]
Aaand it's gone.
Yeah, I can't get a reliable trend line, I've moved it about a million times it seems. Good point on the SL though, I'll move it up to 8500. not a big difference really.
The dominance chart is going the [complete other direction](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/) than what you are predicting and has done so for years.
Read and you might learn something.
Both of those are about 5% ranges though.
ah i see, those $200 days, I wasn't in bitcoin
During that time it actually became more stable than oil for almost a year.  Crazy to think.
Interestingly, 7800-8200 is equivalent to 400-420 on a percentage basis. 
LN has more channels than bch has  nodes
Don't blame exchanges screwing you if you have not understood how things work.

If you go 1x short with BTC as collateral, then it is equivalent to simply selling all your BTC to fiat. In other words, you are neutral in terms of fiat.

In contrast, if you go 1x short with USD as collateral, you are "properly" short BTC, i.e. you will gain when price goes down.

If you can't put USD as collateral on your exchange, you need to go short >1x in order to be "properly" short BTC. 

If you don't like this fact, just move to an exchange that allows you to use fiat as collateral (e.g. Bitfinex).
Profit taking, get some fomo shorts to open, liquidate them? Could be.

Pfff its supper easy man 

-Step one . Draw 1-2-3-4-5 A-B-C-D-E on the chart

-Step 2 ???????

-Step 3 lambo-
Terrible advice. You’ll jump around endlessly forever chasing if you follow this advice.
I never said they were tanking, I said their ratio is declining. And bch is down 3%, eth/ltc down 2%+
 Purchases via credit card, yes.  As far as I know, most banks still allow you to purchase via chequing/savings account.
Nah, I made the comment a few days ago when things were tightening up quite a bit. Just thought it was a funny coincidence.
Oh I see, he’s a bear that got burnt, you are a bear that got burnt. Now you’re mad.. makes sense 
its all just a plot in the hope that people open longs, and then the bart strikes again
That would make more sense.

And we saw the accumulation that would warrant that back at upper 6ks the other week.
It was and still is blasted on CNBC every day. It is put above stocks on yahoo finance. The idea that crypto is in "early adoption phase" just shows are delusional people are. 
I know plenty of people that spoke of it as spectators on the sidelines, but few that actually invested any considerable amount of money into any projects, almost exclusively bitcoin if any. 

When idea of "average joe" adoption means (to me) most people investing a considerable amount of money into all viable cryptos, as if it were a bond or a mutual fund. We are still very far from that. 
ah ok, I don't think we will go down a lot; but I don't TA, just my gut feeling haha
That's been reduced, besides you can just transfer in coins, trade, transfer out and cash in wherever. Simples.
lol, I could give you my Bitfinex account, I don't use it.

And I honestly never have a problem with BitMex from Europe
Might just hold it out til then. Don't mind baby ing a bit, been on a break from tilling the cornfield 


it'll be very difficult not to open my entire position up to $9.2k again 
Understood--thanks sir.
That's actually a fair interpretation. Although FOMO just sounds dirty. 

Short-to-medium-term indicators are a bit of a mixed bag. 

RSI is fairly neutral on most timeframes, skewing ever so slightly toward overbought. Particularly on the 6h. 

4h MACD is struggling to flip green, with the 30m through 2h either already red or close to crossing. 

There's nothing in the way of bullish MA crosses on the horizon, as the 15m through the 1d have all crossed up at some point in recent history. 

And I've already mentioned BBands, which are getting pretty tight across the board. 

If I were at a casino and simply had to make a decision on betting on black (long) or red (short), I'd likely bet on red here. But I wouldn't feel super confident about it.
good move on changing your approach due to bitmex.

 I've largely stopped trading short term breakouts etc. as like you say, can't get an order through. I was desperately hitting the order button non-stop from 6950 to 8200 on that 15m candle and didn't get through once. 

Haven't fully decided yet what my new approach is...probably use stop limits more
in fact I might not trade on bitmex anymore.

Getting liquidated on that stop hunt flash crash at 2.21am on ethereum btc https://blog.bitmex.com/a-note-on-recent-eth-liquidations/ - my liquidation price, of course, was 0.052, was a bit of a final straw
Apologies. I saw the clickbait headline this morning on cointelegraph and didn't bother to click it.
Thanks for the clarification.
I agree.
I see, and agree with your sentiment. Which do you think is more likely?

We'll just have to monitor the action when it comes and respond accordingly.
I'm describing what happened in 2014.  A pump up, horizontal, then resistance turned support for 2 more years.
> This will only hurt shitcoins and scamcoins.

Not at all. When people see these ads they are introduced to crypto in general. They usually end up buying ethereum and bitcoin and thus learning the process. And it creates demand for those coins.

It is a very important market arm of crypto in general.

> I don't see it that these metrics are down a lot,

It's down to last july, which is pretty big especially because "bitcoin" keyword represents 5 different coins (bitcoin cash, gold, etc). Whereas last july it only represented 1 coin.
There is a LOT of regulatory risk right now in crypto that I think most people are not accounting for. There is also a lot of outright fraud. Crypto is an awesome idea, but that does not mean it is not severely overvalued.

There are a lot of factors conspiring against crypto right now and as much as we all like to masturabte to the idea crypto is decentralized it is not. Especially how it gains value (exchanges) is literally just a few owned by a few people. Any collapse of this infrastucture would collapse the price. Even a hint of additional buying friction would collapse it.

More than that though, the public has just lost interest in crypto. And, when the crypto ads stop running, it will literally be "out of sight out of mind" for most people. All ads will be stopped on twitter, facebook, and google soon.
It wasn't yet, but now that potential is gone. Bitcoin is a speculative asset. It's usage is actually down versus 2 years ago. A speculative asset needs new entrants. So, losing 1/3 of the world population (china, india, pakistan) is a big blow to future growth.
the hodl gang controlls the low pas lookout they dont dump on you
Goblins, from what I hear.
Sounds like a Bitcoin horror movie or something
The volume looks low to me which is super weird. Medium/high volume dumps which recover unbelievably fast on volume a lot lower (in comparison to the dump). What does this mean?
Exactly, alts were in a bad way, so it wasn't a sure bet to hold too long.  I had traded ETH plenty, but never long term trades, just short scalps.  The risk of dropping to 0 was real at the time, at least to me.
That's possible, but all the data suggests we will crash. About 1/3 of the population is banned from buying bitcoin easily via bank transfer to an exchange. 

Exchanges are under multiple investigations. No one still knows whether Bitfinex Polish accounts are frozen or not because they did not release an official statement like they said they would. Bitcoin google trends are still declining and are currently at July lows, which says something because the "Bitcoin" keyword encompasses about 5 different coins now whereas in July it only represented 1 coin.

Need I go on?
I cringed at that passive aggressive closing sentence. 
Emotional 

"don't say you weren't warned" 

*eyeroll* 

Yall are goofy 
cockiness is a recipe for rekt
Hey man don’t get mad at me. It’s a big position for me; I didn’t just jump into a short without carefully going over probabilities and my own strategy. One of us ends up green and one of us ends up red. 
An Adam and Eve double bottom off $6,000 and $6,400 wouldn't confirm until $11,700. 

However, the market is just a few hundred dollars away from breaking the log resistance line that has been containing the market since $20K. 

While the market might not react immediately, I'd argue that a trend reversal would be confirmed with a weekly open and close alove that line. 
Well, at this point you might as well hold onto it and hope the log resistance line holds. 
What does $1mm stand for? I thought it was million.
your goonna get faked out with those entries lol
ive made some purchase a few weeks ago that now are in profit, i am thinking about setting SL at a slight profit and set some limits laddered down. May be a sane decision.
man I wished I was active in this sub during the top
If someone knows how many coins they tried to dump that'd be good to see whether it was a big or small attempt that was absorbed. I'm sure someone has it in them still to dump 1000+ coins if they so chose. 
Perhaps, except you don't see much buying in the alts or any coins. There is a series of pumps. A flurry of activity and then a dead market. This is indicative of centralized trading and not organic.

You can look at bitcoin charts and literally see a 5k coin pump and then hours later the same 5k coin dump. When asset prices rise, psychologically people want to hold. Just the way humans are built. So, it decreases the sell liquidity and makes the next pump raise the bar even that much higher. It is the alts reduced liquidity that cause it to pump higher than bitcoin.

However, it comes to a point where it becomes unsustainable unless sufficient new money enters the system. Based on external metrics, it does not look like new money is actually entering.
Realistically? youFlower!
Haha, I spotted your convo down below with Sloppy and thought it would be worth sharing. Apologies for no credit given.
He’s my favorite troll with a serious edge when he needs to. 

Idk where he has been. 
still think he is more of a troll than a thoughtful analyst. wait for a 200 300 drop and he will be here with his short and signature posts
I think he entered a long 2 days ago. 
he got permabanned. Kinda stupid imo, but he did shitpost a lot. I personally wouldn't mind if they unbanned gypsy and dush if gypsy calmed down a bit  / stopped following people around and dush stuck to more analysis on top level comments

Shut up nerd 
I shoot 40-50 weddings a year, with 100 or so guests and I never hear Bitcoin mentioned. Not ever.
Yes.
That is correct actually. I was there the first few minutes after it was posted and the post is indeed 100% satirical. It turned into a snowball of idiots not fully comprehending this fact and jumping on the “bandwagon”.
there is no way in hell we blast through the log downtrend line with a 1k candle IMO, but who knows.
maybe 1k BRD?

Na, I closed about an hour ago. The selloff happened seconds after the bitmex funding closed. funny stuff
feels wrong to short now. Time will tell
We are not intersecting with log resistance yet.
Actually, you're right, but the level peak (11600, not the 11.8k reversal peak). Because we're still under the downtrend line. 

edit to add: not a fractal believer, just passing the time
We aren't quite at the resistance yet but yes, it's looming large.
Too late for what? Add a short above 8.2? 
You're simply asking to much.
there should be a bot for that.
No, I couldn't stay away actually. My positions are kind of a mess right now, though, to be honest. If I were on the sidelines right now, I'd be scaling into a short from 8230-8280 with stops around 8375 just to play the rising wedge.  
> Some guy shit-posted that he closed a 300-contract long from $8,000.50 at $8,015.50, because he only trades enough to buy himself a Tuna Sandwich from Subway each day. 

Lol, what a shitposting god. Do you have a link to the post?
Didn’t include minor drop to 8171 

They are keeping it at the 8230 price range and not sure why
Yes I've been trying to balance the same equation. 

Id like to set a stop at 8kish within profit, but I think that that could get hit and we bounce and I chase to re-enter higher.  I'm thinking that if we fall to 7800 and I had a SL there, I'd have the same chase. I'm not interested in holding below that.  

Best case could be I fully TP at 8100ish, and we actually go to 7800 and don't bounce but stabilize so I can re-enter.  But that is like 3 ifs in a row, the probability of that exact situation is so slim. 

My entry is 7900 and I already took half the profits at 8250. So for now I have an order to refill a little tiny bit at 7900, and SL just below 7800, additional potential loss on the refill is meaningless but will be good if we swing back up.  And I'll still be in green in any case overall on this trade. 

Heh I'm really split on a profitable SL or 7.8.  so for now ill keep it where it is. Maybe I'm getting married to the position an my obsession of 7.8 and I should just go the most profitable route. 

If my entry was 8.1k or up, I'm sure I would set break even and bet that if that breaks I can re-enter better. 
I was long from 6.8 originally too. And I did some take/refill scalps up in this area with it all the way up to our top.  By the end, the CA was up to 7.6.

But in the end, the difference of profit between 8.1 and 7.8 was significant enough that I let it slip out at 8.1, and said I would reenter. Which I did, which has also worked out. 

So now putting everything in perspective, yeah, lock in those profits man, I would (and did) set an 8k+ SL in your situation. 

My initial reply was more based on your initial SL, not the full perspective. 
I hope you're not actually 50x though. That's a great entry given what we have on the charts. 
It is already pulled too.

So I'm in a good position. I scalped quite a bit to have about 1/4 BTC buffer. I'm thinking of staggering shorts as we go up and close once we've held above the resistance line for a few days.

Short 1/3 my stack since 8210

Planning to short another 1/3 8310

Another 1/3 at 8410

Would close above 8500 after a few days. I doubt we just shoot through to the moon in one go.

All 1x short, nothing fancy. Just trying to protect fiat profits at this point.
Holding an underwater short on swaps, which was at 8100. I reduced by 50% at 8130 last night and just added some back at 8230. Another add on the books at 8275. New CA would be 8175 if they execute.

Still long sep futs @ 6410 and opened long with chewy last night at 8060 on jun futs. 

I strongly dislike holding this many opposing positions. It's begging to get wrecked (aside from the 6410 long). If I were on the sidelines, I'd probably look to scale in a short at the top of this wedge and bail with a 2% move to the upside. That's essentially what I'm doing, but my CA is weighed down by the lower entry, which is why I'm holding the long still. I've held when I shouldn't and now I'm trying to mitigate damage by scaling in/out of positions. As long as we don't have any catastrophic 5%+ candles, I can probably do it. I do have catastrphic stops on the short over 8500 and the long under 7900.
Good luck with these 3D views of my every-fucking-trendline chart...    https://imgur.com/a/0Kily  It is in logview, so IIRC the more curved lines were drawn in linear view.  But at the moment I'm confused on that and have to run.

It should be enough for you to be able to redraw trendlines, and approximate downward channels and potential recovery channels.  It's a fucking mess but I find it very helpful.

I circled the points I mentioned.

I was mistaken on the 21st intersection.  It is actually Feb/March support.  That line happens to be nearly the same as a something-from-last-year/Feb line, but I forget which.

The November/Feb support intersection is not circled, but it is the next intersection on the downtrend line.

It's not, I'm just giving you a hard time. 

Although I will say that it's a lot more helpful to post in real time than in hindsight. 
Most people like to show off their achievements.

Yep just like heroin and other drugs.   They can't control it and tens of thousands of people are rotting in prison right now for using it.  

Got to love it.
Yes, I agree.


I also can see a rising wedge on the 4h charts.


https://imgur.com/a/8zTL9n5


I am thinking we may soon breakout of it. Which way we will breakout, I am not entirely sure of. The stoch RSI is looking to have a bearish cross in overbought territory, but the MACD is about to have a bullish cross. Since we are repeatedly testing the bottom of the rising wedge, I feel as though it should end up breaking down anytime here, but it could also just mean that it is really good support. Time will tell.


What do you make of the volume? It appears to be remaining pretty steady, if not increasing slightly.

771 days to go at time of this post. End of May 2020.
Lines--especially multi-month lines--are really just zones. The longer the line, the wider the zone. I'd give this ATH downtrend line about a 1.5% zone. 8550-8700. 
Yes but let me rephrase: 

When BTC hit 6k first time around, alts we’re gaining no ground.

When BTC hit 6k second time around, alts started gaining ground. 

It was the dip between 11.7k-6.4k where alts lost most SAT value, but rebounded fast the second time we bottomed out 

Edit: there was no hope for an alt rebound when BTC hit 6k the first shot 
It's the opposite indeed. 
I popped my cherry too soon on that one. Was still a very good trade but could have been a lot better. 

Fucking 20/20 hindsight. 
I had 5BTC and after had 3.5BTC.

Told myself any good trader can make this back, and I’m a great trader, so let’s do this.

Sold 1.5 BTC for fiat, went 1x long at 8k with 2 BTC, closed at 11.5k with 3 BTC

shorted on the way down to build up to 3.5 BTC and bought back 1.5 BTC with the 10k fiat when we hit 6500 or something. Back at 5+ BTC

Never even touched cold storage
but it was so much down anyway and I did not really need the money,  so I did not did the usual mistake of closing just because it looked ugly
TUI is misdemeanour! 

Control your impulses and don't open too many positions as I have been noticing it has been the case with you lately.

EDIT: TUI (Trading Under Influence), it can be punishable by hefty loses. 
I don't margin trade so I don't know the specifics, but my general understanding is that on (Bitmex, i think?) that whatever position (long or short) is in most demand pays a funding premium to people holding the opposite position. So when there were 40k longs and very few shorts, people holding shorts would get paid funding premiums from those holding longs.
Its part of how margin trading works, which means leaving money long term on a margin trading exchange without margin trading.
XRP :) but that would have been the same with any alt as they all fell like hell at the same time (and BTC)
i pretty much forgot about them ever being there...
Here are the areas of interest that the market has to deal with going forward:

1. $8,600: The log resistance line (this is fairly rapidly descending as well)

2. $9,200: This is needs to be overcome to invalidate the multiple bearish divergences that are present from the 1h through the 1d.

3. $11,700: This needs to be overcome to confirm the Adam and Eve double bottom at $6,000 and $6,400. 

4. $20K: Previous all time high, and the final boss fight before ?
did it get bought because its gone again. 
Yeah, definitely trying get the guppies to bite. Nobody seems to be taking the bait yet.
It is already pulled
Hey it's bitcoin were talking about.
I wish i could do this, but there is no alarm that could wake me in the middle of the night. I'll just snore right through it. Tried and tested.
I meant while I sleep. I sleep 2-3 hours at a time
It's a correction of Crypto market

[Total Market capitalization](http://prntscr.com/j7ayu0)
I wouldn't call it a correction, since most alts are all still overvalued IMO, honestly the drop was more of a correction.  But I'd call it a return to alts, and crypto in general.  

(disclaimer, I say they are overvalued, but they are still over > 50% of my portfolio)
I didn't ask the question about the probability of a dump.  If you aren't interested in the opinion of myself or the other person or think it's an inappropriate question, then go somewhere else.
Steve's organizing it. He said probably next weekend. 
https://imgur.com/a/Ls4k2pZ



It looks bearish all around if you ask me.


Edit: We seem to be bouncing up to invalidate the 1h rising wedge after all. 4h rising wedge is still very much in play.
may our fingers be forever sticky
I have literally watched everything except grey’s and westworld only airs next week

I got Patron at the Duty Free. The other one they had was Milagro, which is better, but Imm getting sick of it. I live in a country far far away, so our tequila is trash
three for me
I can see your reasoning, but that would mean 'new' money dipping their toes into crypto would go straight into all kinds of unknown and volatile alts..
Unless it's 'old' money (Tethered) which is fomoing back in, but Tether volume doesn't support that thought.

hey sloppy what's your play here? I see less of your posts these days
Intuitively I feel that buying BTC with other cryptocurrencies would raise BTC fiat price, but I don't understand the mechanism by which that would happen.
Some of us are not 'getting it' because we don't agree with you.

BTC is BTC. There is a fixed supply of the actual coins. There is not some separate magic pool of it sequestered for alt trading and another separate pool for fiat trading; when demand increases from the alt side, it reduces the supply on the fiat side to the extent that those trading alt into btc do not immediately turn around and convert 100% of their btc into fiat.
No, I am not shorting. Shorting in a manipulated low liquidity market is not good. However, I definitely position traded out of coins. I will buy back in the $6XXX for a swing trade.

Bitcoin is definitely very manipulated. You see this with the Bart formations. With the 1500 BTC buy wall just pulled. In the big pumps and dumps. This all works in an expanding market. However, Bitcoin market is very obviously contracting both in number and in potential (due to number of bank transfer bans covering about 2 billion people).

So, these coins that were bought in this B wave of a classic Ellitot ABC correction will all be sold back. And, due to the low liquidity, will cause a pretty big dump when it happens, IMO.
Recent bear flipped to bull. The last 24 hours has seen a lot of attempts down with bounces back up again and quickly too. You could say that from the other side too. But coupled with a new tax season, 6k never hit again and any attempts to go near it rejected and the length of the bear market so far people are getting tetchy and are making a bull market self fulfilling.

Which makes sense as traders make the market.

It could still go to 7500 but way way down again? Unlikely for me to imagine in the near term. There's more reasons to be a bull than bear right now.
I have a ticker up on a third monitor and work at a computer all day, so it's not really a fair question.
Thanks! Well, for now I am shown the all-too-familiar bitcoin reaction: I closed my long, it starts rising shortly thereafter :)
Yes I am 100% tethered up since I am looking to buy in anywhere around the $7800 mark depending on how we get there. Not searching for bottom.

That was my goal since 2 BTC represents a bit more than 20% of my portfolio so it was my hedge in case BTC moved 20% up or down from here but my gut instinct, not based on TA was telling me BTC will go lower. It's my opinion only and I have no evidence to back it up. I'm playing with profits only but with the bear market we've been in (and the one I held through since 2014) I have become overly cautious and it has clouded my judgement at times. For some reason it's harder for me to gamble with just profits.
Guy says that bitcoin must be like bonds for altcoins because it has lost a lot less value than them. But im just saying that there is no guarantee this will happen again. 
Transactions
You are not looking at transactions. You are looking at "The number of Bitcoin transactions added to the mempool per second."

Adding something to the mempool does not make it a transaction. It is only a transaction if it is written to the blockchain.

I already linked you to the transaction data. You can see that it is not really going up and is within the realm of randomness.
The post needs to be explicitly focused on Bitcoin and/or the trading pair.

Mods are talking about this issue. More news later.
Yeah, I think horizontal lines are one of those undeniably useful TA concepts. Literally everyone uses them in some way. 

I think using diagonal lines is a bit more useful when used to consider intersections with horizontal ones. 

People like to keep *really* tight diagonal lines too, and there's so much noise that it they'll look invalidated but are just kind of stretching

However, that FOMO was generated largely by ICOs spending 100s of millions of dollars on ads. It is a simple formula. I spend $10 million dollars and I attract $100 million. It is a huge incentive to advertise and bring in more people to crypto.

Facebook, twitter, google, have all announced ad bans for crypto. So, the advertising is going away. Not to mention the general crackdown on ICOs by regulatory bodies. The incentives that existed in July to promote crypto are fast disappearing.
That is not why people search. People search for the price, news, etc. Hell, I type local bitcoins in google to go to localbitcoins.com. All of that is encompassed by the bitcoin keyword. Even when people search "bitcoin cash".
Exhibit A: https://anacoinda.github.io/localbitcoins/all.html
Yes, people already know what it is as it is in late-stage adoption as a speculative asset (it is placed above stocks in yahoo finance).

HOWEVER, that is NOT bullish. The "bitcoin" keyword encompasses all searches including every search for the bitcoin price, bitcoin news, etc. Basically, it represents how many people are 'watching' or caring about bitcoin. Not people searching for it's definition.

In that sense, it is very bearish.
I think there's value in it, but it's a trailing indicator not a predictive one.
Short-term it is not that good because crypto is a manipulated market. When a coin is being pumped though it is a very good metric to use to guess whether the pump will stick or not.

And, google trends and crypto price is nearly 1:1 correlated.
That's what happened last week, from 6950 to 6780, then straight back up. Then we all now what happened.
Man I'm sorry to hear, is that 4 tuna sub with or without coupons???? 
let me consult my crystal ball
and if someone wants to reference the chart and give some cool TA or analysis i'm 100&#37; down for that. But if someone comes in here to post "lulz goblin town inc" then they can gtfo. 
No I closed that short finally. At a terrible spot, tbqh, whuch is why I've been absent. Needed a break. New position is 1/5 the size of my old short. 

Bearish because $8500 was originally where I planned on shorting and it's roughly 25-28% up from the bottom, which is what $7300-$9200 was. 

not to mention 2 bear divs on the 4h, another one possibly forming if we break $8500. If we pass $8500 I'll possibly close and re short at $8700-9000.
No stops on short.  2x, nonthreatening size.  Not gonna try to call or catch a top, just gently get there and keep the total loss on it far, far below the laddered winnings of my long profit taking, ladders go up to 9.3k.  If it eventually looks like we'll never go down again, I can hopefully (most likely) eat loss on the short while still keeping most of the upper profit on the long.  Best case is I profit fully off both if we correct below whatever my short's CA becomes.

Long stops are still 7.8 in loss... gonna lift those now to at least 8 in profit.
Once you start checking the sub regularly you can easily sort through all the moon and doom boys! There's a good mix of bulls and bears in here. 
Those people are just moon kids in reverse, depending on what time frame they're talking about. $2k is not unrealistic long term, like 1-2 years. I'm sure you won't believe it but it's about as if not slightly more likely as $20k+ 

there were plenty of bears here saying it looked like a local bottom
There were not many people calling 2K. 
meh it's about as likely as it dumping to the ground. One day it won't moon and people will be in disbelief until the bottom 
Try trading blind sometime and come back to me with your results.
Depends how much further risk you're willing to take. I'd probably target 8325 as time to bail, but these stop hunting wicks have been insane. 8480 is the next major resistance line, though 8400 should have horizontal resistance. Downtrend from ATH is up at 8600.

I'd probably set a stop limit with an 8325 trigger and 8280 limit and a market stop at 8351. But that's with my risk tolerance. May be higher than yours.
no, I sold half my stack at $8K and the other half is still long waiting with a stop loss at $7800 

I don't do margin shorts any more, "shorting" is just selling my existing stack at a high price and waiting to buy it back lower 
That assumes this person has the actual intention to buy. I could be someone who bought 10k BTC back in the day and is now slowly cashing out. That person could be using the already cashed out FIAT to erect those buy walls to keep up the price in order to sell the remaining BTC for a high price.
It’s a fairly illiquid market so the moves of big players have pronounced influence.  Are you under the assumption that a retail investor has the same market impact as a hedge fund?  Or a trading desk at JPM?  Not sure how long you’ve been around but, it’s even more pronounced when the market is spooked...and everyone here has free fall/chop PTSD.  
Just low liquidity. I mean if I owned a bunch of Tesla stock (which I do not, and would be a horrible idea), I could open up a leveraged short position and then market dump my stock. Same thing right? Difference is liquidity in the market. Probably was happening plenty on the way down as well, for BTC.

And yes, with low liquidity (since we are all skittish as fuck right now) means that market makers can go long/short on Bitmex at high leverage and move the price with buys or sells. It is "natural" in our current low liquidity market. It will get better over time as it improves. 

Pretty sure this happens in other markets, but they are much larger and have much more liquidity so the % moves are smaller (much).
It took me way too long to figure out what BGD and BRD stand for...  But I love that those terms now have acronyms.
Yup :(

I had a wider wedge than you're looking at. If that's the case, potential for entry is closing quickly. I'd probably layer in from 8220-8300: https://www.tradingview.com/x/D4knVjNk/

I'm still holding short from 8100, but I reduced the position considerably at 8130 last night. I'll probably look to add some back in up to 8300.

edit: added 1/3 back at 8230, 1/3 order at 8280, and keeping 1/3 in reserve.
well look at this https://www.tradingview.com/x/fIofirHJ
I would like to subscribe to your newsletter. 
Nice. 
Yeah, buying on dips through limit orders has a moment where your heart skips a beat, especially when it goes a bit lower than expected (add to it again lower then if it doesn't look like doom!).  But those are the good positions.

If you're opening positions with consideration for comfort, you've already lost.  Particularly because you won't hold onto it with any conviction, you're already set yourself up to sell it for loss in the next round of volatility.

Don't open something at 8.3 with SL at 8.1 that has a high chance to get hit, when you could probably open at 8.1 with SL at 7.9 (or 7.8) that has much better CA and lower chance of hitting SL.

This advice is for 24~72 hours ago though...
I'm out of position with 50% fiat on the sidelines right now, been waiting for a retest of around 7.5 considering we just blew right through 7k to 8k. I'm thinking of a stop market to catch a pump if Im wrong and we break through 8.3. Basically a hedge long.


Good good let the FOMO flow through you
I hope you mean 50% of disposable fiat you can safely risk! 
While overall interest is going down, it does not mean that there is absolutely no new money coming into the space.
but only if you need to be verified. otherwise you can transfer 10k in crypto and start directly
Stop loss is possible on Kraken but not stop limit - it is executed at market if your stop is triggered.
TradingView 👍 
A break over the green line should flip that to a premium. I'm also long on June, so here's to us: https://www.tradingview.com/x/t65CJ1Th/
Hey thanks for the sentiment.  Yeah with risk management it's all about avoiding the worst case scenario, which usually requires also sacrificing the best case scenario.  In your present state it's now managing the difference between a bad or worse situation, but probably no solely happy options are remaining.
That's why I suggested to close some of it now.

If he did take my advice at the time of my post, he already could have closed some of the position at $100 lower than when he posted it.  

We're back to the same price as when he posted, so if he feels like it now, he could still close the rest here for the same as before.  But with the added bonus that hopefully some of it was also closed for $100 better price within the last hour.

This is risk management without panic or fomo.

Anyway, I wouldn't trade soley on a wedge/triangle/flag, as they move 50/50 these days.  And even if it breaks up, it can still come back down.
was it coinmarketcap? 
Yes that is very true. However right now liquidity is still there. I market sold double digit BTC worth of alts earlier and it barely moved the price. However most of the ratio is down since so that's what makes me think today is a bit different and people are a bit cautious.
yes, highly likely....but it won't be a sure thing since $8000 support might still hold...and a 1% move isn't enough to get confirmation 
Where do you see evidence of retail buying? Exchanges are having a hard time attracting customers. Bitfinex lowered capitalization from $10k to $1k for example to attract new customers. Google trends is continuing going down. And, exchagne site traffice contines downward.

This is all whale buying with some small winnows mixed in.
could be true. 
no but I'm just 1
Yeah, and when you get the 40% part, you get rekt. The beauty of Bitcoin daily trading.
yes
Yeah it's fun to be honest. 



5 months ago, I never thought I would have fun looking at markets and charts. What happened to me.
[deleted]
Yep. I'm usually decent at spotting the fake walls, but this was multiple prices, odd amounts, and multiple orders.
Using line snapping to snap to exactly the high wicks of the ATH and the second trip to 11.8k, it's currently at 8630 (4 hr chart). Placing a range around there would put it at ~8500-8700.

I mean you do you, it's your money. But personally if I were targeting that breakout I'd have my SL at ~8750 to be safe atm and gradually move it down with the line. In my opinion 8500 still seems pretty low unless it takes us until Sunday or Monday to test it.
It's not the span of the range, it's the time spent within that range. 

It's only been 7 days so far in this range. Bitcoin has spent multiple weeks consolidating in similar or even tighter ranges on numerous occasions.
Yes, so we're 25% of the way there from a "time spent consolidating" sense.
Irrelevant.

In bitcoin miners are the nodes and the nodes are the miners.

Free free to observe the network or not, if your business or service requires it, the bitcoin network itself doesn’t care.

That individual users need to run observer nodes is one of the great lies that derailed progress. The overwhelmingly vast majority of users don’t, the overwhelmingly vast majority of users never will, they never needed nor were intended to in the first place.

Bitcoin is secured by mining, not Sybil vunerable signaling.
Thats what I said. You need to go > 1x short with BTC as collatetal for you to gain relative to fiat. As for exhanges not using Fiat as collateral.. effectively to their advantage. Not blaming.. just pointing out the fact.. screw might be a bit harsh.. just saying "Good business" is a synonym for screw you in this market. 
Could be, could be anything. None of it is significant enough to warrant any attention tho, imo.
On the 15 minute chart?
Always happens after a pump, it’s nothing. Watch the charts more and you’ll stop reading anything into it.
I don't know, but I suppose it's good to remain skeptic. If I had a long from 6.8 I'd keep it with a stop around 7.5, if I had a short from 8.4 I'd keep it with stop at breakeven. But I'm still out of position since a short from 8.1 closed at breakeven and find opening a position here is gambling. Simple buying without leverage would not be the worst idea I suppose tho, don't think there's more than 50% downside remaining if ever, so long-term it's probably ok.
I mean adoption-wise it still is.. I don't know anyone paying their bills with btc.
My cousin works at dairy queen and was 17 and bought everything on GDAX back in November. Lots of normies bought 
I don’t think we go down much either. But I think we go down instead of up. But we’re about to find out
Just mentioning it for the comments i am seeing. I'll move to Bitmex when/if i get a HODL stack, for now i rather trade from USD
Alts are toppy, I retract my 8.6 comment. I'd short the shit out of 8.6 though. 
thats the beauty of stop losses, you can bet on black while keeping the cost of getting a red at 1-2%


/u/_chewtoy_ If you weren't in position right now but weren't confident you'd be able to trade a breakout fast enough and wanted to go ahead and put in buy/sell orders to long or short in the event of a breakout, where would you put them? Long at 8500 and short at 7800?
You won't, but others certainly will. 

Until an alternative pops up with similar leverage offerings, there will be no shortage of users more than happy to accept Bitmex's shortcomings in exchange for 50x to 100x leverage. 
> Not at all. When people see these ads they are introduced to crypto in general. They usually end up buying ethereum and bitcoin and thus learning the process. And it creates demand for those coins.

> It is a very important market arm of crypto in general.

That sounds fair. Although a big part of the people that see these ads probably skip BTC and ETH because they feel like they missed out, and buy into these more risky coins instead.

> It's down to last july, which is pretty big especially because "bitcoin" keyword represents 5 different coins (bitcoin cash, gold, etc). Whereas last july it only represented 1 coin.

We should probably agree to disagree, but again I don't think this matters at all. Bitcoin cash, maybe, Bitcoin gold and others, no way. The only people who look for BTG are people who click the previously mentioned ads, or people who already know about crypto and know where to look (and search on sites like Reddit).
How do you call somebody with no body and no nose? The answer to this riddle is also the answer to your question.
I think ETH , XMR(nice user name), BTC and EOS and NEO are the safe long term holds, ETH I only accumulate and do not trade
I am the most rational person you've ever met. This has nothing to do with emotion. I have been warning you guys in good faith for two weeks to short with caution and preferably not at all. 

If you scroll back through my post history, you will know better than to take this warning lightly. Short now, and you absolutely will lose.
Now would not be a bad time to take profits.  

Personally I'm only trading big moves on the daily as it's been more effective for me.  I'll trade this wedge in either direction once it breaks.
He got permab&. 

Ah wtf. He was a troll, but he was OUR troll. We should start a petition
K... lmao point proven
I always have jokes with my Bitcoiner friends. When we go to parties, you can usually see people spending obscene amounts of money on dumb things. A wedding is not dumb, but some people deff spend dumb money at weddings.

So, back in like 2015, a friend of ours (who thinks BTC is a PonziCoin) shelled out 15k-ish for an engagement ring. My buddies and I all went out and bought 15k worth of BTC (about 45 BTC at the time).

His wife carries around a clunker to remind him of just how stupid he was back then.

It's a matter of time and perspective. People will be talking about BTC in 10 years IMO
> maybe 1k BRD?

Maybe
If this is wrong, I don't want to be right: https://www.tradingview.com/x/4J35zQUL/
Don’t scare me like this. I’m short 
Yeah missed some chances so far on the higher values we just passed by, as I just started opening this position.

Edit: meh basically the same anyway :)
I’m long from about 8150, but does not feel comfortable at all. Thinking of cashing in my 3% profit. 
The original post was removed, but here's the rest of the thread:

No only 3x lol. I now have entires at 8220, 8255, 8270, 8296 
It's funny how people don't think whales try to manipulate the markets. Some guy just decided to post a 1500BTC buy which of course will not give an optimal price even if it was executed. But then he pulls it after barely any buys.

My guess is they are trying to keep the market sentiment high while they slowly sell out BTC position.
Thanks.  I didn't realize that US residents can't trade there. :/
thanks
Link?
Considering that crypto is not attracting new users and its potential and accessible user base continues to shrink, I would say that it stops shortly. Thus, take the price now and you have a high probability of making 10% by wating for it to go lower than buying in and hoping to do a swing trade.
Baller status. Good luck 
I don’t spend as much time here as some others. I also did post my strategy as price direction was unfolding three days ago.

I get where you are coming from with the feedback and I do appreciate it.
Aren’t we all to a certain extent? I don’t understand the argument here because any insight, regardless of timing could surely be helpful? 
As did everyone online back in the late nineties. Now look at us: pirate bay guys jailed, TOR compromised, ISPs compelled to log and spy on their users, VPN providers raided.

Crypto will not be immune.
I'm not even considering the wedge at this point, just the support line of that wedge.
Makes sense.  Thanks.
A lot of alts formed a cup and handle in the daily, which is pretty bullish to my understanding. 

But tron and Verge are still there... 
I'm holding one remaining alt position just as a reminder to be careful about buying ATHs. Diversified way too much in the January alt frenzy. Fortunately it was only a $250 position, but it's worth $21 right now. Bottom was around $10. I'm holding it until it's green. lol
Not all heros wear capes
In my historical notes, upward from here, I have very similar thresholds listed as significant but for totally different old and not-so-technical reasons (copy paste from notes):

1. 8500~8600 was key battle ground recenty  (not sure if that is still relevant though) also 8794 is a 50% retracement from 5.8~11.7.

2. ~9200 seems to be serious price point for market to sit above.  9294 strong support and medium resistance.  9215 is 23.6% fib from 20k to 5.8k.   9511 is 38.2 fib from 5.8 to 11.7. 

3.  11700 super resistance of double tops.

Not sure if it's meaningful, but thought the complementary information is interesting.

Also I don't necessarily have faith in fibs and don't draw them as often anymore, but thought before it's interesting they match these zones a bit.  And have a theory if other people are watching them and acted on them it might have an effect particularly if it's compounded with other things at the same levels, more aggregate unified behavior.

(there are 2 additional spots in my notes: 10311 Strong resistance, some support.
Also near 23.6% fib 5.8->11.7; and 8413 resistance and some support on bouncing wicks; )
Thanks for the summary, that was what I had in mind as well. What's your opinion for the support levels going downward?

8100 could show a little bit of strength as resistance turned support (although we fell right through it on the dum from 8.4).

7800 obviously, as the ground level of chop city. 4

I'm not that convinced about 7500 being strong, only tested once as a resistance in the past few weeks.

And the big one that needs to hold: 7100-7250. We strongly bounced there in mid march and it served as a pretty strong resistance the first two weeks of april.

Thoughts?


You could try a voice reading out "you are losing money, you are losing money".
That's not good for you. Health > weatlh my friend. Get some sleep. Better to lose a trade than torturing your body. Or get out of position before bedtime. 
if bitcoin does not sleep, why should you?
The drop was a correction.  Everything is overvalued.  This is a potential return to mania.  (I won't complain if we go back to full blown semi-sustained crypto mania)
I was commenting on the second paragraph that you've now deleted the majority of and saying that your reasoning for saying it's going to dump 60% (people here are too overconfident) isn't exactly the best evidence you could provide.

Taking a break since the BGD. Fucked up a few trades and needed to take a break from bitcoin. Wrecked my short. Still a massive profitable position but lost a lot of profits. Ideally would've closed it at $7.4k but a few factors meant I wouldn't close it til higher...

had me upset and tilted for a bit and am just enjoying my life with less bitcoin lately.

I am in a very small short from $8400 now. Considering adding here but am being patient and seeing if it gets to $8.7-$9k, where I will add and then close if it breaks $9.2k or has trouble falling much further. 
Triangle arbitration (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/triangulararbitrage.asp) definitely has some effect as in an illiquid and more interconnected market those opportunities arise fairly often. But it's not like selling 100 eth for BTC causes an increase in the USD price of BTC equivalent to a buy for whatever 100 eth is worth in USD, it's a much smaller effect.
It's based on demand. The same reason that when BTC goes into alts, the alt's ratio goes up. If the opposite occurs, and more people want to go into BTC, then BTC's ratio against the alts will rise, and subsequently, its USD price will rise as well. The alt/BTC and BTC/USD ratios are not mutually exclusive.
But why does it reduce supply on the fiat side? You're being illogical.

If I want to sell 100 BTC for fiat (supply), I'm not going to turn around and decide nah I'm gonna buy an alt with it instead. That's like, the opposite of what I'm trying to do by moving to fiat.

And even if we do pretend the BTC available for trading to fiat is the same BTC available for trading to alts (same supply), then why is it suddenly NOT supply for fiat once it gets traded for alts? It's still BTC.
This market has been manipulated up and manipulated down, so what's the big deal. It's not going to all of a sudden become organic once/if it hits your buy point. It will take manipulation to get there.
> The last 24 hours has seen a lot of attempts down with bounces back up again and quickly too.

That is certainly the case. 

What I am thinking is that it wouldn't take long even with these bounces to turn the market in the downward direction. I hope it doesn't happen in the first place, and, welcome to the bulls club! :)
I’m betting on mid $7k as the lowest also. If we go below $7k then I think we re in a world of hurt for a while. This is do or die for for bulls as far as I see it. 
Fair enough, work over trading!
> all-too-familiar bitcoin reaction: I closed my long, it starts rising shortly thereafter.

I hate this. lol.


Highly recommend hodling those tethers until at least the market has a clear direction.

I am sure your gut feeling was one way or another influenced with your past experience. Or you could simply have been lucky. Either ways, that is a good trade.

I too have made totally irrational decisions in the past at times, mostly when the candles appear. They somehow block my cognitive abilities apart from the fear of loosing, or fear of missing. 
Thanks!
It becomes a transaction once it's mined in a block. I don't know what you are talking to be honest. 

EDIT: Also if you soften the raw data points in your chart as a moving average, it's also trending up. 

EDIT2: What's more, the charts as moving averages, look exactly the same.

Market will soon bullish , institutional money is about to pump in , more money for us to make 
I find it really hard to believe that last year's price action was "largely" driven by advertisements for ICOs. This is a ridiculous post.
Localbitcoin volume is down. And, that is really quite bearish considering 1.5 billion people recently lost the ability to purchase / sell bitcoin via a bank transfer to an exchange

Here is a chart of USD volume: https://coin.dance/volume/localbitcoins/ALL

You would have expected this to 2x considering so many people just lost the ability to transact in bitcoin in any other way, but instead we see declines the last weeks.
It's Good for Bitcoin that there are less searches for it..also that China and India banned it.  If 3 billion people can't buy BTC, that is good for Bitcoin and crypto in general.

agree
yea I agree that is why I said "BS for predicting the price" 
thats 4 regularly priced tuna subs, not even the 5$ footlong special. Im ruined
*stares into Patron top*
All that time to close the short sub 7k. I guess greed really does exist. Sorry about that man. 

Anything between 8250-8400 seems likr a decent entry. 

If 8500 breaks god knows what will happen. Welcome back. 
well ofc it can go to 2k , it can go from 0 to any number, how realistic that number  is is what matters, many bears were certain that it was gonna dump much harder, im not saying being a bear is something wrong im just saying that in here the most people we see is doom bears and rational traders, i almost never seen moon boys in here 
I really respect your opinion but 2k seems really unlikely to me.  We’d need some unforeseen catastrophe for 2k, IMO.  
Depends on what you mean by many.  But there were definitely more than a few.  


I was thinking the same with a market stop at 8350. Thanks for your input.
ok, got it.
Isn't a risky move ? What if a hidden order of 5000 BTC comes and sells the order book?
That's exactly my point. That a group of individuals can have such a pronounced impact is scary...and tells me we can go doesn't just as fast as we've come up. 
Can you let the rest of us know? 
Hard to ignore it. Thanks for posting your thoughts.
Shit was absolutely ridiculous. Anyone long must have been squirting their pants the whole way up 
Just to clarify, you're closing your long to step into a short? 

I'm hedged, slowpoke style since $8,888 a month ago. (Which speaks to my garbage tier trading)
What am i looking at 
Aaah okay.. thanks man! 
GDAX is leading the price (slightly, but was dragging since 11.7) and there are much more real (non-round) amounts. Also look at BCH.

Either whales will fuck fomoers in the ass, or they'll profit from it.
If you are a millionare, and go 1x leverage with tight stops, yes.

If you are a gambler, you put a few bucks, with 100x leverage, and there you go, 50% profit in 20 seconds. 
total margin
It has been between 0-20k for a decade, safest asset ever
Downtrend line hits 8K on 4/30, so I'd wager we won't make it a whole month, but wouldn't it be just like BTC to ignore all expectations and simply do absolutely nothing violent and just meander around as the line drops past us? 
I think the responder's point is that you are pointing out something that has nothing to do with exchange policies. It is pure mathematics.
You are thinking bitcoin is a currency which is cute, but quaint. Bitcoin is a speculative tool and in that it's adoption is very very high.
The ability to change your mind (and your position) at any time is arguably the only thing separating day trading from straight up gambling.

If you'v ever played blackjack, a stop loss is essentially an insurance bet when the dealer is showing an Ace. It's an opportunity for you to turn a potentially shitty situation into a guaranteed meh situation.
Aside from stop losses, I never place trigger orders ahead of time. Because I want to see how the market is reacting to certain activity before I make a decision. 

Because what if the market breaks $8,500 but immediately falls back below $8,300? If I was actively monitoring the trade, I'd be able to abandon ship in that scenario. But you don't have that luxury if you take the "set it and forget it" approach. 

Same goes for $7,800. If some whale with deep pockets market sells a few thousand coins to get the market down to $7,700, and it's immediately bought back up to $8000+, I'd want nothing to do with a short from $7,770. 

I would always advise using trigger orders to protect your trading account balance and/or protect profits. But I would never advise them for entering into fresh positions. 
...almost every single time I have seen a "warning" like this from a user that's currently in profit on their trade, it ends up going the other way. 

You sound like the bottom shorters at $6.7k

None of your post is unemotional or objective. You made 1 call that turned out to be right and think you're a God at predicting market movements now. Wow, never seen that before. 

What other calls have you made? Did you keep calling the bottom all the way down from $12k? I'm going to guess you did 
Yea i liked him a lot. Sucks he's gone. if I start posting a lot again I will ask the mods to unban probably but I'm not as active lately and dunno if I will be again so I'm not sure I care 
BTC wasn't even on my radar until late Q2 of last year, but that's the first thing that came to mind...how much money I spent on my wedding in 2015, and if only I would have known about Bitcoin back then.
lol
let go and let god
I was scared when I shorted 11.4k and it went to 11.8k last time
Yeah 50-75$ in the big scheme if it breaks down what’s the big difference.

I managed to score a short at 8296 lol
I personally feel the odds of 3% down here are way higher than 3% up. However, I'm the first to admit I haven't been on a hot streak, and chewy (who has), is long from 8130 with stops under 8K and no specific target. 

You can't go broke taking profits, though, and I'd be surprised to see us leg up hard any higher than 8320 after whatever stupid wick occurs (8400?)

I'm not at all happy with my current positions, but I have orders/stops in place to get me where I want to be, assuming we leg down to the 8000-8150 range again before continuing to climb, or break down very hard. I'll be in the worst shape if we BGC up through the resistance line (where my catastrophic stop on the short is)
You could at least just put in a tight stop and then let the cards fall where they may. If you sell outright and that's immediately followed by a massive green candle... well, you know how that feels.
Well-scaled entry at great leverage. Couldn't have played that better with the info we had, regardless how this goes. Where (if you are) are you bailing if it breaks up?
It's attracting new users every day. I just paid somebody in Bitcoin a few weeks ago. They were delighted at the simplicity of the transaction and proud to own.

What no-coiners do not understand is the value proposition: easier, more trustworthy money that moves faster and more cheaply without paying middleman bankster parasites money for nothing or giving them data to pimp. Use Bitcoin once, and the future unfolds before you.
Of course we are, I myself do this. But reporting these in real time here will gain you more rep perhaps. Let me find my long for you if you will.

Don't be ignorant :D
I never said that it was going to dump 60% because people are overconfident.  I didn't delete anything about my reasoning for coming up with 60%.  You are perhaps reading what you are desperate to see, rather than what I wrote.    

And one can't provide "evidence" for a prediction of an event in the future.  How much more confused can you be.  Good luck...you sure need it.
yes. I watch TV all day and have seen almost every show. I neglected Grey’s since the gf and I broke up. Today’s a good day for some doctor drama
No, it has exactly the same effect. Doesn't matter if you're buying $1000 worth of BTC with ETH, USD or EUR; you're still buying $1000 worth of BTC.

All BTC markets are connected. Same supply.
Nope, if people want to go into BTC from alts, the alt/BTC ratio will drop but other than triangle arbitration the BTC/USD ratio remains unaffected because no coins we're exchanged there.
The effect comes from arbitrage. He's right.
I'm saying *if* not all of it hits the order book for fiat after it is exchanged for the alt then it's not all supply for fiat.

Supply at any one moment is what sellers are ready to sell/exchange for something else. Some portion of that will be available for fiat sales and some for alts at that moment, but the amount available to each will shift around based on demand. To believe that this is only controlled by the logic of careful arbitrage decisions is, to me, naive.

Let's take our original ETH-BTC example again, and let's think about this in terms of what people actually do, rather than pure logic (which is what is implied in the triangle arb-only model): 

1) Mary buys ETH 'cheap' for either BTC or fiat and it starts to FOMO, with both fiat and BTC price rising.

2) Bob is a BTC miner. The fiat price isn't moving much but he's watching the ETH chart and damn it all if it isn't FOMOing. Bob begins to mutter under his breath to himself about what a sucker he is.

3) Exchange is providing the normal order book. This exchange has a total of three customers - Bob, Mary, and Pat.

4) Pat just got a fiat paycheck and would like to invest in some BTC. Normally Bob would be selling a bit for fiat every day but he's distracted by what's going on over in ETH.

5) Mary is getting nervous. ETH as priced in fiat is beginning to come down and she wants to preserve her gains. She needs to sell and sell now.

6) Bob sees his opportunity to get into ETH for a discount so he can get in on the FOMO action. He jacks up the price in BTC. Mary bites.

7) Mary is a little lazy (or doesn't trust Tether) and doesn't place an order to sell all of her BTC for fiat right away. And now she's holding BTC.

8) Meanwhile, Pat's order is sitting only partially filled. Pat starts raising the bid until it finally catches Bob or Mary's attention again and they become willing to sell.

You can call this triangle arb if you want; but in my opinion, doing so assumes that each player is actually performing arbitrage calculations, and I in no way see that as being the case. Arb implies some single player is making logical decisions based on price differences, but that's not what is happening in the scenario above.

Edit: formatting
The difference is that when its down it is consistent with the real market sentiment. When it is up it is against real market sentiment. So, when pumpers bull it up 30% it becomes much riskier.

Real market sentiment can be determined by exchange site traffic, google trends, the number of people who can actually send money to an exchange via  bank transfer, on-block chain transactions, etc. All these things are down huge. The only thing not down is the number of tethers that have been printed and the pump groups.

You can even use proxies, such as the bullishness of the stock market "crypto companies" which have lost 90% of their value. So, in less manipulated markets we see the huge premiums evaporate, but it persists in the more manipulated market. Do the math.
I can't seem to find the missing puzzle here in this market. uhh.
Yes gut feelings also and I want to make sure everytime I tether up I take some profit out to pay future taxes. In a confirmed bullrun I will let profits ride but I am not certain at this moment and I don't want to gamble anymore than I can tolerate. I don't really FOMO much anymore over selling too early as I try to stick with my plan. As much as I enjoy this alt run, something smells fishy to me. I get they pretty much bottomed out SAT value I don't feel good about the sudden strong recovery.

I am curious as to why you think selling tethering up was a good idea. I mean I hope I am right but so far it has not been the best decision thus far. I ask because I only went by my instinct and nothing else.
The graph you showed me is not transactions in the blockchain. It is anything broacasted to the mempool. Do you understand the difference? Look here for transactions: https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactions.html#3m

You can see it is just noise. Just 10 days ago it hit a multi-year low. It is still lower today than it was 5 days ago. There is no new trend.
It was driven by new entrants. New entrants that became aware and convinced to get into crypto via bombardment of ads literally everywhere.
Transactions are way up. 25% in one month. USD volume has gone sideways. The price has gone sideways. USD volume has moved in proportion with the change in price.

Also, the data you are posting is a week old at this point.

What these data show me is that localBitcoins will buy the same amount of Bitcoin no matter what the price is.
I made a ninja edit.
My friend, we live to fight another (sub of the) day.
To be fair I tried to close $7.4k and fucked it up. 

I didn't mind losing profit until there but...it was late and bitmex ui sucks and i panicked...lol

But yes, it was entirely greed, although greed is what allowed me to hold it to there in the first place. 
there really weren't that many people calling for $2k...
$2k seems unlikely to me, too, but there's nothing in particular barring it from happening again. it really isn't unprecedented or crazy to think it could happen. If we're still above $6k in 3 months I'd say it's incredibly unlikely, though. 
Not saying it's not risky. 
Yep.  It can go down just as fast as it went up...it’s been doing it for months.  Were you under the impression you were trading US treasury bonds?
I'm assuming that since we're using acronyms for them now, that saying the actual words is likely not allowed.

I'm not actually closing my long yet. I'm long on June futures, short swaps. Been short 8100 since before the long. I don't generally like taking opposite positions, but I'm holding my long as insurance in case we BGC up here (low probability). I have no cold storage, so it's sort of playing that role currently. 
That's called a chart!
It's actually 300 contracts on 10x margin buddy. Already got my tuna sub out of it from that retrace. 


I wasn't suggesting that we'll stay in this range for another three weeks. I sincerely doubt we will.

I meant that we're still only 1/4th of the way to, "this is one of the longest periods of stability bitcoin has ever seen."
Thanks, you don't have to be mean about it :(
Guaranteed Meh^^tm

Should be the official slogan of daytrading crypto.
Yeah. I've been checking in less and less, though I lurk in the slack pretty much all day now. 

I'm about to be without service for about 10 days, and I'm long basically everything on mex right now.  Thinking I'll set some stops at breakeven, and pray I come back a millionaire.
I'm going to cancel my wedding then.
2020 can wait!
Relatively speaking for the current range, nice.
True but I’m also sick of long wicks that quickly climb back up. I do agree that this rising wedge calls for a tight SL though. 
Stops at 8465 but may change to 8515 just Incase. 

I also have a small long buy set up for 8505 for a giant run 
I am not a nocoiner. I am also not delusional. Bitcoin on-chain transactions are at 2 year lows, so what you said is obviously false. People are not using it. They are speculating on it, which is very different.

Most people like things like 30 day interest-free loan, chargeback protection, and free transactions. That is better than no free loan, consumer-paid for transactions, and no chargeback or fraud protection.

Most people don't want to think about the 17 steps it takes to secure bitcoin. They just want to something that is easy and fast. And, my arguments have evidence behind them, which is the declining use of the bitcoin network.
I definitely understand that but it would be more helpful in general if people saw my original post as it was intended. I could have just not mentioned my entry and this discussion would be completely different even if the content is the same but void of an entry price to the strategy that was posted.

Getting chased by giant red dildos 🤔
I've often considered biphasic and polyphasic sleep but I don't think I've got the mental strength to get through the initial slog of getting myself into that pattern. Has it improved your productivty noticeably?
Hey another polyphasic sleeper! Figured there had to be a few of us that trade crypto 😂
Then why do you think there's a 60% chance it will dump? It's not helpful to the OP to give an answer without him being able to evaluate if it's solid reasoning or not.

And evidence would be TA or FA.

I'm leaning bearish too (just check my post history).
Prove it with math how buying $1000 worth of BTC with ETH translates to buying $1000 worth of BTC with USD then.

I guarantee you can't. They're separate markets, though interconnected and do certainly effect one another (arbitration).

What you're saying is the same as saying that buying $1M worth of USD with Yen has the same effect on the USD ratio with the Euro as buying $1M USD with the Euro, which is just plain wrong. The only direct effect is with the exchange rate you're trading on.
Yes, I know there's triangle arbitrage. I think I've been clear about that.

Arbitrage isn't what he's talking about.
Thanks for the write-up, but honestly I think you're thinking too hard about it. I'm saying there's no direct mathematical way in which ETH/BTC trading effects BTC/USD price (again, other than direct bot arbitration). You're getting in to subjective/sentimental analysis and we can go in circles all day about it. You're making too many assumptions about how the market "feels" to actually prove anything.

For instance, not every miner is going to be like Bob. Some miners that were initially planning on trading their mined coin to ETH might see how much ETH has rose and decide to wait for awhile or sell directly for BTC instead. Maybe most miners don't even look at other prices and automatically sell everything they mine for fiat to pay the bills and never trade for ETH. Maybe Mary does immediately sell for fiat for some reason. Maybe Pat, seeing the ETH action and it starting to dip back, decides to buy the dip there instead of his usual BTC buy. Maybe maybe maybe maybe......

When you start going down that road any number of options arise. I was talking about non subjective analysis.
Going down that far will require a push from major fud, which frankly is just another tool whales use to manipulate us. I'm 50/50 on sub $2k, 75% expecting $3500, 99% expecting 4200 by September
It's possible but somewhat unlikely due to mining costs; but if it happens and stays down for any length of time (2 months+) the whole network could start to unravel as effectively all mining becomes unprofitable and miners start shutting down. This could actually be a sort of death spiral were it to occur.

Thanks. Been looking for this definition

I was just playing.

I think you are a nice person, but sometimes I just wonder why you put on such a sherade
Oh, yes, that's silly. As far as I'm concerned, we shouldn't poke the beast. Careful what you wish for, right? 
If you're going to go over 8450, I'd just go to 8515. 6-month support-turned-resistance is at 8480 (purple), which is where I'd expect a wick to if we BGC: https://www.tradingview.com/x/cOPoSBRP/  

Also not sure I'd ever recommend a stop buy, but that's up to you.

TA is not evidence for the prediction of something in the future.  There's no such thing as evidence for a prediction of anything in the future.

We live in different world, so good luck in yours.  I'll stick to this oen.
I think he is, implicitly (perhaps even without realizing it).
There was no FUD to push down the price to $150 in 2015, afaik. If it was gox coins, well, we still got those. 
I agree, this does seem possible.
Price of btc dictates mining profitability and activity, not the other way around. When it becomes too expensive, difficulty decreases but only the most efficient miners stick around. 

bitcoin mining was profitable at $100. Why not $2000? 
Sadly you can’t edit a stop loss on Kraken. I have to just ride it out 
Cheers mate and good call. Let’s see how far up we can go
That must be hard to maintain though? Just at the practical level of structuring your day/work activities around your sleep schedule
Okay, so where does your 60% come from? A magic 8 ball? 

I don't think you understand what TA is or should be used for. It's not a tool to predict the future, it's a tool to help try and give you a *probability* of the market behaving a certain way, often contingent upon something else occuring. And it helps identify key resistances and supports levels.

TA is the market equivalent of you rolling two dice and me telling you there's a 1/36 chance you get snake eyes.
Could you explain? I'm really not understanding the link between what he says and triangle arb.
It doesn't even have to be considered arb. It's simple supply and demand for the coin, coming from two places. You can call it arb when someone/somebot makes the decision to trade one coin for the other because they calculate that they can get a better fiat price for one than the other; but that's not what's motivating a lot of the players in the market to make the moves they are making.
good bot.
The only way it can be profitable at $2000 is for most of the miners to quit. If most of the miners quit, the robustness of the network decreases. This is not really what you want to have happen to the network - this is what I mean by death spiral. At $100 it was a much smaller network without the power draw and hashing power.
Seriously? That seems like a massive oversight. Yeesh. Well, good luck. You'll probably be okay. 
Kraken support here.  When websockets come in that may change, but as of now you would need to cancel and replace the order if you want to change.  If you need assistance, please file a ticket at: support.kraken.com
I will just sleep whenever I feel like it. If I have meetings/plans, Ill power through. Works fine
