[Daily Discussion] Tuesday, April 10, 2018 -- TITLE
#New post: [\[Daily Discussion\] Wednesday, April 11, 2018 →](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8beaek/daily_discussion_wednesday_april_11_2018/)
Wanted to throw up what my current view of the market is. A lot of its similar to what others are showing. This will probably be the longest post I've ever done so buckle in.

Album I'll be referencing this whole post: https://imgur.com/a/Q5fG2

So the first chart is on the logarithmic day chart (BFX). I have two descending triangles drawn; it's worth noting some may interpret it as a symmetric triangle. That said, the larger one is the largest formation I'm currently looking at. If it breaks down, a fair target would be maybe 5k before reevaluating. Per pattern rules it would have an eventual target of 2-2.5k but I'm of the mind that with the such heavy support likely in that range it may never get there. I also think that the support is so strong in this area because of the presence of that line, we were probably even dealing with that band around 6.6k. This support closely connects the November correction, the 6k flash crash, and the previous 6.4k low. Even the October correction only wicked it.

Still, based on the number of times we've dipped down to this area now (also see: number of shorts opening, longs closing), bears are really trying to break this down *right this second*. That time frame is more in line with the current resistance line since 9k, which is currently around 7.2k.

So does this break down right now (would be incredibly bearish)? I'm not so sure. Moving to chart two, we can see bearish divergence (purple) on the hourly that clearly indicated the massive drop. However, with the most recent bottom we've formed a hidden bullish divergence. Now, normal divergence is used to indicate a reversal and hidden to indicate continuation. That would only be true if we were in an uptrend and, given the higher lows since the flash crash to 6.4k, we may be in one on shorter time frames. So that's slightly bullish short term. That said, it's a small opportunity cost to wait until 7.2k breaks for good confirmation with the daily so I'm waiting for that before trusting this uptrend.

On the third chart, we’re looking at a more intermediate time frame with the 7.5k local high to the 7.2k local high. You can see a symmetric/descending triangle with a small bear flag (not terribly happy with how fit looks but still valid for now). The issue with this triangle is that the trend from 9k wedge will likely break before this one; however, it does provide confluence on a shorter time scale that 7.2k is significant resistance.

The flag is another reason I'm waiting on 7.2k to break. It obviously could break up but it still makes me hesitant and it could be a fine formation until 7k or so. Longing if that breaks up around 7k then is pretty high risk/low reward since we may just bang our heads off 7.2k again. More obvious confluence making 7.2 important, it also corresponds to the last local high and would confirm a double bottom if broken (possible double top if not). This support (6.5) and resistance (7.2) also closely corresponds with the 4 hr BBands.

If I were a margin trader (I’m not), I would probably be longing 7.2k and shorting 6.5k or below with stops depending on your confidence level and sitting out until then due to risk / reward. You could maybe start scaling in earlier if you lean a little bullish personally. That said, I’m currently sitting wholly (cold storage and all) in fiat after getting stopped out for a small gain in the low 7ks. Not buying back in until after 7.2k (broken record).

Now I’d like to mention some things I’ll be starting to look at once 7.2 or 6.5 breaks.

If we do go test 7.2k, say we break through. I could see us getting slight resistance at 7.5k (possible double top) that I don’t think would really turn us back around. We’d then test the 7.8k-8.2k area, a place that’s been a sticking point for sideways action and has also acted as a lot of support/resistance. I’d reevaluate there but I wouldn’t be surprised if we went up to test the large descending triangle resistance (the ATH log resistance) in the mid-upper 8ks.

If we don’t go test 7.2k, or do and get thrown back, it’s incredibly bearish. Would expect support at 6k from double bottom but compared to what we’d have just broken through I think the momentum would continue us through it. Maybe a technical bounce/some relief at 5.5k? Not sure, 5k would be fair as well (from what I said before). Would start to get interesting somewhere in there though. Daily RSI would go oversold, which never seems to last long so there’s that. Could throwback somewhere in 5k to go retest that support we broke and confirm it as resistance before continuing down.

That’s as far as I’m willing to project some decently likely scenarios (and in no way are they the only ways that this could go – it’s obviously an ongoing evaluation).

TL;DR: Long above 7.2k, Short below 6.5k. My position = currently fiat.
Still not trading, and really enjoying it. I think few traders appreciate the mental toll it takes on them. It's like you're a computer with 16 GB RAM but 8 GB is always consumed by trading. It seems okay but it makes other life tasks less enjoyable. If you think this isn't you, ask yourself, how many hours of the day go by where you aren't aware of the price? Other aspects of my life have considerably improved since taking my trading hiatus. It's hard to see when you're in it. Trading destroys mindfulness.

[Anyway, here's a chart showing current levels.](https://i.imgur.com/pFQjoRh.png)

A break above red would be pretty bullish. I don't think a break down out of the blue triangle would be terribly bad -- there's big support at 5600, some support (including psych) at 5000, and even bigger support at 4300, but 4300 seems far-fetched.

If you just look at the zoomed out shape, timing, and magnitude of the last two bubble crashes, we're just about due for some relief, whether that's a false break-out and DCB to 10-11k before more bear trend or sideways, or a resumption of the bull trend.

This "feels" like it could either play out as an Adam & Eve, or we could just be consolidating before one more shake-out. Hard to say ahead of time. If I had to guess, the cynical part of me is bracing for a hard dump to 5k then a fierce bounce.
## Moon Math Update

Accumulation looks like it might have started. The noob recommendation  may not get posted before there's a substantial recovery. BBands are still too wide. Personally, I'm still DCAing back in to my full position. Our moderate buy recommendation is still in place.

If BBands never tighten then a strong buy recommendation will not be issued and there will be no noob DCA strategy published. It's been months since I promised to publish that. From the looks of these 12 hour BBands I think we can expect some kind of major price adjustment. That means volatility will remain too high to issue a strong buy recommendation early this year.

Point and Figure  https://i.imgur.com/CnqCmww.png  We have confirmed a column of 8 O's.  The only outstanding 50% long pole retrace for 2018 is from March 27.  A retrace of the March 27 long pole would bring us above $8,173.

We are due for a large break out:  Here is a graph of the column heights over the last 70 days: https://i.imgur.com/XrSjwkt.png  Our columns have been getting smaller and smaller for about 2 weeks now, as you can see from the black line.  This tells me we are due for a larger break out move soon.  Looking at the full 70 days, we have also seen a decrease in pole length.  This corresponds with a decrease in volume and a wedge forming on daily timeframe.  That may come as a relief to those of you who have been getting chopped up for the last 1-2 months.

Daily Chart https://www.tradingview.com/x/KzOHuQXN/  Sorry there is quite a lot going on here.  Let me point out some things:  **1.**  We are forming a very large wedge, and seeing a decrease to our previously large range.  **2.** Margin longs are down and margin shorts are up.  This is finally back to November 2017 levels.  But price is holding above the November 2017 price.  A lot of people see too many margin longs as an indicator that we are overbought and need to correct downward, so it is nice to see this level out again.  **3.**  Major support is at 4000-4200 and at 5800-6300.  **4.**  Major resistance is at 8100-8900.

Daily RSI Bull Div on 4/7  https://www.tradingview.com/x/fuSodWFT/  Yes, it is 3 days past, but this bull div gives some hope to the bulls.  Arguably it has not completely played out nor has it been invalidated.

My thoughts:  More sideways here would be bullish.  I also really like the 1 day bull div and the Long:Short ratio finally improving.  If we don't make new lower lows, I will slowly become more bullish.  But until this happens the play here is a short, either when we break through to new lows or short off major resistance (which is very far away).
Bitfinex just announced they are going down for maintenance tomorrow. Meanwhile the number of shorts on their site is at an ATH. I wonder what would happen if the price of BTC rises dramatically tomorrow while BFX is down?
Long at $6727......
Reinforcing what I said couple of days ago - I'd be bearish if it weren't for 36k shorts open on Bitfinex. Holy sh!t, it just keeps growing. Just 1/3 of those shorts can wipe out the whole ask side of the orderbook, obviously it won't happen, but it shows the lack of liquidity and cascading margin liquidation is just a sneeze away. I'm also certain that some of those shorts are "hedged" positions to cover people's cold storage, however they'll have to claim or close those shorts anyway and not everyone will be able to do that if things turn ugly for bears. Plenty of time to open scalp short if things go down, but reversal should be explosive at this point, especially if 8k breaks. Still in a medium sized long position here... which means I'm biased and take my words with a pinch of salt.

I'm also keeping an eye on stock market as it's not looking good and continued dropping would certainly remove some money from cryptos.
Paging through my wyckoff materials (from a course a friend shared with me), this pattern seems to match:

["Reaccumulation After Decline"](https://i.imgur.com/tXoJl0q.png)

If we are in the reaccumulation range, there are a few ways it could resolve (see above image for diagrams).
38k shorts now. This will end well.
Went long at 6728, went to sleep at 6728, woke up to 6728, came out of the shower to 6728. What a life!
Lsst time the 1h bbands were this tight was on the 25.3., something big is brewing i think. 
Closed my short at around $6,750 for a pretty decent profit. I opened it at $7,100. 

Edit: just not certain which way this is going to go in the short-term, and I'm fine opening a short again below 6400 if this breaks down. But don't want to be in the way if it breaks up.
Been giving the George Soros event a bit of thought and a hypothesis is beginning to form..  

Some 30,000 ft ideology of Soros’s investment philosophy:  

He runs  for the most part a macro hedge fund, making macro bets on assets & currencies.  

He enters relatively early in the market cycle of the event he expects to unfold.  

Typically these opportunities are against major market sentiments i.e when the market is focused on A, he uncovers B which is overlooked.  

He at times combines multiple assets/ currencies in a trade. Eg: Shorting Japanese yen while going long Japanese equities (circa 2012). 

Most importantly, he enters only when there is an expectation of a major market movement (no short term trades). That is the asset/ currency will either collapse or take off.  

Now with respect to Crypto, his ideology would give the following clues:  

If he’s entering now (and not at the peak) with a short, what is unlikely is that we will go down to an expected level (say 5k). Reason? Most of the crash would be over and done with, doesn’t tie into his strategy. What is more likely is that he would expect prices to collapse from here (not what we want to hear…but sub 1k for sure). 
 

He could, conversely be looking at this as a macro play..most of the global markets don’t take crypto seriously and are dismissive (hence a contra play), and would be caught by surprise if we do see a 200k BTC price= big pay day for him.  

Further, he may build a trade using BTC if for example, he’s bearish on global markets or expects a devastating global trade war, he could short equities while longing BTC.

One could delve deeper to uncover further possible trades in line with his investment philosophy..above is just a thought experiment as of now. 

Here's my [chart](https://imgur.com/Rc7b2z0), officially the second one I've submitted. Shows the downward channel and a possible floor. Looks like consolidation primed to go either way in approximately five-six days.
We have climbed to 37k shorts on Bitfinex alone.

I frequent this sub mostly lurking and I sat out of crypto from mid-January until this last week and a half. When I first got in (late october 2017) I had a pretty solid strategy for accumulating more bitcoin by trading the litecoin ratio. I rode the bull wave up in litecoin and made some outsized gains like everyone else in December only to see it plummet once I started trading alts in an emotional panic. It was a hard learning experience and I was lucky in that I didn't dump my capital all in at once. So now I've returned (the prodigal son?) and am exclusively trading in ETH. I use bitcoin chart action to help guide my decision making with ETH movement and am doing my best to accumulate more ETH or at least maintain my stack (very minimal trading maybe one to three times per week). How many of you utilize bitcoin movement to inform your decision making for ETH? I've really made a concerted effort to ignore all of the news and operate strictly off of the chart action I'm seeing as well as the underlining volume and established trend. I thoroughly enjoy the discussion on this sub and the transparency that some utilize when trying to formulate their trading strategy. I hope to continue to grow and utilize my stock market experience to help me grow in the crypto market place. Happy Tuesday everyone. 
Bittrex just started accepting registrations again!!

Volume is so horribly low
Sp500 back to late Nov 2017 levels!
BTC back to late Nov 2017 Levels!
When the triangle breaks one way or another, there’s going to be a lot of “i told you so’s”
this is so boring.

Long @6740. Stops at sub 6400. No leverage. Good old buy and sell
Been very busy of late and haven't been able to maintain discipline on my daily analysis. It sucks as I've had a nice long open for a while now which I would have liked to close yesterday at the channel resistance. I'm not mad tho, as it's still ITM, it hit a few take profit limit orders and there's been some juicy funding of course.

It's all sideways action anyway. There's a weak bullish cross due on the 6h and thinning cloud, but recent attempts to get anywhere near 7.5k show that this is little to be excited about. According to the chikou, it could go either way. but the cloud immediately above now is thick, thick, thick!

6h: https://www.tradingview.com/x/ErY4n0VK

The view from upstairs is the same, so there is potential for a change as we move forward and barring any further downside. The chikou is trailing its 6h counterpart, but looks headed to mingle with the chop of the last week or so. The longer we do go sideways, the more likely this is to bottom out here and the bullish targets are already dropping below 8k for month end.

12h: https://www.tradingview.com/x/O5h5Q4he

The window of opportunity is still wide open on the daily. With downside momentum also petering out, with the tenkan and kijun lines turning to the horizontal and the chikou bottoming out, there's probably a lot of eyes on the prize rn, which is still 9k. The kumo seems to have stopped thickening, but I doesn't look like it'll twist again until late May or later. 

1d: https://www.tradingview.com/x/eAqXRFIp

With all this I'm neutral. I've made a couple of trades recently (including the current) both long and I managed to take profit with about 30% of the trade size only to close out the rest OTM, so I'm aware that the bearishness is far from behind us, but the continued lack of further downside cannot be discounted.

TL;DR: lately, when I see BTC anywhere near 6.5k I just knee-jerk buy.
Its quite interesting to compare the 2013/14 bubble with the 2017/18 bubble:

[https://imgur.com/a/Cs6MJ](https://imgur.com/a/Cs6MJ)

A period of low volatility also occured after a drop to around 35&#37; of the ATH and lasted than \(with one down\- and one upspike\) till mid of Mai. The drop to this price level was almost at the same day in the year \(24th vs. 26th of March\). Check the chart to see what happend afterwards. As the bubble popping lasted much longer in 2013/14 the stabe phase lasted longer. Hence, if we follow more or less the same pattern I expect the phase of low volatility will last less in 2018.
Closed my long (from 6999) at 6830 and opened a short.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/vLvRjsHu/
I got squeezed by this baby whale pump.  Stops put me in at 6830.  I do not feel good about this one.  It feels like the stop hunters found me.  Short set at 6782.
Everyone is completely convinced we're going to explode upwards from here. can even see the bears doubting themselves.

Will it be a self fulfilling prophecy or are we all waiting for buyers that won't show up? 

Majority here is absolutely convinced that this is the bottom and the people FOMO shorting will get rekt. 

All of the talk about people shorting getting rekt reminds me of the talk about people buying at $8-9k on the way up getting rekt. *Sooo* much confidence from contrarians who believe the trend is going to reverse

It surely could, and I really think it has a decent chance here, but the overwhelmingly bearish sentiment has shifted to mildly/moderately bullish, with virtually everyone expecting shorts to get rekt. 

Whatever happens from here should be very interesting at least.

I really do think sometimes that when this sub overwhelmingly agrees on something, the opposite tends to happen. It'll be very fun to see what happens and if that little theory holds true

I don't think this is a great reason to short or hold open a short, but I find it interesting either way and it's something that's definitely curious. 

This price range was devastating to us a few weeks ago and now we're completely accustomed to it.

I find myself really truly thinking this is very possibly the bottom a lot lately and it makes me wonder if this kind of thinking will result in an explosion upwards or a terrible failure of a pump that leads to disappointment and more selling? 

Usually when this sub overwhelmingly agrees on something that flies in the face of what seems obvious on the charts is when the sub is pretty wrong
eth has been leading the way it seems and we're not getting any movement
I would really appreciate it if somebody could describe a bullish case that doesn't involve short/long ratios.
Can anybody point me to an article that predicts an ongoing bear market through summer 2018? All I can find for bearish articles is one guy saying it's gonna be bearish with no Reasoning, and someone writing fluffy crap around that one quote to meet a word count quota. 

I've found a few that give reasons for a bull market, but it's the usual "event that is happening that will lead to more fiat coming in". The whole tax season ending thing comes to mind. However, we had similar periods recently that didn't result in anything good. Look at the "wall street bonuses" being spent on crypto back in January, that was a dud. That's why I think this whole tax thing is a crock.

I just want to read about technical reasons why a bear market could last 6+ months. I don't day trade, and I'm more Interested in long term trends. 

My gut tells me that since an overwhelming amount of bulls believe the bull run will start this summer, that the opposite of a  confirmation bias will occur and nothing will happen, which will panic bulls and send this market into a year long bear.

I would love for a bull run to fire off this summer, but I am very skeptical, I would say I am legitimately bearish. I do like to read both sides of the spectrum though.

So basically, anything that you can suggest for good reading regarding why this bear market is here to stay for the next 6+ months?

Anyone else watching this triangle?

and this triangle?
https://imgur.com/uQfJuKF

Well that drop was a nice kick in the dick. I got stopped out at 6790 for a small profit. 

I still think we should move up to ~7100, but I'm going to stay on the sidelines until likely we get past the current trend intersection. Sitting 50/50 fiat/btc atm.
Based on [my chart from last night](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8b4twg/daily_discussion_tuesday_april_10_2018/dx4502r/), I've built out a Bull Range/Bear Range based on dates and long-term support from the dip/bounce on 10/18/17. Within seven days, we should know which way the market is heading.

I've updated the chart and am properly publishing it through tradingview...     
Here's the [zoomed out, macro version](https://www.tradingview.com/x/piECGM3W/).     
Here's the [channel we're in now](https://www.tradingview.com/x/yfSAV3iy/).     
Here's the [bull/bear range](https://www.tradingview.com/x/HUbqUzER/).     

For the Bull Range, any sustained movement north of that number will mean we are trading above the channel, indicating a possible reversal into a sideways/bull market.     

For the Bear Range, any sustained movement south of that number will mean we are trading below the channel, indicating a possible continuance of the bear market.     

Here are the numbers:     

Date/Time|Bull Max|Bear Min
:--|:-:|:-:
04/12/18 00:00:00|$7027|$6505
04/13/18 00:00:00|$6933|$6514
04/14/18 00:00:00|$6839|$6523

my wife has had the coinbase app for a couple years now. she just bought a bunch of Bitcoin. she hates when I buy Bitcoin. bullish?
STICK 👏TO 👏YOUR 👏MOTHER 👏FUCKING 👏 PLANS 👏IF 👏THE 👏PLAN 👏IS 👏SOLID

lol I longed the absolute bottom yesterday but got spooked by spoofy and how violent ydays dump was and exited at breakeven. Would have hit my original target (6799) if i stuck to my plan and would have made 10 months fucking rent. Fuck me. You have to accept the risk of a loss in order to win. If you make good plans, youl win more then you will lose at the end of the day and thats what really matters.
With all these shorts open, though, I feel like we really are close to the bottom. Not because we'll rocket up from a short squeeze but if we drop 10% or more from here they'll start taking profits which will slow our fall. I can easily see us bouncing off of 6k if we have a major drop from here (remember, dropping to 6k from 6.8 is almost 12%). In fact, I think a low leverage long here is good risk/reward. It will put you in a position on the off chance a short squeeze happens and if it drops to 6k you'll have a lot left over to buy 6k hard and average your entry down. And if you are on mex you'll get some really nice funding right now.
The amount of shorts to longs is getting pretty intense now.
Still, I wouldn't base your trades on them but when the shorts get this high to longs ratio it would be wise to use as a supporting indicator as a move upwards can be explosive if fomo kicks in, safe trading everyone!
Just chiming in to say that if approximately 6.85k (maybe 6.9) holds then the bear flag on the 1/4 hr charts starts to look a lot more well formed.
I'm still waiting for the short squeeze. During that mini pump 700 new shorts were openend, not closing my long from 6720 for now. 
Doesn't matter if your outlook towards the market is bearish or bullish (terms that divide us), still there is one thing that unites us, which is the common goal to make profit.

I personally have a bullish outlook (I like the idea of prices going up rather than going down). But with time, we need to adapt. I learnt this by shorting and realized having a bearish outlook is just as same. If I feel the price is going to go down, I will adapt bearish outlook.

As I predicted previously (I have my reasons to believe), I think the price is going to go up. I have had 5 successful past closings all with leverages, first two shorts and then three longs, the current one being the sixth (caught up during the dip and impulse took over, opened a long at 8459) I am still a bit away from break even. I have already decided not to sell since I caught this up, and as of now, not for the next 3-6 hours at least based on the behavior of price unless something radical happens.

This is my outlook, what is yours? Are you bearish or bullish at this very moment (knowing the fact that the market has been bearish since 20K dip). Do you feel the price will go above 7300 this time and continue to do so until at least 10K?
Shorts are nearing 37k which I believe is an ATH for finex, and if demand doesn't pick up then they might be on the right side of the trade. 

Edit: more than 37k now.
So one of my favorite sentiment indicators "low thread comment count" acts out quite well today

Ethtrader  that usually is even more active only have 114, and this thread 195.

I call a bottom here, or at least (need to hedge  a bit in this crazy market XD) a pivot point
This recent price action gives me the strange feeling that the big players are slowly rounding up the bears in a corner, before springing the trap and slaughtering them. I can count at least twice where we have broken down from downtrend continuation patterns (once on 6th April from a symmetrical triangle on the 1hr, and today from a rising wedge on the 1hr), only to have the downward move stymied arbitrarily before a reversal. 

If you count yesterday's high volume dump from 7200 to 6600, that would make this three times where we have almost approached the critical price levels between 6k - 6.5k, only to have the selling pressure abruptly "switched off". 

It is a strange phenomenon from a bear's perspective, because as a big shorter, you would know that you could rely on a cascading wave of further selling (caused by stops being hit, liquidations of underwater longs, and breakout traders trading the price to the downside) if 6k is breached to make your short profitable. Why would sellers stop selling near 6.5k, when the momentum is clearly on their side? Buyers have also shown little strength (based on the volume of recent rallies), whereas sellers have shown yesterday that the market will allow them to knock the price down almost 10% in 1 hour with a simple "how do you do".

I am hesitant to call 6.5k the bottom, just because of the weak buying volume and the amount of time we have spent at these price levels, which suggests that buyers aren't very strong. On the other hand, I am open to the interpretation that large-scale accumulation is occurring at these price levels. I am already seeing signs of that occurring in majors like Eth, which may portend the same accumulation happening in BTC (since cryptomarkets generally move together). 

Looking to hear from the bulls and bears here (especially bears) on their thoughts regarding recent price movements.


I closed my half hedge short for a loss because the funding rates were unsustainable without being in healthy profit in the position and i have no idea why sellers keep taking us to the edge and then disappearing. 

Not sure about my next move right now. Maybe reenter at 7k
Well I was wrong. Called for sub 6k daily close tonight and it didn't happen. I'll eat some humble pie and stop setting such extremely specific timelines. Suffice to say I still believe we will close at 5xxx before we close 8xxx. If I'm wrong I lose a lot of BTC. Don't trade based on my predictions, I'm just outlining my medium term view of the market. 
Good morning Guys and Gals, lets take a look at the Bitcoin market at the start of this week.

One of the most dangerous occupations in the volatile crypto markets is “calling bottoms”.

With that said, it is impossible to enter new positions if we don’t look for the change in the trend, and the eventual breakout.

In my opinion the Bitcoin market has started a little bullish trend (and possible bottom) on the very short term, since the start of April.

The flip side to this coin is that there is also a bear flag in the short term to contradict the recent price action.

For me to remain bullish on the short term we need to stay above $6600 with good trading volume.

Short term resistance is around $6800 and I would expect the market to give some direction soon.

Should we fail to break the resistance and fall through the current near term support zone, I will look to the bearish side, a possible test of $6000 – $5500, and according to some analysts on YouTube much lower.

So far the market has responded well above the 6500 support zone and I will keep an eye on what happens should prices consolidate below this price level.

Should prices consolidate above the short term resistance, we will most likely see a quick retest of $7200 – $7600, and perhaps a push into the 8k zones. Fomo depending it could go much higher ofc.

I will post another report should we face a breakout situation.

[You can find the chart wizardry here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptosignals/)

Feel free to discuss this trade idea with me in Discord, safe trades.

BTC has been unusually stable in the last 10 days, stuck between 6500 & 7500.

I know you should not only base your trades on the short long ratio...but jesus..shorts rapidly increasing while price is more or less stable screams for MikeXBTs call to be the right one..

Still having my June futures long from 6645, and this little move was nice. However I just have this feeling that in this treacherous bear market, taking profits while you can is always a good thing.  

Putting stops quite close to what to me looks like a bull flag on 15m, still seems the market haven't decided for sure yet and do do horziontal level swing trading with bigger positions and less leverage (instead of opposite in trending markets) is the better thing here
Closed short at 6788. That funding cost isn't getting any better in the next 12 hours and this looks ripe for a squeeze. 
38300 shorts. Bears are about to be BRUTALISED. Of course unless this an insider trading whale, because in that case my long is going to get absolutely annihilated.

Is there a more active BTC dev subreddit out there? I searched, but didn't find any.
Being right above support and having so many bottom shorters the most obvious thing to do here is so to go long, however we have a descending triangle on the 4h. Plus whenever the funding for shorts is empty someone instantly replenishes it with 3k coins at very low rates. Someone definitely is trying(and has the means to) to push this market down, which is why I'm really hesitant to open a long here. As long as the shorts have funding it doesn't really matter how many they are. Best thing to do rn is nothing imo. Maybe open a long with stops at 6.5k.
All the pro traders here who short as a way to hedge their cold storage, I have a question for you guys. Do you still believe in bitcoin long term? Will you add more at the "bottom"? Are you interested in increasing BTC stash eventually or would you be happy with the fiat you make? 
Closed my [short](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8afnvv/daily_discussion_saturday_april_07_2018/dwz4kdl/?context=2) (7035->6665) that I held through the peak at 7200 and opened a long from 6675 on average. This is more of a scalp and I'll exit at 6800 unless there's a massive bump in buying. There seems to be no clear indication and I'll admit this long is mostly a gut feeling. Nevertheless, the last two weeks have been very good and I feel like I can afford a higher risk trade. Manual stop at ~6600.
What kind of weak shit is this... cashed in [my long](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8b4twg/daily_discussion_tuesday_april_10_2018/dx497fg/?context=3) 6675->6820 and out of position. I'd scalp a short back to 6700 except I don't think it's worth it with risk, fees and interest.

Seems like $7090 until we hit log resist line again.
A bearish failure swing (RSI) could be taking place on the 15 min. It's 15 min and it was only overbought on one close so may invalidate or not mean anything but I'm bored and thought I'd note it.
Hey all! Wanted to pop over into the daily and let y'all know that I just released a new crypto asset comparison tool for you to play around with, provide feedback on, critique, etc. Check it out when you have a second (appreciate your guys' feedback as always; this is for you after all)!

Question for bulls...if this was the bottom, how come there isn’t a sharp upward reversal like all the other previous pumps we’ve seen in 2018?

Question for bears...if this isn’t the bottom, are you expecting one last sudden drop into $5k for capitulation or a slow bleed into $5k?
I'd like to hear opinions on the report from Barclays that's going around, [here](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bitcoin-may-have-already-peaked-barclays-strategists-say-2018-04-10).

I'd personally love to see the math on how they attempted to calculate the maximum total possible market cap of such a nascent asset class. 
Any way to get the orderbook into tradingview?
Exited my long from 6657 at 6745.

Target of 6795 was actually hit, spot on but i fucked up my alarms once again so i missed it. on a happy note, i know what ive been doing wrong with them, ive been setting them but not confirming lol.

Anyway, im on side lines now, still getting tighter and im busy at uni all day so wont be able to keep an eye.

Cos we're getting so bloody tight, i think next move is gonna be a major one and my gut is telling me it'll be up but what the fuck do i know...

anyway, if you are trading today then good luck, this is some really risky business now.
Looks like we are in a slight [symmetrical triangle](https://www.tradingview.com/x/iBEzOP5u/). With lower highs and higher lows. Could break either way, but R/R looks better for a long here. Then again it also looks like a bear flag and the overall trend is down.

Opening a very small long here just because I use Bitmex and it'll shit the bed one we have confirmation. SL right at bottom of triangle, 6580.
inverted bart? Is this going to shoot up like last time?
7k long target then back to 6760 for next segment this contraction

Hey fellas, wanted to share a livestream on BTC price analysis with the community here, feel free to join the discussion https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_E6dMdi7WLo
Curious about everyone’s opinion and/or any historical data. IIRC, a common maxim has been that bitcoin does not double top/bottom. I think the logic is that it’s moves are frequently self-reinforcing and, therefore, subject to runaway due to fomo/panic. What’s your take on the old maxim? Any previous market events sway you for or against?
Here we go! Let's Bart the buck right back up! Target 7k.
Sitting in a risky short from $6830 (with stops above $7200). Longs can get pressured just as easily as shorts, reckoning time is soon and I still feel overall bearish. Gotta pick a side and it's still team bear for me atm.

I am quite convinced we are going to see bitcoin go sub 5k at some point - i think this is going to be after the 'bounce' mimicking the previous bubble's aftermath movements. 

Think about all the folks who invested solely because of hype who aren't following charts 24/7 have no clue about technicalities and buy/sell solely on emotions. Those folks don't know about dead cat bounces or if it's likely to repeat previous pattern or buy pressure or sell pressure. They know prices. We will need to rebuild THAT base sentiment to support the break through to all the people who are trapped, bears who short etc etc if we are to make a run. At this point the lower we go the higher % change is going to be for our run. 4k to 12k is 300%  while its 400% from 3k. 

What makes me even more convinced is the increasingly vocal talks about sell exhaustion, short squeezes and bear traps and bottom being in. Who is gonna throw money here if the public is just not buying? Overall, the complains I think are a great thing supporting bear trend. We are seeing some of the people who got in at hype have actually now started reevaluating technicalities and are defending position which is an increase in awareness - better than blind hodling (aka the en masse - the people who react to violent movements the most and whose sentiment will take time improving).

For long term traders especially spot positions,  the key question to identify I think is: Have we rebuilt the broken sentiment of the en masse who are trapped from 20 to 13k? (I don't think we have even finished breaking the sentiment yet lol)
When the answer for that question tends towards positive then we will be ready (at some point price action upwards will have to generate more feeling of fomo to counter the shorts being opened and we will need a decent gap if we are to make a run)

My position: Opened at 6.7k last night closed at 6.85. I intend on keep buying back in at 6.5k and shorting anywhere from 6.7 to 7k - at this point even if 6.5k breaks I should have made enough profits to offset losses from my stop sell. I like to stay flat more often than not these days though, too tiring i recall someone posting about trading being equivalent of taking 8gb 24/7 in a 16gb brain ram and feel like that's so true especially depending on your personality & financial situation. Still haven't opened any long term spots yet because I think that would be me just being impatient.
Still in my long

If you chose option three, could you indicate above which time frame you use log, daily, 4h, 1h?

Thanks!
Got stopped out overnight and now -surprise- we're back at 6750. Erased my gains from the past two days. I'm just exhausted by these whales games. Might just stay in USDT for awhile and wait to see if sub-6k ever happens. Trading in a market with barely any liquidity is just stupid.  
Anyone else expect some consolidation/sideways  here before the next move? We pretty much hit the top of the bear flag on thar wick with a target of 6869. Shorted this and believe we are headed back to mid 6700’s 


Although volume is very very low, [I like what I am seeing here,
](https://www.tradingview.com/x/gOay6FYg) so I opened a modest long.
The red line is the one that was born on the 1st this month when we hit a low at around 6410. It is being repeatedly tested on a very short time frame and I am confident that it will break. As I said a few days ago, noone seems to want to sell. The market goes either up or sideways, untill a huge red candle comes, which is obvious manipulation IMO. Perhaps we've finally shaken the weak hands off?

I am hoping for a breakout tonight, and my SL is just below the blue line at around 6790. As I've said many a time before, I am a degenerate gambler, but not an idiot.
I don't think it will be a repeat of the 6th; the boat has many waves inside it and is getting rather long; maybe its fractal but why would whale games be fractal?

First? I’d love some good karma 

Edit: what’s more likely sub 3K or above 12K by June 18’, also EOY? All I need to know. Thanks in advance 
This could go either way so i've reduced my short position to 1/2 the size it originally was when i opened at 7.1. I don't want to miss the breakdown but i also don't want to get steamrolled on a run up to 7k. Will add the rest at 6.9-7.05 or at 6.4. 

Still think we could hit 5xxx by today's close and that down is more likely than up. And with that im done chartwatching for today.

EDIT: of course, dropping 10% in any 10 hour period is unlikely but i'm not betting on a 10% secular drop. Any lower low <6.6 is likely to lead to panic imo and anything under 6.4 is goblintown for sure and that's what im looking for.

Unless someone big is acting on insider information, the bears are absolutely hysterically delusional with these amounts of shorts. It'll be very fun to see them when the reality hits. Let me repeat - delusional hysterical brats. Just as bad as the delusional hysterical children who were longing at 17k.
This just looks like a repeat of past weekend's action but with even less volume on both sides. There doesn't seem to be much organic buys, rather whales buying and selling into larger orders, which may be their own, to create volume to squeeze longs and shorts and create FOMO/FUD... I did well longing for the first time in a month over the weekend but this feels like a no-trade zone for me since I don't want to get dumped on. I think I represent the amateur retail investors' sentiment.

*tinfoil hat on: It seems to me that the whales are running out of ammo or getting tired/exhausted. If I had to guess they will dump this one more time below $6K and hopefully organic FOMO rally will take us into a new bull market once it finds a bottom. I think if they use their last bit to pump it, they run the risk of it not sustaining and then falling back into a downtrend and losing control.
Why anyone thinks a chart of significantly (2-3%) lower highs and slightly higher lows (0.5-1%) in an overwhelmingly bear trend is going to suddenly rocket to Pluto is beyond me. 
Hello, does anyone know of any block explorers where I can list multiple addresses at the same time? I have an HD wallet and have gone through loads of addresses, I'm looking for a complete list of all transactions (including to each other) in one place.

I'd then want to export to csv as well.

I have electrum but their export function does not include the addresses, only the transaction hashes. It would take me ages to manually get the addresses for each hash.

I'm trying to do my taxes!!
So if you were able to identify the bottom within a few hundred $ and opened a medium/high leverage long (say 25x, which should allow for wiggle room of a couple hundred bucks with regards to your liquidation point) - if and when BTC goes back up you're filthy rich, right? Am I missing something obvious here? Will contracts be liquid enough when we hit that magic low price?
This feels like seller exhaustion against buyer reluctance here.  All the depth charts (ignoring the flashing whale bots) and volume price move indications are suggesting to me a jerk up in price is in the cards 7-7.1k bart move not unlikely again.

Ethereum looking particularly strong, ratio move.  This may be the better bull play but if BTC flails, ETH will as well.  ETH as a ratio play may still be good there thou.

May the block be with you.


I'm not a fan of setting stops but I've shoots to do today and hesitantly bought in with 50% of my fiat. I'm still betting it'll go down but am really in mixed minds if it'll go past 6500 on the first attempt.

The number of shorts that might close on a bounce is why I bought in. I don't want to miss out on the opportunity.
it isnt fail safe. he sometimes loose money but hes making more the. he loose. so i like it. just need to tweak it more. 
I'm long from 6750 with a stop at 6525. Tight enough? Or 6400?
Some big sells over the last 2 days....we gonna get a pump...or a 3rd dump?
Sorry for stupid question, but where do you find total longs and shorts opened for BTC? I am really interested in analyzing price/longs/short correlation. Thank you
Where can I find outstanding long vs shorts for BTC/USD? Bfxdata charts aren't loading for me. 
wow, cryptowatch's new feature added logos of all cryptos, a refreshing trading experience
What causes more pain for shorts? Slow squeeze combined with high lending fees or swift squeeze? 
Noob query: Can anyone explain interest rates on Bitmex to me? Let's say I open a perpetual swap, is interest charged daily to my balance or is it only charged on settlement? Should I be loaning my unused BTC to earn interest on? How do I do this?

I seemed to have overlooked the whole interest part of it (stupid I know) and just thought I'd leave open a long for months without realizing that I'd actually be getting dinged along the way.

Usually when people say some part of a chart looks similar to another,
they fail to appreciate that the context (from a technical standpoint) those similar structures occurred in aren't similar enough.

Having said that I'll share a previous section of the chart.
Not so much as a bullish case, but more to let the bears question the validity of their expectations.

Are the altcoins leading BTC these days? Seems like alot of them bottomed
Imagine getting squeezed by this pump. Price went under my alarm before I could open bitmex on my phone. Could still go to 7k so that's where I placed my other sell offers. 
[removed]
Call me naive, but I'd rather hold my coins to zero than give them up to Soros, Rothschilds, Rockefeller, or Bogdanoff's. I'm bearish short term, but bullish as hell long term.  

This is simply a game. Following the majority isn't going to be profitable because not everyone will win in a game like this. Go against the grain and that's how legends are forged.
High volume = prixe drop.  Weak volume = wont move.  Is it ok to enter now and return 2 months later?  Seems like its not that easy to aim and wait the exact bottom.  I think big players r still w8tng or what?
Already taken a big shit, but still one dump left to flush everything out.
2 hour looks like its about to break either way soon, but don't expect any big move tbh
So this "double bubble" has become a meme but* so has the "double bottom" and also the "we are here" from the 2014 chart. 

Do we have enough good news coming out to sustain this price? Meh. Not yet.

Do we have enough bad news to drive us to the doldrums that 2014 did? Maybe. The remaining gox coins are on the horizon in some way-shape-form. 

Has the general public become familiar enough with crypto for us to double bubble? I think so. It seems crypto has caught on in a huge way in the run up and now that the everyday person, moms and pops, and the technologically challenege have become familiar with the terminology on a basic level and are able to buy crypto now. I do believe it's possible with a solid push higher to test above 10k, there's the opportunity for this to have been just the first push of the big push to higher. I'd like to hear the counter to this and maybe hear why btc won't be able to sustain or why btc should enter a longer bear market and correction? I'm watching the Zuckerberg youtube video and the chat is constant crypto shilling... eye opening to see this take place in a live stream of something that has nothing to do with crypto.
Probably time to get out of my $6727 long....nice bump up followed by the usual drop $6600 soon...my opinion
I have been longing to see a good pump and at least $500 increase in price in under half an hour.

Is [this](https://www.tradingview.com/x/lvubcb7i/) yet another bear flag?

I think the only real buyers for Bitcoin are those who are buying it to buy alts. Others are just traders and manipulation. Fiat pairs for alts will seriously reduce real buying for BTC, and the price will go even further down. When BTC price reaches the area that its no longer profitable to mine (sub 5k I think), I don't know what will happen next. What do you guys think?
iam outta position here, and i slept well and did otehr things n stuff.

will reshort this if it gets above 7k or will reshort the bounce from 6k.

not shorting here coz its not worth the hassle.
Hi guys, we are slowly moving upwards with little or no changes noticed in the order book. I believe the big sell whales are out already.

I know it is not the best indicator, but it is very likely that even though if it is a slow growth, it could make us cross the resistance.

Mandy: You got it!!

lol. that's the worst thing you can do.

this market has punished the breakout traders severely.
Solid analysis, thanks for posting!
Kudos. I definitely feel the strain of trying to trade. May I ask if you're effectively "out of the market" either by (a) being in fiat and/or (b) having cold storage hedged with a matching short? Or, did you simply make a really good entry (such as ~$6500 several weeks ago) and simply haven't been concerned with it. 

I ask because I tried moving completely to fiat for a couple weeks simply to take a break, and found myself nearly as stressed as before... concerned that I was going to miss the "big" move.
Totally with you man on the first paragraph. And it's not more profitable for me to overanalyze and overtrade anyway. Just worse decisions chasing mediocre situations.
>I think few traders appreciate the mental toll it takes on them. It's like you're a computer with 16 GB RAM but 8 GB is always consumed by trading

Well yes, in a way. But on the other hand, we need to see this as a good learning opportunity and embrace it. After all, that is what makes a good trader, embracing any market condition and adpat to it. It's like martial arts, never turn your face away from the hits because they you know for sure you will get hit/killed. Instead try to learn how to fight back

I also think it shows how early this market is because very few people talk about trading psychology and mindset, and that there is not so many posts about it here, but for me those things has helped me 10x more than all stupid memes about "Hodl", "invest in the team" and whatever
I entirely agree with your forecast
Maximum pain hypothesis suggests more shake-outs.

I prefer nobody updates the noobs as they are Not generally in it for the tech and what it can do for society. As a LTHdlr those into crypto for trading profits are not beneficial to us.  Frankly people who can't see the true value of crypto long term don't deserve profits unless they are making markets and providing liquidity like some traders here do. But they don't. They FOMO in with market orders and create volatility and dump out at the first sign of a short term top. 
Appreciate the balanced analysis, thanks. 
my TA senses tell me a correction up is around the corner .
WhaleCalls shows us that long v short has minimal impact in the market... no matter how much this sub jerks off to it.
Whenever I see that someone is drawing divergences like that I assume they are wrong... Can someone explain to me what are your rules, sometimes people are drawing it from the wicks, sometimes from the bodies. I learned only using wicks...
They should've announced it at least a week in advance.
prepare the exit scam memes
Almost too convenient.
While the number of shorts is very high, the number of longs is very high, what would happen then if the price crashes? The way you describe the situation has a strong bull bias. 

Also the fact shorts are at an ATH doesn't matter, what's really important is the proportion of Shorts/Longs.  
I would assume people would close their shorts making the price rise. In my opinion, I would never leave an open short when I have 0 access or control over what happens to it. 


A "performance update" with less than 24 hours notice?

Anyone noticing any urgent performance issues on bitfinex?
They usually aren't down very long for maintenance so I wouldn't make much of it.
 "We will be deploying a performance update tomorrow, April 11th, sometime between 9:00am and 17:30pm UTC. All traders should expect an interruption of approximately 60 minutes where trading and funding features will be unavailable.

Users can stay up to date via [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/bitfinex) and [bitfinex.statuspage.io](https://bitfinex.statuspage.io/) throughout the upgrade.

Thank you for your patience and we look forward to presenting you with tomorrow's upgrade."
They recently were down for maintenance already. Will keep an eye on their wallets for sure. This could be one of those black swan events. But I think there is nothing to worry about tbh.
What I don't understand is that US tourists in Amsterdam tend to complain about the "unprofessional service" they receive at the local Starbucks when ordering US 4 coffee. But are completely unconcerned when a bloody financial exchange holding a material amount of their money goes "down for maintenance". How unprofessional is that? Especially for an exchange that is under scrutiny already. I would never trust them with my money, even if it's only 4 US.
I’m long from just about this. Didn’t get stopped out on drop to mid 6k’s yesterday. Feeling pretty good about this long right now 
Curious what the volume profile of that typically looks like. It’s hard to believe reaccumulation on such low volume 
That chart shows that the bottom of the "reaccumulation" should be higher than the bottom of the initial rise to the left. That doesn't appear to be the case here.
Thanks for this pattern! This looks like what is happening to Eth on the daily chart at the moment, and should be confirmed once Eth closes above 420 with good volume. 

Which leads me to believe that the same thing could possibly be happening to Bitcoin as well (although lagging) since the cryptomarkets tend to move together in general.
As others would have pointed out, the number of shorts or Long's is not really as relevant as the ratio. And the ratio isn't nearly unbalanced as it has been during previous short squeezes. 
The long awaited bull squeeze is upon us. McDonald's is handing out free triple beef patty big mac's to mark the occasion.

Wow you’re extremely over weight.

I've had this thought rolling around for a while, and it's probably the wrong place to ask it, but... on the topic of "*if* it breaks down"

Do you think the OKEX futures cascading liquidation meltdown to the mid-$4K's 1.5 weeks ago was a realistic model for what a breakdown of $6k might look like on the spot market, or was it completely due to a lack of price controls and unlikely to play out similarly?

Had the same short, closed it last night at 6700. I don't like to sleep with open positions even with stop losses, and as you said this can go either way from here. Waiting for clearer signals or a breakdown to enter again
3 failed attempts at 7.5k with lower highs. Where do you see the bullishness here?

I doubt that we will see 7.3k before 6.1k.

Short didn’t really blink in the previous dcb. 

Longs will close if we go any higher than 7k, not even shorts.
It seems like your moves have been absolutely spot-on for the past couple weeks.  The short from 7100 was just hours before a several hundred dollar drop. And then you closed it at the right moment too.  What are you using to decide it was time to get out into and out of that short, just hours before the price starts moving.  
You also forgot the part when he shorted since December, and now publicly declare he will start trading
I'm tired of hearing about Soros non-stop for days, but your reasoned and thoughtful analysis is infinitely better than the memes and FUD. Thanks!
Institutional investors probably won't short from here. There is not enough liquidity to make any significant money for them on the way down. Unless their intention is to destroy crypto, or to have a slightly lower entry point.
You're missing the forest for the trees. Yes there are some big trees making individual decisions, but who knows what 5d chess they are playing, what their endgame is. It's too facile to say 1 person makes 1 decision and executes this decision in 1 event, eg: Soros is going to buy on April 20th at $5500.

The forest for hedge funds is that bitcoin is an [uncorrelated asset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ImlgTl3BPU) (not anti-correlated, ***un***correlated), which is extremely rare now, and provides great diversification for any portfolio - the volatility itself is attractive to some. 

Personally I care more that is that it's better at storing value than anything else humanity has ever come up with - the long term price rise is attractive to me. I think this is a more important and predictable aspect than its uncorrelation. And because the long term is more predictable, I think DCA is the smartest philosophy for bitcoin.
I would say Soros is bullish on crypto especially after pumping $100 million into Overstock.

If i had a lot of money and want to make good deal of money out of bitcoin, I would short futures and buy bitcoin, which i call set spring strategy. After accumulated a lot of bitcoin, I would stop shorting close all short positions and market buy bitcoin on several exchanges to create another bull run over time. The key is to store a lot of btc to dictate when the bull run will be over. It is a new market and has a lot of opportunities for big money people.
Soros was last week, now it's Thanos.
Good chart mate. Long term support has been showing strength over the past few days.
If it does anything like the last wedge did after ath, look out below 
Longing the top I could understand, since it have infinite upside. But shorting the long term bottom like this... hmmm
To be fair it really should be quite obvious that this would happen in the bear market following BTC's ATH. What I find more astounding is the number of longs still open and the time it took for shorts to reach ATH. Unfortunately the data we have to work with doesn't trace back very far so it's difficult to imagine the upper limits and averages of long/short positions a BTC bear market dictates.
It's not 1 BTC=1 trader. Big players might be hedging and they rightfully should be. The real question is who is still going long and risking a double whammy on their trading stack and cold storage. Those are the people that are most likely to panic close on a drop under 6k, not the hedged shorts on another lower high to 6.9. 
If a buyer wanted to wreck a majority of the shorts what would it take?
When I stopped trading ETH all I was watching was bitcoin. Then I realized that in terms of monetary value there was no reason not to trade bitcoin instead. Eth followed the pumps and dumps of bitcoin but performed worse over time. I reached that decision when it went from 0.1 ratio to 0.096 ratio. Now ratio is just below 0.06
I think this is really wise. My stack is by far mostly ETH (although I’m looking for a BTC entry) and always find it comical when people try to chart ETH independently. ALTS are so tied to BTC still I’ve never understood why some folks look strictly at ETH charts expecting it to detach any time soon.
The new UI is pretty great.  When did they implement it?  Last time I used Bittrex was when they had the white one and the Fisher-Price My First Charts.
alts might have a bit of a bull run?
Guess they turned it off because after a couple of failed attempts to register (unknown error after putting in email/pass), it has gone back to the page saying they are only accepting corporate accounts. 
when's the last time it's been this low? GDAX is at 7k. 
Strange low volume buy pressure atm. Are we being dragged by ETH or this finally the meme squeeze.
bots and manipulation ahoy!
...From people who, in earnest, know f*** all, but whom will be more than willing to act the part of Nostradamus.
I'm off to the shops, does anyone want anything?
Imho good r/r on this one. Fingers crossed.
Longed yesterday @6670, rode it down to 6600 and once it got up almost to BE i set a stop @6669 and got hit.
Have no idea what to do next so i'll sit out of position for a while. Specially since i'm in a bad streak of trades
at least I get to work a little
Yesterday you said if it drops below 6500 to bail. Any reason you put stops below 6400? 
Did you see the c-clamp on the daily? Love the Ichi c-clamps. 
Great post, thanks
What we need is more memes over at /r/bitcoin
Haha if this plays out similary the downtrend line will be broken around 8.5 or so, everybody will call moon again and then around 10k, tadaaaa
How long do you expect it to last in 2018 then? 
I’m looking at the same flag. Next target being 6750? Could Jump in for a quick scalp 
Your stops are too tight.

You shouldnt close an unleveraged short below 7200
> Majority here is absolutely convinced that this is the bottom and the people FOMO shorting will get rekt.

Is it a majority when the majority are short though?

Is it the same volume, intensity and style of bias in these daily threads as there was at 16-20k? After the log-channel blew off there was ever increasing calls of *"You guys are insane, I'm not touching this with a 50ft barge pole, I'd short but you'll just overrun me with irrationality"* .. Which sounds like sentiment we have now but inverse. (Perhaps enough bid support to easier justify risk/reward on inverse though)

> Whatever happens from here should be very interesting at least.

Getting so tight, explosive volatility coming.

> I really do think sometimes that when this sub overwhelmingly agrees on something, the opposite tends to happen. It'll be very fun to see what happens and if that little theory holds true

Those people calling the top *"insanity"* did have plenty of chance to be wrong and get liquidated before the top was finally in. No surprise if we take a massive leg down here, everyone must get rekt.

> I don't think this is a great reason to short or hold open a short, but I find it interesting either way and it's something that's definitely curious.

Yeah the smart ones preempting the top were also not taking any positions, fully aware it had legs of irrationality.

>  terrible failure of a pump

These walls, to cover positions from lower which are now closed out in profit, or does someone really wanna invest in painting a bull-run. Imagine how much they could lose pulling that trigger too early.
Disclaimer: I have no idea what I'm on about. If you do the exact opposite of what I suggest you'll *probably* make a decent profit.

That said, I genuinely would not be surprised if we just continue sideways. We've reached a point where I suspect those who wanted to sell probably already have by now, but equally there's really just no buying pressure at all. I'm still admittedly optimistic for the long term but right now, I really wouldn't be surprised if we just barely move at all all week.
You are consistently one of the most level-headed people on this sub.
Still bearish here. Until we break above the downward log trend line, I will remain so. 

That being said, I still hold plenty of crypto in the hopes that there will be a reversal. I only trade with a small stack and I'm currently 50/50 fiat to crypto, so maybe I am doubting my own beliefs. ;)
Everyone is completely convinced we are going upwards? IDK, sentiment still seems pretty down here, podcasts I listen to, YouTube channels I follow (chartguys, in particular), Crypto Twitter, even Tone V. 

I think the majority believe we are going down more. I am hopeful its not the case, but I'd be surprised if we sustain upwards and I'd think most would agree.
From my knowledge, you’re still holding a short from over 10k correct? Just wondering if you have closed it/ why you still haven’t closed it. Are you waiting for the triangle to play out? When so many people think one thing, it tends to do the other. 

Where do you stand right now? 
the ratio is going higher and higher. 3 projects have launched mainnet. 
Cheap bitcoins soon?
Limited supply.
too much buying pressure at 6.5-6.6k. too few traders willing to sell 6.5k. Last Feb, it was Kobayashi who didn't mind pulling an 18k trigger at that level..
People are starting slowly to DCA. Which means if it goes lower they will buy to lower their DCA. And before you know it you have a reversal.
We have not broken 6.5k . And not for lack of trying. We are sitting in a trend line that will colide with the downwards channel in a few days. Last time this happened there was a huge dump, but it looks like the momentum of the market it's much weaker now.
People in the US are going to use their tax return to buy bitcoin?
Just buy or Add and see how it goes in 3 -9 months.

Read this sub from the same date and month but in 2014
My scientific wild ass guess it is a several years long bear market. No TA. 
This sub is now just people posting their entries and 1% profit exits

Longs opening upvoted, shorts closing upvoted, longs closing and shorts opening downvoted

To answer your question, there's not much TA to post because the price is completely range bound right now 
> Where are the TA posts gone ?

This month it's Bart Simpsons all the way down
Probably because a lot of people don't really know what's going to happen as the range we're trading in keeps getting tighter.

I haven't made a trade all day and it feels weird but I don't want to open a position or make a trade when I can't even sway myself to think one way or the other.
I have basically never been able to tell what's happening, like *ever*, because I suck at TA I guess, but I am watching what's going on right now, because we are just now entering the Ichimoku cloud on the 1h and I'm curious what's gonna happen.
I’m pretty sure everyone is
It’s like watching paint dry 
Literally almost everybody.
Yeah we’re in a falling wedge. 

[This tweet](https://twitter.com/peterlbrandt/status/983680943805218816?s=21) has some scenarios of how this might play out.
Then you have stuff like this, were weekly RSI is lowest ever since Bitmex chart started :P  https://www.tradingview.com/x/UufV9zqg

The lower trendline is a bit bad since could be lower slope on but it's more to show the long term trend 
Stepped away from the computer for an hour and came back and saw this dip, so I opened a long. Hope I made the right choice.
I begin more and more to think that the exchange is "the whale"...
this bear whale popping up with large sell walls has not shown any activity for some time. everybody else is to scared to buy the price up. 
if she was actually around the whole bubble peak able to refrain from buying and is only buying now - thats a damn smart wife. you hold onto her.
She would have been bullish if she used that app 3 years ago to buy bitcoin. Then you wouldn’t have had to buy it now because you would be retired . 
It’s funny, I have absolutely no money to put into Bitcoin but I still find myself reading this sub every day and watching the markets😂 Any other lurkers out there like me?
I picked up a journal yesterday to start my trading log so I can learn from these mistakes and replay these trades in my head, a tip from an expert prop trader on how to increase how fast you learn from the experience you do get. By repeating trades in your head and going over them you can turn 1 trades worth of experience into 5
Yeah, but you don't really know it's solid until after the fact!

What *was* solid was your risk management, considering that you didn't lose anything.  So don't be too hard on yourself.  (though completely exiting a position due to cold feed isn't exactly great risk management... but it's better than losing!)


But I did the same thing but in reverse, abandoning a short just before the nice drop a few days ago.  So I totally feel ya, and still wish I could have decent risk management and still make profits.


Next time I am in that situation, rather than getting cold feet, I'm going to set some limits to *scale out*, so that if it does go the way I originally wanted to go, maybe I can still have some of the position.  But if it does go against me, still escape.  (Though still, I prefer to setup scale outs within a profit zone and not a loss zone)
Same happens to me all the time, i should just use stop losses and be patient instead of selling instantly when it starts to go down. Missed out on a lot of gains because of that :s
Likely can write stories during JUST this chop, where could have made more money than in first three months of the year.
buy/sell, set stops, walk away

come back when in profit
Yeah, this is another good point. The shorts will definitely provide a nice cushion on the way down if we do end up moving down from here. 
if there is anything good about leverage, it'd be this cushion. 
you mean a long wik to 6.9k? 
Where can we see total # of longs vs shorts on bitmex?
Me neither, you'll never make real money closing too early. I have a stop at breakeven tho.


I would say that the only thing that really unites us is this weird ass thing called bitcoin
As long as people leave low buy orders intact and don't start to market buy in fear it might never gets there, I'm bearish. A short squeeze is fun but nowhere near enough to sustain momentum. 

I think we'll see at least a last capitulation leg down, which would be preferable to months of slow bleed after a slow run to 9k or so, but it's impossible to tell. 

The thing is, I remain open minded, not excluding this could be the bottom, so I'm cautious long or short but prefer to try to let my longs run in case a bull run is kickstarted somehow, whereas I don't hesitate to take profits quickly on shorts if I don't have a super high entry.
I think that $6k ish is the bottom and will stay the bottom. We will see movement between $6.5 to $8k for a while till there is more public interest in bitcoin again and the price slowly goes up...probably a lot in the next few years especially 2020 when mined bitcoin halves again. People that got burned since $20k in January will eventually forget....
I'm neutral. I can see bitcoin being range bound between 6 and 8k for months to come.


They are looking juicy for a bounce, especially if fomo occurs.
short squeeze in 3..2..1...
So... we get a good old Short Squeeeeezzze?
Surprisingly small mod queue, too. Yesterday the daily was swiss cheese.
> the big players are slowly rounding up the bears in a corner, before springing the trap and slaughtering them

I know this market is manipulated on individual and small whalepod levels but I just don't buy these grand narratives. I think we are just riding a strong long term support that has been there for 6 months. 

We still have three potential large descending triangles close to forming and I haven't seen any kind of buying strength to indicate that one of them won't break down.

That said I am keeping my short entries to when they meet these resistances, as the margin of error for shorts is very low this close to the support line.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/DImhZ4qh/
Price consolidates, then moves. It's not strange to see low volume trading within bounds. Eventually it will pop out of the lines and that's a signal that large movement and volume is coming. 

Sellers have brought more volume than buyers thus far. I don't anticipate this will change when we break out, but I'm honestly surprised by how long this pattern has gone already so who knows
NO GAIN WITHOUT PAIN DUSHMAN. I'm keeping mine till the end, fees or not. 3D chart looks like the cutest bear flag and I do not want to have to FOMO short when Bitmex is overloaded. 
you still have 15 minutes and " call a friend" option.
Why do you call such specific prices? What do you get out of it? Is profit not enough if you are right?

Edit: I'm too drunk too make coherent sentences
The oracle can't be wrong.  This whole time we've been worshiping a false prophet.
>Suffice to say I still believe we will close at 5xxx before we close 8xxx. 

Thanks Pablo Picasso, all the bears follow the same dude on twitter and repeat his stuff.


[deleted]
Wait.... since when have you been wrong? Oh yes, every time you have ever made a prediction. 
>I still believe we will close at 5xxx before we close 8xxx. 
>If I'm wrong I Iose a lot of BTC.

I'm going to disagree. I give it ~15 days at the most but if we're not there by then I hope you close your short. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/RJ3YKgEd/
So you're basically saying if it goes down a bit you expect it to go down further, and if it goes up a bit you expect it to go up further. This is why sometimes I'm not the biggest fan of TA..
[deleted]
Only in crypto a $1000 spread (15%) is stable lol. But I do think that range is noise at this point and probably most of us are waiting for a proper breakout either way.
Yes. right. 
I'm adding.. piece by piece.. because on long term ( 3- 9 months ) we will be higher.

Because i think the " big boys" do the same.  If they want it more down they can do it... So far this range - 6500 - 7500 is OK for me to add. Always my 2 cents

Short squeeze... Bitcoin's great white hope
I’m confused, i thought a lot of shorts indicate trust in downtrend?
What was Mike’s target to sell this time? 
approaching the ath of longs atm... pretty crazy, surely trading cant be this easy for bears?
I went long :) 
We've only got to drop to 6550 for a lot of buys laying in wait which could trigger a squeeze.
Morning? I haven't slept yet
By closed short you mean you bought at 6788? Im trying to get used to the shorting terminology lol
Smart move. The reason funding is expensive is that supply is tightening. Price will explode upward starting any day now.
Honestly I really think it could go either way at this point.

I'm short but with fairly tight stops since again, I really could see it going either way. Which is also why I suspect we'll continue going sideways for a while. 

Best of luck regardless.

and yet btc never had a dao/"oops i killed it" moment. imo, github stats/activity is a better metric. 
> Someone definitely is trying(and has the means to) to push this market down

Or trying to suck in more shorters only to liquidate them.
he is giving low funding to the longs too
Yes, BTC is the first step to end federal reserve banking, centralization of  payment censoring(see Wikileaks blocked by Visa) and inflation as a way to steal from the poor without assets and only cash.

BTC and blockchains is for money and decentralized storage what Internet and email is for freedom of speech and democratization of knowledge and technology


This is the reason being a coin maximalist is extremley stupid, and especially the ETH or BTC guys tend to be that
u/_chewtoy_ ?
Looks like a pretty standard bearflag. Looking at the similar fractal 18-25 March, this has preeeetty high downwards potential.

In any case, I'm surprised how many posts here are bullish. Is it really probable that we go right up again after yesterdays definitive breakdown? Doesn't it make much more sense that we will have to find the bottom of this short-term fall first?
reasonable trade, if these shorts dont start seeing some more down movement there could be a decent squeeze
Yeah, pretty disappointed with this pump.
Ah, you 1 minute candle chasers. 
I did basically the same. Let's see whether we go up again or, as I suspect, back down in a short period of time.
Not sure why this is being downvoted. While it hasn't been every time, more often than not in the past few weeks we've had a dip once the 15 min macd crosses negative, which just happened. There is bearish divergence on the 15min from the past several hours as well.
> if this was the bottom, how come there isn’t a sharp upward reversal like all the other previous pumps we’ve seen in 2018?

Bottom's are not always V shaped. Sellers are exhausted, buyers are standoffish due to so much downward movement. Confidence needs to build, it's increasing each day we don't drop.

> if this isn’t the bottom, are you expecting one last sudden drop into $5k for capitulation or a slow bleed into $5k?

If 6k breaks convincingly leverage will be increased on shorts, more longs will close, and we'll be at 5k within a day or two.

I'll answer from both sides:

Bulls: I genuinely suspect this might be the bottom. At the same time, buy volume is low and I suspect many would-be bulls are holding fire because they want some kind of confirmation of where the market will go first. 

Bears: Two reasons:

1. It's in the interest of those with large holdings and those with mining operations to keep the value of bitcoin relatively high and not too far off $8k. For this reason, I genuinely suspect there's a lot of whales propping the price up. Not to say there aren't whales trying to push it down too mind you. 

2. Because for the most part, those who were going to sell and start shorting, already have. Also it's profitable for whales to bat it around a bit first and liquidate a few inexperienced traders.
Did you miss the V shaped bottom 2 months ago?
I expect a bull trap followed by a deep dive below 5000. I don't even know how many times I've heard people say that they're waiting for sub-5000 to buy back in, so that's where I expect the next bounce to happen. 

The only question is how long do we go sideways before it happens? At this point it wouldn't surprise me if it was a few days...or a few months. 
A reversal is not the same thing as a bull run. We haven't found a new low in over 8 weeks, yet the bear market is 14 weeks old.
"“Combined with the results of our theoretical modeling, survey findings suggest that, unlike the peaks in Bitcoin prices in 2011 and 2013, the most recent peak may have been the ultimate top and that speculative interest could decrease from here,” writes Barclays in a research note dated Tuesday."

That's a lot of "suggesting", "may have", and "could"... As the old adage goes... "Statistics is never having to say you're certain."
I think its over stated, we *all* know this wave of speculation is over. Because no shit the last bear run was absurd and this market hurts.

They are stating the obvious with a negative spin.  
I know the model that this is based on: Its the Bass Diffusion model. In science this model is used so often and applied to everything. Just go to google scholar and search for it. 

My assumption is that people will not start to buy the first time they hear it. They need to hear it again and again to get interested \(that is how advertisment works\). To base the whole price movement one this one word of mouth effect is not working here from my POV. 
there is no single order book, each exchanges order book is found on their trading site

Instead of alarms why not set a limit sell at your target price?
looks like it
looks like it 
Could you elaborate on that please?

Sorry, noob here 
Nobody reputable will give you an advisory letter saying that you can do a like kind exchange.

If you want to gamble that you will get interest and penalties, then go right ahead and try it.
NO! Speak with any accountant and they will tell you the same. You might as well not report than use 1031 (like kind exchange rule) since it is a lot more complicated than it seems. Simple guidelines: https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/like-kind-exchanges-under-irc-code-section-1031

I have bought and sold multiple properties and deferred taxes using 1031
Every CPA/tax attorney I've asked said the same thing. Like kind does not apply towards crypto for 2017.
Don't fucking chance it
If the ict of the IRS is at the same level of our taxman (Windows 95 and COBOL) I wouldn't be worried about anything. Unless, off course, you're in the sample they hand-pick to check thoroughly 😜
fwiw I used bitcoin.tax and my cpa at KPMG thought the reports generated were adequate
I used bitcoin.tax and the report it generated seemed to work out, got my return processed and everything just fine
My opinion: No, don't know who would say that. Also that logic seems pretty nonsensical to me. 

The old Maxim was good for a quick jerk.
Or... we Bart back down to 6750 after a few hours flat above 6800.
Do you plan to add on a rise to say 7k or have you fully layered in?
> Have we rebuilt the broken sentiment of the en masse who are trapped from 20 to 13k? (I don't think we have even finished breaking the sentiment yet lol)

Is this necessary? Has this been the case with other market bubbles (ie. dotcom) outside of crypto? Were previous crypto crashes considered 'maximum pain' at the time? Have there been market situations where this hasn't been the case?

Everyone keeps repeating this but I'd like to know if this is a verifiable pattern, and if so, in what circumstances and sectors?

Is MAXIMUM PAIN really necessary for recovery? Or is it just something we've meme-ified? 

I'm not saying you and others are wrong, I just keep seeing it repeated and want to know the source of it.
With a speculative asset a bubble burst could be a realization that the market might or will fail. It will need to go through a period of doubt, reevaluation, and soul searching to see if the market does have a chance or a future if we follow the course of sentiment with the dotcom crash. Think of the last run as a mainstream test run. What were your feelings on how it went? Is this market necessary? Will things improve on the tech side? Do you see it growing in the coming years or do you see it as an oddity that got hyped but will ultimately fade away? This is why the pain is needed because it is rooted in real fud.
Ha, same here. What's your TP? I had a limit sell order at 6803, which was missed marginally :(.. now rethinking it.
Where is the option "I use both"?
Does it matter which option I / You use ... or the outcome??!!!
Bogdanov watches for comments like this
You got stopped out by a 2% move, that's not the fault of whale manipulation. Your stops (>6.6) made no sense considering that 6.6 was yesterday afternoon's low. You're either overleveraged or lack the confidence to be in the position you took and you should stay out of position for now. 
Your stops are too tight 

You want to put your stops below the 24 hr low and generally also below support lines. The latter can fuck you hard, but generally once we dip, we go lower anyways
So you closed your long on that move as a scalp?

Still holding mine, maybe I'm getting married to that position.  But it's worth so little so I won't close here.  Still think I'd hold this and just add to it if we go lower.

Your short plan seems decent at least for a tiny scalp to the bottom of the bear flag, maybe for more if you are lucky.

Edit: btw, congrats on your first trading being successful.  You seem to be doing it pretty disciplined.  Continuously longing and shorting the range of this bear flag might bite you soon though, be careful.
Im hoping for a bump to $6900 ish so I can close my long from $6727 for a small profit.
It's a clear tightening pattern that's been going on since 30 march. Wouldn't be surprised to see us go back to 7000, drop again to 6700 and then gravitate between 6700-6800 for a couple days. It's going to be boring, but there's going to be fireworks after that. 
Whales do whatever the fuck they want in this market
reddit is bugged again
Whale Game fractal theory.
> but why would whale games be fractal

If they are playing the same game repeatedly.  (not that I support that theory)
You can have an upvote from me. I'm not sure I would call it "whale games" but this is not natural market movements so I don't know why it would behave according to analysis such as fractals.
I'm not seeing that. I can see 5 comments right now. Let me know if the issue persists.
Just happened to me. love my kids but FML
Maybe you can try Trailing Stops. 
I'm pretty sure the price will hit $35K. But not 2018. I guarantee that we won't see that price this year.

I think the post is going to yield modest gains for the next 5 minutes, before a bit of a pullback and consolidation in the mid 10's.

So, sub 3k I guess, but that number would be an astronomical valuation for a first comment post in this sub.
I know things move faster now than the last bear market but I can't help but think we will be in this same $6-8K range in June '18 which is about 1.5 months away. Too many people impatiently waiting for price to either plummet or start bullrun this week. 
If anyone knew they'd go all in and ignore the charts for 6 months 
I'd guess 12k is more likely than 3k, but honestly I think we'll be stuck between 6-8k for a while
Who knows for EOY but I see 5.5k in the following days, if we can't bounce, then low 4k to 3k.

We need a trigger for a reversal/bullrun.
This just goes to show...ppl love to speculate. What the point is idk... but it seems to keep the locals going. As you were... 
 12k june 3k EOY
sub $3k more likely but june is too soon for that.
Both unrealistic but i guess 3k. Eoy definitely 12k
Yeah, well, that's just like, your opinion, man
Did you miss ATH shorts opened?
Yes, definitely. Bitcoin does not always have to be king for crypto to thrive

Not to mention they could short btc and long crypto as a whole, either by investing directly or in exchanges/crypto related ventures
If they are buying (only anecdotal evidence at this point), I will bet my left nut that they're doing it OTC with bulletproof Non-disclosure Agreements with the people they're buying from.

I would even say that they will be buying at discount, since IF they are buying, they would be buying in the tens of millions worth (ie pocket change for them), and right now you wouldn't be able to sell, say, $20m+ worth of BTC (ie 3000BTC+ ) without a decent amount of slippage.

From there, they can leverage short @ 10x (30,000 BTC), and benefit from the aftermath of one of the biggest margin-call cascades in history.
This is really the most memey shit i've heard on reddit in a long time. Soros and the rockefellers coming to save crypto? what
Overblown, let this meme die fast. 
If I were Soros, I would short the fucking crap out of Bitcoin, dump into oblivion and then when all you fuckers have exited, buy everything I can get my hands on 

no way he would buy long at 7k
are you serious? they might see a short opportunity. Those you mentioned made money in both directions
Whatever makes you sleep at night. Bears took us from 20k to 6.5k and will probably bring us to 5k soon. Nothing delusional about making stacks by going with the trend.
They will milk every iteration of a thousand like they have been since 10k, this iteration is finally running out of steam, another leg down would reignite the engine. But hey, that's just a theory haha. No way to tell the future but I'm still under the impression exchanges are making more money going down than if they were to push the price up at this point in time.
Because the sell order book is thinning out and thinning out and the shorts are opening and opening and the price doesn't move down and down so guess what will happen once it runs out of sellers?

Dude you sound really arrogant lately. Hope it doesn't get you rekt at some point.
Because a BTC bull run can start at any moment 
No one is catching a rocket. They are guessing a bottom, temporary reversal, or DCA.
If you're not afraid of a bit of programming, you can make it yourself using the blockchain.info API:

https://blockchain.info/balance?active=1AJbsFZ64EpEfS5UAjAfcUG8pH8Jn3rn1F|1EzwoHtiXB4iFwedPr49iywjZn2nnekhoj

This shows the balances of two random addresses (not mine) which are included in the URL, separated by |. It's in JSON format which looks terrible but is easy to deal with in Python or Javascript or similar language.
If you only need to pay taxes on trades, why would you need to track where you sent/received bitcoins?

Edit: ah yes there's that US rule about paying people with bitcoin is also taxable, makes sense.
Blockseer.com
25x is extremely high leverage, anything above 10x should be considered high leverage. 100x is just insane. You aren't missing anything obvious, if you time the bottom perfectly then yes, by all means go 25x long with 100% capital. /s (seriously do not do this).

Edit: let me know when this is tho cause I also want to be rich :)
you call x25 a medium leverage? 

In theory, yes. But in practice, maintenance fees and not getting liquidated should be major concern to your future profits.
Yes it really is that simple.

The hard part is not being human during the process. Godspeed. ;)
Yeah, good luck identifying the bottom though. Buying anything in the middle of a dump with 25x leverage is a risky play.

TradingView: add the tickers “BTCUSDLONGS” & “BTCUSDSHORTS” assuming you’re interested in the USD fiat pair
Datamish: https://datamish.com/dashboard/db/btcusd
Tradingview has BTCUSDLONGS and BTCUSDSHORTS charts. Maybe someone has made an indicator library for calculating the ratio but when I want to compare them I usually just look at both simultaneously.

Bfxdata hasn't been working for me for awhile either.
Indicator in Trading View:BITFINEX BTC Margin Traders -Longs vs Shorts
Just kill us quickly please this funding fee is ridiculous 
For shorts, squeeze. For shorters fees.
Yeah they hit at each period. Longs paying shorts or shorts paying longs depending on who is majority.
the main difference is we already double topped at $11.7k (which is the same % as on that chart) 

so it makes you wonder if we're going to test it again or if the market has already been "convinced" it doesn't need to try again

or it could just play out entirely differently
No. Once you create a wallet nothing at all is stored on the blockchain. You just created a public/private key pair. Once the first incoming transaction is happening, your wallet address is recorded on the blockchain as output of that transaction.
No, probably shouldn't be stored anywhere, apart from maybe a piece of paper
Your password is just used for encryption so no.
Because they ate an entire wall put up at 6,750 with one buy.
I went from relieved that I closed out my shorts at 6750 just in time to annoyed. Staying out of position though
You made the mistake of leave your computer
If anyone got squeezed here I'd reckon they either have very little reserves, are over-leveraged or made an aggressive short-entry right on what they thought was breakout in a market that's been really finicky as of late. None of those being good moves to be honest. Now we will see if this is a "bart" or a flag, my money being on the former.
Tell that to anyone who went short on the runup from 1k to 20k. Also I love that you included the Bogdanoffs in that group.
>  Is it ok to enter now and return 2 months later? 

for sure
Capitulation. The shit we’ve all been holding on to for way too long.  It’s time to go, folks. Just fucking take it already so we can move on.
At the consumer level, the problem is that crypto is framed now as the high-risk investment it can be. During the bull run, pa and ma Jones thought it was money for nothing and your Lambo's for free. Many of them got burned. It will take a while before they will be back I fear. The general public is still FUDed and FOMOed by MSM while they should be given better information in a way that is not only understandable to techies. If I would be in control of e.g. an exchange, I would invest in informing the public.
> Do we have enough ~~good news~~ **FUD** coming out to sustain this ~~price~~ **dump**?


I would not call it a double bubble more so as a double bull trap. You could even call it a "sabotaged recovery" if you would like. 

Double bubble implies double capitulation and i don't think we even had a capitulation in bitcoin. It happened in the altcoins (with its "Ripple" effects affecting bitcoin) 

So well, seeing altcoins ratio going up is my main case for being bullish medium term. I firmly believe we are at the bottom yet i won't put my hand in the fire for that, not yet. 
Closed for a 2% profit...
^longing to go long on a long green dong
$500 is a long shot.
He bought. Continue ze domp.
Bitcoin is on a 6 month-ish low. think about it
Isn’t this the bear flag we have been in all day? We have been bouncing off each resistance point/ Support point  pretty religiously 
Not really disappointing at all. Making a beautiful descending triangle.
Homie shorted below 7 lol
god i hope your right. i will be a very rich man if we can just get to the mid 7k
If the resistance breaks, incoming short squeeze and maybe a run to 7k 
Sorry. Is this supposed to be funny?

cool story
> I think the only real buyers for Bitcoin are those who are buying it to buy alts.

The only purpose of alts is to get more BTC, most liquid market.
just look at the charts!

Literally every alt has been crashing way harder then bitcoin since the bear market started. If your story were true then alts should have gone up relative to btc.

Just bought a t-shirt over LN. alts should be very worried.
I kept reading snorting..  stop snorting all the btc you degenerate. No fucking wonder the market's gone to shit. 
It's also clearly a hassle to use punctuation and capitalization. I won't even touch "reshort".
Why do you think they're out and not just waiting for a higher price?
You should start your own youtube channel.
This just in: Bitcoin is 70-ish% off ATH

No clue why people aren’t buying
No, nothing has to trigger buys right now.
I personally agree, I think it's a bit more speculative/subjective than what I was going for in my post though.

Eth has been wrestling with $400 for awhile. I'm not yet convinced it can hold it. Last time it passed it it got up to $420; we'll see what happens.

It's important to remember most alts have already dropped much more than BTC has off the ATH too, so them holding a little stronger now wouldn't be much of a surprise.
When?

Most significant breakouts/turn arounds have been clearly rewarded. When 7.8k bear flag broke? Great return. Short when 11.8k double top confirmed at 8.8 (or from 11.8k when we were rejected from the log ATH resistance)? Great return. Long when 7.2k local low bounced insanely hard? Great return.

It's all about considering the time frame. Obviously I'm not going to buy in until the resistance/support is confirmed broken for the relevant time frame (likely daily, start heavily considering on 4 hr charts).
Maybe those placing aggressive entries but it's been good to me. Taking conservative positions and waiting to see if a 30 minute candle resolves outside of an indicator or resistance before placing an entry has been pretty solid. Anecdotal evidence of course though haha.
Just stopped actively trading and have been hodling. Avg cost is low (2013/2014 entry, like $400). Stress is like 80% lower than having leverage. I look forward to being totally out of the market though, in the next 2 years maybe.
I believe this market is the best to learn, its difficult, chopped and manipulated. If one can trade in this environment and not lose any money (earning some would be best of course), when it comes to a bull market it all should be easier. I started in December and got to 3X my investment in a month (paper profits of course). Since then i got to 30% loss and am now a bit on the profit, but barely.
So for me, learning a lot and not losing nothing is a partial win for now.
I don't see how maximum pain hypothesis can imply anything that doesn't start with a violent bounce upwards here, given the amount of highly leveraged, low entry price shorts. 
Meh. Where was maximum pain throughout 2017? Max pain is just another narrative people apply to suit their viewpoint. Maybe there's something to it on short timeframes and exploiting over-leveraged traders, but on a macro basis, idk.
The only ones capitulating will be the big bears, and max pain will be all theirs. So far I've felt zero pain.
Hrm... I hadn't thought to do that before.

A deterministic wallet derives keys from a single starting point. From the one wallet you have multiple addresses to use for each transaction, and they all point to one single wallet.

Wallet applications sometimes generate keys in a deterministic way.

I'd have to run down how broadly this could be used to associate addresses. It could take me a long time to give you a full and definitive yes or no on this question. I doubt I could give you an answer that I was satisfied with in a short period of time.
the noobs are the people making you rich, you fool. 

If no one FOMO'd and bitcoin grew at a normal rate we'd be at like $200 right now

Who are you to decide who "deserves profits"? 

You're the guy who called shorting evil, huh?

This is the kind of stuff I just...😓 facepalm
When I saw this post I immediately pictured u/DushmanKush and u/SloppySynapses snapping awake in the dead of night as every single goddamn alarm in their bunkers went off at once.

(Note: please don't ruin this imagery by telling me it's like midday where you guys are or whatever.)
No. Just stop. You're not some kind of visionary for "believing in Bitcoin" (aka keeping it on a usb for a few years without touching it and believing you deserve to get rich from it)
>They FOMO in with market orders and create volatility and dump out at the first sign of a short term top

...

> providing liquidity
I haven't read what WhaleCalls has said about it but I will say that I've spent over 10 hours attempting to integrate long and short data into a trading bot and was unable to improve existing bots nor create a new bot using the data.  It seems undeniable that it can be used to get trader sentiment but I would not take a trade off it.
Although I am a believer that it is more reliable or 'strong' when you get both in combination, the right answer is the bodies of the candle when looking at RSI divergence.

RSI is calculated using open/close.  Wicks are totally ignored for RSI.  RSI Divergence arguably should be charted using a linear chart (as opposed to candles), but I am too lazy to change it to linear and I like to note the wicks.

Some people will say that trendlines also play a role.  Ie, if the trendline lines up with bodies then bodies matter more, if the trendline lines up with wick tips then wicks matter more.  But I do not buy that.  I feel like those people have a misunderstanding of RSI.  They place too much importance on trendlines and we can see in the last few months (since institutional investors have taken to market making instead of us little fish having our way) trendlines are of very little importance.

Divergence Cheat Sheet https://i.imgur.com/wVw4L6h.png

I have some more resources re: RSI if you are interested you can PM me.
For RSI, bodies is correct. RSI is calculated using the open/close price of candles so using wicks is not the way to go - when the price was actually down at the wick the RSI would have been much lower than what it closed at.
Should've but not all problems can wait a week.
And what are your thoughts on leaving a long open?
I'm conflicted.  If a short squeeze seems too obvious of an outcome, then it could potentially do the opposite.  But what if the opposite of a short squeeze seems too obvious?  Does it go back to making a short squeeze the potential outcome?  My head hurts.
they had lots of issues lately. the funding interface is horrible.
Anything could be a black swan event.
the tradeoff is between low liquidity/not working site/bad trade UI vs some how bad reputation/best trade UI in the sector/best liquidity
Some people are injecting capital just to maintain the price daily for BTC mining, right?

Idk, I'm confused overall. Sentiment in here, on Twitter, YouTube, mostly says down into the deep dark bear. I am surprised that we have not fallen thus far, makes me wonder of something like this is not in play.

Whatever, I don't know shit.
Trading ranges typically decrease in volume over time. Selling/buying climaxes (typically the beginning of a trading range) show a spike in volume, and tests against the edge of the range, or wyckoff springs, show volume spikes as well but lesser than the initial climax. So the volume seems to fit decently well so far.
Meh, this isn't a science. These are just diagrams.
That is not exactly true since longs are naturally much more resilent than shorts. longs failling to pull the price out does not matter that much since a lot of people do them long term. Shorts on the other hand (usually) get cashed out at the first sign of a reversal.
100$ drop is <2%. I think given the range bound action bulls and bears are just reacting to every small price move. Yesterday, we broke 6650$ and today we are back unable to break 6800$ - it's a real struggle on both sides. 
!remindme 2 hours
Most people in this sub have probably never seen a cascading liquidation meltdown in spot, since we haven't seen one since the final dump from $300 to $160. 

It's pretty horrifying, and the action on okex is pretty indicative of how that might play out here *if* the market does make a confident push below $6,000. 


Can anyone share a chart of OKEX from that time period?  I only knew about that meltdown based on the comments here and never looked.  cryptowat.ch doesn't seem to show it.
I never said I was bullish. Just that I'm uncertain. 

I'm not suggesting the market is suddenly going to blast off to $10K. 

It's just hovering for now. Which is never a particularly good time to be holding a position or entering a new one. 
Agreed..Specifically left out that part as a quick scan through news clippings states that even though they got internal approval over the past few months, the fund managers are yet to make a trade..if that is a fib, then that is the age old tactic of positioning first then publicity.. 
Thanks! Glad it helped :)
I personally believe that these big shots don't tell us when they are moving in. I believe they are already in(hence the crash) and now stating it publicly as they feel it's their entry point and need fresh money to flown back in.
Soros jumps into a trade when he believes the market trend is following an incorrect assumption..here, it's us believing it's digital gold. If he disagrees, he'd believe the trend will unravel over time and BTC will come down to the true value.  

The other angle is, as you stated, a lower price point..If he does short, it won't be for a slightly lower price thats for sure!

I would tend more to the long bit as its a little too obvious he'd the kinda guy to short something like BTC esp. since he declared something to that effect in Dec/Jan..plus it would fall into his strategy of coming in 'early' into a relatively new currency/asset that's the global underdog..R/R is atractive on a 18-24 month horizon  
You have absolutely 0 clue what institutional money is doing. Why pretend you do? 
He also owns a bunch of Caesars Entertainment. Crypto and casinos will go together like peas and carrots imo. 
Which wedge... could you chart it so I know what you are referencing? 
[deleted]
major short squeeze incoming?
Low lev longs are basically impossible to squeeze so not that astounding.
The only data we have is the amount of open shorts. If somebody hedges his BTC and the price climbes he has 2 options to avoid getting liquidated: 1. He must transfer all his BTC to the exchange and accepts to give away his whole stack for his hedges price and 2. He accepts to make a loss with his trading stack on the exchange. Regarding an upwards movements to and above 8k would be a mid\-term trend reversal and I doubt all the hedgers want to sit only in fiat.
Clearly a Soros throw away account. :-p
A market buy of 10k Bitcoins should make it ;\) [https://imgur.com/a/FNHXT](https://imgur.com/a/FNHXT)

6600 held, and I anticipate we may test it again but fall through momentarily
You base this on the previous retrace from the flag before touching it again? Could be or we could go straight to 6700, I'll evaluate in a few hours!
All really good points, especially about how there were plenty of fakeouts. 

My main point, which I didn't explain well in my first comment, is that when this sub's sentiment flies in the face of the market sentiment is when it's normally wrong.

Mainly because the majority of this sub seems to be greener- they tend to be the last to jump on a trend. 

It does get confusing though- when we were at the top, almost all of the better traders and LTHs could see it coming and hedged or shorted above $13k at some point. So it depends on which majority we're paying attention to.


> We've reached a point where I suspect those who wanted to sell probably already have by now

There was hardly a point where wicks had that look of panic in them. All the way down it was calm procession of fairly rational selling by people who weren't in too much of a hurry. Then that just kinda dried up eventually and a bunch of hodlers remained, no matter how much they were battered there wasn't anything which would bring in that panic. BCH floppening FUD had so much more  panic in it then anything in this whole trend so far.

Perhaps it's to come. Perhaps we see something that in hindsight is obvious capitulation and panic selling.

> sideways

Has the same effect on TA and positions in the end. 
Oh yes, I just mean eventually when it happens. Bitcoin doesn't go sideways forever, it's going to ramp up into a parabolic move one way or the other. 
Thanks mate :) After seeing what being emotional does to my wallet I try my best to remain level headed
I mainly mean greener traders and investors actually. Sentiment seems fairly neutral leaning bearish among more experienced ones
Every day that goes by that we sit here I become more and more unsure that we're going lower. 

I'm not exiting simply because nothing is really happening and my price targets haven't been hit yet. Most of this movement lately is incredibly choppy and inconsistent and I'm hesitant to take it seriously, so to speak. a move past $7500 and a move below $6500 are all that really matter right now, until then I say people long from $6.6k down should hold open, people short above $7.3k should hold open
....and more will keep coming. The crypto space is really evolving, even through the bear market. It's actually way more than 3, right? KNC, REQ, Maker, Golem, and I know I'm missing a few.

I've moved half of my bitcoin stack over to ETH. I'm a BTC holder since 2013, but the Bitcoin Cash/Core squabbling going on while ETH keeps innovating and growing finally made me switch over.

That's not a valid bullish case. Firstly, the supply is greater than when the price was at 19k, and secondly, I could just retort that ANY supply was bearish
Fair enough about the long term support that just happens to be sitting a little below us at 6.5k now, but weren't we at the low 6.4k's last week? 
So you're tellin' me there's a chance.

ʕ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°ʔ
At first I thought that was stupid, but honestly not a bad suggestion. Thank you, I'll check it out. Can't hurt. 
This. The long term TA doesn't change fast enough for people to be constantly commenting on it and short term right now is a gigantic question mark with super tight movements. The markets just a waiting game atm.
Everyone will say the breakout (up or down) was predictable after the fact.

My guess is down, but I'm not going to part with a single satoshi betting on it.
That isn't necessarily bullish. A massive 20-30x bubble pop would push us into low RSI territory.
I think we're gonna make it
'Exchanges' is certainly a great answer to 'çui bono?'
both bubbles actually. she wouldn't let me buy at 30$
Howdy! I lurk here because people actually seem to put skin into their analysis - - also like the low-key vibe to learn in.

we all started somewhere 
I see what you are saying, but if you have good reasoning/ta/analysis behind ur trade, you can say its solid, even if it does end up going the other way. It was a solid plan, even if it fails, you know? 
If you have a clear strategy that is sound, it will be way more easy to be patient and to manage risk/emotion!
manual stops are way better to prevent the fake breakouts from getting you, but I guess just open a smaller position and have the stops lower.
Basically. The 4 hr candle closes in 2 min (and obviously the 1 hr candle too). The current high wicks of the 4 hr and 1 hr candles line up with the bear flag's boundaries almost perfectly. Makes me a bit more confident that we're currently in a flag (still could obviously break in either direction).
I was referring to bitfinex open shorts. Would also be interested if you can see the bitmex stats anywhere.
And hate for central banks, and Shitposting autistic memes? :) 
hahaha. I have a colleague who always say that Bitcoin is built around speculation and there is no intrinsic value to it (which is a whole new topic to debate on), what I tell him is that you have never tried trading Bitcoin, try it once and then we'll talk. He's getting convinced day by day to invest small portion of his dispensable income. Call it a trap but he will like it. 
Yo dude I have a question to ask. I have a friend who has an old electrum wallet with 1btc in there but he's missing one word (it the old 12 word seeds so we have 11/12 words). Pretty sure I can write a python script to recover it but my programming is way out of practice. Do you have anything at hand for this? I can give you .1btc for the help if we can recover it(but I can't give you the words because he's paranoid). If not do you have some resources at hand I can use to write it?
I think you are very clear about what you are doing, which is absolute necessary, you know what you need to do and having that sense of realization is really important in a market like this. 

> think we'll see at least a last capitulation leg down

I thought exactly the same during the last dip from almost 7200. Now I don't. It's will play out as either you being right or myself. haha. But yeah, once we both know the direction, I think we will go in together for certain.

>prefer to try to let my longs run in case a bull run is kickstarted somehow

This is wise of you, you never know what might happen the next minute! 




> I'm cautious long or short but prefer to try to let my longs run in case a bull run is kickstarted somehow, whereas I don't hesitate to take profits quickly on shorts if I don't have a super high entry.

excellent strategy imo


I can't be sure of 2020 but yeah I agree with you on $6K ish being the bottom which is here to stay.
+1. I just don't think it has the legs to go above 8K right now and feel we need to break below $6K to incite the FOMO needed for another rally. Anything below $5K to me spells trouble so hopefully we don't get there. Sure we're setting higher lows atm but the lower highs with low volume to me is the writing on the wall that like tells me BTC is neither is extremely under or overvalued. Not going off any TA since I barely go on tradingview so take it for what its worth.
So this is the benefit of being moderator. Inside senitment info :D
> I think we are just riding a strong long term support that has been there for 6 months.


That support is epic, my thoughts are also on miners, is it possible that they are keeping this price to keep mining profitable?
Im back in, forgive my weakness fellow bears :(

OK not yet, but im trying to re-enter slightly higher to pay the funding fees.
It is merely a delay. Continue paying homage. Bless you.
Tbh i pay much closer attention to DonAlt's charts than to Sven. Sven mostly just paints the macro picture and i cant resist the swing trades. 
Mathematically? Or sentiment wise? what numbers are you looking at? 
Well you can take it like this:
If we go above 6800 (possible long to 7k) - above 7k (possible long to 7600), etc.
The same goes if 6500 fails, possible short to 6000.
Still up x10 (and more) from $400, so this is how i give my analysis.
Timeframe is a big factor, on the very short term we have some bullish momentum, but on the medium/longer term it is still a bearish trend.
> Only in crypto a $1000 spread (15%) is stable lol.

Haha yes. We've been spoiled with generous volatility.
I used to think otherwise, but now I begin to think 6500 is not a bad place to slowly start DCAing for LT holders. And there is evidence that quite a few people are doing that (on ETH too) Good luck!
thats pretty much where I'm at. certainly has been a brutal sack of weeks though 
Sure, but if the downswing does not come, they are paying interest, and if an upswing comes, they are losing. When shorts eventually close, they will have to buy back the coins they are short, so the larger the amount of open shorts is, the more potential rebuying there is.
edit:seemed wrong



Around 7100. Let's see if he is right again, he seems to be pretty on fire.
7100
Yes.

Cover is the proper term for shorts, but you can also use close as a generic term for closing off a position.
Tbh I think there's a decent chance that this is some insider trading and bulls are about to get destroyed. We've had shorts inexplicably skyrocketing like that right before the "bitfinex subpoenad by cftc"  FUD on Bloomberg. Maybe it was just a coincidence back then, idk. But I'm hoping for the best.
easier to defend 6k with too much at stake for the ecosystem ( exchanges, investors, holders, altcoin projects, ...)
I suppose few Devs/Dapps precludes hearing about an arbitrary developer's contract (an isolated object) bug.

It hasn't been perfect https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures#CVE-2010-5139 
well eth coding is a lot more complex and most fuck ups have been due to the users, not the eth developers themselves 
The thought did hit me, but it seems too hopiumish that someone would do that when the market is as bearish as it has ever been.
Yes, but thats nothing new though - this instant replenishment of BTC on funding is new. Normally we would've run out of funding a long time ago and we would get short squeezes. Now it seems someone is trying to delay/kill the short squeezes before they even start. I might just be paranoid and more people know about it now though. But that doesn't explain why the funding is so cheap.
> being a coin maximalist is extremley stupid

Why do you think that ?

I'm not exactly bullish but what I'm seeing is a trendline that we broke through at 5k and held at 5.5k, 6k, which we are now sitting on.  Not sure how strong it is really but so far there hasnt been much attempt to break into all these orders around 6.5k and with shorts at ath and still not even close to breaking that resistance it's hard to really say which way this will go...  

pretty much just have to wait for these whales to decide for us plebs, and really are any whales going to want to try dumping into it when they may have a hard time filling up their huge orders slightly lower?


so yeah I'm just flat atm but slightly optimistic
What I'm seeing is some upward momentum on short-term MACD (edit: 2h, 3h, 4h), and dumps being fairly violently rejected (edit: on microscale). These are weak indicators that matter to me, and without something stronger to go on enough to put in for a scalp and quit the short. I personally put no trust in fractals, and my opinion is that the market doesn't either to such a degree that I should. 

Also I wouldn't categorize myself as bullish, I was vehemently bearish throughout the latest pump.
Well, yes, as long as you don't confuse it for being finicky or easily spooked. I did state it was a scalp and my target was lower than when I actually closed. Since I'm no longer reasonably certain of the direction, the best position is no position.
> Sellers are exhausted, buyers are standoffish due to so much downward movement.

Concise, succinct!
>I've heard people say that they're waiting for sub\-5000 to buy back in, so that's where I expect the next bounce to happen.

Exactly why I think it wont happen. I think we dont get into this despair selling, because so many expect this.
> I don't even know how many times I've heard people say that they're waiting for sub-5000 to buy back in

 BTC too hears them and will accommodate their patience. The dude abides.
Of course it's speculative, but the data is there. 60% of Americans have heard of bitcoin, 90% of South Koreans have as well.

This is the point I've been trying  to make as to why $20k was possibly "the top". Of course it sounds ridiculous because every person so far who has called the top has been very, very wrong.

but when you're getting to numbers like 60% of Americans and 90% of South Koreans...it makes you really wonder who's going to carry this higher without a fundamental shift in usage? 

A very large part of bitcoin's speculative value is the fact that it so consistently moons and never seems to die. This perception is important- and it has always been backed by room to grow- more and more people hearing about it. What happens when people realize there is no one left to buy? Do prices stabilize? Or does the whole thing collapse upon itself over time? 
ye well, if im looking at the chart of finex id like to see the orderbook there
Yeah for take profits definitely set limits.  For stop losses alarms can be better.  Because in the former knives are desirable but not for the latter.
I have tight stops and don't wanna get chopped out by random wicks but thinking about it now, probably better to have profit take hard set and then alarms for stop losses as the guy below said
**Some people are banking that exchanges will qualify as the intermediary/facilitator since that is the only hope but good luck with that.

Are there restrictions for deferred and reverse exchanges?
It is important to know that taking control of cash or other proceeds before the exchange is complete may disqualify the entire transaction from like-kind exchange treatment and make ALL gain immediately taxable.

If cash or other proceeds that are not like-kind property are received at the conclusion of the exchange, the transaction will still qualify as a like-kind exchange.  Gain may be taxable, but only to the extent of the proceeds that are not like-kind property.

One way to avoid premature receipt of cash or other proceeds is to use a qualified intermediary or other exchange facilitator to hold those proceeds until the exchange is complete.

You can not act as your own facilitator. In addition, your agent (including your real estate agent or broker, investment banker or broker, accountant, attorney, employee or anyone who has worked for you in those capacities within the previous two years) can not act as your facilitator.

Be careful in your selection of a qualified intermediary as there have been recent incidents of intermediaries declaring bankruptcy or otherwise being unable to meet their contractual obligations to the taxpayer.  These situations have resulted in taxpayers not meeting the strict timelines set for a deferred or reverse exchange, thereby disqualifying the transaction from Section 1031 deferral of gain.  The gain may be taxable in the current year while any losses the taxpayer suffered would be considered under separate code sections.
I would know just as much had I not read this comment 
Also possible. All this Barting feels very manipulated. 
Not sure yet. I did well sticking to my plan and re-shorting higher to catch most of the 9th April drop. Guess it will depend on what the breakout up to 7K looks like (if one happens).

There surely has to be a pretty large breakup/breakdown sometime this week and I'd like to avoid doubling down on the wrong direction if it turns out the market has suddenly found some real bull conviction (which tbh I find hard to believe right now sans some major fundamental news announcement).
There’s no source. These are just opinions masquerading as analysis.
The whole maximum pain thing has been repeated so often that I honestly just believed it without ever giving it a second thought, but come to think of it... maybe we don't need maximum pain.
It's a part of the bubble cycle that repeats itself over and over again. Bubbles can't happen repeatedly without time to refresh because people need to forget the pain and the mistakes they made to let it get that out of hand
> 'maximum pain'

When you push a non-linear system it may demonstrate erratic behaviour before reaching equilibrium again. The positions themselves become the fuel for these swings, soon as that butterfly flaps it's wings the whole system goes nuts.

`next year's population = r * this year's population * (1 - this year's population)`

> One biologist, Robert May, decided to see what would happen to the equation as the growth rate value changes. At low values of the
growth rate, the population would settle down to a single number. For instance, if the growth rate value is 2.7, the population will settle down to .6292. As the growth rate increased,
the final population would increase as well. Then, something weird happened. As soon as the growth rate passed 3, the line broke in
two. Instead of settling down to a single population, it would jump between two different populations. It would be one value for
one year, go to another value the next year, then repeat the cycle forever.

> Is this necessary?

Not necessarily. We take examples of bitcoin's price action in the past. I think it's important to evaluate what you consider to be the maximum pain. Maximum pain isn't implying bitcoin shoots straight to lower ks and stagnates there never comes back for years. I feel like that's what new traders would think cuz all they think about is price. Maximum pain would be lots of unreliable choppy movements, lots of trapping, lack of volume etc etc - just dead man. God damn goblin town because all of the plebs either are hopeless cuz they lost money on bitcoin or they just smirk atchya like they know it better by not understanding bitcoin when you run into the topic (feel familiar?).

> Everyone keeps repeating this but I'd like to know if this is a verifiable pattern, and if so, in what circumstances and sectors?

Yes, bitcoin traders have seen this before. Even if you are a new trader - go back to last bubble and inspect chart 4hr by 4hr and see how it ended up playing out. Try taking positions - it will be a good exercise. I think you will see what those everyone mean.

I don't know yet, the number of shorts oh boy... when they start to close it will be a green dildo of mercy
exactly this, a stop around 6.4 would be good, a touch to 6.4 and we might really go down
Yes, what’s your target/ what are you looking to close your long at? 7.2k is crazy resistance and last run up we hit 7199 and got rejected. 

I would have felt more comfortable shorting over 6.9k-7k but this bear flag is making me think we are gonna be put back into the 6750 range. 

And thank you. I’ve been successful on my first 4 trades with a 1-4% profit on every trade. I’m bound to get burnt eventually ( knock on wood ) but so far I’m taking it slow and trade by trade 
I'm worried there are a lot of people in your situation 
While yes, I would think whatever game they are playing would have a set start and end time that isn't touching every time zone
They don’t need to eat tonight
Why do you make that guarantee? On April 10th of 2017, woulda you guaranteed us never hitting 10k by the end of the year? Probably... I think 99% woulda.

If something came out like amazon accepting bitcoin... the price would go way up. Maybe not 35k... but certainly would turn the market bullish again.

This is only one small example of many that could instantly convert the market to extremely bullish once again.
Oh boy! Someone ought to put this in their calendar...
Selling her would be aggressive, now renting her out for 24 hour intervals is more realistic. Residual income 
Champ!

> I would shave my head and grow a beard

you would be one of them.
This expresses actual hate. Please don't go there, not even when you're joking around.
I think so too, but accumulation is happening and I definitely think 12k happens before 3k would
I agree
To sub 3k it's another 60% drop. Never.
I assume strong shorts won't close at least until a higher high. 
You understood wrong they are not going to save any shit they know it will rise again they are entering now investing at low prices, they wont miss the opportunity to make profit to later manipulate the market at least thats what soros is going to do
Do you really think it’s worth their while to short? Just because it’s valuation is in the hundreds of billions doesn’t mean they can make that much shorting it.
> Bears took us from 20k to 6.5k and will probably bring us to 5k soon. 

That was bulls over exuberance and betting on risk free money. It's the counter-party which is the real driving force of that action.

Everyone must get rekt.
Whatever makes you sleep at night. Bulls took us to 20k from 6K. Nothing delusional about making stacks going with the trend.

See. That argument is poor. Just, be prepared for a reversal when we are hitting such lows. 
Yep I'm reading a lot of theories that exchanges=whales which would make total sense. Companies like GDAX and Gemini are based in the US where regulations and punishments can be far more stricter so maybe they are responding to low volume by raising trading fees but in the wild west world with no regulations, companies like Finex can do whatever they want to create volume for more fees.
They’re running out of steam because day trading is slowing down. They can do this indefinitely if there’s constantly day traders feeding them free coins. 
Buyers should have no problem running up the price to a higher high at 7.3 then. Sell side order books do look thin so go ahead and buy it up, make me close my short. 
Same can be said of a dump.
I'm definitely a noob, just started using bitmex and am trying to get a feel for it by reading the FAQ and using very small amounts/low leverage. 

Noob question:

I see that you can update your leverage - I'm a bit confused, does this update apply to the initial contract? So if I buy at 6500 says and my liquidation point is at 6300. If a week later the price is at 6700 and I'm confident we're not revisiting 6500, I can update my leverage to a higher amount, pushing my liquidation point to, say, just under 6500? And the new leverage amount applies to prior gains? Or only future gains? I feel like I'm completely misunderstanding.
> you call x25 a medium leverage?

it's a tell that i'm going to get liquidated in the near future :p
Ha! If only we could turn off the amygdala while trading.
growing and growing. almost 38k shorts now: [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BITFINEX:BTCUSDSHORTS](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BITFINEX:BTCUSDSHORTS)
Thanks! Super helpful.
Hey, I had a quick followup question, does the Y-axis refer to $1000 dollars equivalent shorted? IE we currently have 37 million in short positions and 32 million in longs?
So let's say it oscillates 50/50 between longs and shorts (let's say one period closes short, one closes long) I'm only paying interest (0.05% of my USD loan?) 1 out of every 2 periods, correct?
Must have been hidden then. If the big guys are putting hidden sell walls is it bullish or bearish?
I had my first sell at 6875 but got bull-fudded and moved it to 6915. It would have filled on the wick....RIP
I'm supposed to be on vacation lol. Been trying to stick to 1 trade a day but made like 4 swing trades instead because I'm a trading addict.
Oh, some did get sqeezed... Liquidated short on XBTUSD: Buy 2,627,858 @ 6813 💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯🔥⚡ 
anyone who shorted just sold. They didnt lose fiat unless they sold more than they owned (leverage) or fomod in in typical buy high, sell low fashion
Exactly. It's not healthy to hodl it in.
Exactly. Until it gets to 20k again and there's favourable msm media coverage, the average person won't give a shit.
Short term it means we have a bit more pain ahead but at least it gives us more time to accumulate more coin 
it's like a double edged sword at this point.  The more it goes down, the less attractive it seems, but the higher it goes up, the more it seems like people who got burned once could get burned again, so that's unattractive too.  It will probably take a lot of time (years) for the bubble to be erased from memory.  The reason that the alts had such a bull run in 2017/early 2018 is because they were in uncharted territory, where irrational investors saw no ceiling.  I said back in December that once this dips, there probably won't be another bull run like it for quite a long time.  I hope I'm wrong.
We are in a downtrend. Not in an ascending one. If there is no reason for it to go up, then it will go down. Such is life. 

Of course a bottom could pop up every time. But dont think like that or you are going to get turnt into beef sooner or later. 

I closed my long because of this post. Crazy how by reading this subreddit it really influences your decisions. If I hadn’t checked this thread I would have led it ride. We’ll see how it plays out.
I am already on a long for the past two days, holding on to it until at least 0900 UTC in the morning.
Indeed it is. However, it doesn't take more than 10-15 minutes to change the behavior and emotions of the traders. 

I could very well be wrong, but I can sense this kind of jump in the next 24 hours (10%-30% probability).
I think most people are seeing a symmetric triangle.  Either one has similar prognosis anyway.
Homie is sitting in fiat wanting cheap coins
lol based on what are you sure there is going to be a shorts squeeze? 
There are more longs being opened on Bitmex the last hour than shorts. and price is struggling.
People won't speculate on Bitcoin?

The entire market is complete speculation... 
Alts have better marketing that bitcoin, they announce partnership with brands that the public recognizes unlike bitcoin which has the "drug money" branding. And they have greater potential for speculative growth. Why people invest in crypto? They want the highest returns. Bitcoin is expensive per unit (a psychological barrier) and no one see it to go 10X in value in any foreseeable future. New investors are asking me about alts (even ethereum is losing the spotlight), not btc. Hence my hunch that most of real buyers want BTC to buy alts in various exchanges, not to invest in BTC.
A bold (and incorrect) generalisation to make, didn't realise you were the global crypto spokesperson. 

I've done well enough riding alt pumps and jumping in and out in short time frames, never with the intention of accumulating BTC.
That what an old school trader thinks. New ones want to moon and they don't see BTC doing so. And branding is important, BTC is still "drug money" and "a bubble", while alts are announcing partnership with household names.
As long as they don't dump to  lower price its all good.
>waiting for a higher price?

Yeah I do not think they are going to come back to dump at the same prices.

I also think there are plenty of new buyers waiting to get into the markets once its clear.
the bear whale yesterday scared them a lot. needs another day or so...
> I believe this market is the best to learn, its difficult, chopped and manipulated. If one can trade in this environment and not lose any money (earning some would be best of course), when it comes to a bull market it all should be easier.

So much this. It's quite funny and tragic in a way, how a lot of the cool "crypto investors" with 8k cameras and youtube channels now lost most of their popularity, since they did not have a classical trading background and basically just bought what was hyped and eventualy their picks made a lot of gains

I recommend every one who wants to trade crypto to read real books like Market Wizards, Reminiscence of A stock operator or the more philosophical ones like Antifragile and Misbehaving

And here is a quote from Jesse Livermore that fits quite well

>"I learned early that there is nothing new in Wall Street. There can’t be because speculation is as old as the hills. Whatever happens in the stock market today has happened before and will happen again. I’ve never forgotten that. "

This market won't necessarily make it 'easier' to trade in a bull market. It can be very difficult to 'believe' a strong bull trend after spending a while in this choppy dumpy bullshit and end up closing positions too early / entering shorts too eagerly etc. 

If / when we do go in a long-term uptrend again, folks are gonna need to head into it with a completely new mindset and trading approach. 
Right noobs have caused the big rise LOL WRONG! You don't even know who is in these markets. 
OMG, this is the funniest shit I've read all month.
my alarms for hodl comments are louder than my price alarms 
They replied at exactly the same time? Perfect.

And in your head, does bunker = moms basement? =) 
Yep I'm sure they will be paged by oligarchs' skynet soon.
Jokes on you. He also has garage fully stocked with beanie babies.
People are still coming down on you, but I see that you've really stepped up your game this month. Don't let the haters get you down.

(The above is kinda a personal attack, though...)
Never said that .. but im not dumping out at the first sign of a correction and yelling fud every chance I get.
providing liquidity is NOT market orders ! jesus people fk off
im building a bot to follow REKTs from bitmex and it is working great, when short get liquidated he enter state of buy mode and buy, and the opposite is true when long get liquidated he sells once the price go down.
pretty much this but with over 2 years of data to prove it.
So when there are more shorts the bot should buy and vice versa?
Thank you for this cheat sheet! Every time I see a possible divergence I have to google it to make sure it actually is a divergence, because I keep forgetting which is which.
Thanks joyrider, great sheet.
I did that when Kraken had their maintenance and lost a fair chunk of money.
This actually makes me want to close my short and makes me regret closing my long. 

Considering Finex has some of the largest players when it comes to trading, I see no reason for people that are highly leveraged or have large trade opens on shorts not to close out. 

But yet, it could do the opposite of what people expect because it’s Bitcoin 
Only a few options actually.

- exchange get's hacked/exitscams. 
- a country bans/regulates bitcoin
- bitcoin protocol/encryption get's broken

Anything I forgot?
There's better than that and you know it. And please don't consider USDT liquidity when the shit hits their fan. Which it might if things go slightly wrong.
It’s just the annoying slow bleed. What took 9 days the first time 11k-6k has taken over a month this time 
This is true, shorts are inherently more skittish than longs. 

That said, I think many here are overconfident in an impending short squeeze. An overabundance of shorts could quite simply be an indicator of general market sentiment. It's not a given that they are "wrong" just because there's a lot of them.

You can kind of see it on the 1 hour, but the lower time frames aren't visible (at least on the default settings I use)

Chewtoy says it is going to the moon, I'm all in long x100 :D
Its all a rich mans trick
if he would short Bitcoin \(and does not own them\) we would see it in the data. 4k got shorted here, that corresponds to 27M USD, not so much for a mister Soros. 
Hey, maybe /u/kanzen22 is an institutional investor.


[This one](https://www.tradingview.com/x/v8HbDoTX/)
the 6500 range, bottom for like 4 months ?
Well it is the bottom (5.8-6) for the last 3 months so its a fair point. Although, its only a bottom until its not.
its a bottom between 11K and 3K
I’m just comparing this dip to the one from February where longs were devastated but not so much now
Can confirm. Still sitting on one from $7.3 and not terribly worried about it.
I heard bittrex does dollars to tethers for big buyers
holy moly! That is actually crazy. 
Yes. I’m brand new to TA so what I see it’s most likely completely wrong. But I feel like I have a general Idea

Closed my Long at 6851 and Opened a short at 6839. 
> hedged or shorted above $13k at some point

Man RJ hedged the top and was getting paid interest half the way down. A few people made really prudent moves like that and without jumping the gun either.

> So it depends on which majority we're paying attention to.

Don't mind me I'll just contrarian the contrarian contrarians, it's Socrates all the way down ;)
where is your price target to close your short?
It depends on when and what you compare with. How is any supply is bearish when usd supply is non-zero.
All of those got rejected very strongly. As long as 2 consecutive 4h candles stay there i don't consider it violated. 
Lmk what you found. 
It is bullish. it means it increases likelyhood to go up . So its bullish. It doesnt enforce it, though. 
>she wouldn't let me buy at 30$

You mean Ex-wife?
Me too, I’m hoping to invest one day when my life’s in a better place and I scour through all the crypto subs but this one seems more down to earth than the others, even if it does make me jealous😂
I agree with this, and tbh its way easier to trade with 10$ then it is with 1000, 100000, etc etc. meaning you can trade fearlessly and without emotions, so youl probably see great success. Watch out that might get you hooked tho lol
There's no fees on GDAX?  Take my money!  I have some BTC sitting in Coinbase that maybe I could play with.  Do I need to create a new account on GDAX and then transfer?  Sorry for the N00b question.
Good point.  I consider those cases to be "no regrets" situations.
I usually set stops below support, so hard to get faked out, but it does happen
I think you were right on the money on this one. As well as the bearish failure swing on the 15 and 30min
Yeah, I can do this. Jist started writing this.

Just PM me
I agree with both of you unless we take a dip down to 4.8K which would cause a violent swing back up to where we are now, resulting in no discernible difference in the long term. 
How does going below $6k ‘incite FOMO’? I think it is the opposite - it needs to rise above $7k to stimulate fear of missing out - it is provoked by a creeping rise not a further continuation of the bleed. 
Backstage pass! Bling bling!
and what do they do when they need to sell? hope that people start buying? 
[deleted]
i hope he is right this time again, but doesn't 7100 look very optimistic right now in a short term? 
It feels like either there is big news which will create a price drop, or there will be a clear bull market initiated by a massive short squeeze.  I don't even think it will matter right now if leveraged longs pile in, although I would prefer not to see that happen.  The cash bid is huge just below this price level.  I agree that there have been several situations similar to this where there was news which either explained the short selling beforehand or simply bailed them out....
Wouldn't that Bloomberg news be the exlaination for shorts skyrocketing? 
Give it a couple of days for the FOMO longs to pile in and then can cause them pain.
last one reported 2014-07-07... why none going after $100B+ bounty?
at the end of the day, nobody wants this to go to zero in a day or two.

the big players want to squeeze as much as they can and there is money to be made in both directions.

i am sure we will see 3k but it will take months.
Why do you think it was 3K coins? Why would someone with access to 3000BTC try and push the price down? 
becasue the reasons I wrote. any more specific one you think don't make sense?
There's no need to be bullish to believe that shorts squeezes are a real thing.
What are your strong indicators? I watch MACD, RSI, EMA, SMA, SRSI, BBANDS etc...
Alright, I thought it was being easily spooked, see a lot of that, your reasoning make sense. 
Why? The fact that it goes against the norm isn't really a good reason in my opinion. You might as well flip a coin.

I don't think there's been nearly enough capitulation yet. Usually, when you think it's as bad as it can get, it gets just a little worse. That's how it felt in February just prior to the bounce. That's what I'm expecting (at a lower price) this time.
there are also a lot of people saying that they are ready to buy at sub-8k and look at where we are right now
Valid points. However, I don't think awareness so much as accessability and ease of use is the answer to your question. Until we get to the point where the average Joe can invest a fraction of his paycheck into a crypto investment account with the same ease he can for traditional assets, I think we're going to see this entire ecosystem rapidly growing. 
"heard of" and "have bought" are very different percentages
60% have heard of Bitcoin, how many own any substantial amount? 1-3%?
You're assuming most have made up their minds. There could be enough sideline money to get the market to a certain point for fomo to kick in again but this time it will have access to all these people who might have heard about it but haven't yet made up their minds until greed takes over. By then the market will be in a better place in terms of adoption, use cases, and overall infrastructure. Always nice to balance viewpoints with a little hopium.
I didn't buy bitcoin the 1st, 2nd or 10th time I heard about it
That's fair. Based on the general vibe I got from the chat, I thought it might be useful to some people.
So news on the television? 
Current limits are taking profits just under 6900 (30%), 7000 (30%), 7100 (15%), and 7200 (15%).  The remaining 10% will decide later.  If we go past 7200, it'll help keep my CA down a little bit as I add to the position. 
Whenever Bitcoin embarks on these big rallies that tower above the previous ATH, the price crashes and need time to recover. I think we've seen this happen three times before. With the rally to $30 in June of 2011, with the rally to $220 in April of 2013, and the rally to $1200 in November of 2013. I'm going off of the prices in [bitcoin Average](bitcoinaverage.com/en/bitcoin-price/btc-to-usd), more or less. So, for the first rally to $30 and subsequent crash, it took about a year and a half to recover to $30 again. With the rally to $220 and subsequent crash, it took about 8 months to recover to and past $220. And **three Years and three months** for us to recover from the crash off of $1200. 

I think it'll take to at least 2019 to recover back to $20k. Then... the sky's the limit. I have no idea how high we can fly after we go past 20K one again.
RemindMe! 8 months "did bitcoin reach 35k?"
Brb, seeing if I can get a pimp cane on Amazon prime
Maybe that's the idea. They won't know who's a hostage.
I'm on the sidelines still waiting for a long term entry instead of just scalping here and there but I don't want to see $3K simply because that could mean lots of trouble in crypto space and could mean beginning of the end of 4 digit bitcoin. With that being said I don't expect it to ever fall that low.
I fail to imagine a scenario where we would break out of the downtrend line from 19k to go back below it afterwards and return to 3K.
Yesterday you said you thought the bottom was in? What made you change your mind?
i would say we are lucky if it doesn't go below 3000.

Were you here during the 2014/2015 bear market? it went from 1250 to 160.

I am a long term bull but also a realist and bitcoin always goes for maximum pain.




If anything you just reaffirmed my argument. Anyone longing the bullrun from 6k to 20k in 2017 has become filthy rich. Anyone shorting this bear trend has become filthy rich. What's not to understand?
They weren't this thin during the last few runs to 7.2. 
Holding bags is less stressful than moon gazing...
contracts determine positions size, leverage just tells you how much money you're putting on the line, it determines your liquidation point 
Sorry mate, can't answer that cause I don't know, I use the fixed leverage on poloniex...but why don't you comment here and I'm sure someone will answer, good luck!
sorry if these are noob questions, i've just started testing bitmex with very small amounts

I see that you can update your leverage - I'm a bit confused, does this update apply to the initial contract? So if I buy at 6500 says and my liquidation point is at 6300. If a week later the price is at 6700 and I'm confident we're not revisiting 6500, I can update my leverage to a higher amount, pushing my liquidation point to, say, just under 6500? Or have I completely misunderstood?
I believe the units are in BTC.
Yeah you'd be getting paid for the others. Think Bitmex take a small cut of the interest too. (There are people who know their system better than myself)

Some people do change positions at those thresholds to avoid paying for another period.
If the big guys are buying entire walls to avoid moving the price is it bullish or bearish?

My point is that there are a lot of ways to interpret any given trade.
only 4. you are lucky. Don't ever install the binance app
Not arguing that they didn’t haha, just saying those that they entered under very risky conditions. If you’re going to enter a high leverage position at least wait for a trend, going sideways is a terrible time to do any gambling.
What does that tweet mean? Did he have to market buy with 2627858 USD for an average price of 6813 USD per BTC? 
Selling is not the same as selling/going short which is almost always used when the seller does not own the underlying.
LOL, any mongo_jesus out here? Twin brother?
true but looks like sellers hesitate alot below 6.6k (same for buyers above 7-7.2k). Main reason we reached 6k in Feb was Kobayashi not really giving a f*** pushing 18k through. I wonder who's gonna take that dump risk. He will need coordination and a FUD machine in full gear to succeed.
Sry man. I'm just careful and like to make small scalps when I am home after work. Sure hope I call it right for both of us.
You held it from the dump of 7150 to 6650 yesterday? I don't see any correlation between that dump and UTC time. Do you have any data to back your claim?
[yes](https://www.tradingview.com/x/lEbkjANR/)

EDIT: it looks more like a descending triangle actually
6k not cheap enough?
[deleted]
how can more longs open on bitmex than shorts? For every long there has to be a short?
how do you put labels on usernames? like say I wanted to label a poster something like "great trader" or "alt coin shill", for example...
> Bitcoin is expensive per unit (a psychological barrier) and no one see it to go 10X in value in any foreseeable future.

To be fair, I remember people saying the same thing when BTC was $500 and LTC was $5. And I'm sure they were saying that when BTC went over a dollar, too....
[removed]
Why would you hold shit for the long term? Lik
Yes and the old school trader will be taking the new school traders money until they learn the game
Oh please, Bitcoin is not seen as "drug money". Silk road was more than 3 years ago. And you're trying to say alts are not seen as bubbles? Come on, man.
Who else then? I don't know.
So, who is it?
I was a noob and bought at $8k. I can't imagine I'm that special...1000s like me.

If just 10000 people bought as much as I did we'd be at $9k by tonight 
I am forced to admit that the comment in question does not do a lot to support my argument that we shouldn't be too mean to hodler cultists...
No need to dogg my home boys. We're all friends here.
Not at all. I imagine a super-sophisticated mountain lair with just fucking screens and tickers and keyboards and Minority Report type interface stuff everywhere.

You might not like their bearishness / realistic outlook (which gets counted as bearishness during a downturn) but you have to admit they are definitely... engaged with the market.
I like it :)  Brave little bot.
Built around the basic idea, yet sound like an intelligent bot. Would love to know it's progress, successful implementation and outcome.
So, am I reading this wrong?  I'd think you would want to buy the dip after liquidated longs or short on liquidated shorts.

Maybe the trading period you are targeting makes a difference.  I'm thinking in the 1 minute candle time-frame.
this is a really bad idea and has been tried countless times. their bodies are left with the rest of liquidations.
I thought the potential for the data to be used:

1. Buy when there is a sudden increase in longs to shorts (ie follow the herd) because there is probably a high volume break out.  This actually works for longing before Dec 19, but pretty much any bot that only longs worked before Dec 19 due to the strong bull market.

2. Use as a qualifier for an existing bot to help prevent the bot from buying when 'overbought' (too many longs) or selling when 'oversold' (too many shorts).  

Like most bot ideas; it didn't work.
Uh doesn't sound good. I just checked BFX last downtime on Mar 21st, after the downtime, the price climbed briefly which was followed by a major drop afterwards.
> makes me regret

Stick to your original plan. Remember, the opportunities never end.

I am noticing a pattern of price going up before and at least 4 hours after UTC closing then it drops. This happens almost everyday.
Kobayashi spazzing it out and market selling the remaining 160k BTC?
-Satoshi coins get moved

Well that's the question, often black swans can be anything unforeseen. Things you wouldn't think of before the event.
You don't have a very good imagination.
Tell me which exchange has a better trading engine and UI then
Ah thanks much, perfectly visible.  Seems I was looking at the wrong chart.

Damn that's scary.
Something about Soros shorting on Bitfinex or Bitmex just doesn't seem right..lol . 

CME? CBOE? Dark Pools/OTC markets?  

But you have a valid point..do any of these hold enough liquidity to whet his appetite..
maybeeeee
they made their own tether called TUSD.
Yeah, classic wedge action here. Bears are losing conviction. If volume doesn't pick up then we can expect a slow rise, IMO.
Anything sub $6k really, it depends how it  plays out. ideally I close below $7k when all is said and done, but my target has been between $4-6k. 

But if we get there I may be too greedy to close it without seeing a proper break through 7k again. 
people saying the  same stuff, talking about fundamentals and how the bubble cycle is going to be shorter than expected and a recovery is imminent any second now 

really all it takes is a gander in the old dailies to sober yourself up to the reality of what's possible 
I love you people who know this feel
Crypto has some sort of addictive features, hard when its impossible to enter
I started trading in 2017 with 0.1 BTC (at the time 100 bucks) that I traded up to 1BTC. Then added 4 BTC and been trading with 5BTC ever since and always move profits to cold storage
well the point here is rather that you should downsize until you feel that, regardless of position size. if you have the slightest gut feeling that you are overinvested, just get out and wait. Took me  a long time to learn but really helped. You also need to learn to love to lose
Do not need to create separate account, use the same one, very easy to transfer. GL!

just go to gdax.com, sign in w/ coinbase account
Thank you, both.
yep, but only limit orders are free.

Make a GdAX account using your coinbase login.

You can transfer between GDAX and coinbase instantly for free too. You should be up and running in 5 minutes
I think it will incite FOMO amongst current bears bc a lot of them (including myself) are waiting to get in there but it all depends on how, if, we get there. Agreed a slow bleed below $6K is not good but by all indications if $6500 fails, which has been a major support, it will go to $6K and not so sure if bears can push it down much further than Feb low which would confirm double bottom. 
We're currently $1830 away from $5k and only $1170 away from $8K. 
I might have missed this one,what is it? 
What's your reasoning for 3k?
I dont see any reasons (apart from storage maybe, which could be done on a sidechain).

Volume, 2h+ RSI, longs vs shorts appear to be strong indicators for more than scalps. 
I think the idea is that, the more people agree on a target price, the more people there are who are willing to pay a bit more to make sure their bid gets hit around that point. Or at least that’s how I think of it.
You can already do that with bitcoin, though. Not cryptocurrencies as a whole but bitcoin. 

So perhaps you're right crypto has room to grow but bitcoin may not. At least not until it begins to fulfill the speculative value people have assigned it with a real use case
Sure, and it seems like that has increasing returns actually:

> The last time such a large survey was conducted, back in 2013 by the firm On Device in preparation for a London conference, bitcoin awareness by Americans languished at 25%.

So awareness increased by 240% but price increased by 2000%. 

Interesting. I wonder if that growth will continue or if it truly is an early adoption phase 
5% own it. So sure, it has room to grow. But growing past 5% is a lot more difficult than people expect. 

I heard of bitcoin in 2013 and wanted to buy in but had no easy way. in 2017 it was incredibly easy to get an account on Coinbase and buy. 

There isn't a barrier for entry anymore- the majority of people who wanted in got in. This 5% may not see explosive growth like people expect. 

5% is *a lot* for a completely speculative asset 
Yes, and if there is another bubble, I think it'd be pretty undeniable that that'd be the last one. 

But for now we all have to pretty much speculate and guess because both possibilities look likely at this point.

Also my point is primarily directed at bitcoin, not cryptocurrencies as a whole btw. 

Also also i don't necessarily think bitcoin would die or something, just that "moon or stabilize" may not be accurate
I did; 2nd time 
Can you justify your reasoning for keeping position open / why do you think we will reach those targets?

Sorry for the questions, hearing different perspectives and approaches will help me be a better trader in the long run.

> could mean beginning of the end of 4 digit bitcoin

I understand the sentiment, but that doesn't necessarily follow. In 2014 people thought breaking $300 could mean the beginning of the end of 3 digit bitcoin. In reality, it stayed in the $200s after that (except for two very brief flash crashes to the mid $100s), though of course it was hard to tell that was the bottom at the time.
During the 2014 bear market, there were a couple of downtrend line breakouts (along with the requisite FOMO, ATH incoming, etc.) only to fizzle out and drop again. It was no problem...we had plenty of pixels so we just redrew the downtrend line with a slightly gentler slope.
Going sideways would not invalidate his statement.
A 7k btc dump in the morning?
Yes I was there. Back then the largest exchange was hacked and no one knew if Bitcoin ever would come back. Now the only problem is a correction and when (not if) the next bullrun starts.
that you can't keep betting on it as if it were a safe bet. The longer a trend runs on the riskier it becomes.
Perhaps thats true but i wont make much of it until we hit a higher high.
no you're right, but it takes out the same equivalent in btc back to your account. So you make the same amount of money, it's just less capital at a higher leverage from that point onward, but if you got liquidated you would still have that initial capital you pulled out. 
Thanks!
Is the interest rate listed somewhere on the dashboard?
All I can see is the fee FAQ where it says the long funding = -0.1421% for 100x leverage. Does the interest change depending on the leverage you choose or is it solely based on the USD value of contracts?

So if I buy $10000 of contracts I'm paying $35+ a day in interest? Have I understood that correctly? Really exposing myself as a major noob here and maybe I should've read a little more closely. 
Would be bullish, ostensibly. Im not reading too much into the orderbook but just questioning the claims that the sellside is barren. 
Agreed. That's a huge loss for that person liquidated!
That's my understanding - that he placed a short order, and when the market rose he was liquidated (which means he was forced to buy at market price to cover the short). https://twitter.com/BitmexRekt
Re read my comment. I address this.

If you short mroe than you own, then you leveraged a short, so you’re a big boy and can live with the loss.

If you hold the udnerlying and short less than the notional value fo your portfolio, you do not lose fiat value on your short
Main reason we reached 6K was because momentum was much stronger. It was an instantaneous bounce also because of this. Think of a rubber ball hitting against the floor. 

Then again, the price didn't consolidate at that range, it just lasted like 30 minutes or so . So you could say the actual low point, regarding long time frames was 6475. 

I don't like to take wicks into account when the market is bearish, i feel they fail much more often.  
Still holding. Same behavior as 24 hours ago, ETH leading the bull run.
I am not trying to correlate anything here, it is advised not to get to much into details when little is known.

I closed my long at 7170 before the dump, afterwards during the big red candle, opened a long @ 6849 and riding it since then.

BFX will be going down it the morning, so I must decide what I will do with this open position, it is not the data that will decide. :) 
Yeah actually it does look like one, I guess some wick cuttig is needed for the symmetric case.

But descending triangles are very strict on having a flat bottom.

Guess we can't really make a play based on either, not well enough confirmed.
Hold until a multiplier, everyone has their price I suppose. My bottom? you mean where i'd consider too cheap to buy in? Don't think I have one.

EDIT: If you mean me guestimating where the bottom is? - Either right now at 6.6k or between 4.5 and 5k.
I believe it's part of the reddit enhancement suite, I don't have you tagged as anything so I'm guessing you are of a rational thought camp rather than the perma-anything monkeys. Good luck to ya.
Is this /bitcoin? I though I posted in /bitcoinmarkets?
The thing is, BTC reached a stupid ATH and was dumped hard. And this did not happen while it was underground. It was at the peak of its media attention. The number of stupid people that buy bitcoin for it to moon is dwindling. It's time for adoption and bitcoin fails miserably at adoption.

Go on, ask any random stranger in the street what do they think of bitcoin, let's see what are they responses are. 
Lol exactly, I don't even care if people hodl, it's the weird mentality like that that makes me shake my head
I do love both of those bears, all in good fun
Upvote for the Minority Report reference.

You are right, if I needed a Bitfinex order book outlook on short notice, I would be better served by asking them than firing up the app. 

Besides, Sloppy has an open invitation to my couch should his mountain lair ever become, unsatisfactory. 
still tweaking it, im not a good programmer so it takes more alot time to tweak in little things and have to wait for a friend most the time to correct my mistakes.
when price go down and longs get liquidated the bot already in buy mode and waiting for the price to go up a bit(bounce) to buy then enter sell mode after short get liquidated. repeat. 
I'm tired of my algos failing 
That drop was because of a rising wedge, unrelated to their downtime imo.
> -Beyoncé declares that bitcoin is silly

Bullish ;)
There are probably more old school whales here (2011-2012ish) than institutional investors though.
Just for your head-check:

> my target **has** been between $4-6k.

No harm in reevaluating having seen the order books, finding a sweat spot even if it's to fit in with smoke and mirrors.

> if we get there

If it breaks down a lot of your gains are yet to come surely. Seems rational to hold the position even against support.. or not ;)

> too greedy

You'll have already made a profitable play, already potentially more than doubled up on a 50/50, could hit it again, but..
6 more years of winter then.
with the difference that in 2014 the exchange with 85&#37; market share went bankrupt and people had no accounts on other exchanges to buy Bitcoin....
The good news is that you wouldn't have held to $20k.  You would have sold at $120 and walked around like king shit for 6 months.  Then when it peaked again you would have FOMOed in at $800, then watch it tank, sell it at $400, and have to deal with your wife reminding you about how you fucked up for the next two years.  Or worse you would have lost it to GOX and have everyone laugh at you for buying magic internet money.  Mo bitcoin mo problems.
I’ll get there one day lol

Wow, nice work!!
He said 5xxx so can’t that mean 5999?
No I mean the historical 'FUD' old mate above me mentioned 
I'm not him but the "main" trendline for this entire bullrun is currently right below 3k, we also have very strong volume support at 3k. If you look at an inverse chart it becomes more apparent that its a very strong support level.
I really Doubt 5% of americans own Bitcoin. I would even bet on it, to be honest that number is huge. Do you have more data related to the survey ? as most surveys and statistics it is probably useless because of the number of participants.
Absolutely. Plus, how many people are realistically going to buy in? Many of my friends have heard of bitcoin, but that doesn't mean they necessarily understand why they would want it. 

Even if lots of sites started accepting bitcoin as a payment method, why use it when they can just use cards? 
You're totally right about 5% being the bandied about statistic, but I'm thinking of people who own more than a few hundred dollars worth, I highly doubt that number is anywhere close to 5%, but difficult to say. I wish the info was more granular.
We only need one or two more bubbles, and the last one if this market makes it mark will be sustained and insane.
You can see the percentage of takes decrease in line with what I think will get hit.  The 6900 one was just missed.  Not confident we'll get much past 7k so locking in 60% of the profits by around there.

It's just based on hitting the diagonal resistance line that we've been repelled from lately when we got to 7500 and 7200, which is now around 7100 on my chart.  

Ah, well yes.
I hope you are right.
I agree. This crash is nothing like the others for so many reasons and we shouldn't expect too many similarities. 
Events usually don't matter much in a bull or bear market. If it goes up, it'll shoot up, if it goes down, it'll burn hard.
Risky? Sure, what else is new in crypto... But saying bears are delusional for shorting when the trend has been their friend, I can't even describe how butthurt that sounds.
so if i'm close to liquidation i could lower my leverage to have a lower liquidation point (assuming I have the necessary amount of BTC in my account)? And the further away I get from liquidation and the more confident I become in the price going in the direction I want I can increase my leverage to lower my margin cost? With the advantage to the latter being that if I increase my leverage, it frees up my balance to buy more contracts?
There is a little panel on the bottom left where you mouse-over to get alternate information on rates or whatever. (Not logged in currently so not sure exactly what it says)

> So if I buy $10000 of contracts I'm paying $35+ a day in interest? 

This is where I don't pay enough attention to know if I'd answer correctly.

>  Really exposing myself as a major noob here and maybe I should've read a little more closely

There is a lot of moving parts to some of these mechanics, it's worth getting right first. My first Bitmex order was an insta-liquidation *"I know how margin works! Here let me just.."* ;)
any news about why eth leading the run? I was expecting ICOs to sell their eth 
Bull run, are you joking?
Literally every word of every sentence you just wrote applied to BTC in the Spring of 2014, post $1K ATH.
[removed]
Where do you live?  The average Joe in the US has no idea what the silk road was. Or even what Tor is.  Bitcoin was the only option when that shit went down.  We all know it's not anonymous.  Bitcoin was an hourly topic on msnbc for months.  Yes it's a bubble. Are you arguing that any alt is not?  I'd be surprised if I could find a handful of people on the street who even know what ethereum is.  Bitcoin=crypto to the vast majority who even know what crypto is.  You keep going on about partnerships and branding, give us some examples.  I have no idea what you're going on about.  Anybody who wants another moon is basically saying they want another bubble, because they didn't get in early enough on btc or eth
So your opinion regarding crypto is the same as a random person from the street?

Good luck. 
That's how i read it ;)
The good part is the learning experience you are gaining. Whenever it is ready, you will be ready too to run it successfully. All the best!
thanks, it's good to hear people's opinions on this because it truly is difficult to remain objective when the profits are large. a long from $6.8k to $11k would be difficult to close as well, especially if it ended up breaking past $12k, which is why I'm hesitant to close on a break below $5k.

Not sure I understand the last part, is that what you were suggesting?
so why are we lower now than we were then? in terms of %ATH and time elapsed since ATH. 

In a more liquid market with better fundamentals..? 

human psychology never changes, especially crypto noobs
I don't understand why someone downwoted you. You're absolutely correct, I don't see why people would compare the 2014 crash with this one, they couldn't be more different.. 
You will do it too
You mean support 6000 - 6500.

No way in hell 1 out of every 20 people own bitcoin... unless maybe survey was taken outside a bitcoin meetup.
it's on the parent comment! Article says 5,000 people participated 
Just for fun, retailers could give discounts for BTC purchases, as they wouldn't have to pay the ~2-3% fee to the credit card company, and could pass some of that back to the consumer.
This, I think, would be very useful. 
Yeah, that's what I meant. I think we will meander around the bottom down here for a little bit. I doubt we go sub 6400, but if we do... no bueno
I dont think he means that .

Im just gonna say, it has failed to break down over and over again. Always stuck in 6500~, which to me is horizontal support. We are nearing the log resitance again. Last time this happened this resulted in a big dump just before hitting it. If it holds in this levels for a while we can say that either the bear market is over or that it has adjusted to a much slower bleed down.

I don't ever see bears questioning a bullish scenario, so yeah, i say that blindly shorting is pretty delusional. 
Right 
No news. Only looking at charts. Confirmed triple bottom and took significant beating during the sell-off (esp. with EOS team selling a lot of ETH), we can say it is returning to its 'bearish' mean, as it is also gaining on the ethbtc ratio. Target 0.08
That already happened.
I think its just because ETH is so oversold relative to BTC, ETH bulls are just a slight bit more bullish currently.

You can see it on the ratio, appears to be rallying a bit.
Oh, so BTC was in the middle of Media hype with crypto at market cap of 800 billion back then and then crashed to 1/3 of its value? interesting. I think I'm grossly misinformed. Just don't try to compare that time with now. Totally different.
Aww, you missed a golden opportunity for:

> If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry.
[removed]
No I'm not talking about mooning. I'm talking about chance of adoption. Bitcoin can never be a currency while it remains a poker chip in futures contract, shorted and longed by whales. A price dump of 10% in half an hour? good luck with adoption with that. Do you see people buy coffee with penny stocks? 

Alts on the other hand, are the bread and butter of blockchain technology. Sure, their price maybe at the mercy of bitcoin for now, but they can simply decouple from it if they reach adoption milestones. We see household names partnering with alts to experiment with crypto, but not with BTC. IMB (Stellar), Fujitso (IOTA), Moneygram (Ripple), Huawei (Sirin), Samsung (ICON) and etc. These are names that people recognize and trust. There won't be another bubble. There will be adoption and that's where BTC will fail. 
I hope that sand pile is comfy for your head. Good luck to you too
Now this probably sounds more confusing, hung-over and need to eat ;)

If it breaks downwards, explosively, then you've already bet on a break, a potentially rather volatile one with much short-term movement. You've captured the outlier, may as well take it rather than wait for the slow grind part.

Like all those hodl articles circulating recently, *"90% of S&P500 gains happened on just 6 days"* type stuff. Capture one of those days and it's hardly worth hanging around for the other 360.
people expected the bubble to burst at one point, that leaded to a faster volatlity pattern .... 

check my post below, you can see that we first should go back up to 11k before we drop much further from here, if we compare it to 2014. 
Man it would be a dream to have that kind of money! But yes I hope so:-)
you know i don't bucky :) but i hope it holds
Oh I didnt catch that, just that it was a survey. My bad.

Even though it is probably not so far off I guess we can both agree that in fact that is a useless statistic.
Thing is, many retailers, at least initially, are going to want to convert back into fiat, so will probably end up paying more than what they'd pay to a card company to do that. 

Plus you've got the issue with Bitcoin fees still. I know they're pretty low right now but volume is also really low as well. I suspect we'll fare better than we did in December but I'm still not entirely convinced that the issue is resolved. Lightning Network is cool but it's nowhere near ready for "general" use.
ok thanks for the detailed response, I appreciate it, thanks
Marketcap is a bad metric in crypto... There were thousand of alts with fake numbers...

Media only focused on the price not on the tech.. They are dumb as fuck on purpose and if you only watched the news you wont even now what Bitcoin really is, since they do not explain it at all. 
[removed]
dude, ten bucks.

You can put ten bucks into Bitcoin. You know you dont have to buy a whole one
Thx
Honestly after reading through it, I'm quite surprised. 25% were aware of bitcoin in 2013. So a 240% increase in awareness led to 2000% growth.. Perhaps people truly are waiting to get in. 
You're better than this. Well, probably not, but you should be.
[removed]
I know lol, still haven’t paid the last two months fees for my daughters nursery!😅 Don’t invest what you cant afford to lose, I can’t afford to lose ten bucks😂
I skimmed through it after reading your comment and in fact it does look interesting but the number of participants is just so small :/ . I would love to be able to see a survey of the sorts with 100k> participants.
Temp ban incoming in 5...4...3....
It’s not “to lose”, it’s “Toulouse”

PM me your address. I got you

EDIT: You have to promise to trade with it
Thanks for chiming in and arguing for sensibility. The temp bans don't make sense if they aren't talked about honestly and with some levity.
Yeah, this place seems to have became an offshoot of /bitcoin. You can't question the corn. 
You're a goddamn champion
Not at all. You just need to put a little more thought into your analysis. You come off as an alt fanboy that joined late last year, and I don't mean that pejoratively. If you genuinely want to discuss the relative merits and markets of BTC vs. alts, that's a good conversation to have...but you come across as a "lol btc ded" alt-moonkid, and so you shouldn't be surprised that you're being harshly dismissed.

Also, and this is important...people have been calling for alts to take over and eat BTC's lunch since LTC first came on the scene many years ago. Yet here we are. Not saying it will never ever happen, but there are many reasons for why things are still as they are. You should consider whether the BTC maximalists that you sneer at might have some good points, and what their years of experience in crypto have taught them. It would help you take your own blinders off and get a more rounded view of the crypto space.
You cannot verbally abuse other contributors. Question whatever you like in whatever way you like, but please stay on topic and treat others with respect.
Have to send it first. At a bar rn ;) Will send later
I merely asked for opinion regarding an analysis, all I got was downvotes and no solid arguments, that's a red flag IMO. I understand, people who rode the BTC from 1 to 20K must be very protective of it, I'd be too if i was in their place. Cognitive bias, we're very comfortable when everything fits our own narrative.Paradigm shift is coming to crypto with adoption and I frankly don't see how BTC can be adopted with its current limitations (from both tech and value perspective). 

In my position as a newbie (relatively) I'm seeing the trend changing. Regulations, adoption, competition. These are serious topics now when they were mere speculations a few years ago. We're getting more and more fiat pairs for alts. We're getting decentralized exchanges and atomic swaps. We have blockchain solutions talked by big names such as google. I don't see anyone discussing these, but everyone is fanatically cheering BTC and censoring any argument to the contrary. That always ends badly, always.
I'm a lurker here, you're one of the many that provides good insights, both wild and conservative sometimes and always appreciated.  Awesome to see good people in this community looking out for others and a great way to encourage growth.  
Thank you, that's a much better way of approaching the argument (and you make some good points). Definitely keep researching, discussing, etc. I think one thing we can both agree on is crypto as a whole is incredibly promising and interesting, and we are lucky to be alive in a time of such technological progress where we have front-row seats to this sort of stuff.

To be fair, every crypto has its maximalists. The more invested they are (financially, mentally, emotionally) in a coin, the more they cheerlead it and succumb to cognitive biases. You see this in BTC, you see this in ETH, and you see this in a bunch of smaller coins that are definitely, certainly going to go from $0.05 to $5K and overthrow Bitcoin any minute now (at least that's what they believe). It's hard to stay objective, but that's the most important part.

Personally, I think Bitcoin is here to stay and will maintain the #1 spot for years to come. Does it deserve it? Maybe, maybe not. If it was launched alongside ETH and NEO and VEN and all the others, it might not have had the slam-dunk success that it did. But now, it has name recognition, network effects, the longest track record, etc. etc. even if it is not the most technologically advanced. So it will be very difficult to overcome moving forward. But hey, anything can happen!
