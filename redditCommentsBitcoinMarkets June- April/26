To add to my earlier comment from this morning:

There are two ascending channels that I'm now watching. This first is more long term, and it's already broken down:

https://imgur.com/a/tfpaOJk

While the resistance line for the formation is obviously a bit suspect (the market broke out to the upside and then fell back within the formation), the support line is more straightforward. 

I agree with others that starting a support line prior to the Big Green Candle is likely going to throw TA for a loop. The point of chosen for the beginning of the support line is the second dip to $7,750 that kicked off the continued rise up to $9,950. I think it's a perfectly valid point to start measuring the short-term trend. 

As I mentioned, it broke to the downside, so one would expect continued decline to follow in the next few days. With the possibility of a confirmation of support-turned-resistance at around $9,300 to $9,500 (depending on how long it takes for the market to make its way back up there to make that confirmation test). 

We also have a shorter term channel which others have posted:

https://imgur.com/a/7KjQ5D8

This one is very compelling, because:

1. It's cleaner. There's no false breakouts.
2. It hasn't been violated yet, so it's still a bullish formation. 

I don't see the market busting through the bottom of the second formation right away (although that's always possible). 

Instead, I'd say it's quite likely that the market will bounce off of the support line from the smaller formation up to $9,300 or $9,500 to confirm support-turned-resistance of the larger formation. 

RSI is fairly overextended on shorter timeframes (30m and 1h) and is closing in on oversold territory on medium timeframes (2h - 6h). 

As far as RSI is concerned, there's still plenty of room to fall on the 12h, and 1d.

Interestingly enough, there's also still plenty of room to go both up or down on the 3d and 1w. Both are neutral around 50.

So my general sentiment is this:

Expect a 3% to 4% bounce before $9,000 falls, but don't long or short it. 

If the market gets back to $9,400 and loses steam, consider shorting it. 

If the market blasts through $9,500 and makes its way back above the support line of the larger formation, then opening a long might not be crazy. 

Personally I'm a bit uneasy in my short now that I'm seeing the smaller channel support holding. But we'll see what happens.

EDIT: Another thing to watch is the [falling wedge](https://imgur.com/a/DkO9c9B) that others have pointed out.

To me, it's starting to look like sellers could have painted themselves into a bit of a corner here. There's strong support immediately below price, and sellers failed to pierce the descending support of that wedge. Buyers might just have a launch point here to break through the wedge resistance and retest $10,000.

This would invalidate the larger channel breakdown, but that would actually provide a bit of symmetry to the formation. As there was a false breakout to the upside already that was rejected.
There's a distinct similarity between this row of wild forest pine trees and the Bitcoin price chart. If this is anything to go by, we can expect $15k by early June, but broadly sideways movement thereafter with a subtle downtrend, ending the year around $12k:

I must have fat fingered something on my phone yesterday, I woke up this morning to find my 5x short from 9,410 was at 100x leverage.

I'm amazed that I managed to go to sleep with a 100x position open without getting liquidated. It would only have been a small portion of my stack as Mex reduces the assigned margin if you increase leverage once a position is open (rather than increasing the size of your position), but I still feel super lucky.

I really need to stop making trades on my phone from bed while half asleep.

The great thing I love about comparisons to 2014 is the ultimate confession that, back then, a massive bull market followed.

If you believe Bitcoin is going to $5k "because 2014", then it's only consistent to believe there will be at least a 19x rise to take us to $95k.

Enjoy the sales while they last!   
Ignore the rest the mess at the top, but the [BBands are the tightest](https://snag.gy/iunPQf.jpg) on the daily it's been since Oct 31st last year, get ready for something big I'm guessing. 
Closing my 9150 long from this morning. I get the feeling somebody is not done dumping but not willing to short based on a feeling. Will open a new long at 8800 should we go there.

We're either seeing a bear trap being set right now or a bull trap being sprung. Don't know which so sitting out.
The failure to really break 9460 tells me that most buyers are waiting fro the price to drop. Selling pressure is constant, but the lack of buying is worrisome to me.

I opened a short @9310
Might stop @9500
Bitcoin failed to break through $10 000 and we find the market correcting itself after the gains from early April.

Bitcoin has fallen through the first few bullish trend lines and is now on critical support, in my opinion, if there were to be a bounce this would be a good place to buy. However I am not convinced with the price action and a retest of $9000 – $8800 is most likely on the cards.

Should the above support zone hold we could expect the bulls to pull back into the market, but as it stands right now, momentum is turning bearish and I think we could see some more selling action before the weekend.

There are some bearish candlestick patterns on the 4 hour candles, hinting to more downside in the market.

Both indicators are confirming my bearish suspicions and I will wait for some bullish signals before going long on the market. For those higher risk traders there could be a short on the table should our near term support fail.

The prices will need to consolidate above $9400 – $9600 for the bullish momentum to continue. (just my opinion)

[You can find the charts here](https://cryptosignals.trade/forums/topic/bitcoin-btc-technical-analysis-may-2018/#post-17623), safe trades.
Last week we had everyone saying “if we stay above $9,000 by next week that’s bullish af” and now we have the despair and bear crowd out here 
Interesting read https://medium.com/@derekpankaew/how-the-sec-is-deciding-on-ethereum-fake-news-spread-a4f58aa9c4f0 
I want to consider going short but the fact that there's about to be bullish crossover on MA Cross Indicator and Parabolic SAR is about to be a buy -- both on the weekly chart -- makes me want to hold my long at least until the market strongly denies the move below a key support pivot (S3 - see pivot point chart linked below) which in this case is 8500 -- not coincidentally, THE key support in the most recent bull run.  If this breaks this is going sub 6000.  If the bull case confirms and plays out, it should be an explosive move up that confirms end of bear market.  My gut says short, but my chart says hold on. ETH is also following a similar pattern (I mention this since ETH tends to lead BTC). Parabolic SAR in particular has described BTC's moves on longer time frames very well so it's something i give a lot of weight even though it is only a single indicator.
I have been waiting for this very move since the 'death cross' was painted on the chart.  The last time it was a buy on Parabolic SAR weekly chart July of last year until January.

Edit: Ultimately, I think its more than a possibility that we test 8.5k again since major levels of support/resistancce are where MMs can squeeze every last ounce from bulls before letting it run back up again while still maintaining the sentiment that a bull market is on the horizon.  If they let it drop below 8.5k, the game is over.  BTC never seems to get a clean move without games first.  As long as it is above 8.5k, there will be plenty of games to scare money out of bulls.  Example: On my pivot chart, there is plenty of room on the upcoming candles to 'sandwich' the PSAR 
 signal and 8.5k (S3 Support), we may just keep oscillating from here and 8.5 k until the PSAR is almost flush with S3.  It makes it obvious to me that we may need a bounce off of that support to see PSAR turn into a buy.

Here is what I have been watching from the last few weeks from Ichimoku Cloud POV.

Still very bullish in the short and long term.

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/RL2T3PLR-Cloud-analysis/

I am a degen gambler so I am already all-in, but for those that are not ready to admit we are in a bull market yet. (Which is probably wise) This is what I would be waiting for to be absolutely certain the trend has fully reversed and we definitely in a bull market:

1. Price above cloud (heading in the right direction now)
2. Bulish TK Cross (already happened)
3. Kumo twist (cloud switching to green, it is thinning now)
4. Lagging Span above the cloud. (not shown on my chart)


Cloud Settings:

BTC Daily: 20,60,120,30

ALT/BTC Pairs: 10,30,60,30 on the largest time frame that has significant data for the cloud.

i'm not sure how i should interpret bill gates + buffets opinions on bitcoin. I mean both have been terrible predictors of technological trends~. it just happened that they handle multi-billion companies and fortunes.

~ microsoft missed big time both on the internet (search/social) and mobile (apple)

if history is any indicator, this is a signal to go all in deep throat in bitcoin/crypto. both of these guys have been risk averse in complete change. wall street says that it is never different. Well, they missed big time on apple and google. i mean come on: it was different. The tech sector is different. Things go crazy in this kinda world. the laws of physics don't apply here.

still here still long. still waiting for a resolution to the upside. turning my career all in to crypto, trading and blockchain in the mean time.
went long here like I planned to in my previous post, but already feels like a mistake. this buy volume is hideous..   
edit: closed it. will reopen if we get above 9200 with any volume or at 8.8-8.9k, holding my short for now. 
NYT reporting Trump will withdraw from the Iran deal. Since I posted about it earlier, figured I would post a follow up when news came:

https://twitter.com/nytimes?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor

EDIT: CNN reporting is slightly different, reporting that as a potential first step Trump will allow sanctions to go through.

https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/08/politics/donald-trump-iran-deal-announcement-decision/index.html

EDIT: 

Bull case, increased destabilization in middle-east will increase demand for BTC as a flight to safety asset and as a hedge against continued inflation in Iran.
         
Bear case, the market is big enough to absorb this without a noticeable impact.
I've flip-flopped my position 3 times in the last hour. Time to go to bed out of position methinks.
Seems like there's no buyer volume
the reddit founder(Alexis Ohanian) just pimped Bitcoin hard on Colbert Report, did it while wearing a $25K Audemars Piguet watch too
Long @9070. Rsi near historic lows on 15 min chart there will be a bounce sooner than later.
This market is very different and the market makers wants to crush everyone both long and short.

We are either in a big bull trap from 6.5k or this is reversing.


If you are a spot hodler and not day trading, set 2 alarms, one for 7699 and another one for 10901 and forget about the charts.


If you are an active day trader, make sure that you don’t sleep or your stop will hit 80% of the time before reversing lol.

We got higher lows higher highs on 1 hr, BUT we also got a bear div on 1d and we hit a huge major mega resistance so I expect a half assed bounce soon before we continue down. Would not go long here, would not go short here
Can't tell if this is the most obvious short in the world or if I'm being played.
Sub 9k stops about to get ran. This drop has fairly low volume too.

Big buy walls posted up to catch the stops and will probably bounce back right over 9k.
4 HR Kumo has a bearish cross and looks to be breaking out  to the downside of the red cloud before the bullish twist. TDI is showing a short play on the 1d 12HR and 4 HR. Back to work, unfortunately...

Quite the [recovery candle from that small sell off](https://www.tradingview.com/x/G5fJYfYV/)...bodes well for a $9200 break in the coming hours
I won't have the time to post a longer analysis until later this afternoon, which is unfortunate because this move is fairly significant.

The [ascending channel](https://imgur.com/a/vxYYEuH) that brought the market from $7,800 to $9,950 broke down on this move.

I'm not suggesting that we're seeing a bull trap in this entire move starting with the big green candle, but if $8,600 breaks to the downside, then I'd expect to see the market confirm the log resistance line as support, which is actually very important and better to happen sooner rather than later.

That line is all the way down at around $7,500 or so right now. 

In the short-term, there's likely to be plenty of chop in the lower $9,000s and upper $8,000s. 

If the market gets back above $9,400, I might start to reconsider my short. Otherwise I'm holding it for the foreseeable future. 

Edit: looking at the ascending channel on mobile, it did break down with a brief wick, but it's actually holding at the moment. So there's still hope. 

Edit: ignore the above edit, I was mistaken: https://imgur.com/a/vxYYEuH
Doesn't it feel a lot like may the 1st?

Price action is similar, this sub is turning bearish, chewy is closing his long, even the volume is similar (although it was higher on the way down last week).

Meanwhile we have a nice support line with 4 points of contact, previous resistance of the symmetrical triangle is also acting as support, hidden bullish divergence on the 4h is continuing. We also just wicked below the 0.786 fib of this retrace before climbing back up half way to 0.618, just like may first.

Maybe I should turn bearish as well but i'm conflicted.

I see lines crossing the Ichimoku Roundhouse Twist Kick Formation. Seeing a huge Unchi trap for the bears to step in, and we should finish off by ascending the steep Sugoi line for that cool 10k price. Bullish!
While not entirely unexpected for me, this pump is a little irritating when it comes to my short position. 

Still holding short from $9,420 for now. 

To offer some bullish hopium, if the market fails to break below $8,800 in the nearish future, there will be some nice hidden bullish divergence on the 4h through the 1d. RSI has made lower lows on this drop to $9,000, but the market has so far managed to make higher lows in price. 
One of BTC’s current use cases is as a hedge against currency inflation. 

If you are from a first world county with a stable currency, I don’t expect you to understand. If you are from Argentina, I don’t need to explain. 
If this is going to inverse Bart right about now I will eat my shorts!
When we double topped at 11.7k and took the second leg down, the volume was much higher than on the previous green days going up to 11.7k, and the daily bbands expanded indicating we were breaking the squeeze to the downside.

This time, the volume the past three days of red daily candles as been a little lower, or about the same as the previous green candles, and the daily bbands are actually tightening.

What this indicates to me is that this is not a breakdown, just more consolidation. I am going long here pretty heavily because consolidation means we are going to test the mid/top of the range next at 9500-9700.

Long xbtm18 from about 9300, planning to close half at 9700
Somebody is unloading loads of coins on Bitstamp. 
The past 3 weeks have hurt badly but it's slowly turning around.

Interest wasn't the best but I got enough back to cover what I paid out during the bottom. Won't hold through this time around, however.

I'll be letting my stuff go and cutting my short to go long. It's been my longest position to date and it'll feel awesome once I finally dump it.
Closed my short from 9310 at 9070 for a small profit. Really not sure where this is going now.
The lack of any movement is not inspiring any confidence in me. I think I’m going to put tight stops and wait this one out. It’s looking heavy as hell, though I do have a glimmer of hopium that this will be a huge shakeout. Realistically speaking I’m preparing my butt for a BRD. 

Edit: ~~I guess it’s starting as I submitted this.~~ Lol I guess back to being contrarian again.

Got my DCA down from $9900 to $9676. Am now "all in" with my fiat. Opened a parallel position in EUR to start the leveraging process as rates are ridiculously cheap atm. Avg position price is EUR7789.

I see a descending triangle inside a descending wedge

https://www.tradingview.com/x/gpk2qbSf/

Maybe a breakdown from the triangle to 8.8 then a rebound up through the wedge to 9.5-9.6. Hitting and bouncing off 8.8 would then form the neckline of a potential H&S.

I've been short from 9570 and keeping it open. Been posting less because I took a week off from trading and since then I've only made 2-3 trades, learning more, and being more disciplined all around and it's done better for me than no sleep overtrading.
I'm taking a somewhat risky long position here at $9150.  The bounce off support has looked sluggish, but selling pressure doesn't seem to want to let this move under the support line hovering at about $9030.  

If price just moves sideways for the next 8 hours, it'll re-challenge the descending wedge formed from this drop from $9.9k which, if broken, would promise some upside.  We've had 3 big red daily candles in a row with today's candle beginning to form a doji.  

Stops just under $9k in case this continues to dump


I think Bill Gates has started shorting Bitcoin.
(-)DMI heading up but ADX is heading down on the daily; price currently has kumo and EMA100 support, and close behind is kijun, EMA50, and EMA200 support, and a daily golden cross is imminent.

Yuuuge news?

This sub turned bearish, that's my buy signal.
This is looking **Extremely** similar to the price action we are seeing from the April 30th-May second price action 

**April 30th-May1st** 

At that time, we were also sitting in a falling wedge, and a bear flag that broke down 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/nZ9YAUto/

This nearly mimics the exact price action of today’s falling wedge / bear flag breakdown. On April 30th, we broke down from roughly $9200 after and found consolidation in the $9000 range ( what we are seeing now ), followed by the bear flag breakdown after $9000 fell to the low $8900 range. This created a mini “ Bear flag channel “ that we eventually broke up from here: 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/3HWOhMQP/

**May 7th-May 8th**

We are essential looking at the same exact thing, but one important factor has changed. Falling wedge with an extremely similar bear flag breakdown to a bear flag consolidation type thing that was *expected * to break up: 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/Fr05biAS/

Now to point out the difference: On my second chart posted, we had the “ bear flag “ type consolidation channel between $9200-9400, which if history repeated itself ( April 26th/ May 1st ) we would have expected a break up from the bear flag type thing, but in this case it broke down. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/cL8E0Obz/

What’s interesting here is it looks like we are forming another one of these bear flag channels: 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/pUOdI2hh/

Sorry for the long post, just pointing out some patterns we have been seeing in the $9,000’s range. 

Good luck all! 

The 4hr, 6hr, 12hr, and 1D MACD are all producing sell signals. The last 3 daily candles are red. Yet, selling pressure is weak and the price is still casually floating above the 23.6% retrace at 9148.68. 

This looks less like the beginning of a crash and more like the end of a correction. I think big players are accumulating in this range before pumping it past 10k.
Bear flag on the hourly. No?
Seems like we waited for the 2h Bbands to tighten. Adding two more candles in this range will make them very tight, so a next bigger move might happen in around 3\+ hours.

\(Might happen faster than thought, made a new lower high on the 1h\)

Another interesting thing is that a lot more volume was needed to push us up the first time to 9.7k but now not much volume was needed to push us from 10k to 9.3k. Seems like we are lacking buyers and hodlers seem overconfident with their investment IMO. 
Dang I closed my short too soon :(
Double bottom or next stop 8900.
I posted two days back that I had opened a very small long @9500 because I believed we are in a reaccumulation trading range. I closed it at break even, because I didn't want to take too much risks.

However, I still believe in the theory. [Here's a 4H chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Oi5UdhZ1/). And here's a [reference chart](http://d.stockcharts.com/img/articles/2015/07/1438369533740479636177.png).

I have some buys set in the 8700-9000 range. If they don't get hit, I'll buy on the break of the trading range.

EDIT - I had the wrong reference chart.
Starting to look like a medium term retrace. Strong support at 9.2k fell; looking to 8.8k now as the next HVN/horizontal support.

Stopped out but in profit being as it was actually Eth/Alts - about ~$20 per Eth profit.

Too many over confident shorts, time to go long.
Can we get a separate topic for the long/short posts? 
Okay, I go long at 9380, hours ago. Wrong timing. Tired of getting bamboozle again and again recently. Let me try this hodl strategy and see how it goes.,,
I've moved up my laddered buy orders from yesterday's 9.2-9.0k to 9.3k - 9.0k.

Reasoning: We seem to be holding on to the trend line from the 7.8/8.8k low, though only just. 

anything below this line is bought up relatively quickly, and the 4hr RSI is nicely reset. I simply don't see us breaking 9k, because our bear flag would've successfully have broken down already yesterday. If we do go down, I expect a target of 9.05k or so to the lower boundary trend line from our pennant last week. 

Alts are making higher lows and are trending up it seems, so despite the lack of legitimate buying pressure and the high ratio of longs opened, I think the R/R here isn't too bad. 

Edit: s/l around 8.9k for now but will monitor.
!long XBTUSD 9090 1X 20%

starting a long from here, expect that we bounce up a bit since we are oversold. In case we drop further down i will add more to my position.
I was thinking of "back to ATH" talk this week, then thought about how it does matter? As traders, should we not just care about the entry and the exit of any trade, regardless of short or long and do the best about what we can of the current condtions?

Of course there is the whole media hype and behaviour finance angle to it, but in the end doing 10 trades between 9-10k and one from 10 to 20k yields the same at the bottom line

Ascending triangle on 15. 

Target of $9,320-$9360, expect it to break up in the next 1-3 hours 

May open a small long here to hedge my short off the bottom off the triangle around $9,200, expect heavy resistance in the $9,350 range 

Edit: It broke down, bad call. Sorry fam 
Was able to short between 9430-9460 last night so I am only down a teeeeeny bit over the past two weeks.  Looking to re-enter below 8800 if we can get there.  Pretty quick drop downward this morning but not sure if 9100 is going to break.  If theres good news, looks like today wont be a boring day one way or the other.  
I'm waiting for breakdown of the ascending channel for confirmation, but this looks like textbook [Wyckoff Distribution](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54fed56be4b0b8a1d3d33918/t/5a663076e2c4834307e3dd53/1516646527060/Elliott%26WyckoffSchematic.png?format=1000w), following the accumulation phase from early April. It's definitely still early in the process to get overly bearish, but something to keep in mind if it breaks down further from here.
I'm watching the same falling wedge that others have already noted shape up nicely on the 4 hr.  Looks like we bounced at a convergence of the 100 and 150d EMA, and another rising support line that we've touched a few times.  

My question is does anyone else find it concerning that while we've violated the log trendline from the Sept low through 6k several times, we've only wicked below on the daily, but haven't closed below it.  Today is looking like that's a real possibility.  Or has everyone pretty much dismissed that as support altogether?

https://imgur.com/a/50G5DHQ
Basically. Close daily above./below this mid-range, and that's the volume gap we will fill after. Interesting ambiguity. andhttps://www.tradingview.com/x/pYITnVXU/
If we stay under about $9060 until the next hr, we'll have bull divs on everything =<2hr timeframes. How high do yall expect the bounce to be?
Whats a good buy in price can we go lower?
Relevant? https://twitter.com/CryptoZyzz/status/994054930695708673
I'm fairly sure Chewy mentioned a 3-4% bump before another dip was on the cards.

Buy pressure disappearing? Those walls are propping up the price but I'm not seeing many market buys. It looks like it's just a matter of time before the walls are pulled or eaten.

Edit: the big buys start coming in within seconds of me posting this.

Edit2: soon overpowered by even bigger sells.
My buy in target got reached spot on... most buys got triggered, was hoping for a wick through but stopped perfectly on the trendline. 

( i flip flopped back to my targets of yesterday of buy in at 9.15-9.05 after mentioning this morning I'd move them up.)

4HR RSI at the lowest point since our BGD from 6.5k I'm expecting a bounce here. I could be wrong, but if the trend is still bullish, this is the point of reversal. 

Edit: Also a potential hidden bullish div on the 4hr with the 8.8k low.
Bitmex futures premiums went down a good bit. Still higher than they were when we were at these price levels a little over a week ago. Does it make sense that the September premium is now $150 higher than it was back then just because of running to $10k and bouncing off of it? No, it doesn't. What does make sense is that leveraged traders got bull trapped as fuck, and the June futures longs are finally starting to capitulate, the September futures longs haven't yet. Expect more downwards movement until September futures longs capitulate. 
W..T..F
wtf is this sh*t????

Come on where's our TA guys someone post a chart and explain whats going on.


Remember when on Saturday everyone was calling for 11.7k?

Remember when we were at 6.5k and everyone was calling for 5k?

Wouldnt it be great if we could all just calm down and think rationally about what the most likely outcome is going to be? I know a bunch of people in here have great advice, but there’s the bull and bear parade thay just always comes in when the FOMO comes out.

My thought is this dump gets stopped cold in its tracks at 8800 and we are back above 9200 by Sunday.

If 8800 falls, Im out
That Bitfinex buy-wall is absorbing a lot of selling. The buy wall just denied further price drop expected from the sort-of H&S on hourly. I'm starting to think this is accumulation; coupled with an increase in Bitmex shorts over the next days, could be the proverbial viagra for the next green dildo.

Edit/update: the H&S reaction eventually came through
Feels very bottom-ey.

Buying pressure sub $9,300 is absolutely relentless. 
I see a lot of talk about how Gates and Buffet are being ridiculous with their ludicrous claims.

But people... please. Crypto is a speculative asset with no real use case outside of illicit activities and gambling at this point in time.

How can someone who built their entire empire on value creation and looking for long term value investments by buying shares in undervalued companies feasibly look at something with no real use case and a market cap greater than the GDP of a 2nd world country?

EDIT: Crypto Market Cap of 443 bn puts it right under Thailand and Belgium, right above Iran. That’s just completely ridiculous 

I love Bitcoin, and I think it has a bright future. But let’s not be unrealistic about how and why someone would invest into Bitcoin. If you’re a notoriously shrewd investor and you make a killing by buying undervalued assets, you know damn wel you aren’t buying Bitcoin, which is sure as shit NOT undervalued at 10k.

We’ll make it to the moon, but we need the real world adoption. If it doesn’t come, then speculation is all we are left with and it’s a pretty big nothing burger if you ask me

That said, I think BTC at 9200+ is too high. I expect a retrace to the 7500-8800 range over the next month or so, and we should even out at about 7.5k for mid 2018 and start a slow and sustainable climb à la 2014. I don’t anticipate a new ATH in 2018, and I’m seeing a potential double top at 9750.

But this shit pumps on no news all the time, so who knows
I'm gonna update my position here.

Honestly I thought 9.4 is gonna hold, it didn't. Took a stupid move to add at 9.5 and then closed at be at 9.2 on local bottom instead of waiting for 9150 to break down.

The inability to push through 9.45 and small buying pressure makes me think this should at least revisit low 9k.

Shorting here, probably gonna bail on higher high or 9.5 break
https://www.tradingview.com/x/J7atTiwb/

strong support there
Doesn’t look like 10k will be broken for a little while. Think we will touch mid to low 8 k before making a true run past 10k. Laddering buys from 8550 to 8100. Will close them if we break below 7800
Shorts are great, come to think of it. People are essentially selling bitcoin, but with the promise to buy back in the future. Shorts are bullish, I love shorts.
Just came home and saw that my 9066 order was filled, nice bottom picking! Hope we see 9.4k again. 
Is there video footage of Bill Gates bad mouthing bitcoin? Or was this one sentence taken out of context from a full interview?

As there is a video on YouTube from a while back in which he seems to be praising it like it will be the future. 

It seems like fake news to me, just like this SEC Eth hearing.

Remember when Jamie Dimon caused the drop by saying its a fraud? That was a pretty substantial drop from just a few words and he was the first one.

Now it seems like every time we seem to be recovering another one will come out and say some negative stuff, but the comments that are being made now aren't having as much of an effect like they first did.

How many times can you cry wolf before people become immune to it.
I'm playing around with the testnet on BitMex to learn about leverage trading and have a few newbie questions.

1) I don't actually set an entry point, it just kicks off from where the price currently is?

2) The mark price doesn't ever seem to move, how long does it typically take to adjust?

3) There is no need to set a close, correct? If I want to open a long, I can just let it sit?

4) Are there hourly or daily fees for leaving a position open?

5) The cost vs order value. The cost is what it is to open the position, but where can I find the maximum I would lose if the position were to be liquidated?

Does anyone have any good resources they'd like to share? Thanks!
I’m starting to think this may be accumulation as well. Either that or some really delusional bulls. These dips are getting scooped up before they can even start. The low on the breakdown of this bearflag was less than $100 below the previous dip’s.

Edit: Either that or a re-test of support like we had on the previous bearflag, considering this one started showing signs of breaking so much earlier.
Quick short spike:

For those of you who have a trading stack and a holding stack... how do you stay calm and HODL through a dump?  Don't you consider cashing out that holding stack to come back in after the dump?

What % of your BTC is for trading and holding?


!long XBTUSD 9137 5X 40%
1day bbands pretty tighter than they've been in like 6 months. We also just dipped below the midline for the first time since our mega short squeeze that somehow turned into an overly optimistic bull trend but whatever
1.2k sell wall on Bitstamp, that is quite huge for this exchange...
Bailed on my long at break-even. I have no more faith in this. I might even flip short if the market provides another entry around 9400.
Yesterday, i spent quite a while on a write up about SEC news, volatility, demand and some other shit. 

SEC ended up being bollocks, 5 green weeks in a row and consensus next week so im expecting at least a bit of a pullback before all the hype next week

entered short 9278 x5. SL 9500. Target around 8800-8700 unless it just dumps then we'll see.

edit: stopped at break even. bullish div on 15min? https://www.tradingview.com/x/WWvk4BlG/
volume isnt really there but got an exam tomorrow and friday so getting into a positin in the first place was pretty dumb.
I closed my short from 9920 at 9600 ish and closed my long from 9180 at 9300 last night. This morning I realized we sitll havent quite tested the channel bottom yet and added some more buy orders at 9160, 9130, and a big one at 9030. 

Went out for a smoke and I'm filled at an average of 9100. I closed half at 9120 because I realized it was a big of an irresponsibly large long. BUT
,

some of you are saying a chhannel broke down? This is what I'm seeing... No breakdown here, not even on the wick.

https://ibb.co/daNgDn
Pullin my hair out tryna read the charts. Any guesses on How reliable the bbands and RSI on the 1 hour chart? Would it be better to just make trades from a shorter time frame or increase long than 1 hour? Looking at the one week charts we may have more room to fall... this seems likely? **Calling all crystal ball readers*
!short XBTUSD 9300 3X 100%

I would love to see the buy walls get eaten, mostly because seeing HUUGE walls get eaten is great entertainment

The quality is strong with this post /s

[So here is a take on a breakdown of a rising wedge](https://www.tradingview.com/x/yJahJ0cx)
Looking at the rainbow chart on https://www.moonmath.win/, all previous bubbles went over the rainbow. Maybe the true bubble didn't even start yet?

Hmmm... woke up in the netherworld. Was going to short at 9100 or long at 9200 and it was right at 9150. Small long at 9150. I don't think this bearwhale has what it takes.
Hold the meme support like your lives depend on it! I did my job and bought 9030, did you?
[deleted]
My bet is diamond bottom/reversal re-accumulation pattern. 

Sticking to muh longs. Have we stacked up enough shorts to have a little squeeze yet? Funding seems to be quite reasonable again all of the sudden. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/OJ3VrL7e/
I think the most important level for today is 9200. This is the daily middle bband, if we close below it, then this is starting to look bearish enough for a proper pullback. Next level is 9011, the daily Tenkan(going long here).  
https://www.tradingview.com/x/fnPUVVbM/   
edit: wrong chart
Interesting timing during that rise just now. It happened precisely as Trump confirmed that the US is pulling out of the Iran deal and imposing maximum sanctions. Coincidence? 
Nice call u/_chewtoy_

Sold my gambling stack at the peak, bought the dip, thanks very much. 
An interesting read here: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-bitcoin-could-rally-more-than-70-in-the-coming-week-fundstrats-lee-says-2018-05-08

In short, the conference next week could come with some movement.

Does anyone think we could bart right back up? volume is low, and we havent seen a real bart pattern in a while.

inverse bart pattern would be insanely bullish. 
"buffet, gates, munger: 

the scary thought for billionaires is to wake up one day and discover that their lifelong obsession of accumulating & being evaluated in fiat terms is slowly fading in relevance."

Edit: Since when does posting a quote = endorsement? i.e. u/654278841
Can't imagine the next few months play out any different than 2014, except it looks weaker with less hopium so far. 

Just like 2014, the market broke the steep log trend line and then establish a newer, less steep line. Meanwhile the market will chase the top of the original line down to God knows where. 

[LN Topology](https://lnmainnet.gaben.win/) looks bullish af, imo, but networks take time and organic growth to develop. Still, the LN FUD over hub and spoke, institutional control, money transmitter registration, etc. has basically all been proven to be just that, FUD. LN is by far the most bullish fundamental factor, much more so than anything to do with Goldman Sachs, CFTC, NASDAQ or any other market based news. LN will demonstrate that most alts don't have a place to stand in the future. Sound money is made stronger with adoption, consolidation and distribution (Metcalfe's law). Once scaling is demonstrated on LN (not to mention privacy features, instant speeds and negligible fees), the final piece of the "money" use case is solved for and all alts that rely on FUDdy narratives will fall by the wayside and the market will consolidate around Bitcoin for hard/sound money. 

Interestingly enough, true LN adoption at scale may coincide with increased hype over 2020 halvening (and better exchanges/liquidity) so I expect the next bull run to out-do 2017 but I highly doubt we're not going to see lower lows this year. The stars are simply not aligned to facilitate this move right now and the ongoing PnD behavior of alts just goes to show that the market is still flirting with bubble mechanics. Historically, downward price discovery phases of Bitcoin re-test areas near previous breakout/bull-run/ATH. Obviously, this is about $1.2K for the current situation. I'm still somewhat skeptical that it will get *that* low but it's certainly not out of the question. 

Overall, it's a good thing. Bitcoin is not ready for large scale adoption and the more time spent in price discovery mode will benefit liquidity and speculators willing to take on the 'risk'. It's better that the tech more closely aligns with adoption than what we saw in December, which was beyond what the Bitcoin network could handle (particularly because wallets and exchanges screwed the pooch with Segwit and batching implementation). With better supporting infrastructure in place, Bitcoin will be positioned to *actually* reach the moon (i.e. approach some sort of equilibrium). Anyone who thinks that 20K was the toppity top is fooling themselves. 

edit: as always, I've pissed people off, both bears and bulls. 
We confidently broke through the [support line I had drawn](https://www.tradingview.com/x/cbXLXxkz/) and closed my long for a small loss.

!long XBTUSD close 9220

I'll be looking to short from anything close to 9300. And stops above 9500.
Expecting to drop sub $9k today. Hope for bulls $8800 will hold, otherwise drop to $7.8k. Funny how a few hundred drop could set into motion almost thousands of dollars decrease in just a few days!
Would you rather be long or short [this instrument](https://imgur.com/2NILbxc)?

Extra points for guessing what it is.
(RSI is 38 -- don't know why it didn't show up).
The buying pressure at $9,200 yesterday was very high and I’m seeing more of the same here in the $9,150+ range. I’m betting this is accumulation, so leaving my long open. 

edit: added to my long sub $9,200

edit: added again at $9,050 bc it feels uncomfortable and I'm a stubborn fuck
Let's take 9k down.
All these beartards are making me want to add to my long again.
When people say 'close' what do they mean?  Obviously I know what it means in 'normal' trading.
anyone else fed up with this "system overloaded" situation with bitmex? any other places to trade with similar leverage?
How is GDAX compared to Kraken? Is it really cheaper?
Anyone have a link of the often touted/popular 2017 btc prediction chart?  It was a chart that plotted the 2017 rise and then fall in early 2018.  I keep forgetting to bookmark it.  I think we've fallen out of the charts prediction bubbles, but I wanted to take a glance again.
damn, and here i was contemplating if i should add somewhere inbetween 7.4 > 7.6k (€ price)

Missed my oppertunity, but i love whats happening here regardless
Good short entry was short lived unfortunately, closed from $9,909 at $9,733. 

!short XBTUSD close 9733

Long again with the new position just under $9,000. We stayed in that range for no longer than 10 minutes. 
[This comparison was made a month ago](https://prnt.sc/jfhstm), but which line chart is 1982 Gold bubble and which one is Bitcoin? Interesting comparison. Spoiler alert: Gold went on to make a lower low.
1876: "This 'telephone' has too many shortcomings to be seriously considered as a means of communication." — William Orton, President of Western Union.

1903: “The horse is here to stay but the automobile is only a novelty – a fad.” — President of the Michigan Savings Bank advising Henry Ford’s lawyer, Horace Rackham, not to invest in the Ford Motor Company.

1961: "There is practically no chance communications space satellites will be used to provide better telephone, telegraph, television or radio service inside the United States." — T.A.M. Craven, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) commissioner.

1995: "I predict the Internet will soon go spectacularly supernova and in 1996 catastrophically collapse." — Robert Metcalfe, founder of 3Com.

2007: “There’s no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share.” — Steve Ballmer, Microsoft CEO.

2018: “[Bitcoin] as an asset class, you’re not producing anything, so you shouldn’t expect it to go up. It’s kind of a pure ‘greater fool theory’ type of investment.” Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft Corporation.

Congratulations, Mr. Gates. That's how history will now remember you.
Oh well I got caught in that bear trap and added to my short...bad timing.  Not really any way to guard against that, except cover quickly when it gets pumped higher.

I didn't cover all of my position and going to stay short for now.  It's mostly a hedge short anyway, but I am net short as of about 30 min ago.   If they manufacture some tethers and pump this higher, I'll just take a hit, but I'm sure not longing hard right now.   

I'll have to scale out of my short if it keeps moving up though, but that is true for every trade and I don't ever let me it move against me 3%+ if I can help it.  Even 3% is a lot.
breaking below 9000 outta the question yet?
Stopped out of my 9300 long with no loss.  Trying again !long 9230 
Anyone else have any thoughts on this being an entry point given the stochastic rsi on the 4hr charts? 
https://postimg.cc/image/h5hihleij/
Well for the short term it's all about 9200. Break through that and I can definitely see 9k going and we the downward trend keeps going for another week or so.

Was hoping we'd bounce off this 2nd 9.2k hit but not seeing it as of yet.

Seems to be a matter of time before we break down 
Sellers don't wanna sell, buyers don't wanna buy. Consolidation time. 
Whatever.
Been waiting for weeks for a nice dip.  Gonna set an order at $8750 and hope it hits overnight.  Time to attend to my nightly man duties.  Nightnight.
Think thats over... looked like stop hunt right into their 9275 hidden wall to me. 
I'm really fucking salty today. My large position from yesterday \(I added to it\) got hit on it's SL. I've had transitioned into larger positions with tighter stops recently but I just seem to keep getting caught out on major moves.

The position was also on Okex futures \- which has just had it's premium come down significantly. Oh well.

!short close
Hi guys, just wondering, what moving averages is everyone using?

im currently having a look at 24, 38, 79. they seem to work quite nicely on 4h and 1D but still need to look at their interactions a lot more
We've tested the apex of the symmetric triangle we were all watching a week ago.  https://imgur.com/YAb075p  I've read that that can be expected.

So perhaps we will climb up a little from here.  But based on the last few days I don't expect much.  And I have absolutely no confidence that we"ll meet its original 10.3 target by the 10th or so.

Will be adding to long around here to lower ca and potentially derisk it near break even, and maybe even take a tiny smidgen of profit.  I'll bail if we break through that apex line and stay down.  If I was on spot this would all be ok, but I opened this long on June when the premium was higher so it's a bit underwater and a pretty high risk situation.

Edit:  [where I'm tracking this position for the bot](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8hkslr/daily_discussion_monday_may_07_2018/dykyzxg/)
I have a short entry from $9400.

Would it be a bad idea to open a long for the equal amount here @ $9,165? 

Open a long here from $9,165 with stops below $9,050 to hedge against my short. I feel like both entry’s are far enough away from each other 
I love the smell of liquidity in the morning 
US President Trump will be making an announcement at 2:00 pm EST today about US policy with respect to the Iran nuclear deal. This could set the stage for increased uncertainty in the middle east. We are already seeing oil prices cross over 70 (which is high) because of this. I wonder if this will have a noticeable impact on global markets, and more specifically in crypto.  I know the demand for BTC in Iran is low compared to the rest of the world, but I'm also interested in what increased uncertainty would mean for the rest of the world.

Anyone in Iran, please feel free to chime in with what you are feeling, hearing, etc.

What if the 2011 bubble was wave 1, the collapse was wave 2,  the 2013 bubble was wave 3, the 2014 collapse was wave 4, and the 2017 bubble was wave 5?   We would be then embarking upon an A-B-C correction down to a price in the high single digits down to double digits.
Warren Buffet: Bitcoin is useless and will crash.

Bitcoiners: This man worth 80+ billion USD doesn't understand tech.

Bill Gates: I know about tech. Bitcoin is useless and will crash.

Bitcoiners: This man worth 90+ billion USD is scared of Bitcoin.
Actually i had a theory guys binance just released a new scam coin called bytecoin (lol original name), and it had HUGE volume, like 2x bitcoins's normal volume.

I'm thinking bitcoins got sold to pump into the scamcoin and that caused the drop today.

I have a question : if you open a short or long position on bitfinex, is there a way to check the volume you are shorting/longing with. 

Exemple : if i want to fake a lot of long, i open 1M contract at 0,00001 USD. 

I am saying it because I believe some whale are playing with the market and rekting us on our positions.
I'm looking for ppls opinions if the Futures markets could really be surpressing the price or is this correction just a coincidence?  There's so many factors that affect the price of bitcoin, I just don't see how it could have such a big impact.  
it's a movie scene https://www.tradingview.com/x/zDAax3KY/
Bipolar: Bitstamp seems bearish AF and Bitfinex bullish. 
Looks like bitfinex account in portugal is no more!

This rise has all the characteristics of a dead cat bounce. Doesn't look good for bulls.
Well, Asia is not going to be taking profits tonight/today so that usually means that they'll be buying.  On the other hand, someone is still dumping (you'd think they'd learn) so we probably either stay even or go down a bit over the next 12 hours.  Don't see it going under $9K for long, but it could.  Still itching to buy but gonna sleep on it.
I very much appreciate the depth of your comments.
So short if $9000 is convincingly broken, long if $9500 is retaken and don't do anything in between as it is too unpredictable. 

May I ask how likely you think it is that $9000 will hold chew? 

And finally, if we do drop below and start falling, do you think we see a huge green candle like before that shoots us back up? Thanks for all the analysis.
thanks for the input , dont you think the rejection from 10k was a bit too strong?
Great summary, this reinforces what I was already thinking.

In addition to the things you mentioned, the resistance of the previous symmetrical triangle could be acting as support: https://www.tradingview.com/x/1kismAH4/

Not to mention the 0.5fib of the retrace from 11.8 to 6.4k.
I agree with everything you've said. My concern is this fall seems to be happening in slow mo. Past falls from key resistance/round numbers have happened in a similar fashion except 2x as fast. This slow motion has me thinking there is a larger play in play, possibly to 10k again. I'm concerned cuz I'm 50% stack in a shirt from $9350 but not planning to close until 10300
> To me, it's starting to look like sellers could have painted themselves into a bit of a corner here. There's strong support immediately below price, and sellers failed to pierce the descending support of that wedge. Buyers might just have a launch point here to break through the wedge resistance and retest $10,000.

I'm betting on this being the case
Thanks for your efforts and contribution, always very useful! So far buying pressure has been lower than after previous recent dips. Why do you think we will have steam enough to test old support turned resistance? It didn't even bounce so hard from 9000.
finally, I see the forest for the trees
Wake me up when we are out of the woods :-)

Seriously though, isn't PPC already taken (peercoin)?
I don't think any bears are denying that. I'm bearish as hell medium term, but buuuuuuullish as fuuuuuuck long term.
19x?? Pfft. 

$220 > $19600 = 89x 

89 x 5k = $445,000
Self fulfilling prophecy will fulfill when enough people will believe in it's fulfilling.

If enough people will believe in 5k then there will be nobody to buy until then.
except maybe this time it is different?
Nah. Rat poison bro!
I’m fearing for down as we’re nearer the upper edge
A sensible call.
What does the failure (once again) to break 9260-70 tell you?
selling action before the weekend?  It's tuesday.  pretty safe prediction.

Emotions 
You're comment here is just as predictable...

I'm fulfilling step 3-5 of the conversation by being the experienced guy calling out the new guy for just noticing the trend where rBitcoinMarkets overreacts to every situation, followed by someone else posting how that's why they use the sub as an inverse indicator, followed by this post....
Context is key. *How* we got where we are is more important than the number. 
Always adjust your views to market conditions. 

flip flopping is the way to go, and with this market you definitely have to be on your toes 24/7

Markets discount everything.
Absolutely nuts. I'm 100&#37; aware crypto is a heavily unregulated space, but if rumors like this propagated in conventional investment space and *nothing was done to rectify the ill formed rumor* there would be serious legal ramifications.

Meanwhile it's just another instance of FUD \(whether accidental or otherwise\) on a very long list for crypto. 

This \+ buffet \+ a dozen other negative stories this last week and you've got to wonder whether there's an interest in keeping BTC under the 10k/11.6k for a little longer. *takes off tinfoil hat*
Do you have your cloud on some sort of special settings? The default look completely different than your chart.
You, Sir, ***are*** a pro. A pro isn't someone who makes craptons of money, he's someone that knows how to walk away with his winnings in his pockets.

Feel good about yourself and be happy with your accomplishment! Don't need to make billions of dollars to know you have it good.
nicely done. how did you come up with your amount? % of your wealth? a nice round number? also, do you have a minimum amount of time you'll hodl for?
That's awesome. No reason to continue trading this headache of a market if you've already reached your goal. Sleep and a life are more valuable anyway.

What was your trading strategy and how'd you arrive at the number you chose for your goal?
another farewell letter.. 
reminds me of late december.

care to share your "meh" secrets of retired meh'er?
welcome to the elite
Good luck, but just keep in mind that "hodl" mode can lead to you losing 50% of your money in the next few weeks/months if things don't go the way you prefer.
Until buffet can explain how a currency system should be designed to protect currency holders, and then explain how bitcoin doesn't fit that design, i could care less about his opinion.
he told you. As he explained that people who invest in btc often get angry when you criticize it. so aks yourself, do you get angry of your "investment" goes to 0?
If you truly believe it won't change a thing, and with that price should not mater. That reminds me a bit of Vitalik when he said to not focus on the price.
A) buffets hates all commodities because they have no cash flows
B) it's government propaganda cloaked as financial advice.
C) Bill Gates is being forced to toe the line.
D) Level of hatred and verbiage tells me they fear it, and its not 'just some ponzi' which they claim.
E) I'm seeing synchronization in verbiage and stances, meaning there was a meeting about it, between at least those 3, probably involving many more.  And a policy/stance was set.


And, I dont think its bad.. for social reasons - I like all 3 of them, a lot, and respect their leadership.   But for investment reasons - ignore it.




Microsoft got it right in a big way in the 90s and then subsequently dropped the balls for a decade until the xbox came out

otherwise nothing to see here
Yea hate to say it but I think you might get stopped out here
selling pressure so strong.
BTC is not a "safety asset," JFC.

think of changing career, politician?
Good thinking the direction won't be set until  volume returns 
Pretty understandable, lol. Seems like we are in a giant bull flag on the verge of breakdown on the 1d chart. Oscillators are also right around the middle, so it could go either way. If you short from 9.3-9.4k, the R/R seems 50/50 as well. Tough call, I'm following other traders here and hedging as well.

Obviously the most important part. 
deets? Royal Oak? 25k isn’t exactly impressive from Audemars, now is it? ;)


If he was wearing the brand new GMT, I’d be jealous
i dunno these are some ugly watches (first time i hear about the brand, just googled it). but then i dont have 9 or 4 million dollars around. so maybe that's why.

oversold on the 1hr RSI as well
Exactly the way I see it too. BTC seems to want to go up, but I have trust issues in this market. Could still be a huge bull trap indeed, would be scary if true.
[deleted]
bingo.. it's a trader's market.  The bounce off 10k proved that.   10k shouldnt matter THAT much.

>If you are a spot hodler and not day trading, set 2 alarms, one for 7699 and another one for 10901 and forget about the charts.

I understand the logic here, but I just find myself amused by how this is basically saying "Sell at a lower price then here or buy at a higher price!".

You also mention market makers, but if you wanna avoid their games, don't follow their price moves. 

There are no magical price points where market makers suddenly lose grip of the market and now it's safe to buy or sell because it exited a range. In fact I think they'd very much like you to believe there is such a price in either direction.

Thank God. Ty.
We are not going down... Maybe 100$ or something... ( shaking the weak Nellies )

Flirting with the 10K is next step. Matter of time... Not today but next days - week.

Thinking the same.... we hit spring at 91XX and not going back there. Chop chop accumulation until we push for 10k again. 
Bitfinex long is still 1.5:1 compared to short.  It could be a good place to go short... ;-)
Binance sub 9k, bounced pretty hard off 8984

Not falling for it 


This dude is still smoking his silk road stash. 
You got it backwards, to the left are all the known past prices of bitcoin, to the right are all unknown future prices of bitcoin. Price will definitely move to the right. :)
We will never see Bitcoin above 10k?
Fuckin missed my buy limit by $2!

Edit: holy shit, anyway I actually managed to just significantly derisk my failing long on this bounce close to the new CA, locking in only tiny losses so far, so not going to complain!!! (but of course if that buy had gone through I'd have derisked at break even heh)
Or right now :) 
Blame Trump. Iran nuke deal canx. WW3 looms.
I'm not seeing a breakdown, even on the wicks.

Drew the support line I think you're referring to with a verticle/horizontal line showing the current log downtrend value of 7519 as I have it drawn.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/PuYb9Fev/
Yep, I make the linear support zone 7350ish as well. It’s probably going to bounce off that line at some point. 
Resistance turned support? 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/cJmPMJw1/
I see the channel broken in any case:

https://www.dropbox.com/s/as9jpqexqxz99ji/Finex%20-%20BTCUSD%20-%2020180508.PNG?dl=0
On May first, we broke up out of our bearflag with a 300-400$ candle. 

This is the first bearflag consolidation we broke down from since the 26th. It was looking promising because history repeated itself but at a higher price point, but it broke down for the first time instead of breaking up. 

Buyers aren’t there at the high price points, and sellers are just *pwning* any time the price jumps up the slightest bit.

I was super bullish  last few days, held me underwater 9.5k long for some time but as we failed to break up from the bearflag and rejected off $9,456 it worries me so I closed my long, and opened a short 
Chewy draw line for ascending channel which begins at 7.8. That one broke down, but it doesn't mean it'll drop harder.

If we look at 9.2 it was good support and good resistance in the past, breaking it down isn't good for bulls. For now 9k held.

As for me I'm gonna pay bigger attention to the market when it goes back above 9.2. 9k bounce wasn't as big as it should to consider it as a good support.
Not sure about the Unchi looks more like a Chinpo to Bara formation still a bad time to be a Kuma.
I hope those that don't know Japanese take the time to look some of these words up :)
is he trolling or is that real TA?  Like those dragonball powering up memes on the way up last year

Those sound like delicious sushi rolls.
That bounce from 9.2 was kinda strange. Like it just the drop to 9k didn't happen and 9.2 is support again.
it points to a little accumulation here.  But seems like a real weird spot to accumulate.  Most likely shorts closing positions.


when would you say is nearish?
I'm from Iran, first use case of BTC here is the same.
If only there was a "stable" currency. $ and € for example get inflated aswell \(roughly 1\-2&#37; p/a\) so its a really bad idea to keep fiat money on ur bank account, yet theres still loads of people who do exactly that.
BTC can't be a hedge against anything with this volatility. Massive, unpredictable swings between inflation and deflation make it impossible to rely on. 
yes, eat all of our shirts!

Great. Then why do we still need bitcoin /S
They're rolling out faster payments via Barclays to select users until a full launch. Maybe you're a select user. I haven't seen a public mention anywhere of it being available for all yet. 
What??? We can convert to GBP in coinbase and transfer as GBP instead of Euros?
Didn't know we could transfer in GBP?
I made a transfer from Coinbase to my US bank a few weeks ago and it only took a day or two, so they're definitely speedier that direction.
Which bank are you with? My withdrawals are still 24 hours. 
I’m keeping an eye on this triangle too.

We just had an **ascending triangle** break down, and now we have a descending triangle, which will probably break up because BTC likes to play the opposite game 
i think we all see that wedge from 10k.. and we all know what happens  in 1-2 days when we hit the end of it..  TO DA MOOOOOON!

wedge from 10k = to da moon
but what about the daily candles the bull flag that started this all is finally falling apart.

I'm a bit wary of this golden cross. 

Last time a daily golden cross happened was 10/29/2015 and it signaled the end of the bear market. 

Before that was on 06/03/2014 but it was just a bull trap and the bear market resumed. It was in between 2 death crosses.

Not sure what to think of it with yesterday's rejected breakdown.

Most traders would do better if they traded less. Not more. 

Myself included. 

As /u/sloppysynapses pointed out, 1 big win is a lot less stressful than 15 small wins and 5 small losses. 

To expand on that, let's take a look at the range [between $8,800 and $10,000](https://imgur.com/a/vGByIQE).

Think back to each of those strong dips and each of those strong pumps. Each one certainly appeared like the market had the strength to break out of the range...but each reversed course. 

Some might look at that chop and think, "man, I could have made a fortune scalping that range."

I look at it and think, "man, I could have lost a fortune scalping that range." 

Scalping is a lot harder than simply moving with the trend. 
We all want a strong trend so we can know what to do. $10k to $20k is a much less stressful trade than 15 $1000 wins and 5 $1000 losses or something
If you see future in Bitcoin you own a hodling stack.
Yes, it matters to me as a trader, because ATH would involve crazy volatility and opportunity on the way up there.  Raging bull market is often the most profitable one to trade.  

If crypto starts to fail and die off, then it's party over for traders.
Trading on the 15 seems risky
Lol, was getting my hopes up.  Possibly just a little pull back to give a push upward.
Gonna play devil's advocate here and say its only present on the 15m and lower time frames. There was also one with the upper resistance at $9,450 or so before we broke down. 

Could be different this time though. It feels like my sentiment is violently swinging.
I was watching the same.  I had brought my bad long's ca down to the top of that triangle.  Closed the long on the breakdown.
I thought that as well, but we haven't seen a sign of weakness. I interpret this as reaccumulation.

http://d.stockcharts.com/img/articles/2015/07/1438369533740479636177.png
I'm looking at this too, and that's certainly possible. The question is, are we still in distribution or are we back in accumulation? 
I have that line on my chart as well, but the number of times we've crossed it leads me to think it's not that applicable at this stage. 
In the next hour, I wouldn't expect to see above 9100.
https://www.tradingview.com/x/fpfm38Yw/

We broke through our ascending channel that met in the middle of our wedge. If we close under it, i expect it to act as resistance. 

Don’t think this is going to bounce very far. 
> If we stay under about $9060

...? If it dumps further the bull divs disappear
~9061, approximately

how high is the moon?



well if you go by order books it seems there's a lot of people waiting to buy at $8800. 4000 coins to get down to $8800 on bfx...it would take 4k coins to get to $9800 from here

so  I suppose buying from here down to there isn't a bad idea. Can just cut it loose on a break below $8800
This is usually moved to the hot wallet right?  So it can be bought or sold? Doesn't indicate much, unless I'm mistaken
Maybe going to a hodler/ accumulator cold storage?
Halfway there.  I'm happy, not underwater anymore and near new CA.  I don't expect to make any profit though, just not eat shit.
Yeah, I'm pretty impressed that market went through 9.2 in one big candle but seemed to stop here.

Futures premium still below $100 so it looks like market is in disbelief on that pump.

Personally I don't believe the market can go all the way up back to 9.5 without going further up.
Yeah, he mentioned 9400 might be tested again before a more significant dip. This was the slightly better case, he talked about another scenario where it would continue to dip from 9100.
In my experience, there are two types of people who might actually entertain this idea.

1: The "2014 Ground Hog Day Adventists".

2: Those who believe the market is a sentient being with an inclination towards "inflicting pain".

There isn't enough tin foil for either of these groups individually, let alone combined.

But to answer your question--yes, there are people who believe we will go sideways/down for 1.5 years.
>Why does it have to be Moon or Goblin Town

Because Bitcoin will either approach equilibrium at a much higher market cap (on par with the sum of the valuations of systems it disrupts) or it'll just succumb to the fringe (with market cap 100 mil or below). Floating indeterminately between these two scenarios isn't sustainable for long, imo. I happen to think the former scenario is far more likely (barring a black swan event) and Bitcoin will approach a market cap between $10 and $50 Trillion in a 5-15 year time span. 
might be 6-12, unless some real good/bad news happens
If it stays sideways for a long time then it proves to be good store of value then its value must increase with halving. The question is what is your projection after 1.5 years? If you think it will go up why not just buy now? We are always betting what will it become not what it is now. If you think potential of bitcoin is around 10k at the long run then maybe it can stay like that for 1.5 yrs.

Simpleton minds can only see extremes.  They can't see anything in between.  You might as well try to get a dog to do theoretical physics.

I've given up trying to work out which way it's going. I still reckon another attempt at 10k this week (and one that will fail again).

A big market buy can come at any time, that it's hit a local double bottom again (at the time of typing so don't fry me) but not fallen through smells of accumulation.

Edit - well that sucks.
You are a brave men! My short is still open and i'm waiting for confirmation 1st.
4h still has a lot of room, not even below 30. shorter time RSIs indicate we stop here, but somtimes bitcoins gives a shit on short term RSIs... ;\)
I'm not so convinced. I track the alts that are very sensitive to the price of BTC and they aren't really buying it either. I've said it before, but it bears repeating: alts can be good indicators of predicting immediate / short-term movements in BTC. Those who trade alts during high periods of volatility can have a lot more to lose than if trading BTC/USD.
nice entry dude
One thing I will say:

If this continues to decline, this will solidify for me that Bitmex futures traders are — as a group — some of the dumbest people on the planet. 

The market popped from $6,400 to $9,750 and the premium remained at neutral or less than 1% (and sometimes even traded negative).

Suddenly, and without warning, they went full bulltard and started trading at a $400 premium while spot was making a relatively weak and slow upward push to $10,000. 

And even if the market DOES push higher here, they're currently doing the exact opposite of what one would expect to see in that scenario: reducing the premium as price makes a small drop instead of increasing it. 

There should be more buying pressure on the dip, resulting in an inflating premium. Not the reverse.
Trying to predict movement based on mex premium is pointless.
futures forward curve
sell pressure higher, longs getting fat, 7kbtc fatter than shorts.

More supply than demand. (at these prices at least)
Twas just the bear flag breaking down. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/jBXGENad/
A bear market 
Somebody's dumping.  
If you are surprised by this market action, then you have some issues that you may want to address before putting any money into a position.
TA is apparently not working those past days. Good traders actually wrote that many times today; things like "this doesn't make sense"

And I, as a non TA expert can see with my dumb eyes that it doesn't make sense either...

In summary: without hype at a large scale BTC isn't worth the attention of traders.

But hey at least we got all the "this is good for Bitcoin" in place like removing 2+ billion people the right to trade crypto. Not allowing South Korea to trade outside of their country (or people from outside to trade there), we got CME, we've had the nice mainstream pump and I probably forget a lot of things that people were classifying as good for Bitcoin.

Meh...
This is what it feels like to be “squeezed”. 
We went up for the better part of a month. A lot. There will be days, or several of them, where we don't. TLDR; markets.  

In regards to TA, I think the $8500-$8800 tiers are areas to watch, below that things may get dicey.  Right now, we are probably going to form a weekly higher low, then try to establish a lower high as b-bands tighten, then we will see what happens. 
https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8hkslr/daily_discussion_monday_may_07_2018/dyl05b7/?context=2

Still following pretty close to my expectation here.  We've possibly set a weekly lower high which will confirm with a daily higher low and then a daily lower high (classic head and shoulders pattern) or invalidate with a daily higher high (bullish continuation past 10k).

At some point we will need to retrace on the weekly time frame to set a weekly higher low.
Remember when we were at 15k and you were calling for 50k?
I was never calling for that shit. I've been calling for low for the past 6 months. xD
This is all.. 2 hours - 4 hours - 8 hours talk.  Patience and we will see 10K.

I agree, the buying pressure yesterday at $9,200 was voracious and I expect more accumulation in the $9,050-9,250 range. 
+1
But there's absolutely none once we approach 9.4k. I'm finding this very difficult to read.

It seems this sub is 50/50 too.

The 1-4h EMA bands are telling me a different story 
My 2s:

1 Bitcoin = $10k is too much, fair enough, I see the argument, however, my thought is how many people buying bitcoin are buying one whole Bitcoin?

My broad point is that for millennial and younger generations, bitcoin represents a way for them to easily invest their pocket money in something and potentially watch it grow. You don't see many 14 year olds with Vanguard accounts or even savings accounts, but I bet you a fair few of them have coinbase on their phone. To my mind, this is adoption, almost more so than acceptance as a currency by retailers. 'The unbanked' don't just exist in the third world.

Bitcoin (and by extension crypto) has sparked a wave of financial literacy among younger generations, I can confidently say myself that I wouldn't even be thinking about ETFs and index funds if I hadn't started with bitcoin.

EDIT: disclaimer - i'm 29 and bitcoin was my first investment four years ago (but i didn't even consider it an investment at the time)
Honestly though the difference between the current price and your perceived fair value is so negligible in the grand scheme of a speculative asset that it doesnt make much sense to make a prediction like that 
The whole country of Argentina seems to have a pretty good use case for it, as did Greece 8 or so years ago.
> Crypto is a speculative asset with no real use case outside of illicit activities and gambling at this point in time.

Beg to differ m8.

I've:

bought tokenized equity (in a company & real estate) w/ 24/7 liquidity. 

used decentralized livestreaming & decentralized social media like peepeth.

serve files to/from decentralized storage.

spoken to young, travelling Venezuelans financially 'saved' by crypto as a permissionless wealth store [to some degree]. 

List goes on.

None feasible without crypto.

It's just not widely distributed. 

And it's not common in the Bitcoin community (more on the Ethereum side).
So you think it’s too high at 9300 and that it’s ridiculous that the crypto market cap is higher than the GDP of Iran. And that it is a speculative investment with no real use cases. But then at 7500-8800, it’s totally fine?

If it’s overvalued based on your points, the overvaluation is definitely more than ~20%
In my opinion you’re pricing bitcoin incorrectly. The future possibilities must be priced in. You must price in the possibility of a future where bitcoin is in widespread use and the fact there is a very limited supply of them. The lack of adoption right now is irrelevant. If you think large scale real world adoption is likely in the next 10 years then 10k is an absurdly low price. If you don’t think this will happen, then even 7k is absurdly high.

Personally I’m banking on future adoption. But to price it the way you have makes no sense to me. You’re not asking what it’s worth now but what it will be worth in the future, it’s a speculative asset.
While Bitcoin does not have “intrinsic” value, it does have valuable resources backing it in the form of the network infrastructure. 

Bitcoin has become to be viewed less as currency and more as an asset. If you want to leverage the features of Bitcoin for any reason whatsoever, you must use the asset. 

This is also how use of the protocol is kept from being abused, by limiting the supply. This is one reason why bitcoins have value — the limited resources of the network are represented by a limited number of bitcoins. It just so happens that the value of bitcoins is being used by most people as a currency or as a means of saving. 

This has caused some in the community to decry the 'HODL' philosophy but if you believe in the future widespread utility of the Bitcoin infrastructure then it is hard to imagine anything other then an increase in value over time and this leads to the temptation to hoard it away for future.

The real and present value of Bitcoin is that it is a store of value, means of exchange and an infrastructure that can support and secure ANY type of transaction.

A transaction that is verified by the mining infrastructure with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of hardware scattered throughout the world. A transaction that is broadcast once again \(as part of the verified block\) another 10,000 times. A transaction that will be permanently stored in that block, on the blockchain, on the hard drives of tens of thousands of computers. A transaction that uses community\-sourced bandwidth, community\-sourced disk storage, and a nanosecond of computer power from a global mega\-cluster of computers.

I would suggest the true value of all of that is more then $10k per bitcoin.
The entire world of Valuation is completely based on what someone else is willing to pay for it. Diamonds aren't exactly rare, but are expensive because people are willing to pay that much. So is the stock price of a Fortune 500. Combined with that is the intangible possibility of growth. Are you telling me IF Coca Cola were up for sale, its valuation would be equal to its MC? No way. Its Brand Value (which itself is massive) would 5X that. What gave WhatsApp value? Why should anyone pay 1 Billion dollar for a piece of tech with no revenue stream and an idea that can be replicated easily? Also the very idea that Bitcoin is a decentralised store of value, that itself is immensely "valuable". Honestly neither of us can "fair" price it. Just like people think Gold is worth X, hence Bitcoin will be worth Y. 
gates said it right, the technology is good and there are some good aspects to it, but the speculative mind of bitcoin is not good. And to me he is 100% right.
> Crypto is a speculative asset with no real use case outside of illicit activities and gambling at this point in time.

Money. Money is the use case. Fiat is dog shit money that doesn't preserve value or empower the capital stored in it. 

How do you know bitcoin isn't undervalued at $10k? What is the appropriate long term value as measured in dollars, a currency that exponentially inflates?
> hat said, I think BTC at 9200+ is too high. I expect a retrace to the 7500-8800 range over the next month or so, and we should even out at about 7.5k for 2018.

Such a precise view of the next several months.  I wish I had your magical powers to see the future with such accuracy.

Personally I have no idea what the price will be in six months.  There is too much regulatory uncertainty to be able to do that.  But I don't have magical powers.
RemindMe! 2 months
Why are you comparing the market cap of combined cryptocurrency to country GDPs? Two very different measures, and also two very different value holding entities. Obviously the market cap of entire countries is vastly greater than the crypto market cap, that's what should be compared. Also the crypto space does not require the type of maintenance in order to exist like countries do, it essentially exists on a different plane not having to run a military or really deal with the physical world as we know it, and so GDP is very important for a country. Crypto probably has a GDP of some sort but we don't calculate it yet. 

What's the market cap and GDP of the internet itself? That's a very ethereal question, but it's probably larger than many many countries combined, if not all of them in some way, if we consider the internet to be its own entity.
I absolutely agree with everything you're saying, and the lack of adoption is frustrating. However, I do think its increasing slowly with smaller retailers increasingly accepting cryptocurrencies. 

Moreover, with BTC being a more "Store of Value" type thing, the adoption and utility argument becomes very blurred. Is there real utility in gold, why do we pay premiums are items with identical utility but have higher scarcity? 

As for price, you might absolutely be right. To be fair, paying 10k for a speculative asset is kind of ridiculous in the first place. However, there is of course real potential in betting on a paradigm shift in the world's view of value and trustless systems for transacting. 

I think we also need to start considering the ecosystem that has begun to develop around crypto's and take into account that price movements are largely done by trading algo's that take no underlying asset value into account, but only trade based on price movements. If the algo's say 9k is fine, then 9k it is.

As for market cap, we're not even half of what Apple's worth, which is one company. Admittedly it has a working product and generates revenue, but the entire crypto sphere being smaller than one company, and BTC being around 20%, I don't know if the valuation is *that* ridiculous.



So you are saying BTC at 10k is way too expensive for any rational investor to buy in, but 7.5k sideways for a year is fine and will totally happen? Jeez man. I have you tagged and every single post of yours qualifies as BS in my brain. And you are doing a PhD or something. It's sad. 

Oh, and BTC used to have adoption, before our new overloads kicked in. Now you are not supposed to use the currency, you know. Damn this is double sad, you are supporting that viewpoint and complaining about adoption. You are basically the definition of what's wrong with BTC.

Now do your best to shit on me as you did in the past. 
Mature and balanced post. I agree. I see the Absolute Top at $10600, but the weakness in the past 48hrs says we at best double/triple top at <10k. The bouncing around/accumulation pattern of the past week is just people hanging on to hope. Once that hope is BRD'ed, our collective grasp of value is likely going to reset, and the next rung on the ladder is the $1800-5000 level.

>Shorts are great, come to think of it. People are essentially selling bitcoin, but with the promise to buy back in the future. Shorts are bullish, I love shorts.

Margin longs are great, come to think of it. People are essentially buying bitcoin, but with the promise to sell back in the future. Longs are bearish.

/s 
Yes has certainly been the case since $20K.
Yes, this is technically true. You can determine a certain amount of buying pressure were the price to go down. The same is true for longs. Longs will have to sell in the future and, therefore, limits the upside potential.
Nice Entry! I'm in a similar position though I'm looking at 9.35k ,.... Looks pretty heavy there so maybe locking in some might be a good idea, though if we get past I'm thinking 9.5-9.75. Will probably lock in some profit at each point and keep tight stops. I don't know, I'm not convinced on the bullish trend and will re-evaluate at every resistance  in case things turn south.
What's with that obsession with what Gates and Buffett said about BTC? That is just two old men talking about a technology they don't understand and a market strikingly different than traditional ones. Come on guys, those people having a negative opinion about BTC is neither bullish nor bearish. Stop trying to see patterns in every random thing.
> Remember when Jamie Dimon caused the drop by saying its a fraud? That was a pretty substantial drop from just a few words and he was the first one.

Just use regular Bitmex with 1 or 2 contracts. The most you can lose in this scenario is a few bucks over the course of a month or two (unless you're really stupid and use high leverage and overtrade -- still, hard to imagine any significant losses racking up) and the prices and trading will reflect real market conditions.
Sounds like the BitMex docs would be a good place to start. 
just sayin it looked like "accumulation" all the way down until we actually went sideways for weeks. Plus if you consider $6.5-7k accumuation this could be redistribution. 

And remember that in order for the price to go up people can't just be buying the dips- they have to buy the local highs as well to push it to new heights. Doesn't matter how strong support is if no one wants to buy high
You treat it as an investment and not something you ever touch. Consider the money gone and not yours for a certain time period. 6 months, a year, two years, whatever. 

Just don't treat it as an asset you can touch unless you need emergency money or something
When people have 2 stacks they usually hedge their cold storage on dips.

Looking how futures premium evaporates I think it may be a problem to see 9.4 again before bigger drop.
Forgot:

!long XBTUSD close 9300
I should have been paying attention today or set stops last night.  June future is now underwater, evaporation of premium was brutal.  Haven't made a move yet.    Might just double down.

With the 1d Bbands that tight we will not follow this almost horizontal channel \(if you zoom out it is quite horizontal\) IMO. Not saying we go down from here, but I doubt this channel you are referring to has importance.
https://www.tradingview.com/x/4H4IS70s/

That's how I have it. The wick goes to the bottom of the green box. 
BBands will only tell you that a move is imminent. They won't necessarily give you much in the way of direction. 

RSI is a pretty reliable indicator when the market is rangebound, but not as reliable when the market is trending.


I only use BBands as an quasi-reliable indicator of maximum pain you can get from your current price level for the current candle, depending on your time frame.
I think this is most reliable:

Check back his history, so far his long term TA has been very accurate and reliable.
When things go bad, better dream of rainbow support!
That would be awesome and could very well happen although the declining volume makes it look less likely.  I think this bubble was smaller for two reasons:

1. the alt coin explosion that happened during this bubble caused a lot of people to sell btc for alts, making it smaller.  (but you could also argue that alt spending fueled the bubble more)

2. as time goes by and price goes up you would expect the later bubbles to get smaller in proportion because it takes so much more to make the price go up.
Thats a Bingo i believe. we never truly saw a popping, in the grand scheme of things this is probably a bear trap
I also jumped on this bounce.

!short XBTUSD add 9060 15% 
Just closed my 9480 short at 9020. Don't think it will go much lower than high 8s
I sold and then rebought a couple times tonight. Does that count?
Did you sell? Just curious what your sentiment is. I remember you were buying sub $7k and I'm curious 
Every investor doing DCA for example. If you are on a weekly "certain amount of USD" buying setup, you do that.
Where u short from? 7000? Less? Its okay
The greater fool
we're being squeezed between a descending resistance and a relatively flat support. There's still leftover hopium from the last few weeks coursing through the veins and people have visions of this popping up a few hundred bucks here. Could well happen. The potential downside over the next few days is far greater than the potential upside, however.  
its down 2% but it went down those 2% in a very 'unbullish' chartlike manner.  Not like other 2% days.  Which would be considered meandering noise.


For real it's getting real fucking annoying. 
just lol, because random pattern fitted into random square. 
so we just been BARTED on a bigger timeframe then?
As unpopular as it would be, a proper pullback to the mid-low 8000s by the end of the week would set a lower high on the weekly time frame, which is needed as the weekly is getting over extended. In order to reestablish our equilibrium on the weekly, a new lower high is needed for a proper bull run later this summer. 

I'm targeting a small limit buy at 9180 this morning. I'm anticipating a dead cat bounce up to ~9700 before we retest 9000 and possibly lower later in the week. 
Horizontal support seems decent at 9300. (Until it isn't).
Id be surprised if international sanctions didn’t have at least some sort of effect on the various markets to be honest
Outside of the broader socioeconomic implications of the move,  evading sanctions is a major use case for BTC: https://www.vox.com/world/2018/2/28/17055762/north-korea-sanctions-bitcoin-nuclear-weapons. 
I don't think they're linked as the energy markets already priced in the news over the last few days. Might've been some opportunism with the pump timing but probably more coincidence as the prelude was the little dip/shakeout. 

Off-topic: Trump seriously has the IQ of a shoelace.
This is very interesting because a few weeks ago, Trump gave a speech about something totally irrelevant and I noticed then we jumped up a bit too. 

Edit: Why did I get downvoted? Because I stated a fact that right after trump concluded a speech a few weeks ago we bumped up a bit? I'm not saying it means anything but it's funny it happened again. Jesus....
Yes, if that really mattered to any significant portion of the market we'd still be going up 
I'm not gonna lie. Selling into strength every time Tom Lee parrots his moon juice on CNBC has been an insanely profitable strategy thus far in 2018.
Lol thanks but no thanks. It's news like this that make me lose money. 
Whoa, 10X with your whole stack? I would like to hear your reasoning for the trade.
Aaand bitcoin successfully expanding the field of technical analysis with the introduction of the "Bart pattern". Also giving us the concept of a "big green dildo" in charting. lmfao

Edit: Sure would like an inverse Bart right now. 
I honestly have no clue what to think anymore. 

I want to open a long here, but I’m currently short from $9,400.

May just open a long to hedge against it and bail on long if we break $9,050. Wouldn’t be the worst idea 
> Does anyone think we could bart right back up?

It wouldn't surprise me. Things are acting really weird right now. You get a feel for the graph and something is really odd today. Like it's about to spring up. Can't quite put my finger on it.

This movement seems really weird.

In my opinion 6,5 -> 10k was organic like smurf ice cream, most of the sub is stil looking at it as a bull run because most of the sub cannot trade a bear market and the hodl mentality. 

Let's be serious, do you think we could have reached 10k in 5 weeks, without a major retrace, after so massive dropping, without that short squeeze and subsequent huge market buy orders? So why it is not going up? If that was organic growth people should be pretty happy to buy at 8% discount before before we salute 4 figures forever...

Back to reality, why we had someone buying big lots of BTCs till 10k at market price and now everything is silent? If someone was accumulating, did he/she already finished? Suddenly at 10K? Is he holding? Cmon...

There is nothing sustaining the price at this level in this moment other than hope and hopium. Maybe at 8.7/8.8 something will change and will see some bounce but I am not even sure at this point and, in any case, i doubt we can revisit 10k unless some other organic movement made of BGDs creates momentum. Maybe we shall paint smurf dildos.

Anyway, just my opinion, let' see how this plays.
possibly but actually everything since $8k has seemed pretty legit, nothing has been as barty 
is volume low? on BFX we've already done 21k BTC today, yesterday's total was 25k BTC

edit: also, yes I think that it is totally possible we bart right back up
It's interesting how the price now moves in smoother curves. I remember about two months back when it was nothing but tight straight channel > green or red dildo > channel > dildo etc. 
Right on mate :D
bags getting HEAVY.


I can assure you no billionaire is terrified nor should they be.  They own vast assets including land, buildings, corporations, etc.  You're completely delusional lol.  Crypto is not going to hurt them and they will be in on it if they want to. 
Don't be foolish - they have an excellent portfolio of assets that make them much better positioned for a currency collapse than most. That is not to say it would not concern them.
Not in their lifetimes.  Long time before fiat becomes meaningless or if it will ever.  If one day you see everything being priced in BTC (or any other crypto) rather than USD then you can know things are changing.  Fiat is still king.
For any alternative to work there has to be either a crisis or incentive, requiring the masses to want, need or love it. Reactionary government aside, does this describe Bitcoin/crypto? Fiat is safe for a long time... even hardcore traders only use bitcoin to accumulate fiat it seems. 
10 % swings are tough in dollar terms, easy to imagine perhaps seeing your monthly salery disappear instantly if you live in countries outside of the west. 
Time is on the side of those mentioned & their ilk... including time to alter views as well as percieved control of any transition... well, maybe not so much in the case of some of the older ones
Yes. wanted to say also... what is this all about these guys. Buffet / Gates...


They are "angry" they did not bought BTC when it was 600$???

Just like 2014, 850kBTC got stolen from MtGox and dumped slowly on the market


> Overall, it's a good thing. 

If you aren't a holder.   

> Anyone who thinks that 20K was the toppity top is fooling themselves.

What an incredible arrogant statement.  There is an significant probability that $20K is the ATH...., as is ALL TIME, and that wouldn't change.   I would say the probability of that is around 50%...not 95%, but also not 1%, as you claim.

lol we went from comparing BTC to bullshit tulips and now comparing BTC to actual gold like it's a bad thing lol. 

You're basically saying BTC has the stability and long term value like gold, but also the cutting edge technology EVERYONE involved in the tech or financial industry wants a piece of. Change that tag to bullish brother, you just made a great argument. 
Zoom out to see the bigger picture, and you'll see what an asinine comparison you just made. Gold wasn't 1 cent per ounce at any point before that bubble. It wasn't $30 a year before that bubble. Why does this matter? You can't panic Bitcoin hodlers. We're too far up, and each "crash" just makes us laugh harder.

Don't worry about it - we all make mistakes. The key thing is to know when to close your position and minimise losses. 

On the other hand, it could well drop again soon too. Don't close a position prematurely. 

I know this advice isn't particularly helpful, but you get the idea. Don't beat yourself up, but equally don't let the fast paced nature of bitcoin allow you to act irrationally. 
You are sweating very small moves that are just larger traders getting in and out.

Stop hoping.  Play the game.  Hope doesn’t do anything.  Have a plan for whatever bitcoin does.  People never learn this lesson and it is the most important thing.
Looks like sellers want to sell and buyers want to buy for a lower and lower price.
....weeks. We were hovering in the $8750 area less than 2 weeks ago
I feel I'd put my buy orders in at $8800 or slightly above but to each their own I suppose. 
While it's true that markets often confirm formation breakouts after the breakout occurs, the market already made it 70% of the way to its target before falling back down. Which is pretty uncommon.

The formation spanned $9,750 to $8,700 or so, and the target for the breakout would have been about $1,050. 

The breakout occurred at $9,250 and made it up to $9,950. So $700 give or take. 

The behavior we are seeing doesn't fit the "normal" profile of, "make small breakout, trade sideways, retreat to confirm resistance-turned-support and continue upwards."
It depends if you cut the wick at 9560 but on my chart we already touched the resistance line of the sym triangle
>I have a short entry from $9400.
>
>Would it be a bad idea to open a long for the equal amount here @ $9,165? 
>
>Open a long here from $9,165 with stops below $9,050 to hedge against my short.

Why not just close your short at $9165 and set triggers to reopen below $9050? Seems to accomplish the same thing without the additional margin requirements. 
Unless you are trying to play the futures premium, it would make more sense to just close your short.

You can set a stop to open a short below 9050, if that's what you consider to be the breaking point.
Short oil ;) 
I'm from Iran. crypto demand is increasing daily due to severe depreciation of IRR against USD, manipulated gold market and banning of owning more than 10,000 USD in cash. OTC market is hot in here. Also Iranians are tech savvy due to years of having to deal with national censorship and international sanctions therefore have natural tendency towards crypto. Government cannot really enforce ban on cryto trading. They only issue warnings.

Regarding the deal, most of Iranians are pro termination of the deal. It turned out all the economic incentives coming from the deal went to the war in Syria and increased military spending while local economy suffers. Quoting a perisan expression that explains the general sentiment of the Iranian people toward the deal: "if a pot is not cooking for me, I want it to cook dog shit". 
Actually I remember reading a couple months ago that Iran had the second highest weekly Bitcoin trade volume in the world, only behind Venezuela. The government is also considering creating their own cryptocurrency.

EDIT: Looks like the government recently banned the trade of cryptocurrency but is still on track to develop their own

You do realize that Bill Gates said the tech is great. His comments on that Bitcoin will crash have nothing to with the tech and exclusively the economics of the market
I looked trough you comment history, and I get the strong sense of your resentment to crypto, which seems to have progressed over time. I'm not trying to troll you or anything, I was just wondering if it is because you're not content with the results you have been getting, investment-vise? Wouldn't blame you though, this gets frustrating easily.

I was under the impression Binance was [somewhat] "legit" (CZ being a credible engineer and early OKC employee), but on the surface it seems they're not shy at all about goosing their volume.

WTF is this shit.... Over $500MM+ in trailing 24H volume???
The coin was added to binance. They did not make that coin. There were no deposits available when it listed so the amount of coins on binance was limits hence a nice pump and dump was born. It happens with pretty much every new coin added. At least some heavy volatility is expected. 
Volume is the only thing we can see, not the #. When people say "There's 20k BTC long" that means 20,000 worth of BTC are in a long position, that could be 10 big longs or 10,000 small longs, we don't know.

Here are the [longs](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSDLONGS/) and [shorts](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSDSHORTS/)
It's another vector for short-selling the market but volume is insubstantial compared to the broader market so the effect is also insubstantial.

It is suppressing the price temporarily, but they're about to find out that Bitcoin won't bow before them like precious metals did. The CME/CBOE has finally met its match. Watch and be amazed.

Wut?
This is the formation to watch for a downside breakdown:

https://imgur.com/a/DkO9c9B

Don't focus so much on whether $9,000 breaks down, but instead on where that price action fits into the life cycle of this wedge. 

If $9,000 broke right this second, then the market would likely have broken below the falling wedge support (which would be incredibly bearish) and shorting that break would likely be profitable.

If $9,000 breaks tomorrow instead, then the wedge support is down closer to $8,800 and you are more likely to get insta-rekt by a bounce off that support line than see any substantial gains.
Too strong in which sense?

1. The market is overreacting and it's going to bounce back soon.

2. Damn, that rejection was undeniable and clearly demonstrates the market is going to continue to decline. 

Personally, I'm in camp #2. Although I can see the argument for camp # 1.
Bullish momentum was stronger during the previous symmetrical triangle and 10K was still on sight. This time 10K was clearly rejected, buyers pressure is very low, shorts are not increasing considerably Also we did not see a single BGD since 9650 was breached on the way up the 3rd of may and i think we all agree most of the momentum was built by BGDs in this run. Looks like a different scenario to me but let's see.
its called unloading bags bro aka distribution.

> I'm concerned cuz I'm 50% stack in a shirt

Put the other 50% in a pair of shorts, and you'll have yourself a complete outfit!
The market often confirms support as resistance, but it doesn't *always* do so. 

The market could very well stay rangebound between $9,200 and $9,000 for the rest of the day before choosing a short-term direction. 

Clearly the market is not in a rush to break out. 
We need the last tree to be on steroids
Why bullish as fuck though? Previous performance should not be used to determine future gains. 

Honestly, I think we're still in a pretty massive bubble. Bitcoin is essentially digital gold that'll lose its value as soon as major players start cashing out, and has little to no real use as a currency.

Sure, it has no borders, which is great, but services like PayPal already fit that niche for 99% of people and whilst I personally dislike PayPal and many other similar currencies, I think it's ludicrous to suggest that your average person is going to start using Bitcoin for this sort of thing.

I would say, amongst my friends, Bitcoin usage definitely is up now compared to a few years ago but I reckon, if anything, they'll gradually start flaking out / moving to alts and I reckon current adoption is, realistically, about as high as it's going to get for now. 

I would absolutely love to be proven wrong - I still hold a pretty decent amount of Bitcoin and I'd love to see some mad gains on that but I really don't think it's realistic.
Which brings it on par to gold. :) 
can't say his enough, this is why we have been bouncing between 5\-10k. 
Take a look at the Oct 24-30 BBands and you'll see candles mid to upper side also. Price rose then dipped for a week before the rocket fuse started to smolder.
You are calling it a failure pretty early. It's testing it right now.
Yeah support seems good at that level. But all it needs to break is a whale to unload and at the moment that seems more likely than a whale pushing us through 9460, to me.
so much this, agree 100%
Other than the actual cloud settings I already mentioned (20,60,120,30), I change the look of my cloud, I remove the cloud outlines (can't remember the names of these lines) and the lagging span line. It just makes it look a lot cleaner.

Yeah, sounds like someone who somewhat desperately wants to find a silver lining in this dump. 
The system cureently works for him haz little interst to change it
Buffet's actually 100% correct there. Since the price itself is irrelevant to it's use as a currency, then you shouldn't care if you just care abut the technology and progression towards a realistic currency.

If you care soo much about the price, then you don't care about moving away from fiat but rather are gambling, hoping the price will keep going up so you can make more fiat.

Lot of resistance before 10.8k, after this we have 11.1/3k, then the final stage 11.7k.

If it really fails, you will have time to sell high or short high.
10K was bounced off of many times in the preceding two weeks before the initial drop to 6K. It's (relatively) strong support turned resistance. It was never actually very strong support though because it never consolidated there on the way up. However, on the way down it acted as psychological support apparently. 
This is the opposite of buy high sell low.

And I’m refering to a hodler so someone who already has btc, that doesn’t day trade.

If we go below 7.8k, sell this shit it’s going below 6k.

Now the trend is still bullish, I think we will still go above 10k, but there will be a lot of volatility and side lines. Can even go to 8.5k, 8.2k, but good luck scalping this shit.

And remember support/resistance.
Great idea! I just added it.
Yep, 10K target this week imho
Hope so, afraid of a 11.7k repeat..

You've started at 8.5, he was talking about 7.5
The issue with that scenario is that the market already broke through the support line of that formation.

It would be a bit odd for the support line of a formation to break while the former resistance line of that formation confirms as support.

Yeah, especially unchi 😊
I've learned to pretty much completely disregard horizontal resistance/support as the market moves through the $8,000 to $10,000 range. 

The market quite literally has no fucking idea what it's doing in that range.
Some of it is 100% manipulated stop hunting and other fuckery, etc.

A bear trap followed by a strong pump is something we have seen many, many times.  And of course also bull trap followed by a quick plunge.
When it comes to longer-term divergence (12h + 1d), I generally like to give the market a day or two to invalidate the divergence by dropping farther.

For the lower timeframes though, I'd be more confident in them by the early am tonight/tomorrow. But since they're lower timeframe, they aren't necessarily going to be as meaningful.

those a/descending triangles dont last long enough 

https://twitter.com/tylerwinklevoss/status/993562310567452673

Sure, I still think we're in bullish territory given the above.  ADX/DMI is a measure of strength trend, so although the (-)DMI is heading up, ADX is heading down indicating that the negative trend is not very strong. Keep in mind this entire move was not strong to begin with, though, so you have to consider that.

Right now, price is showing support at EMA100 and the Ichimoku cloud. Right below it, if this level breaks, is support where the kijun (Ichimoku MA), EMA50, and EMA200 align in addition to the EMA50 crossing up through EMA200 -- a golden cross, which is a bullish indicator. 

In short, I am going to continue to buy this.
Moon!
I'm not one to account for historical data because I'm in the camp that thinks the market players have changed so much that it's not wise to rely on it.

I will say that at this angle (the daily chart), MA crosses tend to be confirmatory, but since we've been in a serious downtrend, the "cross" could instead actually be a bounce (EMA50 bouncing off of EMA200 instead of crossing through).

Still, all of my indicators are below price except the tenkan (another Ichi MA; the conversion line. Bears are going to have a hard time blowing through all those support lines, so in this situation, I have to lean bullish.

I'll reassess at 8800 if we get there.

You know things are really bleak when people downvote Animalfactsbot

You can watch them separately.

The idea is still to post some reasoning when you enter/exit. People don't do it not only because there's a bot. Without a bot there was a lot of such posts here. We should try to encourage people to post reasoning behind a trade, not push them out from here.
!long XBTUSD close 9401
>As /u/sloppysynapses
 pointed out, 1 big win is a lot less stressful than 15 small wins and 5 small losses.

Are you sure, the grand total of 4 hours I held usd last month was quite unnerving. 
I know, but this was not my point at all, since we could have a trend that goes up 10$ per day and it would be an easy one to follow. My point was about the rational argument for focusing at a specific number.

Of course overtrading is a problem, and I agree with your point that in a choppy market with fakeouts etc it gives you more(mistaken) opportunities to do so. Which brings me to my core argument, we should LEARN from this and not just complain about some past event that might never happen again.

>I look at it and think, "man, I could have lost a fortune scalping that range."

Well, then that's is a problem you(and also I) have and we should focus how to overcome it, not hoping for a market move that makes us feel better.  Yesterday I entered a margin 5x long ETH position at 703 or so, and exited at 754. It was not the bottom or the top of that move, but since I have grown more confident in my trading skills, I did not care about catching that last % and is quite sure this market will give me many more of those entry points

That is my main point here,  instead of wishful thinking we should all embrace this market and make the best out of it. If a big reversal(for me, breaking 11.8-12k) is happening, then we adapt to it then
Basically yes, but when you actually enter that trend move and when will you exit? I think if you can catch 70% of that move then it's really great. With scalping even with loses you can hit over 100%.

It's more stressful but can be a lot more profitable.
Yeah, but so? Isn't it our job to learn to ride those waves, fakeouts, unclear trends and make the best of it and learn from it? Of course I do not mean to just blindly buy and sell,  but to wait for some kind of price level just because is not a rational strategy to me. 
yeah, so how is that relevant to trading then ? Not at all , this is a trading sub and not a holding sub. I have written several long comments here about people using BTC and still being statists, federal reserve huggers and similar but it's not the place for it

But yeah now you triggered me a bit so look at this chart and guess what happens next https://ei.marketwatch.com/Multimedia/2017/04/06/Photos/NS/MW-FJ938_fedBS1_20170406153502_NS.jpg?uuid=20d41736-1b00-11e7-b990-001cc448aede
Raging bull markets are rather the most profitable to just hold and(ok you are a bit right) enter big margin positions using a tool like andrews pitchfork imo. They are for sure easier, but does not give so many shorting opportunities for example.

Then with my focus on behaviour economics and trading psychology, I also like uncertain markets since it clears out the new kind of 20 year old traders with a HD youtube camera that think they are "traders" because they bought ripple at 2 cent. But that's more my personal opinion XD
You can say it’s on the 30 too

https://www.tradingview.com/x/eqTpTRKr/

Using smaller timeframes helps predict short term moves. You can 100% trade on the 15m time frame 
Broke down lol 
Definitely  visible on the 15/30, it may break down considering a lot of bullish formations have been breaking down.

I’ll probably be wrong, but just my opinion that we may break up here. 
Literally nothing makes sense anymore. 
Both are very possible, which is why I'm staying out for the time being. I see breakdown of horizontal support around $8900 as confirmation of distribution, but for now it just looks like a slow bleed until smart buyers come back in to accumulate further.
Yeah, I'm starting to think I should scrap it and pay more attention to the shorter-term support that looks to be emerging.  
True, or if it don't bounce high enough. The <1hr div have the bar set pretty low tho
Shorting right now (which I am) feels like playing with fire. I certainly wouldn't open now, but I added on the bounce off 8995 around 9060. Got fairly close market stops behind my new cost average. Hoping the June futures premium fades in my favor as well.
yea they do this regularly
**Woah, were livin’ on a prayer**
I'm planning to start scaling into a short here between 9300-9500 (Jun futures). Could just be the bearish bias in me raring to get out, but I'm not seeing a case for another 10K attempt here. 
He also said he would close his position at breakeven, which is around $9,400
On the other hand, BTC hasn't sustained a rally for more than 3 weeks at a time since the pop.  Also each push up (except arguably this one), we still haven't established a new local high on the weekly chart. I'm personally pretty optimistic, but I'd heavily start doubting if we break down further here.
[deleted]
And which kind of news do you think is much more likely?
[deleted]
Mr KnowAll minds over-complicate simple things for no reason.
I'm starting to think accumulation too
Yeah or an idiot. Time will tell. You have no reason to be concerned, seems that the trend is still down for now... 
Yeah Absolutely true, and we might see more downside. I'm well aware BTC doesn't give a damn about what I think.

But I'm for once trying to stick to my plan:

Fractals put my target at ~9100 USD

Support trend line at ~9050 USD

and the 0.236 fib retrace is at 9100 USD (cut off the wicks a bit to make it more conservative. 

ETH seems to be making a higher low, and LTC & BCH seems to be making a double bottom. 

Con-side:
No real sign of a reversal in BTC and it seems heavy like when we descended from 11.7k.
I hope so, I guess we'll see in a couple of hours. Still deliberating where to put my stops..
Bitmex offers 100x leverage, full of dump people.

And you don’t trade futures then same way you trade perps due to low liquidity.

I’m at work can’t post the chart, but compare june vs finex lol.

June went over spot at 11.7k and now. And it went below spot at 6k.

I think bitmex futures premium or discount are a great counter indicator. Funding fees also, Sunday it was screaming for a long squeeze.

Made a shit ton shorting it lol and got a good long entry at 9.1k this morning.
But don't forget Bitmex funding in the equation. Towards the end of the run up from 9k, funding was so high that it was better to long futures (when they were ~ neutral). You could even have a neutral delta (longing futures and shorting spot,) and collect the fees. Maybe there has been over-reaction in both directions though, an influencer probably raised awareness on futures.
>If this continues to decline, this will solidify for me that Bitmex futures traders are — as a group — some of the dumbest people on the planet.

Bitmex is  a zero sum game. Every penny lost is a penny won by someone else, and vice versa. The thing is, a small percentage of traders take a much larger percentage of the profits. This means that the vast majority of Bitmex traders will lose money playing the game.

Also.... I believe you are a Bitmex futures traders who chose to be long with a $250 premium on June futures yesterday. Even smart traders like you will sometimes hamster themselves into paying completely unjustified premiums on longs. Your hamstering mostly consisted of sunk cost fallacy.
It's been highly profitable for me for years now. 9 times out of 10, highly leveraged traders paying a premium to be highly leveraged are wrong.
They’re stupid. Nothing but good news lately for bitcoin.  I’m hodling with loose stops.  I’ll bag hold a bit if necessary because I think we are oversold at this point. 
ema12 daily broke down too it was the most reliable indicator for weeks
wtf i dont even understand your chart.. wheres the bear flag?

your TA is based on a flag that hasnt formed yet and an H&S pattern that hasnt formed based on that unformed bear flag?  This is ridiculous man. 




Times change, people learn.
I remember. In all honesty, I truly believed 50k would happen.

Also, don’t forget that BitMex futures hit 50k

Also, had you compred the 2013 bubble, which went from like 200 bucks to 1000 in 6 weeks, then you’ll notice that 15 to 50 isn’t without precedent.

Also, it was a huge meme. And if you check the Dec 16/17 daily, you’ll see that I called a correction to 10k in the Jan/Feb time frame. Ill add the link

EDIT:

Second link: https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/7k4y93/comment/drcyz7j

6k seems low enough. I don’t see us going any lower to be honest.

I just don’t see it happening, it seems unlikely

I think we bottom out at 7.5k for the rest of 2018
This means we found the true price of BTC - $9350. Time to pack up, guys and gals.
this is how it was all the way down the first time 
what story are they telling you?
great points
Millennial and younger generations are pumping alts my friend. They don't appreciate no fundamentals. BTC prob appears adult and boring to them. I'm BTC maximalist because I was born a long time ago and BTC is way risky enough for me. But the kids? If it's not hyper volatile and have maverick impossible claims then it just, well, sux.


I agree, which is why I’m not shorting it either ;)
good point
tokenized equity? You participted in CrowdFunding, let’s not exaggerate here...

Used decentralized livestreaming, social media, storage?? To what avail? What was your reason to use decentralized storage over encrypted storage with high availability? Has anyone ever censored your encrypted storage provider?

Venezuelans “saved” by Crypto because they bought sub 1k. I too hve spoken to people who have been “saved” when their investments appreciated in value. Like people who bought Apple or Amazon stock in the 200s

List goes on. Anything you can currently do on/with Crypto is largely possible in a centralized service. I could swap out your blockchain for an amazon EC2 instance and you would not be able to tell the difference
I am trying to be somewhat realistic. The speculative nature will not evaporate overnight. The price will continue to be inflated for a long time, and I anticipate it will “crash” back down to some lower value and bounce back up like it has over the past 12 months at least
I agree

The tech is revolutionary. A Byzantine Fault Tolerant Consensus Mechanism that handles more than 1/3 byzantine faults. It should have gotten a Turing Award.

But other than that, I dont see much “revolution” anymore
I agree with this, but where we currently stand there are only a handfull of countries that even allow you to use Bitcoin as a currency.

Here in Switzerland, you can’t use BTC to py for things, but we have hundreds of ATMs that let you deposit BTC and withdraw cold hard cash in a short amount of time.

We need more of these ATMs, and we need more payment providers to accept BTC
This is a trading sub, I simply gave what I consider a sensible price of Bitcoin. I think 10k is too high.

I don’t have magical powers, I have an opinion

No need to shit on you.

You can tag me as you wish, I do not care. I’ve been around since 2011 and I just had expectations about the adoption of today, and we are below it.

I personally don’t understand your comment. You can call me sad, not really sure what that is supposed to achieve. You say I’m doing a PhD and somehow that fact coupled with my opinion is sad. Sure... Well said.

You don’t even know what my research areas are.

Not really sure why arguing 7.5k is a fair price, and subsequently reasoning 10k is overvalued is hard for you to understand.

I’m kinda used to people being daft in this sub. You are no exception. And in the meantime, I’ll trust my reasoning, which I find to be sensible and well-rounded. I’m both bull and bear. Bullish as fuck below 7.5k and somewhat bearish (or at least careful) above it. It’s really that simple. So far, this has served me well, but I agree that time will tell whether or not this is the right approach.

In any case, have a nice day bro. I don’t need you to like me or agree with me. But don’t call
me sad, because nothing I said is “sad” in
my eyes.
Your post is more BS that his post here. He made a point, what is yours?
I think 1.8K is a bit too low. The market cap would be tremendously low at that point. I'd say we would bottom out around $4,500. Likely not lower. We might sit there for awhile before a leg up and the journey onward though.

!long xbtusd close 9200
/u/justanotherlogin this still didn't work as it should.
Which is why he said revisit.
Low 9k as bounce from 9k counting from now on...

We're still in a bear flag which didn't manage to break up or down since yesterday.
The joke is that they have to buy back, at least. As opposed to selling and never buying back (which would be bearish)
the enemy of bitcoin isnt the short nor the long.. tis the flight to fiat.
shorts are just self-hating bulls.. fiat = out of the game.

People listen to them because they are living symbols. Humans are like that. WB+gates are as significant as some stupid number 10000.

When I or You write or tell something, it is like 9176.81.
Their comments are blatantly there to scare the PUBLIC from investing, and this is the funding we need to keep upwards momentum.

I'm sure everyone in this forum or people that actually believe in crypto will ignore it.

But it is a psychological thing to the man on the street.

These "two old men" have had their wealth pushed in to the public eye for many years, so the public will believe what they say as they have been very successful in the past.

Its not about what we choose to believe but it's what everyone else believes and these are the people that watch mainstream news.
I'm so tired of hearing about these quotes already.  
Ohh yeah, forgot about the time they banned it for the 50th time. 
Something about that clip made me feel like Bill Gates just didn't want to sound like a nerd in front of the investment gods of yesteryear.

And it definitely sounded like they all learned their cryptocurrency talking points from CNBC. 
I posted my thoughts earlier on this phase being the redistribution phase of the markup from $6600. However, maybe it’s just because I wasn’t as quick to become bullish as others, but I’ve been surprised by how slow the breakdown from $10k has been compared to dips earlier in the year. I’m sure this could change if major support breaks though.
Indeed. At this point I'd take 9400 on June futures. Probably won't even get that
Yeah, premium has dropped like a rock. I still have my sell entries (to open short) in on June for 9420, but I don't think those are likely to hit any time soon. We'll see. 
shorting so close to support is really risky. Hope it plays out for ya.

He was buying sub $8k so no. 
support at 9k, declining volume, falling wedge, could break out to the up.  I'm not gonna short it here.


http://thepatternsite.com/diamondb.html
We get it , you are short 
I think the setup is there for sure. But I can't tell the future! 
Looks like its failing, not enough buying to support it
but a $75 bump? I don't think that really matters...with bitcoin if news is going  to catalyze a move it's going to be a large one.

Otherwise you're just analyzing the movements of the market from a single player sometimes.

We could have gone from $9150 to $9250 cause a whale heard the sanctions news. Or cause he wanted to buy a bit before he took a shit for the morning. It's pointless to analyze such small moves 
not necessarily
Who says we're not still going up? I draw my from the February low, and it says we're going up. Weren't we trying to get to 9000 a week ago? 
Do you mean selling now, or do you think prices *will* rise during that conference?

Isn’t that true of pretty much every person who thinks the price of bitcoin is going up this year.  They think the price is going up but the price has dropped by more than 50%.  
doing the opposite of CNBC is pretty much a winning strategy in general when it comes to smaller caps and crypto

It’s this bear flag channel things we have been seeing 

Idk what they are, but they for sure are strange. 
agreed. Our last Bart was at 8200 and it was only a couple hundred bucks
BTC volume is about as low as it was when we were barting around in the 6-8k range.

Edit: Looks like volume is lower now than it was then
Time to let one go and decrease postition
Who's claiming they're "terrified"?

I simply posted a quote. At no point did I endorse it. Are you sure I'm 'completely delusional'?

Who's being foolish?

It's simply a scary thought for such individuals to consider.
Yeah, I'm sure they're angry that they're piss-poor and we're filthy rich because of Bitcoin...
Okay so 850,000 btc caused 2014 @ $1150. 

$1150*17 = $20000

850,000 / 17.3 = 50,000. Which he already dumped on the market and more. 2014 = 2018 confirmed 
This time its 200k btc from gox hanging over our heads and the price is 10x the price of 2014. Well, that could be a narrative (though I think it's b.s. and will be sold OTC to institutions and people who will be holding much longer than anything traders think about).
The 850k was stolen and sold over the course of years prior to 2014....
50% seems a lot more ridiculous than 1%, all time is a long time. Deflation alone would make $20k a possibility even if bitcoin only ever becomes a novelty collectable. The market cap of $420 billion is likely to be passed by the amassed  wealth of the world's richest person in the coming decades.
Cryptocurrency isn't going away as a technology.    There are two possibilities: either Bitcoin dies \(because something else, maybe a state\-sponsored coin replaces it\) or Bitcoin is worth considerably more than $20k.
> If you aren't a holder.

Unless your terminally ill or over-invested, why should it matter? My point is that long term looks more bullish than ever, especially with regard to viability of LN.

>What an incredible arrogant statement. There is an significant probability that $20K is the ATH...., as is ALL TIME, and that wouldn't change. I would say the probability of that is around 50%...not 95%, but also not 1%, as you claim.

Why is the probability 50%? The market cap was minuscule compared to that of gold or a number of other cases that Bitcoin solves for (plus additional value add). Bitcoin is harder money than gold or just about anything else. If LN proves to be successful (which again, things look very good so far) then Bitcoin will eclipse many asset classes that don't offer the full suite of money properties. 

What seems incredibly arrogant is that you think there's a 50% chance you called the top 9 years into existence when development is just really starting to ramp up and mainstream has only barely begun to take notice.

Sounds like you're relatively new to the space.

You''re probably new to crypto, but -$1000 or +$1000 in 24 hours, even 6 hours, has happened and isn't rare. I probably should stop assumign everyone on /r/bitcoinmarkets is a long-tiem pro-trader like im.
Doesn't look like it, we are only $100 away from dropping below $9k! Doesn't look good for bulls!

> limit orders are free

currently gdax/eur is a ghost town with annoying bots (I barely detect any human behavior); it is very difficult to sell things via limit orders (if one wants to day trade), you mostly need to do a market order due to bot austerity (and coinbase increased their fees to 0.3% which is ridiculous)

> GDAX is better if you never trade more than 5BTC/EUR

tfw when you are a GDAX/EUR whale ;)
this is fairly optimistic
Yes sir/ma'am!  We are closer to that than I remembered.  I thought our recent trend had placed us will outside.  Thanks!
I can't believe how close he was. Looks like we're due for a big rise.

Oh man I've been waiting for the StrongHandDan vs. NostrilBob throwdown for weeks now...

Never compared anything to tulips. I'm a long-term and short-term bull but medium-term bear. I'll be bullish if we break 11.7k or see capitulation somewhere sub-6k...until then, I'm Bearish.
You know Gold is currently trading for much higher than that chart I pictured, right? Not a negative comparison. And you know crypto moves at lightning speed compared to other markets, right? Gold was $20 100 years ago, I'm sure it was $1 at one point. I'm not sure what you're getting at, this wasn't a negative post.

Holders don't have anything to worry about, longterm
Just to be clear, I've had that exact argument since I first heard about bitcoin *5 years* ago.

The only reason the price can keep going up in the long term is because coins are lost. However, in the process, liquidity falls.
Pretty sure Bill Gates will go down as the guy who did some sketchy ass shit in the 90s.
Actually! Mr. Gates is notoriously famous for saying funny things...

1981: “No one will need more than 637KB of memory for a personal computer. 640KB ought to be enough for anybody.” — Bill Gates, co-founder and chairman of Microsoft.

1989: “We will never make a 32-bit operating system.” — Bill Gates, co-founder and chairman of Microsoft

A real entertainer!!! :)
Yeah, I'm sure they have trouble sleeping at night wondering what it would be like if they only got in early and became rich...
Its a copy, but i found it funny to share. And i don't care about the downvotes. Kids like to downvote in this sub :)
> Don't worry about it - we all make mistakes. The key thing is to know when to close your position and minimise losses.

Well, adding to the short wasn't a mistake (imo), but I probably should have closed it about 0.5% into that bounce.  However, the odds of it being that strong were low.   

Obviously the lower the price gets, the higher chance of a sharp bounce upwards.  I didn't think $9000 would be so strong after $9100 broke though.  Oh well, will keep plugging away.
Yes there is more and more manipulation and this market becomes increasingly difficult to daytrade profitably.  I can still manage somehow,but who knows how long that will continue.  If Wall Street moves in much more, it is probably game over.
That's a boring straw man, but I knew that would trigger some people to bring up tether pumps.
what makes you so sure? its crypto so anything can happen but I think we just had a big correction and the bulk of it is over wit. RSI looking reset. 
even tho it was tested so many times this far and still holding up? 
Lets hope he could close with little loss.
Because I don't believe in TA.
What the fuck are you on about? It's a turn of phrase. I'm currently in a short so I want to it fall for my trade.

Overall I want it to rise obviously 
Sellers will run out of coins before buyers run out of fiat.
Yeah, I was waiting for a dip then too.
we were knocking on 10k 2 days ago!

Yeah, was hoping to catch a wick.  Going to move it up to $9050 today.  Seems we may never see sub-9k BTC again.
Ah I see, thank you.   Time to leave this formation behind then as fully played out.
Yeah there's a few ways to draw this.   In any case it says you can hold on with the skin of your teeth, but get ready to bail out, and opening a position here is sketchy.
While open a long at same time? 

I want to open a long Incase this truly is the local bottom and the 1day BBAnds pop off / wedge breaks up. Don’t want to miss the ride, yet if the shit hits the fan, don’t want to have my short entry closes from 9400
Only reason I'd suggest him not doing this is in case we dump or pump. You can market close positions during heavy server load but not open them

e: do stop buys/sells (fresh position, not stop close orders) 100% trigger during heavy engine load? I'm actually curious if anyone's stops haven't been triggered due to this 
thanks for the hot tip ;)
wuts the point of shorting oil if everyone is going to do it? How do you close your position?

ok so in your opinion the article about the Fed saying bitcoin futures tamed the market is FUD?  And comparisons to what futures did to  Gold are unwarranted?  
Lol im referring to how often Bitcoin corrects.  I started last May, and went through two corrections until this one.  Was so confident when it was at 12k that it was over and then there was no way back below 10k.  And i didn't think it would take this long to get back to ATH's.  This correction has totally changed my perception 
thats what I'm hoping for.  this ride has already been so awesome just need to get back to ATH's so i can process all the FUD that's gone on the last 4 months
A troll
guy is a troll, dunno how he hasn't been banned yet lol 
Technical signs, but mostly my own analysis of prevalent sentiment. I read the last 5 comments of 5 different chats/forums and that's how I usually decide what my next trade will be. It's sometimes accurate, sometimes it is less accurate.
Guy says some real silly stuff to justify bitcoin going up. I don't think he can imagine a world where bitcoin isn't $100k by EOY. I actually think he said he's 100% sure we'll see an ATH soon 
Dair ain't no profits ta take, Jethro.  We done been flat. Uzhully duh Aizhuns buy wen dey ain't sellin' becuz maf an stuff. 

Dats wut.
im wondering why everyone on here draws charts, i mean if you've been doing TA for a while its pretty obvious where the formations are.. is this just to educate the masses?  Or do you actually sit around drawing lines to figure out your own positions?

I only ask chewy because he uses the same ranges i do





I feel a bit uncomfortable opening a short right now, I will wait on the sidelines and see. Hopefully the next 12 hours give a bit more clarity on where we are going; kind of feels like a coinflip right now. 
What's so special about 10k expect being a psychological number?
9.2 was clearly support and resistance both ways in this run, didn't fall fast on the way down, don't think it can fall fast on way up.

Nice point to watch.
Do you honestly think that PayPal is fitting that niche for 99% of the global population? 80% of the world is estimated to be unbanked or underbanked. 
[This FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Help:FAQ) has answers to some of your questions. Hope it can be of use to you.
broken
Either way. He should probably wait for confirmation of a break of that support line before entering a short. And even then, the one time it was broken it was bought up relentlessly.

Edit. Corrected Support/Resistance
What are you talking about?
That's a good indicator to remember for the next time. Only next time, it's all somehow different again, as always :) 
I saw March futures hit 24k+ but with 0 liquidity. I think the spread was almost 200 bucks

>his own networth is about 4 mil and Serena's networth is 170 million. 

Everything I'm reading puts his NW at $9mm+, based on docs revealed when he got married. Not sure why you think he lost more than half during the following 18 months. 
I think 14k is the Steel Royal Oak, but some of the more classic ones can go for cheaper, I think. As soon as you’ve got precious metals, it’s above 30k

The ladies' watches are much nicer than the gents'.
well done! beautiful
agreed
I'd advise of getting an education before spending your money on one of these watches.
That uhh, actually never happened. We bounced down off 17k, 13k and 12k in the period before 6k bottom. 10k is mostly psychological support/resistance rather than technical.
I think a hodler letting the market determine when they sell completely defeats the purpose of the hodling concept.

Hodlers win out because they don't let market makers impact them. There are many other strategies  to trade that are not reactive to price action. 
Gheeee. You talk about 11.7K already... When we are there or close... it's all different!!

Worth it 
Sort of like paying 0.134 BTC for a year of VPN back in 2015.

I'm in the camp that the BGC shouldn't really be considered in TA since
Sorry, I meant the green downtrend line / top of the pennant before our break up to 10K. 

Purple is a 10-month log line I've left on my chart for no particularly good reason. Sorry.

In speaking about the general large flag / consolidation point in general, not the little flag 

Today’s flag breakdown: 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/qW7rYqkG/

So we are looking at generally same thing, besides the fact it broke down 
There have been 0 reliable support or resistance zones between $8,000 and $10,000.

The market has flopped around like Goldeen every time it's been trading in that range.
Yeah, 9k is more like psychological support. Breaking it down may bounce off 8.9 just to stop bouncing below 9.2 to test real 8.8 support. Or it may go through 9k to 8.8 directly.
arigato mr roboto
4 of the following 5 are "real" TA patterns and 1 is fake. Can you spot the fake? 

* Bullish Hammer
* Shooting Star Doji 
* Spinning Top
* Hanging Man
* Shaved Bottom

...

Just kidding, they're all "real." 

And people wonder why nobody takes TA seriously.


Well, there were a lot of bounces on either side of 9.2 so I'm still keeping my eye on this one, but you're right, should've flipped at 10k and go short until 10.2 breaks.
yeah it's disorderly and could lead to a huge move up or down. not great for traders.  great for believers.  We have no guidewires here.


I know, I'm talking about slow bleed to 9.2 followed by fairly hard bounce from it. I expected it'll bleed back to 9k or at least 9.1, not bounce from 9.2
Ahhhh ok. So you're just accumulating interest in the hopes that the funding moves your way in the net? I agree, it may be time to close it. I don't think we will go below 7k for a while, but I'm sure the bears will come out of hibernation soon and call for sub 5k soon enough.
You're gonna let us know what were entry and exit points?
what do you consider a major drop? is it % wise or to a specific number?

That’s fair enough, but a lot of posts don’t have reasoning or explanations. 

This is a discussion not an archive of one’s trades. 
Avoiding chop isn't a "problem" necessarily though. It's a pretty fundamental strategy employed by many successful traders. But that doesn't mean it's the best option.

Some traders embrace the chop and specialize in scalping the up and downs. It's quite literally all they do. Someone scalping might make dozens of trades a day. Bots make hundreds or even thousands. 

Somebody swing trading would be employing similar methodology, only on a bit longer timeframes: holding for a day or maybe a week, but still moving up and down with the market. 

Then of course there are trend traders who might only make a handful of trades a year. They're looking for signs of a trend reversal, opening a position, and letting it sit for months on end before they take profit. 

Each of these strategies has merit, but it can be incredibly difficult to switch between them. Because as I'm sure you realize, the strategies associated with each are completely different and run counter to one another. 

For me, swing trading has proven to be the most profitable approach. 
You can also very easily lose over 100% and in a strong trend scalpers get screwed.
Jeez, get a grip dude. You asked why it mattered if we see ATH or not. Most of us own a hodling stack, that's why. If you're trading longer time-frames, a new ATH or not is extremely relevant.
>  this is a trading sub and not a holding sub.

That is your first mistake.  It is a cheerleader circlejerk holding sub, more than anything else, at least during bull markets.  Right now, the holders are being quieter than usual, which is the only good thing about the bear market (well, besides profits from shorting).
>  I also like uncertain markets since it clears out the new kind of 20 year old traders w

Why would you want them cleared out, as the competition?  
Lol right when I was starting to get that bullish itch. 
it was silly from a r/r perspective but I added a bit here too. I added at $9400 though. I'm very sad I closed my June short at $10075 but to be fair it went to like $10.3k after that so it would've been hard to hold 
Whoa, mind that bear
!short XBTUSD 9240 5X 10%
Bail above 9750 i assume? I’m short 9400 and will bail above 9550 
you say that now but in 2 days people will be mooncalling again

After I close this position, profitable or not, think I should stay out for a little bit!  (in the past I have not succeeded to stay out)
If you include premium on futures then he has more room. Don't think premium will go back above $200 on next $200 pump.

I've opened mine at 9580 on mex when spot was at 9385.
Sure, I'm just saying that Bitcoin won't stay still or range for long at these prices, imo. I guess what I mean is that *price discovery* is happening and the actual value of Bitcoin cannot exist in this range. It's either more valuable or it's less.
It doesn't need to do anything.  BUT the reality is that, for the first time in history, people all over the world have access to an asset that is all theirs.  They don't need a bank, broker, or government to babysit it for them.  They can exchange it easily.  Its supply is a known quantity that can never be questioned (very much unlike traditional instruments with 17 layers of derivatives piled on top, leading to situations like too many shares being claimed such as happened with Dole not long ago, culminating inevitably in meltdowns like 2008).  

Anyone can buy it easily. In any country. It's better than traditional financial instruments in many, many ways, and its supply is very limited.  You do the math. I did, and it seems just a matter of time to me unless someone can figure out how to stanch demand globally.  People who hate banks alone probably represent enough demand to keep it from crashing much.  People who need to transfer large amounts of money securely, quickly, and cheaply are the ones who are going to send it to the moon eventually, though.
i meant events not news. hopefully good. examples of game-changing events:

* Satoshi makes a move
* Paypal or amazon getting in
* Central bank buying BTC, others follow
Thanks, it can be frustrating having conversations with people who are dramatically lower intelligence.  And they are everywhere on the Internet.  Cheap cell phones democratized public speech just a bit too much.

And yes, this sounds very arrogant and I realize it is rude to say it, but does not make it any less true.

But just be glad that we trade against these people.  I wouldn't want it to be a legion of geniuses out there on the other side of trades.
I was long because I was expecting the market to continue pushing upward and for the premium to continue to inflate as price continued to climb. 

The premium was higher than it's been, but still lower than it *should* have been — assuming the short-term direction was up. 

Also, I exited my long shortly after we had our sunk-cost fallacy discussion and entered a short. 

I still capitalized on the inflated premium in both directions, long and short. 
Well he was holding it from before...
Yes, stupid is the word, especially since we have a few months worth of data showing that dumping doesn't really have much effect beyond costing the dumper lots of money.
It's not really the formation itself that matters, just saying I believe we're going to confirm with a daily higher low or invalidate with a higher high.  The H&S formation is just the bearish reversal higher low pattern.

I should also correct my first comment... daily higher high would invalidate the weekly higher low being set quite yet.
I was just joking, it’s not a big deal, we all got a little carried away last year. But don’t pretend you predicted the crash, even if you anticipated the correction, I remember you changing your mind about 10 times a day back then so it doesn’t count for much.
Bitmex futures hit 50k? I wasnt "active" at that time, do you have a chart for the futures at that time? 
The problem is if this breaks down to under 8.5k, the bagholders above 9k will all get liquidated or just start dumping.

The funds that got in under 7k may dump some just to cover any possible downside and have something to show to their investors. Especially cause this is still an *incredibly* speculative asset class.
I don't see why 6k 'has to hold' the people who bought the last dip at 6k are just whales, imho.  If something else gets 'hot' in china, and the govt is creating markets there now, like the SDR market, the shanghai index, margin buying gold, macau gambling, real estate.. I've seen the fad cycles there.

Also during a big drop - if lehman brothers can go under why not BITCORNEX run by 2 guys in their garage.





So you think we are going down to pound town? 
The one you're seeing now :)
Fair enough. Best to just keep an eye on it and trade the trend.
that’s the use case, and it is happening all over the world right now. a hedge/diversification tool against inflation of national currency. 
there's that famous AAntonop quote (about whitepapers) - ' if you can replace every instance of the word blockchain with database — and it'll still read the same. It's business as usual'
This response is full of silly assumptions. (unless you proceed to edit)

i.e. 
>you participted in CrowdFunding, let’s not exaggerate here...

>Venezuelans “saved” by Crypto because they bought sub 1k.

Not worth engaging children.
Because bitcoin is divisible by so many times (8?) then what exactly makes a “fair” price? Is that like saying 1 dollar is worth 1 dollar because it’s a fair price?

You can’t say, oh 1 bitcoin is worth 8000usd to me but I wouldn’t pay 8400, that’s too expensive.

You can make statements like that about a car or a piece of hand crafted furniture, but bitcoins relative price to usd is completely irrelevant is it not? Unless I’ve missed your point here?
also, why should companies use a public ledge and not just switch to a private system? Like XRP or IOTA, the tech can be used leaving the public out of it, no one needs regular people. 
 
We'll see where this goes.
Spending doesn't matter for price nearly as much as holding does. Store of value is what provides persistent long term demand, unlike transactional demand which is short lived. It doesn't matter if your vendor accepts bitcoin or not, it matters if they keep the payment money as bitcoin while it's not in a transaction. 

Bitcoin *does* need to be very liquid to be valuable, and yeah, in some ways it's much less liquid than fiat, less accepted or even recognized. But in a way it's already more worldwide than any fiat, it's native to the borderless internet. And the really big advantage of it is that you can take digital delivery of it without a 3rd party custodian, and that's a sort of liquidity unavailable in fiat.
> and we are below it.

And 1MB4EVER has nothing to do with it, correct?

> You don’t even know what my research areas are.

You talked about them being crypto related, or to at least know where the real research is made in the crypto scene. That should qualify you as competent in this topic. And yet, here we are.

> Not really sure why arguing 7.5k is a fair price, and subsequently reasoning 10k is overvalued is hard for you to understand.

I don't want to answer to this, I just want to quote it to make sure it's read again. Hopefully people see it for the nonsense it is. Otherwise, I can't help.

Try adding to your short with a ! short command instead of a ! long no? :D
>The joke is that they have to buy back, at least. As opposed to selling and never buying back (which would be bearish)

Yep, and margin longs have to sell, as opposed to just buying and holding. I got the joke. 
the phrase 'rat poison' was the sell signal.  It's not all in the charts, boys.  People worship gods.  Like it or not.  It's funny you think your opinion matters.  You can have your ego, or you can make money in the market.   A lot of proud broke people out there.




Follow BTC and (I'm sure) any asset long enough and you'll notice that news tends to follow price the majority of the time(because it's priced in). It's no conspiracy to keep the price of BTC down just people who know how to take advantage of events that the general public will view as havng an effect on bitcoin. There are exceptions with news but 99% of the time it's following the price for one reason or another.
That's hard to say. Didn't expect another bounce above 9.2 after this drop, and it seems to be holding still. Went short at 9385 but now I'd say it's more of a coin toss if I had to choose further direction.
i mean, its just pure gambling for me at this point but the "bet" was that the support wouldnt hold
Yes but is the most similar to the Rainbow chart above.
>  I don't trade and really want to hold long term. 

You do trade.  You just said you did.  But I get wanting to hold, but not wanting to lose all your money.  That is the smartest way "hold"...to sell and buy back lower..which is trading.
I'm glad you made some profit. You're still in a good position. Nothing wrong with taking some profits off the table, but keep in mind you're beginning  to trade. It will suck you in and if you take a loss you will want to try to win it back. if you really want to hodl you should hodl. Or give yourself long term targets and don't enter and exit more than once every, say, two weeks.

Selling at $9.3k to buy at $8.6k is pretty short term time frame trading. It's almost not even swing trading, it's more of day trading. Just be careful and have a plan 
it could very well. All I'm saying is it won't go very far if it does. Otoh, if we go down, it could get pretty gnarly.
Yes, but the picture you provided violates candles. You just went through all candles on the left side. 
That is not the point here, it is just obvious that the pattern violates lines... 
also, whether or not a $75 bump *matters* is your opinion, and you should do you. I'm more interested in objective cause and effect of geopolitical events
the flaw in your logic is that you are assuming that the price would have been around the same number without the news. for all you know, we could have been below $9,000 without the news. 
So what's your take on us going  from $9244 to $9218? these are pretty small movements it doesn't mean much 

If we blast past $10k today I'd say sure yeah it's very possibly a factor 
Talking about a 1h time frame right now. If he's looking into $100 movements then he's looking into small time frames. if we go up past $10k I'd say it's not necessarily  coincidence 
if we dont go up 25% a week we're in a bear market

[deleted]
TA textbooks need revising. 
The only “ Obvious “ move was a short from $9950 on our second failed attempt at 10k

Otherwise, it’s been like drinking a bottle of Jameson to the face will throwing darts trying to hit a bullseye 
Closed my underwater long for a small loss and opened a short at $9400 ish, which wound up being a good move. 

Now.... do I close for a profit to make up for the losses + some profits on my long? Do i close my short and open a long? I really have no clue what to do here. 
right but don't we need to take into consideration that BTC is worth ~40% more than it was at $6,XXX?

edit: number
It's a really dumb quote.
Oh ok well if you don't endorse it then we can agree it's not an accurate sentiment.  I'm unsure why you would post something you know to be untrue, however. 
What percentage of their assets do you think are kept in cash?  They primarily own things.  They're not just collecting cash from one country and locking it away.  They diversify into the obvious ones like real estate, stock, and property, but also less obvious ones like fine art or rare automobiles.  They will use cash for its liquidity only really, primarily they do not want to keep their wealth tied up in cash just sitting in a bank doing nothing. 
I'm saying it is not a scary thought, because they have not been accumulating fiat but wealth.
Right!!!
math perfect, but timing needs some gymnastics to adjust.
break this down a bit more for me. are you onto something or is it sarcasm?

What would be the equivalent of mtgox insolvency? Finex+gdax+stamp+bitrex+binance+ fewothersmallexchanges go bankrupt?
a state-sponsored coin can get to work spreading adoption for a decade if it wants to be bitcoin.

Of course it wouldn't go away unless there was a nuclear war or similar disaster and the internet disappeared.  And yes state sponsored coins are probably the way it will go, because they will make all the other ones illegal, or close to that.
> why should it matter?

It matters to some people to lose 80 or 90% of their money on an investment.  It matters to me if I lose 5% or more.

> Why is the probability 50%? 

I say 50%, mainly because of gov't regulation.  It's already been made effectively illegal for 3 or 4 billion people to buy BTC.   As that number keeps going up, the price will likely keep going down.   It is probably lower than 50%, but the price can be manipulated and pumped easily, so it's possible that could happen sometime in the next 100 years.

And even if it isn't technically illegal and you have submit DNA sample (Or nearly that) to buy cryptocurrency, then it has effectively changed the value proposition and utility of the currency, making it less valuable to people and the market price will reflect that.

You say 1% it never makes it to $20K again.  I say 50% (and I'm being generous).  We will agree to disagree. 
1% is extraordinary.  50% is not.  If you think 50% means you have no idea, then there is no hope for you.
Expecting 2014 to repeat itself "just because" is a meme.

Also, most people either trade short-term because they admit they can't predict the long-term or trade long-term because they know they can't predict the short-term random noise. You're arrogant enough to claim to know both.

yeah, I hve no idea why so few people trade GDAX/EUR. I agree that daytrading is basically impossible. I used to market make that book back in Nov/Dec and switched it off shortly thereafter
Agreed, however I wanted to kind of keep track based on how accurate it was regarding 2017.
His [most recent chart](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/ETsf4M8H-Midterm-picture-looks-bearish/) is more bearish.
*Yawn*. If DushmanKush isn't here to curate God-awful copypasta and insert non-sequiturs and ad-homs at every turn it's just boring drivel.
Gold is trading 3x that chart which is a shit return over 36 years. Bitcoin will hit a lower low, sure. Lower than 15K for sure.
> The only reason the price can keep going up in the long term is because coins are lost. However, in the process, liquidity falls.

How does that work?

Also, how does that relate to what Mr. Gates is saying?
until people actually start using it, right?
Such as what?
no, they have a Problem because the billions of Fiat Money they accumulated over their lifetimes are beiing threatend. if one of those would hold 50.000 btc from early on, you Think they would talk the same way? no, they seek for VC types of Investment and now they think they are late to the party and not the first to invest.

They never said they were sure that it would or wouldn’t. They were just saying the possibility is *not* off the table. Like you said: It’s crypto, so anything can happen. 
We just bounced a little dude. We only tested 10k once. We could still bounce off a lower high and retest 8.8k.
keep wanting.  That will make things happen.  Good luck.
That's cute. Long term BTC's price does go up but to think that loads of coin can't be sold pushing the price down is pure hopium.
I really hope your being sarcastic. The chance we will see sub 9K again is VERY high.

>I want to open a long Incase this truly is the local bottom and the 1day BBAnds pop off / wedge breaks up. Don’t want to miss the ride, yet if the shit hits the fan, don’t want to have my short entry closes from 9400

Opening a long against your short for the same amount accomplishes the same as closing your short without the benefits of margin reduction etc. If the price moves up, you earn nothing until you close the short. It the price drops, you earn nothing until you close the long. 
>Only reason I'd suggest him not doing this is in case we dump or pump. You can market close positions during heavy server load but not open them

Price is currently $9130. If you set a stop limit sell order on Bitmex with a stop price of $9000 and limit price of <$8500, for example,  this will accomplish the same as a market sell. 
Most are long oil, net longs have never been as high. Just as the majority was short the dollar. The crowds can be wrong you know. You close your position like every other position lol. 

You can open a brokerage account and it's very likely you can long/short oil with leverage. Google it
Actually we can use some of that american freedom, inside everything is ready to erupt. A little push from the outside will set fire to this mess. Believe me, we'd love this government gone and are ready to pay the price for it.

Internet explorer absolutely dominated the market when it was first introduced in the 90s and had a 95% market share at it's peak. 

It ultimately lost the browser battle, but it was far from a failure in the late 90s and early 2000s. 
Go be a dick somewhere else.
No, what was implied by your comment was by cherry picking narrative. That was incorrect
I'm only interested in the price of all my investments, whether it be stock, property, or bitcoin.  What is your point?  It won't go up in value because people care about the price?
ok. if you fail to deliver your bytecoin on time, you pay 100% penalty. deal?
I'm saying that volume as it currently stands does not paint this picture per se. I do think that additional futures markets add liquidity to the asset and the very existence of this short-selling vector allows for some "taming," whatever exactly was meant by that. 
>"There are no free rides. There's no easy path to riches, though despair can seemingly be found quite easily. Bitcoin is no exception: it is not for the feint of heart, the weak willed.

It's one thing to make ridiculous calls, it's another to invent metrics to support it. Lame.


I post charts to get feedback from the community here. It's always helpful to see what other people are drawing, and what other people think about formations I'm watching.

The second ascending channel I drew is a perfect example of this. I hadn't even started watching that channel until I saw other people posting it this morning.

I definitely have a strong desire to help others within this community, but I'm not a saint. If I wasn't getting anything out of this community myself, I'd most certainly be operating in a vacuum and not sharing any of this with anybody.
I just noticed that you're actually asking if I draw formations at all without sharing them. And I absolutely do.

I'm constantly drawing lines on charts to decide what to do next and when.
Yup, we're right in the middle.

On the other hand formation isn't big so it's possible to set tight stops.
Nothing. 

I'm actually very surprised buyers overcame resistance at $9,800 but still managed to drop the ball on the 1-yard-line at $10,000.
On top of PayPal is horrendous for international transfers and for people living abroad. All the proof of residence and having a phone number in your home country is just awful on expats.
Right, but what makes you think those unbanked people are going to start using Bitcoin?
I have used and do use Bitcoin, but I just don't think the mass appeal is there. I really don't think the majority of people are ever going to use it. I hope I'm wrong.
Support line.

He should wait for a bounce to 9.4 on a short, cause 9.3 is lower part of bear flag and he'll have to wait for 9.5 to break to bail on it. That's poor r/r.
Damn...I miss the days when volatility was insane. I remember seeing a spread of $200 on GDAX a few times during those violent dump days. wish I could just watch a video of it

I agree, but the green candle went up, then it dropped to about 7.5 before steady climb up from there, so 7.5 is the lowest point you can start from.
I see, but that's not really a proper bear flag isn't it? As it's not sloping up. What I see here is a small bear flag that broke down but the lower support was stronger. I guess it's a matter of perspective. I do agree that the bearflag we just broke down of was pretty long!

Well... If people go with a formation that has 50% rate of success when is drawn correctly then hard to take it seriously.

If you stick to at least 70%+ rate then you're good.

Had a conversation about it today. Doesn't really matter if you trade by TA or gut or coin flip. It's like you said, you need to know when cut your losers and winners will give you enough profit.
The dip cost me a ton of interest. I added on this run up and it just barely paid me out even on the interest.

I don't wanna sit in a shitty short paying out interest again cause if it dips, again, the interest at the bottom will probably cost me 15-20% of my position.
I said I'd say the size as well once it got under a certain point. Until then I'm not sharing.
and they will 48 hrs from now

Remeber what happened when they dared Dimon to short it? Guess we're going back to 6k :|
What do you know about pigs?
Same, haha!
I agree, I'm just pointing out that bot didn't change anything besides how the post is shown. Earlier it was only like 'I'm going long here!!!'.
I'd like to hear from scalpers if they really make money with all the bots out there now.

I totally agree with this, and I know you are popular as an entry picker around here but I always advise people to not follow your trades since they do not know your style or brain :P Everyone needs to have their own style

My main point was, is there any rational trading argument in focusing on price X, instead of like you describe deploy your preferred strategy in the current market without have a sort of arbitrary target 
Hard to lose over 100 :-P

I'm not talking about trading every way or against trend. Even on this bull run to 20k we had a lot of moments where you could just sell high and rebuy low. You didn't have to short to catch over 100% of the move up.
It's interesting how many holders don't consider their cold storage holdings to be a long position.
I have a very good grip thank you. If you have this holding stack, why would the price then at all matter since I assume the end goal is to pay with BTC/crypto for everything
you are probably more right that i want to admit yes
No more because it's is extremely easy to make money in the biggest bull markets ever, but quite hard to do in a slow sideways or bleeding bear market. The ones who survives will be the one to follow in the future
That's actually a perfect time to act on the bullish itch, in my experience, when you're thinking, "It's gonna go up," then it goes down a bit.
!short XBTUSD add 9270 15%
If we're talking June futures the whole time, then probably over 9600. Depends a little what happens to the premium. Assuming a $100 premium holds, I'll probably be looking 9650ish to bail. 
I've been out for the most part since my longs stopped out overnight Sunday. I opened a long yesterday briefly, but closed it at break-even. I haven't been particularly itching to re-enter, but after I ignored the feeling that I should short 10400 on Sept futures, I'm not ignoring it this time. I'm not sure why we'd run up to 10K again after this drop. I'm targeting 8800, and would probably set profit stops  at 9220 if we break under 9K. 

At least my bot is working again. 
> Paypal or amazon getting in

Really?  You are still fantasizing about that...it's not 2013 any longer..let it go.

> Central bank buying BTC, others follow

Even better.

What about Jesus coming back and endorsing BTC and "God" making all the other cryptos disappear.
This is borderline /r/IAmVerySmart material.
borderline brainfart hemorrhage with liquidpoop diarrhea. 
closing that long was a pretty easy move.. entering the short right after is something i usually fail at.


Well any premium is worth paying if you expect the price to go up. You just be pretty effing confident because that premium really really hurts risk vs reward.

When we talked, you weren't surprised at the premium, I was shocked by it. I don't understand what about going to $10k and getting hard rejected at $10k is bullish, but that's literally all that happened to cause the premium to spike. 

When whales notice that premium spiking like that for no good reason, it's very easy for them to capture that 4% guaranteed profit by shorting the fuck out of futures and longing on bitfinex spot or somewhere else, regardless of what they expect the price to do. 4% profit is no joke. 

Low premiums, price pumps and dumps down to same level, then high premiums SCREAMS bitmex traders got trapped in longs.
That is the sunk cost fallacy. 

It is 100&#37; irrelevant if he was holding it from $100, $20000, $8800, or if he had just opened it. He made the same decision by holding it, period.
Im not saying I predicted the crash. Im saying I wrote the comments on Dec 17. That’s all I’m saying. I added the links

I still change my mind 10 times a day
Sadly I don’t. BitMex December futures hit 50k when the SW2x call-off squeezed a massive amount of shorts and there was no liquidity to stop the rise
you should short it to 0 man.. then withdraw your 1,000,000 BTC worth 0$ each.  Would be an epic play.

But the same could be said for the last dump to 6k+. We dropped from a 11.8k double top (meaning two tops that people FOMOd into) and dumped even faster than we did the first time we went to 6k with literally NO bounces along the way to speak of. The first drop to 6k had some pretty impressive bounces, i.e. 7.8k to 9.23k and 6.6k to 7.5k, and in spite of all the we still didn't get to 6k
Not necessarily, just think we tried $10k too fast. The market should've pulled back lower after $9.6k originally. overextension leaves buyers exhausted and dejected when they fail to break an important resistance level. A strong bounce from low $8s/high $7s would have been more bullish.. But now it's possible we don't bounce back. 

Either way, I would be wary holding a long from above $9.3k here. A break below $8.6k and there's a good case for a continuation of the bear market 
What was the thought process behind your analysis? I don't really know how to use EMA. Do you use the 9 days average?
cool story
I determine “fair” based on

1. The cost of production (mining)

2. Supply/Demand (market price)

3. Utility (e.g. I pay a credit card fee because I find them useful)

Cost of production is about 5k+, price is 9350 and utility of Bitcoin allows me to determine where on that spectrum from 5k-9350 I place my “fair” price. Note thay if the market price is below the production costs, I believe you are basically receiving free money.

I can do a lot of cool stuff with Crypto, like trade futures, bet on sports games, buy my lunch, etc. I attribute additional premium for the fact that it is censorship resistant, so I would argue that anything sub 8800 is where I would consider buying for holding short-term, i.e. to take with me as collateral. Anything sub 8200 is probably a good investment long term

Anything sub 7.5k is a great deal

Anything sub 5k is free money.

That’s my rationale. Im not saying I’ve got the secret sauce. I’m just saying this is how I try to value Bitcoin.

When we pumped to 20k, I really though a paradigm shift was coming and the Crypto Revolution is underway. So back them I valued Bitcoin way higher, because I thought the Utility was basically so high that the market price was justified. I was wrong, I see that now
I have no idea why any company would use one of the existing blockchains when thye can just spin up their own network, allowing people to swap in and out
And again, you have successfully said nothing
I was talking about updating my old long that we talked about. It still didn't catch this adding at 9525 properly so in database it closed with 9025 entry instead of 9190.
There goes that.

yeah it could.. I definitely wouldnt long here, haha. the longer term charts are all pretty ugly.  Looks like the rally out of steam.

We should all be hoping for a bull run, you can make far more in bull markets than bear.  You can shear a sheep many times, but only slaughter it once.






Diamond pattern is like coin flip. Rejection rate is too high to include it until it's almost complete and then it's not worth it.
Mostly wicks... any candle chopped is simply because I drew it up in 2 seconds.... 
Uh...okay. You do realize that could entirely be noise, right? Nothing about your observations are objective- you wait for news to come out and then when the price jumps you attribute it to the news. But what about quite literally the other 10,000 times the price moves with no news...?

If you think a <1% movement is anything other than noise then you are not being objective- you're just looking for stuff to back up your already formed opinion. But you don't seem to listen to anyone else telling you you're wrong so meh
my point is that markets are far more nuanced than "if it doesn't get to 10K then no effect"

for all you know, without the news, we could be at $9,050 right now.
they have an in with BCH, roger ver's married to someone's daughter there.

sadly I was asleep when that happened. Went to bed at like 9800 thinking we could strike at 10k, but got pretty wasted and fell asleep
that was free money. only time 25x+ justified.

probs best to close short and HODL or just let the short ride with stops at BE
depends, I guess that is one explanation as to why we are not seeing as many bart patterns
That's a really 'dumb' comment :)
Untrue? 

It's debatable. False binary.

> They will use cash for its liquidity only really, primarily they do not want to keep their wealth tied up in cash just sitting in a bank doing nothing.

This is obvious & not the point.

Let's avoid strawmanning.

They're simply worse off contextually in a global, permissionless currency world - in many ways. And it's an eerie thought to consider one day having your wealth evaluated in unfamiliar, [likely relatively lesser] terms.
Their identities, their recognition etc. is tied to their Fiat dollar wealth.

They'd be worse-positioned in a transition to crypto context. Hence the 'scary thought'.

(Not to mention, Berkshire has >$90B in fiat cash reserves.)

I'd like to hear your rebuttal.




Except there are more coins to be dumped. Not that I buy into the narrative that 2014 bearishness was caused exclusively (or even primarily) by GOX. 
Sort of sarcasm- 850k btc in 2014 is more than 50k now even when accounting for price. it really depends on liquidity, which you can generally assume we have more of now. 

fiat volume increased parabolically in dec 2017 so it's unfair to use fiat volume like that. 

I personally am under the opinion that gox has not had a massive effect either way

There's 1800 coins mined per day. That's 1800 coins ready to be sold every day. The market can quite easily handle an extra 50k coins over a few weeks. 
So you have to remember, the mtgox insolvency wasn't just a single event.  When the actual shutdown happened there had been warning signs for months that something was seriously wrong.  The MtGox BTC price was gradually 20% and then as far as 60% out of sync with all other exchanges.  Then when it shut down there was a lot of confusion for months about whether the BTC and fiat funds were simply gone or whether they could be recovered or what.  And by that point, other exchanges had taken on most of the volume anyway.  It wasn't until much later that the information about willybot came out.  And the losses were suffered on both the fiat and BTC sides of the exchange.

In my opinion, it wouldn't take very much for us to go lower.  In terms of the % retrace from "bottom" as well as the duration in days from peak to bottom - if we've already hit it - this has been a very mild bear market.  However, it is highly unusual for the bottom to be reached from a steep fall, a short bounce, and then a quick recovery.  Most bear markets (stocks included) have a more gradual slide that eclipses the early "sudden fall" that people thought was the bottom.

I don't have any idea what that might be - could be anything really.  Then again, new money coming in could bring us out of this much faster - really hard to say.
> And yes state sponsored coins are probably the way it will go, because they will make all the other ones illegal, or close to that.

Right because state-sponsored money really fits the whole "hard money" principle, right? 
> It matters to some people to lose 80 or 90% of their money on an investment. It matters to me if I lose 5% or more.

What are you talking about? HODL means you don't sell, i.e. the losses are unrealized. 

>I say 50%, mainly because of gov't regulation. It's already been made effectively illegal for 3 or 4 billion people to buy BTC. As that number keeps going up, the price will likely keep going down.

Not in Western Democracies. That simply hasn't been the case at all. Virtually any hints at regulation have been casual and minimal. In fact, the space desperately wants and needs regulation. Too many ICO scams and too many piece of shit exchanges. Sensible regulation would be a good thing. 

>It is probably lower than 50%, but the price can be manipulated and pumped easily, so it's possible that could happen sometime in the next 100 years.

Lol, you still haven't explained how you arrived at these numbers. You're just pulling them out of thin air.

>And even if it isn't technically illegal and you have submit DNA sample (Or nearly that) to buy cryptocurrency, then it has effectively changed the value proposition and utility of the currency, making it less valuable to people and the market price will reflect that.

Let's say that ridiculous scenario is true, how does that change the value proposition? How does that change its hard money properties. How does that affect transacting on LN? How does that prevent people from trading peer-to-peer without using a regulated exchange (that takes a DNA sample, lol).

>You say 1% it never makes it to $20K again. I say 50% (and I'm being generous). We will agree to disagree.

But you've given no reasonable analysis as to how you arrived at those numbers. You're seemingly just making them up. Not sure how we can agree to disagree when your numbers and probabilities aren't really based in anything substantive on concrete. You really think Bitcoin topped out at a less-than $500 Billion market cap? That just makes no sense in regards to the vast array of use cases it solves for (globally). Please show some math.

> Expecting 2014 to repeat itself "just because" is a meme.

Hype cycles are not a meme. In fact, market cycles in general are not a meme. How is my statement "just because"? I gave several reasons.

>Also, most people either trade short-term because they admit they can't predict the long-term or trade long-term because they know they can't predict the short-term random noise

Most people do either one of two options? Nice vague statement, bro. Analysis of cold addresses and days destroyed over time would prove you very wrong. Bitcoin float is very small. 

>You're arrogant enough to claim to know both.

I think you misread my comment. I didn't claim to know what the market will do. I'm simply pointing out the there's precedent for much more downside and reasons to believe the market isn't ready to bull again in the short/medium term. Long term still looks bullish af. I'm not claiming to *know* the market is going to do anything specific in any of these time frames. Also, do you realize what sub you're in? This is an analysis sub, duh.
lol
Not just smart, I have the intelligence of a psychopath!
There wont be any crypto skyrockets, the insaniy of last year will never be repeated. Don't be delusional.
gogurt
oh I was just kidding, thought their usernames matched up well, had a nice ring to it lol
lol Is that stoner still around?
They both short. 
So if there is a fixed and finite number of coins to be made, then for the price to go up without liquidity being lost, you would have to never be able to lose a coin.

This is unrealistic as people *will* lose their keys. So the actually total number of coins available will fall over time. It doesn't matter how many people want them though, because due to the fact that the supply will decline, there will simply be fewer to go around.

Now extreme hoarding is approximately equal to this. If you aren't ever willing to let go of your coins, for all intents and purposes, your coins are "lost" to the network.

As the count gets too low, available supply and liquidity become too much of an issue for people to stay around. Therefore they will simply go to a similar product (a fork or another crypto). ETH solved this problem by having a fixed but limit supply of new ETH created each *year* (18 million). This accounts for any lost coins and over the longer term, the growth of the total supply reaches a limit of zero and therefore doesn't face longer term inflation.
But why would they?

Tell me how BTC is more convenient than fiat?
Such as stealing Mac designs. Also outside USA nobody knows or cares about Bill Gates and his philanthropic bullshit
You think billionaires hold ScroogeMcDuck-esque hoards of cash and are panicking because internet funny money is going to replace it? Wealthy people own productive investments that generate income no matter what the prevailing currency is.
Yes that's what I said.
Is there something wrong with your brain?
I want Bitcoin to go up, doesn't mean it will doesn't mean it won't.

I short on the way down, I long on the way up. So I'm fine.

Are you?! 
It can be done and has been done. But it's temporary.  Moving the price and moving the market are very different things.  I'm sure the people who were dumping in January are quite surprised that we're up 40 percent since they wasted billions trying to "move the market."
I hope you're right but I think you're wrong.
The only reason to do this is to profit off of increases/decreases in spread between perp and futures, yeah?
Happy I didnt open a long. Just gonna ride my short out 
Do stops always execute if you don't currently have a position open? Opening a position at market is a pain when servers are under heavy load, sometimes have to try 3-6 times to get it to work. Do stops have a 100% success rate even if you don't have a position open 
i don't need to have a minimum of 10k? or any special investor crap. 
I'm not talking about that kind of freedom...I'm talking about the kind that comes with bombs and death....like all of the other places we've decided to help recently.
Wasn't that domination the result of improper tying? 
Without a doubt. That is because the PC came with it when Microsoft realized how important it was. It was easy for them since they already had the market share. The reason they lost is because the browser is vastly inferior to other browsers even with that advantage. 
[deleted]
$0.09? Sure.
cool thanks for your perspective
well said
Yea it was weird and that SEC FUD came at right time too 
Don't get me wrong - I'm not a fan of it at all. I don't have a PayPal account and I love that I can freely send money with Bitcoin, but I think it's a rather niche problem that most people would prefer to deal with in a way where the value doesn't fluctuate wildly. 

Not to mention that I genuinely do not think Lightning Network is the solution for Bitcoin's capacity problems, though I'm really not quite sure what exactly is.
because it's the best option they have and people tend make decisions based on self-interest. bitcoin doesn't need to be perfect, it just has to be the best solution to a massive worldwide problem. 

edit: wording
Exactly
You're right. It's a small short though and I plan to add to to it if it fails again.
ultra-thin with the blue waffle iron dial
Oops, read your comment too quickly. Thought you meant bounced from 10k resistance.

Does support turns to resistance occur more often in crypto than in regular stock markets?
Well me and you a while back referenced this “ bear flag thing “ formation we are looking at here. A giant red pole followed by consolidation in a 100-300$ range. It’s not necessarily a bear flag, but it has been a pattern, same thing happened on the 26th. 

26th Chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/jjEUikVX/
That one is absolutely made up, although I will say that it has a much higher success rate than almost any other formation I generally look out for.

Any reason you did not just close at the bottom? Usually insane interest is a good top/bottom indicator? I understand your positions are quite big and you can't just market close them, but you could move portions over to futures instead of swaps, no?
I remember, just misunderstood, thought you just got onto that point.

Well, looking forward, really curious in those points more than the size.
Here's to that. 
A pig’s snout is an important tool for finding food in the ground and sensing the world around them.
Your assumption is blunt and doesn't ring true for everyone. Many people have a hodling stack because they think Bitcoin will be worth much more $$$ than now within the next few years. Many hodlers really don't believe BTC is going to replace fiat money.
>I assume the end goal is to pay with BTC/crypto for everything

You assume wrong. Fiat works really well for some things.
It is not "quite hard" to generate trading profit in a bleeding bear market.  People could make 70% return in a couple of months if they shorted near $20K and covered near $6 and a lot of people were smart enough to do that.
That's why it's easier to stick to spot price...

9.4 is point to watch, 9.5 breaking is time to bail.
Yeah I wanna focus on the bot a little bit.  Think I finally got it profitable.  Will share with you what I learned after a few more days of testing.  These dumps, and the little rise before them, were a great test for it.
Your inferiority complex is not my problem.
> I don't understand what about going to $10k and getting hard rejected at $10k is bullish, but that's literally all that happened to cause the premium to spike.

The first half of your comment is the bullish part (and the likely cause for the inflated premium), and the second half of your comment wasn't confirmed until the market broke below $9,200.

The premium inflated because buyers assumed (wrongly) that the market was about to break $10,000 and make its way to $11,700. 

It remained inflated because **that possibility was still very much on the table**, despite the moderate bounce off $10,000. 

It deflated gradually as $10,000 slipped away and $9,000 got closer. 
No its not, since his criticism was that people who longed while there was a premium kept increasing the premium despite eventually being wrong about the eventual direction of the market. 

I mean really, what you're suggesting doesn't really make sense at all- he should have gotten out before the premium appeared or else he's dumb..? o_O 

>Even smart traders like you will hamster themselves into paying unjustified premiums on longs

But he didn't pay it, he was holding it from before 
You say 50k in your second link.
Technically that was all market stop-losses on shorts that cascaded into one huge market buy that cleared order books up to 50k.
Any major drop this time is likely to break 6k.
Definitely the reason why when we hit the $9400 level buyers become essentially ghosts, I myself would not open a fresh long from anywhere over $9,300. 

But on the other hand, we have made a new local high and these bear flag formations have been breaking to the upside. 

Honestly pretty clueless on where the market is headed next 
I read somewhere a good point about this.
  
Why use the public internet when you just can use your private one?

Bad boy! You edited your comment :)
The original one was  ! long xbtusd 9525 add -lev 0.5x and that was wrong. For now i have no control over edited posts, will try to implement it over the weekend.
Yeah, strange drop with a bit of rest on 9.2.

Now we could say that if that h&s on 1h was valid then we're somewhere around it's target now.
Yes trading is exhausting, both physically and mentally, at least if you do it right.  Holding is much less stressful, but only if the price is going up or you have convinced yourself to a religious extent that it eventually will.
If my CA was in the 6-7k range, I'd just let it ride too. Maybe just follow Moon math strategy. Everyone seems to be expecting a retrace to 8.8k, but it seems they only want it to go there to buy back lower.

Although the possibilities 4.5k (not trying to FUD) is fully within the long term log channel, you have to wonder if anyone here won't buy 8k if given the chance tomorrow.
I suppose all holding eventually results in a trade, unless you die first or give your holdings away to someone else.
Haha I closed that one -_- I'm so pissed. It was a good one. 

I left swaps open though. 

Where did you sell? Just curious if you sold above here or not 
You are correct....the main takeaway here is that we have not closed a candle under my buy zone, even after this dumpy evening.

If it does play out as a diamond, we should be nearing completion. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/gmytVVmE/
oh it could totally be noise, if I knew for sure I wouldn't ask for people's opinions. 
I really think you overanalyze some really small movements.. Especially when you don't do it with the price going down...

You're trying to attribute every single tiny noisy movement to a piece of news...it just doesn't work that way. 
Me too, but woke up and saw September futures on mex were still up around 10k so got it in anyway.
Did you short it at that time?
If this an inverse bart, and the Bbands are this tight on the daily. 

An explosion upward and a missed long entry from this price point would be very upsetting. 
I'd say the recognition is tied to wealth expressed in fiat value equivalent. Sure, they have to keep some of the wealth in fiat, because of liquidity factors.

Berkshire has these large reserves to allow them to be "actionable" - which is again tied to other assets liquidity, but while significant in size, proportionally it's not as impactful to their wealth as you suggest.
 whats 17 and 17.3 coming from, and 20000
are 20000 and 1150 the two local ATH's for 2014 and 2017?


what are the main use cases?

1. cross border remittances?  we have wire xfers

bitcoin's faster, less prone to freezes and delays

2. wealth storage? we have gold

bitcoin's lighter, more portable, cheaper to store, easier to liquidate

3. illicit economy (local)? cash is king

bitcoin's tougher to steal, more difficult to confiscate by law enforcement

4. iliicit economy (cross-border)  wire xfer + front company

bitcoin's cheaper, more private, fewer middlemen for law enforcement to target


Govt's wanna kill bitcoin?  Fix the first 2 so legal means are just as efficient.  That gets rid of the mass appeal aspect.  Then target criminals in the thinned herd.  Force them into privacy coins.  Then ban all privacy coins everywhere, make possession a 50 year sentence.





As I said, there is no hope for you.

> So if there is a fixed and finite number of coins to be made, then for the price to go up without liquidity being lost, you would have to never be able to lose a coin.

Why? Can you explain this? Liquidity is relative to the available supply (and market cap), so I'm not following how you're getting to that conclusion.

>So the actually total number of coins available will fall over time. It doesn't matter how many people want them though, because due to the fact that the supply will decline, there will simply be fewer to go around.

That simply doesn't matter. Again, liquidity is relative to the circulating supply of the underlying asset. It's not as if Bitcoins aren't sub-dividable. They are, to 8 decimals places (and further division can be implemented). So I don't understand why circulating supply would effect liquidity. Principles of equilibrium would suggest that the float would adjust to account for these missing coins. 

>Now extreme hoarding is approximately equal to this. If you aren't ever willing to let go of your coins, for all intensive purposes, your coins are "lost" to the network.

Until they aren't. Large market sells will obviously have short term impacts on liquidity but this effect can't be repeated forever and liquidity gets better with each subsequent dump.


>As the count gets too low, available supply and liquidity become too much of an issue for people to stay around. Therefore they will simply go to a similar product (a fork or another crypto). ETH solved this problem by having a fixed but limit supply of new ETH created each year (18 million). This accounts for any lost coins and over the longer term, the growth of the total supply reaches a limit of zero and therefore doesn't face longer term inflation.

This argument doesn't make sense. Float is relative to circulating supply, not absolute supply. The network and markets adjust for lost coins and the market once again approaches equilibrium. If supply is tied up with HODLers then the demand drives up the price and some portion of HODLers dump, providing liquidity and adding supply to the float. 

Ethereum does a lot of weird things. Not sure why their issuance policies should be lauded. 

> for all intensive purposes

I am sorry to be the baron of bad news, but you seem buttered, so allow me to play doubles advocate here for a moment. For all intensive purposes I think you are wrong. In an age where false morals are a diamond dozen, true virtues are a blessing in the skies, and are more than just ice king on the cake. We often put our false morality on a petal stool like a bunch of pre-Madonnas, but you all seem to be taking something very valuable for granite.

So I ask of you to mustard up all the strength you can because it is a doggy dog world out there. Although there is some merit to what you are saying it seems like you have a huge ship on your shoulder. In your argument you seem to throw everything in but the kids Nsync, and even though you are having a feel day with this I am here to bring you back into reality.

I have a sick sense when it comes to these types of things. It is almost spooky, because I cannot turn a blonde eye to these glaring flaws in your rhetoric. I have zero taller ants when it comes to people spouting out hate in the name of moral righteousness. You just need to remember what comes around is all around, and when supply and command fails you will be the first to go.

Make my words, when you get down to brass stacks it doesn't take rocket appliances to get two birds stoned at once. It's clear who makes the pants in this relationship, and sometimes you just have to swallow your prize and accept the fax, instead of making a half-harded effort. You might have to come to this conclusion through denial and error but I swear on my mother's mating name that when you put the petal to the medal you will pass with flying carpets like it's a peach of cake.


> ETH solved this problem by having a fixed but limit supply of new ETH created each year (18 million)

Incorrect...
The only argument I have is that BTC allows you to pay your counterparty via a “cheap” key-pair, as oppose to exchanging identifying information.

This makes it far more suitable for peer-to-peer payments
> outside USA nobody knows blabla

Mate, we do. 
Lol, you're saying a few cut-throat business practices are a bigger part of Bill Gates than helping to eradicate Polio? 

What a load of crap. BTW, Apple stole plenty of ideas too. 

Also, Steve Jobs was a total cunt compared to Bill Gates. There's a huge distinction to be made in terms of how these two acted with money and power. 
They care in Africa
"our cars" rather: "or cares" ?

Told you my dude! Hopefully you got your order filled at $9,050 like you wanted. :)
>The only reason to do this is to profit off of increases/decreases in spread between perp and futures, yeah?

Yeah, but important to consider funding rebates. Little point in shorting September futures at a 4% premium if your perpet long ends up paying 10% to shorts during that time. 
>Do stops always execute if you don't currently have a position open? Opening a position at market is a pain when servers are under heavy load, sometimes have to try 3-6 times to get it to work. Do stops have a 100% success rate even if you don't have a position open 

I've been using stops in this fashion for a few months now due to server load issues. Most reliable way to get an order through, no failures yet. 
And I was referring to the same, and our willingness to pay the price for it. 
lol no. Not at all dude
that fud is why i shorted, thinking it would cause profit-taking after a long run up.  I didnt know it was FUD.  VanteyX is our head researcher now.

He is russian and doesnt believe imperialist propaganda.

Thing is, if they're unbanked, how do they obtain bitcoin in the first place? The best way to get bitcoin right now is to buy it. 

Not to mention that Bitcoin has still done, in my opinion at least, very little to resolve its glaring capacity issues.
I wouldn't add to it on the way up. Hard to say what will happen when we break up, it might break 10k this time.
Not sure but I don't think so. The concept is at least the same though.
Ah ok so you were specifically referencing those bear whatevers :) I get your point now. 
Decided to close one night, and woke up the next morning to see that BGD had skyrocketed the price. :/
>Your assumption is blunt and doesn't ring true for everyone

I agree, but for many it seems to be their point.


>Many hodlers really don't believe BTC is going to replace fiat money.

That's sad, since it's the perfect example of doing this while undermining the legitimacy of the state since it can not tax what it can not control and the same time exposing the printing press at the federal reserve. By the way, fun fact is that some people both here and at the friendly Buttcoin subreddit complains when (or they assume) Bitfinex prints tether, while at the same time cheering for the US government to regulate things like ICOs, which are doing EXACTLY the same thing while devaluing their own currency at the same time
Unless you live in Venezuela, Argentina or Cyprus when the state comes and inflates or steal your bank money
The varying premium is the tricky part for that, especially with trying to set limit orders ahead. I may move everything down $50 from where it is right now. 
Nice, looking forward to it. I tweaked a few things myself, but I'm in the process of sending it some more to play with so it can actually do what it's designed to do. Probably won't have any update on mine until the weekend at best. 
He chose to remain long while there was the massive premium for no good reason at all. That is the exact same decision as choosing to open a long while there was a massive premium for no good reason at all. 

Google sunk cost fallacy. Dunno what else to tell ya. 
Yes, I said up to 50k, then down to 10k, an 80% correction.
:) 50k is 50k though :)
Because the double bottom narrative is not applicabe? Maybe, interesting thought 
If it is an accumulation range, the streets have been emptied for the decided buyers to proceed.
I've actually deleted and added. But yes, I posted close and then the right command so the position was already closed.

My bad :-(
You want some FUD, check out tone vays today on Twitter. God damn crypto winter in his books $1300 btc as a decent opportunity. But then again, he did call like $7500 his top mid last year, so there is that. 
Well, I still think this is a bear flag that we're in ~9.2-~9.4
well actually, I anticipated this move this morning, so I didn't see the move and say "what caused this?!" rather, I predicted it and it came true. could be a coincidence but I wouldn't bet on it. 

edit: also,to say that I attribute every single tiny noisy moment to a piece of news is simply untrue 
Of course fiat reserves are for stability/liquidity/actionability.

"As I suggest"?

I suggest they're less optimally situated [to a debatable degree] in terms of moat/wealth/power in a global, permissionless currency world. 

Most wealth-accumulators consider uncertainty in status-quo reduction a scary thought. 




sorry I meant to write 17.3 both times. I look at 2014 prices * 17.3 on tradingview a lot to see similarities between 2014 and now, since $20000/$1150= 17.3. 

yeah basically 
Yes, the point is that Bitcoin fulfills each of these use cases better than the counterparts *and* fulfills the other use case simultaneously. Any rough-hand extrapolation based on that gives valuations far greater than $0.5 T.

it's going to be fucking epic
/u/fuckharvey 

Still curious about a response here.
Um...I was on my phone and it autocorrected me. -.-'
That's not incorrect. 18 million new coins is the limit it hits of newly mined coins each year.
But that isn't a big enough reason to use it to be honest.

P2P payments aren't all that big of a utility cause the vast majority of P2P are with people you would know and already have your information.
Never said the rest were clean.
Autocorrect set to Romanian instead of English
Actually filled at $9150.  Oops.  Should have stood firm at $8800.
Awwww thanks, it's good to know that, I haven't tried setting stops like this yet since server issues 
Fair enough...12 military bases in Iraq and a half million people dead...thats quite the price to pay!
[deleted]
I believe in socialism , vodka and bears.
you buy it from your friend, or anyone who is willing to sell it, with cash. bitcoin is a digital *peer to peer* asset
Bears such as the American Black Bear and the Grizzly Bear hibernate in the winter. Their heart rates drop from a normal 55 to only 9!
Similar, only I decided to go long. But I didnt have the balls tbh
I'm sorry but I can't qualify your post any other way than mindless ranting.
If you made a venn diagram of people with Bitcoin hodling stacks as one circle, and people living in those countries as another circle, the overlapping area would be extremely tiny.
You can set index price stop for another exchange.

But yeah, handling premium is tricky when you want to bail out but can be profitable if you catch change of sentiment. This first drop to 9k today went below 9k on futs, so whole $200+ premium evaporated just to build back up moments later.
No its not at all lmao he realizes the gains of the premium and didn't have to pay it since he longed before it existed. 

You even said it  yourself...they get into unjustified premiums for longs. But he didn't do that.

You're wrong but ok
Well, it is, but you can't say that market went to 50k. Market went ballistic from 6 to 8 in such a small time frame that all those stops triggered and bought up all orders up to 50k. If you hadn't order there then you couldn't buy or sell up there, so the market technically didn't go there. It was a wick.
Psychology.

First drop was sudden and bought up quickly when people decided it's the bottom.

Second drop was slow and steady and people decided that 6.5 is close enough to the last bottom so they started to buy close to there, price didn't want to drop so fomo started.

Third drop will be like 'looks like 6k wasn't the bottom'.
No problem, this is still alpha phase. I registered a domain to host the database and bot so when i have the bot handling PMs we can have a proper test site to abuse and test all this things without compromising the production database. I appreciate your efforts in using and testing the bot as i have little time for actual testing. 
IMO this is looking just like the fall after our first go at 9.7k.... first drop was flag second was accumulation. 

Just one reason I think we could move up from here :)

https://www.tradingview.com/x/47ikruCK/
You have done it several times now. And people called it ridiculous and you tried to argue with them.

You thought one of our moves was due to an apple announcement...o_O 

If you want to trade long term fundamentals I would ignore anything under 10-20% movements. You'll drive yourself crazy trying to analyze every $75 movement 
yeah inventing better money is kind of a valuable thing.

Yeah it happens...I just couldn't pass up the opportunity to share some good copypasta.
[deleted]
Yeah but what specifically do Bill do that was all that sketchy? You're acting like he did something that tarnished his underlying character. Did he? I'm honestly curious. What did he do that was so bad?
[deleted]
Very fair compared to 40 years of oppression and destruction of one of the oldest and richest cultures in the world. We will pay twice that price if it sees this regime gone. Trust me, you don't want these guys around much longer. Our lives are already ruined, maybe the world and our future generations will see some peace.
So what? They didn't need new releases because they were dominating the market. Your claim that they "gave up" is the one that shifts the burden of proof. Positive claims require evidence not the rejections of claims. For example, "gave up" implies that they could not compete, were losing share and didn't care, Etc.... If you are going to make a claim, you should back it up with more than just "they only came out with 2 major releases" of which the word Major needs to be justified even further. 
Probably, but this doesn't counter that it is a very good case for BTC 
Interesting. I've only used stops on last, since mex goes so insane sometimes. I also didn't see futures dipped below 9K this morning. Damn, that would have been a sweet entry. 
Here's the issue with my strategy that he had:

I claimed I was expecting a pullback but planned to hold the position until breakeven regardless. 

His argument is that holding a position at x is the same as opening a position at x. 

So if i'm long from $8,700 and the market is at $9,300, if the market falls to $8,900 before I close...it's no different than if I had opened a long at $9,300 and closed it for a loss at $8,900. 

And he's absolutely correct there.

But what he's hung up on that I disagree with is he's ignoring the fact that nobody can squeeze every $ out of every move. I can't short $9,150, close it at $9,050, long $9,050 and then reshort at $9,150 all day long. 

And even larger moves aren't necessarily worth agonizing over. 

There has been about $1,000 of tradeable moves in the past week that I missed out on by holding my position. For example, I could have closed my long at $9,800, shorted to $9,550 and then reopened my long at $9,550. 

But there's no way I'm going to wind up on the right side of every 3% move. So instead I focus on getting the 10% to 20% moves right and ignoring the majority of the rest.
I'd give up, man. I hope this guy doesn't try to use logic or explain things to people on the regular. 
You are still justifying his decision he made yesterday based on a decision he made initially to get into position. The definition of sunk cost fallacy. 

Once you realize that holding his long was no different of a decision than opening a fresh long right there, you will understand. 
Also, minor point, during a panic, people might, you know, decide to   disregard TA.  It's not infallible.

You should do some help message. If it doesn't understand or when i go with something like !tradebot help.

When you're on mobile it's sometimes hard to search for the site, open it etc. so it would be useful to check the syntax from reddit.
And one more thing. I think 'entry time' would be useful on that table. I'd like to know if someone entered position now or he's holding for a week.
I still think it's a bear flag with fake-outs both ways.
so I'm not allowed to argue? that's the whole point here, exchanging ideas and not being afraid to express opinions. i'm not going to stop asking questions 
at the the of the day, you're a bear and I'm a bull, and we need each other. I need you to crush my moon impulses and remind me to take profit, and you need me to tell you that $3K ain't happening, BTC does have *actual* use cases right now, etc
Greater than the sum of its parts.
Not really. They will keep making more until they move to Proof of Stake which I'm still not sure will happen for a number of reasons, including one in which I wrote a post about.
I develop programs on Microsoft technologies :))
Well come up with a few trillion bucks and I'll give ol Donald a ring, he loves dropping bombs on folks.
[deleted]
I never argued against a case for BTC lol
There are 3 kinds of stops there.

I missed the drop, saw it when it was already back above 9.1. that would be nice close from almost 9.6 entry on futs when spot dipped only $300 ;-) now I'll probably end up in closing at be.
Yeah idk...usually seems like a smart guy but he literally says "they hamster themselves into paying  unjustified premiums on longs" but chew did not pay the premium...he reaped it. No logic there 
Opening a long at $9600 with no premium is different than opening one with a premium...really...you said it in your own comment. 
Of course. But TA is for r/r ratio, not a crystal ball. Even if r/r is almost perfect you still have this 1% chance that it'll go against you, that's what stops are for.
Will add this when the bot handles PMs.
Mouse over the opening value shows the opening date
I don't disagree w that, I just think watching for small movements on long term fundamentals will drive you crazy in the end. or it'll mislead you a lot, that's all I really meant 
adding to wealth storage: 

1.  bitcoin's lighter, more portable, cheaper to store, easier to liquidate, doesn't create commodity scarcity, drive up real estate prices on the poor, create needless hoarding.

Only Romanian code on MSFT tech, the rest of the world still use paper and pencil. They don’t know about Gates.
Sorry man, fresh out :D but it seems Israel and Saudi Arabia are willing to pay this bill 
Did you even read my post? Your entire claim is that they "gave up" because of what you feel is realistic or not to do? Its not "realistic" that our universe exists at all so I guess it must not right? Your claim is completely useless without supporting evidence. What you have is barely even anecdotal. 
I longed 6400 on Sept when spot was probably at least 6600, and closed at 9900 when spot was 9600. 

I longed 9115 on June when spot was 9200 and closed at 9790 when spot was 9620.

I definitely felt hamstered. (I think he meant hamstrung?)
Correct.

Yet he held a long with a premium. And since holding a long is the same decision as opening a long.....

You are almost there!
I follow TA but if we break 6k there's a real possibility of a total collapse.  We don't know which exchanges are swimming naked, but I'm sure plenty are.  Miners could close shop en masse, the whole ponzi could come crashing down.

In certain scenarios you shouldnt be looking to 'trade the move' you should be grabbing the life preserver.  

The prices on the chart wont mean anything.  You wont be able to get your coins in/out.  It'll be 0.  The longs will have 0.  the SHORTS will have 0.







Shit... Do that on mobile...
well I appreciate your concern for my well-being. as far as AAPL goes, I actually received more than one PM from some very smart sounding people, and we had the rest of the conversation privately since my post was downvoted out of visibility.
Thats a good point...certainly an interesting alliance.
[deleted]
No, hamster is a word for a verb that lots of redpillers use to describe women who convince themselves of double truths. It basically means "to convince yourself of something with little logic"

It's a way to express disdain for anyone who went long on futures at a premium lol 

And yeah, his criticism does not make sense at all. I could've shorted swaps and longed futures before the premium and made serious money from just letting it sit. Does that make me as dumb as the guys who simply went long in futures above $9.5k? 
You really don't get it, do you. 
I get what you're saying that holding a long is the same as opening one but it's kind of a simplification of trading and of his criticism and doesn't factor in the risk/reward aspects of opening a trade vs holding one. 

Plus you quite literally said he is paying a premium, which he's not. He got in at a discount even, I think. 

No need to be condescending...especially when you're the one contradicting your own statement o_O 
If we break 1k down it still won't collapse. Of course, some miners will be out of market, but remember, it needs couple of PC's and some buyers to work. There will be still a lot of people playing. And exchanges don't give a f*ck, they make money from fees. Doesn't really matter how much btc is worth, it matters what's the volume in USD.
I'll add a new column with the open date
You just keep saying the same thing. You just dont get it. Check this out for future reference

https://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/science-fair/steps-of-the-scientific-method
I didn't even know that was a thing. I had to google almost everything you wrote in your first sentence.

Yeesh.
You are still trying to slightly distinguish opening a log and holding one. You think there is a different reward/risk setup between the two because you aren’t counting his profits from his original trade as real money at risk. That is the sunk cost fallacy.
If I had a big open short I'd be closing it at 3000 and going fiat, even if i KNEW it was going lower.

If enron and lehman can go under believe me fuckboys incorporated in the island of xixocuahotl tribal council can say they got hacked and disappear with all funds.



Lol. Yeah I get his point now but it's mainly just him hyperfocusing on the sunk cost fallacy...he thinks holding a long from $8600 is the same as opening one at $10,000 because it's all money in the end anyway...

I mean, I get it, just...in the context of our conversation it really isn't super relevant, since chewy's criticism was leveled at futures traders who created the premium, not futures traders who were simply long 
Okay. His initial criticism was leveled at traders creating the premium. He did not create the premium, he reaped it. Do you understand? I don't really care about the sunk cost fallacy...it is completely irrelevant here anyway, you made up a situation in your head in which it's relevant somehow 

You said he paid for a premium. he did not. Do you want to clarify what you meant? 
Some wouldn't do that.
He did not reap the premium. He held until premium was gone, as far as I knew at least. Didn’t know he closed it and shorted at some point. 
No, premium is still there, and he closed it at $9300 shorted $9420. Anyway, I do get your point now. He sort of is criticizing himself in a way, although I'd personally argue he's not nearly as dumb as the people longing at a 4% premium even if that is the sunk cost fallacy.
