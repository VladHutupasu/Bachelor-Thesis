[Daily Discussion] Monday, April 09, 2018 -- TITLE
#New post: [\[Daily Discussion\] Tuesday, April 10, 2018 →](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8b4twg/daily_discussion_tuesday_april_10_2018/)
I'm noticing that  12 hour BBands are tightening. They're as tight as they've been since November. We should be looking at bear and bull cases for a breakout or breakdown for both.

## The bear case:

* Breaking down from resistance toward support
* FUD campaigns
* lower bound of long-term trend is untested for over a year
* Low sentiment
* A&E double bottoms break down  before they are confirmed 64% of the time (we have one unconfirmed on the 4 hour and one unconfirmed on the one week)
* The trend is down
* Overlaying 2014 shows there's still a long way to go, both down and sideways
* **Active addresses have substantially dropped**


## The bull case:

* Price unable to find new lows in 8 weeks (out of a 14 week bear trend)
* Low sentiment may indicate that "blood is in the street"
* Bull hype
* We've been testing the right half of an A&E double bottom for 3 weeks and haven't been able to break it down closer to 6k
* Segwit transactions are close to 35% of all transactions
* Lightning has wallets in beta
* Fees are near 0
* Mempool is empty
* Average transaction is back under 40k USD.
* Hash rate is continuing to climb
* **Active addresses appear to have bottomed out at about where we were before the latest runup while increasing the average transaction value 10x since then.**

Since you guys seemed to like the blast from the past that I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8anmvt/daily_discussion_sunday_april_08_2018/dx1ilg2/) yesterday, [here is another one for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/cofeg/bitcoin_is_a_peertopeer_networkbased_digital/). It's got such gems as:

> If I understand the system correctly, right now it's not a fair one: the sooner you get in, the "richer" you'll be by the time all 21 million coins are out there, without really having earned them, other than that you got lucky / were there first, not unlike the various gold rushes.
>> Thing is, it's too late -- it's been on Reddit for 20 hours now, so even if I started now, I wouldn't be within the "first few". This thread was an interesting read (unlike the actual link), but downloading the software would be as waste of time.
 
And:

> If I could build real wealth with bitcoins, I'd setup a god dam data center in my basement with tons of i7s (or whatever computed it fastest) just cranking out bitcoins.
> Also what if someone creates a hardware based CPU designed for bitcoin minting? Specialized hardware, you know like video cards. What if they could create a billion bitcoins a second with one of these cpus?

And:

> how do I get a loan with this
>> Just wait a week for the Wall Street banks to get regulatory approval for it with minimal oversight. Then you'll have about a month before the quants fsck it up and the bottom falls out.

And:

> So what are the chances, if I start doing this now, that it will make me rich in the future?
>> .00000954334%
>>> So you're telling me there's a chance!

And, of course, future /r/Buttcoin members:

Just closed my $1.2m short from $7044 [here,](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8anmvt/z/dx0hfe8) at $6766. 4% profit. 
I'm cautiously bullish here for the following reasons:

We've had 10 days of support in the mid-$6k range.  Price has been bearish for *35 days* after the double top at 3/5.  Price doesn't move in one direction forever.  [The support plus lack of lower lows suggests a possible reversal.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/QGDnEcSZ/)

[Price is $2200 under the 200 day moving average on the daily chart.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/IYZMKDXm/)  The last time price drifted this far below was during the capitulation event on 2/6 after which price doubled over the following 2 weeks.  I'm not expecting such a quick doubling without a similar capitulation event, but it's important to be mindful of these oscillators as price tends to honor big debts in either direction.

We've been moving down along an [accelerated downtrend line as compared to historical downtrend from peak.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/oz6zzmch/)  This means that short term downward price movement has been outpacing the mean.

Furthermore, when drawing a line against bottom wicks, it looks like price is being constrained into a [bull wedge on the daily](https://www.tradingview.com/x/gnJxuPCV/) giving some indicator of an impending reversal. 

We're oversold on short time frames and nearing oversold on the longer time frames, making this a favorable place to consider building a long position.

I'm cautious only because we haven't had a real capitulation move like 2/6 which would be another brainless buying opportunity.  If we break below $6.5k, I am expecting a somewhat precipitous fall.

I'm staging buys between here and $5k should such an event occur.  

Safe trading!


Well guys, it's been fun. I had to fully cash out tonight due to a major life circumstance. I'll keep watching the threads and the price, but I won't be back in for a few months.
I wonder if this (6500-7500) is going to turn out to be a multi-week wyckoff-style accumulation range. I would expect IF this is the turning point and the market will turn bullish again, we should spend some time down here to build "cause". It would fit with tax season timing too -- some decent sell pressure, but no bullish sentiment yet. Sideways in this situation, when people are liquidating to pay taxes, should be seen as very bullish -- because it would indicate supply is being absorbed by stronger hands. People liquidating to pay taxes are the very definition of weak hands. Only once the supply is absorbed would it make sense for large sellers to start throwing down market buys. Leveraged bulls, don't get too eager here or you'll get chopped up. Spot bulls, carry on.
Long $4m @ $6744 average. I'm  expecting a bounce back to $7100+ in the near term. Stop loss at 5%. 
This is not a trollbox.

Since people seem to think it is then complain that we hand out temporary bans, this is your friendly reminder to stay on topic and to follow the rules of the sub. 

If you are having a hard time understanding the rules, shoot the mods a message and we can help out but I feel like they are pretty straight forward.

Thanks guys, hope all is well with yall.
Hi guys!

Just checking in really quick from my month long vacation on the West Coast!  I'm currently in Seattle.

Quite shocked at this mornings drop in price.

I'm not a "great" day trader -- but even those of us who aren't good at something, can sometimes do well.  I've been mining bitcoin since 2011 and, in hindsight, did really well when I sold 75% of my holdings at 17.3 and the other 25% at 14.4.  I bought a significant portion back when it was still in freefall back at 6.3 (prior to the 5.9 needle) and have; somehow (despite my bad trades), today, turned that into a modest 7.5% profit.  Much less of a return than some here on the forum.

I still have so much faith in this technology and the possibilities that blockchain/bitcoin can provide.  There are still $Billion+ investments being made utilizing the underlying tech.

As a miner, I cannot conceive that prices go down to the levels some are predicting.  For me (and all of my equipment (S9's) is long paid for -- AND my average electricity cost is ONLY $.065/Kwh -- lower than most) --it still costs $4,650 in electricity alone to mine 1 btc.

My guess is that I'd be at the lower end of the cost spectrum -- and yet the network/hash power keeps growing.  Because of THIS continued increase in hash rate, despite the decrease in price, is why I'm extremely bullish.

Holding my mildly underwater long and -- Back to my vacation...











Interesting trend on LocalBitcoins for [Venezuela](https://coin.dance/volume/localbitcoins/VEF), the volume is absolutely skyrocketing. Past week alone, volume reached nearly 2 Trillion Bolivar ~ $40M. Might not seem much but keep mind that most of the country is living on $10 per month or less.

It's so funny that basically all markets are the same, and that every time reinforces my belief that if you can trade one market you can trade all

https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8aymhw/how_and_why_exchanges_are_manipulating_the_price/

Crypt has it's "whale manipulation", gold and PCM has "chinese banks" buying everything and gold not stored in vaults and not accounted for, stocks has insider trading, T-bonds probably has something else I am not aware of

And of course this is always when price goes down or "is surpressed", never in the crazy bull markets. Or can someone point me to anyone complaining about the last Oil bull run up to 100$ barrel ?

Exactly

Another thing is that the market is the market, regardless what happens. It just exists and show prices, regardless what someone think. So people just need to adapt, in the every continues cycle of traders exploiting mispricing and over use of that method.  In the end what works before will not work now, and so on
Shorts just hit ATH, nothing to see here https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BITFINEX:BTCUSDSHORTS

If that 6655 wall on finex goes down, this will bounce
My positions so far has been bearish, and I’m currently on the sidelines with my entire trading stack. While I remain bearish, I’m starting to construct a bullish narrative to prepare myself for a switch at some point. And I’m not referring to short term +2-3% movements affecting my judgement here. I’m talking medium term outlook, daily charts etc. 

- There’s been some unusual market activity recently with both “Bart formations”, big strong movements (like 6.4-7.1k) and even small strong movements (like recent double support of 6.5k)

- One way of explaining the aforementioned types of movements could be Wyckoff accumulation patterns: https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/070715/making-money-wyckoff-way.asp

- Peter Brandt is certainly no oracle, but his observations are interesting: https://twitter.com/peterlbrandt/status/981230732881178624

- There’s also the possibility of an Adam and Eve bottom on the daily chart

- If this short term recovery continues, traders who shorted from ~11k will soon be considering to close. Money on the sideline for 3-6k might FOMO in soon.

- High volume on OTC is bullish

Edit: Added the last point
I'm on vacation and haven't been watching charts. I closed out of my short position in profit before I left (Friday), and set limit sells for a new short from 6960-7480, half of which triggered. 24H volume on GDAX last night was like 6K BTC, which is insane. I almost closed my futures long from 64xx, but I wasn't planning to close it unless we got to 7400. 

I glanced at the charts a few times over the weekend. Weird movement. I'm glad I wasn't around to try to trade that. Seems like a bunch of accumulation zones to lure in timid players followed by the maximum pain market order. Business as usual, but more blatantly so on the ridiculously low volume.

Good luck all.
As the price gets more stable, and the trading game becomes more and more boring, I like keeping an eye on volatility. [Namely, the 30 day and 60 day volatility.](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/volatility-index/) Think now's boring? The 30 day volatility is 4.60%. I've personally seen it go to 0.78%.

So, we might be in for a slow scenic boat journey around $6600-$7100 for the next few weeks, even months. Bulls and Bears seem t be very evenly matched. 
For anyone trying to claim that 6k is next, just remember percentages are larger the further down we go. To get from 6.7k to 6k is more than a 10% jump, which, I admit, BTC likes to do sometimes. But I wouldn't be surprised if we find support in the mid 6's again. If supply and demand really are equal here than that is exactly what will happen which would give me more confidence that 6k is a bottom and that people are accumulating and I should too. 
Ok, usually I do not enter positions when I am not in sure with the indicators, but since I am practicing playing around with futures and try to understand the price difference with swaps and other dates. I am longing June futures from 6654 here, since they were the lowest price

Either this thing totally breaks down to try the 6k range or the Bart dip buying that has emerged the last few days starts again. Also the Kraken buy wall is still there, and this will protect from some flash crashes probably. Someone is decided to keep the price up since over 1 week
That's a lot of shorts. We gained 4k shorts *after* the drop from 7.1. So if the price pumps here we'll have 4k underwater shorts....That may be what some whales are thinking if they are going to try to pump the price now. Also, 5k longs have closed in the past 24 hours for a total swing of 9k sells.


I think right now, though, looking at these numbers may not be useful. These shorts are battle-hardened and probably won't close unless the price gets above 7.2, so bull whales have a lot of ground to cover if they want a short squeeze, but a short squeeze is definitely possible.
I've posted in another comment about the shorts vs longs with how the price has reacted once shorts have exceeded longs on finex.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/VxbH991U/

Drilling down further into the recent drop I would advise further caution as to opening a short here as most of the shorts have already opened at the bottom of this formation.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/KSTMCroU/

A push higher here will put a lot of pressure on these and you could see a mini squeeze.

Disclaimer : Position - SHORT Fully Hedged 7100 XBTM18  

Still holding my short despite oversold RSI on shorter timeframes. 

If there is ever going to be a drop below $6,000, this move is likely it. I'd rather close my short at breakeven following a reversal than have to make the very difficult decision of opening a short below $6,000.

lol. the whole 24 hrs btc/usd volume of gdax on one 15min candle in bitfinex
Newbie question alert:

If I’m in a short purchased as a market order, and I want to close it out at a set price, can I limit buy a long with the same number of contracts/leverage to close it out? I’ve been closing my trades at market price so far and want to let one ride whilst I’m on holiday.

Edit: I’m using Bitmex.

Thanks.
Shorts at ATH, longs going down:

https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSDSHORTS/

https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSDLONGS/
This sub is way too obsessed with shorts/longs (and random factors in general)

You guys need to realize that a large increase in volume since last October along with us being at the same price back then means we're naturally going to be consistently hitting ATHs in leveraged bitcoin. this is because each bitcoin is worth less but we have more money ready to enter the market in a position

10,000 shorts here is 5,000 at $15k...

And then there's the "maximum pain" and "soros" and "bogdanoff" and "tax season" memes, which are all attempts to understand patterns where there are none- similar to astrology...

if you guys are joking that's fine but please...entering positions because shorts or longs hit an ATH is going to completely wreck people sooner or later when we exit this range and it turns out one of the two is much more correct than the other

>Bear case:

>As long as the bear trend is intact, bears have an edge. The cycle was too fast, we might bounce between 7-10K for a while before falling again, but I rather have it be sooner than later. I'm leaning toward the bear side because I want it to happen, because let me tell you something, these are the opportunities that'll make you rich. Crypto is 90% speculation, when bitcoin's at a massive discount--and people have their eyes set on already established 20K-- the fomo is gonna be even stronger. Bitcoin needs to have a speculative edge too, so this is all good for bitcoin^TM


[Feb 6, 2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/7vkr4y/daily_discussion_tuesday_february_06_2018/dttuvjn/)

>We're still not out of the bear trend.

>SEC news was known, they even sent out a public letter with their positive outlook on crypto. This is nothing new and nothing to trigger an overall trend reversal.

>The good news is that we fell so fucking hard, we dropped like 75% from ATH? The bear market will be over soon.... the faster it falls the quicker it will recover, just like we went up without much resistance, we fell down without much resistance, and we're gonna go back up without much resistance when it's time. Can't say if 5800 was the bottom, I'm still feeling $5K or lower, but I'm really liking this price action, glad we're getting the bear market over with quickly, I think we're gonna be fine


---

My opinion above remains. Still in a bear market, the trend is your friend, and I'm expecting us to go to $4K over the next 5-6 weeks. We had a capitulation-like parabolic dump to $5800 on Feb 6th... the price doesn't drop down in a straight line and stay there, a bounce was expected. Bear markets don't just end in a few short weeks with a massive V bottom, hence why I said *we might bounce between 7-10K for a while before falling again*. Btw I'm not saying I was right... we sure as hell went all the way up to 11K but even gods like me got fooled into thinking we might have escaped the bear. If I was smart I would've sold at that 11K bounce but I'm human and emotional and hopeful and greedy just like everyone else. If you look at the post-2013 bubble fractals the same thing happened (huge dump --> bull trap --> further decline). We've seen some massive dips get resolved all throughout last year, but when the price falls from 20K to below 10K your ass should know this isn't just another dip, this is a full blown bear market. Just like how you don't underestimate how high the bulls take the price during a bull run, you can't underestimate how low the bears take the price during the bear season. We could do a double bottom W reversal when we reach $6K, but I doubt it. Nothing about that chart says we're getting close to a reversal. When we do a slow bleed downwards back to the Feb 6th low, everyone knows the market is weak, bulls aren't gonna save you with that double bottom. And I don't rely on double bottoms. Most likely we're gonna break below 6K, scare the shit out of more people and get another taste of true despair before making a reversal. The good news is that this was gonna happen sooner or later, and nothing about this price action reflects bitcoin fundamentally. There was some irrational exuberance that took us to 20K too quickly, but some people will try to convince you bitcoin is an over-valued bubble that never belonged at 20K. Those people are idiots. Bitcoin's more legitimized and prevalent than its ever been, all signs show a network that keeps on getting stronger. This will no doubt be a multi-trillion dollar asset class, unless you think bitcoin is gonna fizzle out and die, good luck with that. $20K is a milestone we already achieved, when we're ready to go back there it won't be as hard next time. Until then enjoy the bear market, let the coin evolve without all the frenzy, and take advantage of the fear because this is where future millionaires are made. TR;DR - trend is your friend and long term bullish... keep things simple. 

I don't know man. As most of you guys know I'm an OG bear here. But I'm bullish for the short term right now untill we test and get rejected from some higher point. Shorts at a new ATH but we have failed to make lower lows. I would strongly advice against shorting here unless it's only a hedge. 
For all the haters of Bitmex's trading engine lately, just be glad they are actually trying to scale, instead of taking the approach Gemini is taking, which is to jack up fees to ludicrous levels in order to limit the amount of traders and the load on their trading servers. 


I know this isnt some feel good sub, and its serious, but I've been in the red for a while now and its eating at me hard. I was up 15k in December, and now im down 4k. 

Someone just please tell me that it is likely that sometime in the future we will recover, even if its not till the end of the year or 2019, even to just 10k. I need a pep talk.
Not much of a pushback, think this goes to at least 6700 before a retrace
if RSI is under 30, Isn't that a positive sign? Or maybe not since volume is in the dumpsters today I guess?
Don't have the *proof* on my clipboard but I would hazard to guess we're going sideways in the 6k-7200 as it narrows for >10 days until the market begins a slow climb like we saw last summer a la June, July. Although New public interest is waning the price continues to rise as those who use bitcoin as an investment vehicle continue to put money in the market. Thoughts?
https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/isQBDWIw-Important-area/

If we go much lower we break the below the trend line formed by the 11-2 and 2-6 lows. If we bounce out of that blue descending channel I will be very bullish.
When your clueless co-workers are starting to short BTC u know that something is off 
[removed]
so I made an [overlap chart](https://i.imgur.com/2qWG8RI.png) [yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8anmvt/daily_discussion_sunday_april_08_2018/dx10vfl/) that showed the 2014 bubble vs now but I was using 6 hour time frames and couldn't pull the whole thing without a lot of extra work.  So I made one with the daily time frame [here](https://i.imgur.com/3tuGpwv.png) showing current graph vs the whole 2014 bear market until it ended in Jan 2015.  

The graphs start a month before the peak which is when both bubbles started going parabolic.  If history repeats we should expect a short term reversal to test the log resistance sometime between now and June followed by a very long slow bleed.  

Someone also asked me to show the graphs aligned at the peaks.  I don't think this is a good way to look at it because it goes down proportional to how it went up but [here ya go](https://i.imgur.com/hVOxh1w.png).


Look at those shorts: https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BITFINEX:BTCUSDSHORTS
There's *no way* this can go on forever for the bears. This feels more and more like December turned upside down...
Newb question :
What would happen, if i short 100$ worth of BTC, with a 100x leverage, when BTC is (example) 7000$, and it goes to 5000$ ?
How much money would i have ?
A drop at 7200 is expected since it is right at log resistance. But why the whales would dump it so quick?
Some questions for more experienced traders.

How reliable do you find 15 minutes signals? Is anyone trading such low timeframes? I usually watch 1 hour + graphs, rarely shorter timeframes. Asking this because I saw bullish divergences on 15 and 30 minutes but as I am writing this they are being neglected.

Entered short at 7070, not considering exiting unless we climb up to the entry price. I feel like this can go much lower and I doubt I can get a better short position if I exit now. I think that we will reach the bottom of a white triangle, where is also the strong support green dotted line. I feel that is gonna be the crucial midterm point for BTC:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/1YnI1gcJ/
[removed]
Really can't figure out what to do. It seems like more people are expecting a further drop so I feel like I might have to open a long.
Long from 6750. Kind of a scalp trade. This is one of the rare times in the last few months where BTC has fallen more than the larger alts in a short time frame. I think alts would have followed by now so expecting a bounce. 
https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8b19zt/smart_money_is_accumulating_this_week/?st=jft2dlvn&sh=f5c08407



Thoughts on this? I'm quite sure that taxes have nothing to with this drop... like *at all*, but I'd like some input from this sub because everyone here is smarter than I am.



It's good hopium, that's for sure, but I honestly doubt it.
Bought some BTC (or sats) here at 6750, I don't know the bottom nor do I intend to time it. Will slowly DCA single digit % of my previous portfolio when the r/r feels good.
The slightest bounce will be seen as an opportunity for shorters to add and longers to close. Exact opposite happens with dips in bull market, except there is way less cheerleading for STFB than BTFD on reddit and twitter. DYOR.
So, any bears still not convinced we reached the bottom?
Bounced from 6.5-6.7 2x since we last bounced from 6k.

Whats your reason to believe we will still test lower levels regardless?

I'm growing pretty confident we reached the bottom of 2018, at last weeks levels.
And just like that everyone turns bearish again.

Question for u/_chewtoy_

Earlier you said that if we were going to visit 6k, today would be it. Can you expand on the reasoning for this please? Thanks!
Model price based on tx rate: 7-day average: $3593, 28-day average: $3752.

 Model price = 10^-0.638 \* (tx per day)^2.181 / # total coins.

Explanation is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2hyl9c/daily_discussion_wednesday_october_01_2014/ckxhy9y) with [historical graphs of price vs. model](https://i.imgur.com/HnZQ9rv.png) (last updated today) and [graphs of other correlations](http://imgur.com/a/7koaG) (last updated 2017-01-30). The code is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2oyrfq/code_for_tx_model/) if you want to improve on it.

Edits:

I updated the graph.

**Accuracy of model and recent 'bearishness'**

Note, that this model has been doing relatively well if it's within *the same order of magnitude*. That is to say, it's not a very accurate predictor of price, and to be within a factor of two of the market price (as it is now) is effectively no strong signal. However, it did dip just before the recent pop.

**Batching, UTXO count and so on.**
I have seen no convincing evidence that batching is currently a major effect to reduce the daily tx rate.
I am interested, long term, in alternatives to tx rate (given lightning etc) but I do not think UTXO count is a convincing alternative over, for example, unique addresses.

**Future of this regular post**
This is currently automatically posted every Monday morning. Would people prefer it in its own post, out of the daily thread (as per moonmath)?
[removed]
So how would a day trader (in bitcoin exchange with no short selling) make money from this??
Anyone know what a MACD coil means? Keep seeing this on twitter 
https://www.tradingview.com/x/aPu1aFnO/
I keep seeing the high ratio of shorts vs longs cited as a reason to be bullish. Sure, liquidating shorts would provide plently of firewood to drive this upwards. However, I also see the lack of new longs opening as a potential bad sign for the market. It seems many retail bulls switched to leveraged longing following the first major drop down to 6k (possibly because their stacks had dropped in relative USD size, or because they felt strongly that they should "buy the dip" at these "sale prices"). 

Regardless of the reason, a lack of longs opening may indicate that many of the retail loyal bulls are 1) tapped out/liquidated by the drop from the ATH long liquidation from 8.2k, or 2) don't have faith this will go up in the short-run. So, while whales will obviously try to take advantage of the outstanding shorts, I would venture that mid-term, this is a bad sign for the market because it isn't clear where buying pressure will come from now that retail Bitcoin moms and plumbers have left, and now the most loyal dip-buyers are not as enthused.
So in those unsafe times, let's do some more high level discussion and post nice trading quote favorites. I will start, here is my favorite from the Turtle Trader school Richard Dennis

>“I don’t think trading strategies are as vulnerable to not working if people know about them, as most traders believe. If what you are doing is right, it will work even if people have a general idea about it. I always say you could publish rules in a newspaper and no one would follow them. The key is consistency and discipline.”


This shows that regardless of what bot/system/strategy you have, if you do not have the confidence and gut feeling to ride out losses and let profits run, you will never make it. This shows a lot on reddit, like the classic post of someone shorting DASHBTC when everything points to the opposite. Or how the LTC fund with the Black-Scholes model I read about this week totally lost it all when Russia defaulted on it's bonds https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-Term_Capital_Management#Downturn

Those kind of thoughts together with behavioural finance has helped me improved a lot the last 3 months when trading

I went to green to quite red in seconds on my long. Thank god for SL.

Still got rekt. Goddamn, we are being played like 15 year old virgins here.
To those who say something is manipulation, how would you define manipulation and how would you tell it from "authentic"/organic/true buys and sells?
Long at 6657.

Closing probably around 6889.

Stop loss 6587.

Making a tighter and tighter pattern but for me this is purely gambling at this point

EDIT: Considering adjusting my target to 6795, based on a youtube video lol. (idk if we're allowed to shill youtebers?)
Some shorthand for why [I'd be somewhat cautious shorting here](https://www.tradingview.com/x/oj34fR2F/)

If we don't break the resistance line, then I'm expecting a precipitous drop... but with all shorter time frames oversold, it seems plausible there will be one more attempt, and if broken we can expect a reversal. 
The market is absolutely exhausted. I honestly believe we are near the bottom....maybe another 1000 usd dip at most. Volatility has dropped immensely. This is the most stable I've seen crypto be since early to mid 2017. People who wanted to sell have sold, panic sellers have sold. The only people left are exhausted people like myself who just don't give a fuck anymore and daytraders/whales. Once tax season is done globally (around mid march), selling pressure should drop significantly.

The 3k mega bears just won't get what they want.

I apologize to this sub for the times i shitpost but i get called out daily here by bulls everytime the price moves up $50. Im going to be civil from here on out. I can't put an end to my cruel sarcastic humor though, thats asking for too much.
This time it's different?? 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/sdD3qoOK/
Shoot wanted to close out the rest of my long from 6650 last night but decided to let it ride... Should have set a stop to lock in gains. Oh well, live and learn I guess. 
Guess what, I'm longing this. Target 6.9k

SL under 6500 if it doesnt bounce 


Good luck today traders
I think its important to note what happened the last two times the daily stoch RSI crossed down from overbought. This will likely happen in the next day or two

https://www.tradingview.com/x/lY7sB0TN/
I'm sorry but watching this forum in the last 2 days it's like fucking groundhog day.

The amount of 'the bear market is done' posts has been ridiculous. Do people not learn a thing??

We were nowhere near the end of the bear market, but no it was just full of Soros posts and big money coming in.

Very short memories in here. Why not wait for real tangible evidence of the reversal and end of the bear.


[deleted]
Anyone any idea why the bitcoin subreddit has 21k people currently viewing?

I watch them 'users here now' numbers a lot and usually we'll see bit of spike when the price makes a big change but never this much, not even close.
A bounce here is possible to continue working on this bear pennant 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/WAlBT4aV/
I want to know how [aabtc managed a 100+ BTC profit](https://www.bitmex.com/app/leaderboard), when his last verified position was a huge long that he "took profit" on in the $7ks for what seemed like only a modest amount.

Any BitMEX degenerates want to chime in with some thoughts?
The question remains. Is this whale or are these whales selling here as much as possible to bring the price then down to sub 6k or will they run out of coin supply before that? All other Top10 cryptos are holding better than BTC right now and BTC dominance dropped slightly, so I have the feeling the overall sentiment and willingness to sell at these prices is low, except of all this supply that comes from these bear whales holding lots of BTC.
Amazing how a smaller buy wall is standing still whilst a much bigger sell wall got chewed within minutes. Correct me if I am wrong, but isn't it another sign of reversal?
Damn that red candle, just as I was flipping more bullish.

The hardest thing I ever learned in trading was patience and delayed gratification. Then this happens and confirms why it needed to be learnt.
If we could just complete this inverted Bart Simpson right now, that would be great, OK?

Seriosly though, that $300 insta-drop earlier felt very manipulated. Right now there's a 1k BTC sell wall on Bitfinex keeping the price down. Was there similar walls right after the drop?
Someone was selling 500 contracts every 3 seconds on sept futs for 5 minutes.  Why would they do this?  https://imgur.com/xzN6hXl
Bears, what is your price target?

I'm asking because I'm hearing 6k, 5.4k, and 4.5k. First stop would be 6k, well when we get there are you closing position or buying back in? What's your plan? Is it really sensible the price will come down to 6k, if so why? For a meme double bottom? IMO, we're grinding down here and absorbing any sell pressure while stacking more and more shorts in the hopes of closing those shorts 6-700 bucks lower? 
So we got the higher low. Time for the lower high before the hammer drop. A lot of bottom shorters are going to get rekt on the way up first. 
friendly note to all mega bears, the last time the 30m RSI was this low we were at 6500 - not saying this isn't a failure, but if we recover from here and break 7.2k it would be a very strong indicator the short term bear trend is over.


LOL, r/Bitcoin [hating hard](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8b0v18/everyone_its_the_world_of_crypto_all_your_ta/) on TA, and even calling this sub out directly. They seem to think that any indicator/volume/chart analysis is just random guessing.  Probably just upset that most of them have gotten screwed buying the dip the last few months, while even the bulls here have made off much better.

We were rejected hard where the ascending channel met the mid term descending wedge we have been in since mid feb. Looking for the price to bounce from the 6.5k support we had held since november in the short term. If it doesn't hold with volume, sub 6k is likely.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/3eZsllXs/

edit: wedge not channel
https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/isQBDWIw-Important-area/

Still watching the corner of the this descending channel and the log support from the November 11th and February 6th lows. If we break down through the green line I do think there is a small chance we whipsaw back up to and start making new local highs and a pretty good chance we dont and just fall to 5k.


[removed]
I think this was needed to overcome the resistance at around 7.3.

~~10K+~~ 12K+ BTC sold in less than half an hour, if this is to go back up, we will require these same ~~10K+~~ 12K+ BTC to buy again.

EDIT: 12K+ 

Lets see where we end up.
Seeing as we never seem to go any lower than the 6550-6800 range does this suggest a bottom, or the more we try eventually it will crumble?
any holders from 20k still holding? I think your time to recover will be coming soon
The fact that we will probably have to wait 12-24h to see if 7200 breaks or ~~holds~~ is rejected is killing me rn.

EDIt: changed to proper phrasing

EDIT: OR NOT
Anyone have an info, how much BTC does one have to sell to dump it like that? I mean is 1k BTC enough, or you need more? Even less?
Gentlemen, how do you guys set your stop losses at bitmex? Let's say i'm long and wanted a stoploss at 6470. Do you prefer a market stop loss or a limit stop loss? If you prefer a limit stop: where do you set the limit? 6420 or is that too far from the stop trigger? Thanks in advance!
[removed]
interesting movement on bitfinex, quick upward movement followed by immediate selling, alot of back and forth
what do you guys recommend in terms of spotting volume spikes? manually setting up a large number of alerts for a bunch of different coins? 
So 2676 btc selling in a minute is not relevant? Why would a mod delete that post? Did you see the price drop it created?
anyone else seeing a hidden bearish divergence forming on the 4h and above?

A lot of indicators are pointing to this pump stopping soon (hidden bearish divergence, rising wedge, meeting the resistance) but on the other hand the buying pressure is sustained and looks organic. I must say I quite agree with [Swenlink here](https://twitter.com/SwenLink/status/982638735966855168?s=19), and I think /u/_chewtoy_  is short as well?

I will probably open a short around 7200 with a stop around 7300.

EDIT: grammar


So why do you guys/girls close your short at a loss?  
Is it because you are worried that it might run away at a big loss, or you just like to keep them short term and keep it tidy?

Thanks for any answers.
Technically if we stop right here its still a higher low but it's almost certainly another trap if we bounce. I can't imagine this higher low, lower high swinging can last much longer. 

The bottom will almost surely fall out right here or on the next lower high (6.9-7.1). 
Okay I've been bullish (at these lows) for a while and since people don't seem to realise it I'll highlight the most bullish case of all:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/yuD04UpW/

Price is actually still in its higher time-frame uptrend.

Now onto my 4th ever trade. Long from 6729 (5x ) with a small sum of money. First 3 trades ever I’m in the green for some profit. Not too shabby for a 1st time trader. Not going to let my confidence on these 3 trades allow me to make a bad decision though. 
/u/Trk- DID YOUR SHORT GET IN MATE?
It is very steep drop in one hour RSI https://i.imgur.com/Xnuv9IO.png
30% of my stack short from 7k after dcaing a lot.

was really hoping for 7.7k or a touch of 8k.

the bulls have become less deluded of late. 

but there is still hope. 
Bitmexico overloaded as usual. That idea about a ping bot creating fake orders to judge where the market will bounce or not is getting more and more tempting

My daily analysis looking at:

* Bitcoin's break downwards after bearish divergence
* Ethereum's strong break of resistance
* Bitcoin Cash as it climbs a bit higher
* Litecoin's bounce from support
* Monero as it moves back into its consolidation zone

https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@matthew-analysis/daily-crypto-analysis-9th-apr-technical-analysis
All in all, I've seen 12K + 2K just now BTC, totaling 14K sold today.

Please if anybody else is planning to sell, do it now and get over it!
Jumped back into my short at a few bucks lower. Still basically short from 7.1. 

I called for sub 6k within 2 days so I might as well trade my own calls without getting too greedy. 
I''m looking at the daily chart. From 3/30 to 4/6, closing price decreased from 6840 to 6610, while daily RSI increased from 30 to 33. Is that a bullish divergence?
A bearwhale has woken back up. /u/dushmankush called the BRD soon
I'm with Mike on this one (albeit with a more conservative target of 7k). Then it will be time for the Big short I think. Am I correct to assume that a symmetrical triangle is more often than not a continuation pattern? Thus we would go down to the bottom of the falling wedge and bounce (or meet our maker).

https://www.tradingview.com/x/6Qlmr282/

EDIT: grammar


[Fib retracements zoomed out to daily, using 9k on 3/24 as decline start point and 6.4k on 4/1 as decline end point.](https://i.imgur.com/sbDS5De.png)

First bounce failed to break through 38.2 line and second bounce failed to break through 23.6 line. I think we will have one more retrace before continuing downtrend, but I'd be surprised to see it get past 6.8k.
[removed]
I'm long from 6630 stops at 6540. Main reason is my TA tells to do so. Also a lot of shorts gave been opened here and RSI is low. And it looks to me like we are in a sideway wedge. Target is 7k but I'll probably take some profits at 6.9 ish.
[removed]
Is it only me who has the feeling this whole dropping would not happen without this one whale dumping his thousands of  coins?

Most likely it is from mining farms which fear to not realize these mining profits they made and do act only half\-rational because of this.
To me it looks like lots of selling but price doesn' t move down much.
[removed]
Oh man, had a new short open at about 7150 on swaps and got cold feet within an hour and closed it at BE!

The remainder of my sept long stopped out within profit.  Now have started averaging into a new sept long here at 6750.  Will probably add to it all the way down to 5k or so.
Does anybody have experience using the Bitfinex API? Their [documentation](https://bitfinex.readme.io/v2/reference#rest-public-ticker) is inconsistent with reality. For example,
> https://api.bitfinex.com/v2/ticker/tBTCUSD

should return 13 values with variable names (BID, ASK, ...), but all it does is return 10 values without description, whose types (int, float) are not what they should be.

edit: never mind, I already found it. v2 is in beta so using v1 instead solves everything.

Have been playing around with tradingview for the past hour testing some T.A line drawling and such just to try to comprehend the basics of it. I find it extremely difficult for me to learn it and I’m not sure why. On the 1D chart charted a falling wedge that we are near the top of and could potentially break out of. Is there a website or YouTuber anyone could recommend to learn the ropes of T.A? 

Edit: https://www.tradingview.com/chart/2fHwIr1l/ 

Here is what i charted on the one day. By the recent candle, it would have had to break 7193 to get out of the wedge. 
Was looking for some more confidence to leave my longs open and do not close yet for this tiny profit, here is some hopium. In 2014 this was the the point when the weekly RSI turned up.

[https://imgur.com/a/VkIvL](https://imgur.com/a/VkIvL)
There is some mad buying and selling going on finex. Feels good to the eyes to watch. 

As said yesterday about my strategy, I opened another long @ 6975 during the small dip in the range, not planning to close it anytime soon. :)
Bit of dump. Honestly as long as we manage to finally stay full day above 7k, this is making me relatively happy and optimistic. People really seems to have lot more trust of buying sub 7k coins, likewise the shorters will be more hesitant to bet on sub 6.5k coin soon. 
Eidt. Ooops, nevermind, premature. This is nasty :(
Just checked Delta and jumped out of bed. Pleased with myself for selling at around 7150 last night. The only scary thing now is I don't know if I should buy back in. I would expect a bounce... but now I'm scared haha. Feels like there's no TA to this - it's up to whatever the whales feel like doing. 

Edit: trying to break below 6.7 now. Let's see how this plays out?

So does this count as a higher low?
If I'm not mistaken, all the charts are currently forming an inverted hammer, with the one on the 30 min already done being formed. It's a bullish sign of possible reversal right?

If this follows the "normal" pattern of drop, bear flag, drop again for as many $ we might be seeing numbers below ~~8500~~ 6500 soon. 

Edit: I'm still holding on to my [short](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8afnvv/daily_discussion_saturday_april_07_2018/dwz3zyw/?context=3) despite going well above the stop.I think it's the most "in the red" I've been on a trade (7035->7200, 100 above where I should have stopped out).
We seem to be back inside the rising wedge from 9k - 7k5 no?
My line rests @6775 right now and that seems match exactly where it stopped now.
Anyone seeing the same?

Listen up. Soros, Rothschilds, and Rockefeller are involved in crypto. These are the families that put our world leaders in charge. Stop being bullish while the elite step in to accumulate. Good goyim, sell your crypto at a loss to your rulers. Answer me this, who created cryptocurrency? Satoshi Nakomto!?!?  Hahaha. It's called plausible deniability. At least pretend to be bearish while the rulers of this world accumulate crypto. Then, when all hope is lost, and they have their hooks in place, the news surrounding crypto will turn overwhelmingly positive, which it will. Only then, will the green light be given for the useless eaters to start buying, thus turning trillionare's and billionaires into gods amongst cattle.

Did you ever just mentally check out in 2014? If so, did it help? 

I'm kinda sick of monitoring my shit and may just allocate my fiat position, then check out for 6 - 12 months. It's money I am fine donating to the cause and feel too obsessed with buying back in at the bottom. Taking up too much time as is. 
fundamentals don't seem to be driving the technicals though. sadly :(
Wait, you have both "low sentiment" and "bull hype" back-to-back? Aren't these contradictory?

Ashamed to say I closed my $7079 short at a loss at $7129, this hurts. 
this guy fucks.

any reason you closed the entire thing?

do you see this going back above 7k after a lil cooldown here.?
After aabtc (&co ?) gave up this was almost a done deal with so many longs exposed and the TA, but you went against the short term trend at the time so damn well played.
You made what many people make in two years in 22 hours 😅 Nice work!

Nice. I had a short from $7,040 but but closed it way too early at $6,890. Kudos to you.
Gz
30-50k-ish profit? 
I admire your discipline, although its very probable the red candle will continue, you closed. Nice profit. 
Every bounce from the low/mid 6ks has been weaker, going back to the first in Febuary. If anything, I think that constantly retesting this support means we will break below pretty soon.

That being said, I converted a small percentage of my fiat position back into a few cryptos the other day on the chance that I am wrong. I will continue DCAing back in when/if we continue dropping over the coming months
Best of luck on your endeavors! I hope for the best in your life :)
> some decent sell pressure, but no bullish sentiment yet.

After weeks in which everyone and their mothers have been claiming with certainty that we're imminently go sub $4k or below, I think the way this market has maintained the range against selloffs pretty bullish. 

But even the accumulating bulls don't want to pay more than the minimum necessary for their desired BTC so they are stopping when price starts to go up significantly.

But this has to stop when pressure from one side subsides. I think we're approaching  to the exhaustion of the side that is actually limited in supply.
Why would people be liquidating now to pay taxes that were due estimated quarterly last year?  This is what I don’t understand about the “selling for tax purposes” argument.

While I don't want to question your position, yes we are very oversold but I want to be clear. You are expecting a full retrace of that last sell off?
$4M at 5% stop loss? Are you rich or reckless?

The June futures do look tempting for a long tbh. Might have to open both sides of the trade again with similar stops on the long to yours.

Even a miner will turn a profit at 4k price if you were hedged properly.


Very interesting. I did a quick scan of the numbers. Looking at % of national GDP this Venezuela volume is equivalent to $200 mil in USA. In reality USA does only $14 mil LBC weekly volume so that's indeed a huge difference. On the other hand, Russia has even more ($430 million equiv.), and Europe as a whole has only $16 million. This is probably because of availability of exchanges; in countries with no exchanges people resort to LBC.

That being said, most countries show a peak around December coinciding with the top of the mania/bull run, but Venezuela is making ATHs as we speak. So there's definitely something going on.
Thanks Josh, you’re always on point. It’s very interesting that you mention the OTC volume increasing while amateur daytraders are always talking about the low volume on exchanges to justify their bias.
How can you pretend to be connected to reality, and then accept a report of 'several asks for multi billion' dollar asks on OTC desks?

A few billion is all there is in crypto total. We know how much tether is out there, that covers Binance, Bittrex, Polo, OKex, Huobi, etc. You think Bitstamp, Kraken, Coinbase have multiple billions in fiat each?

Multiple people that hold 200,000+ coins decided a few days ago to flip them into the large pool of people who make billion dollar purchases. Seems consistent with how the world works/
re OTC volume, I've heard Canada is one of the places that new mines are looking to open up after the move out of China. I know of one person that is moving 700 s9s there but I don't know if they are active yet.. might explain larger localbitcoin volume in that area. 
The "insance OTC volume" claim in the article is only backed by a Twitter post, unverified rumors (their words) and [this NY times article](https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/04/02/business/02reuters-crypto-currencies-otc.html), which talks about high OTC volume in 2017, but not in 2018.

edit: I forgot the article also mentions LocalBitcoins as OTC volume, but they are also nowhere near 2017 volume.

"Bond vigilantes"
> they can essentially engineer movements in price that create income in terms of liquidations. When there are lots of overleveraged shorts, an exchange can pump the price with bots briefly and collect the short position. Same with longs but in reverse, a quick burst of selling pressure.

Some of the more moronic shit I've ever read.

If there are a lot of positions which are weak and easily closed, then any market will swing around and those weak positions will be forced out. Everyone betting short on the bottom, long on the top? You can bet those people will be forced to close.

If your position is weak and gets closed in the wash as similarly weak positions crash left and right, then don't blame the exchange with some bullshit about them trading against you.

Any exchange shitting on their own meal, is lead by functional retards. They print risk free money.
Not closing my long, this is just manipulation

Thank you, your reading is similar to mine, and like you I am also largely in cash currently. I personally have discarded that Peter Brandt post from my own thinking, as he got the volume profile wrong (see commentators in his thread)
>  Adam and Eve

What do you think about the lack luster volume after the "eve/double bott" seems like the volume is still going with the primary bear trend
What's high volume on OTC mean? What's OTC?
I wondered where you were. have a good one mate.
That's very cogent analysis. Bears and bulls evenly matched at this point. Difference is, the bulls have the luxury of time since longing is cheaper than shorting. I think you're right that we drift around between $6.5 and $7K for a while which is great because it gives more normal folks a chance to buy in before it takes off again. Does anyone really believe Bitcoin is going away? That would almost be delu... never mind.
Is that is precisely what futures were going to bring to the market?
due to the speculative nature of bitcoin, it can never bottom by not bouncing. there is no equilibrium between supply and demand as long as there is no true adoption. if it doesn't go up, it WILL go down again. there is no forming a 'base' Look at the charts from its inception. It is either up steady or down steady, with hard bounces. no consolidation can find bitcoin a bottom. 
I agree with you on the sentiment of someone propping the prices up.
I'm just waiting to see what happens here around this resistance/support. Bitfinex has a steady wall @6700 and there is a 1000 coin spoof sell wall blinking from time to time @6750 trying to push the price back to the wedge. 
> if the price pumps here we'll have 4k underwater shorts....That may be what some whales are thinking

I believe so. The outcome of yesterdays price action was to generate the same ratio (or better) of shorts again but this time at a higher price.

Stocking up on ammo for the squeeze to come later.
Shorts still increasing even at this low while long isn't increasing. This is getting scary. Either we drop big with another whale dump or recover again with a short squeeze.
Yo, how did you get the longs and shorts on the price graph, is it pine code or are you just superimposing 3 different tickers (only long/short I found on tradingview is bitfinex)

Edit: just wanted to add: nice analysis, gonna look into something like this see if I can do something with it ;)
In 24h your entry should be above resistance from drop from 11.8, so holding it to BE will probably end in switching to long ;)
Where are you shorting from again chew?
Did you short M18 or U18? The discount started to close last night but I woke up this morning and saw it opening up again. Seems like a pretty good sign to be the market was getting ready to go down.

Interestingly I am drawing inital targets up just around above the last 6k pivot. So there is a good chance for a bounce around there to form a possible fake double bottom. 
Interesting to see how this plays out, will mike's $4m Long play out better or will your short prove to be the winner? Personally I'm now inclined to follow mike now but I'll go do some magic TA first 
Can you please confirm if we are above the 9k-7k5 line on your charts? I have us right bellow and that line being resistance right now
One simply doesn't walk away at critical times. :)
Same thing happened. I refused to believe in the spoofing/manipulation for 16 hours, finally bought retrace at 7050 (because things didn't escalate), went for a shower after all day staring charts, come back to big red candle (no stoploss)

I am rebuying (part of) what I sold at 9k though, but market feels like a cheap P&D. Was in good profit on the random 6.6k pump, so sometimes you can be lucky as well. But market just feels so bad, wants to make me rage-quit (probably shouldn't) or just hodl.
Why walk away? You may miss an trade that you could make while in a zombie like crazed state, which are always the best trades you never regret 
Just that natural organic market movement at work. 
Yes absolutely. Just make sure it's on the same contract. 
Make sure to select 'reduce only' so it can only be used to reduce/close your position. AFAIK if you have more funds available to cover the long and you haven't selected it you'll end up opening a long and not closing the short. 
shorting after a $400 drop and clear whale manipulation going on the last few days, what could possibly go wrong
That's always positive for the bulls I'd say. The one thing to keep in mind though is that longs didn't naturally decline, they just went down during this steep decline.
Lol the more people want to short/the price to drop, the more likely it wont. This is a stop-hunting market and the market moves to the side that has either more longs or more shorts
The number is not important, ratio is important.
Well said. On the run up to 20k, at 13k there were 2.5x as many longs as shorts. Anybody shorting there based on that ratio would have gotten killed.
Yet in an illiquid market with decreasing volume the best way for whales to make money is not to try to chase 1X longs or LT holders that haven't sold at 6K but get bitmex to fomo into shorts, kickstart a pump, profit from the shorts closing and sell the top, no?
Interesting thing about short/long amounts is that they are also indicators of market sentiment. Every short also represents someone who doesn't want to buy, which is going to suppress the price. To me they are neutral indicators that can accelerate volatility in the case of squeezes like a few hours ago with the long squeeze, but I think people get too much a hard-on for some contrarian indicators.
> This sub is way too obsessed with shorts/longs

Well everyone did ignore it all the way from 16k to 20k to 6k. Now that the meaning is near gone everyone has their eagle eye on it.
> If I was smart I would've sold at that 11K bounce    

nothing to do with being "smart"; it has to do with the fact that you cannot predict the future


This comes off like one big sick brag and told you so, but you’re also 100% right, made some great calls, and have very rational perspective throughout - so I can’t even fault you. Nice job. 
we've also failed to make higher highs...7.5 -> 7.2
The current RSI on most lower time frames supports your sentiment. I think we'll retest 7000 before heading back down. The current descending trend line is going to intersect with the upward trend line from November which has been acting as support. We should know in a day or two whether this will continue to serve as support and break through the current down trend, or whether it fails to support and we continue downward. 
Until then, I'll be keeping my buys/sells small and watching the RSI on the smaller time frames to make trades.
wtf. 1% trading fee for maker and taker. what shit are they smoking?

Here is my quick story.  I thought I had lost the opportunity of a lifetime with the 08 market crash.  I tried my best to 'invest' during the crash, but basically walked away way too early and at a break even price.  I knew nothing of investing back then, and i set out afterward to learn.  It is a crime basic investing 101 isn't taught in school.

Many will tell you the bible of investing is Benjamin grahams 'intelligent investor'.  There is a lot of good, though dry as fuck, material in that book.  My big take away was this though.  Get comfortable estimating the value of something, put your money into it if the numbers work, then sit back and let the market swing.  If TA were so straight forward and accurate, everyone would be rich.  But, believing in TA is about as good as thinking the next roulette roll will be black because the last 5 have been red and it just can't go black again.  You never, NEVER, know when a whale will buy or sell unless you're the whale buying or selling.

I was down 40k or so years ago.  It was rough.  My emotions said to cut my losses and sell. 
 But, I had done the math and figured bitcoin was a $1T+ network, and held tight.  I'm currently down millions from the fall from 20k (up big overall).  But, I sleep like a baby because I know the market cap easily has 5x room for growth from here, and nothing, absolutely nothing else, holds that growth potential that I know of.  If you think bitcoin is a $1T+ network like I do (it really could go higher than 10T, I'm just being conservative by a whole order of magnitude), just know the market insanity will eventually fade and make today's loss look like a spec.

The trend is up. Take a break for a few months.
Bear market or Bull market crypto is here to stay. A financial advisor I know recommends to his clients to invest 2-5% of their portfolio in crypto. Some big institutional investors have recently been taking major interest in crypto and that’s only a small amount. Look how far crypto has come in the past 6 months alone. Crypto has conquered so much in such a short period of time just think about where it will stand 2 or 3 years down the road. Bear markets can’t last forever, they may last for what feels like a lifetime but at some point the tables have to turn. 
maybe familiarize yourself with shorting; it can take the edge off of just staring at falling prices 
Look back in time at all the past bitcoin "bubbles" did it recover?
There is no guarantee you will be up again. There is no guarantee you simply won't lose more money from here.

That being said, I can't say I wouldn't be just a bit surprised if you never got a chance at a better exit. But it's very possible. 

You invested without considering the possibility that you'd ever be down - this is a terrible way to invest. 

You didn't have an entry or exit plan and you basically hoped for the best. 

Learn from this. Don't just "hope" from here. Make a plan and stick to it. Would you rather:

lose $4000 but not anymore than that

or

possibly lose a lot more but potentially gain a lot more

???

This should give you an idea of what to do with your investment from here. 

Don't listen to any other advice- it's irrelevant. Price predictions (to you) should be meaningless and you should assume they're meant to confuse you and sway your opinion for personal gain.

The only thing you need to hear is that you need to make a plan and stick to it. 

Good luck, remember money isn't everything and you'll get it back. If you can't live without that money, take it out and don't come back until you have expendable income to invest.

You'll be aight. 
I lost around 300 BTC early on as a Bitcoin trader.  I have lost several million in USD value this year as well.  Nevertheless I am up millions of dollars overall (not counting crypto holdings, banked into USD).  I don't just buy, I do sell, but I will tell you a couple of things about my personal conviction which you may find helpful.

I have never felt better about the long term prospects of Bitcoin than I do right now.  The tech is revolutionary and in better shape than ever.  The regulatory environment is almost perfect right now for sustained adoption.  The CME futures launch is one of the most important and legitimizing things which has ever happened to Bitcoin.  It is very unlikely that the launch of that product will represent the all time high in Bitcoin price.  Price overshot and is correcting.  I don't know exactly when or where the correction will bottom, but for now the $6k bottom seems reasonable to me.

The money I made in Bitcoin, starting with a stack presumably smaller than yours now, was almost entirely from buying as the price went down hard and then holding, holding, holding.  This doesn't have to work forever and I think there is probably a 40% chance you could lose almost everything by holding Bitcoin.  That's a pretty big risk of losing it all and maybe it's higher or lower than that.  That's probably the lowest I have ever thought that risk was though.  I think you also have about a 40% chance of seeing 5x or more within a few years.  So I actually love the risk reward of holding right now.

If you aren't using leverage and you still think the reasons you bought and held this long are sound, don't sell because the price has gone down.  That is the opposite of what an investor should do.  This sub promotes very very very active trading, which can work well, but is not for most people.  If you have too much invested, such that a big drawdown will devastate you emotionally or financially, look to lighten your position.  If you get waaay ahead, take some profit off the table.  You may even decide to cut your loss some now if you are just in too deep.  No one really knows the short term direction for price and your mental health will be best served if you don't feel the need to check the price non stop because of your position size.

Good luck!
Exclusively BTC or other coins too?
I started with $1k over the summer. Eventually invested more than I should. Was down $3,800 at one point during the summer. Not chump change, but still a small amount in the grand scheme of things. I learned basic TA, took lots of notes on my trades, held and traded. Let's just say I'm not looking forward to writing the IRS this fat check on my 2017 gains and I fully expect to do it again this year. Remember this rotten feeling next time your in profit and take some off the table. 
You'l be fine dude. Everything happens for a reason. Remind yourself what is important in life.
Become one with the suffering, embrace it
dude dump that shit before you're down 8
RSI is still over 30 on longer time frames than 1hr. Somewhat oversold, but under 20 is a much firmer indication that short-term bottom is in.
It is, but it's not like it's a point value. Rsi can stay low for a while, just like it can ride high for a while. It's a generally positive sign, but doesn't mean anything specific. 
Also bitcoin doesnt go to <30 much on the daily
All other long term bull cycles started from a place of low vol and volatility ... so there's some merit to this in my mind. (also check post count here ... long periods of low post count is another anecdotal indicator)
I don't think the long-term downtrend will let up any time soon to allow for a significant climb.  We need to find a true bottom before going back up.
Maybe.

Maybe not. It'll be interesting to see how the new tax year affects the price (if at all).
Can confirm, my uber driver mentioned it today.
Haha I'm sure they are

Thanks for doing the peak one. The vertical gray lines mark the first of the month?
Shorts going higher without price going lower may be bullish. But the fear is still very strong and being manipulated by whale dumps.

On bitfinex 15m chart, it took a lot more volume to move down for this big red candle compared to the big candles earlier. There is stronger buying pressure than earlier, but what would the whales do? Cause more panic or accumulate?
While I agree with the idea, I wouldn't say this is December upside down.
We retraced 70% from ath when we hit 6k after 20k.
Let's assume your weighted average short is between on 5x and 10x margin, a ~20% increase in price is going to trigger many SL and liquidate a considerable amount of shorts. By then the Longs will skyrocket and this whole setup will flip.
Too many inexperienced margin traders around and the whales are loving it.
Here is another chart to look at showing recent short/long activity.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/KSTMCroU/

It does seem in the recent cases the bears have failed to hold the price down once they get in position. I wonder how many of these longs are simply USD unleveraged.
But the longs are even more delusional. Just 200 dollars pump and you see 4k BTC longs FOMO onto finex. This has happened so many times.
Of course it can't go on forever.  The price can't go below $0.
Exactly.


People put way too much weight into shorts vs longs on finex. If that was a reliable indicator, we'd all be billionaires by now. 
Want to post that link again with it zoomed out?? 

Edit: that chart displays a 10% rise.... Hardly parabolic
you can't go wrong with shorting until trend reverses. why fight it
100$ • 100x = $10000 to play with

$10000 = 1.4286 BTC (@7000$)

Now it goes to $5000

1.4286 BTC @ 5000 $ = 7142.9 $

You give this back and keep 10000 - 7142.9 = 2857.1 $

Every transaction must take into account fees and the time you were lent the leverage.

On a side note I would like to point out that if you are leveraging 100$ and this is the ONLY capital you have, if BTC goes above 7070$ (aprox) you get liquidated. Margin with large amounts of leverage requires bankroll.

Edit: spelling mistake

I hear Casio do good calculators
if you have to ask, you should absolutely not be trading on leverage, especially 100x. best case scenario you get liquidated a few times and stop doing it. worse case scenario you get lucky 3 or 4 times and then end up losing $10000 

just trade on spot or 1-2x for a while
Depends of your broker's spread
Basically it multiple your profit (or lose) by 100
just to rekt the longs, 3k were closed today.
Which log resistance? I am looking at 9k of you talk about the big down 
No volume /they can 
Don't think many of the more experienced traders pay much attention to anything below 1H.

I check 1H, 4H, and 15M in that order to confirm a change in position I'd like to make but put the least weight on 15M.  But I'm also not as experienced of a trader as some others here.
I've been working on some backtesting over the past day or so, using a similar strategy on both 15M and 4H timeframes.  The trade parameters are different between the two strategies (the 15M requires 3 conditions to be met, the 4H only one of three), but surprisingly, the backtest results are remarkably similar.  The biggest thing about 15M charts that I've struggled with is making sure that you have some sort of condition that makes sure that you are at least able to cover the fees, which can be difficult when smaller timeframes have so much "noise."
I prefer to use higher time frames to identify a potential trend, then use 15 min signals to pick me specific entry (if I have time to wait/watch).  

That's really all it should be used for imo.  These bear market runs are just as volatile as the bull market runs - some big market move can happen at any point and there's just not enough liquidity to counter it in the short term.  
When I am actively day trading I trade off of 1 minute bars. 

When I plan to hold BTC in a trade for more than a few minutes I enter using 1 hour bars and exit using 15minutes.
5m & 15m is one of the most reliable, ironically. the robots really respect that shit. When nothing is out of the ordinary, of course. When human traders are involved, it means nothing, so you should use caution. But yeah when things are quiet the 5/15 is amazing/
I look at 15 minute or shorter if I want to feel the thrill during high volatility periods. Fun to look at parabolic movement and chats groups or TS going nuts. 

But I've learnt to place my trades only as spread out orders (either across a price range or across a few hour time period)

That way, I'm smoothing out the curves and I'm impartial to orders that didn't trigger. 

if I want to sleep in peace, I either set trailing stops or just close all the positions before I go to bed.. 


This is what worked for me, but i wouldn't say I'm a experienced trader. 
It all depends what kind of trader you are.

Look for confluence between lower and higher timeframes and you should be able to get a decent entry/exit. 
I think as long as you are trading the trend 15min signals are trade able.  I mean really the key is to look at larger timeframes to figure out the trend and then enter your positions on the lower timeframes. 

 Last year if you tried to short when we had bearish divergences on the 15min you would have been rekt, but now they are pretty reliable
If you are trying to get very specific final timing on an entry or exit, or are watching the market momentum, there is use for 15 or 5 min.

TA is useless there though.
Nothing wrong with going against the market sentiment if you set the appropriate stops. Good luck.
Well, MikeXBT did open a long here... 
Short term long is smart play. Oversold hourly and bouncing off downward trendline and .786 retracement.

edit: doesn't mean we won't continue down trend later. I think we hit 6850-6900.
I closed my short and opened a long but not because of what people expect. Because shorts are at ATH and longs are quite low so what's gonna push the price further down? LT holders suddenly panicking, now? Benevolent whales market selling to offer free money to almost 36k shorts?

If shorts start to close and longs reopen this will be an epic candle, I'm going for that.
I went long on the 7th and just added to my position an hour ago - which is not something I'd normally do after this kind of drop. But the ATH short interest seems to me like it's just too juicy for Bitfinex to resist. I'm still expecting a squeeze.
[removed]
I sold because of taxes.  I know others who have as well.  I personally know of over 1000 coins sold among just a few people for tax purposes and that is a very small sample size.  Also exchanges may be selling profit collected in crypto in order to settle up on taxes which would be a significant amount.

I don't think that has been a primary driver, but it definitely is a real thing and it almost certainly has resulted in net selling.
My thoughts are: if it's posted on /r/cryptocurrency or /r/ethtrader, I immediately, and with heavy unwavering bias, dismiss it as worthless drivel. 
I completely sold out because of taxes. I thought I had a general idea of how much I owed but then when I actually sat down and used bitcoin.tax and cointracking, I realized how much I owed and how dangerously close being underwater after paying taxes if BTC went down another 3-4K. (I sold out at around $8200)

Good news is my interest in crypto is stronger than ever but now that I know I will have to give at least 1/3 of any gains I make back, I am being cautious, perhaps a bit too cautious.

Perhaps its not so much people selling to pay taxes that is contributing to the bear market but maybe the hesitancy of retail BTC investors like myself in getting back in after he/she initially sold, is not creating much buying pressure. 
(I did make over 1000 aggregate altcoin trades in 2017 so not sure if I am a retail investor)
"Tl;dr: The next major crypto bull run starts later this week. This is the moment the whales have been waiting for."

I stopped at this

Edit: Just to clarify.. the idea that "the next major bull run" will be starting next week is utterly ridiculous. 


I believe there are fools who probably had to sell some crypto to pay their tax bill. Do I think it's a big enough amount to impact the market? Hell no.

I'll huff the hopium he's peddling but if we do see a bull run start I doubt it's going to be this month, let alone this week. Love to be wrong, though.
Ignore all bull-fud like this. To say that tax season was a factor in the downtrend is one (probably false) assertion but this clown is proclaiming a bull run is imminent this week. As if people are going to dump disposable income en masse into a deflating bubble. 

Disregard completely except to note that we may still be in denial stages.  
They are waiting for the weak hands to dump their 0.1 btc.

This looks fucked, lower high, fake out then massive dumping from long closing.

Get as many hopium as you want, but I can sleep well with my 3x short for the next couple of days.
Right there with ya bud.
My reasoning is a few post down. Rising wedge + resistance line + hidden bearish divergence + fractal of january, and I think we'll visit the bottom of the 2 month long falling wedge (5400-6000) before going back up. 

Although an adam & eve bottom could very much be in play but price needs to break 11.7k to confirm. So if we go above 7300, bulls better bring this above 9k to break the 19k trend line and above 11.7k to reallly take us out of the woods.
The W bottom breakout price is at 11800. Anything less than that you are on speculative grounds
Too early to call the bottom - either we need the falling wedge to confirm with convincing volume or see some kind of a selling climax with a convincing bounce. So I wouldn't get too excited just yet...

I'm starting to think 6k wasn't the bottom but 6500 was and 6k was a panicked over reach. But the market has messed with our heads to date and it leaves everyone second guessing. Not a fan of the current price action but only out of suspicion.
I'll start believing a little bit if we break 7.3k
Honestly looking at the 1day chart it looks like we could have either one big leg up and confirm those double bottoms etc and hopefully test some levels we haven't seen in a while, or we could have an equally large drop and it will look the exact same as the countless other bull-traps we've seen lately.

That being said I'm currently holding onto my short and will probably exit around low 7000 and might open a long there if bitcoin doesnt take another shit.
If we convincingly break and hold $7.5k I'll start believing we may have seen the bottom in $6k-$6.5k. Until then I'm still saying we'll see lower prices, possibly as low as $3.5k. If $12k I'll believe in a new ATH.
Nah its another boat
he didn't say today but "this move", and also he would not be surprised to see a 2% bounce soon.


not chewy but my opinion: we touched the upper line of this month long falling wedge on [two occasions](https://www.tradingview.com/x/3Kd3XEFu/) and each time the line didn't break and the price plunged. Here the momentum that [the week long falling wedge](https://www.tradingview.com/x/eZTZnjPo/) gave us didn't even bring us to the resistance. There is just not enough buying pressure to break out of this wedge right now and as we're crusing in the 6k range, a big move down would take us to 5xxx.
Specific portion of comment in question:

“If there is ever going to be a drop below $6,000, this move is likely it.”

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8avoxb/comment/dx2bfzs?st=JFSGCMVX&sh=ca6274fd
The descending channel resistance is fairly rapidly declining. Any significant upward movement from this level would push through.

Conversely, I just don't see how another drop to $6,400 would hold.

Either way, we're closing in on decision time in my opinion.
This model is f.ked after hitting 1M limit.


So bearish?
U move to kraken or finex and short
Sell high, buy low? 
Never heard of a MACD coil but that graph is showing that the momentum (bullish and bearish) is dropping. The more tight it gets, the more heavy the move will be in either direction. It's very much like a long drawn out equilibrium price pattern. Take a look at Ethereum from june to november to see a good example (or Ripple). 

You should try to think about it as pressure building up over time. At some stage, the pressure becomes too much and it explodes. 
yes it means you follow the higher timeframe macd (which isn't triangulating)

Protip: that's not a coil, that's a failure to understand your indicator.
(not you op, not hating on you)
Macd is difference between 2 mas if price drops 70% you'd expect the mean difference or range to also drop 70%. So don't forget to take that 70% into account when attempting to spot divergences!

This is anecdotal but I've noticed that many spot market bulls who are now carrying bags seemed to be moving into leveraged longs at high margin at the dips in hope of catching the return of bull run bounce. They still seem to be convinced this is but a hiccup on a larger bull trend that will return any day now. As you say that trend may start wanning as these little bounces only get beat down and with a lower high each time.
Lol watch the longs raise like mad in real time if/once 6.8 is broken, just a bit of patience people have converted to swing trading lately
> This shows that regardless of what bot/system/strategy you have, if you do not have the confidence and gut feeling to ride out losses and let profits run, you will never make it. This shows a lot on reddit, like the classic post of someone shorting DASHBTC when everything points to the opposite. Or how the LTC fund with the Black-Scholes model I read about this week totally lost it all when Russia defaulted on it's bonds https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-Term_Capital_Management#Downturn
> 

This is so wrong it's laughable. 


You do realize that LTCM (not LTC fund, that's litecoin bro) got margin called out of this world right? They didn't "not have the confidence and gut feeling to ride out losses." They literally were so leveraged they almost collapsed the entire stock market in the late 90s. Every single investment bank except lehman and bear stearns got together and bailed them out. 

*In the first three weeks of September, LTCM's equity tumbled from $2.3 billion at the start of the month to just $400 million by September 25. With liabilities still over $100 billion, this translated to an effective leverage ratio of more than 250-to-1.*


They did exactly what their system said they should do. And they were literally crucified by it. They didn't lose all that money bc they were undisciplined regarding their system. They lost it because they got smoked by an old six sigma aka wut is kurtosis? 


I'm so monumentally confused with whatever vague and instagram-esque quote of the day flavor of this comment. Makes it ten times worse that it's just wrong. 
It reminds me of psychohistory from the Foundation series. 

In that story it took a psychic (the mule) to be able to to make a meaningful enough difference to pull the predictions off of the optimal track of their contingency plan. Though they did still keep the specific knowledge and plan secret to keep the original predictions as in-tact as possible. 

But the overall point is that only extreme outliers could invalidate their planning long term.  So I guess Asimov might agree with your point. 

Not sure how useful sci-fi is when discussing TA of course ;) Just found this interesting. 

It's true. To make any money you need patience and be emotionless
My thoughts exactly.

When BTC goes up a % most here shout (after the event), "this was expected it's clearly oversold"

When BTC goes down a % most here shout (after the event), "of course this was going to happen, we went up far too quickly, we're running out of steam, BTC was overbought"

It's pretty funny to observe, throw enough trading terminology borrowed from the financial world in, write 10 lines and post a link to a chart on trading view with a few lines drawn on it and away you go, up-voted to the universe and beyond.
Sell at resistances, buy at supports, apply suitable stops. Suck up the many limited losses, and ride the big winners.
never since random walk is an academic  theory without any proof and a way for people who have no trading skills to cherry pick trading failures and call out bad positions

also check out observer trader effect
If you consistently make money it's not gambling. Despite not having 100k in the market it doesnt change this fact.
Don’t trade it, that’s my take on it
Most obvious examples of manipulation:

- Low volume sideways followed by huge, high volume pumps or dumps within seconds
- huge buy- and sell-walls that get pulled last-minute (spoofing)
Long periods of sideways movement followed by massive red/green dildos on absolutely no news event. These red/green dildos are then followed by more sideway movement, then retrace back with a corresponding red/green dildo back to the level we came from originally.

This happening once or twice can be ignored as a statistical aboration. This happening over and over is likely manipulation, all the more believable because the majority of the traded supply is controlled by a tiny minority of people. Normal markets with organic buying and selling simply don't behave that way.
I would say manipulation is when you have the power to move the market price in the hopes of the market continuing the movement for psychological reasons so that said manipulator can profit from that
If money is involved it is manipulation.
Here I think it's a last leg down "manipulation", to incite fomo shorting and to incite longs to close at a loss, saw that quite often lately. The bounce is then even harder. Could be wrong ofc.
personally for me it's when moves are sustained and trends are established. 12k btc being bought or sold  in an hour represents a strong move to me but when there's no follow through I wonder if it's just being manipulated again because the market doesn't care to follow
Exchanges buying with backoffice/house accounts where no real USD are involved.

It's quite easy

Price goes up, 1-3% per day, and overcoming any FUD(look at sept-dec) = not manipulation

Price goes down, you can not HODDLLL(selling at price X before the next guy), market overracts to bad news = manipulation
who says bears dont go long amirite
I'd take some just under 6800, 6900, and leave a little in case for just under 7100.
Sideways through diagonal lines for me indicates an invalidation of the line, not a test of resistance

This is why I personally don't like diagonal lines nearly as much lately what with all of the sideways movement

if we rocket  through it then I agree, but if we measly meander on sideways through I wouldn't take much stock in it 
And people who sold, have sold to new people who will also have their selling point. There is no such thing as 'everybody has sold'. All bitcoin holders are potential sellers.
Everyone may be exhausted, but until new buyers can feel any confidence to invest we won't be moving up. 

How can they feel confident to invest? Well they need to be pretty sure that the bottom is in and more drops are unlikely. 

This doesn't feel like a market that's found a bottom to me. Feels more like a market hanging on by a thread, with no one but leveraged traders to incite any kind of market movement.
You create these wild, elaborate narratives to satisfy your fantasies.  The truth is that the chart says price is dropping and no reason to think it will not drop more.
lol I'll keep it simple without using too much technicals. The market does not really want to drop because it's going to be a total shitshow if it happens and many will really freak out. It's going to be swift and pretty violent. The slow ranging and lack of volatility is like how markets always act before big moves. It's pretty clear there is no buying going on because we don't bounce at all. The bullish hopium during the weekend really turned me on because I was scaling into a fat short the entire time, it's a classical example of MAXIMUM PAIN.

Our bounce went to the same exact place as many other bounces. The 60 period EMA on the 4H chart. On the weekly chart we are right above/on top/inside the 60 period EMA. We bounced at the same EMA at our low in february. In 2014 this same EMA also proved quite important because the price ranged on top of it for 3 weeks, eventually falling through and going from 480 to 150 in a couple of weeks. 

I don't think it will be as messed up as in 2014-2015, there is very little fundamental reason for anything like that. But the bottom really is not here. 





> The only people left are exhausted people like myself who just ~~don't~~ can't afford ~~give~~ a fuck 

FTFY


>it's quite possible that ETH will be driving this recovery

If you mean people selling alts to buy btc, then yes, I totally agree.
just cut the "heed my warning" stuff. other than that I crack up all the time at your stuff. It's fine to have haters, just don't take it too far- there has to be a slight subtlety to it or it gets overbearing (heh)

And mix in some actual seriousness (which you seem to be doing more lately) 

if you wanna go full shitpost fuck bulls then make a Twitter. I'd follow you for sure 
I can't be the only one which unconsciously associates you with u/BlackGayLibertarian

I'm being serious...
Your bearishness is always justified with TA or opinions imo. The ones that truly bother the subs are the "$50 drop - doom incoming" and trying to identify bull/bear flags in every movement type users 
can't wait to change your tag from "good bearish analysis but is often dickish" to "good bearish analysis but is dickish sometimes"
You are the shitposter we deserve, not the shitposter we want. 
You are only human, after all? For what it's worth, I enjoy the occasional shitpost.
You've been pretty obnoxious, though i enjoy many of your posts. I do have you tagged as "child," though. A more balanced approach would likely be rewarding to all involved.
I like u, you remind me of my old hero OracleSeven
I been giving you upvotes even disagreeing with you at times. 
>I can't put an end to my cruel sarcastic humor though, thats asking for too much.

We came for the gains and decentralized economy  but stayed for the trolling and the memes
I agree, bulls get a hard on for every $5 rise on no volume
Keep going with your TAs, I really enjoy reading and discussing it with you. No matter bulls or bears we are all here to take some profits and I appreciate everyone with their inputs
I do not see it?
Seems to have broken out, right ?
You close it or letting it ride at this point?
Your link isn't working but I imagine you are looking at something like this?

Man that daily chart is truly a sight 

Such a raw depiction of greed and euphoria and the subsequent reality check 
Two previous times had decent up trends, this last one was very choppy. So action itself is different than your two examples. Can you still assume it will act the same, ie. sell off? 
>This will likely happen    

what is the probability? TA people always seem to be saying : probably, likely, maybe, possibly, eventually,... 
not hating; if you make a prediction, give probability, otherwise it's literally non sensical; maybe Bitcoin is at 100.000 USD tomorrow
So many bulls declaring "bear market over" after each $250 pump means they are easy prey for bearwhales. Since our rejection from $11.7k this is probably the 20th time or so that bulls are getting fucked, yet they come back to get fucked time and time again.
Plenty of bears here also, let's not talk in absolutes. You have no fucking clue when bear market will/has ended.
So are you going to keep talking in absolutes till it's not. And keep egotistically posting 'you guys never learn'. Bear market has been going on for 3 months. I'm sure you're such a wizard and called the end of the bull market too.

Lambs to the slaughter. 
Might have something to do with last night's episode of silicon valley.

The joke last night was an obnoxious alert going off every time Bitcoin became unprofitable to mine. Naturally it went off about 2 dozen times throughout the episode.
Maybe they were hoping that this was the end.
This is feeling very similar to the lead up to the drop from 10k to 6k

aabtc has a 4 figure btc account. thats how. bitmex system literally wont let him do more than 4x for fear of bankruptcy 
it was a 19 million long from 6800's last week, maybe 2 weeks ago. i have a screen shot somewhere...


https://imgur.com/a/wqYNa it was 19mil long just under 7k on the 2nd.

after thinking about it, couldnt he go long on mex, then market buy thousands of coins on bfx, close longs on mex, open shorts on mex, market dump thousands on bfx rinse repeat
To get on this list will be on my new life goals
> I want to know how aabtc managed a 100+ BTC profit, when his last verified position was a huge long that he "took profit" on in the $7ks for what seemed like only a modest amount. Any BitMEX degenerates want to chime in with some thoughts?

Not sure about answer to your question but on a related note he market sold 3M contracts (think that was his long position) in 7100s and coincidentally, the dump triggered a few minutes later..
maybe he shorted futures or other coin
The metrics that show BTC is in an extended bear market are even worse for alts. BTC is massively up over any time period between 3 months and 7 days. Going sideways/down for 7 days doesn't make for a trend. Overall, the metrics you're talking about seem to be pointing to a retraction in the alt market cap that is substantially worse than what BTC has experienced. The last seven days are just noise on that scale.
Kinda yeah.. it indicates more Market Orders than Limit orders. that means people are getting a bit ansy and don't have confidence that price will drop enough to get filled.
Having done this before, it's because there are market making bots that monitor futures -- if you dump big, you'll get slippage. If you dump 500 at a time, the market making bots refill their orders and you have almost no slippage. There's more liquidity on futures than most people realize, you just have to be patient and move slowly, and not try to make your move when everyone else is rushing for the door.
Trying to ignite margin cascade? 
paint the incoming transaction flow with lots of small orders red
I'm neutral bearish with a view to seeing buy in points between 6100 and 6550. It could stop at 6500 or go to 6k. I'm not waiting for 6k to buy in though. It may never reach there.

If it goes below this I can't see it doing so for long.
People who trade size aren't going to post truthfully about where they intend to close and/or where their stops are placed.  If they want to close at $6,600 they would probably try to create a sub $6k or sub $5k narrative so that they will have liquidity to close into.  I do agree with your analysis though.... downside is feeling more and more limited and there is no question that the short interest is at an all time high on probably the most influential exchange.
I'm pretty neutral but I feel 4.8k would see a very satisfying bounce and convince most people that a proper bottom has been touched.
Isn't it kind of clear to you that the price won't be going below 6700? We have been steadily climbing up since the first major sell-off. 
I had originally targeted 4.7k, but I'm starting to think 2.5k and maybe lower is in play.
I'm looking for 4500 before significant bounces, 4100 lowest. The next round down prob will be 2900 in May/June. 
I'm starting to think its too obvious that it can't just happen lol
Up to where, do you believe?
short term bear trend? what timeframe?
I'm not sure why that means anything 
RSI at the end of last 3 big drops was 19, 24 and 20. So still room to go, even without a cooldown.
All indicator bets are off since February. (imho)
What will the price do tomorrow?

What's that? No one knows!?!? Break up or down? No one knows?!?!

Chasing win-rate is folly. Long-term successful traders which aren't simply examples of Survivorship Bias instead chase risk/reward. Something a chart can actually give you some idea of. Unlike *"What will the price do tomorrow?"* which is a question charts actually can not and do not answer, no matter how much gamblers believe they do.

The percentages to be gained are in *"upside vs downside"* not in *"will it go up or down"*.

Attempting to *predict* will churn your account into the ground.
They’re just salty because they can’t draw straight lines 
In fairness to some of them, if your only exposure to TA is [this jackass](https://www.tradingview.com/u/MagicPoopCannon/) you might have a low opinion of it too.
well it is kinda true, TA doesn't really do much in unregulated markets with such high volatility, what it does help you with is risk management
They're not wrong.  A single whale that is large enough can single handedly wreck any TA driven investment decision you make.  The best bet is always to hodl.  Everything else is just white collar gambling.

Ninja Edit:  You guys remember the Big Short?  Remember when Micheal Burry, Ben Rickert, Jared Vennett, and Mark Baum all used TA to make hundreds of millions off the housing market crash?  If only we could all draw lines like they could.

Or, value investing FTW

First thing I thought when I saw that red candle was of Mike.
1.2m is just 171BTC, so nope.
He posted his short position over a day ago iirc. If anything him closing his short not causing any movement should be cause for concern.
He closed it, and remember he said he only suppresses price with limit orders. So he had a buy wall at $7767 ish on bitmex for ~$1.2m 

So he's not going to move the market, he stifles it from going further. His short at ~$7050 clearly didn't stop it from going to $7170
No Problem. I do not look at 2 - 6 hours

Kraken 2kBTC wall is still on 6.45k, so I guess it's likely that it will hold.
Been watching this wedge too, I expect it to break upward hard eventually. It's pretty bullish long term imo.
To me, it's interesting that only 3k in buys right now is needed on bfx to put the price right back where it was.
Not necesarily if they went to the hands of long term holders.
I am definitely not one for conspiracies, but for all we know that rise to 7.1 (and fall) was orchestrated in part to attempt to erode confidence further and break this incredibly strong range. 

Whether it works or not is something else entirely. 

IMO, if buying continues to be strong at this level and we don't make lower lows there's only so long this can go on. 
When I say 'never' that isn't what I meant.  I mean we have hovered around here for a while.
Based on higher time frames, I think it's likely that we'll continue the downward trend over the coming weeks with a targeted bounce at ~4900. If we can break up from our current downward trend, it's possible we will retest the descending log resistance from January. However, there hasn't been much evidence that even if we do test that resistance, we will have enough bullish investment to break through. 

[Chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/yTAwRlhc/)

That being said, I think there will be opportunities to scalp trade for BTC accumulation between now and then. 
We will probably see this bear flag break up again, seems to be the norm lately 
17k here. 




About 98% of my time in crypto has been spent in a bear market. I’ve basically forgotten what bull looks like. So that could be the reason for my overwhelming bearishness, but I don’t see a recovery yet. Again though, I’m biased towards the bear. So I hope I’m wrong. 
holder from 900 lol.. buying more soon, this looks like the bounce back
transaction rate is dropping, adaption not increasing, regulation getting stricter, exchange volume dropping, still right in the middle of the bearish channel. but as long as you *think* it will go higher, i suppose it will!
give it several years it will bounce back.
> or holds

???
Volume at the moment is 6k coins on bitfinex
Look at the left y axis on bitcoinity for Bitfinex. it says 12.5k 
Limit stops pretty much never get filled when there is a big movement/ system overload.

Use a limit stop, but with a market stop behind it so you don't get screwed if there is a huge candle.

How do you conclude hidden bearish divergence on the 4hr?
You're not alone, my original plan was to short at rejection of the lower resistance of the 4 hour cloud, but we went into it so now I'm placing my wager at the clouds upper resistance rejecting any further upwards momentum (For those that don't know, the cloud is just moving averages to illustrate where resistance will likely be met). Of course, if the breakout comes with momentum that lasts for a couple of candles I will exit my short, but personally I believe any attempt at a breakout will be short-lived. I will place my short when momentum becomes clear, or, if the breakout appears to e legit, will take up a long position. Risk reward for shorting at 7200~ seems to good to pass up though.
isn't there a bigger falling wedge that has taken shape as a double bottom? seems it could go either way, if you assume volume is delayed 
Bearish divergence 15m to 1 hr, hidden bearish divergence 6hr, 12hr and daily and may be forming on the 4 hr
You will get your 7200 price soon. But I think shorting there is not wise. Let's see.
Fear that it might run away, which is why stop losses are great, you just set it up and watch, then if your stop is triggered at least you have the satisfaction that you did the smart thing even if you lost money
The trend is your friend.... until it isn't. As many people who longed at 19k found out the hard way. 

Remember the potential upside lose on a short is unlimited until you get liquidated. People could also close with a good expectation to short higher. 
Because "Take the loss" is actually a good trading maxim
Yes.
is below 6590 lower low? or is it 6550?
no freaking bounce at all on this huge drop...this does not look good..
Actually when you draw it that way it kinda looks like a massive (slightly sloppy) H&S
I think everybody realizes the potential double bottom around $6k. But first, we need 1): another leg down to retest 6k, 2): a solid bounce to confirm support at $6k, 3): a decisive breakout from the descending channel since $20k and from the falling wedge since $12k.

Personally, I'm hoping for this bullish scenario as well. But I think a breakdown from $6k, following a sizeable dead cat bounce, is equally likely right now. 
I hope this isn't going to be said every time we dump now

We were a bear market long before Soros
[removed]
Any justification for this one? Smack dab in the middle of a bear flag
If 6600 falls, I’d bail
I thought you longed yesterday 
noooo I was having lunch !!
Why on earth would you hold a long all the way to 6.4? 

The slightest hint of a lower low is going to unleash panic. You should be hauling ass out of any long if we go under 6.5. 

Edit; didn't read the username. I know you know what you're doing broski but damn, be careful. I'm nervous for you. 
Not very hidden.
yeah, looks like someone is opening around 1.5kBTC on shorts.
Is not even hidden,  currently 600 BTC to 6650 on BFX. 
It  DOES Look like it is getting weaker. We are one week away from US tax day. Possible we get another leg down.
I think that was the bottom tbh
What possible reason can it have to go to $5k if it stopped around $6k in February and in March/April?
A bearish post upvoted, that's a change. I also think we will visit the low 5k.
If you think 5K then why you do not short all you have!!??
I'm planning. Just have to wait two more days until my last btc is tax free. And boy that waiting sucks...
[removed]
[Yes.](https://snag.gy/TA0SW1.jpg) 
not an expert but I don't think you can disregard the lower low from the 3/30 to the 4/1
Tfw closed my long at almost the top at 7.1 and added to my short at 7175. 


I'm not really understanding where people are drawing that bottom line of the symmetrical triangle.  There's 1 point that touches that line.

I've got us [breaking down from an ascending wedge](https://www.tradingview.com/x/XFdi1iDj/) with little to no reason as to why we should see a bounce back from $6750 to $7000.  If buyers weren't willing to buy at $7200 and that is now the local resistance, what would compel buyers to buy at $6750 which has rarely ever served as a support?

I think we test the $6500's again and I'm not confident either way whether it will break or not.

EDIT: I just saw you were the one who posted the other symmetrical triangle down below.  So I guess it's not "people" but I'm not really understanding where you are drawing your bottom line from.
[removed]
> Main reason is my TA tells to do so.

Could you be more specific?
I got chopped like hell this weekend, staying on the sidelines for a while... A quick long should be safe to 6900 but i don't know...
Don't know if it's just one whale (doubt it), but it's obvious bearwhales are pushing every attempt at a breakout down. They're not even trying to hide it, I assume to instill fear in the last remaining bulls.
We just dumped 5% after a lower high, this isnt going to 3.50 overnight but how on earth is 5% not much of a downward move?
Look at the BFX orderbook to have your answer. When those walls are pulled movement will come
[6644.8,51.848043,6646.3,48.53325685,-369.1,-0.0526,6644.9,72696.35223212,7189,6635]

To me it looks like large longs closing and trying to avoid taker fees.

TheChartGuys, Jason Jenkins, A P, TraderCobb. (Youtube)
TheChartGuys are good, IMO. They do daily free videos, or offer courses as well. 
Interesting observation.  But searching for TA to support the narrative of an open position might be a warning sign ;)
You are better than me, still underwater 
Seems the bulls are pretty resilient this time. Hope it is not another trap.
Nice entry!
I'm short but staying over 6.8 would be optimistic too, there's no hard limit for bearishness/bullishness in this range imo, breaking 7.2 = short-med term bullish, breaking 6.4 = med-long term bearish as I see it

Edit : doesn't look good for bulls.
seems more like an elevator down
Mmmm looks pretty decent dump in terms of volume...imo
7k seems like an odd hill to die on. By all measures this is just an arbitrary middle ground between big lows and big highs. You could probably flip a coin for sub 6k vs above 8k next and it would be more accurate than any TA.
eat those words

Best thing to do then is probably lock in your profits and wait for a clearer picture to emerge.
Bearish divergences did the drop, lower time frames oversold now. There are no clear signals if we are going more down or we will cool off here. Wait for confirmations and take some profits
Not even a decent drop after all that shorts opened at the bottom. Not good.
The market is in a bear trend and will continue to bleed down.  Nothing crooked about except for the run up to 19k
Don't jinx it, I've buy orders to fill.
I wish you permabulls would wake up and smell the flowers. 

This bear market has completely shattered the bull confidence. There isn't going to be a massive push up to ATH. 

The way this shitshow will resolve itself, is through a multi-month consolidation period that will give people the confidence to open their longs and to keep them open instead of just selling at the first sign of a reversal.


>the probability is that it will be a long and smooth journey upwards

How..? How do you forget so quickly 


Also, order books fill up as the people expect the price to get there. They're thin because people aren't expecting a move up to there yet 
> Not many sell orders left in the order book at BFX.

Thats likely because, alot of the retail investors have already sold, and now we have sharp, quick movements at the hands of the 1% -- Thats how its been playing anyway. Today the "big move" was over in 10 minutes. 
Is this how it works? Whales make huge sell off and then puts out propaganda calling for a 45% crash to get fish to sell?
Log. Linear gets tons of fakeouts, log most often does not
I dunno man, i feel like you might wanna chill out with all your line drawing... not everything is always a trade-able formation. 

The more you look the more you'll find. Question is if it'll be helpful in anyway or just mislead you into creating your own story line.
This is the second time I've had to remove low effort contributions from you today. Please don't make me do that again.
Don't do this...it makes you look like the amateurs -_- 

Humility in making good calls will garner you much more respect than "heed my warnings plebs" 

You actually have a pretty decent ability to read the market.. if you reigned in your ego and didn't shitpost so much I wouldn't be surprised if people started actually taking your calls seriously lol 

but I mean if you just like shitposting then keep doing your thing (although I'm sure Jared will be all over Dat shit now) 

edit: and for what it's worth I'd actually say this drop is nullified if we bounce past ~$6950 here. 
some might refer to your “warning” as a shit-post

Maybe we go sub 6k, I doubt it tbh. But you deff. have no clue as to how or when
[deleted]
If it pops up instead of another leg down here, that would look pretty bullish to me.
[removed]
all those "bitcoin" or "coin" "news" outlets pretty much write everything with a permabull narrative lol. I mean obviously they write what their audience wants to hear. The same reason fox and cnn spin a story differently
[removed]
its been like 15 minutes. Literally.
if it goes back up from here yeah 
To be honest, I was being half-heartedly sarcastic.

I'm out of position for now because brain telling me it's just continuation of the bear trend until whenever. Heart hoping it was time to move up. :( 
yeah if it holds but 7175 is a lower high
If the hammer head is at the bottom, it's not a bullish sign. 
If anyone would offer it for the reason you reference, it would be Gemini, who really deal more with institutions than retail people. If could be that some of the institutions that bought in are now looking for a liquidation vector.  

There might also be demand for those looking to enter without moving the price. If this market was more bullish, I would think this could also be a primary reason.
the point is large US buyers looking to enter without moving the price up.

The gears are going, the wheels are turning

Large holders sold at 20k, they sold to dumb money on the way up.

Now they are looking to reenter wothout incoting a fomo riot
For every sell OTC there's a buy.
sooo.. the contrarian says long? ;) 
He's certainly not going to win any miss congeniality awards, but just because he's a bit of a dick to bullish people doesn't mean he should be banned. 

He does often provide useful and actionable analysis to support his, "bulls are retarded, bears will drop the hammer soon" comments.
At least provide some reasons...

I see a lot of people who deserved it more than him.

Show me your short, buddy. If it's so obvious you're gonna be rich in no time.
I agree but you're attitude is just really bad form mate.
if only it were so simple....
Pretty much how I see it. It's why I wonder is some (or more) bears here on that team?
6 (六, LIÙ) - LUCKY. The number 6 is generally considered to be lucky in China because 六 sounds like 流 (liú), which means "flow" in Chinese. Many businesses display the number 6 to bring good fortune. Unlike in western culture where 666 is associated with the devil, multiples of 6 is good in Chinese culture.

you're not gonna like what happens after 10k
Is it just because we're stalling there? So if it doesn't hold we're in trouble?
bounce?
Nice, did the same from 7118, got out 6800, let's see a bounce somewhere and get back in
I still can't believe that $7k prediction came true lmao you crack me up dude 
no bounce. the bull spirit is crushed by that red mega dildo
a black swan per definition no one feels or predicts. so if you worry it will not come :P
elaborate pls
thats a bit hasty, usually it does not do more than 10-12% a day and two such days in a row would be almost abnormal. but yes, i agree with the logic that going to 6500 for the fourth time will prbably mean it will not hold.

nice entry, my target was 7230 which never came. did manage to add loads at 7000 and 6900 tho so im pretty happy.
my dca works around to 7k now, (30% of my stack)

was really hoping for 7.5k to be honest.

could still happen.

mind you, am 10x so i usually play it really safe with my entries.


Knowing BTC, no, it's not safe. If only for five minutes value of 7201 ;)
7k5 was rejected, then 7k2. Old supports just keep turning into strong resistance. 
Your words....

When the exchanges sell off, its not because of strong hands selling. Those are not HODL'r coins that are being dumped. They're not dumping your bitcoin. They're selling coins from people with weak hands, and they're bringing those price drops to us. They're bringing fud. They're bringing red dildos. They're bringing barts. And some, I assume, just need a new yacht.

Mobile interface? Bitfinex has really great app which makes it better than bitmex which doesn't have any app.
I especially like how you don't circle some of the local lows with no large wick because it doesn't fit your narrative.
There have been plenty of bounces at local bottoms. The bounces at 8.3 to 9.9, 7.4 to 9.2 and even 6.4 to 7.5 were huge bounces and good possible candidates for the bottom. All are likely to have been massive bull traps. 

I think we have to stop looking for a Feb 6k type v spike event and start looking for consolidation and several weeks of sideways within a range as a better indicator. 

Sideways from 6.5-7.5 for a few weeks or even months would be a much more reliable bottom indicator. 
Some people here actually still think this is a correction in a huge bull market.
I would love to see the price if all traders leave and the volatility stops.  Of course, that will never happen.
Whether or not it is true doesn't change much- he is right that a correction will typically hit bottom before a new bull run can happen, he is right that it is good to buy in at what you perceive to be the bottom. 

He is also right that if you wish to support the currency, a good contribution is to avoid short term trading, to go long and to buy in more over time. If you believe bitcoin is the "real money", the best bet is to gather as much as you can and avoid risks. If instead you believe it is just a commodity to be traded and be profited on, your best bet is to hope to make some money in the wake of the whales. 

That said, most people (here that is) are motivated by short term gains and will go bearish; that would play into the hands of the cartel he imagines, and that mentality won't go away so whether bitcoin will survive manipulation, imagined or not, depends on whether it can first consistently survive the shortsighted trading of individual traders.

TL;DR; It doesn't matter if it is true or not- believer will hold, bears will bear, bulls will bull. Depending on category, you will likely act accordingly. 

Also I wouldn't call it a FUD piece, author is communication his/her vision of what is going on and suggestion how to counter if true. Then again, I'm a "believer" and will react accordingly... 
The demonstrated methodologies appear unconvincing to me.
Thats old news. And mostly false. While I'm sure there are people spreading fud to short the price and get in lower, they probably aren't manipulating the price with futures contracts.
Wow very informative, don't short the corn with the cartel!

Yes there is one known as siglo coin.
That's not how it works though. Your salary is denominated in dollars for business tax reporting purposes. The company issues the dollar value equivalent of Bitcoin every payday 
It takes time for the big boys (hedge funds banks etc) to accumulate. In the stock market it could take months after a crash for them to stock up. In the crypto world it will still take at least  a week or two of sustained low prices where the strong hands can accumulate. The feb 6th low lasted all of a day if that. 
What nonsense are you rambling on about
Bitcoin days destroyed
The only way to know that is to dump and see how far it goes.

Looking at price action I'd say that one of them is selling and other is buying and then they switch sides...
that article says nothing about him investing
> Even so, claiming Bitcoin is a bubble is perhaps the worst assessment of his career. In fact, it seems he did a complete 180-degree turn on cryptocurrencies altogether.

lol this article is bad

>For the time being, it seems Soros is quite happy with the way things are going for Bitcoin. With the big dip in place, it seems things may improve from here on out. He is not the first Wall Street mogul to invest in cryptocurrencies either. Alan Howard and the Rothschild family are taking very similar steps in this regard. It seems the interest in cryptocurrency is only growing, even among financial experts.

where does it even say Soros said about specifically about Bitcoin? This article is more speculative than all the gambling on bitmex
I find it amazing that someone who already owns $8 Billion finds the need to continue investing, especially at his age.

I don't know how to check out. IMO, this is a brand new kind of revolution. I'm less interested in the price being bullish and more interested in the process of price discovery. I don't think about my personal bottom line a lot. If I did this would be too stressful.

I bought all through 2014 and 2015.
Mark that down for the ~~bulls~~ bears. There are some people looking at the the transaction rate and the price that might disagree with you though. /u/_supert_ probably has something to say about this.
They both happen all the time. They seem about equal.

Reversing direction, going long.

Shorting at 7000 can easily have bled him the other way never to come back to 7000 to lose 2 years worth in 22 hours. I don't know how the OP wanted to boast a risky move.
>You had a stop at 4% and closed now at 4%? You always play with that R/R ratio? But GJ on the trade anyway. Myself, I will let my short open for now.

Varies from trade to trade. Resistance points are taken into consideration and so forth. 
>30-50k-ish profit? 

Closer to 50k, yes. 
Yes.. knocking on the door too many times in either direction is sometimes a good indicator that one will be let in.  So yeah if we linger here for another couple days we may see that capitulation event I mentioned in my post. 

I'm trading the day chart these days... I still think current price is a good long investment (6-18 months).  Given, this is a pretty long time horizon. 
Thanks for the kind words, I can say that I wish I spent less time watching the markets and more with family, but that time watching them has afforded me the financials so my father can go spend time with his sick brother before he passes. Conflicted to say the least.

Most of the crypto people were dumb and didnt even realize they needed to pay taxes when they switched between coins... they definitely were not paying quarterly.

Low effort content is explicitly against the rules. There are other subs for that kind of thing.
It does, you should see what automod has been dealing with.
IIRC, Chinese electricity is subsidized. Some guy had a blog post a little while back emphasizing the importance of the resultant arbitrage opportunity for bitcoin price.
One of the main factors is probably insane inflation of their local currency - Bolivar, Venezuela completely fucked up their monetary system and trying to get back on their feet. It's interesting that people are putting money in a quite volatile asset - BTC, and not in more stable asset/currency.
Tether represents only a fraction of money in crypto. 
If MACD, RSI, and OBV turn bull we avoid a BRD, head to my TP, retrace to OTE, and then to ATH. FTFY.
i thought you were half joking to some wall street meme first but it's an actual wikipedia article lol :D
>Any exchange shitting on their own meal, is lead by functional retards. They print risk free money.


Exactly, Bitmex takes 0.0500% on average per trade, and they currently have a volume of almost 3B usd per day.  To try to trade with themselves and the risk of an employee leaking that info is simply not worth the risk 
1h RSI is 25. Expect a technical bounce any minute
If you go back and look at every big drop we've had on 1 minute charts, all of them happened as a result of 1k (or more) BTC market sells. Likewise, some of the dumps were stopped by 1k+ BTC buy walls, and bounces started by 1k+ BTC market buys.

It's fairly clear there is heavy manipulation both up and down, but to what end it's anyone guess and really at this point I'd rather stay out of the way. I was very happy to buy in mid 6k's up until today, but this time I'm not buying. We've been in this range for too long, and the pattern of 'buy 6500, sell 7000' is too obvious to remain profitable for much longer, imo. 
Lets crash and burn together then. 
So am I!!
that's including bitmex, which a lot of it is massively leveraged volume. It's a good point, because lots of volume has moved to bitmex, but it's not necessarily accurate
Peter is basically wrong everytime what did he recently call 2k confirmed or 1k confirmed like 2 or 3 weeks ago. Moronic predictions. Anint nobody going to join his dumb ass classes.
The volume is usually higher on the left valley in a A & E double bottom. 
Over the counter, private btc sales not on exchanges 
If your the entire reasoning for your trade is hoping some whale risks significant capital to force a short squeeze in a extremely bearish market you are probably doing it wrong 
I find it hard to believe we would sell off that hard to just stop here. Yes we might (and should) retrace some of the selling but a full recovery on a dump like that would be something unseen since the bull run last year. 

I am looking for at least two waves downwards even if this is just a correction of a uptrend. If it is the resumption of a downtrend then you can expect three waves before any substantial recovery can take shape.

edit: Sorry I don't like to use the word believe makes it sound like I am just making shit up, here is my current chart model I am using. https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZE74ULIK/
Look for the BFXLS indicator of the public library, you can add it as a separate window like RSI. Then add BTCUSD compare symbol to its section and switch it to use the left axis.

I've made some small changes on the style of the BFXLS that is all.
or look here https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/xyfXyUlB-BTCUSD-Bitfinex-Longs-vs-Shorts/
I shorted from $7,100 last night. 
I shorted the June futures. 
But they were opened hundreds apart, both can be played for profit.  Not really worth comparing IMO.
Well, I certainly wouldn't recommend shorting here. I'd be a bit surprised if there weren't at least a 2% bounce in the not too distant future. 

But I feel very confident holding my short for now. If the market can crawl back above $7,100 then I'll close at breakeven. 
we should have a sidebetting option here in this sub (so meta to bet on which bet is the right bet!). i'd place my 2 cents on _chewtoy_ here, kinda hard to see this getting right back up again. but im probably biased by being short myself.
All these times are critical^TM
Ye man I think about cashing out and just quitting completely every day. I suck in this market the past few weeks. Makes me want to rip my hair out
bogged
Why would you buy into this bearish divergence lol?
https://www.tradingview.com/x/1xDqS5HT/
Got a customer call that lasted way longer than I thought and forgot to set a stop cus im an idiot
always 
Thanks for your help, much appreciated.
is it possible to open multiple contracts on Kraken and set up different stop losses for different contracts?
Is it any worse than buying after said "manipulation"?
I agree, but even then it's still not the greatest indicator and people treat it like a crystal ball 
Exactly...if we rocket up to $13k the ratio will be skewed yet again because a ton more longs will have opened low 
Not only on ratio. RSI was overbought very often yet we still went up, all the ascending wedges broke up, all flags were breaking up.

Now we have similar story but down...

On the bull run all the dips were bought, now all the bounces are sold.
Those who weren't surprised by the drop were those who were watching that ratio. They might not have been short early, but they also weren't FOMO longing the ATH.

Sure you *could* join the crowd and short here or lower, go for it. I'm counting on it.
sure, that'll work when we're chopping around I guess. When the market actually makes a large genuine move past $8k or below $6k I imagine it won't matter at all, especially since the amount of longs/shorts will be even more disproportionate then due to changes in price

It's just all confirmation bias right now. There's a reason we don't see many of the more seasoned traders opening positions based on number of open longs to shorts. It can certainly be a factor but it just seems like people think that's the #1 reason for any market movement lately...
I just think it's worrisome that this sub gets too attached to specific indicators/factors every few weeks. It just seems to me that people are desperate for any indication of an understanding of future market movements. 

It's almost all confirmation bias

I just can imagine a bunch of people are gonna get completely rekt when we actually finally make a big move and they're like "omg but...longs are at ATH!" 
> Every short also represents someone who doesn't want to buy

I'm buying spot and shorting with leverage essentially at the same time (close enough, they overlap). I'm sure I'm not the only one. Never heard of hedging?
I thought it was zesty! :-)

Full marks to the OP on calls and entertainment value.
Yes, and? There is no new all time high on longs. I've been making my macro calls on bitcoin largely based on shorts/longs the past 2 months and it's been stupidly successful so far. So much so that I really really really regret not holding my perfect shorts from each of the tops of each bull trap for longer (I am greedy and can't help but take the profits as soon as they appear)
Same bro, I am trading smaller range with small amount right now. 
I'd say it's more accurate to ask wtf the people who are still trading on there are smoking.
yeah, it's pretty riddic, and cuts into the bottom line for makers for sure. Alas, there is no other legit US market save GDAX, and fwiw: FUCK COINBASE.
It’s much less if you trade a lot. They are concerned with institutional money and not small time day traders. 
It's tiered
Thanks for the pep talk man. I really do believe it will get back up there and it is a t least a trillion dollar area, but 3 months of despair start to get to you. I will keep holding strong, thanks for comforting a stranger.
[deleted]
Thanks for taking the time to comfort a random stranger on the internet. You are a good man.
It is money I am able to lose, but I would have loved to buy my wife Lasik before we start having kids and finances arent as flexible. 

I definitely learned something. Don't expect certain things to never be able to happen. Take profits every once and a while, and recover your initial investment in a timely fashion instead of being greedy. 

If I do get a second chance I am taking my initial investment out ASAP. 
[deleted]
I became very interested in DBC when it first came out and put most of my stack into it. It isnt doing so hot right now, but it stabilized very well. It has a lot coming up and I'm hopeful, but its been difficult...
Thanks man. Thankfully my wife has been super supportive, but thats been whats tearing me up the most; the guilt. I really feel like I let her down and she even suggested pulling out near the top and I thought the bull run had at least a few more weeks left. I just want to at least break even. I was going to gift her LASIK for her birthday that was a couple weeks ago and it sucks to put it on hold. I do believe we will reverse eventually, but every now and then its like a devil on my shoulder and I just start feeling panicky and gross and today was harder than most. Thanks again for comforting a stranger.
Yeah there's a few other indicators but they're all someone neutral so it's hard to say. Basically what you said is what I'm thinking so we'll see.
It's very coincidental that the large bear wedge completes around US tax day. I'm guessing it doesn't affect the price much. Bitcoin does what it wants.
Look at btc open shorts 
He's saying the new excuse for any movement (especially downwards) is manipulation
Yes.  Here are the sources: [2014](https://bitcoincharts.com/charts/bitstampUSD#rg60zig6-hourzczsg2013-10-13zeg2015-01-14ztgSzm1g10zm2g25zi1gRSIzi2gMACDzi3gVolzv) vs [now](https://bitcoincharts.com/charts/bitstampUSD#rg60zig6-hourzczsg2017-09-12zeg2018-11-13ztgSzm1g10zm2g25zi1gRSIzi2gMACDzi3gVolzv).  Actually I had it set to 6 hour intervals here too.  I must have used a longer time frame for 2014 yesterday because it gave me an error saying too much data.
The potential short term gains are always going to be higher for a long than a short.

Bitcoin can only ever drop 100% from a short entry. But it can rise 1000%+ in a period of just a few months. 

If you short 1 btc at $7,000 the most you can ever stand to gain is $7,000. 

If you long 1 btc at $7,000 and the price rises to $70,000, you've netted $63,000. 

So it really should come as no surprise that buyers have itchy trigger fingers. 
> Of course it can't go on forever. The price can't go below $0.

See? This kind of hubris was last seen with the bulls when we marched through the mid 10Ks...
With bitcoin I wouldn't be so sure !
OR CAN IT , *vsause music starts playing
I'd love to, sure! Don't know whether you can change the x-resolution via the URL, though.

You can do it yourself, though: Click on the field right next to the "BTCUSDHC" in the top left corner, then select 1D, or whatever.

You'll find that shorts are ever increasing since mid feb, and at an ATH since the beginning of that site's records back in Sep.
Because you don't know when the trend reversed until well after the fact.
you leverage Lx:

* price moves 100/L% against you, you are liquidated
* price moves x% in your favor, you win L*x% of you initial investment
Do you only get liquidated at $7070? I thought it would be something like $7007 instead, or even lower. 

PS Not a trader
Ah yes, the old margin bamboozle
He is asking mathematics of leverage trading, doesn't mean he will use 100x leverage on his first trade. By understanding 100x he will understand everything else. I really don't understand why everyone has to be such a smartass when someone asks a simple question. You answer, or you don't, if you don't like it downvote it. 
It is only good for the whales if they wants to buy back the btc by causing panic, otherwise a slower distribution is more flavorable. Lets see if there will be another accumulation phase by the whales.
Bogdanov?
The downtrend connecting 11500 and 9000.
7200 is resistance for the steeper decline (from 11.7k as I recall), not from 19.2
I find similar, but shorter candle strategies for me also are more prone to over trading
Also nothing wrong with not making a trade
I'm also long at 6699

edit: not sure anyone cares what I do though lol
Dangerous to put too much faith into one guys opinions...
> Well, MikeXBT did open a long here...

But for 'a short term bounce' - without defining what short term meant. In a few hours? 10 minutes? 2 days? As it's not happened yet.


yeah I’m sure the guy who holds one of the largest positions in overstock.com (a big crypto proponent) wants to kill bitcoin. he also owns a bunch of Caesar’s entertainment where integration of crypto is all but a foregone conclusion. 

Edit: you can make arguments either way, the truth is we don’t know his fund’s intentions. 
I'm no fan of Soros, and I agree that he will short the market and Bitcoin will probably be kill... but $10? Dude. That's an exaggeration right?
If you know of 1k coins sold just between a few people then you and your friends are far from representative of the average Bitcoin holder. Retail buyers from 2017 are not selling their 0.5 BTC for a loss due to tax reasons.  
Yup, I am inclined to agree. The only thing r/cryptocurrency is good for is the occasional meme (most of which end up being stupid) and the occasional news story (most of which end up being false).
>7. Hasty Generalization
Hasty generalizations are general statements without sufficient evidence to support them. They are general claims too hastily made, hence they commit some sort of illicit assumption, stereotyping, unwarranted conclusion, overstatement, or exaggeration.



Which did you like better for alt coins bitcoin.tax or cointracking? I filed an extension (other reasons besides crypto too) and have to do that next week for my Binance trades. 

Im worried the actually cost of everything won't be exact to the time or maybe I don't want it to be haha. Did way too much day trading in December ugh, Any advice or something noteworthy you noticed when using those programs would be appreciated. Thanks.
I just can't believe it has so many upvotes. Like I thought there would be at least a few more level headed people over there but no: Almost 2/3 of people upvoted it.
Why is it foolish to sell crypto to pay tax bills? I would consider having to pay out of pocket to pay taxes on crypto gains to be a total failure. 
Thanks HSM
Thanks buddy.
as per usual... *sigh*
The model is fine with the 1M limit, but it can't account for batched or off-chain transactions. 
My most recent trade was buying in ~6800 (after getting stopped out after having bought in around ~6600), riding it up to 7150 and selling last night. So basically... sell high buy low :) 
I think you just explained a macd coil
All of the people I know that entered crypto last year and managed to get out in profit believe the same thing. Hiccup of a larger bull trend that will return any day now. So there is absolutely retail money on the sideline now. 

I am waiting to deploy my remaining capital once it bottoms out and gets boring (for weeks) and that is what I told them, but I have no idea if that is right. For all I know, Gemini is going to be taking OTC money in blocks from people who know about an ETF before we do. But that is the hopium version (less likely), of course.
relax man :D  That was exactly my point, they did not match the human judgement with the trading system they were using. They were so academic in their theories  that they did not have an exit plan for unlikely  black swan event. A trend following system only works until it doesn't and then you must cut your losses



Patience, yes, but emotionless? I hear this regularly but I disagree with it and I think that's also part of csaker's point. The worst period I've had was when I stuck with a strategy in spite of consistent losses with it. My emotions were screaming at me to stop but I kept plowing through because, well, back-tested it appeared to be effective.

I'm of the mind that trading has similarities to poker: you can't expect to be emotionless at the poker table. So instead you have to align with your emotions; you have to learn enough about who you are to know what moves are the right ones for your temperament. And once you have enough experience, you do have to learn to trust your gut some of the time; though admittedly, if you don't have much experience, most of the time you have to do the opposite.
There are plenty of posters here who make those same claims before the market action.

TA certainly won't help you predict when somebody is going to dump 12.5K coins on the market, but it can point out when conditions might be favorable for someone to make that play. 

RSI isn't magical. It's just a visual representation of market movement. RSI above 70 just means, "there's been a lot more upward movement than downward movement during x time period."

By no means does that guarantee that buying will stop. Or that selling will start. 

But what can be said about it is the following:

"When RSI is above 70 on x timeframe, buying *often* stops and selling *often* starts."

To use the gambling analogy, TA is effectively counting cards. It can point you to favorable conditions under which to place a large wager...but don't be upset or surprised if you get dealt 16 while the house gets blackjack. 
You wouldn't gamble, though, because you're different, you're a crypto "investor".
[deleted]
Look at an 1h chart and see when prices moves and not when RSI is above 70 and below 30, then rethink your comment
Used to do that, with losses. Probably personal, but trading mostly one way to follow the overarching trend is a way better strategy for me. 
Don't be long when red candle goes on...

It's not you can't trade, you just have to know your r/r. Risk on long above 7k was huge with 7.2 as downtrend resistance.
the fun fact is, that if any one of those 18 year old NEET "crypt investors" would have this amount of money, they would of course do the same. And livestream it on Twitch
Yes sir. I can still easily see this drop like a rock but dont mind trying to play a tiny swing.
I agree... but my experience has been that lines drawn over longer times frames, when broken, hold more 'potential energy' and thus price momentum responds accordingly.. I'd be surprised to see this 5 week long line break only to continue meandering sideways ...  I suppose we'll see (if it does in fact break).

Often I see lines challenged, but the breakout is weak or simply denied due to oversold conditions at the intersection and thus can't keep momentum (the double top at $11.7k was a great example of this).

What I'm pointing out here is that if this line is challenged and broken, there a lot of headroom on shorter term RSI scales for the break to move precipitously, and thus I would be mindful of this if entering a short position right now. 

In any case, I'm looking at $6500 breakdown for confirmation of continued downside, and breaking the line for a potential reversal to the upside.

Personally I would wait for confirmation of either before entering a trade right now.
generally more buyers come in not at the bottom but when shit is already going up. Smart money buys at the bottom and they buy silently. The masses will not be coming in until the price has already recovered substantially and that will come only with time.
I disagree. The charts show that somebody likes selling mass quantities of Bitcoin over very short periods of time, like this morning. All significant moves downward are fast and high-volume. I think it's either one whale or a small group of them working in concert to drive the price down. They're definitely not in it to make money because it would be much easier to drive the price up. A few billion seem to have been thrown at this project over the past few months. In January? Sure, weak hands were freaking out and selling. Now nobody's selling except the lonely group of aforementioned whales. If people were selling, these dumps would not be getting bought up the way they are. Now the only question is: did they borrow coins, and if so, when do they cover? 

[edit] There is no rational reason to sell Bitcoin at this point in time, and if you wanted to do so at any scale, you'd do so quietly so as to get the best price. You wouldn't do mass market sells.
The chart says nothing. You're drawing lines on the chart to fit your narrative. You're no different than the people who said btc is going to 50k when we were on our way to 20k because "Look at the chart". Keep waiting for 2.5k btc lol. Unless Tether collapses or significant mt.gox level fud occurs, I don't think we will see 2.5k.
The odd thing, though, is that the path of MAXIMUM PAIN now dwells on the side of the shorts, not buyers and hodlers.
Well I did say we could drop another 1000 USD....I am not saying this is the bottom...I am saying we're getting close.
> The market does not really want to drop

It just dropped $400 in minutes.  The chart says it does want to drop more.  That is the most probable outcome.  We will see in the next few days how that plays out.
I'll have you know I am still up 20x my original investment which was a substantial amount. I started back in June. I got into Antshares when it was just under 2 dollars and then WTC when it was under 2 dollars.
Yes I find Dush funny more often than not
Well we definitely dont need more top longing "i think ~~9.5~~ ~~9.2~~ ~~8.5~~ ~~7.2~~ 6.5 will hold "permabulls.

Let's help each other make money by staying sober about the market. 
Like you too bud. -Bear hug-
[deleted]
Hero? Your memories and my memories are not the same then, I recall that user got banned because of too many posts putting others down, whereas that isn't Dush's style...
Month long downward channel, many touch points, we're at the resistance... what's difficult to see about that? Not saying it won't break up from here, but I know what I think presents a nice r/r
As far as I can tell it's bounced of resistance (for the time being anyway)

https://www.tradingview.com/x/HqITxkLO/
Letting it ride since this market has been bizarre and we could randomly jump right back up.  Gonna set a SL around BE though since the main support seems to be around 6.7.
Yes, but tbh I'm getting a lil spooked by these non spoof sell wallslol, thinking about exiting at breakeven 
I always think traders using the word "greed" is like someone at a pizza restaurant stuffing two pieces of pizza in their face while pointing at some other guy trying to stuff FOUR pieces of pizza in his face and saying: "Look [munch glup] at that [munch slurp] greedy fucker!"
I’m saying the stoch RSI cross will likely happen in the next day or two. What happens to the price then is up in the air but I am showing what happened the last two times 
Nope I have simply said that until the trend is broken.. It's not over.

I know that may be a difficult concept for some but it's the truth. In fact that's all I've ever said.

We are in a bear market, we haven't broken the key resistance points. In fact we are weak against most of them.. Therefore it is perfectly acceptable to expect more downside.

Sorry that hurts but it's true 
All I know is that adoption is worse than in 2013 and interest is temporarily dead. Regulations are coming, bans are piling up, tether is still shady, and bitcoin competitors are being developed. 

It would be downright nonsensical if bitcoin didnt trade at 2-3k this year.
Some people are actually decent at predicting future movements though. Others are just blatantly awful 
[removed]
Report those posts and move along. We'll get it mopped up. I know it's frustrating, but we're getting it done.
Yeah I thought about that but not sure if it would attract so many viewers the next day. However three (!) shows indeed referenced bitcoin yesterday : Sillicon Valley, Billions and Homeland.
Hey Nomad! You know *way* more about this sort of stuff, so I appreciate your thoughts. What I'm trying to get at is this:

* We know (via trollbox) aabtc had a massive 19M long position from $6.8k/$6.9k. I think he also had 16M on his aabtc2 account.
* His profit went down from the 400's to the 300's at some point during the dumps, so maybe he closed a little of his long at a loss.
* He closed at least 3M, possibly more, around $7k+.
* ???
* Profit!

So, something doesn't add up. We can assume he has other accounts, and we can even imagine those accounts were massively short, but that still wouldn't explain how his main account, which was massively long and even taking losses at some point, managed to accrue 100+ BTC of profits. Did he close his entire long right after publishing it somehow (not easy to do under the radar with those kinds of amounts, obviously) and go massively short? Is there some other explanation that I'm missing?

I appreciate your thoughts, and those of others who watch this stuff more closely.
Yeah, funny business. But see my reply to Nomad, it's curious that he racked up a massive profit on an account that was, as far as we can tell, massively long and only went from $6.8k/$6.9k to $7k or $7.1k.
Thanks for the insight!

Edit: Though the bots seem to leaving quite a spread intact.  It feels less micro-botty on the futures.
Doesn't seem like the sept futures would be a useful place to do that, there are many spikes that just cause a really wide spread for just a moment without anyone coming in to actually close the gap in the book.  It's not the place to move the market.
Well that's why I noticed it.  Everything was red but the price wasn't moving.  It was surreal.
> People who trade size aren't going to post truthfully

I don't believe that one bit. Even if you're trading millions, posting your stops/targets will do next to nothing to affect the market as a whole. Maybe if your last name is Soros and you go on CNBC to talk about it, sure, that might change sentiment a little. But posting targets in a reddit sub, whether on a $10 or $10M trade? Come on.
Yes to me it’s clear which is why I’m looking to get answers from anyone bearish and understand their reasoning.
what's your timeline on that? 

Only if tether collapses 
too many new traders confident in their $6700 longs and $7100 shorts...

lots of people think this chop is free money but they'll probably lose it all on a big move. One of these times it's not gonna bounce back or dip back down 
Not too high. Maybe 6.85-6.9. 
unnecessary, comma.
3 months
It doesnt mean nothing by itself, but if this confirms : https://www.tradingview.com/x/ubVnMLww/ 

Then a break up could mean the end of the bear market. 

And oversold RSI is grounds to think that. 
Fully expected to see MPC before I even clicked the link.
The best best for most people is probably to HODL. But if you've been watching this market for some time you'd know to *at least* take profits. There's nothing wrong with selling over time as we reach new ATHs. It will *not* keep going up without bumps in the road and it is not rocket science nor weakness to capitalize on long term movements and protect your profits.
> The best bet is always to hodl.    

lol?

Thanks for the nice answers!
Yeah 100%. trying to time the reversal will be the hard part.
Exactly. My prediction is that selling will slow down in the next few hours, and the bullish trend will continue, this time with more buying pressure just like the way it dropped

Traders have already started buying 100+ BTC. Again, I could be wrong.
We could stay in this range for months if not longer. MM are in no rush to get out of this range as long as there is money to be made.
Wait. As long as you can. 
you should average down a little bit. more fun to sweat it that way
Insightful :-)
While this is a fair point, and I believe we are in a long term bear market right now, your indicators are not great predictors of price, aside from regulation.

In my opinion, these indicators are reactive to price.  If the price is increasing, it encourages adoption, transaction volume, and exchange volume.  The price movement and trend is what has attracted users.  The reality is that the majority of people aren't using Bitcoin for day to day transactions, and instead use it as an "investment".  So it's fair to assume that those indicators are down precisely because the price is bearish, not the other way around.
Where's the bot that says,
> You're not wrong, Walter. You're just an asshole.
Bitcoin years or human years?
I sense that you bought somewhere between 15k and 20k, are angry with yourself, and you’re venting.

So now we’ve established the fairly transparent reason behind the negativity, I’ll just say try not to worry - you’ll be back in the black in a few months. Probably within six months, maybe slightly longer. It won’t be several years.
holds as resistance
Hodls
Price has been steadily increasing all day... as usual
It's not formed yet but it seems it will be when the price reaches the resistance line : https://www.tradingview.com/x/CslGcLNa/

You can already see it on the 1d though: https://www.tradingview.com/x/fJGBXZfD/
Yes there is [indeed](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Xs4hsHey/) but I think we're in a fractal following price movement from [end of january](https://www.tradingview.com/x/6y4I91B6/). 

Of cours I'm not 100% confident, I might wait for a confirmation of a rejection of 7300 to short.

EDIT: a word
Then it plummets $1000 below your new long entry.
Whichever price was the low on bitfinex. The entire space is a ghost town but bfx still leads the way. 
With every lower high before getting dumped on, short term longing has less and less incentive
Anyone layering buys in the 6500 range? If we don't have at least a little bounce there, well...

Lot of sell orders in the 6700 range
yea it just makes me scared of how much farther it could drop.
No, that's what you think we need. 

What we need is for the uptrend to fail to make a newer high, the high of the double bottom is contained within the corrective move. To break that corrective move price first needs to fail to produce a new low so that's what price did.
The problem is when it was pumping people also commented Soros. Guess Sorors is more important then indicators which were screaming that drop is comming. 
they need a scapegoat...something to latch onto 
nah it's in bart's haircut
bear flags go up, not in flatline with shorts selling into big buyers like this (imo)
Stops at 6575 
I longed from 6919 and closed just above 7100. Then opened a short with 3x Lev at 7099 and closed that this morning at 6774. Longed again just now. Did pretty well with this chop 
Well shit, if it's any consolation your previous comment was a hell of a short term call. Let's see where this goes...
Good point, but currently I am experimenting with futures and their pricing and trying to learn how they is affected by swaps and spot pricing.

Therefore I keep this longer to wait and see where things end up. It's a quite small position with 5x leverage
[deleted]
If we clear 7300 I'll be right along with you, but indicators seem to favor a drop from a range around where we are now up to $7.25k
He do not know and write..... something.
Americans are sleeping haha
Because think is different than know. 
Would you explain this please?
[removed]
Lots of downvotes but there's some truth about what you say. But it won't crash to nothing, because people still want to play the ponzi everyone agrees to.
Numbers of shorts/long, RSI and volume, spoof walls lifted at opportune timings have been MUCH more reliable to trade on than formations and general TA lately.
I have [3 contact points](https://www.tradingview.com/x/sVW4P1aG/). Of course the third one is a little premature but it's a gamble that i'm also basing on [january fractals](https://www.tradingview.com/x/iljm4l6o/).
The dumping stopped on the uptrend line of the recent lows, intersecting the big falling wedge line. And that last drop was mainly caused by shorts being opened and big fake sell walls. Including other indicators like RSI and 6500 being strong support it seems like a good r/r. Tight stops incase it's just a bearflag.
Noob question, longs closing = drives the price down (Like shorts closing doing the opposite)?
I’ll check them out thank you 
I hope so too. However, even though I am bullish, I am still closing and reopening my longs based on the 3 hours trend. 

There is a lot of resistance around 7.3. I hope we can overcome it, and I am very positive. :)
Some people didn't believed me when I said yesterday that the coin will not go below the current range. It didn't :)

Do you have any open positions?
Yeah, crazy
Yeah, was posting at 7.05 before things accelerated obviously :)
Keep telling yourself that
But it's really not. It's just big dumps that seem to be instigated by one entity. If we're still sub-10K by June, then we can talk about bear trends. For now it just looks like one big player fighting the real trend. 
Red candles erased my memory. lol.

Anyhow, from 6800 till 7300, there are a total of 3385 BTC sell orders. From 7400 till 9100, there are a total of 3558 BTC sell orders.

>Also, order books fill up as the people expect the price to get there. They're thin because people aren't expecting a move up to there yet

That sounds a bit biased. How can the market absorb 15k coins on Finex alone and let the price drop only 500 USD, if people do not expect that the price is going up?
I guess you're right, I'm overdoing it a bit. Thanks for the feedback, I'll probably take a break.
I think he is a bit like me, you need to embrace volatility, shitposting and trolling and laugh about losses and rektosauruses to be able to have a clear mind in this market :p
He's got sass but no moneyyyyyyyy
because of "heed my warning"

Otherwise yes, I actually agree. Could be a lucky streak but he actually seems to have a pretty decent grasp on the market lately. 

Part of it may be that he makes 10 predictions a day lmao 
Lol he is wrong most of the time 
Also, they use Twitter as a source for every fucking thing. Some rando Twittered that OTC volume is high? CryptoNewsWeeklyNow is right on it, front page article titled "Wall Street entering crypto - for real this time"
[removed]
It's an inverted hammer, meaning people were trying to push the price down but buyers managed to push it back up to end the candle. Isn't the like a tweezer bottom? 
[deleted]
[removed]
Personally I think this can't really go on for longer period :)
I guess someone decided to close his big long. There is a big red candle on BTCUSDLONGS chart as well. Probably took the loss.

Dude you had 3 upvotes plus mine and 60 seconds later i refreshed your down to -1 LOL. go figure.
Sure, but the Chinese exchanges use the Yuan, so their prices aren't 6666.66
I didn’t realize China adopted the USD
People saying "but Yuan tho?" Have you considered that Chinese traders probabaly know what the USD price is anyway?

People will be looking for *any* excuse for bullishness right now. "Yeah but the USD price is lucky..."

I mean, BTC is already over 1 billion Phenobian wooden dollars...
Don't know about most people. I'm trading on bitfinex and have got a feel for this things now seing the spoofings and price action. Shorts rising too quick too, and bull div on the 15mn. I'm of the opinion this is set up for a short squeeze but we'll see.
??
Dude i got called out before the time expired. Bulls were euphoric, it was definitely a top indicator.
1hr rsi oversold, pretty good indicator lately. Praying for a bounce.
Nothing to elaborate on, he's talking purely about his feelings. So he's clairvoyant or full of it 
I appreciate what you did there.
Apple doesn’t let you trade most of the currencies, but you are right, for BTC trading I should be using the app. 
The bitmex site is only *barely* usable on mobile.
I think sideways here is quite possible. This rejection from 7.2k is clearly some big whales' dump to cause panic. It is really up to the whales' plan(s) where we would sideway.
I mean, it basically *has* been sideways for 10 days or so.  This range could continue for a while.
Your posts have really improved lately. Thanks for explaining your positions more.
[deleted]
*ding ding*

Like any employer would opt for paying you the other way, where they might have to pay you double/triple/quadruple what you're worth. 
Not for all.
Also the biggest boys use OTC trades which are typically done to minimize volatility so they wouldn't have caused the bounce by themselves
whales call this “market research” 
He is relying on trolling as marketing. A caricature of a fool.
Reviewing now. Please continue to report and downvote low effort comments. I depend on you guys to let me know about this stuff. We'll get it mopped up.

I'm with you pal, good luck! 
thanks for the pep talk here. Bought back into my full fiat position (no profits from the last run, just original investment) in BTC/ETH and a few Alt's that I am gambling on here. Has turned out rather well to say the least. 

Nice work as a mod as well, appreciate the active work!
Stronger hands than I. While I am terribly interested in the economics of it (less the tech, and more what the tech enables macro-economics wise), I probably have a lower risk tolerance than some in this sub due to family situations. Hmmmm. I should probably just stop looking at price, buy in at what I am comfortable losing and forget about timing the bottom, since I probably won't.  

Thanks and congrats on the promotion :)
Sometimes I wonder if the technicals drive the fundamentals. A la Soros reflexivity theory.
here I am happy to have made rent
I think you're right that this is a good price, and I would be incredibly surprised if we never broke 10k again. That being said I do believe I can get a better price.

I'm trying to use overall market health as a gauge rather than daily charts. I don't see the market going for a super bull run again until we see fundamentals improve significantly (dApps launching, more due diligence, scams going bankrupt/being less successful, etc.). As long as I see stuff like Dentacoin, Verge, etc. doing what they are doing, I know there will be a lot of sell pressure on the markets (these scams exist largely for a small few people to cash out fiat profits)



EDIT: I'll also add that I think we will break below 6k, but that a lot of what you said about oversold conditions still applies and that if we see 4ks I would expect to see a large bounce from there. It depends how long we chop around in 6k though. If we stay here long enough, we will see a lot of the technicals like RSI and EMA catch up and "reset"
People who think that is the case are ending up with a 25% penalty so maybe this idea has merit.  You pay estimated quarterly taxes if you owe over $1000.
Careful. There has also been many millions lost by the bold. I'm curious what your 1, 3 & 5 year returns have been. Are you beating buy and hold? 
>not sure if this applies, but in conventional stock markets 4m = $4k, 4mm = $4 million

I'm using M to mean Mega. Will clarify in the future. 
this was a strong drop and rejection from $7.2k again. It's very possible we continue to chop around but given the strength and swiftness of this move I am surprised to see him think we'll see $7100 again (at least so soon, or before a drop below 5%)
Such as?

I quite like this flavor of low effort content, as there is no shitcoin mixed in; and I believe everyone actually has skin in the game.

I don't expect anything to happen until 6550 or 6500. I'm on Binance and that's where buys of any significance are. Which I'd expect to be the same across most exchanges. (So yeah, soon).
Here here.
fair enough
THIS ^ i'm not a fan of derivatives I think they distort prices.
yeah but I thought post eve it was meant to increase to signal reversal O_o 
How would he know it has high volume then?
> If your the entire reasoning

You can put your head out the window to check the weather without also going for a walk.

Eventually there will be a reversal and it will involve a lot of shorts closing. Many of these positions will be held through profit and back into loss again as is common. Many of them will remain as rocket fuel for some point in the future.
Such extreme bartings are also unseen until recently. Clearly the market goes wherever the barting whales wants it to go.
This guy may be right about the exchange manipulating the price: https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8aymhw/how_and_why_exchanges_are_manipulating_the_price/
Awesome thanks mate!
What's your entry there? Weren't they at huge discount lately? I didn't follow charts yesterday...
Best of luck then, and kudos for you having the grit to hold onto a short when profit starts being lost at a rapid rate. Personally I knew I wouldn't have time to monitor the markets for that period of time so I exited my short at a slight loss, it's come to bite me in the ass painfully now. 
You can choose to close only a portion of your position with a stop loss if you want. At least, this is how it works on bitmex. Likewise, you can choose to limit close only a portion instead of the whole thing. 

I'm not more familiar with the Kraken UI because I use bitmex but I would assume Kraken shares these basic features. 
You can open multiple positions on kraken, but when you close, you close some of the volume based on which position was opened first.

So you can setup multiple closing orders with different stop losses, and decide how much volume you're closing in each order.

As far as I understand, not like Bitmex.
It's an indicator. RSI isn't the greatest also. If shorts and longs are the same then we know that market is undecided, it's like 50 on RSI even though they are at ATH. If longs are high and shorts are low then we have it like 70 RSI, there might be long squeeze and some dumping.

But yeah, saying that shorts gonna be squeezed just because they're at ATH is just BS.
Humans wanting to make sense out of the chaotic unknowable has been happening since we were talking out of our asses about the weather in the Bronze Age.
Fair, do you think you represent the herd? I imagine there are a lot of hodlers who are shorting but a relative small percentage are buying new coins and also shorting. I truly don't know though.
(that’s the opposite of greed) 
Where do you keep track of longs & shorts. bfxdata doesnt work for me :(
So basically longing when shorts are high and shorting when longs are high?
What's wrong with Kraken?
Why Gemini is ignored? I see ton of complaints about Coinbase/Gdax but why nobody talk about Gemini?
it is not, because you already pay the fees on the low tier. 1% of 6m is a whooping 60k. That's a lot of money not to move to another exchange.
Log scale + eye tricks.
> If I do get a second chance I am taking my initial investment out ASAP.

And that will probably be the moment when you lose the opportunity to make a profit after all this suffering.

This is a game of patience and timing. Maybe try not to FOMO down or up the next time.
I learned the same exact lesson, man. It's extremely disheartening because you feel like a total chump. Like "what the fuck was I thinking? how greedy could I be?"

but now you know how lottery winners lose all their money in a few years! 

I understand being disappointed with the lack of a gift for your wife. It sucks even more because you not only feel like a chump for yourself but for special people in your life.

I have a friend who could've really used the money I would've had if I sold at the top. When I lost it I felt like I had failed myself *and* her and I threw away money due to blind greed. 

Forgive yourself and let yourself learn from this. Don't *hope* for anything.

Now you value that money more because you've practically held it in your hands and subsequently lost it all. 

Move forward with that in mind. 

Good luck mate
XVG is wholly manipulated by their own team. When they had that huge development milestone miss with Wraith in November, they simply just stacked the order book on both sides with hundreds worth of BTC so the price couldn't move much. It was the craziest thing I've ever seen in crypto or alt trading, and barley had a blip on most peoples' radar. There is virtually no other coin where I've been like "this is a scam" besides Bitconnect, but I am 99% sure this is a scam. 
Ok, gotcha. Just skimmed the whitepaper. At one point I was holding some of the distributed computing coins/tokens myself - that model seems to have some similarities to what DBC is doing.

As to whether or not it will recover and then rule the AI computing market in a couple years, well, it's so tough to say. Same as any of the alts that are using tokens/coins in order to support a for-profit business as opposed to strictly acting as a store of value. It's pretty much an unproven model and the whole market got ahead of itself. We just don't know right now. It's a gamble.

My thought is this. What is there of substance in this pain that you are experiencing as a result of these trades you have made? I don't mean by this what some people might, like, oh, valuable lesson in this, don't do it again. You know that's BS that doesn't serve you. You are already punishing yourself, otherwise you wouldn't care about this. Also keep in mind that much of what defines the gains and losses in crypto at this point is timing and luck - most of the people here don't have any idea where all this is going either, they've just convinced themselves they do as they've had a certain amount of gains and decent timing to this point.

So if you can look beyond the whole 'lesson' thing - how is this being of service to you? Where will it lead you? Is it a call to action, or not? What do *you* really want to do now, understanding that no one can tell you for sure what will happen to these holdings of yours in the future?
I don't think he was being sarcastic.
If the longs are looking for huge % gain they would be hodlers and wouldn't be squeezed so easily with this drop.
> If you short 1 btc at $7,000 the most you can ever stand to gain is $7,000.

Not if you add to your position as it shows profit.
Except if it goes down 25%, it has to go back up by 33% to break even.
I chuckled, happy cake day :)
You'll also see a correlating decrease in the price of said asset over the same time period
Technically speaking you would get margin called at the exchange would lower your position a little bit earlier (not sure how much lower but let's say 7050s as ballpark). This is in case of flash crash you don't get gigantically fucked and end up owing more money than you have. Check out calculations for 7070$:

1.4286 @ 7000$ is 10000

PriceToGetLiq * 1.4286 = 10100 $ (this includes your capital)

If we solve equation it should give 7070. Once again this move would be really stupid if you use all your capital. In a matter of minutes you would be liquidated. Never trade whole stack. Always have some capital back up. I personally never trade more than 3x and I've been fucked many many times mate.

Edit: spelling
can't say I really care too much, plus he already got the answers from other people. Tired of people here basically not warning people that this is essentially gambling if you're new to trading.

I've seen too many people losing money on leverage to really care about being polite about it. People losing literally millions to hundreds of millions of dollars because no one ever told them they should be careful with leverage. 

Would rather him think I'm a dick than him lose $10000 because he got addicted to going 100x


yes, this I agree on. wrote about  it yesterday  https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8anmvt/daily_discussion_sunday_april_08_2018/dx1fvbv/

and for now that 7200 was rejected quite hard
I think it depends on the exchange.  If you're backtesting with a lower volume exchange with larger spreads, a random rise or drop can really throw things off.
always interesting to hear other people’s positions, bud ;)
I suspect that he'll do whatever he needs to do to make money without emotional attachment
Yeah, I agree.  I don't know how much has happened, but I am talking about a small sample of smallish whales.

I thought the $25B number used on CNBC was probably too high.  I don't think it has been the primary driver for selling.  I do think it has accounted for some of the selling.  I mostly just think it's been a technical correction in a longer term bull market.  Bitcoin has done this quite a few times as you know.  This is the most severe correction I have seen in such a positive news environment.  It could be some of the reasons for that are seasonal selling related to taxes, ICOs cashing in, Gox selling, etc.  Not that those things created the pullback on their own, but that resulted in some of the extra selling perhaps taking us deeper than we would otherwise expect.
I think bitcoin.tax is more user friendly than cointracking. I got similar numbers but I decided use cointracking because it gave me better numbers for 2017 and this year. I already put money aside for my 2018 taxes. 

Also you won't find this helpful but since I made a lot of money pretty much gambling (I made money by pure intuition and dumb luck) I didn't give much thought in going over every single trade and seeing if the numbers matched up. 

One word of advice is download all of your trades from every exchange and get yourself organized (Binance was a pain in the ass since you can only download 3 months at a time) before you start the drag and drop process of uploading your trades into the software. I initially downloaded as I went and messed up because I lost track and was disorganized.

Good luck. I guarantee you will see investing (especially crypto to crypto daytrading) totally different once you see how much taxes you owe. 
You know upvotes don't mean "I agree" it just means "I think this is a quality post". It's a fun hopeful post with alot of information.

I don't agree with the conclusion, but that's fine.
Mostly because I was being an ass, but in small part because people should probably have been responsible and planned for their tax liabilities in advance.

I don't know why planning for and paying your taxes with money set aside makes you a failure, but whatever.
I'm not your buddy guy.

Just kidding, I am, I just couldn't resist the opportunity to make a South Park reference.
It should be uptated to output count even then it can't provide layer 2 txs.
That is the precise opposite of what you said in the original comment. :-/
Well-said, chew. I think it speaks volumes that your accuracy since last summer has been about 57%, but your ROI is over 250%. TA will be wrong a lot of the time, but with good risk management it will be right just enough to make money.

I think one of the keys is to use multiple indicators and remember you don't always have to be in a position. If the RSI is 80 on multiple timeframes, we're right below an important resistance level, and we're near the top of a rising wedge, then that's a great opportunity to short. Sure, you *might* be wrong, but it's a really good r/r.
The counting cards analogy is nice. I'll remember that one. 


with a 8k hd camera and an own youtube channel and a cool intro tune 
I like to be amused by human folly mostly, and learn what not to do and what logical fallacies to avoid when investing in crypto.  
This. I haven't been buying the supposed supports because I'm not going to bet against the macro bear trend.
so is a short down here tbh
I should live stream my insane rambling about the market to twitch, thanks
That makes sense, and I agree. I personally believe shorting below $7k is still pretty risky, although at some point it may prove fairly profitable. At this rate it's a pretty big gamble though
i.e. when they are confident a bottom has been found.
Ya that dump was manipulation at its finest but I won't cry about it cuz thats the crypto game.   But its pretty interesting it didnt cause a huge panic, it basically dropped like a rock out of nowhere and just took a hit to the chin and kept going.    The buy volume doesnt seem there to get excited but interesting that manipulation usually just works in very short-term timeframes and gets back to where it should be, whether thats up pr down. 
> The charts show that somebody likes selling mass quantities of Bitcoin over very short periods of time

We can agree to disagree on what the chart shows.  I would say it shows quite a bit beyond that.

> . I think it's either one whale or a small group of them working in concert to drive the price down.

Yeah, no shit.  That's the same reason the price went to $20K.  It's called MANIPULATION.

> They're definitely not in it to make money because it would be much easier to drive the price up.

You are beyond confused.

> Now nobody's selling except the lonely group of aforementioned whales.

Will let that statement speak for itself in its level of absurdity and pure delusion.

> There is no rational reason to sell Bitcoin at this point in time,

You sound like a great trader.  For me, and call me crazy, but if I think it's over 50% likely the price will be significantly lower tomorrow than right now, it is rational to sell Bitcoin at this point in time.  But again, call me crazy and you clearly have it all figured out.
> The chart says nothing.

I'll just let that sit out there.  Your desperate level of delusion speaks volumes.
Max pain is on the long side as we will likely see in the near future with increasingly delusional and angry posts in this sub.  It's already begun.
Why is that? If you don't go 10x leverage (or above) you can't be liquidated at all. We never go up very much. The average degenerate gambler on Bitmex is not going to move the market anyway. 

It's actually very bearish that so many people want to short because that means they are not planning to buy. 
Yeah, I mean drop below these levels (6400-6600). A 400 dollar drop in such a short time on increased bear volume should make it clear what's going to happen next. 
I was joking. I'm still mega up too hehe
I think he got reincarnated as dushman
Yeah I personally don't like the scalp longs in situations like this (although r/r is not bad with a tight stop loss), I will however gladly add to my 7k short at 6.9k if it gets back there 
It's not a competition, we're all greedy. This entire space is driven almost entirely by greed. I have no illusions that I'm not (or at least wasn't) as greedy as anyone else here. 

I was and continue to be a part of it all and if you called me greedy I'd freely admit it

I just think the chart is truly a spectacle of human emotion, primarily greed and euphoria. 

I am a point on that chart in ~October, around $8.2k, and I will go down in the history books as a participant in one of the biggest bubbles in history :D
I'm sure there were key points on the way up too. TA works till it doesn't. 
I've been going over Tradingview for like 2 months and nobody is accurate twice in a row. They're all so cocky too. Especially Magic. Its all BS.
exactly, I was surprised when Bobby talked about turning commissions into cryptocurrency
To clarify and TL;DR, it's not surprising that he lost a dozen BTC profit or maybe then gained a dozen BTC profit...it's how he managed 100+ BTC profit on an account that was publicly hugely long, when the price only went up a little above his entry and then spiked way down. That 100+ BTC profit was only posted recently. That could be done with a huge short opened at $7k+ and closed down here (but then, how did he flip such a massive position without anyone being the wiser?)...or otherwise there's a huge lag with the leaderboard? I don't think that's it, because it's updated fairly often, right?
I see. I'm not familiar with contracts or Bitmex, call me naive. 
I can tell you for sure that there are some market makers on some of these exchanges who have access to the information on stop orders anyway.  I don't think they need to peruse these message boards.  But yeah I don't think people trading $10M positions will accurately post their stops or profit targets and I don't think they will post much at all until after taking a position.

Also, for what it's worth, almost all of the people I know who trade multi million dollar positions (which isn't even that large in the grand scheme of things) don't have just one stop level or take profit target.  You almost have to scale into and out of those positions, so you are adding and taking off in a lot of places.

And as far as sentiment, what I am saying is that if anything large size needs people on the other side.  Most big traders don't like to lie (some seem to love that aspect of "the game"), but they also don't like to hurt themselves, so they simply don't post on boards like this since honest posting does not serve them well.  They may post afterward or post at times they aren't in a big position.  There are a few legit traders of meaningful size who post here occasionally, but I haven't seen anyone like that who is successful and trades significant volume giving the blow by blow here.
Sounds good to me, I agree. My only theory is the otc buys are to avoid the market regaining confidence with big buys so they can short and crash everything while there is fear in the water. 
If tether collapses I'm looking for 1800 at least
True, but there is no buying at all right now, and plenty of people ready to sell into any rally after each one continues to get crushed. Would be harder to short squeeze then just dump below support and let it free fall here imo
Just let em fill my shorts one more time bro 😜
that's what stop losses are for.
Nope.
I gotta disagree 7.2 would be a strong indicator that the bear market is over as we won't have tested any of the log resistances from 20k until we get to ~7.8
one day these people will be definitively proven wrong and it'll be glorious to watch the cult die 
people were giving me shit  for saying the low volume slow climb is bearish lmao it's like they watch the charts 24/7 for no reason. if you don't learn anything from it why watch them obsessively 
[removed]
Yeah that's what I'm doing. I have finally set up an Electrum wallet and stored it on a flashdrive to hold my Bitcoin on from now on. It's not the most secure, I know, but I have no viruses, I always scan.
Oh don't get me wrong, I've been doing that. Throughout the last 3 months, I've been one of the biggest 'buy the dip!' people you can imagine. I was lucky enough to catch the bottom at 6k on Feb 5, just by chance, as well, so it paid off.


So right now I'm about 40% down instead of 60% down.
So why would the price go up in the first place then? Just belief?
You already replied with that to one of my other comments some days ago. If you don't have anything to contribute, then perhaps don't?
I think Bitcoin may be developed by a dog named Satoshi, it would explain why it moves 7 times faster LOL
 
What negativity? After the 2013 bubble crash it took bitcoin several years to recover and for people to gain confidence back he isn't venting or angry just posting a perfectly reasonable scenario that might or might not play out again.

This is unlike your random claim that it's going to go up 300% in 6 months because you say so.
Yes thank you. That's not how you say it?
Yes, that’s correct. Thank you for your cooperation. Please move along.

Yeah I saw that on the 1d chart, I'm long from $6700 on gdax, sadly I can't short, if this doesn't get passed $7500 then the bears will be back in control. 
-Satisfied grin knowing I did the right thing while watching my money evaporate-
looks like below 6500..
I'm waiting for someone to photoshop Soros' head onto a bear and it will become the new meme. 
seems fine unless we take the elevator down
Nice man 
thanks man!
Early february? Bounce then consolidation back to the mean. Just making the argument - personally very cautious about this being the consolidation floor.
There is nothing "usual" about Bitcoin. Throw away the text books and TA. Long the corn and don't look back.
The bottom of $200 after rally to $1,300 had a triple bottom similar to this one.
In Germany your btc gains are after 366 days tax free. And even if we are at/close to the bottom I do not expect a new bull run in the next month. 
[removed]
I would agree and I don't really make decisions solely off formations.  I moreso draw different renditions to see what could be possible and then use other indicators to tell me which price movement is more likely.
Yeah I see it pretty much the same, though I don't have that intersection happening yet.

I'm long with CA 6658, but I think I'm not going to have stops and might add to this all the way down to 5k or so.
yes 
Yes, to close a long you need to sell BTC.
people say stuff here all the time based on their "feelings". It turns out to be right sometimes.
Nope, I’m on the sidelines at the moment.
Orders way above actual price are set by people who leave them to get filled some day, when we get there bots take over and slowly fill the books as we go. If there's violent movement then bots are off and wait for stabilization in the range.
Yeah, the way these big dumps are being bought up is the most bullish signal I've seen in about four months.
No idea how you could possibly paint my message as biased. It's true both ways.

and I'm confused...that's *precisely how* the market absorbed those sells. they expected a possible large move down. 

I have literally never seen the market move upwards and downwards solely due to a thin order book unless the market has already just dumped (or melted upwards) and order books are extremely thin due to it. 

The dump we saw wasn't a Dump Day type dump. it was just a normal move down. If it was going to move up due to thin order books, it already would have. those types of bounces happen very quickly

Did you notice the 2k btc sell wall at $7.2k last night? And now it's gone? That's because people moved those limit sells down lower
I love his stuff, but "heed my warning" is obnoxious when I see bulls do it so I have to call him out or I am a hypocrite. 

Plus it's low effort trolling and not funny. I prefer stuff like

"re shorting the bounce cause higher low, new paradigm etc" 

that actually makes me laugh 😂
Would not a broken record have been as accurate? The real test is whether he calls the end of the bear market correctly.
Yeah its retarded, tbh I am bearish mostly but i do think its a possibility that some wall street money is entering now. More than it was before. Obviously they werent going to enter during near the top but there is a distinct possibility we are near the bottom.
I think you just described a regular hammer.
If they incite FOMO too quickly, they may lose a chance to accumulate at a more attractive price range.
Exactly. The only time you wouldn't do this is when the market is super bullish and you are worried about slippage.
If you're looking to buy, say, 100,000 BTC, you absolutely need to suppress the price and take your time accumulating. Yes, you'd incite fomo and increase prices of the Bitcoin you did buy if you went through exchanges and just bought bought bought, but you'd end up in a situation where after your orders are done, there simply isn't enough buyer interest or liquidity to sustain the continued push forward -- and the price would go back down much faster than it went up if you started selling. 
Yes you're right. People twist logic to absurd degrees in order to validate bullish biases. 
I mean the real point is to avoid slippage both positive & negative, but yeah I know what you mean. 
> Really the whole point of OTC in crypto is to avoid having the trade be seen in public.

No, it's really not.
OTC trades are not at discount, it's a false idea.
Its been painful. For Sure. Not a biggie, just pushed back my 5 year gap-year a-little bit :) 
It def happened instantly 
Did you just out your own sock-puppetry?
Actually bitmex site is nice for mobile, I don't like to use it through mobile because of login, entering pass, 2FA and very fast session expire is frustrating.
Late 2015 bear season went sideways for months before breaking out. If the way to make money now is to short 7k and long 6.5 then I got no problems with that. 
I was referring to your user name.
Any american company would be required to set a dollar based salary for withholding and taxes. So yeah thats the norm. 
OTC market makers, whales and institutions can colude. 
What I want to know is...who would sell tens of thousands of bitcoin OTC to a large institution? Obviously they are buying in at a heavily discounted price because they did their homework and it's a good investment/r:r.
lol well if you guys don't mind then whatevs. I think we should hold our trolls to a higher standard though. he isn't even funny about it 
[removed]
You got it.
Psyc * 

A psych is a psych major 
Really glad to hear that's working out for you. The market is outperforming my expectations, which is a thing Bitcoin does a lot. Anyway, I think and hope this will work out well for you over next 5 -10 years.

DCA and walk away. That was how I got through 2014 and 2015. I was broke AF. New wife in grad school. Just bought a small amount every week and ignored the bottom line. I put in every extra penny. It's a 10 year investment, minimum.
I generally agree... $5k - $3k BTC seems very plausible this year...but not in a straight line of course.  In terms of alts, I'm expecting more bleed out once BTC breaks the long term resistance from $20k as has happened in other cycles. 

One of the other metrics I'm looking at is overall market cap which I think will probably hit ~$150B before the next bull cycle.  We're about $100B away currently.

But yeah... we're not out of the bear market yet.  I'm suggesting, however, that we may see a short term price reversal that has the potential to bring price back to ~$8k range in the coming month.
I owed over $10k this year. My total penalty was like $200. *shrugs*
I think that you are using the terms correctly k=1000, M=1000000. "4m=$4k" seems horribly wrong. 
I agree with that, but I won't be surprised if we bounce up to 7k, and that's still nice profit.
We just went to 7500 in 2 days, amazing how short people were. 
Go to /r/ethtrader or /r/CryptoCurrency for shitposting and come here to post and read market analysis and commentary that requires more thought. This sub isn't going to give it to you both ways.

The most fun part is that it's always a bit implied that "if not X would happen on the market, ME is the one who would make all the money instead" :D
> I'm on Binance and that's where buys of any significance are. 

Well what is controlling the movement now is the 600 BTC walls on Bitfinex surpressing the price, appearing and disappearing up and down 10$ range https://i.imgur.com/wze4lhK.png
> I'm on Binance and that's where buys of any significance are. 

What? Bitfinex, BitMEX, OKCoin, etc. etc. etc.

Absolutely, I just dont believe it will be here
I do admit some of the recent price action is strange however I mitigate some of this by trading the higher timeframes there possible, they can only change the price for so long before the market fights back. Their is *always* a bigger fish.

I try to avoid these kinds of things as it often clouds my technical judgement. To me the Bart Formations look like one 'whale' buying a lot of coins in an attempt to induce some buying but the state of the market means there is little follow through at higher prices. The barts show me the ineffectivness of whales to move the market in a prolonged way.

When the longs/shorts I have found data showing the number of shorts that are only hedged, but I have found no data so far on what longs are hedged usd in the margin account. It would be perfectly reasonable for people to have exchanged sold btc -> usd, transfer this usd to use as margin and then margin long btc at 1x. This would kept them default short which is preferred in a bear market. The BTCUSDLONG could be including these in its ticker and it would appear longs are at aths but really its just people going 1x as they were before but now you see them on the ticker.
upvote for the phrase “extreme bartings” 
The discount actually narrowed considerably during the pump from $6,600 to $7,200. I managed to enter around $7,040. 
they actually closed the discount a bit on the way up so he made a little extra on shorting there.


Thats what I thought, thank you.
Yeah it's fine to use it as an extra indicator. But people are justifying entire movements on it alone 
of course so I think it's prudent to encourage people to put a bit more thought into their analysis. "because longs were opening" is really a terrible justification for opening a short and vice versa 
> Fair, do you think you represent the herd?

I have no idea - in some ways probably, in others not so much. I've used Bitcoin on and off since Silk Road 1 days but only started accumulating seriously a year ago. I'm still in accumulation mode overall while trying to swing trade some to increase my holdings, and I have more disposable income than most to throw at it. My overall cost basis - not counting trading profit/loss - is still solidly under $5k, and I've bought very little BTC over $8500 and none over $13k. I also have not sold any BTC, and don't intend to for at least 2 more years but probably 5+ (I do short trade though).
Its a type of greed... I see money and I say give it to me now. But with more patience instead of a desire to see more money in account right away, I could have made way more. But I see what you are saying.
serach longs and shorts on tradingview

its not the only factor, and its all relative. but yeah it kinda works out like that usually
it's not nearly as profitable as everyone thinks lol
It sounds like they have improved a bit as of late, but historically, they haven't had a great reputation for having a trading engine "that works".

Maybe it is time to give them a second chance.
gemini has it's issues for sure, but they handle their entire operation in a _far_ more professional manner.

I left Coinbase/GDAX forever when they decided to lock me out of my account for a surprise KYC shakedown on the weekend when I had orders open. Super amateur hour shit.

They run their financial institution like a "fail fast" tech start up.



[deleted]
Yeah I more meant take out my profit when hte next bull run is petering out you know? put in a stop loss sort of thing. If it goes on another bull run and then drops like 20% of that runs ATH, take out my initial investment and play with whatever profit is left.

Is that a bad idea?
Leverage man.
Exactly my point :)
Alright thanks for the explanation mate! 
This rejection is artificial though. Some whales dump really hard suddenly. We cannot predict much from this movement without knowing the whales' plan.
If you're using cointracking, APIs make this A LOT easier.
That's fair.
Ok well we're on the same page. What I meant about paying out of pocket is that I was implying that people made profits but didn't plan in advance and ended up losing all their gains and now have to pay taxes out of pocket.  
> It should be uptated to output count even then it can't provide layer 2 txs.

Also, I've not seen evidence that batching is a significant effect, and have seen evidence otherwise. See my previous posts.
it was more to get the nice quotes going, this is the daily after all. i mean as long as your system act within limits use it, otherwise get out. not one or the other
My ROI is actually much higher now than when I ran those numbers. I've locked in ~$3,000 per btc in gains shorting since $10,300 and the value of btc has dropped about 30% since then. 

I'm closer to 400%, give or take. 

If btc drops to $3,000 I'd be at around 1000% vs buy and hold. And about 3000% at $1,000. 
Yup, 6.8 is too risky for a fresh short, ~7.1 was good r/r for short, ~6.5 was good r/r for long. You can go long if we drop more from here with stops below 6.4, but this time risk will be higher, we're consequently rejected from 7k, so there's big possibility we'll drop further this time.
Downvoted for use of the word "delusion" which is insulting and so cliche that it makes me think it could be a calculated talking point. (I know how PR works.)
You'll make a lot of friends over at /r/Buttcoin, maybe you should head over there?
You just validated that the path of maximum pain would be the price rising ("so many people want to short" - exactly) and putting all of these shorts underwater.

EDIT: Did you ever think that maybe the whales are dropping the price like this just to suck in more shorts?
You point being what? You disagree we are in a bear market? There are always key points.. On the way up we broke them.

We aren't breaking them now, hence the continued downtrend 
There are a few here that have been right several times in a row. And being right isn't as important as how right you are and how much you put on the line.

I was wrong about the top from $10k about 4 times on the way up to $11.7k.

The second time around I put down my biggest position I've ever had at around $11.4k. added more on the way down and now we're here

MPC is a total moron. Most tradingview people are. There's a few good Twitter traders and a few good traders here, mainly chewy, fuckharvey, and mikexbt who just started posting.

Joyrider5 is actually another great one as well but he doesn't post much lately
Totally agree about the maker point and the scaling in point. And I'll meet you halfway on the sentiment point, it's probably wise to wait until after you've taken your position to start being chatty about it...but on the other hand, it's not like selling will suddenly subside and asks will fly off the books if someone posts here optimistically about how they're going to make a major buy.

And I know for sure there are at least a couple of folks among the Crypto Chads here making seven-figure moves on a regular basis. One of them is forthright about his position sizes, which I personally think is reckless; that's one of those things that should be left unsaid when working at this level.

> Most big traders don't like to lie (some seem to love that aspect of "the game")

Can you expound on this a bit if you can? I'm curious.
Good luck looking 
agreed.  tether collapsing would be catastrophic for btc price.
both are about equally likely at this point, although right now dumping looks slightly more likely simply due to proximity 
...said the confident $7,100 shorter. :)
We're still hating on hodlers here? I mean, sure, /r/Bitcoin is cult-like way too often. But nothing wrong with hodling, in traditional markets buy-and-hold is a time-honored strategy. This is /r/BitcoinMarkets, not /r/BitcoinDegenerateYOLO100XGamblers (even though sometimes we act like it).

Hating on hodling because now isn't the best time for it is like hating on index funds during a down year. It's not foolproof and you do get drawdowns, but it's still the most lucrative strategy of the past nine years of Bitcoin, unless you're a 0.01% trader savant or something.
Why do you trade Bitcoin if you hate it so much? Sounds like a very emotion-driven thing for you, and that usually doesn't work out well unless you're long on a great idea, like people who loved Apple in 2001.
Amen.
seems like the past months already proved that plenty :D
Report and move along. Petty arguments violate our rules.

Aside from what the ultra-whales are doing at the top, which is some major price manipulation in either direction, the prices tend to really move on momentum, until they finally reach such a dramatic and climatic point that they collapse and the momentum shifts directions.

Bitcoin is the ultimate speculative asset.  This isn't tulip bulbs or Pets.com.  Tulips have no fixed supply, they can spoil, they're not easily transferable.  Pets.com's price is ultimately dependent on real data (profit, earnings, etc.) which is all easily comparable to similar and more successful companies.  It's quite easy to point out a Pets.com on the stock market over a reasonable time period.  I'm sure it will be easy to point out a Pets.com style crypto-currency over time as well.

But Bitcoin is not Pets.com.  Bitcoin is clearly the first, the biggest, the most well known.  It's Microsoft, but for an asset that cannot be easily valued.  Imagine Microsoft hid all their corporate data and the only information you had to work with was the trade volume of the stock and its price.  That's Bitcoin.  

You can imagine how such an asset would get massively inflated or deflated simply based on momentum.  When it's going up in price, everyone wants it.  They want it because everyone else wants it.  Not because of record Windows installations across home PC's, or a 15% increase in profit over the past year.  Not because of any real data.  That's not to say Microsoft in this scenario is a shit company or a shit asset.  You just have no way of quantifying its performance, and have to basically guess from indirect evidence.
Well. The things you mentioned are direct consequences of the price dropping, not the other way round. Going by your logic we will never go anywhere because we are in a downward spiral where price negatively affects use and adoption and that negatively affects the price. Your post has no value. Its no surprise that volume is low when we just hover around 6-7k for weeks. Its no suprise transactions, adresses and overall sentiment is down when we Just dropped from 20k to 6k. 

The thing is, that says absolutely nothing about how the price is moving. 

edit: well, somebody already typed that out... 
That wasn't me, though I did see another comment like that. Might have been another user, or that bot. No offense and nothing personal, sorry if that annoyed you...just a humorous way to say that you have a good point but it could be made in a nicer way, is all.
Normally "breaks or is rejected"
Hail Hydra
what about the lower low on 4/1 ?
You do realize bears would absolutely love 7.5 k or even 7.7k even?

Again, don’t long the breakout and don’t short the dump.

Ppl just don’t seem to get this very simple point in s bear market

If we drop to 5k would't you rather take a small (stop)loss and go all in on a long there? Seems like the better option unless your not margin trading and just buying/holding.

Green is that sideway wedge I have drawn. And the purple line is from that big falling wedge on the 1D.  
Thanks gents.
I think TA is one thing, but we must also take into consideration the psychology and consumer behavior.


Ahaa, at this point, I think it will be a good idea to be on the sideline and open a long only after 7.3 resistance is crossed.

I just closed my long at 7171. Will open another long when price reclines $100-$150. If not, I will reopen after the resistance as said above.
I would not say order books are that important and the movement goes in the the direction where the book is thiner, that is def. not the case. My point was that I do not agree to your conclusion that people do place sell orders uphand, because they dont expect the price moves there. If people would not expect the price turns at one point we would not have buying. 

When we have been in the bull run I observed that the order book was crazy asymatric and lot more orders were placed at the buy, than at the sell side. That is still the case, but not as strong as in the bull run. Best place to check the whole order books is; [http://bitcoinity.org/markets/bitfinex/USD](http://bitcoinity.org/markets/bitfinex/USD)
But I just see it as self metairony, or role playing maybe.

The low effort is like the fun joke in itself :p
I agree, it's hard to tell right now if he's just guessing and lucky by repeating the same stuff over and over (short the bounce isn't exactly prescient) or if he's actually making decent calls.. Some of his targets have been fairly accurate all things considered
[deleted]
Serious question because I don't know anything: Why do institutional buyers need "time" to accumulate? It's not like normies who have to wait two weeks for their next paycheck to come in before they can buy more crypto. Wouldn't they just make an order and that would be it? Only reason I could think of would be staggered buys in case the price drops in the interrim?
[removed]
The session expiration is the most annoying part indeed.
Not everybody follows the requirements.  BTC compliments this nicely.  And as you note, a benefit to them in light of their reduced purchasing power is their ability to avoid withholding taxes.
Oh I just assumed he's serious and I find it entertaining... In an embarrassing way.
I wondered if that account was some kind of experiment. Posts completely conflicting (yet equally ridiculous) views, flipping opinion several times a day. 

Such a waste of time/space
Thanks :)
Haha yh something like that
And a very entertaining TV show.
Did something change with the rainbow charts on moonmath? The zoomed in one doesn't match the zoomed out one (the alignment of the colorbands).

Just curious. :)
M is the Roman numeral for thousand, MM is Roman numeral for million. I understand your confusion but the financial industry often uses Roman numerals. 
Yes, I had a feeling I was going to be wrong but didn't listen to myself. Silly mistakes, oh well 
That doesn't prove that there is no manipulation though. Obviously when people benefit from it they have no reason to complain.
this is what I’m seeing too 
Maybe "here" is included, but just not "now".
It's just stupid. Been here 16 months and not one single time has anyone ever used the phrase "Bart" until the last week or two. Jackalopes here can't do nothing but repeat what they see on Twitter.
They do the same on RSI, macd or gut feeling and sometimes they're right, sometimes they're wrong.

We base our moves on single line, or 'trend' and still we are often wrong. It's like Chevy said, it's like counting cards.

The only thing that matters really is r/r and good stops. You can base it on coin flip if it works for you, just remember about good stops. The last thing is what makes us profitable. Cut your losers fast, let your winners ride.
i hear you bud, makes sense 
It's night and day compared to what it was before their trading engine upgrade.
Log scale. I'll look closer tomorrow if you insist, but I'm pretty sure that should be charting correctly.
Possibly.

From what I see, if bitcoin drops significantly more than 40%, it's a bear market. Up until then it's all simply a correction 
But that makes sense...people opening shorts drops the price - when the price stays the same and shorts are skyrocketing... That would be a buy signal
No problemo, good luck out there!
I don't care if it's insulting, as long as it's accurate.
Nah, I like to be a reality check here.
The path of maximum pain has very little to do with who wins or loses on a given trade, the recent obsession with how many longs and shorts are open is pretty stupid. It's about psychology.The hopeful optimism that gets crushed when people think the trend has reversed. "Capitulation" is when people think the trend will never reverse and when "btc is ded".

I don't pay any attention to the manipulation narrative either. Whales are not godlike people with 150 IQ's and decades of experience in markets. They are just humans and some of them probably are pretty bad traders who got rich by having bought BTC years ago. Someone I know really suffers by becoming rich overnight and having no clue how to manage all his money. Sure they manipulate the market (like those drops before the pumps in the weekend), but they don't FIGHT the trend. You can own a shit ton of BTC but you will get destroyed if you think you can beat the market. This is true for every market and if you don't think that super wealthy people get rekt every day in a given market, you have misunderstood the game. 
haha I love the hate on MPC. I fucking hate him so much. Darkenergy as well. 
Recommend following DonAlt, SvenLink and Imperator_Deus on twitter.  Everyone else there is a perma-bull. 

I miss anyone? 
My real problem with a tether collapse is that it'll put a 6+ month chill on crypto, possibly 12-18 month chill. We'll need a hard reset if anything happens to tether or Bitfinex
Yes, I agree. I'm being obnoxious and dramatic. I like a lot of people here who are long term holders and do not wish for them to lose any money. But the cult like mentality of hodlers is obnoxious and their aggression and belligerence is enough for me to say I'd enjoy watching it die :) 

There's nothing wrong with long term holding and I concede that it is in almost all circumstances a *far* better strategy than trying to trade

There *is* something wrong with being angry at people who sell (leave the cult) and calling people who trade/short bitcoin "evil" and taunt any non-hodlers with cult jargon and inside joke insults 

There is a difference between a long term investor and a hodler, that's all. Hodlers are the crossfitting vegans of bitcoin. LTHolders are the fit, vegetarian dudes at the gym who are chill about their lifestyle

There is no such thing as free money, though.. There is taking risks and being moderately lucky. There's a huge difference. Hodlers think they earned every single dollar, LTHs understand they took a risk and reaped the asymmetric reward

Hodlers who shit on trading and TA simply don't realize they're just long term traders and that they're using TA to justify their position ("it can't go down much more from here, it's never done that before" is very basic TA)

99.99% of hodlers would not invest in bitcoin if it were sub $100 right now, even if it had the same exact fundamentals. 

Investing in a parabolic asset *is* a very basic form of TA and trading. It's just simpler and longer term
I don't hate it at all. I dislike things about certain parts of the community, primarily the cult like hodl mentality. "hodling" itself is fine...the community and culture surrounding the word...not so much

I have some good friends I made on this sub who are practically permabulls and super invested in the technology and are long term holders. 

I just disagree with them is all. I have no issue with people seeing the long term potential of bitcoin. I can definitely see what they see, I just don't see it happening that way (if bitcoin continues to develop at the same pace it has so far), although that could be a *huge* misunderstanding of the tech on my part. 

Read my other responses to get a more nuanced understanding of my disdain for "hodling" 

Essentially though I don't like to see people lose money and I've seen so many stories of people losing money they couldn't afford to lose that it makes me sad and a bit upset. Comes from personal experience as well. 

Bitcoin itself is really fucking cool. It's pretty brilliant and innovative as a software technology, I just don't think it's going to replace all fiat and make us all infinitely rich 

You're right though, I *am* going to stop trading bitcoin at some point here soon and will just hold at least a bit, ironically enough. I can be emotional over it but I'm not stupid and I realize that there's still a chance bitcoin bubbles to retarded heights again 

It's just that there *will* be a top and it will leave behind a massive wake of bagholders who will hodl their bags at the expensive of rich early investors

Thanks for the thorough explanation. I see that you have created quite the logic loop there for yourself, but as I already typed out for a poster above, I completely refuse to accept the logic that Bitcoin is only usable as a payment and transfer system when it is in a speculative bubble. 

Perhaps you suggest that there will be another bubble there to milk and that in itself will be a viral event that will once again spark interest for new business ventures, but.. that is both not very probable and also very unhealthy for bitcoin as a tech.
What? Businesses don't use bitcoin because its dollar value is currently 10000, 7000 or whatever else number? Is there a specific price threshold then where the businesses will start using bitcoin as a payment system, and how the hell can that possibly be a deciding factor, compared to ease-of-use, sustainability etc? :D

> Going by your logic we will never go anywhere because we are in a downward spiral where price negatively affects use and adoption and that negatively affects the price. Your post has no value.

Let me repeat myself: what?? I said that fundamentals are negative and therefore its hard to see us suddenly breaking the downtrend and decisively moving upwards. Was that really so hard to distill? 

I completely refuse to accept the logic that Bitcoin is only usable as a payment and transfer system when it is in a speculative bubble. I really believe that Bitcoin in itself actually has technical value too, and if that is not the case, then it is doomed anyway. 
  
thanks
Yes correct I drew that one too fast, but when I add in that 4/1 low it is neutral with no divergence either way. 
150 was only for a day or two

You're right about that option.  TBH though, I don't see this dropping very far, and I'm expecting the drops to happen mostly with knifes.    I believe if I do set a SL and try to get back in that there is a higher chance that I miss a bounce and get chopped up chasing reentries and locking in losses.

I've done this long building strategy 2 times since march 30th, neither time living up to it's expectations on how low we go, maybe that means this third time is the time it fucks me ;)   And this is the only time I don't have it hedged with a short started at the opposing high point.

Thanks for sharing your chart.  I've since deleted that purple line, as the wedge breakout is now invalidated with that drop IMO.  I have it shifted over now to form a channel (it's still somewhat wedgy, just pointing very far away now.)
>When we were in the bull run the buy side was much thicker

No it wasn't, it was significantly thinner. even the past 3 months, the thicker side of the book is generally the side that the market moves towards in the short term. 

The buy side here is consistently thick because people expect it to go down short term but long term go way, way up. 
Lol actually yeah I get that. it's hard to tell with him because I think he really was salty at bulls calling him out. 
Because they are in no rush and 70% profit is much better that 55% when you're dealing in millions.
If you think it's easy to buy $800,000,000.00 at very close to the current market price using the exchanges, you are mistaken.
yes you're right, it doesn't make sense 
I don't think they would make staggered buys. I think they might make an OTC order due to slippage (e.g., if you want to buy at 7300, but a large order would drive the price to 7600, you would buy over-the-counter). However, I don't think it makes sense at all here because the price is going down.
There's a limited supply. First you'd buy up all you could OTC, then you'd hit the last of your target with big market buys to spark a short squeeze and FOMO, making the coins you bought quietly OTC more expensive.

It's harder to buy 50K BTC than you might think, at least without jacking the price way up.
Regulatory compliance, slippage, and counterparty risk are all more important reasons to use OTC than hiding trades from the public.
Thats not how it works though, the employer is on the hook for withholding and reporting of withholding to the government. But look your getting semantic for no reason the "norm" is as I've stated, I'm sure there are an insignificant number of players operating the margins as well. 
See the CDPR in the top left. One chart is the 2012 trend and the other is the 2017 trend.
I come from a scientific world. The definitions are pretty clear there, k=kilo=1000. In the few financial statements I have read (European), they also have used k and M for 1000 and 1000000.  
It's a hard one to predict. Not into technicals but this market is clearly playing out in that way. Unreal moves. 
yeah, my point is "Manipulation" is hard to quantify
and they are gone, and price move 20$ instantly lol
Both are absolute morons lol 
loops22 is funny 
Yeah I actually fully agree with you there! And yeah, "our" (/r/BitcoinMarkets) hodlers are a calmer and more rational bunch as a whole when compared to the /r/Bitcoin meme machine.

I have disdain for the meme hodlers that you describe, but also a little bit of sympathy. I, too, went through some of those thought processes during my first bear market in 2014. Things like "if only you idiots would stop selling, we could stabilize and go back up; we could all get rich off of longs in a bull market instead of squeezing tiny profits off of $20 drops ($20 was a big move back then) and risking crushing this thing back into obscurity." Like, I really get that point of view, and there's a little bit of truth to it.

But of course having those thoughts is old-man-yells-at-cloud useless; there's no fighting the freight train of a strongly-trending market, bear or bull, and it's all prisoner's dilemma / tragedy of the commons type stuff. You can't convince the entire market not to sell so we can go back up, and he who sells first sells best, etc. etc. You just have to let things play out and adjust as you go along.

I still wish shorting didn't exist, though....
So basically you're like that meme that shows the world split into RICH ASSHOLES and POOR PEOPLE.

And then someone says no no, and they squish RICH and POOR together, then cut off a slice vertically containing *some* rich people and *some* poor people. 

And they label *that* slice "assholes".

As for this:

> I just think it's a selfish way to think. they quite literally want it to be a ponzi scheme where they benefit more because they got in earlier.

It's not a PONZI scheme. The ponzi scheme never has enough money to pay out the latest investors. It relies on that. Bitcoin you can buy and then sell three minutes later if you want, and you will get your money (minus the 7% it fell in three minutes, and fees, and misc, haha).

Also there is no method of trading Bitcoin or anything really where you come out with a profit, that isn't "selfish".

All trading is fundamentally you selfishly thinking some idiot is going to sell you something "too cheap", and some other idiot will buy it back from you at some point "too expensive".


i think that's the point, we have been here for a while
Oo yes I ve been stopped too while it did move the way I wanted. Only solution is setting stops further but that increases losses or keep watching the chart lol.

It could drop far though, nobody knows if the bear is over. That sideways wedge is a continuation pattern. Although with the help of whales we broke up out of one to 7400 a week ago.

2 pieces of advice you probably already know but help me a lot is. Don't trade if your not sure or TA is shit. Better to be patient and wait for an opportunity. And trade falling and rising wedges. Those have always been profitable to me.


>the thicker side of the book is generally the side that the market moves towards in the short term. 

I have noticed the same thing in the past few weeks.
If you go here: [http://bitcoinity.org/markets/bitfinex/USD](http://bitcoinity.org/markets/bitfinex/USD)

and click on the "\-" to zoom out, you can see that the left side \(I call it buy side\) is much thicker than the right side \(the sell side\). That was always the case in the bull run and it was more asymetric. I observed this a lot and took screenshots \(see my comment histrory\), so I really know it was like that.
and that's what I enjoy even more, you really don't know
[deleted]
Wouldn't the big boys want to DCA as well? Say there, Sloppy Fund Manager, allocate 1% of the portfolio to magic internet money. Would you do it all at once after watching the last year or would you buy in weekly/monthly intervals to spread your cost basis?
[removed]
Thank you!
I'm taking the stance of the U.S. financial industry. 
i can confirm that /r/BitSecret is correct about the US financial services industry (although it's definitely confusing)
It will look stupidly obvious in hindsight. Was a very silly mistake, got complacent yet again 
Yeah haha I follow him too. Don't see much analysis from him but he is funny af. 
I just think it's a selfish way to think. they quite literally want it to be a ponzi scheme where they benefit more because they got in earlier.

If anything, hodling is the "immoral" mentality. it's a hope for massive wealth inequality, basically

All the people who are up right now are up because people like the guy who wanted to buy his wife Lasik surgery are significantly down. 

That's why I don't like what "hodl" has turned into. It's a "who can bag hold to make others rich the best" competition

I sympathize with individuals but criticize the herd because the herd is unhealthy and toxic 
Mainly, it's not a ponzi because it's not by definition. There is no central operator controlling the scheme and benefitting from it by directing some money from later investors back to earlier ones and pocketing the rest. He's thinking of pyramid scheme, and even so, Bitcoin is no more a pyramid scheme than any stock, commodity, or other investment (as you summarized at the end of your post).
I don't even really know what the first half of your comment is saying. My point is people are dumb and easily manipulated and should generally stay away from investing if they get emotional over people taking positions opposite of theirs

As for the second part, all you need is to read the mentality of the average bitcoin hodler. They get angry when people sell, trade, or do anything but buy and hold bitcoin. They've drank the Kool aid and truly believe this is their big break, this is what will make them rich, this means they won't have to work anymore as long as other people keep buying. 

I know bitcoin is not intended to be a ponzi scheme, but for what it's worth it's never functioned as much else for most people. The ridiculous swings serve to make whales richer and small retail traders poorer.

There is literally no mathematical way that the average bitcoin investor will be up in their money when all is said and done. It is a zero sum game in the end and the average Joe will lose money.

It is wealth redistribution however you like to look at it and it greatly benefits early adopters and market makers/manipulators

And the only difference I really give a shit about is that hodlers think they've been blessed by God himself with the natural talent to see the most special, spectacular asset of all time instead of realizing they just got lucky that someone was foolish enough to buy higher than them in the middle of a bubble
But we were only at 5900 for less than a day
Thanks for the tips!


do not remember the 1250 btc walls at $17250 on GDAX? twice? Never ever saw a buy wall that big. And $10k was like what...5k btc? 10k? it was huge 
It seems that 100M+ buys are not that rare and some whales just can't be bothered to plan around slippage : https://twitter.com/MacroScope17/status/981890755269660672
Absolutely right. And even with $100 million, that's not too difficult with a little patience. Because to take your example, it's not like the price will instantly settle at $7K+...it'll dump back down to only slightly higher than it was before, and (especially in this bearish market) the asks will start popping back up. So you could wait a few minutes or an hour and blow the ask side out again. And if you combined that with some slightly above-market bid walls too, heck, you could probably build up a billion dollar position in a few days and within $100 or two of current price.
DCAing is generally a retail investor technique afaik. Big money has no need to get a perfect entry. If they think it's going to $20k again then $3-6k, it doesn't matter what price that much. I doubt they care to time it perfectly.


also a lot of them buy for reasons other than selling at a higher price later 
> counter party risk is GREATER in a OTC market

You clearly do not know what you're talking about.

> upward bid slippage isn't a concern in a bear market

Cause nobody sells and cares about slippage in a bear market, right
Everything looks clear in hindsight.. Not a sign of complacency. 
He's the one who posted the try again chart 
Ehhh...I'll disagree with you on most of that.

First, not a ponzi, by definition (by the way I can't believe we still have these discussions, and come on, you should know better...I mean that in a nice way). Pyramid scheme if you want to use the right terminology, though I'll still disagree with you.

I'm sure at least *some* of the hodlers want it to go up for selfish reasons. But not everyone who wants it to go up is purely selfish. Many just want to see the technology thrive and achieve further adoption, and price increases are both a symptom of that and one of the main drivers.

Here's my main gripe, and I've heard and had these arguments too many times to count: you could replace Bitcoin with Tesla or Apple stock, or any traditional investment. Everything you said would be just as true/false. Bitcoin just happens to be so easy to hate on, if you're a Bitcoin hater (I know you're not, but the arguments you make are common /r/Buttcoin talking points).

* Early Testa/Bitcoin holders benefit disproportionally from the instrument doing well and gaining in price. Their gains come directly from future buyers (with the exceptions of dividends, in the case of certain stocks, but that's secondary).
* Tesla/Bitcoin holders believe strongly in the goals and aims of what they're holding. Many will "shill" (ugh) or proselytize because they believe what they're holding is the future and will benefit society in many ways.
* I don't see a single thing immoral about the above, unless you're doing something shady (convincing your senile grandmother to put her entire pension into it, or whatever).
* If anything, top-buyers have a more "immoral" mentality than holders. They FOMO into something they don't understand (from a fundamental/tech perspective and/or a market perspective) and then get upset that the thing that produced outsize returns is for some reason no longer producing outsize returns. And I say this as someone who has bought a fair share of relative tops. But I never complained about it, and it never rekt me because I invested responsibly with reasonable amounts over time, did 100s (later 1,000s) of hours of research, and tried to fully understand what I was getting into instead of acting like a shoeshine boy / Uber driver.
* Etc. Etc.

For the first point, I don't think that's a bad thing at all; I think that's exactly how things should work. Much more risk, much more (potential) reward. People buying Bitcoin at $10 or Tesla stock at $25 when the former was weirdo internet funny money and the latter was an upstart, long-shot electric car company with a 'meh' roadster were taking huge risks and deserve to reap the rewards for their investment, which helped both achieve future success.
Another thought, vis-a-vis bear markets and hodlers:

Bear markets are like getting sick. Getting sick sucks, but you don't want to *never* get sick, because you need your immune system to be exposed to all sorts of nasty things on a semi-regular basis so that it builds up immunity. If you never get sick, eventually some otherwise relatively benign bug will come along and completely destroy you. Same thing with bear markets, you can't just go up and up and up forever. You need a bear market to wash out the get-rich-quick FOMOers, the con artists, the weak businesses, the shady ICOs, etc.

That said, I can't blame a single hodler for wanting to get the bear market over and done with, the same way that you might not mind being sick for a few days but don't want to be sick for weeks. A 6 month bear market is much better for almost everyone than a three year bear market. The more hodlers, the higher the floor for the price, and the quicker the market can be convinced that a bottom is found. Can you imagine if nobody hodled through 2014? We would have gone down to who-knows-where...$100? $20?

And there is a certain point where bear markets go from annoying, to damaging, to downright dangerous. If the 2014 bear market lasted an extra year and went down to double digits, can you imagine how catastrophic that would have been? Not just to hodlers fortunes, but to the ecosystem as a whole. As it is, it already went beyond washing out weak hands and weak companies to threatening legitimate businesses and ventures. Merchants, companies, start-ups, dev teams, and basically everyone would have been at grave risk.
I never called bitcoin a ponzi, I said people treat it like one. Which is what irritates me. You guys are misunderstanding the comment 
You might focus on a few walls at some places, I mean the order book as a whole. Currently you need to sell almost 10k BTC to bring the price to 6k on Bitfinex. But on the other hand you can bring the price to 8k with buying 5k BTC.
Maybe, I don't know. I guess I don't know how these Quant's think. It would matter to me, but I am just a dumb dude. 
Like I said in the other comment, I never called bitcoin a ponzi scheme and am actually irritated when people treat it like one. You've misunderstood my point and I can assure you I don't think it's a ponzi scheme, although some people desperately wish it were 
Ok, cool. I think it was this comment that confused me (and maybe the other commenter):

> they quite literally want it to be a ponzi scheme where they benefit more because they got in earlier.

I see your point, but I think the only people that want Bitcoin to be a ponzi scheme are /r/Buttcoin regulars. Everyone else wants the technology to change the world and/or to get rich off of it as a speculative investment. I don't see that in the same negative/fraudulent light as one would a ponzi or pyramid scheme.

Anyway, I hope you got something out of my replies. Good chatting with you as always!
