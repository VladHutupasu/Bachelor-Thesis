#New post: [\[Daily Discussion\] Thursday, April 19, 2018 →](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8dbx5s/daily_discussion_thursday_april_19_2018/)
If you wanted people to quit margin trading, I imagine this is how you'd do it. 
I wonder how people whining about market conditions now will react to months of sideways in a <10% range and most price action happens within 15 min every other week.

Welcome to actual trading. It's super boring 95% of the time.
The sub 8K support has been insane. I have no idea who the support is but it’s there. Have we really reached the bottom? Find out on next episode of Bartcoin
this is getting ridiculous
Mental note to oneself. When Bollinger says on Twitter that it would be advisable to think about what alts to buy in the future he likely means 'buy now'
I'm expecting this to break up, but that's mostly because I'm short currently.
So would everyone agree that Bitfinex leads/dictates the market 95% of the time? (Serious question, I don't watch all the exchanges that closely - mostly just GDAX and Bitfinex some of the time) Given Bitmex's volume these days, they *should* be the one leading, but this is not the case, correct? If Bitmex *is* leading the market these days then you can stop reading now bc the rest of this is nonsense. 

Tinfoil hat time.. 

Interesting to see that of the $6.5B in 24h BTC volume, only about $280M of it is coming from Bitfinex. This $6.5B is also a bit inflated as a whopping $2.2B of that volume is coming from Bitmex - and then there's also volume from BTC and alt pairs. The Bitmex volume here is key though. 

https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/#markets

You may be beginning to see what I'm getting at. If Bitfinex is the exchange moving the market, but there's a significant amount of volume occurring on other exchanges (particularly Bitmex), then there is a major opportunity for those with deep pockets. 

Example: On days with low volume and stable price: Trader X fills his bags on Bitmex around $7800, opening a long position worth about $20M lets say (a position this big doesn't seem unreasonable from the position sizes I've seen on bitmex and the daily volume). Additionally, a position of this size would be hard to obtain on Bitfinex without moving the price. Trader X then smashes market buys on Bitfinex, buying 500-1000 bitcoin and moving the price up a few percent. These market buys cost him around $8M and his goal is to ultimately break as close to even as possible on his Bitfinex buys. He then unloads his Bitmex bags at the newly established higher price. 

The sudden pressure to then sell at the higher price could be the reason for the breaking down of bull flags or breaking up of bear flags. It could also just be the same technique being applied the reverse way once they've been able to flip their position. 

Interested to hear what others think of this [*conspiracy*] theory, or why I'm wrong. 


Bulls and bears each have good indicators to support their direction right now.  Truth is this is choppy bullshit.  Don't get rekt. Sometimes the winning move is not to play.
Closed my short at around $8,120. 

Mostly just getting tired of this nonsense. 

Will re-open below $7,800 if that's the direction this is headed.
Have finally DCAd down to $9100/BTC after 4 months of dip-buying

Didn't buy enough of the $6k dips as I'd ran out of fiat at the time (priced in a 40% dip, not a 70% one, so I got cut hard catching the falling knife)

Hopefully only a few more weeks until I'm back in the green!
For the first time in many weeks and am happily sleeping in long positions. Just like the last 3, big runs since the summer I'm now more fearful of missing the next big pump than I am of a dump. Trading anything  less than the 4hr has never been my thing, but larger swings, I'm killing it. It's nice to be away from the charts for a change. Yes, I see the big ass downtrend line we are approaching and this lovely pullback and consolidation is the perfect setup to make a run at it. 
Yesterday during the drop from $8,100 to $7,800 I posted [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8cts74/daily_discussion_tuesday_april_17_2018/dxixekp/) that effectively stated: "chill the fuck out, there's nothing to see here yet."

Well, the inverse could be applied here as well. 

While violent upside and downside moves may seem meaningful, there's really nothing to get too excited about until the moves violate established support or resistance. 

For the current movement, it's a big ole nothing burger until $8,200 breaks up, followed by about $8,500. If $8,500 breaks, this move will have my attention, but there's still the [log resistance line](https://imgur.com/a/R1mzo) just overhead at around $8,640 to contend with.

If that were to break, then all bets are off on what happens next.

Last night I got a DM from /u/gypsytoy suggesting I take a look at the log resistance line from the 2014 bubble burst, and it was pretty eye-opening:

https://imgur.com/a/zFUxj

If you notice, the line was broken to the upside at around $550...but the market continued to gradually decline while hovering just above the line (aside from a few false breakdowns) for several months. 

It's futile to speculate on whether the same scenario will play out here if the log resistance line breaks. But it does give me some pause in regards to entering a yolo long if it does. 

As for me, I'm still holding my short from $8,330 with stops at breakeven. There's a relatively high likelihood that I could be stopped out prematurely if the market pumps to $8,400 and fails to continue higher again...but I'd rather get out of the way prematurely than get caught in a short that's severely underwater after a break of $8,650. 
Prediction:  Underwater shorts watching the 1m candles intently, worried they are about to get BGD'ed again.  It starts to dip back lower than 8200 for a bit, they get some hope, then it stops, starts turning up a bit, goes to 8230+.  They see this, think this might be their last time to get out with and minimize their loss (which they didn't do on last BGD, because reasons).  They start exiting their shorts, which creates buying pressure, market buys start hitting, stops start hitting, etc.  We have BGD#2.
Bitcoin is unpredictable. The rules still apply.

Low effort posts will be removed and you may spend a day in the sin bin.
Bogdanov’s know when you are sleeping, they know when you’re awake, they know if you’ve been long or short, so just hodl for goodness sake...ohhhhhhhh you better watch out...
Here's the thing though. We haven't dropped below the 7.9/8k support since we pumped to this range last week.

I'm considering adding to my long here, simply because this sideways movement on this range implies enough people are bothered to buy at this price. 

Despite all the dumps over the week we haven't seen any sort of follow up like we'd see back in Feb/Mar. Only question is why is support so great at 8k but not at 8.1k. 

It feels like people fear the pullback as soon as we go above 8.1, providing no incentive to buy which leads to a slow bleed / pump like we saw today. Like It becomes a self fullfilling prohecy. 

Where are all these long term hodlers buying the dip? where are the moonboys who don't give a shit about today's price because it'll be 100k in 2 years anyway?

Whats intresting aswell is that if we keep this sideways movement going, between the range of 7.5 - 8.3 we will soon 'collide'(?) with the long term log resistance line since our ATH. 

According to my chart this would happen on the 27th this month. Might not be a bad idea to stay out of position untill then.




-He fomoed in.

-Bart it.
To those who made money today: congratulations 

Edit: you earned every cent
Long from around $8,140. Stops below $8,000

Edit: I don't have a ton of faith in buyers right now, but I'm willing to roll the dice a bit here as I've had a string of successful trades lately.

It's basically Bart or trend reversal here. And the reward for getting in on a strong position for the latter is substantial. 
What we have here is an ascending triangle with a double fakeout forming around a bull flag that broke into a bear flag that broke into a bull flag that broke into a bear flag that broke into a bull flag that broke into a bear flag that broke into a bull flag inside a massive bull pennant type thing. Classic bitcoin.

^^#notaseriouschart
Been watching /r/bitcoin's online user count creep up all morning and it's just hit 20k. Has been floating around 8/9k over the last few weeks.

Anyone any idea why?

Any big media attention in the last few hours since the New York Attorney General questionnaire thing?

Could it be an indicator in incoming volume? Or is that optimistic?
Whales doing their best to find liquidation points for longs and shorts.  Easy money.
Once again the buying pressure and recovery abilities below 8k are remarkable.
[deleted]
The only quasi-consistent thing I can tell about the Barting/inverse Barting is that they seem to complete (reverse from the original candle) when FOMO in either direction doesn't catch fire. I can only spot one or two times when a Bart-attempt that didn't cause a good amount of volatility led to another successive move upward. Hence why bear pennants and bull pennants that come off these things seem to reliably play out the opposite direction.
Market movements are so predictable until their not. Moral of the story, hedge and loosen up the stop losses that way you don't get played by the "whales". 
In order to maintain my sanity during this bart fest, I've decided to keep things very simple:

Until daily RSI drops below Feb 5th low, I will assume bottom is already in. If daily RSI gets above 60 I will assume real bull run has started. Until then I'm just treating everything as noise and will be restricting myself to a handful of small, obvious trades if and when they come.
Hello, this is Margin calling
I was out of position for the last two days. Boy, I feel like my hair is growing back. 
I just want to point out that right before that 1k candle exactly 7 days ago, we dipped about 150 bucks back sub 7k and showed clear signs of a nurturing recovery. Consolidated for about 2 hours and BGDd the heck up

Edit: 150 not 1500
I will let these whales play their game while I go to sleep before today's close. Happy trading guys. Cheers!
closing some of my long from 7.9 here, securing profit. I tend to close a tad too early.
lol
btw this action is exactly why you need a trading stack and long term stack

if you read the charts wrong and get out at say $8,000 and then this thing never comes back to $8,000 again, with a long term stack you'll still profit. 

and it allows you to be patient and wait things out instead of FOMOing at the top 
I probably picked the worst time to start trading in BTC history. This is honestly just aggravating. 3 days of consolidation with small 100$ movements followed by a large candle in either direction. It throws off every bit of TA and I see here and just wait for a whale to do something with BTC’s life. 

Edit: Bbands on the 5 minutes look like a giant French roll standing up putting his arms out begging for food 
How on earth can people be using such tight liquidation levels with the way price action is going. It's asking to be rekt. https://twitter.com/BitmexRekt/status/986620224811225088

So we just had a bull flag that broke *UP*. What a sight to see. 
Could this last spike be related to the CBOE futures settlement in the next 30 minutes? 
PSA: Don’t revenge trade 

          Instead, Revenge RAGE 

Take a fat loss and do excessive amount of drugs and alcohol to deal with your loss. 

( Hookers if you’re feeling spicy too ) 
Does this invalidate the H & S alot of people were talking about?
Literally closed my short 30 mins before the pump because i got spooked, now tossing up whether i should reopen or wait it out a bit.

Seems like the smartest thing to do is wait until we find a definite direction, but I feel like we've all been saying that for a while now with no avail.

Edit: opened another short with tight stops - my guts telling me we drop after this most recent stop-hunt/short squeeze pump.
I get the feeling everyone has taken interest in the latest price movements but that it blew through the 7k range a little too quickly and people are hoping for a dip to 7.2-7.5. A dip from the 8k range isn't too hard to achieve as we've seen but if we hit 9.2 people might start to think the 7 range is gone for good and begin to (lightly) FOMO. 
$65 million buy wall on okex futures. #long

Finex heating up. Fully expected that buy wall to get pulled after the 94 btc market sell.

Edit: Took a bit of a further beating and then got pulled. 
Woah, just wicked down to 8032 for about 2 seconds - anyone know how many coins were sold?

I saw a 10mm+ market buy at 7900 on bitmex. Figured it was a good time to long. Not dissapointed waking up to a bgd.
Looks like some bearwhales and bullwhales are flexing their muscles. It's like the cold war with dildos.

This is a stupid comment but I’ve never used TA. I’ve “followed” bitcoin daily for about 5 years now though. Basically just to check the prices. I feel like I’ve sorta developed some “feels” for what the overall mood is and how the prices will react.

I feel like the overall attitude is slowly transitioning from bearish to bullish. If we go on a run and break ATH this thing will go very very high. Sky is the limit.
Triangle broke upwards:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/58vKDTgh/

Zoom-in:
https://www.tradingview.com/x/r0chOJJz/

My guess: the brown line, going through the Feb 6k wick and some wicks from last year, will provide the next resistance, even before the 20k log-downtrend line (shown in red). The brown line is currently ˜8.4 above us.

Any similar or different thoughts?
69 hours since I am long @ 8,000. Been through all this drama during this period, still holding onto my position proudly. 

Anybody else in the same boat?
We've been fluctuating within this area of weekly levels for over 5 days now.  I think we will leave it soon, probably combined with a kumo break out of 2 hour ichimoku cloud https://www.tradingview.com/x/wcfbGA8a/

Edit: Above weekly level and 2 hour cloud now / kumo break out.
I just find the insane dildo-and-then-sideways movement that we’ve had for the last month or so to be really aggravating. I just want normal growth back. Steady. Not giant single candles that move 5% in an instant. And it seems to be getting even worse.
Short $1mm @ $8100. Stops set at 5%. This breakout seems to have lost steam, expecting the price to fall back to the $7800 range like it does every other day.

May add to this. 
Never thought I'd go to sleep hoping to wake up to the glorious sight of a Big Red Dildo, but here I am. 

Where did my life go wrong?
Today has been some of the weirdest price action I have seen in cryptoland and I've been here >5 years!
Superlow liquidity coupled with leveraging traders. 
This market just ranges suddenly enters stop loss territory for long/short, which are also limit sells/buys territories for short/long.

If you are not a whale i wouldn't trade this, since you can't follow in their stream anymore and take profit reliably in their wake.
These dumps are getting laughable now, fighting a turning tide 

Don’t get caught in a rip 
I would be so happy if this broke up and became a real bull run. My net worth is 50% BTC and I might get laid off soon, so I've been hoarding cash. Worst timing ever. 
My 8100 long survived! Its a miracle!
I should have added @7900... Had an all in buy @7800 that wasnt triggered... 
We are back to the ascending channel from April 12. 
[Chart](https://imgur.com/03zup4D)      
[Zoomed out version](https://imgur.com/BdOOzuj)                            
8200 has been keeping us on the bottom of the channel so far and it can keep it that way until tomorrow at this rate.
The top of this channel will cross the log downtrend tomorrow @ around 8600 (give or take).
If it breaks up from 8200 and goes to the last resistance @8400 we can the go sideways against the downtrend.
Dumb money checking in. 

Panic stopped my long after the dump for a loss last night.  Opened a long in my sleep at about 3am UK time! Quickly stopped it after pump this morning.   Short opened at 8100.  Surely this will revisit 7800?  
[The latest episode of *Buy or Sell, What The Hell*](https://thedistributedpost.com/2018/04/18/easy-on-the-regulations-23/) talks about Bitcoin price action and gives some key pointers as to what is likely to happen in the markets. Also covers the shifting regulations with Kraken and Binance and how it will impact Bitcoin trading.  
Well then, time to short?
So I guess someone is buying with a neckbreaking dip rejection like that.
dumps are getting weaker compared to pumps. Seems like another bear trap.
The altcoins have risen. This could actually fuel the next bull run of btc!
[removed]
Been scalping enough to afford this;

Short 8130. Stop 9142

Hasn’t hit yet. Will market sell if we dip
Ok, I am cashing out my little stack for a while. Can't live calmly, when money is in exchange account, which may blow at any time. Lost 30% today, but still managed to make x4 in 2 weeks. Tired af, and feeling uncomfortable with current market conditions. Have to take a rest, and clean my mind. Planning to return when we hit 10k  or 6k. Good luck. Sorry for off-topic.
Is it just me or do anyone else thinks a lot of the eventual FOMO buying pressure is getting stopped by exchanges like Bitmex just dying when more than 1 order per second wants to execute?
Is this going to be the new standard: dump - wait 2 hours - pump - wait 2 hours - dump - wait 2 hours - pump?
The 5 min chart is just hilarious to look at... lol https://www.tradingview.com/x/ffwPSQUw/
I'm holding my short from 8100 for now, but I'm going to heavy long the next trip to 7950 (assuming it comes) with stops below 7600: https://www.tradingview.com/x/RVIPiP0P/

This ascending triangle is being painted almost perfectly. 

I also have my Sept futs long from 6410 *still*. 
Why do people still bother to do TA in this market? It's basically just random pump and dumps from whales/exchanges. No way to predict anything
That was strange, futures on bitmex was above swaps in price for a while...

I also wonder when I should sleep
[removed]
anything less than 12 h to weekly is pointless to watch.
Last year we had huge run up,some old holders cashed in and buying back for 1/3 of the price .....
Now new generation of "Hodlers" is born!
Oh cool so I could've kept my long open from yesterday instead of getting scared and closing it (not even stopped out) at 7850 and losing a bunch of money. fml. 
trading view shitting the bed for anyone else?
https://poloniex.com.... stuck for me! EU
Ugh Bitmex is awful, wanted to open a short for a quick scalp before the pullback, but the system was entirely overloaded until the pullback already happened...
Hey, its been a while since an IH&S worked out. Gotta be on the watch for those, seem to be working again.
H&S on 1h reaching prime dumping ground, possibly with one more foray to 8100. Shorting from 7930 2x. Manual stops 8400+ to keep an eye on potential doubletop.. edit: exit 7600.
It's hilarious watching the 30min chart since April 12th. Just endless rounds of stalemate between bears and bulls, fumbling around attempting to do price discovery in a thinly traded market for a thinly used asset. Eventually a bear or bull whale gets pissed off and tries to incite fomo in their direction. Then an opposing whale (or the same whale) becomes impatient when the rally/sell-off doesn't materialse and goes big the other way.

Without wider world adoption/fundamental news this endless micro battle is just going to continue imho. Literally no one knows what BTC is worth and there isn't enough real world usage or adoption yet to help answer this. The range at the moment is anywhere from $0 to $1million and a case can be argued for either.

Fun thought: is this bizarre 5min candle driven accumulation/distribution routine the same guy that triggered the initial BGD? Basically him trying to make some bank after realising a massive market buy and short squeeze wasn't going to be enough to flip the market to bull mode?
so lets look at whats happenign

* 500 BTC buy wall @ 8164 pulled
* 500 BTC sell wall @ 8164 pulled
* 500 BTC buy wall @ 8153 still standing
This just shows that stop losses should be bellow 7800 and above 8600. Any less and you will get hunted...
Stay safe and believe in your position. 
We are 200$ above the resistance that became support (7900) The daily is starting to paint for a nice recovery and retest of our medium term resistance of 9100. The daily seems to show an uptrend starting in the next week baring any significant crash. Obviously a repeat of what happened on the 12th would accelerate this.
Epic Bart denied (at least for now). Congratulations, men.

I have a BitMEX account, now. Greasing up my wonkavator for some serious chop. Wish me luck.
Whale pumping, 8.1 long counters ratio for V>3 in the last 20 minutes with a 557 BTC bought.

These whales must short/long 100x right before they make a move, right? Must be the easiest money in the world - I'm jealous. 
Never change Bitcoin. You alllrrriiiggghhhttt

Jokes aside: I’m getting appalled by this blatant manipulation, Candles are just ridiculous by now. Might be time to cash out in protest of whatever the hell is going on.
I don't think I wanna trade anything right now. When bcash is the only thing pumping on coinbase the day after tax day, you know something fishy is going on.
[removed]
Maybe this will fractal the BGD again? 
So the bart got weaker.... if it consolidates here and forms a bear flag, opening up a long would probably be a decent idea.

It’s never more than a 250$ drop 
https://www.tradingview.com/x/T4UFvQqs/

interpretation of the hs we are talking about depends from where you look at it. you can even draw an inverse one on the right shoulder.

i say down, looking at daily stoch rsi and daily rsi resistance i don't think this is the place to break the log resistance. we have to get lower and accumulate more bullish momentum.

at the graph i shared, you can also see we are in the second bear flag after the rising channel. even though i couldnt find it, i can swear i saw this formation before in btc.

Appreciate the explanations of TA and positions taken by all parties here, it’s incredibly informative.

What I don’t understand (among many things in this market) is why a very likely possibility is never discussed. I feel I am missing something massive and would appreciate an answer why this is not likely.

Is it entirely unlikely that the big move up last week was caused by a single entity which then caused a chain reaction? The entity has since then been selling coins within a band with a plan to make let’s say 10% profit in one week. When the price falls, they prop it up again with a small pump. When the stock of coins reach a certain level, let’s say a third of the number bought, they will be used to drive the price down again. Repeat...

I cannot in anyway prove this is what is happening, it does however seem for me to be a simple explanation for the last week. It would also mean the entity does not want price/volume to increase as this would make control more difficult. I think I have missed something  obvious and would appreciate even a short answer why this is not likely.
I don't hear it talked about much, and I certainly missed it (or it became rather apparent only recently) -- but this descending triangle is playing out quite well on the 3D. It should complete by the end of May. Given the lack of buy pressure, I think this pattern plays out more than the prospective AE.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/uEPHHbCS/

Honestly, all timeframes below the 3D are too uncertain for me to trade, so I plan to wait and watch until we fill out the desc. triangle a bit more before I start trading again. I do think this is honestly a great price to increase LT holdings though and will continue to do so at 8k and below.

Good luck to those trading the Judo Chop.
Is it worth noting that it's been nearly a week since the $1000 candle and the price is $1000 up from the pre-candle price?

EDIT: Sarcasm
How do you get liquidated on a short from 8120 on a bounce to 8130?!? That's talent.

@BitmexRekt 12m minutes ago - Liquidated short on XBTUSD: Buy 2,000 @ 8130 🔥 ~ BEYOND GODLIKE x14
So, everyone will wake up 0645 UTC tomorrow, which means the market will not pump as usual then? :)  

This metatrading is the most fun part to be honest
In an attempt to improve my trading I have been trying to take positions that I expect to play out over the course of a few days or weeks rather that just a few hours.  I have also been heavily charting and documenting them so that I can review them after and really drill down into any errors.  I have found this very useful so far.

To me this formation looks a lot like The Wyckoff Distibution Phase.  And I believe this last pump to be the start of what Wyckoff refers to as an 'up thrust after distribution' a last gasp rally.
(http://stockcharts.com/articles/wyckoff/2015/09/distribution-definitions.html)

Here is my trade: https://www.tradingview.com/x/1KldWgtq/
I would appreciate any feedback as I am really spending some time trying to improve this at the moment. Thanks
To long or not to long....

Sorry for this question, maybe it does not belong here, but is there any way to watch BTC on trading view on a complete graph which includes some of the top exchanges or all of them? 
Bought @ 7985. This candle kicked off a battle that does not seem to be going in this one bear's favor. This is likely an intraday trade for me.
Anyone wanna explain how they can tell the difference between natural market moves and "manipulation?"   
I wouldn't short this market at this price but if we fall under 7.8 I'd have my fomo short hedge at the ready. 
This is so fucking messy and choppy. 
[deleted]
This insane altcoin run is giving me a lot of confidence in BTC.
Inverse Bart confirmed. The previous one, on April 6, was followed by an inverse Marge three days later (defined on the right side by the BGD).

Based on this fractal analogy, here is my prediction on how the great 2018 bear market will be concluded by an inverse Bart & Marge pattern (blue line is our downtrend from 20k, upper red line is support/resistance trend from 6k):

Bitcoin has me scared.  I just keep waiting for the hammer to drop despite TA saying up for now.
Classic inverted Bart formation
Still sitting on my scaled-in limit buys from 7800-7750. Like Tom Petty said, the waiting is the hardest part. Nite from the U. S. folks, and good luck to all. 
Another bear flag being painted perfectly on the 5-30 minute. 

Meaning we will probably pump once consolidated here. Considering closing my underwater short from 7930 at a small loss. Also have one open from just above 8150. 
As I remember, around march 16 we were on 8.2 for a long time and then fall down to 6.4.
It would be fair - reverse here ... go up to 10 in a few days. 
So BTC listen to me and jump ....
In the last two dumps, btc and the alts seem less correlated than usual. Some alts - like BCH, XLM, XMR, and VEN - don't seem to have mirrored and dropped as much as they usual do when BTC drops. I wonder if some whales sold BTC to buy alts? 
We just broke out of the range, by my chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/yEf7hInL/

I have the next strong resistance as just above 8300.
100x leverage doesn't sound good, even anything above 3%-5%. Traders be careful with these attractive yet very risky deals. 
Bullish scenario I see *potentially* playing out today:

1. break-up from current bull flag through 8150-8200 (this has been formidable resistance for last few days)
2. this would complete Inverse H&S we're forming rn (head 7850, neckline 8150-8200) - sorry I know, lots of talk of H&S these days, especially before completion
3. Target price on completion of this pattern is ~8500
4. A move back to the 8400-8500 range would be rather bullish imo and could begin to set off some FOMO alarms

Personally, I don't think this thing will "bart" back lower, we've tested the 7.8 range a few times now and its held impressively strong. Longing the break of 8.2 is the play, but I'm scaling in some smaller buys a little below 8.1 here rn and will add on the break. Will re-evaluate if this breaks back below 8 and would likely cut losses there, depending on what I'm seeing.

Short from $8,190 based mainly on this and gut (seems we might be in a channel): https://imgur.com/a/9miJW

Tight stop at $8,290. Initial target in mind: $7,720.
We're still on track to recreate the big bull trap that took us close to 700 in 2014, right? So I guess that would be around 10-12k as the bull trap target this time around, and then it's barts all the way down to about 4k I suppose. Or maybe this time it's different??
I know this comes back over and over but you gotta admit, that's a pretty nice looking h&s on the 1d (volume is pretty textbook too)

Daily stoch RSI doesn't look too good as well


Over the last day, we've had two points of contact on the rising wedge I have drawn. I would say that, with this pump, I can say that this is definitely in play.

Also we had a lower low in price but a higher low on the stoch RSI which is a bullish divergence if I am correct, so it's good to see that play out.


Edit: https://imgur.com/a/63Try Heres what I have
Bullflag? Looks like a slow bleed to me. Similar thing happened yesterday, but at a higher price point. Could we bart back down any minute?
Well, Bitmex is starting to be laughably unusable. 

Mark price on the June contracts is so divorced from reality it's absurd.

EDIT: Unless I'm mistaken, it's based at least in part on the orderbook. When nobody can place orders on the book, it goes haywire. 

Mark price was at $8,060 while spot price was at $8,120. Once spot shot up to $8,220, Mark price went up a whopping $20 to $8,080. 
Alright guys just got me a subscription (or free trial to finally put some time into tradingview instead of using cryptowatch and wisdom). I'm looking for the volume indicator which shows volume traded against price on the y axis instead of just below the chart. Can someone point me in the right direction. Also any favorite indicators outside of MA, EMA, BBANDS, MACD, Ichomoku, RSI and StochRSI that you find useful for your trading would be great.

I still cannot fathom how we have remained around 8k, i still feel like a drop is due
This is becoming laughable.  100% organic™
This market is gone crazy. Whales and Exchanges are slamming retail breakout traders right under or over breakout of patterns. This just shows how illiquid this market is. Its a no trade zone for me. Although i think the same entities will cause max pain by making you think this a bullish scenario only to frustrate you to goblin town. In other words. They will take as much money from the small fish as they can before dumping hard.

Caught that pump in the low 8Ks.

The daily candle is a bit early so I'm not quite changing my long term outlook yet but stoch RSI currently doesn't look quite as awful as before. With those two days, the center of the Sept-6k support line (now resistance) band has gotten up to around 8500. Daily BBands are right up there as well.

A plausible scenario currently is that we continue to chop slightly upwards upwards for a few days and take a possibly ill-fated shot at the ATH resistance around the middle-upper 8ks.

But as I said, it's early in the daily candle. I could definitely see this ending up a doji that just signals a continuing local downtrend. Tight stops at break even - bought in as risk management as I was confident the pump would continue a bit. Not confident at all overall, just saying there is a glimmer of light with that pump.
I don't chart. Is the log downtrend resistance at 8500 or lower now?
So after last night failure to complete the [pattern](https://www.tradingview.com/x/lho5PbOV/) with a recovery above previous proposed neckline. We have yet to break above the left shoulder yet which would be the next step to complete an invalidation. (Which we might be about to do as I write this)

https://www.tradingview.com/x/mb1F68va/

I am now looking at this as another potential HS scenario which would propose a more horizontal neckline on the support. This also gives a tighter alignment of targets in the 7250-7190 area.
Are we just going to dump and pump between 8.1 and 7.8 for the rest of time now? I guess it's predictable till it's not...
If a break out happen and BTC cross 9 or 10k, what do you expect on the alt side ? Are the alts going to be dwarfed by the BTC rise ?
Bull flag?

ITT: delusional shorters getting rekt
Had a long at 8023 from yesterday. Reckon I should take profit now? Will be on a flight in an hour for 5 hours.
Looking at this formation apparent on all time frames. Be careful if you're in a margin position. But in all seriousness a visit to the log resistance seems inevitable. I'd exit any short if 8.2 is breached and at the least enter higher. 

https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/dbz-dokkanbattle/images/2/2c/Bart_squeaky_clean.gif/revision/latest?cb=20170526180503
Are there any other markets that behave similarly to how crypto has been recently? Is this just what an illiquid or low volume market looks like?
The thing that stops me from believing in this breakout so far is the lower high on the bounce yesterday and today. If we get back above 8.2 I'll get optimistic and above 8.5 would have me contemplating a long position.

Did something a bit risky and limit closed my short position on mex as soon as that last push appeared. Got a good price on the priority order and made a good gain.

Plan to attempt this play

https://www.tradingview.com/x/kcwbzEaJ/

If we drop back down I will reenter my short at the same price.

EDIT: 20:26:35 UTC -Target reached, trade active. Short 8170 XBTM18 - Target - 7200 - Stop @ 8460
it just looks like a low volume player that is buying up the dips..
i was just hoping it would imitate the BGD with the test of support and bounce, but i guess that was much to ask.

Well so far my plan didn't quite work, set a stop buy at 8220 at what I thought would be the point that distinguished between a wick and a full blown candle in order to catch the rocket up but this wasn't as big as I hoped. Was too afraid to take a position earlier. Another failed harebrained scheme of mine. Hopefully we can keep climbing.
getting pretty bearish up here, okcoin is right at their log trendline, volume declining, this is looking a lot like the 9.2 top we had with a little last stop out run right before we went down.

I'm so bad at being on the right side of market movements. When Bitcoin first hit 5.9-6k in this bear market, I weighted my allocation toward alt coins thinking they would return to the mean before BTC, but my best alt gained 30% while BTC gained 100%. Since then I've been fully allocated in BTC and now alts are going on a run of their own. I thought BTC would outrun alts again this time around. The only thing I've done correctly was sell all of my alts at 34% dominance and avoided this huge alt coin price correction we've been experiencing. 
Short term: i can smell reversal FOMO everywhere so gonna start fishing for longs between 7.4-7.8k with stops at 7k. Imo, if 7k breakes then we go to 6k and i dont want to be in the market when that happens. would it fall to oblivion? triple bottom? no fucking clue so not touching it below there.

Since this is a potential reversal, I'm slowly scaling into altcoins. But since im acting on FOMO into a potential bull trap, tight stops on everything.

Long term: this shit is a bubble that keeps on popping. Starting to truly believe that if I just stay cautious, careful, move slow and protect my capital, ill be able to retire whenever I want. Happy fucking days. But for that to even be remotely possible, need to stay careful.

Will i be the greater fool?
Can someone tell me the difference between a Bart and a Marge please?
u/mandy7 What does your TA has to say for today? u/racc00ndawg Would you like to chirp in, is the air getting thinner, fatter or what?

We're close, but I'm curious whether other people's charts show whether the H&S completion is invalidated by this rise overnight, or if we are possibly still testing the neckline.

Looks like Bart's tweaked his hairstyle a little. I'm liking the quiff.
Came so close to getting rekt just now.
Anyone look at the potential 6h bart formation on GDAX?  Any clue when it'l come slamming down? 
I would rather see a steady decline than this stupid pumps tbh, I think a massive crash is imminent.
https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8d5w6y/amazon_wins_patent_for_data_feed_marketplace_that/

Solid news
I’ve been in the road for the majority of the night. 

Can anyone give me a quick update? 

Bart’s? Farts? 

Somewhat surprised by the Bart overnight. Moving my scaled-in limit buys on GDAX up to the 7950-7900 range. 

We are forming a symmetrical triangle on the 4H that could break in either direction, but it will take some time before it has to make a decision, so I'm expecting more sideways consolidation with reduced volume until a break comes for the next 12 hours or so.

I wonder how and what will happen when we will break the downtrend it could be very violent. Beware of long squeeze, I'm "sure" that we will get the reversal this week thought.
Mikexbt is a whale. Dude shorted a million bucks at 8100 and magically price drops. Anyone else get the feeling we're being played?
Are people watching the log 6 month chart for the bear market case?

Because the 3 month chart or a linear chart the trend ended last week.

Why is the market been in this 600 dollar range for a week? Was the the crash to painful and its all confused?
Just shorted 6,500,000 from 8181.5
Sizeable short at 8.11, liquidation at 9.4. Will I be ok friends? 
Still no big ($150+) 15-min candles in either direction.  Sell side way deeper than buy side, usually a short-term bullish sign but the next big 15-min candle will reveal much.
8130 keeps getting rejected 
This seems beyond weird with these sharp spikes in each direction. I'm not touching this thing.
this is exactly how i feel, like this is a tough period of time to be using leverage, it does feel like "they're" trying to push people out
swings aren't hard enough

2% up or down is just noise. 

noone should be getting liquidated on this minor volatility 

what effect on the price will be if people lessened their margin trading?
I would absolutely love to be able to set a limit buy/sell based on my TA projections and walk away for a week. 

As exciting as the crypto market movement can be, it is very stressful to have to be on top of it 24-7.
It's like a lot of famous traders say. 90% of their trades fail and the last 10% makes up all the 10x profit moves
You go to the bathroom and come back and you've missed the candle for the day.

Interesting to watch this play out on the one minute though, you can almost see the anger from the bull(s) right now over that drop. Must not have been part of the agreement.
It’s so predictable. 

Edit: once again, bull flag broke down. 
nailed it!
Good job 
Ascending triangle agrees: https://www.tradingview.com/x/BFAOMH3B/  

Although I'm also short. I'm hoping for another trip down beforehand, but I have very tight stops right now, because duh. 
Yes, Finex leads and Mex will follow wherever it goes for the most part. I believe aabtc did just this. Open 30million long on mex then do some market buys on finex and profit.
Spot exchanges lead the markets, not future exchanges like Bitmex.
It's my understanding that finex moves the most true volume, mex just seems to be highest because you can 100x leverage compared to max 3.3x for finex. Whales make the market in finex, and dolphins/guppies day trade those moves on mex (not to downplay the impact a large number of traders can have on the overall market by any means). At least that's my impression. Interesting theory though!
Isn't Mex's spot price partially dependent set by BFX's price. So by definition, it will follow.
yeah I'd avoid going margin long or margin short right now. 

not worth the risk over a 2-3% gain 

You are basically flipping the coin 50/50 if this goes up or goes down 
Below $7800 seems like a riskier place to open a short than here, if you're looking for a good entry. It seems people are looking to buy back around the $7.5-$7.6k range, and the order books reflect that right now. You'd be selling right into people's buys if it plays out that way.
does it mean you are long?
> Mostly just getting tired of this nonsense.

Emotional breaks are essential in this market. 
I still have my short open from ~8320.  I moved my stop in tighter because it looks like this consolidation is going to break up or down violently sometime today.  

If it breaks up I’m okay with coming out break even, but I feel like there is a better than 50/50 chance that we will go down from this consolidation.  My reason being that the leg up from 7k-8k has not significantly retraced and I expected at least 50% retrace, which is maybe what’s coming later today.  

What do you think.  
Same here.
Very interesting point. But the way I look at it, the time scales should not be compared 1:1 here. The market is a little bit different now.

This is how I compared the events a few days ago:

2014: https://www.tradingview.com/x/PtyjiIdZ/

2018: https://www.tradingview.com/x/I589Bcd4/

This is of course assuming Wyckoff's first rule: a market never behave the same twice, but it behaves similarly on different time scales and with different extensions.


I agree, this is a real possibility. I had similar thoughts a few days ago https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/5A8Ed3gM-BTC-Crash-2014-Log-Downtrend-Broken/. If the log trendline breaks this could nevertheless be a juicy mid-term setup with a significant upwards drift, even if it continues down later. For some reason and more in line with the 2014 pattern, I doubt we have enough power at the moment to brush through. I rather think we might drop first and then slither through in a sideways movement anywhere between 6500 to 7500 around May perhaps. I am short from here 8150 but will bail if I see conviction at 8400.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/dBpx0HH7/

To add further support to this scenario, perhaps the jump above the log resistance line back then was nothing more than a technical bounce off this trendline. With no real volume, the decline then continued.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/dCWr7zfG/

Wonder if that will happen again..
This will not go past 8.2. I got a tuna sub on it. 
May 2014 is literally the nightmare scenario. If that action repeats, many people will lose lots and lots of money. And guess what month it's about to be in 2018....
I'll order two BGDs to go please... with a side of lambo.
I like this narrative mostly because it implies we won't get Barted again. Please don't Bart us again.
Maybe the whale just wanted a slightly higher vantage point to dump on us from.

why did i laugh...
You have similar sentiment to me, I'm waiting for the pullback from the recent run up. and when I say pullback i mean i would be looking for "buying the dip", or "back to the downtrend" kind of thing.

I agree, the longer we stay bouncing here the more confident I get, but also more nervous waiting for the next move ;)
Or is that what they want you to think?
> Where are all these long term hodlers buying the dip?

After so many dips a guy starts running out of fiat..
sometimes it feels really personal...

not necessarily, the pattern has been go up $200 then do a market sell an hour or two later then pump it back up

the number to watch is $7800 if it drops below that, you know the real sell off has started 
D'OH!
[removed]
Yeah, you've been straight killing it for like two months now. Grats on the gains man you earned it. 

It's cool how you adapted to the market instead of got frustrated and left. You were getting shafted there for a bit and you turned it around big time
Kind of interesting how everything else is doing well right now and Bitcoin is the dysfunctional one that can't seem to decide what to do. If it's the follower this time, we should be headed up. I'm still 50/50 and waiting on target buys/sells at 8450/7900 respectively.

The way I look at it, if the whale fuckery continues, it's likely to bounce/reject when the RSI gets stretched like it has all day. Those ranges should be fairly safe to fill if it happens again.
Forgive such a nooby question, but what is a Bart?  I understand pump and dump, trend reversal, etc., but I must have missed the definition of this new term.
Do you have a take profit point/strategy in mind? I am pondering whether to aim at TP of ~8.4, or whether to let it run further. One factor is how much significance this red line (from 6k bottom) will have. My gut feeling (really just that) is that we hit the red line, but then first pull down before an attempt at the log-downtrend line from 20k.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/m3nuEdZz/
Bart or fart ? Find out which on the next exciting episode of Bitcoin.
Well, this has been interesting. I tailed on Jun futs @ 8070. Wicked to 8250 when swaps hit 8300. This is truly laughable.
[deleted]
Add a bear flag to the end of that chart...
Enter Bartology, many small Barts within one big Bart. The question is when will the big Bart conclude?
Throw back to high school geometry 
Burned people returning maybe?
People need to buy their festival accoutrements?
I think going from "oh fuck 6k how low will this go", to "hey, 8k for a week" is a pretty big deal, news is probably spreading about failure to make a lower low.
So it went from 8k to 20k.... 



Can that happen with the *real* Bitcoin please?
Don't mind that, it's not always working as intended, I've seen barely active subs with 2k+ users online. Example, r/SaltCoin sub is dead for months now, user count is still 1k+ all the time.
I was thinking of posting the very same.
when recovers are weaker and weaker, eventually you break through 

we aren't hitting $8500 and getting rejected only to hit it again

we are hitting $7900 and getting rejected only to hit it again

eventually the floor will fall out and you'll see a matching $1,000 big red candle to match the original big green candle
So far looks good but the fact the recovery is lower and lower isn't encouraging
For the first time in months I've been considering adding more fiat whereas after Feb 6th I had a policy of only using what I had already in to trade with. I'm very bullish now, especially after rejecting revisits to 6k and the buying power when it goes sub 8k.
What makes you believe we will test 9K? I agree with you on the sentiment but for us to test 9k, and this week will take a serious amount of bullish pressure to accomplish.

Resistance at 8.2 has been big enough to take us back to 8.1/8. Even the bigger pumps got instantly rejected by some selloffs to push us back below the line.

I'd rather confirm the breakthrough on 8.3/8.4 before hoping on any shot upto 9k. Unless we have another huge 1k pump, but thats off on anyone's chart
> Some entity has extreme motivation to prop the price above 8k for some reason, or there is actually legitimate interest.

Talking about myself, there is very legitimate interest. I believe certainly that the price will go up. Cheers!
That ‘entity’ may be propping up the price to attract longs, only then to disappear & let the price fall. There are numerous opposing ways to read the same situation.  Only time will tell!
Well shit, Bart formation analysis is starting to get legitimized.

Nice observation!
now I have to just fumble that insight into my bot. Thanks, makes sense.
A bit off-topic, but do you believe these patterns are the work of an individual player/group or multiple counterparties?
This market isn't good for predicting the next move right now but it is perfect for placing high sells and low buys and waiting for the price to come to you. That will change once we get enough momentum in either direction, but I don't personally see it happening soon. 
Hi Margin.. go fuck yourself. 
hahaha. God can I relate. 
What does bgd stand for please?
Dude, that's when I messed up. But yes you are right, seems very much similar case.
Yes. At least some of these moves appear to be predictable. Remember that there are either humans or algos causing them, and that generally speaking there is some logic for making their moves when they do.
you still there?
lol
That's what he said.
Lol? More like WTF.
mine was "wow" a couple of times
Lmao
The first part of your comment took alot of reflection and deep meditation. May I ask why not use uppercase "L"? Jk
well, it only pumped 200 bucks.... let’s not blow this thing out of proportion. we broke out of the horizontal resistance line, but we’ve got quite a way until we clear the swamp
>  and then this thing never comes back to $8,000 again

This is exactly the type of thinking that leads to FOMO, buying high and revenge trading
Sometimes it’s best not to overtrade

At $6500 getting in made sense. At $8000+ when there is a bart on the charts not so much. 

Scalping $100 here and there can work but in the long run it’s better to trade on longer horizons where you can pick safer entry and exit points 
Well, you learn a lot here so be thankful. "Trading" in the last 3 months of this year anyone could do, this is where the weak hearted gets shaken out
>I probably picked the worst time to start trading in BTC history

You probably did, yes. I got my account ready for trading last month an except from a small short I closed at 0% I did exactly..nothing.
Hope you didnt short 7900 
that is also max 25x AFAIK
That's crazy. Even more illogical is getting liquidated for 3mm contracts at 8046. That's less than a 1% drop from where we started!
So should I interpret this as somebody just lost $7M?
My understanding is futures don't impact the market that much because there's not enough $$$ in them to justify spending that much coin to pump the price, but I'd be interested in hearing others' takes.
Do the same with your wins. Gotta waste them in something.
In my part of the country, you spelt ‚lass‘ wrong.
yes
Would not say so, only if we go above 8.3k it is invalidated. Now it is not a H&S but it is still possible it will become one. The left shoulder had also this up, down, up, down which we could see here.
I think H & S doesn't exist in crypto. Always other things play out. It had huge resistence line at neck line. Of course go through this and it would fall more. Next strong resistence line is at 7,5k. But resistence was too strong. I think we will retest 7.8 one more time and 8.6 we go.
also short/hedged at 8100. This is just too ridiculous for my taste at this point. I’ll revisit once we see another huge candle
um do you remember how we went from $6,000 to $11,500 in February?

I think a lot of people got burned by that one, so the FOMO simply won't happen until BTC consolidates for months at one price range
I am waiting for that dip. However all these mini dips don't seem to hold so I'm starting to feel a bit of FOMO at the moment. 

There might be a bigger dip if/when we retest the 9k downtrend though.

I'm scared of another BGC leaving me behind.
I thought we found spoofy buy walls to be a strong bearish indicator, like the good contrarian traders we are here.
I also saw a 400 BTC buy wall (admittedly peanuts compared to the okex) flickering on and off on Bfx (right now, it's off again).

If the next big 15m candle is green, we plow through $10K by Friday.  You heard it here first, folks.

And if it's red, maybe next week.  Bears are trapped but good.
Spoofy?
It's interesting things going on there right now. I'm looking at these quite high-volume candles with very little change in price; especially noteworthy the 23:19 UTC, with 137 BTC in 1 minute, but the candle being simply a flat line:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/1LaLieng/


its back with 500 @ 8164

pulled after a .0157 BTC sell hah
This wall reminds me of the one we had at 6500.

Only if it keeps moving up as the price keeps rising.

Hope it doesn't get pulled. 
looks like somewhere around 1000

the fact that it got chomped right back up is fascinating
probably enough to market buy this to $8350
1046 btc long closed. Same guy that started the pump and is making the barts.
~300 decrease in longs, could have been the trigger.
Hippily Hopitus.
> What happen when ETHBTC tops and retraces, with that going back into the BTC side of the pair, while BTC is already pushing resistance..

Not sure but scares me enough to close out my short while I'm in profit.

Edit: and I'm just uneasy with the price action generally right now (long bullish rejection wicks on the last few hourly candles in particular)

Edit 2: fuck it, not closing yet - will make a decision once this current 4hr candle closes.

Edit 3: haha or just get stopped out instead ;)

Edit 4: that last hourly candle wick and rejection from exactly $8.3K has gotten me curious so just opened the same trade again, this time from a little above $8200 (with stops at just above $8300).  If I get stopped out again, gonna accept defeat and abandon this line of inquiry
Okay this is like the third time I've asked. Can someone explain why everybody thinks ETH/BTC trading (or more general, Alt/BTC) is going to increase BTC's USD price when BTC's dominance increases? The only thing I can possibly think of is some type of arbitrage effect or if people are moving Eth -> Fiat -> BTC instead of Eth -> BTC (which would incur double the fees...).
Thumbs up for using tensorcharts!
It doesn't look like eth/btc is retracing any time soon
We could still easily bounce from resistance from here if we can't break it - maybe not the best time to open a long unless we get confirmation.
So you’re saying this is bearish?  When btc falls, eth falls harder. Well this has been the case of late anyway
Guess that answers that!


https://www.tradingview.com/x/WKgrLc3y/  
https://www.tradingview.com/x/PgEzeoaO
Here we go.

Edit: very nice call.
So what you saying btc is looking to dump? 
Absolutely zero follow through for the pumps or dumps.  

Reminds me of Frank the Tank - "We're all going streaking!" but no one's behind him.
I see two scenarios here

1. the bull whale running this show is using these spikes to get a bunch of shorters and to wipe out any sellers in this range before the next move up
2. the bull trap whale running this show is using these spikes to sell off coins while propping up the price with a huge buy wall so he can sell at $8K instead of $6K
I think I've seen that porno...
dildos are the preferred weapon of choice in this war ego fucking
I don't usually lol at work, but that one made me chuckle. FWIW, if Soros managed to help knock the UK out of the ERM I think he can easily make some pocket money in crypto. 
You feel that way because the number next to the $ is bigger
last time we hit $6000 we went bullish until we hit $11,500 then we dropped back down again to revisit $6500.

And this time we are still only at $8200...we haven't even tested $9K or $10K. So yeah it could go on a run, or this dead cat bounce can run out of buyers to trap and tomorrows 8am pump becomes an 8am dump.
yeah it's stupid. your feelings are merely a digestion and culmination of countless articles you've read that feeds your cognitive bias. Sky is the limit? Lol.
I'm with you til 8800 liquidation at 7180
is it a big amount?
Same opening timing and price, on sept futs.  But on the recent drop to 7800ish I doubled down and got my CA down to 7900.  Plan A was the 8k position, but with a high probability of plan B which was adding down to 7800.  Plan C was eat loss before 7600.  I was actually hoping for plan B to make the position larger.

When I opened my phone and saw the red candle that had settled my bids it was one of those "oh shit" moments of truth but glad it has worked out.  I find that more profitable trades tend to have a moment like that, if you in comfort at the beginning you probably missed the boat already.  Anyway, as I had posted here the other day a few times, I had a lot of faith on 7800 support and preemptively bet on that.

The bart back up from there saw a huge momentary premium and already took half of the profits at 8250, which was everything added in plan B.  The other half from plan A is a profit taking ladder spread out between 8350 and 9350.

Just been juggling the stop loss around for the last 30 hours, which has now been moved up to just under 7800, which would still eat most of the profits.   But a SL any higher, and I may as well just close the position here because it could get wicked too easily.
So you anticipate that we break up?
> kumo break out of 2 hour ichimoku cloud

Does that translate to a breakout in plain language? Pardon but I don't speak TA yet. :(
What settings are you using on your Ichimoku cloud? Here's the 2 hour cloud on Bitfinex that I'm looking at: https://www.tradingview.com/x/4xIp8SwA/

I'm using 20, 60, 120, 30 which seems to be pretty common for BTC.

Looks like you're combining more exchanges, perhaps that's the difference?
Are you using the default ichimoku setting? 

I have it already above the cloud up to the 4hr candle, and just about to breakout of the 6hr. But my settings are 20, 60, 120, 30 accounting for the 24/7 nature of the market. 
Thing is there's big money trading and that overpowers the order book. Personally, I don't see this as manipulated. Just the sign of a very small market.
you will have normal growth when we stop doing the same formations over and over and people stop doing leverage with really close stops.

Seriusly, wedge up, wedge down, pennant up, pennant down, throw some failed H&S and C&H there too.
Couldn't stay away after these movements. I'm on this as well, except I'm doubling down at 8350 with stops 5% over the adjusted CA (over the log resistance line).

edit to add: but I'm throwing around single digit percentages of what you're doing lol
At your scale, does penny's in front of a steam roller become invalid?

Also, I remember my stops failing me when the ETF long gamble failed, have your stops ever failed you on your exchange?
do you use stops, limit stops or margin-stops?
You gonna take this or hold out for a double dip?
high school probably 
how bad is your short underwater?
Lol..  Good luck man.
Nah, it was like this every few days during the run-ups in 2013, a spiky market every now and then.
Huh? Not even close.
you’re not wrong tbh
Bulls aren't exactly setting the world alight either. Every time a dump gets absorbed, the rally loses steam a few hundred bucks further up.
Everything is laughable now
that pattern has been invalidated so I don't think you can rely on it anymore
I too am short since 8100

It may pump to 8200, but I do not anticipate that we will see a large green candle out of nowhere.

That said, it’s dipping a tad right now, so we should hopefully get some action soon.
If history repeats itself, this bull flag will break down for a BRD  and we will drop. 

If you ever see a big bull flag , open a short
Big bear flag, open a long 

( Don’t actually take this advise ( well maybe ) But that’s what’s been happening recently ) 
Bitcoin seems to be approximating a square wave lately.
[deleted]
Yup, my long is open from 6.6 but I'm thinking of opening up another one here. 
They are actually leading last couple a days. Most normal (non bart pattern) breakouts were telegraphed by ethereum a few 15min candles before. Same for IOTA and I think XMR
why risk that when you could just buy a tuna sub?

Anyways, you got balls my man. good luck 
If you get stopped the green candle will be one for the books, a sight to be seen :)
The one that rekt all the bears at once, the BGD that rules all the BGDs
1 hour and we going to pound town. 

Then back to the sky. Rinse and repeat 
Oof. You still think that support will break eventually?
Eh, I've had no issues with Mex since I've altered my strategies a bit. Less fomo and more calculated entries and exits. So I'll use limit orders for resistance/support buys and stop orders for breakouts/breakdowns. Haven't ran into any issues yet, but I've seen how crazy it gets during high vol.
It's just you

Is it just me or do anyone else thinks a lot of the eventual FOMO *selling* pressure is getting stopped by exchanges like Bitmex just dying when more than 1 order per second wants to execute?
I could be wrong, but I don't think BitMex drives the market much at all, it seems reactionary. 
activate ludicrous speed!
bart it's way and break the log..hahha
If you are going to long heavily from $7,950, why would you be holding a short here? 

2.5% is more or less meaningless if this breaks up in the manner you seem to be expecting it to. 

If you'd long heavily from $7,950, my take on the situation is that you'd more or less be just as happy to long at $8,120.
It really sucks that this is the type of post people celebrate now. 

It's really obvious that we have a lot of new people around that don't even understand what TA purports to accomplish. And I don't mean that to shit on newbs. I think the recent influx of users is great, but a vocal minority have really been patting themselves on the back for 'seeing through TA'.

There is no almighty TA indicator that that can accurately predict every little pump and dump, nobody claims there is. 

But to claim that there is *no* basis at all for things like RSI, MACD, or trend lines is insane and shows that you don't really get the purpose of Technical Analysis. 

I say all that as someone who doesn't really use much TA. I don't think I'm smart enough or have the time to learn the proper way to utilize it. But that doesn't mean I'm going to throw it all out the window and publicly bash people who use it.

/rant
Humans hate uncertainty. Hence why we turn to astrology, religion, dilusion etc.
Because you are looking at the wrong time frames. 
TA is working perfectly since the last 7 days.
You just need to learn how to TA
TA is just part of a bigger puzzle, it’s relevance also depends on other factors.

Movement is never completely random though: even whales are human (and bots programmed by humans) 
you can make money if i was really random. you can make money too if it is not random.
TA is more likely to give an advantage than give an answer.

Even if TA hasn’t been helpful with predicting market behavior in the past few days, that’s still helpful. It’s telling you that maybe you should watch and wait rather than take a risk without its advantage. 
TA with Bart and Marge Simpson? just boring stuff..
I think that's usually cause of low liquidity and shitty laggy engine
[removed]
> anything less than 12 h to weekly is pointless to watch.

Pointless to watch if you don't care about money or if you are a poor trader.
And you did that just after closing a short that also would have been profitable right?  You just got double Barted, sorry man.
It's a double edged sword, next time you close it because you are scared it might go down.
same. but you know if you dont feel comfortable in your position its better to cut it than risk it.
I've kept mine but by the looks of it i wouldn't be surprised by another dump. This time though i will stop it way earlier. 7800 won't hold forever. 
yes but only with bfx
Yup.
Was having the same issue. Seems to be back up now.
Refresh, working now
My bfx chart loads but is stuck. Last data point is from 25 mins ago.
I can log in and look at the prices, but I can't get any orders to stick. It gets stuck on a loading circle. 
you gotta use limit orders if you want to scalp. You could have had limit shorts staggered above 8200 for that purpose. I don’t do this, but ai’m just saying it’s how you would need to do things from now on most likely
Actually no, this is what bottoms look like. While I do not rule out bad news - it looks that for now the extreme selling pressure is over.

Now, we do get adoption (slowly) and we do get halving (in a year and some). Fundamentals will slowly win, it will at some point slowly rise and then it will rise and then - bitcoin being bitcoin and having done so repeatedly - it will FOMO BLOW to a new high that may well be 6 digit.
My hunch is the fundamentals of how bots trade have changed, and somehow in this environment it makes economic sense for movement to come in spurts rather than more flowingly. There's really very little volume and even less driven by human traders, our trades don't really move the market much to begin with and the bots have a easy time keeping us where they want things until the next big move.

Ah yes, we have a bull-bear-whale hybrid suppressing price movement. A magnificent beast rarely seen outside its natural habitat in hell.
This looks bullish to me, we should keep going up.

It seems like buyer confidence is returning.

YouTube Crypto "experts" are turning bullish, and noobs follow all this.

I think if we are going up then FOMO will set in a lot sooner than it did on the last run up.

Mainstream news is turning bullish.

The exchange probe news/attempted dump failed.

Everything is pointing up.

Unless China bans bitcoin again, feels like we are overdue. 
r.i.p. in peace
Formation could still be in tact if it double tops
Sorry but what does this imply? Long it or short? 

Please, mi familia
Wow cool, what tool is this? And the other view below that you posted, what is that? TIA
This "market" is a farce.
Wait for the pump to 8500 and when you see longs increasing cash out. 
Feels like Some group is able to swing it by 2 k twice in the past two days. More people need to hodl thru this . 
> Might be time to cash out in protest of whatever the hell is going on.

I think people are wising up...but instead of cashing out, they're joining in (informally). So the pumps are getting stronger and today's started 10 minutes early.

Also of interest is the fact that the latest pump, dump, and pump are almost exactly 12 hours apart. Though the dump timing was likely just a coincidence.
Since the BGC, significant pumps go in at 09:00 and 13:00 CEST, while significant dumps happens at different times. You never see a significant pump following another one, it is always pump&dump.

Let's expect another dump to previous support levels....
It's because CNBC shilled Bcash yesterday
0700 UTC pump started 10 minutes early because somebody couldn't keep it in their pants....
I look one second away and the price is $150 higher. Wtf
9am CET pump... shows the institutional money is pouring back in. Saw exactly the same patterns during the Jan dump.
It's never until it is.
The volume profile looks nothing characteristic of a HS. It requires more than candle stick pattern. Also, the volume is too low/market too illiquid for BTC to abide by traditional TA chart patterns. Even when it was more liquid than this, HS's would have a tendency to break the opposite direction.
To be honest I think there's a very real chance that you may absolutely be right. As frustrating as the market has been lately for us, for whales there's been the potential to make insane amounts of profit. 
This has been brought up - and I think it's probably what's been happening. 

>
it would also mean the entity does not want price/volume to increase as this would make control more difficult

This is a good point ..it really looks like the price is being suppressed after these pumps.
                                                                                            
Research "wyckoff trading ranges" and I think you'll be pleased to learn that you're actually very close to what's likely going on.  Those giant market buyers usually very quickly "distribute" for hours afterward into the fomo buyers.

I was noticing it before we broke down out of a smaller descending triangle and up hard from the support line of it, but you're right it's still definitely in play.
So a 14x leverage can liquidate you with a $10 movement?
I have never used Mex, but what I found out about it from this sub, it looks scam, the kind where exchange is luring traders and then reking them!
1% fakeout on time followed by a dump to screw everyone again. 
Bull flags break down and bear flags are breaking up. 

Are we starting a new branch of TA? 

Bitcoin has no feelings 
The difference is that the previous Bart happened right at the trendline through the Feb 6k bottom wick (as you have also on your chart). That might turn out to be a significant difference, but who knows.


Some guys somewhere yesterday -

'They're calling it the Bart pattern. I know, they're throwing simpsons meme's into the charts looking for patterns and looking to trade on that basis'


Whenever folks see a multi-thousand BTC market buy (or sell), the general sentiment that follows is almost always one of "manipulation." 

"If it wasn't for those pesky whales manipulating the market, the bull flag would have broken up and we'd be at $12,000 already!"

And hey, maybe they're right. 

It would be both dumb and ridiculous to wake up one morning and say, "I'm going to market sell 5,000 btc, because that's obviously the smartest way to scale out of my investment. Yup, that's a great idea!"

If your goal is to sell 5,000 btc at the best price possible (or buy 5,000 btc at the best price possible), you would never do it all at once. You'd scale in or out gradually over several hours.

Okay, so we've established that market selling (or buying) a huge chunk of BTC all at once is a pretty piss-poor way to go about things. So then why would somebody do that? 

Well, it's either because they really are just stupid, impatient, and reckless...or they are purposely trying to steer the market in a particular direction.
[removed]
natural market is a lot of small buys adding up to a flood

manipulation is one whale just market buying 800 BTC and pushing the price up by 1000 in a matter of minutes 
It’s all manipulation.... but that makes us money so I don’t see why everyone complains about it. If your leverage is turned up so high you get chopped on these moves then only you are to blame.
No one knows which is which. The only thing people can say is that MANIPULATION is possible. Other than that everyone is guessing or calling manipulation when BTC moves the opposite of the direction they want.

They weren't squeezed at all, though. Look at the price and when those shorts closed. They closed after the price was pumped just now, and the price didn't increase further so someone had a lot of sells ready in place for this seeing 1k BTC shorts were closed.
[not exactly a squeeze yet, at least on bfx](https://i.imgur.com/IZFHvp0.jpg)
Great call.

Would love to see more explanation.
well spotted
Feels like last Thursday all over again.
In turn a lot of people raving about alt profits will get more people in on crypto in general.
It's funny, I feel completely the other way around. The alt coin scene brings out the worst qualities of the crypto space and risks turning the whole movement in to a shallow parody of itself.

How can professional money, regulators, non-crypto techies and normies take an asset class seriously when something like GRS does 100% out of nowhere? Or the dog shit that is XVG goes parabolic off the back of a meaningless porn tie up. Or the total amateur hour that was Litepay.

That's before getting in to the broken tech behind most alts, the paid shilling, the dodgy ICOs, the secret pre-ICO allocations, the desperate tie-ups with corporations that mean nothing, farcial tps claims, plagiarized whitepapers, fake teams and advisors etc. etc.

Watching the twitter crypto celebs frothing at the mouth for the new alt season pretty much sums it up. No one even tries to pretend alts are anything other than p&d casinos now. It's just accepted that their entire raison d'etre is random speculation (with ETH being the facilitator/gateway to the fun).
It's giving me some more ETH.
That would actually play out very well. The sideways motion after the inverse Bart would lead us right to the resistance line which we would bounce off of. 


I’m not a firm believer in fractals however. 
Wow. I don't generally follow fractals either, but keeping my eye on this just in case. That would be the most beautiful BGD in history.
Barted again! ARghhh.
Doubt and disbelief. Signs of a true recovery.
[deleted]
Who's to say it's not a double bart?
is there a Bort formation also?
yes, buy the neckline so we may dump on you thank you for your sacrifice 
you mean short
because BTC is in a chop, so the alts just run on the bull signal of BTC 


if BTC starts actually dumping(below $7800) then the alts will quickly reverse and start dumping too
Why would they not just trade the Alt/BTC pair?
There are a lot more fiat pairings than there used to be. BTC used to be the main conduit to anything that wasn't ETH/BCH/LTC. Now there are fiat pairings for many more of the bigger players. 
You mean 8200 😂? It cant 3ven break that resistance
except on this run the way it played out was a morning big green candle from a market buy, followed with treading water the rest of the day mostly breaking down by the end of the night.

and this mornings green candle was a lot weaker than yesterday's. 

If this plays out the way it did before, today we should be seeing a lower low. And once that pattern is on the charts, the sell off will begin all over. 
Calling that an IH&S is pretty farfetched.
An IH&S would be a reversal pattern, meaning it would have to appear from a downtrend. The left shoulder would be starting in an upward movement (pump from 7975 to 8200)
I'm not saying it's not going up (i'm long at the moment) but i would count on it being because that pattern.
I see us in a upward channel that will clash with the 8200 resistance tomorrow at the latest, forcing another move that could be a pump to 8400
I don't get it, isn't your reasoning flawed?

 If we break up here and pass through 8200, it wouldn't complete any iH&S as there wouldn't be a right shoulder. We would need to "bart" to 7900 or so to form the right shoulder and then bounce. 

Or maybe i'm not getting something
TBH given these sudden pumps are most probably just market orders triggered by some whale who is DCA's into a very illiquit markjt i find difficult to elaborate a pattern.
IMO, unless a whale moves the price up/down, market will go sideways until next move. At least in the range 7800/8200. It may change as soon as we reach the ATH log line. My 2c.
[removed]
Yeah, it's very different. There's a lot more money in play now on both sides, and no Gox coins being dumped. The dumps are just dudes with lots of money and a grudge against Bitcoin, seemingly willing to sell at a loss just to have the satisfaction of temporarily driving down the price.
yes. no. maybe.

Go back in 2014, come back here, wait for the future to happen and see if it was the same.
How did you know that you had to draw the bottom (blue) line of your rising wedge like that, if the 2 points of contact you mention didn't exist 12 hours ago?

Prior to that, your line would have been randomly drawn line that only touches 6800 at the start of your bottom line?
Bart flag?
All bets are off. We could bgd or brd whenever.
Should I close my underwater short from 7930? 

Asking for a friend. 
Chew, maybe this is a stupid question since nothing can be said definitively about this kind of stuff, but what do you think is a reasonable amount of time to give the market to respond to a pump like this? I guess what I'm asking is how long should I wait to see if we're taking the bait and testing 8.3/8.4 before opening a short?
If you click on "Indicators", the "Volume Profile" should be right there in the left column.

I also like to keep an eye on shorts and longs on Bfx. If you search in "Indicators" for "BTCUSDSHORTS", you will find the indicators for both longs and shorts.


8.2k is the number u looking for (most volume traded above 6k)
Good for him 
How about a run up to 10k instead? ;) or barts for the rest of the year
… Can you take me higher? 
To the place where blind men see 
Can you take me higher? 
To the place with goblin streets…
> In other words. They will take as much money from the small fish as they can before dumping hard.

Why would you expect anything else? 
Or the other way around
Can't take my money if I don't sell.
Your perma-bear mentality has treated you well for the past 6 or so months. But it won't forever. 
> I don’t see why bulls are celebrating

Do you read any news?
This is fine.

This is a bitcoin sub I know, but if you're in alt's as well you're doing ok. Stuff I bought when BTC was at 8300 has now risen enough that at 7900 last night I could of cashed them out and broke even.

Let's see what happens at the end of the week with the resistance line coming ever closer to where we are now. Not that I'm a believer in lines but I think algo's can be created around them.
It's at 8650 right now when charted on bitfinex.
There is another line (the upper red line in the chart below) between us and the log downtrend resistance which IMO is worth keeping an eye on as well:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/CJUkHOsG/

Welcome to the life of Eth holders from last year. 
Once **everyone** is lulled into thinking that then it'll do something different. I mean look at the wick and the bounce.
Hope you didn't open up a new long back up there did you?
It would mean we broke through the ATH log trend line, which should be insanely bullish. I would expect confidence in alts to skyrocket if that happened.
Bull flag and bear flags have made no sense in the last 2 weeks 
are they anywhere near 40k?
Shorts usually go up at potential bear flags, sometimes they are right, and sometimes they are wrong. 
I'm not sure why you cut the wicks, but I think the result should be the same.
Even more visible hidden divergences fail to materialize often, and that one is very shy, so I would not trust it very much.
I think I also see bearish divergences (although also minor) on the 15m and 1hr, along with consistently falling RSI on the 4hr despite a rising price.
My highest buy order is at $7800, my lowest sell at $8200. And the market keeps bouncing just slightly above the buy order and just slightly below the sell order. I chose to find it kind of funny, rather than frustrating. 
*bounce 150 dollars, then paint a bull flag 50 bucks lower*

This is sorta new




With only a 50% chance of getting rekt. What are you guys waiting for? YOLO trades all the way /s
maybe exaggerated 
Depending on how much your position is worth, might be worth paying for the in-flight WiFi.
depends, are you gonna be comfortable holding this position? If not, exit and be happy
Private Equity valuations can have “bart” patterns, but these are not traded on a market. it’s more like one year the company is valued at X and then a coupel months later itms reevaluated and its way higher for whatever reason.

Penny Stocks can exhibit the bart patterns if they are being acquired. You generally have to buy at least 5% of shares of a publicly traded company before making a tender offer. Sometimes the liquidity and volume of a penny stock is such garbage that it’s best to just market buy 5% when the order book allows it.
So buy high, sell low? 
That player might simply go by the name of "market".
Any significant upward movement from here would essentially mark the end of the 4-month bear trend. $8,700+ or so to be exact.

That's not the type of resistance you typically just Green Dildo through. It's likely going to take awhile if it's going to happen at all in the near future.
Where’s your stop loss? 

We’ll resume climbing from that point
I'm not sure whether it is a better strategy, but I've been layering my positions lately. So, if I think 8220 is the true "buy point" to catch an uptrend, I might put 20% each at 8201, 8215, 8230, 8245, 8260.

For overnight tonight, I have a partial sell at 8385, then buys at 8401, 8410, 8425, 8440 - with a partial sell at 8485, then more buys in the 8500's
> okcoin is right at their log trendline

Which log trendline? Can you show a chart?
Is there really any other kind?
IMO its because this pink trendline broke https://www.tradingview.com/x/KTrxNtPm/

The guy on CNBC said to buy it next. Last week is was Cardano and it pumped. In this immature market, something that simple can pump the price. Besides the BTC ratio has been idle some time now. Disclaimer: never bought or sold BCH (except the free forked coins)
80% of the supply is in control of 2 or 3 individuals
thats not a bart, thats a batman...a bart is action where the price goes up then retraces most of the gains, then goes up again, then goes down again.

if you want to see a bart, use the 3 hour chart



Not sure there'd be anybody left to play the game after that
A Marge?
I have plenty of stories like that too... I came to the conclusion that people who went millionnaires in crypto are often just lucky. 

Luck really plays a big role in this. Patience too, of course.
Almost 70%-80% of my past loses are from alts. I have decided to move on and stick to BTC.
Is this the first alt movement since January? 
Could you tell me exactly what made you choose to sell your alts at 34% dominance?
Yeah I kept my alts and regretted it when they weren't moving and BTC was on a run. Now Alts are moving. If BTC goes on a run I'm sure alts will drop for BTC.
The right strategy, IMO, is to trade BTC, invest a portion of profits into alts, hodl ALTS. BTC is usually a leading indicator. When BTC is on a run, the ALTS rise in value only in USD, when BTC cools off, the ALTS catch up relative to BTC, and the cycle repeats.

Edit: In fact, the ALTS do best when BTC goes sideways.
Scaling into altcoins? Altcoins is probably the worst place to be. Based on the BTC dominance, they are proportionately even more pumped than BTC.
> Long term: this shit is a bubble that keeps on popping.

So not a bubble? A market?
Absolutely horrible plan imo. Especially the alts plan. They tend to bleed ratio when BTC drops. If you are bullish and move to alts that I can get, but not bearish. 
What if we never go sub 8k again? What will you do then? Just HODL?
I'm just terrified to see a Lisa. No wait, a HOMER.
yellow hair vs blue hair

Seriously, do you not watch the show?
1000 vs <500$ dildos ; I believe a marge is theoretical 
Marge comes with a BRD, as opposed to Bart. Inverse Marge with BGD. Posted my wishful thinking of what's going to happen earlier today; it shows the compound inverse Bart & Marge formation ;-)

https://www.tradingview.com/x/352nAZhG/
Possible bullish scenario playing out, where we'd probably chop around more in the next few days and test the log downtrend line. Sept-6k log support is currently around the 8.5-8.6 zone with the ATH resistance just above it. There's a chance we go test those in the coming days after today's decent bounce. 

But there's still a large chance today ends up just being a blip in the radar before we continue down, even if we do chop around a bit more. Nothing truly major has changed from my previous posts other than the daily stoch RSI looks slightly more likely to remain oversold and ignore the fact that it crossed.

I'm bought in but if I weren't already I'd be pretty skeptical of doing so now. Same with shorting, neither feels comfortable atm.
I'm not gonna chirp in because I have no F'in clue.  I avoid posting conjecture and only wish others would do the same.
- Market is becoming more confident 
- Alts are easier to pump with their pathetic volume 
- Alts fell harder than btc during the crash 
Part of a normal cycle of accumulating more BTC through pumping alts. It’s pretty much seasonal.
In addition to all of az9393's points, BTC being relatively stagnant and range bound since the BGD has contributed to it.

Expect alt/BTC ratios to overall increase as BTC goes up and probably crash if BTC falls out of 7.8k. Would also expect another BGD if the ATH resistance is broken within the next week or two that alts don't really catch, taking out a good chunk of the alt/BTC gains (similar to the one that brought us up to here)

What if I told you... there is no right shoulder?

https://www.tradingview.com/x/ObVDr2vm/
I have it that it wouldn't be invalidated unless the push is 8200ish or over.
Getting rekt by a 100 USD move in the wrong direction? That's only slightly above a percent, are you doing 100x ?

Yes, Bart confirmed.

I am sorry, what is bart formation?
Id rather see a steady climb
A *lot* of people want to see see massive crash. Unfortunately, the market doesn't work based on what people want.
People have been expecting a massive crash that could send us sub 4-5k for over a month, i'd only start worrying if i see the alts take a dive
[deleted]
Down, up.  Up, down, down.  Up, down.  ;)

Overall higher, trending upish for hours.  Less flat.  Bouncing instead of Barting, more active volatility.

Edit: and wicks show some resistance at the moment of tries of both 8k and 8.3k, currently 8.2k.
Lot of spoofing and whale games 
it was alot of buy/sell activity, nothing else.
see my issues with this 2 contact lines is that you could draw it like this

https://www.tradingview.com/x/fkJp8qtG/

or like this

https://www.tradingview.com/x/5Z9G8bk5/

or like this

https://www.tradingview.com/x/tpLKpaxn/

or like yours, and then when it's invalidated you can just redraw another one. That's why I think two contact points don't make a trend line
Currently looks like it's trying to break upwards from that symmetrical triangle (which can also be seen as a big bull pennant).

Strange, I would have assumed that someone with 69 in their name would have been such a rational mature fella. 
[removed]
you are jerking yourself off way too hard for still being under $8200 after trying to break through for a week 

can this thing still go up? depends on mr. whale, but it could just as easily collapse down...as far as I'm concerned its best to sit things out until at least $8,500 goes down 

3% less gains won't be too noticeable if this thing goes to the moon...but it'll give you a safety net in case this thing really does run out of steam before it hits that 
Angry
Bitcoin: Hold my beer
it probably will, then once it hits $8500 everyone will FOMO back in and the dumping will resume. 
Lmao saying won’t happen to bitcoin , good luck 
I bet it does
lmao ever again ha?
You and all your friends are nursing a huge x50 short convinced that 2k is next. 
No signs, it all starts with one huge market buy. 
at the bottom, all timeframes RSI oversold, shorts >longs, and ppl still shorting
tradingview is having issues
They had an update when I logged in.
The extended arm from the right ear is forming the classic [Cowabunga Bart](https://static.simpsonswiki.com/images/4/45/Bart_skateboarding.png).
'I'm warning you guys seriously take some off the table here. I'm being sincere. It's about to get very bad.'

Still waiting mate.
you can squeeze my long any day.
looks like mike just got out-whaled
No? Guy gets it wrong sometimes too, he happens to just post his trades like most other traders (albiet for more $ value than most here)
Mike has made some solid profits based on some smart trades, and has lost on some bad ones. In no way is he a whale though. He can't single-handedly drop the price of bitcoin by $200.
at the same time there was a liquidated long for 7.7m contracts. If we're being played, it's not just the fish this time
If I recall correctly he doesn't post trades with millions $. He uses M and MM which were explained to mean something else than millions.
I have used 1D log chart (Bitfinex BTCUSD) and the descending trend line that goes down from ATH is still holding. Not claiming it matters at all, but it is what I am looking at and have based the few trades Ive made in the past months on it. It is probably meaningless but lucky me, it worked.

https://imgur.com/a/D92Sk

PS: Will open a small short position with 5% S/L (stop loss) if the line is hit.
Mkay thnx bye. 
What's your target?
Eh?
Yes, as long as btc stays below 9400. Then you get rekt 
Not sure if trolling, but you should be. I'd bail at 8800 though. 
I dunno man. While I do think you have gained position to open a short at 8.1 I don't see the juice being worth the squeeze. What's your target to close it? Granted I'm bullish, but who wouldn't be sitting on a long opened at 6.6? My target is to close it at 10k. I prefer the idea of less trading and big targets. 
I'll be surprised if we're not over $9000 by 11:00 AM EST on  Friday and won't be terribly surprised if we're over $10K by then. Tax refunds, plus payday, plus covering Euroshorts, plus latest Mr. Dumpy running out of coins faster than he probably expected = cha-chiiiing for longs.
Once we get through that, there is a TON of resistance at 8131
I'm curious if someone with enough cash to move market prices has found stop loss hunting to be profitable.  With so many here that seem to follow momentum anyways, it seems like a good possibility at least.
if "they" do end up succeeding. you end up with a bunch of salty nocoiners who will never come back

bitcoin might end up burning too many bridges at this stage to end up with future adoption


my 7 dollar 100x trade just got liquidated nooooo
https://twitter.com/BitmexRekt/status/986646642613989376
Should.

https://twitter.com/bitmexrekt

How did that long got liquidated? 
We will be able to go down without herds of shorts piling up.
It's going to trade the same way forex does. It's not going to be simple. :)
8100.5 checking in
Well isn't *that* tidy. Guess I'll move a limit up to the bottom of the range. Easy trade to cut loose if it breaks down.
where are your stops?

I’m thinking 8275, thoughts?
Thanks for making this.

I can now close my underwater short at 7995 not 8100.
( If it plays out ) 
Jk. I’m rekt 
Exactly. This could potentially explain the "barts", as the trader would want to move the price as quickly as possible to reduce exposure, then immediately unloads position to follow on buyers. 
This is exactly my point. Massive volume is being done on Bitmex, but someone can move the market with significantly less money to benefit their position on Bitfinex. 

How do you know that the dolphins/guppies on Bitmex aren't filling the same Bitfinex whale's positions on Bitmex? 
7.8-7.9 has been holding very strong. If that breaks and you manage to get a short in just below 7.8 it'd be a relatively safe bet to at least go through 7.7. Worst case would then likely be closing at break even.

Opening here you're exposing yourself to the risk that this range breaks upwards and 7.8 holds.
Technically speaking, unless I am in a hedge short position, I am long with my cold storage.

I have no interest in opening a leverage long between here and $8700 or so.
Ya, this up and down fomo is just stupid and a waste of everyone's time.
If I had to give odds, I'd say 60/40 that it's breaking down vs. up. 

However, based on the strong buying pressure we've seen in the $7,800 to $8,000 range, I'd say the market needs at least anther strong rejection from $8,400+ before buyers get the message that they're not going any higher without seeing at least a moderate retrace into the mid $7,000s. 
This is above average effort. B-
username checks out /s
I'm still bearish mid-term, but my impression is that whales are intentionally keeping the price slightly about $7500, just like they kept the price slightly about $6000. That way, they can accumulate shorts and leave buyers available to fomo once the price starts increasing. That's my tinfoil hat theory at least, take that as you will.
If I was daytrading this market, I'd probably be bankrupt at this point.
True! 2018 hodl returns FTW

It's a made up term synonymous with pump and dump.

No targets for now. 
Long from just below 8k and will take profit at 8400 this doesn’t have the volume or momentum to break the downward trend line imo 
that is not what tilt means
what u talking about? he's been having pretty good trades
el oh frickin el.
*Marge
People thinking the worst is over + greed
Yeah I've been noticing that on a few altcoin subs too. A few months ago they all jumped like 2k and have been sitting like that for months despite no increased subscriber rate. Linktrader and funfairtech for example, I check those subreddits frequently and the jump in viewers happened immediately and just never went back down.

I wonder if its an issue with Reddit itself or just some bored teenager with a botnet

Looks like they all, including the one mentioned, have about 1500 'false' viewers.
Sometimes that could also be recovery. Back in January 2017 (feels like a lifetime ago) we spent about 10 days consolidating around $900. Support was $880 and we tested it about 5-6 times, bouncing each time, until we broke out upwards, and the rest is history. We can easily go sideways testing 7800-7900 a few more times and then suddenly go up, not down.
> What makes you believe we will test 9K?

I think the fact that traders are slowly starting to realize that doesn't matter how much they sell, the price is not going down. Eventually, the attitudes will change and those currently resisting this upward pumps will turn bullish and join the rally.

My opinion!:)
To me it looks like the collaboration of bots , stops and somebody pulling the trigger.
I hate speculating on this kind of thing. It wouldn't shock me if it was just one, a few, or many parties trying to incite FOMO but this market is simply too indecisive for traditional FOMO-sparking methods to work. (okay only being ONE person would kind of shock me) It wouldn't shock me if they were bot pumps based off some algorithm(s) kicking off. It wouldn't shock me if it were exchanges attempting to capture more margin fees. It wouldn't shock me if each time, the Bart-attempt was then sold back by the original Bart-er so that they don't sustain too big of losses after moving a couple thousand BTC.

I find the uppercase LOL version to be too hostile.

Moreover, I like how the lowercase lol looks a lot like a guy throwing his hands in the air, which was very suitable to the current situation
oh I know, I meant generally

you should never be 100% in fiat...or 100% in crypto for that matter. 

if the price goes too low, you use your fiat to increase your stack

if the price goes too high, you sell some of your crypto to free up some cash

that way regardless if the price pumps or dumps, you'll have some left over to make a move 

Yeah, and we can't even hang on to 8200. I'm half expecting *this* was the fakeout on the way back to 8K. 
exactly, having skin in the game, means you don't FOMO as much 
In retrospect, getting in at 6500 made sense.  But there were plenty of people calling for 3k when we were in the 6xxx’s.  

ETA - some were calling for 3k.  Some were calling for 2k.
Small short from 7930 that i wanted to close at 7875 but fell asleep 
100x
Yep 100x is pretty dumb 
Could be, but most likely it was on leverage. But even if was 💯 X leverage, then he still lost his margin, which would have been $70,000.  Not exactly chump change.  This guy is either a huge whale or just lost his life savings.  
[deleted]
Well, if you wanted to pump the market anyway... 
Exactly. People need time to forget how they lost a bunch of money and then greed to overpower any remaining sanity.

EDIT: more pithy.
And let's not forget the March run-up to $9.2k as well before dropping sub $7k. 
Maybe for bitfinex. Not so much on okex. This wall is still there as well.
excuse my ignorance, but isn't spoofy on bitfinex? 
Yeah, it's weird watching in real time how the price doesn't appear to be reacting much at all to the action. Even on the 1m graph.
Not really, classic whale move. Market dump down, then put up a buy wall to prevent a move down. Then wait for new buy orders to be put up and repeat the process 
Well then, let the great experiment begin
Where do you get this number from? Longs have only decreased by ~250 BTC in this event (while the 1m candle had a volume of 816 BTC):

The quick answer is that, contrary to what you may believe, btc is the biggest entry point from fiat and has the most pairs in the market right now \-\- meaning with bitcoin you can do anything you want basically.

I made a [video](https://youtu.be/nycEh79nVOY) explaining it a while back, hope it clears some stuff up.  \(Part 2 is cool too\).

just a fakeout
Will it sustain though, only our most recent bear line rather than one from the top. Not really a lot of underwater ripe shorts right here.

I guess we're seeing volume picking up, might have more in it yet.

Amazing parallel, I couldn't have put it better myself.
Lmao
Alternative: need to scare off trigger happy shorters to drop price without triggering another bgd
These are my thoughts exactly. Unfortunately, there's about a 50/50 shot between the two options, so I'm not comfortable taking a position at the moment (besides holding my BTC).
Did you pay for it with Verge?
yes, would deff not bet on a morning pump mañana
Yea but I feel like we’re holding solid and consistent aroumd 7k and now around 8k for long periods of time. Following the massive bull run in December, crypto was an emotional yo-yo for a couple months. (Massive constant movement up and down). I feel like slowly creeping up is a very good sign... I think it’ll lead to a massive breakout UP rather than down more often than not.
Such is life...
Let's ride it together mate. We bought the coins at a good price and myself personally, I am not willing to sell them at the current price, not at all!

My Liquidation is sub 7000.
Not too sure how to define big. As some traders here trade millions, whilst others just a few hundreds.

Mine is moderate value.
Sounds very good mate. Especially doubling down at 7800 and taking its gain at 8250.

I also had any much such momements each time we saw red candles, its been really nerve cracking journey. I could have made already some good gains scalping but I feel more comfortable with a position opened in a safe range with my P/L always in green (except for those few times when we saw sub 8000 price. I set my weekly/monthly targets and I am well on track with these.

I think 9000 is very possible in the next 24-48 hours. More than that, if we are able to make it to 9000, I think 10000 then wouldn't be that hard.

All the very best and lets make the most out of our positions. Cheers! :)

Hard to say.  If we do break upward, the breakout is more likely to fail as it will encounter volume profile node and trendline resistance @ 8400~ right after breakout. 

But I admit I'm very impressed we've held this level here for 5 days I think I was calling for us to move down the whole 5 days or at least the last 3 of them.
Yes. Kumo (cloud) represents resistance/support levels. In this instances breaking out of the cloud would be upward. 

[Take a look at this.](https://imgur.com/oKIfxIE) You can see the current candle about to pierce through the red cloud (resistance).
I'm a big fan of the 24/7 modified settings but no I don't have them on right now.  I have been considering switching to regular settings since I think they have been performing well since december.

One thing to keep in mind about the Josh Olszewicz settings you are using is that he 'doubled' everything except cloud displacement and lagging span.  This effectively changes your cloud from being a 2 hour cloud to a 4 hour cloud, aka doubles your timeframe.  

This is a pretty cool trick for viewing cloud of one timeframe while seeing the candlesticks of another timeframe that I utilize in 3 of my indicators:

Cloud that stays on 2 hour https://www.tradingview.com/script/dMJZeYfr-Ichimoku-Cloud-Stays-on-4-hour/

Cloud that stays on 4 hour https://www.tradingview.com/script/dfNcZiig-Ichimoku-Cloud-Stays-on-2-hour/

Cloud that lets you adjust a 'multiple' variable so you can double, triple, quadruple your timeframe for the cloud etc https://www.tradingview.com/script/fmAbDni2-Ichimoku-Cloud-with-Josh-Olszewicz-Crpyto-Adjusted-Settings/

So when I talk about the 2 hour cloud, what you should look at is your 1 hour cloud.  It will still be a little different than my 2 hour cloud but it will be closer.

I don't use the cloud a lot personally so you might be more familiar with it.  I don't typically enter or exit trades with the cloud.
Por que no los dos?
and i'm throwing around single digit percentages of what you're doing! whales, sharks, fishes, krill.. 
>Also, I remember my stops failing me when the ETF long gamble failed, have your stops ever failed you on your exchange?

Yep. I usually keep my liquidation price a couple of % above my stop limit. 
>do you use stops, limit stops or margin-stops?

Limit stops. 
How short is ur underwear? 
It's not, still holding one that started from 8349 which now has CA of 8196 after some profit taking and adding. Not sure whether to just close now and not have dildo dreams or keep it open, feels like we are due another big drop to me. 
I don't trust moves made by 1 player that faked the hell out of that channel. 
It would not be the first time that type of fake out happened.
I would like the opinions of more experienced traders as i am only learning.
Ever heard of a fake-out?
This. 
lol
I’m just thinking about what chewy said today and the reality is that we can easily meander on through the resistance line and continue to drop.

I doubt we see 9k this month, but time will tell
Yes but my point was basically what you say, people can't buy with big volume so they adapt 
Yes that too, could also explain the barts 
I've thought some more on this, and I think I'm going to set break-even stops on my short at 8200 and remove all open orders until this makes a clear move. I'll just sit on the Sept futures long still and wait. In this case, my trading stack is just my (short-term) cold storage, I guess. The only one I'd be confident in is shorting >8350 if we get there again in the next day or two. 
I'm not generally a fan of taking opposite positions at the same time, but holding 7920 long + 8120 short makes some sense given our ranges. Longing a breakout or shorting a breakdown has gone terribly in this range with fakeouts, especially how deep they've been. This gives a "wash zone" of your choosing until you're comfortable it's not a fakeout. Holding positions on both extremes of the chop or holding no position at all seems like two smartest options. Maybe the latter is better, if I'm expecting a breakout, since I have my Sep futs long position still. 

edit to add: I have no cold storage, or I'd just be out of position. 
Theres fundamental anaylsis and theres "technical analysis". This might strike you, but technical analysis has absolutely zero scientific value. It's like trying to detect patterns in a roulette game or in a slot machine. You know why even professional mathematician at wallstreet struggle to beat the market on a daily basis? Because its nearly impossible. However, im not stopping you to chase those useless indicators.

Fundamental Analysis, as i call it - is trying to detect human psychology in a chart. For example, it was easy to detect greed in the run up from december/January - esp. when everyone was suffering from the penny stock syndrome. That was the only and last clear signal the market gave any experienced trader - sell asap.
It's an evolutionary feature in the human brain to always look for patterns and draw conclusions from them, which works as a flaw in practice at times when there are no patterns
how so?

Sure thing buddy. Just like everyone is only winning at sport betting or online casinos.
Dunno. As a holder inverse Barts (and a Marge is really just a mega-Bart) have been good bullish indicators recently.
and ironically enough, this is the below the levels I bought yesterday :) https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8cts74/daily_discussion_tuesday_april_17_2018/dxiw7v6/ 

That was an elegant stop Bart stop hunt for sure!  Still have my 7900 buy

if you worry for <$500 move you should not trade bitcoin .
scared money don't make none! 
No, next time he won't close it and it will go down
good lookin out
happening to me now again too, was working again for a few min
Yeah, but I like to play it by ear and watch a pump/dump before I decide to jump in... I'll just avoid scalping if I need to pre-plan with limit orders.
Pretty much agree with this. Tbh the more time I spend thinking about it the more I arrive at the conclusion that day trading BTC as a retail user is simply a fools errand. The information asymmetry is too powerful and the wealth distribution too unbalanced to be in your favour.

Related to this thought: I think 2018 is not going to resemble 2014 or 2017. It's going to be a very different, unique year.
could be, could be just another bull trap like the move from $6000 to $11,500 we had in February

I am starting to think so, yea
I think you meant fierce!
that’s what I’m thinking.

I honestly am really pissed that this shit is happening. Things were better before. Now itms just ridiculous
It’s just obscene. And I anticipate it will only get worse
Why does this show that institutional money is "pouring back in"?
I think the price suppression would come from the pumper selling into the pump. In this way, x coins are bought on the way up, 10x cheap coins from the first pump are sold.

What worries me is that I see no reason for large buyers to hold large amounts of coins when they do not have complete control of the market. I think institutions would th8nk on shorter time scales.

If there was a plan to drive the price down again some time, I would pump at the same time every day and then one day dump at that time.

Is there any way for more knowledgeable people than me to judge the volumes involved against the probable percentage of the first pump bought by one entity?

I apologise for conjecture, I just feel that all TA at the moment has one massive event built in. If this massive event did not happen or would be reversed, would we still be talking about the end of the bear market?

Yep i have bet few times against the odd and made it out quite often.
Classic Bart patterns in above image.
Is there any experience of whether a quick ‚statement‘ buy for everybody to see relates to the coins being marketed again quickly at the resulting higher price? 

A slower ‚invisible‘ accumulation, off the book, not shocking the market would seem to point towards getting in cheap and holding as many as possible. The aim being then to hold longer term and build a higher price.

The shockwaves which have followed do not seem to care about advertising what is happening which is worrying. I also think a lot of the movement in alts is people (in my view correctly) stepping away from this market for the moment.

What do you call it if someone wants 800 BTC and doesn't wanna wait for his 800BTC limit buy to get filled?
I exited alts in early March, but I very nearly loaded up on XLM when I saw it <$0.20. It's up 90% in 30 days lol. It's one of the few I believe in as long-term holds capable of going 3x-10x (XLM/VEN/OMG)
big players in traditional markets don't take OTC/Penny stocks seriously either, but those can have HUUUGE swings, often due to PnD's.

Crypto is mirroring that market in alot of ways, just because some joke coins are doing well it doesn't invalidate the legitimate ones.
XVG is garbage but eyeballs on crypto is never a bad thing.  I went to pornhub yesterday to check out the crypto integration and the LOGO had Verge on it.  That's a big deal.  That is the #36 most visited website on the internet.

Bitcoin is not all of crypto and feeling that way is going to make a lot of people in this sub miss a lot of gains, I feel like.  We are making huge gains in alts right now, it is full on bull mode.  A whole crypto ecosystem is developing before our eyes while you guys watch whale manipulated barts and try to predict the unpredictable.
To be fair, everyone is speculating, even professional money. They don't really care about real world use and saving the planet just how to make as much money as possible.

My sentiment is that people start to move alt's when they gain more confidence in the overall market.  Alt movements seem more exaggerated than the big players so seeing money come back to them gives me a positive sentiment.  But like anyone else, what do I know?
Yeah well the same can be said about the bitcoin market and its price movement. 
>I’m not a firm believer in fractals however.

I believe in The Simpsons. They've done it all, and they can do it again.

Like now?
precisely

No way of knowing where one bart ends and the other begins
I was right lol 
Thanks. It’s been a long week 
That’s exactly what he said: “sell BTC to buy alts.”
It just did on gdax?
Well, the question now is, will resistance at ~8150 turn into support?
I don't entirely disagree with you. It's on shorter time frames (hourly) and is clustered among whatever you want to call the formation/range we've been in since the pump from 6.9. I'm mostly just looking at 7.8 holding, resistance right above us 8150-8200, bull flagging right below that. But yes, this could just be chop and we might continue to flutter around between 7.8 and 8.2.
The shoulders aren't massively defined, but we lingered around/below 8100 for quite some time yesterday and are doing so here again. (These are the "shoulders" I'm looking at)
i am not sure that is an "organic H&S". We had massive market buy at 0900 and 1300 cest, check it. This is some big player doing DCA's in my opinion. Illiquid market did  the rest. Dumps are performed by some other player as they are pseudo-random, not at fixed times like pumps. Personally i embrace u/wardser view, we will see another dump later today but unless significantly stronger than the other i think market will go sideways for some other days although in slightly bearish channel.
I drew it after the first point of contact. At the time I had no way of knowing if it would bounce or if it would continue going lower. So at that time, it was not in play, and I fully understand that it was not in play until now. 
If you look at the 4H you can see how a BRD bart could happen.
weird as fuck market tbh
$7,800 to $8,400 is effectively no-man's land.

As we've seen all week, pretty much anything can happen within that zone at any time. 

$200 15m green and red candles have popped up more or less out of the blue. 

As long as the market is within that range, there's a fairly decent chance you'll be able to close at breakeven. 

If the market breaks out of that range to the upside, however, then it's quite probable you're short is fucked. 

If it were me, I'd probably leave it open until $8,500+, but I'm not sure what your leverage and risk tolerance are.
what does *rekt* mean?
What's your leverage? It's highly likely you'll get a better exit point than 8200 in the next couple hours, even if it's not in profit. 
It's not a stupid question, but it's not one with a definitive answer either. 

The market could spend another 12 hours hovering between $8,100 and $8,300 before it makes its next move. 

It could also continue moving up before I finish typing. 

There's no set time limit for a movement like this.
Legend thank you tried searching for it and couldnt find it. Didn't realize that volume had a category of it's own. Quite new to TV just got a subscription so I can use multiple indicators and some of the more advanced stuff. Also so I can make multiple charts and actually save them. Cheers
Ah theres a actual indicator for it. Thats awesome, had a separate chart for those. I have used TV but not to it's full extent but I'm tired of charting and recharting on wisdom so I'm going through the trial to see if it's worth it, which it really seems like it is.
Cheers I'm just looking for the the last 2 years to get an idea of the gaps above and below and the high volume nodes to try and work out where we could be going along with Ichi and a few other things because now I can actually have more than 3 indicators. I have a short from 8450 which I haven't exit yet and was wondering where the longer term gaps where and it looks like theres a decent gap around 5K if we start dropping which aligns with a few other things I have been looking at, providing we don't go higher. I don't think we'll hit above 8400 but I can put a stop in break even incl fees(or give it a few %). I'm sitting happy in short a position with the cluster of resistance above. Got a potential massive win if we break down and very little loss or even breakeven (but I wouldn't be surprised if we did hit 8500 and get smacked back down)
Read that as "To the place with goblin streets"
Correctamundo, Richie.  And if enough people think like you, small fish will be dining on whales like a gigantic school of piranha. It could be one of the biggest wealth transfers in history.  I'm not selling either.  Still buying the dips.
Except if you read the daily, you’d see that I was bullish until yesterday when I exited 50% of my long 

I still have 50% of my long which I’ll close if this falls below $7500
Just keep in mind, Alts go up more when btc pumps, but they also dump more when btc dumps. 

We haven’t had btc start dumping yet, if the bart really does play out on btc, alts are looking at a -30% in one day type of dump 
Thanks Cryptonoo.
Thank you. It's much appreciated.
the wick is crazy. took 5 seconds
No, I am out of position, tempted to open a very small long here but I think I'll let it play out. As Chewy has said, I don't think this gets interesting till we're over over 8.4-8.6 - if I miss out on gains so be it. And to be frank nothing is clear here - it's just as easy to read it as a bull case (dumps getting weaker!) as it is a bear case (pumps getting weaker!). 
You're forgetting what usually happens to alts when bitcoin goes up too fast - Money pours from alts to bitcoin to catch the rise up.
If history repeats, alts would go down on a BTC surge and head back up when BTC goes sideways or drops (a little)  too much of a drop and they go down also.    
The ratio of longs to shorts is more important than specific numbers, I think. Pretty much at parity now which is fairly uncommon and led to pump-squeezes in the past more often than not.
Nope, and longs are still higher than shorts so i don't see why we're more at risk of a short squeeze here.
27,450 on Bitfinex.  Not all the way back to the ATH, but steadily growing with price basically going sideways again. Historically that is still a very high number and relative to the orderbook it is quite high in my opinion.  Leveraged longs are high as well at 28,700.  The bid is a bit thicker than the ask and it is normal for longs to be a good bit higher than shorts (ratio is usually more weighted toward longs than it is now) but really both sides are dangerously leveraged.
/u/joyrider5 argued that RSI is based on close so wicks don't matter. [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8b4twg/daily_discussion_tuesday_april_10_2018/dx4xokv/)

But yes here with the wicks it would be the same, also present on lower time frames but not on the 4h.
true
You find it kinda funny, I find it kinda sad 
33.33% chance.

1. Profit
2. Loss
3. Sideways.
No in-flight WiFi on this one unfortunately. 1.4 BTC at 5x, 56632 contracts.
Pretty comfortable, just afraid that we will touch 8300 while i'm in the air without being able to take a new decision.

Edit: Guess I'll stick it through.
Sorry if you misunderstood my plan but I closed my hedged short from 8320 at 8020. I plan to re-short from 8215 if we get there with stops above the head at 8450, if we break back down to the breakout point I will reenter my short for nothing lost nothing gained.
He's everywhere!
I am Marketus!
Yes, i know, just wishful thinking, weve seen weirder things in bitcoin anyway. 
Oh, and i must add, i say it because the moves pre pump are very similar. 
$8700 is not some magical number which signifies the end of the bear market, the market could have turned bullish from $7k
I'll be honest, it was a bit higher leverage than I should've done in light of my recent losses. Stop loss at 8100. Fingers crossed.
I like to do a similar thing.  Partial sell at 8385, but then if that hits, I'd have buys to refill that at a *lower* level around 8.2 in case we dip.

But I never try to catch an uptrend.  If I think it will go up, I just open up about 50% of a position to not miss out, and then ladder buys for the other 50% below that.


you can just chart it out yourself on btcusd 3mo forward
Fair point.
My best gains last year were almost entirely luck and realizing it, aka to sell. 
I thought that btc dominance remained too low in a fragile market. Btc had a strong bounce and there was a lot of positive news around that time in regards to political risk (governments putting out positive statements about crypto) yet the focus was still on alts. In my view, if btc continued to recover then I thought that people would start to flock to it. Likewise, if the bear trend continued people would do the same. Alts at that time weren't really moving at all and you would just see random pump and dumps. So I thought there wasn't any real volume to be had there and people were just chasing the next pump - kind of like how btc feels right now. 

So in my view, what I saw as the fundamental risk in btc decreasing combined with a fragile market lead me to believe volume would have to allocate to btc. 

The ideal scenario in my eyes is that btc recovers and goes on a run with dominance staying at 45% and increasing. Then another alt run will happen as btc settles. This could still happen but who knows.
BTC is 60% down from all time high. something like OMG is 48% from all time high.

SC 83%. it really depends on the altcoin.


But this is a short term play anyway. im not looking to hold these untill they 2x. im thinking quick 15-40% snatches and back into btc
Depends on the Alt. Really it does.
this plus its a lot harder to get out of them(hence why the price tanks much harder than BTC)

touche. that was pretty dumb in hindsight.
He is bullish, did you read his post?
the point is that the plan doesnt matter. as long as you protect yourself in the short run (tight stops, moving slow) then the long run will most likely be fine
"never" seems pretty laughable at this stage. 

It's starting to look like we'll be below $8,000 again within the next 1 to 2 hours.
probably wait until like 12-13k
A Lisa would not only move up and down, but also jump forward and backward in time on the way up and down...  must be marvelous to watch.


A Homer would be very bearish (rounded top).
OK so they're the same formation distinguished by the size. Got it.
Thank you. It makes me even more confident now. :)
And would you add what's perhaps the biggest of all - that there's a feeling that BTC has bottomed and won't go lower?

If they fell hard on sinking BTC then an end to the sink surely is going to swing that around.

Agreed. I have a stop buy at 8210. Otherwise, I expect us to test 7800 again.
"rekt" is relative. 

If you're trading on 20x leverage, that's ~25% of your trading stack gone if you closed for a loss. 

It's not the end of the world, but that would certainly ruin most people's days.
BART is actually B.A.R.T.  Which stands for Buy Against Reversing Trends. When you see the price spiking and then quickly reverse repeatedly it's a solid TA confirmation of the B.A.R.T. formation.  This formation works best on lower time frames.

Upon inspecting a B.A.R.T. formation the Moving Average Response to Gained Elevation is the standard deviation with respect to the local highs and local lows.

B.A.R.T. formations are typically seen as a breakout from a long sideways trend commonly referred to as a skating.

A new stupid meme.
Eat my shorts, man.
9009le it
I don't want to see it, I am long btc. But unless we get a high volume surge I think its inevitable.
lol just reporting good ol CNBC
Do you think if rejected again we will head back to no-mans land?

My short can only hold its breath so long 
Luckily my short is swimming under water with the whales. Potential friends 
That's an excellent point. I'm still relatively new to TA, so thanks for pointing that out. 
[removed]
Thanks for your tip. I closed the long bought at 8103. Don't feel safe...
Thanks for the info. Appreciated.
What amazes me more is that this Bart TA^TM is getting legit and accepted TA around here. Anyways, its nice to see some humor in the TA of this bearmarket :)
ahh yes the classic CBB, a fairly rare but very reliable continuation pattern

He's still at breakeven on the trade however
He said he had a 5% SL, he should be fine.
My own lines on charts https://imgur.com/a/JYNSX

I see it but its there were other lines to draw, the 3 month line for example exaplains the dildo of the month

-------

april 22nd afternoon maybe be interesting
7,700
It's not going to 10k imo, it would have crossed 9k by now if it was or at least broken the log downtrend. It just almost got there at 8.4 then fizzled out. Not optimistic to say the least. 
Plus two months after Chinese new year etc.
I agree that the high use of leverage and them pushing for less leverage users can’t be good for the long term 
those are just retards using 100x margin 

I'm not talking about degenerate gamblers like that 
I don't expect simple. 

I will take liquidity.
You opened a short? Yeah buddy. I opened one at 8155 as well 
7950 with stops under 7860 is attractive. Alternatively, 7950 with adds at 7820 and stops under 7750 is also attractive. 
Mine are 8220. 8275 is certainly lower odds of hitting, but if we go over 8220 I expect to go over 8300. I'm rolling the dice on getting wicked though.

edit: like that.
Seems like someone who looks closely at the order books on both could go back and confirm if there were signs of this on Mex before each big candle on Bitfinex.
True. You could manage a scalp from 7.8k to support below. I'm still hoping for a longer-term short with all this chop going on, but I'll see how this places out leading up to the weekend I guess.
Feels like a repeat of the 9.1 level
I appreciate all tin hat theories, no matter how wild they may be haha your theory isn't exactly too far out there relative to others.

To me, the market just seems a little shy. IMO once we start approaching the 9-10k range we'll get a little bit more action :)

edit: shy is a bad term, probably scarred from the bear market lol
Happened to me.  Random trades worked really well until they didn't.
Feels awful, man.  
We'll see in 2019, 2020
Ok, thanks and good luck.
if this was a recovery we would have tested $9,000 by now. Instead we are just at the point where there is enough room for people to get greedy and buy because "the move up to $10,000 is going to happen any moment now" 


I guess in the end it doesn't matter too much. I personally want it to be one person/group who gets blocked by a large hidden wall in the direction they want to Bart, and this counterparty just sends the price flying in the other direction. 
OK. So it is now confirmef  li4dy who is causing the pumps and dumps 😂.  Good call on the green dildo
lol
so you're saying i should diversify? not put all my eggs into one basket? past performance doesn't predict the future? be greedy when others are fearful?
its never a straight line down...it goes down, then bounces up but never as high as it was then once the bulls are exhausted it goes down some more

remember last time we hit $6K we hit $11.5K on the bounce and then a week later we hit $6.5K again. This time around its struggling to stay above $8K(I honestly expected it to go up to at least $10K), which means this time around, once it starts heading back down again $5K might be on the menu once the sell off begins.

Basically everyone is watching $7,500 right now and the holders are waiting for another leg up. If that leg up doesn't materialize and this dips below $7,500 we'll most likely see the giant red candle that all the Bart fans have been predicting

How much do you pay in fees? Less than 1% trades are profitable? 
7271 what?
Right now, whales are showing off on both sides: 500 and 1k BTC buy and sell walls are demonstrated and pulled repeatedly. A bizarre event to watch.
all within a min?
[deleted]
Yes but that only effects the ETH/BTC ratio, not the BTC/USD price...? Again, unless we're talking arbitrage as contributing an effect.
Yeah, watching it on the 5-minute it doesn't want to hold just yet. Took a lot of volume to push it up and not much to push it back down.
No my goal would be a new ATH sometime before September... that would be spectacular.. who knows.
That slow rise is exactly why it’s a cause for concern 

The Fomo isn’t getting triggered. Eventually the whales will give up and start dumping. And once they start dumping all these people holding their longs will start dumping Tom 

Word. If it doesn't get up there by the 24th I'm gonna sell. 
Committing to strategy like that is also good.  But I'm not good at managing closing and taking profits like in your strategy, I tend to end up letting it slip through my fingers trying to find the top.

I agree that this could get momentum.

I like to scalp within the loss-free comfort of a winning position if I can get there.  If we break 8400, depending on how things look, I'm considering to add a tad to the position.
> Take a look at this.

Yeah I can see it now. 

> In this instances breaking out of the cloud would be upward. 

Exactly what I am waiting for.

> Kumo (cloud) represents resistance/support levels.

Highly appreciate your informative feedback. Cheers mate! :)
It's nice to see someone with a long term plan.  I've been flip flopping these silly movements and making tiny amounts.
Good luck!
I'm pretty sure he's quoting "the chart guys" or whatever and has no clue what he's doing.

And you were not happy for that buy yesterday, i wish i added to mine. :) 
[removed]
>what is % vs value
Haha yh, that's why it's better to move on instead of regretting a decision, because emotions will affect your trading
Yes, my hopes of 1%/day were dashed by the past few weeks. Sticking to acting on 4hr charts. 
how is that a bull trap?  thats a 100% increase in a month... that's not a trap, thats a lost opportunity if you didn't trade.
Seriously I respect your writing and analysis. Do you think this is the reversal that will take us above the downtrend ? 
Thanks bro
[removed]
Honestly I’m thinking much the same at this point. I’ve honestly lost the faith that I had in Bitcoin as a currency and the blatant manipulation to the price either way has made me reach a point where I honestly regret not just cashing out at the ATH and then never looking at bitcoin ever again. 

For context I’m a relatively late adopter I admit, having bought in at around $600, but honestly, at this point part of me wishes BTC would just flash crash to $1 so I could be done with it forever. 

I did admittedly go long this morning for the hell of it so I’ve not done badly today at least. 
Anywhere I can find those limits of leverage for bigger positions? 
Basically because for you to go long somebody has to be short. 
> If you're engaging with bunk like these delusions, you are going to lose all of your money given time.

The very reason I have decided to stay away from it.
someone who has 5,000 BTC to sell that wants to sell it at $8,000 instead of $6,000
To be clear I'm not a BTC maximalist, it's just I regard maybe less than 5 alts as having any legitimate claim to relevance out of the thousands on the market.
I, also, went to check out the crypto integration, that's it, nice integration, good to see..
I have tried to make this same point before here. I still trade bitcoin and I love the quality of the postings on this sub, but people are doing themselves a great disservice if they ignore the entire alt space and its price movements because btc is the one true coin.

As for whether btc is the best crypto for going global, I'm not entirely sure. Bitcoin was de facto pre-mined by its creator(s). There are cryptocurrencies out there now that had no ICO, no pre-allocations, no pre-mining, have working tech, scale, and have better miner distribution. They just don't have the adoption and aren't used in exchange pairs. I won't mention them here since doing that seems to be automatic assumption of shilling, but it's easy to figure out in an afternoon.
When people visit Pornhub they dont usually spend much time looking at the logo... just saying.
I tried many times to explain to this sub that alts are moving independently of BTC and that is a serious sign of decoupling. Every time I was downvoted as altcoin shill. BTC is manipulated to shit by futures, it's main use case now resembles a poker chip more than anything. While alts are plowing ahead, making partnership with household names, hire great development teams and implement appealing marketing campaigns. Winners will adapt to the new market paradigm. Losers will stick to their comfort zones.
Professional money cares about speculating in a market environment that vaguely resembles norms and baseline rules they are used to. Flipping alts on trex or binance is not that.
I understand the monetary reason behind trading alts (I made more with alts last year than with BTC). I'm just arguing that the gains are long term unsustainable and encourage a lot of useless noise because the whole alt scene is built on sand and eventually the music will stop when everyone realises the emperor has no clothes. For the stage crypto is at now, I think it would be helpful for wider global adoption and bigger inbound money flow if this realisation came sooner rather than later (even at the expense of the "mad 1000% gainzzz").

Crypto needs to grow up if it is to take on the world and win.
A few major differences:

Volume

PoW (with no pre-allocations)

Working tech

But yeah BTC isn't immune to questionable price movement either. Of all the coins out there, though, I think it's pretty much the only one that has the qualities and use cases that might, over time, allow it to graduate to a globally traded asset on the same scale as USD, EUR, gold or oil.
That's why I used the word "sign" as opposed to "guarantee".

Feathers down.
At this point the Barts have become a yo dawg meme.
yep! Easy money today
You mean a short week 
I sometimes consider this my second job
That doesn't effect the USD price of BTC.

I seriously don't understand why nobody gets that trading alt/BTC has zero effect on BTC price (past arbitrage bots responding to the trading).

Say 1 Apple costs 10 Oranges and 1 Apple can trade for 100 Bananas. If the Apple:Banana ratio becomes 1:75 instead of 1:100, it's not going to change that 1 Apple costs 10 Oranges unless a significant amount of apples are being bought with oranges with the sole intent to buy bananas. Now that caveat is certainly the case at times with BTC (and I'm teasing around with an indicator to try to measure that - haven't coded it yet though) but in a vacuum they're decoupled.
break means break and hold, not wick. 
did you realise that just now? 
lol donkaments
Currently about to make a 2 1/2 hour commute and won’t be attentive to my phone. 

Closing at 8500 would put me at about a 600$ loss which isn’t the worse but it’s not delightful. 

May just save the pain and stress and potential car accident and close now 
> rekt 

When someone gets completely destroyed.
What happens when you bought too much REQ, ask someone on ethtrader 
.6 BTC with 5x lev. Honestly just a terrible trade made after I took a fat loss on a long. 

Revenge trading can suck a dick 
So it could go up... Or down... In any time frame 

Mind blown 
fixed ;)
Your belief in BTC is staggering.

Wealth is being transferred to the operators of exchanges, social media 'crypto/TA' charlatans and ICO con-men.

There is nothing fundamental about this 'new paradigm' (lol) that suggests a transfer of wealth from the 'evil banksters' to line-drawing Redditors.

People who are capable of generating wealth will continue do so. This wild-west market--hacks, exit-scams and dubious price action--is more likely to bankrupt your average punter, and with no recourse.

Hoarding digital dollars is not making the world a better place, you just see an opportunity to rise up the food chain without having to do work or create value.

There is nothing wrong with wanting to make an easy buck, but let's call a spade a spade.
u/wardser my friend.

Where do you think this pump loses steam? I’m feeling like we won’t even test 8200, but Bitcoin does whatever the fuck it wants anyways
Absolutely.

If the Alt's dump 30% you'll be looking at sub 6k btc and I think we're way away from that. 10% maybe, but then I'm rightly or wrongly looking back at the bear market and towards the bull.

Very neutral about the whole thing right now despite what my flair suggests.
8175 remains our local top while the dumps seem to be getting more shallow. Ascending triangle? I don't even know.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/amHs1tNk/
It depends on market cycles. On a reversal, climb up, I don't think they would, much more long term holding, and much less fud about them, while on the way down lots of people waited to drop the bags when they could. Also, it is alts what has been pushing bitcoin up. 


They tend to catch up or surpass when BTC meets a plateau, though.
I used to think this was the case until that ridiculous squeeze- it's just really not true. It's mainly order book to shorts open.

there could be a billion shorts open but if the order book is thick enough it could absorb a squeeze. the order book couldnt handle 15k shorts closing so there was a ridiculous squeeze

anyway, I sort of agree with you
Interesting. I'm not very knowledgeable with RSI/divergences, so I appreciate the info.

Set a profit stop for 50% @8290 or so and stop loss in the profit and you can relax. 
Ah, nice little scalp! I'd be careful about shorting from here on out. We have a couple more weeks of tax refunds limiting Mr. Dumpy's ability to drive the price down.
And never ever sleeps!
It would break above the [resistance line](https://imgur.com/a/ulFRN) that has kept the market contained since $20K. 

It's not magical, but it is quite literally the point at which the trend line that defines the bear trend we are currently in has been violated.
For this you must use maths. As long as the higher highs of the markets from ATH follow at total steepness of (log 10 19800-(log 19800+ log 17165))/21 we are still in a general downtrend. 

This on a log chart obviously. 

It just means that, mathematically, we are not following the old trend.
Seems like a decent point imo. But tbh, I have no clue at this point, anything between 7.8 and 8.4 appears to be chop city. I mean, look at the hourly chart.. NOBODY is safe (if you’re a day trader at least). GL mate 
Sure I can, but it would have been nice to save me the time, if you have charted it already. I am normally looking at Bfx only.

But here is okcoin: 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/7dsQuNE4/

Aside from the fact that okcoin does not lead, there is no log trendline of major significance here. The one to which I assume you refer, it's actually below us.

So?

Ah my bad, I misunderstood with reverse FOMO. Yea if he's bullish then dive into your alts seems like a plan. 
What about sub 7.5k?
agreed ;) Just asking what the plan is.

I entered my short and going to see what happens
I hope you're not taking this seriously...
That’s what I meant by ‘market becoming more confident’. 
[removed]
Breakout as in going up or down?
Holding a long expecting to see a massive crash sounds like a sub-optimal strategy. Good luck.
I'm long after holding it underwater and adding to it in previous 7.8k Bart.  SL just under 7.8k.

No telling where this will go, but looks like we can swing around between 7.8 and 8.3 until we get there.  Perhaps you can get lucky and at least not lose on your short.

Moment of truth is if and when we head sideways or upwards into the downward trend log resistance within days, and the november/february support-turned-resistance that is crossing that on the 21st.

At that time pick a side. As we get there we'll maybe see which side is more likely.  But betting on a break up has much better RR right now.  I'd give up on a long and find a new long entry if we go below 7.8.  But I don't have any clear spots where I would want to take the loss on a short, nor add to it.  If this thing breaks up, it might go far away.

Edit: TLDR; tight stops on shorts.
A lot of people seem to have shorts open but not really adding to them anymore. If no one is adding, who's going to sell? I'm currently tethered up but am on the tipping point of re-entering.
My guess is it should't take long before your short will reach dry land. 
[removed]
You held on a drop to 7800 just to close @ break even? At least you could set stops @8045 or so and risk a small loss. We are at the same level as yesterday and should go sideways for a bit until pumping/dumping again 
Agreed. I'm full on bull now.
the alts always pump harder than BTC

they also dump harder than BTC

so if BTC dumps 25% from here, the alts will drop 40-50%
Why I stressed that I don't like to trade often. Even opening a long at 7.9 I felt was good and not closing it til 10k. Obviously going to be a while before you close out, but that's the kind of trade I like. As opposed to closing and shorting on the way to 10k.
Sure, downvote me.  I'm happy taking your money. But I won't give you a job if that's the best you can do, dis-wise.
watched that bounce at 7900 in slow motion
Guess these aren't at imminent risk of filling. What's your game plan? Thinking of just hopping in 1x long.
Do you think this is for real. I was about to set my stop when it pumped, now just watching
anecdotal, but about two weeks ago I saw aabtc in the troll box post his position ($18M long 6780ish if I recall) and then say "watch this" -- and a $200 green candle followed. I think it was 6850-7050 on 4/7. 

It does seem the market buying/selling Bitfinex in between trickle accumulating a large position 10x position on MEX is an obvious way to make a buttload of money in a low volume market, especially if you bank profits each time and don't increase your play. Eventually, you'll probably get rekt, but until then...

It makes even more sense if you have a few whales working together. Basically a 3-5 member $100M+ P&D group haha. 
Yep, I think chewtoy is just trying to play this chop safely and stay out of position until this range breaks one way or another under the (correct imo) assumption that a breakout will be a fairly sizable and more reliable move.
I agree, that's around the cutoff for just about everybody I've come across over the past week. The ultimate whale move would be to soak up all the selling pressure at these prices, pump to 9k and let the market take over. That would take an awful lot to pull off though. I still wonder if they try to making another push up at least, if only to have FOMOs to sell into.
To me the one that makes *most* sense (but it's such complete speculation that it could be wrong) is that when the original party fails to incite FOMO, they dump the coins they just moved so that they aren't screwed.
lol you're a child
yeah pretty much

and never touch margin with a ten foot pole 

the only shorting you should be doing is selling part of your trading stack to buy in lower. 
he didn't name himself coinguru for nothing
yes, you have to provide support so it doesn’t dump further down 
Is this an aggregate number of different exchanges? Because for Bfx the change was only ˜250.

I should be asleep by now, anyway, whats up with 24th?
I always tell people to be fully responsible for their actions and always know what the consequences of their actions will be. This is for certain, that what works for one might not work for the other. At the end, what matters is if you are making gains.

There are definitely more than 1 ways of making good gains in this markets, we just need to discover them if we haven't already, also improvise with time as in a market like this, there is no permanent fix to make money.

All the best for today mate, I will be gone for some time now, will monitor the charts closely. :)
Im only trading on bigger timeframes >1y since else i would get rekt by tax laws. But your saltiness tells me you are most likely just losing money.
Well I was actually, especially when 7850 proved strong support 
Agree with you there, we can't have bull traps forever.

At some point they have to turn in to bear traps. 
That was too fast IMO. More time should have been spent stopping along the way too consolidate/build momentum.
Probably not, I wouldn't get too excited unless we go past the log trendline and see organic growth past there. This is whale games moving us between 7.8 and 8.4 where their orders are stacked

Also don't trade based on what I or anyone here says. This is gambling on internet meme money in a highly unregulated and clearly manipulated market. Have fun.


Bro you're clearly learning and eager to make some crypto gains but like arson said, this is highly manipulated which means newbs like you and me are the ones being manipulated to think one way or another. Seriously be careful and only invest what u can lose, and invest for the sake of it keeping your attention so you can observe and build some market memory
Just FYI: if bitcoin was an adopted currency the price would be so high there wouldn’t be much volatility.

At the moment it’s just a little baby and can be pushed around.

I'm certain that some of exactly what you are saying takes place. Probably a shit load of it. 

Observing and being aware of such manipulation has only ever done two things for me. First, it has helped me justify my bad trades. Second, it has made me realize that I cannot predict market behavior within certain time frames. 

If you don't want the manipulators to take your money when they pump the price to $8,000 only to dump even more when it gets there, then you don't trade that pump, period. 

Chasing price movement in either direction (FOMO) is the best way to lose money in this market, and it's the only tool these manipulators have to use against you.
I also went to pornhub just to check out the crypto integration.
Well what else are they looking at
"care" as in "acknowledge but indifferent/secretly hope that it always stays so that more untrained, impatient money comes to the market each day", or "think it's bad and fight actively to prevent it"?

If you meant the second one, I'd like to tell you about this place called Wall Street.
I'll slightly agree with you.  There are too many emperors, most of them without clothes.  That is my opinion, but that is neither here nor there.  

I think people are getting more confidence in BTC over the last week which is why we're seeing the alts. 
You sound like you just hate alts and group them all in one category of being a shitcoin. Even if "you're in crypto for the tech" you're overlooking a lot of quality projects out there backed and/or partnered with some major companies and investors. I don't deny that bitcoin is still king but I think you're missing out.
Except you can’t lose money when you work an actual job
It doesn’t affect the USD price of BTC apart from sentiment or putting gains back into BTC.

It affects the alt price. In the last months, when BTC would drop, the USD dollar would drop (alt/BTC) pairing. The sat valuewould also drop so you were losing twice. What you can see at the moment is that the BTC Waves are hardly visible in the sat value. USD value still goes up and down, sat value has been largely unaffected which leads people to hope for a decoupling.
I think most people selling alts for BTC will proceed to cash out that btc, since you cant sell many alts directly for fiat.


It has gotten signifcantly worse
probably a good move then. Unless this is about to make a complete 100% retrace of this small pump, it's more likely coiling up to move at least a bit higher instead.
So can overtrading. If the last couple weeks has taught us anything, it's that your odds are fairly good you'll get more chances at any given target in our range. Obviously not guaranteed. If I were you, I'd probably just set a catastrophic stop at 8500 and stop watching it. I mean, I have an underwater short as well, and I actually have adds in up around 8300. 
I never claim to know where the market is going at any given time. 

I make educated guesses based on my past experience and various indicators, trend lines, and patterns.

This approach works for me, but I'm not a wizard.
Might go up to 8250
Seems that way, looking for a quick drop to close short and open long...
Yep alt-boom eventually.
The guy just refuses to post his chart lol
you're not looking at the right one, check btcusd3m
I honestly don't really know what to make of the market action between $6,800 and $8,400. It's really too early to draw very many conclusions. 

If the market keeps struggling with $8,200 though, then it will absolutely fall to $7,500 and probably lower within the next few days to weeks.

We are still very much in a bear market, after all, and there's only so many times buyers will fail to break through resistance before they give up.
why wouldn't he? meme based TA is gonna take over traditional TA. just like the internet and bitcoin
I sold some of my stack during december, rest is secured in my trezor in a safe location and I don't day trade. Its a long term investment for me and I don't mind short term price crashes. I strongly think selling is +EV right now but cba with stress.
Short from 7930 could close now for a few hundred dollar loss, but may just put stops At 8530 and risk it
Yeah, I think I made a few mistakes here. Tired. I didn't think clearly. *Shake head....*
I really don't think Bitcoin will dump 25%.

FYI, check out BTC over the last 4 hours and overlay that with Neo.

Alts have twice the opportunity to go up as well as down. Under their own merit or under the wing of bitcoin. This is why they're pumping and it's a very, very good indicator of sentiment.
Same here, this one seems very weak... thinking of closing it
I followed chewy and went long at 8130.
For real as in we're headed over the line? No. My stop was so tight mostly because I plan to reopen over 8300. It jumped my stop so quickly that it didn't execute (shallow trigger/limit...oops), and when it turned around before 8300, I canceled it. I have adds in at 8260 and 8340, but I wouldn't be that surprised to see this turn back around. 
Yes. This all seems pretty reasonable and believable to me.
Yeah, prob the smart move. I've been doing the same. Thanks!
agreed my friend. I'm viewing this as a 'no trade zone' or no-mans land currently. I'm not in fiat at the moment but i certainly won't be trading anything on leverage with these super weird swings...
lol
I don’t agree with the margin piece. I just live by: Don’t open a long you couldn’t buy with fiat and never short more than the value of your portfolio. I do this with my trading stack, i.e.  ever short more than 5BtC worth and mever long 
more than you could buy with fiat. have only gone against it a hand full of times
It pulls the data from bfx api
Yes but not demand in a direction that influences the USD price.

To increase the USD price you need demand for BTC external to crypto (fiat). To increase BTC's dominance you need demand for BTC from internal to crypto. They aren't the same thing. If there's 10 Billion dollars of fiat total in crypto, that money moving around between cryptocurrencies only effects their relative ratios, not the cost of buying BTC from something external (fiat) to the ecosystem.

Please explain to me how me trading 100 Eth for BTC increases the BTC/USD price. I still don't get it.
I'm looking for PPO/MACD bear divergence to show up around/before then if we don't make significant higher highs by then. Look at the bear divs on 4hr back during the last touch of the falling log line, we had lower PPO's with higher highs, this looks like a similar setup
[deleted]
Thing is, at this point I genuinely cannot see that happening. Bitcoin doesn't have anywhere close to the required capacity and lightning network, whilst an interesting solution, is far too complex for the average user. Not to mention that the things that make Bitcoin awesome for us don't really apply to other users.

It reminds me of the whole "Year of the Linux Desktop" talk you see elsewhere - Linux is absolutely fantastic for a subset of the population, myself included, but that doesn't mean that I can realistically see it getting mass adoption. 

I'd absolutely love to be proven wrong of course. 
I also went to pornhub just to check out..
"care" as in worth their time to trade in.
I cut my teeth on alts and made most of my 2017 profit with them. I just didn't dream the shit pile would continue this long. At some point the smoke and mirrors will stop working and then crypto can actually graduate to the next level. BTC will be there and maybe < 5 others. The rest need to die along with the circus of sharks and vested interests that birthed them.
Yes, that's exactly what I was saying with my caveat and the indicator I'm teasing out. People selling alt for btc then selling that btc for cash obviously effects the btc/usd price. But in a vacuum if you trade alt/BTC back and forth the btc/usd price doesn't change. Whales moving btc into alts doesn't effect the btc usd price unless the btc they traded for alts then gets sold.
I dunno man, I'd listen to crypto_investor7. He's much smarter than the first 6.
interesting
This would be infinite times easier if you just showed us what you're looking at. 
Ah, you sold on the lower end of our range, that wasn't a great entry to be honest.  Since I've been a believer of 7.8 support, that short you have is/**was** only potentially worth a small scalp to me.

It's probably not such a gamble to target breaking even.  You could scale out for small loss. 

Probably a big risk to expect anything more out of it.

I wouldn't put stops at 8530, that's a big pointless loss, I could consider scaling into a new short there though.

Up to you of course.  If you close it now because of my own sentiment, we both know that means the price will plummet on next candle ;)
Been in your situation before and did the same. When you see a big loss and have to endure it for hours/days it can take a toll on you and you just want to get away and relax. I was prepared to lose money yesterday so having a chance of not losing as much today is not so bad. 
BTC dropping 25% would put it back in the $6,000 range. 

so not too far fetched, considering the bounces have been weaker and weaker, first time we hit $6,000 we bounced to $11,500. This time we bounced to only $8,400 and its already looking like its running out of steam. 

and alts pump when BTC pumps or BTC stays steady. The second BTC starts dumping, alts will start dumping twice as hard as everyone tries to get out when there is limited buy support to absorb the sells 
who knows man. shoulda closed at 7900 ;)
Same, holding bitcoin currently, hoping for a future short opportunity haha. I think this is going up in the short term, but I'm not gonna be left holding the bags if it dumps. There is infinitely more downside than upside at this point.
how are those nano bags
the problem with margin is that you are always at a whim of a flash crash

if I wasn't on margin I would still have 45,000 ETH, all my positive margin trades got wiped out by that one event.

Its basically another case of not having 100% of your stack on an exchange. The risk of a flash crash is just as low as the risk of an exchange hack, but its still a very real risk in this game 
Then either Tradingview or your tool has an error in pulling from the Bfx API.

There is a limited supply of BTC out there. When some of it is 'consumed' supplying ETH holders who convert to BTC after the fiat price of ETH has risen, if they don't then immediately convert all of it to fiat, it becomes unavailable to trade for fiat. Assuming constant fiat BTC demand, an increased ETH->BTC demand reduces the supply available for those wishing to purchase for fiat. This raises the price.

This is not really an arbitrage effect.
Keep me posted with it mate. I think I will also be closing my position around the same time to close the month.
I dont care if its your only source of income or not. Anyone who invested anything in cryptos 5 years ago had made a fortune today.

I was answering to the guy who claimed TA was working "perfectly" since the last 7 days. Which is just plain bullshit.
It has mass adoption. Just not as a desktop.

It's on almost every server and most phones.

Even Microsoft hosts linux and has its own linux distribution.

Bitcoin will win, we just won't notice it. Just like linux has won.
This exemplifies my point: pornhub partnered with XVG for some quick easy press (which apparently worked well on all three of you). XVG founders set it up so they could get a nice pump on their shit coin. That's it.

Nothing wrong with that. It's just meaningless in terms of the bigger picture and will be forgotten in a week or two.
Just wrote and deleted a long winded thought process about apples, bananas and oranges. In that time i see we’ve taken another direction upwards.

Im going to put some fruit in my next drink and see what happens next.
I somehow just managed to accidentally close it anyway for a fat loss.

Kraken fucking blows. 

Sitting out of position for now as i will sleep angry 
i wouldnt know i dont hold nano. 
ok, that’s a good point...

You... lost... even anywhere close to 45k ETH? Even 450 ETH would piss me off something gnarly.

that’s .... insane. And why I only trade with 5 BTC
Ouch. Can you elaborate on what happened if it's not too painful?
Okay, so you *were* talking arbitrage effects (like I mentioned in the first post).

If we start going into arbitrage it's a much more complex discussion and I don't think it's quite fair to say that moving Eth into BTC is definitely going to cause arbitrage of fiat moving into BTC. It's definitely a possibility but I'm not sure how strong that movement would be and there's many other directions of flux possible as well.

You're assuming the BTC supply for ETH and fiat are the same pool. I disagree. Those willing to sell BTC for ETH and those willing to sell it for fiat are not the same. The BTC being "consumed" by trading for ETH was already not available as supply for fiat traders (at least, not any more available than it still remains after the previous ETH holder gets it).
> I was answering to the guy who claimed TA was working "perfectly" since the last 7 days. Which is just plain bullshit.

You realize that TA isn't some monolithic thing? That when you view TA it does not mean another person is looking at the same metrics? Your entire argument is predated on your perspective of TA; which apparently is woefully inadequate. That is not equally true for everyone. 
Thing is, that to me seems more like an argument for blockchain to succeed, rather than Bitcoin. I could absolutely see blockchain technology being very important in the future, but Bitcoin, not really. 
lighten up my guy. it was a joke. wife's home from work today so I didn't get to check out the crypto integration.
didn't buy xvg for the pump and dump but I wish I did. was too worried (and still worried) if BTC is going to shit the bed again
Ah feck.  Sorry dude.  G'night!
lol
you sold at a loss then
Yeah I got fucked. 

But this was a while back, before the first EEA, so it “only” cost me $300K

Still a hard hit, especially after it went on the bull run 
There was a cascading flash crash on eth on polo and then the system was unusable, couldn’t trade, couldn’t move more collateral and everything got market sold at the bottom.

My TA is restricted to general market sentiment on longer timeframes. Anyone who is claiming to predict those short-term random pumps or dumps based on any kind of TA is straight out lying. Its gambling and you know it.
Sorry dude. I'm in a grumpy mood today :)
Uhh I've never sold lol and i got in mid last year so do the math. I've switched my positions but never sold at a loss
Wow, sorry to hear that. Was it directly related to this? https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mbjyk4/heres-how-traders-lost-millions-in-the-first-ethereum-flash-crash
Yep, fair enough. Sorry if I came off as crass, it's a pet peeve of mine when people think that alt/BTC flux favoring BTC means BTC/USD is going up without clarifying it as due to arbitrage effects (which I now understand is what you were talking about).
Arbitrage: Assume ETH/BTC, BTC/USD, and ETH/USD are all in equilibrium. If I trade around the triangle I end up with the same amount  I started with.

Now, say I sell 100 ETH for BTC. In response, ETH/BTC goes down, but BTC/USD and ETH/USD remains constant. It is now favorable to perform a triangle arbitration. A bot could (and they do) try to force the market back into equilibrium by trading ETH -> USD -> BTC -> ETH until the opportunity closes, gaining a little bit of ETH every time since the ETH/BTC ratio is low in relation to the other two ratios.

So that's arbitrage. However, it doesn't have a 1:1 effect in that the 100 ETH traded to BTC doesn't have nearly the same effect on the BTC/USD ratio as trading the equivalent amount of fiat into BTC.

What he's describing, ETH -> BTC flux removing supply from the BTC side of the BTC <-> USD relationship, is something completely different and I believe
based on a flawed premise.
> My TA is restricted to general market sentiment on longer timeframes. Anyone who is claiming to predict those short-term random pumps or dumps based on any kind of TA 

Oh wait is that what we are arguing about? If so I agree with you entirely. 
No need to apologize. We all have our days. Don't let it affect your trading ;) Cheers
Sure bud
No it was about 4-5 months before that

Ethereum was still considered garbage then 
lol i mean whatever, i dont care if you dont believe me or not. i only posted to your comment because i love perma bears getting btfo. maybe ill eat my words and the market will dump, oh well it has to drop quite deeply for me to touch my initial investment.
