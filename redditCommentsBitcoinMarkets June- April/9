Alright guys, here’s my tinfoil hat theory:

Whales love liquidity. This allows them to fill their bags before pushing price in the opposite direction.

At $6k, it seemed everyone was selling in sheer panic since it seemed we would never find the bottom. At 11.8k, everyone was buying since we had a “breakout” and the market crash seemed over and past us. At $6.6k, everyone was selling and waiting to buy at the double bottom of $6k. At $10k, everyone was buying again since they thought that the bear market was over, and that a break of $9.8k meant we would go straight to $10.2k. Now, we have this huge triangle on the weekly everyone is passing around, with a bottom of around $7k-$7.2k. While we have dumped a great deal from $10k, longs still greatly outnumber shorts, and people seem to be patting themselves on the back for predicting the bottom weeks ago.

If whales love liquidity, why would they dump all the way down to where everyone was planning to buy in order to allow them to fill their bags? I would want to induce panic so that everyone else could fill my bags. I would then push the price back up, liquidate the overleveraged shorts, and get people who sold to FOMO back in.

Maybe I’m just reading the sentiment wrong here, but it seems like most people feel they successfully bought the dip, and are now waiting for others to push the price back up for them.
I am sorry for late response. longass meeting

Heres the article: http://ilyo.co.kr/?ac=article_view&entry_id=298282

TKDR(Too Korean Didnt Read): crackdown on fraudaulent activities of exchanges(like new coins listing insider info, exchange not actually buying/selling coins just showing the balance) and fraudulent ICOs
mods wake up please. this financial situation is unsettling enough. 
For anyone opening a long or closing a short, this is the line to watch for an upside break before doing so:

I exited my short a bit prematurely at $7,500. 

I'm not going to reopen it, but so far this bounce from $7,300 is a big ole nothingburger unless buyers can break through resistance.
I know the focus of this sub is mostly short term/medium time frames, but thought it would be interesting to see where people predict we'll be in say a month from now.

Full disclosure, I currently have an underwater long from $8,200 on the June futures. Those contracts don't expire until 6/29, and I'm too stubborn to take the loss right now, so I'll probably bide my time and hope for things to turn around
The price action to me over the last few weeks suggest that the average user is all but gone in a meaningful way for this Market. A lot of people where talking about getting the price up to 10K and letting the noobs take it over and shorting on the other side somewhere but when the Baton was passed the noobs didn't pick it up but looked at it and just let it fall where it May. I don't think we'll see a Resurgence of new buyers into the crypto space for quite some time. I think the only growth that we will have will be for people who have steadily been buying for the initiative using Bitcoin and other cryptos as an investment vehicle. A more volatile place to stick a small percentage of their funds in order to see either overwhelming growth or a loss hardly missed as it's not nearly a sizable portion of their portfolio the cost of doing business. In the end the price should continue to rise as the technology is sound it will just take some time and I think maybe a year from now give or take 6 months we'll see the slow inklings of a bull run that builds up to the levels we saw the end of last year.
My view on this: we just rejected the support turned into resistance line. Volumes of little bull run were relatively low. So, the furhter potential bull run towards 8k had to have more decisive volume and steam. This may tell us that in last 12-16h, people, who missed mass shorting was just waiting for better entry at resistance levels\lines. 
What's next? For ones who wants to long, I'd wait for 7k, which is our next target in a week. At these levels I am expecting massive support from bulls, and maybe in a 2-3 weeks we may see again 8-8.2k just to play out that gigantic wedge and retrace from there again. For bears, who are already in greenish position, I'd recommended to wait for 7k to close it.

p.s. edited link
Closed my short at $7,500 for a small gain. 

Edit: 4h macd is about to see a bullish cross, and buyers seem determined to keep banging their heads on the ceiling.

There's likely to be a push to $7,800 at some point in the next few days that will offer me a better entry. 

If buyers lose steam around $7,600 again, I'll reshort there. If sellers take over and push below $7,200, then I'll reshort there as well. 
Just have to get this off my chest - not *if* but *when* we start the next bullrun, I better not see any one of you bitching about "oh maaan why can't it dip one more time I need to buy back in" or I will come through your printer and throttle you.
So it seems that the "good entry and ride trend" following days are over. The strategy now is to do bigger positions at the right horizontal point, then always lock in profits after a 2-3% move and repeat.

Yes it's quite boring and no adreanlie rush added but the slow and patient game could increase your stack with at least 10% if you protect the downside
Back short from $7,430

edit: I really should have never exited in the first place. The market is still respecting [this resistance line](https://imgur.com/a/DC3XGXN), and this morning's small pump to $7,500 is really struggling to make continued headway to the upside.

This is one of those cases where I should know very quickly whether it was the right move. Which is my preferred method for trading. if the resistance line breaks, I can exit for a small loss. If it holds, I can see how far down sellers can push it. 

Getting into a position during short-term price consolidation is always tricky. Even if there's a decent fall here down to $7,200, it's likely I'll wind up closing near breakeven for a small profit on a bounce. This is going to continue for me (and for anybody following my trades) until there's more clear short-term direction. So apologies in advance if it seems like I'm being manic again.
it would seem as though the market has decided that 7500+ is too expensive and 7500- is too cheap.

hmmmmm
I've got to stop cheating on the goals I set for trades, I keep getting greedy and then it burns me.  Latest pair were 1. not closing my LTC futures contract at 50% or 60% (two separate bumps, both hit target), and now it's finally in the red... and 2. Opening a scalp 5x long at 7500, not closing with multiple opportunities for 10-15% (which was my target), and am now in the red again as well.

If I would actually take profit when I hit my targets, I'd be doing a lot better. 
Added $1mm @ $7322 to my $1mm long @ $7700 posted [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8lpstw/z/dzhjdqv)


Bid filled during the drop while I slept. Position is currently $2mm @ $7511. Still expecting a 3-4% short term bounce. 
It only takes 24 hours for the tenor of this board to change.  I love it.

The sell off is beginning to slow just slightly and shorts are closing in apprehension.  I still think we'll see $7k before this is over but it may take 3\-5 days to manifest.  $7030 would put us at the bottom of the pennant that everyone is watching and place 1D RSI neatly at 30 \- all of these are prime conditions for a reversal.  Shorting against the bottom pennant resistance along with oversold conditions would be ill advised.  Rather I'd wait for confirmation of a reversal or the pennant breaking down.  I believe we'll see a lot of consolidation in this range as the market figures it out, with a resolution in the first week of June.

In the interest of fractal symmetry and edifying the above claims, I was curious to see how similarly the drop from March 5th at $11.7k has mirrored this most recent drop from $10k.  When the bar patterns are overlaid and stretched to the constraints of the wedge, they are very similar.

[**Check it out**](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ABbOV0z4/)

In my view, the termination of this large pennant on the daily will dictate the next long cycle, and if all you did was wait for termination \(either breaking up or down\) and placed a bet in either direction you'd likely see a $3000 delta in your favor over the course of a couple months.

If we do test the bottom of the pennant in the next few days \(seems likely\), we'll be doing so in different conditions than early April.  It's been mentioned here before, but the overabundance of longs still on the books creates a liability at this intersection where market makers may attempt to force price below the line and create a cascade of sell offs as underwater longs finally capitulate and exit positions \- long squeeze.

There is no certainty of a long squeeze however \- the low volume and large symmetrical pennant on the daily is not indicative of a bear market, rather it's indicative of an undecided market.  Too often people extrapolate local trend too far into the future.  The most sturdy recent trend we've seen is price vacillating around $8k \- high lows and lower highs.  To this end, I wouldn't be surprised at all to see price drift back up towards $9k in June.

good luck everyone! ill be on the sidelines for now. i don't want to jump into any trades i cant keep my eye on. Bull or bear lets be happy we have some volatility for us traders.
This is my first time ever with tradingview so it may be huge bullshit, take this with a huge pinch of salt.

I drew a resistance line from the almost 10k high and a support from the low of April 1st. The resistance line has been breached once but today acted as resistance again as you can see it on the chart. My question is that could it act as a resistance again if it has been breached in the past?

**8:40 EST.** Europe dumped slightly last night. New York ate it back up slightly when they Woke... The U.S. starting the day long, I'll follow... for now.  
  
Edit: I’m long from 7,400
Short opened at 7500 10x lev. I think we're heading to a triple bottom when looking at the last wave on the 6 months chart. Presuming 7200 wasn't the bottom.
So not great with Ichi but here goes. Weekly has had a bearish TK cross and the cloud is unbelievably thin. We are above the cloud but if we don't go up or close at this price in 2 weeks time we will be below the weekly cloud which would signal a weekly short play. Your may not get a pullback for an entry before we make a new low IMO if we break below the cloud. TDI is showing a weekly short play. BBANDS look bad we got rejected from the middle band after breaking below and now they are starting to squeeze. We should at least visit the bottom band. RSI is at a support level that if we go below it looks pretty bearish and is pretty bearish anyway. some other oscillators are showing slowing of the selling but we are also below the 50W MA which really is bad especially if we close below it Sunday.

3D just looks bad all around...

1D TDI  is on day 4 of a short play. We're below the cloud with a bearish TK cross and a breakdown out of the cloud. I think we actually have room to move up on the daily if we push down a little more over the weekend but I wouldn't be looking at a long term long entry (or to exit a longer term short) until the longer timeframes start picking up a bit. OBV bearish divergences if you look at the 6K low to now.

4 Hour looks like it can move up but I don't see that in the price action. It actually had textbook short play on the ichi that is showing signs that you may want to exit that trade but if you played that your better off just sitting in that position until this all blows over. Looks over extended but if you remember the bull market things can stay extended for a long time.

Buyers beware at least use common sense if your going long in this market.
So just tried out coinbase pro coming from gdax. Can't see a single new feature that they added? Just seems like they changed the layout for some reason and made it a little worse \(takes a few more clicks to get places\). Obviously the colors are a bit different too. i can only imagine that the reason they did this was because they are planning on added ERC 20 coins as has been a rumor for a while? 
Well, this is kind of old news, but was just looking at it, and that 200 day moving average proved to be a bitch of a resistance for the last couple of months. It is interesting how the rallies in that period reversed exactly at the 200 day MA.

First, the rise from $7.240 got stopped at $8.905 on March 21st. 

Then, the BGD induced rally got rejected at $9.767 on April 25th, for the price to fall to $8.600 levels. 

BTC soon gave it another shot, and again reached the 200 day MA on May 5th, only to be rejected right at $9.990, when the current 20 day downtrend started.

Makes me wonder if the "10K psychological limit" was the main reason for this last rejection, or it was primarily due to the fact that the strong resistance of the 200 day MA was at that spot on May 5th. 

Daily linear chart (200 day MA is the blue line):

It feels like a foreplay 
Im currently a very excited bull, ready for the call to defend the 7200-6800 zone, but if we fall through 6400 then my courage and excitement will likely turn to uneasiness and confusion.

Good luck friends.
An ascending trend line has established itself since the local low at $7250.  It'll meet up with the descending trend line here in about 8 hours, and the market will have to make a decision.  I don't trust buyers here much, but there is a chance this will break to the upside and provide a little relief for the anchored RSI.  If so, I don't imagine we'll get much higher than $7775 which is both resistance area and 0.618 fib retrace. Right now 4hr MACD is flirting with a crossover... but as a lagging indicator it won't be confirmed unless we get a real break to the upside here. 

Alternately if we drop off the ascending trend line, it'd be a good place to short.  TP for either scenario is \~$7050

**Position Bot update**

* Changed the bot to use this account instead of my main account.
If anyone notices anything strange let me know. The main problem should be someone closing a position with an extended justification and no comment appears on that post.

* Fixed an problem on the RSS feed, it now validates completely.

* Anyone wanting to be notified by MikeXBT or \_chewtoy\_ position changes can install the app Pushed. This app gives real time notifications. Just install it and search for the channel Position Bot.

* Will be implementing the !subscribe, !unsubscribe, !subscriptions and !followers. For now this will be used to see which users have more people interested in following their trades to add to the main list. After that is implemented i'll try and create more channels to allow notifications to be sent from the Top 5 and Top 10 users or something like that.

* On the History page, clicking on the Pair column shows all the details from that position

* Am working on a mechanism to validate positions by checking Spot price at the time of the submission. For most exchanges i'll get the last 15m candle and the price indicated must be between the minimum and maximum prices for that candle. Will record the average between Open and Close as Spot price to later add it to the details. Positions that pass this validated will have some sort of icon or indication on the list

ToDo: 

* Clean old positions from the page after checking with the user that opened the position. 


As usual, suggestions or bug reporting are welcome
My technical analysis opinion here: it's strange that despite the surprising show of volume on dumps vs the lackluster volumes on our rallies on larger timeframes, people in the crypto sphere continue to be optimistic about, what I would call, the technical rallies. It's almost as though the adage is true, that it is human nature to be optimistic, and when translated to market behaviour, are more likely to go long than to sell short. 

This current rally, in my opinion, is a technical retracement from our drastic drop over the last 3 days. Bitcoin lost 15-18% of its value, and Ether lost 22%. Price action downwards had gone parabolic with increasing volatility (suggesting short-term capitulation and some people shorting the bottom), time and momentum indicators on the shorter timeframes (from 4Hr to 6Hrs) pointed to a possible correction upwards, and EthUSD had broken down from its small head and shoulders formation and met the point and figure price objective for that break of $530+. 

We are now forming an obvious rising wedge formation on the 4hr and 6hr charts. This is very obvious on EthUSD, less so on BTCUSD because BTC's rally is much weaker. I expect the price to break down soon, and there are two possible scenarios for BTC after a break down (both bearish):

* Revisit the local low of 7200 on low selling volume and churn there for a bit before rallying to a higher high of 7800-8000, creating renewed optimism and trapping more buyers, before resuming the drop to 6.5k

* Break from the wedge and sell off to 6.5k

There is of course a third option, which in my opinion is extremely unlikely, and that is we rally from here with increasing volume, or trend sideways before rallying to higher highs, suggesting a new bullish trend. 

There are several reasons for my bearish outlook, some technical, and some related to the fundamentals of this market. Number 1 being that on this recent drop, many other alts have revisited previous lows and formed obvious descending triangles on larger timeframes (LTCUSD is a very good example), which suggests that future price action will be more likely to occur to the downside. Because BTC and alts as a whole have a tendency to move together, BTC is likely to be affected by price drops in other major alts. Number 2 has to do with the low volume on rallies across the board, which suggests a continued decreasing interest in this space. Fundamental reasons include the rampant fraud that goes on in this space and which continuously saps money out of the cryptoeconomy, the large presence of naive investors who are overly optimistic and continue to gamble on pump and dump alts without being capable of understanding the tech (there are plenty with a poor command of english and who can barely read the whitepapers), and the increasing coordinated action of regulatory agencies around the world to suppress speculation in this space.

My strategy for this market is to sell short on rallies, because i believe there is still very good money to be made on shorts. For example, my price target for ETHUSD, based on fib extensions and traditional TA, is at a low of $60. To many in the Eth community, this would seem like a ridiculous call. As for myself, I am unsure as to what event would cause such a drastic drop, but based on the fraud in this space related to projects and possibly to exchanges, or even the possibility of Eth being classified as a security by the SEC, I would imagine any number of reasons could cause this price drop to happen. 

As always, my advice is to play safe, not get over excited on intermediate rallies, and to not invest with money that you cannot afford to lose. If you are not comfortable with shorting, it is always possible to protect your capital by staying in fiat. 

Good luck everyone.

went 50% in fiat and holding long positions (alts); will add more if btc breaks the resistance to continue the bull run;

wouldn't be surprised though if btc will remain within this triangle until the very end (July/August)

https://imgur.com/a/M56WvjG

edit: considering how little effect all the bad news from the last 2 or 3 days had on the market, btc might test the upper resistance soon
So CME futures have expired now. Can someone explain what the different columns mean?  
http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/us-index/bitcoin.html
https://www.sifrdata.com/cryptocurrency-volatility-index/

Does the crypto volatility index have the same interaction with crypto prices that the S&P 500 and VIX (volatility) has?  https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-theory/08/volatility.asp

> A high reading on the VIX marks periods of higher stock market volatility. This high volatility also aligns with stock market bottoms.

The highest crypto volatility was Feb. 11 and this would put the bottom in crypto at the same time roughly as the Feb. 6 BTC bottom at ~$6,200.  If you switch their index to BTC, the highest volatility matches exactly with the Feb. 6 bottom.  Volatility is now at an all time yearly low instead of all time high like in February.  This seems to imply to me that the bottom has already passed long ago and that the market is about to experience another December 2017 level of explosion.  The previous volatility low was December 5, 2017.  The total market cap was $357 million on that date (currently $331 million) and BTC price was $11,900 (currently $7,400).
On my chart, I see a ton of cascading resistances.. Let me see if I can articulate it:

1) the immediate downtrend line from 8.6k, which we need to clear 7.6k to breakout

2) the downtrend line from 10k, which we need to clear 7.8k

3) another downtrend line passing the 9.7k and the last local high at 8.6k, which we need to clear 8.3-8.4k

4) if we make it through all that, we have the ATH downtrend line capping us at around 9k

All that crap and the potential upside is only ~20% (I bet you guys make that scalping all day).  I mean, I've seen the market do crazier thing, so who knows, we might make a new ATH by years end.  For me, I'm just gonna go to sleep and fully expecting to wake up to see a BGD or something crazy. (I'm flat since roughly 5/12)

Closed my short at around $7,410 a moment ago for pretty much no gain.

I don't know what the fuck is going on here, but I don't like it.
Some hopium:  volume in 2017 didn't really pick up until late summer

If we manage to bounce hard off 7k, break out above the new descending resisstance line, and all that is couple with volume...  we may actually get a legit rally
what do ppl think about the mining hash rate increasing even though the price has been awful.  New Forbes article says thats bullish for the long term.  I think it makes a good point., why would more miners be mining bitcoin, making the network even stronger if they thought it was gonna crash.  This could seriously be the last slump in price.  Maybe it goes on for a few more days, touches 6700 or whatever, but I'm betting that's about it 
The dip buying at 739x is aboslutely ferocious. This can't hold.

We are teasing our mid-term trendline, which has flipped from support to resistance to support: https://www.tradingview.com/x/5YIvW1Ev/

I'm holding my 7460 short still, which is finally green again after over a day underwater. Also my futures short from way up. If/when 7400 falls with conviction, I expect buyers to step out of the way. down to 7330ish. 

edit to add: always risky, but shorting the breakdown of a descending support line offers some of the better R/R when it comes to shorting, as that line should turn to resistance. This one is being super stubborn, though. 
Update on my knife-catching a day ago ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8lggj8/daily_discussion_wednesday_may_23_2018/dzh25yt/)).

Thoughts And Prayers^tm answered (for now).

I'll still be a net-buyer in the short-term on oversold technicals until we break the previous low ($6,500). Chart: https://imgur.com/a/RWRCPjd

BBands cinching on the weekly with decreasing sell-side volume. Macro/fundamentals are still very strong (the mothafuckin' NASDAQ & NYSE want to become crypto exchanges !!); Bitcoin/crypto is clearly here to stay and the institutional money truly has arrived.

Have a nice weekend. Spend some time with family & enjoy the weather.
Haven't really been paying attention to the market recently but this is something I'd really like to get some clarity on, if anyone can help; does anyone know when and at what price did Bitmex funding flip into negative? Just noticed that earlier today, kinda wondering if it's been in negative for a while or did it really only swing over down here around $7500.

EDIT: lots of useful replies here, thanks to everyone!
Sorry upfront if this has been said many times before in the last two days or so - on holidays and pretty much offline: Doesn't the 12h chart (BFX) look like a classic bear flag? 

Judging by the flag pole, I would say target around the log downtrend line from ATH around 6.5k, so lower than my previous target of 6.9k (log support from previous lows). Didn't we all say this resistance turned support needs to be tested before next bull run? So I would guess: Good chance this is the test in the making although bulls may jump in before that...

Sorry, no chart, on mobile
Just the tip update:

[Referencing this earlier comment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8lpstw/daily_discussion_thursday_may_24_2018/dzjcave/)

We seem to keep bumping on the downward trend line.  It was support, then we dropped down and it became resistance, now we're at support again, about to test it.

When a trendline or a chart pattern's resistance line has a fakeout, and then reenters the trend/pattern, do you redraw the trendline using that fakeout, or do you keep the original line, and just think of it as a fakeout?
Damn, almost no activity going on. Looks like everything is coming to a stop.
Awaiting break of inside bars on the daily chart.
If it breaks below $6000 then what is the next psychological support? 
Why do I get the feeling that we might be painting another one of these multi-day bearflags that we've seen since 10K ? 
that was so weired, check the volume on bitfinex. the volume is only about 200 coins that got bought the way up, but before the order book was filled with 600 coins, this market is a manipulated shitshow.

[https://imgur.com/a/eeiJVTI](https://imgur.com/a/eeiJVTI)

the red last candlestick on the right side occured when the price was already at 7480\+, so only the two small green ones bought it up. 
The day after we hit 20K, I made a spreadsheet that lines up all the crashes, with their daily "% of ATH".

It's spooky how similar things look when compared to the late-2013 crash.

Today, day 159 after-crash, we had a high of 38.6% ATH - which would be **$7,611** using the Dec '17 ATH.

If things somehow continue to be similar, then June will be a good rebound month (we'll get as high as $11,515 on June 20).

A second Fun-fact: if this crash was like the 2011 crash, the price today would be **$1,540** ... Yeah, that's 7.8% of ATH, which is basically the worst the % of ATH has ever dropped to, ever.

Anyone have a graph that overlays the older crashes onto this one? I'd like to see this all visually

also, here's today's equivalent (day 159) thread for fun:

Why? Because locking in profits, and it’s a beautiful day out where I live and I’ll be enjoying the beach with my lady. Go outside and live life, life ain’t all about crypto ^JK ^Crypto ^Is ^my ^life

Also, I hope no one follows my trades. Yes I’ve been on a hot streak, but maybe I’m just getting lucky. Don’t want my fellow lads to get burned if/when I make a bad one. 
anyone else finding it difficult not to just rageshort this  
i mean its just so rekt  
only 1k more down and we are breaking the weekly bands down 
The price barely made it above the 50 week MA for yesterday's close. Now it's trading below again. Today could be the first time the the daily closes below the it in a very long time. If Sunday closes in this range or lower, that's pretty bad. As in, this bear market is probably only half over.

I'm looking at this downtrend line and expecting the next touch to break it. I think for the first time since the drop a long between 7400\-7500 is better r/r than a short **for a short term trade**. RSI has plenty of room to move up.  Also ETH ratio is going up.

We also touched the daily bbands and went out of them.

Safest trade is of course trading the breakout. I am not in position. Just managed to catch a sleepy 7525 short that I closed @7370 this morning.  I am strongly considering a smaller long that I will add on once we break out. Target would be the horizontal resistance zone @7750\-7900.

What is the intention, if any, of these down spikes?

trigger shorts for a squeeze?

test support? 

test resistance on the way down?

just a quick exit?

just some big market sells also unintentionally triggering stop losses?

impossible to interpret?

Does anyone else find it funny that the ask side of the book is thin then as soon as the price jumps $50 asks rush to fill the book? Like make up your damn mind and just place your asks.
stopped out of my long from this morning

considering shorting but may just wait it out
First time for a long time setting actual stops. I don't trust this movement today and bb on 15 are tight so it's gonna move soon, be on my short and going to sleep. Good luck.
Temporary look out for shorts: 

I know this thread isn't about alts but look at the top 30 coins on CMC: BTC has gone up by roughly 1.5% in the last 24 hrs, most alts have gone up by 3%+.  I know that's kind of normal given that they fall harder too, but in a few instances in the last few months, that's led to a loop that's helped push up BTC price (even if its just temporary).

If you still believe in the short, you may want to put your limits just above strong resistance areas at 7800ish.
Meanwhile in Cryptowhale Tower, an assistant has been sent out to find a coin to flip for the next move.
May be Bitcoin is too cheap to buy right now, may be its not. May be its just the traders perceiving it as too cheap, may be its not the perception *neither*. May be it is just destined to be a lot more cheaper. However, I am not a believer of the last one.

A dip is very probable to make things right.
Holding my long from 7500 \(small position\) will be looking to add to it at 7250
So we get a descending triangle inside a pennant. Breaking up from here is 2\-times unlikly, as both are bearish patterns \(pennant \-\> continuitation of the trend; descending triangles tend to break down\).

Okex is getting lighter on the bid side and I'm not seeing the significant 20\+ coin buys I was seeing throughout the day. Also, it looks like 7400 is starting to act as resistance.

e: bitcoin gonna bitcoin
I only make occasional buy/sell trades and think long-term. I'm definitely not selling here just in case we do a 2013 repeat 2nd bubble and go x10. Its also a little too high for me to buy. I feel like many are in the same boat hence the indecisive market
down seems like an inevitability from here. Any move up looks like it will run outta steam pretty quickly, espesh with resistance. Downtown.
Added another 10% to my Short here, buyers not showing any real conviction, same stops above 7900 but it looks to me like the slow bleed will continue for now.
Long @7445. I expect this to breakout in the next 4Hs. Stops below 7200. Downtrend line @7550 or so.

Will add all the way down to the local low.

Edit2: Added about 15% here @7435.
We've been witnessing a string of fakeout reversals the past 3 weeks. I think this finally may be the actual new floor, right on the 0.786 Fib since the dawn of the BGD. One more leg down now we risk breaking out of the symmetrical triangle. Will start fishing bids for long entries in this range.

I'm categorically disregarding bear fantasies of sub 6k for now; it doesn't fit with the weekly pattern nor the crypto hypetrain reality. Everyone and their grandma would borrow fiat to get a piece of a sub 6k wick.

Doesn't the current ranging (above) look similar to the last bottom in April (below)?

https://www.tradingview.com/x/LmIfzynA/

And what happened next?

Given the bullish divergence near oversold RSI, a similar bounce could put us at $8900 by early June.

TLDR: I'm loading up on coin.
If shorts had actually been increasing this whole way down, I would feel a lot less comfortable adding to my shorts here.

[We're still above this line.](https://imgur.com/raFe4Cx) Anticipating spending a few years below it again.

It feels weird selling when 1D RSI is as low as it is, but there is very little buying interest, too many longs opening and not enough shorts open. 3D RSI and 1W RSI oversold is what I've been anticipating next. I haven't felt this comfortable in a short since January.
Is there a way to compare the liquidity of assets?

Does the liquidity of an asset play any factor into mean reversion or its "true value"?

I mean, since BTC is infinitely divisible, is there any sort of economic principle barring it from being worth $1000 vs $100,000 with the same amount of money in the space? Is it simply supply and demand? 

Isn't the price of an asset primarily determined by how liquid it is? Is the whole boom-bust cycle of BTC mainly due to its lack of liquidity compared to other assets with relatively the same amount of money flowing through each market?
So, will CRAB-17 be activated today or not when people see the market did not panic dump more than 100-200$ ? 

If not next target is 7650 and then I am also at breakeven(or like +.3%) on my  long from 7625 :D
Anyone else looking at the down contracts on bitmex? Someone seems to have bought up the order book and the market maker is asleep...

EDIT: This is actually a pattern on both up and down that they get bought up straight away. So no big deal actually (and open interest is fucking shockingly low anyway)
General question to all daytraders: 

When you post 'longs' or 'shorts', are there actual Bitcoin transactions involved, or are you just making contracts based on the price of Bitcoin?
Whatever you do, don't search google trends for "Bitcoin" and "Buy Bitcoin" then filter over 5 years.  Don't do that...
The 400 day EMA (green curve) hasn't been broken this year, although it's a bit fuzzy in the beginning of April.

Taking a small long position, looking to reverse to a short at 7700

edit- going long at 7505
It feels as though bulls aren't trying to push the price up, but rather just trying to slow the descent. Almost like they are trying to limit the momentum into the 7\-7.2k range. That or this is a cleverly orchestrated bear trap.

Edit 01:31:30 GMT+0100 (GMT Summer Time): The target of this trade has been reduced to 7580 due to the resistance line downtreading and will be closed with a limit at that target.
Was out of all my short positions as I mentioned yesterday at ~7400

I am still bearish mid-term but I had my target hit on the retrace (I was looking at ~7350, again as I said yesterday)...and I am long now.

Not super confident in this position but we may have a rise to perhaps 7800-8000 before more downside. 

peace and good trading

Still short from 7565 with stops above this formation. I think unless we break 7260 or 7650 we won't trigger the cascading liquidations/SLs need for a strong push. 

Also (tin foil hat on) the down contracts for 7250 expired today and we have new ones for 6750. Take that for what it's worth. 
I think r/bitcoinmarkets just become a pump group lead by [**u/\_chewtoy\_**](https://www.reddit.com/user/_chewtoy_) . All hail our master /s you can't possibly be that lucky.
just opened up a short term long position, hope i don't get butt raped fam. 

buying into the right inverted head and shoulders pattern. see how it turns out for now.
Still not low enough in percentage terms. We got a while to go, the buying pressure is laughable and so is the volume. 

Bulls should be in fiat right now and shouldn't think about longing til we retest the yearly low, if that breaks, bulls should take the summer off and come back in late August for long term entry points.

Good luck yall
Hi, it’s your local conspiracy theorist here with another contribution. If you’re looking for a big bounce here soon, today may not be the day. It seems almost every major alt has been bleeding today while BTC has gone sideways. This type of price action does not typically seem to precede a pump.
I've got a long. I can weather a drop to $6000. Anything under that, it's panic time for me. I don't see much support between current price and $6000, but I think we'll bounce off of $6400. Be craeful, everyone. Best of luck. 
This is a shitpost/shower thought mainly, but maybe the ideal bottom for the next bullrun would be a price where an average investor with some disposable income and a good stable job who always wanted to own one full bitcoin can finally afford one. That number is arbitrary but I think $2-3K is a good number since bitcoin has proven it can reach $10K several times albeit with high risk. 

I pulled this out of my ass because during the Dec bull run I had many friends who were disappointed they couldn't afford a whole bitcoin and when I told them you can buy fractions, they didn't seem all that interested and said they "missed out" Of course in hindsight they were lucky to have missed out.

I am not at all implying we will go that low nor do I think it will but Tone Vays has called for $1300/BTC since its far from delusional.
When you switch to linear, the similarity is striking:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/HZj8dOSv/

https://www.tradingview.com/x/gplhhNi8/
5900 was not max pain. This many longs still open is not max pain. And the fact that we still have this much volatility means a lot more down and a lot more sideways. EOS at 12 dollars!? Seriously? Look at ETH and what it launched at, back then even that was considered kinda ridiculous. The whole market still looks like a big fat juicy slug that needs to be squished and dried out.

Edit:

log - https://imgur.com/Sulbwtb

linear - https://imgur.com/ZOqh9mV

Also, keep in mind, this is a holiday weekend in the US. Banks will be closed next 72 hours +. Perfect time to make a big pretty/ugly move. IMO, it looks a lot easier to dump with fiat being unable to reach exchanges than to go up with all the longs we have. Therefore, it'll probably just go sideways.

Price is testing the long-term uptrend line again.  The one going back to mid July of last year.

Edit:

Linear Scale:  https://www.tradingview.com/x/cyoK94MR/

Log Scale: https://www.tradingview.com/x/3jJ1iRuS/

I didn't mean to use Linear at first, but Log shows it breaking, going back to March of last year, although not a lot of touches with the line.
So, looks like ETH is the leader today like it was last month.  The ratio is increasing too and my feeling is that in general is quite good as a "total market temperature" measure so this could pull BTC up
Triple bottom.

In the last cycle, it wasn’t until the third test of the bottom until the price finally broke the trend.

I think the bottom is 6300-7000. We’ve hit it twice before. We will test it again (or have) and begin an uptrend
My post from a few days ago bears repeating as it seems folks are starting to realize the seriousness of the current state of market sentiment:

Here's the weekly pivot chart that I have that shows 3.2k as the next area of support on the year. We lost 8.5k again and margin longs continue to build up which is not good for bottoming prospects since 6.4-7.2 was a prior accumulation range that already tested twice. Further more there is no long term price level where there would be a clear double bottom that we have not already breached. This is why I was always so insistent we needed to keep above 8.5k. But instead, with price basically slow bleeding since ATH - margin longs are trying to fuel the next and probably biggest leg down through what is supposed to be the strongest support on the year (S3 - 8.5) since there is no floor until 3.2k. If longs closed as we approached this level I would be more confident that we would hold the previous range of support. But we're likely going to continue what's been the slow bleed since ATH until the cascade BRD at some point.

https://imgur.com/a/OR5csTT
We're probably alright unless we drop another 100-200, then pandemonium of cascading stop losses probably.

Can anyone explain to me why crackdown of fraudulent and illegal activities by exchanges is a bad thing for this market?
I am thinking about opening a short. A few charts on tradingview are convincing me. Specifically one by Lemosedmirf and N1njawtf. That plus the faithful weekend dump. I am normally wrong though so lets see.

On another note i just learned [cryptowat.ch](https://cryptowat.ch) has a countdown clock till the next candle. that is awesome!
At what point could you call yourself a competent trader?

I noticed that since 5th March, I changed. Let's be pretentious and call it enlightenment. I still get emotional if I miss an opportunity or a trade doesn't go my way but I no longer react to it by panic sell / fomo. Still hesitate to pull the trigger on trades at times but making far fewer losses compared to before 5th March.

Could I call myself, at the very least, a minimally competent trader?

EDIT: To be more specific, can you call yourself competent once emotion is no longer a contributor to your trading decision?
I was absolutely certain the market would confirm and stay above 7.8-8.5 range to avoid retesting the 6.4.-7.2 range for the 3rd time in this current down trend (and hence confirm a double bottom) -- because to not do so would mean (for me anyways) it would be over for any chance for a bull market until 3.2k is tested. I do not want to pin hopes on a triple bottom as it is very rare and not only that, to fall through it (which is likely) will take us to deep and fresh lows not seen since middle of last year.  Overall the big picture and current challenge is that we are now in a trough of a triple bottom test where the only pivot support remaining after the key 8.5k (S3) was lost for the 3rd time for the entire year is 3.2k.

Weekly Pivot Chart: https://imgur.com/a/OR5csTT
This is a very calculated rise. Call me cocky but going long here is the absolute right move. 
Weekend dump?
This is feeling reminiscent of pre-BGD. I don't expect another BGD of that size but I've opened a long with CA at 7430. It's basically the same reason as chewy opened a short (that he closed) but inverse--there is a support line here that we just bounced off of, from 7275, 7325, 7365. If it goes below that line I cut for a small loss, but given where we are in the triangle everyone's looking at, I think there's a pretty good chance I get at least a small profit up to the resistance line(s), with a smaller but decent chance this is the start of a decent week-ish long run to 8.5k. I think the odds of that are greater than us breaking through 6.8k here.

From our 10k top we have retraced almost 30% which is normal for BTC to do. And since I sold near the top and bought near the bottom I have almost 25% more BTC which is a good amount to have gained, but buying does seem weak right now and I don't feel comfortable with my buys (seeing how I'm already in the red). If we do go down then so be it, I guess I'll become a hodler but I just don't want to sell just in case I sell at a point like [this](http://d.stockcharts.com/school/data/media/chart_school/market_analysis/wyckoff3/wyckoffaccumulation.png) (the spring). 


The only consolation I have is that many people think we are going sideways, which imo, would be bullish. Holding here as another high low after a 30% drop with all this FUD going around would be very good in the short term. Long term idk. Others have already noted the giant triangle we are in that we could bounce around in for another 2 months. If we are to reverse here we'll get to the top of that triangle at around 9k, which is my current target. Good luck to everyone.

Giving up on my long for a small loss (7427>7390). Need to sleep and can't watch orderbook fakery anymore. 
What is your insight on the current market? Do you see it breaking 6800 or going to break up?
My plan to leave Bitfinex is real. I currently withdraw my funds in smaller junks. Two went through smoothly, the current one is in "processing mode" for over 1 hour now.

Kraken is my new home, not the best exchange for sure but I think my funds are quite safe there \(I hope\) and fees are really okay. I read some bad stuff about Bitstamp recently \(all these kind of questions they wanted to have answered\) and fees are terrible \(0.2&#37; on every trade without taking into account any trading volume makes them the most expensive fees I have seen\). Have not used GDAX before, but with this volume hmm better not.

Edt: lol and you have the chance to grab some of these regular occuring fat\-fingers just as in the last 15m candle where price dropped to 7.3k.
Bleh, stopped out of my short. Thanks June futures for blowing up $40 above spot! Let's see if this triangle keeps playing out, will aim to reshort around 7580.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. Welcome to flight number 42, non-stop from 7k to 150k. The weather ahead is good and, therefore, we should have smooth and uneventful flight. Now sit back and relax ...
interesting the correlation between ethereum and bitcoin. ethereum had to over extend and was looking more bullish while bitcoin remained bearish looking and dumped that big red bar just now. both looking like short term signs of reversal.
Noob question. Where can I check the longs/shorts ratio?
I feel like we need to go just a bit lower into the 7000-7200 range to get the real bounce.

The last 2 times a bunch of tether was printed the price has plummeted shortly after. Mid March and a week ago. So much for tether printing being an indication of a price rise.

Still holding my long \(average 7427 now\) but moved my stops/alarms from 7200 up to 7300. I don't think breaking this line and getting back above it is possible. I'm with Mike and leaning on a breakout instead of more down in the short term. Breaking down this bear flag will be ugly. I don't think the 4h will allow for that to happen so soon though. Low volume on the rises and large volume on similar down movements indicates willingness of buyers at this level even though we don't see a lot of market buys.

Edit: Flag not visible wrong link. Will update in a sec.

I know I'll get downvoted into oblivion for this but now that Rothschild, Soros, and Rockefeller are involved in Bitcoin, I'd like to see the price take a dive.

The tech will continue to evolve. However, this doesn’t mean the price should skyrocket. Frankly, sub 1000 BTC is healthier than these ridiculous prices. Even $7500 is batshit crazy. You mean to tell me people will pay 7500 for a digital coin that does nothing? Wow

Seems like the mtgox trustee has been dumping again. When BTC finally hit 10k again, his dumping reactivated. Coincides perfectly with the coins being moved.
Last time EOS was leading the market, overtaking BTC/USDT in volume on Finex. The main net release is in a few days, probably not enough to reverse the trend but do keep that in mind.

I think that's a pretty solid sentiment assessment. Coupled with the fact that buying pressure has been abysmal this week, I believe we have further to fall. We also haven't seen the capitulation followed by a solid bounce to start giving indications that we've bottomed out

In the past I've fallen into the trap of thinking we've reached the bottom before and then getting dumped on. I feel we are at that stage where the optimism is returning and bulls are breathing a sigh of relief. Maximum pain seems to generally be what comes next
> it seems like most people feel they successfully bought the dip, and are now waiting for others to push the price back up for them.

I am waiting too. I just want to be happy again. :) Agreed with your write-up. 
We seem to have the most volume traded at 8200 which makes it both a magnet and S/R. Problem is we consolidated there and fell through so now the chart looks wrecked. I think whales will play these wyckoff moves when it makes sense that people are over-leveraged and I don't think shorts can be easily sqeezed since so many are in profit. It's much easier to push the market up than down but I imagine the risk outweighs the reward right now. Longs are underwater and will need to close if we don't continue up and people have been anxious about shorting since that insane short squeeze. Also the danger that if we do drop(and it only really takes one or two big sellers to trigger panic) we could drop a fair bit. It only makes sense if they can maybe highly leverage a trade and buy short term I guess but I don't see us doing what we done last time and if we do and don't break 11.7 then it's probably more bearish as buyers seem exhausted at these levels and we're still dropping.

Not saying I don't agree with what your saying to some extent I just don't think it's likely here. Saying that I was short in anticipation of a breakdown last time and was fucked out of my profits made on the way down so take from that what you will. I'm net short but safely so barring a 1K 1 minute candle stopping me out. Even then I'm still up 2x on my rather small mex account this week with a fair bit of unrealized gains(that will 2x again so not bad considering it was a few hundred bucks I thought I'd be willing to blow on a reasonably high leveraged trading). I've been managing a low leveraged short position on bfx on and off for about 3 weeks as well that's in decent profit. I'm obviously slightly over leveraged (on my mex account) but thats my gambling money I bought specifically for that move when I saw the struggle at 10K...

I'm done trying to scalp moves I'm just playing longer timeframes. A few % here and there eventually gets lost by that one stupid trade. Better to play the trend and catch daily and weekly candles to get full moves. Saying that there's a lot of money to be made in this chop but you never know when the position is going to go against you pretty quickly. So you need to be consistent with stops and position sizing at very least. Id rather sit short(at least hedged from the 8.5K area) if we hit 5K and watch what happens there instead of actively managing positions if we are still bearish afterwards.
Do you think bots are determining the right moment, as in programmed volume \(liquidity\) compared to remaining stack to dump? Yesterday at the 7200 low there seemed to be a deinite "bot" moment of turn around, like as in everybody feeding the moment of buy back, but then not really.

Would one program the AI to foresee above and ´get in before others?

In stocks it seemed to be \(pre2000\) philosophy of what everybody found average attractive, not the hottest girl. Not sure though that this counts anylonger as stock markets are jiggy on free $. But crypto just seems so more on steroids and speed, 24/7, fullfront unhinged manipulation etc. It has nothing to do with "fundamentals", just a complete freedom of market manipulation.
When people speak about "the whales", is it one mega hodler (10k+) or a group of big holder who coordinate ? How do they know each other ? I don't doubt the wealthy always seek to be more wealthy, but how is this playing out practically ?
And I am sorry I didnt post sooner. I sold upon seeing the news but saw no effect in price and btc actually went up. I thought maybe its not a big deal.

You can also see that the BB on the hourly is turning downwards and the 3H is cooled off and could be primed for a dump in the near future. RSI isnt that low either and a possible MACD rejection. Were also vandering nicely below the 1h cloud, and seemed to have bounced off the middle of the 1h BB. And not to forget that bear pennant that is forming. The volume is awfully low and that makes it hard to trust any pump or dump atm imo
Watching the same chart but at the 1hr scale.

*The next few hours are critical*


^^^/s
Chewy, in such situations where it is very difficult to predict in which direction price is moving does it make sense to use the side closer to the major resistance/support? I mean if I go long I would have to put stop limit at 7200, but if I go long I can put resistance at this line you shared with us. Which is only $100 away? Does it make more sense to go short in this case?

Edit: I went into small short and added stop limit at 7550 hoping that the this thing will just bleed out.
I still have mine open because i got raped on ETHUSD (was 50/50 on BTC and ETH). Managed to get some back re-shorting ETH a bit higher than where i was stopped but still in the red.

Stops above 7600 and will wait a bit more. Will probably close the rest of my ETH short since it's the most risky position since ETH has been pumping all day.
The Chewy crew is out... load ze damp.  JK sir, I know you are playing it safe for those following your trades.

Price is below both the Tenkan and Kijun, we are about to get a bearish TK cross to the downside, as well as a bearish kuomo twist, as well as the lagging span entering and going below price, and price about to enter/go below the cloud...all of this unless we get back above 10K soon.

We all have our own fundamental/TA analysis, but for me everything is clearly bearish.

Having said that I am prepared to change my mind when/if things change

Good luck. Peace 

Edit : Just wanted to add my current target is 5k ish 
When sloppy wakes up or logs online, I’ll ask him to do a poll for a prediction on BTC price in 1 month.

Last time he did it, the sub was spot on. So we all aren’t that stupid 
If we operate in this suspected large triangle then you should have plenty of time to close breakeven or even in profit by the end of Jun if we reach the top around 9k. If we break down the bottom of it however then you might need to take the loss on that one.

[My working scenario posted earlier](https://www.tradingview.com/x/lfgAixfO/) or [here is a cleaner chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/9CiJ4Lib/)
Now's a pretty uncertain time to speculate:

https://imgur.com/a/OMefoW4

Most likely though I'd say somewhere within the confines of that triangle.
Honestly, somewhere between 7000 and 9000. That's my range until August. Then we start creeping up.
I'm in pretty much the same boat as you, how did you let it get so far underwater?
https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/GKZ5fhX2-Two-Scenarios/


I think we’ll still be in this triangle in one month. But we could break out anytime around the end of June or start of July. Idk the long term trend yet so, what we do as we break out from this triangle is going to determine the long term trend. But in exactly one month I still think we’ll be in the triangle, sitting around 8500 or so.
My guess is somewhere around $8200 - if the long-term support holds.  If not, yeeesh. 
[removed]
Considering that the most probable place to find support is around 6.9k and 7k, wouldn't shorting below 7.2 be a bit risky?
What MACD settings do you use?  
great choice
i closed a bit ago too, market doesn't seem to want to go down right now. Put on a small long and have got limit sells staggered between 7.7 & 7.8 area to see if can short it from there. Time for a nap.
As much as I genuinely want BTC to do well, because you know, I have a decent amount of it, I genuinely am not optimistic at all. Why on earth *should* there be another bullrun? All the ATH did was prove that BTC is totally useless as a currency.

I'm aware that Lightning Network is a thing but it's still not even close to ready for mass adoption.

To clarify, this doesn't mean that I think any alt is exactly any better - what I'm saying is that I genuinely think that crypto in general is massively overhyped and, whilst I would love to see another bullrun, I genuinely don't consider it likely.
I want it to go lower so i can buy back in.  LOL...Seriously
> I need to buy back in

eh. Plenty sold off in the 9k range. Even if this is the bottom, thats plenty of time to buy back in once we are rebounding. 

The first major drop to 6k had an entire day to buy back in at 6k prices. 

The second drop to 6k had 14 days to buy at those prices.

Our next rebound is likely to take even longer.
!remindme next bullrun "why can't it dip one more time"
Yes there will be another bullrun, but it may be from $2000 to $4000 and in a couple of years from now.
I was thinking earlier how this market trades so much differently than it used to.  I assume it will only get more and more difficult to daytrade it profitably.  It was pathetically easy in 2013/2014 (even though I screwed it up)...defiinitely different now.
This has inevitability written all over it.

Plus ETH has dumped almost 2% while BTC has only fallen 0.5%. I expect the ratio will catch up soon. 
100x? 

Jkjk, curious why you decided to go 20x last night. 

Just taking  advantage of the complete lack of buy pressure? Or are you shifting to a mindset of making money off downwards movement now
Reopened my short here. Been getting chopped up but downward sloping resistance is some comfort here. Would rather get in before the breakdown than after. Buyers need to step aside here, they sure as hell weren't interested earlier. 
I was just thinking “ Short this bounce “ but the R/R isn’t amazing.

Although, Buyers seem to be done flexing and running out of steam. 
I thought you were expecting this to chop between 7400\-7700 \(well atleast thats what you were expecting yesterday\)
whoa, that's a pretty aggressive trade, shorting the bottom of the pennant?
hard to tell which direction this will go.
Also short from the same price, what are your stop losses, I am considering 7600 although I am very bad with my stops. Got stopped on 9850 before we crashed, and also got stopped on 8550 before another crash.
Bitcoin just doing its "flip a coin" thing. I'm tired of it and will wait for a breakout either way, losing money on gambles is shit.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/u7ok4JfG
/u/L14dy, the prophet.
That's what actually makes you a good trader, closing in profit without being greedy.
where do you trade futures? the autist in me is tempted to accelerate my losses haha
If you think the market is going to push past your target, then hold onto your winning hand. But you need to have a concrete number in mind that you will sell at if it starts to go against you. No matter what.
Sometimes not being "greedy" is the worst mistake you can make as a trader  I have done that many times with taking a profit, rather than letting it run much higher.
Interestingly, I've seen Mike and Chewy trade against each other a few times... and both come out ahead. Nothing beats a good entry at the right time, but the market gives you multiple chances to win... And more to lose. Lets see if they can both add stack here Lou.
do you think that the market bounced to this position because of your long?
Dude i absolutely love your contributions for this sub. High quality! Keep it going :-).
2 days ago I posted my hypothetical theory on what would happen in the next coming few weeks with BTC

[POST ](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8lggj8/comment/dzgosex?st=JHM3FGH9&sh=3a6c0992) 

And it looks like the fractal/my narrative could play out. We would consolidate in this range for another BGD but up to 9kish  now

yes it's quite nice not going sideways for days
Short answer: Yes it happens often. It was breached but fell back down then becomes resistance later again. Happens ins the reverse also.
Me too. Short 7498 12x. 
Triple bottom on what time frame?
Agreed on the Ichi...to me the weekly ichimoku is on the verge of every metric being bearish
you can zoom out on the charts! yes its obvious the new UI is just so they can integrate newer coins so they can make more money. why bother upgrading the UI to benefit the users? /S
They should've at least added some more indicators/overlays, still just have access to the same 12 and 26 day EMA. Also, I prefer the color scheme and simplistic design of GDAX
Does anyone want to venture a guess when the new ERC 20 coins will be hitting Coinbase Pro?
Yea bitcoin gives me blueballs. All this teasing and no action 
I have a feeling that a lot of those dip buyers (knife catchers) are just people who can't or are afraid to short.
I noticed I put xbusd instead of the correct symbol of xbtusd. Not sure if you have a way to correct this ourselves or just leave it.

Keep up the good work.
Great job mate, the subscribe option is really nice. THanks.
Appreciate all the work you do here!
Calling $60 ETH sounds ridiculous indeed. TA can be a nice helper sometimes, but remember this:

"The future is not set. There's no fate but what we make for ourselves." (Terminator 2 :D)
beautiful write up. thanks for the great content. 
People are desperate for their longs to regain value, or failing that please just stop losing value. But if you look at a chart like [this](https://www.tradingview.com/x/R7hAbJma/) and you're  medium-term bullish I think your analysis is way off. Short term the technical retrace was actually much weaker than previous ones in the downtrend since 10k. 

If we're talking trend reversal, the rule of thumb to look for higher highs, higher lows still holds true. So far, in this trend, all our highs have been lower, and all our lows have been lower (except maayyybe one on the 14th). It has been an incredibly easy downtrend to trade, of course personally I fucked it up several times over.

agree, crypto market loves to play out triangles till the very last corner.
Looks like a [small break of the downtrend on small time scales.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/yagD1GOO/)  It's going nowhere.  At best, I think it'll move to $7500 \- $7550 ... which may be the last good short position before all the rats flee the ship
[https://imgur.com/a/abSkqPQ](https://imgur.com/a/abSkqPQ)

What caused you to get out of your position there?  Here's what I'm looking at, which, to me, says nothing has happened since you opened your short.  Why get out here?   

What I see is that if the price breaks above 7500, that's when to get out of a short.  So what made you get out at 7410?
Just out of interest, as a whole, does your profit cover fees?

surely theyre through the roof
The market is as indecisive as it was in the beginning of April.

I'm not a daytrader, but if I was I would consider this a "no trading zone".
Still long. 4hr keeps making higher lows. One thing that dragged BTC down was ETHBTC ratio hit a downtrend line near the peak of a rising wedge. ETH dumpped and took BTC with it, just not as much. 
!short xbtusd close 7410
Check the Ichimoku Clouds on the 1H on both BTC and ETH
Hadn’t thought of it like this. Brb, remortgaging house.
It was around this time last year that people started mortgagin their house to buy Bitcoin.

We were barely above 2k until May as far as I can remember
Cost to mine a coin is somewhere around $2k-$6k, that's why the hash rate is still increasing.
People that bought these miners that are coming online now purchased them 2 months ago.
Overall it is still bullish that they are selling at their cost + premium.
If they thought it wasn't worth it they would be selling it at a sharp discount but we don't really see that happening.
I have a feeling this won't hold long. It's either breaking up or down soon. Resistance is like what? 7.5 now?
When you say "This can't hold" what do you mean?
good job paper trading, wish i had done the same from the start. i went straight to losing my shirt for a good lesson. And thanks, u have a good weekend too.
https://www.bitmex.com/app/fundingHistory
It flipped yesterday, around 24h ago
I think the last 5 funding periods have been in the negative.
12am on the 24th
The problem now is that it all depends on what timeframe you look. You can see bear flag, bull flag, triangle, wedge ascending and descending... You can trade 12h bear flag but then you may need to wait out through a pump to 8k+because some smaller formations will play earlier.

It's really hard market for TA now.
Been watching this as well. On mine: https://www.tradingview.com/x/jF7vj9gP/
Long term?



https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/GKZ5fhX2-Two-Scenarios/



No trend can be determined yet imo
Well, I believe it will go up.

https://i.imgur.com/UGc4mbU.png

I'm sure the next one will believe the opposite. ;-)
Until we bottom with conviction it's going to be hard to give any long term predictions. We could bottom in the next 2 weeks or it could slowly grind down or go sideways for months on end.

Long term (years): Bullish bearing any bad news or fatal flaws
Weeks/Months: Bearish until we bottom.

At least that my opinion
Sometimes watch both :/  Chart gets messy.  But usually discount the fakeout for future trending.  Unless it ends up contributing to a pattern a bit later, in which case I guess it later became more than just a fakeout in the scheme of things.
reaching the end of a symmetrical triangle (the giant bear flag). should be action in a couple hours max
calm before the storm... EDIT: higher lows, lower highs since we had temp bottom. Trend is down but selling pressure has reduced since 72xx. I think we see the technical bounce continue. We'll see if it has any steam for more from 7.6-7.8, could go up to low 8's before another move down. It seems theres some consensus that the down move isn't over, just not sure when it will resume.
Next support is around 5K, which isn't all that strong. Then 3K. Then 1.7K and finally 1.2K. It'll be incredibly disappointing and worrying if it goes below previous ATH at 1.2K.
5500
You're getting that feeling because you're probably correct. 

Neither side seems in a rush to make a move, so sideways is the most likely outcome.
Ooh, I know this one...

It's because we've been seeing them since 10k. ;p
The market seems to be hugely manipulated, sure, but what you described is not evidence of that.  

If you had a sell order at 7.8k right now and you saw the price accelerating up to your sell order, would you you just leave it there, or try to move it higher to get a better price?  Moving walls are totally natural.  
Re-opened short at 7480. Will bail above 7530 resistance. Once again, no follow through from buyers. 
Buy less than 7.4k, sell more than 7.4k
/u/sloppysynapses [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8lggj8/daily_discussion_wednesday_may_23_2018/dzfkr6w/?st=jhluri93&sh=7fdbdd32) the same thing a couple of days ago. I think this is a silly way to compare the two crashes though since you can manipulate the numbers pretty easily to fit your narrative. 22 weekly bars after the 1163 ATH there was a range of 420-460 or an equivalent of 7100-7700. That's close to where we are now, but it's also close to where we were before the bgd. I think the pump to 10k was the equivalent of the pump to 680, daily rsi hit 70 for the first time since the ATH in those pumps. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/a1yUWJwp/

>Anyone have a graph that overlays the older crashes onto this one? I'd like to see this all visually

https://www.tradingview.com/x/dBuWVOcO/

As you can see they don't align perfectly. 


the shape of the 2014 and the 2018 crash look quite similar but the time between the peaks is different, so your 156\-days after... comparrision is not such a good idea IMHO. you should compare the shapes.
Now we found our moonbois....

Kinda nice though if we can achieve dat 11.5k. But with this volume and trend. Nah..
can you share that spreadsheet?

Not closing, rain and thunders outside. Gonna stick to the chart.
> JK Crypto Is my life

you almost got me  until this there!
I remember you from yesterday, mainly because I had opened a short after the pump too and added to it two times. Reason: the trend is your friend and I didn't see this going anywhere, the resistance was just too strong. Unfortunately I closed it after several hours for a small loss because I couldn't babysit it.

Anyway ,congrats, man, nice trade

Congrats on your profits!
>go outside and live life 
 
sweet summer child 

Gonna be like groundhogs day if it pumped to 7.7 in an hour and you can reshort again.
Nice timing :)
Missed it by $7 :(
I actually think that the bottom will be when people accept that they make more money by shorting than longing and then there's just no one left to short the damn thing.

ibankbtc (someone who used to post a lot here, I believe he's who chewy watched when he learned how to trade) put it nicely:

https://twitter.com/ibankbitcoins/status/975028291554783237

> I remember the days when #Bitcoin market fell to about 230. The bitcoinmarkets dailies were filled with obituaries and people making money hand over fist shorting. Doesn't feel like that just yet
Why is the 50-week MA so important? Why would it be important for bitcoin? (hides for incoming 2014 reference...). What about 50-month MA? 

At which point do higher timeframes become meaningless and lose their causal influence on lower timeframes?

Technically its still in the beginning, you could argue it hasnt even started !!!
What pump? It went up like 1%
Buy high sell low, ya know it right
8380 what?
Yeah, I would even sell him mine! 
No I would not. That is why I decided a week ago to take out my money from crypto. (And went back to classic stocks, indices, commodities.)

Your poll is one of my strategys. I always check my investments with the question if I would long/short anything right now. And then quit or let it run. 
But it was very nice to short them :)
On kraken is low liquidity, if you see them on Bitfinex then it's probably stop hunting.
Its because if they fill it in the first place, people will be hesitant to buy. Once others start buying, they rush to offer the cheapest coins. 

This is human nature, it can take any form, yes it's funny right now, over and above, I find it scary and greedy too. Very soon their feelings will change; they will get afraid quickly; will start making irrational decisions and end up being on the wrong side of the road..
I am looking to close my short here at a small profit. I think there is better r/r to be found for either direction. We are somewhat near the bottom of long term and medium term support lines, so shorting is not great, but not low enough to open a long just yet, as the bottom could still fall out.
With the obvious caveat that I may be entirely wrong, I genuinely think that it's quite probable that we'll just continue sideways for a while.
May be
There is still no real world adoption. The price is based purely on hope that it will come soon. So even $100 might be too expensive.

Sloppy pointeed this wedge earlier
Got it! Down to goblin town we go!
And just like that
Hate playing on okex with margin. It feels fake volume. Everytime my buy order was on top just 1 cent below market order. Suddenly there is volume of 50 /90eth sell order filled. But mine isnt filled. Where the fuck he got that volume filled? Pretty sure there is no hidden book order. Cmiiw. Just test it out.

As for btc. I think we still in bear. Downside movemnt is just too much. The bear amplify the drop too much and resist the upwards quite hard. 
Yeah I'm of the same mind.
At what price would you buy?
Same here
What part of the last 20 days was indecisive?
This is the prevailing cyclical story in most markets, it changes when the next new entrant wave begins.
Did... Did you just say "espesh?!"
Yeah the fact that this is so obvious and many expect it is what gives me some hope that the contrary might happen and trap some shorts.

Neither are sellers

Why would you think that ?
What are your targets?
Rest in peace.
I highly doubt that everyone and their grandma wants to enter at sub 6k. I assume they would consider it at sub 1-3k range. 

The main reason is everyone and their grandma got already burned by entering at 15-19k. 
there's still hype?

BTC was nowhere near 86 or 94 in 2014.

It was above 200 for the entire year and dropped below 200 in early Jan 2015.
This is pretty much what the market is doing any time it's not in the middle of a big candle.
k fam k

Do you prefer cloud reading or divining rods?

Personally I think bull and bear clouds look to much allike.
that's a bear pennant and also a hidden bearish divergence

where is the bullish divergence you're seeing?
Shorts haven't stacked up against longs like they did in early April.
I think this is looking a lot more like 2014
Ok let's say you're prediction comes true. And then what? Probably won't make it too far past $8K before we head back south. Might be a good short term play but doesn't change the bearish sentiment whatsoever and $10K is all but a pipedream. If investors truly believed BTC will go up and stay up, they would be buying the shit up of BTC.
This time does feel different. One thing is for sure. The game of "crypto" has become more difficult and rightfully so since making money should have never been that easy.
Proof that you can spin every signal into either direction.  I'm curious to see how your $3000 prediction plays out.
all i can say is people are not comfortable opening huge shorts at least as shown in bitfinex shorts : https://www.tradingview.com/x/ueeWpkQ7/ either they are waiting for completely or maybe just no one wants to short this while longs are declining even if its just a bit https://www.tradingview.com/x/oAvKHqBQ/
This is wierd but now that I saw that chart and how far above the line we still are, I'm more bearish than I've ever been before. I thought a multi-year bear market was stupid but actually I think it's starting to make sense.


I might just sell all my crypto and come back in mid-2019.
Fishers formula gives the value of a currency without speculation MV=PT. 

To compare liquidity you usually just look at how much the price moves in relation to relative order sizes. (selling 1% of the supply crashes the price 80% as an example)

Classical asset prices are just discounted future value of what they produce or consumption utility.

The boom in bitcoin is partly from lack of liquidity, if the hype and whales are all chasing 50k coins on exchanges the price can squeeze up much easier.
I think that is such a huge part of the now meme ‘satoshis vision’. the infinite division is hedge against wealth inequality leading to lack of economic velocity; the main issue with our current system. just because you can divide a quantitatively limited asset doesnt mean the asset isn’t innately deflationary  
Crab 17?

That depends entirely on which exchange they're using.

Whatever you do, don't plot it against price and see that it has zero predictive power whatsoever. 
shouldn't the google trend be up? People with bearish bias like to google those words every day and repeatedly post it in this sub...
Its common knowledge it follows the price
Whatever you do, don't trust Google trends when people already have their answers from before.
I swear to god it works like this.

* Variable 1 = Moving Average Period
* Variable 2 = Moving Average Type

Adjust these until the price lines up, there are a nearly infinite number of possible lines if you adjust these.

I don't mind standard MAs such as the 200 or 50 periods, some people swear by fib numbers such as 5,8 and 21. I find it arbitrary and narrative fitting otherwise.

Maybe it is just me, I appreciate they work for some people and that is fine too.
That's my take on it as well. Some people are seeing a rising wedge but I really don't. Trend is down, triangle is within a down channel, *hidden* bearish divergences forming.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/IEAxkj7e/

Consolidation for a few days then last drop to 7k would be my guess. But buyers need to show up at 6.9-7k. I think they will, at least I will.

EDIT: hidden bearish div
I believe bear traps happen in uptrends, not in downtrends. If you look at the weekly chart, it's really wishful thinking that we'll just turn around 360° like nothing happened. A short-term shorts squeeze remains possible tho.
I suspect a bear trap, as the price has been slowly descending for the past few hours, not ascending (like it's usually the case in a bear flag).

We will see soon enough...
Fun fact: 

The bottom of this triangle is actually this line 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/Dk9KOrB6/
Nice find. I usually use log, so I didn't see this. I guess I need to start checking both especially on shorter time frames.
Zoom out. It's a flag, and a very scary one at that.
I closed 25% of my short from 7440 at 7380 (profit-taking stop) and just added it back at 7515. Now averaged at 7460. A small part of me just wants to GTFO at break even (or right here--close enough). Ugh. Just trade exhaustion. 
The down contracts for 6750 is because of the current price of BTC
when the last ones were set for 7250 the price was a lot higher.

I know the theories are out there about them forcing it to stay in that range, but that range (between the UP and DOWN) is roughly based on the price of BTC when the last contract expires.
I think chewtoy is a great trader and I pay attention to his posts but please dont ever trade off someone else. They will make a mistake at some point or wont have time to tell you when they get in/out and you will get fucked and sit there with the worst feeling. Everyone is going to be wrong at some point in this market. 
_Chewtoy_ is Bogdanov
bruh. why you posting this crap?
what iH&S? 

What time frame are you looking at?
Confusing way to word it but I’m with ya
Never. Bulls don't quit, ever.
I don't think that's a conspiracy theory... The alts have to flow through the exits to pay for their POW and cash out. So the exits get buying pressure at each level down.
true story. alts and Eth prices have acted as pretty good indicators for market sentiment and btc direction. I think a lot of people sold their alts after that last DCB the last couple days and bailed to fiat. Couple popular twitterheads were recommending it
I agree with you.

It used to be, that 21btc was a milestone that was reachable.

Then, 2.1 btc was the next goal, not so long ago. People nowadays don’t care about owning X% of the total coins, they just want to have “1 unit”, which right now is 1btc.

Could be that in a couple of months/years, we as a market move to smaller unit. But this has been a discussion for years already, and the current price, which sounded crazy a couple of years, has not changed things.

Super bull mode on: let’s do a 20x on our current market cap, and we will move to smaller units. More people will be aware and involved.
They both look like triangle, but that's about all. People can post this 100 times if they like, 2018 is 2018 and it's not following 2014. The market isn't fundamentally a little different, it's vastly different. How many companies were investing in blockchain? How many developers where in the crypto space? How big was the market cap? How much did the average person know about blockchain? I could go on and on. I'm not saying it's moon time, but to keep this goofy it's 2014 again story going is just silly.  
hmm doesnt every correction look more or less the same?

This is a speculative market true, but many that invest in it, invest in what cryptocurrency would be in the future, and that belief is strong enough, and the concept revolutionary enough, to justify these prices. The genie is out of the bottle. Cryptocurrencies have proven they can achieve multi billion dollar valuation. If you believe in the potential, you can justify these prices. If you don't believe in it and just here to make some money, then you are not in a position to comment on their value.
Didn't your mom teach you to never judge a book by its cover!?
> The whole market still looks like a big fat juicy slug that needs to be squished and dried out.

Every year I hear the same thing over and over again never fails, I remember a year ago almost reaching 2k and people thought bitcoin was way overvalued and it would blow up and die to under $200 and all alts would go away.   Year after year, same talking point gets brought up, maybe one day they will be right. 
When ETH launched, it was very unclear whether the genesis block premine, GHOST protocol and EVM would succeed. Ethereum was at 12 dollars within 9months.

Also, EOS has a larger ecosystem than ETH did back then.

I’m not saying EOS is not overvalued. Just saying comparing 2015 with now is a bit ridiculous
EOS did not just launch.  And that's great that you think the vague fundamentals don't justify current prices, but this is a trading sub.  

But I would say well over 50% probability that we are below $5900 in the next several months.
Looks like you're in linear scale. You should probably switch to log scale for this one. 

We're still about $400 away from testing the support in log scale.
If it breaks it is going to be nasty...
ETH will need to break up from its rising wedge first, will be tough. 
But it also falls at a greater pace than BTC. If the sellers go away ETH could bring BTC up, but if BTC starts dumping again, ETH won't hold it.
If you paint it like this, it's already at the bottom. Or very near, the precise bottom would be $7250. It went down to $7270.

Triple bottom on what time frame? Remember in forex trading, triple bottoms must be spaced out over a long period of time.
That's precisely what I've been looking at right now. Looks pretty neat on the 6 months chart. I don't know if we'll go there before the end of the week, but looking at previous cycles it should not go higher than ~8k before the next drop.
i'm very bearish and holding no coins but if BTC hits 3.2K I think we would go into a multi year bear market much longer than the past with no recovery to ATH in sight. I would hesitate to buy that low since I would wonder WTF is wrong. We would also more than likely see a flippening with either ETH or BCH if that happened since price going that low would probably signal something fundamentally wrong with BTC
Yep. Which would put us at precisely the same percentage drop as the $1200 ATH in 2013. If you copy paste that chart  and add it onto where we are now, you get your conclusion. I was laughed out of here for illustrating this but it’s probably where we’re headed. 
I was absolutely certain the market would confirm and stay above 7.8-8.5 range to avoid retesting the 6.4.-7.2 range for the 3rd time in this current down trend (and hence confirm a double bottom) -- because to not do so would mean (for me anyways) it would be over for any chance for a bull market until 3.2k is tested. I do not want to pin hopes on a triple bottom as it is very rare and not only that, to fall through it (which is likely) will take us to deep and fresh lows not seen since middle of last year. All I am saying is that we are now in a trough of a triple bottom test where the only pivot support remaining after the key 8.5k (S3) was lost for the 3rd time for the entire year is 3.2k.
Who even downvotes this? You're giving plenty of reasoning behind your sentiment.
A lot of fresh longs should have sl set below 7.2, so I don't expect any cascade before we break 7.1
It's not, but people are afraid of Koreans, they dump as soon as they hear the words "exchange" and "illegal" in one sentence, in any language.
In general, i would consider it a good thing (this is good for bitcoin TM). In the short term, exchange FUD nearly always leads to a price drop (albeit the price drop most of the time mysteriously already happened before it gets public) and since this is bitcoin market and not bitcoin hodling, we have to take it into account for our short term strategies.

Not really a great R/R on a short. 

I consider this a no trade zone. Personally I would wait it out 
Why do people keep talking about weekend dumps? That's not a thing, if anything, weekends tend to be more green than weekdays, on average. 
So does tradingview, which is substantially better unless you're trying to track orderbooks or multiple charts at once. 
Feels kinda bear trappy, but good luck on your trade!
>making far fewer losses compared to before 5th March.

But are you making a profit? 
Can you make a living off it? 
Probably when you stop trying to trade sideways or unclear directions, and let the winners run without being scared about potential missed profit.
Its rising on low volume and the complete lack of sell pressure doesnt make confidence. I think this is a bad timing to open a long since we have a shitton of resistance above and it has already bounced some

Disclaimer im short
Weekend bear trap.
And just yesterday someone was saying that we were leading into a weekend pump.

Weekend [whatever I need it to be to help either my emotions or position].
Volume is abysmal... I expect another sell off 
I love reading delusional bulls. Don't forget to add that you see a bull div.
$8.5k in a week?   That would register as a full reversal ...

It's possible we break to the upside here, but I suspect if we do it'll be a $200\-$300 relief rally before retesting the support line at $7k. 

If we do happen to reverse here... which I don't think is probable \(it is possible of course\), then it'd be incredibly bullish. 

Right now however, I'm just not seeing the buyers... any small rise is getting swatted down almost immediately. 
I know a lot of people have said this as well, but... the number of shorts is nothing compared to what it was then. And since the BGD has been pretty much universally agreed upon as the mother of all short squeezes, I don't think this is the same situation.
I wouldn’t be surprised if this pumps a bit more over the weekend, but I don’t see how this is reminiscent of the price action nor the sentiment before the BGD. Shorts were at ATH at 40k, and it was clear that whales were buying up everything possible below $6600 despite massive selling pressure. Now, we have half the number of shorts, 20k, with 5k of those being hedged, and it seems many people are buying here. If $7.4k holds for a few more days, or shorts start increasing as price goes up, then maybe this could pump. As it stands though, I see an upside of maybe $7800? I mean, there aren’t many shorts to squeeze as it is, so people are going to have to keep buying as the price climbs, which doesn’t seem to be working very well for bulls so far.

(Edit: To brag on myself a bit here, I could tell accumulation was happening around $6500 in April. I’m just not getting that impression here at all: https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8a6k3w/comment/dwwrgvx?st=JHMGSG11&sh=7c7ff0c5)
> This is feeling reminiscent of pre-BGD

It does doesn't it... I'm not liking it grinding the lows but I don't think going sideways for days like we did there is very probable though and I think buyers are more exhausted than sellers generally at the moment. Don't think we've seen any real accumulation for a BGD either but that obviously could change.

All the shorting whenever there's a bull run, greed, overall trend the past year has scared a lot of buyers away.  Sorry, that's the truth.

Good choice with Kraken! They have their issues for sure, but what I really like about Kraken is (1) they have a solid fiat on-ramp with wire transfers that work well and (2) they trade in real fiat and not Tether.

Good luck!
I just trade 10x on Bitmex and deposit to Mex when I get rekt. Hasn’t happened yet, but that’s my plan for now
Finex has sometimes problems with withdrawals. They get 'stuck'. You need to cancel them and send again.
Everyone aboard Air Icarus! 
keep dreaming 
When did we develop a jet that can stay in the air for 3 years?
ETH's natural cycle bottom just happened to match up this time with BTC's DCB#1 cycle bottom, that is what turned it into a slingshot. 

Now it corrects to .07 or less.
For finex you can use tradingview.com and search for BTCUSDLONGS or BTCUSDSHORTS

We sell it because we do see the value and want more of it. We sell to avcumulate 
What if I think today's Bitcoin will be worth $20K eventually by way of $4K? I want more than I have now, and I want more than I can buy at $4K, and I can get more without buying more. Why would I not?
You're getting triggered is that an indicator? I hope so. 
sell it = short it?

I think we need to revisit $7,200 one more time. We can't seem to come to any agreement at all in this range.

I won't downvote you but I disagree. If they are smart enough to invest in BTC then they should reap the rewards. If you are unhappy with the amount of wealth they have then you should vote for people who will increase taxes on them(as I do), the correct and fair way of redistributing wealth . Blocking people from certain economic activities, no matter who they are, is authoritarian, the antithesis of what BTC means. 
Its not like you can’t buy bitcoin right now, at discount prices no less.  Stop bitching about the rich and enrich yourself. 
Analysis of the year right here.

1 satoshi = 0.0076 cents.
Don't think of it like that. 1btc is an arbitrary number and theres only 21m ever. Bitcoin can easily have something akin to a "stock split" where we recognize mBTC or something.
At this point, I’m pretty numb to the price movement of bitcoin.

Up or down, sideways, moon or dirt .. I really just don’t care much anymore. We’re all in it for the long run aren’t we , eh?
EOS was not leading the market. It was just way overhyped. If anything besides BTC is leading the market, it's ETH.
I’m curious how many EOS tokens/coins will be lost because people haven’t registered them by the June 1st deadline.

If the price not going up is stopping you from being happy... red flag, man
I was honestly waiting to buy the dip as well, as I even unsuccessfully tried knife-catching at $7800. I believe we even agreed on a number of points here a few days ago. However, a quick dip at the predetermined price of $7250 for day traders to refill their bags seems almost too easy. I’m willing to be proven wrong if this gets pushed back past significant resistance, though I do admit it would suck a bit to miss out on the minor profits.

I think we are all ready for this months-long chop to be over though. It is seriously exhausting.
I agree with pretty much everything you’ve said here. I’ve got soft stops above the $8100 range on a low leverage short. However, the r/r ratio just doesn’t seem favorable for a long here. I realized that I lost a lot of potential profits on the way up and down on the latest move from trying to scalp, so I’m trying to make more long-term positions as well. Lets see how this plays out..
It's one mega hodler named Steve, but that's all anyone knows about him. Well that, and that he used to live in Pasadena.
It’s honestly hard to say. There are tons of whales out there, and it seems that sometimes a few will coordinate to push the price in a certain direction (I doubt any single whale could have been responsible for the massive BGD in April, for example, though the massive number of overleveraged shorts definitely played a part). However, other times it seems that whales will “fight” over the direction. They all can’t fill their bags at the same time, after all, and gaining a bigger piece of the pie is always to their advantage.

It’s honestly a bit of a nebulous idea, since it’s sometimes hard to see these moves outside of large buy/sell orders. Many people will even disagree that whales can have a great impact on market sentiment. However, it is what it is, and I’ve got to work with which theories seem most consistent for me as a trader.
I've said it before, whales are the crypto version of gods. They are invisible, there is no evidence for them, but they are in full control, and every time something happens it's because they caused it.

Maybe we should start sacrificing virgins to please the whales so that the price goes up and we'll all be rich. Maybe we should make commandments, like "thou shall not panic sell the bottom" and "thou shall not participate in altcoin pump&dumps".
I just copied and pasted. The whole article is too long to translate everything but thats the gist of it. Bithumb was involved in pretty sketchy coin listings, listing only the really minor shit coins for quick PnD so that might be the part of the investigation. Korean ICOs like Icon are being investigated too
not exchanges buying. I meant exchanges not really executing any customers orders. just taking commission fees and showing x imaginary number of coins
maybe its had an effect already. Not sure how long/much of an effect though
Stop trying to turn me on 
That's not really why I exited, I was playing it safe for Chewy there. 

I really need to stop giving buyers as much credit as I have been. Their impotence is staggering lately. 

It's just hard to watch a 3% frenzied push up and do anything but assume that buyers will continue pushing higher. 
It's the 3d chart that's the most bearish in my opinion. 

https://imgur.com/a/a18DpP3

Both MACD and MA saw a bearish cross immediately following a bullish cross. Buyers got all excited and then noped the fuck out and let sellers take over. 
Good question, I normally set pretty tight stops but was convinced we'd at least bounce off $7,800 to somewhere near my entry. Of course I was wrong and the price totally plummeted so now here I am with an estimated \-50&#37; ROE :\(
wtf?!
bad bot 
Depends on how long of a consolidation period the market goes through between $7,200 and $7,800.

If we spend another few days in this range, then a breakdown of that support Zone should signal that there's not much hope for support to hold in that range below.
Honestly, I'm not so sure.

Buyers appear to be just as reluctant here as they were yesterday at $7,650. 

There's definitely an overwhelming sense of "we're only doing this because we have to" on the buying side, as sloppy put it yesterday. 
I've been using and holding bitcoin for years now.  At no point in time has it ever ceased to be useful as a currency.  Transaction rates spike and fees spike with it, but those periods always pass and what we always come back to is a currency system that doesn't intentionally devalue like every fiat system world wide
  How it isn't more widely used is what is bewildering to me.  
I don't think Bitcoin needs to be used as currency for it to increase in value. Scarcity, immutability, and decentralisation are enough to make it useful as a safe store of value. "Store of value isn't a 'use' bruh...", shut up, yes it is. Like a closet stores your clothes, a safe stores your cash, a toolbox stores your tools, Bitcoin can store your wealth without needing to trust a bank or risk physical assets or company stocks.
Supply and demand. Only 17 million Bitcoins ...
Then why do you still hold bitcoin?
Dude don't bring facts and logic into this.  He has 24 upvotes with his cheerleading hopium post.

There will be another bull run, because there were some in the past.  That is why BTC will be $100,000,000 by 2029.

This is the argument I made last year in another one of these threads.  Why would someone spend something that's so volatile in value?  Someone's getting screwed over.  Either the buyer if it's at ATH or the seller if it's at a low.

Lightning is a step in the right direction.

Having a chance at replacing fiat currency will require it to somewhere stabilize in price, and be equally as fast and user friendly like your average Joe's debit card at the self-checkout lane.  I'm optimistic about it happening in the future if fundamentals continue to improve.
Scale in with logarithmic entries.

Eat like a bird, shit like an elephant.
Don’t worry. Once bitfinex and/or tether go down you’re going to be able to buy back A LOT cheaper. 
doesn't people say something like market trend 20 or 30% of the time 
Seriously. Okay guys, you had every opportunity to push through $7,500 this morning and failed miserably. What's your plan here if you do keep getting in the way?
More just taking advantage of the complete lack of buy pressure than anything. 

I basically was sitting watching the orderbook and thinking, "jesus christ, this is ridiculous. I wish I could add to my short here...oh wait, I can!"
R/R is pretty good actually. Shorting the breakdown of downward support is about the best case scenario. If it would just actually break down for good. Fakeout #6 in the last 3 hours
The pole for the pennant is less than 3%, and the target for a breakout would also be less than 3%. 

Even if it does break up and meet it's target, I'm not going to be too upset. Also, my exit is about 2% above current price anyway. 

In short, it's no big deal if I'm wrong.
A short rekt will only provide a better entry for sellers at that point, and by the number of shorts opened one can tell it won't be a 1000$ candle. To kickstart the magic longs have to be liquidated really. Really feels like the titanic is slowly vacillating, but that will accelerate eventually...

The upward momentum had to happen faster.
$7,550 and dropping. 

I'm using the trendline I posted in my edit to determine when I'll exit for a loss.
Agreed.  Trying to learn to stick to my targets.  I'd rather consistently hit singles and doubles than swing for the fences on every trade, especially with the chop we've had lately. 
But that's the trap I fall into-- I remember times when I could've made a killing if I let something run, and instead I end up losing my profits.  I've gotten liquidated that way more often than winning big (though now I trade on lower lev so liq isn't an issue).  Maybe being greedy works for some people, but I would prefer to learn to be disciplined and steadily build up my stash with 5-10% here and there.
Mike seems to have never-ending patience with his positions, Chewy makes lots of shorter term trades.
Just to answer this, no probably not. $1mm is a lot but not enough to move the market, especially on bitmex. there's generally anywhere from $30-40mm for each $100 price spread on bitmex
100% agree
Thanks man
It'll be interesting to see if shorts actually pile up again if we hit $7k ... if so we'd have a similar setup

That weekly chart is pretty scary IMO. I don't see why there's so much optimism at the moment. The weekly is just starting to look all kinds of bearish on so many levels even outside Ichi. Time will tell but I'm not hopeful here(well I am for my shorts but I'm not for the people who are going to get wrecked if they are not careful or HODLers).
Because it's Coinbase we're talking about. :|
Don’t worry, it will fuck you soon enough 
(raises hand) caught that ginsu knife Dec 2013. Still scarred (serious) I don't want to be in the red again for 3 years no matter what the outcome.

I don't know how to short and I don't want to know how to do leveraged trades.
whoa, it's almost like you are implying that the Bitmex and Futures are the cause of the downtrend..
In a way, i agree. shorted at 7400 a little bit yesterday but figuered that shorting this low was not the greatest idea. so whilst i believed that it would go lower (still do) i just dont think the R:R is there.
Just leave it. When closing just use xbusd  as the pair
Really grateful for the compliment! :))
That last sentence though...
Gut reaction more than anything. 

Buyers were absolutely steadfast above $7,400 for the entire day. When it finally fell, they immediately bought it back above $7,400. 

It was just odd, and it spooked me a bit.
Buyers showed up and crashed the party. Closed my short as well. Absolutely stupid behavior going on. 
Why would they be through the roof? 

Bitmex fees are very negligible, even for market orders: -.075%

For limit orders, they actually pay a maker fee to you: +.025%

I really don't understand the obsession with fees. Are people paying astronomical fees on other exchanges?
No trading is no fun.  If you have any kind of bias at all as to up or down, then only makes sense to place some bets on that.  I still see a broader downtrend (of course) so I'm short.  But the market is confusing overall for sure.

How can you mortgage your parents basement? 
The thing about this time last year is that BTC **doubled** in value between April and May. A bull run of that magnitude was going to attract attention; this time our context is less hyped for retail money

Not perma-bearish, but gotta balance the hopes
Miners don't sell at a discount lol. They sell for what it costs or higher or they hodl. 
Or they just can't be bothered to sell them.
ahh yes good point its a lagging indicator
I have two major resistance lines above us: 7530 and 7700

Like, were gonna need a bigger boat.
I mean the repeated attempts to break through 7400. Dip buyers will run out of coins before sellers/shorters, IMO. We'll see, though. 
When a price is tested so much, bounced off of and fails to break the local high, it’s generally a sign that if tested again it will break. 

Buyers have been extremely relentless with their buying power in then $9300-$9400 range, but constantly keep failing to break the $7650 area.

If they don’t break through that local high soon, expect lower prices as people will give up hope and stop buying 

To add, shorts should start stacking on too. 
It means she's goin down, matey!
deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.3265  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/21348)
So somewhere between $7300 and $7600 shorts started to crowd out longs on Bitmex. Something to keep in mind, given how dominant Bitmex is volume\-wise right now. 
I share the same opinion, until we reach a bottom and confirm with RSI its all speculation.
Im a bit new to the trading space.
So sorry but I have to ask what that exactly means (trying to learn).
Googled it, understand what you mean. Looking at it I think breakout will be downwards. Let’s see what happens
My symmetrical triangle is different, as I think two weeks is still possible before resolution. 
To me it looks more like a drop is coming (gut feeling)
How about 4k?
I wonder which side will want to exit positions ahead of a 3 day weekend in the US more? My money is on the "buy the dip" crowd (literally), but I guess we'll find out. 
What about the fact that we're now set up to start closing candles below the 50 week MA? Based on the support that that line has provided for both previous drops to 6K, followed by big bounces, I suspect that there's a good chance that it will swing down hard, once it's established as support turned resistance. Again, look back to 2014 and things look nearly identical -- we bounced twice off the 50 week MA, broke the downtrend line, bull trapped and then collapsed hard after breaking below the 50 week and stayed below the line for over a year afterwards. Crossing under marked the second phase of sell-off during that bear market before flat-lining in the $200 range several months later. Is there even a reasonable chance at touching the top of the triangle again if this is serving as resistance? I can't imagine closing several candles underneath, only to once again pop above, given how significantly this has served as support. The dog days are finally here, imo.

edit: yesterday closed ~0.5% under the 50 week, which could be chopped up to noise. But if it closes in this current range today, that'll be ~2% underneath, which is significant and the first time doing so since Aug 2015. 
Low productivity chart stalking day, one of my favs 
If crypto isn’t your life, you’re doing it wrong 
I’m a frequent flyer around here, you should see me pretty often. 

In your case, the amount of resistance above actually allowed you not to babysit your position. Didn’t expect it to just blast through 7.9k and make the resistance it’s bitch. I actually went to sleep with no stops, and only profit taking ( which hit ).
At one point, I actually continuously lost so much trading it felt normal. I’ve now made more than 100% of my entire stack back. It’s pretty easy to short in a bear market though, lol 
When things getbtgst predictable in this market is when most people get burnt 
I probably wouldn’t short that actually. Would be our 3rd rejecting off this bottom range and now our 3rd attempt to break through the top. Would be interesting to see what would happen. 

If this Bart’s back up I’ll just lol, but I don’t  think it’s going too 
Did this thing really just bart back up???? 

Wish I closed all of it, but at least i locked in some nice profits 
yup, far from that today. i mean just look at the bitfinex funding. whenever you get a few million there they get vacuumed out and put into longs on crappy alts. its just pure greed all around right now
You make more money longing than shorting.

If you short X contracts, the most you can ever profit on that trade is X USD.

If you long X contracts, your USD profits are unbounded
> and then there's just no one left to short the damn thing.

There wasn't 100x back then.  You could only short 3x on Bitfinex.  So there is no practical limit to how much profit can be made from shorting this down very low.
 Even the master learned from someone, huh? You called that short earlier, Sloppy. Also don't you ever sleep?
> Why is the 50-week MA so important? Why would it be important for bitcoin? (hides for incoming 2014 reference...). What about 50-month MA?

MA show you where the price is relative to the trend and how the trend is changing. 50 period MA is just a common one and people trade based on it -- but 40 or 60 week MA would also provide similar insight into the trend over that range. Like any TA, it's just another visual tool to look at market behavior / price action. 

The 50 *month* MA would be more relevant if Bitcoin were ever known to oscillate around that average but of course it's always been way above it since month 50.

>At which point do higher timeframes become meaningless and lose their causal influence on lower timeframes?

The relationship isn't necessarily 'causal' except that traders do trade technical indicators. If the price starts closing under the 50 week MA, that's a sign that the market has really shifted momentum. Even though it's a lagging indicator, it still has relevance to market confidence and sentiment.

edit: it's worth mentioning that hunting for MA's that fit the historic chart should not be seen as cherry picking patterns to fit your bias. Instead, finding an average that has served or support or resistance several times (just like a trend line should at least 2 or 3 times) tells you something about the length of the cycle. Same thing for MA crosses and changes in their directions. 128 day MA is example of an odd choice that happens to fit pretty well over the past year or two.
it's not necessarily important it just gives people an idea of the longer term direction of the asset. 

I mean, if you saw the 50 weekly MA cross up after it'd been below it for 2 years you'd see that as particularly bullish, yes? 

Look at what happened when it crossed down in 2014 and then up in 2015...

there is no causal influence - it's just an indicator. just a different way of looking at what's already in front of your face on the charts 
8380 kittens
ha!
Nah, one market order isn't stop hunting, it needs to be followed by couple others to push the price down. Stops are usually trading price.

This is just big player exiting long or entering short.
I just closed my short on ETH that almost covered what i lost this morning getting stopped on another ETH short.

Will ride my BTC short a while more to see what 7400 does. It it breaks i might close half on the next level, around 7350 or so. If this goes back up i just might set stop loss in profit and forget about this position... It's giving more trouble than the profit i can take from it...
yea we were in the $6k range for like...2 weeks? before it pumped. Might be some sideways here, especially since we've never really had sideways in the $7ks before
I am not too sure if we had the adoption back when we were shooting for $20,000. 

Price is just a number, what matters is the percentage. I want to see double digit movements with my investment, it can be done in both the $100 range and the one we are currently in. I hope we find the true value of Bitcoin soon.. 
It's adopted as a store of value, as which it is performing amazingly. 
What kind of "real world adoption" are you expecting?

People are not likely to start nudging hardware wallets on the street markets to make transactions any time soon.

Crypto market rose to 800 billion just a while ago, that is a crap ton of adoption in my book. You have a lot more exchanges today than 3 years ago, that is a lot more adoption. The developer ecosystem around crypto is larger than ever and is rising, that is a lot more adoption.

And yes, crypto means BTC in the sense that BTC price is a measurement of trust people place into electronic decentralized monetary issuance systems.
omg I was joking 😂 it's definitely not a wedge. No real points of contact where it swings back and forth, just an ascending line and a descending line
Me too.

Sellers don't have to, price is trending down without much selling. Impetus is on buyers.
$10K to $7.5K in a couple of weeks seems pretty convicted.
Why would you think that there is more downside left (in the short-term)? I have a comment below with a chart if you're interested in my thoughts.

This. And also 99% of the general public could give two shits about crypto or bitcoin. 
my friend said he was waiting for btc to be $100 before he bought. then he bought some random shitcoin WAVES at $5.50 (note it's $4.74 right now lol)
some people xD

more of a town, that one
Haha, I don’t think I have ever laughed out that loud from a post in this sub so unexpectedly, good job 😂
hahahah 
details on portugal?
the comment he's referring to is a comment in 2014 referencing a comment from the short bear market of 2013. :P
And a cold shower
Also, that pennant lasted ~14 days. If this does pump, it likely can’t go far, since it has only been two days and the pennant is about to close soon.
It's on the 4hourly. 

It is a pennant but we got the same formation in April before the bounce.
in fact, june premium is up from -$10 to +$15, september futures back to $100 premium from like $70-80 yesterday, funding rate is now positive (longs pay shorts) again and the up contract on bitmex is ahead of the down by a bit
So perhaps the bounce won't erupt quite the way it did then but I'm still leaning towards another DCB at this stage
What bearish sentiment? Yours? 

It could be $15K in a month -- plenty of precedent for a doubling in price in a period of one month. Has happened many times.  
As they say, certainty is the death of intelligence.
Don't get me wrong. I'm not calling for moon or even trend reversal. I'm trying to build the case for a DCB here.
Yes, you have to be one step ahead of the market. Tools like how many shorts/longs are open help you figure out what the market is thinking. In a bull market, its easy to open a long and forget about it while you take money away from all the new players entering the space, as well as greed that causes high evaluations.
still... with that many longs closing/taking profit, any move up will be throttled
I'm not *expecting* $3k. I am confident in saying though, that 4.7k is somewhat likely. Its impossible to call a bottom in advance, we just have to see how the market behaves when it gets there. But if we **do** get to 3k, I expect it to be the best buying opportunity you'll ever get again and you might only have seconds to pull the trigger.
People are scared of BGD. But high shorts is a key ingredient to a BGD. All I see is consistent lower highs with less bulls to trap over time, and plenty of longs to squeeze out. All the shorts that are open that never closed since the BGD will be closed by the liquidated longs.
I first bought my first bitcoin in Dec 2013 and in March of this year became a no-coiner for the first time since when I first bought. Bought back in April and became a no-coiner a couple nights ago when we dipped below $8K. When I sold off in March mainly for taxes and to take a mental break, I was FOMO ing like crazy. This time not so much and am no rush to get back in. I will gladly buy above what I sold off for if market sentiment changes since what difference does a couple K make when we are at $35K EOY? /s 
No, I want to know, if this has an influence on the price.

Well it has about as much predictive power as the people who post lines drawn on a chart here on an hourly basis, usually wrong

At least google trends is actual data 
I think it will happen much sooner, next 8 hrs
Wouldn't that be a hidden bearish div? Only visible on the 2h though and might have already played out with the latest drop.
You are talking about a triangle of a much larger degree, but no worry my friend. If you look at the very bottom of my posted chart you see a purple line. That line is indeed the same one you just posted :P
Thanks.

On a short time frame I don't use log.
Could you elaborate on this? I'm not great at spotting these things. 
You’re right reminds me of the drop from 9.9k to 9.2 and how if flagged all the way to 9.4. 
It would be interesting to see what happens when it meets the 10k downtrend line resistance...

edit: oops I mean the 8.6k line

[chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/95M42Q84/)
I closed mine too, profit was great but disappointed I couldnt get more from it. Exhausted with this and irl stuff. Will have a good rest and return tomorrow. Plenty more opportunities on horizon. :)
wow, nice work averaging that out to this point.

I'm feeling less certain myself. Part of that has to do w getting stopped out of my short by a stupid mex wick. wanted some profit but wish I had seen the triangle before setting stops. 

wouldn't be a terrible idea to close here and just trade a breakout if you're getting fed up.

Although this post-pump follow through has not been impressive so far
Agree. I'm very cautious. The thing is I'm too sentimental about bitcoin and it affects my trading decisions \- I'm constantly finding a reason to go long. It's very refreshing to watch someone rational.
I think it's funny. Are you long?
its there, pretty noticeable on either time frame lower than the daily. 
bad wording, I tried to say buying into the right shoulder oh well lol. hope we can at least get back to the neckline for safety. either way risk to reward is fair enough for me, if we dip below the obvious low ill hit the panic sell.
Yeah sure but a bubble is a bubble. Anyway those two charts were supposed to show that in a linear sense we almost returned to the mean. 
Yes, question is will it return to the mean of the 2017 trend or the 2015 trend.
As someone who has been around for a while, I can comment on the fact that there's still general public out there shorting alts/bitcoin or longing alts/bitcoin and surviving. Look at the volume...where's the capitulation? Where's the shakeout? We had an ATH followed by a great dump right after, but we haven't had anything near max pain.  
This book has a cover but the story isn't even close to being finished. Still a lot of empty pages.
I still see the bitcoin network as a bank for people fed up with intentional devaluing of their countries currency.  And in my opinion, the assets held by the network should be on par with any major fiat bank on the planet.  That will put us in the 2T market cap ball park, 10x+ from where we are now on price. i plan to hold at least until we get there 
Was 19.99k a bubble or just organic growth? It's not different this time, it's the same as 2014.
ETH has 90 mil coins, EOS has 1 billion. 

ETH took ~~2 years~~  9 months to reach 10 dollars (at a supply of about 31 million)

Bitshares has 2.x billion coins and is 19 cents. While it seems abandoned by Larimer, it still works. I'm trying to put into perspective and rationalize prices here. Bitshares also launched in a similar manner back in august 14 and only reached 30 cents or so. 

edit: Also, do we have any idea whether EOS will succeed? Everyone claiming it's the ETH killer...sounds just like EVERY SINGLE ALT COIN EVER comparing to the top coins.
>EOS did not just launch.  

Correct. It hasn't even launched yet.
Ok thanks, and I try to use Log scale, so not sure how that happened.

But with log scale, it looks even worse:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/3jJ1iRuS/

How do you figure it is $400 away?  What did you draw differently?

Depends how many people use linear... Remember last linear resistance?

This may actually explain the buying pressure below 7.4.
What's wrong with linear though?
Broke yesterday Actually ( Yellow ) 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/V6u9eRqG/
yes that's always how it is. the rule of thumb for me is add 5% to the top 10 coins, then 5% top top 50 in volatility compared to BTC to get a idea of their movements
I noticed you [referenced this](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:market_analysis:identifying_elliott_wave_patterns#horizontal_triangles) a lot in your posts. 

Just pointing out the incoming wave into that pattern is not the A wave, the first reactionary wave is. The origin of A is so far from the tread line you have drawn I question its validity, and the fact B did not even manage to retrace 50% of A is also a red flag.

A triangle is possible here but not drawn like that. For them to function as reversal patterns they should come off a double (WXY) or triple (WXYXZ) combo correction and always the last in the pattern. [Like this](https://elliottwave-forecast.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/bullish-wxy-triangle.jpg).

[Which fits our current action.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/9CiJ4Lib/)
Are you using log scale on your chart?  [I'm seeing the resistance line at $7000](https://www.tradingview.com/x/bkD9A9sl/)
Excellent analysis, thanks!
I used numbers gathered from the blockchain. Added those numbers to the economies GDP, multiplied by the population per capita. Finally, I divided the number by the total bitcoins in circulation, and as you can see - we are clearly on the third leg of the triple bottom.
Well I sure hope I am wrong then.  But I agree if it happens, that from BTC's ashes something hopefully much better will arise and that everyone in this subreddit is in a position to take advantage of it, as long as it isn't BCH I am okay with that.
Just as a heads up, I do not refer to historical charts while coming to my conclusion, I am only concerned with current year volume/price/mean regression (as mathematically calculated pivot points).
>Who even downvotes this?


Permabulls who don't like what he said.
I feel like the weekends are better for bounces than anything else. If trend is down, price bounces back up on the weekend before resuming. If trend is up, price bleeds for a bit on the weekend before resuming. It may just be me trying to find patterns where there aren’t any though.
I agree
Someone actually did data analysis on it and Sundays are statistically more often red than green. I believe it was statistically significant too 
Because people see patterns where there are none.   There used to be some truth here though because the price was pumped ahead of OkCoin futures expiration on Thursday night.


But profit doesn't distinguish between a competent trader and a lucky one. 

I'm asking specifically about competence.



But that's going to be quite subjective / variable based on your living costs / starting capital etc.

I guess I was think more about the core skillset of the trader
What makes you think we're not? I don't care which way it goes. Down, happy to buy. Up, happy to hold.
Will you guys stop with the hackneyed talking-point-like insults? "Delusional" is not correct. We have rational reasons and nine years of history informing our bullish sentiment. 
The lower price gets, the more and more delusional they become.  But eventually it can go so low, that they are just broken..well, most of them anyway.
I think the belief and hope in another 1h 17% green candle is what will cause this to bleed. The confluence of factors on that was a rare combination of events and it likely won't happen again, at least not for a while or until a capitulation wick

Everyone will continue to buy the dips and then sell +/- 5% of where they bought
Was looking at the wrong scale for my timeline prediction--it would be more like 2-3 weeks.
It's not so much that I expect another BGD--I don't for the reasons you say (no way that short squeeze will happen here). But I am just reminded of everybody feeling that 6k was inevitable and there was a vibe of "who the fuck is buying here". I think bear sentiment is roughly the same but people are just burned from that epic short squeeze. I think a $200-300 BGD from a MM is not out of the question though.
Here in the US we have a 3 day weekend going with many people travelling. People might buy and set stop losses or set low buy orders. I don't see a lot of buying pressure this weekend at least here in the US.
It can’t feel the same as the BGD until there are considerably more shorts open than longs.
Well I didn't say that :) I don't see the market sustaining a bull run past 9k personally
You being serious? 
I would love to actually see some numbers instead of anecdotes. And I'm also not sure what you're implying. Are you saying bitcoin is dead and we won't be going up anymore? Or just in the short term? And the overall trend for the past year is up, so do you mean past 5 months? And we don't need a lot of buyers to go up, you just need consistent buying. The price of BTC can actually go up with a constant number of people (but it can also go down with a constant number of people).
Shorting doesn't lower the price, you know that right? It actually helps soften the landing
posted new comment!
how the hell would a layman hear anything substantial about the crypto industry/market in the country he lives in? just because you're American, does that mean you have access to insider knowledge about upcoming regulatory measures or other industry knowledge? 
I am not joking. A Korean article was published 2 hrs ago about Korea govt cracking down on exchanges and ICOs. General crypto in general. The tone of the article was pretty serious this time. For real this time.. lol

Seems to be no effect so far. We will let the whales decide
I’m just waiting for this to continue to flag sideways out of the pennant. That’s totally something bitcoin would do at this point.
Wouldn’t this be the moment for a breakdown? 
Cause I'm way too tired and volume isn't there. This could go on for 4 more hours until it is resolved. And there are no buyers to be found. Also I can just buy the breakout or short the breakdown.
it went through after 2 hours. 
I make dreams a reality, it's my job!
3 hours ago, fresh off the line.
If $545 drops, $420 \(blaze it\) is next. I'd short it if I didn't think BTC was going to drop as well.
Awesome! Thank you!
Just be aware, that data is from Bitfinex, and they allow wash lending.
Wow, this looks very nice my friend. Thank you!
 Awesome! Thank you! 
Yeah. SHORTs 20204 and LONGs 31459. So the route of maximum pain to drop down for BTC.
I see. The start of the line is about 50 dollars higher on Bitfinex than on Bitstamp. Either way, not a strong bounce
Selling is one thing, shorting <10k is another.

Personally, I don't short. To me, shorting BTC < 10k is analogous to ripping up my birth certificate.
Markets don't work like that.
I'm pretty comfy myself.

Edit: you know what does piss me off though? all the new participants just in it for the money. sure, money is great but you need to understand the tech and why Bitcoin was created in the first place.
Do you, pick your poison.
thank you, i will edit.
Yes of course ! Just a crazy supposition 
"Vote for people who will increase taxes on them..." You must be joking!? They own the tax system! And the last time I checked, they never went about hoarding, stealing, killing, and pillaging their way to their millions through the electorate process. They did so on the backs and flesh of the electorate. So no... I'm not going to be that naive!
Fully agree. See my comment one thread above :)
they're working on a smart contract that will help people re-claim their tokens that they did not register before the main-net
I don't want to be stuck in a $100 range forever, I want to see movements. Of course this is going to make me unhappy with the market..
Yeah this is exactly the case right now I agree. We can see the real demand in the $7,200, thus I want to revisit it before I get crazy of this exhaustion lol.

> I think we are all ready for this months-long chop to be over though. 

I pray this comes true asap. 
Exactly... Prepare for potential chaos instead of dreaming of moon and you want a nice comfortable position that you can manage on the way down that keeps you totally hedged at least. You don't want to be the person shorting a 3K breakdown if we fall below 5K and if we go up then theres potential to make money then not as if it's that hard to do in a bullish bitcoin market.
aka SteveS (sorry for the shitpost)
Right, so they would have to actually move coins between user wallets? If so that means they would execute real transactions on the coin’s blockchain?
You cheeky bastards. Enough with the tease, bring out the preferred color BXD
Does the fact that we went from $6.8k to $7.8k via a single BGD have any impact on how you foresee us dropping back from $7.8k? For example, wouldn’t one expect little to no resistance on the drop back towards $6.8k (should we start dropping again from here)

EDIT One would think that the weak bounces we’ve seen off of $7.3k are indicative of little to no buying pressure, and most likely came from shorts closing who opened earlier this week?
You ever try trading with inverse charts to try and put the market in perspective? I'm not saying your wrong at all but that shit looks like it bottomed hard and is ready to go up it really doesn't look good at all to me. I'm not looking for a long term long entry. I've been building a short sliding the leverage up to 100x once it's 1K in the clear (and putting a stop in profit) on Sept futures and then playing the bounces on either the June or perpetuals to hedge the gains on the short without having to give up the position. 

I dont think this will end until people stop trying to buy every dip and we have some real capitulation.It just seems to me that at most we may have an upside of 2.5K to 10K atm but a potential downside of maybe 2.5-6K but at very least down another 2.5-2.9K to 4.6-5K area.
Nasty, hope it works out for you/us! Good luck.
One way to play this situation out longer is that you can wait for a dump in the september futures, then roll your position from the june to september and have a longer time frame to work with.

It might not even be a bad time to do it now, the spread between the two is quite low as it is.  If the prices go up as you're expecting to then the september futures will see a bigger jump.
If the prices go down then september futures will still take 2 months to start losing premium.

tl;dr At this point an underwater long on june is better switched to september
Oh I thought he said furher 
Are you sure about that? Because I am 99.96386% sure that craigspencer2 is not a bot.

My underwater short saga continues for now. Reduced 25% in profit at 7380 this morning, added it back in over 7500. I'm still underwater, but it's about 7460 average right now. I've had a couple opportunities to close it as a tiny net loss since the first leg up this morning, but I'm still holding on for now. I'm honestly just starting to get trade exhaustion on it, and it's sucking some joy out of the short from 8310 I'm still holding lol
Yeah I dunno, had enough trouble breaking 7.6 yesterday and now it looks like 7.5 is putting up quite a bit of resistance. 
what did you think about the rejection at 7300? 
Do you ever use stop market orders to try to get an entry on a breakout/breakdown?  Of us that too risky?
Thing is, whilst it can be used as a currency (I've bought things with it fairly recently), it doesn't offer anything meaningful over fiat for most people. Even in terms of international transactions, if I use Monzo or Revolut or one of the many others I pay next to nothing in fees anyway. The decentralised nature is great but most people (and understandably so) just don't care.
I get that - but where's the demand? Why should your average Joe buy Bitcoin?
Because I might be wrong. Hedging one's bets and all that.
To be honest it's not even the fluctuations in price that make me doubt Bitcoin - it's that I genuinely cannot realistically see your average Joe using it. The problems that fiat currency has do affect us - I think that's why we're using BTC, but I think most people just don't care. And to be fair, I can't blame them. 

I genuinely do hope you're right - please do not think I'm attacking you personally for thinking differently than myself. I would love to be proven wrong. I'm just struggling to see BTC becoming anything other than a niche interest when the only reason I can see the general public wanting it is because they have potential to get rich from it, even though they probably won't.

I should say - I don't think it's impossible. If Lightning Network could be made well, quite frankly, an order of magnitude more user friendly than it is now, I could see it becoming more mainstream. What seems more likely to me though, is what companies like Revolut already offer, becoming more mainstream. That is, BTC that's off-chain, or rather, BTC that isn't BTC.
> Having a chance at replacing fiat currency 

And how do you think it's going to replace fiat currency, when countries will just make it illegal if there is ever even a remote threat of that happening.  It's already illegal to be used as a currency for at least half the earth's population. 

Some of you really are living a bizarro fantasy world.  
well the only hope is that it goes up forever. if in 5 years btc isn't above $20k i guess it's ded
...but....but...but...the dip...

...I bought it...

*you promised!*
This whole price action in last 24h+ is ridiculous. I know we're in $300 range which is basically noise, but damn...
Then why take the trade at all here? Upside on this trade seems limited.
Hmmm, I was thinking of this [one.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/tZY1530K/) But I think you know what you are doing way better. GL!
There's 10k trendline just a bit higher, looks a bit stronger resistance, why not there?
Been trading for months and still have problem with taking small wins, but it gets better and better.
Yes it's a tough call and I certainly haven't figured it out yet.
Part of it is that you can't think every time it's going to be "the one"

You have to have good reasoning as for why it was the top or the bottom 
Mike is one of the cases where he can stay liquid longer than the market can stay irrational. 
If $1mm can move the price by say $5 then its enough to keep doing it and making a really good ROE.

But will it slap my ass and let me call it daddy?
Leveraged trades are what puts hair on your balls, but gray hairs on your head 
No, not what I meant. I meant that price would go faster down and this bear trend would be over sooner if more people would short. If only thing I can profit from is buy low sell high then I buy the dip and sell the top.
I mean relatively speaking. The right move in my analysis would have been to short around 9500 and hold it until now, or a reversal appeared. But I don't see anyone holding a short from 10k-9.5k in these parts. Relatively speaking we've all got weak hands af. For example, my current short is 3x from 7850. What happened at 7850 on the chart? Fuck if I know. Why wasn't I in position? Fuck if I know.
Earlier today when the price dropped into the 7350 range, buyers aggressively bought it up, bringing the price up to about 7500.

Just now when the price dropped to 7400, buyers jumped on it, but the price barely got to 7430.  To me that looks like buyers are losing interest.  

Price hovering around 7400 now.  Seems like being short is still the place to be until 7500 is broken convincingly.  
I'm definitely with you on the spooked feeling. Add to my short with a small market short when 7400 broke then was flabbergasted that it rebounded so hard off 7363. Still short, but definitely keeping an eye on 7500.
Fees on BFX are not cheap for scalping. It's 0.4% taker or 0.2% maker that goes down as you trade volume.
I dont know to be honest, dont really pay attention to them myself, but i only make a couple of trades a week tops.

Just figuered it stacks up eventually.
How do you short BTC?  Ive been involved with crypto for about a year now and still dont know how to do this.  Maybe its an exchange option I dont get? Or is it a trading method? 
I'd like to submit this trade as exhibit A for why win rate is a shitty measure of somebody's overall success as a trader. 

PnL of .02% is technically a "winning" trade. But who cares if you are right 19 times out of 20 for .02% each time, but your 20th trade results in a 1% loss?
You can always tokenize it
I agree, but don’t forget thay war are more than half off ATH, and people could consider the possibility that we will be back at ATH one day
I wasn't talking about the coins, I was talking about the equipment.

If we saw an influx of equipment selling for 1/2 price from original buyers then that would tell us that they don't expect to get a good price for their btc by the time enough are mined, relative to when they bought it.
What do you mean they can't be bothered?

To increase hash rate we're talking about millions of dollars of investment, that's not something you don't 'bother' with. 

"hey i'll just set up a facility, arrange power contracts with utilities and man power to secure and maintain the equipment and run the ops all for a loss ...simply because I can't be bothered trying to sell them"
Exactly what I meant.
Arr
i read paper valuations on the link provided and assumed. :P
I think those rates are calculated differently
Something to keep in mind maybe for your stoplosses if you trade on bitmex and dont wanna be hit by a classic bitmex overshoot. Completely irrelevant for the market direction though imho, bitmex traders all have their tab with bitfinex open and follow it like a hawk. 
i reckon these are just fakekout drops. I'm betting here we make another higher low and in the next few hours have a bgd. Will hold onto long until a break of 7250. I sold a big stack in high 8's and shorted with it. Longing here is a bit of a hedge on that, though still awaiting a bigger downmove hence in fiat.
Like yourself I am very fatigued after almost doubling my trading stack in the last 10 days...so I for one am on the sidelines...again as you have said before about yourself in the past, I too have to know when to take a break after a great run rather than get into gambling with my winnings!

Peace  
Nothing would surprise me at this point. 

I want to see a strong push down that consolidates for a few months to years, but ever since the market pumped so randomly from the last touch of the $6,000s, I'm not so certain. 
It looks like its going back up and the alts are leading the charge.
Short on BTC not looking good right now.  I should've closed at 7330.
Agree, we can't keep rejecting that level without it not testing the upper resistance soon instead.
Even in a bear market, it only takes a 2&#37; rebound in BTC to get a 10&#37;\+ rebound on an alt.  Do that on leverage and you're able to bank huge returns.  I think you can still make good money longing in a bear market if you are patient.  


I find I can often pick pretty good points in a bear market to put in a long.  I can then make a reasonable exit.  My leaks as a trader happen after that profitable trade.  I start looking for another entry, definitely from the positive experience from before.  A few profitable trades and I can't help but overtrading.  


People who have good patience should be able to make money just buying big crashes and aiming for a 5\-10&#37; bounce.  The more things crash, the more extreme the bounces.
Well yea I just mean make more money shorting because the trend is down. Kind of like a mooning in reverse
Right I mainly mean like when there are no sellers left. 

Someone else put it nicely that a bubble doesn't pop from strong selling, it pops when there are no buyers left.

I think it will be that in reverse 
It's really crazy how on point chewy is sometimes. He's really got an insane grasp on the market.

And yes, I did. I actually said a 100x short from $8390 would be fun to do a few days ago- price never got above like $8420. Could've been dumb luck but I gotta say I'm getting at least decent at calling some of these tops.

To be fair, saying "the price is going to go down" hasn't been particularly hard to be right at lately.

And no. I trade bitcoin, why would I sleep? :P

I actually sleep a lot more than I used to. I was getting 6 hours every night back in february to april. Now I'm sleeping 7-8 hours a night which is much better for me and my health. I finally got back into the gym lately which is really nice as well

Trading is much easier when you have a clear head and are in a good mental and physical state

For me very long timeframes such as 50 weeks are difficult to get a grasp on (regardless if it is bullish/bearish). 

This is also my problem with people making extrapolations of the weekly chart, either claiming we "must" go back to 1.3k or eventually "must" end up at 100k.

I see bearish/bullish momentum as accumulating bottom-up (like a rolling snowball getting bigger). Alternatively, starting from higher timeframes is like saying there is a certain current/flow in the big sea (higher timeframes) and the smaller waves (lower timeframes) have to follow this movement no matter what.

Methodologically I am more inclined to follow the first option and readjust my outlook constantly by processing new (empirical) data.
Dead kittens. :(
Always learning ;)
I hear you. I'm holding a short that's gone red/green/red/green/red/green since 8am this morning. I'm really considering cutting it right here for basically break even after fees, but it does seem to be taking the stairs down since this morning's express elevator up. 
All of our recent fat drops have happened with extremely tight bbands on higher time frames. The drop from 9.9k to 8.2k happened when the 1D bbands were the tightest they've been in over half a year.

Our most recent drop from 8.6k to here, the 12hr bbands were tighter than a birth canal.
a sloppy wedge. own it.
oof I got bamboozled
Don't know why you would type in Spanish, but I think we're pretty inclusive.
no failing to make new lows is not convincing at all.
Because the trend is down.  You are saying the trend is about to reverse.  You are saying there is about to be a trend reversal and you are giving no reasons for why you or anyone else would think that.
> the BB on the hourly is turning downwards and the 3H is cooled off and could be primed for a dump in the near future. RSI isnt that low either and a possible MACD rejection. Were also vandering nicely below the 1h cloud, and seemed to have bounced off the middle of the 1h BB. And not to forget that bear pennant that is forming. The volume is awfully low and that makes it hard to trust any pump or dump atm imo
Because bitcoin is at 7500. Plenty of downside, bands pushing a little outward, not many shorts to squeeze for propulsion upward, good news does nothing for price, 2 years until halving, very little price exploration in the 4-6k range. 
For now...
He could have done worse, considering that most of the alts lost like 80-90% of their ATH value.
Could easily do 100x though. 
He's a wacko. He says $15,000 by the end of June?


Is he just a really dedicated shitposter or does he actually believe this?

I see. Possibly, but it's a pretty small bull div. 
This is insane.

Bulls are buying up like crazy just to stop it couple bucks higher...
Why are you building the case for a DCB? The cat is alive. It will wake up and hop up in the windowsill soon enough.
While you’re getting beat up here, I do see where you are coming from for a bit. This could definitely pump up a bit to ~$7800 to liquidate some shorts before heading down further. I’m just not sure if I see the r/r ratio being worth it. If you’re right, the price jumps ~$200-$300 and you make a small profit. If it dumps, you are stuck in an underwater long, with potentially no profitable exit if this breaks any further significant supports. I would look for signs of a reversal before betting on a long at this point, or at least buy on a previous support level so you can set a safe stop loss close below. Either way, I would babysit that long pretty closely unless this thing shows signs of reversal.
and that is exactly what's wrong with this market. pumps and dumps are throttled from leveraged positions closing. what retail investor who wants to just hodl want to get caught up in this mess?
If we hit 3k again, 1800 is a certainty shortly after.
> We're still above this line. Anticipating spending a few years below it again.

The line is somewhere around $3800 right now, right?  What am I missing?  One post says years and the other says seconds.
This, is delusion. We haven't been anywhere close to 3-4k in 9 months, consistently making higher lowers, yet bulls are delusional for calling 10k or 15k?...
I bought my first in Dec 2017. I've been holding for about 5 and a half months now. I think I've maybe gone about 4 hours at most without thinking of crypto in some way.


Does the current market remind you of the 2014 market in terms of sentiment, etc? The only thing keeping me even remotely bullish is good fundamentals.
If you long or short on Kraken of BFX that has an effect on spot price. Every long is basically a buy that you need to sell back (at a profit or a loss) if this is leveraged up there will be a liquidation price when the position will be forced to close(sell). Every short is basically a sell now that need to be bought back so they tend to work as a landing mat when the price is going down or fuel when the price is going up(and the reverse is true for longs).
It does. When you short on bfx you literally sell coins. When you long you literally buy. A lot of longs have closed so a lot of btc has been sold (obviously)
BitMEX doesn't. I believe Bitfinex and kraken does, but I could be wrong 
Whoa, nice find. Thanks for sharing.

Price over time is not data.... TIL
Yes you're correct, it was a hidden bear div and it already played out, but I think the divergence will continue with one last lower high (and rsi higher high) before a bigger drop to 6.9-7.1k.
Hidden purple “ Dont let coinguru see” bull div, got it. 

So you think we are gonna bounce up to top of triangle? 
bear pennant: https://www.tradingview.com/x/xlWHdl6p/
Sorry, out of town this weekend and only on mobile so can't really chart. Look at the 4 or 6 hr chart. The pole is from 8.6 down to 7.25 and the flag is everything that follows.

Definitely could break up, but damn if that breaks down things could get scary for bulls. 
Only through strong (stupid?) hands, which were only made possible by my ludicrously large short on Jun futures from 8310. It's easier to trade placidly when you're holding a position that's over 100% ROE with 80% of your stack. 
Yeah, considering I held from 7330 up into the 7600s, I'm going to let this one go a bit longer. I have catastrophic stops on both positions that would result in an overall 20% stack increase from $8300 levels. 
That wick stopped my short too (by just $5). 7550 was just below my entry at 7565, so at least my tuna sub is paid for today. Might even splurge for the foot long.

I became less thrilled with my entry as the day played out yesterday, but I didn't want to add any more to it in the 7600-7650 range, since this swaps short was already in addition to a futures short I have open. 

Looking at that triangle that appears to be forming, hopefully this is an opportunity to pick off a better entry. 

edit: clarity
yes. not because of chewy though. although I appreciate all his content 
True. Also, ETH bounced off weekly (log) support from way back. 
I still don't understand why it is written in the stone "the need for capitulation and Max pain". Really, the previous ATH was an abomination and we have had two market crashes ever since. The dumb money that inflated crypto to that level regardless of fundementals got out, committed suicide, shit the bed and/or continues to hodl. This is a new phase in the market, we're closer to adoption, many major projects are maturing and creating large networks. I wouldn't compare it to the previous years. 2018 is setting a new trend. Teen years of crypto, if you will.
Indeed!

So let it be written

So let it be done

To kill the first born pharaoh son

Ya the blow-off top got out of control and it corrected, we have had that in the past [all the time](https://cdn.howmuch.net/articles/bitcoin-horrific-crashes-865c.png) I'm not sure what your point is, the last minute dumb money has gotten shaken-out and now we're ranging [sideways](https://snag.gy/P3JRwu.jpg).   

I guess the two simplified "this market is overvalued and will crash to nothing" and "not enough max pain" get regurgitated so much it gets old how many times I hear this with no basis or valuation.  People always say that and give nothing else, what's your valuation of the market cap of crypto? What do you think things are worth (roughly)? Or we just going to keep saying not enough pain and overvalued until it corrects?
Could organic growth be exponential?
ETH took 9 months to reach 10 dollars.

If people actually *knew* EOS is going to succeed at what they set out to do, their valuation would be a whole lot higher than it is right now...
EOS is traded on exchanges.  The digital tokens launched many months ago.
My apologies, we're talking about different lines. 

I'm referring to the shorter trendline with $6,000 and $6,400 as the two points of contact. That line is right around $7,000 at the moment. 
This is a really good point. It does line up nicely.
Linear scale assumes every $100 is equal. When that's not the reality of the market. 

Moving from $1,000 to $1,100 was a 10% move, and kind of a big deal. It's the equivalent of moving from $7,000 to $7,700. But on linear scale it's equivalent to moving from $7,000 to $7,100. 

Linear scale is fine when you're on low timeframes, because you're usually comparing apples to apples. 

But when you're charting wide price ranges, log scale ensures you're charting moves relative to each other. 
I'm not sure I agree. If we look at the 2014 boom/bust, [we touched town twice there as well, only to break through 2 weeks later and keep going down](https://imgur.com/a/T3bjOe5). In particular, what interests me is the near symmetry from peak to trendline cross over to trendline bounce. It took roughly the same amount of time to go from the peak to breaking the down trend line as it does from breaking the downtrend line to the actual bottom. History doesn't repeat, but it does rhyme. 
You *could* use another trend as basis for the bottom. Then it would be between $6700 and $6300 indeed.

But the price bounced off exactly at the 400 day EMA (green line). Seems to be a pretty strong foundation.

See, you should have divided by the daily temperature in Celcius. 
LOL me too! If BCH becomes dominant pair I might just quit crypto altogether
Sure, but there lies a pretty noteworthy correlation. A chart is nothing more than an indicator of collective human behavior, and human trends tend to repeat.
I haven't seen any big data on this, but a cursory glance on 1d charts over the last couple months shows only 1 somewhat red weekend which was the topout at 10k early this month, shrug. 
I'd say it's when you've racked up a significant amount of losses but still came out profitable. That's generally the sign of a good trader imo 

it indicates discipline, risk management, knowing when to be greedy and knowing when to cut small winners and losers quickly 

Most people here only know how to win big. they don't know how to win small or how to cut small losses early, but the latter is what cuts into most people's profits 
In the end the only thing that matters is profit. If you average a profit every month for a longer period then youre a competent trader
The point is that the weekend isn't causing it.
So is that the word of the day, "delusional?" pretty silly at this point. I'm up on every big buy I've made *this year*, forget all the ones from the distant past.
Right... the drop in April was a bit different... the short squeeze happened because everyone felt sure we were going to retest $6k and perhaps go lower... at the time I remember feeling similar.. but the long period of consolidation, slow uptrend and massive number of shorts was all a recipe for a reversal.

Right now I think a lot of people are waiting to buy at $7k with the expectation of at trend reversal within the pennant on the daily... which might happen... but the number of open longs along with the distance from ATH and waning public interest makes me concerned... if we break the continuation pattern and move below the pennant, I'm fairly sure we'll see lower lows.  We should know either way by mid\-June at the latest I would think. 
Exactly why we're not going places
I don't think people are expecting  $6k as much after this price movement though...


June futures are back to a small premium, Sept back to +$100, funding rates positive 

Everyone in this thread is calling for the bottom. everyone is buying  the dip but idk who is going to buy high 

I'm surprised everyone is already convinced this is the bottom before we've even rallied just a little bit  lmao
It doesn't feel anything like it. No one here seems panicked or worried and they're gobbling up dips but no one is gonna buy high. gonna do a poll here soon :P
Well yes it does, but you're right that it softens the landing 
Why would shorting not lower the price if it helps soften the landing? They either both influence the price or neither. 
idk maybe he read something? I don't really understand the point of his comment
different cultures, in many asian countries rumors hit the streets fast, there are no secrets.  Everyone has an cousin or uncle who works in the industry and word spreads fast.

Their family units are much larger so their trust networks are exponentially larger than ours.  Corruption and face-saving is also rampant, so much of their press may even be misinformation, so sometimes the 'word on the street' is more reliable than the media.

I think your view is skewed because you have not been in btc for long and see 20k or 10k as a reasonable price and not an anomoly 
This one has so far.
but...wouldn't you want the price to go down then? to flush these people out? because I'd wager 99% of people who bought above $2000 are in it for the money 
So you're just gonna worry forever about supposed stuff that doesn't impact your life directly in any kind of way. 
We haven't really been going sideways that much though haha 
Not really. 

Just because the market went up quickly in one direction doesn't mean it has to drop quickly in the other. 
Thanks you too!

Don't get why you go with two positions.
I'm still seeing a lower and lower high each day...
Pretty meaningless unless buyers make a new local high above $7,650. 
Too risky, I never let an automated system dictate my entries.

>The decentralised nature is great but most people (and understandably so) just don't care.

The term "decentralised" is absolutely meaningless to most people, as you allude to.  It's just a buzzword people in the market throw around.  I think the most convincing arguments frame cryptocurrencies as a way to escape banks and other financial institutions.  The perception of banks in America is extremely low (look at how successful The Big Short was, or how big Occupy Wall Street became, to give examples), and I think financial corruption is an issue most liberals and conservatives can find common ground on.   
When I was a child, my parents took me by a car lot to look at new vehicles.  My dad was in the market for a new car.  I remember a truck on the showroom floor being fully loaded, painted teal, and it had a nice tall chrome roll bar.  It was beautiful.  It was listed for 15k, which my parents called absurd.  Today, that same truck would sell for closer to 60k.  Over a period of 30 years, there has been a 4x increase in cost of things like homes and cars.  This change iin price is highly correlated to the intentional devaluation of US dollars.  To me, it's a terrible thing.  It makes it very difficult to save value.

Gold was used as a currency long before fiat was invented.  And even today, people still buy it as an investment.  Gold has no central controlling authority, much like crypto.  It's total circulating value is estimated at 9 Trillion.  Bitcoin is currently at 128B market cap with all of crypto at 335B.  This is still a fraction of the precious metal markets and fiat markets.  Going back 2 years, these numbers were substantially lower.  At what level does it make sense that their growth will plateau?  Now?  Or 10x from now?  Why would you hold an asset that was designed to lose value when you could hold an asset that was designed to keep value and was price much much lower than similar products on the market?  

Bitcoin still has challenges with fees and transaction times.  But, there are options that improve those current problems and constant (though slow) progress is being made.  I'm going to continue to accumulate and hold for the next few years with the belief that the underlying fundamentals of Bitcoin will bring it's market cap to a competitive level of any of the top 10 banks in the world in terms of total value held.  To me, we should easily reach the 2T market cap ballpark as all of the top 10 banks world wide hold more than that in assets of their customers.
Average Joe will never buy Bitcoin, I don't want them to. But they will, (probably unbeknownst to them), use it.

Edit: think store of value/gold, and the big picture becomes more clear.
Also, every time you pay for something with cash, you aren't required to keep extensive recordkeeping and calculations to add more complexity to your tax return.  With BTC, you do.
Why do you think Bitcoin needs mass adoption as a currency to survive? I don't think that will ever happen.

BTC is already fully auditable, digital gold. It works perfectly for that use case. Every change \(LN, MAST, Schnorr sigs, etc\) is just a bonus that potentially enables other use cases, but IMO the digital gold one is by far the most valuable.

So while I have no idea if this store of value narrative will catch on \(seems to be going in the right direction, but no one can predict the future\), I don't think BTC has anything left to prove. We just have to wait for this experiment to play out because "value" is group think. It's not up to us and I don't think the technology really matters that much.
I agree with you to some extent. But future is global and having a global currency that no single entity can manipulate is incredibly useful. Also, BTC can be used for things other than a currency, like a store of wealth. You can argue that all the volatility makes it impossible to be a store of wealth but I would argue that the market is still extremely immature. Eventually, whether it is at 1k or 100k, the price of BTC will stabilize and it will become useful to store wealth in it. But the main point to realize is that the amount of cash that we want to store in it is limited to the amount of BTC. If, in aggregate, everyone across the world wanted to store a trillion dollars in it (which isn't outrageous if you consider a billion people each wanting to store an average of 1,000 dollars in it) than BTC has to be a minimum of $47,000. 

But anyone can just throw random numbers out and get random numbers back. The point I'm making is that I think the probability you are giving for bitcoin to "succeed" is too low. The entire idea of the blockchain is revolutionary from an economic perspective, just like when people discovered gold was a way to store wealth. 
Average Joe in the U.S. may not care (right now), but Average Andreas in Greece or Average Jose in Venezuela sure as hell care about bitcoin and the need to exit their broken financial systems and preserve what little wealth they have left in the face of economic upheaval and runaway inflation.
Where exactly is it illegal to use Bitcoin as a currency?
It can be successful as an alternative to fiat. The government will always find a way to tax sufficiently. 
I should say, I base my views not on the price but on what I think of the technology and how realistic I think it is that it'll see mass adoption. 

BTC could hit $100k tomorrow and my views wouldn't change at this point. 
It won't die, but can see it dropping down to the low hundreds of $s and just flatlining there. You would still have a dedicated fanbase of Bitcoin cultists who used it and traded it amongst themselves.
Exactly! 7.5 wasn't the dip, below 7450 was the dip, so everybody bought below 7450, nobody wanted 7.5...
That's 4% at current price levels. That's not exactly as noisy a range as you'd think.
Here's the breakdown I'd argue:

Breakeven: 50% 

2% loss: 40%

10%+ gain: 10% 

I'm positioning myself for the potential 10%+ gain here if the market chooses to forego continued consolidation and just plunges straight down through $7,000. 

I don't think it's an especially likely outcome, but it's worth the potential for a small loss or an exit at breakeven to be in a strong position for a larger downside move.
If we break down our support line and it flips to resistance, we'll likely retest our long-term log support at 6900ish: https://www.tradingview.com/x/lPHY2QK2/

Sounds like lots of upside to me.
Well, in that case the market is about 7% away from the bottom. So I'd argue I'm not shorting the bottom of the pennant.
I suppose it's possible that buyers could plow through 1 resistance line and get smacked down by another, but I find that hard to believe. 

My guess is that if they make it through one, they'll make it through all of them. They're certainly a bit frenzied lately.
Lol, you don't need a bot, he makes like one trade every 6 months :-P

$9650 on swaps - from the first time around!

I had a $10075 June short but got shaken out
>Fees on BFX are not cheap for scalping. It's 0.4% taker or 0.2% maker that goes down as you trade volume.

Yep, that's fairly average. Most exchanges charge in the 0.2-0.5% range. Spot exchanges generally charge much more than futures derivatives. 
That's ludicrous. 
funding on swaps costs way more than one market order, if you are on the wrong side of funding for more than a couple funding periods in a good dip or pump
You can short on exchanges such as Bitfinex and BitMex.  Bitfinex is not recommended, because they have a shady history.
I've never heard of win rate being a metric people used. Overall success is determined by how much money you have at the end vs when yous started, and preferably over large sample size of many, many trades over a number of years and market conditions.
I hope you collected maker rebates on both ends.
% positive/negative should definitely **NOT** be the only metric. Here's what I look at (personally):

https://imgur.com/a/IWPnPYi (ETHBTC pair for reference)
Who uses win rate as a measure?

Definitely no one I know, nor it seems the vast majority of people here 
That's not the reason. It's not that miners don't expect a good price for BTC at all.( I'm a miner btw)

The reason for low ASCI prices right now is it's old chips that will soon be useless and out of date.  Difficulty is high for current hardware and  new 10mm and 7mm chips are starting to hit the market so suppliers are dumping the old hardware before the new gigs hit the street.
"To increase hash rate we're talking about millions of dollars of investment, that's not something you don't 'bother' with."

Erm, or you're talking about many thousand of people buying in smaller quantities, which did indeed happen.
Yeah, if I understand correctly, it's based on divergence between the mark price (their time decayed fair price), spot price (the average of bitstamp & gdax), and the "impact" price from their current asks/bids (their swap price).

https://www.bitmex.com/app/perpetualContractsGuide#Funding-Rate-Calculations

Edit: but they do say elsewhere that the funding rate is a decent lagging indicator for sentiment of the bitmex users, and that you can develop a strategy of counter trading it if you can get the good timing for the flips.

Enjoy the time off. This is a dangerous weekend to trade. Low volume, relentless buyers, very little support, plus a holiday in the US so even lower volume than usual.

Probably the best call!
Yeah but that last bounce from 6.8K was mostly just a short squeeze, I think. It gave bulls some hopium and momentum to break the log downtrend line, which provided more hopium. But the steam keeps running out after each of these pushes and I don't see why a turn around is in the cards right now. 

The behavior of alts just re-affirms my belief that the markets are still deluded right now and it would be obnoxiously irrational for a bull run to start again at this point, given how retarded investors are in this space right now. 

I'm also hoping for the same push down and consolidation. This would likely boost BTC dominance, which is a silver lining for maximalists like myself. It's healthy in the long run and maybe investors will wise up to the pump and dump schemes that have perverted the ecosystem. I'll be more confident that the bottom is near when alts like Tron aren't pumping every other week.  
Maybe your sleep correspond with Bitcoin volatility. Good shit, bro. Keep it up!
MA don't tell you whether the market is bearish or bullish, they just provide context for the price action relative to the trend of that period over time. Just like trend lines do, except it could be argued that MA provide a lot more insight. They also serve as support and resistance because they're benchmarks that provide context to the current price level. The price hugs and tests these lines because they represent longer term price discovery than just the current set of candles. 
Makes sense, but bitcoin has a history of trending very hard for a year or two and then turning around and retracing most of it. The weekly MA could give us insight into the next year or so of movement.

I'd say it's good for people looking for a longer term entry. Anything above the weekly is probably useless as bitcoin hasn't even existed long enough to have a meaningful indicator there. The monthly would probably just be like "buy all the coins NOOOWW!!"

Anyway I do believe 50 and 200ma for the 1d and 1w are fairly common indicators in conventional markets- even amongst those who don't use TA. a cross down on the weekly 50ma is not bullish at all for those looking to enter. Staying under it for a while and being patient might yield a much better entry 
Dead kitten bounce :(
They're just resting...
I was in the same boat as you since yesterday. More leverage than I should have put on it so it was quite a ride and relief to just exit at break even. Nice to be able to walk away from my PC for a bit.


My biggest problem (that screwed with my plan) was that while BTC rose 1.5% above my entry, ETH rose 5% for a similar entry level.
I endured that but when it came down to profit i set stops, but even being quite far still got hit at around -3% (with 50% stack and 5X). 

My luck was being stubborn and re-entering the short again a bit higher and spent a few more hours butt clenching. Luckily it dropped almost enough, still ate some losses but compared to being 5% in the red, feels like a draw at least.

Lesson learned, entering positions in ETH must be only i i can babysit the position and enter and leave as fast as possible, only quick scalps. Otherwise a pump or dump might come and really destroy my stack.
but the bbands on higher time frames aren't tight. Wait are you agreeing with me then? Cause sideways in this range would tighten higher TF bbands
I think he meant he has a sixth sense. 
We get that you aren't convinced.  But the market is.
I am not saying the trend will reverse. Not on a macro scale. I gave reasons below. I don't think there is a rule to give the same reasons with every comment. If you don't want to scroll down that's your problem not mine.


> the BB on the hourly is turning downwards and the 3H is cooled off and could be primed for a dump in the near future

BBs turning down after they compressed and broke out downwards is the norm. Nothing incredibly.bearish about that. We had that leg down this morning already. Not using 3H a lot but 4H. I hope they are not too different but 4H is @34 right now. I wouldn't call that cooled off a lot. 12h is even worse.

> Were also vandering nicely below the 1h cloud, and seemed to have bounced off the middle of the 1h BB




I never used the cloud so apologies here.

> And not to forget that bear pennant that is forming. The volume is awfully low and that makes it hard to trust any pump or dump atm imo

I consider it to be a flag instead of a pennant atm. We're talking about the 4h here right? We have plenty of upside left to reach the top of the flag. Volume on the dump was pathetic and we marked a higher low. Sellers are exhausted when you look at medium timeframes. With the downtrend line rapidly closing in it's just a matter of time. 

We also have a HVN down @7250. That will make passing through harder, especially on this volume.








You see, that's not TA for the short term, that's you talking about fundamentals. There was plenty of price exploration in those areas. We explored the 4k range two months. 5k-5.5k is the only area that hasn't been explored a lot. 

Bubble this bubble that. It's about exploiting movements. Your trading style is okay too if you want to keep a short from the top open until we retrace all the way down. I trade differently. 

I don't really care about news. Trade market conditions and not news.
Yea, he hasn't been fucked over that bad yet. Which I feel like isn't a particularly good sign. He invested a pretty small amount though, so he'll be okay. 
It *could* but I'd say most alt gains like that are over. They're in for a reckoning now. I'm starting to short alts now. I think the money will begin to torrent out of them

I guess I can move there then and as long as I do not have local sourced income, my stock tradings, dividends etc are tax free
True. I was hoping for another small step down to confirm the divergence over a longer time frame.

bulls be like: descending wedge

okay actually last time I started shitposting about people longing/shorting we got the BGD...maybe I need to be careful lol
I'm in a long and it's currently riding the support line from where I'll cut. Basically now if it breaks 7350.
Yea I didn't mean to get anyone to pile up on him. It could definitely be profitable. 
I am imagining this comment in mid 2014.


>This, is delusion. We haven't been anywhere to close to 200 in 7 months, yet bulls are delusional calling for 600?
No it does not at all remind me of 2014 and the comparisons bug me. I pretty much caught the knife and didn't go back into the green until 3 years later. I can't remember exactly when but I stopped checking prices daily once we went below $250 or so since I assumed it was going to zero but didn't want to sell to somebody so cheap in the event it mooned. 

Sentiment wise, it was pretty bad. Reddit was my only source of information about bitcoin and it's developments and the subs were mainly filled with super techy stuff and stories from people who made some seriously bad investment choices. I believe the suicide hotline was stickied up top for some time. 

Edit: context 

Yes and no I would say. 2014 was tough and similar at the same time, because people thought the price could not get back higher that quickly. There was more (long term) doubt back then and a lot of people thought we would never go above 1k again. Just think about that a minute: why would we not go over 20k again, ever? I think we will see prices over that in the future, but let’s see. It sounded far away back then, and a new ATH could come pretty quickly again.

But who knows. I think supply/demand ratio will quickly outpace TA/traders, when enough people have skin in the game.
My full chart is here

https://www.tradingview.com/x/lfgAixfO/

Its extremely messy and is full of possible outcomes, I am leaning into the ending triangle of a large WXY correction more now. What happens when we hit the 7k area will be the tell. 

1. If we bounce 7.1k then the triangle is not as likely and we are on the blue number count.
2. If we bounce 6.9, triangle situation confirmed
3. If we break bottom of triangle the cost of scuba gear increases greatly
Not necessarily. Can easily be drawn as a flag too. Try drawing an ascending channel. You get two parallel lines. 

Not convinced they will break down though. But if they do ya pretty scary target.
So the target for a break down would be 6k?
haha wow, thats really something.
Considering I've just been getting chopped up since closing my initial 8.2 short I think you made the right call. 
You need to compare market cap instead of an arbitrary unit price. Currently 1/100M of ETH total supply is ~600 USD while the same share of EOS is ~110 USD.

i bought ETH the first day on kraken. several 1000s. I sold for a 30% loss some months later

I hate you now :( for bringing this up
Bingo... Also when has Dan Larimer ever finished a project... He's a snake oil salesman
It's just a placeholder ErC20 token, not actual EOS tokens.

EOS does not have a block chain yet.
And that is the relevant one, imo.
Ok, yes makes sense and I have that one drawn as well.  

Now I see why the price dropped so hard after it broke $8100 or so. I'm an idiot for not watching that and being in Log scale, but the way it goes sometimes.
Is there ever a time linear is better then? 
Sounds like log can be applied to short time frames but not vice versa
I tried that, but the numbers seemed off. Will try farienheit.
I could be remembering wrong but I remember being surprised that someone tracked it and found it to be true. cause I used to think how you did and thought it was bullshit. But could be my bad memory 

It wasn't anything super significant, just like a 5-10% more chance of being red or smth 
By winning small, do you mean being able to trade more frequently than swing traders?
This may be shocking, but's not always about you.  We weren't talking about you.
Yea, pretty much exactly this. There is no real fear here in going long/buying here like there was back then, seems like the general sentiment is that it's free money. This type of thinking would make sense if we were mid 2017 and public interest was increasing exponentially week over week, but it's decreasing. 

And yes, I agree with the moving below the pennant meaning we'll see lower lows as well
Nah man.. just putting the wagon before the horse. Standard Bitcoin markets procedure.
I mean it feels like I'm about to get shafted on my short profits... But the leverage situation is wildly different.
I guess the way to think about it is if you have 1 btc bought at 5K and it goes to 10K and you provide liquidity on the way up but people start market selling it down to 5K afterwards once your short has been filled did you really have an impact on the price. 10K was the max level people were willing to pay anyway, they dont realize profits, you probably just gave a fomo buyer a better price than if you didnt have that sell in the books because you provided some liquidity which will make them less likely to sell on the way down. I mean it's either that or your short is rocket fuel
I mean if your talking about massive short selling of whale then maybe but that tactic is so dangerous in bitcoin. Shorting itself provides a reality check on the market and helps prevent overshooting in the one direction (well sometimes) and people shorting really have minimal impact on the price from what I have read

https://www.investopedia.com/university/shortselling/shortselling4.asp

It's just part of the price discovery. The type of short selling your talking about would be extremely risky.

posted new comment!
I love 4chan too but let’s keep this place excellent 
Good on you for holding through it! I'd personally keep holding onto it, but please don't listen to a random guy on the internet.
haha
Talking to the wrong person bro ...
You're not paying attention to volume and time.
You guys should focus more on time and volume, not price.
I came for the money but stayed for the tech...
I'm not. I'm aware of my insignificance in a world of explicit and implicit dictatorships. What I'm not going to do is allow myself to be lulled by naive (albeit lofty and theoretically inspiring) concepts of democratic processes, liberties, freedoms, etc. Just because I'm incapable of changing my surroundings, does not mean that I have to see or accept them for what they are not. 
lol perhaps part of me is biased. But I am seriously prepared for any side, I just want to get over with it haha.
But with a BGD price movement, surely there's been no opportunity for support to form within the candle range? Perhaps fib supports?
Self-awareness, basically. In general I don't, but I have been since the initial drop from 8400. My most common flaw in trading is position management. I generally open 3x-5x, but I add when a position moves in my favor. This drags my cost average around and muddies my entry/exit targets. Scaling into positions makes sense at low leverage (3x or lower), but it's harder the higher you go. 

I wanted to take advantage of the volatility we were seeing in the movement down from 8400 above and beyond my initial position (which was 10x @ 8310 by the time 8100 broke), but I didn't want to compromise that entry. I could open short on swaps and cut it quickly if we bounced, all without complicating my futures position. I did the following:

20x short from (roughly--from memory):  
8100-7910 W  
7930-7830 W  
7810-7900 L  
7630-7400 W  

My current entry has been a nightmare, but it's back in the green as of this post. Barely. 

Basically, I had to exit the crypto scene in March. I left a little bit to try to build new holdings. I'm trying to balance risk vs return. Generally I err on the side of lower risk and lower return, but I was aggressive this week and it's paid off. I'll be happy to exit this position--hopefully in the green--and reevaluate. No intentions to close the futures short. 
Why would someone in Greece care? They still use the Euro. The only concern is if Greece switches to its own currency, but those who care will just stick to the euro as a store of wealth if that's their endgame. 

Venezuela, I'll ask some Venezuelans and get back to you, but my understanding is that they prefer the US dollar.
China, India, Bolivia, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Vietnam, Iran, Macedonia, Zimbabwe, etc. 

China and India are about 3 billion people between them.

It is already successful as an alternative to fiat for those who few (including me) who find a use for it.  But it's not going to replace fiat currency.
Idiot spotted. 
L14dy said 7.5 was the fair value of BTC. No one wants to pay fair value these days.
And how many folks loading up between 739x and 7500 will sell the dip to sub 7350, if we get there?
Well, yeah, i was looking at it as +-2% and bumping up and down without decision, but mainly had in mind behaviour of the market, not the range itself, again it feels odd.
Makes sense... But... Buyers tend to force open the doors and walk away with nothing lately,I can see it faking out first resistance to bounce from next and drop back.
Never mind, thought you had sent a PM to me. :)

Yes, profit closes just a part and calculates the PnL of that action. You can check all the movements of a position in the history page, clicking on the pair column.
test
 backwards slashes...aaaand you're fucking with me lol 
Someone’s copying me!

Hahah just kidding. You do you.
Longs gotta close too. It's all about which ones are doing the market order part.
Yep... Then you have the lending fees on top which is determined by the lending market. It gets expensive to enter and exit positions all the time for tiny losses like you can do on bitmex.
Win rate is more commonly used on sports betting, assuming bets of equal units.
You'd be surprised how many people fail to grasp that concept.
I did when I opened, but not when I closed. The whole thing was pretty much a wash.
You do actually. You're constantly harping on how I'm wrong more often than not (which isn't true by the way).


I think we may be arguing the same side.

I'm saying ASIC prices are not low in any meaningful way to derive that miner expectations have decreased because equipment is still selling at cost plus premium based on the expectations of prices today and moving forward. 

And a side note: not all miners are holding. The ones without really deep pockets are selling to keep the facilities running and upgrading equipment. 

 This can be confirmed by looking at the md&a of publicly listed miners.  They rarely keep more than 50% of their mined coins, but that's still a lot. 

And all those thousands of people just bothered not to sell them even though they're expecting a loss? 
ETH is down quite a bit. Dash is really down. Ripple dropped 80% from its ATH. 
I can't find a ssss chart :/ insider infomation must be why sloppy makes great calls he's hodling out on us.
Bitcoin would have to trade bearish for several years straight before the 50 month MA even started to come in the picture. It's always been *way* below the price. 

edit: actually I take that back. It's not useless, it's just useless to wait for trades based on bounces or crosses. It's still useful to look at in terms of the distance from the price. I'm sure you could easily offset it upwards and make it somewhat useful. 
I have a 50% profit taking order down below 7400 and the rest just above 7300. If we crack 7400, I'll be setting stops at 7450 (profit--barely)
Shorting/longing ratios scares the poo out of me. I shorted ETH for the first time ever from around 0.085 and closed at 0.081. I felt way out of my element and that I was lucky to have a win. Coincidentally, closing that position was where I got most of the margin for this short haha
Exact same thing happened to me this past time, though I didn't re-enter, just rode it underwater and closed at a small loss while my BTC was at a small profit for break even, except for fees. ETH ratio plays are super lucrative but as you said, must be babysat, at least at first. Still think they're great swing trade plays but you have to watch the entry like a hawk
Yeah, mostly sideways in the range.
Where are all the shorts then? Why aren't we still rapidly falling ?
> he hasn't been fucked over that bad yet. Which I feel like isn't a particularly good sign

Many have been, though, so I would hope that accounts for something. :)
I was joking 
see you there. 
Note that to avoid CGT on BTC sales, you need to be there for 5 years before you can do it for UK residents or 4 years for Irish.
Shit, didn't see that coming
good eye!!
I'm actually weighing up whether to buy coin as a hedge for my short.

Am a bit upset I didn't already do it at 7300
There's actually a post calling for the bottom being $200 in mid 2014 and lots of people chided him for it. Even some really smart people.

It was on the last day they hit $495+ for like 11 months 
So only reason it does not remind you of 2014 is because it took another two years to get back higher? How would you know this won’t happen again.

It’s all a matter of time, according to me. I was not in a rush to sell 5 years ago, and won’t be today. 

Patience is the name of the game. If you’re not patient, then trade. But you might just sell the bottom, and/or buy the top. Or the opposite, which we all think we can do!
true, more time is needed to see if it's one or the other. Will keep that in mind
6.5k but there is (supposed to be) strong support a 6.9
I am aware that there are 10x the amount of EOS. I’m still saying that comparing 2015 to now is simply not sensible
my bad bro ;)
Wrong.  It is EOS.  It says it on Coinmarketcap.com.  The digital token has been been trading for quite awhile.  A Erc20 token that is called "EOS" is an EOS token.
No I mean offsetting small losses with small wins. it's a good part of a strong risk management system. 

In general though a good trader will have a 30-60% win rate and be profitable from that. above fifty is generally very rare
If we break down from the pennant I'll likely open a large short position and just keep in open for 3\-6 months as I don't believe it'll resolve fully until we retrace to the historic log line \(or until weekly RSI hits 30\). 

In my view, buyer's last stand is the $7k range... daily RSI will be near 30 at this point and the line should provide some good support for a few days, and so bulls have some hope here still... but currently I'm slightly leaning towards a breakdown. 
idk I think the anticipation of the BGD means it'll never happen lol, it happens because it takes people by surprise
The point I'm trying to make is that you are logically inconsistent. The link has nothing to do with it. 
I just held because i was 50/50 on eth and btc. The pump was too steep to hold and chewy had faith on a drop of btc that would at least bring it down a bit.
If this happened last week while we were above 8000 the result might have been another. Let's see how this goes. This time i might put a stop around 595 just in case... 
You keep repeating this like like a parrot.

However, you don't seem to be paying attention to the reality of the situation. 
You say that but you get happy when the price is up and triggered when its down, if you really didnt care about the price you wouldn't care if we were at $200, your doing what they call projecting but it's all good man, cheers to Bitcoin, we'll get there.
I see, you are of the superior, enlightened kind. Those who find guilty parties to everything in humankind.
Right, I rarely add on Mex. Finex let's you drop part of the position and instead of realizing gains it moves your entry point. Mex just pays out.

I've learned that entry points don't really matter. Your total balance and possibility to exit in profit counts. Opening two in one direction is basically the same as adding and profiting from one. In the end balance will be the same either way.
Are you joking?

In Greece they shut the banks down for a week in 2015. Good luck using the euro when that happens!

And in Venezuela, dollars are not easily accessible, whereas bitcoin mining/investment is through the roof.
I was in Greece when the crisis hit everyone by surprise and what the government did was even worse. Everybody and I mean everyone was fucked beyond fucked.

Imagine you have 50k in savings but the government imposes a state of emergency and limits withdrawals from your bank account to 40 euro a week (don’t remember the exact number, but I’m close). Now your also forced to spend a x amount per week to keep the economy running and every thing you buy requires you to hold the receipt for taxes, even a goddamn chewing gum of 25 cents, people were asking if they could have my receipts so they could hoard their own money. I’m not making this shit up and it was during the summer and the lines at the ATM were as long as the original Iphone launch line, damn some people died in line due to the hot weather (seriously not making this up)

While this is also happening the government is on the brink of bankruptcy together with the banks, meaning you could lose your entire life savings, because the government and banks fucked up big time (also the corrupt bastards that also stole money outside the government and banks). 

Now you tell me being your own bank is not a bad thing and how many average Gianni’s would embrace crypto?

From the article you linked

China: legal. Financial institutions are restricted

India:Legal / Banking ban. Illegal for criminal uses

Zimbabwe: legal
You are probably right. Just saying they are not mutually exclusive and that greater adoption, in 3 years or so, could be a big deal. 
How about, rather than calling them an idiot, explaining why you think they're wrong?
Last time we found fair value it was at 9k, you know what happened next? We dumped.
I still think breaking 7.2 convincingly will hit a lot of sl, 7.3 is roughly be for latest longs.
It's definitely a bit of an odd spot to stop for this long, I'd agree. 
It's the Big Green Candle effect (TM). 

Step 1: Buy like mad

Step 2: Stop buying

Step 3: If rest of market keeps going, profit

Step 4: If rest of market stops with you, flee!

Its been 3 days since you last posted. All okay there, Chew?
Dash and Ripple should be worth basically zilch. I can't really speak to Ether's long term viability or value but 99% of alts are completely worthless. These projects should not be valued in the billions or tens of billions, they should have tiny market caps or no market caps at all. For the vast majority of these coins, people are only investing so that they can sell higher. They're not actually interested in the technology because the technology isn't all that special. It's a bubble and a ponzi scheme. I have no faith in bulls until money starts re-consolidating in Bitcoin, Litecoin, Monero and maybe Ether. The rest of these shitcoins need to shit the bed and the market needs to learn the reasons why a cryptocurrency might be valuable, not just assume that every coin under the sun is the next big thing.
I didn't even short the ratio, i shorted ETHUSD directly. If it was the ratio i would be safer because they never move in different directions, the most is one going faster than the other.

Yesterday i was lucky and scalped a long on ETH just before the small pump, but only made enough to cover my other scalping attempts...

I need to stop over trading and trying to catch every move up and down

I tried doing that yesterday since i caught almost the bottom, but got stopped 2 times with a 1% stop loss before catching a 3% move my way. With fees i just broke even, so the only one winning was the exchange.

And this using limit buys/sells to have lower fees, until last week i usually entered with market buys/sells and that added a bit more to the fees.
so, sideways for a couple weeks then tight bbands and then $1k+ drop?
The shorts are on the exchanges.  You cannot short unless you have an account on an exchange.

And we aren't still rapidly falling, because of the current market dynamics, right this second.
You can really never tell. I usually see rational stuff out of you so I was a little confused but the alt space is really delusional so it's hard to tell sometimes lmao
whats CGT?
It's funny how some people are so stuck to their biases that they refuse to listen to others even if they have a good point.
Idk man, this actually mirrors 2014 very similar to me. Different price action, higher price tag but market participants are behaving exactly the same, trying to paint a bullish picture on a clear bubble pop, same exact stories with Institutional money and Chinese New Year.

No that is not what I am saying. I can write a long article on the differences but there are little to almost no similiarities on the FA side. I'm sure you can google it and find out the main differences. I think the only similarity is the TA side but all bubble charts can be adjusted to overlap if you play around with the time span
we could have been on a yacht pumping shitcoins on binance instead if i just have HODLed lol
Are you just trolling or what? There is no EOS blockchain. It's not due to launch until June.

The tokens currently in circulation have no value. They will be swapped for actual EOS tokens once EOS is actually live.
I'm not trading on it I'm holding my short. I think it's PTSD from days of slow grinding down holding my short last time only for profits to be eaten in about 10 minutes when your not paying attention. Your right I don't expect it, in fact my analysis is extremely bearish the 4-6-12 hour look like they have room to move up but not by much, but I kind of got that feeling in the pit of my stomach that I should close all but my primary hedge position here.
Fair enough I guess what I'm trying to say is that short sellers are either rocket fuel or a softer landing. It's a win win and shouldn't really have a net negative impact on the price. It's not like it was shorted from 20K to 7.5K
Ah, you're still holding it? The support in the $540s is pretty weak, I'd be surprised if it held. Like I said, I'd be shorting it too but I don't know which will drop further/faster. Mid\-low $400s is my guess.
Hmm, I love new bear meat ...
You think too much of me. If anything, I'm just someone who goes by the adage: "in the land of the blind, the one eyed man is king."
> Opening two in one direction is basically the same as adding and profiting from one. In the end balance will be the same either way.

Precisely. The only reason I did it this way was to not obfuscate my entry point, because I know I'm really bad at doing that. haha

This so much.  In particular, that's why I'm a fan of privacy coins.  I think that gets the closest to real world needs on the shorter term.
> China: legal. Financial institutions are restricted

Dude, it's been illegal to use Bitcoin as a currency in China since 2014.  You are hopelessly lost.

And you are wrong about Iran and Zimbabwe as well...so is the article, apparently.
Definition of insanity
Sorry, I thought it was obvious. His posts are obviously noobish which doesn't warrant calling out, but when they started going idiotic I thought I should sound the alarm. 
*dusts off crystal ball*

Swaps wick to 6905. Futures wick to 6820. Then technical bounce off the long-term log support line off 6920ish up to test 7250 as resistance?
Agreed, there's no FOMO bull run effect, after initial push people are afraid to buy more when price goes too much up.
Would have to record each funding period and make sure all the position dates are synced so i could calculate that when the position closes.
Going in the ToDo list so i can analyze it.
Deleting a position will completely delete it.
You can use the update command and change any thing but the opening value. Of course, if you messed up an profit command that can't be deleted yet. I guess i could create a random id for each action so you can then PM a command to delete just that action.

After that you would have to send an update command to correct the average value, stack % and leverage.
True. Just saying that short TF scalping on BFX is not really possible unless your hell of a scalper or do enough volume to bring the fees down. It's just annoying on BFX because a break even trade could cost you almost 0.8% but I agree they have the best trading platform I've used. I use it for longer term trades. I keep a little money on Mex cus leverage is hell of a drug
Ha, thanks for checking in. I'm fine.
Ripple is being backed by Sainsbury’s so it should have some value. 
> I need to stop over trading and trying to catch every move up and down

Wise words.

Also, BTC just needs to get its shit together and break 7400. What the actual hell. 
Nobody knows. Down is anybody's best guess. Not enough buyers able to keep the price propped up. RSIs are all very hot. Maybe we do see 8k+ again but I don't believe it would be sustainable.
I did really buy Waves though. It was my first real shitcoin lol.

His reasoning may have been sketchy but the outright dismissal of his claims reminds me of the dismissal of people suggesting we go anywhere below $5-6k
I have friends who pumped shitcoins. Got investor capital and just wrote bots that would buy some garbage in regular intervals. Bought into Telegram and slack channels and pumped fake news out the ass.

I wouldnt touch that with a ten foot pole

But I agree with you
As a reminder to everyone, the EOS mainnet blockchain will be launched in one week from today. 
For now still holding both shorts. The dump is being run on Btc so i don't put much trust in eth's support levels. If btc can't break 7200 and starts making higher lows i'm closing and re-evaluate. This dump was also too steep to trust. 
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 
Then link a source that doesn't say the opposite thing you are
There are luxury stores \(supercars, yachts etc\) in China with actual pricetags in Bitcoin, but yeah.

edit: from your comment history:

> I've noticed on the internet that the surest way to make a dumb person angry is speak very logically and factually to them. It just makes them frustrated and furious. 

That's pretty damn ironic, I gotta say. 
Need to save this and check in a week ;-)
this should help:

https://www.bitmex.com/app/fundingHistory

but since funding rates are calculated based on position size and paid out based on the current value of btc it gets tricky. i tried using the cumulative funding rate and calculating it that way but it's a bit off since my position opened at $9650 but price is $7341 now
How do I delete a position? Sorry for basic questions
Bitfinex's lending rate for BTC is <0.01% per day--doesn't seem prohibitively expensive?
Comments on this possible reversal? 
Source?

Also, I'm talking about intrinsic properties that provide value, like decentralization, immutability and censorship resistance, not endorsements from companies or public figures, which are nothing more than publicity stunts. 
The problem is that at least looking at the Ichimoku Clouds, ETH still has some support bellow and is slowing BTC down.
LOL 

when he told me about it he straight up read the entire websites front-page. I was like...why. He isn't even a software guy so he didn't understand any of it. I was kind of shocked at how impressed he was by something he didn't even get at all 
if you have several 100 BTC to play with it's basically like playing starcraft so why not
You are going off on a tangent.  I never said anything about a blockchain.  You are arguing with voices in your head..seek help.
Google it if you want the truth....although I doubt you do.


RemindMe! One Week
The current value of BTC is easy to get, what i don't have is the position size. Since my PnL is calculated in percentage, wouldn't it suffice to cumulative add the funding  percentages and add it to the PnL calculated by the site?
!help
The help is incomplete, must fix that.

But it's just ! short xbtusd delete for example
It can get expensive though cant find historic data but it does get significantly higher (especially to short since BTC is inherently scarce and owned by a bunch of people that have been scammed countless times before). It's not expensive at the moment to hold a position. It can get expensive to enter and exit positions all the time though if you set it at break-even because you need to 0.4-0.8% to cover the fees.
I'll believe it when I see it. 

The market has quite a ways to go yet. 
BTC is riding a support/resistance/support line as well:  https://www.tradingview.com/x/djce8h3l/
I have my long-term holds and I have my shitcoin stack ready to dump on dumb money when they comeback, I think people underestimated how much of this is built on speculqtion, hype and emotion.   I realized on the last run, dumb money likes the cheapest of cheap in the top 20 to 30, ripple, stellar and cardano will go nuts on the next alt dumb run nd I'm ready and loaded up when they bottomed..   I hate those coins with a passion cuz I really originally got in for the tech back in the day, but I came around to making some money off them at the same time and they will pump again trust me, as much as I cringe saying that. 
Sounds a lot like myself, I only started getting really interested in crypto in October but I had bought 60 USD worth of BTC in dec 2015 to buy stuff online which failed so that became my starting capital. 

I used to look for coins and read the website and the white paper. Never really understood any of it and after a while I realized that you can just take any coin because they all go up and down together. I did get really lucky on some. Had a lot of Cardano and Lumens before they mooned. I also got in on Kucoin before that blew up. Those were the absolute shitcoins. Flixxo, Publica, DeepBrainChain, DragonChain, Bount0x, KucoinShares etc. They all went 5x-20x in 3 weeks. Those were the times. Took most of my gains and sold all my coins, including most of my BTC and now the only thing I do is buy/sell some alts (XLM, AMB, BAT & OMG) every monthly cycle and trade on Bitmex and short the fiat shitcoins against the dollar. 
I'm not... Arguing??? Maybe you need to seek help? I literally just said a reminder that EOS Blockchain is launching soon......

You think this was 'close enough' to say that we tested the downtrend from ATH? Didn't bounce from it, but we were like $80 from it on stamp and we bounced exactly off the line drawn from 5.8 bottom to 6.5 bottom.
Yeah, seems so. But 7400 is just being hard to break. lets see what happens now
Yea, I'm sad I stayed out of alts during the January run. That shit was just insane. Free money abound
I'd definitely classify it as "close enough." 

I'll be watching $7,800+ for a more definitive signal that the market is likely reversing course again.
Horizontal from bgd?

10k ath is at 7.5k, top of triangle at 9.4k.
