[Daily Discussion] Wednesday, April 11, 2018 -- TITLE
#New post: [\[Daily Discussion\] Thursday, April 12, 2018 →](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8bnetl/daily_discussion_thursday_april_12_2018/)
I just want to say thank you  to everyone who participates in this sub. Considering a lot of people have families, full time jobs, etc, a lot of people take  precious time out of their day to help others and put their 2 cents into people’s analysis and general opinions. 

I’ve grown a huge liking to this sub over the past month. Everyone is generally positive no matter the conditions of the market and everyone always has a good head on their shoulders. Even though sometimes we can all get off topic,  a little comic relief is often needed in times of despair and sideways movement.

Talking to your family, friends, co workers or the average Joe at the supermarket about BTC trading isn’t an easy topic. You often get responses like “ Oh that’s cool” or “ Seems fun “. But at least you can come here and speak your mind about how you’re feeling in today’s market with people who are like minded and all want to achieve the same thing. 

All in all, I look forward to reading this sub everyday and thanks to everyone who has helped me along the way. 
I just typed 'shorting' in to Google (incognito) and 'Shorting Bitcoin' was the number 2 suggested result.

What could go wrong.
And we're back! thanks /u/jarederaj and /u/skywalk819 for getting admin help. :)

This calm before the storm is quite intense. Whatever way we break it will be quite dramatic.
no mods?!  who will delete my low effort comments?
Just to note, that huge buy was a short closing.

I posted [this the other day](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8avoxb/daily_discussion_monday_april_09_2018/dx37irl/) making a cautious case for a reversal

Right now we're getting very close to [breaking the local downtrend line from 3/5.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/apr5BU09/)  It'll be interesting to see, if we do in fact break up, if we get some accelerated momentum. u/sloppysynapses  I think we'll need to break $7500 to confirm direction change. 

There is potential in this phase (next 2 weeks) for a break from the 4 month bear trend, but I'm under no illusion that we're not still in a bear market.

Something of note that I have just begun to see a few brave souls mentioning here: since April 1 or so the crypto market as a whole has begun to decouple again. Not everything is moving in sync with BTC anymore. If you go down the list, past the first two entries (I know this can be frightening, so proceed with caution), you will see that there are a number of coins/tokens that are up significantly since April 1, and that some of them are now in the midst of new FOMO rallies. And I'm not just talking about Verge and Tron, which people here love to sniff at because their fundamentals suck / they're crooked.

So why should that matter to this sub, where the principled only trade one percent swings in BTC on high leverage?

It matters primarily because once you get far enough down the list, many of those coins that are rallying cannot, to my knowledge, be shorted, at least not as easily as BTC or the others in the top few. There is no Bitmex contract for Ontology.

So what does that mean? I submit that it means that fiat/USDT has begun to re-enter this market as a whole, but the strength of that movement is hidden from market cap stats because in the case of BTC and some of the other top coins, much of that money is entering on the short side, *or* it's off market in contracts that are not the actual coins. And *that* is suppressing prices that would otherwise be up were shorts and derivatives not skyrocketing. This also suggests to me that the coins that *can* be shorted will likely underperform a select group of those that cannot.

Now yes, I have heard the accusations that Binance and possibly others could be painting the tape for select coins, and that could be partly responsible for what's happening to alts. But if you believe that's the sole cause for the up moves, ask yourself, why are a fairly large number of coins rallying now, but not from the end of January to the end of March?

Shorts keep finding a way to keep growing. 

~5000 more short than long.

Closed my $4m long from $6744 posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8avoxb/z/dx2btwa), at an average of $6922, for a total profit of around 3% including fees. 
Bitfinex planned maintenance has started, expected to last an hour.

So all day the experts here have said ooh the BB is tight which ever way it goes its going to go BIG.  Not even $100.


According to our Sub banner we just crashed 10k. 

Talk about a flash crash.

The bull case is more convincing to me. I struggled to get a bear case that I thought looked right. Determining where retracement support will be found wasn't well executed in the bear case, though.

IMO, bulls seem to have a slight edge at this point. 64% of A&E double bottoms will break down before they are confirmed, and we're drawing one on the daily and one on the weekly. Hoever, confirming the daily all but confirms the weekly.
Couldn't not think of this sub when I saw [this pic](https://i.imgur.com/WE8m18O.png) (slightly modified) on /r/natureismetal today.
Could it be said that if we break up, it will be a lot more violent than if we break down (due to the shorters locking in profit and cushioning the drop)?
I'm a trader. I don't really care if the market chooses to go up or down from here. I just want it to be a decisive choice. Not a fakeout. Really hoping we don't see a fakeout from this symmetrical triangle/downtrend line like we did back in January. That's max pain there. Get a bunch of longs in after 2 bullish breakouts, then a drop to hell.

Overbought on 1hr RSI has been pretty reliable and the blowback from 7k was palpable. Opening small short here
Our ticker says $16,889 lol
Whale from 1000 BTC on bitfinex just broke up his wall in multiple 100 BTC walls. Trying hard to push this down. 
I keep seeing good market buys on ETH, while BTC seems to be dropping on the very short term.  Also, the ETHBTC ratio has been tracking BTC, multiplying BTC movements on ETH.  If I had to guess, I'm seeing a pump on BTC coming with a whale looking to capitalize on the ETHBTC ratio.  Thoughts?

Edit:  Ok, so soon after this there was a small dump.  Maybe that was phase 2?  Phase 3, profit?
Assuming the  thing implied here https://twitter.com/Andy_Hoffman_CG/status/984169092398571520 is true, can someone ELI5 how its actually performed? That is, how is the price being suppressed as to enable accumulation? I'd like to understand how someone could be able to do this.
Slightly meta, but I just wanna say that i appreciate the objectivity on this sub. It's one of the only subs i visit anymore because all the specific coin related subs are litteral cults, where the subscribers can't even take the slightest bit of critique or bearish sentiment in general. It's all baseless 'moon' bullshit, and it's getting old.
Based on [my chart from last night](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8b4twg/daily_discussion_tuesday_april_10_2018/dx4502r/), I've built out a Bull Range/Bear Range based on dates and long-term support from the dip/bounce on 10/18/17. Within six days, we should know which way the market is heading.

I've updated the chart and am properly publishing it through tradingview...     
Here's the [zoomed out, macro version](https://www.tradingview.com/x/piECGM3W/).     
Here's the [channel we're in now](https://www.tradingview.com/x/yfSAV3iy/).     
Here's the [bull/bear range](https://www.tradingview.com/x/HUbqUzER/).     

For the Bull Range, any sustained movement north of that number will mean we are trading above the channel, indicating a possible reversal into a sideways/bull market.     

For the Bear Range, any sustained movement south of that number will mean we are trading below the channel, indicating a possible continuance of the bear market.     

Here are the numbers:     

Date/Time|Bull Max|Bear Min
:--|:-:|:-:
04/12/18 00:00:00|$7027|$6505
04/13/18 00:00:00|$6933|$6514
04/14/18 00:00:00|$6839|$6523
04/15/18 00:00:00|$6745|$6532
04/16/18 00:00:00|$6651|$6541
04/17/18 00:00:00|$6557|$6550

NOTE: I'm reposting this since I just realized I posted it in Tuesday's discussion thread @ 11:59pm EDT. Let me know if this is a no-no.
In response to multiple posters below who thought that following massive sell walls for small scalps isn't profitable or actionable,
here is one snapshot from the past few days of PNL movements from following that specific action.
It's very easy to increase one's btc stack with a small amount of capital and some short-term scalps.

A message to admins- 
the curation of this thread has gone way too far off the rails.
Posts should be downvoted only if they are shill posts or irrelevant (altcoin focused, off topic, etc).  Otherwise you create an ineffective echo-chamber which alienates the community who made this place what it has been for so long. 

So we have an interesting situation: Crazy high amount of shorts but price refusing to go down despite that.

1. either they get fucked as they "sold" the market and have to buy higher.

2. or they know something we don't and the market is about to dumpy dumpy.

bringing popcorn and be right back.
This is what the BTC market without whale impulse looks like.
Gemini now has a daily withdrawal cap--$100k. I guess they are trying to be more like Coinbase.
No mods, yet still no 'I had a poopy' comments.
So has anyone put any thought to the tax bills for the exchanges? Their fees will be in crypto much of the time. 

Would they be selling themselves on market or carry out dark pool or OTC sales to meet their liabilities?
Still waiting for 7550 to break before entering, better to be safe than sorry. Not chasing these green dildos.

If the hackers can hack r/bitcoinmarkets what's stopping them from hacking Bitcoin? We need to sell before we lose everything guys 
The last several hours look like a bull trap to me. The sudden ease and buying materializing out of thin air, idk. Good luck if you’re longing here, hope I’m wrong. 
"Range bound" will return, right after a word from our sponsor
Half hedged June futures 6845
50 BTC ask on GDAX EUR at close to

r/Ethhodler and r/cryptocurrancy get worse by the day. Can someone please point me to a decent trading sub for alts. 
leveraged traders are talking about a sudden move one way or the other. but the drop in volatility and volume looks like a stable price has been found. markets dont move crazy like btc but price discovery was a trip this time. i am turning my dca back on. 
Massive delta hidden divergence. Be shocked if we didn't go up. Looking to re-short 7050ish.

Edit: and we popped 20 sec after I posted this.
So maybe with this pump is time to have this altcoin discussion thread we were promised but not in the mood to have...

Ok that would be hell for moderators. So i offer myself to moderate. I promise to only leave the dankest shitposts. 
If you need to calculate capital gains from a GDAX fills.csv, I have created a PowerShell script to do the calculations. That is provided either all transactions are done on GDAX or you manually input any transfers and their value when they were initially bought or finally sold. Check out https://github.com/weedoveropiates/PowerShell-GDAX/releases.

Enjoy!
Man, there's some really unusually crazy alt pumps going on right now.

In the last hour I've seen random pumps from Neo, then Litecoin, then Binance coin. One after the other.

Made $500 in that time just going YOLO.

Something has changed out there. I watch the charts every damn day and not seen anything like this since December. Not saying history is repeating itself at all. Just surprised to see such activity.

Predicting that we will see <6.5k before >7.5k because:

* It's been 2 weeks since we last saw 8k.
* Last 2 breakout attempts rejected at 7.5k/7.2k (38.2/23.6 retrace resistance from 9k>6.4k). 
* Daily RSI is at 14 day high and we are still sub 7k. 
* If daily RSI stays at current levels, there will be hidden bear div (lower high price & higher high RSI)
* 3 of the last 4 times that daily stochrsi was this overbought were followed by multiple red candles 


crypto is on the verge of a massive breakout. The last few months were not a bear market but a massive consolidation. When this is all said and done both bulls and bears are going to be shocked by the massiveness of the breakout.
Put in a scalp short at 6855 mostly (only?) based on the relatively violent rejections from 6900 and declining volume to continue pump. "If it can't go up it must go down." No real target, probably at the bottom of a 15min MACD trend at -8. Manual stop at 6900.

Was the price removal from the banner deliberate or is it a side effect from the subreddit being down?
Ok so its been green over the past 24 hours and the sentiment is bullish as usual.  I just want to say this is not looking good for a recovery.  The pumps are getting weaker, the volatility is shrinking as well as the volume, and the RSI has finished recharging to the point where we had the last major dump.  This is not what you want to see when looking for a reversal.  You want the pumps to be bigger and hold instead of being smacked back down to 6.5k.  The fact that we haven't broken 6.5k yet doesn't give me confidence we don't break it soon under these conditions. 

Imo the r/r favors a short here.  If we do have a reversal we're looking at a 400$ or so jump that holds for over a day.  While if we drop we're looking at about 1000$ drop and possibly more over several days.
Interesting someone posted a twitter theory about price suppression. If anything, I see this being propped up. There have now been 2 near-random high volume spikes when the 1 hr MACD was about to cross down. There was another one a bit earlier as the MACD started to wane also, but not quite at the crossover point. Historically, that crossover has been a sell signal (probably mostly bots). As it stands now, it hasn’t gone negative in almost 2 days.
Good for overall Crypto awareness.

EUROPE BULLISH ON BLOCKCHAIN: 22 COUNTRIES SIGN INTERNATIONAL BLOCKCHAIN PARTNERSHIP

http://bitcoinist.com/europe-bullish-on-blockchain-22-countries-sign-international-blockchain-partnership/
It's good to see how quickly our bears are adapting to an ever-shrinking pool of profit to anxiously slurp from. As Winter wanes and the buds of Spring bloom anew, the bulls start to smell roses.

$6.5k might not be the bottom, but, as we've learned, the R:R simply doesn't favor a short beyond scalps these days. Why make $500 when you can make $5000? 

Since Monday, I've started accumulating BTC and a select few alts in preparation for the sentiment plateau leading to our next run. If the trolls win out, I'll continue purchasing each step down to Goblin Town. But let's be honest, folks, not even /u/DushmanKush is short, here. That tells you how far we've come.

We may be in for months of uninspiring action, but my pain has ended. Another fire, another scar. Onward and upward.

Bullish.
Please tell me this is a fake picture... But Stats tells otherwise https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/8bemyn/normies_are_shorting/
Ticker at top says we're at 16k. I like to believe this scenario more than the current one.
Log chart:
Big picture: https://www.tradingview.com/x/QJ13mHJy/
Lots of lines (and I use the different colors to know what lines they are when zoomed in) but i think if it breaks down here the green lines will act as support.

Will need to make a decision soon
I’m not sure how much people follow other markets but I’m seeing prices in Korea as cheaper or the same price as western markets. This should never happen due to capital control laws.

The last time this happened we shot up to 12k on our bounce from 6k. Not saying that will happen now but I’m definitely going to be buying a variety of cryptos with a fair share of fiat.
the entire drop from 20k to 6.5k was a beartrap
stable price means eventually you are going to be running out of either seller or buyers, and when that happens the price either drops down or goes up 

so yes a spike is coming, the question is which direction. 

I'd say the fact that it doesn't appear people are willing to pay above $7K here is an indicator that it'll most likely break down. 

Additionally, and this is a big one, there are a LOT of indicators that the whales running this show are starting to come back. Lots of coins that had shit buy support the last few months suddenly doubled the order book on the buy side, those same coins have also had about 25% taken off the sell side. And this is pretty much universal.

Now normally people would see this and start thinking that its going to go back up. But I'm not 100% convinced yet, the fact that with all of that bull support, and the price still hasn't cracked $7K is bearish in my book. 

So my trading suggestion is as follows. If you don't want to miss the train, you can DCA about 10-20% of your stack at this price point. Sooner or later we'll def be hitting these numbers again even if this breaks down, so you won't be stuck holding this bag for too long if you get it wrong. 

I would then save the rest of your stack and buy if this thing gets above $8K once its confirmed that the whales are ready to take this thing back up again. 





A thing I think is worth noting is the [Volatility Index](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/volatility-index/). It's still trending down, and I see extended periods of stability as bullish. I think it gives users a chance to test bitcoin and see that it works. It gives people curious about bitcoin time to figure it out. And in my experience, prolonged stability periods can usually be found before large rallies.

Man, did a double-take when I saw that ticker...

Edit: It looks like a mod's account got hacked, and the hacker in question is trying to pump the BTC price by fucking with this sub. LOL. As if that would have any effect on the price whatsoever

15M and 1H RSI are approaching 70 along with the short term resistance. Get your stops in in case this thing does a 180 quickly.
Newly debuted decentralized twitter 'Peepeth' on the front page of hackernews:

Glad to see dapps beginning to roll out. Decentralized, self sovereign data ownership is about to become widely 'cool'.
I hold BTC, ETH & a little Monero long term.

Everything else I feel has little to zero dev community, use or substance. And long term, frankly, if I'm honest with myself, I can only objectively reason my way to holding ETH.

Most importantly, the power law/compounding effect among developer communities is extremely pervasive. I say this as a full time dev/low level engineer.

When Plasma implementations are live, the demand for quasi-public chains like EOS et al. will tend toward zero.

How might one justify holding other cryptos? (beyond selling to a greater fool on a pump-cycle).

What catalysts make a strong broader dev community materialize ?
This morning I overheard my barber trying to explain to his customer how to short Bitcoin. 🤩
I am glad that we are seeing some trading. :)
Yesterday i wrote that the last time 1h bbands were this tight was on 25.3. . They just got even tighter. Last time they were this tight was on 25.11.. not using this information to trade, but might signal a major move.
Low interest rates on bitcoin shorting and backwardation on futures. If you trust the exchanges, you can make money selling bitcoin short in finex and buying quarterlies. If price recovers you can make 2-8% almost risk free.

This might explain the big short interest. I know there are hundreds of millions interested in such a trade. There is already half a billion of usd collecting interest, so lots of money chasing low rewarding trades with little risk.
If/when it makes it to the downtrend line of the wedge there is likely to be hidden bearish divergence on the 1 hour

I have a question, was the big green spike a big short closing, or people getting stop hunted?

https://datamish.com/dashboard/db/btcusd
Was screwing around on trading view looking for patterns or something I haven't seen yet. You could maybe draw this bear pennant on the daily: https://imgur.com/a/Y0KzP

Not perfect - would prefer if the 7.5 bounce was a bit lower, but for such a large pattern it's alright.

Doesn't really change my outlook - still waiting for 7.2k to break definitively before buying in and the resistance of the top of the pennant coincides with that area, and the flag breaking down would occur simultaneously with the gigantic descending triangle breaking down. 


Is the sub back under control of the mods?
I'm crazy, right?

2K sell wall on bitfinex at $6955. Someone trying to protect his short ?
Wall gone, that's the FOMO signal guys.
A few alts are rallying today. If 2017 taught me anything, alts rallying led to btc absorbing those gains a few days later.

No-trade-zone here in the middle of the bear pennant.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/fc5xmv3i/

If we break up, 7.2k, 7.5k, and 7.8k must fall to confirm mid-term bullish sentiment up. Break down and the bottom is anyone's guess again, I think the low 5k's will be good for a bounce (previous ATHs, pole length).
Bitfinex back up.
39k shorts, these guys do not stop, they really think they can margin short Bitcoin to Goblin Town.
/u/mikeXBT wow you're one hell of a predictor should have followed your trade, but decided against just in case 
1,000 BTC buy wall on BFX. Pinch me I’m dreaming 

Edit: ephemeral wall 
RSI has cooled off on all time frames following the recent pump. I'm impressed that it's been able to have healthy retracement without getting slammed down by bear resistance. We could see that move up to 7100 that we've been waiting for. 
I feel truly insane watching this much hopium getting posted after a $100 rise (150 before getting slammed back at 7k) especially looking back at the last several weeks and months
I'm selling here only because if I was a big whale wanting to accumulate a lot more than now would be the time to dump. We are at resistance from 11.7k and if we dump here sentiment would falter and it could fall a lot. If we break resistance, though, I don't think we'll have a huge fomo candle so there will be plenty of time to buy in, imo.
Entered a low leverage long here. This squeeze opportunity is too good to pass up, even if its slightly unlikely.
I've just placed my first stop order on GDAX.  Hold me.
I'm starting to think that an illiquid market such as this one means that people are so fed up with bitcoin going down that they are either in fiat waiting to enter when they have a clear signal that the bottom is in, or they are just holding. So whales can only steal from other whales. No honor among theives I guess haha. I personally think so little trading means the bottom is in. Good luck trading mates.

Edit: the bottom was in and it was 6k. I'm probably wrong tho. This is all conjecture :)
I fully support all short traders, please keep shorting and please use laveridge at least x 100 ...
I am so generous giving money away going Long here :-)


Btc stable at 6850, but it seems like the alt season is back. The adhd impatient traders just move to things with more volatility, but and interesting indicator is too see when the flow reverses and if this will lead to sell pressure 
I have a question regarding the open longs/shorts. Is the amount presented in total open orders or in total BTC? Thanks in advance.
Broken BART spotted on the 5 min chart. 6850 -> 6800 -> 6850.
I was really hoping for more shorts to pile in before we get thr next leg up. As you can see shorting at bottom of trend channel has high risk with low return.

Do you guys find this good for BTC price for retail investors? I understand the concept and I think it's good news for BTC  and crypto in general but I can't see how it can be good for pricing. Not trying to FUD, just looking for opinions.

[Bitcoin dominance graph](https://imgur.com/a/rfaIY) looks like it is poised for another tumble.  Maybe this is just how crypto slowly moves on from Bitcoin.  People want to buy alts, not Bitcoin and that's why the BTC price is stagnant.  Every BTC rise gets diluted out into the alts people want to buy.  The strongest surging category is the "Others" light blue line which would indicate a healthy diverse crypto ecosystem is taking hold.
I expect we will make another down turn to around 6.75k just to increase the confussion and to play out the pennant. In around 5 days I expect the real action starts with the tightening of the 1d Bbands. I expect a fakeout and than a quick move in the other direction to have max pain.
Twice rejected at the 6950 range today. 
EOS/BTC pair on Binance has almost 2.5x of BTC volume than GDAX. 
The contrarian thing do do right now seems to be contrarian of the contrarians.
For all the chat of there being more shorts open than longs, there sure feels like there's a lot of vocal longers in this sub 
Four hour cloud looks like it's about to get popped on the third attempt. Nice and thin, despite the momentum lines being bearish (a cross after a kumo escape would be expected and quite bullish). The chikou has a bit more work to do, but a slowly-does-it scenario would give a very easy breakout target. 

4h: https://www.tradingview.com/x/sNurEf5V/

My other chart today is the weekly, which I feel I've hardly reviewed for two weeks now (ie since it closed under 8k for the first time in '18). I'm closely watching the chikou here as it's about to come into contact with price and then momentum lines. I've very few bullish expectations, with momentum lines inverted, thin near-vertical cloud and a recovery target of 10k+, but I think the behaviour of the chikou will be very indicative of what's to come.

2228 BTC wall on Bitfinex anint budging for now. 
We are at log resistance again: https://www.tradingview.com/x/0urxp78d/
So, Bart about to break down?  15m crossed to the downside and this mid term downtrendline seems to keep the price down still https://www.tradingview.com/x/rZpCBsb4

The thing I observe is that the volatility and action seems to stabilize since every drop the last month, this is good I guess

Still havming my short from  6920 but will probably close it tonight if nothing happens
[removed]
I dont know how people are comfortable with shorting rn. Price is pretty stable despite shorts increasing, plus ETH is about to confirm a double bottom if it breaks above $420 - which could potentially drag the whole market up.
Closing my long and opening a 2x short when finex opens. 4H looks like a rising wedge inside a bear flag and 12H looks like a big descending triangle. Im going to ignore the high amount of shorters until they run out of funding. Right now they have plenty.   
Also opening up a big ETH short
Remember when longs outnumbered shorts heavily in early December and we had a huge long squeeze and the price didn't triple. 


Something I’ve noticed is there are a lot of less TA posts now then there were 2 months ago. Remember all those cup and handle jokes? I wonder why...
does anyone know any good tutorials for writing a trading bot?
Any time there is a spoofy buy or sell wall, the way to win is to trade the opposite way.  Buy into or sell into the walls.
Another user's post about the daily StochRSI was removed, but it actually seems to be a pretty interesting oscillator to keep an eye on in this bear market, especially as we approach descending resistance. 
Is it not possible that the rising shorts are just straddle positions? Meaning there won't be a short squeeze per say because the shorts are not naked. A move in either direction could mean 2-3k from here so straddling could be useful. Just put a stop at like $500 in either direction.

edit: 

So also this could mean there is not some "whale conspiracy" to release FUD. Just a bunch of big players that don't know which way it will go, they just know the move will be large.
I saw earlier that someone said that the alts are on the rise. Can confirm. 

More of a 'bubbling' than a decent rise. Whether that's out of boredom, confidence or fomo for short term gains it remains to be seen.

I'm tentatively flipping from neutral / neutral to neutral / bullish and I'm going on the basis sub 6k bitcoin is off. If it goes to 6k again I'll have to face up to a 10% hit but it's a decent enough risk to take. Especially if shorting really is the new black.

Still expecting bitcoin to drop a bit but swings of 3-500 vs multiday 1k plummets. But what do I know, I'm just another stranger on the internet.
Its interesting watching how the bull memes adapt to changes in price action. 

Parabolic increase: to the moon! 

Rapid free fall: capitulation incoming! 

Sustained sideways: Wyckoff accumulation zone!

It’s almost as if any movement at all is predictive of an incoming bull run...

Don’t get me wrong, some of these could be correct at some point, but it’s important to check your bias if your hypothesis is unfalsifiable in your mind.
I just don't see anyone buying in.  Dumb money got smart.
These Bart formations are becoming almost too predictable. 
I have a feeling that this will be a green dildo day.
Finally the US tax returns and wall street bonuses and George Soros fund buying hitting the market!
Good work mods getting the subreddit back. Was worried about a possible dump because of this fud 😥
There seems to be a fractal forming just like the pattern of the battle of 10K, we all know what happened next. Also the RSI, MACD, and Bollingerbands have had some time to cool off getting ready for another dive into goblin town. 

I think that if one were to bet on the fractal by shorting then the current range of 6900-7150 would be a great entry with stops just over 7300. Target for this dive could be in the 3-4K range. There may be a capitulation wick below. 

Betting long then stops just below 6500 and buy above. (though I personally wouldnt go long atm).

That one big whale on Bitfinex from the 1000 BTC wall a few hours from earlier is really persistent and keeps setting up his 100 BTC sell walls all spread out.

is that a 2k BTC sell wall at 6.955 USD on Bitfinex?
Really hoping for one more pump to 7k to fill the rest of my hedge. As far as I'm concerned this is just a "short the bleed-up" opportunity until a higher high is hit. 
[removed]
I mine as well as trade and what I mine (zcash) is dropping in difficulty and Bitcoins hash rate appears to of dropped off sharply (edit, mioticping highlighted it was an error - thanks!). As in a big player just took their toys and put them away for a bit.

There will be a couple of days to go before the difficulty adjusts to make it profitable again.

Nothing to do with trading but just an FYI.
Closed my long from 6630 at 6995 (it hit my ask order) at the same time opening a small short. So far playing out exactly as I thought it would. Here is the chart I posted 2 days ago : Https://www.tradingview.com/x/PW8z4hrD
I'm going short with 10x leverage here (which is a ton of leverage for me... and I never go short) because this is mos def a fakeout.  Bears are gonna dump any second.
[removed]
Anyone who finds this move as bullish is crazy AF.  This past week has been chop until we continue downward.
This has to be the bottom, buying pressure is unreal. Im blown away.
The reason I'm in fiat is because of the danger of another Bitfinex FUD. I accept that perhaps this will not happen now and there will be a bull run, but I'm not comfortable going full in until we get this thing past us. This exchange is like a ticking timebomb. Until we know it's either all fraud or there's nothing wrong with them, I'll be constantly looking behind my shoulder and doubt any bullrun. But yes, a bullrun can happen and Bitfinex, even if insolvent and fraudulent, may collapse much later.

EDIT. As I said previously, I cannot really understand who the hall holds 5k of coins (remember those walls popping up?) on an exchange that's as shady as Bitfinex is. Either those are fake money or this person has the owner's balls under complete control.

Anyone long ETHBTC ratio - longed it at 0.059, after 0.058 held. Trying to gauge TP point as momentum indicator for the entire market. ETHBTC ratio or any ALTBTC ratio only goes up, if the market overall is going up / stable (there are exceptions, but in general it is true).

I've noticed some big market purchases and sales (30+ coins) being made on GDAX this afternoon with little effect on the price, strangely enough. 

Also, for what it's worth, I just bought 5 Litecoin via bank account on Coinbase and received them in my account instantly. Not sure if this is due to the fact it was LTC or that it wasn't a large sum of money. My past experience has only been with BTC purchases and they've always taken 7-9 days to process into my account. 
Busy the next 10 hours with little time to check the carts/ general TA.

Does anyone have a general consensus about the next move of the market / BBands? 

If someone could post a link to a trading view that would be great. Thanks!

Daily Bitcoin Update (4/11/18) + Technical Analysis

https://youtu.be/8R3zWmR-0J8
[removed]
I know technical analysis can be unreliable. BUT i do think that BTC will continue to fall. There is just not enough volume atm. It's possible that the temporary increase is cause BTC is finding some support due to the RSI and 50week MA. 
Here's my full thoughts: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWZo00bIkx8&feature=youtu.be
Do you all honestly think [this will ](https://www.tradingview.com/x/2o4Ppv2R/) break up? We’re in a flag (bear) AND inside of the wedge still with resistance overhead. I have no idea why the hell [people are longing](https://www.tradingview.com/x/3iAPzqpn/) here. About to get rekt. I could be wrong though...
[removed]
last bear market we had before this one was all summer last year. That was painful. If this one's bear market is around the same length, then theoretically it should be ending real soon, since it's been about 3.5 months now.
Higher low, lower high , bulls euphoric, bears in disbelief. 

Either bears get rekt shorting all the way to ATH or the hammer is about to drop. Latter more likely. 
Had a few uni deadlines for yesterday but now it’s just revision for May exams. 

Taking today mostly off, need a break after these last few days plus it’s too tight to try to trade this thing imo.

However, what i am doing is planning what im gonna do when this thing pops. If we pop down then ill probably short after a decisive 1H/4H close below 6600.

The real fun will start if we pop upwards though. 7100 would be a nice start but I'm not really getting too ballsy until we hold 7400-7600.

Whilst BTC figures itself out, im looking at alts. if this is the start of a recovery/accumulation (which im starting to believe to be true) then i think we'll get an alt cycle. some are already popping off.

Thing is, even if there is no alt cycle and we drop down instead of up then at least ill have a basic plan already in mind and then ill just have to readjust for next cycle. rather plan and save the plan for later than get caught with my pants round me ankles.
Ok, this is the most relevant google trend i could find. Keep in mind a constant google trend doesnt indicate constant interest but interest growing at a constant rate. 
Anyway this 6700-7200 range is a bit dull. I really think we need a bigger drop before we break out of this.
Not believing this bull flag formation on 1h to play out, so I am opening a short here at 6920 on swaps. I could be wrong, so I place stops just above the daily highs if this is start of reversal patterns. But so far this bear market has proven me the other way, so I prefer to bet on that instead. Also the 1h RSI just touched 70 so a technical move down a bit could be expected

On the other hand, if it breaks up and tries for 7100 and 6900 becomse the new support, I will maybe start look for a nice tasty breakout long position
New whale plan: use your btc to pump alts then use the new btc gained from those pumps to dump while you are short?
I know it can seem that the market can't fall much more so great time to buy, but remember we went parabolic from around 1k and support line broke, next one is not until around 3k, an overshoot could get us to 1k. On top of that the 100dma and the 200dma are about to cross, for long term trend trades that is a big short sign.

But really any move between 3k and 12k over the next month is quite likely

One of those little (~50BTC) sell walls from earlier just got eaten at $6,940 on BFX. Interesting...

Whale logic help?

If you see large sell walls show up and disappear, what is the whale trying to achieve?  Scare the market down, buy up some coin at a lower price/maker fees, then market buy to pump?

Thanks!
How many longs and shorts were opened in that crazy bull run last year?

Edited: I don't think that number of shorts is the reason  BTC will go up, people just became smarter and can recognize and use tools for trading better then before. The number of stupid shorts in the middle of the channel is worrying. I guess last seven days messed with everyone's head, nobody is sure in anything anymore. 
Ack, that decision of 'take profits now' or 'set my stop loss higher' decision I didn't expect to have today as it's been so long.
OT but Binance is like play wack a mole with alts right now. Sudden 10% spikes for absolutely no reason only to come back down after a few hours to where it started. So much manipulation. Times are getting tough. Maybe its tax time for whatever jurisdiction they are in
[removed]
Trade the range (6.5 - 7.1). Whales are accumulating. Might be awhile before we are out of this fog
Since there are so many shorts open compared to longs, there would need to be more downward movement or else shorts may start closing and causing buy pressure (or vice versa).

If that gap between shorts and longs gets too big, that would mean that most of the sell pressure in the markets has most likely dried up and when they start closing, there will be massive buy pressure.

What is considered a "big gap"?
massive sell walls up all day at ~6860.
keeping us from going up
[removed]
The BTC price doesn’t appear to have moved on Coinbase/GDAX for an hour, whereas the price of other coins has.

Is It fair to assume this is is some kind of software bug? Has there been that kind of tightness in the price over an hour in the past 12 months?

Edit: Looking at the order book, there’s a 50 BTC buy wall vs. 1 BTC sell wall. That’s got to be a bug no?
[removed]
How long can the whales manipulate the price to stay at this level with such low volume (7k volume on GDAX)?

It never really occurred to me that spoofing large buy walls and wash trading may be enough for us to reach an equilibrium, even when almost no new people are actually buying. Maybe I will be more bullish if this continues to pan out. 
Although interest in BTC continues to wane, we approach 7K.  This really shows the strength of BTC.
We broke the 11.5k mar 6 to 9k mar 24 line in a rather sudden way.

It was only a 100$ jump, but the timing seems a little... to exact I think a whale must have drew the exact same line considering it was a month time scale, yet it had ~30 minute accuracy

It was already broken by 7.1k on the 9th but that seemed to trigger the red dildo of the week
Funny now there's a wall on the bid side on both gdax and finex. beartrap?

edit: now its gone and look like it got flipped to the sell side
So basically we're doing the same thing we did last night except $100 higher. Went to bed around 1am it was 6853, woke up around 8 and it was exactly 6853. So tomorrow night 7053?

Folks this is the start of the "new" bull market.
last 4 hours on finex, 1k out of the 3.5 k sold were new shorts (compared to 200 longs). This is not sustainable fellow bears.
7020 $ is the next major support. If we pass this line we are out of the triangle formation. 
Unbelievable that there is so much worry about the mods.  I guess with all of the effort these days to filter opinions it makes sense.
[removed]
[removed]
I posted about this last night and got downvoted to oblivion, but we've been stuck in a range with a lot of diversified buy support (i.e., not coming from ONE source) around $6850 since yesterday.  Unfortunately for bulls, there are two or three people with MASSIVE sell walls up keeping the price suppressed.  Yesterday it was roughly 100btc sell walls around $6860-$7k which we bounced off of three times, then the price jumped over $6900 as soon as they were moved up.  Now there's roughly 170btc up to be sold between $6905-$7k which is keeping us from moving higher.

Downvote me again morons.  Or, you know, use this relevant and helpful information to make some trades.

Look back in December for longing, it's a good indicator when we are close to upper/lower limits
Wow this is actually legit
can't really see it in google trends, peak in december though

https://trends.google.fr/trends/explore?q=shorting%20bitcoin
Number one result here in the netherlands
You do realize that Google suggestions are based on your browsing history and data Google has collected from you, right?
Yes but in netherlands typing ‘buying’ gives you ripple and bitcoin on 2nd and 3rd respectively. Can you imagine how much more often people type in buying instead of shorting? 
It's the 5th result on duckduckgo for me (which I never use but they don't track you so I was  curious). 

Also what else do you expect to come after "shorting"? Stock stuff and then bitcoin seems about right...lol usually like your posts but this almost seems like a satirical play on the "muh short squeeze" meme

Attention, we could break it, go to 10k, and start the slow bleed to 3k. This is what happened in 2014, remaining skeptical here.
Lets borrow about 7K BTC from multiple whales and make it happen in the next 96 hours. :)

Ya, if we break $7500 again I believe there will possibly be quite a bit more upside 

Sorry can't wrote more right now but i generally agree and have been reconsidering a few of my more bearish interpretations of the charts lately 
I read that as "Mr. Worf" and thought I was on a Rule 34 sub or something.
Some of them(maybe 15?) can be shorted at Bitfinex. Not the super popular ones but still stuff like ETP, EOS or REP

But yeah, in general I agree with your point. Another thing to note is that Binance said they will add USD pairs for most alts soon, this might be the end of BTC as the gateway coin
Look, i actually believe that ontology coin is not a bad coin at least in concept, but with that name i always think in oncology .

I had a daydream that Jaime Demon bought hundreds of millions of dollars of BTC and dumped them on the market to destroy crypto once and for all - but none of the alts followed. Checkmate, Demon. The alts (can) diffuse the banks’ attack surface.
39k? srsly?

I feel like allot of people are going to lose their money if this continues, we have been flat for a while now
How do I read this and what does it mean?
I don't really believe the following, but it is a possibility that exchanges/whales are inflating the open positions to try and get traders to open opposing positions. Again, not really a strong believer in this theory, but it is still a possibility to consider.
Those are some THICC BBands there. 

Although im not sure if they mean anything in that graph. 
So we go Up. 7K+ soon

30 more minutes... http://bitfinex.statuspage.io/incidents/bgpt2m648jqc
they are still tight.
Because many people thought that a breakout incites FOMO either way... Lets see what happens when we drop 1,5%.
get off the 15 min chart.
BB is tight on medium time frames and if we tighten high time frames this will take months to play out. 
Yeah, but it is common to have a fakeout rally out of a tight BB and then go hard in a different direction a short time later. 
A surprisingly graphic but accurate analogy...
Looks like your analysis was spot on this morning. BTC practically had a 10-day old chili induced diarrhea explosive release upward.
It's a long way to 11.8 to get the confirmed A&E but my hopium pipe is fully loaded for it.

Can a DCA strategy for noobs wait until it breaks through? I've got a few friends who were smart enough not to buy in late Dec-Jan asking if nows a good time to get in.
Yes
I don't see how this can be measured. Don't forget, there are also a large number of longs open and we're nearing our previous capitulation wick price. If 6.4 does not hold, I don't see anything for bulls to hang onto. 

Of course, there will most likely be a big bump up if 7.2 is broken through, but to say that it will be more violent isn't guaranteed.
yes
Completely agree, but each times i've mentioned that fractal here i've been downvoted. 
I think thats likely, but I'm also not sure the market has the momentum to even make it to 7250
I'm watching[ those lines as well](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Xot9P0c0/), don't see the excitement until we get to that green zone and stay there or go higher.
Something weird is going on, all of the mods (myself included) were just removed.
I've noticed when the automod links to the new daily thread from the previous one, it always lists the price as 16889.97
Just noticed that and was gonna say the same. Sign of things to come??

RemindMe! 2 days
There are several methods which are really effective in this space.

1. Buy OTC as much as possible.  You can then even sell a percentage of coin on spot markets at key times to work the price lower.

2. Buy when books are really thick.  Buy at the Bid as much as possible.  Sell when the books are thin.  So you move the price down more with the selling than you move it up with the buying.

3. Utilize TA to defend key levels and paint the tape at important times.  If price approaches a key resistance, make sure there is a clear rejection there.  Most traders will go with this.

4. Promote bearish narratives wherever you can.  Utilize social media.
i think OTC tradding... But no fucking clue. 

Or just buy sell walling.
The implication is someone is accumulating in $100 increments, which means a single whale is buoying the market. 

$6,630 three days ago

I would 800% avoid the cryptocurrency sub then 
I don't even visit the other crypto subs any more. /r/cryptocurrency is decent if you want to get basic facts about shitcoins, but even that's suspect. 
I love how accountable everyone keeps everyone else here if they make a dumb or inaccurate statement. I think it keeps me from getting too high or too low on the markets.
as a (usual) "reader only" of this Sub i agree.

I dont trade but i like the seeming objectivity here too, might be because people here (can) make money on the way up and down.

so, cheers guys, i am out again
This sub is as guilty as the others at times.  It is a bit better than most subs for sure though.  Play safe.  I come here for entertainment purposes mostly.
This sub was absolutely fucking awful during the run up to $20k. Anyone posting charts got laughed out of the building by people who claimed TA was worthless and how Bitcoin would fly straight to $100k. It's gotten a lot better recently now that a lot of these individuals got washed out of the markets.

Ethtrader has gotten better over the past 1-2 weeks but I suspect once Eth is over $600 the moonkids will be back with their astronomical price projections. 
4/17, the day the earth stood still. 
Thanks!  So, what happens on 4/18.... :)
Do you think there's a chance it'll mildly break thru this wedge and price action will stay suppressed until middle of next month when it's a wedge from ATH?  Like this one.  (Charted from mobile, sorry).

FYI, 4/13 is a Friday
You went with the walls or against them?
Buying/selling into walls is great if you can catch the moment they are lifted and the price jumps. But it doesn't always go that way, sometimes the wall moves without a lift, or it's lifted and replaced too quickly to catch. 

I find it easier on lower volume items or on alts though, it's easier to track the walls and there are fewer people building them, and less players filling the spread. 

Edit: Also it's easiest if the wall stays against the spread. If regular people or bots end up filling up the spread you don't jump well when the wall is lifted or moved.  If a wall is right directly against the spread it's a good opportunity. 
Cool.  Thanks for the insights ... I honestly don't follow walls that much in my trading strategy, but will look more into this
Tax season almost over, people had to sell to pay for cap gains. Not a good time to be short.
Mass effect.
About 2: governments shutting down cryptotrading, Gox coins still have to be sold, no mainstream adoption, public interest waning. Those are things we all know, right?
Yup. It's like sheep trying to figure out where they'll run next, ignoring the fact that it will be decided by the farmer and his dogs.
I've always had that cap for ach.  Was I missing out? 
Sometimes you gotta step up and be the change you want to see.
They don't just have to sell for tax purposes.  They have other expenses that need to be paid with fiat.  Even if they pay their employees with crypto, that staff will be converting at least some of that into dollars to pay their bills.  It's a constant source of selling really which is hopefully more than offset by buying from traders (either new traders or existing traders replacing losses or adding to their trading roll).
yes
I'm waiting until above 12k to confirm double bottom. Until then trend is down and I only enter shorts or stay flat
7,2 for me.
IDK man, I could see this hanging out for a bit, while you sit on your hands.  Then it liquidates some shorts, starts a bull run, you FOMO at 7550, then watch all the longs from 6900 cash out, shorts move back in, then you ride the train back to 6500 where you wish you had just been long from the beginning...
while i'm basically "all-in" if I was giving some advice to someone today i'd probably recommend what you're doing. 

....which is in part why I think we have like zero volume in either direction, but that doesn't make it wrong :P

Don't know how to read this given her well known bullish bias
What did Granny say the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process suggests the price range is for this mean? What is “significant”?

I don’t usually follow old ladies, but when there’s a real mathematical process involved, I pay attention. 
She sounds like a very intelligent woman. I'll be going 100x short with her. 
Bruh
Much words. 
Good thing I sold everything at 6600. 
I heard Bitcoin CEO uses Mcafee Antivirus, we're good fam. 
🤔
Looks similar to what happened a few days ago before that big drop. 
Who knows but entirely possible that push higher fails to generate a cascade and instead cascades the other way for a nice strong dip. Perhaps the 300BTC+ sold in the last 5mins is the beginning.

At which point the whole world goes short and gets rekt.
2,000 BTC sell wall at $6,955 on finex. sombody is flexin
You mean bid?
They don't really exist. There's very little legitimate discussion involving alts 
I don't think there is one yet but I would be interested in one. However it'd be tough to parse out the signal from the noise with all the shilling, and TA is going to somewhere between difficult to useless with such illiquid coins
turned my dca back on for the first time in a year. before then, it was running through the 14-15 bear. imo, we may be in this area for a long time. and just when people don't expect anything, we'll start climbing again. my game now and always has been accumulation
ehh in 2014 it stabilized at these price levels a few times before exploding up or down. I'm hesitant to say we're just gonna sit here for any more than another week or two 
Well, it depends. Rsi says nothing at all, bbands in the 4h says the same, but they are very tight in the hourly. 

Resistance and support says very big move up or down in the next 2-4 days, Elliot waves seem to say its time to go up too . Stoch rsi very oversold in the 4h but with a heart full of neutrality in the 1h... 

So no fucking clue really. 
All right come on, be honest, it was you
Delta hidden divergence?
Mods account got hacked tho.
My expectation is that if/when BTC moves back into a bull cycle, alts will trail (ratio), then catch up when BTC pulls back (most cycles have worked this way). People tend to chase the winning coin.

Right now alts are way down (they may go down even further), but it's not a bad place for accumulation if you seem promise in some project.

Risk long term is that most alts are vaporware/ephemeral and so I'm expecting that between now and 2021, as the space matures, most will simply die off as the real-world value propositions of the more sturdy alts will become clear.  The lesser redundancies will wither off the vine. 
A sole ALT sub would end up worse than Bulls vs bears in here.
Maybe this is fine, but this is a gentle reminder to never execute random code off the internet unless you understand what it does, especially when it asks for admin privileges. I personally would never run this.
Released a new version to fix some bugs I found.
It's starting to feel like beginning of *"Bitcoin is consolidating, alts pump, then Bitcoin"* pattern returning.

I've got some shitcoin bids lower though, kinda hope it doesn't take off from here without dipping again first.

> Something has changed out there. 

Yeah it's like a sea-breeze has just sprung up in the afternoon as the landmass warms. 180deg shift.

> not seen anything like this since December. 

Same. Though I have a very narrow shitcoin focus as an indicator.
rofl
Definitely good. The more the merrier. It's at like 7pct of Americans.  If it gets to 10, raise the roof 'cause Jack and his beanstalk need room to grow and slay the giant.  And I say this as someone who's currently short on some bullshite little trade.
Do they place bets on their own little swaps or spread? So much more entertaining then Bingo surely.
How is it overbought at such terrible volume moving just in a sideways range? I'm confused by this indicator because its completely counter intuitive.
Looks like we are looking at the exact same indicators, this has been my exact analysis as well 
Bitcoin is the new Ebola?

REEEE-
Because we're up 400$ from 6500?

Jesus... I'm long because we found a local bottom apparently but this is ridiculous.
i still believe in [PentarhUdi's chart](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/YRZvdurN-The-target-of-current-bubble-lays-between-40k-and-110k/)
Yup. It's going to put all previous Bitcoin rallies to shame, even the one in December. 
conjecture
> The last few months were not a bear market 

The last few month fit the conventional definition of a bear market which is down 20%.  Down 70% is a supercharged, ultra, very clear bear market.

Where it goes from here doesn't change any of that.
You know something I don't or just a guess?
Should McAfee's dick be worried or nah?

Were you shocked by the “massiveness” of the breakout?
This sounds very pleasing to the ears (secretly plans more stack to be added at the beginning of this breakout).

They say dreams do come true at times, I hope what you said is one of those time. haha.
Many are in alts too, I've been accumulating my alts through shorting. 

Many in here are anti-alt too of course. 

Just hard to discuss here without it being OT and turning into "rate my portfolio"

I do hope this sub starts a dedicated alt thread at some point. Because there's no where else that can be as objective.  But lately even most the alt trading places I look at have been dead and the discussion just ends up directing to BTC discussions, as BTC is primarily driving it anyway.  Once the momentum picks back up it'll be appropriate again.  We are seeing some alt activity picking up this week again, and the discussion in this thread has gone from almost zero mentions to fairly frequent. 
lots of people here have. did a poll on it a bit back and some 40%+ people had bought alts 
I assume you're only talking about other *crypto* investments, so BTC, ETH, and 1 ERC 20.
BTC, ETH (and some alts to trade back and forth)
In my opinion being a Bitcoin maximalist doesn't necessarily mean not holding other Crypto. I may like Tesla as my favorite car company and will be very successful in the future but that doesn't mean I won't invest in Ford. My "ideological preference" would never blind my idea of logical diversification. With that being said I only hold a handful of other Crypto which are older than 1 year but I am open to other projects as they continue to show progress, there are just too many promises floating around right now and beyond the last 6 months most promises in Crypto world have bad odds of being completely fulfilled  
I'm in all fiat but usually I am at least 75% alts since my only goal is to ncrease my BTC count. Trading BTC by itself is too difficult and nerve wracking for me when you see your dollar amount go down but with alts even if BTC is down, you may still be up in SAT value which is more comforting for me.

But bring up alts in this sub and you will get downvoted. 
Crap, side effect. I think it actually used to be linked to a bot's profile. I'll see if the other mods have any ideas for fixing it.
Did you ever eat your ball or was it always ballocks?
Agreed. I've been scaling in sells as we've moved up the past three days. I have serious doubts that this will make it past the short-term downward trend line.

So you're not the barber who told their customers how to short?
> Why make $500 when you can make $5000?

Because you can't make $5000
Oh man comments like this really make me hard. The bullish hopium and smugness just waiting to be crushed. Don't want anyone to lose money, i'm not that evil, but all the 'bears get rekt' shit makes me think you kind of deserve it. 
> not even /u/DushmanKush is short

Bullish.
Never underestimate the ability of greed to over ride common sense and previous bad experiences. I totally believe this is happening as lots of trading groups on Discord are talking about shorting 'being where it's at' where usually it was pump n dump.

Which is why I'm more bullish.
suddenly i regret shorting, eh
It will end badly for many of them yes, but that can happen today or in a month...
That's why i start moving my stop limits when i'm in profit, to catch a ride but don't get caught when it reverses. Might be stopped more easily, and that sucks, but its safer that way.

Seems legit to me , most of my dumb friends are watching vids on shorting BTC
Edit: imagine tho if they are right BTC goes to 3k they all make a shit ton of money , wasn't it the Satoshi vision?

Whelp, feeling good about my longs...
Man I saw that and just glazed over it.  I guess in my mind bitcoin is still worth 16k
LOL... I F5'ed a couple of times in incredulity
looking the exact same lines, even though stoch on daily almost never fails, macd and rsi says we have to test the resistance on the bigger triangle around 8500ish first. either way, it's not easy to say which way we will go.
Aligns with my thoughts on BTC slow grinding up to about 7100-7200 at most before making our way at a double bottom attempt at 6K that we may see a daily bounce and probably some action like we've seen recently then down to test the 5K high. That's what my moneys on I'm in fiat and 3x short at 7K on finex with targets of 5400 for a short and 5-5.2K or just above for a long entry. I may cut losses on my shorton a higher timeframe candle above 7200(maybe 7500 if I feel risky but I will probably de-risk the position at 7200 and add at 7500) depending on how the market acts. 

Shorts are high, that's slightly worrying but how do we know the majority are not simply short hedged anyone with substantial holding will be considering that given downside potential. You cant squeeze a hedge like you cant squeeze a fully collateralized long because theres no liqui price. So assuming that at some point people expect the price to go lower those are fairly safe. Longs on the other hand are edgy because every bottom has so far turned out to be false and average joe trader probably play the one position because it's hard(well harder) to get good entries for a long and a short and manage both positions unless you want to be at your computer a lot more.
> This should never happen due to capital control laws.

They are indeed separate markets. That's no reason for them to be valued higher. They could be half the price of elsewhere in a few months for no particular reason. They're beyond our influence and vice versa. 
next run to 100k will be a yuuuuge bulltrap
Maybe in the stock market but I am having a hard time finding a correction in BTC that ended in a bear pennant/near double bottom 
There's the rainbow charts and stability charts that used to be posted here daily before this mega bull run from sub 300. It's now a site somewhere but I can never remember the link.

I was thinking... wow.. guess those shorts got squeezed 
What happened?
[deleted]
The remarkable thing about this current pump is that it's been fairly slow in developing, but steady with little push-back from the bears. 

Edit: Spoke too soon!
No. It was always cool. It's about to become mainstream. Cool is ahead of the curve by definition. 
We've tried them (they didn't really take off - and that was before someone had the clever idea of grafting a volatile, speculative token to the side of it):

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaspora_(social_network)

https://sandstorm.io/

Edit: also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem is kind of a cold, hard shower for most dapps if they ever want to progress beyond toys. FB and twitter have literally spent billions fighting those constraints and they have the benefit of centrally managed hardware, networks and data stores (fun fact: a lot of reddit is powered by Cassandra - a distributed data store originally developed by FB. As you will know from using reddit - it's far from perfect despite being developed by the best minds in the industry and, in the case of reddit, being constantly looked after by sysadmins in a highly optimised and centrally managed datacentre).
I like OmiseGo and Factom because they're backed to the hilt by mature companies, and each demonstrates a very clear valuable use case. But you're right in that each needs to propagate a wider dev community to ultimately succeed.
The most important thing (for platform coins) is accessibility, not many devs want to spend the time to learn Solidity (also the applications built on ETH are for the most part terrible at this point in time). The coins I hold are mostly so I can tinker and develop on their platform, but are all striving towards making developers lives easier and providing them with incentives to develop on their platform. I would name them but I'm against shilling. 

Just my opinion but currency coins that aren't BTC will fail, except for a select few that actually serve a niche that can't be solved by side-chains.
You echo my thoughts. I hold BTC, Monero, ETH and OMG. OMG mainly due to plasma development and the team. 

We differ in ETH though. ETH does not gain additional utility by being a high value and as a matter of fact I think can lose utility if it gets to highly priced. Bitcoin however increases its utility as it increases in price. 

This is probably as my train of thought is now clearly aligned to store of value tokens, platform tokens and utility tokens so comparing the utility of ETH to BTC is like apples and oranges. 


> How might one justify holding other cryptos?

Decred is one of my long shots. The likelihood it'll actually go anywhere and gain significant adoption is small enough to almost be laughable, but it seems to have a very solid governance model and that's clearly been a big issue in many other coins. It's also a feature that cannot easily be added to existing coins (what's more likely, that a coin can add privacy or smart contract features, or that a coin can radically overhaul it's governance and reward structure?). And the devs behind it are seriously A++ (btcsuite).
Check out Factom it will be one of the few that survive the real speculation bubble.   It's already working with microsoft, mortgage companies and homeland security, it has real life value unlike 99% of the coins.     It also has amazing tech since you're a dev, fun wrapping your mind aroumd how it works. 
Eos has huge backing from big VCs and the hype is starting om their sub. Regardless what one think of their tech i think it's one of the best bets now to speculate in 
Lisk and Stratis are both great projects where they put ease of access for developers at the forefront. Especially Lisk is really trying to get those Javascript developers on board. 
Cardano is pretty sick

So is XLM

I don’t hold anythingh other than BTC, because I don’t really care about the tech of other coins, I can spin up a new public ETH net in 10 minutes, and I can do PoW on it with me and all my friends, and unless someone gets access to the genesis block, they can’t 51% attack anything.

I don’t get why we have more than one blockchain tbh
>  hold BTC, ETH & a little Monero long term.
> 
> Everything else I feel has little to zero dev community, use or substance.

Seriously? "little to zero dev community, use or substance"? Perhaps you haven't noticed #4 on coinmarketcap... you know, the coin you probably already hold without having actively done anything to acquire? It's gaining widespread acceptance (coinbase, bitpay, most exchanges, soon purse as well as many small businesses), has regular forks for protocol advancement with multiple active dev teams, a large community, and low fees. It's the coin supported by many/(most?) early bitcoin adopters, myself included.  Ever heard of it?
QRL as a hedge against quantum computing 
He should stick to shorting hair. 
am I the only one who doesn't believe this shit lol. like no one here can even understand bitmex UI. I really doubt some random barber knows how to or what shorting is
Yeah? Well I overheard two lamplighters, a chimney-sweep, and the milkman talking about how they were all in 10x at 6500 and are going to dump the market at 7200.
Bollocks
It's like when everyone was talking about buying it when it was 20k... but in reverse. :)
He shaved you!!! because he is long?
I agree. Bot trades all day is so boring 
Were there times when they were even tighter? Just looking for more context here. Thanks for the insight.
> If price recovers you can make 2-8% almost risk free.

I have been trying to understand this future / carry forward whatever strategies that are common in other markets in BTC, but isn't this the big IF here that makes it hard?
Word is it was a big short closing
Someone below showed that it was a short closing 
Nope
Perfect time to troll
Not sure what you're trying to show...
Cup and handle? 

Seeing a more realistic cup and handle on the 30min
looks like one to me.  on the other hand, all the recent pumps have had one near the top too and it didn't turn out well for them.
or, that's what they want you to think, or it's a message to other whales, or it's nothing. we just don't know
I guess you answered my question haha
Hope he gets liquidated. 
What about wanted to cover his long but then decided there's more upside to come? You'll never know.
And what if he wants to buy <7k for the last time ?
Somebody has been doing that for quite some time. Price has gone up, gone down. I really don't see any purpose besides buying him/her time to open/close leveraged position
But where are the buys? Spooked that he'll flash it again at 7? 
Some type of morse code. Count the minutes between the walls being placed and pulled and I think we may have something ;)
Remember the alt rally in January? What happened to bitcoin after that
I don't think. More the other way around. I think next alt cycle (or if it's already here) is going to be much different that people are going to be pulling out into fiat sooner. Sure that can constitute BTC buy but I don't think that will be the catalyst for a BTC run.
Hope you're right. 
> This time, we will test 8k.

Premature much?
If I hadn't hear about bottoms all the way down from 19000 I would have a lot more bitcoin at this stage.
Look. First look out for 7.2k, then for 7.8k, then there are 2-3 lines where we will probably struggle but we need to beat 11.8k . 

Last time we collided in sideways with the bear trend we dumped very hard. I don't think momentum points to that but don't get overexcited. 
Never say never.
[removed]
7.8K is THE reversal point.
Let's see.... long road to go.... but you never know in Crypto World
I smell short squeeze .... 
So far they've been pretty successful I'd say.
He’s made some really nice called off this chop. He’s long from like 6750 ish i believe for 4 million. Not sure if he’s closed or not he said his target was 7.1
Annnd it’s gone
Walls seem to act as magnets at very least in the short-medium term but my guess would be that the 100btc sells are scaling in a position and the 1K walls tend to be used to push the market into the sells/shorts. That's why the walls tend to get thicker as we approach higher levels more people want to unload at resistance. 

The whales are just scaling in positions cashing out by softening the blow with limit orders and closing a large portion of a position at a technically strong area for a bounce and to try and induce fomo the guys paying with real big money are not doing it on short time periods and the bounces we have seen recently have not really been something to give us a great amount of hope TBH. 

I find if you see walls on finex it's usually pretty safe to short it a few % above what those short sells are (depending how quickly we go up and probability of it pulling back).I'm sure they are put there to trick all the new traders to short there and get them to capitulate into their orders by putting a lot of buy pressure while scaling into their own shorts and people exit to find a better price and the momentum crescendos in some massive multiple 1K dump of spot or margin to trigger stops (that should be tight because of the overextended conditions). Prime example of this is when we went from 3K to 7.4K blow off top. It will be interesting to see how effective the dymanic works in reverse because of the limited supply of bitcoin(you do tend to see massive spikes when big round numbers with support are broken so wicking below 5K would probably trigger a lot of shorts to open and then the spring is fully loaded. 

The thing that doesn't change is it's stressful managing a volatile asset and it's really not for some people to put a decent amount in it would literally be money you would be able to burn and not worry about to some people. So I doubt bitcoin is immune to the swings and roundabouts of psychology in markets. Even when your entry price is next to zero there's still the chance that you may lose everything and I think that's something a lot of people on this sub take for 100% fact that bitcoin is guaranteed to take over banks etc whereas the reality is probably it's not going to die or replace the entire banking infrastructure but will likely work together (but mutually exclusive if thats how you want to use BTC). Immutability has features that are not always desire-able for example
This guy is been playing with his wall for a few days now, nothing new. 

What we need is people to start buying, if they want the price to go up.
I'm just gonna stop posting now. :(
>We are at resistance from 11.7k

[Not even close](https://www.tradingview.com/x/KSy4wopK/)
I don't think it's that unlikely and IF it happens it's going to be quite violent. The longer we spend down here the more shorts have piled in. IF they can't force it below this level and the market rallies above the downtrend then the shorts will be scrambling to cover. With so many shorts the rally could be very powerful in the opposite direction to the norm for a descending triangle.

edit: I've opened a 5x long at $6,800 which I will sit on until around the 17th April when I expect we will find out which way this is going to break.
it makes sense to me. supposed squeeze would complete inverse spongebob squarepants formation and get us above 7.2 lol :)

Your 1st comments were GREAT!  Then you went off into fantasy land, calling bottom based on nothing... so only reddit silver for you.

I guess if people are starting to believe we're at or near the bottom they'll be more confident with risk.

Someone posted an alternative that works with margin here earlier do a control f of bitcoin.tax and you'll find it

There have been some solid alt runs, but I think this could go either way. We are still in a bear market, if they start to show signs of weakness people will take profits in BTC and many will sell that to fiat. On the other side, if this keeps going, I could see the crowd jumping back in on another alt run which they will need to purchase BTC for
100% disagree. Alts will continue to fall against BTC for the short term. Xrp being near .50 is evidence enough of that. 
[deleted]
I once proposed this but was downvoted as an atlcoin shiller. IMO the only real use case for BTC right now is to buy alts and most real BTC buys are to purchase alts, not to invest/trade BTC. Alts have much more appeal to newbie investors, they have strong marketing, branding and announce partnership with household names. People missed bitcoin, they want to find the "next" bitcoin therefore they go for alts. 

No one is questioning BTC dominance for now, but give it a couple of years and I think bitcoin has to try really hard to stay relevant.
>People want to buy alts, not Bitcoin and that's why the BTC price is stagnant. Every BTC rise gets diluted out into the alts people want to buy.

People trading the alt/BTC pair doesn't decrease bitcoin's USD price.
If i want to buy something like, eos for example, i have to buy bitcoin (or any of the other ones with fiat pairs, but arbitrage pumps all of them so it doesnt matter) 
how far down do you think?
Agreed. Although, there is one bullish indicator that I've noticed. We've been in a rising wedge since the current descending channel met with the long-term ascending trend line which has acted as support for about 10 days now. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/msY59pCX/
This just tells me we are still a long way from capitulation. The sort of exuberant market buying EOS is seeing (driven purely by the incoming airdrop) is a perfect illustration of how fucked and irrationally optimistic sections of this market continue to be.

Why the fuck are people FOMO buying a useless token in order to receive more useless tokens? Because they assume we'll be back to a Nov-Dec 2017 buying frenzy "any time now" and they can flip for mad gainz.

Sadly for them this is not how 2018 is going to pan out. The beatings will continue with desperate refugees from the good times relentlessly being used as cannon fodder.

The alt scene in general is doing a really good job of turning me off crypto atm. Every day 90% of these projects continue to exist makes it harder and harder for me to take the space as a whole seriously (both intellectually and financially). It's just sad watching so much human effort being wasted in the naked pursuit of riches.
No it isnt
R/R favors long here, as simple as that. Don't see them being that vocal.
aaaand it's gone
Looks like he just took it down. Or he's in hiding...
1000 did run away moments ago.
Somebody gotta buy the top :)
you and me both, but I'm waiting to see if this thing pumps over 7k so I can set a good entry.
What’s your stop loss? I’m assuming right above 7.2k. What is your average as well ? 
You are in good company.
this will turn out to be a very smart Move i believe. 
Good luck.

ETH seems to be in a rising wedge almost ending no?

Except, we did have a long squeeze in December. Sure it was after we hit 20k but were you not there when the price dropped 4k in, like, two minutes on Mex? Crazy liquidation cascade. We were at 15k I think and then suddenly it just dropped to 10-something which was one of the first bottoms people started looking for. We actually had several long squeezes in December.

Edit: Just found the chart for it. It was at 14k and then dropped to 10.9 on December 22nd.
you still short from two days back?

am outta position here, have a cheeky lil 25x long from 6.5k in the futs still in play, just for kicks really. 

and i just aint shorting in this range.

still hoping for the 7.5k lol.

everybody seems to be creaming their pants over a short squeeze and i would mind one to be honest 
Is it now I should reply with a meta "how is that underwater short" post and add something about delusion  as a reference joke or are those days over ? :D
When did you turn bullish?
Which is weird because we are forming a triangle with the resistence again. Last time this happened there was a huge dump at this point.
Yes because those ... TA Guys thought it will be at 5K or even at 3K  as of today.

Because everyone watching the short term 7200 trend resistance 
there are none

look at kryll.io its quite simple for prototyping (disclaimer: its an ico and still new)
In other words, the sight of a huge wall should make you react the opposite reason the wall was put there in the first place.
the problem is he didn't elaborate on it, just said "dat daily srsi"

someone yesterday had a good post about it though pointing out that when it starts to cross in the overbought area it's time for another dump
Nothing has to happen. Resistance and support could hold us in this range for months. Shorts and longs would basically cancel each other out in that scenario. I think we'll see volitility drop and leveraged positions will gradually close out. Traders will lose interest, and accumulation will float the price up again.

Nobody knows what will happen. I think a leveraged position is a terrible position right now, though. Doesn't matter if it's long or short.
Yeah, people assume it will just go up because. I feel like right now the path of least resistance *should* be up, and since it's not going up, the market is just psyching itself up to go down.
[deleted]
You are right. Dumb money tends to buy in only when the price is near the top. 
Volume on GDAX is about as low as we've seen in ages.
dumb money went straight to alts which for now seems like the smart option. As a self proclaimed alt trader kicking myself a bit for ignoring this new alt trend, whether it be short lived or not, since I've only been paying attention to this sad BTC movement. 
Just wait till the Rockefellers, Soros, and Banks will send us to the moon to make us all rich.

Some argue that BTC is both a Giffen good and a Veblen good. This could explain a bit why the price behaves in this way
> Finally the US tax returns and wall street bonuses hitting the market!

This is the same terrible volume for a week now. What are you talking about
ATH by sunday ??
That really speaks to the lack of confidence in BTC.  Thank you.
BBands tighten. Low volitility begets high volitility. Direction is not implied. Tightening BBands are not a fractal.

This also ignores the wedge, which is a larger and more relevant pattern.
Building on that, Max pain hypothesis says price will go 7400+ to trigger stops and 10x+ shorts from sub 6800 before falling. Thoughts?
Why do people call these things fractals? 
I've been trading this fractal for a week now and so far it has been great. The short at 7150 would be my last but most risky play. Great r/r though
It's like you didn't even bother to read the wikipedia page on Elliot waves. What kind of hot garbage is this?
first its 6.92
The sell walls look exactly the same as when it was around 12480

This is what I'm seeing, ~$6950-7000 meets the downtrend resistance set by the last peak at $7170 and a prior at $7500. If bulls can't push to create a higher high then I think we'll see another sharp drop like we saw on the 9th.
Ouch... liquidated yet? 
Do yourself a favour and if your going 10x scale it in slowly. I'm expecting down but I could see close to a 10% move before that being a reality (but then again it could happen in an hour). I dont think we'll get that far and if we do it will probably fake out and resume downtrend but whenever I've done this sort of trade I tend to just about get liquidated just before the market decides to move in my direction. 
You are truly the biggest idiot here, and that's saying something.. Long w/ 15x which is ridick for me. 
Aaannd... I will be out of this trade at $6850. C'mon, baby! Make it happen! dump! If shorty can't get it there, I join the #hodlgang.  It's like knowing the winning lotto numbers in a way.

"The trouble with the market is that the bulls are cocksure and the bears are full of doubt"- Beartrend Russell
But someone closed his big short and the price shot up. All we need now is everyone closing their shorts. 
I don't think people are saying this is insanely bullish, but it isn't very bearish either. We are stuck in a twilight zone and I don't think bears or bull are very excited, it can be said however that 6.5k was defended pretty well many times so that is a positive thing for bulls. Disclaimer i'm long from 6550 and have been for a long time. Never held a position this long, should've dropped at 7.2 but i didn't expect to go from 7.2 to 6.7 in 15 minutes. 
But this time ETH pumps a 6.5% .

Fuck, Eos pumps a 20% today .
I don't do bitmex and short so all I want is a bullmarket but this is becoming less convincing of a start of one however maybe THIS IS the 2018 version of a bullrun. Slowly establishing higher lows and slowly chopping up, ignoring prior trendlines. All the top TA guys on Tradingview are constantly moving their lines and triangles to fit their narrative and leaving margins for error by saying "trends sometimes change guys" in fact I would respect them more if they say "sorry I'm just as confused so I don't know anymore"

We were supposed to be below $6K at this point since we didn't make it past $7.1K right? TA seems to be working for support and resistance but the extreme low volume is not convincing me this has legs to for the bullrun towards ATH many are hoping for. 
bullish, this time is different
We've been waiting on a new low for 8 weeks. If bears have the juice to push it down then we should see that, shouldn't we? Instead, short leverage is piling up and we're floating up on low volume.
You sarcasm is typical of not-so-smart people shorting the bottom and staying longer in denial than they are solvent. If you're a bit curious about off-the-book indicators you can see than all the shorts opening have sold into something, because the price didn't move down at all. And that those smart people buying them corns were not in a rush to incite fomo, why buy higher if people are willing to sell so low?
In a bear market you look at sell pressure... 
where? not much on gdax
What reasons do you have to think bitfinex will collapse? Ofcourse there is theter, but finex is rich as fuck. People are receiving their bank transfers as usual. They managed to survive a hack and did their best to repay customers, which shows me that they are somewhat reliable .
Tethers not going to be the reason why BFX goes down because why would you create something that is trackable when you could commit that fraud on internal databases anyway much easier. IMO they are probably one of the more trusted exchanges (along with Bitstamp). Sure the could have handled the hack better back in 2014 better but how exactly are you going to handle that situation and everyone come out a winner? They have been building the platform for big money to come in and then people get confused why tethers are created and then are wondering why there's big walls on there.

I agree that tethers create some amount of risk and could end badly but I don't think it's a scam of any kind. 
Why Bitfinex needs Tether in the first place?

Wasn't it all wash trading?

Do they need virtual USD to move numbers on their own exchange?

It's all just numbers on the buy/sell order book. No one would complain if the numbers go up and down. So why they are so stubborn with this Tether thing. Amatures!

Wait a minute, maybe... maybe the plot twist is that it's actually backed by real money.

And why would Bitfinex introduce DAI stablecoin to its own exchange that directly threatens USDT monopoly.

Seriously, guys, if you're worried about USDT and holding some on Bitfinex - just convert it to DAI.

> or this person has the owner's balls under complete control.

Or, they like money.
If your plan is to buy at 9k only to see it collapse at 10 it's not a very good plan sorry to say. Buy low, sell high. By opening a long between 6.6 and 6.8 you could already have a stop at breakeven, where is the risk?
Did you lose all your indicators or just the volume?

In general as of late the ETHBTC ratio tends to mirror BTCUSD, so you get a multiplying effect on ETHUSD.  I've been trading ETHUSD off BTCUSD charts.
The trick is to long with USD as the underlying.
You shouldn't be driving and trading anyway.

We're coming up on an intersection from the downward trend channel from March 3 and the upward trend from Nov-17. Considering we haven't been able to break above the March trend line, but the November trend line has served as solid, rising support I think it's a toss-up which way it will break. 

That being said, without a significant infusion of volume, the chances of a bullish breakout are fairly slim.

It will either fractal and dump hard or break long term resistence and pump hard. So be careful .

One short squeeze coming up....
yea they should short just like my uber driver 
makes sense 
Hope springs eternal. Just don't get too high on it, it can lead to homelessness.
this one is significantly longer and more intense. 40% correction last year, this one has hit 70% and is hovering at 65% for weeks...

last summer it went from 60% ATH to ~95% in like one day at the end of the correction.
It's not always all black/white. What about a retrace to 8k, and a drop to 5.8 for example?
You're pretty fast to change your doombear attitude 
i have to disagree. you say it’s either ATH or doom, but there are limitless other possibilities that are way more likely in the short term
I think more range bound 6500-7k for a few days/weeks
Lol bulls are NOT euphoric. 
Brb, need to liven things up, going to go outside and watch some grass grow or maybe some paint dry.
please tell Bogdanov
Nice timing. 
So your saying it could go either way? Brilliant!
Alternatively: lots of money flows from alts into btc during bear markets. As market sentiment improves btc flows back into alts. Not necessarily puppet masters just market forces.
I'm sorry, but that sounds like a desperate plan.  Just dump. Come to papa. Gimme those sweet, sweet dollars! I'm short, baby, for the very first time, and it feels goood!  Gimme money. Eff Buttcoin.
>On top of that the 100dma and the 200dma are about to cross, for long term trend trades that is a big short sign.

Isn't it more of a sign that you should have opened a short 100+ days ago?


I would consider 5k range much bigger support than some people anticipate, previous ATH's always proved the biggest supports throughout 2017.
Is it still mooning? My gut tells me it's the reason why Coinbase announced ERC20 token support, and the gains are insider trading prepping for the news.
> it's really uncanny

But it's not.
Why is Longs vs Shorts the focus now?

Would movements in the ratio have prevented bitcoin from following its huge pump/crash/deadcat/continue bear pattern at any point along the way?

If not why are they now driving the market?
Flash fear. Accumulate. 
It's called spoofing, look it up my friend.
longs peaked at ~33k, shorts were all the way down to 8k. The main reason for that insane rise was mainstream FOMO with spot buys though
1H RSI favours taking profits and potentially opening a small short here.
If we are indeed near the end of the downtrend, my only regret is not being able to see the majority of the alts go to 0. 

There are some really good and legit projects out there, but I am pretty convinced that the majority are simply created as a way for the founders to siphon money out of the cryptomarkets. And it wouldn't surprise me if someday it was revealed that some of these exchanges have been paid by crooked altcoin founders to wash-trade and pump those coins, just so that the founders themselves can unload their huge blocks at a high price to unsuspecting buyers. 
I'm seeing a lot of rule 3 violations with this account. consider taking a break on the submit button, or filling these thoughts of yours out a little more.

Please don't make me record another rule 3 violation.
Based on.....
Think about what would happen to alts if btc went sideways for a year though 
It's like that on Binance too. $30 movements at best. Like it's saying 'does anyone else want to short me'?

If there happens to be 15 year olds on here posting and learning T.A props to them. They are doing something useful with their lives. Majority of teenagers are off smoking weed in the woods with no ambition to make money/ work ethic.

Downvotes only have the importance you give them, but in my experience blaming the audience for why they aren't responding well to you doesn't teach you to be a more effective communicator.
[removed]
Every attempt to drop the price is met with a lot of buys.  I don't see this dropping yet.
I haven't downvoted you either time but the problem is that based on this there's only specious evidence for your claims. Also most of the big pump this morning came from a single short closing.
What kinda trades would you like me to make with this "helpful and relevant" information?
100 btc is a "wall"?
could be a trap also. have seen huge walls get eaten into only for the price to drop significantly below the wall price. all games....

I think the site you are pulling that from is inaccurate.  Check some other places.  If the hashrate were down that much blocks would be much slower.  It would represent a serious issue for Bitcoin if this were actually true (it isn't).
How did you even assume that this is remotely correct?
If anything, less miners = less BTC sold to cover costs.

Because we need to keep the bulls from expressing themselves, apparently. Every bear gloats, calls names, offers no argument beyond, "derp, bear market, teh bitcorns is ded!" yet they never get deleted. People like me tell you what's actually going on (Big Shorty's running outta coins) and get deleted for it. It's almost as if Big Shorty paid the mods or something. All of this is being recorded. People might get sued.
Yup!  It's possible... but if all other bubbles are an indicator, a break from the $20k downtrend will spawn a health rally (guestimates are $12k - $14k).  We could then slow bleed back to $3k - $5k range as you suggest which would mirror 2014.

2014 was a weird year however.. basically 2 bubbles back to back followed by massive disruption in the space (Mt. Gox) while it was all still feeling very new.  If you check out [moonmath](https://www.moonmath.win/), you'll see that 2014 was both the peak and nadir of BTC's historical log growth path.  

I expect this cycle to be slower and more stable that those preceding it.  Of course, only time will tell. 
Well you may still be correct... and I think it's still better to short tops in this environment... all that being said.. we're pretty far under 200EMA  

I have fiat on the sidelines in the event of another capitulation movement 
Yeah, and a few can be shorted on Kraken too, but not many. And mostly the ones that can be shorted appear to me to be unperforming, with the possible exception of EOS (don't know if NEO can be shorted or not).
I get the criticism. There were plenty of head-fake rallies from the end of January to now. But, the difference, I submit, is that after ETH began to tank those rallies were mostly tightly coupled with the BTC movement. I'm saying that's no longer the case for *select* alts which for the most part can't be shorted.
this is what i was thinking.. and it makes sense 
Well aware, they were still helpful, though, as tech people tend to be.

Playing it safe. Price didn't hit my expected target within the established time frame, so felt it best to get out.

Do bots need to be restarted after it comes back up? Because it's back up and the bots still aren't doing anything.

The upside for bears doesn't look very good to me. It's a a lot of risk for move through a region of high support.

Realistically, we probably go sideways/up for a much longer period than I show here.
Weird. WTF

it shook me so damn hard, I had tetherd at 7.5k and was waiting for hit it to break through it. I was like wtf.
Thanks for the response. Suppose I do 1. Why would I then sell the coins to work the price lower? So that I can accumulate more OTC?

Looks like this could only be done by sophisticated players with a very bullish outlook on BTC. I wonder how much of this theory is just us getting our head wrapped around in this stagnating period...

Depends on how you're trading.
These particular walls have been up for a few days now, so as a trader it makes more sense to trade with them on the short term with the assumption they're not going to get moved right away.  

Wait until price reaches sell wall and then drops, place a long entry and sell once it climbs back up towards wall. 
In general, I agree with your point about trading with walls being very time sensitive.  I don't typically try to make these types of trades, but these particular walls have been up for days and are coming from one specific trader so I felt more confident using them to scalp.

Those things ain't new, maybe they affected the price already?
My bullish case for crypto long term depends on the fact it is more profitable for the whales to market up than down.
I never had it for wires until now.
both of you have a solid plan IMO. Since no one knows what will happen, either one of you could be right. That’s why risk management is so important
2 inches down on the 5 min chart. Too much downwards blood pressure. No potential to go long after that squeeze.

Delta is the net difference between market orders at the bid and the ask. Basically I am saying lots of people were using market orders to sell compared to buyers. But if everyone is selling why isn't price going down. Because limit orders are eating up all the shorts.  Downward movement was not going to be possible as long as those limit orders remain. 
Look, im a simple man, i just want to hear the screams of the damned, and dank shitposts. 
> alts will trail... it's not a bad place for accumulation 

I'd be careful with that. If last summer is any indication, alt ratios can go a heck of a lot lower.

The script doesn't need admin privileges, PowerShell does to allow you to run ANY scripts that are not signed. Once you allow PowerShell to run local scripts you can run this in user mode. It only reads in a .csv and puts a .csv out, if you understand PowerShell at all.
 It measures the speed and change of price movements. Meaning that if we are in a range for a long period of time, say 6700-6750 a price change to 6900 in terms of average ups and downs is a big movement for the rsi. It measures momentum relative to previous price changes basically. Maybe someone can clarify better than me. Good luck!

Edit: check this out for more info https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/technical-analysis/technical-indicator-guide/RSI

Edit 2: don't let the terms overbought and oversold fool you, this indicator does not take into account volume
Overbought is relative to the time period you use to define it. For example, if you change the default (14) to 28, it's no longer considered overbought. Since many people (and probably bots) use the default parameters, I think it has relatively reliable predictive value.

Regarding volume, I agree that indicators in general are probably less helpful and predictive when it is low, but what else is there really?

Yeah, I can recall reading in the BTC whitepaper how he promoted "shorting BTC to become filthy rich" :D :D :D
This is literally their plan falling into place wonderfully, expect bull run shortly😂
My thoughts and position exactly. Still have my cold storage but have a decent amount of my trading funds in fiat and the rest in a 3x short from 7k. My guess is if we break down below the red line it hits 6k fairly quickly and bounces back to retest the red line as resistance then heads towards low 5000s 
If crypto becomes half the price I’m moving there and getting massively rich seeing as how there aren’t any laws on incoming capital only outgoing and I am eligible for citizenship already so I hope you’re right.

It’s not really possible to be cheaper because rich Koreans could use crypto to get around those archaic capital control laws from the Asian crisis in the 90s.

I'm sure they'd be able to work out how to short as well. :)

>  it when it was ~~20k~~ 11k




exactly.
Cant chart probably atm, on mobile now. But from my memory they were often tighter before the ridiculous bullrun. Can look it up in the evening when im back to my pc.
Yeah I don't get that "risk free" part...
If you're not leveraged then it's a guaranteed return.  Let's say right now you go short on finex at $6932 and at the same time buy the same time buy the June future at $6839.  That difference between $6932 and $6839 is guaranteed profit no matter which direction the price moves - be that up, down or sideways.  

The main risk here is opportunity loss for even more profit should the price move dramatically while your money is tied up in the carry forward move - although you may only be willing to risk a tiny amount of your stack on speculative trading while you can trade a much larger amount on the carry forward trade since it's guaranteed profits.  This leads us to the other risk here which is counter-party risk and thus why the OP included the "if you trust the exchanges" caveat.
You can also lock in the future discount by buying the future and selling spot, it's an arbitrage trade, no risk *if* you have enough margin not to get liquidated and you trust the exchanges. Or just trade the interest rates (futures have an implied interest rates), but interest rate trades are arguably harder to execute profitably than "simple" naked shorts/longs. The risk is lower though. When someone writes in this forum that they go "long swap short futures" it's exactly such a type of trade (interest rate).
the downside is limited. you lose 1-2% in fees and funding rates.

I took off my bear flare since I am this price action that doesn't seem overly manipulated and I might begin to DCA in but the decreasing volume has to be concerning for those looking to break major support above 8k region. I mean if this can't break 7.2K after several tries then the lower high is validated and who knows what will happen next.
That trend line is currently at ~8900, so if we break through the current descending channel, we should retest that resistance at ~8500-8600 in a week or so. Big if. I don't see a lot of buying pressure at the moment. And now that Chad is apparently learning how to short, it could get even more difficult.
doubt it
and if your wrong you can say the same thing tommorow, then the next day and the next !~
12k is the reversal point
Want to be breaking the descending resistance from ATH before I would get too excited... Currently at 8.75k
the further down we go, the less chance of a successful short. A lot more people are willing to buy btc at $5k than they are at $10k. 
The last 13k so hace not unless they scalped...
JINNNNNNX!
> IF they can't force it below this level and the market rallies above the downtrend then the shorts will be scrambling to cover. 

or they get brave when it does break down, double-down on the guaranteed free money, *then* get rekt.
The reason I say its unlikely is that the funding for shorts is still quite good and buyers REALLY have to show up in order to break out of this wedge, which I kind of doubt they will
[deleted]
Haha yeah I don't usually like to call bottoms but hey, imagining is free
Well, sideways movement, no significant volume until some whale decides "fuck it market buy 500-1000 BTC" is my loose definition of illiquid. Then it stagnates for 4 hours hovering around a certain price. Maybe illiquid is the wrong word in this case. But the only significant volume comes from these whales for now. IMO
Oh, well someone should message the reddit admins
how have I never thought of this
But you can't modify the CSV file from poloniex or else it won't import correctly, so how did you successfully add this information???
I don't see anything here in the daily?
I mean I get you, but you could have worded that a bit different.
> the only real use case for BTC right now is to buy alts

So then what's the use case for alts?

And just because *you* don't use BTC for anything else doesn't mean other people aren't. It's not like I'm gonna buy my drugs with cash afterall.
I've always wondered this. If someone bought BTC and then immediately put that BTC into an alt wouldn't it have a positive effect on the BTC price (obviously the alt price as well). Would buying the alt with BTC have any impact on the USD price of BTC?
Isn’t that a falling wedge?
"Sadly this is not how 2018 is going to pan out" 

Nothing personal, but some of the certainty around here feels quite arrogant indeed.

It's entirely possible that Bitcoin has found a low and that the market as a whole can begin recovering. That is easily a possibility - it would be fairly stupid to discount it entirely. In addition to simply finding the low, Geopolitical turmoil has historically been bullish for BTC... and current events with Syria/Russia could add fuel. 
Nope. This is "flight to quality" people have been waiting for. EOS has a 1.375 billion dollar VC Fund behind it. It does 3000 tps at launch, has its own constitution, and has a gigantic community. You can lock up the token for bandwidth on the chain, and it's an airdrop target for the VC-funded project, ensuring that people hold it. This is the sign of rationality returning to the market and things being price appropriately. I'm sorry but does LTC have a billion dollar VC Fund? Oh no it's "silver to bitcoins gold." Well it's crap. Ripple is crap. ETH got killed by cryptokitties. I agree with you that BTC is underpriced compared to rest of market but EOS gaining market share is a sign of health 
... or the market is recovering
> exuberant market

This is the real heart of the matter. Feels like something shifting, but everyone rekt enough? Probably not.
People should be careful; look at what happened to NEO right after getting pumped for the ONT airdrop. NEO almost rebranded back to Antshares. (Disclaimer: I stole this joke from someboy in here. Can't remember who.)
I have to disagree.  Alts are the best thing about crypto, and there are plenty of good projects out there with EOS being one of them.  Last year was ridiculous, and yes most of those projects should and will die, but the alt funding mechanism will completely change VC funding, liquidity in private equity, asset transfers etc etc.  Bitcoin may have provided the framework, but alts is where the mainstream adoption, and true disruption will come from. 
Could you do me a solid, and quantify this R/R I'm hearing about? Seems very anecdotal - overall trend is still very much in charge
Someone market buy 100 BTC to see if it's hidden. Then we can all pool our money and take it down LOL
Yeah my aim is to get my second half in by 7k on June futures which will coincide with 7.1 or so on spot. 
No hard stop loss. Realistically might not give it up till 7.3
Yea shorting with the herd lol 
Who knows tho they may be right 
Thx
what timeframe?
Not in position anymore 
it's a sarcastic take on the "muh short squeeze" posts. which will be heavily mocked if $6k breaks down 
no they didn't 
Did you finish yours?
Oh I agree - the one that was removed was not a quality post and needed to be cleaned up. Do you have the other one handy?
The fact that we’re struggling so much to get back above the 6.8-7k range seems quite bearish to me. Didn’t we just get rejected by 7.6 and 7.2? I wouldn’t even think about being slightly bullish until we broke through those zones.
The post is primarily just quoting things people have said around here, so I doubt it...
... And sells the bottom. All the volume we've seen over the last 8 weeks is the exit of dumb money and smart shorts, IMO. The fact that volume is drying up right now is very bullish.
I went to sleep and woke up to the same exact price on GDAX. Have never seen that happen before.
you could had bought verge! 

Besides alts to get bought usually need to buy bitcoin first so they are buying bitcoin. 
You dropped your /s, here you go.

/s
Maybe they become better at playing the market though?
that was the joke
Do you have any updated projections for us?
This should be possible but if we go too high fomo will ensue and a retest of the longterm beartrend/ correction would follow. Unsure if bears would allow that to happen but as  always bulls and bears alike wants to trap their respective counterpart as much as possible before the slaughter begins.
https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fractal.asp
Those elliot waves (hot garbage) youre refering to is to indicate a pattern that is the same ish thus one can assume that if the price pattern were to continue then a breakdown would occur. 
Interesting. What are your current thoughts on this?
Usually big volume, up or down. Last time nothing happend so everyone just moved that line a little further lol.  
It's a major resistance that we will either be rejected at or smash through. Definitely an area to be cautious.
Add a i believe at the beggining of it and you get how a big part of the market feels
There is, however, *sentiment* in this post.
He's probably one of those commies using the metric system, they sometimes forget how to use commas correctly
blocks per 10 mins are more than 1 too, so it doesn't look hash-rate dropped:

24 hours 	163 (6.79/hr) 
2 weeks 	2157 (6.42/hr) 

from: https://fork.lol/
apparently it's an issue with the site not the hash rate.
That graph is completely wrong lol
6750 +/- with a stop at 7150.
I chickened out with a very small loss just in the nick of time.
I don't know man. I don't see a downtrend, but I do see someone who likes to dump lots of coins now and again, and I'm just guessing they will dump more soon.  If they do, i win.  If they don't, oh well,  I'm in it for the Bitcoin.  
Maybe so, cowboy. But I'm playing with house money.  How about you? New to this?
Underrated comment
I'm a fan of EOS, hate all you want but I bought low, sold my initial and am hoping its forming a giant up and handle on the btc pair
they announced an airdrop to EOS holder...
Saying we should be below 6k just because we didn’t hit 7.1 is nonsense. The RSI was heavily oversold and needed to take a breather on all timeframes. They’re all pretty much reset now to a point that would allow another major dumping, and with each pump less convincing and not reaching previous highs, it’s not looking promising that we’re in a reversal here. If we can push over 7.2-7.8 convincingly, with volume and hold the position, that would be a decent indicator. These crappy 100-150 dollar pumps are just not it. Bear in mind a few weeks ago we pumped from around 8k to 8.6 in a matter of an hour or two. Everyone was excited by that pump, and within a couple of days we had another major dump on our hands.

It’s still too close to call.
Thank god for the kraken whale that saved us from going under 6500.
I think it's just really impossible to tell until we've started testing some of these large descending triangles. luckily that will be soon and we'll get some more indicators.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/A7H0QGTD/
> short leverage is piling up and we're floating up on low volume.

What kind of indication is this from your perspective?
/s
1. Can you send fiat directly to Bitfinex and back? As far as I understand the only option is Tether.

2. They survived a hack alright. Not giving any details on how the hack became possible and not sharing any investigation details. Like 0 info.

3. They did a haircut of 30% and continued. That was a clear case of insolvency and while it's good people got part of their money fast (unlike with Gox) the idea that you can just cut 30% of your user's funds and get away without any repercussions does not instill confidence, to put it lightly.

4. I'm in disbelief someone actually holds 5k on Bitfinex. That's just common sense. Have you seen these kinds of walls on ANY other exchange?
I sold at 11.
Ok, after your question I got that I need to find it to add it as a separate indicator, and there it was.  Thank you!

Can you elaborate - what's the trick? In a bear market, I understand the goal is to gain more fiat, but in the long run, we all want more BTC, ain't it?
LoL
Speak for yourself. I'm still in bed.
[deleted]
Didn't know that was a thing.
So, long futures and short swaps with 5% stop loss in both directions ? :D
So it could go up or down...of course we need volume to push higher

Scintillating 
None of those options are csv files, most are quicken or some specific company.
Well, I just chickened out and exited so have at.
No im just shocked. Like, what kind of idiot would not sell after a 10% pump.

A idiot who would had lost a lot of profits...

expecting it to go down a good 20% or so but still it's very impressive seeing that.
Possible but unlikely considering the massive profit taking from longs that would occur at major resistance levels like 7.2, 7.5, 7.8
let's see if the 15m does a bart or not :D
>what are different time frames and price anchoring

yes
Pro tip: make sure to figure out in your head what the alternative scenario is for when the market goes against you. 
Honestly no idea how to feel about this alt run
technical analysts in disbelief 
Not for trend traders, you're thinking of psychic traders
Could be but 5k was ath for like 3 weeks, do see it as anything significant 
up 30% today. Maybe they're pumping it with all the money they got from crashing ETH?
How is it not? Same patterns forming inside a falling wedge that is similar to the one from december to february. Several post above are also mentioning this fractal.
> Why is Longs vs Shorts the focus now?

Uh... it's a trading sub?  I'm a bull in the long-term, but if I can put a few extra satoshis in my pocket now and then by riding a short Im gonna do it all day long.
They're not- it's just something this sub has latched onto lately, really. The ratio is far more important than simply the number of shorts open 
> Would movements in the ratio have prevented bitcoin from following its huge pump/crash/deadcat/continue bear pattern at any point along the way?

I heavily weight the ratio and funding rates as the "cause" for lost momentum in the end. Besides all the other reasons.

There were only a few people paying attention to it at the top though, it really got out of hand and was the only thing happening there for a bit. Then eventually people noticed after panic set in and now at the "bottom", everyone is paying attention to it. 

So.. Yeah sure, more down possible against the potentially "delusional" (in hindsight) sentiment.
The chart looks so shit that people look for something to justify a bull move
The market generally moves _towards_ liquidity zones where there is a lot of coins in the book. So usually the market moves _towards_ the walls. Usually ;)
So, if you see that you would be thinking long, right?  Ride the whale's coat tails?
Thanks, I needed some clarity.
Even if it were proven, that's not illegal. Immoral sure but in the wild west anything goes.

As far as alts, the opposite is actually happening; there are more shitcoins born everyday.
And $2000 up in six months says... 
Draw lines on charts and make up numbers that have significant meaning to the future market movement.
Cuthuthu in his house in ry'la is dreaming
Rich people can't math.
It's how some of them became rich
It wasn't exactly meant to be a very bearish statement.
lol, do you really feel that the bears are "delusional" right now? We have lost 65% of our all time high in a couple months. What you are saying is literally like a NASDAQ-100 holder in March of 2001 saying "delusional bears we are just about to moon back to 4500 any time." Only NASDAQ didn't have a literal cult supporting it, and was supported by actual value unlike BTC. 
I have enough faith in this community to think that all those postings would be downvoted to hidden by default.
Glad that you are willing to admit that it is a false construct.
Agreed. It's not about controlling opinions. It's about keeping out the chimpanzees who want to scream and throw shit. Unlimited freedom of speech 100% of the time is a poorly-designed rule. Easily exploited by attackers. If people would take off the ideological blinders for two seconds and think about it, they'd immediately see it. 
Downvotes only serve to hide the community from engaging in the comment.  I get upset when I post something that I, as a trader, would have liked to have visited the daily and seen.  When it's relevant information, truthful, and actionable, it's idiotic to downvote it and hide it from the thread.  

But this thread hasn't been about an exchange of useful information for a while now. 
Since the Dec. bullrun, this thread has become about confirmation bias and ego-stroking.  
[removed]
Really?
Because it's pretty easy to watch in real-time as it happens.
In fact, there are lots of readily available tools that will show you particular chunks of buy / sell orders and tell if you if they're from one source or multiple.

One example of such tool (this one focuses on GDAx's order books) is linked here:
http://whales.cracklord.com/

I've been posting in this daily for almost two years at this point and it has never been more toxic and shitty than it is now.  Any time I come and post relevant information I get downvoted to oblivion, but if I link some asinine TradingView chart I drew some lines on with my dick that gives a bunch of random prices and shitty predictions I get 30 upvotes.  
Except this hasn't been a one-two hour play.  This has been going on for multiple days at this point.  I'm personally taking it as a very bullish sign because they clearly would like to see the price fall much further off their sell walls but they can't get it lower than $20 a coin below.  It's been very easy to scalp small longs, earn the maker fee plus the funding rebate and sell once it gets close to the wall price again.  


With the amount of trades on margin, that's THE game right now.

EOS DAC AirDrop on the 15 th..
I'm not so sure we found the bottom yet but we're due for a little bounce imo
I guess so i didnt realise saying manipulated would cop so much slack
Thats what i meant by random, one was coming but who knows what direction.
You're absolutely right. I checked some other sites and the drop only shows on blockchain.info
Well there are still 12.5 BTC coming into existence roughly every 10 minutes regardless of how many miners there are, so the supply will remain the same.
Promise! London soon ;)

No, but i think if a known moderator of this sub opens a new one, we know it is trustworthy. If they can regain control, nothing is lost.

What's interesting is that we seem to have hackers attacking bitcoin VIA things like exchanges and social media to possibly try and effect price. When we were closing in on 12K BFX went through a coordinated attack and I'm fairly sure that exchanges likely had some sort of DDOS attack when we seemed to go into FOMO mode in that final run up from 5.4K to 20K (possibly to fuck with traders). I find it unlikely that exchanges were that unprepared (and they all seemed to go down at the same time which is just not likely) and the PR perspective was likely that it was due to demand because that's hiding their incompetence. There seems to be a few crucial price points where there seems to be something sketchy happening with exchanges. Maybe it's just coincidence but it seems so sketchy.
I don't mean to be unkind to /u/yum_kaax. I myself have been accused of fabricating a story in connection to coinbase, but /u/memorydealers is notorious for sockpuppeting and using shill accounts and /u/yum_kaax is unusually slanderous of r/Bitcoin in an unrelated post about gdax and price movements.
Sideways/up for longer is the perfect DCA. If only those bbands were tighter.
I agree with this outcome as the most likely. Slightly up. 
Correct.  And I don't think Andy Hoffman is onto anything with his tweet.  I think he was just sort of joking about the price action really.

The idea is that there are big sophisticated bulls moving into this space who are looking to build long term holdings at the lowest price possible.  Building a $1B position to hold long term might only represent 0.5% of some of these portfolios, but it is a huge amount of money in this space as it currently exists and it's not easy to buy that kind of size without moving the price, even if you DCA.  I don't know to what extent that is happening, but I do believe there is some of that happening.  I do believe there is a lot of money not looking to buy for a quick flip, but looking to build a large long term base position to mostly hold, but trade around as well.

4/11, the day whales collude to break this stalemate one way or the other during the downtime.
Just because you don't like it? All the things I said are true, are they not? And are we not in a downtrend? What a poor reply.
I think that's his point. that it's not really crazy we have so many shorts open 
Don't have to be new. We are down 28% this month, 60% this year. Shorting is the most logical course of action until we have a confirmed reversal.
whales are just bigger sheep.

They certainly can ... but certain alts have been decimated, while others are holding some medium ratio still.. I'm only accumulating those well below the waterline that seem to hold some promise.
So its safe to use its increasingly useless the lower the volume goes.

It's too early for me to deal with daftness
Longers hate HIM, found out why here
Yep got my long entries in all in 3x 5200-5K stop below 4650 and short target a little higher since I'm assuming below the 5400 and around the 5K high. I seen MagicPoopCannons latest TV idea(I very rarely look at these, they keep notifying me via my browser but I click them and they aren't links for some reason - Link: https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/WYODzAEC-Bitcoin-Flags-Out-Continuing-The-Pattern-BTC/) and it aligns as to how I see it playing out. 

I'm not convinced that we'll see 3-4K yet will most likely bounce from 5K pretty strongly and retest the ATH downward trendline. If it plays out I'll hedge the dowtrend line and short the breakdown. The only thing I think is that this could take longer to play out right until it breaks down below 6K and hopefully see some capitulation candles with a clear bottom for at least a fair bit of upside like a rally to 9200 would be perfect. 

I'm not super comfortable in my position atm (I've been in it since that last major drop) with this slow grinding and being in fiat. I think I can get a better entry but when it decides to move it looks like it should move fairly damn quickly and I'm not ready to spend 20 hours a day staring at a barely moving chart again. I'll watch it 7200 to 7500+ and below 6600 to 5K. 


That's not what I was thinking of exactly, but they link to it. azop stability charts is what I had in mind. Thanks for remembering better than I lol
See my edit.
I have and it was alright, but I would much prefer to write in a long established language (mainly for the superior tooling available), even more-so one that I already know and work with regularly. While it's certainly easy to get into to, it is still a time sink and from my conversations with other developers, one that isn't worthwhile considering the current state of the tech. The biggest drawback for me though is that you can't update smart contracts. Other chains have already worked out an "evolving" contract system, the inability to do so seems like a major drawback to ETH in the future (massive bloat on the chain and broken contracts hogging resources). Not sure if they are working on anything to solve that though.
You missed the regardless of tech part i see 
dude, ur an ETH shill in r/Bitcoinmarkets
Exactly my point. No idea why this gets downvoted. 
Did you sell your ETH or something? I remember you from our sub.
Cardano is already way sicker than Ethereum

Caradno already exists. They have a client and a wallet. Do your research

So around September.

Plasma is this year, Sharding stage 1 is in 2019.
yeah, we agree it will be many years before it's a problem. 

The problem is the vast number of ETH or BTC or w/e cryptocurrency that are held in wallets with known public keys that may not migrate to wallets that adopt the QR signature scheme if/when those get implemented.

When the private key is cracked by someone with a quantum computer, they will likely be sold off quickly, at the very least creating a liquidity crisis and maybe irrationally affecting market confidence beyond that.
so you're admitting this anecdote is retarded?

my point isn't that barbers are dumb or incapable but that it's a silly anecdote haha. any barber that can figure out bitmex isn't an idiot 
I agree and like  it, but it's overwhelming at first 
Maybe "least risky"?
#truth
BIRD is the word
How do you know? There are people in this small sub that still have shorts open from above 10k. Why wouldnt there be whales that are in the same position? 
Hey man, chill. 
The buying was frantic before the wall showed up.
Lol really you saved my comment to spite me later
The more times we test this support the weaker it becomes. 
Primary difference being that we have been in a clear bear market 
 for months now and our bounces keep getting weaker.
For a bear market break out i consider the horizontal one much more important. Particularly after bouncing 5 times from it (2 bounces up, 3 bounces down) .

And still the amounts of "normies" on crypto it's pretty low anyway, although bigger in some countries like the netherlands or the USA:

Oh, almost forgot. that trendline changes a lot depending on how you draw it, so for me it will be something to confirm after the breakup or the bounce down. 
There are various to look for. They arent exact, but 7.2, 7.8 8.4 9.2 10.4 11.2 are the values i Will look for
if that were true would we not be above $7.5k right now..? 
Well I thought I put an order in to sell at $7000 as a test but it went through.  I'm clearly not getting this.  I will read some more.  Cheers.
Hah all good, fun to guess at it.  But for real, your comments on whales is 100% spot on - the plumbers and lawyers of bitcoin are long gone and it's really just the long term HODL'ers and whales left.  Whales playing liquidation games daily, it seems.  So I agree with you all day on that.
the points is from the daily chart we've been here for ages, from there this region is very liquid
Waiting their reply now
I was not able to use the CSV file for anything other than the raw data.  To make life easier I sorted the columns by type and cut out only the margin data (it's labeled "Margin Trade") in the spreadsheet Poloniex gives you.  Then went through that manually by date and took note of each trade.  It was a massive pain in the ass. 
u/cyoreligion has it above..maybe it was yesterday's ...

Alts are proposing a myriad of use case in shiny advertisment and marketing packages. To normal investors that's appealing. Take Tron for example. People buy Tron when they see it advertising on the fucking times square. Bitcoin is that fancy digital money that some people got rich from and criminals use it
 That's the public view of Bitcoin. Most alts don't have that baggage
Buying the alt with BTC has no impact on the USD price unless the person who sold the alt then trades that BTC for USD. Same with selling the alt for BTC.

And yes, if you have USD and want to buy an alt, it positively effects BTC if you go through the BTC/USD pair to get to the ALT/BTC pair.
I was referring to alts, not BTC. My wet dream is that we have a brutal, year long bear market to clear out all the snakeoil, reset expectations and then BTC enters a multi year bull run (with spurts of large gains and longer periods of slower gains) culminating with it reaching a similar price volatility to gold with the added bonus that you can also use it for fast, cheap value transmission (thus rendering paypal, travelex, moneygramme etc. useless and ushering in a new age of micro payments that will reduce the advertisers' strangle hold on the web).

For me that covers about 95% of what the crytpo revolution needs to do. The other 5% being left for very specific, limited dapps / smart contracts where a blockchain (but not BTC based) approach might make sense. 
Recovering to what? Another speculative hype bubble with no underlying substance? Great...

Edit: and you have to ask yourself: what's changed since Feb to encourage and enable the tidal flood of new money and retail interest necessary to fuel "bubble 2.0"? I'm not sure EOS pumping for 24hrs due to a worthless airdrop and BTC not taking a shit is what's going to incite a new epic wave of FOMO buying.
There is very little evidence we can break 6.5k as it has proven solid and all the shorts need to cover, many do so after a few % gains. So that's a 6% move at best.

A move up has little resistance between 7.2 and 8.4, and arguably the number of shorts covering could easily propel us above 7.2

Aaand just as I wanted to count and point how thin the bfx sell order book is vs buy order book, it went offline. But it's like 1 for 3.

Watching on [Kraken](https://imgur.com/a/pt4Oy) 
I'm being sarcastic too man! The post is counter intuitive. 19K in Dec and so many longs, price dropped. 6.8K in April and so many shorts, price???
I’ve had a market maker bot for a while.

I have a very basic arb bot

I had a “buy the fucking dip” bot, but that actually started losing money after Jan/Feb.

None of these are really profitable, so I shut them off. I was making good money back in Nov Dec, especially with the arb bot since GDAX was 1k EUR above Kraken.

Now I have no bots.

If you want a bot trading the market using multiple signals, you’re going to need to read a couple books.

At some point is like delaying the inevitable. Just like i think the december bull run should have ended at 11.8K and was only propelled by fomo, i think this bear run should have ended by now but is also propelled by fomo with the shorts and the sells and waiting for a lower point of entry. 

This has two readings, people miss their entries and leave and shorts get squeezed to low 8ks at most.

Or people fomo in because their buys didn't got filled, shorts get squeezed, nobody sells and we are in a bull run again. 

The second seems more likely given the nature of bitcoin, but betting on that as guaranteed is a recipe for disaster.
Why is it bullish that there is no volume?  I'm not being argumentative just genuinely interested.
Not necessarily. A lot of altcoin holders have hands of titanium so they may have swapped or been in tether. However I do understand what you're saying.
Thank you, wondered where it went.

Have a short from 8850 that wanted to close yesterday around 8750 but never went there (kraken). Will let it ride a while more to try at least breaking even. Thanks 
Who the fuck says i hate EOS? I think it is very overvalued in its BTC ratio, but hey, as a bitshares fan (which has proven much more than EOS and that doesnt have to compete with ETH in the near future, nevermind the crash [thanks god i bought more or less at the current price]) this is just beneficial since they share same technology, base team, community up to some point and when EOS is released the idea is to go and make the blockchains be able to interact with each other.
it didnt happen with many other airdrops. besides, dogecoin also pumped 20% and the altcoins in general are pumping really hard. Save for verge and tron, which i don't know how they are still there. 

Also i don't think the airdrop is valuable enough to be worth giving up so much to propel that run... 
I agree with you. The below 6K was not my call but that's what people bears have been saying for a while now. I'm bearish myself but more based on sentiment since I don't really follow TA. The fact is though BTC has been making lower highs with even less volume. The upside is that 6.5 has been defended so many times that I'm not really believing the double bottom theory. I respect TA but its not anywhere near accurate and if anything just a guideline that bots and whales trade off.
>kraken whale

I would love to see one of those
It indicates that shorts aren't closing. They're probably not closing because it's not profitable to close. New shorts are probably opening at an unchanged rate.
ah ok x) , it's pretty weird, there's no volume for either side, only sudden big buys or sell offs but no one follows either
I consider all exchanges to have their share of shadiness but it is what it is. I think the tether FUD is on the back of everybody's mind as is the MT Gox coins that are still out there but you have to play to win while understanding the risks. 
1. Yes I believe so
2. FBI got involved if I recall correct. They even send out a message that if the hacker returned the funds he could keep a % of it telling them how he did it.
3. The 30% got covered with a token, which some people even made more money with. It's shit to get a 30% haircut but what choice did they have?
High correlation pair, increased rollover fees per unit volatility.

Long term, both are going up, a lot.

Good luck on the ratio without insider info.

Do you know how many BTCs there are in the sell side of BFX til 8k?

Remarkable! So don't piss in the wind?
Me neither. Feels like early January when you were bummed because after going up 30% in two days your coin would be the only one down 2% before going back up 10% the next day. Maybe this is some new type of manipulation where whales stabilize btc so alts can pump, profit then dump everything. haha 
Both the number and ratio are important.  I really don't follow why the ratio would be more important honestly.

Imagine if there were only 9 BTC short and 1 long on Finex.  That ratio would be 90% short but would be totally irrelevant.  Either side could close entirely without any slippage.  "Max Pain" or whatever wouldn't matter at all.

Now imagine if there were 900,000 leveraged shorts and 900,000 leveraged longs.  The ratio is 50/50, but the situation is such that if either side begins to close that volume will basically be all that matters.  There is nowhere near the liquidity needed to handle it so fast movement leading to stops being hit and margin calls and forced liquidations could literally obliterate the book in either direction.  So in this case the sheer size relative to the order books would matter much more than the balanced ratio.  One might hope that one side would close when in profit at the same rate the other side closes at a loss, but in reality that would be unlikely... you might even have the "winning" side opening more after the breakout exaggerating the move then causing a massive correction back the other way.

The current situation has both leveraged longs and shorts very high.  Historically it's an all time high for shorts on Finex.  Both sides are high relative to the orderbook in general.  And while most of the time leveraged longs are higher than leveraged shorts (say 60/40) right now the shorts are over 50%.... and this is after a 65% price correction which seems to have stabilized... The low for the year was over 2 months ago...  It's a unique situation.  It really looks like there has been a lot of FOMO shorting, a big bearwhale super confident in their ability to eventually crack the price lower, or there is some news which has yet to reveal itself that someone has been trading upon.  It's really set up for an explosive move one way or the other.
Thanks, just double checking!

Moderators save people time, mostly. Yes the community could downvote those things, but how long will that take? How many hours will I waste trying to wade through absolute crap before getting to useful info? As a user of this sub I appreciated mods and as a mod I see how much work it can be at times.

Also, [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory).
You're being downvoted for your asshole "I'm better than all of you and have real advice and everyone else is shit at trading" attitude.

Especially when your advice amounts to "LOOK AT DA ORDER BOOKS!! SO BULLISH!!" ignoring how quickly the order books can change and that this type of spoofing is always present. It's neither bullish nor bearish medium-long term, just the market being its normal self. Most people here trade on longer time frames than a 15 min $30 scalp.
There are a ton of underwater shorts, traders deep in the red, and people who bought at $13k+, which lots of people think we may not see again for a while. Lots and lots of newer people who are emotional and on edge.

I wouldn't take downvotes personally, sometimes you just get upset people taking issue with something small in your comment. 

This sub tends to hyperfocus on one issue and reject any other theories for weeks. See: longs/shorts right now is the hot topic that everyone thinks is driving all movement. Once the price breaks above $7.8k and shorts close or we go below $6k with shorts still at ATH, people will shut up and come up with some new conspiracy theory like Soros or something.

Just don't take it personally.

But yes, I'm getting a bit annoyed with the whole "Closed my long from $6850 at a small profit" when current price is $6910. Like...come on guys. No one cares. 
Yeah I feel you, that's why ethtrader is useless.
My point is there are regulary 200-1000BTC market buys on BFX so 100BTC is not a wall. If it wasn't eaten alive it's just that it served for accumulation to suppress the price.

And I bought at 11k and sold at 14k before beginning to trade in fiat, thanks for your concern.
Even just a simple naming of the source like this lends your point a lot more credit, I didn't see if you did in your previous downvoted posts. Also I can see you're frustrated but the negative and antagonistic tone doesn't decrease the toxicity at all. Also anywhere on reddit someone complaining about downvotes is almost always a downvote magnet.
And project release first days june..
I don’t think we go lower.

We’re about 1k above the last bottom,

1.5k above the SW2X FUD bounce

Well, its just that bitcoin has always been manipulated, its just that in this indecisive and iliquid market is behaving in this strange way.

Good point it may have been before... Maybe you mods can request reddit make this a feature you can add to the sub, make it so that any admins must have 2fa to have certain access. Not sure it would have helped in this specific situation though.
I'm pretty sure that the compromised account is unrelated to you.

I have some concern that your posts tend to stray off bitcoin Markets and have strong political bias, though.

This is a Bitcoin Market sub. I want to see you posting about Bitcoin Markets and not stirring up drama over old issues.

This is the second time I've rushed to your defense when others are attacking you, only to have that ignored. It's getting a little old.
It's not unprecedented for bitcoin to just sit, unchanging, for months. That would be a hell of a good entry for me.
I dont think shorting near the current bottom while shorts are at an all time high whilst we're in such an easily manipulated market, is the most logical course of action.
Yeah it becomes alot noisier, or if there is alot of volume in a small price range, say bulls and bears really fighting it out between 6700-6800 with alot of volume for a long time, if one wins and moves towards 7000 and rsi becomes overbought, it does not mean you should sell, cause it can stay in overbought a long time. I don't personally use it in small time frames, only 4hr -> daily for big trend decisions. It helps to average out choppy days like we've been having.

>Recovering to what? Another speculative hype bubble with no underlying substance? Great...

I think you answered your own question.

Yes, there are a lot of scam and vaporware ICO's/shitcoins.

But they're not all shitcoins, and we're seeing some real momentum with some legit projects; roadmap targets are being hit and some of them are launching products this/next quarter.

This may be where we see some actual utility to crypto beyond speculation, or at least, this is what it might look like once we do.

Thanks, appreciate your thoughts. Think 7k will need some effort to breach however, descending support from 11.7k.... But we'll see soon.
can never tell here ...

and were longs really at an ATH when we dropped..? How many times did longs hit an ath before we topped out? 
A bot for trading this chop gotta be profitable no?   
Thanks for the suggestion :)
Just about to cross as we approach two strong resistances 
It's an indication that momentum on the trend is being exhausted. Bulls aren't going to pile in before there's clear confirmation of a trend reversal, and bears are going to keep betting on the trend until there's no supply left to sell. When there's a supply shortage the market can't recognize that for a while. 

The issue isn't that the bears have oversold the asset. The issue is that a fair market value has been found and accumulation starts to happen. When accumulation starts, people are trying to buy at the lowest possible price, so they let the price drop and then gradually buy it back up. You end up with a market that rises on low volume because the buys that you see are distributed acquisitions that will make up a much larger position.
Lack of momentum. Think of a rubber ball hitting the floor. Thats what the chart looks like. Once it stops bouncing like that we can go on climbing again.
indeed we do. I bough a bit more than 1500 bitshares when they were worth a bit less than 0.06$ . Longed them to 3000+ . Didn't sold when it hit 1$. Now they are worth 0.15$ . Still really good profits but i can't say im exactly happy about it. 
I see.
First it was the line from 11k when we where at 6.8. Breakout only caused a 200$ pump followed by a dump. Breaking out of a falling wedge on the 1D you expect a 1000$ pump.

This is a different trend line now we have broken out sideways. My mistake, got it drawn too on finex but it's still 100$ before touching it
Seeing this wedge playout you will get your chance to close in profit. Also it would not supprise me if this green wedge would breakdown to 5k. Contrary, we could see a big leg up at the end because of that big falling wedge on the 1D chart. After I close this short I will wait to see what happends at the apex.
Sorry not saying that you hate it, but it gets a ton of hate in the crypto world 
It happened, price was on the verge of plummeting until a kraken whale put up a 1500 BTC buy wall
> They're probably not closing because it's not profitable to close.

I think that is obvious, what I mean is that what is your prediction based on your own TA, which direction do you see the price moving to?

My opinion, if shorts are not closing and new shorts are being opened at unchanged rate, if we get a good pump, we could see some good rise in the price. Then again, there is way to much resistance ahead, I think we need more buys than a pump. 
Yeah.. I’m on the sideline.. this could go any direction, and I don’t feel like gambling
I am pretty sure aside from the big buy and sells, this is how the current organic bitcoin market looks like. Hence the reason why I am bearish. Binance has bots on full speed right now causing all sorts of FOMO for no reason.
1. Ok, which banks does Bitfinex use? Can we get some evidence this is actually possible?

2. Bitfinex SAID FBI got involved. I haven't heard anything from the FBI. Can you prove that the FBI was involved in any way?

3. They had a choice to go through the necessary legal procedures and bankruptcy. No business should be allowed to operate if it is insolvent. That's fraud.
Yeah, I’ve been starry eyed w/ the thought of increasing my ETH stack on ratio trades but, balls of steel are necessary to ride those trends long term.  I had a good trade going from .09-.055ish but, I decided to just hold/trade more BTC just to keep myself sane.
Ya that is the cap gains file, which I have already done.   It worked great. Not the same thing as the info for the 8824 like kind exchange report generated.
order books are notoriously misleading
> the number .. could literally obliterate the book in either direction

Lots of bets placed on both sides after much side-line sitting.

> One might hope that one side would close when in profit at the same rate the other side closes at a loss, but in reality that would be unlikely... 

Fully. They're going to see profit, hodl their position into loss and cascade at some point. Both ways.

> you might even have the "winning" side opening more after the breakout exaggerating the move then causing a massive correction back the other way

For this reason I'd love to see another $1000 move down touching 6k with bottom shorters. Then the quiet before the next storm would be intense.

> The current situation has both leveraged longs and shorts very high.

Another thing about all that is many see the price depressed and think the market is "down", when really everyone (and more, and their gains from top) started taking up positions again weeks ago.

> It's a unique situation.

Starting to get thrilling, whatever happens.
The number of open positions only would matter if the order books don't reflect the liquidity necessary to handle the positions closing. Unless these are open positions with absolutely 0 reason to close any time soon, the order book should become increasingly liquid with more positions open, no?

900k shorts would mean there's 900k longs waiting to be closed. They won't all just watch 900k shorts get liquidated before closing, they'll provide liquidity on the way up. 

The only time this would really end up out of whack is if money truly enters or leaves the market with no target for re entering/leaving, no? 

Your argument is that open, leveraged positions compared to limit orders is the real important ratio, right? 

So the only time we should think about a short squeeze is when shorts are at a high relative to the order book ask side past a certain point. Yes? 
I don't think you're understanding.
I don't give a shit about the downvotes themselves, I give a shit that information which SHOULD NOT BE HIDDEN FROM OTHER COMMENTERS gets downvoted and hidden by those who have decided "I don't like this information".  The only posts that should be hidden from here are: shill posts, and off topic / altcoin posts.  
I only post information in here that I, as a trader, would like to see if I were to visit this thread.  
> I'm getting a bit annoyed with the whole "Closed my long from $6850 at a small profit" when current price is $6910. Like...come on guys. No one cares.

To each his own.  I like seeing what people's trades are because you will eventually get a feel for how good of a trader they are.  That's why everyone likes chewy.

That's assuming they're being honest and not one of those guys who never post a bad trade and say stuff like "I sure am glad I sold at (recent top).  Especially since I bought at (recent bottom)." 

What I get tired of is all these posts saying "Hey guys, there is a very large buy/sell order on bitfinex.  I thought you guys might want to know."  I don't think those affect the price as much as people seem to think.
[removed]
Except if you've been following this thread for a long long time you'd understand that the only posts that needed to be downvoted were the obvious shill posts and those pertaining to altcoins.  Other than that - the point was for an open and interesting discussion of the bitcoin markets.  

Now it's become this curated shithole that downvotes EVERYTHING to oblivion that the hivemind doesn't agree with.  I didn't need to comment anything about downvotes in order to get downvoted.  I don't even *care* I'm getting downvoted except for the fact that it hides my comment from others visiting the thread in the future.  

Unfortunately at this point I rarely use this forum as a medium to exchange insightful information.  It's become a place to correct those that are thinking incorrectly and argue with those who are vocally idiotic.

Hell of an entry for any retail investor. It's been stable enough for the last couple of weeks for me to start buying again, if we sideways/up for another week will tell my friends to do the same.
The most logical course of action would be to walk away and forget about crypto, as one is likely to lose money in a market as manipulated as this one. But for traders, going short is a lot less risky than going long at the moment.
I know how to write it, sure, but I do not know the nuances of variable mutation, interpolation, function delegation, etc. or have the benefit of decades of open source libraries I can use to supplement my workflow. Re-inventing the wheel and learning the quirks of Solidity is not something I have or want to spend my time on, and I'm sure many developers are in the same position.
What! That's ridiculous...

What's wrong with me as an individual? Even if there were you could prove from my comment history, that's a cheap ad hominem, excluding your manipulative response. All metrics you cite are irrelevant:

**By devs**: meaningless. Quality and usefullness of changes over quantity, bitcoin cash has a short history, not even a year. Metric doesn't seem to include devs to all compatible implementations

**By forks**: why would there be a huge number of forks of a fork? To what end? Again, short history.

**watchers**: ok, you got me there. LOL.
You got it!!
Sooner.. OK for me
yep! the problem is, private keys can't be globally updated if/when needed. Somebody has to sign the initial transaction that moves their BTC, say, from their current wallet to an XMSS or other form of wallet that uses one-time sigs.

If you didn't let them do that, for example, then you would be burning people's coins, and that would be a major bummer to those folks
Sorry yes it's a crude word but the shoe shiner-esque analogies are elitist and outdated.

These days your barber could legitimately be more tech savvy than some software engineers. it's not a crazy thought to have. I think it's a silly anecdote 

And thanks by the way :)
Yeah - import it all and then sort the columns by type.  Delete all the non-relevant columns and save only those pertaining to margin trades.  They're labeled pretty clearly -- you'll want to keep the 'settlement' and potentially the 'fee' columns as well.  Took me a few hours and I didn't have that many trades.  


The ratio was in favor of longs well into the end of the bull run. Expecting nothing less from this bear trend before any reversal. Looking for a 2+ ratio before calling the bears for over-exuberance.
I guess. I mean, the hard part is quantifying “low” and “high”. You can tell the bot to buy and then put limit sells higher, but that’s about it... You can use RSI and a bunch kf other signals, but you still need to act upon them. The “acting” is not that easy tbh.
You rode the full stack from a dollar to 15 cents without reducing your position somewhere in there?  Incredible the bags people hold in this market.  Maybe it pans out later.  Good luck.
Because it is not a released project yet and because Tron. Also the Eth dump

I don't honestly believe they are going to live up to expectations, thats why i didn't buy eos besides for some quick trades.
Like in the ocean I mean 😂
In the middle of nowhere yes. Here? Don't tell me 10x more on the buy side is fake, there's not much to sell anymore mate.
> So the only time we should think about a short squeeze is when shorts are at a high relative to the order book ask side past a certain point. Yes?

Is that another way of saying *"Shorts/longs are piling on but the price isn't going down/up"*?
Sort of.  I don't think you can count on the profitable side closing aggressively if price moves fast but the losing side will be forced to close aggressively, so the price move is accelerated.  I mean it does help having leveraged traders on both sides, but Finex does not automatically deleverage people in profit like BitMex does... the winners who take profit help slow the movement, but you will also have momentum traders piling in as well.

And yes the main issue is the size of the leveraged positions vs the more static order book and general trade volumes.  The thing is that sometimes one side of the book which was pretty thick just thins tremendously when there is a breakout move, especially if there is a news catalyst.  So you have too many needing to close and no liquidity to do it (or not enough).  If price moves slowly, the funding rate is probably more important.  If price gets moving fast the open interest vs the orderbook available to close into is what I would look at.  If you have a huge position and there is only so much book to close into, you can get a sort of race to close creating accelerated price action, hitting stops, etc. in a cascade.

Your posts are (edit: were) still up. They're hidden because they've gotten downvoted, so you're in effect complaining about downvotes.

I would say try being a bit more humble and acknowledging that other posters here have valid TA as well (rather than saying its all complete bullshit and random lines on charts). Even if you've been a long time poster here and know your shit, being antagonistic thinking you're above everyone else isn't going to go over very well.

If you disagree with someone's TA, critique it and explain its issues.
That's the thing, they don't post every trade. And none of them are actually making big wins, they'll all stop posting as soon as btc starts trending because they're gonna get rekt or close their  positions way too early most likely.

Deleting an offtopic post is just me doing my job. It's not about you.
I promised this sub I would enforce the rules. I'm sorry that our rules make you feel censored, but I'm not going to change the rules or stop enforcing them.

Posts need to follow the rules and guidelines. That's how we keep this sub clean and focused on the market.
That's the thought with the Noob DCA stuff.

I've been telling people to stay the hell away since October/November. Would be nice to change my tune.
Many of the most brilliant minds in CS don't implement code, they have developers do the implementation.

You aware?
Iin which section of the website can you sort by margin or not margin?
Easy to say im an idiot there, but you know, it wasn't that muchmoney, wasnt afraid of losing it and im still sitting in 6x profits at that stack. 

When you have made almost 33x profits you think you are better than you are.

It's not about being fake. I have seen thin sell books lead to more selling plenty of times
Not necessarily, because you could open 1m longs and shorts each here and the price doesn't have to move. 1m shorts squeezing would be disastrous *only* if those longs have no incentive/limit orders set to close. and even so, the order book would be thin as all hell once those shorts are squeezed, and longs would scramble to close before the order book came crashing back down due to longs closing on a thin order book.

So essentially as long as the ratio is roughly the same, the only issue is people buying on spot with no intention to sell (removing liquidity from the current price range) or the volatility that a squeeze would bring, although the price would arguably end up roughly where it began upon a reversion to the mean if people don't actually buy and  it was simply a short squeeze (this may be a poor argument, it's possible a short squeeze would trigger a bullish awakening within the market regardless of where the buy pressure came from)

Right?
You obviously make a good point. I never thought those particular posts were going to net me a lot of positive reactions. 
It's unfortunate that this board served as a healthy outlet to bounce trading ideas off of other respected community members and now it's become an over-sterilized circle jerk where you must agree with the hivemind.

I guess I just needed to vent today.  And I'll probably go find a telegram group or something.

I'm not above anyone else. No one is above anyone here.  That's the point.  The posts should be left as is unless they're irrelevant or shill posts.  

Half the posts with the most upvotes are from people that bought in at all time high and have no clue what they're even talking about.  And yet they go around "policing" comments and informing commenters of their strong opinions.  It's a complete joke. 
I very much agree that some of those posts are better than others, but the same thing can be said about the rest of the topics that make up the daily thread (TA, news, shit posts, ect).  

Out of all those I find trades the most useful because I feel like it will help to make me a better trader more than the rest.

I just e-mailed the Reddit admins. 
OK, there appears to be no way to just message the admins anymore...wtf is going on with this site anymore?
on it.

Yes, I am aware. And I know Joseph Poon, personally. Same with Vlad Zamfir. Both are no fucking brilliant mind.

Now leave me alone with your bullshit
Also... 

>many of the most brilliant minds in CS don't implement code

Name one. Just ONE
You need to download the spreadsheet copy of your entire trading history.  The types of trades are broken down by column in that spreadsheet. 
Yeah I’ve made bad trades and held bags too.  If nothing else it is a great learning experience.  Good to get learning before putting significant cash into this machine.
oh no, i was totally delusional, but you know what, after seeing the market act so weird (the alt one) in the way down, i was terrified the moment i sold it would just pump to heaven, and with this project a single really good new could do it, so, having no loses i choose wrong.

as i said delusional. But thats only obvious in hindsight. 
I am sure you are familiar with the idea "Cut your losers fast, but let your winners run."  People doing that is why you won't have leveraged closings at the same pace on both sides when the price is moving.
>  longs would scramble to close before the order book came crashing back down due to longs closing on a thin order book.

This next part of the tale is going to be interesting. Will take a few goes before anywhere near 17.1k.

> it's possible a short squeeze would trigger a bullish awakening within the market regardless of where the buy pressure came from

How high before people believe though, high enough that by the time they believe it they'll be FOMO longing the top. Going to slow things down a lot and cause another dip at some point.
>Half the posts with the most upvotes are from people that bought in at all time high and have no clue what they're even talking about. It's a complete joke.

You literally just proved my point. Having that attitude, that nobody else knows anything about what they're doing but *you* do, is what's causing you issues.

Yes, you *aren't* above anyone else. You sure are acting like you think you are though.

There's a contact@reddit.com e-mail I found for support. I explained the situation. 
If you think we're missing something you should DM the mods about it.

We're still playing catch up. There's a lot to review. I'm taking notes.
You're not just full of shit, you're actually overflowing.
You mean FROM poloniex? The poloniex one cannot be modified and then imported as far as I know. how do I downloda the entire trading history from bitcoin.tax?
Biggest learning experience I took from the last bull alt run was secure profit and put at least half to the side instead of reinvesting it all back in. Hard to do in a bull market but going to stay disciplined.
Yes I thought of that...I'm at a loss for this tbqh. For now i think you're right. I won't say shorts at ATH doesn't matter anymore. I need to think about it more though. It gets extremely complicated and again comes down to speculation on how we think the market would react to a squeeze. 
Except the point I keep trying to make is that if the post isn't a shill post or off topic, IT SHOULD NOT BE DOWNVOTED.  And it really seems to be the case that the majority of the people who are vocally antagonistic and downvote are those who have less experience in the market (i.e., bought in at all time high).  

Thanks for proving me right!

Yeah, I just found a way to do it through the site, too. I guess we wait now...

If anyone wants to start a back up sub I'll help. I don't want to be the main person, though.
[deleted]
what? I assume you don’t believe I know Jo and Vlad?

Why? It used to be a very small community.

No clue why I’m full of shit, but whatevvs
Yes - FROM poloniex.
You're going to need to take a few steps.  First, remove all poloniex trading data from your Bitcoin.tax report.  Second - separate your margin trading data from your regular trading data and save them as two separate spreadsheets.  Next, re-import the regular trading data into Bitcoin.tax following the standard procedure (go to the import page, find Poloniex, copy over the spreadsheet).  Then you'll need to MANUALLY add the poloniex margin trades into bitcoin.tax by using the manual entry form.  At least, this is what I had to do to get it all to work.


The thing is, it's human nature to react negatively when someone is being an antagonistic asshole. Even if it's decent information, it doesn't excuse the attitude.

Your point doesn't track because expecting people to upvote/downvote solely based on the analysis is unrealistic. Showing others some respect goes a long way.
Anyway to backup everything in case the compromised account deletes the sub?
I've been in your shoes. I have had my off topic posts removed. I have been temporarily banned in this sub before. It didn't make a lot of sense at the time. I had to reflect on my actions and contributions and then adjust.

Having the rules enforced against your contribution doesn't feel good, but it also isn't personal.

Sometimes people have trouble adjusting to the expectations we have for contributions in this sub. I'll try to give more feedback to help you out if I keep seeing issues.

Your contributions aren't bad, but they're also not always relevant to the stated purpose of the sub. Reflect on that, adjust, and keep posting. I think you have a lot to contribute, but you need to follow the rules when you do that.


You just sound like a dick, that's all. You think Cardano is "pretty sick" (seriously, are you 12?) and you then went on to shit on a project that's probably got more active development going on than most of the others combined, before pointlessly saying that you know a couple of devs as if it gives you some sort of credibility.
But it doesn't let me modify the CSV which I download from poloniex. If I do that, which I have done to remove all margin trades, it says "no category field" which is apparently because modifying the CSV in any way ruins the document and makes it so it doesn't work on their website... :(
You're missing the point on multiple levels.

I was able to access and save the CSS, but our automod config is inaccessible. 
[deleted]
get the fuck out of here

I didnt mention Poon, the other Ethereum shill did
That's incorrect.
You're modifying it in a way that screws up the formatting.
Just simply delete the rows that pertain to margin trades and re import.

Example of not showing respect, right there.

Why not actually address what I said instead of just saying "lol you don't get it?"

Sure, if we were all robots, posts wouldn't be downvoted if they had valid market discussion. We aren't robots though, so when people make comments with an assholeish attitude, even if it's a decent point, it's probably not going to go over well.
Ok, automod will be annoying to set back up but it won't take long
Yes, but the focus needs to be on the market, not on other issues. 

Your first post got a pass because it was popular and it hasn't been brought up a lot. I thought that it was off topic, and vaguely relevant to the market, but the community decided to respond to it and I felt that needed to be respected.

Your second post established a possible pattern of offtopic posting. Comments about the market were more of an afterthought, weren't well developed ideas, or we're straight up falsehoods. The focus of the post was on potentially anecdotal or misleading information about mining, too. I determined that the post should be removed, but that it probably wasn't malicious. A warning seemed sufficient.
I just switched to cointracking.info, it is SO much better and worked perfectly
I'm sorry, but it's not my fault you couldn't / didn't read my 4+ other posts addressing your question.  Instead of caring so much about the 'tone' of my post, why don't you take the time to add something useful to the conversation about Bitcoin?  Or is it because you don't actually have anything insightful to contribute that you focus your energy on irrelevant shit like this? 

This is a place to talk about bitcoin price action and to make some fucking money.
Someone has it, yay!
[deleted]
You can look at my post history to find my current stance - just yesterday I had a long form post detailing my position (https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8b4twg/daily_discussion_tuesday_april_10_2018/?sort=top). I don't trade short time frames and my position hasn't remotely changed since.

Regardless, you never even addressed my point at all. That's okay though, feel free to continue your "I'm better than everyone else attitude." I was just trying to give you some advice to help avoid the downvotes.
> In order for mining to be profitable, two things need to happen: The price of bitcoin needs to continue to rise along with the difficulty

False. That's observed but not required. Moore's Law contradicts your theory. If you don't accept that, then accept that there are some miners who are able to profitably mine at current prices.

> Everyone mining since December 2017 has been taking serious losses in profit

No evidence for this claim

> We also have a case where the difficulty is very very high and has not corrected itself to the price

No evidence for this claim

You're a classic, "here's a 20 page medium post with all my TA and very specific market movement predictions with entries and exits.  Oh by the way I've never executed any of these trades and I'm sitting mostly in cash (>$1,000)".  Awesome man.  Keep on contributing.  I don't know what I value more - your LARP trading view posts or your self-help advice.  
[deleted]
Cool man.

You clearly didn't read what I said in my post - I was just saying a few of many ways I could see it going using classical and perfectly valid TA. All specific numbers would obviously be only approximate/educated guesses, I'm not a dumb ass. Pretty sure I said that in the post. Supports and resistances are bands, not lines. Hey I think I said that in the post too!

And don't pretend to know how much cash I'm sitting on. Maybe you're projecting? I feel like I'm talking to an arrogant high schooler.
>Moore's law is a theory, an observed theory, but a theory none the less.

Yes. It's a much more established and used theory than yours. Almost everything we "know" is a theory. Relativity is a theory. Theories are verified by observation.

You aren't proposing theories, you are making unverified assertions.


> the difficulty, the hash rate, and time spent mining

The numbers you can use for these variables fluctuate widely.

>This is the evidence that I provided in the very first sentence. 

That's not proof. That's a graph.

Try looking at it another way:

https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-difficulty.html#log

On a log scale, difficulty hasn't changed a lot since 2014.

Compare that to the price:

https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-price.html#log

There's only a loose correlation and we're not far from where we should expect to be, if we're not exactly where we should expect to be.



TA is a meme until you're using that analysis to put your own money on the line.  Significant money.

No projections.  In fact, I'm fairly certain *you're* the one projecting with posts like that.  

I'm all for TA posts.  I'm all for *any* post that's relevant to the trading of bitcoin.  
Keep on doing you, man.  You've done nothing to prove me wrong though.  You're clearly another person that bought in very late and posts in here LARPING as a successful trader.  It's funny that everyone arguing against my point shares that similar context.  




[deleted]
Lol. I very much am trading significant money off my TA. Sorry I don't trade on the 5 min $30 scalp time frame you enjoy - as I said, I'll be buying in on a break of 7.2k or, if it crashes harder, when I think the market will turn around.

Sold everything at 10.8k, have been scalping buying in here and there just to see if a bounce has major legs but overall my fiat value has stayed pretty constant since then. I'm trading for a great entry on a long term hold position, not day trading. I think my post made that clear. Just because I don't use exchanges that offer margin doesn't mean I'm not trading.
This, right here, is an issue. 

The argument you are making is antagonistic. You're saying that because I disagree with you that I'm not able to understand. That's an ad hominem.

You're also baiting me by refusing to acknowledge my counter argument.

Please consider adjusting the way you decide to communicate with others so that they feel heard and so that you are communicating your ideas in accurate and logically precise ways. If you aren't able to do that, consider saying nothing at all.
Great.  Anything you add to the discussion that's relevant to the price action of bitcoin is valuable.  I don't really give a shit what time frame you're trading off of.  You consistently miss my point.

You're also putting me down for scalping off small market moves, yet that's all the market has presented in the way of opportunity lately.  You'd be naive to think that I don't also have a longer-term strategy at play.  You said it yourself - you're waiting for a good long-term entry (and NO ONE knows where that is right now).    

As a side note - I'm fairly certain you're a full on LARPER and don't have more than $1k capital and aren't very old or experienced.  That seems to be typical with posters like yourself.  Thanks for the discourse buddy.  
[deleted]
I honestly don't really care what Mr Random "I'm Better Than You" Internet Stranger thinks of me or what I'm trading with haha. You go ahead thinking I don't have more than 1K capital, no skin off my bones.

And I'm not putting you down for scalping short time frames, just not my cup of tea and you seemed to be shitting on my TA I'm basing my trading off of for literally no reason other than you think you're better than everyone else or think I don't have money (which... why does that even matter? TA is objective it doesn't give a shit what you have).
> You're also baiting me by refusing to acknowledge my counter argument 

I will ban you if I find that you discourage other redditors this way.

I'm trying to help you understand. This is me doing you a favor.
I'm not shitting on your TA based on timeframe. I'm shitting on it because you literally stated in your post that you aren't even taking a position based off of it.  You sit and soapbox about trades that you're not even making. TA is mostly a joke.  It's helpful for pattern recognition but mostly an erroneous visual.  If you were actually trading with significant money based on your TA and have proven successful through multiple market cycles, I'd be inclined to follow your posts more closely and listen to what you have to say objectively.  That's clearly not the case, however.  
[deleted]
I am making a trade based on it. If 7.2k breaks, I'm buying in. Literally said that in the post you didn't read. A bear flag is a bear flag, and an RSI divergence is an RSI divergence. Someone recognizing these things doesn't need to have sat through multiple market cycles for their analysis to be valid, it's completely objective. You can argue all you want with people about whether a pattern/divergence is valid or not, but saying it isn't right because someone hasn't been in the market long enough is dumb as hell. Also: /r/gatekeeping
No, but this is a really good example of what I was talking about.
It isn't dumb as hell.  At all.
Do you consider paper trading on a platform like ThinkOrSwim the same thing as actually funding a brokerage account and making trades with real money?

If your answer is yes, you're a fucking idiot.  Real experience is *everything* with the market.  This is why your opinion is a fucking joke. 

[deleted]
No; paper trading obviously makes it too easy to remove emotion from the equation. Trading lots of money can make it hard to stay emotionless, sure.

But TA doesn't involve emotion at all. All it is is analysis based on patterns/indicators. A $100M net worth trader recognizing a bullish divergence isn't fundamentally any different than a $100k net worth trader recognizing the same exact divergence. Judge based on the TA, not the person providing it.
Yep, there was a ninja edit.
I challenge you to continue to trade large stacks of money based solely on your TA through multiple market cycles and then come back and write about your experiences.  There's a reason that seasoned traders don't take what new traders have to say very seriously.
