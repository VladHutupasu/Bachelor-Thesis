[Daily Discussion] Friday, April 13, 2018 -- TITLE
#New post: [\[Daily Discussion\] Saturday, April 14, 2018 →](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8c5799/daily_discussion_saturday_april_14_2018/)
Point and Figure https://i.imgur.com/01TNWHS.png  We have confirmed a long column of 20 X's.  A 50% retrace of this long column would bring us below 7400.  This was a clear break upward which is good.  Our new range is 6630-8100.

The only other long pole in 2018 that has not resolved is from March 27. A retrace of the March 27 long pole would bring us above $8,173.  28/73 long poles in the last year have been over 20 X's tall.

Bearish Divergence on RSI  https://www.tradingview.com/x/NOdSQ8Ga/ Both 2 hour and 4 hour have confirmed bear div on RSI.  A clear H&S is forming on lower time frame but the neckline has not broken yet.  I guess neckline break could bring us down to 7000-7300.  I wouldn't normally play a H&S on a lower time frame but having the bear div to support it could make it profitable.  I prefer to take position within 5 or so minutes of the 4 hour div confirmation.
The main mainstream media sentiments that have me thinking this is going to be shorter than 2014:

- no Mt Gox-like event (yet, knock on wood)

- the most mainstream bitcoin narrative is "bitcoin prices have insane swings", whereas in 2014 it was "bitcoin is useless"

- Congress and the SEC, among other governments, are treating crypto seriously and so are larger financial players


I am still out of position except for a very small long term hodl stack, as I'm not convinced the bear market is quite done, but am going to start DCA-ing a little more aggressively.
Our bullish scenario still hasn't been invalidated. This is day three or four of it.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/0rzuQkoC/

This TA expects us to continue our run to log resistance at around 8.5k sometime in the next few days. Wherever we end up finding resistance will complete the third wave of our Elliot Wave on the four hour chart (purple). We've just started moving into that region of resistance.

After forming a handle, I expect we'll rocket through 8.5k to somewhere between 9.2K and 11k. We've gone from 8.5k to 11k in four days twice in the last several months. We'll either do more price discovery there or we'll rocket through. The Elliot Waves in this bull case still show that we're headed for that region, though.

Still no Bear case. You guys are owed one.
For those of you shitting your pants on this drop, chill out for now. 

This is what happens when the market jumps almost 20% in 48 hours. 

This is just noise unless $7,300 falls (and arguably $7,100).

If $7,000 breaks down, however, I'd say that's when shit really would hit the fan.
Following up on [yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8bnetl/daily_discussion_thursday_april_12_2018/dx9lt3h/):

[Here](https://imgur.com/ap8K0MT) is a zoomed in version of the chart I posted yesterday.
I predicted that the dotted green line would act as resistance and that seems to have come true. Yay!

So far the pullback seems to be well absorbed by bulls. However should this fall further down, I'm looking at 7.3-.5k as support turned resistance to act as support again (not drawn on the chart). Should that hold IMHO the bullish momentum is still in play and a retest of 8.3k, with greater chance to break out, is well in the cards. Should we break out I expect a small pullback around 8.8k to test the dotted green line as support.

If 7.3-.5k fails to hold, I'm going to prepare my visit to 6.6k. My first risky bet for a medium term long position will be placed here. I'll put a heavier bet at 6k for an often mentioned double bottom scenario. By then I'll dust off my exit strategy and prepare for the worst.

Hope you guys appreciate these.
It's pretty odd for a bull flag to be slanting upward instead of downward (or flat), but this seems to be the consolidation range for now:

https://imgur.com/a/s7uTc

$8,000 is currently the line in the sand for a breakdown, whereas $8,300 or so is currently the point where the market would break out to the upside. 

I wouldn't be surprised if this continues for a bit longer. Since it's a parallel channel, it can continue indefinitely.
Shit, the train left me behind it seems :(
Can we all just appreciate some nice volume finally 
Daily stoch RSI almost starting to cross in the overbought zone.

This has meant big dumps before:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/Tf217heM/

edit: also noticing a potential rising wedge forming with the old log support-turned-resistance line if we rise back up and bounce down off that

https://www.tradingview.com/x/DbTlE4p6/

currently not in a position but will be opening a short if we go back up to 8200
Damn by the sounds of how everyone is calling a dip, I'm guessing there are a bunch of underwater shorts right now

Bullflag into another bullflag or what?
https://www.tradingview.com/x/ejwJuB8y

At what point are we allowed to throw risk management out the window and fomo?
Closed my $1mm short from $7640 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8bnetl/z/dx8ymiw), at $7838 for a loss of approx 2.5%. Market not moving as I expected when opening this trade, best for me to sit out at the moment. 
So... If we get a red candle the size of the green one from yesterday, would it be called a marge?
I gave up margin trading with leverage a couple of weeks ago, it has made me much more disciplined / patient with my trades (I've made 2 trades this week), I still have difficulty identifying good places to exit profitable trades though (I sold at 7650 during the pump, still haven't bought back in).

If you're fairly new to this stuff and find yourself over-trading , I'd recommend ditching leverage entirely. It takes away a lot of the FOMO and helps you remain objective imo.

TL,DR
>Bitcoin, despite its short existence, has weathered enough trials in the market that there is a high likelihood it will not vanish as a valued asset any time soon. Furthermore, the Lindy effect suggests that the longer Bitcoin remains in existence the greater society’s confidence that it will continue to exist long into the future. In other words, the societal trust of a new monetary good is asymptotic in nature.

.


>Owning bitcoins is one of the few asymmetric bets that people across the entire world can participate in. Much like a call option, an investor’s downside is limited to 1x while their potential upside is still 100x or more. Bitcoin is the first truly global bubble whose size and scope is limited only by the desire of the world’s citizenry to protect their savings from the vagaries of government economic mismanagement.

.

>Bitcoin is probably the purest example of speculative adoption humanity has seen to date. It is following a typical technological adoption curve at a rapid pace. The S-curve is made up hype cycles which repeat in a fractal manner. Each fractal repetition is roughly one order of magnitude greater than the one prior. Since reaching dollar parity, the percentage increase of each bubble over the last has been decreasing, even though the $ increase grows exponentially. There are likely 2–3 remaining hype cycles before Bitcoin becomes near-universally adopted.

.

>I have since come to the conclusion that accurately calling the top of such a massive increase is a fool’s errand. As a general practice, you are better off selling progressively toward the top, then waiting for the crash and buying back progressively toward the boring low; with the goal of increasing your long-term bitcoin holdings.

First article is a good read, they all are. Summarizes why I hold. I don't think we're ready for the next bull run quite yet but I'm almost positive it's gonna happen this year. By summer or November would be a good bet. The market cycle is moving way faster than the last one, and on-par with the rest. I dunno about you guys but *1M is okay, not life changing, 10M would be a lot cooler

We made it to the Car level... looking forward to House
Well, one thing I will say is that this certainly *should* retrace a decent chunk of the gains between $6,800 and $8,200.

RSI is incredibly overextended on the 2h - 6h. 

I'm not crazy enough to short here though. Personally I'm still just watching and waiting for an opportunity to buy the dip.
[Longs took some profits](https://www.tradingview.com/x/WAp6RVv7/) throughout the day and price still holding steady, indicates decent buying pressure.
Opened a hedge short at $8,030 with stops above $8,300. 

6h RSI barely dipped below 70 on that dump. It's too soon for buyers to be push much higher, in my opinion. 
TA guys: In retrospect, was there any indicator whatsoever that could of been picked up on that would have given even the slightest hint about the massive moves over the last 24 hours?
DCAing into a long, entry at 8050, with adds at 7800, 7600 and 7400. Good idea? 
Still climbing a bit from inertia but foot off the gas pedal, don't circlejerk too much about fomo, there's none apart from traders, expecting a swift drop soon
/u/MikeXBT from your recent short around 7540, my understanding is you got liquidated around 8100. 

Are you taking a step away from the market now?

What is your next move 
What I'm currently looking at: https://imgur.com/a/0WfXO

We're testing a log support line we broke through about two weeks ago as support turned resistance right now. If we do manage to break through this band, we then have to test the log ATH band. These two (seemingly) heavy resistances providing some confluence makes me a bit worried about our odds. If we fail at either of these resistances I'm not going to be surprised if we go retest the bottom log support *again* (gut tells me it wouldn't hold but that's just me).

Zooming in to the 4 hr: https://imgur.com/a/U2pzG  
About the only decent pattern I'm seeing on smaller time frames is this ascending wedge. The lines meet in-between the log support-turned-resistance and ATH resistance providing confluence for that breaking down at some point. You can maybe see a tiny bull flag on the 1 hr (not charted) as well.

Also worth mentioning that if we turn around now, we'll have hidden bear divs on the 12 hr, 6 hr, and 4 hr with the 11.8k local high. If we make it up a bit more to the mid 8000s it'd probably be there on the daily too. Didn't chart these though; they haven't yet happened.

For one last comment: https://imgur.com/a/xkVlv  
This is Aug - Oct of 2017. A much smaller correction/crash, but in this case, notice that there was an initial DCB, which then crashed down to a low, another DCB down to a higher low, and then we broke out. That's similar to what we have right now, just on a much smaller scale with the higher low being farther from the actual low. If this large triangle is going to break up, I think this is the push it does it on (preferably with sideways action in the current range until the ATH resistance is below that log support). Note that "push" doesn't mean we can't bounce around between 7.8-8.2 for awhile.

Now all that said, I'm still bought in (to alts that have increased my BTC stack 10% since I bought in at 7.2k). Debating selling here but I think I'm going to let it ride for now and just move stops up. If we do break up out of this triangle here I'd be very happy with my current position as a long term hold so going to take that risk. Edit: If we test 8.3k within 4-7 hours from now (time of the post) I think I may sell part as we'll be testing the meat of the log support turned resistance at the top of the ascending wedge; seems like a good exit point.
Guys, reading through the comments, I feel
like many are overtrading.

I get it, it’s not easy being left behind or have to cover a short from sub 7k.

But this is neither the place to go long or short ImO.

Let’s just wait and see what happens

[This 9 minute video aired Thursday night on American Public Televison's daily news show](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/the-how-and-why-of-buying-bitcoin)

"NewsHour draws about 1.1 million viewers per episode."

Funny how this would have seemed like a HUGE deal to me a year ago.
[deleted]
Ok, 8200. What do I do now?
Closed my long on 8177 with 7.5k entry @ x25 leverage. 150% return which masivly bumped up my trading stack again after losing quite a bit on liquidated shorts a few weeks ago. 

Reentered with 20% of my stack on x10 leverage to reduce risk a little.

Currently considering cashing out my holdings again for an easy 5% gain on my total investment capital (taking it up to 25% total), but i could end up forcing myself to buy in again on a higher price, resulting in less actual btc compared to what i own now.
Peter Brandt is call it a bull

$300k long from $7870 lets go bears how far will you go.
Can't place a single order on Bitmex this is infuriating
So, thinking about the clearly visible adam and eve since 1 april on the charts, i ve noticed that with the 6k and the recent bottom  you can also see it, but its not clearly defined ... If people start treating it as such it would be extremely bullish of course, so, whats your opinion on that? 
[Price rising, buying declining.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Ry3dsfKD/)  I'd expect a pull back here in the next few hours to the $7500 - $7800 range
I’ve seen plenty of pumps like this over the last 5 years or so, both in bear market and bull market.

What I haven’t seen is the widespread consensus reaction to a pump in all 3 bitcoin subreddits of “good try Mr Whales! This is a fakeout and we all know it!” 

The contrarian in me really questions if this is indeed the start of the next bull run for that reason alone.

Welcome back everyone. 
Finally hit my Ichimoku [c-clamp](https://snag.gy/9sbRrg.jpg) I have been yelling about for 2 days.   Feeling bullish again boys, hopefully not a fakeout. 
Ascending wedge I had drawn making a hard attempt at breaking down (currently just barely below). Waiting for confirmation before selling, could be a fakeout.

Also wouldn't spell doom and gloom... if it isn't a fakeout I'm just selling to lock in some profits and see if 7.2-7.5 range holds.

Update: Hourly candle closed below wedge, but bulls seem to be pushing back trying to reject it. Still gonna wait and see a bit longer.... aaand I'm out to fiat. Tight stops, could still be a fakeout but if it's not I'd rather be out here than later.

Final Update: Bought back in ~7830 for tiny add to my stack. This is not acting like I thought it would with that ascending wedge break down, 7800 is acting as strong support. Sticking to my original stops.
3 months ago Bitcoin went Hollywood. 

After the dust settles and people are certain the bottom is in, do you think there will be more or less buyers jumping onto the train next time we hit, say, $10k. 
Sweet buy of BTC 227. 
For what it's worth we bounced right off the old log support line, it may be support turned resistance now:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/58VuNOLp/

also 23.7k shorts to 30.5k longs...be careful out there longs.

edit: also been overbought on the 6hr for over a day and 12hr RSI is at 67

disclosure: currently out of position

edit2: opened a short at 8100
Sentiment:

* /r/bitcoin levels are highly positive, late jan/early feb levels

* /r/ethereum on the rise

* this daily thread is massively negative compared to normal

Number of subreddit active users has been more volatile these past few days, higher numbers than usual.

Nothing super interesting re: [correlation](http://distributed.love:8081/correlation); it's more decoupled than ever. Not even inversely correlated.

EDIT: those bear divs def worked out this time didnt they?  Both 2 and 4 hour divs just about played out now.  Could see a bounce here if we are ultra-bullish.  But I'd like to see us touch down into the volume profile node.  7.3k, maybe down to 7k
Leaving a position over night for first time ever.

What apps should I use for alarms on prices? Ones that aren’t delayed 
I would like to know how many of you hold or buy BTC only, no alts... 
Damn people here don't know what to do with themselves shorting this lol. A lot of uncertainty 
5 days ago, I posted a trade for the first time. Luck was a lady that night.

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8anmvt/z/dx050o1

The problem--I've never known how to take profit. Just re-invest. At this point I'm unsure whether to hold out until Target 3.

Closed my short and entered a 5x long at 7850.... hold me pls


EDIT: i put a stop in to make sure i make small profit, hoping the bulls can rally back here but i'm not seeing much buy pressure at the moment.
Just noticed Binance leading Finex in volume on cryptowat.ch

Not something I've seen before
I'm going to say it again because there is a real danger over people becoming bulls again here when they really shouldn't be. 

Nothing massive has changed here. Yep, it was great to see some upward momentum for once, yep it was good that we broke up through the trend line.

Fundamentally though, nothing has changed yet. This is still a bear market, the trend is still overwhelmingly down. Look at the weekly chart for example and then reevaluate. 

Unless we can break through the ATH line, stay above it and move away... then nothing has shifted. 

I know people will likely downvote and accuse me of being too pessimistic or that I surely must be short so therefore i'm willing Bitcoin to drop. Believe me i'm not. I want nothing more than Bitcoin to rise and rise (at a sustainable rate of course.)

Just don't suddenly expect the bear market to be over because we had a decent 4 hour candle. We've had many before and they all resulted in more downside. 

Anyone long, make sure your stop is decent 
I keep flip flopping positions, opening a short, closing it, opening a long - either I get hit a few bucks or I scalp a few bucks. But it's driving me nuts. How many times can we attempt 8.2 really? My brain says short but my heart tells me anything is possible.
a sharp increase in bitcoin ratio across alts in the middle of a bear market followed by btc pump just signals a pump and back to business as usual to me. still refuse to sleep exposed with my stack - i do wish i had the guts to scalp long here though. my strategy here is still to give it couple of weeks - if worse comes to worse and i have missed big upwards movements by then i will move to smaller alt-roulette tables ;)
Who was here in 2014?

Who bought in profusely in the pump to 680?

How many times did you get margin called long after that pump?

My answers are "I was, I did, and probably a half dozen times or more"

Wow. I’m either an idiot or a fucking genius. 

I accidentally opened 3 Longs from the 6700-6900 range that I got confused about when I was playing with new stuff in the order book. 

Total rookie mistake that could have costed me hundreds but I’ve managed to make out pretty well. 
I think the best strategy for.next few days is just buy in. Of course it is always danger that one catches the peak, but it is just seems more likely to go up now than down.
Getting past 8150-8200 should be quite hard: Log support that turned resistance and 0.618FIB (ATH and FEB bottom). But hey who the fuck knows...
(local) Double top now off 8.2 which also lines up with our old log support line

https://www.tradingview.com/x/hldrqowD/
Waiting 1.5 hours to see if the volume picks up. If not, I'm out until volume picks back up. Kind of expecting the usual weekend dip. Trading is my main source of income right now, so just trying to make that 2&#37; per day and hold fiat until I start the job search again.
$9k btc is a major liquidation point for a swing trade short I have open.

Close now at a loss, or wait?
The nice thing about today is, the 24 chart widget on my phone has a usable scale again.
Long from last night closed at $8100. Won’t look for reentry until RSI cools. Hopefully a bounce off resistance turned support on the daily.
Anybody remember the order of the exchanges on the ticker? the prices are in /u/AutoModerator 's flair.
Anyone care to point me in the right direction to learn how to trade responsibly?  How to look at the market, how to protect yourself with stops, etc?  I know nothing but would maybe like to dip my toes down the road.  Where do I start?  I have a career so it would be an off hours hobby most likely.
Anyone opening a short here? 

Edit: I got wrecked earlier and this probably isn't smart, but I opened a small short at 7950.
https://imgur.com/a/kBBUY

This is what I'm looking at now.  We're still in a weekly consolidation phase.  While I would love to see us soar to $10K+, that would be too aggressive and set us up for heartbreak when it retraced back down.  It would be more healthy to see it trend back down to $7500 by May 2 where we see the lines converge and the breakout occurs.  We could then anticipate a rise to $10K by end of the second quarter and close out the year over $25K.  

Of course Bitcoin isn't that predictable and well see peaks and valleys along the way.  I personally believe we'll see it touch $40K+ before year end before settling at $25K at the end of Q4.
Stopped out of my short yesterday, but I'm a glutton for punishment. Opened short at 8100. Layering in adds to 8220. Alarms around 8375. 

Closed my scalp long from 7700 (chewy follow) at 8K. Still holding my Sept fut long from 6410. Lets see if this support turned resistance is the real deal.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/fKEkjcw5/

edit to add: 2 out of 3 adds executed (8180 and 8225). 8320 still on the table due to the rising wedge. 
[deleted]
If i got a $ for everytime someone claimed bitcoin is "oversold" or "overbought" i would no longer have to trade.

Fact: the market doesnt give a shit about RSI
So is this the suckers rally disbelief, bull trap or reversal? Seeing more people here talk about spot buying is for sure different than the last weeks


Still holding my comfy 5x long from 6810,  my gut feeling is 8200 where this tops out 
4h cloud: https://i.imgur.com/bNYpD1o.png

daily cloud: https://i.imgur.com/TCgd6pL.png

obviously we had a nice breakout today :) since then, it looks like we're flirting with the 4h kumo edge, and we're currently below the 200 EMA and the kumo edge is acting as support for now. TK/KJ support seems to be from $7300-7500 on most timeframes. Accordingly, I will be buying if we pierce the 200 EMA and have a stop loss set if we break into the cloud with staggered limit buys at support levels. 

On the daily, we've cleared the TK resistance and have the 200 EMA and kijun lines as major overhead resistance. The kijun has decisively denied the price the past three encounters. On the other hand, an adam and eve double bottom appears to be forming, which could coincide with a nice juicy edge-to-edge trade if we manage to clear the aforementioned resistance levels.
I'm reading what everyone is posting about the H&S, the bear div, but I can't stop noticing the bull flag. What do you guys think?
I went short at 8.2, we're pretty far from the [Kijan and Tenkan](https://snag.gy/3cohID.jpg) (target 7.6) but also not super confident in it cuz a lot of traders were waiting to daily close about 8k to get in, so I could see money flowing in.    We're way overbought but I have seen these things last a long time so it could still have more juice in it.   So short-term short seems like a good move, maybe lol. 
my outlook has changed from bearish to neutral. feels like a comfortable price has been found between 6.5 and 8, so i have increasing limit buys set for 7.8 to 6.6, with 1/3 of my dry powder. getting impatient to buy my bags back.
I'll say it again:

THE BOTTOM IS IN!

That doesn't mean we moon today or tomorrow, but it does mean sub 6k ain't happening any time soon.
I updated the bubble comparision chart:

[https://imgur.com/a/qRkoq](https://imgur.com/a/qRkoq)

One possibility is that we do the opposite as in 2014, first an upspike and then a downspike before we see more sideways in the 6ks.  I decided to stay out, made some nice profits and do not wanna risk them.
Remember when I told the bulls to chill yesterday? Now it's the bear's turn. Please act like you've been here before or I'll give you a free day-pass to the sin bin.
Looking at the bigger picture, I personally am skeptical that this is the reversal. Most people know that in a bear market, the ups are quick and large, and the downs are long and drawn out. This looks like another sharp rise before another long drop.
I'm kinda new to this whole thing but it's pretty interesting how the chart patterns have changed *completely* since the "big squeeze".
1 week ago I would have expected a 100-200 drop at this point.

Is it a sign of a reversal or is this just going to be a huge, huge marge? (rethorical question)
I'm so tempted to short this. Trying to sit on my hands for now.

There's a small H&S forming on the 30min chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/Uaw1fl9F/

And a _potential_ bigger H&S forming on the 2 hour chart. And combine that with potential bear divs everywhere...

But then again, all it takes to pop us over 8.3k is one player executing a decent margin order and the bull rally is on again...
Daily formed a [shooting star](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shootingstar.asp) on close and stoch rsi is still hot. I’d be careful going long in this 78xx+ range. 
Stops are set at 8150 and 7550 for the night. Hope I don't wake up to find them triggered to the downside. 

Good luck to all.
What are you guys doing now? Tethered an hour ago and now not even sure if it was a good move
Those that trade the $100 swings. Have you tried solely swing trading the 4hr or daily candles and comparing your win rate/profit? Because personally, I’m a garbage day trader, but swing trade with much success.
Why is it taking an hour for a block to confirm...

Any of you bulls have convincing arguments for me to consider a long position in the +4h timeframes?
I raised my stop last night and I raised it again this morning, this time to 7724. If the price manages to hold here and then go up I'll raise it again; basically mimicking a trailing stop order.

Plenty of times I've frustrated myself with tight stops that almost perfectly marked a local bottom, and that makes the veins pop out on my neck while I sputter conspiracy theories about being front run (even if it's just chump change), but my problems are:

a) Preferred to hang on for the potential for another massive green candle, rather than selling this morning;

b) Not at all comfortable trying to do this with just an alarm. If this reverses and we get a red candle like yesterday's green, I don't want to have to rely on manual input to exit. Chasing like that on an overloaded website is not fun.

Quite possible I get stopped out before dinner time.

does anyone know why bitcoinity shows buys as sells a lot...? 

Especially when it's a hidden wall? Has anyone else noticed this bug?

bitfinex.com shows it as red sells and bitcoinity shows it as green buys
Anyone know where I can get OKEX premium data over time?

Hopefully they have it local, as I can get all pairs. The Eth quarterly premium is over 5%, something that hasn't happened in months (right now in part because of a 14k Eth liquidation at $507). The BTC premium for the same contract period is half of that. Thinking about arbing (Er, straddling?) the premium here, would like to get some data to back up my gut.

Thanks guys.

*Edit: Made 38% on the short, lost 23% on the long (normalized to 20x leverage)... Would really like to see historical data that I can manipulate (so I can choose future entries like this....)
What a drag...this morning I set a limit buy at 7,732. Just got home from work and checked binance and saw that it didn't get filled even though the low was 7,732...I am cursed.
could be my hopium pipe talking but this sell volume looks to be getting absorbed relatively well. take that with a grain of salt, just what I'm seeing.
The optimists are calling the start of the next bull run. It could perhaps turn out to be just another bull trap. There was a short squeeze as too many shorts were piling up. Is that going to fundamentally change the dynamics of the market? Does a short squeeze convert a bear market to a bull market?
Here's the updated info for google search term: "Bitmex" via google trends. As you can see, it appears as if we have peaked. My hypothesis was and is that the increase in searches was predictive of an increase in shorting interest, particularly from retail investors. For this reason, I and others expected a short squeeze, and therefore I made three buys at $6,700. (In comments) I will not touch that position for 23 months as I have other BTC that I plan to sell incrementally if we continue up. Questions, feedback welcome. Hope you are all well.

A lot of talk recently about the short:long ratio but that perp funding rate on bitmex is also a pretty good indicator and it indicates that many bears are still too optimistic (going to pay a modest funding fee in 9 hours). 

I guess a lot of them are rage shorting after the green dildo of death yesterday.

Not a big amount compared to what we are dealing across the globe, but India keeps doing its own shit: https://cryptocrimson.com/news/coinsecure-438-bitcoins-stolen
I'm the luckiest person alive today.


I opened a long at 6900 yesterday night and went to sleep. Woke up and closed it at 7600.


I opened another long an hour ago at 7800 and closed it right now at 8000.



:D
If we close above 8k I'll be longing  June futures and hodling that shit. 
Again talking about longs/shorts number. The interesting thing I see here is that the number of longs grew by 3k after the green dildo, while shorts were more and less stable and price just increased a little bit (from 7.7k to 7.9k). 
Why do I think that such observation is important? Because, if we look what happened to shorts' number during the sharp and little dump yesterday at started at 7:00 UTC, we can see that the little dump was "funded" by openinig short positions. So, recent little pump is also funded by leverage.
Of course right now sentiment is bullish and it is hard to convince people, but I see the quite similar but opposite situation here. People opened pretty significant amount of long positions to move the price by only $200-300 after yesterday's. The thing is that, selling pressure is here and not dissappearing (maybe a whale selling portions, if shorts are not increasing). Recent buys could be just fomo by "little" traders, who may be liquidated and forced to close their positions, if a whale decides that we can be long squeezed to let's say 7.4k to cool down indicators for further bullish moves. 

However, since shorts are not increasing nor decreasing, this tells us that people are really scared to open short, and in overall we are heading upwards. Sorry for my bed England (c)

Let's swap knowledge around here, what indicators/websites/tools do you guys frequently use for BTC/crypto?
Hidden sell wall at $8,078 on BFX. Interesting...

edit: pulled, and up we go, for now anyway
So, I guess that most of us are just scared to open shorts. That's why we are still at 8100. However, number of shorts started to increase. Bearish divergence appeared as already my colleagues said here. This is actually very interesting case to watch. Most likely we stay at 7900-8100 range with rsi cooling off on higher timeframes.
The way I'm reading this, we had an ascending wedge break down this morning (weakly) and form a bear flag. Inside that bear flag channel, we have a descending triangle of sorts forming. There was a fakeout break downwards which was summarily rejected (8040). I've cut wicks like crazy on the chart below, which is part of why I'm doubting. I'm expecting a pop, and that pop should determine the direction of our next move. If it's down, I have a great entry. If up....

https://www.tradingview.com/x/UZxKMSBj/

I'm still short from this morning, CA @ 8160. I'm losing faith in this position, so I've just set break-even stops. If we break 8K, we should retrace a lot. If we break back up to 8200, it seems like we're headed up more than down. Enough that I don't want any part of this range.

Good luck all. 
Not saying there will be a bounce, but this is looking almost identical to what yesterday. Cleared longs with a sharp dump, then boom.
Some charts:

Finex: https://www.tradingview.com/x/6z9rC2Ar/

Stamp: https://www.tradingview.com/x/rfix3RP0/

I wont talk about positions I am in right now (at risk of sounding like a Monday morning quarterback, because I did not post them here), but if I *were* long from before the pump yesterday I would be holding it.

Possible long scalp entries at local bottoms here look like $7750 and $7600:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/fIUq3Qfa/

With a short R/R Entry if $7600 breaks down.

For those that have longs open from the $6k's, hopefully we've sufficiently hopped into the next trading range here $7900-$9400

https://www.tradingview.com/x/AKKAtBVo/

Curious to see if enough people have the red downtrend line drawn that breaking up out of this (at least on Finex) proves significant. Stamp chart looks like this is exactly the place you'd expect to find resistance.


Thoughts? Happy trading out there folks. 


It looks like we're consolidating before we break out.  My guess is up.  The [daily](https://bitcoincharts.com/charts/bitstampUSD#rg30zigDailyzczsg2018-04-10zeg2018-04-18ztgSzm1g10zm2g25zi1gRSIzv) is looking eerily similar to [another short term reversal](https://bitcoincharts.com/charts/bitstampUSD#rg180zigDailyzczsg2014-05-16zeg2014-06-04ztgSzm1g10zm2g25zi1gRSIzv).
I like that the american morning dump has been replaced by an american morning pump 
Looking for insights from both bulls and bears.

How is this run-up from $6.6k to $8.2k any different than the March 18th run-up from $7.2k to $9.2k? We all saw how that pump ended.  

The % increase is similar. What about other factors such as volume, open short to long ratio, etc? 


Buying pressure around every dip is relentless. Will still try to layer in a short just because of the now massive disparity in short:long ratio and the bear divs everywhere. 
That's a pretty bear div on the 2h (and 4h as well). I have an underwater short at 7950 but I won't close it just now.

EDIT : [chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/qtSf1gZI/)
Rising wedge break down?
It's nice for the market to crash right where it was when I went to sleep. Sucks I missed all the action though
[removed]
I think we just broke out of a descending triangle.



https://imgur.com/a/LTi3U



Volume could be better though. Anyone have any thoughts on the volume? I'm not an expert on this stuff, but shouldn't the volume be higher if it means this is bullish?
Went long at 7700 last night and set a stop at 8300.  I'm new to this game and that was definitely too greedy.  I can't get onto my account for another few hours so can't cash out! 
Was just speaking last night about how I’ve never lost $ on a trade. 

Short from between 7919-7950 with drops at 8245. 

Do you think i should let it ride out? Force close it? Or add to my short if 8200 doesn’t break 

Edit: I wanted to sleep tonight. Damnit 
Any thoughts on the role of the OTC market in yesterday’s action? 
Linear chart broke the resistance from the ATH downtrend. My laptop's battery died so can anyone please tell me what the log chart says?
If you're betting on Bitcoin going back down is now also a good time to enter short some alt ratios?  Or would you expect the alt drops to lag BTC?
Rising wedges, RSI white hot, longs decreasing while shorts increasing and yet the market gives no fucks. This is peak fomo right here. Bears that dont change their outlook soon will get rekt imo. Still not touching a leveraged long though.
Wow. I am at a loss for words.



Is this really what December was like? It's been so long, I had forgotten.



Anyways I think we are gonna stop here. Might be time to short. I am 100% prepared to say that I am wrong. Also I'm gonna stay out of position. I got lucky twice today with longs, my luck will run out if I try it again.


But yeah I think we've got strong resistance at 8,200. Let's hope bulls can push hard.
Seems like the head and shoulders is waving with his right arm.
We spent a lot of time(3rd week January to 3rd week March) between here and 11.7K. There will be a ton of resistance from here on in. I missed the December run-up so now I am all-in and hope to stay that way. Good luck everyone!
When will we stop obsessing over the 2014 and 2018 comparisons? Human behaviour in financial markets might be predictable (in established markets) but let me be the first to say 2018 will be NOTHING like 2014. The same imbeciles comparing today to 2014 will be the same people comparing 2022 to 2018 while hodling empty bags. Get in or FOMO later. There is no other route to the top.
Be warned, ye' bulls

Some signs pointing at one last touch of the macro descending trend line (between $8.5 - 9.1k) and then a pretty hard free fall to new lows.

Another option is $8.3k is all we make it up to, before a hard fall.
Looks like resistance at 8000 is holding.

Edit: I take that back
8100 is proving to be good support the past hour or so. Unfortunately, 8200 is also proving to be firm resistance. We could fart around in this range for a while until either the RSI cools down on the higher time frames, or it dumps out of the rising wedge that we're currently in. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/BEPpWvbw/
Any historical information on effects of political (non-bitcoin) news on prices? I ask because its starting to feel like shit might hit the fan with Trump (firing Rosenstein) or his lawyer pretty soon. Stocks already taking a bit of a hit today.
Shorts have stayed relatively steady (spooked) holding at 24.6k on finex. Longs, after closing on the rise up to 8.2, have increased with this dip and now up to 29k.
ascending wedge on the 15m
Let's hope the the FOMO keeps BTC pumped up.  We cannot afford for people to lose their hope for new highs and the ability to unload.
So my small head and shoulders is playing out on the 30mins despite the dislike and downvotes against it.

Plus some bear divergences pointed out in the earlier thread, and we're still overbought on the larger timeframes (2hr+), and up 12%+ in the last 24hours.

Sorry to kill the bullish mood so soon but i think a short would be a good move here.
Rising Wedge on the 1H. Scaling in sells from 8150-8350.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/BEPpWvbw/
I liquidated my holdings a month ago between 10k and 8k. I thought we would see under 6k and a period of reduced volatility before any strong retracement or reversal. Now I don't know what to do. Any advice? 
Looking at the chart, it seems there is no buying at all. Only selling into the book.
my gut feeling is telling me to keep my shorts open, i've been short for a long time now.. this last push just seemed like a big short squeeze we came up and touched the breakdown level.. now we can go down with everyone who wanted to short out.  
This pump seems fishy as fuck. I honestly don't like it, but the market doesn't give I fuck about what I like. I'm still selling a little bit here. 

I wish I loaded up more in the 6ks, but this pump is one I don't feel bad about missing. It would have been a straight gamble for me personally. 

Selling here seems like less of a gamble given the last 3 months + the batshit crazy pump of the last few days. 

I hate embracing the bear. Ew.
This is looking very similar to the short term reversal from 2014.  Back then it jumped 6%, stayed about the same for a day or two, jumped again, hovered again, repeat.  We're seeing the same thing here where its not pulling back nearly as much as it jumps.  We're probably gonna see another big jump soon once the RSI comes down a bit.
If that effing bear flag could stop teasing me and break down that would be nice.

Engulfing red candle on the 1h, going down from here on buckos.
I was just about to post this bull pennant and then the market flirted with a breakout...

https://www.tradingview.com/x/WDChrrYL/

Target would be ~9k but I think we will meet major resistance at 8.3-8.5k based on previous price action.

I caught the ride from 6.8 to 7.8k and took a nice profit. Staying out of position for now until we’re flirting with 8.3k...

Edit: We are obviously overbought at the moment. But that hasn’t stopped bull runs in the past...
Ok so.... I must have missed something. Is the price ticker gone for everyone or am I accidentally blocking the element?
So buying the dip seems the correct strategy finally again? :)
Reasonably strong bull div detected on 15min

https://www.tradingview.com/x/D59tk3ie/

edit: It's got the look of one which can fail easily enough, it's 50/50 in my book all the same. If alts are bottoming and turning around for a swing here that might give it a shot (depending if they sideways instead of bouncing, then bounce as BTC consolidates, or correlate with BTC again and go up with it).
So is it possible that many of the shorters who got rekt will not go short again, therefore if the price plummets there will not be as many shorts to cover at a lower price, thus leaving a higher probability for a lower bottom?
[removed]
/u/jarederaj could we maybe add Bitmex ticker to the price table?
lol the bears mouths are watering it seems. It's just a classic pull back to higher heights guys
This pump is ridiculous. Cancelled all my higher entry short offers and put my stop just over 8350. 

My own estimation is there is a 95% chance I get stopped out. 

Closed for small profit, layered entries and swing trading is a life saver. 

Edit: fuck off BTC

Come on. Stop this sideway sh**t. 
In traditional markets this is usually the case, the trading done on exchanges is actually quite small when compared to the OTC. I think we can fairly assume this to be the case with bitcoin OTC markets too. 
its too bullish now to even consider shorting. Dont quote me but BTC to 25k by may

Short @ 8128.

SL around 8172.

Targets: 7878 and 7654
So, a handful of whales can change the BTC market trend based on a short squeeze bc its was taking too long for them to get any more gains to the downside and and given their gains already they got bored and took profits. Well, thats not how bull markets starts bc thats not new demand nor organic growth.. Thats naive to think only that will reverse a bear trend. Happy wishful thinking but be cautious.  This will be just more fuel given the smart bears to strike once your all so sure. 
I exited my long - I rode this pump for around 1000 dollars but now the risk/reward is tricky with people predicting resistances and 12h RSI almost overbought (although this indicator is less useful with extreme moves).
And just like that we flew by 8100 res line, don't forget to set stops, folks.
volume pretty strong atm but no clear direction

definitely possible H&S forming on the 15min chart. Such a small time frame so its hard to put any confirmation on it, but it looks like 8162 is the neckline.
Is anyone here still long? I closed my 7100 from 2 weeks ago this morning at the heavy resistance at 8040. Confused by this shooting star.
I sometimes find all these theories about manipulation, FUD, shorts vs longs or tweet knights exhausting.

Price is the product of supply + demand. Do what fits your equation and forget about anyone or anything else.
Anyone see the newer H&S just painted on the 30? or am i trying to hard?
Nice to see green but I’m treading with extreme caution here because nothing really fundamental has changed here.

To me this seems like a fomo brewing for suckers, I’ve already taken profit and am waiting this out. Feeling a downtrend will continue will nice “pull-ups” like this on the way down.

I'll get really worried if we go sub 7.2 but this mini dump happening now rather than later is good. Right?

Making a killing on this little swing region from 8050 to 8125. Shorting the 8105-8125 range and closing at 8055-8075. 

Next short fill I'll keep open but I think we will keep swinging for most of the day. Not expecting a breakout down or up anytime soon. 

Man I have a knack for this shit. Been consistently entering and exiting this short within 5$ of top and bottom. 

Holding now after adding $120+maker to my first short entry 
i dont think its going to do anything good for the sentiment for average buyer dumping at the face of 5 o clock friday. maintaining lower lows here would be a stronger win in bulls turf for the bears one could argue. whatever the result i am not partaking and will be watching with a drink in my hand. as un releated as it may be i like watching the cheaper alts ltc and eth in peak times like this just to observe the noob sentiment on gdax
Lunch Dip. LoL

Regardless if you trust this pump or not, you still missed out on gains if you didn't make a move 

Edit 5/3/2018: I love coming back to look at these kind of posts knowing well I was right :)
The Kraken whale is back! He, she or it tried to hold 8,200 for an extended time with up to $50 arbitrage at some point. The whale just gave up fighting now. I have a feeling we'll see at least a decent correction here from 8,200 and down.

I'm still out of position after closing my long at 7,800
Pretty clear bear divergence on the 1h and 2h charts: https://www.tradingview.com/x/BVLFT158/

I would look to start scaling in a long from 7.7k down to 7.3k. Tentative plan is to flip to a hedge short if we break below 7.3k.
[deleted]
Guys, is this a true statement: whales looking to accumulate as many coins as cheaply as possible bc they're anticipating a new ath this year NEED the price to capitulate with as few short positions open (that are not his own) as possible. This is so there are fewer buyers to compete with them at the bottom. 

If this is true, then the next few days whales should be using every trick in the book to fling shorts around, to the point of giving up. (what are some tricks to do just that?)

u/_chewtoy_ always the voice of reason in here
Why not shorting here till $7,300?

The weekend will be interesting I guess.
I agree that it's too early to panic and so far this just seems like a normal correction/retrace. 

But the market also went from 6.9k to 7.6k in the span of 30 minutes less than 48hrs ago. Whales and other actors can move the market in an instant if they choose to do so. 

I think it's less about a specific price point and more about momentum, i.e., how fast the market is moving in a direction and how much volume is driving it.
It was every time like this in this bear. Last time we went to 10k from 8.5. I actually said couple of days ago that this may hit 8k before going sub 6. Just thought it'll take less time.

Now it's the moment of truth. Either it'll go sideways for a bit and jump back above or it'll continue sideways and fall below 6k.
we do
Keep 'em coming! 
I'm short fairly heavy at about 8160. I also have felt like the downtrend line from ATH will probably be broken if we knock on it this weekend. I'm going to have to bail on this if we break 8300. 
If we knock on the door of the log downtrend in the next few days

Bitcoin: I am the one who knocks
The short squeeze probably added an extra buy pressure that is forcing the price upwards as people start Fomo'ing. If we go sideways for a while it should erode some of that buy pressure as people start believing more in bull trap instead of a bull run. This is the optimal scenario for bull whales to prop the price up since at least now there is some hope around. On the rise to 11k it was pump sideways/downward until next pump. This one seems to have greater buy support, at least while this momentum is kept.
Happened on March 18 too.

It also looks like a bullflag in a bullflag. What do you call this? A moonflag?
Just like in march : https://www.tradingview.com/x/8mkxQWhb/

Love the volume. Hate the fact that it's as organic as the TV show Felicity And Friends.
How did you know to put the purple columns right where I bought some corn?
How can we be overbought after 3 months of bear market? :D
There's also a HS forming on the 1hr but I remember it not meaning shit once during the 8ks and we got a huge pump on the right shoulder. 
Move your green line up a bit and we've already dropped out of the wedge and tested the resistance.

Further movement down highly likely very soon.
For the recent past you are absolutely correct. I just looked back at 2017 and many times we kept rising even during/after a bearish Stoch RSI cross in the overbought zone. I guess it depends on whether the bulls really want to run here or not.
HODL'er here and even I wouldn't be surprised with a dip.  2018 still looks like 2014 to me.  We had these small run-ups back then.
I'll look into it next week. It has to be rebuilt. I haven't added JS to a subreddit before and I haven't looked for the documentation yet.

I'll make it into a repo at github so this doesn't happen again.

If someone does some legwork and finds basic documentation for me to follow I should be able to make short work of it.
Holy shit... it's kinda still working. It uses AutoMods flair. You can see the prices there.
Anyone remember the order of the exchanges on the ticker?
Yeah it could be. Could also be a bear flag after a rising wedge breakdown and a double rejection of the support-turned-resistance (in orange)

https://www.tradingview.com/x/wn9zpd0V/
We're currently in a small bear flag at the end of the bull flag, RSI weakening, but price is still holding strong!
My bullflags bring all the traders to the yard, and im like, i’m hodlin in trezor.
> At what point are we allowed to throw risk management out the window and fomo?

Above 9kish today. Would break the descending trend line.
You are allowed to do that whenever you want.  And will probably result in losses, just like the last several DCBs this year.
This could also be a potential 'head and shoulder' starting to form. Neckline at about 7760 or so.
thanks. mind if I ask why now specifically?
Really good exit point imo. Strong hands to hold it to here nice one.

If that happens all my bitcoin goes in cold storage.
The key is to trade before the move, and let your winners ride
Agreed. Leveraged trading also makes you much more short-term. If you trade unlevered, you are much more likely to ride out the market, which is critical in periods of high volatility.
Definately let your winners ride like /u/L14dy said but if you're looking for strategies to use for closing that winning trade my typical tool has been to wait for a bearish engulfing on longs. (or a bullish one if I'm short. ) So if you're time frame is the 4H for the swing or something let the profits ride until an engulfing happens. 
Reads like these get me all jittery and excited for the next 5-10 years. 

I didnt do nearly as well as i could have in last years bull-run so hoping i can capitalise on the next ones should these hype cycles continue.
$1M per bitcoin is pretty life changing for me.  I have a price target of $40K per bitcoin to finally sell some of my stash and pay off my mortgage.  Close to $100K per bitcoin and I will be able to work on Bitcoin Core full time and quit my job.
So I did search for this yesterday..

One of the comments has gems like this:

> Bitcoin is cancer to the legacy banking and value storage system. Cancers start with a single cell and grow exponentially, sapping all energy from their host until it collapses, slowly at first and then all at once. Sometimes shots of chemotherapy, radiation or frank overgrowth (the most recent manic-bubble) can lead to sharp pullbacks only to set the stage for consolidation, strengthening of underlying architecture and then more spectacular future growth. Each new person that cognitively buys in to the idea of bitcoin and cryptocurrency then becomes its biggest advocate and "infects/transforms" several more individuals, the foundation of exponential growth. 

No one can really comprehend exponents properly. 

Bitcoin is like the perfect ponzi, to replace an imperfect greedy ponzi. ;) As someone here said *"Bitcoin fucks money"*
> The market cycle is moving way faster than the last one

definitely

you know why that is? after each cycle there is more holders than before, and more people that wish they had held
So where can I spend my bitcoin?

Cause I can't use it to buy any products or services from normal stores.
I’m thinking of hedging, and I have no clue why I haven’t done it yet, but every time I put in the trade, my finger hovers over the mouse and I think: Just let it ride.

Every bone in my body says hedge.
> buy the dip.

haven't heard that in a while, bull run confirmed :P
Chewy confirmed it!
Not even hedging at the log downtrend line?
What are your buying targets on the dip? Most seem to be targeting the $7500-$7800 range although I have seen much lower.
> buy the dip.

so you're calling a trend reversal?

Along with the higher time frame indicators, this point (black arrow) is looking more and more like where we might be.  Would love to hear your thoughts.

https://i.imgur.com/GpQ4zrj.png
During the past 4 hours, I show longs/shorts have almost perfectly offset each other? Longs closed during the larger drop.
I just opened a long at 8029. Have no cold stored.

Did the same. (..unconfirmed) Hidden bearish on the 15, feels too soon. My entry is 8008. Excellent call chewy.
if you get stopped at 8.3k won't the RSI be way higher?  Are you saying that it will probably moon even more at that point?
Unless Middle East goes to btc for a safe haven.

build up a smaller short, currently at 8070 USD entry
There’s a higher low from 7700 on that recent drop and we’re not even at 60 on the 1 hour RSI currently.

If this is the reversal people are proclaiming, why would you short here?

Edit: Sorry re-read looks like a hedge against another open long am I correct?
Descending wedge from 11.8 double top, descending triangle from 9k double top. Both broke up . But mostly the shorts
It was possible albeit very difficult. Wyckoff accumulation pattern + high number of shorts.

For example this guy was perfectly on point :

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/3ttcLytn-The-Legendary-Bitcoin-Shorting-Squeeze/
Many here, longs and shorts, were talking about a massive short squeeze for days before it happened. Longs were hoping it would lead to another run for 8200-8500. Again pretty accurate by all accounts.
No.
Anyone who replies with a "yes" is full of shit.

A short squeeze seemed fairly obvious, but that's not really TA.

If people stop obsessing with the daily charts and zoom out to take in the last 3 months, a pretty clear 'adam and eve' bottom is forming. People prefer to sing about ' manurpilation'. 
1D StochRSI

Also we definitely broke above the line you could draw downwards from the past month or so. Compare these two indicators with the last big move up from 6k. 

I was definitely expecting a move up. The intensity of it however I did not. 
The big lines from October converging with down trend from December, and price getting more sideways than bouncy

I posted about those mid April squeeze trends a few days back but yeah I post a lot so I can't find the chart lol
Not any clear indicators that would have told you, THIS is where we will have a bounce to HERE, but a lot of things lining up for a potentially explosive move, with different ways to interpret it as to whether up or down would be more likely. 
Massive number of shorts for one. Not ta but a statistic.
All time high on shorts while price was creeping up through diagonal resistance.
If you’re confident enough it’s going to reach the lower target points why add above 8k? I’m assuming that entry would be the smallest of your entries too 
I've got refills to my long in the same spectrum.
where are you short from?
I don't really know what to expect. But I'm ready for a run-up to $10k or a test of 7k. 
I doubt he was liquidated, much more likely he had stop loss in place or is still holding the position
too soon bro, that was yesterday. Everyone is sitting here scratchin their heads
>/u/MikeXBT from your recent short around 7540, my understanding is you got liquidated around 8100. 

I had stops set at around $8100 but had moved them up a little. Still holding my short from $7640. 
He definitely didn't get liquidated and im fairly sure he actually added at $8200 
Adding on to what others have noticed, a downturn here would also likely lead to a crossover in the overbought area of the daily stoch RSI, which has usually led to some deep dumps:

Thank you for this. Always enjoy reading your analysis
Compelling analysis, thank you.
That big tri could be a bull pennant, but the last time we saw one in this style of bubble cycle it broke down. Time will tell.
Thanks, great analysis as usual. 

Do you give any significance to the fact that the 1D RSI already broke out of its own downtrend? I'm seeing this mentioned on twitter.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/qiLiwIBj/

I guess you could also make that case for early february as well
Always nice to see a beacon in the storm.
I'm still waiting for it to feel bull market
Tin foil hat warning. I saw the idea floated yesterday that it could have to do with the ruble crashing over the last couple days. Rich Russian oligarchs/(semi-)criminals are limited from using a number of other international currencies (due to both threats from within Russia and international sanctions), and so over the last few years have been using bitcoin as an alternative place to store wealth. A little while ago, there was an academic paper estimating that this type of activity contributed a decent chunk to bitcoin's value. It's possible that the ruble crashing led to large panic buys of ETH and BTC. I feel myself entertaining this theory more and more as this begins to look less and less like an "institutional pump"
Yeah one of our papers noted the pump but said "analysts are unsure what caused it". I guess they don't know about shorting lol. 
TA says short the resistance line and the rising wedge.

But the last 26 hours says mooooooon.

(I'm short because I like pain and also because I need to follow my strategy or else I should just hit the roulette table). 
wait. If 8300 get killed... make your decision.
shit that guy is bad luck.
Time to sell
I totally read that as a question without the question mark lol 
He's only trading off chart patterns though. Which, those targets of his are the "rules" for that specific chart pattern. He's not taking into account the log downtrend line which will be heavy resistance. Breaking the log downtrend line and closing a daily candle above it will probably ignite enough bullish sentiment to get to those targets though.
Wow what a contraindictor.  
No he’s not. He doesn’t trade bitcoin and never will because his TA is worth jack shit. 

All he is doing is farming twitter followers and likes. 
Just be patient and you will be good.
ummmmm.... leverage ratio?
Don't we need a break above 11.8 for that to confirm? 
I do think the 6k and 6.5k on the 3D could be seen as an A&E bottom. But it confirms at 12k, so we still have a long way to go.
I'm really curious see how the new sentiment will affect a pull back.  Like how severe it will be, and how long it stays down.  Or will that indicator perform at all and we have no real pull back.

If we drop, I'm expecting lots of buying volume to swoop in compared to previous weeks.  IMO there are positions to add to, and people who missed the first boat getting their second chance, or people with increased confidence trying a DCA.
I think stamp is following bitfinex, where it's not as apparent. It's a possible warning. 

Market is too hot. Needs to go sideways for a while or cool off. I don't see a clear indication that this is what will happen, though. Overall, volume seems to be increasing still.
You mean after the significant rise we had there might be a pull back...many thanks for pointing out the obvious 
Everyone saying be cautious, bull trap, still signs of bear market, will test new lows etc.

This time around a week ago people were saying we were going to test 5.8k then 4k and maybe lower based on the signs. 

We pump.


Good point. 

But it's not just that reason alone (which to me is fairly minor). If we do start a bull run, I believe it's because the $19,600 peak got the attention of some much larger participants who are looking for an entry. With enough of them waiting to pull the trigger, it'll be very difficult to reach "despair" prices (well below $5000). 

However, my buy orders still remain at $6k and below. Whether they get executed or not, I'm happy.
Bull-crap!

Actually I'm 95% with you.
The Herd will be lead to slaughter. Currently the herd is screaming moon hysterically, just as it was screaming 3k at 6.8k. Nothing changes.
Were we gone?!, Welcome
Nice, you got a target for the short term? I almost tethered at 8100 and it wicked almost 8200 now I don't know wtf to do lol. Just kept hearing 8100 as a solid resistance. 
> next time we hit, say, $10k.

Was thinking this last night, a lot of people will wake up again when they see that headline.

*"Oh really, it didn't ded, already, okay, well I better pay attention"*
Less, as last time $10k was an ATH
saw that too on BFX, that's a spicy meat-a-ball
edit: disregard
Do buys like these signal a closing of shorts say opened at 8.2 for some of my bears here? Asking to learn, I wasn't in the short. 
probably wash
Must be Bitfinex itself , this fraud cant go on forever.
The spot where your orange and blue lines intersect at 8.5k seem important to me.  Breaking above that would be significant.  I expect a lot of resistance and a pop in either direction if we find ourselves there.

> this daily thread is massively negative compared to normal

I haven't seen that many negative posts.  You do realize that thinking it is likely that the price will drop is not being "negative".  It's being realistic.
Forgot to get my opioid fix with my btc today. 
If only we knew who produced the opioids... hmmmm
Fake news. Why would you need opium if you already got crypto? #hopium.
No journalistic standard 
Purdue instating a BTC payment option is yuge for merchant adoption!  That’s over 35 billion dollars in payment processing for just ONE drug!    
It's almost like the CIA doesn't have black budgets they need to fill.

While how many US doctors accept Bitcoin?
I find the /r/CryptoCurrency daily is fairly good for that currently.

A little like how /r/ethtrader used to be, before it was overrun by believers.
Even as an altcoiner I don’t want to see this in here. 
my question to this is who would be willing to moderate that thread? Seems like the mods have enough on their hands with the daily and the amount of shilling i would expect with other subs flooding into this new weekly it sounds like a tough job for mods.
>There's currently no other subreddits that are good for rational alt discussion. 

Hmmm... And you want to bring that irrationality here? The amount of work to filter signal from noise in the alt space is ridiculous. We can barely keep up with just bitcoin here. The fact that other subreddits haven't managed to create good alt discussion is probably an indicator that we wouldn't be able to either.

The problem with allowing all alts is that it encourages get rich quick hype spam for the new ICX that's **really** going to usurp bitcoin. The other subs have this problem, and if we made an alt thread, we'd have this problem too. Then we'd have to put in work to police the alt thread, and the quality of discussion in the main bitcoin thread would decline because of the split attention.

If you want better alt discussion, go create better discussion in those subs. Go recruit mods that are similar to us, change those sub rules to disallow memes. Don't try to offload the quality assurance of alt discussion to the mods of the one bitcoin subreddit that manages to stay on topic.

Bitcoin Only Trading, Buying and Holdl since 2014
I have no alts

I sold them all in January. Not planning on buying any back
No alts here 
I hold btc (unless a big crash is obvious), using it to trade very volatile alts (max 1-2 hours hold), don't like the slow ones that you have to hold for a long time to make money.
I hold alts, which are seriously down from my buying price. across my alts alone i'm down about 55% on the total investment. But it's about 3% of my total investment capital so i'm not really worried about it.

Ive been holding btc majority of the time, but now i trade on a daily to weekly basis


I occasionally buy eth and Ltc when I want to mix up trading a bit but as I don't use either outside of trading, I don't hold.
Probably should in the name of diversifying though.

Longterm hold btc only, trading alts to accumulate more btc. 
Yo

I'll be picking up grin but that's years out I think
Well, shorting the local top is the time to do it.  But it's also the time that psychologically you don't want to of course [quite often anyway, unless we are range bound for a while and there is confidence of swings] .  

We do seem to be in a rising wedge now which could give shorters comfort, but it looks like it can play out longer and rise higher before pinching.  If I had a short open below 8.1 I wouldn't be comfortable at all here.
I love the reply to your comment:

"Chances are very low it would go up to your higher targets in one shot without significant pullbacks; don't be afraid to take profit."
Nothing wrong with holding your position. Just be sure to set a stop at a reasonable level so you don't lose profits from a quick dump.
FWIW, I had already taken over half the profit from the same long, from laddered sells.  At 7.8 I also added back to the position when we dipped down, replacing what was sold above 8k.  I'll keep adding scalps to this position as we go up and down until I get stopped out.  Current size is a little over half of what I started with, new CA is 7.1, SL 7.2.
I don't want to fuck around with the IRS so I paid like a chump.   Now part of me thinks I'm on the radar, they better not start tarteting crypro users that could backfire. 
Met with my accountant yesterday to give him my 8949 of every single crypto trade I made last year along with profits from my trades. 166 pages long. I refuse to get fucked by IRS in the future 
Been paying crypto taxes for a couple years. I've made plenty and not going to get greedy and then live with FUD. The likelihood of getting caught is small but you can bet IRS will make highly publicized examples of those they do catch.
Completely meaningless. This just means the tiny sample size of people who use the free credit karma online software to file their taxes didn't have crypto profits. I used an accountant to make sure I paid the least possible. Also even though I went over the threshold coinbase stated by a factor of 20 they never sent me a 1099-K, and neither did Kraken, so the IRS doesn't know about my crypto. I am still paying taxes on it. Better safe than sorry when dealing with these amounts or it will for sure come back to bite you. 
Me too bro. This has to be off right?
Sample bias: how many traders use Credit Karma, vs. their competitor that can import trade data from the exchanges....
Not attempting to pay your taxes is a great way to get proper fucked.
100 in 250,000 sounds about right tbh.  Not that many people are trading; in the bubble I'm sure more than that were buying, but it doesn't mean they've sold.  Plenty of others are just ignorant about the tax situation.

Extrapolating from 100 in 250,000, there are 140,000,000 US taxpayers, so that means **54,000 people declared crypto gains in the US.**  Crypto is still a niche thing, so it doesn't seem unreasonable that there are roughly that many 'traders'.  I'm sure it's under-reported (certainly not over-reported!), but by how much is really hard to say.

Pay your taxes.
I paid my crypto taxes. Cost me $380 for my CPA, and best part is he does ETH mining so makes it easier in understanding the pains of crypto trading.

Also the peace of mind of if I get audited, it’s his problem.
Not every crypto owner has gains to report every year, so that might be part of it. Some of them might genuinely not know they need to report or, or know how to report it and hope they don't get caught.

Other people just think they can get away with tax evasion.
I barely made that much after this crash and I paid over $3000 yesterday. Hope I did it right
You might get stopped and it bounces back up... Its a dangerous place for a stop. But its better a little profit than no profit. 
So much risk for a very small profit.
it happens from time to time.  Impressive when you consider the lack of margin trading on Binance.
Problem is folks have short memories. I'm king of fomo right now. I keep cancelling buys as my sensible head is fighting the greedy one. Fortunately I'm shooting a wedding today so my mind will be elsewhere.

I saw you got downvoted but damn, we need objectivity. The huge number of shorts and their being rekted yesterday is one glaring reason for the objectivity.
> Nothing massive has changed here.

Maybe the 1500 USD spike itself was not bullish (fomo, shortsqueze) but what preceeded it was slightly bullish. Bears had all the time in the world to push us below 6k. They tried 10 times to go below 6.5k, but failed each time. There was nobody to sell below that price (panic sellers already sold, hodlers don't want to sell so cheap, etc.). Since nobody was left to sell at that price on spot markets, margin shorts were pilling up. But even with shorts at ATH they still could not get price down. **This** seems bullish for me. The 1500 USD price jump is just a secondary effect (and typical bitcoin over-re-action).
Any "bear" or "bull" market is at one point suddenly over. We have accumulated nicely the last few days. I am expecting the uptrend to continue. But as any random TA specialist on Twitter would say: There is a chance we go up and a chance we go down.
Just wait for a breakout then bet the opposite direction :p
Maybe you should scale into the positions rather than opening/closing in one shot.

You could scale piecewise into both a short and a long.  When the price is between their spread they'll both be in profit.  You can then commit to one later, or use the other as a hedge.  Possible to profit on both positions if you keep adding to one as you take profits from the other, if you think that the price will eventually swing the other way and retrace the same range anyway.  Doing this is more efficient and IMO safe than trying to call the top and bottom and switch from long/short (again, *if* you think the range is going to get traced back and forth)
Losses... losses for month after month. I got a lot better at cooking and dumped all that money into BTC instead. There were several times where I accepted that I was probably flushing my money down the toilet. I bought then, too.
I specifically remember saying "*as long as we stay above $500 we are fine*" (worked for ~2 months during that pump, but obviously we dropped below it after that for over a year, lol.)

In comparison, it could mean we go as high as 11-12k now over the next 2 months though (680/1175*20000 = 11.6k.) And go into a bear market again with new lows after that.

edit: however, I do think the market is a bit different, assuming Willybot gox manipulation (no, I do not believe Tether is the same) and much much more media attention. But making comparisons can be always interesting.
I was.

I did not buy because I was disenchanted in btc, having bought most at $10, but then totally ruining my CA by buying the top at $1000 and ending in the red for years.

The few trades I did try back then had losses that I am now beginning to recover, but did not get margin called.  It's when i first started trading, to try to compensate for the shitty buying the top but without putting more money in.
I
Yes that pump to 680 faked me out.  It was total manipulated bullshit and should have been obvious at the time, but they got a bunch of my money on that one.
you're a lucky idiot. lol. only in crypto do you get lucky like this. but don't continue to be an idiot. trade smart next time. but congratulations is in order. good luck on your future trades.
What the fucking fuck man.  Less than 2 weeks ago you were asking for some tech support about your accounts setup.  Then you make a streak of successful trades, and now this profitable fuckup.

You are the luckiest trader here! :)
Yeah, on kraken we have to be careful with the orders as they only get added/subtracted to the current position. If the position is already closed than a new position is open on the opposite direction 
It's possible imo, loads of coins have been bought around 6.5k~. All of those people don't feel any pressure to sell right now.
$8200, $8600 and $9000 are some resistances I'm keeping my eyes on. They could be pitstops if we rally hard, but I suspect we'll bounce off of one of them before retracing somewhat. 
already happened :P
I don’t really understand these comments. Yeah that would be case in a normal market but why the hell does it matter when a single whale can push up the price by $1000 in one hour like they did yesterday?
Start looking now, chasing 2% a day is a quick way to lose. Job security over anything else
Let's put some numbers on your dreams.

2% per day is 1377x per year, or 147x just working on business days.

To understand your risk we need to know how much you put at risk per trade (%), what your payoff is (%) and how often you are right (%). And we need to know that with a decent sample size. Then we can know your risk of ruin (and incidentally, your optimal bet size).

Notice, if you withdraw capital as income during that time, your return will not compound.

If you really achieve that sort of return without blowing up, I take my hat off to you, sir.
2% per day?

yeah buddy... you need a job

What happens when you start incurring losses
Jeez man, i hate to be negative but this sounds awful. In my opinion there is no such thing as easy money so without a decent income trading is pointless. I think there are too many people that believed Crypto is a Cinderella story that will change everyone from rags to riches.

Really don't think it will on this leg, the downtrend line from ATH is in between first

you start by losing money

good luck
First piece of advice: don't. Second piece of advice: really, don't. It's not worth the mental and emotional drain for a few bucks. The odds are you will lose. It is a zero sum game and you are competing against people with hundred million dollar stacks that can manipulate the market, and traders with decades of experience.

I've learned the hard way that most of the time the best trade is to sit out of the markets and watch. Every once in a while a super obvious trade comes along with a high reward/risk ratio. Those are the one's to jump on. But it takes a substantial amount of patience and wisdom to consistently execute profitable trades. And it takes a substantial amount of time and energy to keep track of the market. Even the most successful traders lose a large portion of the time. /u/_chewtoy_ loses on >40% of his trades, but his wisdom of the markets and risk management strategies keep him profitable.

Managing your risk is essential. Only trade with a small portion of your stack. Set clear targets/stop losses and deeply ponder if the trade's reward is worth the risk.

Research TA. Read this sub like it's a religion. 

If you believe in bitcoin in the long term, dollar cost average in and long term hodl. Otherwise, day trading is probably not worth it for 99%+ of the population.

Technical Analysis and Stock Market Profits by Richard Schabacker
First piece of advice: Don't listen to people who tell you you're too stupid to be successful at something. You are perfectly capable of trading after educating yourself with trustworthy resources and exercising conservative judgment.

Second piece of advice: Seriously, ignore /u/smittywerbenjagerman. You'll be fine.

Take a look at [Chart Guys] (https://chartguys.com/) for immediate exposure. If you want a more robust exposure, check out free open courseware through Yale, MIT, Stanford, etc. [Here](https://oyc.yale.edu/) is one.

Good luck and don't let naysayers keep you from doing anything but plunging into the Thames.
Don't. It's not worth it man.
Get rekt then you learn. I started margin trading and hit 80% loss (mostly due to not knowing how to use bitmex properly and also longing like a moron near major resistance).  Up 300%+ now on my trading stack. Missed the big run up but at least 
I'd be amazed if anyone here was beating [HodlBot](https://HodlBot.io).  If you want to do it as a fun, less lucrative hobby go for it, but don't trade to make money vs. other much more reliable methods.  There's a reason Warren Buffett [won this bet](http://fortune.com/2017/12/30/warren-buffett-million-dollar-bet/) so easily.  Trading is extremely hard, even for hedge funds which specialize in it and have resources we could never dream of.

Anybody here with over a 4x gain in BTC?  If I remember right Chewtoy said he is at 400% starting from a long time ago and he is like the best of the best traders here.  Real life results for almost every single person here will be so much worse than that (breaking even is harder than you think).  The time drain alone spent watching charts is incredible.  I am almost certain a second job at Burger King and all the salary invested in crypto would come out miles ahead.
I am
I mean its not terrible, but imo its quite bad r/r. Whats your target?
Nothing wrong with it as long as you got stops above 8.1
Get comfy on the boat we share with u/Coingurrruu 

What's your target for your short? 
Good R/R, I think. Bearish divergences, multiple sources of resistance overhead, overbought on most timeframes, and we are completely outside of the 12 h BB, which apparently bitcoin hates.
btw how do you get the resistance at 8220 ? I have it at 8180

https://www.tradingview.com/x/pYJUGCNW/
So I take it you're still expecting around $8400 to be the top?  I decided to layer into a low leverage short CA @$8250 with stops at $8500 (wicks have been a bitch) at which point I'll jump right into layering into a higher leverage bet at the ATH line.  That about your plan too?  

I'm still not totally convinced of this support turned resistance line but your r/r argument convinced me that it's worth a shot to not miss the drop.
keep shorting

be sure you have $$ to cover
The last few months have been the least emotionally taxing of my entire time in crypto. Better than wondering when the fuck the whole thing is going to fall apart because there is so much dumb money.
Crypto isn't 'under attack' from Google, Facebook, twitter 

If you were a company which depended on advertising for all of its revenue you would also stop advertising cryptos to avoid being associated when things go wrong, ie scam ico's.

They are protecting themselves, not going out to attack crypto
I, too, state my bullshit as facts.
Only in sideways movement. Or when signaling the trend by getting pinned
Does market gives a shit about divergences, because I am seeing hell a lot of them 
We'll retest the downward trend from 20k on the ~~linear~~ log scale and then we'll know for sure.  Current decision point is in the high 8ks, around 8700 by my estimates.  We'll climb at least that high over the next week, then either have a massive leg down or a massive leg up as we either bounce off resistance or crush through it.
Well done
I would definitely hedge right here if I had such a comfy long. At least for the same size. At worst you've locked in profit from 6.8-8.1 and lose nothing. Stop above 8.3. Thinking of making this short trade tbh. 
noob ichimoku question, how do you get this type of cloud? By using the default ichimoku in tradingview, I don't have your chart at all. 
I'ma rather play it safe. Short term bear, long term bull this year.
I'm not really convinced by the H&S (30 min, bounced of the neckline around 7750 with a wick higher than the right  shoulder close). This [bull flag](https://www.tradingview.com/x/CQ1sCIru/) is very large though and the bear div could take us to 7500 and we would still be inside it. I would be very surprised if we broke up before cooling down the RSIs. Trading the top and bottom of the bear flag could be an idea but it works until it doesn't. Tight stop all the way
Don't be too impatient imo, big money has very little concern about your financial well being... In fact their job is to rekt us. 
I think this is pretty moon if we grow from here. Not at this pace but you get it.
Eh, we were definitely due to retrace and blow off some shorts. I mean look at the fucking ETHUSD chart. That thing just went basically straight down
Agreed. Especially with yesterday's pump. The rate this is increasing right now is insane. It's like early december all over again
I agree that it's looking good, but believe it or not [we are still in a downtrend.](https://imgur.com/a/0v1K2)
I saw bitcoin drop to the $200's in 2015 with the Mike Hearn shit.  I know Bitcoin is much stronger now, but don't be so confident.
so you said nothing again...
Shouldn't we see a lower low?
The run-up wasn't as steep as 2013, when we compare the 2017 run-up to the 2013 one and subsequent bear markets (we *are* in a bear market BTW), I think we should keep in mind that this bear market shouldn't be as long-lasting or brutal. At least *on paper*, it shouldn't as long-lasting or brutal. 

No way to tell what will actually happen, though. I'm betting on $6k being a the bottom for what remains of the year. In case of some brutally bad news or an exchange hack, I hope against hope that the price not drop below $5600. Time will tell.
What about the pullback from the first 2013 bubble?

There are enough possible fractals at play that leaning into one requires you to willfully ignore the others that don’t suit your narrative.

I’m sure we’ll look back and say 2018/19 has striking fractal similarities to what has happened in the past, but good luck trading based on it.
At some points mods banned the word Tether from this sub because it was getting out of hands. I know it's radical but we should maybe ban 2014... seriously get over with it now.

Open Coinmarketcap check how was 2014 and check how is 2018, you'll see some slight differences and not only on BTC/USD price.
This is completely wrong.
I was quite diappointed for missing the huge oppotunity yesterday, I wasn't in front of my laptop and my mobile wasn't responsive when I needed it.

I am a bit relieved today after breaking even from before the pump as I had turned bearish at the wrong time. 

I am expecting the price to touch 7700 before the markets close.
[deleted]
If we can hold and not drop too much further and recover slowly it’ll be a wonderful sign. Personally, I just added more to my long that I had open from 8k. 
reversal have to start.. somewhere..
it's already been a drawn out 2.5 months since the start of the bear market, I guess only time will tell
No rise means anything until we break out from the 20k descending log trend line. Until we do that convincingly, the Bear Market continues. 
You could be right, however look at the volume in this rise compared to the other rises you mentioned. Notice a difference?

I was expecting a dip to 7500. Still have a hunch it will. Maybe pumping to 8200 like it has won't spook people when it does / if it does. 
H&S isn't significant on smaller time frames, and even then you need to wait for it to break the neckline before it matters. 

Don't forget about the massive iH&S that got denied a couple of weeks ago. 
Last night there was a clear head and shoulders forming on the 15/30 minute. It played out pretty nice until we failed to break the 7750 neck line and bounced off there. Opened a short at the top of the right shoulder and got screwed.

With the high volume and relentless bulls and the shorter time frame I wouldnt bank on it. If the right shoulder forms and the neck line breaks it could be a great chance for profits. 


Edit: Like you pointed out the bear Div’s would help make the H/S’s more playable. But this exact thing happened last night and now look where we are
Don't forget the rising wedge with the overbought 4hr. RSI with clear bear divergences! If I was on an exchange where I could short, I'd be shorting here.

8050 is holding about as well as 8200 is getting rejected. Momentum is the difference here and it's on the bull side. 
Had a spot sell order at 5800 euros to catch a pump in case. Went out to buy lunch and the price was at 6500 euros. I've been waiting for a retrace since but am starting to wonder if it will actually happen.
Fear got the best of you my friend
Holding with S/L and watching, 6,600 could've very well been "the bottom" for now and it's too risky to sit on the sidelines right now imo
It all depends on what type of trader you are. 

Personally I scalp because that's what I'm good at. I think of myself as a reactive trader, so longer time frames are harder for me to enter and exit comfortably.
I used to trade the 100s pretty successfully but it's just not worth the effort for a potential several hundred dollars daily. Just trade bigger swings and you'll be better in the long run
What's your process?
you must be new

1. Blocks are mined, your tx is confirmed
2. difficulty is adjusted to adhere to a 10m block tome on average, average being the operative word. I think this means that the 0.5-quantile lies at t=10m
3. mining a block follows the exponential distribution, so it can take far longer than 10m to mine a single block
4. The expected time it takes to mine 1 block is 20minutes
5. The answer to your question is variance. there is a non-zero probability that it will take another hour to mine that block

Short/Long ratio is the more important thing to watch.
If low leverage then you are likely in good shape (the candle from yesterday is indicative of at least a short term turnaround).

However to be honest about my current strategy, I am in wait and see mode. Strong buy < 7500.... Realistic buy in the 7600s.

Note whenever I open a position I use a small percentage of total stack to allow for continuous buys down to draw down my cost average.

I'm not thinking of charts here by the way just gauging market sentiment mixed with my observations. In theory the market at any moment has an ideal correct choice (up or down), I'm not going change that opinion based on the types of candles I look at. I think of candles as a way to judge filter noise more than anything else.

tl;dr: No position at the moment, in observation mode. I expect to be inclined to open a long in the 7600 ish area. Am short/medium term bullish regardless.
Will go sub 7K tommorow.
to the moon because shorts are higher than longs /s
Annoys me on bitcoin wisdom a lot too.
Yeah that bug has existed for a long time, not sure why it does it.
Best way is to calculate it yourself. They don't provide that kind of historical data, but it's pretty easy to do i.e. with a TradingView script. There's a symbol BTCUSDIDX which tracks the okex index. They don't have the eth index, so you'd have to recompose it yourself or just pick one major spot exchange for a rough idea.
Damn. I've had that happen before, and it's tough. But hey, looks like you're trading using good judgments when it comes to purchase price.
I hate just missing those. I've started layering at least in thirds, even if the layers are only $10-30 apart from one another.
1h-4h was all overbought, i'm fairly bullish still but i'm still shorting these retrace. i'm calling the 7750-800 the bottom.
Bagholders gonna baghold.
Human nature won't stop until it hits a wall as big as 500BTC, which lies somewhere in the $7700. I expect it to go down further.
When there is enough buying pressure, yes!
Looks like there is for now...
Gonna back down to upper 6ks by June then start next humongous bull run.

Gonna be a good summer.
When someone linked this a couple of weeks ago it's when I stopped shorting and just starting doing longs. Yes, i got burned on a few but my last one was from 6550 to 7.9 so i was happy with that. I do think this pump feels different, retail investors are now looking curiously and the fact that we haven't gone back down and add to it, dips seem to be eaten up fairly quickly along with my other sentiment guides I think this could be something special. I have a long open again from 8k with very low leverage and a stop at 7.2
Reasonable and interesting arguments, good luck to you.
How do you know if there is accumulation vs. trading?
You can't really call it accumulation when you see simple selling...sub $7k looked a bit more like accumulation- this just looks like profit taking and people trying to catch the bottom of the dip

also where are you seeing the ratio increase? It's staying pretty much the same. 

Shorts only added like 1.5k btc over this dump whereas 5-6k btc were sold. 
I honestly think no one could give the slightest shit about such irrelevant “news” from India’s crypto world. They currently account for a tiny piece of the overall cryptomarket pie and their government’s head figures are absolutely clueless as to how cryptocurrencies work. Bchitcoin of all things would be a more worthy topic of discussion.
8000? Too early...
You mean on today's 1D candle?
Just curious, why June and not Sept? I never understand this. Sept futures are inherently more valuable because you have more time to decide if you want to hold or close your position. If June and Sept are at the same price like now, why buy June?
2 days ago you were bearish and making fun of people who were bullish. Yesterday you were short term bullish. Today you're full bull. Make up your mind.
> while shorts were more and less stable

Probably needs to reach the point where people are brave enough to short every top, so they're shorting everything all the way to 17k or so in disbelief before FOMO at the top.

Sideways or down would both teach people to be a bit more brave, a bit of repetition and a few wins doing the same thing over and over might finish it.
No
Which would bring it right to the log line? 
No longer a will be.  There was a strike.  

Edit:  maybe the dip was a just a fear reaction of war?  Seems like the worst may be over for now
Distraction from Cohen
We had some kind of relevant discussion earlier today:

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8bwesq/daily_discussion_friday_april_13_2018/dxbrp6y/
It's probably a good thing for gold, it's not clear if BTC is a hedge against anything or just a speculative investment asset still so the effects of geopolitical instability on BTC are unclear. 

Also, Trump is either a madman or a fool but hopefully every NATO jet preparing to bomb Syria burns up and falls out of the sky. 
BTC rise only when missiles are flying Japan, not Syria.
But to stay out of the topic as well: I won't recall the number of time this idiot called Clinton on the wars topic our Obama to stay out of Syria. Let's destabilise the world a bit more...yay..

edit: Just read that my country (France) is following up on this idiot behaviour by striking too. Yay. Fucking ass-holes.

So next message will be .. please go up soon so I can sell?

I don’t have anything against TA but I mostly use macro indicators like world events, regulatory news, etc. I’m long term. 
Fibonacci lines, RSI, Bollinger Bands, and Gann Box occassionally if there's a big drop.
Ichimoku and bbands
A modified RSI and MACD. I'm generally looking for market sentiment and direction versus short-term range trading. Minimum timeline I use is 4H, but 1D and 3D candles are great too.

>Most likely we stay at 7900-8100 range

Knowing that my luck, that my highest buy order is at $7800, and that my lowest sell order is at $8200... I think we just might spend a considerable amount of time there. 
nice move...
Nice job holding onto your short. I chickened out and closed mine for break even. Didn't expect Bart to reappear
Perhaps a temporary rejection of $8040?
8050 broke on Binance after being tested a handful of times today. 

8k about to be tested.

8050 broke on Kraken and I’m not sure about Finex and such. How you feeling now? Maybe a strong bounce off 8k?

Edit: Wow. Incoming 7.9k 
Good call
was finally able to close my short! feels good man
Markets don't like to exactly repeat themselves very often. I'd hold off on making any assumptions about this.
Then boom , sub 7K 
Possible, my take however is that everyone is holding in hope of a greater price to sell, but just a little push down and everybody will unload again. Very similar to 9.2. If big money isn't interested in this price it will go down, also this pump was a one time event, technicals are back in play and they don't favor further upward without shorts to squeeze. R/R : short.
Yeah I agree, but the Europeans only like to blame us when things are going down
The thing is that the chance we found a bottom is higher, both because we went lower and for a longer time. This is not a dip & bouce with news the background (g20), it's a rally after we were locked in a range for days which shows support and probably accumulation. Doesn't mean it is **the** reversal, but people/whales will probably be more confident with long positions.
The most obvious difference to me is the longer accumulation/consolidation at 6.4-6.7. The buy walls there were definitely not spoofy, whoever bought at that range was not scalping. Maybe they dump on our heads right here or maybe they made off like a bandit as we soar to dizzying new ATH's.

Also, bears/shorters (including myself) reached peak mania.
the massive volume that started this pump is the biggest difference. Also, you may have noticed other people point out that this looks like an Adam&Eve double bottom forming, which if thats the case we could expect the run to continue higher from here over that next couple weeks
The pump back then happend over a longer period of time % wise compared to what we saw yesterday



I think a TON of uncertainty has been cleared up since the start of the year. Enough good news has happened that has left people wondering if news even matters anymore. It honestly just seems like a timing thing in my opinion. People started by saying the whole Chinese new year thing, then easter sunday would bring in money, now tax season and Q2 will start the bull run. Either way I think people are just looking for the right time to buy in. BTC deathcross, uncertainty of a long term bear market is over in my opinion. 
Have you already started building a position or only above 8300-8500?
Yeah, hopefully we get a real breather before going up some more.
Can't via mobile?
If we get another pump like yesterday you might just get stopped out. Best of luck.
I shorted 8150 today, not feeling very confident about this. But I just have to trade this divergences
Wouldn't be surprised at a wick to 8.3 before the hammer drop (if there is one). The prospects of a big dip right now seem bleak with the relentless buying of dips I'm seeing. 

Personally I wouldn't add, if we fall with any conviction here your 7.9 short should be in profit anyway. Why double down on potentially being wrong?  
Depends on your budget I guess. The strategy of adding shorts is obviously good, until it breaks and you lose it all :)
Good question. I also haven't seen a Tether report in some time.
relevant, if your post isn't in reaction to that :

We should touch the descending log line at ~8650.

After evaluating for a while I concluded : TO THE MOON 
If BTC went down in substantial way alts would immediately follow, just like every other time BTC has had a substantive drop.
I think I just came.
Thanks genius, slowly scaling into a short here.

Not even close. This is kind of like "wtf :')", December was like "WHAT THE FUUUUUUUCK"


December was a steady climb and a "Jesus how the hell does it keep going up"

This is "hmmm, interesting..."
lmao
What does h&s pattern mean? Up or down from here?
I liked where your comment was going until the mask was pulled off in the last two sentences revealing a moon kid underneath. I'm not saying you're wrong, but "Get in or FOMO later" isn't necessarily the best trading advice
Obsessing would be stupid, but comparing makes sense.

Bitcoin/crypto was in a bubble and it did pop. Of course comparing it to the previous bubble can be interesting. In fact, I would hope someone actually does the real effort of overlaying them and make a proper analysis (I am too lazy for that.)

That being said, market is different and "betting it all" on this comparison would be very stupid.
Username checks out. Hopium is a hell of a drug, kids.

Trade sober.
The previous goalpost for this sentiment was 7.5k.
More like retest of 7.3-7.5 new lows are not very likely right away. Would take weeks to break through the support we built down there
!remindme 2 weeks
Define new lows. < $6k?
We make it thru this huge area of resistance to free fall to NEW lows? That would be below 6k.
If by holding you mean "*completely and utterly demolished*" you'd be right.
What chart are you watching? Maybe you mean support?
nope
We are below 8100 though
Are you short? 
This also matches up with the $8400 target everyone is saying it may hit before dumping like the 2014 move upward 😳
It is very hard to say conclusively because sometimes correlation doesn't equal causation, but there are a few examples where news seemed to be a bit of a catalyst.

Most recently when Donald Trump won the election unexpectedly, Bitcoin surged, as did gold, while the futures markets for the stock market sold off hard.... but in less than 48 hours all of this had reversed.  Nevertheless it was pretty clear that there was a reaction to this news.

The most common type of news which seems to catalyze Bitcoin prices relates to financial crisis.  Runaway inflation, runs on banks, etc.  The events in Cyprus were credited for a major bull run and then the more recent issues in Greece were also included in many news stories about why Bitcoin prices might be rising.  In both cases I don't think people in those nations were buying enough Bitcoin to move the price, but I do think events like that make people think about money itself and the reasons we use it and trust it and the potential problems with government issued dollars.

I think there have been some kneejerk bumps in prices when missiles have been launched or an unexpected war seemed more likely, but really I haven't seen any sustained price movements based on wars or rumors of wars.  I could imagine a speculative bump on future news like that, just traders looking for something that might react to the news sort of creating the effect they are betting on.
the main thing I look for in terms of political news are things that would have an impact on the inflation rate of currencies. one of BTC's use cases is to move money out of countries, this is called capital flight. if people in a certain country think that a political event has the potential to devalue their currency, they could be motivated to explore options to convert their currency into something else. that's where BTC comes in. the Russian ruble dropped a bunch in the last couple of days. coincidence? who knows... (well, the OTC desks, they might know)
Looks like you might get a chance to short 8.2. You got your sell limits placed? 
breaking down now
Who is upvoting this crap?
You are always short...
Not disliking your analysis because it is bearish, but because you are calling out a formation which has yet to form the full pattern (general volume profile for this pattern does not fit the volume that I see on the charts atm), much less complete (break below the neckline). Doing something like this can skew your perception of the charts, leading you to take trades that you would otherwise never do, aka gambling.
You mean having climbed 12% in 12 hours that the price might drop a little (or a lot)?.... I would never have thought that possible
Neckline is at 7750, so still not confirmed. It's also on the 15/30m, which gives it significantly less merit - if any at all. 
I saw your chart but why are you cutting through the wicks at 7750 to draw your neckline?
Its a bull flag. *obviously* not per this abstract TA, but it is.
there is a clearly visible Adam and Eve which is a reversal trend in the 4h. But we have not broken log resist . So it depends how much risks you want. I personally would buy. But you may want to try seeing if it can break through log resist first. 
Don't try to time the market

Everyone likes to buy their bitcoin within the same exact 60 minute window like yesterday and at no other times. It's called organic growth.
Both sides are looking really weak atm (mostly checking binance). It's taking ages to break walls, even small ones
That chart has to be zoomed out so far just to make this year follow the basic outline of 2014. None of the smaller dips and pumps actually follow each other. Idk that chart seems like an attempt to make it fit rather than something someone actually saw. Looks like someone used #8 paintbrush on MS paint to draw the candlesticks if those even are candlesticks. Weird mix between candlesticks, trend line and fractals idk
Do people like you never get tired of spouting nonsense like this?? TA is coinflip and using an old chart to predict something is ridiculous..
What bear flag? I keep seeing people refer to bull flags and pennants as bear flags lately. 
Bear flag inside a greater bull flag, usually bigger pattern overrides the small one
OracelSeven confirmed! HA, you gave it away D: 
Dont think we have broken through just yet. Think we will go down from here and paint it for a bit longer.
It's gone
plot twist

what if we are still in the dip?
Best time to buy was last week. Good time to buy is right now if youre just following a DCA strategy. Still not a good time to go all in though.
Roughly 60BTC bought @ 7920, then another 60BTC @ 7940, 140BTC in 25mins.. another 60BTC.. 160BTC in 25mins..

BOOM 166BTC in 5mins. .... 190.... 280....
Not a lot of volume yet, but it seems to be hitting, up 100 anyway.
what did the longers do during the drop after they got rekt for the first time? did they just stop longing? 
people will always bet (after they lick their wounds) and there will be always new people to make a bet

So much for your knack.
Ridiculous? Naaah.  Watching BTC go from 10K to 19K in January in like two and a half days was ridiculous. This is nothing. 
did not even notice a change. use reddit enhancement suite and disable subreddit style
You can still use the old one i think
When I try to use the new reddit there is a ~20hr delay on the site. 

So for example I would not be able to see this thread at all or any of the comments. The previous daily thread would have comments up to this trailing point in the past which is roughly 20 hrs before now.
Is it the sub style?

RES has this "Subreddit Style Off" button which strips those.

Though reddit did change something right?
Ugh, I really hope they work out the bugs before forcing everyone to use it. I turned it on for a hot minute then reversed.
resistance is more in the 8200 - 8300 area.

Let's see what happens after the 8000.

No, you need to report your gains as per 1.1.2018. Any losses incurred in 2018 will be filed as a loss in 2019

I've thought about this a lot - is it really possible to trade with such a tight SL? I mean 44 bucks upwards is completely a matter of luck. You could be right about the direction, but still get stopped on out more than 50% of your attempts?

Big players have manipulated the silver and gold markets for decade, and those are trillions $ market. You really think they can't do it to bitcoin? 15k out of 25k btc bought yesterday were short squeeze. It makes perfect sense for a market maker to take advantage of the situation. 
100% Agree.

That nice Pop Up yesterday was not in any TA - H&S, Shorts / long. etc.etc.

Edit: Maybe this Pop up yesterday is the start for a reversal - Up

Yesterday was one fucking huge demand alright. Not manipulation at all. Like those huge supply dumps. Yep, supply and demand. Totally organic market. 
Yes everyone sort of decided together yesterday, that's it we are buying bitcoin and we ended up needing 35k BTC. Legit. 
TA doesn't matter rn. This is just FOMO
I saw a Head and Shoulders like formation but, like most others, it failed. 



Actually it was within a descending triangle so that's probably why. 


And that was all within a bull pennant depending on who you ask. I can get behind the bull pennant idea but that would require drawing a line from the top of the wick and idk about that
Screenshot? I cant find it.

Honest question, what are examples of fundamental changes that would make you feel different?
Honestly I disagree here, since this market is lot more driven by sentiment than fundamentals. If this wouldnt be the case, please explain to me what fundamental changed on 17th December that made BTC freefall? Nothing really. 12th April also nothing changed, but you just don't know, whether it wont be the start of semi-recovery.
Good for bitcoin.

Just haven't gotten around to the bear case yet. I'm only 5% in on my trading stack. I was hoping to get a larger position when I made that trade. We're not pulling back for me to do that, though.
It's a relatively important support zone, but it's really no big deal if the market oscillates above and below it for the next few days.
Indeed as that's an old reliable log resistance. If it turns into support then, well, that's obviously bullish
Agree. That 7750-7800 range has acted as strong resistance turned support. I’d expect that to hold and would be skeptical of this run if it fell. A fall below 7.6 and this would be a pretty significant failure on the bulls behalf imo. 
I'm watching 7800 as well.
Put a stop profit at 8180 imo
Because the market could bounce very hard off of $7,800 or $7,500 and not get anywhere near $7,300. 
probably cause bitcoin does whatever it wants sometimes and shorting  the beginning of a possible reversal isn't always worth the risk/reward 
good plan
not gonna lie, I FOMO'd into a long right at that level. (I know, I know) I'm still feeling fine about it, how are you feeling about your short? genuinely curious about your sentiment
good trade, are you taking profit now?
[deleted]
Let's hope it kicks the door down in lieu of knocking.
~9k ;)

Steer flag?

It seems to be very comfortable in this range, Bollinger Bands are tightening in lower time frames, but the RSI on the higher time frames is still warm-to-hot, and agree that we have more consolidation to go before a break.  With the reduced bear volume on the 1H & 4H, my guess is that it will go up when the time comes. 
Ya, it's not completely unheard of. It's just not the norm.
So, hypothetically, a $50MM over the counter buy isn’t organic? 
If not /s, stoch RSI is calculated differently

https://www.tradingview.com/wiki/Stochastic_RSI_(STOCH_RSI)

key relevant passage:

> When using the Stoch RSI, overbought and oversold work best when trading along with the underlying trend. ... During a downtrend, look for overbought conditions for points of entry.


How can we be oversold after like 15 months of a bull market? :P time frames. I know you were joking but I actually have seen this question before
not sure where you're seeing that other than chopping off the wick, which would still have us in the wedge riding the support of it

e: now I see it, not sure I think it's more plausible but worth noting I guess

https://www.tradingview.com/x/uUHNktaL/
as noted in the tradingview wiki link before it tends to work well with the trend--I haven't looked at it but I'm guessing oversold crossings in 2017 correlated strongly with a rise back up
It's the people who trade the short time frames that are getting burned, regardless if you trust this or not, you Def had a great chance at some good gains
Afaik you can't use JavaScript on Reddit. You have a script in any language that builds an image every x minutes and then uploads it into the subreddits css page. 
I'm not him obviously, but $7,800 has a pretty high potential to serve as support and could very well be the lowest this dump goes.
>thanks. mind if I ask why now specifically?

I don't expect it to get much lower within the expected time frame. $7800 looks to be reasonable short term support. 
I got in well before the pump, but the order books were jumping all over the place once it hit 7.5k. It made me panic a little, expecting 7.7 to be the top of a long wick once the FOMO calmed down. I've exited so many winning trades at breakeven after letting them ride too long, Its hard to achieve the right balance.

For me, finding good entries is actually pretty easy, but exits are really tough.
If you believe Bitcoin will stick around, it's near impossible for it to not have these hype cycles during price discovery

Blockchain does indeed have cancerous traits. Especially by enabling corruption and crime to spread.
Nice, I was looking for that chart.. it's my favorite chart. Best ponzi scheme ever made, a ponzi that actually works, and it hands out dividends once in a while... I mean, people still work?  
When people are using bitcoin in normal stores after it’s convenient and practical to do so... the price is gonna be over 100K. Be glad you can’t, this shit doesn’t happen overnight 
I recommend using Gyft to buy Amazon gift cards. Most convenient method so far. 
Follow your heart, it’s the only compass you need. 
Confirmed what exactly? 
Probably not honestly. If the market bounces off the log trend line and dumps back below $7,000 — well then that's another story. 

But I'm certainly not planning to open a short in the $8,000 to $9,000 range *assuming* the log trend line will hold. 

Resistance lines rarely hold on the 4th attempt. If the market does make it back up there, I'd actually say there's a better chance it will break than it will hold.
I pretty much never set orders preemptively. 

I'll be looking for a dip down to $7,300 - $7,500 followed by reclamation of $7,800 as support. 

It's quite likely I'll be opening my next long position above $8,000. But if that is the case, it'll be at a much less risky point than opening a long here and now would be.
It's pretty rare for me to "call" anything.

The current situation is this: the market had the opportunity to continue the downtrend but opted instead to make a strong push to the upside.

The descending channel resistance line that contained the market between $11,700 and $6,400 has been broken to the upside. Quite decisively: https://imgur.com/a/26hWJ

So at least for now, the short term prospects are bullish. 

When I say I'm looking to "buy the dip," I don't mean I have limit buy orders already placed between $7,300 and $7,500 anticipating a dump and a strong bounce. 

Instead, I'll be watching the market to observe *if* it bounces and what form that bounce takes. 

For example, let's say the market dumps straight from $8,200 to $7,500 and recovers back above $8,000 within the span of 24 to 48 hours. 

That would demonstrate some legitimate buying pressure, and suggest this upward movement could have some serious upside potential. 

However, if the market dumps from $8,200 to $7,300, then chops around between $7,800 and $7,300 for a few days with multiple attempts at $7,300 during that time...well, I'd be a bit less convinced of this little rally and might not enter a long.
It's just the point at which I will give up. Doesn't mean the market couldn't pump to $8,400 then drop to $7,300 immediately after. 
It would take a few days to move money on exchange.  Syria is already SOL, so no money there, but Russia could lead a new pump.
I'd lose the gains from my recent long, but it wouldn't be the end of the world. 

I also may choose to exit sooner. 
Nice entry. I got I’m at 8065 and closed my long from 8002 at 7995 
>  descending triangle from 9k double top

normally bearish but a move was expected
the bart formations were meant to serenade shorters andgive them confidence.
nope. going down from 20k to 6k, there was a tale of a big shorter @~12k. it was the uncle of the wife of the step-brother of the husband of the sister of kobayashi /s
What is an adam and eve bottom?
Many people have pointed this out in the last weeks. There was also somebody who said (at least twice) that 64% of the time A&E patterns break down before they are completed.
DCA mitigates the risk that it won't reach lower target points

Edit: totally fair question btw 
A few minutes ago I was pretty confident we'd be going lower from here before heading back up. Now, I'm not so sure. $8050 is holding much better than I expected.
Indeed, the point is he is not confident.  This is how to play a plan A, plan B, plan C, and be dynamic and flexible, and manage risk/reward.
8100
Just trying to learn from big players who generally took a loss 
Yep, should have noted that as well. I've mentioned it in past posts (not that I saw it on my own, just seen it talked about here a bunch). File that under the divergences that haven't happened yet but would be bad signs if they do happen.
Not sure, I've never read anything regarding RSI downtrends. I mostly just use it for failure swings and divergence (I note but try not to put too much stock on overbought/oversold). That could just be my own ignorance though.

You could technically call it a failure swing if we pass the RSI high from 11.8k but given the long time frame and the fact it was only oversold at close on a single day I'm not confident in that.
It’s called capital flight and it’s real and when it increases, so too does the demand for BTC, been talking about this with respect to China for a while now. 
This type of thing confuses me so much.

If you are a journalist writing about bitcoin then surely it would take just 30 mins to come to this sub reddit and find out infinitely more than they already know. 

Mainstream media = blind teaching the ignorant.
Yeah, Bitcoin is doing that Cartman thing lately. As someone who relies on TA for limit buys/sells, it's a little stressful right now. Just gotta follow the TA and set tight stops in case it goes all Bitcoin on me.
And in another 100 we'll see "wait. If 8400 get killed... make your decision.
Me too. Isn’t it ?
Chart patterns do take into account volume. A log downtrend line is no different. That downtrend line only provides resistance because people trade based off it just like people will trade based off Peter Brandt's analysis  
3.3x 
Yeah, that's a hell of a big bet, leveraged or not.
indeed, but if we think by the are of magic lines /s it will break, people will buy.  I know i would, its just that im not sure right now.
Definitely ... I'll be looking at the level where buying pressure picks up... if we bounce off $7800 (no $7500 retest) then it'd be very bullish and give me some confidence that we may break the downtrend line from $20k in the coming week.
Yeah, we may hover here and then ladder up again ... will have to see if this divergence plays out
Well I'm seeing lots of FOMO longs from this level... so maybe not obvious for everyone.

Also I could be wrong and price may hover at current levels, let RSI bleed off and then pump again.  When the market is bullish enough you get this ladder effect with no real dips
My entire point was that I think the herd is definitely not crying moon....
I think he means u/YRuAfraid and u/joyrider5

Or maybe we’re back cuz the price is up
I'm bullish but I think we probably pull back to 7.3 or 7.4 before moving up again, maybe not that far but that's my target.    Could not be that far but I see a pullback now. 
Well it was one trader only, not really sure if that was the case or not.
There was another one, probably ten minutes before this, that wasn't a wash for certain.
I don't necessarily disagree but why do you think that?
Smart money*
Now I suspect as well, too many weird trades taking place right now.
very small amount of a long term hodl stack in but otherwise out. I didn't get short squeezed, was also sitting out for that, but I've been sick and not sleeping well and haven't loved anything enough to set a position yet. thinking it's a good place to open a small short though.
The sentiment score is negative, based on the words people are using. I'm just reporting the score spit out by the algorithm, not my opinion. "Bear" and "bearish", and some others, also count toward negativity. 
More like people kept shorting  the bottom chasing those $30 swings, got caught with their pants down, and now they are trying to confirm their own biases. 
anyone else OD in december 2017 from the amazing heroin to btc ratio?
I have only found r/cc to be as bad or worse but I haven't checked it in a while
More mods then?
I can appreciate that point of view and appreciate you posting your perspective. To me it seems like many of those concerns could be mitigated by recruiting additional mods specifically for policing that thread. I know there was a recent recruiting drive for more mods, but I don't know how many candidates you felt were quality that you had to turn down or what your reasons would be for limiting overall mod count.
Which is why I understand it's not wanted in the main thread but given bitcoin's place in the crypto hierarchy and how much crypto has grown since this sub was created, I don't think a separate thread is an unreasonable request given the demand
Your point? Alt's don't have a bitcoinmarket?
Technically most alts are bitcoinmarkets ;) 
bitcoin is very volatile today..
Coinbase is all around retarded and delayed. Their price alerts are disgustingly slow. 

Need something that’s close to instant and will wake me up out of a coma. 
This is the new way for Cambridge Analytica to get info ;)
Great timing!
I have one @8140 and i'm not confortable. :)
But already closed half of it to pay for fees and my stop loss is bellow my entry so now i just wait. Worst case scenario i earn 0.2%, so could be worse. 
But seriously considering changing mindset to buy the dips and not sell the tops... At least until 8k5-8k8 this seems to have fuel to burn even with such high RSI. Maybe when the daily gets overbought it goes down a bit no?
It's stupid, being honest and truthful with the IRS makes you more likely to get audited. 

Still, better to be proactive and cautious, if they roll out a system 10 years from now that is able to go back and analyze all crypto users' trade data, they could fuck over everyone that avoided paying.
I'm paying this year, but my crypto is going under the radar from now on.
Same. About 200 pages long. Except I just ran my trades through bitcoin.tax. Was your accountant able to reduce your tax burden compared to what your form 8949 said you should owe?
Mine was only about six pages long, taxes are a lot simpler when you mostly hold :) 
I'm almost positive the only people reporting on credit karma would be people who had only a few trades. Most of us had more complicated returns so we used CPAs. They need a better metric to find good data.
My guess is people who don't plan on paying taxes on crypto gains have never made any serious money outside of crypto. 
took my (small) profits at 7955, not comfortable with the position  
replied below, took profits. 
agreed. Greed just kills people in here. 

The short term memory loss is at times quite unbelievable. Yea we could go even higher today or tomorrow, but it is more likely over the coming week that we see a huge red candle again than loads of green ones. That's simply due to the big downtrend we are in. 

It's not 100% that we'll fall but the trend is the trend until it's not the trend anymore. 

That moment won't occur until we bust up through the ATH resistance line. 
I understand what you mean, yep it was nice to see that we had some strength not to go lower at that point. That's the only hope in the air though, that isn't much unfortunately. 

The odds are this is just a short squeeze and that normal service will resume within a few days or maybe by this time next week. 


of course at one point it's suddenly over. The point here is that we have had many 'points' so far in this bear market where people said the same thing. 

Then we fell and returned to the downtrend. 

People shouldn't expect anything less until we break above the ATH trend line with a bit of conviction. Anything else right now is just hopium 
The 9 successful trades were a bit of mixed luck, extremely shitty TA, and following some people leads on here

This move was just an utter rookie mistake. I feel like a disgusting n00b that doesn’t deserve to be trading but yet I’ll look back at this in a few weeks and thank myself 
Nothing is simple in the crypto world 
> a single whale

AH. You're funny.
He had 200 mil to spend on Bitcoin apparently though:)
Whales have their own r/r to consider too and it was much better at that point yesterday than here
Yeah I know. Taking a couple months off to learn some new skills. Just try and play the market during times when volume is statistically higher. Each 2&#37; increase is an equivalent to a week's worth of wages from my old job. Getting close to where I only need 1&#37; per week.
None of your business how much I have invested lol. But it's enough to where 1% is meaningful. And I still have plenty in my checking account and savings account so am not w/d from my crypto portfolio yet. 

Just have time to focus on trading during the high volume times, so why not make a week's worth of wages in one or two hours?
Then I start looking for a job? 

It's not like I'm basing my livelihood on trading. I just jump in and out here and there. Yesterday's increase gave me a month's worth of wages in addition to my budget. 
2% increase is a week of wages for me. Already made 10% this week, so I'm covered for over a month. Getting close to where I only need 1% to cover my wages. 
I did, look at my post history. Went long. Still open now.
You're The GOAT!
This looks right. I think Kraken was the third one.

Looking for more confirmation.
I think it's Kraken and then okcoin CNY
Haha. Thanks man. 
Understandable.  I've only been in this sub for a couple weeks but I've already followed /u/chewtoy_ a few days ago in an attempt to pick up a few things.  I like his demeanor so far.  I appreciate the advice.  
I saw someone else suggest that.  Gonna check it out in a little bit. Thanks. 
eh it's really not,worth it 
My point was not the he was too stupid to be successful. It's not about stupidity. My point was that it's not worth it.

/u/deific_ seems like a smart person with a level head. That's a good start, but its not enough to be successful in the markets. Success requires the above, and on top of it time, energy, patience, and wisdom usually obtained through a trial by fire. 

There is much to be gained by trading, especially in terms of personal growth. But it *will* come at a cost. Cheers.
I'll take a look after work. Thanks! 
^ this, make a painful mistake, you'll learn from it because you hate it so much
Are you just talking purely trades in bitcoin to fiat? In those terms yes 4x is doing quite well, but including alt trades I and im sure many more have gains far above 4x.
I'm up way way more than 400%, but much more because I bought quite a while ago, not because of trading.
7.6-7.8
Just looking to scalp a bit at this point, I crashed and burned earlier today and got wrecked by the big green candle yesterday so just trying to make little baby trades for now and hopefully find a good entry point for a solid long. 
I feel like that’s asking to get stopped out here. 
Hoping we get a "ground the moonboys" red candle here shortly. I'm looking for a 5% move, or around 7650. I'd probably set stops at 7900 and let it ride at that point, though. 
Missed my stop on my 7900’s Short by literally 3 dollars. Got my orders filled for my new shorts between 8175-8235
Analytically, it's the obvious trade. But I've now been wrecked shorting 2 obvious trades. The major loss was my fault for not setting stops while traveling though. 
Well, with a line of this length, it's really more of a zone +/- 1% IMO, but that's just where it falls. You on log?

Yes, basically that's a synopsis of my current expectations. The wedge already broke down here, and now we're in a bear flag off that drop. A fall back below 8K could be the catalyst for the correcting candle, but we'll see. Usually when a wedge breaks down, the bottom acts as new resistance. That's at 8190 right now and pretty dang steep. I might set that stop a little lower (8420ish?) now that we broke down. If we get back above 8300, we're back through the wedge and above long-term resistance. 
I don't just state them as facts, i base my trades on it, and so far with good results.

But go ahead and close your longs or open a short because you feel RSI is indicating a pullback, good luck.
> We'll retest the downward trend from 20k on the linear scale and then we'll know for sure.

Can you clarify? All *linear-scale* downtrend lines from 20k are below us right now. 
Its @~9k on stamp. 
Hedge is fine, but I don't anticipate a significant drop this week. If we can not break 8200 with conviction in the next 2-3 days, then maybe we drop.
so short the futures with highest price then I guess? Because i can not short swaps without closing the position.  On the other hand, I am getting a big exhausted from the last days(was also part of the EOS rally from 5$) so maybe I just close out for the weekend if i get stopped out... but no this won't happen who do I try to fool lol :D
You can also just look at the 6h chart for this 4h chart
I use the doubled crypto settings (20/60/120/30)--you can change your settings in the indicator settings.
not true.

big money generally wants to find undervalued investments and park their money there, or find overvalued investments and short the crap out of it.

Sure, normies lose money in both situations, but they don’t wake up in the morning to stick it to the normie. It’s just too bad the normies aren’t the best traders
caution is good. my limits are heavily weighted sub 7k but I am not trying to time absolute tops and bottoms. with a weekly dca back on and having played the game since 2013 I am not too worried about big money trying to play games (my average price will always be lower than theirs).
Relax. it is only 14 days ago we were where we are now +/ 8100
Let's see in a few days that we have a sort off reversal - Up
Not even close, zoom out on your chart.
That's a ton of lines you got there
I said the bottom is in
my take on 2014 fractals/comparisons is that we will visit where 2014 did. not necessarily in the same way or the same order. The 2014 comparisons (in my opinion) will be invalidated upon a break of $12k.

Until then, everything has been relatively similar so far, including the parabolic explosion we just saw (consolidation -> parabolic rise happened in 2014 in April as well)

I mean our rise to $16k before $17.2k would've made the charts look confusing but if you went in analyzing the fractals the way I've described above you would've shorted at $17.2k instead of thinking $16k was the DCB and $17.2k was the recovery 
You can't just ban the past, dude.
2014 isn't unsubstantiated FUD. It's just a gradually failing comparison that's slowly but surely being invalidated.

Without the lower low it just looks... a little desperate.
This is a trading sub and to compare the 2013/14 bubble with the 2017/18 bubble is good to get some idea how things could fold out and to trade based on that. I know that history will not repeat, but if you look on the charts you can see some astonishing similarities. 
do you want to just ban fractals from the sub? lol

cause anyone can remove the word "2014" and just post the chart. It doesn't matter if "this time it's different", the charts are insightful at the very least. I mean, even if it turns out differently, we can point to *where* it went differently and act accordingly
Why?


It's just another way of announcing the threat of 1 day bans... which I then don't end up handing out very often. The idea is to warn people, and then let them self regulate around the warning. To actually earn a 1 day ban you've got to figure out how to break more than one rule at a time.

"sin bin" is what rugby players call the penalty box.
What price does that trendline come down to here?
I agree the volume was high, but how much of that volume was a result of the Short squeeze? And it's been tapering off ever since that pump. Not exactly a ringing endorsement for a reversal.
The muli year rise didn't feature huge jumps like we seeing now (ex including December)
I think it goes back to 7.4 - 7.5 now and back up. 
So what did you decide to do with that short?   I see one post about you missing its SL, and another about adding to it.
Right, I'm certainly waiting for the 2 hour H&S to fully confirm before shorting anything here.
Yeah after all these months it feels like there has to be a correction now, but I’m really not sure anymore 
I buy when conditions are heavily oversold. I figure out my buy zone by using TA such as trendlines and previous resistance levels that *should* turn support. Then I pay attention to what other traders think the "bottom" is, and I separate the outlandish predictions from the reasonable predictions. I don't set limit buys in advance. As the price action unfolds in my "buy area of interest" I watch for volume and look for bullish divergences on short term RSI timeframes to indicate we are nearing the bottom/lack of selling power. I then buy all-in, and wait to sell on the bounce a few days later.
Dude, the mempool is far from full. Zoom out please.
mempool has nothing to do with block times

Can you grab historical data that way (via trading view), or do you have to use the exchange API to grab price data starting from right now (obviously with the Eth futures, that may be the only way if trading view doesn't list that index).

I actually don't know how to grab tabulated data from trading view (if that's what you're saying you can do). Pardon my ignorance.
the sell pressure honestly doesn't look like it's being absorbed well to you? all good bud, we can agree to disagree.
Yup, a lot of underwater short bag hodlers in here
The real bagholders are the ones holding FIAT
Said with such authority, it must be nice to be able to predict the future 
I posted it a month ago, but there were others who came to the same conclusion independently of me. I was kind of cryptic but I assumed most people understood what I meant:

Looks more like people got bored of the 8100 action
The population of the entire US and Europe **combined** barely reaches 1 billion people. India alone has a population of 1.3 billion more than 4 times that of the US. If you weren't so clueless you'll understand that India is a big piece of the pie for any market aspiring for global adoption.

he is.
And I always thought "OracleSeven" was a reference to 7 alt accounts he would use to abet and aid his reddit-manipulation goals. 

Ahh yes, I should go back to studying literature.  ~~ This was more of a shower thought 
One of them had a big thing about going into men's rights subs and trolling about how women belonged in the kitchen. After so many banned alts, no idea which one anymore.
Nothing wrong with having that tool in your tool box. 
One should use all available analysis techniques. Technical sometimes can overpower fundamental and the opposite, plus sentiment is important in most cases. 
What kind of timeline are you trading on? I feel this sub is much more dedicated to daytrading or ultra-short term trading versus more classic short to mid-range trading (e.g. 2-6 weeks or 1-3 months) based on macro forecasting.
A 75btc buy wall appeared in the last few minutes on gdax at 8050. That increases my confidence in an eventual breakdown here. But, I'm noob-ish.
4 knocks on it in the last 4 hours makes me think it's going to break.
Pretty good, now, haha.
Did u close ur underwater short for a profit! 

I did! Wound up making money on it + my short from 8235. Good stuff TRK! 
Pretty sure that's not what happened yesterday, but if it makes you feel better, that's also just as likely. 
Just stepping in to point out that the "accumulation period", while technically accurate, only lasted about 2 weeks.  For comparison, the previous true accumulation period (before the 20k bull run) took almost 10 months.
There's also long-term support from October. Here's a [chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/piECGM3W/) I posted on 4/10.
First entry executed at 8111, 2 more between 8.2-8.3. Stops above 8.35. 
tell me about it i've been watching this anxiously as I have an overleveraged short a 7950... Didn't do anything the all afternoon. Won't margin trade against the market again. short if bear and long if bull, even if they are short term.
No mobiles allowed in my work environment. :(
If it happens to break 8k then head to 7.9k I’ll most likely just close break even so I dont have to stress anymore. If I get stopped out and this thing shoots to 9k I’ll probably open another short there 
Haha nope I actually hadn’t seen that, but I’ve suspected something similar was happening. Not saying this is confirmation or not, but very interesting, thanks for sharing. 
Would be great to see a source for that info.
Thanks u made me lol
But for a moment some alts will see a rise in the btc ratio to temporarily maintain their usd ratio.  Very profitable, but fleeting, short opportunities if you see any spikes.

I think this happens because a lot of alt traders only look at the usd value even when they are implicitly buying through btc or eth.  

You can do the inverse too, for example eth had a bit of a flash crash when btc spiked the other day.  In those cases you can be confident that it recovers and put in a quick long, especially in that eth case as eth had been performing well.
That was my suspicion too.  Ripple/BTC is looking like a very juicy short right about now lol
That's probably still a better play than going long. Why the hostility lmao?
You're going to get rekt if you short everytime we sit idle for a few hours. This is how bulls got slaughtered on the way down, by longing every "surely this is bottom" price. Be careful. 

Also, why the fuck are you so emotional? Im not telling you to panic close your short or never open one but if you plan to open a short at every perceived top youre going to get chopped up until we really hit the peak. If the trend changes you have to respect it and theres a good argument for this having been a trend change (ill retract this statement if we fall back under 7k).
You threw in some extra spice there didn't you daddy?

In theory one could have seen a [H&S (link to babypips)](https://www.babypips.com/learn/forex/head-and-shoulders) on the 15 min (like in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8bnetl/daily_discussion_thursday_april_12_2018/dx9zm8i/)), but it didn't break neckline so it didn't go down.

That being said, I personally think that (especially on the 15 min) bitcoin just moves up and down too much so a "future H&S" can be seen too often to care about it. On a bigger timeframe and if the neckline is really broken, it can be useful though. Obviously I was just joking around.
Look at his username

In crypto I have realized "stupidity" = profit. Going against the grain pays off. I bet 75% of people here think we are in a time loop back to 2014. And they are betting with everything they can muster that an extended bear market will occur. I for one believe we are somewhat done. Hence why I am (confidently) willing to continue this conversation on the 31st of Dec 2018.

Yes.
Somebody hasn't welcomed you to bitcoin.
We've dipped below it, true. But it's done well to rise back above 8100 in short order (at least for the last hour or two.)
I don't margin trade. I set targets based on TA and make limit buys/sells on GDAX. 
Why does everyone think it will dump?  Is there some reason to sell when Bitcoin has already shown us time and again that it can explode upward and double at the drop of a hat?

What is the bear case, exactly?   
Thanks for the thoughtful response. I agree it is hard to infer causality, but I appreciate you sharing your intuitions
> in less than 48 hours all of this had reversed. 

He said infrastructure!! That means Steel, Iron, Coking Coal and Concrete!!! Buy all that little Concrete company near Mexico!! Buy all that Australian Iron Ore!!! 

Hangon why is China shutting down all their Blast Furnaces!?!?! Shit they just stopped ordering Coking Coal!!! There are billions of tons of shit Iron Ore and they only want the best stuff so they can switch off everything but their cleaner furnaces?!?

What's that you say? US doesn't import Steel but recycles it? Infrastructure is spending? Gold is worthless? Oh shit, Trump #1 Trump #1 Trump #1!

Was so funny to watch on the markets ;D
Thanks, ya, I was thinking something like this too. It's hard to say, though. I could also see a political catastrophe triggering panic selling, as you are more prone to see in the stock market. 
got one placed at 8200 and another at 8250 and will close out at 8355 if it breaks that log line
Thank you.
Wrong.
makes sense
Follow this guy's advice but DCA in over time. We will pull back from this, RSI needs to cool off and it wouldn't hurt to spend some time accumulating at this level for a while.
thanks now I have to eat pie
How can you be sure that from here on we will dip back down?

To me personally, I think we've spent a lot of time in the 6k and 7k range. This might as well be some sort of confirmation for others to jump back in and increase the price.  


😂
That made me lol 
But...but...that volume was the highest ever for a 1H timeframe.
The thing is the smaller dips and pumps could be considered noise so you can't try to fit them exactly.  But it is interesting to observe the overall higher level pattern.  I think that it speaks to the psychology of the markets not being a hell of a lot different.  Looking at the 2018 chart in context of the zoomed out 2014 pattern has been quite profitable for me.
history may not repeat, but it sure does rhyme, as they say.
But if a lot of people are following the same chart it might turn into a self fulfilling prophecy. I think trading on long term charts makes more sense than on 15min charts like a lot of people here seem to do. 
Using TA is better than a coin flip just like using statistics is better than randomly guessing.  And its pretty obvious what is going to happen in the future.  You don't bounce off the biggest green volume bar ever and then quickly drop back down.

I actually don't know who that is tbh. Only been using Reddit actively again in the past few months. 
Speaking of /u/OracleSeven I find their last comment so funny. Said when Bitcoin was worth $1170

>So now you are proud that Bitcoin has high fees just like VISA. How quickly you guys redraw the lines when they don't move in your favor.

>Bitcoin is a FAILURE as far as merchant adoption goes, and that was when the fees were even lower. Now they are high and it really fails as a payment system on multiple levels.
Sure. What happened to your sub 6k comment few days ago?
Yes? Not sure what time you are referring to. From ATH? Yeah, I think many stopped longing.
No idea. I kept and added to my position all the time.
[removed]
I see that ô¿ô
I closed it. Still a not-nothing $50 net-price profit from earlier swing trades but it's probably going to pop man :/ 

Don't think we've maxed out the short squeeze, longs are decreasing and shorts are going up but price isn't going down. 
Hmm? If I didn't do those swing trades on my first entry I'd exit for a loss instead of a small profit. 

But for how long? Usually site revamps offer the old layout for a while, then the managers say "well it's costing too much to support it and almost all of our new users use the new layout anyway."
Legit can’t even log in to their new garbage. Tells me my session times out. Have to use mobile app. 
Even without the bugs it feels like trash. I don’t understand why same page pop up format is catching on. 
Thank you!
0 gains

lol why is the sun's mouth green?
Not verbatim, general idea. 
As soon as they close we know Bitcoin is really dead.
If this is bottom and they've sold in the last month, they have the fiat. But do they have the balls?
I didn't mean to sound cynical. It's just reality.
If I'm using really tight SL then it's usually a pretty significant swing high and i will be literally sat at the computer glancing at it regularly. 

It's a pretty soft SL, if a random wick cuts through then ill ignore it but if keep cutting or blast through it then i exit.

This particular bet is a RSI bounce bet. We're overbought on so many time frames that i figured we need a break but if we break that swing high significantly then the train will just keep going up.

I hope that makes some sense lol. really shit at wording myself
BB and general S/R.

RSI overcooked on so many time frames. it needs to cool off a little bit. but when btc starts to run, it doesnt care hence the tight stop
Different whales want different things.

I honestly don't think the organic buying pressure was that high at all until some bullwhales pushed the price up, causing people to FOMO in. 
looking at the huge candle in 30 min, being able to triggers so many SL, can only be some group of whales. Even being a few of the institutional money buying it ...it still won't change a bear trend. Historically it never did. 
lol... i hope you set a SL.
Well you kinda should until the general public interest comes back. There's a case for the old log support being a resistance now, I know some traders targets 8.3k - 8.5k and others will plan around the descending trendline. Traders will create significant sell pressure and I'm a little skeptical I will miss much in the next hours after a 20% pump so I prefer to lock gains.

I'm not shorting yet however, this can go higher and even never come back down if another pack of shorts are squeezed.
Excatly
its not exactly 1:0.001

edit: I was wrong, disregard.
https://www.tradingview.com/x/X4IO01RC 
I agree, but still looking more and more likely 
Cry me river? That still won't get us to 6k.
Tell'n ya man, historically speaking, this could easily bounce to 8,5k in the next few hours. It's off to races once shorts start closing or getting liquidated ... then we won't sound so crazy.
Welcome to Bitcoin?
Nothing major yet. FOMO FOMO comes after the squeeze.
Implementation of crucial infrastructure, adoption by big players?
100,000 new businesses accepting Lightning for payments - that will justify a return to ATH imo
the key driver is most likely the parallel to 2014.

Since Tone Vays brought it up, its been a topic of discussion, which could turn out to be a self fulfilling prophecy at this point.

On the other hand, we have signs if life, so Bitcoin won’t go down without a fight. This little pullback is fine in my eyes, but if we go sub 7500, it’s a cause for concern.

We already were not able to hold above 8k just yet. Let’s hope we can make it back though
I only use market for stop losses. 
He did mention a drink in-hand.
No, people just talking like trading this is a bad idea, but it just seems more like people are trying to confirm their own biases. 

If this thing hits 8600, and then dips you know everyone short here will be like "told you!" 


Pretty good r/r now! Still haven't gotten out of position 
S/He's talking himself into making a trade when there really isn't a high percentage one to be made (at this moment in time)
Fair point. That makes more sense. Then I agree it's a _possible_ bear div. Thanks!
Why do billionaires buy politicians? Why does Zuckerberg sell customer data? Why do rich Republicans vote for tax cuts?

They could've just traveled the world instead.
[deleted]
Oh please no!! So I shouldn't point out when sentiment is irrational as hell?
lol personally i wouldnt mind, more time to accumulate 
Hmmm, so in this overlay 4k is the lowest we go. That's not bad at all :D
Amazing how accurate these charts are.
Not only that, look at the chart. Every since bitcoin has ever crossed it it has been an important support. Possibly the strongest horizontal.
I was feeling good at the ascending wedge breakdown this morning. I'm still about 60/40 on it. I'm more comfortable being short at 8160 than I would be long at 8160, but that could just be trend bias. I've been more successful shorting than longing. I'm definitely not wildly optimistic, and the thought of closing for tiny profit here is on the forefront of my mind. 
if we go below $7700 I'd worry maybe a bit but aside from that this is just normal profit taking. 

I'm thinking you won't be underwater *that* long
Not yet, though I may take 20% profit at 7850. Undecided.
....always a risk with trading. Losing 1.5% is about my target for stops (trading 5x, so 7.5%). 
https://giphy.com/gifs/breaking-bad-walter-white-youre-goddamn-right-3oFzmkkwfOGlzZ0gxi
TBH, I don't even give a fuck if it's organic. I'll happily trade my weekly Cthulhu sacrifices for based Krakenwhale blood rituals.
Right. I simply wanted to point out for those browsing that the crossing works well in a downtrend. We are still in a downtrend, but if one's theory is that this is the beginning of a bull trend this indicator won't necessarily puts brakes on another rise here.
No doubt. Just chimed in as someone who isn't a shorter.
That's sub optimal. I'll see what I can get away with using CSS that references a cross domain resource.
That would be unbelievably bullish if 7.8 held and we bounced above 8.3. 
thanks for confirming my bias, Chew. I think that is probable, but nothing would surprise me
how much leverage do you usually do in these trades?
zoom out, how high do this think this can run if it's a bull market? btc log trend line is the last line of defense for bears. I think this thing is running up into a double bubble like in 2013.
The best is to never close a cushy long (futures) and use another product (swaps) to short in order to reduce exposure or switxh to a hedge.

If you plan on naked shorting, better close that long

That’s how I do it at least
Thats my belief though, I'm not sure others feel the same, but i know all of us here do.
By the way, do you know much on the halving of block rewards. To me, it seems bitcoins next bullrun is inevitable. If it doesnt come before the next halving, the halving is sure ignite another hype cycle???
>  to spread

lol
The banking system and USD have done such a good job of stopping corruption and crime.
People still die too, there is always a greater fool because everyone dies and new ones are born. They gotta eat, they gotta work. We can always add more bits if sub-division is a problem (from lost coins), or use mSats on LN, then uSats.

> I was looking for that chart

I believe it was removed at one point for having a donation address, then another was re-created, then eventually reinstated.

>  it's my favorite chart

I honestly don't get it, some kind of Elliot Wave/Fractal thing with I guess a channel on long-term median or so. I looked at it closely enough to figure out the logic, but damn it's crazy. I always like to imagine it's some whale who then is painting the whole thing for a laugh.
It'll *never* be convenient or practical to use bitcoin in a store.

They'd have to be first paid *in* bitcoin otherwise it's literally an extra step they'd have to take for no economic benefit but plenty of economic cost (price volatility, KYC, time, etc.).

So people will *never* switch over unless the primary currencies (EUR, CNY, and USD) implode, which isn't going to happen within the next 5 to 10 years.
i might print out these words and look at them every time before i click sell or buy
They have unquestioning faith in their oracle 'chewy'

I've been keeping track of the performance of those who believe themselves to be the greatest oracles here. The results actually show you are statistically just as likely to be correct as often as them through guesswork alone (as expected), sample size of a month, I'll make a proper write up in the coming weeks.
Still sitting here with some impotent looking mid to low $7k's bids.

I've been mulling over a potentially contrived comparison to 2/6 and the rally thereafter. If I'm remembering correctly, the RSI was pretty overbought, yet the buys kept coming in and the price steadily moved up. I recall you speculating that the trading bots were gladly providing the bids with liquidity due to the oscillators.

Around that time there was also a significant premium on JPYUSD and KRWUSD. The timing of the buy seemed seemed strongly correlated to Asia waking hours. (Today JPYUSD has moved to only to a small premium, and KRWUSD remains at a notable 3%ish discount) 

It feels like there is no way the large players don't let this test the downtrend log resistance, as low as that breakout price has gotten, but without the same buying pressure the price should retrace some, right?

Maybe the aggregate *they* control enough BTC, ETH, XRP, and whatever else now that they can suspend the price by making so little available to sell.
Thank you very much.
I kid you not but there’s is demand in the OTC markets coming from Russia in a very large way. 
i have a short from 7950, added a bit to it at 8050, will add at 8100 and if it goes beyond 8150/8200 i might bail. 

if and when you do exit i'd be interested in knowing, have made some bad trades recently and wouldn't mind following someone else's moves to regain my footing

Yes. but the descending wedge which is usually bullish also matched up. So really, all you could know for that is that a big move was coming, and with shorts you could easily think it was up. 

I personally got luck with it, but i did it thinking on the alt pump.
A double bottom where the first bottom is a sharp drop and rise, and the second bottom is rounded and slower and wider. It is quite a common slow reversal shape.
Ive pointed this out no less than twice over the past two weeks, and got down voted every time.  But, there are good reasons for the downvotes.  The price, at the time, could have easily dropped further just as much as it could have gone up.  Predicting investor behavior based on lines on a screen is a fun way to gamble but completely unreliable.  Had the price dropped, in heindsite, we would all be calling it another formation that fits another pattern.  Descending channel or some bullshit.

TA is junk science.  The only way you can invest with any accuracy is to value invest and then be prepared for the market to act irrationally until it finally decides to be rational.  Like watching twitch play pokemon.
Could just be bear flagging. We'll see. 
He took less of a loss than he made in the days prior. Not a big deal IMO
Can I make decisions for others..  Grown up people here. LoL
wouldn't make sense if it wasn't. he  usually is extremely ambiguous about stating such things so I'd be surprised if it was a statement 
good luck
Seems foolish to do it now, as oppose to 2 days ago, but he might just be right
(he's short)
Go look /r/bitcoin
you think so? I see a lot of people thinking this is very possibly a reversal. Myself included tbh 

look at the new comments, all people upvoting bullish comments, longing, etc. I don't think it's indicative of a dump or something, but most people seem to be very bullish over this
Just the way there was a sell order of about that size popping up holding price down, seems quite likely its a guy trying to cause a quick pop. Someone actually trying to sell that could have easily sold it more discretely above that for more. Ofcourse just my guess who knows
Bitfinex and Tether*
Wait you went from super bullish to "bitcoin skeptic?

What happened?
Weird trades happening for month's on Bitfinex , doesn't make sense at all.
[deleted]
If someone posts "I was bearish, but not anymore looking at the charts", does it count toward negative sentiment or positive sentiment?
non-sequitur.  That has absolutely nothing to do with what you just replied to.

And also your fantasy life is of no interest to the rest of us.
I think they've been actively working to stop brigading recently - it's certainly better than it was.  Little or no TA there though, unfortunately.

My concern with adding an alt-thread here would be that it tends to just descend into a shitslinging match between the various factions (of whatever argument is current).  Ultimately the better posters avoid it, at which point it's worse than useless (and it tends to leak in here too).

I guess I'm really saying it would need to be heavily modded, and that's not a small undertaking.
>could be mitigated by recruiting additional mods specifically for policing that thread

So then we'd have 2 different groups of mods interested in 2 different types of discussion. This is already the case, but instead of separating it into threads in /r/bitcoinmarkets, it's separated into /r/bitcoinmarkets and /r/cryptocurrency, which is a much more accurate nomenclature.
by having altcoin discussion we're basically inviting all the trolls and memers. it's gonna be a hassle for the mods man
You can talk about alt/btc price in this thread. The stuff that is removed is

>ICX is mooning bitcoin is ded!

and

>ETH hitting $500 support

As long as you talk about the bitcoin price in some way, it is relevant to bitcoinmarkets.
I'm still looking for something myself...everything is either loud or not fast enough. Trading view has some good stuff that texts me quickly but that costs lots and lots of money. And it's just a text...so it doesn't exactly wake me up unless I set like 8000 alarms
I thought they were /r/AskReddit
it was kind of obvious when the ceo of ripple was the richest man in the world for a minute
RSI/MACD/etc is meanlingless now for signaling the timing of movements IMO.  It's all about sentiment and people's thresholds snowballing of "it's been here too long, it's dangerous" or, "it's stayed here long enough, it's safe".  Best you can hope for from TA at this point is to find your ranges based on major resistance/support.

If I were shorting here I'd just be doing cautious insta scalps.  But I also wouldn't open a long here.

Any downward movement we make will recharge my long, SL at 7200.
I filed weeks ago, but IRS has not cashed my check. No notice yet, but I fear the delay indicates compliance has triggered an audit.
They already have a system it's called Coinbase and Gemini that has all your info.   I guess I could have gone the localbitcoins route instead of wiring to my bank account but for now I'll just pay what I owe and sleep better. 
That's even dumber man, you put yourself on their radar, now they'll notice you leaving it. Also you don't have any plausible deniability and can't plead ignorance if you knew you were paying taxes then suddenly stopped. 
I used cointracking.info to generate my 18 page 8949 (more of a longer term trader/holder) and yes my accountant was able to cut my tax burden from what it stated in half. However I also had carryover losses from the stock market going back years and investment property expenses. 
 I used bitcoin.tax as well. He was able to reduce it a decent amount. Bitcoin.tax saved my ass though because those exchanges reports are straight crap 
Same for me in ETH. Took the past three days profits off the table and I am fully sidelined until BTC re-tests the key support area in the 7400/7200 range. If we bounce off that convincingly enough I'll hop back in. Not gonna ride the downward slide though. 
never be afraid of just going away for 2 days or so(I know it's hard) and come back with a fresh mind. this market will give us more opportunities
I did same thing, only in my mind....

I just wanted to play with 1.000$, and 100x leverage long for my first time on bitmex, when BTC dipped yesterday below 6.8k.

5 minutes after i decided, nah, it's not worth it, BTC goes boom.
How much would i have made, because for sure i wouldn't had it stopped at 7.6k when it retraced yesterday ?
It was kicked off by a single whale then others FOMO’d in and a lot of shorts were also liquidated.

Or did everyone independently have the same idea to buy bitcoin within the same one hour period?
[deleted]
> Yesterday's increase gave me a month's worth of wages in addition to my budget.

yesterday's increase was literally a one in a lifetime thing. BTC has never seen that much volume during a 1h candle in its existence. 

Good luck, but you should probably get a job unless you're like managing a hedge fund and a godlike trader or something
nice :)
(this excellent advice is given to just about everyone when they are new. consider it a disclaimer and ask yourself if you really want what some people here have. if the answer is yes, then buckle up buttercup - you're in for one hell of a ride)
4x gains **in BTC**, not against fiat.
He means +400% BTC, not USD. 
[Gob]I've made a huge mistake[/Gob]
If this goes back over 8.2 I'm tempted to say they can have it.
As the rising wedge broke down, I think this will test the bottom of the channel we're currently in : 
https://www.tradingview.com/x/fR5kC0ZA/

Not so sure about those short entries man, I think this will play out like [march 18](https://www.tradingview.com/x/8mkxQWhb/). 

EDIT: accidentally pressed send

Haha, right. The obvious caveat is "this is bitcoin", so nearly anything can happen.

I have an underwater short for similar reasons -- I'm interested to see what happens here. If all of those signals play out, I feel like it could invalidate the "institutional pump" narrative pretty strongly.
Yes, thanks for the charts, i redrew mine a little bit. Man this line is stressing me out!
Gotcha.  BTW, what are you guys using to set alarms?  Coinbase app?
If we look at them as historical data to increase the odds of a successful entry (or a good exit point), we haven't been this overbought on 4hr/6hr/12hr or stayed overbought this long on the 1hr since 12/6. Do I think we are in a bull market like December? No. None of this requires thinking that anybody is trading on it.
I meant log, not linear
I closed at 7800 and won't be going back in until it's well under that. 
Well the futures tanking will give you a nice little bonus if we do go bear again. Why not? 
thanks, I know ichimoku is kind of your specialty, are you also using the crypto settings (doubled or not), or the standard one for forex? 
thanks!
O no. I say, we don't have to go up harder for it to be extremely positive. I'm looking at 11.8k . That's the toughest horizontal as a signal for new ath.
yes, I did, and the last time we climbed anywhere near this rate was back in december.

Don't even count the 2000$ swings back at 17-15k because %based it made sense. We fucking pumped 1500$ in less then a full day and you're going to act like it's not a big deal?
Haha yeah it's my personal chart, all these are either resistance lines or fib retracement lines (zoomed out it's a lot less messy ;-)
Looks like a good set of lines to be observing to try to determine the next major resistance/support zones after having the breakout that we had.
2014 bubble had willie bot and the collapse of Mt.Gox. Fundamentals we're utterly broken. The market had no choice but to overcompensate for a long time. The protocol wasn't fully ready to scale at the time, anyway.

THe market overcorrected in 2014 on a scale that's not really similar. after the 2014 bubble most people in this sub agreed that we probably wouldn't ever see a bubble that size again. So far, they're right. 

Bitcoin is gradually reducing volatility. The compensation we saw in 2014 isn't relevant to what we're seeing. We didn't go as high and we don't need to go as low.
Unless you're Turkey! ;D
[deleted]
lol Sloppy, you know it wasn't the point of my comment :) of course we won't see 2014 or even something close to that banned, I'm just tired of this topic... when BTC will (hopefully) rise again parabolically then people will probably say "it's December 2017 all again, crash incoming" and what not... sorry but every time BTC farts, I'm not interested to see a chart from a specific year, month, day minute that is similar.. 

Do you realize that even though we dropped 75%+ (against 80+ i believe) some people are arguing that we absolutely can't go up without going down at the exact same drop % that was in 2014?? Even though we already had the double top and so on. No, people here are blindly waiting for the EXACT same 2014 pattern to happen. My god that's just out of hands.
because
Because this bear market is moving much faster. We already had a double top.

He's going to repeat that dusty old meme "Past performance is no guarantee of future results." When the truth is bitcoin loves patterns and does these cycles over and over and over again. 
40% actually
Currently underwater on shorts from 7919-7950 with my stops at 8245. ( 7919 was top of right shoulder ) 

I added shorts today between 8175-8235 so currently profitable on them. 

The run to 8.2k this morning came 4$ short of my stop loss on Kraken @ 8241. Going to hold onto both with intentions of 8k breaking through if we can’t break the 8250-8300 resistance line again 
Ah read it wrong. Thought you meant why is it taking so long for a transaction to confirm. 

Blocktime is a poisson process with an average time of 10min. It's a timeless property, so even if 10min goes by, the expect time for another block is still 10 minutes. 
longs decreased by 5% and the price climbed? thats bullish af. means demand is high
They don't make it easy, but I'm sure there's a javascript hack to extract it. What I'm suggesting is to calculate and plot the premium over time in a tradingview script to get a quick idea. If you want to use custom tools then it's not the easy way.

    btc_index = security("OKCOIN:BTCUSDIDX",period,close)
    btc_future = security("OKCOIN:BTCUSD3M",period,close)
    btc_premium = 100*(btc_future/btc_index-1)
    plot(btc_premium,color=red)
It looked to me that the buying pressure was well absorbed. Distribution, decent buy pressure but price didn't move up, nor was allowed to tank. Then suddenly, support removed. I could be wrong but that's my understanding.

If that's right, those who had the firepower to break 6.8 have the firepower to break 7.8
Mark my words, link back to this comment in July.
lol what's the difference?? 

I'd have sold at $8100-8200 too if I longed  from below. Seemed a drop to $7800 was imminent regardless
They do not *account* for a big piece of the pie. Go back in my comment history and be astounded at a very similar post to yours that I made. It has the *potential* to one day become a big piece of the pie, but it does not *currently account* for an even remotely large piece. OP’s news article is therefore irrelevant - that’s my entire point. Before you get your panties wet over your assumptions about my supposed ignorance/cluelessness, do some research, tell me when was the last time India had so much as even the tiniest impact on the Crypto world. In reference to OPs post about 100s of btc being stolen from an Indian exchange, your argument sounds laughable at best.
Don't Indians love tech aswell?
That makes sense, thanks.
Your sub 6k close wasn't hit and you changed strategy. No way you're full bullish.
Nice, ill be betting on at least one more push to that line before a breakdown (if it occurs). Going bullish if 9k breaks though.
I'm not into those kind of political/justice stuff but hopefully that would make them speed up on his troubles to take him down for good out of this seat.
/u/PeaceHere is almost certainly /u/OracleSeven. Cute deflection on his part though, I appreciate the effort.
[deleted]
Two years for my long-term unleveraged trade. Each time we dropped to $6,700 I added more and have a nice little position. I still watch things on very small time scales to understand market behavior though. I have a trading stack that I plan to scale out incrementally if we continue up. That's the plan anyway :)
Saw it actually get eaten, not pulled, seconds after posting

Wow. 7850 . Are u taking profits? 
very little profit with the fees but yes congrats to you too man for holding that short under pressure. Patience wins!
Yes youre right but it did last significantly longer than the last time we were at 6k. As always, "this time is different" is almost never true but maybe crypto markets do move faster now than in 2014. 
The market seems to move faster paced now a-days. 
Yeah, margin short is terrifying. I've only ever spot shorted and am too scared of margin shorting.
Surprised you can log into reddit but not your trading account, too bad.
I plan to add from 8.1-8.25 with stops above 8.35. I'm with you on shorting 9k (or wherever the log line is now). 
If you want to commit to bailing out, then you could make a plan to scale out of the short.  Buy back 30% just above, 30% at break even and 30% below in the profit zone, for example.

You'll still have a decent chance to eat loss, but in the case that the first SL triggers, and then we bounce back up, at least you'll have less loss than if you had it all at break even and it didn't trigger.

If it goes down lower, and all three trigger, it'll have been the same as setting it all at BE.

If you later see you could have made profits after all, don't sweat it, pat yourself on the back for good risk management.
I'm in the exact same position with a short opened at 7935. Agree that a short at the log resistance is a good r/r play, so many people are watching this line.
Shorts squeeze = end of bear market, all bears rekt? 
Man. People are not being excellent to you today.

Oops wrong link but use this site to learn up on some terms 
Whoops, should have checked!
> I bet 75% of people here think we are in a time loop back to 2014.

Lol. That seems extreme. I doubt 75% of the people in here are even bearish at all (right now.)

Personally, I did close most of my short. Bitmex ATH in Google trends. Bitfinex shorts ATH (much lower now though.) Average Joe explaining on Facebook how to short bitcoin. So overall I kinda agree with you, if everyone is shorting.. I would do the opposite.

Still, I think comparisons with previous bubbles can be interesting and calling them "imbeciles" seems unnecessary. I also think it's just a few people here being *that* bearish.
He said new lows so i assumed below 6k, we are probably gonna retest 7kish but breaking 6-7k quickly is highly unøikely
Not 24 hours, it took from march 31st to April 11th to compress that coil and fail to find lower lows.

If we see lower lows, I wouldn't bet on them happening in a shorter time frame than that.
I was touting sub 6k for weeks, but a free fall from 8.5k-9.1k to below 6k is extremely unlikely. There are way too many people waiting to buy the dip.

Not saying we can't go below 6k but if we do, it will be far from a free fall.
OK.
Also, I do whatever MikeXBT says he's doing.
That makes sense. What % of your trading stack do you have in fiat vs BTC right now? 
I was just making an observation that this number is being tossed around a lot. And you know the game, when a certain number starts talking about a lot it becomes a psychological resistance point. We’ve been suppressed for some while now, I’m ready for it to continue upward just as much as the next guy.

I thought it was cool that Bitcoin went on the ride, even though I didn't trade it very well.  It still seemed like a sign that Bitcoin was beginning to react to at least some events that routinely affect other commodities and other markets.
absolutely, that is entirely possible. the question I would ask is, what impact does this action have on the whole world as opposed to just the US? which is to say, what impact does the destabilization of the US executive branch have on other citizens of countries? how will they act differently as a result? what policies will be enacted in response and what effect will they have?  it's unbelievably complex, but I enjoy speculating :)
But TA is anything but statistics. Statistics is a science, TA is voodoo.
Yup, dats a flag 
Aha. Doesn't look very flag-like on my graph. Looks obvious there though.
But.. but I thought you couldn't confirm or deny, Its a catch-22 ;)
Yes looking through his comments are a blast from the past. We've all grown up 'n shit 
I find Oracle and his many accounts extremely annoying...but to be fair, that particular comment that you quoted isn't really wrong then or now. And I say this as an overall Bitcoin bull (and I wish we *did* have significant merchant adoption; even going back to the pace we had around 2013/2014 would be swell).
I was wrong, we MAY have bottomed at 6.5 (i dont know but its possible). I didnt lose a penny from the massive green dildo and im content with that. Whats the problem? 
The guy is a joke. Just trolling all the time.
I'm surprised he wasn't banned from some of his posts though.
no, they didn't stop longing and many were rekt multiple times. so if bears think we're still in a bear market (which we may be) they might continue shorting in the same way the bulls who thought we were still in a bull market kept longing. that make sense?
(they kept longing)
Found the offender. there was a "display: none;" wedged in there by someone at some point.
Deluded bears on suicide watch!
I don't either. It's supposed to be all user friendly, but if it makes the site crappy then who's going to use it? IDK. We'll see.
How is that possible if you bought in November and we closed in December at 15k

You never sold or traded?
Damn it. Don't drink and chart
It's not cynical to me. First of all it's absolutely true that kids who don't know what they're doing regularly get rekt in the market (not saying that's what's happening, but if it were, pointing it out isn't cynical). Second, that's a very welcome development, institution entering the market.
no I do understand you. its not an actual stop loss order but a mental barrier - that changes it a bit. and i've also used the same strategy, trying to time the reversals and get an entry where not losing any money is almost guaranteed.

if you are very patient, this might pay off, but im still not sure if its the most effective approach in terms of making the most money from your limited time.
I was looking at the same, I'm kind of new to swing trading so I'm currently doing paper trades, trying to get the hang of it. But your move sounds legit tho good luck! You use ask/bid sum as indicator as well??
i think we are saying the same thing...
Where do you see a bear trend? I see a big weird spike up, then a couple months down.  When I zoom out six months or a year, it doesn't look bearish at all.
Bull or bear markets don't start or finish in a day. It's too early to declare anything about a the last 48 hrs. 
I thought the point of the 91:1 split was to get the ratio to 1:0.001   If you know otherwise let us know
Did I say that? I'm just saying bitcoin can be manipulated, which you implied was not true.

I'm also saying you're a dick.
You will always sound crazy good sir
Here's someone showing.

Nice.
True lol. 
Right no high percentage gains to be made, man I was dumb for buying at 6800 and buying ETH at 385!

Lol half you guys get a hard on for $100 swings, but yeah this is nothing special
Still have my position open :) just wanted to check back and see how the day traders are doing 
Aww mods saw your edit too late. RIP.
Find a way to do that without violating the rules. Other people seem to be able to follow the rules. I think you can too.
thanks. my bias is on the bull side, so I'm trying to check myself here.   
thanks for the advice bud, much appreciated. 

Same here, trying to max it to 1% because fees are another 0.5%
true. I do like its particular odds at hitting here given its proximity to the log support-turned-resistance, so I've got shorts set up at 8200 and 8250, but if that breaks it'll likely break hard
You could also ask one of the mods in /r/litecoinmarkets

They have the same thing over there.
If you have success I'd be interested to know how you get it working.
Agreed. 
>how much leverage do you usually do in these trades?

10x. 
>  double bubble

nice word. new meme sighted
Last halving was extremely calm, I believe it was largely priced in
A lot of the time, yes.
That's fine if you think so, I don't agree with you. The network has been expanding every year, the greater it gets the more useful bitcoin becomes. When 20% of the world owns bitcoin in their mobile wallets there will be more incentive to accept bitcoin as payments. When more people move past the speculation phase of crypto and begin using it as there's more infrastructure built around it (LN enabled wallets making payments instant and effortless, bitcoin PoS enabled devices, mobile wallets, browser extensions, etc) then yes, payments through bitcoin *will* become convenient both for customers and merchants. When the market cap is in the trillions the volatility will be a non-factor. More people are selling property though bitcoin exactly because of how friction-less and accessible the process is compared transacting though banks. We're not there yet for small purchases but everything unfolding is heading that way. Right now people aren't interested in spending their crypto as they are in speculation, will that change when it's more widely adopted and convenient to transact with? Maybe. I'm not saying you NEED to SWITCH to bitcoin and THEN use it to buy something when you could just use your credit card.... I'm saying it needs to become widely adopted first, which it IS though speculation and as store of value; it needs to grow to a point where volatility is low and liquidity is high; and it needs the infrastructure that makes bitcoin payments effortless and convenient for all parties. If you're saying we're NOT heading that direction then suite yourself.  You sound like a short sighted one-dimensional thinker, no offense. And I'm not saying all this NEEDS to happen for bitcoin to hit $100K, my expectation of bitcoin to become a widely accepted asset class that survives over the next 5 yrs is enough so whether it gets widely used as payments is irrelevant to me. But to say that it will *never* become practical to use bitcoin for payments is just silly, and not worth arguing to be honest... the HARDEST part in this whole experiment was to get people to ACCEPT that something digital and convoluted like Bitcoin CAN be a store of value... and get people to pay hundreds and thousands of dollars just to own some. That's was the hard part, not getting people to use and accept bitcoin when enough people own it and its advantages become apparent 

 
he's already tracked his own trades...lol you don't need to do it again. He has a ~40% loss rate from like early 2017. 

But loss rate doesn't matter, it's how big of a position you take and when you close that matters. 

If you followed his trades at 1x leverage you'd be up like 400% or something. 400% BTC, not fiat, so don't come at me w that hodl nonsense 
If it goes down to low $7Ks wouldn't that worry you?
I mean, if you thought your country may actually get bombed by a world power, would you want to hold your nations fiat or literally anything else?
yeah I wasn't disagreeing just wanted to clarify for the OP
Interesting thanks!
Agree. But still wonder what an adam and eve bottom is?
Yeah, I'd like to see it retrace to about $7800 and bounce. That would give this bull flag more strength, I think. It also seems a drop much lower than that (ie 7600, 7400) could be a sign of lower prices to come.
I made the same bet... but only 5% of my trading stack is leveraged.
(^So ^^short ^^^it ^^^^fucking^^^^^hurts)
you're probably right, though I prefer the more titillating narrative that someone called a whale's bluff and bought their sell wall ;)
No biggie, I change my flair almost everyday based on market conditions and my sentiments/predictions.

EDIT: I had just changed my flair to Bearish just before the pump and the whole market went bullish. lol.

Before the pump, I had a short open, when the prices started to rise, I got margin called whilst driving, immediately somehow closed the short from the previous dip and opened a long to cover the loss as I saw the probability. 

Anyhow, I eventually broke even today plus a couple % profit. Thus I am skeptic right now as I believe the market hasn't turned completely bullish as of yet. :)
Not sure what you are trying to say but I am overly conservative with re-entering my hodl stack and won't til we break the long term resistance from 20k, though DCAing a little bit more is probably a good idea at this point. edit: just not after we've gone up 25% in 28 hours or whatever it is

I dream that if it was here, it could stay focused within the theme of trading.
No, as I mentioned in my post, from the recruiting thread just posted a few weeks ago that jared got pulled from.

Also the differences between those subs run much deeper than subject matter as I know you're aware.

I'm just trying to have a good faith discussion here.
If we did it, it would have to be an experiment at first and tightly moderated. We'll see. We're still trying to all get on the same page about this.
I leave my laptop open next to the bed with cryptowatch alarms, it works nice.
A 5-10 minute delay can be the difference between major gains or a stop loss in the crypto world. I just set alerts on Delta not sure if they are instant or at least in the general ball park of instant. 

Guess I’ll be awake longer than expected for the second night in a row 
Lolwut
Why tf did I never hear about it? That's soo dumb, it's almost hilarious.

Ripple is a settlement layer, a decent company. But XRP literally does not have any usecase or value.
Haha
I thought if they accepted your tax return then you're clear, they probably just have a backlog of checks to process. 
Exactly, currently they don't have the manpower and resources to process it but who's to say they won't come looking for literally billions in owed taxes years down the road? The longer they go without processing everybody the bigger the incentive. 
I'm talking in terms of there being "no activity" on my end regarding crypto. ie. Decentralized exchange, LocalBitcoins
Yeah, I haven't had any problems yet. If I were chasing 2% forever, I'd understand. During high volume, I'll try and grab a little extra and gamble. 

But if I can get to the point where I only need 0.5% per day, that would be great. May lose my position in tokens, but that's okay. I'm not super bull yet. 
Was it really that much volume yest? I missed it, just saw the candle.

But we've had thousand dollar price increases in 24 hours before...? This one was that different?
Thanks for the advice, but I think I understand my financial situation better than you.
Just for clarification. You were referencing the babypips forex trading course correct? 
There's also a rising wedge at play. Violent movements like yesterday and the huge wicks make it hard to draw with certainty, but generally: https://www.tradingview.com/x/TJILelL9/  

If we don't break down off this line or the wedge, I don't see any reason we don't retest the ATH log resistance. If 9K falls (and holds), then charts say we've reversed market trend into a legitimate bull market. That's pretty remarkable.
I use tradingview for actual alarms, but I have a dedicated ticker screen all the time anyway. 
Thanks for the clarification. Yes, I also guess we'd hit that in the 8.7s or 8.8s.
because i want to sleep 
I'm using the standard settings, which were not developed for forex, but for equities. Every book I've ever read about ichi elaborates on the possibility of changing the settings and they all conclude with the same idea: there's just no point. 

At any rate, what's more important than the settings is **understanding the trading signals**. Our fellow redditor here seems to trade 'edge-to-edge' of the kumo, which I have never heard of... and is contrary to the system as it was designed and has been used for nearly 90 years. 

In my mind it's best to learn a system the way it was designed before trying to improve upon it.
> The protocol wasn't fully ready to scale at the time, anyway.

It's still not. Objectively.

As for your other lone point (the one regarding volatility), do we have an index for that? Searched and found this one:

https://imgur.com/a/I2zzj

Although I didn't look into how it was calculated. The volatility during this run is nothing to shake a stick at. It's not decreasing, as you stated (admittedly, relative to 2011? Sure, but the trend is not down since the bear market 2015-2017)

I think the chart OP linked is worth looking at. If for nothing else, the sheer *market dynamics* of runs this size, and subsequent corretions. It's a good comparison if you're not looking at it like gospel (I don't think anyone intelligent would do that, nor do I think OP was suggesting to do so); just add it to the repertoire of items that may or may not be useful in making trading decisions.

I agree with /u/SloppySynapses and the OP, /u/noeeel on this one.
I don't really compare the fundamentals- I'm just talking about the price and the fact that it's a bubble pop and it's playing out similarly so far. when it stops visiting the same %s of ATH I will reconsider, until then it looks no different to me. 

I mean feel free to believe differently and that fundamentals have changed things, but people have been saying that since $15k when very few people believed we'd ever even go sub $9k again.

plus, the reasons for the bear market will always be added in hindsight. we had our re-goxing and several other things that people blamed for the dump from $11.6k. if it happens again, people will come up with reasons for it- they won't show up until *after* it happens (if it does)
Based on this report

[https://willyreport.wordpress.com/2014/05/25/the\-willy\-report\-proof\-of\-massive\-fraudulent\-trading\-activity\-at\-mt\-gox\-and\-how\-it\-has\-affected\-the\-price\-of\-bitcoin/](https://willyreport.wordpress.com/2014/05/25/the-willy-report-proof-of-massive-fraudulent-trading-activity-at-mt-gox-and-how-it-has-affected-the-price-of-bitcoin/)

the willybot was only active till January. the bubble popped in January, so everything afterwards was not affected.

I agree that in 2014 the market overcorrected. So I would not think we see 2700 USD \(&#37; low in the bear market 2014\), but 5k is possible or at least a revisit in the 6ks. 
Or r/bitcoin! :)
Yeah, but I'm not going to. :)
Why is it wrong, only because the bear market folds out faster?
(Not saying we're following the 2014 chart, but if we were...) I think we're actually at the next peak on the 2014 chart. The peak that you're pointing at would be 7500 we had 2 weeks ago.
No this bear market is just moving much faster than his chart indicates.
don't quite understand this analysis. how does the willy bot mtgox fiasco compare to now when the market is completely different?
[deleted]
Good luck!

They decreased during that larger drop 4 hours ago and have been steady since. Shorts have generally been rising slowly during the past 4 hours.
see, isn't this better than name-calling? I appreciate your input
No one who makes claims with absolute conviction and certainty about something that is inherently probablistic should expect to be taken with any kind of seriousness.  
especially after we took a breather.

You took off your flair?!
Except that using cruise missiles means more orders with Boeing.

If he uses more bombs and missiles, he's actually on their team.

Everyone is happy so long as he doesn't reveal just how much the CIA was involved with arming the "enemy", or who is actually behind various chemical attacks.
The theory goes, that he would phrase a short/long and get his alt accounts to agree with him/ make his trade look like it had serious legs. I definitely read several phishy conversations here. For all we know he was a whale manipulating people into buying/selling right beneath/above his walls. 
> He was a bit of an a$$hole though...very rude.

Don't be so hard on yourself, man!
Had a big short position all day, decided to switch to a long an hour ago @ 8060. Barely escaped liquidation. If we revisit 7800 I'm toast. I just can't win. I know it's my fault for playing high stakes. But damn.
Now 7950. I don't think people will dump with conviction unless it hits sub 7400.
Nope, not yet. Might be greed, but I'm looking a little lower. 7750 or so.
Thinking about opening up a long by staggering buys on the way down. 7400-7700. Thoughts? 
Idk why people keep saying this, if anything it’s the opposite. The run up to 20k lasted like 2 years. The run to 1200 lasted like 4 months. The correction seems to be playing out similarly, at a slower pace, the dcb in 2014 was 4 weeks after the pop, and the 2018 dcb (6k->11.7k) was 8 weeks after the pop. 
funny you're saying that. i started trading crypto during the December bull run. i thought smashing through the thousands was a norm. lol
Great strat. Thank you 
What are your stops at
Probably not bro. The log support turned resistance at 8.5 offers a much better r/r short entry imo and 8050 is holding up pretty damn well right now despite low volume. 

Goodluck on your trade. You're probably right about us taking a trip south considering the convergence of bear divs and overbought conditions. 
It's ok. I'm not always excellent to others either :P
This is warning #3 for you for not being excellent. I'm temp banning your for 7 days.
I'm currently at ~25% fiat. I think we're approaching the end of the current run-up and am scaling in sells up to ~8400 where I think there will be a reasonable correction and accumulation(7700-7900). 
Yeah, those numbers can be self-fulfilling prophesies for sure.  

This time I think we are headed for another doubling after the correction.  It's happened so many times over the years, and this dip seems so manufactured that I can't help but think the market will correct by resuming upward trajectory for at least a few weeks.  I think we'll hit $12-13K by the time all this shakes out, maybe higher.
Up, down, or sideways, I'm always buying.  Works out well over time. But someone else will buy it, a lot of someones. It's still very early.  Only a very few people have any Bitcoin, and most people who do are still accumulating.
The problem with TA is that you can always twist it to fit your narrative.  If you want the price to go up or down you can zoom out, redraw from somewhere else until it confirms your bias.

The same twisting can be done with any statistic but that doesn't mean its not useful when used appropriately.  Saying TA means nothing is like saying statistics mean nothing because they're not always right.
[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/5htrek/someone_finally_developed_that_mythical_lightning/db3qwz0/) is another silly comment, from when Bitcoin was $790. The naysayers are always proved wrong in a couple  of years' time.
Dude look at your post history, not a single trade or call made. I've been shorting since 10.8. Yeah sometimes i got a bit hysterical with my bearishness but plop on a plunger if you're going to talk shit like a twatpuppet. And as if 6k was a ridiculous possibility while we sat at 6.6.
> no, they didn't stop longing

I did :P I went from longing almost all of the time to longing almost none of the time
Yep. Thanks.
I'm in disbelief! 
Twitter and tradingview do it too. I wonder if it is a way to keep people on your website longer. Because when those same page pop ups happen, you can’t get out by hitting back button. That’s probably not the reason but I have no clue what is. 
bought around 15, held through 20, still holding. I went in with the mindset of holding 1 year at the least 
i treat this purely as gambling. instead of popping down to the bookies and slapping a tenner down on man united, i instead gamble on btc moves lol.

The way i approach it: i will have a theory about where the price might go based on S/R, then i look if indicators make my theory plausible then i fix my R:R and gamble.

Paper trading is deffo a good start imo but getting some money in the market is a learning experience too but that comes later. 

I did not use the ask/bid sum indicator but ill look into it, sounds interesting. good luck to you too mate
To be honest I'm surprised that you got downvoted for your post because I actually agree with you. I mean, maybe I'm wrong and bitcoin actually is experiencing a reversal, but I still don't really buy it. This doesn't mean that you should immediately put in a short position but I can't really think of any reason for the price to have gone up beyond "some whales decided it should do".
agree
Wasn't aware of the split, my bad.
I didn't say it wasn't true, I said it's exhausting. As in, who gives a fuck!?

You just regurgitated what I'm so fucking tired of hearing about...

Getting rekt tonight, I see.
You are "dumb" for saying "you miss gains if you don't make a move" - that's a horrific mindset to have
Being right doesn't mean it was a smart play, was the whole point.  
I respect everyone here, in fact I'm the most respectful person you'll find. And through that respect I felt the need to talk tough based on current sentiment. Sorry for my tough words but I'll stop. You all can lose your money then for all I care, carry on :P

Sorry I'm not fake like the rest hahah.
This sub is so much more refreshing than /r/cryptocurrency.  I have nothing valuable to add, but I appreciate the comparative amount of realism here.  Actually trying to figure out the state of the market instead of screaming.  Makes me want to learn how to get into trading.
Someone really, really doesn't want 8K to fall. That rejection was quick. I'm setting stops at breakeven, because if we can't break 8K out of a rising wedge / bear flag / descending triangle combo, then I don't want any part of this. 
np, this is pretty normal and healthy for a reversal, even short to medium term.

It was difficult not to FOMO in above $8k...

Below $7.7k and I'd worry just about being underwater, this can still retrace to $7.3/7.5 and still recover quite well 
It just needs some css. The ticker is still in /u/AutoModerator 's flair.
I've got it working... just need to figure out the exchange order.

It's just CSS. A script somewhere is automatically updating /u/AutoModerator 's flair with the price.
Would people stop saying a "store of value"? So are beanie babies but they're about as liquid as a diamond from Kay Jewlers.

The fact is, there's no more than 5 billion cash sitting in crypto and that amount hasn't really changed in the past 6 months.

Nobody gives a rats ass about "frictionless" in a payment system except merchants. From the spender's side, money *appears* to be instant because the current system either uses credit or a balance check (and subsequent hold on funds) when you run a card. From the receiver's side, it takes 5 business days but that's just a T-5 problem in a longer term steady state or cyclic cashflow process. So T-5 is simply an initial condition that is irrelevant at T=50 as T=50 === T=51 === T=52.

Therefore the receiver doesn't care either. The only people that care are the ones that benefit from ancillary things such as the ability to avoid government controls (i.e. criminals).

Joe Mainstreet doesn't give two shits about bitcoin as a payment system because he already lives hand to mouth. So he just wants a currency whose value is relatively stable against the goods he's buying.

Crypto will *never* be that because it's extremely niche and therefore has a ton of volatility against the goods it's suppose to be used for.
Below $7.3k would probably be concerning to me. I've got the bids in the $7.4k to $7.6k range. Right now it doesn't feel like they stand too much of a chance of filling.
Bulls are relentless on this 8k resistance line. Bounce of 75-100$ every time. I honestly don’t think it will hold every time unless we make the push for 8.2k+ again. But I’m Biased because I’m holding an underwater shirt

Edit: Short ( Tend to do this a lot ) 
alright.

Im not trading this. Withdrawing coins and going to have a good weekend. My gut told me to short at 8100, now my gut tells me to sit tight 
Similar size order just appeared again, pretty convinced its manipulation.
skeptic means you're skeptical of the tech- not being "bullish." 

you can be bearish and believe in the tech, isn't "bearish" more suitable for you?
Impressive!
Am I discussing in bad faith? I understand what you want, but I don't want to do the work to accomplish it, and I don't even want to *see it accomplished* because most alts are outright scams.
I'm so fascinated by you guys. Happy im just a dca newbie so I can sleep at night. 
my internet consistently goes out at 3-5 am :(
yes, this happened. When XRP spiked to almost 4 dollars, the founder of Ripple Labs was richer than Jeff Bezos for almost ten minutes
https://www.google.ch/amp/s/www.valuewalk.com/2018/01/ripple-co-founder-chris-larsen-richest-man-world/amp/
Yes, I think the acceptance notice is only a receipt for your filing.
DEX and privacy coins are going to get things real interesting.   I just wonder how we're going to go from fiat to crypto or reverse and not have it traced, I'm sure even with local bitcoin they're tracing people sending money to each other, I mean over 10k they automatically get triggers and the bank reports it.   I just see it too easy for them at the moment to catch people. If they have billions owed, believe they will make the resources to get it. 
[deleted]
That one has significantly higher volume.zoom out on trading  view, I can't see a larger fiat volume candle since October. 

Someone else noted the statistic yesterday 
probably but anyone who thinks they're going to make a living off of trading is usually...not 
yep - good general foundation before focusing on a specific market. also will help with terminology, etc
Yes agree, although I have it drawn like this : https://www.tradingview.com/x/Y6R4xuld/

support turned resistance is holding so far but that candle is like a battering ram. I'm getting less and less confident with my 7950 short by the minute
so what's your play? The rising wedge broke down, but the price is taking it sweet time to go down. I think the fomo is too strong for your 7750 target, I'd be happy to close my short in the high 7.9 at a loss. 


Thank you.
price stability increased until 2017. In 2017 we never approached levels of volatility seen in 2013.

Of course volatility increased when the entire year was the buildup to a bubble. The point is that volatility is lower than 2013, not that it's lower than ever.
For the percentages to be similar we would have started another run at 28k that took us over 300k. 
Willybot caused the pump, not the dump.

Guess that makes more sense.
What do you mean? Both charts show a range of November-April in pretty much lock step. 
Been here since 2011. Have the bitcointalk account to prove it. 
so why has the price followed incredibly similar patterns? 
The 3 Magical longs are definitely helping  right now 
Same thing. Just 1/lambda
yea. I still can't believe that green candle, it was truly insane
The lack of competence to deal with an emerging technology is definitely call-center level of “techy”. Yes, great idea, “let’s implement a country-wide ban to make up for our lack of diligence and technological understanding, as it poses a threat to our already frail, incompetently-run economy.”
Neutral right now

Today's situation was a hard one. Strong indicators like bearish divergence on several time frames, etc, showed a dump, but price action was still showing a pump. .... I'm not positive this will continue to dump hard, though. I'm personally watching 7800-7850 closely for a rebound, because I don't think the bull flag is invalidated until under that point. ... edit: obviously the small bull flag would be invalided, but not the large one from yesterday. edit2: a bounce at 7800 would make one of our new "classic" bart patterns, and we'd continue on our merry way.
I'm hoping for a larger dump, but I think 7800 +/- will be a big number to watch.
could be a good play with stops a 7.3, but i don't know man I think 7800 can hold
honestly I currently don't have a stop and I'm monitoring this. Rising wedge on the 4h would say 8250 for a break out but as u/DushmanKush said a wick to 8.3 before a retrace could rekt that stop.. 

EDIT: no retrace at all is also possible I think, if you look at previous big falling wedge formation (for example the one we broke out of on 18/3),  there was no retrace before the log resistance, it was a 2000$ move up. I feel like the bulls are out and we'll see the same here.
You definitely take a different tone when the price is going down- ridiculing, etc.  For what it’s worth, I prefer the tone you’ve used today.  
Which would be a nice little break out of the major descending line from ATH. I can dig that

TA in a volatile speculative market is at most a self fulfilling propchecy used by whales to better manipulate the market. Traders follow some form of TA because they're peer pressured to do so. If I were a whale I'd paint the charts to reap profits. 
See, i think you're a goof, but I still read your comments and insight because you at least *admit* you can be a goof. 

Plus you post your position and reasoning why which is good. 
I'm not interested by posting that I'm short or long, not my way and you don't have to judge my history as I'm actually respecting the rules of this sub. I'm a participant that's all. 

You didn't respect those rules many times and your way of speaking and talking shit to people is disgusting. 

Your ISIS reference was even more disgusting and had clearly nothing to do on this sub. 

That's also why I was surprised you didn't take a ban, that and insulting other people like you're a god. You're not. Your prediction are sometime ridiculous yes and your way of shoving your opinion in people's throat is also disgusting.

We don't need people being disrespectful. You can have the right calls, if you don't use the proper communication then you can keep your insight for yourself.
yeah well you're one of the smart ones lol
here comes the drop. see you at 7500
yeah no worries then, no taxes. But you can not claim a loss until you sell and realize that loss
In your own words: cry me a river
I mean I guess, I'm not saying to always make a move, because sometimes doing nothing is the best thing to do.

But come on man, if you could of loaded up on BTC at 6500 and rode that up to 8200 your telling me you wouldn't be happy about that? 

You miss 100% of the shots you don't take
I find your comment valuable, bud. Try this for the learning:

https://www.babypips.com/
I hear you dude. I'm considering moving my stops up from $7,900ish to closer to $8,000 since there is good support and dropping below $8,000 would likely cause us to go lower. Hesitating to put stops that close to the current price level, but I *think* it makes sense. I guess I could see a quick drop below $8,000 and then a big bounce which would screw me, so yeah idk
Maybe "someone" needs more time to unload at good prices and suddenly the support will disappear.
Right, you need some external script that uploads an image, changes flairs, edits sidebar text, or something. There's no way to have dynamic data in subreddit that's not being updated by an external bot I don't think.
>Would people stop saying a "store of value"? So are beanie babies 


>Nobody gives a rats ass about "frictionless" in a payment system except merchants.


>Crypto will never be that because it's extremely niche and therefore has a ton of volatility against the goods it's suppose to be used for.

Lol 


You should know by now to never say *never* in crypto... anyway, you're just repeating the same points based on what you see now, completely ignoring what I said about there needing to be a lot of growth first. And if you're really implying that beanie babies serve the same utility as bitcoin in terms of savings or unit of value then I can't tell if you're trolling 
I think it's better to take your shirt off before you jump in the water
Told you couple of days ago this might happen. Sitting this out is smart choice.
Yeah, R/R is low here. I'm hoping it will drop some so I can increase my position.
> skeptic means you're skeptical of the tech- not being "bullish." 

Correct, but there are times when I loose faith in the tech sadly. 

However, I think I will take your advise. I will be bullish again as I have a nice long entry. Cheers! :)
Thats fcking insane. 
I don't know in the past I've filed taxes and immediately had them denied, usually correcting details about insurance/retirement or whatever fixed them. 

Unless you're raking in hundreds of thousands in gains or more I wouldn't worry about being audited, they have bigger fish to fry. 
Yeah. Doesn't bother me. Not trying to make millions here.
Again, not making a living. Said it's my source of income. Doesn't mean I'm depending on it.
It's debatable whether you should really count the wick on a massive squeeze/overshoot. I tend not to, but being consistent is the most important bit. 
I'm holding it for now. Feels precarious (propped up) at the moment. Path of least resistance should be down. There's probably a lot of longs set to bail/liquidate under 8K. 
No, that wasn't the point. And if it was, you certainly were not clear about it. You said:

> Bitcoin is gradually reducing volatility.

Details matter. Like uhh, over what time frame? It has *not* decreased in volatility over the past 3 years. Since it's inception? Ok, I am with you there. But then, what conclusion are you trying to draw? I don't know what your point is, at all.



I just use ATH at the time of the pop, not the growth from before. There will obviously be huge differences in growth from before because bitcoin had a significantly smaller market cap and much less liquidity- going from $1 to $2 wasn't the same as $10k to $20k

regardless, you really only have to look at the charts to see the similarities so far with regards to % ATH, it's not like I'm just making it up. If you don't want to have it hanging over your head until we pass $12k that's fine and totally reasonable, but it will for me because I don't wanna get burned, ya know?
We dont know what caused the pump this time. Can be 100&#37; organic, or some hidden forces behind the scenes. Enough cash was in to bring it there. looking at the market, I doubt it is the later. Some whale bought cheap 6k coins, made an big pump and expects we buy the coins for him for 8k, than he can dump the rest until he gets into profit. 
No, this is the top of the daily thread.. I do read the daily threads. And yes I did reply to specifically you, fair enough, considering I don't comment here often and mostly lurk.
Whoa, more excellence please.
Not even close it took 128 days for btc to bottom out before double top in 2014. In 2018 it took 51 days.  Double top came in at 210 days in 2014, and 78 days in 2018.

>Just 1/lambda

There’s an exponent k on the lambda and k! in the denominator

More precisely, an exponential distribution describes the probabiliy distribution of a continuous random variable that takes values in the non-negative range and the Poisson Distribution describes the probability distribution of a discrete random variable.

There is a connection between the two, however.
>In probability theory and statistics, the exponential distribution (also known as negative exponential distribution) is the probability distribution that describes the time between events in a Poisson point process, i.e., a process in which events occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution

Which is basically example2 from the link above
If we get a red candle just as big we could have our first Marge.
> He sounds like a moron if he thought that posting in here and getting a couple of people to agree with him would actually push the price in his favored direction.

Sure, it sounds dumb. But this is just theory, nothing he ever said himself. 

> Although there is a great deal of bullshit posts in here sometimes that try to affect the market. It would take multiple accounts though and still seems like way too much work for the reward.

Or maybe we just got curious, about a guy who seemed suspicious, but intelligent.. and vanishes right before, the bullrun to kill them all? Who knows, maybe we are just bored and looking to fill in the time with r/Bitcoinmarkets conspiracy hour?! :D 
cashed out half my position at a huge loss, escaped total liquidation by $5 barring we don't revisit 7800-7840. Went long at 8060 with way-too-high leverage after switching out from my equally high leverage short. If I had held the short I would've made very good $$$ but I guess it was stupid either way. 

Was also trading with my whole trading stack since it's only a few k. Time to take my place in the hall of shame.

Edit: sold out of my whole position. i'm sure we'l bounce back to 8000 now that i've sold. time to evaluate why i make such stupid moves
Just took profits with 15% at 7825. 
Set a buy for a small long at 7802. Will close on a bounce if it reaches 7.9k+ 
If you bought on any of 330 days last year, you're way up right now.  Same will be true this time next year.  Nobody ever regrets buying Bitcoin over time, but boy do they regret selling it!  

Now is an excellent time to buy, by the way.  The price is artificially low and definitely won't stay down here for long.
lol well if u were smarter I would've longed this! 
Lol man I deserve this. Y'all ain't making money from me though, im not the fool that went long here. 
Metaphorically, I am indeed creating a river of pain.
Ofc, I'd be very happy!  (I played various runs within that, but not the entire 6.5->8.2).  But I hear "you have to make a move" all the time as an excuse to encourage gambling, as a lot of the people here are just gamblers.
I'll take a look. Thanks! 
That's what I'm thinking. Maybe I should nudge my stops up a little bit. We've knocked on 8050 4 times this afternoon...maybe the Friday evening hammer will fall after all.
Yeah, if I had to do that to I would probably make a bot with python and run it from the moon math server.

to do it with CSS alone would require referencing a file that doesn't allow browser caching.
> completely ignoring what I said about there needing to be a lot of growth first

Firewire needs a lot of growth first before it'll be adopted by the masses. The problem is it never was because USB was more convenient, cheaper, and people *already* had it so they had no reason to switch.

You're making a chicken and egg argument that has no economic basis. "It needs more people to switch before it'll get people".

If it had a solid value proposition, people would switch over on their own accord. The problem is that it doesn't because the sender side doesn't see the benefit from a payment standpoint. Even if merchants were to offer a discount for using it instead of a CC, it wouldn't be any greater than 2%, which isn't worth switching except for extremely large purchases (over $10k). The problem is extremely few people use a CC for large purchases. They either use a check, ACH, or wire transfer. All of which are cheaper (than crypto) and plenty fast enough.

From an economic standpoint, bitcoin can't compete against legacy payment systems because they're frankly cheaper than crypto. At the end of the day that's what people care about the most. The places where bitcoin accels are where services are overpriced (such remittance) or the legacy systems won't offer service (for whatever reason). Unfortunately remittance costs have gone down as new companies like Walmart enter the game to compete with Western Union (which ran a monopoly on it for decades). So that only leaves bitcoin with the markets that the banking system won't service.

That is namely online gambling (for countries that outlaw it) and criminal services.
I do this way too much 
Yeah. Should have shorted at 8100, but the bull in me told me not to
that’s my plan.

If we go too far, might be time to bail, but Im looking to
long above 7500 and bail to a hedge sub 7500. I’d probably set stops to be fully hedged by 7300
Ah, I see. Does the market manipulation make you lose faith? Just curious

Sure hope you're right - I truly am small krill.
2% per day is trying to make millions unless you're consistently cashing out 

the fact that you don't realize how much 2% per day is is a red flag 

those are absolutely retarded returns 
thanks for the tip. It's more of a [channel](https://www.tradingview.com/x/oJb4CNzw/) then. Not unlike when we broke out of the falling wedge of [march 18](https://www.tradingview.com/x/8mkxQWhb/)
Thank you for changing my argument for me. I had no idea that I wasn't comparing the 2013 and 2017 bubbles.
Here's another measure of stability for you

http://bitcoinstability.github.io/bitcoinstability/#/stability
But then you're comparing a two year buildup to a two month buildup.
It's just... It's different. We're in a different place. 2013/2014 is imperfectly similar and getting less and less similar. That's really what I trying to get across. It's not a radical position. Of course it's getting less similar!
lurking...stalking.. that's a short path ;)
Well he is stalking me. Passive aggressive non-excellence is his well-refined and highly skilled speciality.

Calling it how it is. Language is irrelevant on this one, the guy is in the wrong.
51 days for 2018? Premature to call a bottom right now, isn't it? 
You sound like every single "This time it's different" guy that I've talked to. Every single bubble. Every single pop. Bitcoin isn't going to hit an ATH anytime soon. It will slowly bleed out with a few fake outs along the way just like it has every single bubble.




> Because every single bubble follows a similar pattern.

.......that's exactly why we compare it to 2014 o_O
If we compare it to the dotcom bubble, than we should have gone way lower. 
Yeah guess you're right that it's technically exponential that gives it the memoryless property between blocks. I was just thinking for one block since exponential is just the summation of iid Poisson's it'd be equivalent.
I would be completely dumbfounded if we saw a red candle that large. The green one was a short squeeze, we don't have any firepower to dump through to $7k 


You gotta lose in order to learn how to win. it's all part of the game. 

I think your issue was trading high leveraged positions on relatively volatile ranges, don't overleverage when it's plausible to go either way hard
Sorry to hear that. I think many of us make stupid moves more often that we'd like to admit. I know I do!
where are you trading that the price reached 7802? its already 7.9k so nice job you're killing it
I'm going to teak a little break and see where the price goes in the next few hours, keeping that short today got me mentally exhausted 
feeling pretty good about my entries at $6,700, managed to get about 80% of planned investment in there, and actually added at $6,700 three different times ;)
I am long from 6800, but I think i will move my stop to just below 7800 for now. If bitmexico allows it. I could se a correction hitting 7500 then 7200 and if things go baaad 6900
no problem dude. also, you can contribute without TA/trading expertise by sharing: news events that you feel are germane to the market, mistakes you've made that you've learned from, or really any other thought that pops into your head. as long as you can articulate *why* you feel the way you do, you'll be fine. ignore the village idiots, filter out the bad, take the good and make it your own. welcome.
That's what I do for ticker in /r/cryptocurrency (currently undergoing renovation, changing from image at top of sub to text in the sidebar plus image of coin symbols that will display in header) - python script on vps.
That value you get out of Firewire vs USB is comparable. 

The value you get from bitcoin over fiat/banking/creditcards is significant: 

- No one can freeze or take your money

- No credit card fees or double spending

- No authority dictating what you can or can't do business with (ex- legal marijuana) 

- Transactions instant... someone from China wants 1000$ today to spend he'll get it in 30 mins, not 24 hrs from now (weekdays only) via wire transfer and waiting for different banks to communicate. And yes, things like LN *will* make transactions instant whether you want to admit it or not.

- Deflationary vs Inflationary... your dollar savings is guaranteed to lose significant purchasing power in 10yrs, bitcoin most likely will gain significantly in 10yrs. Yeah sure we just lost 70% of its value, but it's in the price discovery phase and it's volatile. By design you know bitcoin can't be created or printed at will, price has been on an overall uptrend since creation and more people are realizing that... that's the reward you get for the volatility 



Same here. Got freaked out on that last 8.2 push and decided it's too risky.

But TBH, big part of that pump were stop loses on shorts. Still don't think it's gonna hold but I did expect move to 8 but not in one shot so it still scares me off.
Manipulation alone does not. But as I mentioned, the volatility, the exchanges (when you need them at the right time), and of course, the small time window to make right decisions/entries.
Did I say I was going to do this forever? My goal is to make a little extra, stopping at 2% per day and not risking any higher. Not saying I'm trying to do it every day either. Only at opportune times. 

After a week, I have a month's worth of extra wages so I can be a little more considerate when looking for a job. I quit my job voluntarily so I can pursue something I actually enjoy. 
woof. If we do that, we'll be knock knock knockin on a bull market.
I'm not changing your argument, man. When you say something like "BTC is gradually reducing volatility", I expect to find a downtrend in the volatility index that is notable. You have to admit the *trend* isn't there. 

Just say, "Bitcoin is less volatile than it was in 2013" and be done with it. Then we can say, "What's your point? What are you trying to say about Bitcoin volatility that can't be explained via exchange infrastructure, # of people in the user base, media exposure, etc.". 

Or is that the point? What does that say about the price, or about the market movements of the bubble?

You just got like half way through a point, and stopped.
I was careful to mention that I didn't look at how it was calculated, and you'll have to trust me that I didn't cherry pick the chart (just searched the first site on google).

I'm not understanding what I am looking at; what is the weighted stability? It's a very interesting chart, nonetheless, but it requires some info on how that is calculated. It doesn't seem to correlate in the past few months, it looks very off. I'll see if I can find some numbers. Thanks for posting.
I mean couldn't you argue the two year buildup was there???

did BTC really have an extended bear market before 2014? 

regardless, like I said, comparing the % ATH at time of pop has been consistently insightful for me. It meant longing at $10-12k on first dump, shorting at $17k on the DCB runup, longing at $6k on the massive V dump, shorting at $11.7k on the run-up then (possibly) longing again at $6-7k.
Next time report it, and if you genuinely feel like this poster is stalking you send us mods a message with some links.
Not calling the bottom.

For one block it’s the diff between the Poisson at block N+1 and block N, which is why its the exponential distribution

This breaks down the relation quite well

https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/2092/relationship-between-poisson-and-exponential-distribution
Yeah It was a joke. A bear can dream...
100% right of course
I was desperate to recover a loss from earlier in the week and set that amount as my target. i know that's the #1 thing not to do but greed/anger work on the brain in powerful ways.
> No one can freeze or take your money

Affects very few people. The poor don't have any money to freeze or take and the rich have their money invested in things to make them more. So the only people who are affected are those who leave their money in cash (which are an extremely microscopic minority).

> No credit card fees or double spending

Double spending is extremely hard if not impossible. I haven't faced an overdraft in absolutely forever cause my card gets declined if there's not enough balance to cover the purchase.

CC's do the same if there's not enough credit left on the account.

Fees? Already explained the fee issue. Merchants would have to actively discount the sale and make sure it's shown so the customer would know. Even then, the most they'd offer is 2% (*maybe* 3% in a few cases). Nobody's switching and taking on the hassle for 2%.

> Transactions instant...

Nobody cares about instant except for remittance or P2P.

> someone from China wants 1000$ today to spend he'll get it in 30 mins

That's remittance/P2P. If you're talking in terms of his paycheck, then it's the same as the T-5 idea that was already discussed for cashflow with merchants.

Instant transfers aren't actually worth what people seem to believe because they only matter if they're a one time thing or the payments wildly vary (in which case, that's what lines of credit are for).

> Deflationary vs Inflationary

Piss poor argument cause only a moron leaves his money in cash. All but and extreme few leave their value invested in assets which provide a return to counter inflation (and almost always provide a return *above* inflation).

The people that don't, don't have enough money to worry about inflation on the money they're holding as they're living hand to mouth already.

In the long run, bitcoin can't provide a return above that of inflation. Therefore it's an inferior investment to other asset classes. What it does is *hedge* hyper inflation or worse, currency implosion. The problem is that hedges almost always provide a lower rate of return vs other asset classes (especially once judged against the implied risk). Bitcoin is a really shitty asset compared to other hedging classes as well such as gold because it has a much lower intrinsic value relative to it's spot.
I think if we drop down sub 7k, thats when things get interesting. Because then 4-5k is still on the table. If 7500 holds, then thats bullish as hell.
Your assuming that you will not incur losses is not a sound plan imo. 

I don't mean to come off as annoying or overly cautious but the fact that you think such consistent returns are feasible is really a big red flag. If you are a great trader then go ahead, do your thing. otherwise I'm skeptical of such enormous returns 
Bubbles increase volatility. We're comparing peaks and valleys. THe peaks are lower and the valleys are higher when you look at distinct **bubbles**. There are only handful of years of data, though. On the other side of this bubble we're seeing stability increase again. I'm projecting that will continue and that the valleys will get higher and the peaks will get lower in **future bubbles**

You are changing my argument by changing the context that my words were meant for.

**Of course a bubble year has higher volatility**
There was a ninja edit
It's showing what we're both talking about. Just another lens.

"Weighted" is kind of like a running average. 

Higher values mean more stability.
If you include the 2 year buildup then we should have gone over 300k for a similar percent increase.

Sure, there are similar shapes. We agree on that.
> it took 128 days **for btc to bottom out before double top** in 2014. **In 2018 it took 51 days**

I'm not saying that you're calling the bottom over all. Just the bottom between the double tops. 



You seem offended and rude. Is everything ok? 
His argument is that he's short and don't want BTC to break up for good.
> . a 72% fall is not that different from a -85% fall.

It's quite different, actually. Would you say an 86% drop is similar to a 99% drop?

because that's the difference between $200 and $2800

the diff between 72% and 85% is what, $3k to $5.6k? It's almost a 100% difference when starting from $3k

percentages downwards are misleading when looked at as flat numbers
I didn't say it follows the poisson distribution. I said it follows a poisson process.
lmao it would be insane and would completely kill this thing
Yup I agree. I am underwater from $7880, it was very difficult holding through that but I knew objectively it was more likely to move down than up so I held instead of closing/longing. Here down to $7500 would be the place to go long.

Good luck, I assume you have more in reserves since you sound like a LTHer? Take a break for a week or two or try much lower leveraged positions and ease your way back into it. 
> Affects very few people. The poor don't have any money to freeze or take and the rich have their money invested in things to make them more.

In terms of money, it affects a lot of it... think about having a pocket swiss bank account that's reliable and secure. That's value. A handful of rich people will bring in more capital than thousands of poor people, and as usual the people with money will enter first and drive up the value of BTC before the rest get in, the larger the market cap the less volatile it becomes

>Double spending is extremely hard if not impossible. I haven't faced an overdraft in absolutely forever cause my card gets declined if there's not enough balance to cover the purchase.

I meant chargebacks, people denying credit card purchases after the transaction has been made, it affects a decent number or merchants

>Fees? Already explained the fee issue. Merchants would have to actively discount the sale and make sure it's shown so the customer would know. Even then, the most they'd offer is 2% (maybe 3% in a few cases). Nobody's switching and taking on the hassle for 2%.

They don't have to discount, it will take time but I'm imagining a point where enough people will already own bitcoin and the infrastructure of apps and checkout systems that accept bitcoin will be so seamless that it won't be a big deal, or even more convenient, for people to just spend their bitcoin gains. 

>In the long run, bitcoin can't provide a return above that of inflation. Therefore it's an inferior investment to other asset classes. What it does is hedge hyper inflation or worse, currency implosion. The problem is that hedges almost always provide a lower rate of return vs other asset classes (especially once judged against the implied risk). Bitcoin is a really shitty asset compared to other hedging classes as well such as gold because it has a much lower intrinsic value relative to it's spot.

Bitcoin has outperformed every other asset class since 2009. Intrinsic value? C'mon now... not this garbage again


Also I don't get your overall point... are you saying Bitcoin's a bad investment? Or just that it will never be widly *used* for payments? Either way, you're arguing against history... claiming that the trend we've been seeing so far is going to end, using the same logic you could've used when bitcoin was $10
Agreed
But I made my money for the day and am out! So going to eat lunch and focus on other things. Enjoy your day.
How do you know what my assumptions are? I said average. So sometimes, I will get more than that and sometimes I will get less. Yes, I can get burned in the case of a quick crash, but I'm not holding long enough for that to happen and set proper stop losses so I don't lose too much. 

I'm not new to trading and I'm doing just fine. I ease on the side of caution. I miss out on the big pumps, but I also miss out on the big crashes.
>I'm projecting that will continue and that the valleys will get higher and the peaks will get lower in future bubbles

>You are changing my argument by changing the context that my words were meant for.

>Of course a bubble year has higher volatility

I just want to make sure my argumentative tone isn't misguided: You're saying that *this* bubble (assuming you think it's one), has been less volatile than the last. *Further*, you expect the *next* bubble to be even less volatile. I'm assuming you think that for a plethora of reasons, that you haven't outlined, but I'll go with that (because I can think of a bunch of reasons myself).

So..... Is that indicating some sort of market maturity to you? Bitcoin Ala mainstream? I just want to mention the point about only "2" bubble data points in passing here.....

I mean, I'm with you if that's the point. Although I certainly wouldn't have gone through the convoluted way at arriving to that conjecture. The same arguments for *why* bitcoin volatility has decreased comparatively to 2013 is more of an indicator for a maturing market. Number of exchanges, LBTC volume, crypto market cap, media attention, etc. are all much more direct indicators as to how this space is expanding/maturing.

Am I way off base here, or are we talking about the same thing?
> Higher values mean more stability.

Naw, I'm a numbers guy. I have to see what you mean in math. I have a feeling you mean "Higher values mean more stability for fluctuations *of the same maginitude*, when comparating *market prices* of different magnitudes.
> If you include the 2 year buildup then we should have gone over 300k for a similar percent increase.

like I said, the upwards % changes will continue to decrease over time due to liquidity, higher market cap and more market participants. the downwards % changes seem relatively consistent so far, although arguably they have contracted over time and thus $6k could have been "the bottom" due to this. 

My only point here is that I'm waiting for $12k to break before going all in and expecting it to moon again, just like most other people here
I mean it's about par for the course for anyone defending that this time it's different. They ALL start to get defensive when their arguments hinge upon arguing that *fundamentals* actually matter for a bubble, which is, by definition, an asset that ignores fundamentals after a certain point

This is just a sematic difference. A Poisson Process os a generalization of a Poisson Random Variable whose outcomes lie in a generalized state space.

The block height for forward-looking time horizons follows a Poisson distribution, i.e. is a Poisson Process while the block time between two subsequent blocks follows an exponential distribtuion (because it’s simply the difference between two subsequent Poisson processes)

i.e. given that we are at t=0, the probability that at time t+1 > t (unit time increment), the block height is +1 is lambda*e^-lambda, +2 is lambda^2/2*e^-lambda etc

the exponential distribution lets you drill down into the +1 scenario and explore the probability distribution over arbitrary time frames (as oppose to observations per unit time)

This is, by the way, helping me solidify my understanding and the reason I am writing it
> In terms of money, it affects a lot of it... think about having a pocket swiss bank account that's reliable and secure. That's value. A handful of rich people will bring in more capital than thousands of poor people, and as usual the people will money will enter first and drive up the value of BTC

Swiss bank accounts were used as ways to evade taxes. They don't work for that anymore cause the banks will simply hand over account owners. Coinbase's lost case against the DoJ over account information and wallet transactions (which can be traced back to wallets), means your shit's not hidden anymore. Better to pay the taxes rather than end up in prison for tax fraud.

The only way you could actively work that angle is the vast majority of people moved over to crypto and dropped fiat. That will never happen because if it even *looks* like that would happen, governments would outlaw crypto as it'd cut in their ability to collect taxes and therefore they'd most all of their power (which governments aren't in the business of doing).

> I meant chargebacks, people denying credit card purchases after the transaction has been made, it affects a decent number or merchants

Fraud is in the range of 5-7% for most industries. There are ways to significantly reduce that at scale. For smaller merchants, even if they offered the full difference in fraud rates as discount at checkout, that'd still only bring it to 8% max. Realistically, they'd split the difference (since crypto takes money to implement) and you'd see more like a 4-5% discount.

Now crypto faces *at least* 2% of volatility risk. So now that 4-5% discount is reduced to 2-3%. That's not worth the hassle of changing.

The only way that would work is if your *bank account* had direct access to crypto so you only had to hold crypto long enough for that purchase. Of course even that faces problem because then you've only reduced the volatility risk to confirmation time, which is still at least 1%.

So again, it's not worth the savings except for large purchases, which have cheaper and better options.

> Bitcoin has outperformed every other asset class since 2009.

So did investing in Uber or AirBnB. The problem is those are *private* assets. Crypto represented a shift because it was a way for people to invest in the pre-IPO stages of an asset that's already on the public markets.

Of course what does that mean you get? A bajillion scams which is what we've seen an insane amount of (most of which have been in the past year with ICO's).

Sorry but regular people shouldn't be investing in early stage ventures because few are qualified to be doing it.

> are you saying Bitcoin's a bad investment? Or just that it will never be widly used for payments?

Yes

> Either way, you're arguing against history

Tell that to anyone from one of history's numerous bubbles.

> using the same logic you could've used when bitcoin was $10

False. Bitcoin has a hard value which it's intrinsic value. That puts an underpinned value on Bitcoin which it can't drop below. That's significantly above $10 based on online blackmarket gambling alone.
Grats, have a good one mate. 
Yeah, I think we were just talking past each other.

There are a lot of mechanisms... and I certainly don't know all of them.

For example, if the value of BTC were to drop substantially and stay low for a long time then I think we'd see bubbles that are more similar to what we saw in 2013.

Another example: if we saw extreme hording of new BTC being isolated into fewer and fewer wallets, then we may also see pre 2013 volatility return.

Mostly I'm saying that past observations (pre 2013) volatility appears unlikely to return.
Ninja edit, again...
Close.

Higher values mean more stability for fluctuations of the same proportion, when comparing market prices that have different magnitudes.

Yes.
We seem to be saying pretty similar things.

I'm just more and more skeptical of direct comparisons.

I **was** debating you. Then you talked shit and walked away. 

Right the poison process uses the discrete binomial distribution to create the continuous gamma distribution. The exponential distribution is a special case of gamma with scalar parameter equal to 1. So a poisson process is memoryless.



You're definitely the type that refused to invest in bitcoin years ago over your skewed and short-sighted logic, and now you're in total denial and still calling it a bad investment.  Explain how I'm rich then  lol
Are you saying that I am ninja editting?

Lol if that'a the case, smh. I made a sentence more clear, or fixed a grammar mistake? I didn't change it after you responded, lmao. No one is going to read this, we are having a conversation.

Like literally, I made the above comment more clear. No context was changed. This sentence is another ninja edit. 
[deleted]
Yes, I think we do agree. my main point is $12k at this point
Fundamentals *are* better than they have been in a while- I agree with you. My point is that it doesn't matter because that's not how bubble-like assets work. A bubble is, by definition, an asset that is overvalued relative to its fundamentals.

Do you get what I'm saying?

And to be fair, there's really not much more you can do with BTC now. 

and for what it's worth, I do agree that blockchain tech is here to stay. I just don't know if BTC will long term

> Explain how I'm rich then

Cause you got lucky? Same as I did and the rest of us?

I'm an awesome trader and even I know last year's bubble was 100% luck.

You're extremely delusional if you think otherwise.

> You're definitely the type that refused to invest in bitcoin years ago over your skewed and short-sighted logic, and now you're in total denial and still calling it a bad investment

Tesla's an epic fucking mid term trade but it's a fucking awful investment.
No, I'm calling out my own ninja edits.
We're cool, I'm not antagonizing you. When I say ninja edit I'm just talking about my edits. I probably missed some of yours. I don't think I noticed any.
Magnitude and proportion are relevant. It's open source and JavaScript, you can see how it's calculated.
Yeah, similar shapes up until that higher low... which isn't confirmed yet.
My point is I keep seeing the same patterns over and over. Not only on the charts but in sentiment in discussions. If you felt greatly offended then I apologize. 
I've already been though 3 bubbles so I must have got lucky 3 times. But I guess that was the last one we'll ever see because.... oh wait 
[deleted]
> but muh fundamentals!!

You guys always say the exact same thing. Fundamentals don't mean shit when something is way over bought and is dealing with a correction. 

Maybe YOU weren't here early on when every single day bitcoin had good news but the price just kept going down. It was actually a well known joke. "Hey, that's some good news for bitcoin, I guess the price will tank now." I guess you weren't here for that. You must be new. 

[deleted]
Buddy, you were the one who said this " If you do it is because you actually werent here on 2k14."

Now all of a sudden it doesn't matter how long you've been in bitcoin. Ok, buddy. lmfao. 

Then you cry and cry about how people attack you personally and not your ideas. Then I debate your ideas and you attack me personally. You're a fucking joke. Eat shit, pal. 

You're way too stupid for crypto. 

There, am I doing this "debate" thing according to you correctly?

>  you a retard

LMFAO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[deleted]
Haha, "you mad". And I'm not short. And I was right about you being new. You're obviously having a panic attack so I'll go ahead and let you get the last word. I won't reply no matter what it is and you can feel like a champ. Bye bye, buddy.
