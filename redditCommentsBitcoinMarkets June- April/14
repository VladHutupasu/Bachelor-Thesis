[Daily Discussion] Sunday, May 20, 2018 -- TITLE
#New post: [\[Daily Discussion\] Monday, May 21, 2018 →](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ky3fx/daily_discussion_monday_may_21_2018/)
From the NY Post article about the excessive displays of wealth at the conference. 

>*”Decentral, a new venture by Ethereum co-founder Anthony Di Iorio, 43, rented out the 210-foot party yacht Cornucopia Majesty.  
The company is launching an app in July which, Di Iorio says, will be like his industry’s Netscape, and allow anyone to invest in cryptocurrencies.”*  



Some things never change. 

It’s all very reminiscent of the dot-com era’s IPO launch-party glitz; whose midnight yachts meandered down the Hudson ferrying a more or less equivalent passenger list.  

&nbsp; 

On deck, young startup founders and co founders, CEO’s, VP’s, CTO’s, and CFO’s barely out of university mingle with Hollywood B-listers and venture capitalists, token rap artists, and the type of beautifully exotic Eastern European girl whose only known job seems to be to attend these boat parties. 


The celebrity DJ is damn good. People are energized, high on cocaine or life. Of new frontiers and possibilities. 

&nbsp; 


Serious looking men, names invariably affixed with a Germanic-Jewish morpheme like *-stein* or *-gold-*, seem to preside over events. A bunch of corporate tax lawyers and private equity attorneys sit at tables conferring with big-money fund managers from Boston. They give off a vibe of a great white shark in a good mood. 

&nbsp; 

Everyone else is getting plastered. 

Some girl from Los Angeles loudly informs everyone on the boat that she is *definitely DRUNK* before throwing up over the side. 


Wait- wasn’t Snoop Dogg at this party as well? Mmm hard to say for sure. It‘s probably just your mind playing tricks.

&nbsp; 

A bunch of commotion causes you to turn around as the yacht’s passengers erupt in intoxicated cheer as another rousing speech ends with a guest appearance. Bruce Willis, for some reason, is now on the boat. Unclear if they made him hide in a closet the whole time or if he arrived via another boat or water taxi or something.  

The new company’s VP of marketing introduces Bruce to the attorneys and then the Czech girls. The financial attorney’s chrome two-tone aviator glasses seem to gradually sit more and more askew on his face as the night goes on.

Another marketing person informs you that they seem to have lost the keys to their new Viper. Obviously just some kind of social pretext for them to be able to delicately bring up the fact that they can now afford a Viper, while hopefully not coming across like such an asshole to other people. 


The yacht passes by another party boat heading northbound up the river. The passengers of both boats exchange loud pleasantries with one another as they pass within yelling distance.  
Several party goers wish the team aboard the SS designyourownxmastree dot com good luck with their IPO. 

The boat gets back at 1 in the AM. The market will crash 6 months later.

&nbsp; 

The parties celebrating the launch of companies who were on dawn’s bleeding edge would, from the vantage point of a few years on, seem like requiem parties instead. A cruel twist of fate. 

However the parties themselves didn’t change. 
Only people’s judgements, based on which side of Time’s great divide they sit. 


As more time passes we can lookback and see it for what it was: the birthing pains of a new era. 
Some will read of that ostentatious display of $$$ and think, “yep, like I suspected, market crash must be around the corner”  

Which of course, it could, who knows. I certainly don’t. 


*****  

However I do know one thing. Actually two. 

1. When humans start putting people with silly ideas on yachts together with pop stars, celebrities, and bankers, and shipping them around Manhattan in the middle of the night —watch out.  
It just seems to be mankind’s awkward way of expressing that some big change is on the horizon.  

2. and that the future will not be as you think. 
\(FYI I posted this over in r/bitcoin as well\)

Bitstamp is starting to ask some pretty spooky questions. I only recently filled in the KYC questionnaire.

I  have been a loyal customer of theirs for years. Suddenly the KYC  questionnaire pops up and I'm thinking "fine, I'll fill that in, too".  This is bearing in mind I am fully verified. They have my passport,  proof of address. You would think that would be enough.

Then  they suddenly ask where my bitcoin originate \(mining\), how I heard  about bitcoin, how much I am planning to withdraw, how I am planning to  use my bitcoin.

So I'm still thinking  "fine, I understand they are getting regulated up the wazoo and need to  cover their asses against money laundering". I tried my best to answer  accurately, but honestly, it was mostly guess work.

But that wasn't enough either. Now they are asking for proof of purchase of my mining equipment. Like, what?

So  I resisted a bit and asked them if they can at least promise me that it  will be enough information once I provide them an invoice for the miner  \(no idea if I will even find it\). I also asked them what the  consequences are, if I do not provide the information. They just ignored  that question in their next communication.

Along  with their messages, they keep saying "you are welcome to provide  additional \[insert ridiculously private and personal information about  wallets and transactions\] and any other information" without specifying  exactly what they need and how much of it. So I just simply won't know  when this process ends? That is nuts! Nobody has ever asked this much  information of me in such a bizarre manner.

ON TOP OF THAT they have now asked me to 'elaborate' on 3 extremely specific transactions I made. To specific addresses.

Like,  how on earth am I supposed to know what that was for? I interact with  the bitcoin ecosystem everywhere, like, some random number strings on  blockchain don't tell me why I made some random transaction and it's not  like I keep a spreadsheet with them in it.

This  is extremely worrying and I have moved all my funds out of  Bitstamp, while I ask them more questions. After this many years of loyalty it seems that I need to find a  new home for my Bitcoin trading. This is extremely disappointing.

Has this happened to anyone else?
These BGDs with no price action follow up no longer excites me.
I thought this weekend, maybe the market isn't actually strange or sideways, it's just that it's becoming more slower with out all the crazy bounces and pushes. I only traded like on 6h chart the last week and that was a very stressless and riskfree experience. Maybe bigger positions with lower leverage is the way to go. 

Have been keeping my 5x long from 8237 on swaps for like 5 days now
!short XBTUSD 8281.9 5X 50%

stops at 2%, pretty safe r/r: top of the falling wedge, bull div just played out, bearish fractal could still be in play. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/RjvgdNFq/
Woah, almost closed but this thing's got some juice it seems.

Edit: Closed it, have to take profits after getting absolutely owned earlier. 
When thinking further about “organic buying” vs short liquidation, I’m coming to the conclusion that the market really didn’t want to go lower. Short liquidation doesn’t happen without a reason, sellers got over-leveraged and went against the market’s wishes.

A cascade of liquidation surely amplified things. But a market is a market, and high leverage and “whales” are a part of it.

What I’m trying to say - it is what it is. When either side gets over leveraged against the market it corrects.

What brought us down to 7.9k was _partly_ the same thing but inverse.
The inverted H&S just confirmed: https://www.tradingview.com/x/5BAS9JVy/

The technical target for this formation is just north of 9k. We certainly won’t go straight there, but the market have apparently decided to give it a go, to the look of things.

RSI has to cool of a bit before the next leg up.

Edit: I should add that it would be good to have at least one 6H close above the neckline to really call it “confirmed”.
Wow

Roughly $30 million USD worth of short liquidations occurred in the last hour on bitmex.
gdax at 3482 24hr volume...i've never seen it this low, wow. What was it like last summer and before like...september?
Bittrex, Gemini, and Poloniex are all in triple digits for volume, and Kraken isn't too far from them.  My take is that for most people (specifically, non-BitMEX users), there is literally no reason to buy or sell right now unless you are choosing to gamble that you'll end up on the correct side of a Bart pattern.  
with volume this low, at such a pivotal technical point: Everyone has stops set. Very close. So expect a large move as others have stated.

Edit: It's moments like these where "not that big" players can place a large market order and decide the direction for everyone else.
!long XBTUSD 8360 100&#37; 1x

Tight stops once again. Got a small portion set for a long term trade. Good to be back!
this market is weired

no volume \-\- bounce of 2.5k coins \- no volume.

I opened a small short at 8.5k
What's the point of a BGD without price action? 

Ok, thank you guys.
Got stopped out on my short earlier for a small loss at $8,425 

Probably should have opened a long but the low volume was giving me the Harlem shakes. Took a quick piss break at work and saw a 200$ BGD and was pretty fucking surprised.

On that note, I’ve now opened another short at $8,530 ( small ) and will DCA up to about $8590 where it would put us at the top of our ascending channel we have just recently formed 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/bu1WnlQq/

I expect a minor pullback to test the 8400 ish range which would be the support at the bottom of the channel. This is more of a scalp, I’ll take 50% profits around 8440 and let the rest ride at B.E stops.

You could also argue we have a rising wedge on the 1H 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/GbMmIvlD/

Which could break down and put us in the $8250-8300 range where we could potentially bounce off the resistance line from 10k that would turn support. I’ll take some profits there. 

I’ll bail on my short over 8675 ish to call it safe 
My favorite indicator the 9,26 moving average cross is forming to the upside  https://www.tradingview.com/x/LbP8oEEY

With RSI in the middle and a potential bull flag also formning, this could be the setup for the next leg up within 24h. What  I not like is the low volume here, but as I wrote earlier today, this in one way makes the trading less stressful and you can buy at your own pace
r/bitcoinmarkets in february:

>price touched 6k, we're definitely going down to 4k;

April:

>price is at 7k, this is definitely a long term bear market;

Last week:

>price fell all the way down to 8k, this bear market is brutal;

We need more memes about people not zooming out.
Hard to believe volume is *even lower* than yesterday. What’s going on? Just not enough interest?
Stopped on that BGD. Glad I moved them down a bit after /u/citral23 forced me to re-evaluate. Still took some insane slippage on futures (about $30). Sup @ the 8680 wick. 

!short XBTM18 close 8498
Layering in more short entries around here.  Potential for 1 more day of up, but because of the shooting star about to close on the 6 hour I am anticipating a few days of down and some sideways action.  This would carve out a well defined higher low.  Targeting 8200-8300 for short closure and potentially opening a low leverage long.  The higher low will hopefully set us up for a run at a higher high, and a crack at 8900.  Im trading the 1d and 12 hour charts.

EDIT: grammar
Longest January ever
Here's what I'm seeing: 

Healthy consolidation going on right now. RSI needs to cool a bit on the 1H chart, but things continue to look bullish in the short term. Sitting comfortably in position since 7950 as none of the support levels have been challenged significantly during our move up. I'm watching the 4H chart to see where our higher low is set and will move my stops up when it does.

Current resistance: 8600
Current support: 8297 (1H), 8173 (4H)

Oh well, I finally covered the rest of my short for a very small profit.  This just won't die, and if you are having to fight in a position for too long, then best to GTFO.
Closed 30&#37; of my long here at $8,550. Stop loss at breakeven. Next target $8,750.
I love how when we were around 8200, the same action of BTC got 2 interpretations. The bears said thats BTC is hitting support in order to break it, bulls said its hitting support and bouncing off successfully, people will be people.
We are still in no man's land regarding the chart, we should test and break 8800 to confirm some sort of uptrend, otherwise its crypto purgatory until the makret decides what to do again
I may never learn, but re-opened short on swaps at 8510. Rising wedge seems to be breaking down. Setting stops damn near break even. Mostly a scalp play here, but I think we should retest 8450 at least. Will move stops there if we break it. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/oWsxqmpK/
Closed my short at $8,340 for a small loss. 

Switched to a long at the same price point. 

The resistance line from $10k broke. The market hasn't reacted much so far, but it happened. 
There's so much 'hidden' hate and jealousy here sometimes. I hope one day one BTC is worth a million. We'll all be rich by then. All the 'bears get REKT' stuff. Fucking stupid. The only reason why anyone here takes a bearish position is to accumulate more BTC, not because they want BTC to fail or go to 3000 or 100. I doubt there's many people on this forum that genuinely think BTC is a scam and put money in it. 

Hope everyone is doing well. Be careful for the bulltrap. It's a repeat of 18-24 march. Even the dates align lol.
You know you're overleveraged when you have nightmares about losing your stack. Currently underwater on my short, opened a hedge long for half my short value earlier (last night? I've lost track of time) at 8270 just in case. I should probably switch to scalping if I'm going to be trading anything more than 10x. lesson learned, but perhaps too late.
Haven't done anything since I bought real btc at 8150 a few days ago, still think 8200 is the new psychological bottom. It's also exactly 50% between 9900 and 6800.

The big question is, what to watch for next? Fundamental interest seems to be down all across the board 
Cool jump, now lets see it hold for the day then I'll buy!

There's still room to go up.
"Incumbent institutions control far less & are far more fragile than most perceive. In an age of infinite leverage, it's illusion.

They have no advantage in tools, they have no advantage in technology, they have no advantage in anything other than broken and swiftly depleting trust that they are to be trusted."
Bulls'd better break out here. Or back into the channel:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/KOfLPfdI/
Feels right to have closed 70&#37; of my long, I think I stick to it.

If we go down from here, we got rejected again from the upper line of this wedge: [**https://imgur.com/a/Vncf7Un**](https://imgur.com/a/Vncf7Un)

guess we are a bit too focused on these breakouts by a few dollars, we need to break out with a 100 or 150 USD candle to call it a break out
I'm still holding my short. Last night I decided to move stops higher and let it ride. Everyone sees it, but this volume is ridiculously bad. It feels like BTC needs a respirator right now and I'm not sure how that's bullish. We broke through the downtrend line from our current drop, but petered out almost right away. 

I'm tired of flipping positions, and I'm happy with my current short entry. Stops are high enough that a legit BGD will stop me without too much pain, but this impotent bot pumpage shouldn't catch me. 

GDAX volume dropping under 3500. L O friggin L. 
I'm not sure how most of you have the falling wedge drawn (quite a few different ways to draw it) but I have it like this: https://www.tradingview.com/x/KxtG2c04/

Like many of you said there is this iH&S at play but the volume profile is not ideal. There needs to be an expansion in volume on the advance from the low of the right shoulder, which we are not really seeing here.

Zoomed-in: https://www.tradingview.com/x/xU8ZCys0/

The way I draw it, we tested the resistance of the falling wedge and are making a bull flag which will meet the support line from the low at 7950. But even if the bull flag breaks up, there is still this important resistance zone between 8400 and 8450. 

I'm out for now, setting alarms and waiting, which I guess is what a lot of people are doing right now. 

EDIT:wrong link
The way I see it, we're still just coiling.

https://imgur.com/a/2pqk8TP

If we can close today above the 50-day moving average, I think we're going back up to test the upper trend at 9k.

What way will the trend break though, before those lines eventually collide on June 6th, or July 10th at latest? I don't know, but if we break up from here, I see a potential cup forming (with now being just past the middle) with peak around september, which would mean re-test of all-time highs around the end of this year.
Gentlemen, my chart trendlines are now all broken for both ETH and BTC.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/OgeXSPXG/

That said, prior to noticing that downward channel, I had a different estimate, and I expected a nice bump up (which we still haven't really seen):

https://www.tradingview.com/x/hjazhnBn/

So I'm still all in on buying at a ~6.9k bottom that hasn't come yet. 

PS: The volume stinks.
Just a reminder that the Wyckoff distribution chart appears to still apply here http://d.stockcharts.com/school/data/media/chart_school/market_analysis/wyckoff3/wyckoffdistribution1.png. If we break past resistance at $9k, I’ll change my tune. However, a bounce from $7900 was not surprising. I’m slowly scaling out of longs here, though another low volume pump from here may still be in the books. I see a possible upside of about $8800.

Edit: For those tracking it, that would put us at the second low volume bounce to re-test support-turned-resistance in phase D of the model.)
There is NO fucking volume. Its driving me absolutely crazy right now and I can't deal with this anymore lol. I need to blow off some steam I guess. It is seriously crazy.. nobody dares to make a bet right now? NOBODY is buying or selling? This is a god damn stalemate folks.. Please someone dump or buy a billion eth please i dont even care which one of those anymore, as long as this thing starts moving again.. I need to make a decision here.
Could anyone explain how BTC futures (settled in cash) could be used to control volatility in BTC price?  Do you think the volume is large enough to do that?  I'm wondering if futures would suppress 10-20% jumps in price in a day, for example.  I'd think there are just too few BTC around in too few hands to make any attempt at price suppression work.
One question to all professionals among you. I sometimes see tweets like this posted. I don't know what they mean.

In this case, I suspect someone was forced to buy Bitcoin for $8 million at $8421, because his short position got liquidated.

But I'm not sure.

https://twitter.com/BitmexRekt/status/998232926230892545

Edit: Thanks everyone. *Insightful!*
What does everyone have as a target for this move? I'm thinking of stepping out of my long at 8800.
I'd like to thank bitcoin for lifting her dress but I was hoping for more than just an ankle tbh.
so just like always this market confused everyone and even the best got it wrong , classic BTC
Closed my long at around $8550 for a smallish gain. 

RSI is overbought on the 1h and 2h. Should at least see a small pullback.  
why do I watch this? it is such a waste of time tbh!
I know some people on here are shorting eth/btc ratio. The charts do show some signs of weakness. But it just refuses to break down. Every break being bought up. Just broke out of a pennant on 30m chart. Reminds me of btc strength before futures announcement. 

Be careful out there guys. Don’t fight the trend, been burnt a few times doing that.

If volume returns, this could run to 0.1 very quickly
I'm not the only one seeing a blatant potential H&S am I? Like...no squinting required. 
i thinking this is the slow train back to breaking 10k.  Disbelief stage for anybody thinking its going below 8k.  Ive been wrong and right many times
another day, another dollar 
I'm noticing many indicators are closing in on many time frames. I feel a big move is imminent.

Edit: referring more to volume should pick up. 

Volatility continues to fall below median levels for all big crypto names. While ethereum volatility is starting to head upwards.

Holding my long from 250
Short-term outlook:

If 8.2k holds for another couple of hours, the R/R of a long would seem pretty good with a potential bull div on the 1h chart:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/sbmgAhMv/

But as everyone is saying, there isn’t much volume backing and moves here, so the market is pretty fragile is that sense.

Longer-term outlook:

Assuming for a moment that 8.2k breaks down, we’re bound to test 7.8k as many here would agree. The sooner we test and confirm support there, the better, because with the 6-12h Ichimoku cloud twists the resistance towards 10k is looking weak:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/iqlU3Opx/

If 7.8k holds and we bounce with some decent volume and break 10k shortly thereafter, then that’s a confirmation of the Cup & Handle on the daily:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/36segenr/

6.9k remains the target if 7.8k falls, based on the support lines from previous lows.

Edit: LOL, yes those charts are a couple of hours old. I fell asleep in between haha.
I had closed my shorts from the $9k range in anticipation for *this*? This is supposed to be a significant breakout, no follow through whatsoever. Now where am I supposed to reopen them?
[removed]
A pump on little-to-no volume is still short-term bearish in my book. I don't think we are out of the 7.4-7.8k. range yet. I believe we will see a selloff to sub 8k this week, then a strong pump up, blowing through the 8k range. 


TLDR:


Now (8.5) --> 7.4-7.8 --> 9k+ Within 7-10 days
Does it appear to anyone else that we pump over weekends?

https://www.tradingview.com/x/BGWidGKO/


I think the best bet here is a short with 8650 as a stop loss. 

You risk 4% of your stack in exchange for a 15-20% move down. 
She's as stable as a Swiss bond Cap'n! 
Such a tease. My brain is hyped right now because its expecting a dopamine rush from a BGD. This is free drugs.
Do I see an inverse head&shoulders forming here?
Yesterday closed my long at 8250

Opened a new one now at 8239 because btc has formed an inverted head and shoulders and the reword could be much greater than the risk if you have tight stops 

The reason I closed my long yesterday was because we broke down the support (former resistance) and it at some point it didn’t seem like a fake out, and more importantly, I wanted to sleep.

Have some good hopes for the long position, and the rsi, the stoch, b bands don’t look that bad, but don’t look like like the best spot to go long either. 
!short xbteur close 7060

!long xbtusd add 8320 75%

Closed my alternative short and added the rest of my fiat to my existing long as well. Don’t feel particularly excited about it. Low volume during this push makes it feel very fragile.

But we did indeed break the 10k trend line, and I don’t consider the 8.2-8.3 area a “no trade” zone that some people have said. The area around 8.2-8.3 a significant enough order block sitting just above the 1D kijun and a high profile node:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/FHCloCWi/

But again, the market feels very fragile and I’ll probably end up baby-sitting this position a bit.

No stop-loss for now.
Had family stuff again today so I couldn't check in.  My ["fuck it" short](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8kiwgl/daily_discussion_saturday_may_19_2018/dz8mw5p/) got stopped out at "break even".  This time it cost a coke, though the slippage and fees I tried to account for should have gained me a double cheeseburger to get yesterday's back.

I wish I took profits on the short, anywhere, but it was really setup for being end to end on the falling wedge, with possible breakdown, so in the case the price went sideways and down, I didn't want to let it go early or reduce it.

As I said yesterday I was interested to long if I got stopped and it if also crossed the resistance of the wedge we were at.  Yesterday credit card TA on the phone screen failed me, and I had wished I looked in here first.  So sure enough after looking in here, I see it's happening, and see chewy say something about a bull flag.  Look at the chart and it checks out, seemed to be poised, and I rationalized to myself that with a bullflag there I had potential to see a legit pop,  so longed in at 8320 (spot).  Got out at 8520, for all the reasons already listed here, and because I need to lock profits to survive more chop. 

I'll probably jump back into a long if RSI cools off, wherever that is.  If we don't break through the bottom of the new [ascending wedge](https://imgur.com/mUOQOxg), that looks like a nice place to get back in.   But I'd also get back in after some sideways action, and try not to let the previous sell point at 8520 affect that decision.

I was actually pissed off at the green candle though, and it was a meh trade, because my position size was started with half of what I've been starting with on all the other short lived trades I made in this chop.  I had to do a little position because I didn't have time to consider the RR well, where I'd want to bail out, let alone set a safety stop loss.  I hoped I could check in later to add 2~4x to it if it looked right, but didn't find the time until it already popped.  It would have been able to more than cover the worse 5% loss I mentioned yesterday. (at least I was well prepared for the potential loss though, it was small enough that I would not cry in a BRD, and would have other options of holding on or dca-ing.  Or closing for a real small loss if the price looked anemic but had not dropped yet.)

Thing is I got notified of the stop at a picnic, took a slap on the wrist from my wife about it.  Been trying to spend less time on this, at least when it's interfering with time with others.   So that's why I couldn't get setup the way I wanted to. And sorry for the shitty chart I shared, no time to make a clean one for you, you get the messy main one with all the trendlines on it.

Anyway back to trading, have a sept long still that was built with dca from 8300 and down, with a ca of 8100 (spot prices).  It still has orders waiting below 8k.  But if the price goes down to 8400, I'll take profits on this, and maybe reset some of the dca ladder that previously filled.  If 8400 becomes the floor convincingly, I might buy the whole position back.

The sept long has just been chilling since we hit local bottom, while I've been chopping on June.  Should have just let it sit as that, could have had a relaxing week not trying to chase the next big one.  (the chasing does pay off though, well it can)
Double reverse head and shoulders on the 1d and 12h

Warning wall of text and rant incoming:

If it weren't for upbit fud, we would not have had such a dramatic dump. I predicted BTC movement as per my own sentimental analysis, the pre-consensus dip, consensus rally and post consensus dip and recovery. Upbit turned the whole event into a mini crash. I think we will see more recovery at the coming week and maybe another go at 10k soon and maybe not, but overall sentiment is positive, let me elaborate.


What you guys don't see in your charts is market sentiment. And you can't find that sentiment in reddit or your neighborhood. Crypro is not a first world thing anymore. When I see Iranians bought 2.5 billion worth of cryptocurrency, with other third world countries and those with a failing economy following, that is the sentimental I know that must be followed.

First worlders may have many other investment option, and not in the danger of their currency devaluating. You never had to deal with everything becoming 50 percent more expensive withing few months. You don't have a gold market small enough that the government can crash by dumping cheap gold.  Crypto is the saving grace in these conditions and I have more and more people asking me about them.


What I'm saying here is that crypto is slowly returning to its roots, not to make rich guys richer, but preventing poor guys to become poorer and redistribute wealth through a whole new economic system. Maybe the impact of one third world country is not significant, but combined they have more than enough push, especially when crypto price falls, that's when it's deemed "cheap" here and a good entry. And you don't see them market buying 1000 BTC to protect their long or selling to short the market to make extra bucks. We buy it to protect our hard earned capital from rapid depreciation and corruption of governments. And to be able to actually use them when needed, case point below:

My brother is a us citizen and my sister is a Dutch citizen. Both still have projects in Iran and they are now using crypto to transfer their payments outside the country. They liked it so much that they are telling their friends. Imagine millions of others increasingly warming up to the utility. These little things here and there tend to have a cumulative effect, over time it will have an avalanche effect.

December we saw a craziness that crypto went ahead of its infrastructure, but now it's backing down and becoming more true to what it was intended to do. Scaling according what it can do and used for. True we have scams, shitcoins and manipulation, but as the general population of the WORLD, not just first world countries, are becoming more aware, this will start in earnest.

So take a moment to seat back and think about this, the next time you're fighting your bear and bull squabbles, declaring crypto is dead, shorting the market to its bare ass or trolling as Buttcoinist in disguise. Bitcoin has never been stronger fundementally imo and from here it will get stronger. It does not need to break ATH anytime soon, but there is little reason for it to crash either.
Every one of the last five BGDs have retraced from 50% to 100% of their peak.  So betting this one does the exact same thing.
This is seriously starting to look like a "sell in may and go away" market. I'm long right now since 8k but I think I will short in a couple of days, put a stop loss and move on. 

I think we will continue trending down for a few months, basically until institutional investors have the OK from the govs with regulations.

Meanwhile institutionals are feeling up their bags  OTC but still ask for big discounts so idk how much OTC deals are actually made, lots of buyers ( at least claim to be serious buyers), not many otc sellers. Makes sense, the potential big OTC sellers are geeks that got in early and they probably don't want to go through the whole KYC etc required for most otc deals

Some hopium for Bears: [https://imgur.com/a/zkOhLOa](https://imgur.com/a/zkOhLOa)
You do you, but I'm callin' a bigger green candle than the last one fairly soon.  Short at your own risk (but when isn't that true?).

AND all that being said, I'm still not budging on my buy at $7.5K... not yet.  I find it hard to believe that this last bearwhale was that weak.  I think he's gonna dump on us pretty soon.  Short term, though, another BGD.
Currently have our resistance at top of wedge around  $8,330 ish

https://www.tradingview.com/x/dYr5GagI/

Looks like we are back in our baby ascending channel too.

I’m still short from the 8200’s and holding. Thinking of putting my stops just over 8400 Incase of a classic insane Kraken Wick. Does that seem like a reasonable place to put them? Have profit taking sets at 8121, 8030, and 7916 ( for now ) 
sold 50&#37; of my long from 7960 at 8309, just try to lower my entry as I assume we need to get to 8.15\-8.2k again before we reverse \(iH&S right shoulder\)

Edit: another 20&#37; at 8340
I got bored so am just screwing around with the charts.

Here's some apophenic hopium for the desperate.

Similar fractals: https://www.tradingview.com/x/jXWPR00R/

Based on nothing but speculation, could see a pump in 4-6 hours. 


Bitcoin broke out of the falling wedge. 

Unfortunately it is Sunday and we have left the pattern with low volume. 

If we don't see some increased volume with this move come Monday I will be taking some profits early. 

Looking at 8800 for taking profits and raising stop loss as we had previous resistance there and it is the target of the IHS on the hourly.

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/qx4qvdKY-Bitcoin-Bullish-signs-and-why-we-won-t-see-5k-before-13k/


If I look at the charts and indicators I'm leaning bullish. The only thing I'm worried about is that on this low volume the last few days 2-3k longs have opened. A breakdown here would trigger quite some stops I imagine.
feels like everyone is expecting up, but volume is piss poor and we have half a dozen strong resistances above and a shitton of longs. So just like 9.9k and 11.7k then   
on a positive note the weekly macd is going to flip green soon if we keep going sideways and historically we've always pumped hard when it flips
"Blockchains empowers better institutions, not better people"

Consensus 2018 signalling-fest made this blatantly apparent.
fuck it, going long
[removed]
I don't know why; I'm getting the strange feeling a unusually large BGD is moments away 
so, when does tradingview add a USDT printed vs volume/% change indicator ? :D
Posting possible scenario chart for falling wedge. In case of breakdown, [target price sits at $7,050](https://imgur.com/a/LFFGMfN) (based on height of wedge at base). 
This weekends' daily candles seem eerily similar to last weeks' to me. 

I dont know if it actually means anything but if we dont set a higher high compared to that one until the daily candle closes my gut says we will go down to 7.8-8k again during the week.
Today I think is going to determine if we’re screwed for the long term. Still going for the long haul, but it really sucks the situation we’re in at the moment. My reason is Sunday usually has low volume and hard price drops (just my observation) which gives shorts the advantage.
Can someone please describe what a long and a short is, thank you.
News?  Seems like an extra strong breakout.  I shorted some at $8540, but doesn't seem to be slowing down.

There were some huge short liquidations on BitMex that pushed it higher.
I have the feeling that we are pushing the border of the downtrend further and further to the right. 

At some point the market should consider it to be broken and act accordingly... no?
Corn is getting bogged tomorrow

Same daily setup... fractal on the hourly and hidden bear div 

Hedging and pray for higher low 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/E8LVS1rD/

Looking at 8000-8100 for adds to long. Expect more panic and calls for 2k tomorrow. 
Hmmm, considering re-evaluating my previous stance regarding a possible imminent breakout and attempt to reach outer space. This pump has been rather disappointing. In fact, I wouldn't even consider it to have been a pump, but merely a miserable attempt to break bears from their path of conviction and instil false (h)opium into desperate bulls. Contemplating considering closing my leveraged long  and opening a leveraged (20x) short. That is, if we don't break 9k within the next 24 hours or if we fall below $8.2k on high volume within the next 12 hours. This doesn't look too good for bulls.
How does he do it! :p https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8kae50/daily_discussion_friday_may_18_2018/dz6yf96


I've become more comfortable holding BTC + ETH than USD in a chequing account.

I avoid institutional IOUs. I spend direct from crypto. I transfer via crypto. I get paid in crypto.

And it all works.

Something tells me financial liberty will be a one way function for most.
Torn whether to try to scalp a little short here - seems there's plenty of room on the 4h and daily RSI still to move up.
Oh well I took a small loss on my short.  Someone wants this higher and with the $250,000,000 of new Tether out there, I'm not going to fight it.
might yolo long here, I'm not a true believer in fractals, but this reminds me of the formation from the drop to 6k in Feb, i.e. if iH&S fails, still got a potential cup & handle on low volume.
Somehow the universe fucked me. I cancelled my trip to Paris, because I thought the price would drop and would rather invest that money in cheap bitcoin. Anyway still going forward with it
\#parentsbuyingthedip
Volumes are probably very low because of bitfinex new kyc/aml requests.

Even whalepool admins are pissed off, calling the new Bitfinex CCO a war criminal.

See screenshot.

https://i.redd.it/vfvi7svm0zy01.png

If you take out the volume of the big green dildos which is just 1 trader probably, volumes are lowest in a long time.
Eth could break out the ascending triangle, rejected for the third time. Anyonye thinking that if ETH breaks the resist BTC could go up? I really don't know what is the strongest resist for BTC now, 8450?
Tether power !

I closed my short for 0.25% loss...still a good chance it will drop but I cut my losers quickly in all cases now...can always reshort.

Does anyone want to try a bot test to see if this sub is being watched.

Like everyone posting or similar a single sided position like : short XBTUSD 3 million x5 leverage in a thread. Or has this been tried before?

My way of thinking, if someone was out to mess with traders they'd bet on the opposite side.

And just as I posted that...
question: considering the 250 million USDT print on 18th, will this be a temporary pump followed by a down turn or will the print sustain this upward momentum?
Yay we’re crashing again and still can’t break even with the money I gained 🤦🏼‍♂️
!short xbteur 7020 3x 25%

!long xbtusd 8230 3x 25%

LOL, let’s see how this goes. Small positions and tight stops around 2% on each, just to try this technique.

Margin fees will be a bit expensive on Kraken, and Bitcoin will probably find a way to stop me on both. But the next couple of hours will be interesting.

Edit: I should add, part of the reason I’m doing this is because I (as many others) anticipate a decent move soon. And Kraken hasn’t been at all reliable to provide sufficient margin recently. So I wanted to make sure I got a decent position in, that I can add to later.
seriously you bunch of ..... -5 points for asking a question about Tether and how it affects the market?????

what's wrong with you people
so a little look at the wall watch on bfx.

there is literally nothing all the way down from here

the biggest $100 range wall is just a measly 696BTC at $7,800 
[removed]
One reason for the low volume might be that this weekend is "Pentecost". 

This means monday is a holiday in large parts of Europe, and the weather is nice. 

So, people prefer to enjoy the long weekend outside with their families instead of trading...

It's like 99 all over again. May I add: Technology is only as good as the intelligent \(and moral\) behaviour of people and the times using it. Look at the internet. It promised freedom of information but gave us Facebook, Palentir and MSM censorship. It gave us instant contact and turned that into Porn, Tinder, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram and phaedos hunting for minors. Journalism have turned into sheer propaganda, a long line of 99&#37; lies. 

There's a long way from idealism, to how people use a technology when it's thrown out on the street. Many seem to forget that. Cryptocurrencies? Never before have pyramid scheemers in alts been so legit. Though our whole culture is based on steeling n scamming, so it all fits well.

I laughed way to hard at desingyourownxmastree dot com. Great write up!
I'm surprised the Reddit censors didn't delete this comment. They usually don't like to be named.
yes, happend to me as well. i sold in january some ether and they didnt send me my money. they asked me where the ether come from and i told them that i participated in the ICO. i had to sign a message with my genesis wallet. all very strange. the problem is that bitstamp doesnt have clear limits. they can ask me whatever they want for different limit levels (like kraken) but after approving a limit level they should guarantee that i can trade without any problem or blocking any funds.


> Then they suddenly ask where my bitcoin originate (mining), how I heard about bitcoin, how much I am planning to withdraw, how I am planning to use my bitcoin.

Thanks for the heads up. Questioning where your bitcoin originate from is understandable considering AML. With regards to the other questions I'd politely tell them to fuck off, that's none of their business.

Maybe you were singled out due to depositing "tainted" coins that you received from some shady party with very few hops in between? Bitstamp asking about specific transactions point into this direction.
My Bitstamp account was simply terminated without prior notice, shortly after I filled that kyc page they added to website. 
[deleted]
i first heard about the mining invoice thing years ago so it's not new. 


This is what moved me away from Bitstamp, the huge questionnaire form they send you makes you feel like a criminal when you've done nothing wrong. 

There are better exchanges, anyway. 
I had this in January with HitBTC. With BFX reporting tax info now, I think we are about to see every exchange start behaving like this.
Doesn't have to be exciting. Look at March/April 2017. Lots of low volume sideways with the occasional BGD. This sort of slow, unexciting recovery is exactly what we need to kick off the next parabolic run. 
This one has more follow up than most of the recent bgd's this past few weeks, its only 15 minutes in though so well see.
!short XBTUSD close 8370.5

not liking this
To comment on you fractal, I was looking at it yesterday, but I was looking at 8/9 being scooted up one, making our 7900 bottom number 9, and now we're moving to 10. Doesn't mean there isn't more downside in the cards, but would equate to a bump to 8600-ish
Good entry, I doubt well be able to break out given the volume. 
Nice job man. 
Wasn’t this move fueled by short liquidation’s? 

The volume profile doesn’t really match a H&S. 
ain't confirmed if the candle hasn't closed yet. Wait 2-3 hours.
>RSI has to cool of a bit before the next leg up.

This is how it could play out, 2 potential wedges [https://imgur.com/a/vPhQYA3](https://imgur.com/a/vPhQYA3)

the res line had some importance before. 
I believe it. I was watching in real time and some big numbers up there in red.
This is plenty of liquidated money.
[https://twitter.com/bitmexrekt?lang=en](https://twitter.com/bitmexrekt?lang=en)
Isn’t it simple? Those who bought when the volume was at it’s highest are now holding for a better time. Those who didn’t buy when the volume was high because they were nervous about what they were getting into aren’t buying now because they think they made the right choice in not buying when they first thought about it(because of the drop)
yesterday we had the lowest volume day on Bitfinex since June 2017.

This is interesting: [https://i.redditmedia.com/jGPLj6A6\-I2fDszALQ1qHtQzrpkU8\_FKKNgevzHukSE.png?s=13ef067373ba54f0f86c2f9fd3db6222](https://i.redditmedia.com/jGPLj6A6-I2fDszALQ1qHtQzrpkU8_FKKNgevzHukSE.png?s=13ef067373ba54f0f86c2f9fd3db6222)

it can mean all weak hands already sold and Bitcoin in the hands of the big hodlers that have the power to pump the price as shitor it can mean nobody is interested in this shit anymore and we drop so hard. 
Seems like market is near max-indecision. Everytime I see the GDAX 24 hr I have the song "how low can you go" playing in my head. 

I'll give up on GDAX when it gets below 2500. Poor chaps invested ton of money in infrastructure and customer service and now nobody uses it anymore, haha.
Yeah. 24 hour volume on GDAX is only 3.3k, and that's the lowest I think I've seen this year. 
Even Bitmex volume is very low. 
Though I'm still inclined to a move to the upside, there's so much resistance at the moment I can't really see it happening. Though I don't see too much selling to the downside either its a really interesting area to go long for a longer time-frame.

I really think we can spend much more time here than most people expect, oscillating no more than $500
!short XBTUSD close 8360


If this is a fakeout I'm going to throw a chair through the window.
capitulation
Marking up the price quickly so you don't get the real good (8k) deal that the big money got for themselves, and force you to chase the price, panicking when it goes 3 or 5% against your position and take loss after loss. Zero sum game.

(It also discourages bagholders from selling)
here it comes? If 8600 breaks I call party mode
As usual, do the opposite of the sentiment here
. When the perma bears go long, sell 
In my opinion, sellers don’t want to sell here, and buyers get gobbled up every time they try to pump above 8400, so it’s a stalemate and the risk and reward for either buying or selling seems poor. Just my observation, could be wrong.

It’s not lack of interest in bitcoin per se, it’s too much uncertainty in the current range making it unclear whether buying or selling would be profitable.
Too many traders are getting kicked in the teeth. As soon as a direction is chosen you'll see a load of volume.
Takes time for the market to realize there's not much left to sell
every trader is waiting for the makers to decide
I've been chopped up by wicks about 5 times this week...I'm getting slapped around by fees and 1-2% sl's.  Sitting in cash to lick my wounds for a bit.

and its not just BTC

the alt:BTC ratio pairs have shit volume as well

I'm looking at polo, ETH had 658BTC volume, XRP ahd 200 BTC volue,, ZEC had 199BTC volume, BCH had 179BTC volume.

That's crazy low, that's about 5x less than the usual healthy numbers. 
Glad I could help. Now let's see if momentum builds up on 1D macd and if it slingshots like a 4 cylinder motorcycle engine reving up. I plan to add to my long on the next dip (3/4h rsi oversold is a very good indicator in uptrends for a place to add) but as posted earlier, for now and without evidence that new money flows in, I don't see this as anything else than a (fairly substantial imo) upswing based on heavily oversold conditions. But then we're also making higher lows and retraced 70% so it could be seen as good enough, we're in 2018 not 2014 after all.

Spot on with my own levels. Thinking the 1hr forms a higher low around 8350-8400 range.
Looks like BTC is gearing up for a $1000 move day.
Insert sexual joke here 
toit like a toiger.

Yeah, things have been pretty ridiculous lately. How did we pump to 8400 and subsequently violate 8200 yesterday?

Oh yeha... because horizontal resistance lines don’t count for shit anymore.

Oh, unless it’s 10k
my man
-fist bump-
So... about those stops :|
shorting these tops has been free money it seems...this is so boring I might start scalping. I'll get burned the first time I try to do it though watch 
Good luck. I'm new to this so I would like to ask, do many people open shorts even though they only predict a 60 dollar drop (your example of 8510-8450). 

I guess I have low capital so not worth it but maybe if you guys are bigger fish it's worth it. That's the general idea? Or you leveraged it 10x?
I am short too and not sure why you are so nervous about your position.  

And yes also thinking I will take some profits at around 8440 or 8450, but will probably drop even farther later on. 
I looking for a break of 8.5K, since that would give us a rally with a higher low and and higher high (first since the 10K rejection), which should indicate the bottom of the downtrend from 9.9K.
I'm hoping a US wake-up will pump price a bit
maybe you swap your positions a bit too often?
So how do you determine if the resistance line broke? Because we are back below the line now aren’t we?  The line hasn’t held in an absolute sense all the way from 10k and we have wicked above it at least one other time.  
Yes overall trend is down, but must respect that line break.  I am back to flat (with just hedge short) and really have no strong feeling which way this will go here.
Everyone wants money. You make money by buying low and selling high, or shorting high and buying it back low. They are effectively the same thing, just used when the market is going up or down. So the main disagreement people have is in which type of market we are in - bull or bear. Its unclear because depending on timeframe, it can look:

 2 days=bull

2 weeks=bear

1 month=bull

5 months=bear

1 year=bull

There is no team bear, or team bull.
I think there are some people just want to trade and accumulate more USD who don't care BTC succeeds or not.

If you want to talk about dates aligning, look at 19 May 2014 when the mid year run up started.
I'm just a noob here trying to find out more about the bitcoin CEO.  
Lol? Sound like a condescending dick to me.
>The only reason why anyone here takes a bearish position is to accumulate more BTC, not because they want BTC to fail or go to 3000 or 100.

I get what you're saying but there are, for sure, a few people here that want to see that happen.
"The only reason why anyone here takes a bearish position is to accumulate more BTC"

Thanks for speaking on behalf of everyone, I take bearish positions and have no intention of accumulating BTC, my only intentions are to accumulate USD.
That’s absolutely wrong. All I need to make money is some dude thinking he’s more clever than anyone else, thinks BTC is gonna go up and buys aggressively in exchange A while some other dude also thinks he’s more clever than anyone else and sells aggressively in exchange B. As a result it becomes possible to sell to first dude in exchange A and buy back simultaneously from second dude on exchange B and make money

TLDR people like you feed the pro traders who don’t give a fuck whether BTC is going up or down, but only care that there are many stubborn people with different opinions who keep coming back to the casino.
jealousy/negativity comes mostly from Bcashers, ETHMoonBois, and Butters usually disguised as troll concern.
At the risk of sounding like a mega-noob, why do people open hedge longs against their shorts instead of just scaling out of the short a little?
Yikes, hope you manage to get out relatively unscathed. 
The answer to that question is : patience. There's obviously not much more downside possible than 7.8 for now, while retesting 10k is likely on an upmove, so you have a good entry and r/r here provided you keep your stops far away from wicks. 

We are soiled by volatility but 1/2 weeks of sideways is nothing in the grand scheme of things
9900 + 6800 = 16700
16700 / 2 = 8350
Not gonna lie, the weekend volume is abysmal. Low liquidity/thin orderbook is not a reliable confirmation of breakout up or down. I am going to predict probabilistically that this is a retest to further confirm the downtrend.
I think it's pretty normal to see reduced volume and volatility on rounded bottoms as despaired coins are gobbled quietly. Momentum shifting around slowly, but will gain traction if it works out (look at that 1D Macd) Imo, put stops at breakeven, you're shorting a daily stoch rsi that went to 0 and points up here, mfi is at 20, it's lower than it was at 6K !

Bias : I'm still long low lev no sl unsqueezable, buy low sell high

https://www.tradingview.com/x/mo8bQZxm
Where are your stop losses, I am holding short from a couple of days ago from 8450, current stop loss is 8520
That's how I had mine drawn too!  The next resistance line I'm looking at is this: https://www.tradingview.com/x/qvI48Qdg/

It connects ATH to our first attempt at a 10k breach (and the 200 DMA).  Seems to have acted as resistance and support since.  Also keeping a close eye on the hefty MACD Coil.

EDIT: We're also currently battling the 50 DMA.
If you connect the two wicks on your first diagram we have an ascending triangle which should break down since we are in a bear trend.  So we have two competing formations.
> The way I see it, we're still just coiling.

The way I see it, we're all just seeing what we want to see.
PPS: https://www.tradingview.com/x/ex2rLS1I/

For anyone wondering about my daily chart, I paint green with a positive moving average, and red with a negative one, but I paint it multiple times with different types of moving averages (including macd, RMI, when values exceed bollenger bands, etc) using a high transparency value. This way I can see consensus on a half dozen moving average methods at a glance. I also paint a black bar when directional index values cross.

Its interesting to watch how BTC is firm in its downward commitment. ETH is flip flopping repeatedly, but still turning red despite the nice rise up the last few days. On the other hand, the top of my chart shows RSI divergence, and you can see it just flipped green on ETH.
They're waiting for you to go to sleep. Good luck making the right choice on your position. 
There's no selling volume. Buy volume will pick up as ppl realize what's going on.
The decision has already been made. We broke free of the downtrend...
Volume on OTC is crazy at the moment.  People are buying it off the exchanges just an FYI.
The tin foil theory is that big players manipulate the price to profit off futures, which they are allowed to trade. 

Also with futures it’s easier to short btc for those players. 
yes he was forced to buy 8 million bitmex contracts because his margin ran out, he lost something between $80000 and $8 million
They were short $8 million worth of XBT on bitmex. They were at high enough leverage (probably 25x or more) such that at $8421, the position had lost the entire value of their principle. The exchange closed the position (bought) to cover their stake and liquidated the holder of 100% of their position. 

So basically you're correct. 
Correct. 

It happens automatically once the price reaches a certain level (too high/too low for shorts/longs), which can have a cascading effect on price if many short/longs get liquidated onto the next ones.
Yes, it means their short got liquidated and their position was closed with a long. Their position cost was somewhere between 80k and 8million USD, most likely 80k at 100x leverage. 
If we form a bull flag and break out of it, it'll go up to $8,6k for now...
Target for the inverted H&S would be around 9k. But that’s just a technical target, Bitcoin will do whatever Bitcoin does... But it certainly looks like we want to test 9k in the next few days.
might be a good idea to wait for 9000 or so;

which is the target price from the inverted head and shoulders;  we will definitely have some battles on the way there but i wouldn't expect a significant drop before that, unless btc will be rejected with confidence from its important fib levels
Downtrend has been broken. We will go straight to $11.7k soon. Once broken, $13.3k will be tested. All of these targets will be broken and met. By mid July, we will have broken previous ATH. I expect us to be at $28k then. May will be the last time in the history of bitcoin that it will be sub $10k. Anyone shorting now or waiting on the sidelines is missing the point and will miss out bigly. This is the last chance to buy cheap coins, in a week, just one week, everyone who refused to pull the trigger and hit that big green BUY button furiously will hate himself. And they will keep waiting for a better opportunity because they missed out, and that opportunity will never come. 

Buy now folks, buy now or cry later.

Edit: There's a 7 minute wait period after each of my comments, probably to give everyone time to take it all in, so can't reply to everyone as fast as I would like. This edit is mainly directed at the people who are mean in their replies; you know who you are. And I believe what you have said is very **rude**.
Target is down.  I doubt it will follow through or at least retrace $150 or so before doing so.
time and patience, do you have it Chris?
actually, according to sloppy's poll, weren't most people bullish? Unless I'm missing something, looks like most people here got it right. 
Not sure what you are talking about.  Plenty of people just were long on that spike.  Just because you are confused doesn't mean everyone is.  But price action for the last 48 hrs has mostly been confusing to myself and many others.
Been long from 8050 because of the massive falling wedge and 4hr bullish divergence. Daily stoch rsi was oversold as well. The drop from 11.7k did the whole falling wedge thing too. Drops take breathers on the way down.
not true. plenty of people bet correctly. i went long at 7950 when the majority of people here (and slack) seemed to think we would test low 7ks or even the 6ks. 
Not true at all, seen dozens of mentions of iH&S etc 
There are no best in classic BTC. Its all guesses. Some make good guesses, whilst others make bad. Some are patient, whilst others are impatient. 
It's not a big enough move to tell, imo. Not much follow-through buying.
so pullback to something like 8400 before a move to 8700\+?
Came to say the same thing. I think we pullback to $8400 before the next leg up.
We should, but another well-timed $150+ pump would turn the weekly green and that's pretty close and tempting. Two hours to go.
Because it could happen *any second* now... ;-)
ETH/BTC loves to have a blow-off top. I also notice that it always seems to be the last alt during the alt-hype cycle to reach its top. I've also noticed that for the passed 3 years, shorting alts in the first half June have been a great play (usually when the summer cycle reaches its peak).

Shorting ETH/BTC is a bit dangerous though, because that bull is pretty serious honestly. Best to wait for a sure entry.
1 thing i have learned the hard way is to not mix alts with leverage...those markets are run by retail FOMO and they do not look at charts
What weakness are you seeing on the ratio? Trending up nicely, not over bought, not near any resistance levels. 
So you want to say that 9,900 to 7,900 drop and then recover to 8,300 is a bullish trend? Ok
Pretty textbook H&S on the 15m timeframe.  Not surprising though, time to scout out a higher low.
On what timeframe?
Yes I see it too on 15 min, although the head is just that spike up near 8600.
I'm thinking the chart says that is unlikely compared to $8K.  But it's just the chart.
Low volatility begets high volatility and vice versa
Ethereums measure ends on Dec 11th though, right before the hype run. I don't think it's accurate for right now. 
Assume euphemism and you’re referring to 250am
>bulltrap

you could have bought more.
Wonder what I'm reading sometimes, so you believe especially given the fragile and bearish nature of the market, we could drop to $7.8k causing probably mass panic, but then magically there would appear a surge of buyers which haven't existed yet who would push us up to $10k and beyond...
We wickeded above the downtrend line on nearly every exchange just to stall just slightly under it again..also confused here. Still staying in my short, will flip to a long if we break 8400 i think.
I agree that the volume is total anal-beads, but I think we might need to retest the top of the wedge as support before the real pump will happen. 

If we fall back inside it would be a good place to open a short as there's a decent chance for either a double-bottom or lower low. 

If we break 8400 I'd consider it a completion of the IH&S and we'll probably see more upside.

I just hope SOMETHING happens cause this is total shyte. 
it looks like one incoming, if not now then in the next 2 hours
What do you mean? GDAX went from 3700 btc to 4500 btc 24 hr volume during that pump... That's a LOT
There's also no bear volume, a pullback is due but I don't think it can even break 8170 before going back up to 8.8k+. 
Way overly precise on your prediction, but agreed that this isn't convincing of a trend reversal yet.

I did a facepalm after I read this..no joke...
I think the best bet here is a long with 8005 as a stop loss.

You risk 4% of your stack in exchange for a 15-20% move up.
No, you risk 4% of your stack in exchange for a possible move down that could be 2% or less, or more.

And 4% is too loose of a stop for me.
If you expect it too much it probably won’t happen. A few times lately we’ve been expecting a big move and a smallish move has occurred and we’ve ended up right back where we started.

need a high volume breakout from the bottom of the right shoulder, so possibly? but 3745 btc 24 hr gdax volume says the volume profile *may* not fit
Came here to post the same thing. I'm cautiously optimistic with a scaled in long at $8,330 that I've been building from the initial large drop. Held all the way down to $7,900 and believe that we will test $8,700. 

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/ly4WY7sr/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ly4WY7sr/)
Interesting the I H&S you’ve spotted. Where your entry? Bottom on the rights shoulder? 

Will be interesting to see if it passes the resistance, I will definitely hop on the on the train if we pass it, which would be even before the H&S completes.

What’s the target? 

Good luck!

> I'll probably jump back into a long if RSI cools off, wherever that is. If we don't break through the bottom of the new ascending wedge, that looks like a nice place to get back in. But I'd also get back in after some sideways action, and try not to let the previous sell point at 8520 affect that decision.

That's what I'm looking at as well. Let's see how low this retraces and if we finally get some volume. I think patience is key for next moves.


In a similar situation, left a position and would have to come in at a worse entry than the one I let go, exept I let it go for losses not gains which makes it even worse.

I think I need to wait 2 weeks to get over it.  I'm telling myself, "there will always be price action at any level".
How significant / reliable are these sorts of patterns usually? I seem to remember that the normal head and shoulders one is said to be one of the most reliable when it comes to trend reversal patterns... is that correct?

I agree witho you in some parts, but this

> Iranians bought 2.5 billion worth of cryptocurrency 

Is just the opposite of FUD. Nobody ever showed a source where this number comes from. I tried to figure it out, but it is just not there.
I have a friend US citizen who is doing a construction development in Brazil. He is planning to use bitcoin to transfer funds from USD to Real to avoid all the middlemen and all the chunks they take out of the money.
We are seeing more and more of these overly hopeful posts about "fundamentals"...basically saying how the market price is wrong for the price to be dropping and not to lose all hope.   Got to think this is is a bearish sign.

And Iranian gov't already banned cryptocurrency, so doubt it's going to grow much there.  It was recently banned in Zimbabwe too.  So much for it helping those who are "unbanked" or whose nations have rapid hyperinflation and poor currency.   Those in power will not allow this to happen.

Thanks for taking the time to share your thought and I'm sure will bring solace to some holders out there, but Bitcoin fundamentals have not looked this bad in two or three years, and probably won't get much better.
Well said!
> When I see Iranians bought 2.5 billion worth of cryptocurrency

What? Thats gonna be a hard no for me bro. 2.5 billion would not be missed in our very virgin market
the volume and bullish patterns(ascending triangle , people buying more and more closer and closer to the top) are good sentiment chart indicators.

but yeah, all fb groups i am in about crypto and so on is quite silent now
> What you guys don't see in your charts is market sentiment. When I see Iranians bought 2.5 billion worth of cryptocurrency, with other third world countries and those with a failing economy following, that is the sentimental I know that must be followed.

> First worlders may have many other investment option, and not in the danger of their currency devaluating. You never had to deal with everything becoming 50 percent more expensive withing few months. You don't have a gold market small enough that the government can crash by dumping cheap gold. Crypto is the saving grace in these conditions and I have more and more people asking me about them.

> What I'm saying here is that crypto is slowly returning to its roots, not to make rich guys richer, but preventing poor guys to become poorer and redistribute wealth through a whole new economic system. Maybe the impact of one third world country is not significant, but combined they have more than enough push, especially when crypto price falls, that's when it's deemed "cheap" here and a good entry. And you don't see them market buying 1000 BTC to protect their long or selling to short the market to make extra bucks. We buy it to protect our hard earned capital from rapid depreciation and corruption of governments. And to be able to actually use them when needed.

I salute you sir for this write up and information!

> My brother is a us citizen and my sister is a Dutch citizen. Both still have projects in Iran and they are now using crypto to transfer their payments outside the country. They liked it so much that they are telling their friends.

*I tell you my story.* On one of my trips, I traveled to a new continent, new country for the first time, landed at the airport, got out, I had no more than $80 in my pocket, nothing more but a bank account with no money in it. :)

Agreed, these little pumps don’t get the heart racing any more, they seem like a random blip amongst random noise, some up, others down.
baby steps.

there's no question that the downward trend has been broken. we're in a new cycle.

Bears don't need hopium in this market.
there is no volume. I can only imagine this is one hell of a bounce, but on lowest volume since April 2017, I’m calling bullshit.

Not shorting, just observing. But it’s not making me too confident 
I remember when $1000 seemed ridick. Then we hit $20,000.  So extrapolating, $400,000 is the next ridick level.  Figure four years, maybe less as things seem to accelerate in Bitcoin world.

So, you know, short, maybe get lucky and make 5 grand. Or buy and hold and get rich over time.  Your choice. *shrug*
I'm also short and phasing my stops all above re-entry into the ascending channel. 33% at 8360, 33% at 8425, 33% at 8525. But I should be woken up by an alarm before that point.  https://www.tradingview.com/x/CsG9psHA/
Monday (Pentecost) is a holiday in some parts of Europe. Don't forget that.
no, everyone is expecting down.
If volume is shit that also applies to a potential downwards movement (at least at current prices)

The low has been shit for a while, I can’t imagine it going lower, something will have to give to trigger an avalanche 
Agree with your observations, usually Sunday is a down day.  This doesn't bode well.
Simple version. 

 A long means you buy bitcoin on margin with the intent to give it back (sell or close) later at a higher price, pocketing the difference.

A short is you borrow a bitcoin on margin to sell with the intent of buying (close the position) it back later and returning it, pocketing the difference. 
Long: buying
Short: selling

Breakout of inverse H&S right on target.
Yeah I had 8375 as the breakout, but wow. Some big boys were caught short.
MGD (massive green dildo) due? 
"Down trend" = LMFAO!!! You guys crack me up.  I held for two years down like 70 percent for a lot of it.  THAT was a down trend.  This ain't doo doo, and, actually, it's an up trend if you're smart and bought the dips.  (Speaking of which, if $8K was the bottom of that last dumping tantrum, the bull case is extremely strong right now.)
I'm not seeing the bear div. Which would not be hidden, since it's an uptrend.

Don't go flip-floppin' on me now, I already went all in on a 100x long based on your previous post. :(
Always appreciate your insights. I know some people give you crap for flip flopping but you are consistently one of the best traders in the sub. Learned a lot from you, keep posting. 

Just went 50x short, I think we'll get rich here soon.
Your targets are really too low. 12k in the next 4H or bearish.
Probably the best reddit name I’ve seen. )
A good call is a good call. 
You'll jinx it ... :P
Idk where you live but I'm pretty comfortable using a Visa Debit card and have no need for crypto besides a fun risky investment or store of value. I wish I needed it, I wish I felt financially hamstrung and trapped by the current system, but I don't. People who peddle the crypto narrative like we all need it right now are doing more harm than good. Until we really do need it, we are honestly just circle jerking with an ideology.
Cool story bro... but what does this have to do with trading bitcoin?
Scalp is probably on the long side with the price at 8500.  Although this bounce could certainly go higher. I'm not betting on it though.
I think anyone shorting this should wait til $8650 is broken to take a loss

there's always pretty much been thin air between $8200 and $8600 
>  Someone wants this higher, I'm not going to fight it.

Good idea. 


The drop to 6k in Feb was pretty violent, nothing like that happening these days.
will yolo long back if we break 8.4k. short\-time RSIs quite overbought, so I dont think we could shoot directly to 8.5k, still much more likly we need to test the downside one more time at least into the 8.2ks... will see
[deleted]
Life is too short for decisions like that.
What do you mean? The price *is* cheap right now.

the bots are already confused enough
Admittedly I haven't traded on Kraken in a pretty long time so I don't know if this has changed, but they've never had problems with having enough BTC to fund margin shorts in the past, it's the EUR / USD needed for margin funding that is always in short supply. Unless things are very different now, you shouldn't need to worry too much about not being able to fill a short. 
downvoted this post for fun
I assume you are being downvoted because your post sounds like thinly veiled tether fud.

I think thats the same nonsense as Consensus and Chinese New Year. If people wanna trade and think they will make money they will trade on their grandmother's funeral I think.

But that maybe just me being a degenerate watching this shit when I should be learning for my anatomy exam.
No, just no

Just like why we had a dip at Easter right? Because people were pulling their money out to buy Easter eggs, same with buying presents at Christmas 
No the reason for the low volume is that it was the FA Cup final yesterday and people would have got drunk and plan to have a lie in and probably a fry up for breakfast rather than trading. 
Can I ask what are the moving averages you have used on those charts?
If only there were use cases. 
There is nothing wring with porn.
I have an inkling that he was at the Consensus observing the scene from a corner table!
That is absolutely right. I have now asked them how much I can still use their service with the existing information I have provided. Let's see if it's possible at all.
So they blocked your funds and you couldn't withdraw anything before signing the message?
Yup, agreed. That is what I figured as well. I am happy to play along to some degree, particularly knowing that KYC is a requirement for financially regulated places.
It's the additional, specific questions and the ham-handed way they are going about it that I strongly disagree with.
That is just scary. It feels as though their power to do this is disproportionate to the amount of hoops they make you jump through.
Like, my bank has my passport and address as well, but the likelihood of them just terminating my bank account feels reasonably low.
I do not feel as though I am getting anything in return for giving them these ridiculous amounts of information.
Why are they suddenly behaving like this?
I don't think they are in trouble. I think it's the opposite. They are so big and established that they don't give a flying fuck about one tiny customer like me, so they behave without courtesy.
That's quite interesting. I must have hit some kind of threshold. Or maybe they are becoming stricter, as I'm really not dealing with a ton of money here. Hmmmm. I wish they just told you this stuff.
It should also be noted that Bitstamp was sold recently, at least this is the rumor going around, so the new owners could be trying to legitimize and cut off any riffraff.

Or maybe they're trying to catch quasi\-criminals. Who knows.

It looks like the 1D MACD is going for a crossover too 

And the 1WK
Just took a little profit on the long and opened a small short myself.
I'm just sitting out for now. If we don't Bart back down I may start scaling in long. 8K held surprisingly well, and my biggest concern shorting was that we only breached it because of the MEX outage and the ensuing selloff in anticipation of a dump. That seems like it may have been the case. 
I guess the breakout of the pennant comes with the next major trend. In a bull case I can see us touching the upper weekly bband at 13.7k in the bull case we touch the lower weekly bband at 5.1k
I see the bands mentioned a lot but not much seems to happen?
Next week we will resume the upward trend, even in low volume BTC won't drop. Also, Happy Cake Day!
Yeah, I manually took profit (lol) to offset fees with a limit order just below 8500. Stopped market on this spike. For tuna sub losses. I was intending to scalp down to the 8450 range and flip long, but we only made about 50% of that move. I think I'll just take a few days off and let my bot do the heavy lifting.
edit: Contribution self-removed due to over-zealous moderation. 31 day ban for single use of a benign word with 10 upvotes of communities agreeance. Unlike the army of trolls who evade these bans I will not be contributing any further. Race to the bottom.
I don't usually scalp, but I happened to be sitting at my desk and it seemed like a tick down. I closed half of it when we got back to 8500. Other half is still open with a market stop. Other were limit, so it'll all wash roughly if it stops here. I don't generally like micro trades, and I'm remembering why. 
I don't know if many people open shorts to scalp about 0.7% but I do it sometimes.  If the price is likely to drop significantly, I will often short and if it goes farther down, just more profit.

And doesn't matter what you are leveraged.  Profit is profit. More money is more money.
I'd encourage you not to read too much into a week or two of flip flopping. 

This is what I do when the market is indecisive leading up to what I believe will be a significant move. 
Pretty sure he's has spoken about this on many occasions. Check his post history from yesterday.
Better than being stubborn and taking a huge loss.
My Bitfinex chart shows we are above the line at the moment.

Explain?
Yeah because they can buy more, cheap. I mean who doesn't want to see 3k BTC as a trader. It's a gift. 

Bla bla 'whales and instutional traders are übermensch that are better traders than you'. They aren't, not all of them. 
For me it takes the psychological pressure off having to decide to enter at a certain price point because I'm already in position - I find it easier to cut a loss than to buy in. But it's not necessarily a smart strategy ;)
Probably too late for that. All I can hope for, given my long is smaller than my short, is that if it breaks up, it better break up in a big way. Tired of these $100 moves.
I don't even have stops here, this was more a "I want some btc at this price" buy, which actually feels quite nice 
so you think this is a whopping 6% from the absolute bottom? 



/r/theydidthemath
Exactly fits good into the 150 range around it both ways 
On smaller time frames, it looks like it broke out, but my money would be on rejection due to the shitty volume and similarity to the $8880 double top-ish rejection 
You raise good points. Thanks for the info. I'll re-evaluate my position. 
Basically there, give or take a smidge. Converted as I'm on June futures. You have a better entry than I do, though 
Your charts are great, thank you for sharing them
We were already in an uptrend from $7950. And still in a downtrend from $20K.  Or still in an uptrend from $6K.   Or both.
of a* downtrend. We're at $8.5k man. 42.5% of ATH...
You cant say this without a source unless you want to look like like a fake shill account.
Where do you see the metric for this?
this is probably about right, also institutional money need all the normal market stuff to be more comfortable entering the space.  Futures are one step closer to having more tradable products like ETF's.  They could be somewhat manipulating the price, but i also think this bear market is kind of a coincidence as well.  As much as i hate this market now, its great to accumulate more and give more time for the infrastructure to mature.  
Couldn't have been $8mm or he would have been liquidated on a subsequent trip up here. It would have had to be 25x or more (4% under 8400 is down around 8k)

Curious, as I typically have more success playing alt coin ratios (with margin) than I do trading fiat pairs. Hmm.

$250.00. Just reminding people how far we have come since 2015. 
I used to have more than twice the amount I have now. Sold half to get into stocks March of 2016. Worst decision I have ever made.
You’re probably right. And I never stated that I firmly believe 7.8k would hold. I just laid out what the technicals at play would be if it _did_ hold.

As you can see at the end of my comment I think 6.9k is a very realistic target.
To say that we're below it you would need to have your first point of contact at 9990 and the second at 8470 where we wicked hard yesterday, disregarding all the other contact points that were made before.

there is always plenty of time to get out and reverse into a long 


you are both right, because this market is a martingale
no, because even though both scenarios we both lose 4%...my bet is using the long term trendline.

My scenario, you are shorting a local top at the resistance point. Selling high, hoping to buy low. 

Your scenario, you are going long right before a resistance point after a few pumps hoping for one more pump to make some profit. So you are proposing to buy high hoping for one more pump.

So I'd say either short here like I suggested, or wait for $8650 to go down before going long

it could be 2% or it could be 20%. Considering the lack of volume in this price range, when a move happens it'll be a big one. Either up or down
He should just keep adding until liquidation at 11k imo
How the mighty have fallen when people must desperately fantasize on the price reaching $8500.

>Where your entry? Bottom on the rights shoulder?

yep

The thing that concerns me though is that btc still didn't cross fib level 0.382 (looking at 8800 - 7934) and it might be acting as a resistance now? it was also perfectly rejected from 0.618 yesterday as well

And now we have an owner of 2 brand new bitcoins and he is going to tell all his buddies in the Iranian Association of Certified Public Accountants. 
I'm sure that your post about fundementals being at their worst in many years and bulls being in denial will bring some solace to the shorters and bears out there.
The thing is your news is not right. Iranians government banned banks from providing crypto related services, not persons or companies. You really can't ban crypto, when it's needed it will find a way. I just came from a Cardano meetup hosted by a stocks broking company and we had senior banks managers attending. Go figure.

And the cryptoverse is not limited to Bitcoin anymore, it's the gateway, the liquidity provider. Other cryptoes are taking their own share of the market. Price has nothing to do with fundementals, traders don't trade according to fundementals but crappy TA. That will bite them in the ass sooner or later.
Gdax 24hr volume at 4k btc and people are genuinely calling this 2% move up the absolute bottom 

surely it could continue up here but damn people are insanely overleveraged 

and yes I agree, there have been dozens of these "fundamentals have never been better" and "you just have to believe and you'll get rich" posts lately 
Tbh, I think there’s a correlation between “don’t give up!” posts like these and the beginning of a pump. Potentially psychological manipulation to influence the “on the fence” traders.
Once they get it out the coins are sold. So I doubt there was an injection of 2.5 billion that's still there.

Most of it was OTC and from miners. I have a theory that the recent rally to 10k was in part due to this purchase. With the nuclear deal going to shizzles, big shots in Iran may have looked to alternative solutions both to protect their capitals in case of a war and to circumvent upcoming sanctions. And they must have believed they got in cheap, if you get my drift.
Facebook is mostly used by US  i think? It's an echo chamber, everyone who wanted in crypto there already got in. My point is this is beyond first world now, while you're in bears, we're in the bulls. Cheaper crypto for us when it crashes. People buy even more during such crashes now, websites inventories clears out fast. And this is just for the store of value utility. 
Thank you man, just trying to make some point across. And I believe your bank account was empty, but you were rich in crypto?

But there are some players which paid a shitload of money to buy these Coins, they dont want the price to drop, so if it does not cost \*\*much\*\* they hold it up \- maybe...
Yeah but selling volume hasn't been anywhere to be found either. 
I think a lot of people short to increase bitcoin stack... pretty much every trader has cold storage. let people short bitcoin guilt free. plus... more fodder for liquidation
Sustaining the operating cost of miners for the network at $400k is ridiculous to believe even after the next halvening. 36 btc dumped on the market per hour plus the remaining gox coins. Even $20k was hardly believable to be sustained. I'm doubtful about $10k too. People forget it costs a shitload of money to secure the network.
Yeah because it's guaranteed that BTC is going to the moon right? 
nah, we've seen this time and time again when price stagnates the bears take control and it takes the elevator down. Bears aren't even trying right now, they have no short exposure for bulls to threaten and without it bulls are weaaaak
not really, there is still the default selling pressure

miners selling to pay the bills

whales selling to pay for their lambos and mansions

ICOs selling to pay for their goods and services

> if we see 7k in the short-term i'll give you 0.01 BTC.

Thanks, but no need. What do you call short-term, though?  :·D   
You have a very poor imagination.

And no avalanche needed.  Slow bleed will do the trick.
We were 5900 a few weeks ago. 
Let’s see how it go’s. On the plus side we’ll be able to buy for cheap, however it would of been nice if 10k was a closed chapter.
It's worth noting that according to many definitions you needn't have it on margin. If you hold Bitcoin, you're long Bitcoin. 

But in crypto community, generally it refers to leveraged or margin longs.
Would that be like a stop limit or buy limit or just buying and then selling whenever 
What’s the target for it? Afk right now
Looks like it's about to pump to me..
yes
A 70% drop is considered a downtrend for many.  You are welcome to your "unique" definition, but doesn't really change the English language.

Decentralization is arguably primarily about removing tail events.

If one 'waits until they really need it', it's too late. It's like DPoS vs. PoS.

>I wish I needed it, I wish I felt financially hamstrung and trapped by the current system, but I don't.

You don't see in plain sight the externalities arising from the tracking of your spending/consumer behaviour, constraints on capital etc. 

Reason beyond what smacks you in the face.




And also what is chequing
It's a case study. A data point.

Take from it & abstract what you will in terms of impending market influence.
Well shorter timeframes are incredibly overbought. Look at the 15 min RSI for example. 10 green candles in a row and above RSI 85. There's not much upside left before some sideways here.
Yes, good point and perhaps I jumped the gun there.  I am just tired of fighting the market on this one.
I think you misunderstood any price right now under 10k will be a steal in the coming time. 
I would rather invest my money in BTC instead of a vacation. Only downside of the universe fucking with me is that o thought we were going to 7k. 
I thought we would hit 7k and after I’ve cancelled the price jumped. Fuck it, going to buy in anyways. Looks like 10k is going to become a closed chapter after a while. Jump in 
its a single 15 minute green dildo and then volume returns back to nothing.

i asked the same: "how much can i trade without risking my funds to be blocked?" the answer was they dont have limits. ^^


That's like the Bitfinex tax reporting alert \- only some selected people need to provide docs, no reason or insight into the system provided. 

DEXes should help with this issue for trading, there is no established practice yet but probably it will be accepted that if the trader holds the privkey at all times the exchange is legally not processing money. Cashing out is forever risky though.
they didnt call it "blocked" but they just didnt send me my sepa withdrawal. i think status of the withrdawal was "processing" but for weeks. it felt like taking my money hostage. i dont trade there anymore.

I would love to see that, an 80-90% crash from 100k-125k down to 10-15k
Yeah I'm suprised it passed 8300, but seems to be falling back already. Also really not the volume I was expecting for a breakout. Seems little interest to hop in yet. 
Yeah the spike in volume should occur by sellers at the trough of the shoulders, especially the second shoulder. This indicates that sellers *actually tried* to push the price down but failed to bring the price lower than the head, thus showing the strength of buyers/weakness of sellers. 

That wasn’t really happening here. Volume was literally tapering off until that very last candle that “broke out” from the neckline. 
I mean, all it really takes is a signal for buyers to step in. 

Even if the IHS isn’t valid on a technical basis, I agree, this move could still be the catalyst to draw in buyers. 
For an IHS or HS confirmation it actually does matter. I commented somewhere on this thread why the volume is important.

too choppy, market volume too low to say which way it is going. Below 200 MA is bearish so I would say short term is unclear, mid is bear.
it is from here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8kn6h8/the\_nonlinear\_correlation\_between\_market\_cap\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8kn6h8/the_nonlinear_correlation_between_market_cap_and/)

I had to think, but you are right, if the big hodlers would be willing to give them away for a big loss. 
It's a good question and I can't really say for sure.

- Lack of margin trading
- Lack of alts offered
- Negativity on its customer service
- Bitcoincash insider trading debacle
- People leaving resulting in less liquidity resulting in more people leaving
- Tax information shared with IRS.

All of these play a role, and I'm sure I'm missing things too. It will be interesting to see if it picks back up when overall volume in the space increases again. 
GDAX is not an attractive platform for traders. No margin and no alts = no way to make good profits the way the market has been recently. It's more of a place for newbies and hodlers, not so much degenerates such as ourselves.

15min macd / stoch rsi should give you a fairly reliable entry rn, even tho I'd still only use low lev and no sl to not panick on a 5% move against your position and add on the next big dip once 3h stoch falls from overbought to oversold. That's my strategy atm anyway but with 8150 entry. Then I'll exit based on 1D signals.
They used to be an extremely reliable indicator for a huge move. Back in the sub 5k region throughout early 2017

Now the bots have learned to expect it and somehow manage to push sideways through bband passes

True. Money is  money if you see there's some to be made. And like you said maybe it'll go a bit more than you think cuz bitcoin volatility!!

But you won't short it?

By the way, just wanted to thank you for posting your trades. I got pretty chopped up this week and lost a bit of confidence, so it's great that I can reference the pros here when not feeling sure about my next move. You, /u/haserfauld and /u/veltrop, to name a few, have been incredible helpful in this barting fuckery.
I just tried it.
Ahh I see. Sorry. 
Ahh, both of those aren't my typical play. Gotcha.
The dips have no volume either, I'm just saying I don't think low volume is necessarily bearish in this case especially since it's the weekend. 
Selling volume?
Obviously I didn't heed your advice to short...Hence the facepalm comment.
then you aren't risking 4% of your stack in exchange for a 15-20% move down, which is the nonsense you posted above.
Very low for finex 
Yeah I'm also looking at it and eth because ETH has a similar formation and it's currently up against it's resistance line. If it can pop over I think btc will make a similar move. 

eth: https://www.tradingview.com/x/stp7Puni/

btc: https://www.tradingview.com/x/shcayR8w/

Think I'll wait for eth to cross the 710 or so to protect from a fakeout.

It's looking good!
Do they leave a more permanent impact for you after a bad short or a bad long or a missed short or a missed long? 
 Less friction, lower fees. Wins every time.
Reality is all the bears and shorters need.  Look at the chart.
>  You really can't ban crypto

Yes you can and reality is proof of that.

>  Price has nothing to do with fundementals

I'll just leave that sitting out there.
Well the thing is they more of a desperation than anything. There weren't much of those during past bull markets.
But the herd is coming...

I think the disconnect in these dialogs is that maybe they are true compared to last year (maybe). Wonderful if so. But, the price is almost triple what it was this time last year. If all the positive sentiment is true, maybe millionaires are hoarding in underground crypto shelters, maybe governments are hoarding otc for reserves.... maybe it's just priced in.

If you want to plan for this future world and truly believe it to be coming, DCA, you've got some time. 
They are desperate and I get it, but it's a bit too obvious to anyone out here with decent critical thinking skills.
The world would have noticed 2.5 billion BTC purchased.  When one guy sells 1000 it sends the price crashing down and that's barely 10 mil.

[Edit]. That's over 250,000 coins. 
https://coin.dance/volume/localbitcoins/IRR

Most of it was OTC and from miners. Those will eventually bought back from the market
it's used a lot in europe too.  The point is that in let's say february, people were posting about crashing and whatever now no one posts
Your point is very clear. 

The moment I reached my hotel room I opened my laptop, sold some stack, and started filling by bank account as I needed it. This is the time we are living in, things like this amaze me. :)  
remember that ‘crash prevention’ meme from a few months ago? people injecting money at crucial moments to protect larger investments? could answer the green side of our current BART market. also is low volume usually an indicator for dumps? 
sell volume can alpear out of nowhere. Buy volume not so much imo
If you short / long on bitmex, you are basically long term holding BTC by default so yes

Yeah
when it broke 8k there was still no volume , so it applies both ways
And that’s pretty much how trading works folks.

/r/Buttcoin trolls are really upset that their avalanche theory didn't work out, now it's slow bleed. Next it will be delayed rat poison effect. Then it will be sapping fapping effect. Then it will be delayed engorgement. You will run out of status effects eventually.
That was in February. A few months ago.
Sure. Most would call this on spot, in crypto, right? 
When i short btc i am selling at with a limit sell or a market sell. Some exchanges let you borrow btc if you have none to sell. When you open a such a contract you are obligated to buy the same amount later. If price drops you keep the profit, if it rises you lose money.

Longing is the opposite 
First target was here at 8,5k, next target is around 8,7k. 

But the second target would break through the uptrend. Might not go there... 

8,6k is reachable, though. That would correspond with the upper limit of the uptrend *and* the 400 hour EMA.

We might form a bull flag here and then go up there...
I'm feeling the same thing
In Bitcoin it's a divot. Also, don't draw lines for ATHs or you'll always show a "down trend."
Correct me if I'm wrong because I'm missing something. This is the 2H. 

Lows to lows in blue, highs in red.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/4Uefxat3/

All I can see is price made a higher low and RSI didn't, that would be a hidden bullish div, in blue. In red, price made a higher high and RSI as well but maybe not as steep, so maybe a tiny one? And the hidden bullish div probably played out already.

Now the 12H is another story. I can see that one clearly:

well if he's gonna be subtle about it so am I
rude
Decentralisation has advantages, but there is value in centralisation for insurance, refunds, fraud prevention, and other consumer protections. For the average person those things aren't trivial. As for privacy, the whole idea of a 'public' ledger isn't helping. Scaling for Bitcoin will ultimately require a 2nd and probably 3rd layer that provides the necessary consumer protections anyway. The real case for crypto is sound money, but if a 2nd or 3rd layer scaling solution allows fractional reserve banking, then it gets us nowhere. It turns out sound money that's decentralised and private and scalable is kinda hard to achieve.
French checking.
Czeck king
The correct & original word. N.Americans say “checking”
That's what I figured, although I don't look at RSI.  I probably should. But we are about $600 above the recently low and this is still a bear market, so I'm betting (with my BTC) there's a further pullback from this spike.  
You don't realise that crypto and BTC could go to $0? 

There is no guarantee of anything
NO FOMO
That's retarded. I can personally say that I contributed to the volume in that 1 candle with a stop Buy. Plenty of other people here said they had stops above 8400 too.
Again, no. Positions close and open during breakouts and breakdowns. Volume is expected to surge during these periods. It's definitely not "1 trader", it's the market.

Yup, I have seen this in other places as well. Makes very little sense, because it's either 'they have no limits', or they have some kind of limits, at each of which they ask more and more intrusive questions.
Wow, that's bad. At least /u/b24t could withdraw in crypto. I won't trust Bitstamp with non-trivial amounts again, rather split sales into chunks so they can only hold a fraction hostage. Or KYC with another exchange.

Paging /u/Bitstamp-Domen, please "elaborate" on [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8kqeh2/daily_discussion_sunday_may_20_2018/dz9zuuz/).
that is pretty awful. Again with the complete lack of transparency in those cases. Immediately makes you feel like a criminal, for no reason. Why not just tell people? Like u/mango_drive said, at least I was able to withdraw mine in crypto.

I read that it as satire. It requires some effort. If it manages to pass rule 1 I don't have a problem with it.
I appreciate the sentiment, but I've been getting chopped up pretty bad myself.

And I won't short here, no. The resistance line from $10,000 broke to the upside. I have no idea how high buyers are going to take this, but after a moderate drop or at least some sideways, there should be more upside. 
Woah woah.  I am no pro.  And those guys are my mentors.

But if I've said anything that has helped you out, that makes me happy. I've found your posts containing TD to be helpful.

I don't think anyone should be following my trades though.  If I post a trade I'm looking for criticism of it!
u/haslerfaud is amazing. Truly a gem of this sub lately
Me neither, I'm more of a 1h and 4h person, but I checked the 30 min when I saw haserfauld's comment.
we'll find out soon enough
Yeah never seen it this low. What would you guess, where are we heading first?
maybe i should start paying attention to eth too

since you've been following both does it feel like eth has been the driver lately? I've seen a few comments about it on this sub but havent done my homework on that yet 
The bad ones, not the missed ones.  Like when I hedged at 9k expecting a drop, between the 11.7 double tops, and lost 5% of my *holding* stack on the way back up. 

At that time I was sending funds to bitstamp and doing big trades for that.  Since then I use leverage to do the same in a more nimble way, with less exposure.
Reality is that no one knows where the price of Bitcoin will go. You can't predict that it will crash and never reach ATH again like people couldn't predict that it would go to almost 20k in 2017.

Permabulls who say stupid meme shit all the time are just as annoying, but you guys thinking that only bears see the "reality" of Bitcoin is so fucking cringeworthy that I can't even describe it. Good job being so woke, I bet we all wish we were just as smart and enlightened as you.
I just bought 0.1 BTC from this website, with my debit card:

https://digiexchange.net

And I can sell all those crytos as well as buy them. In a country that technically crypto is banned. 

If fundementals were anything, Tron would not be a top 10 coin. Let leave that sitting out there.
Not all in btc not all from exhanges. OTC and miners mostly.
Ok. That makes sense. 
yeah, the buzz is not there anymore. It will return when we have a real crash or bull run. The thing is, I don't think we'll have either. Just slow and steady growth.
So true, people here really don't need to use cyrpto or don't want to. But it's being used more and more frequently out there. Just need to step out of their comfort zones to understand it. It was always a bottom to top solution, not top to bottom. That's what banks were doing all along and screwing up.
> sell volume can alpear out of nowhere. Buy volume not so much imo

It just happened a few hours ago. You don't seem to have a good short term memory.
Sell volume is always temporary because there's only so much rare and precious Bitcoin to go around. Buy volume is 24-7-365.  I've said it before, and I'm sure I'll have to say it again: only retarded midgets sell Bitcoin (and I say this as someone who has been a retarded midget in the past).
we were already down $2k at that point and most timeframes were oversold, can't go down in a straight line
bitcoin really dropping 
Slow bleed is the the price dropping slowly, rather than quickly in an "avalanche".
> Then it will be sapping fapping effect.

Lol bro care to eloborate? :D
It is still long.
Yes 
We disagree about basic TA.
you can't just use any high, you have to use the highest high of the last peak
Connect it to the 8800 peak and you will see the hidden bear on 2H.... basically what you drew on 12h. 

Not too worried about the HTF ones I think many of them have either played out or have time to invalidate. If we can set a higher low after the next dump bulls will come rushing in on that signal. 
subtle like trippin on acid at your sisters graduation and you’re giving the commencement speech
LOL
I am only trading breakouts and breakdowns now. Since volume dropped below 18k BTC it feels like betting will only get you chopped up. But good luck!
A risk I’m willing to take, Paris will still is where it is
BTC will never go to zero
Highly unlikely, barring a black swan.
you only put in a trade because of the 1 trader to decided to pump it. 

if you're in a pool chilling and then someone takes a dump in the pool and you get out and everyone else... would you have gotten out of the pool if the person didnt take a dump in the pool?
sure, sometimes wash trade shorts/longs are closed. you see these as a giant buy volume then giant sell volume right after (and sometimes vice versa)

also bitfinex allows you to have multiple accounts, so when I say 1 trader, it could be 1 trader with dozens of accounts.

when even whalepool is telling people to ditch bitfinex somethings about to go down 
\>  Why not just tell people? 

Because that is how AML laws are being done. The financial institution \(bank or other\) will never tell you the policy or algo they are using. They will never tell you tell us this or that and you will be fine. This is why the policy is successful but at crazy costs and collateral damage. I am pissed off too, it is always with them like that, but I always tell myself that BTC and crypto go that high exactly because this shit is happening.

It is worse every year. So take a deep breath.
Utterly impossible. If we make a new ATH you can say goodbye to sub 6k forever, likely sub 10k. Bitcoin never starts a new market cycle only to come back lower than the previous low, has never happened, would not make technical or fundamental sense.  (Aside from fatal flaw in code or any other black swan anamoly that would drop price to $0) 

True, it might not hit 100k in the next bubble, but wherever it goes, 11-20k will be the new support and the depths of the despair zone.
Haha, I guess so. Still possible it's a fakeout as per 15th of May, but it's looking pretty okay. Would've expected a BGD, but this is fine too. Let's we to where it runs, IH&S is confirmed at 8380 approximately. 
I like this quote.
What does this mean?
I guess I need to add the /s, thought it was obvious. 
That's how trends usually work.
What a humble comment! Amazing bro
No we won't find out anything new at all.  Your statement was dumb, regardless of where the price goes from now.
A strong move in BTC will 'usually' drag ETH along to at least some extent, and a strong move in ETH drags BTC with it -- both up and down. As far as I can tell, it tends to be more pronounced during 'off' hours, presumably because arbitrage bots are left unattended and keep trading on the ratio even though they're technically running at a loss at that point. 
I don't really know (or think it really matters) who drives who, but it's clear that they're somewhat in sync since the downtrend started. 

Therefore to get a better look at the price action I keep both their respective resistances in mind when looking at up/downside potential. 

Think we're going to see some fireworks soon.


Yes, leverage helps with all that mess.
I think I'm the same way, the shorts are more painful. I hedged around 8k and it was not a good feeling after. 
I think this must be because we're medium term bullish, right?

My issue on the other side is averaging down is okay except when the drop is big then I get worried and close out.  Realized I need to use smaller part of my allocation because when I close I know I'm probably making a mistake but fear of another large candle against me is painful so I do it anyway just to watch it come back up.  When I started the trade I'd say I'm setting it and forgetting it till my number is hit but rarely works like that. 
>  Reality is that no one knows where the price of Bitcoin will go. 

Spoken like someone who is utterly clueless about trading.  Keep holding. It is all you are capable of.

>  but you guys thinking that only bears see the "reality" of Bitcoin 

What a boring straw man.

And yes, living in reality is sometimes not easy, but I end up with more money in the end as a result, so that's what I shoot for.
> If fundementals were anything, Tron would not be a top 10 coin. Let leave that sitting out there.

Yes lets leave it out there, because says everything about how your brain works.
yes now is the time to accumulate for real, and invest some of the (more) risk free profits into hyped alts with like 0.5% position size
miners are constantly selling so this is actually the opposite. constantly need new buyers or the price will sag
Isnt that what a bart is?
 Like it, maybe expand a bit with some pop culture.... BDSN, Bitcoin, don't catch you slippin now? Get your money, bitcoin, get your money, bitcoin, yeah, your just a big dawg, yeah. 
That's not going to happen.  The price isn't dropping unless you hae the attention span of gnat.
Thanks for the explanation. What is your view on the market today and the coming week?
Bitcoin price increases rapidly, you want to fap to it but slight dips will give you weak hands :D
Well yeah.... Just translating to what people mean in this sub, or so I thought. 
Alright, now I see what you mean, /u/CatPizzas32 and /u/SloppySynapses.

black swan coming soon buddy don't you worry your little head.

Oh I get it.

But just saying, you can't become a good trader  thinking that one almighty being dictates every big candle. If the market wanted to head lower, it had every opportunity to do so but it bounced every time. Volume was increasing, leading up to the big green candle. Was that all one person too?
It's not 1 trader, bro. It's not even 2 or 3 traders. The market is dynamic and reactive to these moves. Your argument is pretty silly. The KYC/AML point may have some merit but you're doing damage to that argument by saying such silly things about 1 trader acting on the market alone. That's just not how it works.
Seriously, traders watch for volume spikes at key levels, say after a bull flag, and then market order the party. Maybe someone kicked it off, but many people participated and took profit at the wick.

Hehe thanks that was nice.

Seriously though, full disclosure, after many yearly attempts of periodically trying to get into trading and then failing out, I've only gained confidence in the last several months after committing to go deeper with it.  Though I had some intermittent luck in the early days, I'm still overall in the red if I trace back to 2012.  On a mission to get all that back, at a crawls pace.

My first foray into trading was forex in 2009, that was a joke of a failure if I look back knowing what I know now.

Next mission will be to get back all the coin I spent in the previous bear market when I thought btc was dead, that's a much higher threshold to reach.
it's looking good now, but i'm going to get very excited only if btc can hit 8600 and stay above that level

it will probably struggle on the way there as it still has to cross 8363 and 8464

fib levels
I don't know if Id call this medium term bullish.  We are right in the middle of a giant symetrical triangle.  This is no mans land.  Lookign at the recent touch on the top, we are due to go meet its bottom.
I wish that I could live in reality and be so woke just like you and know where the price will go with certainty.

To your edit: I don't trade much, because it'd be more or less like gambling and I don't want to take the risks. And my holding since 2013 have paid off pretty decently. I wasn't trying to shit on traders, bulls, bears or anything, only on your psychotic conviction that you're right no matter what. And making holding sound like something that only feeble-minded people do proves that you're probably angry, arrogant and a shitty person.

Keep believing that your bet is the "reality", that's one way to try to rationalize your decision. If woke people like you knew where the price is going and are so excellent at trading, why aren't you filthy rich?

I profited much from swing trading alts during this mini crash. I was sure bitcoin would go back up according to my own analysis, and invested in bottomed out alts. Risky, but profitable af. 
Lmao

Every time someone asks now I'm gonna say BGD is bitcoin going dumb and BRD is bitcoin really dropping
Hmmmmmmm now zoom out and observe the trend from January 
Someone is in denial and losing a great deal of money.  You have my pity.
I am just waiting to see if it breaks the downtrend resistance line form $10K.  It did earlier today, briefly, and then dropped below it.  I shorted a good bit at around $8360, so just waiting it out for now, although it hanging in there fairly well.  But that trend line is everything at the moment, so just watching that.
It's going down in the coming week.  Great time to go short.  You have a 50/50 chance of maybe making 500 bucks over four days of intense stress.  Or you could just do the smart thing and buy to hold since that works no matter what happens next week or next month.
Hahaha bro this is crackling. :D
At least in my life time  agahahahh
Lol, this is a retarded statement. A black swan is something that is not easily foreseen or predicted. 

What exactly are you predicting here?
you cant trust volume on exchanges that allow wash trading. you have no idea if someone is just buying or selling to their own orders 
they were the primary cheerleaders for bitfinex against all of the 'tether fud'.


8600 is still pretty far away, haha. It'll really need a jump-start to get there, but breaking out of the wedge could give it a solid jolt for people to hop back in (this wedge is being watching by pretty much everyone by now I think)

I personally think that we will challenge the downtrend resistance again today -> if we pass, go up to 8385-8400 -> small retrace to confirm resistance as support, then pump past to complete the I H&S. 

Right now it still has too little follow through and volume to even get past the resistance, but its still looking promising and a definite sign of strength that bears are losing control. 

I'm setting alamrs and keeping my eyes peeled. 

Edit: eth is now challenging 710 and volumes picking up!

Edit #2: Seems like it's getting rejected. Probably best to wait for a few hours to see if it drops, and if so how far. 
Can you share that? 
> I wish that I could live in reality and be so woke just like you and know where the price will go with certainty.

Way to follow along.
> Reality is that no one knows where the price of Bitcoin will go.

Just leaving that out there...says it all.
Not a bad call. I mean its pretty hard to stay up to speed on the crazy acronyms when they are quoted daily. 

If I were you, I'd send gibberish back, Bongo Ring Doorbell, but you're a nice guy. 
I didn't buy in January or any time after July last year so it's irrelevant to me.  Only started buying again recently, in February when my $6K limit executed.  Have an order at $7.5 now.  Hoping you guys get it there but not holding my breath.  
You know what's actually really funny -- I just realized that the only time I've sold Bitcoin in the past two years was on January 1. I sold a little bit to pay for a trip I took over the holidays and waited until January to sell so that I wouldn't have to declare any gains on my 2017 taxes.  So... yeah... buy the dips and only sell minimal amounts strategically is the best strategy if you have the luxury of time.  Shorting on leverage is a loser's game.
If you mean me, you couldn't be more wrong.  If you're talking about the mad dumpers, I have no pity for them. 
everyone thinks bitfinex and tether is going to be just fine and even if it blows up bitcoin only drops like 2 bucks. 
Doesn't change the fact that the rest of the market is not sitting idly while 1 person hits the books. Again, not how it works. Sorry.

hahahaha it's hard for me to mislead people even if I'm joking. I feel bad if anyone takes it seriously 
Yes all the people who "dumped" their BTC between $20K and $8K have really lost out.
BFX and other USDT exchanges only make up a small portion of the market. It'll likely do some damage but won't change anything fundamental about Bitcoin long term. Not to mention that there's no evidence Tether is insolvent.

Keep dreaming though dude. 
sure, bots respond to wash trades on other exchanges not realizing they are wash trades. 

1 person hits the books and the rest of the market responds.

if 1 person fomo buys his own sell orders on bitfinex, market responds to false info.
if 1 person fole sells into his own buy orders triggering a crash, market responds to false info. 
anyone with a functioning brain knows that when a company fires an auditor, somethings up. 

they were all screaming how tether is legit and audit is coming soon to prove tether fudders all wrong.

then auditor was fired.

who was proven wrong? tether defenders 
Haha in retrospect that’s true :) seemed far away at the time though, haha
Interesting, I'll keep an eye on this, thanks
Too nice of a bear. Glad to have you around man. 
Over time, yes, if they didn't buy back lower.  The ones who sold at $8K are already losing and should probably buy back soon, or they will regret it for the rest of their lives.

Let me just say: I know people who sold all their Bitcoin at $1000 with massive gains and kick themselves every day for it. 
lol

thats funny.

over 70% of all so-called usd volume is bfx or tether

> Not to mention that there's no evidence Tether is insolvent.

they fired the auditor because everything is fine and books are in order?
So now you're backpedaling? Don't make outrageous statements if you don't want them to be picked apart.

What a goofy statement.   You believe you have magical powers to see the future with certainty..how amusing.
> over 70% of all so-called usd volume is bfx or tether

Source?
1 asshole makes a move and triggers a pump or dump is 1 person deciding what the market does next.

1 person dumping 1k btc onto the order books triggers an entire correction, 1 person pumping 8m into btc triggers a fomo buy pump.

then volume plummets after his move and prices move sideways until the next guy decides to do something which could be pump or dump.

heres another way to look at it:

1 person shits in a pool and everyone has to gets out. 
it's not clutching at straws

tether fired the auditor, thats a fact.

after years of promising audits.

if tether had the money they claim to have then an audit would be easy its just money in a bank account.
Coinmarketcap.

look at the BTC/USD pairs and BTC/USDT pairs. Lump in Bitfinex with USDT.

Over 70% of volumes are always bitfinex/tether.
Again, not how the market works. But think whatever you like, I'm done entertaining this stupid conversation.

Okay but that's still only USD volume. Also, it doesn't get to the heart of the issue, which is whether they're solvent or not. The auditor was fire/quit because they couldn't perform the audit, which is likely quite complex, in a timely manner. I don't see why that is such a red flag for you. Sounds like you're just concern trolling. Tether FUD is so 2017.
how is money in a bank account 'complicated'
You think that's what an audit amounts to? Lol, you're such a terrible troll. Try harder.
