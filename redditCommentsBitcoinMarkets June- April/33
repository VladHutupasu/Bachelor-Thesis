[Daily Discussion] Tuesday, May 01, 2018 -- TITLE

The top edge of the Ichimoku Cloud @8900 (10,30,60,30) seems to be holding as support for now. I would like to see the daily candle close above 8900 and we should still be OK. That will keep us above the cloud with a bullish TK cross and close to a Kumo Twist.

Using the doubled settings (20,60,120,30) which I normally use for BTC on the daily, we are still setup for a nice edge-2-edge trade. We are still waiting on the bullish TK cross on this time frame though. Regardless, I still think we will touch either of these flat areas on the top of the cloud. The flat tops/bottoms of these clouds are FIBs of something (ATH, Lows, etc..) and the price is generally attracted to these areas. The price is also attracted to the opposite side of the cloud once it closes inside the cloud (on large time frames). The combination of these 2 factors makes me think we are going to do the following:

If we already had the bullish TK cross and Kumo twist on the 1D doubled setting it would be 100% bull city officially. But we are not there quite yet. Still looking good though.








Long at 9040 5x margin. Targetting a revisit 9400$. 
Closed my $3MM short @ $8895 posted [here,](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8fhion/z/dy3m0qd) breaking even. About to take another flight without wifi, would rather not risk this chop while airborne.

I earned approx 3xbt from funding swaps while holding this position. 
Why is everyone arguing over lines lol
Long from $9,040. The re-accumulation --> markup --> distribution theory looks like it could be playing out. Target above $10,000, but will be watching and reevaluating based on action.

People with similar entries, what are your targets?

If we bottom out at 8900 that would be incredibly bullish.

If we drop below 8600, I’ll be worried.
Closed my longs for a profit, may have been a bit premature but can’t afford to take a loss after some bad trades. 

Bullflag broke down. 

Sitting it out for now and going to wait for another entry. 

Good luck all. 
Closing my short from 9100 and putting in a 2x long at 8978. Looking back at the dip yesterday it actually was nothing much at all in terms of volume, followup or percent of price. Although we clearly broke down from the rising support line, we are still in the lower bottom of a pitchfork I have which has normally done me good.  I think we will be seeing 9200 again today, an apparent average for the last week of chop in the 8600-9700 range. In other words, in the medium term this dip was par for the course. 1h 2h macd appears to be reversing while 3h 4h are planing off, whereas 15m is turning downwards which is a concern.

Being conscientious that this could be a new downtrend I'm putting in stops at 8850 which is just below some kind of resistance line (I see 8800 mentioned often but I don't see it).
Ahh, good morning BTC that feeling when you hit your posted target within 3 dollars and it bounces is a nice one. So looking at my tea leaves this morning I see two possible cases.

*Bullish Case*

Triangle Formation - https://www.tradingview.com/x/hY8mQOm5/

We are in the middle of a W4 Triangle consolidation and have just found the C point after a double corrective zigzag. We hit a 1:1 target and the 1H chart produced a pinbar reversal. Now we are looking for another ABC zigzag to find the D point at the top of the down treading line. This will define my ENTRY on a breakout later. We should then retrace in either another zigzag or smaller triangle windup to give us our E point preparing for a decisive break to the upside. This E point will define the STOP.

Normally I would look at various extensions of W1,W3 from W4 but the precise wave picture is unclear coming off the bottom pivot at 6.4k so its a little muddy. Instead I will be using a measured move of the Triangle from the breakout point with expectations of heavy resistance at the 0.786 broader structure and horizontal resistance.

First TP target of 10300 with a second target 10600.

Broader Targets - https://www.tradingview.com/x/d4NkgCQc/

*Bearish Case*

We could technically still be looking at a larger correction of a completed W5 or a smaller correction of a completed W3 in an ABC. Given the recent action this is the less likely case but to ignore it would be foolish. Keeping options on the table and having a plan for each is very important.

I would not short a break of the PIVOT 8600 due to the very close first target on a 1:1 ABC/ 0.386 Fib target of 8450. We could go deeper than this in a very aggressive selloff and reach the 0.5 Fib and 1:1.618 ABC Extension as well as the Point of Control on the volume profile. 

Targets - https://www.tradingview.com/x/WCmEFt1h/

In either case the medium and long term momentum has shifted bullish, however don't get caught in the fomo if the bullish case proceeds there is a good chance of a broader correction still to come. If the bearish case takes hold don't get caught in a panic sell-off with strong supports nearby. I will be looking to build a long term position from here if it plays.

Disclaimer: Default long only no positions.
I mean, that's a green candle on the hourly. It's hopeful at least.

I can't help but feel this is accumulation or fakeout time. Or both. Or Worse. I really don't know what to think anymore. Sorry for shitposting.
Bullish signs:

* [price bounced off support at 2nd fib fan line](https://imgur.com/a/mUWqV7o)

* 6hr candle with long lower wicker, price fell to 8810s but drove back up to 8990s
* Price still comfortably above support at 38.2 (8610s)
* Daily RSI broke through 60 (on 4/20) for first time since ATH
* Daily Stoch RSI "reset"

Bearish signs:

* 4hr closed below EMA50 
* 4hr crossed below MACD zero line 
* 4hr broke below Bbands
* 4hr fell below RSI 40 twice (>40-50 considered bullish)
* 6hr MACD falling below zero line
* Daily MACD looks dangerously close to crossing below signal line 

Neutral (?) signs:

* decreasing volume in past 3 days
* ratio of longs:shorts decreasing


Bullish divergence on the 1hr.

Edit: Also a hidden bullish divergence on the 4hr
Long from 8940 , no TA just my gut feeling I didn't listen to it when it told me to buy EOS at 6 or ONT at 2
Listening to it now 
Just a quick scalp short to test the position logger bot


!short XBTUSD 8969 5x 0.25 -sl 9050


Looks like Mike finally got his short.
dem large buy and sell walls on gdax keep disappearing and reappearing.  I am a fish swimming in circles trying not to be eaten. 
Looks like we broke out from the 9050 level and from the resistance line of the chart I posted before:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/w6CR2aRT/

RSI is hot on the 15-45 minutes so I’de expect a minor pullback before our next leg up. 

Hopefully resistance turns support. Although we broke with less of an explosion from the 26th, we sill managed to break through it after knocking on its door a second time. 

Not home so i cant re chart 

Edit: Broke through, not broke out

My view of the world right now; https://www.tradingview.com/x/TRDV0DZu/

Put my stack back in at the bottom, hoping for some more confirmation when I wake up. Night all
All in, Kanye West is talking about Bitcorn
~~hidden bullish~~ positive divergence on the 4 hour near major resistance.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/6XkCe2lb/

There should be a lot of ATH resistance around here too:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/k9gZ1PH0/

BBands are tightening.

Breakout or breakdown is imminent.

https://www.moonmath.win says the trend is up.

Edit: **Positive Divergence** is bullish and occurs in a down trend when the price action prints lower lows that are not confirmed by the oscillating indicator. This indicates a weakness in the down trend as selling is less urgent or buyers are emerging. When the oscillator fails to confirm the lower lows on the price action, it can either makes higher lows, which is more significant, or it can make double or triple bottoms. The latter occurs more often on oscillators, such as RSI and Stochastics that are range bound and less often on oscillators such as MACD and CCI that are not range bound.

Most likely a hidden sell wall at 9099~9099.9

Probably not a coincidence

https://www.tradingview.com/x/LNXpCa92/
Come on bears, this is just pathetic. I said yesterday "impress me" but this last dump has been anything except impressive
Fresh **LONG**

Buy @$8950

Targets

1: $9250
2: $9550
3: $9950

Alarm set at $8820. 

RSI sufficiently cooled, momentum is turning up, supported by increasing volume. Bears had a weak showing--this was supposed to be significant.  
Well, got stopped on my scalp short. At least the bot seems to be working.

!short XBTUSD close 9069
I wouldn't be too worried about this recent dip, unless we make a new local low below $8650 or so. This still looks like re-accumulation to me: https://www.tradingview.com/x/p0p1YnMf/

I still expect this to hit at least 8.7k as I commented on a few days ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8fhion/daily_discussion_saturday_april_28_2018/dy3z3uf/

I'm still considering adding to my long from 8.8k depending on what the market looks like once we make it to 8.7k.
How on earth are [longs](https://www.tradingview.com/x/v421PcSO/) still so much higher than [shorts](https://www.tradingview.com/x/cXCguqs2/)? TA is an interesting way to help make predictions or analyze the past, but no matter what the charts say right now, I’m just still not convinced we’re out of this bear market yet. Call me a dreamer/contrarian/whatever, but I’m *still* calling for sub $6k. I’m not going to be a sucker for these whale games. They’re going to try to make us believe what supports the narrative they are pushing. This whole BGD pump feels like straight up bullshit (no pun intended).
i don't know if someone has already posted it, if yes i say sorry.

masterluc last chart (posted yesterday) is bearish in mid-term (he explained in the comments below that mid-term = 1 year and longterm = years.)

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/ETsf4M8H-Midterm-picture-looks-bearish/
Haven't seen Stoch RSI lined up as bullish as it currently is in quite awhile. 2 Hr and 4 Hr have recently crossed bullish in the oversold region, with the 6 Hr and 12 Hr both oversold with a *potential* cross if we continue bouncing. The daily is not oversold but fairly far removed from overbought and has plenty of room to move up.

Usually at least one of those higher time frames will provide a mixed signal (ie 4 hr overbought, 12 hr oversold). Not the case right now. You have to go all the way to the 3 day to find something on a higher time scale than the 1 hr chart that doesn't appear bullish on the indicator.

For clarification, it's only one indicator and a relatively unreliable one at that, but something to consider when deciding where you think this is going in the short term. There's plenty of things that could indicate further decline in the short term as well, just wanted to point out something on the other side.
Our now 3rd attempt to break up through the bearflag ( thing ) 

Binance broke through, people loaded buys walls from 9100-9108 but they quickly pulled them as it failed to shoot up past 9114

Come on bulls! 
Last week entered short 9280, targetting 8.5-6k. Got stopped out at 9520 and peak was 9570. now we're at 8900. Lesson? If in a tight range, go easy on the leverage so you can have more relaxed stops. maybe its obvious and im just an idiot but oh well.

Still waiting for mid 8k before looking for longs but i can feel the fomo slowly creeping in so im adding little bits to my cold storage.

Does anyone know of any good places i could get feedback on my TA? sounds daft but when youre at school you can just get your teacher to have a look, easy peasy. but when its self taught its a bit harder. maybe not the place to ask either but you guys are the only crypto community i interact with.
CFTC chairman was on CNBC last night talking about Bitcoin- any have a link for that? 
Could be a good entry for a long? The downtrend line from the latest dump has been broken. https://www.tradingview.com/x/RwZv6U9l

EDIT: Went Long at 8940 ... alarms under 8800. Might be a bit premature though. 
1h chart looking kinda bearish at the moment. Lower highs, lower lows, and a hidden bear div that could play out if the buying pressure doesn't pick up.

Some whale(s) keep buying hundreds of BTC whenever it drops below 9k.. Maybe the whales are re-accumulating around 9k because they know 8.8k is very hard to break and do not dare touch it.. 

I have gone long with half of my stack
I'm going to start this off by saying the overwhelming despairing cataclysmic gloom and doom that invades this sub the moment BTC moves a few hundred down is pathetic and delusional. Frankly, I think it's strongly indicative of hypersensitivity in proportion to how much is invested. All this tells me is that people still don't follow the cardinal rule: DON'T INVEST WHAT YOU'RE NOT WILLING TO LOSE!!!
12hr BBands getting tighttighttight. Big move is afoot. I'd say this bulltrap might not look so hot for much longer.

Ok we need a name for this, I am calling it a bullish long divergence ;)

https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZFR1LDU0/

Long are decreasing as a number and a factor of ratio while the price is increasing. Anyone make a bearish case for this happening.
https://www.tradingview.com/x/sSCrfABs/   
Think we are still chopping until daily bbands catch up. Aiming to go long as close to the mid bbands as possible, unfortunately didnt catch the dip today so sitting out. Bullish until we close below the mid.
I'm betting on a pull back to 8950-8850. Broadening bottom atm:

3-day says time for 10k boys https://www.tradingview.com/x/eHmUTB3l/
Is this something to look for? 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/w6CR2aRT/

This is almost the exact same formation we had the last time we broke down to our low on April 26th. Crunch time came and we wound up breaking up from 8878 to 9104. 

This time we have a higher low and we are consolidating in the 8870-9050 range. 

Disclaimer, new to TA and I cut off wicks. 

EDIT: Link to chart from the 26th 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/JDF9zEUc/

If you ignore the fomo wicks we are still very much in a solid downtrend from ATH:

Which sources for learning TA are you guys using? I am struggling on distinguishing which patterns are more common in crypto markets rather than stock markets...
anyone have a link to that prophet dude on trading view who's called like everything who shows the MA pointed down 
Times like this it's sometimes good to zoom out to the 30 day chart. I'm still bullish. Break below 8400 and I will reasses but think we will be 9100+ within 24 hours
Just dipped below $9k on Bitfinex. I've got a feeling it's going to struggle staying above 9 in the short term.
Can someone explain shorting to me please, sorry if its the millionth time you have heard this

I have been in this space for a while and a long time lurker here

A couple of days ago I sent 0.0001 btc to Bitmex and I longed it at 9520 with a 100x leverage

I then closed it at 9580 but ended up with the same amount of btc

I did this as a 'market' buy, I have tried to educate myself a little on this but still a bit unsure

I remember reading a few days ago someone posting at first do 5 x 100x leverage buys just to get your head around it

Surely if I bought at 9520 and sold at 9580 would there not be a profit even if it was dust?

Again please forgive my lack of understanding on this matter, I am well invested and have a decent HODL stack

This will just be some loose change I want to play with
Seems like that $8750 order won't execute. Giving it two more days, and if Dumpy the Bearwhale can't get it there, I'll have to move it up to maybe $8950.
CRSI starting to signal bullish on the daily.
Bears getting tired or just reloading their guns?
I feel surprisingly relaxed holding this 9150 long from days ago.  Am I now dead inside? Has BTC nulled my emotion?  I will keep it open until we break 8700.  I closed a long at 8750 last week for it to just bounce off it.  I am hoping there is big support in this area.  
[removed]
I went short at 9k. Will add all the way to 9.4 and ba out above 9.6. I see a potential AE double top forming the hourly and a resounding rejection of 9.5 the second attempt. 
There's nothing to be alarmed about except alarms themselves.
The chart I posted a couple of days ago still stands (when this sub was all bull posts calling for $10K, $11K or $12K before dropping below $9K) and BTC is playing out exactly as anticipated thus far. We are now in the beginning of C wave and I expect it to take up to two weeks to complete - scenario remains valid providing BTC doesn't bounce back up much above $9.2K level (from where it is now) before hitting lower targets.

Post with chart:
https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8fp2ur/daily_discussion_sunday_april_29_2018/dy5wpfm/

tl;dr:
I think BTC will drop to at least ~$8.3K over the next week but no need to panic unless we go much below $7.5K during this correction before heading back up. Right now, my optimal buy target (if scenario continues playing out as expected) is around $7750.

Also, I got banned yesterday for posting this:
https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8fwtzb/daily_discussion_monday_april_30_2018/dy7hhdw/

However, I hope some people took the advice in it (most of CMC is red today).

Shout out to MikeXBT for keeping his short. Thank you for your contributions to those who went long near the tops on Sunday and Monday before waiting for $9.5K to be broken.

[This](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ownCz3vI/) is the channel I'm looking at.  shorting at 9.3k to hedge against a drop wouldn't be a bad idea.  If we go below 8.8k we're in trouble.

I also thought I'd share everyone's [favorite comparison](https://i.imgur.com/wDOkEmw.png) since the permabulls like it so much.
Is this a valid bearflag? (Still trying to learn)
Seems like 9100 is hard to break, let alone 9200

https://www.tradingview.com/x/lkYYV8A0/
Short\-term bearish outlook. A look at 2 week/1 month/3 month/6 month and 12 month chart for Ether all predict a very obvious pattern.. call it the final bearish wave or consolidation, either way short\-term outlook is bearish.

Feel free to correct my technical view though!
$8750 is the bottom wick of lightsaber candle on Bitfinex and sellers seem to stay away from that for now. If that gets breached the next support is around $8300 levels I believe.
closed my short from 9370 at 8970.. this isnt going to tank just meander sideways for a while


Volume on the dumps are relatively low. It feels like either there's a bearwhale unloading some positions early (not too hurriedly) or they're fighting the bullwhale on a true breakout/BGD. Almost feels like two opposing forces with the bearwhale being more timid if ya knowhatimean
I am confident in the support around here.  I might well add another long at around 8800 with tight stops. Reason: Sun is shining.
Comment submission per hour and per day is low. No buyers at this level after a week of consolidation and a failed attempt at resistance coupled with no major news events.

What is the best exchange for cashing out to GBP? Asking for a friend, but I assume there are also traders here who don't like to hold crypto and prefer to keep their holdings in fiat between trades. Assuming that such still exist?
What generally happens when a sell wall disappears? what if the sell wall is due to whale manipulation? The wall suddenly pulls his sell order? same answer?


Is there an automated way to receive a notification when the daily MACD crosses the signal line? Note that cross appears imminent. e.g. on tradingview or otherwise? I know I can manually pull up my saved chart, but curious if there's more of a push notification capability out there? Thanks in advance.
Target is 9.3, then sideways there and coil tight, before the real next swing. https://www.tradingview.com/x/VJGTAqjJ/
Bears have been larping for a week now, while the 3-day & 5-day have stayed in consolidation and bullishly engulfed https://www.tradingview.com/x/IbjteNPX/
The very tight trading ranges since April gives me the impression that we have been through the accumulation phase and now starting to enter re-accumulation phase. This is most often followed by a markup phase, which brings in the FOMO buyers.

Is there a way to check if any of the gox coins were sold?
Goodness, every drop is attributed to Gox selling his coins.  Weeks ago he came on here saying he couldn't and wouldn't be selling anymore.  
Does anyone here think opening a fresh long here is a good idea i.e. buy the dip in a general upward trend? Or we all believe that now that we have broken the ascending channel and dropped to 8.9k, we’ll go down at least a bit further down (if not much more) before resuming the upward motion again. 

Been reading all the comments since last night but not sure what the general consensus is...
took a 3% loss on a recent trade.. 
bought in at 9170 and got stopped at 8950..
Feels bad because I was thinking about shorting BTC at around 9400-9500 a few times the past couple of days. Guess I have to learn from this somehow.
Edit: Welp, just bought back in again at 9033.. feels bad man. (don't know what i'm doing) 

Broke down the uptrend channel from April 12th, and also broke down small downtrend channel: https://www.tradingview.com/x/QJeCQ6aI/

Downtrend channel support now acting as a resistance. If 8900 does not hold I expect a drop to 8650 where is stronger support, everything under 8650 is bearish reactivation since we already have lower highs, but bulls are still holding higher lows. 




What it's weird its that it seems that we hadnt got a sideways (for bitcoin standards) movement for this long ever since the novermber bear trap. 
I can't watch the  order books right now. How convincing is the support at / around 8.8k? Watching price action alone, it seems fairly strong?


Tagging on a shitpost:

As my liquidation prices have been very good indicators of bounces/tops lately, maybe I should share. Expect this to just touch 8,690 on Mex before a bounce back to 9k and beyond.
To be honest this last week has taken out a lot of the fun of trading for me. I do not trade with so much % of my holdings, so therefore I prefer action and get a big satisfaction from actual strategies playing out.  That's why trading taken over my computer gaming I guess :D 

Just swing trade the 500$ ranges with 3-5x leverage here is the game, but I enjoy in itself to try to understand the market about the more low cap coins and try to trade the volatile waves.
Noob question. Considering how big the market is how come btc has been sitting in a $20 price range for the last hour or so. The other coins of those with which we do not speak are behaving the same way(ish).

Edit for clarity - mainly why is bitcoin at a standstill.
I am hoping for an Adam and Eve double bottom at 8900. If that doesn't work we've got solid support in the 8600-8700 range. I think we might also be in a falling wedge. Personally I'm long, but I'm not sure where price is gonna go. 1h b-bands are tightening up so we should probably be seeing a move soon.
Shorted a big position from 8970, tight stop though. We broke through the 2 week bullish trend, I predict we'll see some further slide down, maybe see the previous FOMO individuals selling their position,  target is 8700\-8600.

All this talk of imminent collapse, yet I wake up to ~$9000. Where is this epic capitulation supposedly destined to send us into months of misery? Don't we have more important financial lessons to learn? I've heard so much about the anthropomorphic qualities of the market and how it enjoys inflicting pain. Maybe it's all a bunch of bullshit.

With each passing day, the RSI cools. Bears better get moving with that leverage and send us tanking or this rocket isn't going anywhere but up. 
did that little rise just now happen right as the AAPL earnings info went public? I mean, hypothetically, if I hold AAPL and I'm considering buying crypto, I might wait until that call to make a move. probably nothing. carry on.

edit: suggesting the possibility that the results of a highly anticipated earnings call with a stock that has a $850B market cap had some effect on the crypto market is stupid? 
(please let it stay for once)

Looking at the BFX charts now, can someone exlained me how can we have on a 15m chart both 9500 and 8755 ? (on 28th April)
You’re condescending and you speak in an elitist way. 

Bottom line.

And yes, I have no problem calling you out on your shit.
My next price target is sub $8,700. If the price hold up there, I might close my short at break even, however, the chances are it will retest $8,600 and might fail and keep plunging downwards. If that is the case, I will keep my short open to get some gains before closing April, which should have been done yesterday from my side, but as I have an open position, I couldn't close the month. 

All the best to everyone. :)

This dip has nothing to do with Mt. Gox people moving 16k BTC and BCH?

Wow. That really did form a perfect descending triangle and hit the measured TP.

9000 looks like good support though so could be ok to long here.
The longer we stay in 9k the longer I think we are going to stay in 9k.

When does 9k start being purple on the rainbow charts

Not sure why but as a hodler I always feel better when I see you close your massive shorts.  
If you don't mind, could you use the bot i created to register your position? It tracks open positions and will allow to see past positions.

The bot scans posts looking for a special syntax as explained in
[bitcoinmarkets.atwebpages.com](http://bitcoinmarkets.atwebpages.com/). This also saves the original link allowing for users to check the original post.

Thanks
There were permabulls talking about countertrading you and lambasting chewy for shorting 9.7. Unreal.  
That is a lot of patience and anxiety for that haha. I saw your previous post and honestly thought you were screwed for a bit, good on you getting out even!
Smart move, breaking even.
Legend. 
God speed. Smells like you can reenter soon with decreased risk.
Hm... Didn't you have stops around the $9400 range? 🤔🤔
Send it to me and I'll trade it for you during your flight.
Because otherwise we'd be arguing over whose crystal ball is clearer.
This is one of the good things about this sub, certain people have their own TA specialisation. Its difficult to be experts in all forms so its nice to be able to browse and see what other forms of TA are saying. 

I find it super interesting when different forms of TA generate the same targets. Getting confluence of results is always a good way to increase the odds in your favor.
Because we like to draw them
it's how we analyze supply & demand
Cause you get banned for a day in the sub if you don't have a chart in your post
to be fair, this sub doesn't discuss fundamentals enough

Targeting the top area of the symmetrical triangle first, 9200~9300.  And max 10.2, which is the breakout target for the same triangle if it breaks up.  The extra horizontal line on that chart is in case we are in a descending triangle, which would target 8k.  I would expect that to breakout later than the symmetric one, so hopefully there'd be time to bail on this 8950 position.

But the partial profits I have set to take at 9200 still won't cover yesterday's stop losses.  So will hopefully take more somewhere above that but not sure where yet.  
Was in a bit earlier, but target 9200, 9400, 9700. Not as far as 10k. (imho).

To be fair I struggle to see it past 9400.
I entered at 9050 and am targeting 9400, then will evaluate from there. 
I had my eyes set on $13k as my last target. I'll be taking profit at each $1k mark
Given that's exactly how 2014 played out, I wouldn't be surprised.
If we have truly moved into consolidation and smart money is building a position this close to 10k then 2019 is going to be otherworldly.
As someone holding a long at 9130, it's been buttclench o'clock all morning.
Doubt 8.9 falls. There's a $1m buy wall at 8890 on bitmex. Should hold this price well. Also bounced hard off 8800 to 8870 instantly. 
It won t because i’m long
I wouldn't count on it seeing as the stock market is doing bad today and NR 1 shitcoin USD has probably started a multimonth/year run. I know people don't think crypto has anything to do with the overall market, but it does and it makes me pretty bearish and sad for what it means to crypto the coming months/years. 
https://imgur.com/a/qhv6eVa

That's the line that makes me okay about ~8800ish level, there's also some horizontal lines you can put around that point as well. 

The patterns are similar to what we've seen on the from first 6k dump, ranging sideways with an upwards bias and (slightly) higher lows on every dip down. 
Really informative, thanks for this 
Ty. 5 bullish signals vs 6 bearish->All in short
Indeed and replicates the one we had on our A point.

I loaded up this morning for that reason. Good luck.
Market sentiment > TA, i'd rather look at the alt-coins and the positive/negative news that's coming in, instead of some patterns that most people are drawing in their own biased way
I like this trade too, but I feel it might be bordering on overtrading to buy here.  It's a 60/40.  Depending on your fees/commissions/slippage might be a pass.

Looks like profit taking from bulls. Each test is substantially lower volume.
Best of luck... while we're still above the log line, I think it's "buy the dip" ... find a choice position and use conservative stops (I think $8800 is good here).

Personally I scalped $8880 and will wait for possible $8650 drop before getting back into a long.  This may never hit however. 
[removed]
One thing that worries me is that the time of accumulation is 1 year(2014) VS 1 week(2018)
Agreed that there's not much to worry about unless we break $8600 levels with conviction.  Great opportunity to accumulate here.
This interpretation is amazing. It explains whales' perspective very well imo.

Edit: why the downvotes :(
Because they are not equivalent.

Shorts are much riskier than longs in many ways.

First its the natural tendency to inflation.

Second it's the fact that the range of prices of any product it's between 0 and infinity. therefore the profit of a short its limited and the profit of a long its not.

Third its the fact that they are much easier to squeeze .As they don't require you to actually hold a position (which would mean buying, and thus moving the price up) . You can just buy a million, sell a million+profit and go away. 

fifth is the fact that there is a lot less people willing to short. I know it well, i can't trade shorts. I dont even try it.

You know, something that has been working for me lately, looking for oversold usdlongs and overbought usdshorts on rsi 4h . It should not work but it works 95% of times.
For that very same reason, very few people tend to enter a market when its shrinking to short it. Unless youre Soros.




I'm with you on the $6k call, my friend. I'm seeing manipulated moves in the order books, be turned on and off. It could get ugly in a week or two. 
If we hit 3K and it holds I'm going to liquadate my retirement accounts, sell everything, and become a hobo with nothing but a ledger. 
Gotta love how people pick time frames that are hard to disagree with and easy to forget.
He seems to flip flop between bullish and bearish pretty regularly.
Crap
I'm holding my underwater long for now. It's knocking on 9K and if we can regain it, that's pretty positive in my book. We're also sitting right on the 8-month log support line (probably irrelevant at this stage with the number of times we've crossed it).

https://www.tradingview.com/x/ijl1ZpWU/

Definitely watching this closely.

I opened a long about $50 south of here in anticipating breaking 9100. Closed at 9090 for a whopping 55 satoshi gain! 

But yeah, bulls need to step it up. I'll be sitting out again...
[deleted]
honestly you're better off ignoring TA and just using horizontal lines and strict risk management. Shorting at $9280 was asking to get stopped out. You either should have planned on adding more higher or holding through chop until we made a new high. Stops at $9500 was just asking for it :/

no TA is is going to tell you what's going to happen during chop- it's risk management and horizontal lines that stops you from getting chopped up. 

learn the complicated TA later (if ever), figure out risk management and really basic stuff at first

oh and learn to be patient- you will just consistently lose money otherwise 

if you want feedback, just post it here. 

--------

Someone asked what risk management was in a comment, here's a brief summary:

Risk management is about having a risk profile that you use for every trade you make. You have to know how much money you're willing to lose before you close a trade and how much potential reward is worth for putting that money on the line. How much money are you willing to put on the line for a potential gain? Is it a $10 loss for a potential $100 gain? $4,000 for $20,000? $50,000 for $1,000,000?

In essence, it's cutting your losses early, cutting weak wins early, and letting the strong winners ride.

Ideally, when trading, your trades will look something like...

+$1

-$1

-$1

+$1

+$1

-$1

-$1

-$1

+$10

You technically have more losses than wins but because you cut your losses early you didn't lose $5 or $6 or something instead of a measly $1. Your small wins equalized these small losses and then you're left with one fat big win. 

All of the trades you enter should be asymmetric in terms of risk/reward.

this risk/reward differs based on the length of your intended trade. If you want to scalp, opening at $9150 with an intent to close at $9300 or $9000 (if long/short) is fine if you're trying to ride a small pump/dump with incredibly tight stops like $50 below/above. Entering a short at $9150 if you plan on closing it in a day may not be the smartest idea. There's a large chance you'll get stopped out or have to post at a hefty loss in case you wait for a new local high.

On the other hand, if, say, you believe the bull run is back on, entering a low leverage long (with more fiat ready to go) isn't a bad idea. Say, you enter such a low leverage long that you wouldn't mind closing it at $6000 even. The risk/reward is a $3000/btc loss or a potential $11000+/btc gain (significantly more if we see a new ATH).

you want to enter each trade with this idea in mind. For me personally, when I entered my short, I posted that I was shorting at $9700 because the risk/reward favors going short. $9800 was strong resistance and I could easily close at $9900/$10000 in case the market kept pushing upwards. the downside was -$200/btc with an upside anywhere from +$600/btc to +$2000/btc since the market was definitely due for a pullback to at least low $9k and even possibly low $8/high $7k. 

Asymmetric trades combined with risk management and patience will net you consistent profits in the long run, but it takes discipline to follow your own rules. Develop a trading style and don't overcomplicate things- trading is much more about managing your emotions and sticking to your plan than it is about ichimoku clouds and elliot wave theory. 

Good risk management is *the only way* you will ever make consistent profits in the long run, otherwise your large wins will be cancelled out by equally large losses.
I'm sure if you posted up your reasoning here you'd get feedback whether you wanted it or not! From my limited experience this sub is mainly frequented by friendly and articulate posters so you're likely to get some good quality back. 

I haven't seen anyone ask for help and not get something helpful in return. 

Edit: should have known I'd get downvoted for this :D
use more capital, less leverage, and don't even use stops.  Call me a heretic.  No one here will agree with that though.

this is what I'm watching: https://www.tradingview.com/x/KfGkMoiW

there is also a small bull div on the 1h and 2h which is playing out right now
Maybe wait until it plays as support 
I'm in from under 8900, and the 4hr has scope for a bgd in about 3 hours. 
That said, I'm not comfortable at all with the macd on the daily, it screams correction. Stops moved just above my entry... Good luck!
Also check bbands on 1h, which haven't been narrower since 23 April, when it broke upwards (from almost the same price as today even). I think we'll choose a direction quite soon.
Isn’t that a bull div..? 
Lower highs but higher lows, depending on your time frame. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/9YLBMelI/

It does seem to be coiling up for a move of some sorts, though. 
I am seeing a bearflag on the 1h chart so we might dip to lower, 8.6-8.7 k ish
Why not just put a tight stop loss and let it ride?
Don't crucify me but... could it be that whales are simply buying time to get everyone to keep buying around the 9k range?
Since we’re on the topic of conspiracy whale theories...

I have one, and I’m thinking its possible that the people that are buying large amounts here (or any point of consolidation) are the same ones that are dumping when the buying shows any sign of exhaustion. 

100$ price jump with 400btc is 40k in profit. 
Your logic is off on the "they dare not touch it" part. They're whales who create the support/resistance levels, they'll touch whatever they want. They don't want us to break 8800 cuz it'll fuck up their plan in how they want the chart to look. 

We should be trying to figure out what that plan is and why they're defending 8800 so eagerly. 
I don't think you're understanding that a lot of the people you're referring to are gambling on micro movements using highly leveraged derivative products.  Those 'couple hundred dollar' movements can easily be +/- 100pct ROE.
Do you feel the same when it's overwhelming exuberance when the price goes up marginally? If not, then it's probably your own bias talking more than theirs. 
What are you talking about? Even going to 3k BTC which is as bad a prediction as I've seen here recently, is nothing like 'doom and gloom'. 3k BTC is still FINE in a 5 year picture. The fact you think any bearish sentiment is doom and gloom speaks to your own perspective.
You assume a lot.
> cataclysmic gloom and doom

Nice hyperbole.

Uhh its bearish so ppl are shorting. No doom and gloom here
I think most if the people just shitpost and enjoy the volatility and not reality mean it :p
which is exactly why most people are bearish.. There are soooo many weak hands here that need to be flushed out or battle hardened, at least. especially in the alt space. 

There is a very good reason why we need to see capitulation - it sets an extremely strong base of strong hands and gets rid of the weak hands that will panic sell at any sight of a correction. 
Id say based on the bands on the 12H and daily we are in for some consolidation and if bands starts sloping down, a big jump off the bulltrap cliff. 
Looks like it's ranging to me. Not sure how this position qualifies as a bull trap.

If it this is a confirmed bull trap we should see a lower low. If we're going into a bull trap then why are we in the bottom of the range?
If it's a specially abrupt move downwards... I'd be eyeing $8000 and $7600 as possible supports that the price would probably bounce off of.
The trend is your friend 
screaming and handwaving bullish divergence.

Bearish case? Market its shrinking. But it doesnt seem to be the case. 
Agree re BBands. Will be watching if we keep chopping a few days what happens when the middle gets up to where we are... You could almost view that as one large bull flag/pennant as well. Little ugly in the middle there but with a large formation like that it's somewhat acceptable.
I think you arrive a bit late to the barting party. penants that go against the trend and also break in the opposite direction its something that has been happening for a while nwo .
>If you make up the rules as you go the charts look like this

FTFY.

We get it, you're short. 
I noticed this too just yesterday, I was curious and would've written it off as meaningless if it didn't line up perfectly with the downtrend over the past 2 days but...it has. 
The log line is in the 7000s
Where is that chart from? The log scale is so neat! (even 1000's, not uneven numbers like tradingview)

EDIT: cryptowat.ch logscale?
Take a look at The Chart Guys on YouTube and Twitter. Focusing TA to Crypto with daily free videos plus paid courses if you want and a paid notification system, which I have not used.  They do videos on traditional and Canadian MJ as well. 
[yea](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/ETsf4M8H-Midterm-picture-looks-bearish/)
8800 is a key level here, imo. Seems like everyone is ignoring it, but this run up that went a bit nuts started somewhere around 8200-8400, then corrected down to 8600 after the 9700 top. A 8800 higher low lines up well candlestick-wise, and puts us in a good position for a continued sustained move up, similar in many ways to the move up from first dump to 6k up til the doubletop at 11k+. Not to mention the shorter timeframes going into oversold or near oversold on the last dump, oscillators looking ripe for a green flip, etc. 
It dipped the last 24 hours a few times < 9K. 

I've got a feeling that we are shaking the trees before we go 9.6+
Probably you didn't take into account the fees when you bought (long) and sold (exit long). 0.2% in each trade eats up your very small profit in percentage (0.63%). If you are positive that those were your entry point you should have 0.23% of profit minus the funding fees (which should be negligible but still...)

Shorting is when you have 0.01 BTC in your margin account and borrow say 1 BTC at 100x leverage and immediately sell that 1 BTC at say 9k and expect it to go down. If it goes down to 8.9k, you made 100 bucks cause you rebut that 1 BTC at a lower price and keep the difference (minus fees on each trade etc.). If it goes up to 9.1k and you shorted at 9k, you still have to give back this 1 BTC that you borrowed but since you sold it, now you have to give it back (assuming you want to close the position) by rebuying at a higher price, thus you've lost 100 bucks (plus fees).

Edit: also slippage could have eaten up some profit
I think your profit would have been eaten by fees and slippage.
epic trade - .0001 BTC = 90 cents?  lol


Just doing the math for you:

0.0001 BTC at 100x can buy you 0.01 BTC. Buying at 9520 and selling at 9580 nets you 60 dollars per BTC, so 60 dollars * 0.01 BTC gives you 0.60 dollars or 60 cents, or .000062 BTC.  
Lmao hubris is a bitch
so many whales missed the chance to unload after the sudden crash..  they gonna need to pump this a ton just to offload bags.. then the gox creditors gotta unload after they're all done unloading, lol.

Not until 9050 breaks with conviction 
I feel like that's not a common phrase
I don't understand this antagonism towards "bears". Are you lumping all sellers/profit takes in as bears?
you ain't seen nothing yet
Great odds that the correct trend is on there.

I'm still confident that my good friday - Ascension day analysis will prove correct.

noob, you cut the wicks?
Not looking too bullish.... We only broke through 3 descending lines on the last candle.
Some of those channels seem a bit off 
Why would you short based on a potential AE double top (if you want to call it that)? It's only a potential.
Under-appreciated comment. That's bloody poetry right there.
Isn't the Wave 5 way too long to really fit the Elliot Wave theory in your graph?
Also, this will be my last contribution/post here. Sick and tired of putting energy in and getting either downvoted to oblivion because a post isn't 100% bullish or getting banned for offering constructive debate that happened to mention an alt coin in passing.

Intellectually honest debate is fine. Tribal/childish voting and modding is a waste of everyone's time (including mine).

Good luck kids!

Edit : every time i read comments like these bitcoin pumps at least a bit. Its amazing.

Perhaps that relates more to recent moderator behavior, who have of late been very conscientiously taking the fun out of this sub, apparently as a result of a phlegmatic power blockage in the cerebral humors, as opposed to having anything to do with the coin.
 Not sure why you’re being downvoted. This is an accurate read on sentiment. 
Holding short from 9250 from yesterday, expecting to get to close a 8600-8700 in a hour ish as this bearflag comes to an end

extremely lol, can you at least explain why you're "extremely bearish"
It was shattered?
Sell for EUR (e.g. GDAX), withdraw into something like Revolut where you can exchange instantly, then transfer into your own bank account.
If your friend is just moving to fiat for a while before back to crypto then they can keep it in a GBP account on coinbase/gdax. But if they want to fully cash out, then the easiest route in the UK is probably Bittylicious. You're selling BTC to a broker though and their rates vary widely depending on what is being offered at the time. If you get lucky with the blockchain confirmations you can end up with the GBP in your UK bank account within 30 minutes - that's been my quickest transaction time. Although mostly the whole transaction will take about 2 hours. On rare occasions you can time it so their rate is better than coinbase. But most of the time there is a premium. As I type this they are offering £6444.44 for 1 BTC. Coinbase is at £6586.71. So that's a £142.27 or 2.16% "fee". That's about average. If you time it bad it can cost you 5% or even higher - that's normally during the night UK time when less brokers are online.
Coinfloor

Takes a while to get setup/authenticated but the prices have been fairly close to gdax in my experience.

Have sold through them before and withdrew to a UK bank in GBP and found the money in my bank 3 days later. They quote 1\-5 business days.

[https://www.coinfloor.co.uk/fees](https://www.coinfloor.co.uk/fees)

tl:dr;  0.0005 XBT withdrawal fee or £10 GBP withdrawal fee

You will have to sell into the current buyers and its fairly low liquidity. You won't be able to 'catch the top' too easily as it reacts slowly to large runs/drops in the market.
Use LBX.com it’s a british exchange, don’t have to deal in euros like these other ones
Your best bet is probably GDAX/Coinbase for GBP. 
Fineco + gdax or bitstamp sepa.
GDAX but last time I checked they don't support withdrawals to UK accounts.

The way most people do it is to have a Revolut account (free), cash out EUR from GDAX/Coinbase and send your EUR to Revolut, which you can then convert to GBP for free and send to your UK bank account. After getting verified (1-2 days) the withdrawal process can be done in a single day. I did this on Monday.
Buy and sell walls are used to spook other traders and bots. It's why the order book is a bad guide for trading. But good for sniffing out shennanigans.

A massive sell wall has to be backed up with real crypto. So if someone flashes a 300 btc sell wall it'll put people off buying and hold the price back. But if it starts to get eaten away it can get pulled as it's reason for being there didn't have an effect.

It can go really wrong though in that another whale might market order the other trader or it could be the only thing on the order books leading to a sharp rally up or crash down once pulled.

Gox is not a 'he'.   And no, the attorney appointed by the court did not come here and say he wasn't selling anymore.

The remaining Mt.Gox BTC will likely be given to the customers that originally lost their coins.

There are 24,000 mt.gox customers.
Got a source on that, I don't think it happened 
If he thought BTC and BCH were overvalued and Gox could benefit more from selling the coins now then why wouldn't he? 

He literally owes this community nothing from a legal standpoint. 
nah when gox sells the coins/pays out the victims then you'll see the REAL drop.  You won't need to be told.


Hopefully this sub never achieves consensus about a price forecast.
Would not open a long here. IMO Would have seen some bounce already if it was going to... looks like MMs have no interest in letting trapped longs out and want to unload some more bags here before further downside. Market sells outweigh market buys by atleast 2:1 in this consolidation range after the drop. 15m BB has pinched and 1hr ema will be coming down to these levels fairly soon. Expect movement in next 1-3 hours. 

Maybe set a stop short below these levels? 
2x i wanted to short the last times we were at 9400. Last time we went tp 8.7k and back to 9.4k. This time,i was ready to presa sell two days ago when we were at 8480. If i clicked sell that would have been the best entry of my life!

Generally, everything follows bitcoin. 

When Bitcoin runs, alt dump.

When Bitcoin dumps, alts pump 

When Bitcoin stabilizes for a few days, alts go fucking NUTS.
Example: on our first crash to 13k after ATH to 20k  when we sat there for I believe a week, that’s when the alt run bull market occurred. Alts went bonkers

Look man, been reading your posts today/yesterday and it seems like it would be good for you to take a step back from trading for a second and ignore your currently open position. Then really ask yourself *why* you think the market is going to do what you're thinking. Once you have all those reasons written down somewhere, doesn't even have to be here, ask yourself what actual hard evidence you have to support them. Like, actual data and not just "it feels this way" or "it's just obvious." If it really is "just obvious," you can probably show some quantitative measure of it so do that.

I think you *may* find your reasoning is somewhat irrational or, at the very least, entirely unprovable. In that case, I'd say you may want to consider how much you have on this and *maybe* consider derisking with a hedge or something. To be clear, this isn't investment advice and it's your money. Taking a step back and really doing some self analysis on your market view could help give you confidence you're right and we'll be going down. But just maybe it'd give you pause and make you revaluate your risk level. Just recommending you yourself taking a  closer look at your own viewpoint.

Edit: To be clear to anyone else reading this, this is just general advice for trading I try to follow too. It's always a good idea to take a step back sometimes and try to look at things objectively and consider what evidence you have, if any for all the things you're doing. I do the same and every now and then I find my position doesn't reflect how I objectively feel about the market.

That is pretty much a verbatim DushmanKush mannerism **and** your account is exactly the same age as his banned date. 

Try speaking a little less derisively if you want to not get caught for ban-evasion and reported to the admins.

Since it coincides with the mcafee dick line im ok with 9k for now. 
I would love for a stable btc at 9k. I want to hold alts but am fearful of btc dumping again.

Because Bitmex offers 100x leverage, a $1m buy wall could represent anything between $10,000 and $1,000,000. 

Most likely it's somewhere in the middle of that range, but regardless I wouldn't rely on $100,000 to $500,000 in buying pressure to keep the entire market above a certain value. 

And I certainly wouldn't rely on $10,000 for that. 
Do yourself a huge favor and learn to disregard order books for anything except determining slippage effect on a market order, especially on Bitmex.

Never ever trust walls. But even more so on bitmex.
There is no difference between a 1m$ wall and 1 cent wall on bitmex. That shit can change in a matter of second(not seconds)
Don’t put your money on the buy wall, it can be pulled in seconds.

Thank you. I should add that I moved my stop to 9000 to breakeven.

Edit: And I'm out. Bit finicky but don't want to risk any trade losses.Edit2: Aaaand I'm back in at 9000. Thank god for fee-less limits =)
That's why you use both. It's just different tools no magic predicting software 
Oh the magical lines that lead to no where aka "TA".
I agree but TA does work to some extent ,
at least it helps you to better asses probabilities I guess 
It's similar to poker ,counting  the odds and equity 

ta is virtually market sentiment. except it comes in a useful chart form.
Alts are starting to pump , feels like BTC is dragging the whole market down 
This is amazing! Who made this?
A hero that could have opened at 9300. Seems like you can hold almost any position open long enough to make a profit with BTC how it is.

It's been broken, it doesn't have as much meaning... unless we break down from it substantially or we bounce off it again. The descending channel from 12k crossing through it may indicate increased resistance in this price range. I think we'll move through it sideways and then break out.

The bullish hidden divergence is much more meaningful, IMO.

> Bullish Hidden Divergence occurs during a correction in an uptrend when the oscillator makes a higher high while the price action does not as it is in a correction or consolidation phase. This indicates that there is still strength in the uptrend and that the correction is merely profit taking rather than the emergence of strong selling and is thus unlikely to be last long. Thus, the uptrend can be expect to resume.

I saw the chart posted in here yesterday, anyone got it?
[removed]
It's quite possible we will bounce around between 8.6-9.8k for another couple of days or even weeks. I don't see a reason why that's not possible. I was lazy drawing the charts in my initial comment a few days back with just two bounces on 8.6 ;)
This is a really great explanation and answers the question I asked. Thanks for that. However it still doesn’t affect my outlook or that I think we’ll see $6k again.
What do you mean they're easy to squeeze and don't require you to take a position which affects price? If you take a short position then *somebody* is buying, which facilitates the short and presumably affects the price. What's the difference?
>Second it's the fact that the range of prices of any product it's between 0 and infinity. therefore the profit of a short its limited and the profit of a long its not.

Profits are determined by % change not absolute value.


a short interest over 10% is considered bearish in a normal stock.  The shorts are 60% of longs in bitcoin, lol.  It's ridiculously bearish sentiment, by wall street standards.  But by wall street standards bitcoin is ridiculous to begin with.


4800 and 3,000 would probably be the most juicy buy areas for many many years to come 
As any good trader would.
not too much wrong with that really 
Yeah I've been a big proponent of that line for quite awhile, but the number of times we've ghosted around it is starting to make me deemphasize it in my viewpoint.

Given that it's an 8 month support line it's pretty fair to give it a 2-3% zone of significance so you *could* frame it as even down at 8.8k we're still receiving support from it but that's a pretty big stretch. Especially considering it's not like its held 100% of the time either as we fell down through it decisively before, it's just a zone that gives some token support/resistance. And that support/resistance appears to be waning quite a bit.
Um... maybe? I'm very neutral on the market right now overall, mostly just viewing everything from ~8.8 (maybe even 8.6) to ~9.6 as chop. Not much the market could do here that would surprise me.

I realize that's super unhelpful but just being honest. Just wanted to point out something with an indicator that I hadn't seen mentioned yet.
dude what are you trading with 50 dollars? youre talking like you have all this capital, sitting out again lol. 
It would be extremely nice if we broke up and blasted through 9200, it would be beyond bullish. 

But breaking 9400-9600 range then retesting our new high of 9780 is where the real struggle for the bulls begin. 
I reckon this should be pinned somewhere lol. 

I've got a basic understanding of risk managment but i still havent started learning hardcore. Finish uni for the year in two weeks and i was hoping to spend the summer reading books and learning as much about trading as possible.

As for my questionable short, would you say that a stop around 9850 wouldve been better? local top was 9770 so breaking that confidently would invalidate my short theory.
Thanks for this awesome write up. 
bingo... stops get you stophunted.. and its happening a lot lately.. you have to adjust to the market - there was a candle that covered 15% range within 30 seconds 2 days ago.  Every stop was triggered.


Great piece of information!
useful post. I learned from this.
Thanks for the helpful reply (deleted my comment because I'd gotten myself confused. I realised I already pretty much knew what you were referring to in regards to risk management, as you'd made a post about it the other day)

No. Bull divs occur on local lows in price, bear divs on local highs.

Edit: there *was* a bull div preceding the hidden bear div though
Bull divs are taken from the bottoms. 

However, there was one, but I'm thinking the larger green candle after the second attempt to dump was a reaction to that bull div. 

Currently the hidden bear div hasn't had a major reaction. 
True, I was just eyeing the 1h chart. 

Good catch on that falling wedge by the way. I totally overlooked that.
Nice chart man
It's not really a bear flag. Proper flags have specific shapes and targets, and this one has been technically invalidated. Doesn't mean it won't dump still, though. 
[deleted]
That is a possibility too, yes. Nobody can possibly know :(

I'm just banking on the possibility of re-accumulation.. I think whales would want to pump it higher before dumping, esp. after they have invested BGD

EDIT: No risk no reward.. :(
That is not a conspiracy theory. That is a gambler's theory. Yes if you have 4M then "to make" 40K in any martingale gambling seems almost certain.

Yet people who have millions are exactly the people who do not do such a things.
Duly noted! You're right. But they also might not want to lose their coins due to regular shrimps buying BTC
Whales don't create support and resistance, the market does. Whales are not magical beings that can set the price exactly how they want or make the chart look exactly how they want. They are: 

a) Humans who make mistakes like everyone

b) Unsure whether there is a larger whale out there ready to fuck them

c) Just speculating like the rest of us


There is no single entity or group of entities that controls the price. Bitcoin is the free market and supply/demand unhindered by gov't regulation and exchange interference like circuit breakers and whatnot.

Sure, whales can do certain things like stop hunt when volume is low, spoof in order to create/influence sentiment, and even buy/sell into their own bids/asks to try and pump/dump. These activities might create short term price movements that are caused by that particular whale but they don't influence market trends and are usually isolated to whatever exchange the whale is on. 

Whales also make most of their money through low-risk activities like arbitrage and market making because they have a lot more to lose margin trading, they don't even need it b/c they are already exposed enough on spot.

Your entire comment is just wrong. There is no "plan", there is no "they" that control the price. The chart looks the way it does because of the collective fear and greed of millions of market participants across the globe. This sub's hard on for "whale manipulation" is getting fucking exhausting.
Who is this "they"? How are they all coordinating? Can you give us *any* kind of evidence "they" are coordinating since you're so sure that this is happening?
> We should be trying to figure out what that plan is and why they're defending 8800 so eagerly. 

Because if $8,800 falls, the chances are the market will have a big change in it's sentiment. We all know about daily pumps at 0700 UTC. So yeah, it took some time to get us up here. It won't take long to destruct whatever it is.
Oh I get that. And you just confirmed my point. They are gambling! Not investing. There's the difference. An investment should be rational and calculated. Gambling is primarily motivated by greed and desperation. Hence, putting in what they're objectively not capable of parting with. 
I do. No doubt. No difference between exuberance and pessimism. It's just that recently I've noticed that exuberant bills were far more quiet than the gobblins. After all, we just started coming out of bearville. I'm just calling for level headedness.
99% are not under a 5 year picture though. You put in 10k and you end up with 3k after 5 months is not FINE at all.
Dude, I don't know what you're smoking or what price you bought at ($100?) but if we go down to 3k I might actually kill myself. 3k would not be "FINE" at all. Fuck that shit.
You are the most delusional of them all. Do you think analysts would say a 70% drop in AMZN is not gloomy because it would still be FINE in a 5 year picture? That's not how markets work sonny.
And what is the trend?
Bull flags/pennants break down, bear break up vise versa. 

That’s the beauty of barting lol. I’ve been around since that’s been happening, and if history repeats we should see a break up from here

Agreed, much safer to wait for confirmation of a breakdown below the neckline at around $8,640.
Wave 5 going up? No, not at all. It's actually a near perfect 1:1 extension of wave 3 i.e. textbook. Fifth waves can go "extended" i.e. even longer but that isn't the case here. The only hard and fast wave length rule (for the three impulsive waves i.e. 1, 3 and 5) is that wave 3 is often the _longest_ but never the _shortest_.
i think you can mention a well known altcoin in the top 5 in passingbut if you just 'mention' some altcoin ICO that just came out thats an obvious shitcoin i'd downvote you.

was a great shorting opportunity.. after the next crash so many people will be out of bitcoin permanently it can finally start growing organically again.

Drop _to_ not drop _by_

If you think BTC is going to lose $6 or $7K in value... I'm not sure crypto would survive coming out the other side of that. The tech would but I guess the concept of coins/tokens having individual monetary value would have clearly failed at that point and mining would need to be incentivised differently.
yeah vc's really hate a promoter willing to do whatever it takes to beat the competition.

I'm not sure bear flag allows the flag to be higher than the starting pole. This seems to be more proper: [link](https://www.freeonlinetradingeducation.com/uploads/2/7/6/3/27639609/3081996_orig.jpg)
I don't want to be that guy who thinks rationally but what if everything is not a giant conspiracy against me?
Don't know for sure but it's inferred from where we are in the price action. Middle of nowhere. Here is where whales fight to incite fomo/panic. Retail buyers usually buy/sell during a move that a whale started. That's why we're called retail buyers. They buy in bulk and get in before a price move, sell to us at retail prices near the end of the move they started. 
Yeah I'm that guy. Trying not to be too conspiracytheoryyy but it hard!
So it's your fault that BTC is doing down?

This isn't really authoritative, whoever is buying the coins OTC can buy 1000 from Gox and then sell 1000 on Finex to move the market

No, I highly doubt that. That's not how these proceedings typically happen, particularly in Japan, from what I've read.

Yeah, but we'll be dropping from $50K at that point.

exactly and shitpost at biz the same time
yeah but that's too risky since the market is spiking so much. and if you try to take profit, the famous system overload will kill you anyway
What of large chunks of 2015-16? Alts went fooking bananas while BTC did effectively nothing for an age. 

Fortunes were lost and made if you'd been in alts while BTC might have made you + or - $10 in the same time. That might have been an anomaly but who knows?
Now, let's say you were short, and Jhonny big nuts here is also short, how confident would that make you feel that you're on the right side on the next trade? 
They are a bit unconventional sure, I kind  of like using a 'direction' line rather than a resistance / support line. If you want more conventional: [https://imgur.com/a/E0DBBNB](https://imgur.com/a/E0DBBNB)
You should probably lock up your coins then, because I'm not going anywhere.
We're still here. Sellers, come out, come out, wherever you are. End it or get out of the way.

Support in the $8800 range continues to hold. I'll check myself if $8000 breaks.
I'm not saying that they correlate, I'm saying that one event could have had a singular impact on the price of BTC at a specific point in time. does that make sense?

Look mandy7, it's not market is going to do what I am thinking, its more like, what market is doing makes me think.

Sorry I strongly disagree that my reasoning is irrational. If you think charts can only be good evidence, than pardon me, to be honest, I do not know how to draw one. 

Stepping back from trading? No, I have already made almost 100% gains this month, so I doubt I will follow that advise of yours.

> random nonsensical market dump

Might have something to do with it doubling in price in a week, but what do I know....
"We must". There are no musts here. However there are your buy orders at 7.8k that might not get filled.
We broke a few times 9K.... last 24 hours so we need to revisit 9.5 
We must revisit 7.8 for what? To see 6? I agree. To see 10? 12? No we don't NEED to. In fact, I'd argue that seeing sub 8.6 means we are far from 10/12. So no, breaking below the old ATH log line resistance turned support isn't necessary, in fact it would be detrimental to the bull case. 
I'm not confident enough about 9k either as I'm leaning more towards this being a DCB.

I was more impressed by the descending triangle completing. Not that I was brave enough to short though. I think I've been too scarred by the fear of BGC appearing out of nowhere.

Stop losses are optional, so this information has no use for stop hunting.

The info is already stated here by the users so it just makes it easier to check.
He misunderstood what was to use on the Stack %. Since its a new system it's normal that the first uses have some bumps.

Once (If) more people start using it it should be more stable and with accurate info.

I think the latest dithering is a good time to pause, put aside the charts and think about what factors play into the BTC price, look beyond "market sentiment", and positive/negative crypto news and study what other things are in play. I don't purport to know more than others about this, but I like the analyses I've seen some places that look at what route the money takes into BTC, from which exchanges, via which alt coins etc. Ultimately, we should try to nail down who the "whales" really are, if they exist. 
TA works because whales, hedge funds, and educated traders use it to estimate trading points. There are always extenuating factors but using TA to make trades is better than not. It’s simply a good weapon to have in your aresenal. 
The market moves money from the pockets of the foolish, to the pockets of the patient and informed. I love the ignorace of the those who dismiss TA as magic.
Magical lines told me to exit my position at 9.2k. 
I did it, you can use it on your own posts, don't need to comment on mine. Your last parameter is wrong, it's the Stack % used, ranging from zero to one. The way you put it you said you were using 125% of your stack :D

When i have all the code ready everyone starts with 100% stack and the system will update it based on the positions entered.

There will be a history page for each user so you can check past positions.
not a great short entry but it takes a lot of balls to short at the bottom with millions of dollars and hold it underwater all the way to 9500 despite all the moon kids everywhere screaming 10/11k.

I didn't communicate with you
That would make a lot of sense.. Only a week of accumulation in the 6k range didn't make much sense. I knew it was accumulation phase, but I had no idea the whales were going to pump it so soon
If you can't even answer those basic questions, how can you be fit to make price predictions?
6k? i give it a 5% . 7.2 , a 30% makes a good argument. Very strong horizontal historically .Very unlikely it breaks if there is no dramatic action. 

Sometimes its better to let go, though. Dont be like the idiots (me) that were expecting bitcoin to go back to 20k after falling to 14k.
Very simple. If i want to squeeze longs then i must buy before. Which pushes the price up and gives oportunities for longs to unload. 

For shorts, its different, its very easy if you have enough money to make them buy the top (from you) and sell it to them. 

Both are hard things to do that require inmense wealth and correct timing, but it has been done a large number of times already.
short has unlimited loss potential.. price can go from 1 to 100 you lose 100x.  Goes from 100 to 0, you just lose your stack.

so margin requirements are tougher, easier to get liquidated, easier to squeeze out.  Longs can just buy and hodl.  You don't even need margin to long, you can just long 1x with no margin, go afk for 10 years.  A short has to be actively maintained.



from 100 to 0 there is a 100% of difference . From 100 to infinite , infinite . 

See kids, use your profits for maths, not meths. 
"its bitcoin normal stock?" the answer is no .

The definition of a bear market its usually three trimesters closing in red .we had one that barely lasted one.
Not if nothing has changed.
I'm asking because I feel the same. I've no idea where this is going now. Not after the last few days. The only save is we were due a decent rebalance. Whether this was it or not....

Your most valuable knowledge will probably come from actual experience. Books will help though, especially ones about the psychology of trading (not the psychology of the markets- but of your own trading).

Yes, you probably should have shorted with the intent to close:

1. ideally in large profit
2. in small profit in case the dump is weak
3. at a moderate loss on a new local high or on a strong push past $9400-9500 
4. at a small loss from very tight stops

the possibility of #3 means you should have been on low leverage/with a small-ish position that you perhaps planned on adding to later. There is no reason to open a large position in the middle of a choppy range. It's asking to lose money or endure a stressful 2-3 days sitting underwater. 

The problem with your plan was the questionable stop area. I get closing a short on a strong push past $9500, but the push was weak and half-assed. If the market wanted to push past $9500 like it was ready to bust $9800 the fuck up, I would have gotten out of the way- but it just looked like some choppy waters and holding through it seemed like a better plan.

But closing at $95XX was asking to be stopped out because we seem to be in a symmetrical triangle with the range getting smaller and smaller. Your stops should either have been much smaller ($50-100) or ideally just at a new local high altogether. 
It does depend on your target, and is it 6000 or 8500? If the target was 8500, then a stop at 9850 would be poor R/R. Also, with two targets you can change your mind in the moment and not take profit at 8500
no problem :) glad you appreciated it!
fixed thanks
Still learning, thanks for clarifying 
So the lines would have to be drawn from the bottom. Sorry, thanks for clarification 
Thanks. I've got an underwater long, and the pennant, descending wedge, and the way 8800 held are about the only things keeping me optimistic on this. 
At what point do you FOMO back in if it starts to rise though?
You speak with such certainty. 

Surely you don’t know, just as I don’t. 

But you’re suggesting the people who buy 400btc on spot (the whole point of OP’s comment), hold through uncertain markets and don’t sell to scalp a profit when buying pressure is clearly becoming exhausted?

Makes no sense. 
This is an eye opener. Thanks for the comment. We all tend to get carried away, thinking whales are omnipotent beings :)

Accepting the presence of multiple whales makes it 2x harder to interpret whales' motives though :(
Just come back in a month after we've hit a major new low and look back on the charts and tell me they weren't planning it all along. 
You can just consider it Wyckoff's composite man 
Highly recommend reading Reminiscences of a Stock Operator. Or talking to a pro trader. 
Bitcoin, margin or not, is gambling. Speculating is gambling. It's a stretch to call it investing. 
If you're not leverage trading bitcoin or spot trading high dollar amounts, you really shouldn't be on /r/bitcoinmarkets. Hodlers have a space over at /r/bitcoin.
I'm all for level-headedness but we shouldn't discourage people from voicing a particular sentiment, so long as they express their reasons and their argument makes modest sense.
> It's just that recently I've noticed that exuberant bills were far more quiet than the gobblins

Wasn't the case before the retrace from 9700.
If you can't/don't know how to deal with a 70% correction you don't deserve the 2000% gains
Which is why it reflects on the OP more than whoever he is criticising.
Remember a few months ago the price was up near 20k and people were cashing out and buying houses etc? Who do you think actually paid for that?
Perspective is important is the point. I bought originally at 800 in Jan 2014, held through the low of 180 in 2015. So yea 3k is FINE to me, and looking back now losing more than 80% value on my money in 2015 was also FINE. Don't kill yourself.
It's not unprecedented. Reduce your position.
This isn't Amazon or some company with a product, staff, revenue and expenses. This is a crazy speculative digital asset that's very volatile. Maybe check your own delusions old chap.
Your friend
Sideways 
I tend to look at the last 30 days when there are relatively small movements. Served me well so far.
10K+ in 1 or 2 weeks
Thanks. Forgot to mention that I had never seen this perspective. Scary how 9700 and 9500 perfectly touch the line..
Ladder stops (someone correct me if I'm wrong) is when you start exiting a position (say a long trade) on the way up. Let's consider long from 9k, and the price starts moving up but you notice there is resistance at 9.5k, but we can't know if we'll touch that price. Instead of waiting for that perfect exit point, you set sell orders at 9.2k (30%), 9.3k (30%), 9.4k (30%) and the rest at 9.5k. That way, if it doesn't end up reaching your target price (9.5k) you've already exited part of your position in profit on the way up and reduce your risk. You obviously reduce your profit but proper capital management is essential when trading leverage, once you are out of capital there is no way to make anymore gains. But the more capital you have the bigger the positions, the bigger the profit.

And yea, your profits are smaller but the risk is reduced. Also, let's consider you have 1 BTC in your account, if you margin trade 0.1 BTC at 100x (so you traded 0.1x100=10BTC) and you keep the other 0.9 BTC. You are essentially trading you whole account at 10x cause you still have some BTC in your margin account.
You might want to wait for someone more experienced than me.  I've just always wanted to type 'fees and slippage'

I am sure there are massive amounts in difference between what people are trading with here.  It's all about the % and $/BTC


Tryout with whatever amount you would be comfortable losing, and try with low leverage, say 2x,  3x or 5x. Try to understand how it works and how big of a move would wipe out your account if the trade goes the wrong way. Basically with less leverage you are giving yourself some breathing space and time to react if a trade goes badly. If you are doing 100x and using your whole account then any 1% move in the wrong direction wipes you out.
Never mind the slippage until you are trading bigger sizes, the fees are percentage based.

0.0750% taker fee and -0.025% maker rebate. 0.15% for a trade if you just execute both orders against the book. It is important to try to get in and out on the bid/ask, especially if you are playing smaller moves.

Also, the fee is obviously tallied against your whole volume so you're effectively losing 0.75% on 10x and 7.5% on 100x to fees just opening a position.
Fair enough.
In Russia, you have the right to arm bears?
No do until you have an adequate baseline to see the trend, say, six months.

Losing hopium that these guys will get it down to my limit order, but one thing Bitcoin has taught me is that patience pays.
[Disney Channel not looking so good](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8g8t3p/disney_dis_earnings_on_58_elite_dd_says_short/)
You're very right chew but I've seen this theater act before. Shorting 10.8 on the second double top rejection was also premature and the next day we were sub 10k. 

I'm 90% sure this is one giant DCB so the r/r is there for me to execute. I'll be more than happy to double down above 9k up to 9.5 and ride a long if we break and hold 9.5. Should be easy to make it back if I'm wrong and we take a rocket to the moon. 
chewtoy what would it take to go long in this market.. I'm looking to get my money in good with leverage.  I closed my short because i cant really make  alot of $$ short.

We came up too fast from 6500 and then lost all volume.. I see little retail interest all whale/OTC guys and bots.  I gotta believe we pull back healthily at some point.. so any long is just some short term play (which i dont like - too much stress).





Ah that's bad reading from me then, ok thanks for the clarification
[removed]
It will be an absolutely beautiful moment that can't come soon enough. :P
That would be double or maybe triple the value of btc beginning of last year. Btc Going to 2-3k wouldnt be the end of crypto, far from it.
2500 would be a shock at first but there'd still be tons of users and it would grow organically from there after a very healthy and needed correction.  It would put it in more in line with the metcalfe's law valuations.. the real fundamentals.  Of course it'll probably overcorrect below that down to 500-1k in the ensuing panic.


He's unhinged and has a history of sheisty business practices. 
You're med term bullish?
[deleted]
Honestly thats a pretty good answer. I thought you were just screaming WHALES for someone to blame. 

I'm eyeballing the 4H time frame right now for our next breakout, hopefully to the upside but downside is possible. We're tightening up in this range, which has usually indicated a decent move in the past.
The forecast says it’s going to be very warm and sunny here tomorrow, prepare for the pump! 

Edit: more than that, it says that it’s going to be sunny for at least a week starting from today. A very rare event in Denmark.
Yeah true, I thought he just wanted to hold his fiat in GBP between trades. If cashing out externally then yeah fees are a killer. 
now you know why banks hate crypto.  They grab 10% for basically pressing a button.


Use Revolut to do the currency conversion.
What have you read specifically to indicate otherwise?   What do you believe will happen to the remaining btc?

Why wouldn't you? #sealambos
My money is on a whale left himself logged in and his cat walked across the keyboard. 
He won about -$900k probably 

Assuming his CA for a short was $9000 and he shorted 3k coins worth, he shorted about $27m. 

he closed and brought the order book all the way back up to $9.5k a few minutes later, so assuming his average close was $9300, he lost about 3000*$300= $900,000
Yes, I directed it at him. That doesn't mean it's bad advice in general either though. Trying to look at the market from a neutral position and find actual evidence for things is never a bad idea, even if you end up reinforcing how you feel.
I'm saying taking a step back from trading as in looking at the market from an objective standpoint rather than through the lens of your underwater short. You don't necessarily have to stop trading.

I know you strongly think your argument here is rational. I'd suggest you really think about that argument and ask what kind of data there is to prove it. Not saying that data isn't there, but just saying you should look for it. Maybe you'll come away seeing a slightly different picture where the market bouncing sooner is a very real possibility.

Being overconfident and thinking that you understand this market and have it on lock is going to get you rekt sooner or later. Maybe not this time, maybe we do go down and you close in profit, but it's going to happen.

You do you though.
>No, I have already made almost 100% gains this month, so I doubt I will follow that advise of yours.

Sort of flirting with gambler's fallacy there.

Yeah I could see you getting really irritated by that haha. I would've been annoyed as well. 

Dummies on bitmex short the bottom and long the top lmao
You’re like the anti chewtoy
At least tell me if you're in profit ;-)
Ahh ~  then disregard my comment as it does not apply to you.
People saying that we must revisit 7,8k are the first people who would short in that moment. This is becoming idiotic
Wait, you can see us? 
Some of those small birds in the sky are really far behind in terms of standard amenities.
dude... i get that, you misread my comment. i'm saying that last dead cat bounce we had in 2014-15ish before the decline to 250ish. if 2018 is another 2014 then we should all have seen this supposed deadcat bounce happen (i.e. 6.5k to 9.7k). nope, everyone was screaming for 4-5k BTC from the rooftops getting liquidated on their shorts and then bitching and moaning on the daily about how BTC is going to drop to 5k any day now. comparing the current market to 2014 is ridiculous, especially with the alt market eclipsing BTC by a large margin. there's a lot more variables for capital flow, not even that but institutional investors have never been as close to flooding into the market as they are today. fundamentals have never been stronger. sure maybe we'll see 4-5k and this is all a giant bull trap, i personally doubt it but the masturbatory comparisons to 2014 is annoying at best and misleading/fear-mongering at worst. 
Wallets and overall user-friendliness is a real barrier to adoption.

Yup, still holding my long. My stops are quite close to current price, but they haven't hit yet. 
I believe he’s long from 8780 and doesn’t plan to close unless we break $8,800. 

Don’t quote me on that, just going off memory 
the more you trade the more you realize order books mean nothing.  the amount of value on the order books is a small fraction of the daily volume.  Nearly all the buying and selling pressure isn't seen there or is gone in a flash.  Not to mention a lot of the trades you can see are spoofed.  I can't tell you how many times I've seen multiple pages of the orders disappear and watched the floor evaporate in an instant.  Trust the chart, ignore the order book.
Yup, and taking a break for today. Weak hands af.
TA is also abstracted crowd psychology
Perhaps it'd be useful to have an undo command as well. Well done on making this though! 

Interesting though, it seems I don't actually know what people refer to as 'stack' over here. I assumed 'stack' was the 'usual' amount one trades, in which case I'm trading a 25&#37; larger position than I usually do.
It's consistent with my read on our position. leveraged longs should be closing here and waiting to see if we break through resistance.
The resistance I'm drawing is entirely theoretical. We could be winding up (see BBands) to bust through nothing... in which case, hold on to your butt.

I'm forecasting that a breakout to a new local high is more likely.

Right. Just like the "line" was in the 11.6 to 11.8 area of resistance; same applies here.
My guess is as good as yours, man.

Edit: dawg
Could be the case. However I’m willing to continue to wait, even if it means that I’ve missed the boat for now. The fiat I have ready is an amount I’m OK with losing, even though I haven’t lost anything other than opportunity by waiting. Not a penny lost as I haven’t made any entry yet.

I was lucky enough to make a fairly early entry into ETH and am looking for a piece of BTC as the run up to $20k had me FOMOing hard.
Ah i see now. Interesting, thanks.
Gotcha, thanks.
sentiment not = market, during a reversal the market will usually oppose sentiment for a while.

In the grande scheme, sentiment towards bitcoin right now is still very bearish.


He doesn't flip flop though, he makes an analysis every once in a while. This latest one isn't even different from the last one, just a zoomed in version of his bearish case.
Flag could possibly be breaking down
Before i actually respond to the points you make, thank you so much. like, i genuinely have no one to talk to about this shit lol.

I agree that knowledge comes from experience. That’s why im mostly invested and if I trade, its with tiny positions that I don’t really care about losing. Not the greatest attitude for in depth learning but for now im treating at “controlled” gambling.

My list of books to read is getting longer and longer. Which is actually great, not read a single book in a good few years and my vocabulary took a massive hit so win-win.

Considering doing a masters in behavioural econ/finance or something along those lines but this would still be in a good couple of years.

As for the 9500 close, you’ve nailed it. I remember it hit 9520 at a retarded time in middle of the night. Alarm went off, woke up, looked at the chart and it hit my level. Looked at volume, saw it wasn’t there and thought about just holding it. But then I thought that I was just being an idiot and trying to rationalise not sticking to my plan. Ended up saying fuck this, closed that short and went back to bed.

Next day, did some googling and it turns out (which I should’ve known and deep down maybe even did) volume can be crucial. Felt like a bit of a mug but hey, it’s a lesson learnt.
touche, i was thinking about the stop side and completely forgot about the target side when making that previous post. literally the other side of the R:R calculation.

but this reminded me of literally what i did. set the target that i liked and then a stop that i found reasonable R:R. shouldve found target and what a good entry for that target would be instead of just market buying and setting a stop.

thanks for this. this is why i love you guys xxx
You're good man, glad I could help. 
how underwater is it? 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/wyuaWMsl/

If 9150 doesn't break I would suggest to bail, it's your symmetrical triangle vs this downtrend channel right now. 0.5 fib at +-8800 is a good support but if it breaks it seems like it's a one way ticket to 8.2k

I seem to speak with certainty because I am sharing my experience and mindset.

I know gamblers well and their mindset to "play it safe". It is a road to hell.

I know my mindset and I avoid situations like "easy scalps" as hell, because there is always a catch.

You make no sense because you pretend we are similar. Most likely, we are not.
...

I mean, I'm not denying manipulation exists as far as short term price action. Sure, some definitely try some schenanigans (that sometimes fail). Just saying I think you're sorely mistaken if you think all price action, especially medium term or longer, is coordinated. It's not. Yes, there's people with a lot of money in this market and you're a small fry compared to them, but that's the case with all decently large markets. And these people with a lot of money all have different ideas of where the market is headed and important price points and they trade accordingly. They aren't coordinating. For every buyer there's a seller and let me tell you it's not retail people putting up 100+ BTC walls that other whales are selling into.
r/bitcoinmarkets is 100 times less cancerous than any other crypto sub I've ever seen though tbh
This is a markets sub and has a diverse readership; positions range from $5 to $5M and can last 5 minutes or 5 years.
I've been here since 2013 and would be very well off even at 3k, that doesn't mean I'd think 3k would be FINE. In fact, I would see it as very concerning. I think most people in here would agree.
Thing is I don't want to come across as one of these 'get rich quick' buffoons

I am genuinely interested in how these market moves work



In Russia, Bear shoot you.
In some regions it is not prohibited 
I was making a joke about the chart posted above.
I'd argue you're comparing apples to oranges by comparing this "dead cat bounce" with previous ones. 

As is anyone who is convinced the market is still in the downtrend that contained the market between $20,000 and $6,000. 

The analogy I'd use is this:

"From December through March, every time the temperature has risen above 40 degrees Fahrenheit, it inevitably dropped back below 32 degrees and started to snow again. 

It's April now, and while it's a balmy 60 degrees now, it's obviously going to drop back below 32 degrees any day now. There's absolutely no way it could possibly get up as high as 70 degrees, and 80 degree weather is just an absurd notion. It should snow again in a few weeks at most."

That mindset worked great in the winter, but it's spring now folks. Time to change your outlook and stop calling for snow.
I know you asked chewie but [let me show you something real simple](https://www.tradingview.com/x/FdI3JDH7/). If you really belive BTC is not going to 0 and you want in at a good price then just wait for the 50% retrace of a bullish swing and go long.

Don't overthink it too much but always remember, ALL MARKETS RETRACE. Not today, not tomorrow but one day. If you are not in yet then don't expect a long you open now not to be underwater in the future. Why because we have not completed a 50% retrace yet. [This is our current bullish swing](https://www.tradingview.com/x/0qNk1wD6/) notice how at no point have we 50% retraced yet, now that might happen here or it might happen from 10600 or 13000, but at some point it will. 

**Set yourself a goal, "When the market has completed a 50% retrace I will buy and hold"**

This is when I plan to buy for the long term on higher leverage, until then I am waiting with my little remaining $ and unleveraged BTC. I might scalp here and there but it won't be a buy and forget until then. 
Chewy is long in this market. Like, right now, from 8770ish. The right time to long was when he longed (run up to 9800 followed by an 11% correction). Now we've had a lower high and a return to this level. 8770 is now a risky long entry to open fresh. At this point, I don't think I'd want to open a fresh long until >9500. 
[removed]
90% is not "healthy and needed".
haha it's one scenario I guess but personally, as a closet bull, I find sub $3K effectively impossible to believe. If BTC gets that low, the whole experiment has failed imho.
Talking about real fundamentals, at 2500 USD/BTC a miner using S9's would have to be paying less than 0.06USD/KW/H in order to turn a profit on electric used. If they were paying 0.01USD/KW/H they would make around 650 USD a year in profit. Not even enough to pay for one S9 (1373 USD + postage + tax atm).

Till your limits run out then its a joke
why?

So now the FUD moves onto the next guy.  Within the AMA it came out that no coins would be sold until at least September.  

Believe what you want.  'BTC is crashing, Gox is selling all his coins, 1k within the week' 
Didn’t their former customers get paid in fiat, at BTC’s 2014 price? All they did was to give them their original holdings back in fiat, not the original amount of bitcoins they held. Or are you referring to something else?
It's a random coincidence.

It seems the community doesn't approve of you adjusting your target after taking other opinions into consideration. 


No but posting here keeps me honest with myself.

Also, you're right, so maybe I should take down all of my helpful information such as how to do your tax calculations for your bitmex trades. Clearly not my blog so why should I share?
All good. I check sub whenever there's a dip as I'm looking for a good entry point for a small position.
No, I have cataracts only on Tuesday’s 
I agree that the times are completely different but you can't refute the fact that this has played out almost exactly like 2014, except less of a pop after cracking the downtrend line, which seems more bearish to me. Either way, all I said is that I wouldn't be surprised, I didn't make a call for one direction or the other, as I usually don't do that anyhow.
Yeah, thinking about a bunch of different projects that people might want to crowd fund. Going to make landing pages for each of the projects and let people fund what they want to see get done. A lightning wallet is one of the more bizarre ideas... but also the most practical.
are you planning to short if this bounce struggles to reach 9.1k?
Same here. 
Yup anyone who says "TA doesn't work for crypto" is more than a bit one dimensional in their thought processes
The stack is the the amount you have for trading (trading stack).
Imagine you have 1BTC for trading, that would be 100%.
If you enter a position using 0.5BTC, that is half your current stack, so you enter 0.5
With that, the leverage and the calculated PnL i can calculate how much you won / lost from your entire stack.
I use % because using values could retract people from using the system, with % it doesn't matter if you have 0.1BTC or 100BTC
[deleted]
I disagree; at least one of your predictions is more correct
look. I will give my regret minimizing advice. If you are prepared to invest and have the money ready. Invest now half (not necesarily this instant, just look for a good entry. Ilike when stoch rsi crosses or a number you like. Then you can invest the other half at your target. Or fomo in if it goes the other way. 

DCA is king.
Not what i meant. 

Bitcoin it's not normal stocks and should not be treated as such 
You *have* to lose in order to learn how to win, it's part of the game.

There will be times when it won't matter if there's volume accompanying the move because the risk/reward isn't worth it and there will be times where it definitely matters.

For me, I try to make sure my position size allows me to think logically and consider factors like volume and the strength and swiftness of the move. 

If your position size is too large, it won't matter- your risk is too high to think about it. this is why risk management is important! 

No problem btw, feel free to ask whatever. I'm pretty new to trading but think I have a decent grasp on it 
It's at 9130. I had the coherence/balls to add at 8920 and 8840, which may have saved my bacon. 
People are clearly placing 400 btc orders. What I’m saying is they’re going to sell when the market is exhausted. 

There’s no mindset. If they’re in the green and the price starts tanking they’re going to sell. 

Take your pseudo-elitist shit outa here. This is a trading sub. 

By your standards you shouldn’t even be here. There’s no trade you could possibly make that separates you from a “gambler” which you think makes you better than me or anyone else in the crypto space.

Bitcoin dumped from $1160 to $160 and it turned out okay. It dumped from $32 to $2. This bullrun started at $300, what is really so bad about it ending in a dump of despair to hit $3000? The market is a tool to screw over as many people as possible and we haven't seen that yet.
Too late. 
It was probably,funding rates, since at one point they were like 0.1-0.3% for longs.

Great analogy but is it really spring? Possibly, but i dont want to go out on a hike without taking a jacket with me. 
**Would it help if I said I snowed outside yesterday?** I agree with what you're saying, but i still have a bearish feeling about this breakout from our BGD at 6.7K and the fact that we just broke down from that trendline and havent fallen down below critical support means it could go down or up to possibly get rejected by the same trendline we just broke down from.

You would have to get the money to Paypal via a fiat gateway and suffer exchange rates all the same.

If you wanted it safely into fiat to hold with a view to rebuy you can convert to GBP within coinbase, you just can't withdraw it. Which is nuts when you think about it, may as well keep it there as Euros.

And coinbase is insured. So the money is 'kinda' safe.

Edit - What moron is downvoting me for being factual?
Because there are no fees and you get the interbank rate.
that was an opinion given in the AMA, which is very different to you claiming

I'm sure there have been worth. in that time frame, probably. 
He has good advice. I'm short from much higher and even I am preparing for it not to go much lower. 

If you are so positive it's going down, why not 10x short all in? 
Fair enough.
Because that relates to others and helps others. It's not just a masturbation session for yourself.
Wtf never asked you for any Bitmex related tax stuff. Stop being so self important...

Edit: please go ahead and take it down though. Bye Felicia 
idk, 2014 and 2018 are not that similar. the drop was much more dramatic and fast this time around, we did in 4 months what the market back then did in a year or so. not even that but the structure of the price movement for BTC in 2014-2015 vs 2018 are not that similar. the only similarities is that both had a massive downward trajectory. back in 2014 BTC had a MASSIVE dump from 900 to 150ish in days and then a sharp rebound to 600-700 or so, just for example.

i mean we'll see what happens in the next week or so. if BTC can maintain above 8.6k and a break above 10k, it'd be a pretty convincing case for an market reversal.  
I have no plans to short a bounce, but I might consider shorting a breakdown of the $8,800 area of interest.
Why have leverage and &#37; of stack? Why not just have single multiplier? It would normalize all the entries between individuals as well.

2x leverage 50&#37; stack is the same as 1x leverage 100&#37; stack.
A&E double top? 64% will break up at this point. That pattern requires confirmation. Otherwise, it's just squiggly lines. It's not an A&E double top, anyway. The pattern is too small.
Also, I got my vocabulary wrong. It's positive divergence, not hidden bullish divergence.
It is hard to answer your attitude. The thing I replied to was whether people who have 400 BTC scalp 40K in the way as it was described. I said: no. The ones that try it part the way with the money soon, but generally with this mindset they never make it there.

There is no elitism, just your projections. How you dare to tell people whether I can or can not be is crazy. Think about yourself, not about me or well.. do whatever you want, but yeah, that is really fucked up.

Definitely it is possible to make buys or sells that does not qualify as gambling. But scalping small profit generally is a gambling mindset. When it is combined with high amount it is always a red alert. On all markets. It is my experience. I am reporting your post as offensive.
The criteria for whether the trend has reversed is different for everybody. 

I use the rather aggressive milestone of a break above the descending log trend line on the 1w. 

Others would argue that there's not confirmation of a trend reversal until the market makes a new local high above $11,700. This is obviously the more conservative approach. 
It didn't s now outside yesterday though. 

The market has been rangebound between $8,800 and $9,700 for the past week, and it's still within that range. 

If the market makes a lower local low below $8,640, then I'll concede that there's some flurries. But for now it's still business as usual for the short-to-medium-term uptrend.
Glad you find it useful, there are many strategies for long term buying, this is only one. 

Make no mistake, what I have told you to do won't be easy. That 50% retrace might not come for a week, a month or a quarter and meanwhile the market may meander on upwards away from you. Resisting the FOMO will be **hard**. It will only be when you feel you can't hold out any longer it will come. If you manage it, and have that capital put aside ready when that dip comes you can enjoy the sea of red as you scoop up all the cheap coins during market capitulation.

The next part is also difficult, you have to believe really *believe* that while you might not of caught the very bottom and it keeps going down and down it does not matter. Your premise must be, "I belive this is not going to zero". Hold strong with firm hands the market will reward your patience.

Good luck man.
Set a 0.66x long buy order with 50% of the stack at 9000 and the rest at 3200. 
At this stage, if 7800 fell, we'd be back under the log downtrend line which would be very bad. 7800-8200 is a decent long-term target, but if you want leverage of any significance, it's still a bit risky.

Just given where the scene is going (in terms of global acceptance, interest from "old world" entities like banks etc, investment going in), the price big money is buying at, the static costs of mining etc.

A collapse below $3K would be pretty fucking brutal and at best retard the whole space by years.

Edit: I don't mean "wicking in to $2.9K", I mean dropping below $3K and staying there for months.
> they have huge infrastructure/sunk costs built up and won't shut down willingly.

Source? I find it hard to believe that any miner that's been in the industry for longer than 1 year would still be paying off sunk costs. 2017 was a good year to mine Bitcoin.

> At that point I'm betting you can get a sick S9 on ebay for your gaming set up DIRT cheap

Not sure if you are trolling or just running on 5 year old information.

what exit?
Do you really think Apple's earnings report and Bitcoin are correlated based on one data point?
So you want me to give you *only* stuff that helps?

That's called a job and you have to *pay* for that. Last time I checked, I'm not billing anyone for my help here.

So either shut up when I have posts like these or start sending me bitcoin for my services.
And I wasn't talking to you about that post I made but you sure as hell felt self important enough to bitch about it.

Don't like it? IGNORE MY COMMENTS DIPSHIT.
> if BTC can maintain above 8.6k and a break above 10k, it'd be a pretty convincing case for an market reversal.

Those seem like very arbitrary numbers. There's a lot more room for downside, given the technicals and I wouldn't even start to call a bull market until above 12K.
At this stage, wouldn't anything over 8650 still be considered a higher low? I would have expected <8600 to be the breakdown target?

I always use 5X leverage, so the conviction of my position can be seen by the stack %, others might use always 100% stack but with different leverages.
I agree that the end result is the same, but this helps understand how others trade, and that could be valuable information for other traders.

I think we need to put chewy outside and determine if he sees his shadow. 
ill just wait for 3200 then

Even that lame fund that shilled the other day calling bitcoin a 'screaming buy' was really just shilling for their pet project shitcoin ICO <name omitted>, co-opting the bitcoin brand.


sorry im old school used to mine with the 5830s didnt realize they switched

About 45 minutes north of me. 

I’m nearly in the city every week. Small world 
oh I don't know if they are or they aren't, but it wouldn't surprise me if there was some cause and effect. would that surprise you?
Feeling like a big man who thinks he can give out threats about taking down his precious comments. You’re triggered. I reached my goals. Into the shit bin with L14dy and dushmankush you go! 
The market is forming a potential bear flag on the 1h that would drop price to around $8,400 if it completes. 

If $8,800 falls, I'd consider hopping into a short...but it's not a 100% certainty that I'd open that position. I'll wait and see how the market reacts in the immediate aftermath.
You should expect it to not confirm when you see it, in that case. 64% of the time it will not do what you think you're seeing.
I'd be shocked if that executed, I just used that as a liquidation protector. Everyone has different "bottom" targets, but I still think $6K is a pretty solid floor. Time will tell though.

Lambertville here.

You can find correlation in anything. I wouldn't bet any amount of money on a correlation alone. 
>  Into the shit bin with L14dy and dushmankush you go!

Hey! that sounds like fun! Those guys are awesome. fuckharvey, l14dy and dushman? that's a damn party. might be too much personality in one room though
Makes sense. I assume this might fall under the category of "normally would wait for the breakdown but I'd probably get 8480 because BitMEX needs more hampsters to power their servers"?
I'd be more shocked by the 20x run up in '17 than a 6x decline in '18.  Nice triple.  Most coins were mined by the time the price hit 1000, so lots of people happy with salvaging a triple.

You should play the lottery with some numbers that are associated with them.

Apartment number or something

It really is bordering on absurdity. 

Even a modest move renders the site completely unusable. 
I don't measure my gains in dinosaur money. The only reason I trade is to eke out more Bitcoin.
Yeah it's awesome. Jersey is underrated!
