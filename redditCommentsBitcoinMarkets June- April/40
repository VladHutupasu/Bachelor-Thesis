[Daily Discussion] Tuesday, April 24, 2018 -- TITLE
#New post: [\[Daily Discussion\] Wednesday, April 25, 2018 →](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8eqr52/daily_discussion_wednesday_april_25_2018/)
4/24/18 UPDATE. We spent 48 hours moving sideways then BGD’d through $9,000. In my [last update on 4/21/18](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8dtgp5/daily_discussion_saturday_april_21_2018/dxrb3pg/), I provided four scenarios and it appears we’ve followed the more bullish of the two, “Bull Case” then “Uber Bull Case.” In a [follow up post on 4/21/18](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8dtgp5/daily_discussion_saturday_april_21_2018/dxrcluc/), I estimated we would spend ~48 hours sideways before moving towards the upper end of the “Bull Case” range. It appears we’ve followed that trajectory pretty closely. My estimation was based on the market needing to cool off before continuing decisive, upward movement. Having said that, while I added a bit to my existing BTC long position over the past 24 hours, I was hoping to have more time to accumulate before the BGD appeared. If I don’t post in the next 48 hours, I will likely be looking for a low entry point 24-36 hours from now (Tuesday late night/Wednesday early morning Pacific Time).

In terms of chart updates, I’ve kept the bright green line to indicate the immediate channel, which we dropped out of but are now firmly back in. I’ve also added a bottom black line to indicate the support of the broader channel. Finally, I’ve added three lines of resistance in yellow. The brightest yellow is the easiest line of resistance; the darkest yellow is the hardest line. These three lines are determined from key tops within the downward channel. Additionally, I’ve extended the upper black line to help define where the broader channel is likely heading. The now-old lower support line and the two more bearish scenario arrows from 4/21/18 are in grey. I have removed the aqua line entirely.

Here’s the [zoomed out, macro view](https://www.tradingview.com/x/HEWEwl5X/).     
Here’s the [new, broader channel](https://www.tradingview.com/x/sUQCzyQ7/).     
Here’s the [super zoomed in view](https://www.tradingview.com/x/iVX0hzoq/).     

It is my estimate that we stay range bound between the two black lines over the next several days. If we stay within that range, it likely means we are looking at a price target in the $9,450-$9,800 range by the end of this week. It also means we are truly shaking loose the bear market and that we are on a positive trajectory. However, it is possible we continue our march upward towards $10,000, which is then accompanied by some serious sideways moment as we test the first yellow resistance line. We’ve gone from $6,425 to $9,250 (43%) in a span of 23 days. At this level, I view small sessions of sideways movement as healthy because it helps build a floor in case we pull back. Over the coming weeks, we will have three levels (the yellow lines) to breach. Yellow 1’s range: $10,050-$10,200. Yellow 2’s range: $10,650-10,900. Yellow 3’s range: $11,250-$10,900. (These ranges are of course dependent on where we cross these lines of resistance.) If we can break through the darkest resistance, Yellow 3, I believe the financial MSM (CNBC, Bloomberg, CNN Money, Yahoo Finance, etc.) will begin running stories about Bitcoin’s return and the market will possibly see renewed interest from retail investors. During the next week, I’ll be keeping an eye on volume to ensure our upward movements continue with sustained strength. I will also be more closely watching which exchanges are driving that upward volume.

On a final note, I commented back on [3/16/18](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/84r36x/real_recovery_will_be_signaled_by_altcoins/dvrrjzu/) that the next market rally could possibly be kickstarted by altcoins. While I believe BTC is the true driver of the crypto market, it’s undeniable that the alts have rallied unlike their performance in the DCBs. What do people make of this? Is this truly a new flow of fiat into crypto? Is this tether? Is this just a symptom of a natural market recovery? I have a theory which I will post when I have more time, but would like to hear some other opinions as well. (I’ll give you a hint: My theory primarily deals with the increased regulatory scrutiny the entire crypto market has received over the past six months and the likelihood that far fewer scam ICOs are occurring, which means there are fewer fraudulent “developers” dumping ETH/BTC, which means there’s less of a sustained, downward pressure on the market.)

If anyone wants to discuss [altcoin markets or altcoin portfolio composition] (https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8e8qpw/altcoin_discussion_monday_april_23_2018/dxtbu12/), I started a thread here last night.
Point and Figure https://i.imgur.com/uUcSW4D.png  We are in a column of 8 X's.  No long pole warning.  Next major horizontal resistance level is at 11.7k.  Our current range is between 7.7k-11.7k.  Today we broke through a horizontal level at 9.2k, very nice for bulls!

Out of the 40 long poles this year, there are only 2 unresolved long poles.  From April 13, we must retrace to at least 7,473 to resolve a long pole of X's.  From April 21, we must retrace below 8,505 to resolve a long pole of X's.

I'm going to dedicate the rest of this post to discussion about two types of horizontal levels: Weekly Levels, and Yesterday Open, Close, High, Low.  Horizontal levels are very important.  For fun, I thought this meme summed it up nicely: https://twitter.com/joyrider50/status/988834188437504000

Weekly Levels https://www.tradingview.com/x/Y83nRK66/  Lets take a look at our weekly levels.  Here I have drawn lines coming off of every weekly wick.  Each line is essentially a weak weekly level.  Weekly levels can act as support or resistance, especially when there is confluence between it and other indicators.  Over the last 3 months we have build a lot of weekly support levels between 6k and 10k.

There are different ways to interpret weekly levels but this is how I do it:  Those wicks that are in close proximity to each other and to weekly closes are grouped and a grey box is drawn.  As a rule of thumb for BTC, I typically create groups where at least 2 wicks are within 1% of each other in price.  This works for BTC because of its volatility and strong trend but should be adjusted for other assets.  More lines are added to the first 2 as long as they follow the concept of 3 wicks within 3% of each other, 4 wicks within 4% of each other, etc.  The more wicks and closes at a level, the more recent, and the more tightly condensed, the stronger the level.

Yesterday Open, Close, High, Low https://www.tradingview.com/script/UVIkiRbM-Yesterday-Line-Lines-at-Yesterday-s-Open-Close-High-and-Low/  This is a simple script that draws you lines from yesterday high low open and close.  I just made it today so it might need some fine tuning tomorrow, but I am very excited about not having to draw these lines on every chart every day (or worse, forgetting to draw them!).  When trading on lower time frame, keeping in mind yesterday's major horizontal levels is very important.

I'm laughing over here. Sorry for low effort post.
We've been in uncharted territories for a while with barts, marges, trendlines the market didn't give a fuck about, bearflags breaking up, bullflags with ascending flags, shrug. 

Now bearish divs don't play out, rsi is burning but keeps going, and people are still redrawing constantly trying to fit candles in wedges, triangles and whatnot. 

It's very human to try to organize this mess but honestly, I think we should forget it. 

Zoom out to the 1D, use your favourite ichimoku or/and fib retracements and trade based on that, keeping in mind that sentiment is everything and the chart reflects it, not the other way around.

Good luck in the wild wild west.
Contrarian take: if everyone is expecting a pullback, it’s not gonna happen.
I've created a spreadsheet to figure out an estimate of FIAT-based volume for BITCOIN. Taken from each Exchange and their various trading pairs (BTC/FIAT). I've converted non-USD fiat into USD equivalent value.

The purpose of this experiment is to get a better idea of actual fiat volumes for Bitcoin. And to identify and reveal just how much actual cash is moving in this market, and to not get deceived by bloated volumes through alt / USDT trading. This data was taken today and is all I have to go off of for now. I realize this is a small data sample, I just wanted to get a better idea of how much fiat is being traded today, and wish to share this with you all.

Do with this data whatever you will. I will remain not biased/opinionated and want YOU to create discussion.

**~Spreadsheet~**

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Qe2B3vYsxz1ftDRxUdD9qyFymFydzk-lOnODMqvR450/edit?usp=sharing

**~Interesting Results For Today~**

* Fiat trading pairs for Bitcoin is at $1,677,208,979.

* 17.47% of today's BTC volume is through fiat trading pairs.

* 5.09% of today's overall Crypto volume is through Bitcoin fiat trading pairs.

* Fiat trading pairs accounts for 1.04% of Bitcoin's market cap.

**~Notes~**

* I've only recorded fiat volume for Bitcoin. I have not recorded ALT/FIAT data.

* I have excluded USDT and Bitfinex pairs from the equation.

* This is a very new data set taken just today, I haven't tracked previous days fiat-based volumes. I will be looking to automate this process and record future fiat volumes daily and compare them with the rest of the volumes for crypto.

* I recorded each fiat pair from Bitcoin's ranked volume list thanks to coinmarketcap.com from rank #1-300. There will be some illiquid trading pairs from smaller exchanges not recorded. When I automate this process, I would be looking to include ALL fiat trading pairs.

* Later on down the line I'll be looking to ALSO record ALT/FIAT trading pairs on established alts. That data will be presented in the alt daily thread.

* My data-set unfortunately doesn't measure for wash trading.

* Do let me know how I can improve this. Such as adding more data, more exchanges, more trading pairs, etc. Any constructive criticism is welcome!

**~Special Thanks~**

* Thank you [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com/) and your public data for making this experiment possible.
Hmm..what’s there to say really.. 

If we reach $50k by the end of this year, I’ll fly this whole God damn sub and @ParabolicTrav’s wife to Curaçao for tropical, tiny-umbrella laden drinks. 
That is all. 

~Carry on.

Anyone else not in position right now? Feels too late to open a long but also sucks to miss out on all the fun with the rest of you. I'm also not as certain as some that we are close to getting hit with a BRD simply based on how strong the alts are performing right now. 

There is massive volume on BCH and ETH fiat pairs recently. A lot of money is entering the market again, maybe just not so much into BTC but BTC definitely gets a boost from it. 
Binance appears to be heavily leading this latest retrace with BFX trying to keep it from falling. Overall, double top on short time frames trying to confirm (now basically confirmed) with a bear div on the hourly and multiple bear divs on the 15 min. Hate short time frames but with this volatility looking at them is somewhat justifiable.

Daily hidden bear div still in progress of forming.

This is speculative but given the alt ratios dumping this could be alt profits fleeing to fiat. The fact that binance is leading gives that some credibility, better to discuss that theory in the alt thread though I suppose.
At the risk of shitposting.

I would like to christen the sub:

The WallStreet of Crypto

With the new altcoin daily and pure excellence that I’ve seen the pst 2 days, I’m honestly just very impressed and humbled to have you guys be a part of my life.
So I posted earlier about how the gigantic wedge we're in breaking down doesn't necessarily mean we're going to fall all that far. Here's a few examples from 2017 where we were in a large wedge, "broke down," encountered some strong support, and continued the rise.

In order of Jan 2017, March 2017, and Sept 2017: https://imgur.com/a/O7Pbdp1

I only spent a small amount of time looking for these and they could probably be charted better, but I think it's decent evidence that there's precedence for BTC to pretty much ignore wedge breakdowns in a bull trend other than a small drop on the breakdown. There's probably plenty more examples on smaller time frames or further back in history but bitcoinwisdom is annoying about how far back you can go and I didn't feel like using tradingview.

Edit: Or, I mean, it could just break up...

Futures are *still* negative and open swaps are *still* rising.

You can literally borrow as much bitcoin as you want *for free*. This makes *zero* sense.

The only way this makes any sense is people are literally buying coins with the intent of *never* selling them. They're effectively throwing their money away and losing the coins.
Dam do I love a bull run right before I need to pay my taxes. Thank you Canada for an April 30th deadline. 
We've now seen another 5% climb from when I posted yesterday morning. The bear in me has slunk into hibernation for now. I was in and out of positions a few times yesterday, and finally ended up going long 3x with 50% of the stack at 8850 on June futures. I added a little at 8900 when I saw the alts pumping (e.g. what I posted I was watching for yesterday), and I added the remainder of the stack with the slight pullback off last night's BGC around 9160. My stack is 100% in 3x at 8975. Last night I set stops at break-even, but I just changed to a $150 trailing stop.

My initial target in my post yesterday was 9200, which is where my stop will execute now. If we climb to 9400, I will adjust to a $200 trailing stop. I'm not looking to get forced out of this position prematurely. 

Now, as far as TA goes, we are still in an ascending wedge of sorts. This formation is massive, so there's tons of room inside it. We formed an ascending triangle inside it (also spotted by /u/mandy7), which broke up violently last night. We're still climbing this morning, and a true invalidation of the wedge would come above 9600 today. This wedge pokes the hibernating bear in me. I'm looking at a 45% rise in BTC with no major retrace. This *shouldn't* be happening, but it is. This feels different than the previous DCBs, and not just because this one broke the ATH downtrend log line. I'm not at all confident we'll break down from this wedge, and I'm not shorting it. I am, however, ready to bail on my margin long if it looks like we are. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/2vJZT2Hq/

Alts, specifically ETH and BCH, are going absolutely bonkers. BCH is up nearly 2.5x from 2 weeks ago. ETH is almost 2x, broke through its downtrend ATH log line, and just broke $700. BTC is playing catchup here, and I think as long as we continue to see the major alts pump way above their standard ratio, we'll see BTC follow once those ratios exceed norms.

We're not quite to blow off top territory yet, but we're getting dangerously close without a cooldown/consolidation period. My biggest concern is that the longer we extend this rally, the worse that drop will be. A retest of the log line as support off the break up to 8900 would have been prime. Instead, we're blasting into uncharted territory (literally), and what should have been a 5% drop to retest is now a 10% drop to retest. The bigger the drop, the more momentum, and that's worrisome. 

Hence: $150 trailing stop.

I don't currently have a stop on my Sept futures long from 6410. I really hope I can hold this one to 12.8K (I never thought I'd get to hold it through a doubling). I'll probably finally close it if 9K breaks though. 

Good luck all. 
Went long just above double 1d kijun break at 9225. First time we crossed it with _some_ decisiveness since it broke down at 14k.

We’re also piercing the double 1d cloud now. And although we’re way over stretched at the moment, it’s not uncommon to do an edge-to edge in these scenarios, which would have a target of 12.8k. But we’ll definitely correct a bit on the way there. 11.7k will be a battleground.

Stops below 8.8k.

Edit: Of course, plenty more battlegrounds before 11.7k as well.
https://www.tradingview.com/x/SvfKARrV/

This last leg up took us from the ascending wedge support line to just above its resistance.

We had rounded bottoms at 12000 and 11000 followed by a rally and then downwards again. 

Now another rounded bottom at 6500, a rally and then...

We've rallied up to the 0.236 fib level (but we've been rejected hard at every fib level on the way down since ATH.

Why will this time be different?

I'll feel more confident of a reversal if we get rejected now, followed by a higher low and a higher high.

EDIT: And bearish divergence on hourly RSI
I think another short squeeze is imminent. They are underwater for a long time. Price increased 1.5k and shorts didn't decreased much. 
We're clearing but as of yet not decisively the conversion line resistance on the weekly but with the kijun target way up in the stratosphere at 12.5k (for contrast the cloud base is 3.5k), but, boy, is that kumo shoulder looking like a nice midway point in a parabolic rise.

1w: https://www.tradingview.com/x/Nq44BJHc

The daily is breaking above the cloud, although the chikou has both kijun and kumo to cross before I'll get excited about the weekly outlook. There's a decisive move nevertheless and the long flat kumo upper edge will make strong support in the event of a pullback. Breaking that support however and exiting the cloud south before it flips green will be less fun for the bulls given the bearish breakout *entry point* of 7.5k.

1d: https://www.tradingview.com/x/y4aeTZvl

Here's the 3d from Bitmex (irritating I know), which shows the possible upper limits to the daily movement. Chikou has never really confirmed the bearish scenario here, and may not although I think talk of 14k in the next month and a half should be qualified. There's a break through the price line tho' which is a neutral bullish signal here. The other bullish signals are weak, however, and no sign of a TK cross yet, so supportive of a limited upside movement at this stage. I think the climb to the window is too steep and the window itself too narrow, so upside target would be the underbelly of the red cloud just under 11k.

3d: https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZvLMTaqC


They say "In a bear market, short the local tops" as a rule, which is a principle nobody would argue against. However, many people who trade professionally would know that that statement is quite like "If people would stop harming each other and be respectful there would be peace in the world" - trivially true, but almost useless. We all know that in practice a local top always feels like a market reversal than a real local top. So people rarely are brave enough to close their longs (which would be immensely profitable if it's a real reversal) and suddenly take a position against the trend and the general sentiment.

By the way the above has nothing to do with the current situation in BTC markets. It's just a general observation.
Someone please throw some counter points my way. I'm cautiously bullish and thinking perhaps this may be a real trend reversal for these reasons:

-On-balance volume is way up and still rising.
-MACD is consistently above 0 for the past several days
-Moving averages are angled up
-RSI is high, but not ridiculously, and it's holding fairly steady
-We seem to have broken out from the downward trend line
-Inverse head and shoulders?

Disclaimer: I have no clue what I'm talking about


Futures are now under spot while swaps are above spot. Please someone explain to me how this is possible...
I looked back at old 15m charts for $11.7k tops and both times there were several attempts at $11750 ish (2-3 each time) before heading down. it wasn't a blow off top. (on shorter time frames that is) 

So I'm opening a short here and holding it until $10-10.2 is decisively violated. it's a small position, most of it is just a hedge, but I'm worrying what will happen when someone with a large position decides to get out and the selling cascade begins. 

I'm sitting in fear of a BGD but I've started to realize that when I become fearful (of more upwards movement) is usually when the market begins to turn around. 

Worst thing that could happen for bears/shorts is to go sideways for more than a few hours. If that happens, I'll reconsider 

For people bordering on euphoria: slap yourself and realize it doesn't go up forever. Yes it could continue going up. But keep your wits about you. **These are the moments you need to stay vigilant and disciplined.**

Stay safe and good luck, brothers and sisters! This is the shit we all missed!!! Woo-hoo! 

Entry: $9614 on finex, $9652 on bitmex (wtf swaps)

edit: limit sell for futs added at $9680 on xbtm. 
So the long position I opened at 9100 on March 21st is now actually in profit.

As I said some time ago: Chad never makes losing trades - Chad holds positions until they become green.
Closed my long from 8.7. 53% profit on this trade, about 10% up on my total stack.

Still extremely bullish so might reopen the position again later
Closed my long from 8.9 at 9.3 - conservative, I know but I needed to lock in some profits after losing over 50% of my stack the past few weeks through sheer stupidity. Once again, the buying pressure is surprising me. Very unsure what to do now. Don't want to miss a potential run to 9.8 but can't afford any losses right now either. 
Closed my long for a gain of 5.15%. ( @ 9341 ) 

I gained about 45% of my losses back from this past week. 

Went from making my first ever  11 trades ( all green) to a series of terrible trades all in the red. 

Probably should have held the position considering I had a great entry, but it sure does feel good to lock profits! 
Wow this buying is crazy. Even a 100-200$ dip down is just bought up and no/rarely any stop loss cascade down. Just a few minutes down and then buys hit again. This we haven't seen on the spot price markets for a long while

Longing June futures from 9350, when BTC want to push through stuff like 9400 it will
Any pullback in sight? I’m feeling the fomo bad
Daily volume is way up.  It's reassuring to see volume accompanying this rise.
Daily stoch RSI recrossed in the overbought yesterday (two days ago?) and stayed crossed. While the last time it happened was a fakeout, would certainly line up with our other indicators that a pullback is due
Still have my long from 8900.  But it's not what it seems, I've refilled it as its ladder has taken profits, actually closed already 125% of the original cost.  The long's current cost is the same as the original, and ca is now 9300.  So a bunch of scalping.  

SL break even considering I already basically have already taken all the original profit out of it.  Profit taking ladder resumes around 9700 and goes to about 10200. It is tempting to close though.

Also one order filled on a short at 9700 (I added them back).  It's only 5% of trading stack though so meh.
[deleted]
I'm on the sidelines until we get some clearer signals here. Taking any position right now makes me feel uneasy.  
feels like a shakeout. no free rides to 10k. bought the dip
I'm not sure why people are complaining about the low volume. We've seen a 80% decline over the past months, the market is naturally worn down.

And in addition, if the inverted head/shoulder and the Adam/Eve double bottom are to be real, the volume should decline throughout the pattern, which is exactly what's happening: https://www.tradingview.com/x/QN7q6K6D/

Although the market have been acting a bit abnormal with these large green candles recently, this is Bitcoin with generally low liquidity. It makes sense for big players to enter at the bottom. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm not turning to a permanent bull here, I'm still 50% fiat. I'm just saying that nothing so far has been very unexpected with price action and volume so far.

Edit: typos
I can't bear to watch it. I closed my short around 6700 and have been totally out for about two weeks, watching in disbelief. I know that the second I buy back in, it will collapse. But this is hard to resist the FOMO. 
[deleted]
If anything I think Tom Lee's hypothesis that tax selling was keeping the price down was mostly correct. The slow rise of the price now is just the normal market movement where the number of buyers > number of sellers. As long as there is no major fud I think the price will continue to slowly rise.
Ok so I have been overtrading this quite a lot, and I have been losing money in this bull run because I didn't trust my gut. But fuck it, this thing won't stop. I still think there will be a retrace, so i'm putting layered long positions from 9100 to 8850. Stops below 8.4. If i lose some money, so be it, but I won't play around with my position again. I think i'll go play with the alts, it's less traumatizing. 


I closed my long position last night at $9220 for a decent profit. I think we need at least a small retrace before another leg up.

[Right now I think we'll see price move to the bottom of the wedge.  We'll either bounce with a move to $9600-$9800, or if we drop under, I'll look for $8500 as support.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/X3AMFxvQ/)

Not shorting anything now... I will if we hit $10k on this run.
Back in to my 3x long 50% at 9290. (my exit point).

I'll set the other 50% down at 9210 with stops at 9140. Considering I exited $100 above my initial target (9200), I'm okay with giving that up here. If we near 9400, I'll probably move stops up to beak-even. 9400 was an obvious profit-taking point, but the drop was bought ferociously. I'm not sure this thing is done yet. 
I added the rest in at 9365. 100% in 3x long at 9330 average now. Stops at 9310. This is a continuation of sorts from my 3x 100% in long from 8975 that got training stopped at 9290 this morning. This has a BGC feel to it, and if we break down, my previous entry (9290) probably would have been stopped out anyway. These are all June futures numbers. As /u/SloppySynapses told me, sometimes it's better to be aggressive at the beginning of a trade than the end. 

I don't recommend opening a fresh long at anything >9330, and not even really there.

Maybe the OTC markets are actually drying up as rumored and coins are starting to have to be sourced through exchanges.  Bitcoin has never really known a buy-side liquidity crunch.  One of these days it is going to become glaringly clear just how small of a number 21 million is.  
  
The mother of all bubbles is still in front of us.

GDAX on my Screen - Hans Zimmer Live on Netflix - great combination :D
That buying power... Also almost no big sells going on. Bears hiding in the woods, while bulls are on a stampede run.
[CME futures](https://www.tradingview.com/x/BtzXPyIo/) volume increasing steadily, a really good sign.
Long margin has steadily *decreased* and shorts have steadily *increased* over the past few hours: https://imgur.com/a/671X1wf

Make of that what you will... 
And now we are chewing into sell walls with little hesitation, just in time for news to talk about bitcoin being over 10k in a few days at most...
Um...why are bitmex futures and swaps price over 1% higher than the spot?
Wall street friend of my two years ago: Bitcoin is a scam, don't fall for it dude. It's going to fall because x, y, and z. 

Me: Bro, it's changing the world. I just HODL. I believe.  

Friend: Hahaha, dude, you have no idea what you're doing. 


-----Two years later------
Friend: Yo. What coins should I buy?

We are right at the 0.236 fib retracement from 20 to 6k :

https://www.tradingview.com/x/rdCON73r
Short from 9426 with 3x Lev. 

God bless my soul. 

Will close if it reaches 9500+. Plan on taking profit if we go sub 9300 and will open up a long from there. 


BTC: “I’m gunna bounce off $9500 and drop back down, go ahead and open your shorts...... 

Psych! RIP”
Always fun watching people FOMO back in. Hopefully after they sold much, much higher. Here's to $10,000 any hour now.

I closed my short from 9750 out at 9691 (swaps) for minor profit and re-entered long with 25% (June futures) at 9600. This doesn't appear to be done yet. It could be double topping, but I'm staying with the trend for now. I've got enough profits from today to roll the dice on a continuation here, so I'm adding up to 40% here at 9660, CA @ 9625. I'll put one more add at 9560 up to 50% of the stack and set stops below 9500. 

Also setting a $300 trailing stop in case of any overnight shenanigans. No TA really, just looking at the ridiculous uptrend and willing to assume the risk. If we FOMO rally into 5-digits, I don't want to be on the wrong side of that BGC. 

Far and away the best trading day I've had in weeks. Going to bed happy.

Good luck all.

edit: spammed market close on the BRC and exited at 9525.
Hodler Report: Get ready for an epic bull run. We are by every indication forming a classic Adam and Eve double bottom with high likelihood of success. Everything I've read about them coincides with what we see on the bitcoin daily chart.

The formation computes to a $15.5k price target if confirmed. Amazingly this perfectly coincides with the OTE of fib lines for opening a short position at $15.5k. This pattern has a high likelihood of success having formed after a short down trend.

Confirmation comes after breaking the small double top of $11.8k

A chart to summarize it all. [https://www.tradingview.com/x/xVCt5Tlo/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/xVCt5Tlo/)

Be careful Bears. Seriously. If you must short do so wisely.

With the air getting very thin up here, I looking for the first sign of trouble to get out of my breakout long from 9000 XBTM18.

The Elliot picture is fairly complex here so I am putting lower than usual stock in it here but the targets are drawn nevertheless. Combining that with retraces and measured moves the lowest target I have on the radar clocks in at 9500 with bigger targets getting close to 9780.

I apologise for the messier than normal chart but there is a lot of information I am trying to get together. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/WdvC2wTh/

Not sure I expect the market to even make these targets and will very quickly jump out at the first sign of trouble. I looking to short a reversal signal in those areas as well. Due to the over extension expect any breakdown to be very swift.

Edit:
Further to the bullish case is the time indicator gives us room to move up on the daily and the 4h charts

https://www.tradingview.com/x/E2ZdHRqA/

Edit 2:
Sorry also forgot to add things to watch for on the bear case are a bearish div is forming a couple of timeframes and the longs are piling in again with shorts closing could be exhausting our potential rocket fuel. I am looking for a ending diagonal (Raising Wedge) on this final move to confirm a completion of the larger move before the primary correction.
Not sure if it was mentioned, but 9511 is the 38.2% fib from 5.8 to 11.7.

Though the 23.2% fib from 5.8->11.7 at 9215 was more important IMO.

Edit: Then until 10374 I have no old notes about any horizontal resistance, which is the 23.6% fib of 5.8->11.7, and 10300 previously provided strong resistance and some support.

Edit: dammit, typing this up to justify the next breakout fomo buy I was about to do just made me miss the good timing heh.
Some perspective, we have retraced *less* and in *more* time than the first bounce from 6~11k.

I was only making the comparison to myself, because looking at the last month, it just seems insane.  But maybe it's actually less insane than that bounce.  (or maybe since the previous run was a "bounce" it wasn't insane, but still, just too fast)

9.8 \- 9.9ksh next resistance?
Opened a 30% hedge short at 9740. Long profit stopped at 9650.
Broke through the Kijun and closed in the cloud.

Closed my unleveraged long from 7880 at 9350 and 9675 for a nice profit but not as much as I was planning. We'll see if I pulled out too early. My original target was 10.5 as an exit. Good luck out there.
We've got fomoers propping the price up, prudent traders exiting longs, wreckless shorters entering shorts or holding on to underwater shorts... all the ingredients needed to make this thing go parabolic to 12k. Not saying it's going to happen, but it could.
I welcome a retrace to consolidate. Very strong sign. 
Ok, have wait long enough, time to jump in back, will see.
Well we're nearing the 50% point since the start of this and futures are *still* in negative territory.

Swaps open interest is skyrocketing (24% in the past week from 460M, 70% since the jump that started this from 335M) but futures volume is flat to declining.

The largest retrace we've seen is 4.5% and we should have seen 10-15% minimum by now (as retracements are 30-50% of the directional movement).

I don't understand what's going on.
Honestly I can say this is the first time I’m experiencing major FOMO since end of November 
After reconsidering, I'm thinking shorting before a blow off top is premature. Selling is fine, but shorting on leverage may not make much sense when bitcoin basically *never* slow tops after a strong upwards trend. It'll be a blow off top of *at least* 3-4% with a swift rejection. 

I think I need to reorient my mind for the time being to going with the medium term trend rather than trying to catch the end of it. 

I didn't realize how long it's been, either, it's been 4 weeks of green now! 

I originally shorted my big short after a rejection of $11.7k, technically opened it at $11.4k. I'm thinking I should do the same here.

RSI is smoking but buyers look like they want to keep going. I feel like Luke when he turns off his targeting computer in the last leg of the Death Star trench run. Just gotta ignore the charts and use the Force. 
Bitcoin Dominance is approaching historic lows @ 37.2% right now.  Throughout history, the only period where Bitcoin Dominance has been this low in the past was during the peak of the Altcoin rush when the overall marketcap hit $800B+.

If the markets continue to be positive, expect a major breakout from Bitcoin at some point where it captures somewhere near 45-50% dominance.  Today that would ~421M * 0.45 - 0.5 so:

$189.45B - $210.5B Market Cap or $11.1K to $12.4K per coin

A breakout to these values would be nothing out of the ordinary based on the current market cap, but could take some wind out of the sails of the recent bullish trend if it cannibalizes into Alt coin prices.

That's one hell of a daily candle.  That's 6/7 days and 11/15 days of closing up.

I know bitcoin can be irrational, but going up 44% in two weeks seems a bit unsustainable and pullback is in order.  
Longs are close to 1.5x on shorts right now.
FOMOing in when this next dip occurs. 

Edit: If*
Taking profit on my long from $8,870 at $9,300. Quite premature of my target, but I was expecting the market to be a fair bit higher by how than it is. 


For ages, if something could not be explained, some people came up with the idea of a higher creature which magically controls the known world. Today we have Whales - Creatures which are responsible for every unexpected move... Guys, lets face it: Only because you don't understand the millions of metrics, psychology, algorithms of bots, your only chance is to explain every move with a Godlike creatures - thats so medieval ;)

I"m gonna hit the hay before either of these charts close their current candle, but the 12h is seeing a chikou breakout and the daily is looking more and more like it'll go in the same direction. 

12h: https://www.tradingview.com/x/SIE3EKi5

1d: https://www.tradingview.com/x/aJJ9xOnj

But, has full bulltard mode has been engaged? The gradual creep between the entries that are triggering breakouts is a sign that the masses are returning and with every extra participant, the vulnerability of the market decreases. It's been ascending triangle after ascending triangle. At least now we know the market's  reaction to the 1/4-billion entry we saw two weeks ago (on just one exchange, not even OTC!). 

To me, this means we're looking for the same order of magnitude of profit taking prior to a reversal. Could be quite a wait imho. Others have wisely said, TA at this point becomes somewhat limited, but I won't be taking an eye of of volume even if sentiment is just a good an indicator in mania phase.

The RSI overbought and cool off actually is proving reliable indicator on the 5m chart for these little breathers.  First time I've seen RSI actually correlate to the next movement in a little while.

So if you are trying to set buys like 50~100 below or so, and have seen them go to the rear view mirror, those overboughts on the 5m are the moments to set them.
So we have climbed our way to my first target and I have closed my long position. I see some warning signs on the chart that I've not seen for a while

https://www.tradingview.com/x/btcRbq7g/

We are starting to make a parabolic move and the recent mini whipsaw candle is a warning signal that we could have something we have not seen for a while, a blowoff top. People are starting to feel the fomo looking at some of the posts here. Starting to short now (only hedging), this might go on for the night, or a day but I have no doubt it will come down.

Please be careful guys, don't get caught on the wrong end of a massive fomo candle.

Have a 25x long from 8880. At 100% profit now, should i close it and lock in profits or let it run and just move stops up?

Edit: Sold at 9275, will wait for a lower entry to open another long if all looks good, im confident it will come soon. Like many others here I've turned bullish short-term. Hopefully this doesn't backfire on me :)
looks like "buy the dip" is back on the table?
Anyone else looking at GDAX? Some massive buy pressure happening right now

Closed 10x long futs from 9000 at 9650.  Will check back tomorrow for a possible re entry.  Today seems like we ran out of steam.  We might hit 9.8k, but I am happy with this.
For 2018 I've been focused on maximizing USD.  I've now switched to maximizing BTC.
headlines tomorrow will rave about BTC cruising to 10k, no more than 3 days they'll proclaim the bear market over, blew past 10k, and very soon after that everyone will suddenly realize the limited supply and the rest is history

is that unreasonable? what do you think could make us drop like a rock from here? how many coins do you think went to a single group in that first BGD? cause thats the only way I see this falling on it's face. one group buying those 3 bgd to incite the fomo we saw today, just to dump on us right when we think we're in the clear. but even then, they'd let it pump a bit to maximize profits, no?
this is a bear worst nightmare
Hidden sell wall at 9270 on bitfinex at the moment. Seen it eat at least 120 btc.

Touched it again before  moving back down.
Is anybody else charting a rising wedge?  There isn't a divergence to go along with it.  In general rising wedges are bearish.  With 9500 resistance right above this is starting to look like a good short entry with confirmation.

added 20% of my fiat to my holdings. Fomo is real

This might be an unpopular opinion, but I think it is clear that many of us are expecting a retrace sometime soon here, and I am, too, so I just want this pullback to happen right now. And then bounce up strongly just to reaffirm that this is not a dead cat bounce, would be the best case scenario if you ask me. It is really making me nervous that we have not had a major pullback yet. 


So if we can just get it out of the way before continuing this bull run, that would be great.
The other day I pointed out that RSI becomes less reliable during strong trends, and boy has that been true the past few weeks.

But if you're opening a fresh long in this range, I think you should have your head examined. 

The market has moved approximately 40% since $6,800. The largest correction the market has seen since then was a paltry 7% drop from $8,400 to $7,800. 

RSI is above 70 from the 30m to the 12h and is approaching overbought on the 1d. 

There's a drop coming sooner rather than later in my opinion. 

The market never really confirmed the log resistance line as support, and its now just below $8,500. That would be my guess for a target.

If this keeps chugging up to $10,000 then my outlook will change a bit and the target will be  higher. Probably $9,000. 

But my opinion is get in and out quickly if you can't resist the fomo.
which exchange (if any) do you guys think is leading the market?

I'm just curious, does anyone/any metric take any stock in our recent move above the 200 day average? Is it bullish, bearish or a meaningless statistic? I'm scrolling back and forth along bitcoin's long history and not really drawing any conclusions. Except how nutty 2014 was, but that's a given ;\)
On another topic, I've been using the bitmex funding as a senitment indicator for some time now, and since trading a little on 'finex I've been happily exploring the different funding there. 

Now, on Sunday when I parked my stack into funding for the week to bind my itchy hands, there was a cool 160m on offer at the FRR of 0.01%. It's since disappeared and the FRR rate has doubled but with just a few dozen K available. 

Anyone else use this as a metric or at least can speak from experience with these movements and orders of magnitude? The next million for example is at 0.4%
For those who trade on kraken, how do you do it?

What do you hold your trading stack in when you aren't holding a position?  USDT?  (this might not be specific to kraken)

What tools do people use to calculate their potential loss/gains vs their invested amount?   Trying to learn..
[deleted]
TA / math question. Say a pattern has a historical success rate of 70% of hitting is target and another pattern or indicator has a 60% success rate. What's the proper way to combine these odds? Or should you? This example is arbitrary.

My thinking is from other statistics multiply the inverse. So 1 - (1-.70 * 1-.60) = 88%
Got stopped out with my 9355 long when moving up the trailing stop loss, I think things are going up too fast for now and will stay out until either 10k test or 9.2k test I think. If it turns out to be sideways a while, I start buying small again on low leverage

Another thing I have been thinking about the last days is what I call "normie seller exhaustion". people who bought and waited, or just gave up. So either they just sell or they wait to break even(classic amateur mistake to sell then). When all this sellinng pressure is gone, the big downpressure for the last few months will disappear. But this is just my personal theory

A break below 9500 would confirm a double top on a shorter time frame correct? 

Still learning TA sorry for basic question 
If you're having beating the level, "Place an Order" on BitMEX, try the following:

    up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A

If you execute this correctly you'll get *whale status*, *first in line rights* and *infinite leverage*. 
Short from $9,650. 

I don't think it matters why. 

Edit: stops above $10,000

Four lines on my chart currently. Two are the approximate lines of the wedge we're in, admittedly being a little lax about wicks/fakeouts given the size of the formation. The general form is there.

The other two are the approximate newly claimed horizontal support from the previous ~9.1k double top that we've wicked within the zone of recently and the newly reclaimed log support connecting Sept crash -> 6k crash -> 7.2k crash. That line was confirmed a bit as resistance for awhile before being reclaimed and immediately wicked to confirm as support again.

Overall, I think the wedge support is crazy steep and will *eventually* fail. Maybe this particular wedge will break up (which would be insane) but that support is definitely going to have to invalidate else we'll be back at 20k by the end of May which okay let's be real that ain't happening. The other log support would put us back at 20k in ~October, which is certainly more plausible but wouldn't be surprised if that fails at some point too (further up).

More likely I think this wedge breaks down or invalidates at some point in the next couple days, but does so with a whimper and bounces off one of the support lines I've drawn. I'm not going to start worrying until both of those fail (in the short term) as well.

Bear divergence is *currently* (at the time of writing) forming on the 4 hr (would need to recapture my chart to show it) along with the 4 hr stoch RSI crossing in the overbought region. Would indicate a short term pullback but BTC be crazy so who knows, and the candle just started so it could very likely not confirm.
Dips getting bought up nice and quick. Test 10k within the next day or so I reckon.
I don't get it. If a retrace is due, why wouldn't buyers allow it to drop so they can get in a way better entry instead of buying every tiny dip from the top?




I think the sheep are starting to fomo in 

Just saw salomondrin put a moment on his Instagram saying crypto is back and he showed himself buying some btc and eth 
we are going parabolic now
DJIA Futures down 600...

Crypto.... doesn't give a single fuck.

What the hell guys. 
I come here every couple days for news and it absolutely blows my mind how people talk about their TA and how confident they are in what bitcoin is going to do and end up being absolutely incorrect.
When there is a premium of $100 or more on quarterlies versus spot, then that will be a great indication that the market is overbought and over leveraged, and that's when I will be looking for an actual pullback. Right now there is really no reason to expect one IMO.
I should have taken the day off - would have made a lot more money if I would have...
Fibs and the sentiment of FOMO plus denial make me believe we're going to kiss $10k in the next few hours. We'll probably blow off steam at that point. $10k is psychological, like a magnet and marker. Hitting it again will bring media attention throughout the week. Ears will perk up in the public. And onward ho!
9750 is the 1 week long term moving average on bitfinex.  My guess is we stall here like we did at 9k, ultimately ending with another break up to golden cross on the 3 day and confirm Adam and eve.  

Adam and eves on a double bottom break up, which puts us into the mid 10ks.  From there, we're either at the top of an epic dcb, or I'm going to have a huge shit eating grin at thanksgiving with the fam.


Closed my 25X short at 9650, from 9710. A quick scalp before bedtime. Best of luck to anyone still in a position, be safe out there!
I have limit sells on GDAx to scale out in the 9750-9850 range. I think it could potentially pump to 10000, but will be rejected. The market is in serious need for consolidation, and between the 200EMA and historic resistance in the 9950 range, it’s a perfect spot for some pull back. Expect us to return to the low  9000s or possibly mid 8000s since we had good support in that range. Planning to re-enter as that range approaches. 

This is by no means the end of this bull pump, but we need to set a lower high on the weekly chart to ensure more healthy growth in the weeks to come.

Yeah, I'm out to fiat. This movement is absurd and I gotta think it's gotta fall back to retest *sometime*. Maybe not.

Mostly doing this for my own sanity. Would have much preferred a bit more consolidation before moving up to these levels. I wanted my position to be a long term hold but man, this is just dumb. I can afford a 2% opportunity cost to see how things go here.
I know this is low effort, but Jesus Fucking Christ it's unstoppable.

The long/short ratio isn't even half bad and shorts actually rose the last 3 hours, more fuel.

Hold me, I'm scared.
Even though I’m not complaining, this is starting to feel a lot like the bullshit that got us to 20k and subsequently back to 17k.

Alts are pumping quite crazily. Sure, things were undervalued when BTC dropped to 6.5k, but why do the alts have to pump to 2x+ in one week again? BTC actually looks organic compared to them.

Maybe the market is not manipulated after all. Maybe this is just what you get when you put a bunch of financially illiterate millenials in the room and ask them to bet on which coin will come out on top.

Even though it feels a lot like the next big bull run os around the corner, I’m still weary of the fact that somehow we dropped out of this range a month ago for no good reason other than weak hands panic dumping on calls for 3k BTC.

Sure, the top this time could be way higher than 20k (even though Im quite sure it will be below 20k), but the exact same thing that happened last year will happen again this year. Once we get to 11.8k, we’ll need to see if we break that horixontal resistance line, but overall... this will crash hard one day soon. I base this primarily on the alts rally and the fact that the FOMOers are probably going to sell at the first sign of a bear paw.

Overll, not happy with what is happening. Just wanted slow growth from 6k back up tho this range, but the powers that be “the whales” decided we take the elevator instead.
https://www.tradingview.com/x/fvqGj4rR/

In addition to being at the top of our steeply ascending wedge, massively overbought, we are also hovering just slightly above the 23.6% Fib retracement of the drop from 20k to 6k.

Went partially back to fiat here. I can't imagine this going on for much longer without any correction or re-testing of lower support levels.
~~Back in position. 80% reinvested with my trade stack on a x3 leverage. (9294 avg entry)~~

Still considering if i should put stops on my holdings, i'm about 13% up with ~50% invested. Cashing out here would mean a 7% return on my total investment capital.  

edit: not anymore. will reinvest for 20% only considering the risks on this range


I just saw this https://www.recode.net/2018/4/24/17275202/bitcoin-scam-cryptocurrency-mining-pump-dump-fraud-ico-value and thought "hmm who's this stupid guy" 

then 
>, former CEO of Intuit and founding CEO of PayPal and Personal Capital.

Then I remembered the rule to walk with a red flag in front of cars in the 1900s and the stupid failed war against P2P in early 2000s by record labels. And that to even come out and comment now, and not the 9 years before, shows that they are afraid
Just about 5% away. $10k is on the menu again.
I realized pretty early on that whoever is moving the price is absolutely wrecking scalpers. You can't really set stops without getting hunted and the price is just moving up diagonally meaning if you sell with the idea of catching a retrace you have really only 2-3 chances (in which you must have a buy limit in given that they are wicks) to buy in lower. It was extremely aggravating until I just gave up long ago.

Now I am just riding breakouts and exiting. My stack keeps on getting smaller but my equity is growing and my risk is minimized so I guess I'll take it. 
My short position was 10 dollars off from filling on mex. I had it put where I was expecting the price to hit 200 SMA on the daily. Would surprise me if we didn’t see a proper pullback from here. 

Might attempt to short any retest otherwise I’ll be buying the dip.

Edit: Opened a small short at 9710

Edit 2: Added to my short at 9740

Edit 3: Took profits 9480. Will be evaluating for a long play
$10k BTC = Global headlines 'BTC is back'.

Might close my swing short & long if this figure hits.

Search interest is still relatively very low. The next wave hasn't begun.

When BTC initially broke 10k, long leverage was rampant. Not the case whatsoever w/ major skepticism following the crash.
This volatility is incredible. 
Is there a website that lists all the places you can use/spend cripto?
Have long orders staggered between 8750 and 9000. 

Might be too low but I don't mind if they don't hit. Won't be looking at the charts for the next 12 hours so I'm hoping to get a nice entry if we correct a bit since the RSI could do with some cooling off. Just hope I'm not catching any falling knives.
Does anyone actually consider 10k$ as a resistance? The few times i remember the price approached that mark from below it just plowed right through it. The only real technical resistances i see right now are 9,4\-9,5 and 11,7
Please feel free to remove this post if you feel it is overly specific to Bitmex rather than BTC trading in general. 

I have a question for Bitmex users or traders using similar software. Is there anyway to make a stop order that "triggers a trigger"? For example in the current market, if I was headed to sleep and BTC was at $9200 and I thought the price would probably increase to $9450 during the night I could set my long position to close at that price.    

However, it's possible the price may continue to increase passed this on to $9600. Consequently I think it would be useful to have a trigger kick in at $9450 that placed a stop loss with a trigger at $9401 to sell at $9400. That way you can lock in profits if you hit your target but still potentially be able to capitalise on a run that continues on to $9600+.    

Is something like this possible using Bitmex or other BTC margin trading software?      
I know RSI's can remain overbought for a long time in strong trends, but how much weight do you give to RSI divergences during trends? For instance, I'm seeing quite strong bearish divergence now on the 15min, and coming up now on the 1h and 4h charts as well. 
[deleted]
Did the big sell wall at 9800 on BFX just disappear? I thought I saw 1000+ there earlier? I think people might be starting to get the hell out of the way.
At a key level imo. If we can close above the 9600 level, the inverse h&s failure will be reversed. The next important level after that is the 11.7k horizontal resistance. If we break that one, it's a reversal of the bear trend imo.

It's not even possible to buy these dips fast enough. 
Take this only fwiw, but I drew this green line on the 20th as a short-term resistance line, and it has continued to be a sort of "equilibrium" line since the 17th.

Morning.  It's amateur hour where I am.

My short was stopped out at 9075 whilst I was sleeping (biggest loss to date).  I awoke at 3 and entered a long at 9150 with no stops.  I have left my phone at home which is my only access to Bitfinex.  It is going to be a long 9 hours.  

Anyone else starting to think there is going to be one or two more BGC and then boom we all get rekted with a BRC?
Short term play has changed from sell the bounce to buy the dip. Anyone looking to short should set tight stop losses. Lots of dip buyers got burnt from 11.7K to 6.5. Maximum pain goes both ways.

These are some massive market orders making these wicks. The weird part is that the wicks up are getting sold into almost as strongly. We've got an ascending triangle sort of forming here.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/4P5CwpNF/

It does seem a bit like one of these big wicks up is going to trigger the real BGC though. The dips are being demolished. 
https://www.tradingview.com/x/Iy0CWZvs/

Insane. Looks like it's trying to break *upwards* from our already overly steep ascending wedge. 4h RSI > 80. Gonna watch this from mostly in fiat for the next days.

I closed my FOMO long at 9565, i'm too scared to keep it open. 
small profit

edit: since i closed this means the price will now hit 10k, you're welcome.

edit #2: fuck
A channel to 11.2-11.7k? https://www.tradingview.com/x/s4e2q6yG/

And then a blow back to 9k to confirm a higher low of the ascending triangle : https://www.tradingview.com/x/cBMmnEpC/

Edit: wrong link
If this new daily is very red (and let's be real after the last couple hours of the last daily that's a decent possibility), we have ourselves an enormous hidden bear divergence with the 17K / 11.8K tops on the daily and a slight one with 11.8k on the 3d. 3D wouldn't confirm until 3 days from now though. Not a done deal by any means but something to be wary of. If you're gonna FOMO try to be smart about it (I know that's an oxy moron).
The arch on the hourly for BTC is very promising. I'm of the opinion that we're free to run a bit here. Sorry no TA. We already broke log resistance and the macro AE is now the pattern to watch. I'm admittedly pretty amped about this one, so here's an exclamation point!
Exited my 5800 EUR long @ 7660 just now.

Sitting at the top of this ascending wedge: https://imgur.com/a/6S4Dx8n

Would've liked to see 8000 EUR ($9,750 USD), but profit is profit.

Not going to pivot short, but I do expect a pullback here. Anybody else feel the same way?
1hour chart looking pretty unsustainable... like someones building a staircase to parachute off of, mirror image of the 6hr/1d too.... smells like bart 
Bought in on the last dip from 2 hours ago. First buy since I sold in Jan. The Fomo is real. Gonna ride this one with some not too far stops. 
OK, seriously, does someone persons know something that we do not (ETF or something) that is causing this buying behavior?

I'm a FOMO idiot and I cannot even understand these dip buys. Traders should not be buying right now based on RSI. I am sure plenty in here are short. I just cannot understand why we have not corrected yet, especially since we have all concluded that retail mom and pop buyers have already been burned and moved back to money market accounts.

At a loss to explain bitcoin market behavior, not sure why I bothered typing this out. 
Is the downtrend line broken full at this point? Only horizontal resistance?

Where is the buying pressure coming from? Seems not to be bitfinex these days?
[Soooo close to breaking upper trend of the wedge.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/PKs46alC/)  Still, with the divs on shorter time frames I can't help but think this thing is ripe for a tumble... bulls don't seem to care however B)

I'm out of trade...waiting either for $9800 or bottom of the wedge at $9000.
Any thoughts on whether btc price will be higher than current prices in the next 3-4 months? 

I'm wanting to buy some to hold for that period and just forget about it rather than trade. Can't decide whether that approach would be better than trying to trade in the same period.
altcoins not following Bitcoin

FOMOed in a long but I didn't realize how fucking lucky i was to be able to get a stop in there. I'm currently unable to edit my stop loss on bitmex due to overload. stay safe out there traders, its a dangerous night

edit: stopped out at entry, down we go?
Very strong daily close. I think if we consolidate above 9400 we get a good shot at testing 11.7k.
How much more overbought can we get? WTF! This is December!
When are we going to see a 10% retrace in this? -.-'
Looking for 9.1k-9.2k to hold as new horizontal support, following that ~8.8k as newly reclaimed log support.
The 1hr candle looks parabolic. Hell, even the daily is starting to look parabolic from 7k. I said a week ago that if we didn't correct at 9k and just went sideways and then back up we'd probably go to 10k without another pit stop. I wish I would have heeded my own advice (I could have doubled my profits), but I also said that the correction would be even worse then if we were to have corrected at 9k. That I believe will be the case. Where we will start to correct, I have no idea. We could even break 10k and see serious FOMO and then a big correction, but it will come. Demand is huge right now and when that drops off, well, I'm sure you all know what supply/demand is and how that determines price.

The longer this goes on the more fomo and the bigger the burn. Thank god for stop limits.
Almost an identical number of longs and shorts closed, at identical rates, during that last drop. So, I interpret that partially as meaning that people shorting only expected the $300 drop, and not a day-long downward trend. (?)
RSI on daily has not been this high since December, this could be a trend reversal. I don't know what's up with BCH price increase and the effect on BTC but it is a sign. I'm not calling anything though..

Had a great entry at 6500. Held alts. Sold after the second or third BGD.

Just bought in back. 

Edit: I figure i still feel happier even if the price go down, the worst is not to have any crypto at all/keep holdings in usdt. Don’t want to miss the revolution!
Anyone see this huge market sell on jap charts? 

Someone must have seen their opportunity to get out and took it.

IMO we are now testing one of the last major resistance levels in this zone, you can see this level (just under 9300) acted as support back on 25th of Feb and 17th of Jan so I believe it is more significant than the more recent daily levels. It will be the last stand for bears as we try to push into the daily cloud. 

For those saying resistance is broken, I really think it is too early to say that, especially so with the rising wedge and hidden bearish divergence on the daily. There is still nearly 20hrs left in the daily candle for this thing to turn around. Should we close above this level though, the coming days could have us at 11.7k in short order. 

R/R is killer on shorts here with a tight stop. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/9MdMqTcK/




I've been short since we hit 8.3k the first time after the giant candle from sub-7k. I keep adding to it and keep being surprised.

Very underwater, but I just can't bring myself to close my short. This climb has to come to an end soon, this is far too easy and painless for the bulls and it's not sustainable.

Edit: What's the opposite of trying to catch a falling knife?

For all who missed your longs sub 9K;

What is your entry long target currently? The dump to 9155 this morning seemed to have been gobbled up nicely. 

I’m long from the 8800 range but would like to add between 9-9100
So is this another ascending triangle on 1h or is it a big bear flag? https://www.tradingview.com/x/d8rWSIaC



One thing the last days has shown is that the Barts are not occuring anymore, and all dips/attempts to crash price are very fast bought up, and goes quicker and quicker. 
Short from: $9,460 and $9,496 ( being my larger position) with stops just above 9.5k. 

Pretty good r/r considering 9.5k seems to be playing a major resistance point and after that there isn’t a large resistance point until 9.8k.  Also got my entries decently close to the 9.5k mark so If it does break, i wont take much of a loss.

To offset the losses on the short if it does break through.. I managed to snag a 5x Lev long from $9,313 on the last BRD about 2 hours ago. 

Target to close short: between 9250-9350 where if we do reach those levels, I’ll close my short and use profits  to add to my existing long. 
BCH taking a dive. I think the market will follow. Time will tell, no position, just observation

Edit: I was right

I personally didn't expect us to just sort of bleed over 9300. It seemed like a fair resistance point according to yesterday's daily discussion (or, to be fair, some said 9.3-9.4k). We're hugging the top end of the ascending wedge fairly hard right now: https://www.tradingview.com/x/KcndztQq/ but I don't see that there's enough room to enter a short here - my last three shorts all fizzled out when market went sideways or at a loss earlier in this wedge. The RSI bottoms were rarely lower than the pump highs (meaning we bled upwards after the pump). I feel like that's a sure sign we're in at least a short-term bull run, and a strong reason for me being fairly heavily leveraged.

Earlier today I reduced my 4x long from 8787 to 2x when we hit 9300 in a wick, only to turn around and put the freed-up leverage into eth. Because I'm in such a good trade right now I have fairly close trailing stops. If btc does break out of wedge downwards I'm going to sit out for a while, because I have no idea where the bottom would be after that. I'm not convinced at all that this is anything more than temporary. 

Edit: and as I hit submit we dip below 9300. So not done yet!
Well I'm out for the day. Made a little profit. At my max risk/reward and scaled out before bed. Exciting times ahead. 
current 30min candle action is epic.
9600 upcoming. How high will the FOMO take us?
bitcoin, eth, bch and xrp all are hitting some strong resistances today, could very well turn around here - or break out to the upside. decided to close a long(still have one open) and open up a short with tight stops.

this whole rally started with one BGD, that is the reason why I doubt this whole trend we are seeing is not "manipulated"     
As far as I am concerned, we have broken up out of a bull pennant.


https://www.tradingview.com/x/fnwmUU4S/
Even though I had a slightly [wrong entry](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8e8qok/daily_discussion_monday_april_23_2018/dxukdkh/?context=0), it turned out to be a good one since it caught the candle.

Market is looking good. Very good trading going on right now. Keep it going folks. 
So was that it? A roughly 3% dump? As someone who just bought another little stack at 7k and has only started last year at 10k, how did you survive the suspense going up to 20k? The pace of this is already scary for me right now.
These are the trading days that I need coffee and food waiting beside my desk lol I just woke up and headed to the charts, but I'm afraid to make a coffee and having this drop like a sack of hammers. 

ideally i want to sell a bit of BTC and ETH because I feel the retrace is inevitable, should i sell 50% of what I intended to, then wait a bit to see if we either keep dropping or rising?

edit: risking it for the biscuit, i'm gonna go make a coffee. don't let this thing move yet for me pls
I'm fairly surprised that my sell at 9.6 hasn't triggered yet

Why was the market not even a touch manic after a 500 break from the bear line, when the 3 mouth bear line break out was 1.2k?

I think one more day before I cancel it; don't want to sell without a very high chance of a retrace *shrug*
I’m gonna share this with you guys so maybe you can learn from my cock up. Everything is on the chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/3RpUpPKY/


I still like the set up. For me each trade is a bet, I was betting it would go down to 8600-8000 and I was planning to stack longs from 8k to 7k. My hypothetical scenario didn’t play out and im fine with that. That’s what stops are for. What was the fuck up? For like the 5th time, ive managed to cock up the alarm. I always set it up but then you have to confirm it in top right corner which I always forget. Result? Alarm doesn’t go off, I wake up and im ~$150 above stop, that’s when I should’ve instantly closed the trade. But my dumb, greedy ass didn’t, instead ended up stopping myself out later incurring more loss. Its (kinda) fine though, I readjusted my portfolio so my bitmex trading stack is pretty small. Ended up loosing only a couple of kebabs. But still, few kebabs gone :(


What am I doing now? Looking at this: https://www.tradingview.com/x/X6M8iyJp/


Was thinking about shorting at 9850 with a stop 9950 but not too sure now. Targets would probably be 9k (last resistance+ 100 day EMA), 8650 (200 day EMA) to 8400 (previous resistance+50 day EMA). Thing is, as price goes up, R:R of shorting goes up but if momentum isn’t in your favour then there’s no point. Currently, market is way overheated (imo) but the momentum isn’t in my favour. Gonna see what the momentum is like around 9850 (10k psychological). Definitely looking for long entries on a retracement but probably wont try to short during the retracement although the R:R is still there imo. We could go as low as 7k and still maintain the weekly higher low, just don’t think its that likely based on current momentum. 


Also, had purple trend line drawn on first, added yellow/orange after the purple one broke down. Would you say that the purple line is more “responsive”?


Someone please be the judge of my reasoning and logic. Only way to improve is to find flaws and fix them.
I’ve been seeing some comments that say that June futures are still negative. Can anyone show me where they get that data? I’m not exactly familiar with how futures works, but if someone could link me to that, it would be appreciated.



Also what are the implications of futures being negative? Is that bearish? Neutral? 
I don't trade on 1 minute charts... but damn. Check out that 1 minute chart. Extremely interesting. It reminds me a LOT of the extreme volatility at the very very top of the December bull run. Like from December 10th to January 1st, it was unbelievably volatile.

I'm more skeptical about this bounce than a lot of people here. If we assume that alts mostly move together, then I think a lot of this alt move can be accounted for by ETH bouncing off of absolutely massive long term support in the 350-400 range. Basically what I'm saying is this is an expected retracement.

In terms of Bitcoin, we broke out of the log descending line and I think a lot of this is just momentum from that.

I still believe we will be around 8k (plus/minus 4k) for quite a few months
so is the party on again?  Wanted to buy at 6k so bad.  Asking the two most intelligent people on this forum, fuckharvey, and L14dy, time to all in 3x margin (I'm american i cant bitmex)?  We got that DCB right in dec.

Got stopped out of my long at 9291. Not really disappointed. I was on a call during the climb over 9400 and didn't get to adjust to a $200 stop. It very well might have executed anyway, as futures wicked to 921x. Guessing I caught some lucky slippage, since it doesn't seem like we ever hit 9441, and I had a $150 trailing stop.

Sidelines for now while we see if this is the little shelf 10 feet below the cliff or if it's simply some cooling/consolidation. 
So I am trying to understand from a TA standpoint why BTC gets slapped down at these resistance levels like a high schooler trying for 2nd base on prom night?  Is there some bearwhale trying to suppress the price and selects these major points to make HIS point?  Thanks in advance...
[removed]
I guess we're a bit beyond this but can someone with a bit more experience than me explain why people aren't worried about the 'death cross' that occurred recently? 

Isn't that a really bearish signal long term?
[deleted]
I'm not convinced about a new bull run but...

The price is shooting up and I've been seeing a lot more talking up btc in the mainstream media and talking heads insisting the end of the bear market is here and 90k+ price targets.

I don't know whether FOMO will / has already kicked off but there's certainly a lot of effort in that direction currently.

If we do get a rally to 10-15K only to come crashing down again, would that not be absolutely devastating for BTC so soon after a colossal 4 month correction?

Surely retail getting burned again so quickly will send BTC into a much more prolonged bear market just like 2014. I imagine it will take that long for anyone to trust all these 'experts' about further astronomical price predictions.

I’ve seen a couple of mentions on this sub that longs outnumbering the shorts is not as significant as shorts outnumbering the longs. Would someone be kind enough to explain why that is?

Which platform do your recommend for trading, I am from Europe.
From what I've read here from other posters is that staying overbought while in a strong trend/run can be sustained. But what about bearish divergencies, could they not play out because of a strong trend as well?

Seems like it could do with a bit of breathing room, seems tense. Shorted a small position at 9340, target 9050ish. Stops at 9550ish. Maybe scale out to a larger position size at 9050.

So after making some of the best trades of my life (luckiest) I opened my first (thank god small) short at 8950 just trying to scalp to BART. Had a loser which I'm not salty about it made me realize something...

I've made a butt ton of money (being a mega bull at 6500) and was losing sight that I have already won a big part of this battle and it wasn't due to my "skill" rather it was due to my luck.

BTC at 9.3k is actually the largest notional value of crypto I've ever had (again made some great trades on the way back up) and I'm taking a LOT of sugar off of the table.

Do I think BTC is only going to continue to go up in the long term? Yes. [[Continued...]](https://www.resavr.com/comment/daily-discussion-tuesday-april-10483516)

You’re awesome, seriously. Thanks for taking your time to type this out. 
> On a final note, I commented back on 3/16/18 that the next market rally could possibly be kickstarted by altcoins. While I believe BTC is the true driver of the crypto market, it’s undeniable that the alts have rallied unlike their performance in the DCBs. What do people make of this? Is this truly a new flow of fiat into crypto? Is this tether? Is this just a symptom of a natural market recovery? I have a theory which I will post when I have more time, but would like to hear some other opinions as well. (I’ll give you a hint: My theory primarily deals with the increased regulatory scrutiny the entire crypto market has received over the past six months and the likelihood that far fewer scam ICOs are occurring, which means there are fewer fraudulent “developers” dumping ETH/BTC, which means there’s less of a sustained, downward pressure on the market.)
> 
> 

It's because, imo, most alts have terrible liquidity and are large amounts are centrally controlled. When Bitcoin does something like break a multi-month log downtrend line with a bit of gusto, it's the perfect opportunity for whales to take advantage of the hype. Bitcoin's movement over the past several days, relative to alts, only confirms this, imo. This alone makes me wary of this "recovery". A bulltrap could play out quickly here because the market is over-extended and the recovery isn't driven by a shift in fundamentals (seemingly, to me). 

tl;dr DCBs all around.
Aight, im gonna risk sounding like a moron but whats BGD?

probably because its been declining since december
Look at coinmarketcap to see the aggregate volume. It's way lower compared to december but has been climbing back up in april. 
oh man, if the price increase by a factor of 10 of course we have more USD volume! you should compare BTC volume. 
BTC volume doesnt really matter.. it's maxxed at 21 million in 2010 or 21 million in 2018.  It's the USD volume that matters.  The 50,000 BTC purchase of a pizza wasnt a ton of 'volume'.


Too late? We're just about to have a 6h close above the cloud, which confirms kumo breakout on double 12h chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/MgbJQigP/

And on the double 1d chart, we just crossed kijun (the thin red line). It's the first time since breakdown from 14k that this happened: https://www.tradingview.com/x/7BoAp0tq/

This is the trend reversal right here. Longs below these points are certainly paying off, but there was higher risk as well.

I would still expect a decent pull-back soon. But it's looking ok for the bulls at the moment.
I had a long open from 9191 that I’ve just closed at 9300. Will wait for the next opportunity that presents itself.
It's okay to be out of position if you are at least holding BTC in cold storage.
I'm waiting on an all-in wire transfer so i can all in long with leverage.
Hope I get in before 12k.  This will be the easiest double in history (with 3x leverage).



was thinking something similar in regards to the binance dump. thanks for the good content mandy
Seriously though, my entire outlook on investment and crypto trading has changed completely once I found this sub about a month ago. I used to just read the daily at r/cc.. once I realized there was a serious lack of discussion about anything meaningful I found this sub. Thank you guys for being awesome and letting me mostly lurk : )
u/jarederaj has been an awesome addition to the mod team 
We seem to have escaped the echo chamber. I'm seeing good diversity of thought and opinion without demagoguery and factionalism. A lot of good contributions are being made in the absence of garbage.
Ever take a step back and realize you put more input in on this chat every day then texting the majority of your close friends?

I “talk” to you guys more than I text my local buddies. 
shitpost confirmed.  respect lost.

Really loved the last couple months here and all the friends.
Seems like a good name, now the only thing that remains is when does someone make the movie "The wolf of crypto"
ah yes the sentimental euphoria is back where bulls hug and sing koombaya in their ecstasy. i get the same way when i get mad gains
It's fighting. If we can hold 9400 for a couple 30m candles, we just might do it. Crazy. 

edit to add: just in time for East Coast US happy hour. 
I think someone is just taking advantage of all the traders on mex. 

Skiptomydoo pointed out it'd be incredibly profitable to open positions on leverage on bitmex after barting (to get limit orders filled) and then move the entire market on Bitfinex to make tons of leveraged profits on mex. 

All those barts are very likely just dudes trying to get their huge orders filled on mex
I already explained this to you in another thread...it makes perfect sense. If margin lending rates are low then futures will not have a premium. Its going to take a lot more FOMO and a return to ATH or near ATH levels for that premium to come back. 
That's a tasty monster long and a super comfortable stop for you. Congrats!
Nicely done :] 
Those are some sweet positions.

For some reason my trailing stop of $150 got closed when it was bumping around 9150 and right after the price jumped, even though it was actually only $75 below the top. Very strange but maybe was due to the overload so it closed more positions than it had to? I had to buy back in higher to continue the position. 

I shouldn't complain because its been a great run but was a frustrating hour trying to get back in where I got closed and as a result bought back in 50 dollars higher.  Forced taking profits which is nice and I'm glad I took the hit and bought back in too given the continued overnight run.
Did you just get stopped out?  Was a close call.
So you are saying that it is going to pump very hard?

Honestly, I'm betting into an ascending triangle to 11.6k , that may probably break down and retrace, depending on how much has it hug support in the climb up
This!
> Someone please throw some counter points my way.

Price is still under $10k. There's lots of resistance overhead that's failed to break before - it's a *looong* road back to ATH territory.
I suppose the market thinks bitcoin will go up in the short term and then back down.
Because there are lots of 50x and 100x BITMEx leveregers don't use stop losses and right now having -40-60% loss on ROE, and they just waiting for miracle that the price recovers as it was before.
The pro's aren't buying the current fake bull run , i think that's a simple explanation.
[deleted]
I’m with you on this play. Once I saw how we blew through 9500-9700, I decided enough was enough and set up sell orders from 9700-9800. 90% of them filled with a CA of 9738.

My primary target is a retest of the line from 9/15/17 that we broke through on the BGD. That is currently at about 8750 on my chart, which would be about a 10% retrace. I wouldn’t be completely surprised if it dropped farther, but we’ll see. 

Before we get that far, I would expect possible bounces between 9100 and 9300 as we revisit the bounds of the rising wedge.

Otherwise, just keeping a close eye on it, because buyers still seem to be pretty ravenous.

I’d probably let this ride up to about 10k, and may even add to it in the 9900s.
Chad gets an upvote for referring to himself in the 3rd person.
Chad, please let us know about your next position.
Congrats on the gains. 

You overcame the feeling of greed. Not easy. 
I should really do the same.  But I just can't resist having that SL still at BE and trying to let this ride at least a few hundred more.  Ive only locked in a recovery of about 20% of my losses from the previous week so far on this trade.  I'd have to close out about half of my current position to be in green for the week.  Will observe for now.
Im being greedy with my long from 8910. I have my stop set under 9200 and I'm hoping to close it at 9600.
Sounds like you don't have a plan and over trading. Go figure out a trading system and trade ONLY when the rules set within it are met. This is the way you are meant to trade and will help. Too many people guessing and hoping with no plan in bitcoin - NOT the way to trade.
> I needed to lock in some profits after losing over 50% of my stack

Well done! Wish you luck for your future trades.

> Very unsure what to do now

Do you want to open a position? If so, what price are you looking at?




it's been said before and i'll say it again, no one goes broke taking profit! good trade m8! 

I've sorta been following your posts recently, you always post good insight and content. gl on future trades
> it sure does feel good to lock profits

Sure does. I'm in a similar situation to you, I've been learning and doing well but then I got completely fucked by the BGD on the 12th, went into a short and didn't set a stop loss (my mind was all over the place because I had a friends funeral that day). 

Before that happened I was taking profits on most trades and only conceding very small losses when I didn't.

I learnt a valuable lesson not to trade when my mind is elsewhere or I'm overly emotional.

Good luck!


Gotta pay those tuition fees
Next week on stophunters....
Get in before its late.
"The best day to invest is yesterday, the second best day is today."
Yes, indeed. I trade mainly on gdax, and that is at 18,000 volume today. Yesterday was around 12,000 as I recall, and in recent days was as low as 8,500 volume.
Volume on 1week chart is not reassuring though
Profit taking at what number for your short? 

For me somewhere between 92-9300
I may add to my short here...

What you thinking? 
Busting through log downtrend and 9200 were the signals
So much momentum. If this is gonna get rejected I expect to see it happen above 9,850
A lack of volume points towards wash trading and increased rate of hoarding.

These are suppose to be currencies (hence crypto*currency*) but **people are acting more and more like these are collectibles (which they aren't)**.

So the price may be going up but liquidity is falling. Currencies require *high* liquidity or they're not stable enough for use as a currency.
Buying in now is very risky with no confirmed support below, all markets retrace it just a matter of waiting. You will be in a better position now to open a short once we start knocking on resistance slightly higher up where you can have a more defined stop loss.
>I can't *bear* to watch it.

Ahahahaha
Same position as you.. it fucking sucks. It will correct though.. just have to wait. 
Nice, did you use leverage?
Tom Lee also said there's a 25:1 ratio of marketcap to capital. I was estimating bitcoin *alone* to have a ratio in the 20's. Alts were likely well over 50 and shitcoins were well over 100.

Given some of the more recent stuff we saw with crypto in the past two months, I think those numbers may actually be low and the real ratios for alts are over 70:1 and shitcoins to be over 200:1.

So crypto, on the whole, should be more like 50-60:1 if not higher.
Tax season was responsible for more than just increased selling pressure to pay the IRS. I believe it caused a profound psychological shift to which the market is still adjusting. Suddenly, crypto wasn't this boundless utopia of free money which no government could control, the mass of newbs from last year's mania now found themselves swamped in  paperwork and filling out forms, or if they didn't, with the nagging fear that they'll be found out. 
> number of buyers > number of sellers

Makes me cringe every time, even though you're probably referring to demand > supply


Slow rise??

I guess you should take a look at some alts.
If that's true, Canadians will be selling until the 30th.
> I think i'll go play with the alts, it's less traumatizing.

Your mileage may vary, but as I feel that I can almost understand trading bitcoin, altcoin trading is always a big mystery. Its like BTC on steroids, and feels like total gambling tbh.
We've broken the downtrend so I think you're safe going long and HODLing with a stop loss in place just in case.  The upside potential is too huge to miss out by overtrading and not being in position when the BGDs hit
I know what you mean, i pull my triggers on minimal profit margins in fear of fomo
I think that 9200 will hold and that we will range now:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/NeWCZfgZ/
Do you see 10k as a local top or a medium-term top like 11.5k was?

I’m starting to think we’ll just repeat 2014 because that’s just how Bitcoin operates.
Wow.  Very bold.  I'm only in with about 30% of my trading stack and at 2x right now, with ca 8900 after adding a tiny bit to it here.  So tempting... I want to.  Even I regretted not going bigger at 8900 so I could rationalize that it was according to original plan... (plan was to fomo in bigger upon a breakout, and I fell asleep right before breaktout)

Edit: I scratched the itch by increasing the position to 37% of stack, heh.  With ok timing too
it's *always* better :) 
Go big or go home.

Straight risky business here. It does have that feel to it where we have consolidated enough to burst through 9.4k.

Any shot your shorting 9.5k? 
A 100 dollar price drop in a few seconds , that's very weak buy support.
The next halvening will be a good reminder to people.
and chinese new year is over too
> The mother of all bubbles is still in front of us.

This.

Last year was analogous to the '94-'95 dot-com rally when AOL first came on the scene. I was a wee kid @ the time, but even I remember hearing shit like:

> "Nobody is going to use the Internet."

as I typed-out my 3rd grade homework on my 486 while my dumbass classmates wrote theirs by hand.

The '99-'01 phase has yet to come to crypto, and when it does, it's going to be fucking massive.
> it is going to become glaringly clear just how small of a number 21 million is.
> 
> The mother of all bubbles is still in front of us.

This is why I want to have a nice pile of coins. To be ready for this moment.
Edit bad math.  18 million in bitcoin is created daily right now.  So 36 million if it gets back to 20k.  Sustainable?  Maybe we find out here soon.
That escalated quickly.  
I just cleared an underwater trade at profit at 9.48k.   First one went at 8.97k.   So I'm thinking we continue to move up which is fine by me.   

Next sell 9.95+k

BCH looking like it is stalled.  ETH looks very strong here.   LTC and BTC trailing the pack.   Most alts have made significant moves here.

https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#dominance-percentage

I keep watching the BTC Dominance and using that as well as BTC price as the indicator of when to move into or out of the market.   Notice lately that Alts are taking up significant market share and BTC while the price is increasing is losing share.   Tells me that now is the time to start thinking about moving profits from alts back to BTC.

Notice where the dominance points were.  10:1 (90% up to 2017), ~1:1 (40:60-60:40) during major bull run of 2017.  Now floating between 1:1 (35:65) and 2:1 (45:55).  I'm thinking next major market inflection point will be ~3:1 (25%).  If this gets much lower than 20% it will probably signal a significant market attention shift away from Bitcoin to alts.


I didn't bought because i expect a sharp drop soon and a continuation of the bear market.
Actually made me laugh out loud like a girl and spit my cornflakes everywhere at the thought. From one Zimmer fan to another, have a reddit gold on me, sir.
https://vimeo.com/108799588
Everyone new to trading BTC needs to get ready for the time when this comes crashingg down.

All this talk was happening at 11.5k in late Feb and everyone was shouting 20k when it dipped from 11.5k to 9.3k in 12 hours. Then double top and down we went.

Nothing has changed. Let’s just all not lose our minds, because that’s what happened in December.

The bears will be back.
Is there a reason to sell?

Serious question with lots of answers I know.
That looks the exact same as the BTC chart over that time period, so what basis does it really have? Seems to me like its saying that futures increase as BTC's price does... and then when BTC's price decreases?
For me it reads like the next BGD might get some extra fuel. Hoping my long orders at 9200, 9100 and 9000 get filled before tho. 
Where is that chart from?
People taking profits, but buy pressure is still massive
FOMO boost coming up?
engine lag probably, swaps were $50 over bfx earlier then they evened out 
i just answer bitconnect in those scenarios

Is your friend one of those who if you say "Bitcoin?" they then say "no way man Bitcoin is dead I'm thinking Ripple or Flange or Wobblebobble etc."?

Are those people worse than "beanie baby tulip ponzi pyramid" types? I think so.
Wall street friends are also interested in penny stocks , what's your point?  If they are interested it must be good ?
Closed my long here because of this. Could we break through? Maybe. Have I hit my targets? Yes. Taking profit on my position and evaluting again after a good night of sleep.
Decent shot of filling based on our previous rejection from 9400 but brother are you playing with fire. 
Good entry, even though I'm on the other side. Good luck. If Kraken poos the bed with high volume, I'd set an actual market stop just over 9500. 
Did you exit on this wick?
Same... again. Told myself I wouldnt short BUT..

Reminds me of December, large run of FOMO followed by large dump to sit there for a few hours for more FOMO for a higher high. 
I'm going to try for a little bit more. I think it might hit 10k before it drops this time.
Current price is very similar to December ATH in terms of overvaluation, a sharp dump is imminent. 
That sub $9,5k stop has gotten me twice today. Not my best work, but loss was just a couple tuna subs in fees.

Probably should chase it back up again.
Isn’t trading the best? 😁 Gratz dawg, night
It's even prettier on the 1 week.
My God is it really happening? As someone who joined at basically the top (it was $17k actually), all I have seen is a bear market. I've never experienced a bull market myself. So if this is a true bull market, that would be *AWESOME*.
But where's the volume? Last bullrun, there was plenty of volume in between whale movement. Now its just whales dictating where we move. Also, what's fundamentally changed that reversed the bear market? It's not like LN is ready for commercial use. It's not like there's an increase in transactions or more new users are getting into crypto. The average fee has been sideways.

What is this other than whales with old sold money from the top buying back in? Genuinely serious.
Over 60% of possible A&E bottoms fail to confirm. Don't count your chickens before they hatch.
I'm confused, how are they the same
Retraces are being swallowed before they actually retrace. For the love of all things pleasant, is this not a sure sign of whats to come? ARE THESE SIGNS NOT CLEAR? Long thy corn.
your post was removed because it violates rule #3 - No memes or low effort content.
Yes - 200MA 
Pretty much did the exact same thing, except closed at 9600 (from 8800) and entered the hedge short at 9710
Literally exact same entry as me. What are your stops set at? I personally don’t have stops right now because I’ll be up all night.

What is your target too? 

Edit: referring to the short, not long 
Why does your daily cloud look completely different from mine? I use traditional settings and the cloud is paper thin at 8.9k, we broke way above it today. Are you using altered "crypto" settings?
the smart money is taking profits right now, shorts are in agony and  FOMOs will mostly buy after the next big spike.. barely making any profit.. maximizing the pain.



thank you. stuck on the sidelines.  Please consolidate.

Ha, been waiting for that since 6k.  I'm not just talking a few days of consolidation that is.
This is good for bitcoin
I need a deep retrace.
Sept futures seem to be at a premium, but June is still at discount. Weird indeed, though. I expected a decent premium once we broke and held 9000. 
Anecdotal : a lot of heat is coming off all coins right now. I keep reading posts about 'buying pressure' but there's a lot less to see now than a few hours ago. On Binance at least 8400 keeps being passed slightly then denied.

Make of that what you will, I've been glued to the 15m for the last 8 hours and that's what I see.
Yes it is extremely weird. I have been staying out of position (luckily) because I don’t know whether to expect a pullback or another big green candle. I’m just scratching my head wondering what the hell is happening. At least my holding stack is doing awesome. 
So people still don't believe this rally will sustain?
I don't get it either. The only other time we've had zero pullbacks like this is the run from 5.5 to 11.5k that happened in november.

I'm in full disbelief. Are things really THAT bullish again?
Leveraged longs are gonna get fucked. 
> we should have seen 10-15% minimum by now

Where's the 10-15% minimum retrace on the way down from $9k to sub-$7k then?

Maybe your idea about what *should* happen is wrong.
This is the retrace IMO. The confusion comes when you start looking for a retrace of this retrace. 
Really?  
To me this kinda feels false cause the hype in my circle of friends still feels like it died off and it hasn't fully come back yet (compared to the mania last year when you would hear about bitcoin like everywhere)  
But yeah maybe all the people who pussed out buying 2017 are now thinking about buying again so this shit could moon again..  
I got no idea, just my feelings
I'm sitting here trying to figure out if BTC was either extremely undervalued at 6500 or that we're due for quite the crash back to earth.
I think there is just no positive r/r way to really time the top.
I think if we see a blow off, we are gonna dump a little more than 4%. We've had basically a parabolic rise in the last 2 weeks, FOMO is starting to take effect. It's December all over again.
M-mods? Just wanted to say that you're doing a great job lately. Very active and clear moderation, also in the alt thread. Keep it up! 
I accidentally tapped on the alt coin discussion thread and reported three people before I realized it. Sorry!
The fomo, Chris.  Feel the fomo.
Trust your feelings. At least until it's time to blow this thing and go home. Then maybe give in to your anger, let the hate flow through you, and revenge short. 
Question is.. how much % dominance does BTC need? If it maintains the role of anchoring the rest of the crypto market maybe it doesn’t need more than 20%. Just to throw a number in there. 
Old soldiers don't die, they just fade away...
This analysis is really the kind of thing we want filling up the alt thread. Can you move this there?
Going down 60% in 4 months could be considered irrational.
What is a rational move by probably still extremely undervalued asset? Which on the other side made millionaires and billionaires from geeks who have no experience with money so they randomly dump it?

Almost anything is possible. The only irrational behavior is here to expect something like moderate moves, which is something that you call rational for no reason.
Yep. Gonna add to my cdp if we dip. Would feel more secure if they had hardwallet integration since I have to drop in a lot of eth to keep my liquidation under 200 (not risking higher)
(Not at a computer right now), but why not just put a stop at 9k and let it ride? That should be a good support now wouldn’t it?
Interesting. 9200 was my original target, so I'm just going to set a $125 trailing stop and see how it goes. The US is just waking up, and 9300 could be another cue for FOMOing in. 
what are your targets for re-entry chewy? Anything below 9k?
Do you feel that a pull back is imminent?  What price would get you to add to your long?
Great call.
Good plays man. I'm going to go back to copying your trades like I did when I first started on bitmex. You've been on fire with these calls since the 6.9 long and I've been in disbelief the whole way up.

I get what you're saying buuuuut....if I had 100m I would absolutely manipulate tf out of this market. This is a money printer for people with such influence.
Those top comments though are passive agressive gold.
your post was removed because it violates rule #3 - No memes or low effort content.
Question: In the event that we see a blow off top, what is your entry target? If you even have one. Also as of writing this comment, we have fallen more than $150 in about 5 minutes so it might actually be happening right now.


Edit: Okay so we just gained $150 in 5 minutes again. Wow.
If it’s futures, I’d let it ride
Not necessary. I guess this is small rest, the price very rarely goes down for 4-5% in minutes. My guess is that we'll see 9k in several hours.
It has been for 2 weeks. That is what has fundamentally changed.  
lol this is crazy i dont think this will stop until we reach 10k$
Are they huge buy orders or a bunch of smaller ones?
Controlled by "Whaliens"?
Satoshiens?
Bognadoff approves of this theory. 
muh AI trading bots
Not from space, but from the space between spaces.
FOMO > RSI
Everything still <90. We're good for 12k.
5m chart traders unite
There's still some big orders in the book, and with the usual pump that seems to come about ~7 hours for now, I'm cautious to close my long....  I closed out earlier around 9200, thinking there was no way we'd keep moving.  But here we are, after briefly hitting 97xx.  I'm hesitant to doubt the bulls for a second in this market.
I feel this has to eventually happen at some point. Keep on HODLing gents. To the Moon!
What you envision... It's too easy. You know things won't go that smooth. I'd love for bitcoin to cruise to 50K EOY, but I can't see it happening so easily. 

I don't know why or where the drop will come from but it will come. This is a turbulent market. Expect turbulence.
I think you are thinking clearly.  The most bearish scenario is that a handful of whales has pumped the price with very short term intentions of making some money through an exit pump of sorts.  Personally I find that narrative absurd.  The bullish scenario is that there are billions of dollars trying to find an entry into Bitcoin with a longterm mindset.  Perhaps an enormous appetite for Bitcoin that certainly will not be satisfied in a few days, weeks, or months... years of steady buying with current prices seeming like a tremendous discount to future prices.
Not really.  This run seems unsustainable like the run to 19k, and then 12k.  But short term, yeah I'm thinking some bears are getting crushed.
quite funny how the fakeouts the last 2 months since february now seems to be fake breakdowns for shorters to just give up :)
We will see bulls worst nightmare when this fake rally ends and the huge dumps will start.
[deleted]
9300-9800 could certainly be the best short entry of Q2. But 8300-8600 felt like that 10 days ago, so....
Gotta give it to anyone shorting right now - you've got guts. Could be the best possible play but man is the prospect harrowing. 
Yeah I also have it, however if we break the fib level at ~9.4-9.5 we might see more fomo up to, and potentially beyond, 10k. 

Considering the change in sentiment in news articles and bullish news actually resulting in positive price action, I'm hesitant on betting on this rising wedge, with dip-buying being relentless.

I'm sitting on my hands and have some laddered buys down more than 10%. If it breaks up I'll gladly take the gains on my small HODL stack. 
Keep in mind that you can redraw this wedge once  every few days from its origin, we've reached "good short entries" several times now but none of those entries really panned out.  The best anyone could have hoped for is a 300 profit on one iteration around mid 8k, which would have required really lucky timing.
That would be really stupid, imo. There will be very little reason to short after $13k 
M A X I M U M P A I N
Nope, not unpopular. 
nah, i just want all sellers to go away so all what is left is buying bitcoin. 

My dog does this when we play fetch.
That's what she said.
Curious to see if this plays out.  By all sane measures you are dead right... the problem is crypto is anything but sane and we're looking at a media hype cycle starting.  So my gut says this will end up as an incorrect analysis, even though I hope you're right (would be a sign of a saner market) and we have a sustainable growth.  Toying with 10k is like playing with gunpowder when it comes to the media hype cycle though.
I opened a fresh long (after closing an hour ago)

5x leverage.

This is far from over, TA is off for me with the ammount of FOMO enduced buying pressure
Would a retest of the 200-day simple moving average (currently around $9800 I believe) be in the cards over, say, the coming few days?
I'm sitting out in Tether right now. I made some money today and, sorry for the shit post without TA like you boys do, but I've been in this market long enough to know when it's time to sit out.

It feels like that time is now. Stupid stuff I have to keep telling myself like 'you can never time the top' and 'until you cash out you've not made anything' seems to be something I'm saying to myself to not be an idiot like in January.

Edit, almost prescient u/_chewtoy_
Given the RSI, the lack of a correction and the recent stratospheric growth, what would tempt you into opening a short right now chew? Catching the correction seems like an impossible task given the price action of the last couple of weeks.
Daily and above RSI is useless when BTC is in perma-bull phase, still useful when catching bottoms.
Bitfinex is leading the market without a doubt. Every other exchange just follows, even bitstamp and Gdax.
Bullish if we can hold it.
I have also thought about that in that past.

However, *in my impression*, the USD funding rates on Bitfinex have been not only driven by demand, but also strongly influenced by Bitfinex's ups and downs in their liquidity situation.

This situation seems to have stabilized, so I don't expect us to see daily funding rates of 0.4% or higher any more, as there won't be similar shortage in USD(T) liquidity as we have seen in the past.

I may be wrong, it's just my gut feeling.
In order to take advantage of this funding rate wouldn't I have to be short?

But in general, yes the funding rate can tell you the rate at how one sided the market has become.  When everyone was short, shorts had to pay longs.  This is a crude way to see where the mass of positions are.
The Bitmex newsletter from couple days ago actually described using the funding as a sentiment indicator, and even suggested strategies of how to open/close positions to game profiting off the funding while trading ahead of the game.

Edit: Here's the text in full:

> One of the most powerful and simple trading strategies is mean reversion. The XBTUSD swap features a funding rate that is exchanged between longs and shorts every 8 hours. The rate is calculated based the observed premium or discount of the swap over the spot index from the previous 8 hours. The lag between observation, announcement, and payment of funding gives this rate predictive power.
> 
> The intent of the funding rate is to entice traders to take the counter-trend position. If the market is falling, those trading with the trend will pay funding (shorts). If the market is rising, those trading with the trend will pay funding (longs). The trend is your friend until it ain’t. Anecdotally traders notice that the funding is elevated in absolute terms directly preceding a turn in the market’s direction.
> 
> Last September I presented a simple mean reversion funding strategy. If funding is high in positive terms, short XBTUSD right before funding is charged. Receive the funding payment, then cover the short position 8 hours later. If the funding is high in negative terms, go long XBTUSD right before funding is charged. Receive the funding payment, then close the long position 8 hours later. Depending on your criteria for when you put on this trade, there is a historically positive profit.
> 
> Armed with slightly longer than one year’s worth of data (March 2017 to April 2018), I have calculated the historical returns for this strategy. The trading triggers happen at one and two standard deviations away from the mean on the positive and negative side. The below are the results:
> 
> 
> 
> Sigma - This is the number of standard deviations away from the mean.
> 
> Count - For negative funding, this is the number of observations where the funding rate is below or above the Sigma for negative and positive funding rates respectively.
> 
> % Passes - This is the percentage of observations in the Count sample set where if the Sigma is negative, the next log 8-hour return is positive; or if the Sigma is positive, the next log 8-hour return is negative.
> 
> Cumulative Funding - This is the total amount of funding received from the observations in the Count sample set. If the Sigma is negative you will be going long XBTUSD and receiving funding. Therefore, even though the Cumulative Funding is listed as negative, you will receive this as income.
> 
> Cumulative XBTUSD Return - This is the sum of the next log 8-hour return of observations in the Count sample set.
> 
> Cumulative Return - This is how much you will earn from this mean reversion strategy. That is the funding income net of the return from the XBTUSD trades.
> 
> % of Total Observations - [Count / Total Number of Observations]
> 
> The most profitable range in this simplistic study is between the one and two Sigma absolute ranges. That fundamentally makes sense. If the funding is at the maximum, the counter-trend trade will very likely blow up in your face as the trend continues. Bitcoin, as readers know, is a very emotional market. The highs go higher and lows lower. 
> 
> As the funding moderates during an extended rally or dump, that is when the tide is most likely to change. And that is when placing a counter-trend trade which receives the funding and direction change is the most profitable.
> 
> The more sophisticated statisticians amongst us can concoct much more advanced and nuanced mean reversion strategies centred around the XBTUSD funding rate. The data for the analysis I conducted are all freely available via our public API. This study is yet another proof that plenty of juice remains in the Bitcoin market for cool-headed analytical traders.
I’m a newbie and I’ve been using Kraken. It’s relatively easy. 

Kraken allows you to hold your money in USD, EURO ect, unlike Binance where you have to use USDT. 

I keep my profits in USD, and my trading money in Bitcoin.  It’s easier for me to track my profits/losses even though recently I’ve been logging everything into a spreadsheet on Excel as this seems to be the best way to track your P/L. 

Kraken actually has a few tutorial threads on their website that can help you get your feet wet. Pretty easy to understand and the layout isn’t TOO confusing. 

When it comes to setting stop losses/taking profits/limit orders that’s where it can get tricky. There is a difference between a open position and an open order on Kraken. Where your open position is the current position you are in, and the open order is a order waiting to get fulfilled. This can be confusing when using stop losses because you wind up leaving a position open you’re not sure of.

For example: You set a short at 3x leverage from 8500 and you set a stop loss at 8700. But you decide to close it early by using a Limit Buy with 3x leverage for the exact amount. Now, your buy never hit and your confused why do you do a market buy to close the position. Your position is now closed, but the Limit Buy is still open. You set the Limit buy at 8650, and you market closed at 8600. The price jumps up to 8650 and you think your out of position because you closed your short, but realistically you just opened up a 3x leveraged long at 8650.

Just be careful, i made the same mistake. Read up on it before you make any serious trades 
I'm pretty new to Kraken, but I hold some of my funds in BTC and some in ETH. When I open a leveraged position any gains are made in USD (Not USDT). I'll then roll those into more BTC or ETH as appropriate.

So far I've only had BTC, ETH and ZEC on Kraken, but when opening a leveraged position it will look at my total equity across BTC, ETH and USD to determine my availble Margin, it does not include any ZEC I have.
> What do you hold your trading stack in when you aren't holding a position?

kraken has fiat pairs: USD (real) and EUR

> What tools do people use to calculate their potential loss/gains vs their invested amount?

just basic math, if you buy something regularly; on the other hand, if you open margin position the kraken system displays the P&L for you though

If both probabilities are additive you are correct. I have no idea if you should do that though.
the events aren't independent i.e. P(A | B) =/= P(A)
Your other statistics are independent (like 2 die tolls), in which case you multiply.

You would need to analyze how often those 2 patterns happen together. The result may be anywhere other the place depending on how independent they are. Chance are that they are NOT.

/r/gaming is leaking...
This is ridiculous and im in with you
Good luck, i have no hope left on a pullback before the weekend. 
Wow, would not have expected you to go short. You don't want to wait to see what happens if/when we test 10k?
Love it.  Just shorted as well about the same spot.  This is insane, right?... right?.... I don’t know.  Could still keep going but I don’t know how.  
Done the same, glad to see others acting on the markets irrationality
These posts have been made at $200 intervals all day lol. This is probably the best time for it though imo.
I've shorted three times in this wedge and got rekt every time. You were saying yesterday you wouldn't touch a short with a stick, and how it was folly to get in the way of a running trend. I would like to hear your rationale now, if you have the time. I note your short was not entered 'close' to your 9800 exit target.
So you are giving back your long profits?
There always appears (most of the time) to be a selloff 12 UTC.  The time when the gains/losses are set back to zero.  However occasionally there is a big pump as well.  Perhaps you were betting on the selloff at this time.
Bit hard to see on the graph, but current levels of support according to your lines - 9.1/9.0/8.8k?
That wedge has been redrawn between 5 and 10 times now since the first pump.  I wonder how many more iterations of expansion it can handle.  Visually, it's hard to believe it won't converge soon.
Most buyers arent trading... They be investing 
G_ _ _D

I'd like to buy a vowel.
Because they’re in FOMO mode and don’t all talk to each other to know what everyone’s doing. This is the same thing as saying why are the Bears still selling at $6000. 
bitcoin didn't get to $20k because people were patient and smart about their investments

entire space is filled with FOMO in both directions 
Well, they are trading on the assumption that this is going to go up further, with breaks of consolidation, but without retrace. If that is what's going to happen, then those of us hoping to buy in after a retrace will miss out.

No one knows for sure which of those is going to happen.

Edit: Typo
you can see it here, too. I'm fairly sure this will top out for a moderate correction at $9.8 or mid $11kish, we'll see where it ends up I guess
Wasn't there a pretty decent premium on GDAX last year during peak FOMO?  My memory is failing exact figures, but I thought it was significant, and would be the surefire indicator that "normies" are piling back in.
https://www.tradingview.com/x/TRcLEzhk/  The black curve is what he is referring to, in case anyone doesnt see it.

Edit: Curve broke down hard.
The ‘correlation’ was a load of crap anyway. 
so what's your strategy then? genuinely curious.
Well, at least they have the balls to post something here at the risk of being wrong.

Opportunity favors the bold, while regret favors the fearful.

All the experience in the world won’t make any call you make a sure thing. We do our best!

and I love each and every one of the motherfuckers in here who pick themselves up by their bootstraps after a bad call. We don’t point fingers and laugh at one another for being wrong. We support one another to stare the beast (bear or bull) in the eyes and say: “Next time motherfucker”

That’s why I come here. And lately this place is getting better by the minute. Really impressed by some of the newcomers and I welcome anyone with the sack to put their cards on the table and roll the dice

We breathe this shit. Get in or get out the way
It's about helping you manage risk and entering and exiting, not "calling it".
I read comments like this here every day and I always have to laugh because I know I have made more money than you because I don't hold my coins through 80% corrections. 
It's always been that way.  People who are the most arrogant and over confident are the ones with the lowest IQs who don't know sh*t.

There are some excellent posters here though, like chewtoy, who knows that he doesn't have magical powers to see the future.  Instead he calculates probabilities and uses risk management. That's why he has so much money and why the others will have nothing at some point.  Chewy was born with a superior brain, and he also works very hard.  He deserves it.

But just downvote the arrogant posts...that's all we can do.
I don't see a lot of pure-up claims of knowing what's next. I see much more of "I think", "I see", "I'm laddering", "my target is" ... all of which is helpful for those trying to actively trade.
Your point being....?

Everyone attempts to make educated guesses based on their analysis.
If you think it has no added value, then why do you bother coming in the first place?
We were at 10k a month and a half ago.  I think people over estimate it's meaning.  20k is the new 10k
I sold pre $10k last time in Nov or Dec or whenever it was. Then I had to buy back in at $11.5k as it flew right past $10k.
That's motherfucking balls in an uptrend. Nice!
>The market is in serious need for consolidation.

Careful projecting your personal desires onto an inanimate conceptualization of value. It doesn't *need* to do a damn thing.
What is your downside target? 9k ? 
Same entry, but stops at 9535
Thanks, every little bit helps
First time in ages I have bought into green candles, with the mentality of helping them go up...
I felt ridiculous buying in at 9100. Pretty happy about that decision now. 
bullish, means a chunk (~50%) of the selling the last 4 hours came from added shorts and closed longs. 

On finex

 last 4h volume: ~6k

 added shorts: ~1.5k

 closed longs: ~1.5k
You're scared? I'm petrified playing chicken on Binance.
You're still trying to rationalize an irrational market. Just let it happen. 10 years from now BTC's magnitude will make all this seem so insignificant.
I think a market so easily accessible and so unregulated, with assets so ‘unbacked’ is bound to move in series of bubble cycles. 

To add: a steady increase in price would cause fomo - parabolic rise. 
A steady decrease in price would cause panic sells - parabolic fall. 
Someone forgot to buy the bottom on alts...
Many people have pointed to 2014 as a scenario that could repeat itself (with its May fake-out, followed by a year more bear market). However, if we're drawing parallels I think a repeat of 2013 is more likely. After the $260 top of April BTC dropped to $63 (a three quarters drop). Having crawled through a summer of insecurity, the November rally would push the price 4.5 times higher than April's peak.

I'm not saying this scenario will repeat itself. But I wouldn't be surprised if it does. 
FOMO gonna FOMO tho
I'm still holding my long (100% in 5x from 9330), but I just moved stops to B-E. 

edit: also, I really need to learn fibs.
I thought the same when we were testing 9300. Oh god, I’m becoming bullish. 
Why would hovering above the 23.6%  Fib retracement be a bearish signal? I'd think it would be the opposite.
I would advise not to build a long right on top of major daily resistance... cash that poo poo out while it’s still in profit. A better entry awaits. 
What a shallow analysis with borish old arguments. Nothing new here. 
They didn't have the gov't to make all P2P illegal.  They aren't afraid at all.  Was China and India afraid?  
Yeah, I saw that too. This guy has a serious axe to grind against crypto and free market currencies.  Nothing to see here. 
12.
Can confirm. Got Rekt!
> My stack keeps on getting smaller but my equity is growing 

How?
[removed]
Yep, while 12k is more significant technically, 10k will be more emotionally significant especially after the past couple of months. I bet the articles are already written.
One minute charts haven’t been so fun to watch since December 
I'd like to know this too. I accept it for weddings.
same but between 9100 and 9000
no, bitcoin is trading in too many currencies, resistance is based on minima/maxima/support lines etc


10k should have next to no resistnace.
Physiological resistance yes.

From a TA standpoint, no 
I've thought of this as well, but haven't yet figured out any way it's possible. I'm sure there's probably a way using an API key and external software, but I haven't found any way built in.

STFU dude, btc 10k will not be denied with your witchcraft!  

Seriously though, we are due for a pullback and have been for a while.  Remember the 7ks?  Me either.
This is my favorite thing about RSI.  Too high = bearish.  Too low = bearish.  It's the perfect indicator to use when you've already made up your mind.
Hidden bear div on the daily as well from the tops at 11,7. Who knows though, buying pressure is very strong so it’s very possible they don’t play out. 
Yeah I closed. Small loss . but my longs keeping my afloat 

      DONT SHORT BITCORN 
Can the head on a head and shoulder be all rounded like that? I prefer to look at that rounded bottom as the eve on an Adam and Eve double bottom 
If this baby dumps now Chad...
This last one I thought for certain would be a mild pullback, i'm pretty shocked at the resilence of the market, I think the more people witness this the more people build confidence to buy in, which just feeds and feeds this dip buying. 
$150 movements up/down in the span of a few minutes..
It's utter madness.

What does this extreme volitilaty means though? Uncertainty?
So ~8000 to 9600 in 8 days = 20% increase every 8 days * 4 cycles = 19,900 in 32 days

Confirmed.
Most people have been saying it's moon from 9200. The RSI has to fight that as well.
I feel like a broken record, but that only means anything when trading on a range. Strong rejection of overbought and oversold conditions means reversal, usually. no or weak rejection of over- conditions means the trend its very strong.
Be careful, I did this from
6.9-8.5 and I’ve been burned. 

Don’t try to short this thing just yet. All i fan say. 
Coming Soon™

The big correction happened already.
the last time RSI hit this overbought territory the price more than doubled. 
longs are going to get milked too sometime soon, so yes. question is when, well i will set my  long After.
That must feel really shitty dude. Hope it goes OK. I expect it will float.
the most retarded big red candle
If we get barted here I... I resign!
9150 is a decent entry in my opinion. I have a long from 9.2k.

You should expect a small correction soon, possibly to 9-8.8k, but we should find solid support there. If you want to exit, you should be able to find good exit points in the next 12h.

Edit: I have stops below 8.8k.
[removed]
Fuck a duck. I missed my long entry due to exams, and i have been sitting on my damn hands all week in order to avoid FOMO.... I haven't even opened a position or made a trade in almost a week now. i'm honestly just considering going long on low leverage with a tight stop, but that would go against my strategy because I'm waiting for the *inevitable?* pullback.
Buyers won't stop till there's a 2-3k market sell 1 min candle i believe
Yea but nobody will market sell 2\-3k coins into this buying frenzy if he doesnt plan to buy in lower anyway. Unless of course, Mr. Kobayashi shows his face
Why not buy in and set a stop loss?
need to go back to nov/dec 2017 to find 7 consecutive green 4h candles.
It's a bit early to call for that channel, at least until another touch to validate it. But it could happen 
If we hit $11k I'll cash out and wait it out.
I believe a pullback will be fought for at 9.5k
I feel that way every time we climb, then i look at the order books and buyin orders just flow in like candy.

But i have a really comfortable entry (6800 EUR) and about 50% of my fiat left to invest. 

Can't decide atm
Probably 10% of buyers look at things like RSI, the rest sees green after green on portfolio and fomo

Closed all my positions and walking away with my gains here, this is getting ridiculous.
Based on my experience, the market will dip when someone such as yourself (a rational actor) finally gives into the FOMO and thinks the dip isn't coming. 

Let us know when you go long.
I think you might want to rethink your RSI analysis.  I don't know what timeframes you are looking at, but go back and look at what Bitcoin price did when RSI went to the current levels.  Rising RSI into "Overbought" territory on the 12 hr and daily has rarely been a sell signal.  Often price accelerates significantly from there.  Price went from under $9k to over $19k the last time the Daily crossed 70.

"Overbought" RSI doesn't mean traders should sell.  It does probably mean they should pay attention, but the signal isn't high RSI = sell.  High RSI means price is moving up hard.  That can go on for awhile in crypto, and usually does with Bitcoin.

Maybe help me understand what you are looking at with respect to RSI... timeframe, etc.  and what you see historically or perhaps why you feel the situation now is different.
I wouldn’t underestimate how many people were sat on the sidelines waiting to buy back in.

A lot of people made a lot of profit last year. I’ve seen numerous comments about people rage selling up and leaving the space during the bear market. But, there will have been a lot of people waiting to re-enter, and this trend reversal will have had many on the sidelines rushing back in once the log resistence/9k broke.
RSI is simply just an indicator. Not a rule. If you judged simply by RSI we would not have made it this far.
> OK, seriously, does someone persons know something that we do not (ETF or something) that is causing this buying behavior?

Whats causing this buying behavior is a new dynamic asset class that is turning the financial world on its head. The signs have been there for more than year now that the herd was coming, the infrastructure that was being built all last year is starting to come online. There is not a single wallstreet firm or major bank that isn't heavily investing in all things DLT right now. The fiat damn has sprung an unfixable leak. 
Yes. The only remaining downtrend line after the ATH log line (dark blue) was pretty bogus anyway, and it was broken last night (cyan): https://www.tradingview.com/x/q1FfyK5L/
I think it is but there are many others here I would trust over me.
Yes, as far as I can tell. 
Yes the downtrend may not be broken but the main downtrend line was broken.
want to be optimistic, but can't shake the feeling that something is off 
Sentiment is neutral atm but **confused AF**
[removed]
Cool username.

Optimistic
apparently, OTC trading was overwhelmed by buyers, so its quite possible that they are distributing the buy orders of a few whales across all major exchanges.
Short here with super tight stops may be good for a quick scalp.

But prob not because BTC shotgunned a Red Bull and hit the meth pipe. 
Since you don't have the courage of your own convictions, holding is probably a better bet out of those two options (you'll be less likely to overtrade)
Honestly you might be better doing that in about 2 to 3 months once the weekly equilibrium pattern tightens and picks a definitive direction (assuming what we are seeing right now is not a new bull run and will top out below ~$11.6K)
I don't see it...

Last week BTC dominance was close to 45%, now it's 37%

Alts are absolutely shitting on BTC performance (especially when having a look at where they are now compared to their ATHs. Basically all of them have recovered more (percentage-wise) than BTC).

It's fucking bullshit, because every alt can be replicated on a side-chain. Problem is that kids these days are too greedy to develop 2nd layer solutions, and just want to make their own coin to get rich.

I mean, 32mb block size as a scaling solution causes an asset to double in price??
Looks like money goes from alts back to BTC right now. I think some whales want to see BTC over 10k to ignite fomo.
what was your long and stopped out point?
just curious 
Yeah, if we could just hang here for a day or two, that would be great
overbought? we barely hit 66 on daily rsi and we were oversold for days back to back. not saying we wont retrace just saying rsi alone is not a good indicator for pull back. 
Overbought, hitting the top of the wedge...pullback *should* be expected here, right?
Bitcoin : the dip that never came.
at 10k I think. For it to retrace now would mean it would have to go below the huge resistance levels we just overcame
the 4h is where BTC's insanity : 8 consecutive green candles and stochRSI @100/100 for 12 hours.
I said I would ride my long from 8000 to 8800. Well, set a limit at 8500 which hit. Emotions are always just under the surface, rearing its head fiercely when you need your brain the most
Ridiculous.

If i wasn't bullish to $10k

There will be some fluctuation, so the annualized numbers won't be accurate but they will be in the ballpark.

If people are still using the swaps after understanding the funding effect I assume its because they need the higher liquidity?

Mother of Volatile. 
Got eaten up in 30 seconds. Although it looks like there might be some aftershocks. 
200ma maybe ? Like 9.8k i think
Should be 9800. 
11.7k. That’s where we were rejected twice in late Feb/early March and there is horizontal resistance there. Also if we cross that level, we should confirm the Adam and Eve on the daily, which would be awesome. So it seems like a very important level to me. 
10k
I thought major resistance was around 12k
I don't see much between 9400 and 9800. I've been trying to be responsible by waiting for a pull back to jump into a long, so I'd love for a resistance point to manifest itself as more than just a rest stop sometime soon. 
$9.8 and $10.3 are two big ones people seem to be forgetting about 
Just based on rough fib levels and "looking left": obvious resistance points seem: ~$9,600, ~$10,750 or ~$12,600

+/- $100 or so in all cases (so we might already have hit the lower of those three cases - will become clear over the next few hours if we reverse and fall out of the bottom of the wedge).

RSI on 1hr+ time frames suggest to me we either turnaround at or before ~$9.6K or we go on an extended bulltard move to one of the higher two levels mentioned above.

Personally I'm betting on bulltard mode (just need to bust out of this wedge in the next few hours)   :)

Note: I'm using bitmex perp swaps chart for these figures
Not $10,000 for sure, we might see some profit taking at that price but not much resistance as far as I know.
Yea, i don’t trade so i never comment here, but I couldn’t help myself. Don’t ever use the term “jap” again. That’s racist as fuck. Come on now it’s 2018. 
How much was sold in that 15 min candle?
This is what rallies are made of.
be patient but keep in mind that it can go parabolic until $12k  easily 

but yeah, it'll likely pull back significantly the moment you want out for good 
Thats what people thought on the drop down from 20k as well. I remember reading "it's just a small correction" and "buy the dip" all the time. 
I sold at 19k to buy back in at 16k, to get ready for 25k where I had half my savings in limit sells between 20-25k

Cut your losses early
Likely to retest local high at 12k at this stage. Do you have the powder to hold until then?

I had been short since 9 k about a month ago, but closed out about 8k and started building long, i will add to my long over 12k with an eye on 17-20k,then add again over 20k
Reminds me of this user on ethtrader back in 2017, who shorted dash 1x at 50 bucks or whatever. Got liquidated and lost all his funds, 100k or something. 

Dont be that guy
It sucks to be in the red, however being in red in the while having a **naked short** is how you lose all of your funds.
Forget about your position and think if you would short this now.

You have huge balls sir. 

I hope you won't get margin called with this current market insanity.
I told myself the same about a short I held from 9k to 10k, and then again a long from 11k to 10k.  Big mistakes there.
don't worry i'll close that short for you.
While a cool-off is badly needed on alts, BTC doesn't have to it's not overextended. It can cool-off its shorter timeframes on supports no problemo.

I'm of the opinion we'll fail to make a higher high and badly breakdown at some point, demoralize everyone and have a long period of low volatility, normally that's how things work, but I don't think it's now, could be 11.3, 13k, 15k, don't think you'll want to add until there. You can let it play out just a little bit in case we fail to pass break 9280 but you should really stop after that.
I am in a similar situation...since 8600.
If you are lucky you may exit almost at breakeven, but you can also get rekt. Instead of adding to the short you could be buying spot..
you're going to liquidate yourself man, cut your losses at some point.. this is literally the same as holding a long as the market dumps and you know how far and violently this puppy can drop..
I'm on the same boat (@8100),  my only hope now is watch the rising edge until the apex (around 9k8-9k9 give or take). If it fails to break there i'll evaluate. By then i should be under 60% to 70% of my trading stack. I won't lose it all but will have to rethink if trading is for me. 
My last big loss of around 40% also was hard because 2% after i closed the position it reversed and i could have closed with only 5% loss. 
So its a make it or break it kind of situation, we might not lose so much, or get totally rekt. Only time will tell
stop adding. you are doing this:  https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/606fz4/my_final_margin_call/   
not saying close, but dont add if you are underwater.
> Expect it to go up because I sold out for a couple hundred thousand... :).

Well done man, that's life changing money. 
Congrats.  Very sensible.  Enjoy your success and enjoy the continued rise over time if Bitcoin is able to realize a portion of its potential.
If we break it before 6am UST and holds it that means the ascending wedge we're in was broken. For now the max should be 9450 (Bitfinex)
I don't know how many times today I thought we would run out of gas. Still nowhere near my personal record for being wrong in one day though.
I'd ladder. It's very hard to nail a target. If you like 9155 as a target, I'd do something like:

10% 9280
20% 9220
20% 9180
50% 9155

You'd end up with a 9188 average. If you're willing to long 9155, 9188 is pretty reasonable. 
It depends on your stop loss position... looks like 8.7-8.8 has shown solid support but 11.7-11.8 shows the most resistance. 

So if I'm short, my stops aren't til 11.9, and long they'd be at 8.6... but I'm a low leverage, more conservative longer term kind of guy
I don’t think I’ll go long without a significant pull back. Wherever that turns out to be. 11.5k to 10k, 10k to 9k, 9.5k to 8.5k etc

I only go long when I can convince myself that I would spend whatever is left from my paycheck on Bitcoin and today, I honestly think buying shoes is a better investment than buying Crypto (over the next 2 week timeframe). I just want a sane pullback at this point
Laddered targets every 200 or so from here to 10.2k.  Not allocating one ladder to take it manually somewhere or let it ride further.  The heaviest rung of my ladder is focused between 9.7 and 9.8.  Long from 8.8 and two smaller rungs have taken profit already at 9.1 and 9.3.  I also have unfilled refill bids between 9-9100.  And I manually refilled one small rung's worth at 9200.  Stops at break even, which if stopped there now, I haven't yet taken enough profit from this position to cover my losses from the previous few days of chop.  But if I closed it now I'd be more than covered.
I don't think flags are supposed to be bigger (almost) than the pole itself...
Don’t bull flags typically trail downward before surging upward? Not that an ascending bull flag would be unprecedented. 
No judgment on the trade since you have tight stops but we haven’t even had a strong rejection yet from 9500. What reason do you have to short this range?

Edit: Whoa did you edit your post? Looks like a solid plan, though I would t be comfortable shorting this range. But what do I know, I don’t margin trade. 
[deleted]
Nice plan with the flip flopping hedging and jumping in and out.  If you can manage the timing it looks like you've got potential losses pretty well managed.  Edit: though you really are shoe-horning that short in!

I decided not put in the energy and risk for automated short building and just canceled some offers in the upper 9s.  Not gonna even try anything in real time.  As we go up I'm happy just hitting the fomo buy button and lifting my stops up with my ca.
BCH is extremely overbought, noobs think the upcoming fork to 32mb blocks means a free golden shower.
lol at downvote brigade. Such a reliable indicator of topyness
Or everyone longing the herd mentality BCH fomo is finally taking their profits into BTC haha.
ETH is leading the party, not BCH
interesting how many downvotes you got here...
Nope, that money probably bring traded into BTC for the next BGD. 
interesting point of view, haven't tough about that
Absolutely right.
you're damn right.
I should have closed my bch position earlier. It's the fun of this market, it's very fast. 

such a steep dive
5 million contracts. 
Somebody is revenge-trading.
Sorry that’s me, I’ll pull the wall to we can get lower long entry points 
I would love to know what it feels like to be in a financial position to make a trade like that. That kind of money would be life changing. 
Might be someone closing their hedge short
do you use the TD indicator as well? It will (May) signal a green 9 (bearish signal) in 3 days and 1 hour.

https://imgur.com/gallery/Vq3wRSm
yeah, sounds reasonable. Totally

Big institutions use OTC. You cannot deploy a $40,000,000 buy order on an exchange. There isn't enough liquidity. And yes, the OTC market is growing and huge buys of $100 million plus coming through lately. 
Maybe let's get to 11.5K first.
shorts are all trapped since that 8k spike.  they're getting stopped out and thats the bleeding up you see

More like.. how low will the dump take us ? 
Until there is a strong confirmation of a breakdown, as in, bearish div on the daily for BCH for instance, which I'd be willing to short on a DCB, I'm not shorting this market, way too risky.
you see strong resistance, i see stronger support
Yup. 

Hoping for a pull back to 9050-9150 before hand for a fresh long entry. The buying power right now in the 9300 range is unstoppable. The dip this morning got eaten up like a snack. 
you know where to put that BGD
The market is quite a ways away from the log channel as I have it drawn:

https://imgur.com/a/HhVJrdg

The former support line is up at around $11,200 or so and rising.
Have you got a chart for this?

Edit: Thanks!
Nah bro just listen to aphex twin and pretend you're hooked into the matrix
What about *You Never Give Me Your Money* - The Beatles?

That song perfectly matches the ups and downs of Bitcoin trading.
Yep, it started with one BGD... It wasn't like we tested 6.5k around 5 times and loads of alt-coins were pumping
Look . Ever since bitcoin started being traded, its been manipulated. Just try to ride with the whales. 
It's painful to watch this clear and blatant manipulation , bulls will get crushed soon and they are clueless.
I don't usually look at timeframes this small - but I'm bored so... https://imgur.com/a/QrMoGtU
Survival? I died on the way up and again on the way down. 
Crypto-Isn’t it beautiful!
Nov 29.  We flew past 10k and then wicked down almost $1k in what seemed like a matter of minutes.  That's the day I stopped feeling feelings.  The great exchange crash of 2017 gave me a mild heart attack, everything since then is pretty meh.  
Give the market a moment to figure out where it wants to settle.

Though, it is extremely volatile right now and almost unpredictable. 

My 2 cents, wait until it consolidates to make a decision on which way you think the market is headed 
Go get your coffee. We shouldn't have another violent leg in that time. You'll think better afterwards anyway :)
I sold everything too early. If your margin is comfortable enough, keep some.
it's not gonna get as manic as before.  Lets face it, bitcoin's no secret anymore.  It's not going to get that 10,000 users a day signups on coinbase that it did last year.  Now it's more about big institutions accumulating.. and squeezing shorts.




I'm starting to feel like chasing shorts at this stage is a money pit. I'm naturally bearish, but I'm long right now. I feel like there's an X-factor in determining the best R/R situations, and that is overall trend. Grabbing the best R/R short positions worked for the majority of 2018 because the bear market was established and tested. Overall trend was down, so layering that over the best R/R positions to short was a winning strategy.

The game has shifted, though. /u/_chewtoy_ pointed out correctly that no one that has shorted since late March is in profit. Anyone still short from April 1 and April 15 is deeply under water or liquidated. The bear market has been broken, at least temporarily. There are no downtrend log lines with 2+ points of contact that we are below. This doesn't mean we won't still dump/retrace, and the bear market may re-establish, but I'm not going to keep burning funds trying to short every local top as we go higher and higher.

The correct play now seems to be identifying the best R/R for long positions and setting reasonably tight stops, or low leverage longs if you're willing to watch a retest of 8600-9000. The biggest retrace we've made on our 45% climb is 7%, one time. "This can't keep going up" keeps playing in my mind, but we're not even to 50% of ATH yet. It can keep going up, even if it shouldn't.
bitmex.com Means market is still slightly bearish 
I was watching the same - I use the 1 minute charts to get a feel for the market\sentiment during moves. I think its underrated.
Agreed.  That is damn interesting.

This is a trading sub and shorting is a good idea whenever the market is overextended, as long as you do not short much more than the value lf your protfolio.

Naked shorting is a bad idea if you are trading with money you are not prepared to lose
I agree FWIW. But you haven't really explained why :/
Rule 1- please read up on demagoguery and factionalism.
It’s not exactly expert analysis to say we’ll be between 4-12k for a few months lol
I say we'll be around 100k (plus/minus 90k) for quite a few years
Seriously... The only thing more vague would have been to say BTC >= 0
I think this is the start of a reversal, but it will be no walk in the park, and once the FOMO is at its peak, the FUD printer gets switched on everyone will be in bear mode again.

If you use stops, you can go 3x, but at this point 30% would put us below 6.5k, so I doubt that you could get liquidated any time soon.

My advice would be to long with tight stops and short/sell the tops. There will be a top, and it will be parabolic most likely.

u/fuckharvey... thoughts?
Dude...haven't seen you in forever! I missed you!!! I wondered if you were gone forever or what 
I've also exited my long for now. This price action is all over the place.
 Man, unlucky to get stopped out like that, but also given the profits at 9291 you had I guess you'd be hard pressed to be dissapointed. Unless it BGDs again as the next leg up!

Congrats still though.
The bearwhale is the one getting smacked around. He's just flailing at this point. We're up 50 percent since the $6.6K low a couple weeks ago. Bullwhale is tossing bearwhale around like a rag doll.
Guy right below you in comments gives you a fairly decent insight \(from a TA standpoint as you say\).

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/X3AMFxvQ/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/X3AMFxvQ/) \- [DamonAndTheSea](https://www.reddit.com/user/DamonAndTheSea)

That was the top of our ascending wedge. Our friendly chart drawer here is inclined to believe we'll be going down to test support \(which IMO is the sensible idea, because we haven't had a decent retrace on this run up\) but theoretically we could break up out of our ascending wedge. But not this time, and hence the drop.
Support and resistance lines are drawn to historic price and generally correlated to a shift in price direction (historic peaks and valleys).    To this end, they act as psychological anchors for traders looking to safely scale either up the mountain or down.

[The last time we visited $9.2k was 3/21 and subsequently price direction shifted to the downside.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/CRNp9EkE/)  Right now $9.2k is looking to act as support .. but a lot of traders (myself included) will take profit in this range until the market makes another clear decision.  These group sell-offs or buys is why these lines hold a certain amount of stored potential energy.
9k tempted a lot of folks - what's different here?
Don't do it and no, just Dumpy the Bearwhale. 
The death cross is a lagging indicator.

It didn't signal anything, but instead confirmed what was already obvious to everybody: the market was bearish.
It's finished.  It was a sign of what had happened and was happening, not what will happen.  Symptom not cause.
It's a lagging indicator typically but it makes a catchy headline so it gets talked about.
To add to chewtoy's comments, the 1 D death crosses have actually often been the final trumpet call for bulls to defend or die - and many times we see some epic rallies (like this one).  I still stand by the comments that without grinding it out on the floor for months on end, there is no way this bull run will have the legs to push to new ATH's.  Would love to be wrong tho.
While buyers are still attempting to buy this dip, it does seem less ferocious. We haven't had three consecutive significant 15m red candles since the 21st

edit: on the other hand we just reversed $100
Lmao what red candle?
Glad some of the shorters finally got a chance to recoup some profit. Charts needed a reset badly. Strong support in the 9450 range as it’s held three times now.  Longs should be safe setting a SL at 9400 until the next leg up. 
we are only at the 23.5&#37; fib level from ATH to 6k now, so chill! this thing can go down back to 7k in the next days.
Try drawing it and post what you come up with.
Need to get down under 9.5j for that to confirm.  And even then it’s a pretty short timeframe, even for bitcoin.  

That said, I am short from 9675 and would love to see it confirm 
Bought BTC at 6750 and ETH at 395, I sleep soundly at night knowing I don't have to do anything (for the time being at least)

I make maybe 1 to 2 trades a month
> I really don't know how you're sleeping at night

Well I randomly wake up at times without any sort of alarm. Just to see whether the price went down or up before I went to bed. I then go back to sleep.
Congrats on your success, but be careful and protect your trades with stops. 
I sleep with a stop profit
I have an open position, but actually have scalped this range a couple times.  We hit the top and take the next profit ladder, we go down a little bit and I replace it.

But at this point I fomod in and have added to the postion enough that my CA is too high for a profitable SL that won't trigger too easily.  Time to sit back.
When I close my eyes I see the executed trades roll by. But I do not sleep. 

For real though, I set alarms and stops with a large margin. The most difficult sleep is, for me, when I just opened a trade. I don't know which way the market is going to trend, and my best guess is not good enough to get me sleep. Once a position goes into the (very) positive it becomes much easier to hold on to it, because even with a few percentages of backtrace you are still in a profitable trade.
Agree. I can't sleep as well. Also I have dreams about the Bitcoin  price movements, and my mood in my dreams really depends on which position am I when I did go to bed. Several times I happily woke up that my position become super green, but the reality was different. Moreover, when I have already woken up and checked the price, I have dreams, where I am checking the price again, and it differs significantly from what I have seen in reality. Shit, somebody should study these "mental disorders" :-)
I sleep well because I make trades with good reward/risk ratios with my stop losses set. Losing trades are just part of the process.
Expecting a dive into 7000s this week.
Market seems to disagree up till now...
Dips are now illegal. Many who were hoping for sub $6k are fighting FOMO. Then there are the others who wanted to see the downtrend line broke before getting back in and you have others that wanted to see $9K broken to get back in. Not saying we can't or won't, but price action tells me buy the dip is in full effect.
I think we go up to at least $9900 first.
Going sub 8k in the next 3 days, the last time BTC was overvalued like this the price was around 19/20K.
Looking for more explanation when you post your position. If you edit in more substance I'll approve the comment.
We're looking for you to explain your position. This sub isn't here to explain your own decisions to you.
Gdax is good for trading, atleast for me. 
bitmex
Bitfinex, by far. (I am still using Kraken for all my initial buying from new fiat, and then Bitfinex for trading)
Bitfinex, is the best engine ... stability, volume, and one of the best platform, for my taste ... I also use Kraken, which has improved a lot ...
Bitfinex uses tether. It’s supposed to be paired 1:1 to usd but it’s controversial. I don’t think you can withdraw to fiat directly from finex 
Does Bitmex ever lead the market? I thought that by it's nature, the mex price was purely reactionary 
your post was removed because it violates rule #3 - No memes or low effort content.
If everyone thought it’s a reversal then price wouldn’t be going up in the first place. 


You won't get any tests (soon). Correction time was at 9000. Now it's just full FOMO buying and it's just going to blast to 10k. 
whos saying this is a reversal? i see more bull trap sentiment then genuine euphoria
[removed]
Stops are your friend. Hopefully you’re in profit even if your stops trigger. 
The problem you face is that a retrace to the log line to test it as support could be very bullish if it held, but that's about 8300 right now and dropping. That's a 12% drop from right now, which would trigger panic selling and short FOMO. It feels like it was a mistake to climb so rapidly without retesting the log line. Now doing so would be sentimentally disastrous. 

Oh well. I'm long for now. 
Why do we "need a good pullback?" Somebody market sold a boatload of Bitcoin over a three-month period. What we are seeing now is the correction from that manipulation. The only question is, how much does Mr. Dumpy have to cover? If it's a lot, we will see a new ATH pretty soon. Bitcoin has done this time and time again. Not sure why anyone would be surprised. The natural direction of the market is up, and we are seeing just how hard it is to manipulate this market. Oh, it's easy to drive the price down temporarily if you don't mind burning a few billion, but the correction is on. $20k will not be the ATH for long and will look just like any other little bump up on the long-term chart.
Schrödinger cat bounce
 You are in good shape, I'd be chillen unless it broke past 8.7-8.8 then get out and reassess, otherwise bouncing between 9.2 and 9.4 for a minute isn't such a scary thing at all
Same boat...long since 6.8-7.3 BTC and 400-500 ETH.  Have stops set at 8876 and 626.    Have a ETH/BTC trade going since .09ish and haven’t closed it yet.  Probably should have jumped off around .055 but, I’ve made the gut decision that the alt bleed up will pour back into BTC if the log channel from 2017 is back in play and it goes parabolic.  I’m 75% ETH, so I wanted to have a little more BTC exposure also.  
> I probably would have panicked

I think there is no room for panic in this market. You need to be very clear with the objectives of each position you open, and more importantly, start controlling your nerves if you can.
9500 is gut-check time imo
How often does yours throw a buy/sell signal?


I messed around in pine for a while. What I learned is strategies/indicators in pine are best used as rough indicators, rarely can you day trade profitably. After coding for 6 months on many many custom indicators some 600+ lines of code, I was only able to create one strategy that traded on 30m candles but would throw about 1-4 signals per month. 65% correct, 5x win ratio, max 11% drawdown. Still, it only works on BTC 30min. Everything else throws it off. Better to operate it yourself and profit, than to sell and give up potential profits. Plus there's virtually zero marketplace for pine strategies as evidenced by the plethora of public community scripts for free. 

Curious what are your metrics?
You jinxed it way to go man
you ruined it for us

MODDSSS!!!
Because we need a target to point a finger at for the dump and, well I don't know how to tell you this.

But it's you, prepared to be sacrificed to appease the Bitcoin many.
Chill
But for how long though? $9020 on Finex looked the same right? A triple even.
aight I try not to circle jerk about it but chew is a God lately. dudes just on fire 
Why are there so many downvotes? It was a double top by TA standards. If you made the trade strictly off of TA the target would be at 9350 and, holy shit, that was the exact bottom on GDAX. What's wrong with you people?
fwiw, clicking the [continued] link gives me an "infected" warning from AVG antivirus. Click at your own risk.
Meh, better look at hidden bull div (trend continuation) for now
Can you link?

I’m not the best at finding bear Divs 
more like the a-wickening . .. Seriusly. 

Although i almost fomoed at 9500. 

Also, its the third time this week that a bear has predicted a pump whitin 2 minutes. 
Considering how quickly that got bought up, I think it speaks more for the strength of the current run.
[Interesting indeed.](https://imgur.com/fZHFIsL)
One-minute candle down and you call it the dumpening? Ok.
9.6k is a better entry than 20k
idk about anyone else, but I spent all my fiat on the way down, and opened a big ol leveraged long under $6900 (still open).
People buying now will sell next week at sub 8K.
Maybe this is finally all that tax return money and wall street bonuses we've heard about.
smh
I'd suggest to take profits sooner rather than later; every single drop in the last \~2 weeks has been swift with a strong rebound.
hopefully this retest 9k then strong bounce. 

1. because it's healthy
2. because it fills all my longs
I'd prefer we settle into 9.2
Why, exactly? What is it about the markets movements the past week that has given you any indication that it will be falling back? 
Try editing the range to show the price more streched out
It has the makings of something bullish. Ideally needs to put in a lower high and higher low to confirm trend reversal.

Would be awesome if it reaches ~$10.7K or ~$11.5K and then dumps back to between $7.5K and $8.5K. Ofc, a dump now at ~$9.6K would also satisfy lower high requirement (and still be bullish imho). Feels like there's too much FOMO right now though for $9.6K to be the top before a big dump.

If we then get a nice big V shaped bounce off the dump, that's when I'd start really believing in a long term bull run. If we drop much below $7.5K then I'd assume no trend reversal and we were heading towards high $3K territory (which seems nuts now but who fucking knows).
Alt discussion has a place. This isn't it. Look for the dedicated discussion thread.
[removed]
The altcoin thread is 36 hours old. This thread is 12 hours old.
> just like the alts have overtaken BTC in real life.

What ?
[removed]
Look at the substance of the posts. These daily threads blow away the majority of BTC markets threads in any subreddit. Plus, the first few altcoin discussions will have more posts as it’s a novelty around here. Check back in 3-4 discussions from now, I bet the amount of posts will have tapered off.
Cryptomarket cap is nothing. Why is tether or binance coin counted there (just to name the most blatant nonsense).
I've always told people, "The internet trivializes distance as an economic barrier. So it lessened the importance of distance. Amazon beat retail because it didn't need to be in the neighborhood. Blockchains will trivialize trust as an economic barrier."
It's a distributed ledger.
The whitepaper remains a legitimately good starting point.

Otherwise it's:

* Decentralized/distributed ledger

* Authorship of the ledger is the security problem

* This is solved by proof of work

A somewhat technical answer but its the best I've ever heard before:

blockchain is a persistent, transparent, public, append-only ledger; so it is a system that you can add data to and not change previous data within it. It does this through a mechanism for creating consensus between scattered or distributed parties that do not need to trust each other that just need to trust the mechanism by which the consensus is arrived at and in the case of blockchain it relies on some form of challenge such that no one actor on the network is able to solve this challenge consistently more than everyone else on the network - so it randomizes the process and in theory ensures that no one can force the blockchain to accept a particular entry onto the ledger that others disagree with - one that relies on a mechanism for a peer to peer network that can maintain updates to the ledger and then verify this update in such a way that it is impossible to defraud and impossible to alter after the fact

You can dummy it down more and just say something like a spreadsheet that everyone can see and can only be updated and data on it cannot be altered. There is a mechanism that randomises who gets to update the spreadsheet by adding the next "row" (block) where other people can verify before accepting this update.

Edit: this definition is basically for bitcoin and not for every crypto because obviously every crypto has their own different take to blockchain.
I a not starting with explaining crypto, I start with bitcoin. Usually it is boring with audience, but I keep pushing. Bitcoin is good for didactic purposes with POW etc. It is simpler than other cryptos. So start with BTC.

Then I go to monetary theories (money supply; money = symbol of trust trust) and try to explain that BTC does not need the central point of issuance of money. For the beginning I think this is enough.  Easier to explain to people who already are in economy/finance. Otherwise you have to go through all the "money is backed by gold bullshit" and that is for most people so big step, that the debate usually ends there. People generally think our world is much more solid than it is, because they derive their own existence from it. To accept money as something much more virtual is in fact problem even for Zeitgeist lovers.
Keep in mind everyone who shorted since late march/early april is underwater or liquidated

What is MEW?
I thought you could use MEW offline?
eth has billions of $ daily trading volume. why should some stolen eth affect the price?
From what I can tell the hacker has only gotten away with about 216 Ether. I may be wrong but that's what I've seen so far. FWIW, I wouldn't trade thinking this will impact anything.
Citation needed. These posts are boring as hell.
It was me, I just went all in. This will surely push the price up.
Do you think (((they))) are trying to manipulate it up, or manipulate it down? 
I highly suspect everybody think they can win the game, it's collective at this point. Was def kickstarted by "someone" tho.

This isn't enough for you?? 

But yes, futures markets are essentially 24/7, as well as forex I think. 
There are lot of online casinos open 24/7.
Wut? Lol
Anyone who was smart started hedging their alt profits into Bitcoin starting sometime yesterday.  The logic was this.  If Bitcoin took a fall, alts would have fallen harder.  If Bitcoin broke up, alts still stood a chance of stalling based on recent gains.  And even if Alts did continue to climb, you would be holding Bitcoin in a breakout, which wouldn't be too bad anyways.
Not necessarily true.. most alts have recently gained 2x+ gains in the last 2 weeks, growing much faster than BTC. 

Alts have cooled down a bit for now, but generally when BTC makes a big run alt ratios drop as people sell their alts to catch the BTC action. 
Because it was overdue for a pump everything else around it went parabolic.
A lot of people here are clueless in regards to alts.  Alt holders see BTC is on a run so they want to get in on it. So they sell alts to ride the BTC wave. When it slows down it goes back to alts.
I wish I had some Bitcoin at the moment. I just couldn’t help myself from buying a whole bunch of alts with all of my Bitcoin. I think that for the rest of the year, all my purchases from here on will be Bitcoin only and I’ll store it on a Bitcoin wallet and just forget about it for a couple years.
Hm, right now? or the past week? Cause bch is up like 150%. 

btc would be at like $16.6k right now at that growth

If you really want to chart on the 15 min it looks more like a bull pennant to me.

That said if you're really trying to trade this and not already in a position I'd maybe wait to for the pattern to evolve into something on the hourly/4 hr chart while monitoring for a breakout.
It's probably about time to start banning for false or misleading information. That includes leading questions.

We have a daily alt discussion thread for this. There's a sticky about this. I wish I didn't have to give you a day in the sin bin for this comment. It's a good comment. Disappointing.
Thank you for taking the time to read. This one was a bit long winded. I’ll be returning to a briefer format for the future.
>It's because, imo, most alts have terrible liquidity and are large amounts are centrally controlled.

I 100% agree with this statement. Float is typically very light in crypto, especially when you start getting outside of BTC and the top 20 alts. That said, that’s not a new development. In fact, I would argue floats haven’t changed that much since last year as exchanges like Binance, KuCoin, etc. have listed a fraction of the coins over the past 90 days that they did in Q4 2017 and the first half of January.

To your other point about whales pumping alts since we broke the multi-month log downtrend, do we really think we that will be the signal to retail investors that it’s time to return to the market? I would argue the vast majority of them aren’t even aware of it.
BGD = Big Green Dildo. It's the huge green candle from 14 hours ago.
Hm, not an easy question to answer so hopefully I do ok.  

From technical stand point, the X axis of the PNF chart is built when the price reverses.  3 boxes (aka 3%) move in the opposing direction confirmed at the daily close is required to end a column and begin a new one.  

I don't think that is what you mean though so lets think more about the theory behind it, as far as I think:

The 50% area of long poles represent price ranges that likely had low volume and need to be 'filled in' or 're-tested'.  So if you look at our PNF chart right now, we have a bit of horizontal support (yellow line) at $7,776.  But there has been very little time testing the area under this support, all the way to 7,399.  We've spent relatively little time in that ~400$ range.  With mean reversion we will likely see the price occupy that range again until its more clear that the market believes BTC is worth more or less than that range then the price can leave that range again.

If you take the average of the two 50% retrace or treat it as just one very long pole, then your 50% retracement would occur around our horizontal level at $7,776.  But such a retrace to this horizontal level would not 'fill in' the area mentioned before- the area where we spent little time and volume trading in.  Thus its better to think about as two separate poles instead of a single pole.

So to sum up, the market needs to spend some time at each price range to 'decide' if that price range is too cheap or too expensive.  If a price range is overshot due to sudden buying or selling pressure, it is more likely to revert back to that range later to test it.  It doesn't have to, but often it will.
I too would like creative contract work that pays in this space in an effort to offset my professional work. Maybe we should combine our efforts?
It's like Feb all over again

Current trend is really steep though, and I can’t see it continuing until then. so I would be surprised if we get there by August. In fact I’d be surprised if we reach 50k this year at all, as much as I want it to happen. 
Buy 1 BTC on LBC and move it to cold storage.

bro what is this anime japenese kung-fu talk, are we still talking about markets?

im half-way joking, TA terminology just seems so absurd sometimes
I haven't learned about the clouds yet, but am I correct that once it enters, it likely test the other side?
Yes my cold storage BTC, BCH and ETH are significantly larger than my BTC trading stack. Still feels like shit to miss out on this bull stampede though. 
Tonights play:
The dude who got all in margin rekkt.

Dont trade like that dude, at least DCA into your long.

r/cc is a god awful subreddit, it's just a bunch of bagholders shilling their cryptos.  
*And on that day, our wolf pack grew by one.*

jarederaj is fantastic
Yeah this sub has been looking pretty fucking good with his addition. Not saying the other mods aren't good too, but I think he's putting in very noticeable positive work.

There will come a time to cry. today we can just embrace one another in hopes of moar
Good example of factionalism and demagoguery. Take a day to reflect on those concepts.
I literally can't think of *anything* else that's causing this except manipulation using mex and bfx to game stupid people.
Except people should be *borrowing* if they're *that* confident in this going up. It doesn't matter if they only think it's going to go to 12k.

You should still borrow and lever up until the point where you don't think it's going to go further.

The fact that BFX lending rates are at the longest low period we've seen in years, especially considering how fast and consistent everything is rising, means something isn't right.

The reward of levering up on a long far outweighs the downside risk given these movements and how everyone keeps saying this is the next bull run. If people don't think it is, they should be *selling* parts of their stacks as this rises. But selling isn't happening so either something is being manipulated or people just won't ever sell no matter what, in which case, the "lost" supply is actually rising and people are just throwing money away for no reason.
Yeah, a $150 trailing stop is tighter than I like with the amount of chop, especially on lower-liquidity futures. I'm really hoping for another solid leg up so I can push it to ~$250ish and still have it at $9200.
I actually did. I was on a call when we broke 9400 and didn't get to reset my trailing stop. It market sold in the 929x range. All in all, I'm not sorely disappointed. I'll happily re-enter between 9200-9300 if it consolidates here for a while. If it seems to be coiling up again, I'll just jump back in wherever and set a $100 stop. I'm pretty confident I should be able to get 9225ish on Jun futures though. 
https://www.tradingview.com/x/J0P1SDRa/

something like this would be my guess
I would be happy for us to have a long slow but consistent road back to ATH. I'm happy to wake up each day with a few thousand more dollars in net worth.
I wish I shorted $9750. it's a small difference but it'd be nice to have that entry because it's such a good one. 

It could still go upwards here, I'm not celebrating just yet. 

I am probably gonna hold this one until *at least* 9200 or 9950. Whichever comes first, really. 

I'm not expecting to hold this one out that long, but if I do, it'll be really obvious and not a difficult decision to do so. If we break below $9k very swiftly (after hovering above $9.2-9.3k for a bit, is what I assume we'll do) , we could easily see $8.7k quickly and then it could cascade down to $7.8k-8.3k pretty quickly. 

I'll exit if we bounce off low $9s back above $9450 again 
I'm laddering buys between 9 and 9.3 but might just FOMO in if we break 9.4 again with conviction. Will be looking at a short term long between 9.4 and 9.8/10 at that point. 

Given the buying pressure I've seen I expect 9 to act as support. I would set stops around 8.8
I wouldn’t follow me just because I’m new to BTC trading, but it’s nice to know someone actually reads what I say. 

I keep a positive outlook and a good head on my shoulders. 

Thanks! 
You can still go broke taking profits.
[deleted]
but the thing is, if stops are not executed, it shows people buy the physical coins and not quick margin scalps
A penny stock investor would say the same.
Dumps always have more volume than pumps. And if you measure it in BTC, even more. 

Doesn't apply to reversal of trends, in all time frames. 
Only tuesday...
Volume from the last week has been fantastic.
It's truly meh.  It's so small we'd have to move so far for me to even care.  9200 at a minimum, but I don't think we'll go lower than that.  So I'll just hold onto this forever and see.  It'd be interesting if we got to 6k again ;)
[deleted]
We've barely pulled back $100 though. I need some more convincing. 
There are two problems with that.

One, hoarding is expected because this is a non-banking store of value. Non banking is important here- money you deposit at a bank reenters the economy (as credits). Savings in bitcoin do not - that is by design.

Second, with more and more money coming in, the price is simply too low. There is not enough float (tradeable bitcoin) to handle the liquidity requirements. The price must go up - significantly- so that the cashflows that bitcoin will and must handle can be handled with the free floating bitcoin (i.e. not those in storage as savings). This is where McAfee's 1 million per coin projection comes from.
Calling something a currency doesn't make it a currency. Just saying that something isn't a collectible doesn't mean it isn't. White papers, cool buzzwords, ideology asside you have to look at what Bitcoin and other coins are actually used for. It's not like Satoshi can take all the coins back and say "you guys aren't using it how I wanted!!"
liquidity is the most important aspect of any currency. I completely agree with you here.

I do however hope that LN will inprove the hoarding
I don't necessarily care wether Bitcoin is a currency or collectible. I was merely pointing out that from a TA perspective, low volume is desirable for the formations to confirm properly.

Ultimately, I agree with you though. It'll be crucial that liquidity improves if Bitcoin is going to stick around for the long haul.
I think cryptocurrency is a bad name, it shuld have been cryptomoney. Besides "cryptocurrency" name, they are more like sound money than currency.

Is Bitcoin going up in price a personal attack on you?
Does higher ratio = bad / know your exits?

Or just more illiquid / higher volatility?
> 25:1 ratio

If thats the case, the next halving will catapult the price into the stratosphere.

Time must be a function too though.
it's still free money though
Alts suffered more from bear market, this seems normal in that perspective for example bch is at 37% of its ATH.
Yes, also very possible we move sideways at ~$9200 to the edge of the wedge before the market makes another big move

I'm not in a position right now and will wait 
I think if this keeps moving up, $10k would be a good place to short the local top.

I think we'll see $11.7k within a month and likely linger there for a few weeks while the market tries to figure out if it'll resume the bull run. Both bubbles in 2013-2014 did this with the former moving up and later moving down and languishing.


I played this game myself. I've had paltry long positions that were hedged a lot of the time from 7800-8950. I made 3 times as much on the 8975-9200 position as I did on all the others, and I'm still down from the massive hit I took on the BGC of 4/12. I'm not entirely sure where this buying pressure is coming from, and I'm highly confident a reckoning is coming, but I'm rolling the dice a little here. And I still have my 6410 long :P
Not a chance. I'm officially out of the shorting business until the market gives me a reason to. One single 7% retrace in the middle of a 45% climb is not compelling. 

edit to add: I will probably leave my stops around 9300 on this. If we pass 9600, I'll set 9450. If we get to 9800, I'll set 9700. 
Someone market sells 1000 coins and it takes  3 minutes to rebound. 

Even with your bear-tinted spectacles on come on dude.  Buyers are still lining up to buy. 
pressure != support

It dropped and was immediately bought back up
Most likely big walls were pulled ( 9375,9350, ect) when the candle came so it allowed it to free flow down faster. 

I dont think you can categorize it was weak but support when we drop 100$ and within 2 minutes bounce immediately back to same position ( give or take 10-20$) 
Just stop trying dude
25 months.  
That brings back some memories.  Our 486 was legendary in my household.  The local Lowes briefly tried to enter the computer sales market and had a 486 demo unit that their sales people really didn't understand.  My dad walks in one day and the demo unit isn't working.  He asks how much for the broken unit and they sold it to him at something like 20% of what it was supposed to cost just to be rid of it.  
  
Turns out some wiseguy had gone in and typed 'Format C:' into the machine.  Dad gets the machine home, unpacks it, puts in a DOS disk and types 'Unformat C:\'.  Boom, the whole machine comes rolling back good as new.  I used the shit out of that machine for years.  
  
Anyway, yeah.  If you were around in the late 90s it was a pretty amazing time.  Everyone was making money, employers were experimenting with expansive perk programs and you could throw a dart and make money in the stock market.  
  
The difference is you couldn't really own anything at the protocol level.  You could buy companies, either content or infrastructure, but you couldn't own the actual underlying protocol.  
  
Not true for Bitcoin.  
Hopefully it will be tens of trillions of dollars. I won’t have any issue paying off college then! 
> 3rd grade homework on my 486

Youngsters. I was already a man when a hundreds digit was added to  x86 model #'s. I remember cutting riser blocks out of wood and drilling new AT connector holes to fit a 286 board in my existing case.
How much bitcoin is created in a day and how much is dumped on the market are not the same numbers.  If demand increases while at the same time more and more bitcoins are locked up in the hands of hodlers, we could see some quite explosive growth.  
  
Unsustainable, likely, as all bubbles are, but the potential scope and scale of the bubble is nuts in such a scenario.
Thank you sir ;)
I had a long open from 9191 that I closed at 9300. It was my first long I’ve opened rather than shorting. 

I’ll wait for a better entry now after a correction. No plan to short, as the trend is currently up and I don’t like the risk right now.

My opinion is no more valid than anybody else’s, but gives an insight into the noobs that have started in recent months...
I think the scariest part is that bears are here...and went long. So they'll be the first ones to take profit at actual strong resistance.. and then buyers will need to prove btc is mooning. It will be a very tall order
I think there is no reason to sel right now.

But there will be once buying pressure disappears because people realize 12k BTC ain’t a steal
The price is the same chart, /u/Sekai___ is talking about the volume shown at the bottom that has increased a lot since the beginning of march
Ah, good point.
Savage.
I changed this answer to EOS.
HAH, nah I couldn't do that to him. He gave me a few coins he was interested in and I made sure to tell him which ones to avoid ;)
Him: thanks bro I bought Bitconnect at $1 and sold at $400
I think they are all exactly like that. And yes, they are even worse than the tulip idiots. They desperately look into your eyes for confirmation and approval of their random shitcoin. The question is when and how they will turn back to the boring bitcoin. So far they have no reason. Alts did not make them pay.
He actually wound up buying a small amount of LTC and selling for a "nice 17% profit". Needless to say, I laughed in his face. 17%? Dude is an amateur, haha!!
Lol, my point is that my friend is a highly educated, more "traditional" investor...if that makes sense. They tend to think that they know everything. It was just funny to see him "flip" so easily. Greed always wins. 
expecting a pull back to 9k first 
I took 1/3 out, letting 2/3 run with a stop profit at 9075
I'm unsure what to do myself. Take profits now or wait and see what Europe does. I'm certainly out before 10k.
Seems like it has the buying power to murder 9500 no prob, but the 400’s of the numbers have been getting rejected 2 times before bursting through. 

Ex: 8400 rejected twice before running from 8200-8500. 

Playing this similar to the 8k’s but a little more cautious 
Yeah stops at 9510, May close early considering the rejection was weak sauce as fuck. There are some large sell orders being executed right now on Gdax. 

Expecting 1 more pull back before we burst through 9.4k 
[deleted]
I think it will hit $30K before it becomes worth trying to short again.

edit - let me explain...

Do you folks not see what's happening here? Demand is far outstripping supply.  Unless supply increases markedly or demand falls off a cliff, we're going up for a while.  What would increase supply? Some mega whale selling.  What would cause demand to drop off?  Nothing.  The stock market is tanking while cryptos are exploding.  Writing's on the wall.  Satoshi was prophetic in the genesis block.
I wouldn't bet on that, like, at all.
RIP sweet tuna 
The odds are decent mine will execute. I'm debating whether to lower it and risk taking a more sizable chunk out of my winning day, or roll the dice with it. It's below the most recent wick down.
I'm long, so I'm not trying to scare anyone out of buying or longing here but you should really contain yourself until at least $10k. $11k I say try to contain  your joy but be prepared for big disappointment. $12k is when you can start to relax and $13k I'd say you can be happy and excited.

Until then, really, try to contain yourself because it will lead to an even larger disappointment. 

The A&E doesn't confirm until $12k breaks
It is even "worse". If bitcoin history is an indication it will blow up significantly from there, with the next pullback / bear being above 20000. (note: i stil lagree with the interim correction from 15500 being possible, I talk about the next real bull setting all time highs).

You basically got emotionally screwed for buying "a top". You will get used to that craziness.
Volume drops before confirming an A&E double bottom. The formation describes the psychology of the market. The Eve portion is a market that is deeply uncertain.
Right side of it usually has low volume. 
Judging by people I know IRL they've done a lot of learning the last few months after the mania caught their attention. I would suspect some of them and their types are buying. There's a lot of attention in the news. Smart money is either watching or accumulating. I think it's disingenuous to call the last few months a bear market, nothing terrible happened, no Gox collapsed. Price simply corrected for a while, cooled off. The 1 week MACD settled down. I've always argued that the last few months were but a correction in a massive multi\-year bull market. 
Since when does the cryptocurrency market care about actual use cases or functionality?
One confirmed on the 4 hour recently.
Let us have our hopium
Well it has yet to confirm, but where do you get that figure?
bears were expecting their chicken to hatch at 1.3-3k
Thanks, bad paste!
I'm embracing the insanity.
Probably just 95xx for now. I'm not actively watching it.
Ya, he's using double "crypto settings" I tried both and traditional works better IMHO for more moves and you catch more. 
This cloud is on (20, 60, 120, 30) which is double the normal values after adjusting for 24/7 trading vs Traditional market hours.
Lots of traders I trust use these "doubled" settings for BTC in particular as it helps you not get faked out by the cloud. 

For alt/btc pairs on the daily I use what I call "normal" settings which would be (10, 30, 60, 30).

Both settings are technically correct. The doubled settings are more  certain of the trend on the larger time frames but the normal settings offer you more (less certain) info in the short term. 

The thin cloud on your chart represents an area of little resistance. That still corresponds with the doubled settings where a massive edge to edge trade has been setup in the same area after busting through the kijun and closing in the cloud. 
Not sure that's where we are headed. Ballsy move to have sat on that if you did. I can't say I wish you luck since I'm long. I too once shared the sentiment of needing to drop below 6k. Just cut my losses and went long at 6.6k and grateful for it now. 
I feel ya. I'm drowning underwater here, but I know the second I close my short we'll be going down.
It took about 6 attempts to break and sustain 9k. If the buyers keep knocking it’ll fall eventually.
IMHO, it just seems too good to be true. An insane run from $1k to $20k, and now not even 6 months later we're all going to be rich *again*? Maybe I'm also a bit skeptical because I held through the 2014/'15 bear market. At every short term bull run everybody announced the start of the next bubble, and they were wrong time after time.

I want to believe, and I'm longing this run up, but there's always a voice in my head saying "dead cat bounce... bull trap... maximum pain"
Personally, no. I think it will fail to make an ATH and break badly but the top is impossible to predict. Could even pass 11.7 and fail at 15k, ultimate bull trap. Rn we have newcomers, people who sold higher fearing they have to rebuy higher than they sold seing how fast it went, and for sure people chasing their losses. Clearly big money accumulated at 6.8 and 8k and will unload at the first sign of weakness on longer timeframes, don't think that time has come yet tho.

There are few ppl looking charts I think overall compared to ppl watching portfolios apps and seing +30% on 24h, pavlov does the rest.
Actually that had multiple pullbacks over 10% and two of around 20%. The one from 7.8 to low 6's. 11k to low 9's that happened within like 30 minutes.
No , we are  still in a bear market.
No. All things point to no. It is very strange and can't go on forever.
There was a 10% bounce to 8.4 before it fell more... 
My *personal* belief is that it's overvalued, but the market didn't exactly agree.

I think $6500 was mainly capitulation. all those shorts were people throwing their hands up, saying "Fine! It's not worth $7k. Let it die. I'm out for now." even though they personally disagreed. if/when we get rejected from $12k again, $6k won't be so strong of support and people won't need to be convinced, they'll hand over their coins without too much of a fuss

It's still overvalued imo but this market is silly and stubborn and it takes a while for people to really get it through their head that no, this is not the next bull run. 

All that being said this could be the bull run....but yeah..don't think so, personally. 
Right, it's better to wait and watch 
Sorry I was confusing. I meant 3-4% of upwards movement, then a swift rejection back down. The correction will be anywhere from 10-20% 
No biggie. Thanks for reporting. I depend heavily on your habit of doing that. It makes a big difference.
Fair enough, I am really looking at the BTC price though, just using the overall market cap as indicators.
I think it is correct to be here. This kind of information I may use to inform my trades on BTC. 
Agreed.  Also going up 550% the 4 months before that was pretty crazy as well.

9/17/2017	3606.28	3664.81	3445.64	3582.88
12/17/2017	19475.8	20089	18974.1

As if nothing happened before that to precipitate the correction...
Not really if the biggest Bitcoin exchange is accused for fraud , they are still under investigation.
Extremely undervalued asset?  i hope you're joking.
I concur
only if it keeps dropping. If it bounces off of $9,200, it's a non-event.
"[...] only as you gasp your dying breath shall you understand, your life amounted to no more than one drop in a limitless ocean!
Yet what is any ocean but a multitude of drops?"
I didn't say that there aren't ppl doing this - BUUUUUT not every freakin move is "Whaled" ;)
Fair enough, hope you remove the other 5 dozen posts in here that extend as much effort.
And then retraced back up in one minute!
perpetual
i sold some, lets see how this plays out..
Btc still being bought en masse 
Looked like a whole slew of fomo orders, happened so fast I couldn't see the sizes. Crazy to me is that neither the initial dump or the latter pump made any significant change to the RSI, even on the 5m or 15m charts.
That makes cows the non-whales. Love the analogy.
[deleted]
I dunno, it was pretty smooth from $1k to $20k.

Again with the, "It can't be easy" logic.

Why can't it? Why does life *have* to be difficult? Plenty of Texans found oil in their backyard--no effort required. In the same vein, we could all become millionaires in the next few years without lifting our fingers a few times but between clicks.
I am short at 9700...how can you not be?  If i get stopped out at $9950, then so be it.
But it’s gone that smooth in recent past multiple times
What would be your plan regarding taking profits, theoretically?

Looking back it's easy to say that people should have sold at $20k, but I'm sure that was the same sentiment for each previous high.  Lol, sucker, should have sold at $120.
I expect that McAfee's daily growth predictions will stay true - $50k EOY will be almost double the price of the long-term growth rate...

Right now hovering about 10% over
Why do you think it's fake? 
Then bitmexrekt will be on fire!
Not sure how i post a screenshot of a hidden wall, but i understand what you are trying to achieve.
So what you're saying is, that once everyone is convinced we're clear skies to an ATH this market definitely won't bring maximum pain?? 

I posted before, this goes back to $12k, everyone fomo's, shit's the bed back to $8k ish, people cri, Bitcoin flys to $100k.  So simple. 
Oh, good then. This daily discussion just seems very bullish, more so than I have ever seen before, so I thought that my view on the situation would not be taken very well.
The coming hours from the looks of it, honestly.
There are 0 people who have opened a short in the last 30 days (and are still holding it) who are in profit.

Let that sink in for a moment.

I'm not touching a short with a 100-foot pole. 

I'll buy the dip when it comes.
> perma-bull phase

Nice oxymoron.

General tether liquidity is a good point I hadn't thought of, and I'm still learning more about how that works, but what I'm driving at here is whether funding volume and cost varies when the market is undecided vs trending.
more volume = more liquidity, rising volume here would mean more bulls coming in.  Bulls tend to stampede in or out, herd animal. 




You can be short swaps and long on futures so you are basically flat but collecting funding.
that's the way it works on 'mex, there's a mean reversion principle which makes it a good sentiment indicator. but on 'finex funding is separate and you pay regardless of the side or the market sentiment. 
Ya I watched one video about using an opposite order to close out your open position.  I might be using incorrect terminology, i'll watch that video again.

I actually couldn't find where to deposit USD/fiat, only crypto.  Can you point me where that is?  Or is it that I can only deposit crypto onto kraken, but I can hold USD from profits?
Ah, so you're always holding one of the coins.  So does it grey out unavailable margin amounts?  

Is there a minimum amount you would ever use to open a position due to fees and such?  Attempting to learn how to get in to this but going with very small amounts to attempt to get my feet wet.
Can I actually deposit fiat?  I couldn't find where to do so.
agree
So a more empirical approach
Sorry. Not usually the one to blatantly shitpost.

Won’t happen again  
I'm in it before it was cool (@8100 i know... Should have known better) 
It appears many people are of the same mind: https://i.imgur.com/baQjd7x.png

But with price continuing to rise along with shorts, I'd be pretty cautious entering a short here
Same 
Markets are not irrational. 
And bitcoin doesn't go up forever so at some point someone will be right
With stops above $10k there is more reason here though. You would expect 5 figs to act as some sort of psychological resistance... but ya never know with BTC haha
Suffice it to say that I took a look at the market and thought, this is ridiculous. And has been ridiculous for some time.

The risk of the market continuing to remain irrational is certainly present, but the reward finally outweighed that risk. $9,000 is a "reasonable" target for a shallow pullback, and I'll exit above $10,000. 

$650 potential gain vs $350 potential loss. 
He (and other good traders) changes his mind a lot, and that's partly because the market changes a lot. Sometimes he'll say shorting at X is retarded but 24h later he shorts at X.

The market can make weird moves that justify it.

This comment is intrusive stalker like.
Think of them more as approximate bands than absolute lines. But yes, ~9k-9.2k (concentrated at ~9.1k) should be a support zone along with the area around 8.8k right now.
Well, yeah, with a formation that big a break down will take awhile to confirm and everyone will have it drawn slightly differently making the supports and resistances just approximate zones. That's a decently justifiable reason for slightly redrawing it when new information comes. I personally don't think it'll break down very forcefully but it should be easily seen when it does. I try to keep mine wide enough at the start to include the 7.2k and 7.5k local highs along with the BGD from 6.9k (and the trendline up leading up to it).
I’m betting on 11K+ 

Gotta turn 10K into support instead of resistance so you can sell off without fear of all your work crashing down.

10K should also trigger a lot of fomo/shorts closing which they can sell into 

Looks like trader FOMO, but that's taken the market up to almost $12k twice this spring.

Whales now control even more of the market and may not want to distribute sooner than those levels. Haven't shown any signs of doing so yet.
Was like 1-2k at most. Korea was at like 5k. Gdax was always at a slight premium those last six months though
can I get some handle with that cup?
Borrowing /u/beastly_beast's chart, BTC/SPX500 *has* held an interesting correlation. But no, it isn't going to decide which way the crypto market moves.

I've held bitcoin for over five years and I'm not ashamed to say I have absolutely no idea. It's a gamble, plain and simple.
Sharing ideas and opinions are fine, but so many people pretend they know what it's going to do, laugh when someone says the opposite of theirs. It's a joke and funny to see.
b-b-but! that one time it went past your line you drew! its impossible!

I never understand posts like these. The guy probably bought a $1000 dollar "online crypto/forex TA guide" and got rekt.
I think that was just too close to the 6k bottom. People were still going on about the dump when we came back up to 11k. Only about 1 week had passed and news gets to the public in about that time. It's been 3 months since then, I think this crossing of 10k will carry more meaning to people without the 6k dump hangover.

edit: the cross up not the cross down i mean of course
I hope you don’t think I was projecting desires. I simply stated my opinion and offered TA to support it. I desire Botcoin to reach a million dollars, but there’s no TA to support it. 
You’re right, mean reversion is not a thing
Correct.

> Same entry

Didn't you entered at $9,426 with 3x leverage?
Well done.
I had thoughts of closing my long from $8,955 at break even to open another one with a better entry, but hell no!


Time traveler? You seem pretty sure about ten years from now. Agree about people on this sub trying to rationalize the irrational.
I'd say the falls act differently than the rises.  The rises start slow and build steam.  Then they go parabolic towards the end.  The drops work almost the opposite.  They are sharp and immediate.  The damage is done and then there's a slow bleed.  It certainly does not have a "climax" at the end.  The worst bear markets ended with a whimper not a bang.
I dont trade alts anymore
The problem with looking at 2013 is that 3 months wasn't the end of the bubble. It'd be much more like the run up from 1k to 5k then the drop back to 3k and 5 weeks before it continued back up.

The end of a bubble is marked by a *long* bear market. The previous bubbles were in 2010 and 2011 when bitcoin was an unknown quantity in the first place.

The copycats weren't known and there weren't scam coins at every other turn looking to get people's money.
Why do you think that other fractal is what will happen?
Fibs are surprisingly easy to learn how to use when you watch a couple of TA vids or read some articles.

In short, it's basically a diagonal line from lowest point to highest point of a particular move up/down.

They are a bit subjective though, and not always an exact science in portraying levels that have actual significance. 

Here's an example of mine on the Euro chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/DDG9rike/
I feel your struggle, but I'm very confident a little patience here will pay off. Even on the bull-run up to 20k we had retrace moments in heavy upwards (parabolic) movements. 

Be strong in these troubling times.
I'm not saying it's bearish in its own right, but we have been above it for just ˜4h, and even a slight retrace (which is likely considering the overheated RSI on all time frames and us being at the top of the wedge) would put us under it again, and possibly reinforce the 23.6% as resistance.
yeah i reconsidered. I loved the entry but i was overinvested. 
I cashed out with quick 3% profit. 

Added entries again from 9.3 > 9.2 for about 20% of my stack this time with same leverage. 

He's like a walking meta joke of himself
so why now ?
There is a lot of legit arguments against crypto and blockchains(just like p2p downloading), but it always amazes me who those old dinousaurs bring out the worst ones :D
Word.
Stack as in # of bitcoin I can buy. So if your equity goes up 10% but the price is up 11% then you can buy less 1% less bitcoin if you were to enter. I have been playing it conservatively so I am not getting 100% of the gains of this run.
bitcoin will literally never go down again, don't let wall street steal ur coinz
I mean.. we did pull back from 9750 to 9450 then from 9650 to 9400’s again ... 
11.5k double top was plenty fun
Shhhh don't say you watch 1 minute charts, they don't like them in here ;\)
Nah. They'll be fun when there's $500 minute candles on the regular again.
Huge media coverage when it passes 10k n more fomo
Seems like it doesn't really exist unfortunately. Consequently I'm considering programming a script to do this when I have time in the following weeks. If I do, I'll host the code as open source on Github and post a link. 
Ahh, thank you! I'll look into exactly how it works. 
I'm actually quite experienced at Python programming so this will probably be my next step. Just didn't want to reinvent the wheel so to speak. 
I agree we are due for a pullback. I'm mainly wondering if people "somewhat ignore" divergences during strong trends just like you need to recognize that RSI can run hot for a long time in a trend.

I know most people look at longer charts, but this divergence on the 15m is getting to be quite significant.
I also find that odd. I would think a lower RSI with ascending price would be bullish, but the market tends to act the opposite.
it's only a hidden bear div when we make a significant pullback I'd say a daily close below $7.8k and that would be validated
I told myself i would fomo if it breaks 9500 (brilliant strategy, right?..) Well here i am, longing bitcoin after it's already gone up 50% in a week.
A h&s head can be rounded, but the head I am looking at is the 6k V-bottom from february. We're now getting close to breaking above the right shoulder which is the confirmation level for a h&s failure. This failure pattern has a target of like 4k, so it will be nice to invalidate it. You're right though that we could form a double bottom if we break above the 11.7k level, makes that level even more important. Upside target would be around 17k, possibly.

It's false confidence though-  once we dip more than 2% people will freak the fuck out and there will be a cascade of selling. 

that's why these rises are so scary :/
I hope not.
[removed]
You're right, but this is another psychological thing to the mix, and the daily wasn't overbought yet. Fwiw, i'm scaling into a short from here, next add ~9.8k
yeah ive been trying to do the same and only now finally submitted to accepting that this in fact really is a legit uptrend. which probably means the bottom is going to completely fall away tomorrow or smth.
Well it has to come down some time.  I trade off Eliot waves and my rule is after the 3rd pump on the daily its time to sell.  Also the odds that it will keep going up and never correct back to at least 9.3k are very low.
being at the end of a giant bull run might have had something to do with that.
On what timeframe?

EDIT: Looks like you're referring to the 12h.
> the most retarded big red candle

One that bounces back to it's start position too, for extra pain.
But at the same time btc is what’s holding them up. If btc goes down so do the alts if that past means anything. 
I fought that exact mental battle. I just gave in at 8900.
Been watching this for over one week now and still not in position. Last couple of months programmed my brain to sell flatlining ascending wedges because they were inevitably short-lived dead cat bounces. Nowhere in this bullrun did I find a decent retracement to my liking so I'm just going to a) wait for healthy correction or b) fomo in at golden cross.

EDIT: remember protect your capital is more important than expanding it when you're clueless about market state:) Set stop loss and good luck!
Scary to think that is all it takes to make the public think "oh no. it's selling time". The exact inverse of what started this whole thing.
Not sure if serious, but the Gox trustee has sold all coins he has access too, at least until the next bankruptcy hearing (early Sept 2018 I believe). 
Where would you put a stop loss in this situation? It's *steep*.
https://www.tradingview.com/x/LeUu43q0/
> I believe a pullback will be fought for at 9.5k

It's taking it's sweet time getting there!
Let 'er ride! I'll live vicariously through you... :)
Right, but last year this happened a bunch of times, with a pullback (significant), then continue on. This is just crazy.

Once again, trying to explain bitcoin market behavior, not sure why I bothered typing this out. 
the fall from 11.6 to 7.8 in early march was way more "ridiculous"
I entered in my full fiat position a few weeks ago due to a pep talk from jarederaj  (he is the bomb). All profits from last year are locked up in 'traditional accounts' and only my initial investment is riding. So no margin long for me. 

But, I do swing from time to time and will buy the dip or sell some positions on crazy moves, which I avoid since I am a shitty trader.

Edit:if that came off as snarky, apologies. I respect your posts. 
I was looking at RSI posted earlier in the sub. I was merely using it as an example. Zooming out the 4 hour chart is just a lot of green, that is what I was getting at. Usually we correct absent news. 

Don't get me wrong, I am not short and am hoping for this puppy to keep going, but I am a bit nervous.

Borrowed from below:
Date	RSI	Price (roughly)
Today	76	$9,500
12/16/2017	75	$19,100
12/6/2017	89	$14,800
11/27/2017	82	$9,900
11/4/2017	79	$7,500
11/2/2017	82	$7,500
10/14/2017	88	$5,600
eh it almost always indicates an imminent correction or reversal. it can just last a bit  while chugging  along through divergences and stuff. 

Usually a big bearish divergence near 70 rsi indicates a reversal/correction 
Well in that case, party on, Wayne. 

Well then, as previously stated, party on, Wayne. Happy to be in my position. 

Velocity of growth is still crazy, w/o correction. I will point out though, if anyone wants a reality check on the growth of the entire eco system, list to the first 15 min of this podcast, just for the sake of perspective.

Thank you!!
100% this
Oh come on it’s not that irrational :) maybe overly optimistic. You can’t deny that this thing had plenty of chances to dump further since last visit to 6k but didn’t. 
Someone should make a frequency chart that measures sentiment for top-level comments. I think it's more split than you're describing here.
thanks
Source?

Cause if that's true, we should see the volume increase over exchanges but we haven't seen that.
Hope you’re right, but what evidence do you have to support this claim other than the price rising?
I think you may do ok...still braver than me... I was tempted to short as well, but will sit this one out
This time i think its a bad idea, its stuck to the upper bound. Most likely a BGD will bust through to 8650 destroying the wedge
Drivechains will come in time-- but I agree-- can't come soon enough.
Its been expected.
we hit it perfectly!
[deleted]
But no spinoff coin from the fork, so why would that create this massive rally?
[removed]
Ding ding ding. 
Yup. Not breaching 11.7 just means establishing a new log line below and boy oh boy can it get gross if we drop below 8.5.
when did you close your short?
I'd say 11.7 still king of resistance points. Breaking that signals the big bull. 
>It’s such a fucking joke that something as primitive as christianity still exists in the west in 2018. I’m hoping that at some point in the near future the government will just take christian’s kids away no questions asked. I have 0 respect for anyone who still believes in god with all of the scientific knowledge available at our fingertips.
Put a nail under one of my christian coworkers tires the other day when i was leaving work. One of those overly happy and annoying assholes. Always smiling, forcing small talk even at 830 am. Went as far as slashing the tires of a car at a house with a manger scene, but that was when i was younger. Probably shpuldnt be pulling shit like that with my wife and her kids depending on me lol.

Wow. Glass houses?
Spotted the lib. Jap isn't inherently racist, context is needed for it to be racist. He could easily have meant it as a shorter version for Japanese. Like Brit for British. 
when are you planning to short this insanity?

Ever notice how the die hard bears disappeared after that 1.5k green candle. Methinks they all got rekt
There was still many opportunities for a nice long on the way down, same goes for shorts on the way up
Yeah, that was me. Definitely don't be me.
I've been in this situation before, let the bullish sentiment get to my head and close my short at a big loss just minutes  before a giant red candle.

I don't want to be that guy again either.
Last time I was told I had big balls I lost 1k in 5 minutes.


The time frame stated seems logical, we might also break it sooner. 

But I am not sure why but something doesn't look quite right at $9,500.

I don't know why but I am sensing there is a dump waiting at that price. Or more likely, we will break up as we've been doing with other resistances in the past few weeks without a major pullback.
I was thinking the opposite. Less than 24hours ago I realized the possibility of hitting $10,000 today. Lets see how it goes, this wall at $9,500 will be taken down eventually.
I’m in the same situation with 8k.. I absolutely hate buying at these prices because we have rocketed so much recently.

I was scared to long at 8k with intentions 7k was inventible at some point, and I got burned. 

I’m now scared to long over 9k because In my mind a dip is coming, but the odds of this pulling back 12-15% right now is seeming less likely. 
My long position currently had a stop at 8990 for profit ( assuming we would bounce strong of 9k as that is the physiological barrier ) 
In a sense, isn’t that like trying to time the bottom? 


Although bitcoin is going much higher.. I think there will be another opportunity to buy at this price.  No need to FOMO.


Are you speaking of shorts or longs? 

I cant Short this anymore. Longing seems like ultimate play right now until it’s not. 

If anything, a short around 9800-10k would be a smart play but who knows anymore. A short at 8.4k was smart too 
yeah that's what I also thought, thx
yes, and bear flags are doing the opposite after a big green candle down, like this one
No edit to the post, but I’m not necessarily using TA as a judgement call to open my shorts.

Few reasons why I’m short here
-We have already broke through some major resistance points today and 9.5k being the next one I believe we may pull back a bit and consolidate before next move. 
-I made a decent profit off my long from 8.8k range ( still down in % all together) and I have the long Open from $9,313. If it blasts through 5k I’ll take a small loss  $50ish dollars but my long will keep me a float and cover losses
- If this goes to pound town ( probably won’t ) I want to ensure I have some type of short entry.

All in all, not playing with much risk here at all 
I’m not sure how much you risked, but the loss would be extremely small definitely an upside to shorting here 
agreed
you would have to make a continuous time indicator like "market sentiment" as a function of the amount of downvotes here
yeah, or thay. Precisely why I am not shorting it
especially because I was right, lol
Yes, good point.
How much is it worth? 
It was pulled and later replaced with 2 1.5 mill walls one dollar apart.

Holy time to fomo.
> what it feels like to be in a financial position to make a trade like that.

Stressful I guess. 
> That kind of money would be life changing.

It may not be that trader's money. Could very well be a prop desk at a private fund or larger institution.
Ah wow, didn't notice that very recently a previous green TD9 actually played out to a red retrace candle (though the TD didn't "complete" afterwards)
Proof? 
Im not saying he is right but OTC-markets are growing as long as they are liquid. There is only 21 million BTC so at some point people will have to buy on the open market, maybe.
So far all the way down to 9700!
this.

Got burned-ish shorting at the resistance line, and I’m done shorting this insanity
on the chart, right next to our current candle?
in the fuddsters' bottom
[deleted]
that is why I used "", I know that it does not matter in the end, because real Fiat is paid for every Bitcoin.

But I think manipulation starts when somebody is not buying for the cheapest possible price, but to buy to change the price and the market sentiment. 
Fair enough, patience is key! What I'm doing right now is stupid, trying to catch the *absolute* top, but I can't help get the feeling we're close. 
hey you were right! 

expand my brain, learning juice! 
im thinking that green candle 8900-9200 needs a mirror red candle soon

the big question is when to go back in..
Not trading on leverage right now. I was too late to long this run up for the corn, so I'm waiting for our retrace to consider going long for another potential run up. My ETH however isn't on margin
Right. Note, however, new users were actually a magnitude higher - 100,000 new users per day at Coinbase.
Yup, pretty much hit the nail on the head.

The trend is your friend, and betting against the trend is your enemy. 

Between January and early April, the most profitable strategy was to short the bounces. There were certainly opportunities to profit from bucking the trend and going long, but they were almost all short-lived. 

Between January and April 1st there were 0 consecutive green weekly candles. By and large, unless you longed the absolute local bottom, you only had a few days to open and close your long position in profit. Hold it any longer and it was underwater. 

This is not rocket science, and it's nothing revolutionary. But it can be hard to internalize, especially immediately following a trend reversal.


I think you've nailed it tbh.

Gonna try to switch from playing this as a bear market to playing it as an accumulation.

Knowing me, by the time i manage to adjust, we'll go from accumulation to bull lol.
Me too, I know it's frowned upon, but it gives a lot of information.
hmm....
So youre selling bitcoin at 9300 with the expectation that it will go down and you can buy it for cheaper and make money on the difference? Aka you expect it to drop back down?
Considering 75% of this sub is calling a new bull market and the daily is rife with posts about FOMO. I'd say it's a pretty good position.

Basically: Don't FOMO buy into this rally. Pick your spots as we will have plenty in the coming months. This thing isn't going to rally to 100k out of the blue
I see you also enjoy being right
How is that vague? I say if you're any more sure than that you're full of shit. Chopping in the 4k-12k range is probably the best prediction you're going to get. Those movements are pretty tame for crypto
I agree that it's a rocky climb, but hard to believe this isnt going to break 10k again.  Why not all in life savings with leverage and take a quick 30-50% profit and call it a year?  See you in Cancun.

I think Harvey will be very annoyed if we go parabolic 😂I mean he sat through $20k though so I'm sure he knows how to sit on his hands by now
It was about a 7% stack increase. Happy enough with that. I actually just re-entered with half the stack at 9290. Other half down at 9210, stops under 9150. 9400 was an obvious profit-taking point, but the drop was bought ferociously. I'm not sure this thing is done yet. 
Plus it happened before Easter(right?)...yall know what comes next 
Jesus man, that really puts the overbuying into perspective.
I think so too.  My SL ladder goes from 9350~9250.
Would certainly feel a lot better about this growth after a decent pullback and then further upwards.
Something like this: https://www.tradingview.com/x/Q0sfZyUe/

A good entry most of the times allows you a good nights sleep.
[deleted]
Envious of you. I bought back in eth completely at 385 because I knew it was a steal at that price. But I got greedy and thought bitcoin was going to take another tumble. Sold for breakeven and the rest is history. That one trade would have made my year for me.
[deleted]
Is it worth it?
try 4000s
Pls
This feels like the 9400 resistance. It was there until it wasn’t and it only took around 8 hours for demand to outweigh support. Now it’s turned into support. 
It'll be a game of hot potato soon enough.
Just like we would never breach 9100? You are a broken clock which happened to be right the last few months. Not anymore.
Fair enough! Will be more detailed in the future. Also I'm glad you're trying to raise the quality level, keep it up!
if you're american go with futures you get 60/40 treatment

Bitifinex is reviewing my documents three months already lol
So why don't their trading pairs show USDT but rather USD? Seems deceptive.

Edit: need a definitive answer so I can start my project. 
you take your mod role a bit too strict.
Might be a dumb question, but isn't it less important since it's *descending* support? We briefly tested the rising trendline from Sept low through 6k...a retest of that line would be around 8700.

EDIT: To expand, wouldn't testing that line again as support achieve the same bullish objective without having to drop down 12%?
All I keep thinking is if it goes up this quick...
New ATH soon?  lol Bitfinex isn't very busy printing Tether since they been subpoenaed ( talking about manipulation!! ) so i don't expect new ATH's this or next year , maybe if they start the print billions of USDT a month again so they can prop up the price.
Sorry, does this mean you think we go considerably higher if we break 9500, or expect a heavy retrace at 9500?
It runs on 15 minute timeframe and makes around 3-4 trades per day, win percentage ranges form high 60s to high 70s, trading a constant amount of usd for each position from January 1st it made 340% profit, 400 trades, 76% wins, 2.6 profit factor, 8.5% max drawdown, and average trade was 0.86%. 
Make money on the volitility instead.
Yup. I followed his short with exactly entry + adds up to 7950 with a CA of 7920 ish with 100% of my stack.

Thanks Chew 
I think for month or even months, chewie has been predicting all the moves 
I know which comment you speak of. That was terrifyingly spot on.
Link?
It's just a coinhive script. Are you not using an adblocker?
I'd think those hidden bull divs played out with the most recent pump.

Would look for more to form if we do pull back somewhat here. With the valley this pull back would create being the initial state.
I try to let the data speak for itself instead of “looking for” anything in particular 
Sorry on mobile, but it’s the two peaks around 9k and 9.4k. RSI decreases across those peaks while being clearly in the overbought range. 
Compare the RSI at the initial pump to 8.8k to the RSI at the most recent 9.4k pump.
smh what? Price is up almost 50% on BTC in the last couple weeks for basically no reason when the hype is dead, meanwhile so many garbage coins and even BCC have gone up over 100%. Great time to take gains and wait for the inevitable drop.

EDIT: https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=bitcoin

Bitcoin search interest hasn't even gone up since the ~50% increase this month. Nobody cares, obviously no good reason for it to have gone up and I doubt it will continue much further.
Suggesting the next one is going to be much larger with no rebound?
How else can one be prepared for the *impending* $1 million candle though? Lmao. I agree stretch it out.
Thanks man, how can I do this?
[removed]
Shhhh, this doesn't fit the narrative. 
How often will the altcoin thread renew? By the title I assumed it was a daily. 
BTC is Dead Coin Walking.  Many alts will survive, which is not surprising because there are literally thousands of them and new ones with new tech created often.  Bitcoin is quickly becoming a dinosaur.

But this is a trading sub and BTC is a good speculative trading asset, just not a great long-term investment at this point.
There are better ways to communicate this. Poor guy already got a day in the sin bin. Build him up :)

Rule 1
Bitcoin dictates the market but alts grow and shrink at much faster rates. My alts have gone up 30% in the past week where BTC is around 10%ish.
it's true.  But there's no free lunch either.  Round trip US to china, even at speed of light is an uncomfortable delay.  And trustless systems always seem to end up trusting something.  I think trust and locality are just fundamental to the universe.

with that logic you could say don't go long because everyone from last year is still underwater or liquidated.
Yes

Not they, just someone. Manipulate it up and then dump. My opinion, don't get too hung up on this.

I have no clue. I don't understand the public's interest (supposed interest, obviously the numbers are inflated to some significant degree). I don't understand the appeal of secondary money coins, other than maybe a testnet of sorts (LTC) and a privacy coin (XMR). The whole smart contract thing baffles me and these various ICO tokens are just absurd. I think this space is due for a serious overhaul at some point and the garbage will fall to the wayside. Newcomers to this space have no clue what they're trading, they just want to get rich and know that hype and manipulation are going on, they just want to extract money from in, so they try to play along. I have to imagine most people get burned this way. Lots of examples of all sorts of fuckery in crypto. 

This sub has a warped perception because it is trading focused. I just encourage people to really think about 

1. Why does this blockchain/token exists (is there actual utility or pure hype)

2. How does the coin actually perform the function it claims to? Is the coin actually required to accomplish said goal? 

3. Is this actually needed / better than legacy systems?

4. Who stands to benefit from the hype?

I think the natural conclusion is that most are entirely scams or hype that will be pump and dumped by the markets. Some of these valuations are just completely absurd and everyone knows it deep down.

Me, I'm a simple folk, I'm just interested the grits. 


Ah right, cheers
I guess my confusion mostly stems from your assertion that there's no long pole warning at the moment, yet there are 2 unresolved long poles that have formed within the past 2 weeks. 

To me it would be as if there was an avalanche warning on the 13th and again on the 21st. Nothing has changed to reduce the likelihood of an avalanche...but at least there's not a new 3rd warning. 

If that's the case, I'd argue that you should place more emphasis on the two unresolved poles than you have. Because the likelihood of a significant retrace doesn't necessarily go down just because there's no new long pole warning to issue.

Oh, look, a shiny new indicator on Moon Math:

Hope we can share a beer on that flight :)
I'd be surprised too. This is the flippantly hopeful place where I reveal my bias, though. Please don't rain on my parade, man. Trying to have a good time here.
I've actually never been; I really need to take a trip.
Yeah it's normal and good actually. You want to see lower volume when you are in a downtrend. 
I'm not too bullish on the edge-to-edge trade on the 1d chart just yet. But that's one trade strategy, but a few other signals need to confirm first (e.g. tenkan/kijun cross)

The trade that's currently on the table is the "kumo breakout" on the 12h chart. That is, we broke out above cloud (bullish signal) along with two other bullish signals; tenkan/kijun cross, and lagging span breaking above the cloud as well.

i plan to life savings all-in with first buy then max out my margin with subsequent buys, that's about as DCA as i get.  I'd love a dip here but I dont think we'll get a chance.


what happened there? DK was a little rough around the edges, but I thought he was a good contributor sometimes
Though I enjoyed his posts and like him, his posts would plant seeds of cheerleading/tribalism precedent and a root source of noise.  So we'd still have to strictly keep the "hurr durr mah bears/bulls" shit out but I'd like to see him back too.
Actually that doesn't do you enough justice.

If BTC moons, I'll totally move the family to Switzerland lol
Real question though, do they know you are and ask you questions to 'get in on the action' or something? It's always an awkward topic for me.
I don't think there's any sort of realistic chance we see new ATHs soon, and I really doubt big players will so easily drive the price down and sell their coins for so cheap when it's easy to sell them higher by driving  the price up first. 

I'm sure the dudes are smart and know how many times they can frustrate and liquidate traders before they give up. One more go around and I'd say most of that new volume on mex will give up and exit the space. 

Most traders are fucking terrible, there's *no* way all that new volume is a bunch of decent traders making money. They're all slowly losing it and will cash out eventually
Well this is my theory. Those who wanted to cash out have sold heavily during the past 3-4 months. These people think we are in a 2-3 year bear market and this is just another DCB. They are already sitting FIAT, they don't want to buy b/c they are bearish so they lend it. This is why rates are so low, there is a fuckload of FIAT sitting in peoples' accounts b/c they've already sold.

If this was indeed a reversal and we go back to 10k+, 12k+, etc over the next few weeks/months, they will start taking their FIAT out of lending and start buying back in. This is when we will see new ATH and higher rates, and since borrowing will be more expensive, the futures premium will start going up again. 

You are right that this is a good time to leverage up and take the cheap futures, *if you are a bull* I think a lot of people are still of the opinion we are at the start of a bear market, so even though price is rising, they don't care, they have just decided to sit in FIAT and lend until 2-3k. 

Personally, I am long futures like I said a few days ago in my post because I agree with you it is a great opportunity if we remain bullish, but I don't know whether this is a true reversal or DCB. 

I still maintain that there will not be a premium until we are close to the ATH (15-17k) or making new ATHs simply because all the FIAT sitting on the lending books won't FOMO back in until then.
Yes, that's the best way. I'll always keep those above 250 moving forward.

Considering the size of that position, all in all a success and good risk management and profit locking IMO.  And considering that it happened while you were away, it's still a good plan even in hindsight, because we could have dumped lower!  All in all a good plan that was well executed.

You seem to know what you you gotta do. 
I sorta relate to you in a way. I've only been frequenting this sub since late Feb, I just got tired of the echo chamber circle jerks that are other crypto subs **ahem** ethtrader and the like. 

Since I've been coming to this sub my crypto knowledge and gains have only gone up! There are very educated people here, noobs like us are lucky :)
lol, I meant the losses are the tuition fees of trader university.
Yeah we are having people buy real coins and less margin now. This is looking pretty serious, i peed got an alert on my phone that btc dropped, got finished peeing it was right back where it was. 
It had to be able to drop bellow 9000 to start triggering some stops, at least a huge drop to 8500 or so to leave recent longs underwater and a massive drop bellow 8000 to really get things going.
It's not going to get there with 500 or 1000 coin market sells this time...
The lates drops seemed to be cascading, as if someone was checking where the resistance was instead of dropping all at once
You’re making some awesome scalps. I should probably be doing the same 
Haha I know I hear ya. Just pointing out that personally I think signal wise this is looking pretty bullish. Could be a little bias sneaking in there on my part tho.
Who gives a shit about price if liquidity is falling?

Without liquidity, you'll never be able to exchange those numbers on your computer screen for *anything* else.
Collectibles are almost always related to how they look or because they're *unique* and can be displayed. Bitcoin is neither displayable nor unique. The price is almost always 100% made up and resell value is usually significantly less than what is paid for.

Examples: cars, art, baseball cards, memorabilia

All of those are meant for display purposes.

Crypto's are being treated almost exactly like diamonds except that we know those are pretty much worthless and only held up in price because people are dumb as dirt (though that's slowly changing thanks to good reporting on the De Beers diamond cartel).

At least with a diamond, however, you can show it off. If you show off your bitcoin balance, nobody will care.
We're all still talking about buying/selling whole coins.  8 decimal places will provide the liquidity it needs when it needs to be used as a currency.
Yes.
Higher ratio means there's less cash in there and therefore less liquidity.
Game on!
I salute you for having the nuts to go long at such a high price point. 
'Buyers' or Spoofy bot?
Pffff, i remember having to cut and weld my own cpus. Kids these days don't know the struggle. 
HA!

Back when floppy disks were... actually floppy.

Damn, the nostalgia.
True but it is a factor.  I think the bigger thing is to consider how much total crypto is mined each day.  Eventually prices get high enough and more is created and there is a massive imbalance.  the big question of course is if there is a lot of new money entering.  It appears so at the moment.  We need that to drive this machine to stupid heights again.  
Good on you! Always have an exit plan for your positions and manage that risk. Stay safe!
Good point. Many of the resident bears went long after than candle. And they still believe deep down that this is going to 3k
bears will be selling then going short the whole run up.  That will provide the fuel.


bullshit, half of this run has been bears getting liquidated on margin because they're in denial of this run-up. they'll FOMO in at the tail-end of the bull run. 
biggest indicator to me is waning volume, however volume has been consistently increasing as we go up. thats a major bullish sign, all TA aside. once consolidation hits and volume dries up, i'd be worried of a nasty correction. all things are looking good however, i expect we break through 10k in a few days or we've found our top and continue on the downtrend. i'm more bullish however.
I see, thanks.
But yell it:

EOOOOOOOOOOOOOSSSSSS
tezos
Yeah look, point taken, but buying LTC holding it into a pump and then selling while you are still ahead is of course perfectly sensible.

But there's a big difference between thinking "I'm going to pick up 1000 XRP because that shit is down 40% and is due for a pump" and "I'm all in on ripple it's the future of crypto with backing from major backs etc blah!"
> expecting a pull back to 9k first

Wouldn't that take us back through support and make 9200 resistance?
RSI is scalding on most timeframes and rightfully so. That said, I’ve taken to the strategy of hodling and turning off RSI for the time being. I know I tend to chastise “just a feeling” posts, but from everything I’ve read in the news about regulation progress and adoption by major trading firms, it just feels insanely bullish right now. All I do now is move my Stop up whenever in has another BGD. 

I firmly believe we will have a retracement at some point, but right now it’s doing weird shit. 
Added more at 9740. 

Feeling better than I did at the 9500 short 
I am with you 100% but Ive been HODLING since 2013 but I could have secured a lot of profit had I actually started shorting last time BTC was at its ATH of 20k instead of just HODLing. I know 30k is coming but we will also have retraces on the way up to that where you can increase your  overall HODLings if you time it right. I dunno Im only playing with a small amount  of my total stack to see how it goes.
Hope you decided to stay up a few extra minutes.
So.... *buy*?
Interesting. I suppose this is the critical moment we're all waiting for.
I mean given that the 4 hr one has over a 10% difference in bottoms on a ~33% max move I'm not overly confident in that one. 

Otherwise I agree there are certainly reasons to be bullish and obviously to buy in before then. Just saying the 11.8k A&E bottom is nothing but squiggles on a chart up to this point. Would be a very strong signal *IF* it confirms.
Honestly, hopium sucks and leads to doing stupid things with money. Sure it's emotionally fun but like emotions can lead to bad decisions. Best to keep them out of that arena if you can. Being rational/realistic is good. 

And that's not to say realistic doesn't have to involve insane moon gains because there's precedence for BTC going crazy so sometimes being crazy *is* paradoxically rational. Just saying if you're trying to chart patterns the 11.8k A&E bottom isn't formed yet so means nothing so far.
The pattern site, literally the same source you posted lol.
Ok I had not heard of the double version before, interesting, thanks
You're probably right. Looking at a longer term chart though the two moves look very similar so far. 

What reminds me the most though is when we went sideways in the 8k range for like a week before thanksgiving where some/most people were expecting a retracement that never came. This time we've had a lot of that sideways movement and just moved up again after each.
I think this is the next bull run.
Markets like these rarely adhere to personal opinions or "beliefs" (ask the twitter TA guys). Infact, they nearly always do the complete opposite of what YOU are logically thinking. So yes, this very well maybe the start of a protracted bull run of epic proportions. And all things considered (big banks opening trading desks, the whiff of an ETF approval, the likes of Soros announcing their presence, retail FOMO'ers such as Dan and more to mention) this will moon in the next few months. However on the flipside, a few "TA" gurus on twitter have drawn some colorful lines and they say Bitcoin will follow these lines and crash to near zero. They are mostly using fractals and are basing 99% of their predictions on the 2013 crash when Bitcoin and Namecoin were being mentioned in the same breath.
Oh, okay, thanks for clarifying. From here that would bring us up to $10,000 and then see us retrace down to about $8,500. It seems reasonable I guess.



I also see us bouncing up and down violently, especially within this past hour, what do you make of that?
How frequently are people reporting? I’m curious to know
Really, that's the objective of the alt thread. It's supposed to be a broader array of market analysis that still relate back to Bitcoin.

Your contribution here is the archetype of what we'd like to see there.
I think he's saying it'd improve the alt thread is all
Which exchange is that?

Edit- never mind. You’re talking about tether.  
> Bitcoin exchange is accused for fraud , they are still under investigation

if you're talking about Bitfinex receiving a subpoena, that's quite a stretch to come to that conclusion
quote me literally if you wanna talk
Trying.
Funding may eat your profits if you let it ride

Start switching from swaps to Sept futures using limit orders (limit sell on swaps, limit buy on futs) and let it ride IMO. Also, lower your leverage, since you would get liquid at a 4% move
If you're into trading pure random noise, who am I to judge...
A refreshing POV
There isn't that new money like there was. There is scared money and there are people trying to recoup some of their losses, and there are people that are going to sell as soon as they see a bump in the road.
It is hard to listen to the bullshit that it must be hard. It is really much harder to hodl while reading opinions of gambling smallcoiners than just hodl and focus on something else. That is the trick. It is like being Texan who has to listen that his yard is just a shitty yard worth of nothing.
well at some point a buncha texans had to endure the alamo to get that land.  Or they had to save $$ to buy it from those that did.


this is how we got to 20k so fast though, right?
When? There have always been pullbacks. 
"This time it's different" - oh wait, that's only supposed to be about bubbles popping.
12.5k, 16k, 25k
Because they tethered at bottom. 
That's actually a really good point.

You'd probably have to capture video... Hrm. Going to approve. 
I really highly doubt it goes to $8k after $14k. That's not maximum pain, it just doesn't make sense. If anything, that'd be less pain, because it'd allow more people to get in lower

Max pain is getting rejected from $12k and going to $3-4k. 

there would be no way we get to $14k and then suddenly decide to retrace unless it's a blow off top to there.

I'm basing this all off of what 2014 did 

maybe I need to be looking at 2016 now
I am praying for a cool off. And I am agnostic. 
Naw I think we reasonable ones expect and would welcome a cool off consolidation. But the book was primed to shoot to 9.8 and with a little FOMO who knows.

But if this is in fact, and it is time we accept the possibility that it is indeed a reversal, retraces aren't going to be as often or violent. 11.7 continues to be the number to watch. Til then, we still not out of the woods. 
That's a verrrrrry good point. 

It's just that nagging temptation to try and catch the right moment you know?

Buy the dip seems like the smart thing to do.
Say it dips to $8500 like you postulate.  That's a $900 drop if you're right.  If you're wrong and it continues upwards $900 will seem like a drop in the bucket.  Reward outways the risk of a long at this point IMO.
Okay true, as long as the premium between the futures and the swaps isn't too high.
Okay thanks, didn't know that.
They show your Total Balance, which includes all of your Currencies, and then your available trade balance, which are you collateral currencies which can be used for Margin trading (BTC, ETH, USD, EUR, CAD and JPY)

Each of their currencies has a different fee schedule, take a look at their help section, but the maker/taker fees are a % of the trade. The more volume you trade the less the fees.

I am not sure if there are minimum trade amounts for each currency pair, but there probably are.
You can, but you have to be Tier 2 verified and then you have to activate it on the Funding page.
You and me both. :'(

> And bitcoin doesn't go up forever

The 16 year olds on /r/cryptocurrency would strongly disagree!
> You would expect 5 figs to act as some sort of psychological resistance...

It hasn't yet. Somewhat surprisingly, we've just blown through $10k from each direction pretty much every time we've come near it.
Great call. 
Thank you. I think I'm going to hold on to my long, mostly based on breaking up from the wedge and this dip (9750->9500) didn't seem particularly out of place - not even back into the wedge. I recognize that we're coming up on 10k as a mental resistance (took us 5 tries and 2 days to get through 9k) so I will probably decide to exit closer to 10k.
will you go long from 9000 hoping to exit at $11k? (Stop loss at 8600 so $2k potential gain vs $400 potential loss)
Of course. I was wondering what changed his mind.
Well said.
Lol this made me laugh. 
Yes! Target, may I ask? 
perfect.
short on being excellent too? jk
Yeah I'm planning on shorting from $9.6-9.8 and I'm starting to think I should very tight stops on it or just not bother at all with shorting until $11k 
Yeah the fall appears nearly as parabolic.
u rich?
Ah, you’re reading the wrong posts. There’s some really great dudes in here. Starting to feel more and more like early 2017 again if you ignore the shitposts.

Look at the Altcoin daily. Holy cow, I’m so impressed

‘#WallStreetOfCrypto
I got my bitcoin at $30. It can go down to $1000 and I'm still up a shitload. By saying things like I "got rekt", I can just imagines the tens of dollars you have invested.
I'd argue that TA is a reflection of traders' desire to limit upside and downside risk by applying a consensually-defined framework to an inherently chaotic system.

No attacks here.
yes sounds resonable
I did, closed on the dip before and opened a long at 9313.

Just re opened a short 
It feels good.
I'm not a time traveler but there's extensive analysis on which coin is staged for the highest probability of success. It is not Ethereum; their scaling problems are being underestimated. It's not Cardano; it's too optimistic. It's not NEO because it's a centralized scam. 

Is it Bitcoin? Yes. It does one thing simple and it does it extremely well: store-of-value. Scaling resolution isn't a matter of if, it's simply when. Even if Bitcoin's chances of becoming the mantra of digital store-of-value are extremely low (let's say 5%), the fact that the lower range of 28x of current prices gives it a positive expected value and a worthy investment at a scale an investor should feel comfortable losing.
The world's longest recorded living bear was Debby, a female polar bear born in the Soviet Union at some point in 1966. She died on November 17th 2008 in Canada at either age 41 or 42.
So you're pretending 60%+ of the market doesn't exist. Crypto is like 10 years old and it already has old people who can't handle shiny new things.
I mean sure, you could be right. But on the other hand, I don't consider anything that isn't 10-25x the power of ten of the round of the last bubble to be a bubble. So, I only consider $10, 100, 1000 etc to be bubbles. This past bubble therefore followed suit at about 19x of the 1000 power-of-ten round down of the bubble before it by topping out at around 19k, definitely going over 10k and never falling below 1k.

So from that perspective, I don't see the 1k as the top of that bubble. I see it as a separate bubble from the 100 bubble.

People were shouting "this time it's different because x y and z" near the top of what I now consider to be the 10k bubble. I'm going to disagree with your unknown quantity theory and say we will keep seeing the same pattern for at least one more bubble, probably two. A failure of the pattern can only really be caused by no more money pushing hard into the market, even speculatively. We'll reach a point soon where even I will get scared as it reaches heights higher than traditional investments and companies at which point it will be the last bubble due to nothing new coming in after the crash. Then perhaps it becomes a normalish market? Who knows. 


That said, who knows if this is the lead up to a real run for the next bubble. This could turn out like 100 to 1000 or it could very well go into limbo for another 3 years. 
I don't know, in all honesty. It's just a gut feeling that I have. I got into BTC end of October 2013. Surely, that colours my view. Probably, my brains sees patterns just because it's wired to do so.

A trailing stop is not what you were looking for, but it could bandaid to sort of work. You'd be at decent risk of getting stopped out before you wanted to. What you'd *really* want is a trailing stop with a trigger. This is not an option that I know of. 
Yes, last week was a perfect example.
Since the daily RSI is already higher than it was at 11.7 though, wouldn't we need to peak higher than that before a pullback in order to avoid bearish divergence on the daily?
Don't worry, i'm sure lots more people are going lunatic on their buy orders right now. (me included)
lol
1D
Honestly, I'm just gonna wait. I've been burned too many times chasing trades. I think this is my brain testing me.

I'm not in fiat at least, so i'm along for the ride one way or another :)
For traders in our position, it is most likely the safest call. Until I see a new entry, I'm waiting for the market to make its next move. 
Trail your stop with the rise. I wouldn't even set a stop below profit line unless something drastic happens.
$9200 wouldn't be a terrible stop, but it's definitely in the range of might get triggered just to head right back up again, maybe $9k if you want to leave a little space for that and risk of more loss.
I keep refilling my long as we go up as it takes profits, while manually lifting a SL ladder around my CA.  It just won't stop!

This is a situation to take what you can get and don't ride your position at all negative.
Ok, with that one i agree. If it breaks upward then the upper one starts to make sence. 
yes, but that is bullish, because we may just shoot right through it
It's not supposed to be a competition :)
RSI rising to above 70 as it did early last fall is different than it falling from its peak (around 92) to below 70.  Not all RSI numbers should be looked at the same way.

It does mean that price is moving fast.  It does make some sense to feel "nervous" and you should pay close attention.  If you bail as soon as the price starts moving fast, you will miss some huge gains.  But when it starts to slow back down, you don't want to be the last to take profit or short if that is your thing.  So the pattern is sort of fast, faster, super fast, fast.... you want to sell the second fast, but probably hold and maybe even buy the first fast.  Both have the same RSI value.
You can't have a divergence until there is a top formed.  The divergence isn't when RSI first reaches 70.  Nothing is really indicated by that.  It's just like people who call a double top whenever we hit a new high before any real pullback, or the head and shoulders calls super early.  It's fine to try to anticipate a pattern, but it's best if you at least realize what the real pattern is and when it actually exists.

The lasting a bit before rolling over with respect to the daily RSI has been huge with bitcoin.  Just take a look.  Shorter timeframes look different, but the larger timeframes see a lot of price action after crossing into overbought.  Shorting when daily RSI first hit 70 from below would have been one of the worst trading strategies you could possibly create over the past 18 months.  It looks like it would have been instaREKT almost every time.
Note that there are other upward-sloping lines that could come in to play, if you believe the 20K was a blow-off top. We could re-enter the original log channel, which I believe is up over 11K. Or it could serve as resistance. But at this point, horizontal/historical resistance lines probably carry the most weight, especially if they coincide with fib retrace lines.
Nothing. Just a rumor that fits what is happening and isn't unbelievable . And while they aren't public, they involve a lot of people so it isn't exactly secretive. 
Realistically if you short here ( kraken ) at 9460 with stops at 9515 it’s not a terrible loss if you close. Could play out profitable if we dip hard 
May move a short a little closer to the 9500 range with super tight stops. 
It took me a few weeks practice to get used to the illiquid futures on Bitmex, compounded by the lack of bandwidth of their trading engine.
Speculation, greed, coincidence? Who knows. 
It is a protocol update which increases usecases.
It is still offtopic.
hit close at $7.4k closed it at $8k because bitmex ui is retarded and I couldn't focus on hitting "market" instead of "close" with a big  Green dildo in my ass

felt terrible closing it there but doesn't look so bad now lol 

unhedged and technically long from $8780  after unsuccessfully trying to short (with a pretty small position) $8.3-8.7k 
Is that one of that guys comments? Holy shit lol good call out
lol relevant username 
I am either going to long between $7.8- $8.5 or short $9.8, whichever comes first. I'm very tempted to short this now but being patient has paid off so I'm waiting 

I'm not interested in holding a short underwater for long though, will have stops 2-4% above. 
bears are done.  It's time to go up.  This is guaranteed $$ right now just all in long with some leverage and quick double here, then re-evaluate.


Experience goes a long way I guess, you probably don't have your entire stack riding on this either
ETH is almost at 100% from the bottom. It will be a great place to reap profits and that might slow BTC a bit.

God... if you’re right about 10k *today*... idk what I’d do. That would mean I am breaking even on my investment that I bought in December (Bought at 17k, dollar cost averaged down, average is currently around 10k). That would be awesome.
I always rather call the bottom than the top.

I hedged at the log line because that was the sane thing to do. Done shorting until it’s time to cash out to be honest.
agreed
Lol yeah with my ladders of buys and sells, it could describe either

Maybe next time I'll use paragraphs to increase readability:

>  Long from 8.8 and two smaller rungs have taken profit already at 9.1 and 9.3.


Btw, I did have one short ladder fill also around 9.3, but I've closed that at break even because I feel I can get a higher start than that.  Near 10k I have a few *tiny* short offers waiting.
Aaaand I totally misread your post. 
I'm on the sidelines waiting for a wire to clear..  There's bound to be SOME kind of dip here to clear out the FOMO'ers.. i know you don't short here.. but do you load up on the dip?

depends on the leverage.  50k - 5 million
https://www.ccn.com/circle-otc-cryptocurrency-trading-100-million/
Proof? It's simple logic. You cannot buy/sell $100 million on an exchange without destroying the order books. Remember the ETH flash crash to $.10 last summer on GDAX? That was only $12 million market sell. $12 million is a drop in the bucket for large fund managers. 

Yeah I had 3 failed shorts since our attempts on 9k began.  (and two failed longs too actually) Thankfully they were well managed from a risk perspective and the SL on the current long covers for most of those losses.

Maybe will start scaling into a short when we go a bit higher, but scaling in very very gently, and smaller than the long.
what the living shit am i looking at
But that isn't manipulation and can be explained by normal market movements. 

I mean, in bitcoin. Not the classic alts pump and dumps .
That's reasonable. 
Went half in LTC
Plot twist: You're both wrong. McAffee's dick is safe.
I'm not saying I'm more sure. I'm saying your 50% confidence band is absurdly wide and frankly, useless. Let's suppose, for argument's sake that every price point for BTC is equally likely, and I'm going to do away with conditional probabilities since they're next to impossible to formalize here. At the moment, the lifetime price boundaries for BTC are 0 on the low end and 20K in the high end. Assuming that all price points are equally likely implies we have a uniform distribution on [0, 20]. You saying that the price will chop between 4-12 has a probability of 8/20 = 0.4. You tell me how useful that is... You're basically covering half of the possible probability support, which is not very useful in this case. 
Because this is insane?

It's a house of cards waiting for the smallest breeze to collapse the entire thing.
yep. I remember he said he was building a short after Christmas at 15k and I thought it was crazy. Turns out he didnt overleverage, just 1x short to collect funding. Smart

Anyone naked shorting with leverage is insane IMO
I'm inclined to agree. The 4hr has that 'drop' as the thinnest candle imaginable now, just pure wick. Shook a lot of people out of their positions both ways I'd imagine. In a completely mad world we could stay in this wedge all the way up to test 9800.
Thanks!

Looking like an anemic shoulder.
It could be valid. Just wanted to encourage you to post your own TA.
I would love to make money off the local tops and bottoms, but it's way to stressful for me so I just go with the midterm trends. I commend you for having the patience to trade on these shorter time frames
Just wake up. I call it Bitcoin Insomnia. 
Its the former lol. I actually try to increase my probability of waking up at random times through the night by strategizing my sleeping patterns. This is also devotion. haha.

I only set alarms when I am awake and away from trading, just to keep me updated with price movements. 
Maybe not for now , but i'm convinced we will stay in the bear market. This bull run is based on zero fundamentals / news and 100% fraud, the last time BTC was overvalued like this the price was around 19/20K. 
I guess that explains why this place is so quiet when so much is happening.  Not complaining, just saying I get it now.
Actually yes, that's a very good point. It absolutely would, and an ascending support line is of significantly better use. We rode the descending log line as support after breaking it in 2014, though, which was the basis of my thought process.
I'm also hoping for a (successful) retest of this ascending line through 6k at around 8.7.

The log downtrend line is dropping so quickly that, as haserfauld also said, going down to retest it could be disastrous. 
I expect 9500 to be the line in the sand where we either pump to 11.8k or with little to no resistance or where we show the market that the bear hasn’t gone into hybernation just yet
He was getting pooped on in the low 5 digits for a bit ($11-13k I think it was) but came back strong as hell. 

I think there's actually a comment I posted a bit back where I said I thought he was going to start doing really well again cause btc was trending instead of choppy. 

wish I could long chew/btc, I'd be rich 
he posts here a lot, reddit.com/u/_chewtoy_

I mean this could certainly go up but the guy has a wonderful grasp on this market and knows when to jump in and get out of the way
You're clearly looking for something tho :) 

Don't get too carried out, RSI is overbought because, well, people are in a frenzy buying. Not much else to conclude. 
The hype is always late. Set a stop profit just below the last dip and let it run tbh
If nobody cares why are the dips being bought up so rapidly along with the fairly rapid increase of price. Pretty sure most seasoned traders are anticipaiting/waiting for a propper correction to get into a solid long position. I think there is real fomo at the moment and I only see it intensifying if we keep ploughing threw key resistance levels.
Do you see that stickied post at the top of this thread? Alt discussion has its own thread. Yes, we are aware that alts have been pumping. Many of us also trade alts. We get it, you’re having a great week. We talk about Bitcoin trading in here. There’s a whole thread dedicated to trading alts. 
I don't disagree, I just wouldn't advocate taking a significant risk on catching ***the*** *correction* rather than the 2 dozen little ones we've had.
Uncheck auto in the bottom right part and slide the price range just above to adjust.
Some charts let you adjust range by hovering on the price axis and scrolling with mouse wheel.
The thread says every 72 hours.
Rule 1. Please read up on factionalism and demagoguery. One day in the sin bin.
In my opinion any "bitcoin is dead" post if Bitcoin is not actually dying (hacked algorithm, or something like that) should be an insta-bannable offense.

You're either:

- A troll

- A shill for an alt/scam

- Completely and absolutely clueless

We don't need people like that in here.

I often hear this mainly coming from altcoin communities but when it comes to real world usage the numbers all speak for themselves, I honestly don't get where this "dinosaur" opinion comes from outside of some theoretical future among the backdrop of many. The best two things you have going is Bitcoin dominance slipping again and the fees back in December, both of which still point to Bitcoin still working effectively and the best chance of survival against any real future threats
Yes that was a little harsh, I need to take the high-road, good point. 
Oh I agree, I'm not hating on alts and use them to gain more BTC for the most part and keep a selective few.   But to say alts have overtaken BTC is ridiculous.   The alts drop the hardest when BTC drops, BTC is the only safe haven during a big bear market and dictates the prices overall.    Yes if you want to select the past week you can say alts are amazing, if you want to select 90% of the market time, BTC runs the show still. 
Aulico, that’s a bold prediction.  It seems like there isn’t much selling pressure in the 6’s.  3800 was your earlier prediction.  Have you changed your mind? 
RemindMe! 1 month
You need to show it. Show evidence for the claim. At least draw a chart in MS paint. Put your back into it, man.

Oh I meant on today's column.  So its a timeframe thing:  We could keep moving up on this pole further today and tomorrow, plenty of room for that.  But we are likely to retrace back down and resolve those old poles sometime in the next few weeks.
Alright man, I’ll share a beer with you on the flight, [but you’re going to have to sit next to Brian Kelly](https://i.imgur.com/hLK8Zz9_d.jpg?maxwidth=1200&shape=thumb&fidelity=high) ;)

you're kidding\-trolling, right?
I've been busy and haven't been here. I knew it was quite peaceful around here I guess the bull run made him go insane because he was convinced we'd see 2k btc and shit talked himself into a coma? I had no idea he was banned though. 
I can provide a list of 10 rule 1 violations since I started. He can come back, but he's on vacation (probably using a different account).
Literally standing in front of the Swiss National Bank walking my dog with a view of the lake and mountaons in the background!

You’re welcome at my place any time
most of my friends have known about Bitcoin through me since 2011 or 2012 and most of them have a handful from back then. They trade regular assets, not Crypto. Except one
for me my friends know I trade. Some are in crypto, some aren't. Some even traded with me throughout the giant bull run last year and it was good fun, but they don't seem to be as into it as me. To each their own :)
But if they think we're in the early part of a bear market, they should be *selling* into this rise. That's not happening.
Thank you sir. It was about a 7% gain on total stack, which I'll happily take. 
Yeah I got wrecked (not really, but took a loss) trying to short $8.3. let's hope I make some back. 

I doubt we see $15k then $8k but we could see $11k before $8k for sure 
Woops. Deleted comment 
yeah that's like my point
Most of us who sold are looking for a retest and confirmation of 9-9.2 as support or a larger pull back to really confirm some other resistance turned support while the oscillatory indicators cool off.

Going parabolic with no significant pullback this soon is not a good sign for a sustainable run imo.
Except that we don't know how many diamonds there are. 
The way I see it, bitcoin does some things that is lacking in the current financial system:

1. Protection from inflation and the manipulations of government issued currency.
2. The ability to be your own bank and transact without trusting a third party.

That puts it in a different category than simple collectables. Its why some people call it digital gold.
That's divisibility, not liquidity.

Liquidity: how much value can be exchanged at any given time period without significantly affecting the market

There's not enough liquidity to move even 25M in crypto and that's barely *anything* in the real world (much less compared to the 420B marketcap crypto currently holds).
If the rejection of 9420 is gobbled up above 9350, I'll be pretty confident. Hopefully I don't get wicked. 

edit: Holy ferocious dip eaters
Futures dipped to 9345 so I slid that sucker to 5x and added the margin 100% in 5x @ 9333. Market stop at 9295. This either goes up hard or I'd get stopped out anyway. I'll take my risk on a home run up front. I'm feelin froggy.
It feels high after being at 6400 23 days ago. But we were above the current price 23 days before that. 
Mate, just carry on.  

Sorry not sorry, people like you deserve to go broke.
remember using a hole-punch to double their capacity?

Ah, good times!
> I think the bigger thing is to consider how much total crypto is mined each day. Eventually prices get high enough and more is created and there is a massive imbalance.

The amount of crypto created (BTC, BCH, LTC, ...) is fixed. Higher prices don't lead to more coins, but to more hash power and greater difficulty.

Yup, I am just riding this train unhedged for now, will only margin long on a healthy pullback after support shows strong. I wouldnt long below $7.8. 

I do think the pullback will be quite nasty, but its possible we only barely pullback before going parabolic and blow off top to around $11-11.5k
Who are the resident bears around here 
eh 
If prior movements are any indication, we could expect some chops for a few days to cool down RSI, and I think we will revisit the 9000 resistance that was tested several times.  I'm layering longs between 9100 and 9000
[deleted]
I shorted a bit in January, and I don't think the stress is worth the piddling 20 percent gains.  Been buying regularly since the 6k bottom and very happy with the returns so far..
lol I did. Market closed at 9525. Yeesh
lol well yes, I personally believe it's not a terrible time to buy especially on low leverage. but as we get closer to $12k I think we should get more bearish than bullish. it's better for r/r that way
confirmation in 2 weeks© 
As /u/mandy7 also points out, confirmation is everything in this formation.
The one I'm looking at has bottoms at 6450 and 6500. Not the same as OP. 
oh you're talking about BEFORE confirmation. I see it. I was looking at the post confirmation figures at the top.
That was after the retracement from the 10th to the 15th though.
I get you, which is why I'm keeping my mind open. I have strong opinions on bitcoin but the market doesn't give a shit, so I'll get out of the way when it disagrees. 

It's possible this is the next bull run, but it's not just my personal opinions that are telling me it's not. it's a combination of research and charting and sentiment
FOMO is igniting, my personal guess is we wick up to $9.8k then head back down for a correction
 

Second guess is we do this all the way up to high $10k to low-mid $11k before a bit real correction 
A small percentage of posts receive one report. Maybe 2&#37;. A much smaller percent get two. Almost no comments get 3 reports.
Yes, it improves both. The content above draws this kind of contribution into that thread. It's exactly what I hope the alt thread is composed of.
The subpoena was received in December, I believe.  5 months later and still no action or asset freeze, much less an indictment.
I'm not too familiar with futures yet I need to get comfortable with it first. Closed my long btw.
It does seem like this whole crazy bull run is all about chasing stop losses
Not really, shorting wasn't nearly as popular 
We’ve gone from 6.6k to 10k in 16 days in the past. 11k to 19k in 5 days. 2.8k to 4.8k in 2 weeks. “Pull backs” are relative. Im sure there were “pullbacks” of 3-5% every 5 days of green or something. But the previous scenario has happened. Fomo and isnt just a meme. It’s rapid and catches fire like tinder. It’s happened before.
Huh 
You’ve lost your admin badge how come?

If you're trading with even moderate margin, then a 10% drop is going to be painful at best and could see you easily margin-called at worst. 

For a 1x long, then yes, the reward may outweigh the risk. But for everything else you'd be foolish to yolo here.
Cool, thanks!
Let's crash and burn together then. Like Bruce Willis in armageddon before blowing up the asteroid! 
Hopium abuse is on the rise the lately.
We blew past it when it was ATH but we bounced on support at 10K several times before breaking down to 6K the first time around.
Gotcha:)
I'd argue his snide remark absolves me from the need to be excellent. 

Besides, he knows he's an asshole. I generally don't hold it against him. 
The only shorting I’ll be doing is getting into fiat

I wouldn’t margin short this thing until we had a blow off where it goes down 15% and then struggled to make it back up for a few days 

Number one rule of crypto is that the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay liquid and right now that trend is up 
If you short 11K to 7K again I'm going to be legitimately mad at you.
Didn't have enough from back then lol.
Congratulations, you got lucky. It's not an achievement besides having had the courage and vision to buy it so cheap. 
okay? buy and hold is a great strategy, I've been doing that too for quite some time as well. But there is TA that works, like simple support and resistance lines. Anyone calling out random numbers because of a triangle is an idiot, and no one should take them seriously.
Okay.
God bless her.
Good bot
That’s a silly thing to say. He doesn’t have to trade it to acknowledge it exists. There are plenty of markets magnitudes larger than alts, do you trade on every single one? Do they not exist if you don’t ? 

I also don’t trade alts since Jan. Because I think it’s a ridiculously overvalued and overblown circle jerk. And even though it’s easy money, I just don’t want to contribute to it. Doesn’t mean I don’t acknowledge it’s existence. 
That's me. I bought some alts this year and still think "wtf is this shit?"
I sold my alts in January. There’s a long wya to go before I need to buy any back
so they just posted it randomly
Yeah this is what I would like. As far as I can tell, with the trailing stop on BitMex you have to set it manually when it's at the point you would be ok losing the trailing amount from. 
Yes and what I'm saying is we could possibly make it all the way up there without a pullback of more than 5%. like, in order to consider it  a "peak" we'd need 2 or 3 days of red. And it's possibly we don't get that before then. It never happened the first time from $9k to $11.7k after $6k dump. I remember very well because I lost a lot of money shorting it 
Good to know i'm not alone. The tipping point for me clicking buy was my norman friend buying in lol #WallstreetOfCrypto 
lollll

(*chuckles nervously*)
Are you laughing because you're in on the joke or because you don't know yet that the joke's on you? 

(Just checked your post history -- joke's on you) !RemindMe 30days
That's a safe play. We're up 47% with no retraces over 7%. I'd hate to be in fiat, but unleveraged holding BTC is a very reasonable place to be at this stage. 
Fair enough. I am a swing trader, at best, just trying to understand the market. Appreciate the reply though, this is what makes this sub what it is.
Yes I get what you mean, I'll have to explain it more in detail later 
The current price is at the 0.236 fib which also holds a resistance line methinks.

EDIT: clarification
Perhaps, being added to GDAX finally did the trick after the overall market selloff.... BCH volume on Gdax has x10+ since early April, while BTC has been anemic.
I thought BCash is the real Bitcoin. Seems to me like BCashers are trying to play that card in both directions. 

I agree though, it is off topic. But I also agree, it is trash.
ouch. sorry to hear that. if it makes you feel any better i was hitting buy from 6.95k to 8k unsuccesfully. (reading yours made me feel better)
Dude, its a fucking gold mine, I can taste the salty tears from last November
I see BTC as God of all coins, and in God, we trust.

I think BTC is going to come back stronger and harder.
Thats a long period brother. All the very best. My advise is to immediately close your investment as soon as you break even. Take some time off (not as in weeks). 

Looking forward to seeing you coming back stronger than ever. :)
That's awesome, but keep in mind that's IF you sell. And you're very close already. Congrats though, nice to see you so close to being in the black finally At this point I'd say if you held thru that you might as well keep holding thoigh 
All in all, glad to see you actually haven’t left the crypto space. You may have cashed out but you have proved yourself to be a valuable contribution on this sub and I’ve learned some things from you. 

Thanks 
9.4k seems to be where the “ profit “ taking sets in for people who longed. 

My not be a bad short opp for a small scalp. But honestly the risk isn’t worth it. 
That was $2B/month. That's around 66.67M/day, or around 10,000 coins (last month).

That's about 15% more than GDAX. Not *that* huge, especially when you consider institutions are much more likely to turn over their positions faster than a hoarder.
How much did you lose?

I lost a little over 8% of my trading stack expecting this to go back to 8300.

I hedged at 8250
why do you think you could not P&D bitcoin? you just need the right amount of cash
Technical point: range is not 0-20k, it's undetermined-20K. That makes a difference in calcs.
> I'm saying your 50% confidence band is absurdly wide and frankly, useless.

What? Bitcoin rose from 800 to 20k over the course of last year. A 50% confidence band is extremely small in a market this volatile and would have gotten blown out of the water in the matter of a month last year. And it's absolutely not useless... it's preventing me from FOMOing back in to this rise because I'm fairly certain it is a bull trap.

> Assuming that all price points are equally likely implies we have a uniform distribution on [0, 20].

There is no reason to assume that, as it is obviously not true.
yeah but before it does we can add another lambo to the collection.  Or is this picking up lambos in front of rekting balls?


Which part is insane?  The price going up? or the speed? or crypto in general?  or what something else?  

Assuming there is a value to this, and GS and others are now opening trading desks (apparently credit unions are looking at selling baskets to HNW clients too), then this is pretty reasonable now that all the idiotic newb day traders paid their taxes for the first time and realized they made no real profits.  Seems pretty sane from my perspective.  But I dont even bother looking more than once or twice a month any more so Im probably missing something.
agreed
I'll be scaling out of my longs from 9700-9850, with a stop at 9700 if we cross 9750. Wouldn't reopen until 10200. 
Just keep shorting then. There are tons of news and fundamentals under the surface the last few months while the price was tanking. Positive signals from regulators, Circle buying poloniex, Goldman Sachs and other high profile investors getting in, huge amount of OTC demand that really wasn’t even able to be filled. Bitcoin is also a scarce resource, while fiat is not. I’m sure this isn’t going to change your mind but saying it’s 100% fraud with no fundamentals seems strong. 
In fact we all want to have rules broken.
That was actually a fear of mine (following that log support down after breaking it).  Having that rising support turned resistance turn support again helped to calm my fears.  Testing it again wouldn't be the worst thing in the world (if it holds anyway)
Thanks!
But the best thing about the dude is his risk management! He knows when to pull out. Very smart imo.
lmao, I would long chew/btc too
Haha, maybe? 

Totally agree about RSI -- to be taken with a grain of salt under these circumstances.

Another argument might be that the second RSI peak is just lower because the hidden div let RSI cool off sufficiently while the price rose. 

I just try to keep all of these possible interpretations open in my head.
Wow so you just want to trade BTC without even looking at the full picture? I made a point about what I expect Bitcoin to do based on some external factors, get over yourself BTC isn't that special.
Thanks. Not seeing that in my mobile app,  but I’m sure it’s just an auto-collapsed or -sorted “feature.”
seconded 
Rule 1
Glad to hear it.
I still think we will see 3800 around summer.
I would upvote mspaint TA.
That is done damn fine Photoshop. 
Lol
thought as much!
Gah, man. I remember wandering aimlessly around Zurich one morning slightly hungover eating a baguette, and I found this little chocolate shop run by an older lady that looked like she'd just converted her flat into a shop. My German was about as good as her English (probably worse, honestly) but we muddled through. Best damn hot chocolate I've ever had. Couldn't even guess at where it was, though. I've often thought if I make it back there, one of my missions will be to find it. Assuming it's still there. About 8 years now.
If they are already sitting in FIAT they can't be selling unless they want to margin short, which not everyone wants to do. The abundance of USD offered for lending literally proves that a bunch of people have cashed out and they are just happy sitting back not trading, not touching coins.
I understand. I like a good retest of resistance turned support too, but we did already test 9.2 on decent volume and pullbacks are getting eaten up pretty quickly right now which is always nice to see. Im bullish, but I can understand counter arguments here.
You can make them in a *lab*. Hell you can have them made out of someone's ashes.

They're not even remotely rare. They're simply hoarded by the company that mines them to keep initial sale prices high. But you lose 85% of the value the second you walk out the of the store with the diamond.

Hell rubies, emeralds, and sapphires are significantly rarer than diamonds and they're all dirt cheap compared to a diamond at the jewelry store.
> Protection from inflation and the manipulations of government issued currency.

That actually doesn't matter to the everyday person cause they don't have enough money to care. Rich people care more about inflation but they don't keep enough cash around to matter either cause they just invest it.

> The ability to be your own bank and transact without trusting a third party.

Again, regular people don't give a shit about that. The vast majority of Americans have credit cards for the *line of credit*, not the plastic card. So the former system isn't going anywhere.
The bigger issue is limt vs market.

There isn’t enough liquidity to sell a significant amount of coins via limit order, since market order liquidity is trash, and there isnt enough liquidity to sell a significant amount via market order, since limit order liquidity is trash.

A currency needs to be nimble in the sense that you should be able to sell a large amount quickly without waiting for hours for your limit order to get bought up, but should also have enough liquidity to avoid slippage.

This ks why I anticipate that LN will make things easier, since you could simply receive BTC as payment and then hedge the value of your channel with futures
lol, Shiiit!  

I keep clicking buy market but still have remaining margin to work with.

Going to probably fomo in a litte bit more after I calculate where I can have a SL that won't be triggered to easily, but still will put me into the green for this week.
I'm not buying these fake manipulated markets, so i wont go broke mate.
Not exactly.  It’s in flux as miners figure out risk and reward.  The amount created each day is fairly constant so higher prices mean more resources and cash needed to sustain a rise in price.  Obviously there was a massive imbalance at 19.5k btc.  I think we are growing too fast at the moment,  I’m not buying.  Just holding some small stakes so whatever happens it’s cool with me.  
Agreed. At 11.5k, I’m selling a significant portion of my stack
Good work my son...

Already 100$ in the green 
Oh I thought you were discussing the 7.2k and 6.4k crashes with a confirmation at 9.1k.

The one you're talking about confirmed at 7.5k and has already met it's target. I agree with it though.
Yeah. I meant everything after the 5k low Nov 11th. Sorry i should have been more specific in my first post. lol
Hopefully. It would be a good long entry if I can time it well.



Do you think it's possible to see new lows? Personally I am thinking that it is unlikely, but I'm sure that people thought the same thing in May 2014 at the top of the dead cat bounce.
Thank you for letting me know. It’s interesting to know. Can give a little insight into the mood of people here
Dec 6th, and a lot of Tether was still printed after that.

No one here even has any idea what the subpoena is for. It certainly doesn't imply the exchange itself or Tether corp. is being investigated for fraud. It could just as easily pertain to some individual users of the exchange or token, or the tether hack that occurred (and was stopped with no appreciable loss of funds) in Nov.
Ok, then just read the futures guide on BitMex ;)
You do realize $3k to $5k is 67% right?

We're at 43% right now. (67% would be $11.3k, hehe) 

$50k would be 635%. 
Because they sold into tether hoping for btc to crash even more than it actually did. Now they are out of btc, in 100% tether, and hoping another crash comes along so they can get back in this at a better entry point. 

I was joking to be honest, but just thought I’d explain what I was saying here. 
I only add the badge when I'm being a mod.
right but SOMEONE would have to be buying  between $8k to $14k again 

I just think it would be beyond retarded if we did that 
Doesn't really look like it to me: https://i.imgur.com/Fz3gVjh.png

Hovered around it a bit at the end of Jan, but other bounces (which were already pretty small) around $10k during that time were more closely following the 200 period 4hr MA.
gotchu. Hope your winning streak continues. Good luck
Perhaps you're right. I'll reconsider. Hedging will be significantly less stressful than actually going  leverage short
This is wise as well as being wise advice. I have seen a lot of people call the top early akin to the ones calling the bottom early.

A good lesson in patience.
LOL 11 will be new my favorite number.. Actually it already is, I just decided 

Maybe one day I'll long $7k to $11k! 😂
It was luck. But what I have then bought since was not.
Thanks! You can ask me for more facts any time. Beep boop.
i got hit by the alts in the 11k to 6k drop..ICX from 45k sat to 26k sats...the way it bled was unreal, losing 50% BTC value, losing 60% sat value, all at the same time. Terrible feeling. still can't shake it.
i have absolutely no idea what you are talking about.  A complete sentence with some context may help, but just a guess.
Got it - thanks for the explanation.
lol its not going to $20k any time soon. If it does it'll be some fuckjng retarded mania or extremely obvious manipulation. Ppl r so silly
I'm laughing because you sound like a fool. I'm not even saying you're going to be wrong (although I personally believe there's a very large chance you will be), I just laugh at bulls who nut early 
Well, how is bitcoin defined? If it is proximity to original code then bcash wins. So it is not defined by anything technical. Simply majority agreement defines what bitcoin is. And from that standpoint it makes sense bcashers try to define bitcoin as BCH. I have no problem with that effort, I just do not think it will materialize. I even like the war.

We wanted anarchy and now we complain? That is a bit inconsistent.
Yes I was very angry at bitcoin for a few days. But I realized that's pointless and it was my fault for not setting stops and being complacent with profits 
Not questioning that, but if BCH or ETH dumps hard, BTC will suffer at least in the beginning.
Oh I fully intend to continue holding. But finally breaking even on this is gonna feel awesome, so I consider it to be an important personal milestone.
thanks, friend! Really appreciate it. Had a rough week
That's my thinking too.  If we end up going to 9.4 again and dumping, I won't mind having missed that opportunity, not feeling the RR from it.  If it's only worth a scalp then definitely not good RR.
All things considered, I lost very little, 4% total of stack in negatives in the 8.6k ~ 9.0k range.  But actual loss to stack since 8.5 was 2% considering the final profit taking of a 7.8k long in 9k range that one of the failed bets was going to hedge against. Seriously it was beautiful how many failures I stacked without eating shit.  It could be my most successful risk management to date.  In the past I would have been at a 10% loss on this series of trades, but laddering in and laddering out and plopping hedges on and off in opposite directions and respecting the range better has really added a finesse.
because the R/R is extremely unprofitable. There are a lot of actors with huge and small amounts of bitcoin that can just dump it before you take profits. But if you pump moneycoin, ranked 453 in cmc, to rank 23, the only way you can do that is by buying it .And the amount of money needed is much smaller.
No, it is not true, but that wasn't the point of my exercise. The point was to show that your confidence bands are too wide since they're covering half the probability support, which would have been the case regardless of the distribution you slap on it. As far as being useless, I stand by my words. No one does day trades here thinking back to 2011 (2017, doesn't matter). Everyone is looking at hourly charts, and weekly, at most. Now, whether or not your CI helps you from FOMOing is your thing. You choose your own adventure, but as a general statement... I'll have to disagree with your stance.
It's going up with *zero* retracement and very little volume.

Futures are *still* below spot even though the price is up close to 50% from the bottom.

Open futures are actually declining while swaps are skyrocketing.

I don't understand what any of this is doing.
Yeah I tend to enter the same.time he does but don't pull out (heh). if I did I'd legitimately have about 2-3x the bitcoin I do right now

There's only been like 2 out of a dozen times where I made a profit over him because he exited early and missed a move. To be fair i held my short for quite a while but I should've exited earlier. 
Nice edit. 
No just because we frequent this sub does not mean we only trade BTC. However most of us keep our discussions of different trades to the relevant places as set out by the rules.
I've done it. It was years ago, but it's in my post history. I was using gimp. Same difference. Was pretty common once upon a time.
Based on the fact that there are only a handful of spots you would have been walking around aimlessly in the morning and the dozen-ish bakeries/chocolate shops run by locals in the city, I think I could help you find it pretty quickly ;)
I mean the people who didn't sell yet but are still sitting in coin or those who bought at the bottom and don't believe in it.
I ended more bullish after watching a while longer. Entered into a long I'm hoping to ride up to at least 9850.  
Yup, that's what I'm getting at. Bitcoin has actual scarcity. 
Decentralisation matters to regular people because they see corruption in the power structures of government and big banks. It's the principle that is attractive. I don't need Bitcoin in a practical day to day sense, I need it as a hedge against the mistrust of institutions.
Those are large scale businesses though, not everyday people or small businesses.

Large scale businesses aren't going to use crypto in the first place because the existing banking system is cheaper. Wires a *much* cheaper than crypto.
How exactly does this contradict what I said? i.e. not more coins, but more hash power and higher difficulty (= more money needed).
Completely agree.  
Is the only benefit to futures the funding fees? 
To be fair, BitMex have hardly any information on futures and their UI isn't very intuitive.
You do realize he said 50k eoty right? Cuz we’ve seen 1500% growth in less than a year before. 
Oh fair enough! Didn’t realise that’s how it works lol

I seem to recall many daily wicks in January bouncing off of 10K before finally crashing below.
Hey man, I'm just you in reverse. I've got a margin long from 6410.

Too bad it was only 10x with 2.5% of my trading stack (at the time) lol
Tell me facts about bulls, please
maybe it will 
Bitcoin refers to the longest chain and strongest network. Mining consensus determines what is Bitcoin and the contentious fork has to be something else. If BCash successfully captured the network then *it* would be properly referred to as Bitcoin but it didn't. 

Also, the point on proximity to original code is rather arbitrarily defined and also completely irrelevant in a discussion about open source, consensus based blockchains.
And not listening to me :-P

I've just closed my 8.9 long. But this looks like Nov, every dip gets bought up pretty quickly...
Sorry mate but I don't think I am in the right position to answer that as I trade solely BTC. I never check its correlation with other alts. 

But yes it is plausible, just like I believe that if alts are going up and BTC will follow, the same way if the alts are to drop, yes BTC could suffer too.
love it 👌
It's not "half the probability support", that's the point.
Haha, awesome. I feel like it was north of the lake, maybe by the cathedral. It had chocolates all along the walls in like...a bookshelf type setup? And the hot chocolate setup in a little kitchen in the back. Best as I can recall at least :P
No it doesn't. BCH is proof of that.

Don't like Bitcoin? Fork it to "Bitcoin2.0".
Regular people couldn't care less.

People whine about the poor working conditions in China then go buy Apple products. They rail against shitty wages of workers but then go work at Walmart instead of shopping at another store.

It's easy to complain, hard to actually care enough to do something about it.
FedWire is cheap as fuck!

RTGS are cheap as hell

But I can still move a billion dollars in Bitcoin for 9 cents if it’s one UTXO
yes, you shouldn't worry if you don't plan to hold this position for more than a few days, though. The fees get exorbitant if swap is over spot but really that will only eat into your profits if you hold it for a while while we stick around this range.


look up backwardation 
It’s not that bad. The futures guide is pretty good imo. I dunno about UI, Im not much of a UI/UX connoisseur 
You're suggesting we go to $50k with little to no turbulence. I highly advise you to take a step back and think about what you're saying and where we are 
I love making more bitcoin. I just realized it sucks just making usd because what I really want is more bitcoin lol 

so the day o make significant btc from going long will be a breakthrough for me 
You are not right. Bitcoin is defined what people believe bitcoin is. No law says that the longest chain or strongest network it must be. Until people believe it, it will be right. When they stop then it will not be right. Anything is just arbitrary. That is why bitcoin.com can easily try to sell bcash as bitcoin. And they are partially successful. 
To be fair $7.4 would've been a pretty good close. It was mainly just the violent move and me not having internet. if I had internet I would've hit market on my desktop 
Why'd you close here with buying pressure being what it is?
Sounds like Café Schober or Urs Vohdin
> No it doesn't. BCH is proof of that.

Oh come on dude.
Buying bitcoin isn't like you're going without some cool Apple gadget or handling some inconvenience when shopping for the sake of principle. Bitcoin is a very selfish and easy way to say 'fuck you' to the man.
well, the other point is that futures are more volatile than swaps due to the whole premium vs discount
Yeah. And for some reason June is *still* at a negative premium. What price do we have to reach before people think that btc might be worth more in 2 months than now
No one said anything about turbulence until you brought it up. I highly advise you take a step back and re-read everything with some reading comprehension glasses
If I'd gone 10x with 25% of my stack instead of 2.5%....holy poo I'd have a lot more coin than I've ever had in my trading stack. Probably wouldn't have had the nerve to hold this long though with that many contracts. 
If you want to argue purely from a semantic point of view, then fine, but this is not what is meant when people ask this question. Bitcoin is defined at the continuous chain that follows consensus mining rules. Not sure why you think mining/market consensus does not correlate with "what people believe Bitcoin is," it's one in the same because of economic incentives.
You were just too greedy. I thought you had those stops placed.
Personal situation. Don't want stops, can't babysit and this should drop at some point.
Hmm, neither of those really look like I remember it. Cafe Schober is definitely bigger than the place I went. Maybe I was on the other side of the river? I know I crossed the bridge at some point. 8 years is a long time, and being hungover at the time I'm sure isn't helping. 
This isn't the 1960's and most people couldn't give a shit less about "the man".
~$12,000.
Quite literally the second comment in the thread. 

You know..the one you responded to? 
longing $6.5k-$7k was such a no brainer. I'm never letting my personal feelings affect my trading again 

At least you longed though! 
I got in a bit deeper on my long from that range.  And that is why I took most profits around 8.2 and then let it stop out at 7.9.  I wonder if you would have let a bigger one ride.
No. There are people who do not agree with you. Bitcoin is nowhere defined as you say. You define bitcoin like that and people who believe BTC is bitcoin do that. Mining/market/or me just follow the majority aka network effect.
No. but I'm 100% okay with having stops now, especially during sideways movement 
Reasonable! Just was curious. Congrats on the good trade and profit.
IDK why this conversation is still going but, yea people do care about "the man", people are more politicised than they have been since ww2. People are waking up to the corrupt financial system and many are spooked about the idea of the next housing bubble or share market crash. The state of politics and government debt makes people want to distance themselves from government backed currency. Anyway, it's not like there is panic in the streets or anything, but I think the bitcoin train has plenty of fuel for the time being.
Thought he was you, sorry. But i might as well be responding to both of you. The original commenter said bithing about turbulence. He gave a time frame, and a pricepoint. And people responded with sentiment that that cant possibly happen
I had laddered orders from 6600-5800 but only 2/10 or something executed. 
Knowing me, probably not. I'm fairly certain I would have closed at the 8300-7800 retrace. 
Bitcoin refers to the chain, not the software. Sure, you can pretend that BCash is Bitcoin but when people say "I have Bitcoin," they are referring to a specific chain and network, the one that's built on consensus. Sure, you can call this chain whatever you like but that doesn't change the fact that the name is in reference to this.

Also your point on network effect makes no sense. Bitcoin is a continuous chain, if you contentiously fork from the chain and then reach a greater network effect later on, that's doesn't mean that *that* chain is not Bitcoin. It has to refer to something continuous. Unless of course you want to just play semantic games.
Doesn't look so good now ;-)
I feel you.. and I don't mean to be annoying, but I jusy think these are the times where bulls need to be careful and keep their heads on straight is all. Same for bears at $6-7k
Your definitions of bitcoin are irrelevant to me. They are not truth per se. They are truth, because most of other people define bitcoin as BTC for whichever reason and with various rationalizations.

Problem of "BTC core" is that "just semantic games" are looked at as pointless. Exactly this and only this is a reason, why bcash and other forks have relatively so much value and they still have some chance to even take over the brand. Even when they are run by few obvious crooks. It is truly amazing and that is why I still hodl most of my BCH. That is in fact the most interesting thing for me from all of this.

How we define and **name** the reality and symbols is the crucial aspect of humanity.
There we go!
> How we define and name the reality and symbols is the crucial aspect of humanity.

No it's not. All that matters is the integrity of the chain. Does not matter if BTC is called BananaCoin and BCashers call BCH Bitcoin, the fact remains that Bitcoin refers to the chain with contiguous blocks. It makes absolutely no sense to refer to a forked chain as Bitcoin even if it overtakes BTC at some point. The chain would not be a continuous accounting of *Bitcoin* transactions, so the concept is silly.

You're argument is completely absurd but reminiscent of many similar arguments from BCashers over the past year. Wanting something to be true doesn't make it so. 
And up again. This will probably bounce somewhere between 9.8-10.2 before more legs up.
Yes, because the bcashers are right in this and almost only in this. This is why their coin has a value. Who defines reality wins. Wanting something to be true amazingly in human interaction makes it so. This is why winners of wars define history and so on. Human life is not a silicon life.

Here it is much easier to play those games, because bitcoin is not defined by formal law. This is why it is interesting. This is why Ver bought bitcoin.com. Nothing is more important for people than symbols. And bitcoin without people makes no sense.
Darn. Thought we were making sense for a moment. 
You are greatly confused on this whole topic. Utility and intrinsic value is what matters. Ver's ability to deceive and scam people will only take BCash to the limits of its pump.

There is no chance in hell that BCash overtakes Bitcoin or any other legitimate project. Wanting it to be true is completely irrelevant to anyone outside of the cult.
Do not start to be personal. It is annoying and boring.

Bring rather arguments why BCH has so much value. Hint: yes it is what is left after utility and intrinsic value. The thing that have almost all alts.

I love bitcoin (BTC) that it has at least some utility and that I feel at least some ground, but even with BTC we are now far away of intrinsic value. In my niche BTC is being used (now even BCH, but much less), but no way the intrinsic value went up so much during last years.

Your model of world is crippled and observed from a tunnel. You are part of the BTC hardcore cult. Which in the end is ok and I hope you win.
> Bring rather arguments why BCH has so much value. Hint: yes it is what is left after utility and intrinsic value. The thing that have almost all alts.

Not understanding your sentence structure.

>I love bitcoin (BTC) that it has at least some utility and that I feel at least some ground

What? What is ground and what is the utility you're referring to?

>but even with BTC we are now far away of intrinsic value. 

What are you babbling about? You're not saying anything here, just using buzzwords.

>In my niche BTC is being used (now even BCH, but much less), but no way the intrinsic value went up so much during last years.

lolwut? Serious man, this is just pure incoherence. What is this illusive "intrinsic value" you're referring to and how is it priced?

>Your model of world is crippled and observed from a tunnel. You are part of the BTC hardcore cult. Which in the end is ok and I hope you win.

Actually no. I'm not married to BTC, I just know scamcoins when I see them and I understand what is and isn't feasible in terms of scaling options.

Your argument is completely devoid of substance. Just empty and meaningless rhetoric.
