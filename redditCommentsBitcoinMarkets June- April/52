Hey guys i’m back from the hospital! Happy to say i never had to sell any of my coins from the accident two weeks ago because they let me go on a payment plan!

Also, had my brain checked up and the bruising and bleeding are gone. Truly lucky to be alive all things considered.

I wish you all the best my dudes! This is one of the few goldmines on reddit and i’m grateful to have you as a part of my life :)
Here's an interesting concept that may be at play. Google for "Mastering the Markets PDF" and go to page 36. I won't post the link here because the post might get flagged for linking to a non\-whitelisted domain \(this has happened to me before\). Ignore the software they are selling, but I've always thought this ebook covered some valuable concepts.

[Screenshot of the page I'm referring to](https://i.imgur.com/bM6dLsH.png) \+ [page 2](https://i.imgur.com/tFgvUYU.png)

[Current chart and supply area we pushed up through \(horiz level, vpvr gap, 4h cloud\)](https://i.imgur.com/AtgmB3G.png)

Basically, the idea is that when you have a really obvious horizontal level on the chart, typically because a trading range has formed, supply can represent not only range traders who are making a quick buck but also underwater traders who are "locked into" bad positions and hoping to dump for close to break even when price gets close to their bad entry.

Big money accumulates in ranges, and when they're done accumulating, they initiate a mark up campaign where they continue buying but with the intention of increasing price \(rather than building a position w/o moving price\). They have already established the majority of their position, so slippage is not a problem, and can be seen as \*good\* for them because it increases the profit on the majority of their position that they already hold.

So let's say you've been accumulating in a range for awhile and you're ready for the mark\-up phase. You don't want these "locked in" traders to act as resistance for your mark up campaign. So you try to push price up \*very\* quickly and violently so they don't have a chance to react. Suddenly, they're in profit and greed starts to replace their fear, so they don't sell. The end result is the big money player is able to move price up for a lower cost. In today's markets, you also have over\-leveraged traders. In this case, the high number of leveraged shorts was an absolute gift to whoever was accumulating because it made this "push up through supply" move easier and more violent.

It's worth saying that just because we were in a range, and just because we had a high number of shorts, doesn't mean this was going to happen. It's impossible to say, and earlier this week I was bracing for a possible shakeout to 5k before a meaningful recovery. But the conditions were right, if there was indeed a large accumulator under $7k, to plan and execute this move.

**TLDR: This fast $1000 move is bullish af and a sign of more to come in the weeks that follow.**
Ready to have your mind blown? More Bitcoin traded hands in that one hour than *any other time in history*. 

BTCUSD volume: ~$550M 
XBTUSD volume: ~$635M

That's $1.2 billion trading volume in one hour!

Closed my long at $7,970. 

I'm playing with fire at this point by keeping it open. 
##Moon Math Update

https://www.moonmath.win

/u/nannal is finally out of the woods! The 7 day column is wildly optimistic. No surprises there, I guess.

The 2015 column is pretty close to the official Moon Math prediction today. It's showing 100k after the next halving and finally landing on 1 million USD/BTC in almost exactly 5 years.

I went long, 5x leverage, 1x stakes @7,863. We may pull back from here, but I'm fairly confident that this thing has wheels. If we drop a few hundred and have a convincing bounce I'll add to my position there.

Shorts are now beyond what they were yesterday. I'm honestly pretty surprised we haven't seen some kind of massive squeeze attempt, I know the resources required are substantial but the reward at this point is astronomical.

Been in the game since late '13. I've never seen nearly every big crypto discussion/sub full of people discussing leveraged positions. It was a simpler time in the old days, now it's just long/short/squeeze/leverage in the minds of most traders. I don't do leverage because I don't borrow or use interest. these micro moves the past weeks were boring for non leveraged traders, but a few hundred up and down was like life and death for y'all leveraged dudes. 
Omw to work on the radio "bitcoin up a thousand for no apparent reason" the way he said it, lmfao.
Opened a long again at $7,700. 

While I don't necessarily think the market will break up again, there is a strong argument for a bull flag here. So it's not the craziest thing I've ever done. 
Shout-out to the GDAX bearwhale, who seemingly won't ever run out of coins to sell (yep, it's almost certainly the same person). He's been selling for two days straight, very predictable pattern: started out with 25 and 50 BTC blocks on round numbers ($XX25, $XX50, etc.). After the pump, he's progressed to 50 and 100 BTC blocks, still on round numbers. I'm envious not only of his coin count, but his patience...he'll wait (sometimes hours) for his asks to fill, then slyly replace them after a dump. This allows market demand to soak up his supply without spooking the market by market selling 100s at a time.

Note that this isn't conspiracy, manipulation, etc. and obviously there are lots of other people selling on GDAX at the same time...I'm just noting some particularly notable behavior by one person/entity. If you've had your eye on GDAX over the past few days, I'm sure you've noticed his supply. Not sure why he/they are selling here vs. going the OTC route, but to each their own, I guess.

Final note: humans are funny in that they are creatures of habit. I probably wouldn't have noticed if this person randomized his sells instead of being very particular about how they place their orders. I catch myself doing the same thing, sometimes.
So many people (mostly those with shorts open/liqd) on this sub are talking down the significance of today's price spike. I just want to ask this simple question. 

ARE WE GOING TO JUST IGNORE $1.2B WORTH OF BTC WAS TRADED IN JUST 1 HOUR? FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER IN BITCOIN'S HISTORY!

You can call it a short squeeze, a whale manipulator or whatever. The fact is, this thing is unpredictable. As much as you think it will go to 4k, it can go back to ATH. This thing does not care about you or your position or my uncle. It is here to redefine money as we know it. So STFU and respect the corn.



To everyone screaming 'what a squeeze' or something to that effect:

The squeeze has hardly begun. Look at shorts still open:

This is going to be some old school bitcoin fireworks. Guess I won't be doing any work the coming few hours..
Alright everyone, let's keep grounded on where we are in our channels and what has just occurred.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/PjTYEkaT/  

We broke the downtrend line from 11.7K (second top), and not just lightly. We nuked it from orbit. This is a big accomplishment for bulls, and the first step towards a market reversal. Chewy nailed it last night again, as usual. Unfortunately I was asleep, having gotten home late from vacation and slept through alarms. We bounced off the support zone (turned resistance) from the Sep/Feb/Mar lows, and I have that at about 8175 right now, but the entire 8100-8300 range probably qualifies.  

I've seen numerous people throw out 9K-10K targets for this bounce, but I think that's highly unlikely. The downtrend log line from ATH is sitting right on $9K, and breaking over 9200 *would* qualify as a market reversal.

I'm sitting underwater on my short position because I set alarms and not stops. I broke my own catastrophic stop rule, but I probably would have had it around 7800, which wouldn't have done me well anyway at this point. I had adds up to 7480, and I managed to add at 7920 manually. I'm short swaps around 7300 right now. I'm holding it for now because we've already dropped $400 from our wick top and because we got rejected off the resistance zone. I'm also holding my June futures position from 6410 still. 

Layering a short in from 7700-7950 with stops over 8200 makes a whole lot of sense, and I would be doing it if I didn't already have my position. Edit to add: /u/citral23 makes a valid point that this zone is upward sloping and somewhat steep. 8200 may be a premature stop. Re-evaluating hourly is important. 8320 is a lot safer, but that's a pretty wide stop on layering in now. All about individual r/r analysis. 

Stay frosty. Good luck all. 
The hourly candle *almost* has the same volume as the past two days **combined.**
I don't know why I listen to Tone Vays, I deserve this. 
By pure luck, which I don't mind admitting, I was in a 2x long trying to scalp some dimes down all the way at 6845. My hand was fairly weak and I closed out at 7750, then shorted 8030->7750 at 1x, then reopened the short at 7750 again. 

Dear Diary, today was a good Bitcoin day.
Shorts on finex down to 26k from high of 40k
Nothing new here, but a good example of how trading trend lines can be profitable. [Tons of stored energy in these longer trend lines.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/7QHbuCKx/) Hope shorts here were able to exit the moment this began to break up.  

We're not out of the bear market ... next two weeks I'll be watching the historical resistance from $20k.  If that breaks, we should get a proper rally.
Long from $6,940. 

It's at the beginning stages, but the descending channel appears to be breaking to the upside.

It would be better to wait for $7,100 to break, but I'm choosing to get in sooner rather than later. 

Stops below $6,700.

I have been bearish for a while now [timestamp](https://twitter.com/ibankbitcoins/status/973510590768480256)
I closed all shorts and switched long at 50% size. I think today's breakout of a triangle is the beginning of a new short term bullish trend. For the next few hours, we probably pullback from profit takers, but overall above 7.4-7.5K is bullish. We are still below the 200 day moving average (long term bearish) at 9.5K. But we did retest 6K support and pushed hard from consolidation. Here is my newest view. [timestamp](https://twitter.com/ibankbitcoins/status/984417888927809536)
We've taken a hard left away from the dungeon of capitulation: https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/ClyXqInO-The-One-Coin-to-Rule-Them-All-Chapter-I/
[Hopium](https://twitter.com/MusclesCrypto_/status/978543518267387904) for the other bulltards. 
This morning's bullrun definitely caught me off guard and I was dead wrong on my prediction of <6.5k before >7.5k. 

Considering going long at next corrective retrace, potentially 7200-7400 range. Still, given how overbought we are in the 4hr/6hr time frames, I don't think it's safe to rule out a mass sell-off just yet. Might even wait until daily closes for assurance. Either way, tight stops are probably a good idea.

Edit: seems some people take issue with my use of “bullrun”. Please feel free to replace with <price went up due to whales/bots/manipulation/non-organic growth> if it makes you happier. 
Oh come on. Are these pumps regulation size or what?
I really don't think professional, big money cares about fractals at all. So I've reconsidered my will to heavy short at 8.4, that would mimic what happened in 2014. Supply and demand will be tested in relation to volume, and what will happen will depend on it. Now that I know how to spot weakness (the "run" to 11.7 on low volume) and accumulation (what just happened before the dildo of mercy) I have better tools to pick my trades without emotions about the price itself. Great opportunities to learn a lot this month, really. 
decided to sleep in half an hour this morning
and i'm rekt
We are now above the 3 day short term moving average.

If we're lucky, well break out above the resistance down trend from 20k

Then we'll golden cross on the 3 day

Finally, the Adam and eve formation on the 3 day confirms, and we're off on another bull run

This is how I dream the rest of the year plays out
The "Perpetual Stew Method" is a trading strategy I've employed successfully for years. For those who aren't familiar, [a primer on perpetual stew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_stew).

Add when I can, take when I need. When a trade goes south, that's ok! Just leave it in the pot and simmer a few months--it all turns to gravy in the end. Savory, pecuniary gravy.

Good luck out there.
I said I'd plan on evaluating again at 7.8k range... looking at the following things:  
- Broke out of falling wedge & smaller of the two major triangles (https://imgur.com/a/IYm4k)  
- Time frames 15 min through 6 hr all overbought  
- Bull flag on 1 hr (prettier on 15 min)

The range surrounding 8K has been a magnet throughout this bear market. It seems every time we pass through it the band around 7.8 and 8.2 serves as some resistance/support (7.8 currently resistance). It's never insurmountable and we have just blown through it before too, but it's usually a zone we've tended to hang around a bit recently. That, coupled with the RSI being so overbought, makes me think I wouldn't be surprised if we consolidated here for a bit (maybe with relatively minor upward movement) while the RSI cools off and the flag lengthens. A drop below 7.5 would *start* me being worried regarding a fakeout (alarms set there) but that pop was pretty convincing.

If we do continue up from here and break 7.8k (not 100% but certainly looks good imo), wed'd probably go test the log ATH resistance in 8ks again (location depends on how fast we get up there - could see it being a slog).

Worth noting that if there's not a long period of price consolidation before we go test that ATH resistance I'd be pretty nervous - the daily RSI right now is looking like a set up for a massive hidden bear div if the price turns around anywhere in the 8000s. Any turn around in price would also cause the daily stoch RSI to cross in the overbought region, which has been a very bad signal throughout the bear market. No use worrying about things that haven't yet happened though.

Personally, I caught this wave with my 7.2k stop and pretty happy with that. Maybe would have bought in in the low 7ks once the insane volume on the move up came but not going to regret playing it safe.

When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do?

lol I feel asleep in my bed with my computer open, then I dreamed about I had 8 margin positions open :D Anyway, I closed my 7687 June futures position at  7772, then I realized it's enough for today.  
Always remember that if you get too euphoric or feeling in control of the market, then it's time to walk away since it's your brain that tricks you :D

Still having my swaps long from this morning from  6810, have locked in profits with stop loss and will not move them and see if it rides up
Point and Figure Chart https://i.imgur.com/2al4ce6.png  We've entered into a column of 6 X's.  Previous pole was not a long pole.  The only outstanding 50% long pole retrace for 2018 is from March 27. A retrace of the March 27 long pole would bring us above $8,173.

We are due for a large break out: https://i.imgur.com/XrSjwkt.png  Here is a graph of the column heights over the last 70 days.  Our columns have been getting smaller and smaller both long and short term. This corresponds with a decrease in volume and a wedge forming on daily timeframe.

Short Term Thoughts  https://www.tradingview.com/x/XulQNqqb/  That close of the 4 hour we just had was good place to close long out.  Watching ichimoku cloud on 4 hour, we touched inside of horizontal cloud and got rejected off it with a bear div on 2 hour rsi.  Horizontal cloud provides extra resistance/support and lately I feel we have been tending to fail kumo break outs both directions.  Watching candlestick patterns, 1-4 hour candlesticks pointed towards some downside here and vwap is under 4 hour close price.  Long term key for me is  breaking 7180 level that will make me short term bullish.

I have never seen anything like this, the candle doesn't even fit on my fucking screen.
Volume higher then binance "hack" dump. 

Not too many shorts closed yet... this has more room to go up...
Two weeks ago I drew some lines half asleep. Saw it again today and I'm surprised by the accuracy! Since TA wise it's slow here, I want to give it a go.

https://imgur.com/guCDR58

Falling wedge and the solid support line IMHO were two important bullish signs. I planned my exit strategy if that formation wouldn't hold. Fortunately that scenario didn't play out.
I expect some serious resistance around 8.3k if we get there, as the log support line there will most likely turn to resistance. If we manage to break out there I'm guessing we'll shortly wander between the two log lines before a massive move up. To be continued...
Closed (low) leveraged long from 6600 at 7990. Getting spooked and want to take profits before getting greedy. 1H RSI is definitely on the high side and I'm gonna wait for a drop or a flatten out before I think of re-longing. A short squeeze and a whalebuy is not enough to get me to leave my (borrowed) money on the table. If this thing continues to run up without taking a breather I will gladly enjoy the gains from simply holding.

Had it been a larger position I might have just closed enough to cover principle and let the rest ride, but unfortunately I wasn't bold enough to bet very much at 6.6k

so apparently I owe 56 millions to kraken. I'm going to live in the woods, It  was a pleasure to know you guys!

Closed my long at $7,880

Jesus

Edit: planning to reopen at $7,300 or so once this cools down a bit. 
Folks, a short squeeze and 'organic' buying both raise the price. This move was a high probability event imo - albeit faster than I anticipated - based on the accumulation/testing pattern beginning on April 6 combined with rising shorts which were just too juicy for someone to resist. I switched from bearish to neutral [to short-term bullish](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8afnvv/daily_discussion_saturday_april_07_2018/dwyzmj5/) over the course of three days last week because of this behavior. For those who were truly caught off guard, you might want to read up on the Wyckoff method or check out [this post below](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8bnetl/daily_discussion_thursday_april_12_2018/dx968n9/).

The recent action in some alts was also a bullish signal.

Just two or three days ago I was reading comments here teaching us that a short squeeze was *unlikely* because there was no correlation between short interest and the likelihood of a squeeze, and that it was a poor indicator to look at, and how those longing based on it and at those levels were foolish noobs with a short attention span glomming on to the next shiny object. 

Trading provides many opportunities for us to learn humility, should we be open to learning them. I am new to this sub but have been at this for a long time. My first really painful lessons were shorting the dotcom bubble during the crash (smart) but losing money while doing it, to the point of getting margin called (not smart). And while I have very solid gains from a year ago I am also down from January in spite of it being pretty obvious that the market was peaking, due to my impatience, my greed, my fear, and my attachments. Now I see others who are clearly thoughtful ignoring big signals because they are overly attached to their position and their pet indicators and by extension, their egos. Speaking for myself, when I am attached to my ego, I stop listening.

I anticipate making plenty more poor trades over the remainder of my life but I hope to minimize those to the extent that's possible by continuing to learn as best as I can and remaining open. I hope for the same for all here.

I'm switching from bullish to neutral now (holding). Long term I still believe that BTC will underperform certain alts that cannot (yet) be shorted.
Just went long for the first time in months. This is the FOMO i wanted to see.
My liquidation is at 10k and even I'm scared right now.
Epic short squeeze if I ever saw one. Still way more shorts open than longs... I think we're going even higher(!)
Congrats to everyone who caught this! This bear was not shorting but out of position, but I did just add to my hodl stack for the first time in months. I can't bring myself to neither short nor FOMO in here just yet but it's obvious the bottom may be in with plenty of shorts left to close yet.
I think the storm is over. Shorts are now at 32k, down 8k. I'm still not sure if that was the bottom or not simply because nothing has changed since 24 hours ago. All that buying was imply a short squeeze. I think we'll just see more sideways action for the next week ranging in the 7.0-8.5 range.
Fun fact: The last time we hit 85+ RSI on the 1H was November 26th.
3k longs on finex opened since we started flagging at 7700.

current count: 30k longs / 25k shorts

before the pump: 33k longs / 40k shorts

(6k longs closed after pump ended)
The bear case I posted yesterday was invalidated and I haven't worked up a new one yet.

Here's the current state of the bull case:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/wIRxKjLy/

Here's how it looked yesterday before the breakout:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/qnrp1NZe/

You should notice that I changed the scale for fib numbers so we're showing movements against the retrace from the ATH. My that is that we're moving toward double bottom confirmation when we breach 38.2%. That only raised targets slightly, but It's pretty easy to argue that we're more bullish today than we were yesterday.

I'll try to work up a reasonable bear case soon.
Um ,just now i notice that, in the hourly, ever since january 7800 has acted as a important horizontal resistence-support.

I mean, i already knew we would struggle when we climb back to go over it, but didn't account for its effect on march and february.
OK guys I must admit my bearish outlook has turned to a neutral one. The sustained buying today after the squeeze has me reconsidering a lot and contemplating wether we did really hit a double bottom.

I'm swinging towards bullish but not quite there yet. I still feel like we need to break the overheard resistance of the larger downtrend from $20k. Anyone feeling like this rally will be short lived? 
[Called this yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8beaek/daily_discussion_wednesday_april_11_2018/dx7dvj7/):
>A few alts are rallying today. If 2017 taught me anything, alts rallying led to btc absorbing those gains a few days later.

Someone is shorting this like a maniac. 40k+ shorts now.
Should've bought at 5 AM when I restlessly awoke and saw Chewy go long. Of course I didn't and fell back asleep.

Sleep is overrated! Man now THAT was a squeeze. Way to go everyone who's in it.

Welp, could've closed my 15x short from 7750 at 7600 and made back 80% of what I lost this morning. Instead I am now completely screwed.

Edit: You won't get me this time you bastards. 
now there are mini bull flags forming within this main one.  this tells me that price consolidation is occurring at higher levels and more importantly gives clues as to how valid the main flag is.
Sorry for the noob question - where can i find the charts that show the growth of longs/shorts?
Gloating, taunting, and low effort celebrations will earn you a day in the sin bin. Please act like you've been here before.

**EDIT:** Same goes for alt shilling. If you bring up alts there should be a clear and substantial reasons. The focus and conclusion should be about Bitcoin and the market, not the alt and what you want people to believe about your pet investment.
Shorts got cut in half in a single day. Even bringing it back to parity would be a huge downward pressure on price and I don't see the retail fomo necessary to tip the scales now that only strong shorts remain. 

BUT, I wouldn't doubt that whoever poached 50% of all bears in existence has enough ammunition to do it at least one more time. 
Holy shit, did I really just wake up to 40.5k shorts on finex? I'm sorry bears, but you are absolute fomoing retards with delusions that far surpass even the fools longing 17k+.

And I apologize for using mean words, but Jesus Christ, I don't think there's any way to describe what you're doing. Unless this is all an insider trading bearwhale of course.
Short squeeze followed by a bull trap to completely suck all life from the market?

That would be max pain imo
[removed]
As an aside, I got liquidated for my first time ever in margin trading on the big short squeeze candle. I fell asleep and had both of my safety measures fail for this to happen--illustrates why you can never turn your back on the market without safety precautions.

1) be wary of keeping a high leverage position while asleep (I forgot I had it in 10x leverage mode--was showing the leverage slider on Bitmex to a friend and didn't put it back into 5x).

2) Always have a close and stop in before you sleep (mine should have been 6.7 and 7.1 on a 6.9 short, but forgot to put them in before sleeping).

It was only like 8% of my trading stack, but I hate how easy it is to screw up with BTC because of volatility and lack of market close. 
I'm short at 6930, about to go to bed and leaving this open with stops just around 7k. I see an ascending triangle being painted on the 15m-1h. 

we seem to be lacking much steam from either bulls and bears at the moment. 
I'm really not sure what the play is right now. RSI on the hourly shows a bearish divergence (bearish). We look to be in a rising wedge on the 4hr (bearish) but the top of that rising wedge is about to (or already has depending on how you draw it) a falling wedge on the daily (bullish). We have a lot of shorts that are underwater or could be if we move up even more here (bullish). Maximum upside could put us at the long term trend line at 8.5k vs. 6k if we break down (+21% upside vs -14% downside so at 50/50 odds you want to be long (bullish)). I thinking sitting out and waiting for which one of those wedges breaks first is the right move. 
We are close to a downward channel line, at the resistance of ichimoku cloud, rsi seems to be reversing and can't get past 60. On the 4 hr chart. I don't want to try and get ahead of myself here...but i think it's going down, atleast to test the 6.6k, 6.5k level. As I'm writing this it just lost 6.9 :( maybe after another higher low we'll go up!
huge buys coming in
What just happened.

Just woke up and wow that was impressive. Should be a good point for a short term short as the Americans wake up.

Short @ 7997.xx , target 73xx
Opening a short here seems like the right thing to do but I'm so god damn spooked now. Either direction just seems like more pain.
Just checked the BitMEX leaderboard and aabtc is nowhere to be seen...ouch. He should have just held his long from $6.9k a few more days. Guessing he went massively short and got rekt?
Guys, question: what is the motivation behind squeezing shorts when you're not an exchange? Is the short squeeze the cheapest way to get the biggest increase in price?

And props to whoever shared the tweet of the 35m okex long about 12 hrs ago just before the dildo of death. Shoulda known that was the signal to cancel my open short positions.

Just prior to this pump we had reached a record 68K in outstanding BTC margin funding on Bitfinex.  Its now down to 54K.

https://i.imgur.com/RnzeNWf.png

Shorts hit a record 40K outstanding.

[Yesterday I covered my long-term short from 8.4K at 6.78K](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8b4twg/daily_discussion_tuesday_april_10_2018/dx5pkw0/) and said that this is a [perfect situation to see whether an expected pump squeezes the shorts out.](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8b5hnb/daily_general_discussion_april_10_2018/dx5tqv2/) This latest example sort of validates my point how much the current market action is driven by the now record amount of leverage being put up.

Watch that short/long ratio carefully, it seems every time shorts go >50% we see a cascade of 1k+ laddered buy orders from some whale (likely an exchange). If you're someone hoping this is a return to a bull market and that the shrimp will FOMO in, I would be extra careful. Once that long ratio builds up we could be going back down just as quick. We've seen this happen over and over now.
I wanna see what a massive short squeeze looks like.
I knew it was a sure thing when my idiot friends started shorting 

Now with a candle like that, lets make a bull flag for the rest of the day yeah? ;\)
Short 8008, first time shorting since shorts went parabolic, I hope this is a wake up call for all the euphoric bears in here. Wish I had the balls to keep my 6620 long open when i got downvoted here pointing out the ridiculous shorts.

Just got my short order at 7980 filled on this rush hoping for some quik gains

EDIT: Closed @ 7700
Fuck man, my stops were tight, got out of 4/5 of my position before the pump...  Closed at 7700 and got some short going on at 8130, will close at 7500 and lower.  
Welcome to bitcoin motherfucker
Big gap in the finex shorting data indicates more shorts may have closed than initially indicated, but still only at their levels of 3 days ago with a couple k more added just now

https://www.tradingview.com/x/RTYoxFia/
That was fun. 

I'm targeting a limit buy in the 7500 range as that has been a historic support range. Expecting resistance at the 7800 range. The RSI is smokin', so ideally we spend a couple days in this range consolidating for the next push above 7800 and eventually a re-test of the dreaded descending log trend line sometime next week.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/s4wFfTCG/
Looking at the daily chart (in linear), ~$7,650 is actually a very interesting/important price zone (meeting point of slope trendline from Dec ATH, Nov horizontal resistance and the bottom of a large sym triangle). I will swap to being quite bullish if we can break above and hold $8.5K. Conversely, if $8.5K is not convincingly broken and turned into a strong support, then my bear bias will remain for the next month or two.

Edit: a good start will be the daily candle closing above ~$7,650
Not a single mention of a short squeeze. Who writes these articles?

I posted a chart earlier and have just revised it slightly (linear scale): https://imgur.com/a/euQIR

Current price (~$7.6K to ~$7.7K) is the meeting point of: Dec ATH sloping trendline, Nov horizontal trendline resistance (which we got rejected from a week ago but currently have our head above) and major sym triangle end.

Based on that chart, am I right in thinking that a strong break and hold above ~$8.5K would be a pretty solid indication of a trend reversal i.e. unlikely to be a bull trap?

I'm really looking forward to seeing where the daily closes today.
I’m starting to feel fomo pretty bad right now. Feel like I want to put in more cash, which i absolutely shouldn’t put in. 

Probably time to sell is right around the corner.
Until we break around 7500 none of this matters.

We are neutral for the moment on this shorter time frame, we are still bearish medium term.

Break 7500 and we see what happens but even after that we have to break the ATH line and stay above it before we can say we've left the bear behind.

Let's not make the same mistake as last week people.. You can see the same things going through people's minds already.

If you're placing longs, just make sure you have adequate stops. 
Opened a small 25x Long at 6800$ this makes up for all my stupid trades the last couple of weeks :)
is it normal that all shorts close so fast, if they are underwater? more and more are closing, but the price is staying the same. 

this whole market looks really manipulated as hell. 
Unusually, over the last few days, I took a small leveraged long with average entry about 6.7K in addition to my unleveraged position. I am normally a cash trader and work on month/year timescales for the major trends. The following is my reasoning.

The key tell is the failure to break support from the base trendline drawn from the 2013-14 high to the recent low at 6K. This is major support. There is demand there.

Short term: falling wedge has broken out, price target about 10K, where there is a muddle / confluence of resistance.
I expect a pullback to kiss the falling trendline goodbye. I am looking to add to a lev long long term position on such a pullback. The USD FRR on finex is relatively low, indicating a low demand for leverage long positions. It's not that high for BTC either. There is not that much leverage in the system.

Longer term, we are in a major descending channel from the ATH. Three taps on the way up have already happened, and it is steep, so it is weak now. If we do make 10, that would break us out of that channel. In this scenario, we will be back in the major trend parallel channel, which retains a high rate of growth. I have previously predicted new ATHs this summer, and I think this scenario is still plausible. This scenario would also prevent a bunch of weekly MAs from crossing. The weekly system is no longer overbought (RSI ~45 vs 98 at the ATH). This is promising.

Now for something even more speculative. I'm not a big fan of Elliot waves since they are rather subjective. But BTC does like to respect TA even when it's voodoo. In the case of a new ATH, I would make this wave 5, which would be the big Kahuna (for some years, anyway). My target in that case is about 40-100K. In this scenario, I will sell most of my long term stash and live like a king in Patagonia.

I have a bunch of buys at 3.5-5K in case I am wrong. I doubt they will be filled. I think this scenario is unlikely, but still possible.

**tl;dr:**

* position: based on r/r, long everything
* stops: if you must have them, below 6K
* short term upside target: 9-10K
* longer term (summer) upside target: ATH
* very long term target: 50-100K
* probability of /u/nannal event: outside chance
* comments: TA works for bitcoin, repeatedly, and better than for other markets, IMNSHO. Also, I am buying equities.

38,400 BTC volume in one hour on BFX alone. I think calling this a "pump" is a *slight* understatement. 
Nice breakout through and above Camarilla pivot R4 with enormous and historic levels of conviction as based on volume.  Price consolidation above 7579 is likely for another test at 8K again later today.  

I expect another short squeeze before day's end based on the miniscule selling post breakout.  Textbook bull flag, volume profile combined with R4 pivot breakout = this move is not over just yet.
This bounce has really messed up my trading mindset. I have no conviction in taking a position any longer. I went long at 7680 20min ago and closed at 7710 after taking funding.

I feel uncomfortable longing a move caused primarily by retail shorters getting suqeezed. My cold storage is an unlveraged  long position so I guess I'm rooting for the bulls to pump this to dizzying heights but I won't be margin pumping that rise.

My next trade will probably be a short at the log resistance line or if we fall under 6.8. Goodluck if you're still trading this, you're braver than I. 
idk about you guys, but im getting chopped the fuck up. way too impatient for this kind of crap

From what I have seen om many other pumps / moonings is that each time they retraced some after a consolidation period. Also they were trading outside the bollingerbands and cooling off for another pump. That said and with a bunch of salt, I think we will se a retest of the 7200-400 support before moving up past 8K.
Still don’t think the bottom is in?
Thats got to be one of the highest hourly volumes of all time and we are only 30 mins in. Holy.

Quick question: Do people here really the bear market is over? I'm probably going to get downvoted but to me it just seems like a longer-term DCB. Not sure how high we will go - maybe low 9ks?
Stubborn bears are at the same point mentally stubborn bulls were at $19k.

Keep opening those margins, ladies. We've got a **long** ways to go.
I'm pissed. Had an entry of 6830, moved my stop at breakeven to a stop loss at 6780 yesterday evening to leave it some room to breathe, ofc it got triggered for 25$ and now the price is above my initial entry.

Thanks Soros! 
13% jump in 40 minutes isn't normal.. but on BTC it is
Well played to all those who were in long positions at the right time. 
Short $1MM @ $7640. Expecting a short term pullback of at least 4%. Stops set at 3%.

Price is gone from the top banner????



Currently on sidelines but we're breaking out above the downtrend line from 11700 on bitstamp. still got a bit to go on bitmex

Considering a small long, shorts are sky high and if we hold on bistamp to let RSIs cool off. 

looking for 1hr/4hr close above the line. Current 1hr opened above it. if it can hold im willing to bet we go up a bit more

EDIT: broke out just as i typed this... not chasing it. if we get a bounce on some sort of support then maybe.

right now, im thinking shorting a little bit at 7250, getting overbought on a lot of time frames.

EDIT2: bitmex overloaded, thats a sign. sitting this out.
Amazingly managed to get a buy in during that pump on Bitmex.

I thought I was playing it safe by PARTIALLY hedging my BTC holdings with short positions on BitMex.  Most of my hedge used the Sep 28 contract with a stop limit set at $8160, which got hit before I knew it!  So I managed to lose money overall in this BTC rally due to my partial hedge.   The Jun 29 contract on BitMEX never got that high.   Did I make a bad rookie mistake choosing to use the Sep 28 contract which had relatively low volume?  Or was this a quite unusual circumstance?

P.S.  When I entered the position (and until recently), I think its price was around $100 below the spot price of BTC. I'm surprised the contract price went so much higher than the BTC price so quickly!

For those that value his opinion, Tone Vays is more bearish now than ever. He says that all this was was a short squeeze (not entirely inaccurate). 

He's predicting 4 more days (max) of bullish movement and rejection at the 50 day moving average. 

Edit: My personal opinion is that while he could be right, this pump is exactly what Bitcoin needed to regain interest from Joe-Blow on the street, and with some lucky news (Positive SEC regulation, ETFs, etc.) and a little FOMO, it might lead us out of this bear market. 
I wonder whether this formation is a new bart pattern. I’m going to get it tattood on my ass if it spikes up again above 8k in a day or two and then subsequently crashes back down to <6900 in minutes

I shall call it “The Batman”
Hey all just wanted to share with you because i have no one else to share to.

This week was my first ever week trading and I’ve made 9 trades. Every trade I’ve made I’ve produced ( some small some large ). I’m only working with baby amounts of BTC ( .3- 1 BTC ) on my trades. 

In the last 24 hours I’ve managed to 
-Open Short in high 6900’s / Close 6765
- Open a long around 6800/ Close around 7859
- Open a Short around 7850/ Close around 7575
- Open a long at 7669 / Close around 7935
- Open a short at 7985 / Close at 7796

Currently have a Short Open from 7918 and looking to close them re Open a long for run to 8k+. All I can say is in the past I’ve led greed get to me, I’m not out here to make thousands anymore ( well of course I am) but If I can take profits, even if I could have made 100$ more I’ll take the profits.

Good Luck trading everyone!  

Edit: Just closed my current short from 7918 at 7754. 

Edit edit: Opened another short at 7913 at the top of the shoulders on the head and shoulder on the 30 minute. Target 7.5k
This is a reversal guys.  Me and the rest of the bears who predicted it would go down were wrong.  Time to suck it up and go long at the next good entry point, maybe around 7.5k.  This doesn't mean the bear market is over, but I think we can at least say the Q2 short term reversal is here.  

Also the alts are once again tanking in btc ratio.  this might mean that we'll see another alt coin boom when this trend hits its peak so be looking for that.

Pump and dump?

I thought the shorts ATH was a meme but Good Lord they've gone parabolic. 

Pump to 7.7 to slaughter the freeloading bears. Gtfo my goblin town train sloppy's grandma. 

The only trading rule that supersedes "short the corn" is "beware the parabola".
I bought BTC at 19k, it crashed and I panic sold at 6k then rebought at 11.5k just to get rekt again and sold at 6.4.

Last night I decided to buy back and put all my BTC on a short on bitmex in case it went down again because it always happens to me. 

Well, I just got liquidated....

Anyways, i think now is a good time to buy back in though. Goodluck trading guys. 
Pls be real please be real. I want the bear market to end so badly.
I guess it depends how you draw it but my rising wedge is strating to break down following a rejection by the 4h cloud

So, I picked a bad day to fly home from vacation. Got in late last night. Alarms didn't wake me. Managed to add to my short at 7920, but what a 1h candle. Short to midterm charting is rendered moot for the next few hours, so all I can really do is watch and decide what my (new) bailing point is. Alarms were at 7300, but....lol

Maximum pain 

Edit to add: at least I have my June futures long from 6410 still 
Good morning guys, anything interesting happening?
(neutral question). Still a long distance to go, but why would breaking the 20k-downtrend line (somewhere in the 9k region) signify the "end of the bear market." Obviously, there would be a nice rally if we go beyond that line, but aren't market reversals more opaque. Many people were still in disbelief when we were dropping from 20k. Only in retrospect "it was obvious to everybody." Wouldn't the restore of faith in the market be a more gradual proces? Or is there some asymmetry between market reversals from bull/bear to bear/bull markets respectively? 

My point being, whatever the price is, there will always be bull vs. bear arguments to be made, because if uncertainty or risk are erased, efficient markets will just jump to a different price where risk is involved.
15% of my stack short from 6940.

10x position, and the plan is to add to this in the 7's and if we get a wick or something, in the low 8's.

not sure we will se 8k in the short term, but thats th plan for now.

The only comforting thing about the massive amounts of longs and shorts open is that I believe they must be mostly low leverage. That means that a lot of people have a position in Bitcoin using their existing capital to trade; not mobilizing fresh capital.

That can mean two things:

1. There are more people trading Bitcoin now than there were during the bull run. Hence a greater volume in longs and shorts is to be expected; don’t forget that the price is also 1/3 of ATH

2. Any movements (up or down) on spot markets could be sustainable without a massive bounce back.

Psychologically, I anticipate that shorts will close sooner than longs would take profit. If we dump to 5900, many shorts could close, while if we pump to 8k, it’s not necessarily given that longs will close... maybe the bottom is in; could be more prudent to let it ride.

I’m out of a position. Closed my long from 6740 and just holding BTC now.

Another interesting fact is that due to the low-ish volume on spot markets, this whole thing is one hell of a toss-up. Any larger player could move spot price in either direction and then it really just comes to when/if longs or shorts start closing and covering.

I bet that if we dump, 5900+ holds. And I’m more willing to be on that than to bet that 7.5-8k is the top (in a future longer time-frame) of whatever next pump we may see.

I think we are still range bound, but could see a pump to 7500 over the weekend.

I also anticipate a fakeout... fakeouts have been happening a lot lately, and therefore I’ve got some buy order sub 6900 and will be having tight stops if they hit. Not planning on shorting for anything more than a quick hedge on my trading stack

AAAANNNDDD a dump while I wrote that. Some buy orders hit, but still still got some sub 6800. Stop below 6700
Turn your screen upside down.. Look at the chart. Are you bullish or bearish?

People would be screaming overwhelmingly bullish with it flipped. Yet for some reason right now not many want to accept the reality that, for the short to medium term, we are overwhelmingly looking at more down.

I can't wait for the bear market to end but it isn't close yet. I do expect 6.5k to break eventially, I still think 6k will go. Would love to be wrong but I'm being a realist 
Higher lows, lower highs confirmed for today

Currently looking at alts and probably moving away from playing with BTC on Mex.

I’m really starting to get bullish, we got really tight for few days and popped like a dirty pimple.

On the daily it doesn’t look too surprising: https://www.tradingview.com/x/qvHfl1xL/


If we zoom in though, 6:55 swing low to scare/liquidate longs then a pump back up and burst at 11:00 bang on. https://www.tradingview.com/x/clYrecK1/


Even though im getting bullish this sort of manipulation terrifies me. I like to joke about the boogieman “market makers”, Smith would call it the “invisible hand” but lets be real: this whole market moves on decisions of some fat as fuck whale. That makes me question every move and decision.

EDIT:wrong link
My current position:

1. Short 15000 contracts at 6930 5x leverage liquidation around 8600.

2. 2.2 BTC reinvested from fiat in the past 24 hours.

3. An amount in fiat ready to buy back in if we fall further

Strategy: 

1. If we break out to the upside, I’ll be watching for a convincing break of 7.2-7.5 and holding above it for several days. If so, I’ll close my short at a slight loss, offset by my BTC holding. If we break 8k convincingly, with volume and hold above for several days I will consider swapping to a low leverage long.

2. If we break to the downside, I have stops on my BTC set at 6700, and will let my short ride as far down as sell pressure will allow before closing. If we get towards lower 6-6.2, I’ll consider buying in a little more, and save some fiat to buy in if we get to 5500.

My ultimate goal is to accumulate as much BTC as possible in the medium term to ride a reversal over the next 18-24 months.

Does the above sound a reasonable strategy?

Edit: I should add that if we go up to but fail to break 7.1-7.2, I’ll be increasing my short position to raise the entry point.
Funding rate on Bitmex (shorts pay longs) is once again at an almost ridiculous rate (0.1354% in 13 hours). Jumping into an aggressive long position now, even with 5-6x leverage, is a really low-risk + high reward proposition. A conservative stop loss can be put at 10 USD under the lowest price of yesterday's range which we broke out from (6756 for Bitmex swaps, 6777 on Bitfinex), which limits the potential loss to under 3%. The funding rate will help to further reduce this loss if we go under. 

I can't see a better opportunity than now to gamble on a mid to longer term long position. 
The mid-term downtrend line will be at 7000 in an hour or so, if bulls can't even make a 150$ move to get there I propose that they simply pack it up and let it go to 3k, seriously this is just bad.

Has this bullflag convinced anyone to open up a small long ? 
The bears got greedy so the bears got slammed. No way they dodged that train. Gonna take major momo to reverse that move especially with more shorts being forced to cover at a loss.
I turned bearish and the whole world is bullish? Not fair...
Alright so i only got into trading bitcoin around 2 months ago, so i dont really know any better conditions apart from the low-volume, easily influenced bitcoin that we've been trying to trade.

I've really been waiting for the volume to come back i think it will take away a lot of the unpredictableness of bitcoins movement. My question to the people that have been doing this for a while: does it really get easier/more predictable to trade when trading volume returns, or is that just a meme?
Are people forgetting that there are lots of sidelines traders awaiting a breakout one way or the other (which obviously just occurred with historic volume confirmation)? Charts don't care about organic or inorganic -- that is not a traders' concern but that of the moonboy.
Don't know why my fellow bears are shorting this. If you didn't get a short in above 7.9 there's no point going in now. At least wait for a day or two of stagnation before calling the bluff. 

I'm short term bullish now though, still out of position. 
That candle on the 12hourly!  It was about $1300. Another one of those and we're over the long-term trend line down from the ATH...
people are ready to buy. it might not happen soon but once we start rising up again it’s gonna be insane 
This rally is encouraging, but I would suggest looking at mid May 2014, when the big downtrend line was broken and BTC jumped from $420 to $680.   At the time, it seemed like the bear market was over, but then it started to drop again...all the way below $200, and the bear market didn't end for another 15 months (from June 2014).

So we aren't out of the woods yet by any stretch.
This just broke every major resistance line and broke the long term downward channel. Major bullish sign. Let’s go boys 
overbought on every time frame under 12h, this has to retrace a little bit at least. 
5 hours ago: LOL, stupid leveraged shorters, way to get rekt for being greedy!

7.4k and shorts just barely started closing... what if the short squeeze begins?
wow wow this pump is CRAZY!!!
Jesus H Christ.

I quite literally went to take a shit, came back and shat myself again when I saw the screen. 

What in holy fuck balls was that?!

Now this is interesting because we got over the first hurdle of 7.5k... Let's see how the next 4 to 5 hours play out and assess the situation  
What is happening? I already sold all my holdings a month ago or so. What is making the price shoot up? Should I jump in again?!
I hear the cry of a million bears. Bitcoin's like "lets print the largest squeeze candle in history".
After getting tortured in the last 3 months, I won't be buying in until it reaches 10k and hold for at least 3 days.
Did I miss any news? Just checked the price after 24 hours. Couldn't find anything of importance
Massive dump on Longs too on BFX, similar to shorts closing percentage.

Fact remains that shorts ratio remains high. Curious to see when it lands or if it cascades further. 
I just put everything on a short, stupid idea maybe but I got absolutely rekt. Praying for 7600. 

Was this it? Was this maximum pain? This better be the end. 
[deleted]
So is this the most textbook bull flag ever or are we doing another Bart? RSI is still crazy overbought, but formation wise it looks very clean or ?
Told you (twice) that those shorts were a ticking time bomb and prone for a decent squeeze, though TBH I was expecting much greater push. Nonetheless ~12% jump in 45 minutes was a sight to be seen. Reduced my long position by 1/3 (for now) for a possible dip as it jumped too much, too quickly, but I'd like to see another push, before reconsidering my medium term outlook as we're far from breaking bear trend.

If you did not see this coming, you weren't paying attention.

Can we break 7750? That would pretty much destroy the downtrend.

Looks like it's a fight! 
but but muh short, muh easy money
Good news this classic is still on target :D https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/YRZvdurN-The-target-of-current-bubble-lays-between-40k-and-110k/
Have never in my life been so relieved to get out of a short at breakeven. Thank God. 

EDIT: actually i made 20$ by exiting a few $ lower and maker fees. Dush wings again, haters rekt
As a noob coming up on his first year of buying crypto, is this sort of price stability between 6600 and 7k ideal for the future or do y'all think we should still be moving? I don't trade much but it seems to me that this sort of concrete wall that's being built in this range is what we need moving forward for bitcoin. Bit of a reality check. 
Serious question about stop-limits on GDAX - if I set my sell order stop price to $6700 and my limit price to $6699.99, could it get rejected if/when the market hits $6700 since it essentially needs to execute the sell as a taker order (1 cent lower than the trigger point)?

Following this line of thought, it seems I should rather set my sell stop to $6700 and my corresponding limit price to $6700.01 so that it executes as a maker and doesn't get rejected. Let me know if I'm going crazy here.

FYI GDAX allows me to do both, which is confusing
Saw some spoofed buys on kraken, don't see it any more though.  I wasn't watching other exchanges, but be careful buying the dip.  It could be a whale getting ready to accumulate some more longs.

Edit: Saw it on BITFINEX too.  Careful, I wouldn't be surprised to see another big red candle.  Full disclosure I have a solid short going, but I'm trying to be objective.
 What limits the availability of BTC used for shorting. Are they BFX cold storage?

what happens if we reach 100k shorts? squeeze to moon or dig a crater.
I wanted to check long - short ratio btcusd data and ended up here https://www.bfxdata.com/positions/btcusd. When I try to open the site, my browser craps up and tells me something about insufficent memory, though I am quite sure my 48GB Ram should be sufficient to display whatever bloody website. Where do you get your info from for looking this set of data up?
Oh mother of god, why did bitmex go DOWN this morning so I could not move my stop when the obvious whale dump move occured? Anyway, I relonged at 6818 or something on swaps at least, but not with as much leverage or position size :(
where is the upper line of the bear channel from january right now?

Thanks in advance.

yesssssssssssss
Dammit. I've been 50% fiat since we first hit 6.7k on the way down. I just sat down to buy in with another 25%,  got distracted for 30 mins, come back and there's a $700 candle.
Kraken down, any other exchanges unable to handle this epic chaos?
Fuck, had a sell order at 5800 euros. Went out to buy lunch and back to this. Fomo or no ? :/
Got on my fight an hour ago at $6900. I thought my phone was glitching
Tried to open a short from 8050 with 5x Leverage but Kraken shit the bed. I’m not happy 
I came within 1% of getting liquidated on my hedging short on Bitmex.   I got some more funds in there, but it had already started to drop after hitting $8100 anyway.  The downtrend break was a classic buy signal, so should have covered half of my position there, but was too lazy and distracted.  Oh well.
Good idea to short on bitmex? It's trading at a $200 premium, seems smart to short 

Edit: premium fluctuates between $100-$200
longs down to 27k !! amazing. we got more fuel for up. but i think retest of 7.4k first
Many big orders gathering below 7600 on finex, this might not drop back as far as people think.
Kraken managed to pull their act together.

Short from 7893 with 5X leverage. 

Feeling just dandy. Stops above 8100 
Did anyone keep track that how many bitcoin was bought during the pump?
Round 2?
Did someone else also needs to fill in a KYC form on bitstamp. (not by email/writing, which I did last time, but they seem to have new form with checkboxes etc.)

Didn't login for two months and account was empty. Now it says "fill in KYC to complete your transfer." (didn't do any transfer yet)

Not sure if their (new) system/policy is going for pre-screening instead of post-screening, or if they are targeting me personally (which would be odd since my account was inactive)

are people still bullish here?? i shorted at 7610 lol :( gonna hold it.  stop loss at 15 percent loss. 
Guys, hello! 

When should I trade futures and when should I trade swaps on Bitmex and also do I trade the Junes or Sept when and why? I noticed June futures were the lowest for like over 2% compared to swaps, but now they are equal or even higher in this bull rally? Does this mean they are better for shorting and as good as for longs compared to swaps or this is totally random?

So how do I exactly decide?
I think we'll see a few underwater shorts closing at this local dip. I've been on the sidelines with my trading stack since 7.3k but will start scaling in here. My first entry was now at 6.8k.

As chewy said earlier today, the decending channel from 11.7k seems to want to break upwards: https://www.tradingview.com/x/TMoa1Drn/

I've been building a bullish narrative now for some time, and I feel there's small confirmations along the way. A failure to break a lower low here (previous local low being 6.6k) is a bullish signal.
Thinking back to the OKEX long liquidation rollback (and the surrounding drama: https://twitter.com/8bitandstuff/status/979488349038592001)

Not so much luck today for the big shorts on OKEX.

Despite the volume, today's short squeeze was not the same level of liquidation cascade, but do you think the OKEX rollback was the real decision that the bottom was in at $6k? i.e. the price will literally not be allowed to go lower.
Everyone says short squeeze, but I don't see it, the longs covered just as much as the shorts.  I think this is going up more.
[deleted]
Fun fact, the 1 HR RSI on Bitmex was the highest it has been since August 5th during today's pump. Second highest was the ATH at 20k, and 3rd highest was the DCB to 16k+. So, based on history, we are either mooning or dumping hard. 
I would be surprised if this doesn't result in yet another mini-pump up to 8K. It seems whoever is doing this really want us to hit that 8K level.
[removed]
Lost 20% of my stack yesterday (i set my stop limit too close from the trigger) and just regained it with whatever it was. This is a dangerous game... It's like a repear from the last rise with a dump at the resistance line, whales don't care about it being predictable it seems.
Thanks Chewie! 
Release the Kraken.
Welcome back, sir.
I told you all! I tried to warn you.
i was in a meeting for 2 hours and then had lunch... when I went away we were at 6800... can u tell me what happened? any news?
So, I was thinking about analysing some lesser-used charts today, to show how there was something fishy going on, but it's too late now. Those who read yesterday will remember that I was watching the 4h kumo breakout. I wimped out on opening a spot position, but fortunately I did add to my 10-day old long position, so my saltiness is mitigated.

I'm using BFX for today's analysis, mainly because I've noticed wilder swings there than on 'mex... which was clearly also an early warning. The 4h breakout is clean, with the momentum lines having sliced through the thin cloud and dragged the chikou through the thick stuff. If we hold steady then we'll get some thick cloud support for the second half of this month, if we go on a wild bull run, we might not. 

4h: https://www.tradingview.com/x/lpIgpjOB/

Although the breakout extends to the 6h (but not the 12h), my real interest is the daily, not least because I have been eyeing up this thin kumo window for a good while now. Yesterday, it seemed a mile away, now it's actually looking likely. We just saw nearly 40k coins change hands in an hour on BFX and it took us half way there. Now, I'm not saying there won't be a massive sell off if we get anywhere near it (I'm betting on it, in fact.), but there's a week and a half to get there before the window closes. 

Of course, it's early in the day to know how the chart will turn out at midnite GMT, but we can predict on the basis of the new local high. The kijun won't shift until we break 9.2k (which is also the kumo target incidentally), but the tenkan is going to leap up and put a weak bullish cross on the cards. If we maintain the current price, then the chikou will be very close to a break above price too, adding further weight to the bullish scenario.

1d: https://www.tradingview.com/x/6PQ443c8/

FWIW: I won't be changing my flair even if we break out on the daily. It would take a change in the 3d forecast for that. Bullish target is still 11.5k! 
the shorts chart was a rising wedge that broke down. ;\)

[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/l6Yip9oC/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/l6Yip9oC/)
So I closed [this short from earlier](http://reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8bnetl/daily_discussion_thursday_april_12_2018/dx8kmxr) at 761X.xx right before lunch. 

Having no idea where it goes from here means I'll take profit and wait again for the next good entry point. 

Losing buying pressure, anyone see us firmly breaking 8k today?
[deleted]
I think plenty of people are going short-term short here, and for good reasons. But I don't think many people are actually selling bitcoin at these prices.
Moving the stop loss on my long up to 7572 before going to bed tonight. Not sure what's next from here and I want to be able to sleep.
And that is why you don't short bitcoin. (It's not like they were not warned.)
What we're seeing now is, dare I say it, bull market behavior. Retracement to 7,600 has an epic bounce... BTFD?

EDIT: spoke too soon. Some epic trade wars going on.
This pop today seemed MIGHTY familiar to me. History repeats?
https://www.tradingview.com/x/PwDrdZ7w/
this is a fake out! I think we will go sub 6k next

the same happend in 2014 but first a fake out to the downside and then to the upside!

shorts got succesfully squeezed. only 28k shorts left open.

closed all longs and opend a small short. 
Valid breakouts are often punished. My advice: do not short this.
with this low volatility , alt coins making big moves and the mid term trend line just touching and that converging support vs resistance in any day now, I think it's time for a quite big long but low leverage position at 6928 https://www.tradingview.com/x/qdlcrY5s



And that everyone and their mother is shorting is a stat I can not ignore. 
So, i'm guessing mom and pop and the likes will be alerted by MSM about how "BTC is at it again"

we need new fiat in crypto...i hope they're not turned off by the huge dip from the mid Jan ATHs
[removed]
A dump for ants and a decent recovery... I get the feeling we're going to break out of the downward channel before the weekend begins. Might see some nice green the coming days.

BTC has been at the consolidation phase since the start of the month, basing on the stabilization of the price. does anyone have opinions when it will break up/break down and which direction we're heading to?

Holy crapperino... Thank god I bought some more btc yesterday
Will crashed alts go up again after the pump has settled?
Hahahaha I thought that red candle last night was big....
rekt short at 7150 .. hold or close .. hmmm
[removed]
So anyone want to update us on how many shorts are left?  
[removed]
So morning dump turning into bear trap? Always nice to see :)
Opened a margined long at $7703. Will get completely liquidated if price drops below $7400. It really looks like the market is turning around so not the craziest thing Ive done in trading
Anecdotal, but someone just ate a 95 BTC sell wall at $7,740 on BFX in one bite. I know stuff similar to this happens all the time, but that was the first time I've seen a sell wall taken down so aggressively recently. Entirely possible that the seller wanted to sell there.
https://i.gyazo.com/0c91061b3d9fb0195d0dc1c2b8f2ad0e.png

Yarp.
We did not even hit 7.1 (the top of the lower high I was anticipating). Perhaps it's just a minor dip and people really are accumulating the lower bound of this see-saw but the weakenss of any pump follow through should not be ignored. 

Edit: a pump back to >7k would make me short term bullish. 
Closed all my longs at $7690...wow everyone long at sub $7k must be smiling with me.....and that guy that longed $4m at $6800 is gonna have champagne tonight.....

Wow, Mex really shitting the bed.  More than I've ever seen.  Glad I got a few limit take profits and stop losses in there on the btc long  before getting completely blocked out.

Worried that the eth fut plummeted as btc pumped (I'm long eth as well as btc).  Ratio got destroyed!  Wonder if it'll catch up.  Oh well, I can't close that one now anyway!

Im expecting a dump now but if it holds above 7,2, it would be a win anyway. Who in the right mind market buys so many btc
[removed]
I know technical analysis can be unreliable. BUT i do think that BTC will continue to fall. There is just not enough volume atm. It's possible that the temporary increase is cause BTC is finding some support due to the RSI and 50week MA. 
Here's my full thoughts: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWZo00bIkx8&feature=youtu.be
Whales still selling huge blocks on GDAX...I figured they might relax a little bit after that one bearwhale sold 500+ BTC (all ask blocks) in the $6.9ks yesterday, but nope.
I've been scalping trades in this flag. I don't know which side to commit to... is waiting for the next big move a smart idea?
Anyone here trading on Bitmex exclusively with June/Sep futures? I like the low fees but the liquidity is terrible, thinking of just going back to swaps.
On Kraken: is there a way to set a stop loss and a take profits at the same time? 

I’m headed to work and if it runs up to 8200 i want to take profits. 

If it drops below 7500 I want my stop loss to trigger.

I think buying pressure needs to be a bit stronger here. It would be absolutely disastrous for the bulls if after the best case scenario (a gigantic manipulated huge short liquidiation) reverts back below 7.2. I will be bullish if I see a rally sustained by any real continual buying volume. 
So was there any actual news to provoke the movement or was it all just some whale making a large trade that just forced the short squeeze?
Bitcoin and altcoins have found utility as a gambling tool without the social taboos of casinos attracting traditional gamblers and more ‘sophisticated’ gamblers using technical analysis to justify their gambling decisions.

Bitfinex, Bitmex and Okcoin are the casinos of choice and they retain a house edge by pumping and dumping to liquidate positions at will. At this point, I’m pretty certain one day within the next few years I’m going to go to Bitfinex and see the US seized domain image.
Biggest fakeout in bitcoin history incoming? Might be tough to beat the one right before the ETF decision though (percentage wise).
Lol, finex leading the charge.
I'm 50% of stack in short from 6960 with 5X.  How far down do I ride this????

Edit: 50% of YOLO stack
Nice bitcoin nice. 
That guy asking a few days before must have lost all of his savings by now... Poor idiot
6h, 4h, 2h, 1h and 30m RSI are all still \>70... because of that I think we will stay here a bit longer
I have no idea where this is going to go. So I think i'm going to play it safe and place 2 stop positions, one long at 7800 if the bear flag breaks up (target 8100), and one short at 7480 if it breaks down (target 7250). 


My dude u/pureeboi was right but got bear-fudded/spooked out of his long from 6.7. 

F....
Possible head and shoulders forming on the 30min/1hr.
Still early though right shoulder is yet to be complete.

BitMEX is hilariously useless. I was trying to get an order in *before* this sudden move up, but was still unable to. Now that it started moving, I'm not even going to try.
been out of position for this and fighting fomo hard as we are way overbought on 1hr and 4hr and overbought on 6hr and almost overbought on 12hr with no end in sight
Wtf happened? Soros bought the market?
So I guess we're expecting a bit of a drop after that?
But what about the Future(s)? :D
Seriously though, wont this be brought down to Match tomorrows Futures at 6920 or sth?
Can someone help me understand the correlation between the stock markets and the bitcoin/crypto market? The moves are not as violent on the stock market but they are almost identical to each other. For instance all stock markets had a huge spike this morning along with us. 

Why do some many people on the Bitmex leaderboards have hyphenated 3 word usernames? Are these just randomly generated?
If I did shorting I would be shorting this...back to $7k ish in a day or 2 is my opinion, maybe little bit sub $7k.....Setting my buys for $7k, $6,9, $6.8 etc
Despite a large pump just now, most of us here are incredibly bearish on this market.  If there is a any indicator of an incoming market change, it's when there is a high manic level towards the opposite direction.
1hr RSI at 92..Everything under 12hrs is overbought.
Everybody thinks now we go up to new ATH etc. It feels to bullish here and I doubt to catch the bottom will be so easy.

Why I think we might break heavily down again is this: [https://imgur.com/a/Zpc6y](https://imgur.com/a/Zpc6y) \(see post below for another chart\)

In 2014 we where at the same &#37; level and had then two weekly spikes, first one downspike and than another upspike. If we follow such a pattern it could be the other way round now, first an upspike and than a massive downspike. What do you think? Where would be a good stop of prevent to get rekt if that happens? I closed my long, but could just reopen again, dont want to miss the move to a new ATH... ;\)
I know it is probably not related. But perhaps trumps recent outrage towards Syria & Russia might have contributed? Fear of fiat value collapse. 

Yesterday's tweet by trump did infact move the Ruble back to a new low compared to the last 3 or 6 years (not sure if it was 3 or 6)


Help
short squeeze v2.0?
Updated outlook, this is going to grind up to 8.4k. That will be that, I'll go all in on a longer term short from there
[removed]
Wow, the FOMO is real!  Hope no one is crazy enough to think this is sustainable.  

FYI, CNBC is going crazy on BTC so that sure seems bearish
[removed]
I'm short term bullish now but just consider the implications of a breakdown/full retracement from this rally. It would be catastrophic. I'm looking for 7.2 to hold with a last line of defence at 7k. 

Anything under 7k that holds for even a few hours is doom for Bitcoin's price. 
Was spam clicking 7400 short for 3min. What a garbage system bitmex. 
Short again, fully hedged at 7700. This is the absolute top i expectedd from any fake out. No brainer short imo

LOL RIP
This whole thing was really really strange, because longs and shorts pilled up  before the spike and closed both at the same time without any price movement, like buying from one account and selling with the other one. That is not organic from normal traders closing and longing at the same time. There must be an other reason and this might be it:

One theory: To save taxes whales \(or 1 whale\) try to make loses with one account \(official account\) and give these losses to another account. Income tax can be up to 45&#37; so there is a big incentive to do so, if they are able to reduce their gains it reduces the amount of taxes they have to pay \(having a hidden account, other country, etc. in the backhand\).

Dude that's so great! <3
Glad to have you back.
wholesome as hell
Totally agree. Wanna add my 2 cents to your comment. Interesting thing is that today's earlier 200$ dump till $6750 occurred with the rise of shorts. After I noticed this, I thought that somebody or several big whales were trying to defend their short positions by putting big spoofy sell walls, which worked perfectly enough for some period of time. Everybody here noticed that when we are having little and fast pump, and the orderbook at finex just gets crazy. Another version is that the whales were trying to accumulate more BTC by dumping the price down with those walls and when they just saw that today's dump were financed by 2k shorts, they decided to squeeze them. 
Excellent contribution. This appears to be precisely what happened. 

I think this bodes well for crypto, as to me this signals motivation to continue to push up the price. 
This is great, great analysis of what was happening and continues to play out now. Notice that leveraged longs on Bitfinex crashed at first as it pumped but they have now quickly started to increase again.
Nothing tells us they won't do the opposite around 8.4 and dump very quickly, profiting from all the leveraged longs opened meanwhile.
pff  that's just part of the accumulation. Locked in buyers waiting to sell at breakeven? Or holders waiting to sell at profit? which sounds easier to push through? 

and if they do want to sell at breakeven? fantastic more accumulations for the smart money at these low prices.
[deleted]
And people say early adoption has ended. I say it's just getting started. 
Does anyone have a breakdown of shorts vs longs just prior to the explosion?
Would that even have been a factor in the decision making of whoever did this?
What are the odds this was a new player to the game (please don't say Soros)?
you don't think we can go over 8k?
Thoughts on shorting from here?
great timing
What did you start your long at? Hope you made a nice profit. I limit sold a portion at 7950. I'm scaling in sells up to ~8400 where I think we'll hit strong resistance and retest ~8000. 
Oh boy - I just re-opened, feeling a big push above $8k in the next few hours. This move just didn't retrace enough, I don't think we're done
1 stake is 5% of your trading stack right?
Just came here to read this exact sentence :D
I mentioned this in the last thread but at this point we shouldn't assume they are naked shorts. They could be hedges or used to make a straddle position.

If they are covered then there will be no squeeze. Big players can accumulate this way and then close with the trend.
Seems you were right 
Mashallah brother. 
Indeed. I find it kind of dull in comparison. It's like all your mates taking up poker. They sit there in silence moving their chips around with their eyes hanging out while you're off doing something more interesting. 
Honestly that’s a pretty solid analysis tho
bull flag^2
Same here opened a long at 7700

I think we will be revisiting 8200 quicker then I expect. 
When are you ever wrong .... ( Knock on wood )
Mental stops sub 7.5k?
Longed with you because I regret not doing so earlier. 

Stops? 
same here - what's your target?
Was your post the signal? Quick little pump a minute after I read it lol

Do I dare take the opposite trade here? 
Hey /u/_chewtoy_,

Did you open this long with June futures or swaps? Also, where did you setup your stops? Appreciate your input as always.
[deleted]
How many times has he done this?
thank you for articulating this. I find it hilarious how dismissive some people here are about this move. 
if you check the weekly bbands the volume is not high at all. okay we had massive volume in these last hours, but before the volume is really low!
until now it's redefining gambling, not money. money with 15% moves in an hour is useless

Do we have the juice to break 8.6-8.8 during this upturn and leave our long term down trend once and for all is the question... 
Curious why you would want to short under $8k when the log resistance line is at $9k.  Seems like a recipe for prematurely getting stopped out before the drop.  Why not start layering into a short in the mid $8ks?

EDIT: Just re-read and I see that you're expecting the upward sloping support turned resistance to be the top.  I'm not totally convinced about that line having much effect but maybe it would be good to start layering in before that... From $8100 up to $8900 with an avg of $8400... Or maybe just play each one individually (short the uptrend line with stops at $8300 and jump back into a short in the mid to upper $8k if you get stopped).
If we consolidate above 7700, that's a hell of a bull flag.
Thanks for the analysis. 

Would you consider this in-between resistance line from 19k also valid? Black one on the shart, from 19k through the first 11.7k 
https://www.tradingview.com/x/03Z6KUC6/
You have it at 8175 now, but it's rising fast. You could be stopped out at 8200 only to see the house of cards falling apart at 8300.

Personally I plan to short heavily there while everyone screams moon.
Cut your short and move on
Excellent overview.
He may end up being right yet. Give it through the weekend. 
Ahh, I missed your post. I too had planned for his prediction that there would be a big drop. However, I always set stops in case it goes the other way (I got stopped out after we hit 7200). 


He always makes hard line predictions. Take what he says with a grain of salt.
Awesome trades. Props. 

I added to more short around 7750 again as well. Looking to close around 7.3-7.4
Well played! Cheers :) 
that woulda hurt some people
It takes a very special person to margin trade on an unregulated fraudulent exchange that admits to trading on its own platform. These shorts were probably liquidated by the people running Bitfinex.
man you called this the other day..freaking amazing call..thanks
Next two weeks are critical.
A chewy post with a long position that only has 12 upvotes after 5 hours. Don’t need BFXData to tell me that the herd here is likely still very much short. Totally anecdotal, but interesting to me. 
I’m not seeing it yet, unless I’m off on something?
https://www.tradingview.com/chart/enh2wsdU/

Could you post a chart with your descending channel? Quite curious how it looks. Thanks in advance.
what about that bear div on the 2h and the hidden bear div on the 4h?
LOL
10m  @ 7102 https://twitter.com/BitmexRekt/status/984387649006981120

Think that was the biggest, anyone see a bigger one?
That's it, first chewy and now ibankbtc going long, I had 10% of my stash on a 5x long, increasing that to 50%.
This chart is unbelievably sexy 
Of course there will be a huge sell off.  The same whales that found liquidation points for shorts, will do the same for over exuberant longs at some point.
bull run? Fuck that is funny. 10 min BULL RUN BOYZ!
Lol bullrun , just bots on Bitfinex pushing the price up.
upregulation due lack of cola nuts
Low volume at the end of wedges have sparked large candles for both $7k and $11.7k now. 

Low volume price "suppression" or "support" should really be looked at much more carefully in the future. 
At least u got gold! 
I've been preaching bullish for ages and was afk and short lol. we'd grown to content with the slow squeeze it seems
> This is how I dream the rest of the year plays out

don't ever wake up
The stew sounds like its made of human blood and tears you cannibal.
We broke out of a sizeable symmetrical triangle that encapsulated the entire low volatility move from 1st April till today (before the pump). 

A possible scenario that may happen after today's move is that we turn back down to retest the upper border or apex of that triangle as support, which would put the price of Bitcoin in the 6.9 - 7k range, before we bounce. So don't be surprised if 7.5k does not hold us.
Interesting analysis thanks for sharing.

At a more macro level, do you think another BTC ATH is probable this year, or are we more likely in a 2014 style swing?


That's still a shit ton in the fund. 
Kind of new to this.  Can you elaborate more on what that means?  I thought bitmex would make money on liquidating those shorts?
do you know what the haircut percentage was on the winners?

Damn those overleveraged traders make it worse for everyone else.
Realistically, I scratch my head and sit on my hands for too long and miss out.

Just being real about it.

Double down, lose more money! 
What fact has changed? Longs now outnumber shorts again. Nearly half of that candle was closing/liquidating shorts. We're still 18% under the downtrend line from ATH. 

Not saying this can't be a reversal. It just isn't yet.
the only fact that has changed is that Bitcoin is at 7700 and not 6700.

Let’s not get carried away, but no stops tonight
Did you set any profit taking above too or are you really letting it ride up?
I see a high probability of breaking out, however, its a matter of time and when will it happen. 

I am patiently keeping my long open above its entry.
Pretty much exactly what I'm thinking. It's nice to have independent confirmation.
> Short Term Thoughts

Some nice indicators you're working with there. Interesting UI choices taken. I have some background colour changes which could be more like those blue/red squares.
Goddamnit...  bought some without properly reading the short-term and sure enough here goes the dip :/
First time seeing this kind of graph and TA, can you link me some guides for this?
Use them gains to buy a bigger monitor
How can anyone be confident in TA when confronted with such obvious manipulation?
Very nice
Good trade 
One good trade and you'll make that up in no time!

I don't think there is anything organic about that, a decent short squeeze I think. 
it’s funny because of the dump this morning. It felt like soem whales wanted to test the waters before loading up
You deserve a vacation 
Congrats !
Seeing as we seem to be following the 2014 pattern spookily close, do you expect this to top out near the log down trend line?  That's my target for shorts.  Awesome trade btw - I had a strong hunch it was time to shoot up but a strict no longs in the bear market rule... stings a little for sure right now.
nice job
Congrats Chew! What do you think of EOS?
Shorts hitting 40k without us moving down was when it got kinda silly. 

I was saying it didn't matter much a few days ago but slowly began to reconsider especially after a conversation with Xxdan_evansxx yesterday. Just a little too late...and I didn't act on it

I remember calling this accumulation about a week ago, should've listened to myself. I shook the thought and thought I might just be being silly but all the signs were there. Another lesson learned! 

So far I'm unconvinced it's going significantly higher from here but it wouldn't take much to convince me. I just want to see legit buying instead of 67% of buy pressure being shorts closing.

Thanks for your comment. it's a good one, especially about losing money trying to trade the trend. 

People act like shorting is easy free money but really this shit is extremely difficult to do compared to buy and hold/low leveraged longing
> And while I have very solid gains from a year ago I am also down from January in spite of it being pretty obvious that the market was peaking, due to my impatience, my greed, my fear, and my attachments.

Exact same here.  Though I hit a new level the last month or so and am on the road to recovery, the ebb and flow of the profits and losses are way more managed now.

> overly attached to their position and their pet indicators and by extension, their egos. Speaking for myself, when I am attached to my ego, I stop listening.

I love your posts.
Heh. I lost money shorting Lehman brothers. It's an education.
Funny you say this was predictable, as I see in no previous post you making any solid claims that this would happen...

So I assume you're another poster who finds it easy to predict things after they've happened, and then lord it over others as some sort of oracle.
There was more fomo on the bounce from 6k.
You switched short yesterday didn't you? Man you were reading so well too! I always agree with your sentiment even if it's sharing my perma-bullish bias.
Short closures are a fraction of this recent volume. 
but longs are down too
back in the good old days
Another reason I'm still holding my short. I'm trying to nail down a definitive bail point, though, in case. 
That doesn't compute. We spent maybe 4 hours in this range in January; another 24 hours in february; maybe another 48 in March. We've been here for maybe 12 hours. Resistance isn't established in the middle of a candle, is it?
I've only seen it act as support and have it marked in my notes as such.  The only other times since then we've gone through it as resistance we went through it without any flats, and without much of a dance at all.

(but it's become legit resistance now)
Damn you're right. Its really that 7.8-8 range that has been a huge support/resist line
The I told you so's rally begins
/u/chrisgilesphoto had eyes on the ball too.

Add more fuel!
South American or just trying to think at head to next year? Just get last year's model and drive that in the snow to lower your risk and only drive the new one when it is sunny... Much more prudent that way. 
Currently out of all BTC positions but dis gon b gud.
whoa just checked the shorts and you're right over 3k opened in the last 8 hours
Shouldn't we be expecting some sort of squeeze?
The only consolation is that there are a lot of us screwed ones today my friend. I was arrogant enough not to use stop losses, and that little dip before the big lift was JUST enough to get me to add to my short. 20% of the stack gone in 30 minutes. Personal no trade ban for at least until the weekend :(
5 minute chart there was like 7 back to back to back bullflags. 

One forming right now 

( I know 5 min is irrelevant ) 
This kinda seems like the bart behavior. If there's a big spike up, but then no follow-through, it's going to eventually spike down.

[Edit 11pm local time but likely morning for those in the US]
Yes I think this is going to $8.5k before turning down again. Simply because that was the 25% move we saw at $7.3k. 

If we blast through $8.5k-9k I believe we're testing $12k again, really. 


> whoever poached 50% of all bears in existence

Of course it was one person...when I have brunch with them again, I'll ask if they're up for an encore or not.
It does start to feel like the crazyness of December but reversed... so many shorts it's quite impressive
And yet the lending rate is somehow only at 6% APR, incredibly low considering the huge risk adjustment from crypto volatility, counterparty risk, etc...

Someone is going to a lot of trouble to make shorting as easy as possible.
I wouldn't be surprised.
It’s not like they weren’t warned. 

Also, this is not stopping, so it could get a lot worse for shorts before it gets better
This is why margin trading in this kind of volatile market is extremely risky. I really don't understand why so many people here do it.
Must be exhilarating to win on leveraged trades but never want to set foot in that space for this exact reason. If simple retail crypto trading is marijuana then bitmex is like heroin. I would never be able to quit. As much as I love crypto and playing with only profits right now, there are times where I wish I never got into crypto even with 6 figure gains. Wondering if I am the only one.
yeah nights are brutal. Sometimes alarms don't work or don't wake you up, but then you also worry about setting stops while you sleep because it's easy to get stopped out sometimes, and then by the time you wake up you're right back where you were when you fell asleep! Sometimes the market will overreact like it did to 8k and then go back to 7.8 or the other way, such as going to 6.4 and then back to 6.6 very quickly.

It's a tough decision to make for sure. 
am sure you will get stopped out before we see a move down.
This is amazing!
finex orderbook and depth look crazy af.
Thats why its still running. They will close
He didn't?
I do not wish to be the only one.
He said he had stops at $7K and would revert to bullish if price went above. Saw someone say "Almond Cookie Soarer" is him on the leader board.

Either way, I doubt he got majorly rekked (he's said before that the BTC on mex is just his play stack).
The whole point of a short squeeze is that it's not a malicious action.  It's all the shorters racing to minimize their losses.  The motivation is people trying not to go broke.

> Shoulda known that was the signal to cancel my open short positions.

See, you even answered your own question.  If you had closed your short then you would have been the evil market manipulator.
Well you can make a lot of money by starting the entire rally and squeeze by market buying a couple thousand bitcoin on several exchanges (or rely on arbitrage). It's quite risky to do so, so I don't think it's some shady whale planning this shit out in his basement/mansion. Some other larger whales can always fuck you right back. 

The pattern was so drawn out that so many traders were just waiting to enter when the pattern broke. The short squeeze is only part of the story. Not everyone trades with leverage and I'm sure many bought spot once they saw the pattern break. I wasn't even looking at my stopped out short on Shitmex, I just market ordered BTC and my favorite alts on Binance.

The overleveraging only makes the move more extreme, it does not start it. 
Welp I looked into it today for obvious reasons, having not known at all previously, and from what I can tell it’s a way to get more bang for your buck as a large investor, since closing short positions forces the price to rise even more than simply filling preexisting sell orders.

I’m like 51% sure I’m wrong tho, so if somebody would correct me that would be awesome.
I think the idea that someone intentionally tried to "squeeze" the shorts, while possible, isn't really necessary for a short squeeze to occur.

This board had a pretty steady discussion for days about how short interest was setting new records every day while the price was chopping around pretty sideways, even creeping up overall.  When you get a higher and higher and higher and higher short interest and price isn't declining, eventually you get a sort of rush to the exit like we saw today.  In a way it's the shorters themselves who create the squeeze by continuing to add to their positions and not close them.  It becomes unsustainable.  This morning it didn't take much extra buying to create the avalanche.  Maybe the buy that was the straw to break the back of the shorts was intended to create that effect, but maybe it was just normal buying for any number of reasons.

Where can one view stats on margin trading?  Is there a resource that aggregates from multiple exchanges?
can I have the link to that longs vs shorts graph please
>(likely an exchange)

You keep saying this but do you have any proof whatsoever that is occurring?

Which of these two scenarios is most likely?-

A. An exchange risks their reputation completely to wreck longs or shorts for a tiny short term gain in fees.

B. A smart whale or group of whales sees that shorting is at unprecedented levels and being done by people that have no idea what they are doing and proceeds to ruthlessly wreck them over and over.  
Thanks for this. Where are you getting those two charts from? That ain't tradingview. Thanks in advance
nice entry.  
Great entry! That's going to work out very well I think 
As a balance to this, I find this guys TA to be rock solid. Totally agnostic to his positions, and trades high probability winners quite a bit. Obviously could be wrong with the upcoming move, but worth watching

I always thought we would be at the May 2014 dead cat bounce by now but I like this a lot better. It means we are gonna get through the bear market a lot faster. Assuming this is actually gonna play out the same way, and isn't just a coincidence.



So if this continues to follow that, we should see a pump to 8700 and then bottom out in late spring/early summer. By December we might be back in bull mode. I can live with that.
nice sample size
You have a chance to sell now and make it right. We promise we won’t be mad at ya. 
Smarties will do.
Bitcoin.
lol! https://www.tradingview.com/x/fQbhKGj0/
Shorting at $8000 or around there is not a crazy idea, especially if you have a tight stop.
I love the reverse psycology that you employ here
If you're out of position entirely, maybe it wouldn't be so bad to put some in. If you're partly in position, just wait for it to try and test a higher low. Bullish or not we know BTC doesn't go straight up. 
Well played.
This case looks less like manipulation and more like a huge amount of idiots with over-leveraged shorts. I have to admit I was skeptical of this scenario when people were talking about it before. Kudos to all that predicted it.
Watch this be the biggest bart in history. *Maximum* pain. 
Yes, that's why I have been writing here that shorting is inherently harder/more demanding since there is the risk of infinite opposite move. Crypto markets usually go up, so you can add to a long at dips, and average down. If you add to a short at a top, you are not sure if that is a reversal or not, so this might add even MORE downside to your position.

A lot of people treat short vs long as an equal bet, but in my opinion it's not at all. Also remember that if you short BTC on bitmex and is upp 200%, your base holdings when you take profit has less value. If you are long and you are up 1%, you are at plus by default
...'looks'?
liquidation?
it means a lot of sell pressure as well at this level. 1hr BB is at 7500.
Price always gets driven into the BB's by the bots.
Adoption increased by 10% in the last hour which explains the rise. Adoption has also decreased by 70% in the past 3 months which explains the drop. 

No manipulation
> outside chance

I don't even go outside bruh!


What's a nannal event ?
What you say is more or less inline with this guy's chart: https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/tBdBQyAf-BITSTAMP-D/
You said it, man.
So Wego from Bart to Marge. 
Rather short covering rally.
I have no long term stack so i must trade, or else i have to bite the bullet and by some now, but its still iffy if this goes down or up.

I'm looking at today as an 'accident' which is helping me stand firm with my lower buy orders. It's been going horizontal for a while now with only a little flex and not something that I want to risk trading. But I sure do have fomo.
Same here, made money last night. Lost more this morning.
Look at all those 10m liquidations, holy moly

its not stopping. Finex already above 8k

Shorts about to feel one hell of a squeeze
Would have been smart.
The trend is now bullish, wouldn’t recommend shorting until that shows signs of changing.
Does he get a rollback or is that just if the futures price goes down? 
Only longs get bailed out though, right?

Depends on the target of the pump. Look what happened with eos lately, hardly any retrace. 
Havent broken the longterm down trend so no, but it could be if we do
I was convinced about that nearly a week ago.

Bears will be bears and will justify any dog shit excuse for reaching a sub 6k bottom. But here we are, 4 small recovery's later with the price never being dropped lower then 6.1-6.2.

The crazy bullrun lasted only but a month while this sell off is currently going for nearly 4 months. Selling pressure has to drop at some point. Just more reason i believe we won't see a sub 6k bottom in a long time.

No. Stops closer to $8100, still holding. 
>/u/mikeXBT closed your short? 

Not yet. Still holding. 
You'll almost certainly be above 0% when https://www.moonmath.win is updated tonight. Probably in the teens. The 7 day will be wildly optimistic.
So good to see you again sir.
We won't know the bear market is over until we're threatening ATHs \(13k\+\) and bitcoin's all over the news once again. Nobody knows at this point, but it's *possible* this was a turning point we'll not see the 6000s again. It's also possible we top out at 8\-10k and bleed back down.
If there's one thing I've learned it is that bear markets always always always go longer than you think. Not saying we won't see 10k, and I do think the end of tax season coinciding with this maybe takes away from my point
I'm hopeful that the bear market is over but I'm pretty bad at predicting the market. I feel that a lot of money got taken out of crypto to pay for taxes. The amount of money some people made last year is insane. The US federal government is taking around a 1/3 of those short term gains. I imagine most of the people that needed to sell by now has sold. So, that is probably taking a lot of sell pressure off. If we get another day or two of $1000+ gains, that's going to cause some serious FOMO and money should flow back in. Then we are off to the races. If we don't get a couple of days of solid gains in a row, I think we'll float back and forth in a range and not breakout.

you will get downvoted because you didn't tell us *why* you think this seems like a longer-term DCB
Bears now are like the bulls in denial at $15K on the way down. 
[removed]
I'm no bear, and want the price to go up. However, be careful as we are far from out of the woods yet !
Be cautious either way tbh. We went from 6800-8k in an hour. It's ok to be a little concerned about a pull back.
I wonder if BTC could see another ATH this year...
You see the [bull flag](https://imgur.com/a/UvE63) on the 30min? Although I do think a pullback to 7.4 is probable. 
dayummmm mike with the moves again
> MM

What does MM mean? Mili Million? As in 100k?
Leverage?
Did you close this when we moved down before or still sitting on it? 

Did you get stopped out at that runup to 7900?
Don’t believe you 
[removed]
i know i hate it :(((
RSI probably won't be relevant again until 17k. In a trending market it can remain pinned for a long time.
meaning around 6k more shorts are now underwater. 
About 26.5k shorts right now, longs about 27.5k
no he closed it around 6922 sadly
No. He closed around 6922
I checked his history and he closed at 6922 : https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8beaek/daily_discussion_wednesday_april_11_2018/dx7v5ll/
He closed a long within the last day.
I think it's a pump and dump (short squeeze), but our baseline will be much higher after this. A victory for the bulls, but don't get euphoric.
Don't beat yourself up over it. Any sensible stop would have got stopped out and you just happened to get stopped out at the top. 

You didn't do anything wrong imo. 
same, I misplayed this rally :(    
"Bitcoin soars to record 8k: cryptocurrency pack leader is now (up 20% in a single day OR back to levels not seen since 2 weeks ago)"

I guess it depends which narrative the media throws out there. Idk how many people that got burned the first time are going to fomo in again. Maybe more than I figure but maybe not many at all. 
...which means do the opposite. 
Sounded to me like he encouraged shorting, made the wrong call, and is now doubling down on that call .
Can anyone tell me why I should be valuing his opinion?

He could well be wrong or right but what gives him weight?

Bullish ;)
Its completing the inverse bart started on March 29.
Keep us posted. And: Pics or it didnt happen.
You said that you've only started trading this week and that you're working with baby amounts of 0.3-1 BTC. It depends on how much BTC you have of course, but 0.3-1BTC are definitely not baby amounts to play with for a noob (and non-noob). Especially on leverage. I would advise starting off with much much smaller amounts until you're confident that the profits you are making have something to do with your strategy rather than just sheer luck.
How'd you open two longs at$6800 and close them both at $7800-7900?
Hell yea brotha! Welcome to the best market ever. Looks like you will do well. Looking forward to hearing more from you :)
Congratulations. The wins make the losses a little less painful.
Ok.  I'm only lvl 1 so this lvl 3 guy must know what he is talking about.

You heard him boys.  Buy with all you got.
Q2 Bullish Reversal is definitely on the table.
[removed]
The alts I watch went up in tandem with btc.   Also, this is not a reversal.  Wake me up at 12k, when btc is at 2/3 the price of ATH.
> Me and the rest of the bears who predicted it would go down were wrong.

No you may have been right unless you said it was 100% likely to go down by today.   The 1w chart still shows downtrend and I would say greater than 60% likely will be below $7000 again in the next few weeks (if not days or hours).
>Also the alts are once again tanking in btc ratio. this might mean that we'll see another alt coin boom when this trend hits its peak so be looking for that.



eh they are not, a lot is up 10-15-20% on Binance today. When ALL is red or below 5%, then the BTC reversal starts for real
Hey, that’s my joke
Head and shoulder on the 30 is painted beautifully. what is your target 
Interesting that you cut off wicks (with wicks on there was no higher high). Is this something you do normally for divergence patterns? Thanks
Coming from you, I really enjoyed reading this.

Fucking hilarious, and it's interesting to see what would finally make you make a full-on anti-bear comment, and you really had a way with words here.
Are you in a short ? If so, what is your entry ?
Rip
Did you disturb an ancient grave or something? Condolences.
sounds weird but sell your body to hungry grandmas with a big pocket :) you wont regret it long term
Oof!  Why do you keep selling at the bottom?
Do you guys not realize he's joking? There's no possible way someone bought the very top, sold the very bottom, bought the top of the rebound and again sold at the bottom. Not sure why someone would joke about this though.
you bought into fomo, you sold into fud, and then you bought into a secondary peak of the fomo. If you're not an experienced trader or analyst, you should just wait for a bear market, buy, then hold. If you don't want to get into TA, it helps tremendously just to look at historical price patterns to help you decide where to buy in or sell for profit. You're not going to get the best prices to buy and sell but you'll be in sync with the major gains and dips.
Now think it in this way. You paid money for a lesson. So try to learn from this lesson and remember it in the future. Brighter times are ahead
That was a painful read. I hope that you have learned from your mistakes and can separate emotion when trading in the future. 
Personally it took me a good 6 months and a bit of a loss for me to become remotely confident in trading.
Best of luck to you though, I hope you have a better success rate in the future. 
zahra must be disappointed.
do not buy back! or else my long will be done for. :(
Congrats on the excellent timing.
Seeing possible bounce back off 66xx

Lol..I read your post I was like "Yeah he has a point" and then it immediately started dumping. Good call!
Ya beat me to it ;)
BTC died... It's all dust at this point.  I will clean it for you to though
I broke a nail.

I will buy nailcoin
Soros just bought in. Load ze India FUD.
Some more sideway action, come back after 4 months.
Many people say that in fact we are not in a bear market but a 4 month dip and once we break the resistance we'll resume the bull run.
if we break the resistance, we'll be set up for a nice rally.  it will not signify the end of the bear market, but more likely than not, that line will hold as the previous resistance will be the new support. add in the snowball effect, and it could be a reversal. of course the opposite may occur, but as I said, there are more chances that it will trigger a reversal than not.
nice call.
https://twitter.com/BTCVIX/status/984326550899306496
My guess is that a lot of new shorts are not stupid people thinking its going to be easy money but rather hedges that are only likely to close on the break of the downtrend line. I would not put it past BTC to break that line and then make a new low further in the year but at the moment there just seems to be a lack of buyers to sustain any movement up. So even though the shorts rising is a little unsettling for me I'm thinking they are likely a few bigger players hedging as opposed to shorting so it's going to be hard to convince a lot of those shorts to close. The charts just don't look bullish at all to me ATM. We seem to be fighting to not break the 50D SMA then we're looking at weekly charts for lower short targets (as well as previous ATHs). 

Let's be fair the real bubble started after hitting 3K after the 5K top and even though there was massive sell walls pushing BTC down we didn't even get to 5K and bounced at 5.4 and never went below the 50D SMA after that. Assuming that if we go up too high we'll come down harder than we should and we can say somewhere between 3-5K is the true value for BTC atm(because even before that final stage of the bubble we were growing at an insane rate) then the absolute bottom of the 2013 ATH seems plausible. It won't stay there long and I think we may range between 3-5K for a while after bottoming out on one giant weekly candle that gets retraced epically.

The tech seems to be really ramping up now so fundamentals seem to be really good if we manage to do achieve anon payments that would absorb a lot of XMRs market share(or all the other 'privacy coins' XMR actually has a really good community and is one of the only other cryptos I actually like) let's see what the the devs are going to do with RSK's smart contracts, I don't think they will amount to a huge deal but it could probably do enough to be interesting although I haven't a clue how you can get a decentralized oracle but it will probably be much more effective and more secure than ETH ever will be.

Now do it with December. And account for market tendency to go up.
Or just type 1/BTCUSD in TV instead of unnecessary neck exercises
On the inverse, I see a huge bounce that is getting a rounded top and looks to head back down and resume the larger pattern soon. 
You could be right, but flipping a chart is pointless as hell. You cant flip human psychology.
Yep.  The market isn't done moving yet.  I'm 99% sure this lull is a trap.
Yeah, I'm setting stops at breakeven and going to sleep. This guy is painting too slowly. 
7-7.2k on high volume would make a shitton of shorts panic
No number if they are fully hedged.
Three fiddy.

If I had info on that I would not be sharing it. 

I imagine 7.8 would be good enough
*cue
This is the sickest pump we’ve seen since Dec 6-7
If there's a good time to short, I'd say now - the retracement is ongoing, maybe to 50% fib ~ 7400, or Eiffel tower.
I highly doubt it going to be calm today
hello from the moon
In Kraken someone managed to sell today @8500 when Bitfinex hit 8100, so sometimes its good to have sell/buy orders 1000 - 2000$ from current price.
If you're going to have the counterparty risk of having funds on an exchange, they should always be completely used up in limit orders. Lowball "in case of meltdown" if nothing else. Worst case nothing happens and you cancel it for "real" orders later. Best case there's a flash crash and you get instant profit. 

You should have kept your 6666 order. 
I think closing above $7650 (ideally $7700) will be a good start and then look for more follow through this week and weekend. Closing much below $7.6K will be disappointing.
I think you need an organic rise in this price range without a short squeeze. If this happens at 7.2, 7.6, or 7.8, it doesn't matter. 
Never too soon. Doesn't mean it's right. I hope it's right...
I honestly can't believe btc will be 100k, simply because of all the normal people who become millionaires when it happens, even my uber driver was in crypto right now... I do freaking hope so though.
I don’t feel like fresh money is pumping this. Without a manipulation tactic at least. I’m skeptic unless this sustains for a long amount of time. 
This bear market and the questionable moves the last few weeks have made me overthink every decision. I did fine all of last year just going through news and subreddits and doing my DD without even a twitter account or tradingview account. Now I meticulously pour through charts and read "crypto expert" tweets and the conclusion I get is some people are better guessing than others. Gonna go back to what worked with me which is browse this sub and otherwise go with my gut.
It sounds reasonable, but overly detailed.   If the price quickly spikes hard or drops fast, you will likely not keep to what you wrote above.   But I suppose it's good to have some sort of plan even if you end up changing it.
Ouch. How about now?
Remind me - how long was the funding rate at 0.375% during the bull run? What was the premium on the futures?

Funding rate is high, I agree, but it is *not* a good indicator to simply enter a long position. Even though in this case I agree partially, perhaps with layered buys.
You couldnt have been more wrong, it seems.
can I do this risk free with coins that I am already holding? eg just providing funding. 
My feelings are changed today and I think the later is likely to happen. 
It's not the move in $$$$ it's the buying needed to offset selling. Which at this moment seems to be in exact equilibrium. With a lot of people looking for entries at 6.5 or lower, and lot of people looking for exits at 7 or high it's very hard to move the market right now. 
But it's just a made up line that fits a model that gets broken at some point because - maths.
....RIP.
real talk. I woke up and watched BTC pump almost $1000 in 30 min after months of nothing.
don't believe anything you read in the Express, its literally just made up.

They predicted the end of the world something like 50 times in 2017
lulz if you bought sub-1k and you wanted to realize profit but had waited until now, it must feel good to have cash in hand.
I'm convinced the runup was inorganic and there is no real buying support at this level
I thought about it, but the RSI (while not the best indicator) is like 74 on the one hour and 68 on the 6 hour. Also, I'm not really seeing any sustained buy pressure, just one short liquidation candle.
Yes, it will be hard to dump back down immediatelt after 34k got bought in a flash, but it all comes down to the whether we can sustain this proce level for a few days/weeks without dumping significantly.

This bull flag could play out, but lately bull flags haven’t been the kindest formations

I'm bullish but can't get cocky yet Dr Dixie Pic. 
We haven't even had a full day yet of raging bulls, so I'd wait it out a bit. That said, when everyone starts treating things as a sure bet, it's probably time to re-evaluate, regardless of what direction things have been going in.
You don't trade Bitcoin; Bitcoin trades you.
I guess you might say that the general trend tends to be more apparent than it has been during this recent chop/high amplitude noise. With that said, it is always hard to identify when the trend has changed. That’s been my experience, anyways.
I'm by no means a long term trader, but I think it depends on your style as a trader. 

Some traders like more volatility due to the huge moves. Other traders like a more predictable low-volume market. 
It's definitely easier when the only way is up
>  i only got into trading bitcoin around 2 months ago, so i dont really know any better conditions apart from the low-volume

Dude, the last 2 months have had some of the highest aggregate trading volume in Bitcoin's history.

Dec & Jan were low volume. Feb & March, not even close. Unless you're looking only at GDAX and nowhere else.

> I've really been waiting for the volume to come back i think it will take away a lot of the unpredictableness of bitcoins movement

Nah fam, Bitcoin gonna Bitcoin.
Yeah, but I don't think many sidelines traders are really going to jump in with such high RSIs and overbought indicators. It would have been better if the candle took 6 hours rather than 1.
Because you have to go by your method. For me, if we are near the top of the 1 hr high BBs, and the RSI is in the 70s, then I'm shorting. Sure, maybe I get screwed here and we moon up to 8.45 and I get liquidated. However, it doesn't seem the market is fundamentally ready to go on another 5-10% rise right now.
I think bears are expecting a retracement to ~7,400. Certainly wouldn't surprise me.
>  If you didn't get a short in above 7.9 there's no point going in now. 

The point would be if you think the price is likely to drop here.  I am net long, but just saying.
>$1300

Sorry but what asset are you looking at? 
Anecdotal, but had two friends today text about either buying back in or having lunch to talk about buying back in. Not whales, white collar six figure earners though willing to allocate 1-5% of portfolio. I imagine that I am not alone. 
Eventually the comparisons to 2014 will become obviously invalidated. It will work until it doesn't, and it will probably stop working at the worst possible time in the worst possible way.
we might not be, but this analogy has like nothing to do with 2018 and basing any kind of opinion on that alone is simply naive. 
If I had a bitcoin for every time I read someone saying this is a repeat of 2013/2014 there wouldn't be any btc left for the rest of you.
That's been said a couple of times today and it's a fair point, but on the other hand, 2014 still isn't 2018.
The 2018 market is completely different from 2014.  How can they even be compared?
This time is different™

Fuck me you're not wrong, ratio only got shorter!

Must say if a big market maker is working to generate some of these moves, then they've done really well to manage those counter-parties the last 2 weeks. Just feels like market people though.
While old shorts were squeezed, lots of new shorts must have opened on the pump.
Im sure many scalp shorts have opened, give it some time to settle. What the ratio is at tonight should be whats important.
Haha!
looking good :)
7610 now, your prayers have been answered
8400? I'd give 7400 before 8400 pretty high odds. 
Another 10% without the short squeezing would be ridiculous at this point IMO
> before we retrace

We already retraced $8,087 to $7.6k, which is pretty significant if you ask me.
Bigger bullflag needs bigger cool down 
I find RSI next to useless for bitcoin. We can stay over/under bought for a very long time.
CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!
I was doing it when they were at 29... 

Truly impressive anyway but I was getting on my nerves waiting for a bull signal like yesterday with the ALTs
YOU'RE THE BESTEST
You forget to mention how in your previous 2 comments (the only ones you have made over the past week) that you also gave a bearish outlook, alongside giving a bullish outlook...covering all bases, then picking parts of your comments to fit the current narrative?

Certainly looks like it.
>  as we're far from breaking bear trend.

The one that will be broken if we go above 8800?
The corn
It was just FOMO when people saw it moving up.
It was a huge short squeeze. I think one group of whales know this is going down without some big news/change, and they absolutely will use shorts as ammo to slow the drop and buy time until ETF or other fundamental news change. Another group of shorting whales wants to catch these sweet bounces on the way down. 


Only if it holds.
just did on BFX
Boom.
masterluc himself has already ditched that chart, hasn't he?
Interesting definition of 'on target' you've got there.

I've posted this before myself, when it was you know, not significantly below the current bubble. When would you consider this no longer on target?
This too https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/HIIQLGOd-Try-again/
[deleted]
You are not seeing what I'm seeing, how could you say that is still on target lol?  It has missed the targets completely.  I loved that chart but it is no longer valid.
Except for the part that we went all the way down to around 6.4k, and the chart didn’t go much below 10k.  And we are still not at 10k, and I would be surprised if we hit 10k this year 
I will be pleasantly surprised if we go above $10k any time soon......
a lot of people who just started margin trading in the past month just got their education
Shorting again or doing the unthinkable and going long? :)
I'm rooting for you wildman!
few more bucks ull be in again probably
It doesn't seem very "concrete" to me.  If it holds for the next few months, then maybe can talk about that.
It's rather unpredictable tbh. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Confidence can take a long time to build but can be explosive once established, and can be destroyed  very quickly. Alts are in so much green I could see the general sentiment turning quickly, a la "wtf did we think, crypto was dead? Silly us"
It looks concrete now it might turn into vapor faster than you can blink. And no, I don't think price stability regardless of the dogma of making bitcoin more useful as a currency is very good for bitcoin, since one of its bigger use cases and the one that attracts more new users is speculation.
> price stability between 6600 and 7k ideal for the future

That's not how any of this works.

Wrong supply curve. For there to be "stability" for a "currency" at these prices, there would have to be some kind of algo managing supply in a way to provide this stability. 21m coins with "halvings" and difficulty adjustment isn't that algo (not until 1BTC = 1BTC and USD is measured in wheelbarrows).
Stop limit orders are a pretty risky proposition. Say your stop is 6700; setting the limit at 6700.01 risks the order never filling. If it dumps through 6700 fast you could be stuck with an unfilled limit sell and market price at 6650. Same risk at 6699.99. Only time 6699.99 would get filled is if 6700.00 gets sold into but not past 6699.99 immediately and then it would just act as a normal market sell.
No market decides. Anyone can offer funding, BFX offer none (officially)   
If we run out of BTC funding they can't short    
atm it gets replenished with 3k btc whenever it runs out
Initial margin, risk limits and the total value of the buy side of the book + market buys limit the number of BTC used for shorting. The market buys are and buy side of the book are latent

What's your target ?

I'm seeing 33k BTC market buys in the last 2.5 hours of which 11k were shorts closing. Absolutely mental. Never seen shorts getting rekt this hard.
Yes... nothing special.

Beautiful bullflag on the 5 minute. 

What entry point are u waiting for? 
No. Feel free to short.
We've seen this before. After a pump, buy pressure and volume starts dropping off. In my opinion there HAS to be a dip which will cause an increase in volume and only then do I think there is a possibility of another pump. 
bitcoin.tax works for me
bitcoin.tax

he did my crypto exceptionally well. 
I used cointracking and bitcoin.tax and got similar numbers. It was pretty simple. I took the results to my accountant who handled the rest. She has no prior experience with crypto and it wasn't a problem for her.

If not go to bitcoin.tax and on the top, you can search for accountants by state. I spoke to one in my state and he wanted a $3K retainer and was quite unprofessional so I said no thanks. (no office, wanted to do everything via Skype) I spoke to him long enough to know that he uses bitcoin.tax. Generally I don't trust an accountant who needs a retainer upfront.
It will touch 7500 then go up
[deleted]
Move further to the right, around October just before it hits another v shaped low. Another very similar spike.
The pop is more like early march, a pump with an attempt to double bottom. And btw, MtGox collapse didn't start until Feb when we were at 900.
Interesting. This could be that last pump to 10k before the hammer really drops just like we had thag one last unholy pump in 2014. 
It could be a fake out but I wouldn't use 2014 as the basis for reasoning. Crypto was a completely different animal in 2014.
Too early to short, even it's a fake out it may go up to 10k. I would short @ $9300-10000. 
If we can close in the upper part of today's range and then consolidate for a while, I believe the next move will more likely be UP.  

If we pullback and make a higher low, that wouldn't be bad either.
That's what they want you to think- it's a double-dip Bogdanov inverted fakeout
Could be. Let's watch if 7k-7.5k hold through the week first.
Could be. I have a stop set for 7400 just in case.
It's certainly possible.  I remember 2014 very well.  And anyone can look at the chart and see what happened.
Last time it was this price it was the 5 of april. 

There are a fuckton of shorts still underwater. Around 5000 if it doesnt fail me.


is it a fake out? Probably

but just because the movement is fake, doesn't mean it'll go down after a  single spike. The people running the show most likely have enough powder to last at least a week. This first spike is designed to look fake so everyone takes advantage of it and sells/shorts.

Then the whales will make another spike and another to destroy the shorters before switching to selling. 

Which is why its important to have a trading stack and a holding stack. That way if you call it wrong and sell early or short and get rekt, you'll still have some skin in the game.






Possibly one last dump over the weekend to around 6k leading up to tax day in the US?  Then I have no idea but I'm praying that will be the bottom.
Even though I shorted, I agree with this, I have my stop at break even, don't care if I don't make money if it protects me from losing alot in case this is fake move down to scare some longs and bullshit them into going short, then a big move to the upside and whoop you're double fucked
Wouldn't be the first time this bear market alt coins make large moves then come crashing down even harder when bitcoin breaks.

I'm leaning slightly bullish, but the daily stoch RSI being overbought and the still large resistance we're wrestling with has me still waiting for 7.2k or so. Not a fan of the risk reward.
I'm not sure mom and pop have been paying attention for a while. Hearing it's "up to 7700!" probably won't instill a lot of confidence. 
'As you can clearly see, we're starting another bull cycle with a target of xxxx' - Is all the media needs to do.

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BITFINEX:BTCUSDSHORTS

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BITFINEX:BTCUSDLONGS
20,000. 16,500 shorts have closed since this morning. 

That's almost 17k on the order books, buying and propping up the price. Kind of wild 
This is a refreshing change of pace...
Your stop's too high.
margin long June futures at 7687 here, if this  bull flag does not do a Bart but breaks upwards , another short squeeze down to 25k open or something could provide more fuel. But having tight stops here
Not doing anything till asia wakes up in 5 hours.....I expect a drop.....
It's not really anecdotal since it happened. Sometimes the implication isn't anything suspicious. A *lot* of shorts have continued closing so an ask like that is probably a good close.
Or it's a wash sale and the person bought it from themselves...or from one of their cohorts, etc.
So now we start going up and break through the trend line. 
He closed it before this giant rise.
I thought he said the M didn't stand for million, but something else.
There's not one obvious result of this. Bitcoin s get moved around for a lot of reasons.
On 04-03 it dumped like 12 hours after the transfer.

On 03-24 it was dumping during the transfer.

On 03-19 it didn't dump at all around the transfer.

On 03-06 it only dumped 2% around the transfer.

On 02-06 it actually pumped insanely; this was just after the 6k crash.

Not seeing a correlation. I think you're just looking for one and getting some confirmation bias.
Pretty sure that’s winklevoss wallet.  They moved 7k a couple months back with 2 transactions of 3 and 4k.  And I think you can see those moves on this wallet.

I would guess this is something to do with their exchange but who knows.  
Can someone explains what to expect from such event, pls
This is normal behavior. Bittrex's hotwallet was probably emptied by arbitrage bots during the pump, so they had to refill. The move is a consequence of the pump, it's not a predecessor of a future action.
How is bittrex moving coins from their own cold storage to their hot wallet bearish?

They've just opened registrations after 3 months. ofcourse activity is going to be up ofcourse they're going to need more BTC.

https://www.walletexplorer.com/address/1N52wHoVR79PMDishab2XmRHsbekCdGquK

How does it 'always ends with dump' when bittrex moved coins out of cold storage? this is stupid. They move coins in and out depending on their own volume at the time.
Does this mean its being sold or bought? What is the significance?
you do know that bittrex has a block trading service, right?

There was some mod-hacking today, the tracker was f-ed up, they probably removed it for now.
Like stated below, we had an incident that caused some problems to the ticker. We are working on restoring it soon
Works on App...
Oh yeah, break even with fees included my friend
I take fees and slippage into account. If I'm in profit I set my stop market at about 0.25% away from my entry to get out at breakeven. Sometimes I still lose out a little but not usually.
I set limit buys last night, only one hit, next one LITERALLY was a dollar off the bottom of the dip. Once it started pumping I market buy fomoed in @ $7050, and set limit sell orders on the way up. 7100, 7200, 7300, they all hit... wishing I had just held though lolol this is insanity.
we had so many fake outbreaks here. scalping here to build a buffer might be a good idea, but maybe its already to late, as a move could happen with the 30m bbands, which are tighenting right now. 
I'm long right now. Its a small long at $7300. I plan to exit it at $11k. Whenever that might happen. If the price goes up, I'll reduce it, locking in profit. If the price goes down, I'll cautiously add to it. I feel confident about that small long.

So... Yeah. That's my input. 
I'm trading on all three. Personally, I like trading in the September futures the most, right now. I'm a small fish, so I don't really mind liquidity. 99% of the time, I'm sitting on limit orders that buy low and sell high (at least, that's The Plan, doesn't always work out). 
Yes, open one order for stop loss and another to take profits, the problem is that one does not cancel the other so you might get stopped only for it to reverse and you end executing the profit one against the Flow 
Some kind of trailing stop I think
You're looking for trailing stops.
[removed]
You called a double bottom at 6k like every other bull in existence. Amazing. Really stuck your neck out with that one. 
I think most are waiting for a retrace after such a violent pump. I know I am. I just hope this isn't a mega-Bart.


Seems like a lot of the current buying pressure is from shorts scaling out with their tails between their legs.  They continue to drop while our price remains stagnant. Granted I'm not sure why many other buyers wouldn't wait for a retrace after going up over 12% in the time it takes to make breakfast
Do you really expect it to pump more a couple hours after such a run? The buying volume right now is not important, there's not going to be much because RSI levels are high and we already had a breakout. It's the sell volume that's imporant, so far it's contained, low and still dropping which is a good sign. Now if it keeps bleeding all the way back down that would be a bad sign. 
buying pressure raised us 1k on the day.
Lol most shorts are already underwater now especially with all the leverage. Many more will be margin called causing another squeeze.
This morning spot dumped from 6900+ to 6750 in a flash. Some whale got a hold of 34M in Okex quarterlies at 6804, which stopped the dump in its tracks and caused a V-shaped bottom

It rose somewhat steadily, and out of nowhere 34k BTC got bought, primarily market buys in 60minutes.

The rest is history
You're all about the news when 99% of the time news does nothing, market forces are at work not news but the masses are conditioned to think stock market moves and other markets move because the news.   Even though that same news doesn't cause a dent when the market is moving in the direction it's supposed to. 
I think /u/arsonbunny's is a pretty realistic and pragmatic summary. Linked [here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8bnetl/daily_discussion_thursday_april_12_2018/dx8w7dm/).

Combined with buy support preventing a lower low and a push against the pretty low contact point of the downtrend resistance from the double top it makes a lot of sense.
After days of tightening action, shorts at an ATH and a rejection of the dump from $6928, I guess big player(s) decided to bet the other way and set off a cascading short squeeze.

TBH I'm not sure they have any idea which way the market will go. This squeeze is a way to see if there's any bullish follow up over the next few days. If there is, great. If not, expect sentiment to return to bearish and $6K to get smashed.
Was there any news causing the movement from 20k? 

This is a speculative asset man. 
Just bouncing in the triangle.
Look at the chart.
This guy is 100% correct. Speculative trading, aka gambling, is all these coins are used for right now 
It's also lower threshold than the stock market which is highly regarded dispite operating as a casino. An exchange might get seized, but not for operating as a casino.
Wow amazing story. Sorry about your loss.

F .
LOL. It is kind of true. Remember that we are bullish again here due to that short squeeze, and will be mooning any time, so people will downvote posts like this. I don't think Bitfinex will be seized, but it may collapse after the CFTC starts arresting whales that are breaking the law, and fine them. I'm not sure how any of this will continue once the CFTC starts enforcing the CEA.
ok cool
Its highly unlikely exchanges are trading directly on the platform. At most they collude with whales, allowing them to put large buy/sell market orders that wipe out order books before anyone else can react (effectively front running all other market participants). Order spoofing is also highly ilegal, but in our unregulated markets, is considered fair game for some reason.

Exchanges thrive on volatility, they have no need to mess with order books as long as those sweet 0 risk fees keep coming in 0.1% at a time. They do have an incentive though, to let bad market agents corner the market and wipe everyone out over and over again.
How do you feel about the markets for futures, options, options on futures, and stocks in US markets? I trade all of them and as I see it they really aren't much different excepting the regulations. And in the thinly traded options/securities there's still a ton of manipulation in spite of the regulations.

7.1
Depends on your tolerance level, but if I were you, I would start looking at the triangles and resistance points and stop it a little bit above 6.6k maybe? We are in uncertainty for now. And if we make a lower low you can always get back into it at 6.4k. 50% stack is risky af, especially 5x. Congrats on the trade tho nice profits if you get to 6.6k even so
Might want to get off now.
5.4 short target then look for around 5K target for a long to test that ATH trendline is my play. Depends on what timeframes your playing I find daily/12hr/6hr plays to be much less stressful and actually more profitable because your ignoring the noise and less likely to make bad trades/overtrade. We may bounce at 6K but I dont think it's going to hold if we continue back down to there.
What?
"Ok, buy the coins now please."

"But RSI is over 70 right now, boss?"

"Buy the fuckin coins!"
I don't think that kind of indicator matters at this moment.

Masses have reawokened.  As the price stays at this level, people will begin to hit their thresholds of "its been here long enough its safe, lets go up", or "it's been here too long, time to go down", and we'll have another snowball effect, with some other threshold stopping the move.  But I think the timing of the next move is more psychological than RSI and MACD and EMA, etc.

I think the analysis to do at these times is just to be aware of the major resistance/support levels, and sentiment.  Pick your ranges, balance your R/R and pick a side with a plan B.
Take this with a grain of salt since I'm quite underwater on a short right now, but I wouldn't recommend trading like this. Stop limit buys are an *excellent* way to end up a bagholder. If you think the odds of getting to 7480 are just as good as getting to 7800, then you should just short here. Set your stop to flip you long at 7820 if you really want to try to catch a pump. 
And you were wrong again, as usual. "< 6k before > 7.5k"

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8a6k3w/daily_discussion_friday_april_06_2018/dwwoih7/
MikeXBT too, imagine if his long was still open damn
Fat fingered while setting a stop for my deeply underwater shorts, set the stop order as a sell rather than buys, so now I've accedently doubled my short position, in an awful place to short more
If it happens to play out a short between 7900-8000 could be a great profit opportunity 
If it's the bit I think you're refering to...since the pump earlier, then no, the shoulder can't be higher than the head
... but there's no neckline
Except people really don't give a shit about that, they never did. When we reached 6.2 a few weeks back it was insanely oversold yet we never recovered (untill right now?)
Shorted on bitmex and got rekt ;D
It sounds like you just explained as much of the correlation as any of us could know.
I'm not convinced there is a correlation, *at all*. 

Before saying so, I'd recommend collecting data and looking at the correlation coefficient between the two data sets. I bet you find nothing statistically significant, but that's just my hunch.
It not very correlated with the stock market, the historical correlation coefficient is around rho = 0.1—0.3. Statistically significant, but not a particularly strong positive correlation.

This was a short squeeze, the equity market shot up because of thoughts of Syria de-escalation. Two unrelated things. 
Contrary to Bitcoin enthusiasts who claimed that Bitcoin would go up as investors take refuge in Bitcoin like they might gold (which has inherent value) during stock market downturns, Bitcoin has sunk each time the stock market does. This removed one of the last remaining arguments for Bitcoin.
The correlation is extremely weak-

I believe this was set up to make easy money because of the many shorts. Easy money if you have enough money to buy the price all the way up to 8k. Stop losses trigger all the way up ...you accumulate easy sales to 8k and dump for massive profit.
I'm shorting but I don't really know what to make of the 2000+BTC buy walls between 7500-7550. Seems like it might be an obstacle to say the least.
Will be sub 7K tomorrow for sure, i don't understand why you get down-votes.

What you wanna see is another impulsive move over the coming days to take us into the high 8's / low 9's. One hourly candle while fantastic is hardly enough to change sentiment, consistent and violent movement upwards though? that'll do it.
This must hurt you the most.
the way I interpret the chart is that we already experienced the circled portion of the 14/15 chart in mid feb. The 2013 q4 bullrun also started earlier than the 2017 q4 bull run so keep that in mind. Also, this chart is extremely misleading. Look at the time scale at the bottom. They both show about 20 months in range but the 17/18 chart was shrunken into 14 months with 2 of those months being part of the consolidation period on the left side. If you stretched out this 12 month worth of data to 20 months like the left side, you'll see a similar pattern that matches up almost completely.

Looking for links, man. Nobody can verify your joy.
I agree with you, however, we would think this 100% of the time this price action happened while maybe 5-10% of those times it would in fact be sustainable and we'd be wrong. 
This is what you are talking about?

Why not? It's just a bull flag on the big timeframe.
Are you still keeping your 7.7k short? I have a slightly underwater 7.5k short and I wonder if I should close it now at a small loss.
Kraken hit 7400
seems a bit premature. Why not wait to see where this goes. this might just make headlines all over the world by morning. We just shot up more than 10% in a minute or two... That means a lot of money just woke up

Oops
Crossed 7.8k now!!
How far do you think it will retrace? I'm just on GDAX so my longs and shorts are only in or out of position, I sold at 7646, wondering when to buy back in...
If they can do that, they are not paying taxes. Specially considering that a lot of countries like mine don't tax crypto. Mostly because the adoption is irrelevant there.

...he said nervously 
Bears starting to get a little nervous 
I'm a bear but I'm also excited about this. A 15% bump after a higher low: charts haven't been this interesting for weeks.
I would seriously be excited if that pump occurred over 6 hours-1 day. However, I have seen literally no evidence at all that anything but a big short liquidation occurred right now. 
[removed]
Who gives a shit?
all i know is that Tim Draper is invested into Vechain
Probably not.  That would be too far too fast.
We've got a little breathing room now that we've broken out of the descending channel we've been in the past week. 

Likely that we no re-test the descending log resistance by sometime next week. 
This is the market. They are a big part of it hence the term whales. 
bulls: Please stop claiming a victory

bears: Please stop looking for a conspiracy 

traders: Is this a bullflag?
of what?
"They" would need to distribute their holdings first and start accumulating shorts, so yes, if you see a big trading range form at 8.4, and there are a lot of leveraged longs, this move can certainly happen in the opposite direction. "They" will not go against the overall market sentiment though. So I guess we'll have to wait and see how that pans out.
You're missing the point. At some point, accumulators reach their target position size. They don't just want to accumulate forever. These are real people with plans they're trying to execute, not some hypothetical fantasy trader with infinite money. Have to think about things like bankroll size, risk reward, etc.
>We should celebrate bitcoins successful adoption over this last hour.

I just laughed out laud at a coffee shop. That looked weird.
Manipulation or not, it's definitely impressive as it's highest hourly volume yet.
ORGANIC
That's not adoption...that's speculative trading 
Yeah would be really interesting to see how much of this was new money and how much were just longs opening and shorts closing.
On bitfinex shorts peaked at 40.5k btc just before the pop. Sitting right above 25k right now and slowly dropping.

Longs closed as well, was at 33k just before the pop and dropped down to 27k and slowly rising.
I mean, we certainly *could*, but I'm not going to count on it. 
[removed]
Not something I'm particularly interested in doing. 
Started at $6,940. 

Closed at $7,880.

Reopened at $7,700.

Closed at $7,970. 

So not half bad. 
Yes
obvious, huh :D Salam brov
Well there's the Spring weather to enjoy during dull moments, but today is definitely not dull 8-)
where you guys putting stops at? 7400-7500 looks to be the support
7800 is quite tough for now, could take time (or not... nothing suprises me anymore)
All the time. 43% of the time to be exact.
i think from his own data it's 47% of the time, but when he's correct it's always fucking dildo movement
what happened to my favorite bear :(
don't
June Futures, and my alarms are set below $7,500. 
Well, I longed from $6900 or so last night, and closed at $7880 this morning.

This is effectively a "it's probably not going to break up here, but if it does I certainly don't want to miss the boat."


The salt this morning is insane here. I personally lean bullish but Jesus the muh manipulation posts are just so fucking stupid. It’s annoying when both sides do it but for the last few weeks since this sub turned into a bearish circle jerk, if it goes up 100 dollars it’s just shorts closing and a whale playing. Hoping mods start making people show proof for muh manipulation posts. Never seen a collective group of people bitch so much about something that is voluntary. 

As if their children and families are taken hostage and they have to be in this market. Their 401ks are depending on it I guess or maybe shorting isn’t as easy as they thought. They think in a bear market we are just supposed to free fall forever and any sort of upwards movement is fake. K. 
Yeah, I don't get how anyone sees this as good in any way.. it's a glorified gambling token. I have 0 interest in using this as a store of value or a currency if this kind of stuff continues
Unpredictable in the short term.

Long term, everything gold does, bitcoin does better. And so far, hardly anyone in the world knows what bitcoin is (even if they've heard of it). So long term, bitcoin predicatably goes up. Been happening for 9 years and isn't about to stop.
I really hate it when the gold analogy is used. 
so deep
Just because we climbed this far doesn't guarantee we'll retest the log resistance line. That would actually be pretty significant. Obviously a short entry around 8800 would be the ultimate r/r play, but you may also never get your entry. 8K could have been the top of this bounce on the way back to <6500. We can't know, obviously, and it certainly doesn't feel like it right now. Layering in the mid $8ks is lower risk/higher reward, but a much lower shot of getting your entry. 
Indeed. I wouldn't be the least bit surprised to see it break down, though, position bias aside. It does seem to be BTC's MO for the past few weeks. A break up would be a hell of a thing, though.
I'm not sure I would put a lot of stock in that one. It's been crossed multiple times in either direction, but it does have a number of contact points. I think it's just more indicative of a zone. 
Yes, shorting 8100 would be brilliant if we get there. I'm questioning whether the rejection off that zone has already occurred. Layering in is protection against missing the perfect entry in exchange for a good entry. 

You're right though that it is rising quickly. Re-evaluation hourly makes sense. 
I agree with this. Personally looking to short 8-8.2 with stops above 8.4 but in all honesty I'm surprised we broke past 7.7 and so violently. 
I'll get right on that, sport.
what he say (for the rest of us) who don't have time to admire *that* haircut...
Max leverage on finex is 3.3x so most of those shorts just closed by buying coins, not liquidated. The conspiracy theories about Finex are pretty ridiculous in here...
> special person

Its the biggest exchange. So I guess they are all special so.
thanks man
Well, like I said in my post, the entry was a bit premature. 

So the lack of interest in my position shouldn't be that surprising.

The funny part is how irritated you get lol. You spent time to read that only to fuel your hatred for the day. LOL life of a perma bull/bear
Price goes down: "it's bitfinex bots!!!" with loads of upvotes.

Price goes up: "it's the bots!!" downvotes...
Seems like I have an angel on my shoulder
I know and agree, but that's why I'd be heavily considering selling if we start falling back to secure some profits. If we go retest that line we broke from (I have it drawn too) I'd rather reenter down there if that line holds as support.

Edit: Looking briefly at 2017 and some of 2016, I'm not seeing many times on the log scale where we had a break out of this size that didn't take quite awhile (if it even does) to go back and retest the breakout.
Not even going to pretend to have a clue. If we fail at the ATH resistance again my dumb ass would expect a lower low at some point and *probably* no ATH in 2018. If we break through it I, like many, would think we're mostly out of the woods but idk how fast we'd get back to ATH.
[deleted]
So many people were liquidated at once that they couldn't all actually buy the coins they needed back. Bitmex maintains an insurance fund that covers the difference to prevent the exchange from completely falling apart. They charge those in winning positions to cover the catastrophic risks for those in the losing positions. In this case 600 btc were needed which basically tells you a *lot* of shorts were liquidated very quickly. 
hahaha +1 for an honest answer
Same here. 
it's more of a rhetorical question ;)
in general I am bad at profit taking, but above 8k would maybe be a good spot
Looks like you made the right move :)  
I really like squares, I am abandoning horizontal lines for squares.  Squares just make so much more sense.  Almost everything I want to draw on my chart represents a range:  Purple volume profile node, grey weekly 'levels' (areas where weekly highs, lows, open, close are in close proximity), yellow dynamic levels, blue 62% fib retraces (It is rarely perfect 62%, it is actually 62%-65% and best to draw it like that).

Teal bullish break out.  Orange bearish break out.  Red sell.  Green buy.

Color coding helps with my trading psychology a lot.

It reminds me a little of the asian girls from college with their highlighter sets  (◕‿◕✿)   Pages upon pages with no text left unhighlighted.  Array of colors with unknown meaning.  A secret code only the Kawaii can unlock.
Turned out better than I expected :D
this guy knows
That deserves way more credit.
I think it built up organically over the last days before popping off.
Whoosh
Never gets old
What was the dump?  Thanks.


I was stopped out on my long on that while sleeping.

This is the only time ever I managed to reenter from a stop loss at a better position as planned and then actually benefited after.
Pretty significant in my mind that you're acknowledging and coming to terms with it now. As I understand it you're still up from a long-held short? That alone takes discipline.
I'm with you on it going lower and lack of real buy pressure indicating continued weakness. I expected a bounce from 6900s but it was how high it spiked (I tried to catch falling upwards knife shorting at 7300-7500) that caught me off guard. Neglected the power/sheer amount of tinder from the shorts that turned the bounce into an explosion, one that liquidated my high leveraged shorts at 7700. 

My question to you and a lot of others saying this is accumulation is: how do you know so, AND could it be accumulation for collateral/powder to ignite a fall down next week? 

I'm still not buying into the "this is the cheapest BTC will be so whales are accumulating for the long term" narrative. OBV doesn't show major accumulation (the buy and hold type), but there def is a net increase in coins bought, but itnseemsnto be a relatively minor amoun. If whales thought this is the bottom and we're due for a new ath by end of 2018, they could accumulate more in a shorter span of time via a capitulation event. 

Tldr: all signs point to "fake accumulation"-- for sake of being able to ignite momentum towards sub 6k. Would like to hear why you guys think it's real accumulation. 
Thanks, much appreciated.
Ok... I said I saw it as a high probability event. If you read the link in my post above, I said 'we could easily short squeeze to 7700' and that there were accumulation signals, which is why I opened the long at that point. I was wrong about it needing to stay above 7K, but you can see in that earlier post that I had a wide stop so I kept it open when it retraced. I would never have claimed that it was a certainty, and I am not claiming now that I said that. However, I would not have opened it if I had not seen it as a high probability event.

Having said that, I make many mistakes and have made many bad trades.
Would you long here, though?
I'll wait with you with my scalp short. Lets grab a beer while we wait, if it's going down it will go down bleeding, slowly :)
Not to mention, we already blew through 7800 twice and now it's acting as support... which is what it has done in the past, as /u/veltrop pointed out.
No but it has been a very strong support ever since it was first closed. Its to be expected that it would turn to resistence. the fact that we are sitting just in a expected resistance is somewhat bullish, as, if traders are accounting for that, and we break through, we could easily paint another bull flag.
I think everyone here is missing it. There was significant resistance almost exactly here in November, causing a big drop right before the big December run up. It then acted as resistance on the way up too. Sorry I would provide a chart but on mobile rn
Well, you can consider 2 prior weak corrections before going above it and that the first time it went over bitcoin was sideways for a few days. But anyway if you dont trust that support turned resistence is a well known classic of this year. 
We just ascended through it for the third time today.

It's not
cheers mate
thanks mate
It's hard to enjoy these bull runs... bear markets really get me down.
I got short orders set for 8.5 and 8.7. Lets see what happens. 
Well, that was fun, as expected.
Because most "traders" are just degen gamblers
>This is why margin trading in this kind of volatile market is extremely risky. I really don't understand why so many people here do it.

Because it's fun, and if you get it right one gain run can offsett 10 losses as long as you manage your margin. But for most, it's just addictive gambling

But also when this market has moved 3-4% per day or less, margin is the only way to get 10% or more per day
It definitely takes over your life. It's a super exciting market, I mean look at CMC right now and sort by % gain, you don't see those gains anywhere else but on the flip side the losses can be insane and there's often no good reason for the rises and the falls. I day trade a very small % of my stack on bitmex with 5x leverage max, but it does keep me up at night sometimes so I wonder if it's worth it, it's like a heroin IV.  
Yeah 7k is a little too tight considering the way the markets been moving lately, could easily be taken out by a wick

not true at all, if by malicious you mean someone triggering it for personal gain 
Well it sounds right to me. Liquidating shorts forces them to buy bitcoin, which is gonna increase the price for obvious reasons.


And if said whale had opened a long beforehand with some different money... oh boy he's making bank. (Or she I guess...)
You’ve been a Redditor for 1234 days. Sorry for the irrelevant comment... just thought this was a fun number and wanted to share :)
manipulation meme found
As far as I know Bitfinex is the only place that makes it public.
I don't have "proof" in the sense of showing you the internals of an exchanges like Bitinex's trade history, but its a matter of incentives. With trading volume declining there is incentive to do this, and it makes sense while other options do not. The "smart whale" gains nothing by BARTing over and over. There needs to be positive delta between pump target and dump entry for it to make sense for a whale. Why would a whale be doing this? As far as your point of an exchange "risking their reputation", you should read up on the history of Bitfinex to see just how shady their history already is.
> A. An exchange risks their reputation completely to wreck longs or shorts for a tiny short term gain in fees.

Bitfinex has a reputation to wreck? That's news to me.
> An exchange risks their reputation completely to wreck longs or shorts for a tiny short term gain in fees.

The largest exchange by volume has zero oversight. They would be stupid not to be doing things to make money that would be illegal in other markets/jurisdictions.
By the looks of it, a drop back to the 7300-7600 range then a fucking rocket to god knows where 
*::dramatic squirrel::*
Lol I was thinking this earlier. If this is just a short squeeze win no follow through, it could happen. But never underestimate the power of fomo 
nope, you do not get liquidated from 6.8 to 7.8 on finex with highest leverage.
The closest I get to outside is /r/outside
1 million USD BTC by 2020.
Pretty much, yes.
At least you got some buys in in the $6,8's if I recall? Better than being totally out of position like myself.
basically my every day the past 3 weeks.
+1.. Lost all the paper gains from the previous long entry, didn't sell yet.
Well that's not surprising if you're considering the bear market over after a $200 pump in 2 days. 
I’m confused. Isn’t the “kimchi premium” typically interpreted as bullish? You buy when there is a “kimchi discount”?
What would that target be in the next few days?

I don't see a reason that really warrants bitcoins price to shoot up - no real news, updates, announcements, advancements.

People shouting around saying it feels like a reversal because of the 
+10% rise, but wasnt that due to the crazy number of shorts that were opened that basically propelled the price?

No evidence here only gut-feeling, but i could see some confidence start coming back soon and the longs start building again before we come back down - but yeah who knows.
After one pump? You believe we are done after one pump and short squeeze? Really? No retest, just one whale pump and we are done?
Where's your short at then
I say "probably not".

Show me on this doll where the bad man touched you.
Kind of a dick thing to outwardly root for people to lose money against your position..don't ya think??
Rule #1, please.
Thanks.  I tried to set the stop high enough so that I would very likely notice that the price was approaching my stop before it got triggered.  In this I failed!  I believe the contract price was about $6780 when I stopped watching a few hours ago.  I did not expect a $1380 move in the contract could happen so fast.  

Is it unusual for a BitMex bitcoin contract to swing from around $100 below the spot BTC price to over $100 above the BTC price in less than an hour?


There is no such thing as a sensible stop. No matter what price you pick, the chance of getting stopped out at a bad price is always much higher than the chance of exiting at a decent time.

The only sensible move is to not use stops.
I work with hundreds of IT professionals and many of them got burned recently and they are all salty. Literally not a single one of them intend to put any money back in. 
> up 20% in a single day .. depends which narrative the media 

This is always the narrative, media is *"today"* focused and *"today"* in markets is usually able to be spun as good news, even if it's bearish. Worst it gets is next day after everyone is rekt they have *"Green across the board with some of the biggest movers being.."*
4 days Bitcoin can confirm a double bottom on the weekly. Moving 8.5k to 11k has been done in 4 days twice in our past.
Well he has pretty good reason to i'd say. One pump does not make a trend reversal. Especially when that pump is mostly due to shorts covering.
Tone Vays (a.k.a. the Gilbert Gottfried of Bitcoin) is wildly overrated, in my opinion. I don't have anything against him personally, he just seems middling in both his knowledge of the markets and of the protocol. He's just been around for a little while and built up some name recognition.
Aside from his background as a former trader for Goldman Sachs (I believe), I've found that watching his shows along with a few others that have different TA methods (Chart Guys, Crypto Mastery) and usually between them they have a common message that is usually fairly accurate. 

Vays injects a lot of his own prejudice towards alt-coins and different people in the cryto-verse, but usually has a decent macro view on things.

The Chart guys are more micro-focused, which is useful on the more daily-centric trading that I do. 

Carter Thomas usually has interesting opinions on the meta side of things.

What are you talking about? The last time alts didn't rise with BTC for an extended period was the 11.8k DCB.

I've never understood the idea that alts must die before a true recovery. Many shitcoins will eventually die, sure, but not all alts are shitcoins (most do have technical/adoption issues to overcome, but so does every crypto just on different scales). In fact, I'd argue that alts recovering could be a sign of overall confidence in the crypto market and a precursor to a true recovery. That's entirely just sentiment and a personal opinion of course and there's plenty of times alts have temporarily recovered in this bear market before crashing further down. But I definitely disagree with it being bearish.
I'm noob-ish, but just read a comment on here a couple days ago that said because the RSI ignores all except the "candle close" that it is most appropriate to ignore the wicks. I would love to have someone else confirm this for me/us.
Yes I often get that question.  Wasn't sure about it myself even after researching but observing so many divs now I feel much more comfortable playing a div where the wicks dont agree with the candle bodies.

I went into more detail about it a couple days ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8b4twg/daily_discussion_tuesday_april_10_2018/dx4xokv/
I got stopped out at breakeven. 
He might be joking, but I think that scenario is ENTIRELY possible for some of the "investors" I've met.
yep, troll post for sure
2 seconds of his post history says he's trolling. 
I agree
Nice one! There was also a hidden bear div on the 4h. Once again my 7k short didn't hit during the night haha. I was gonna short at 6950 but chewy made me hesitate.. Anyway I had a stop short at 6870 so all good. Hope you were successful as well!

Accumulating longs on okcoin while he keeping down the market with shorting on finex. On the end he will get more btc with long positions. Once he accumulates enough.
wow... Just... wow.

I still think this is low leverage. Maybe 2x... probably 1x
Looks about ready to dump back down to 20k. 
Clear bull trap! *hides under rock*
Thanks for that, now pretty much everyone here would be loving this chart if it were true. 

but here we are today, people still not believing that we'll suffer more pain or believing that the bear market is all but done soon. 


lol it really looks insanely bullish :D
ATL imminent! $0.0001 bitcoins by june!
buy all of them and hold more bags!  great idea
It's not pointless, it's a lesson in being rational. You can't change human behaviour in some people but you sure as hell can limit expectations if you try to be more rational with our current situation.


Hahaha what a prophet. 
Whenever I see your username I think 'Chernobyl' - The 80's man. So much scarring.
right, ty ^^
How much of it was buying vs short wreckage though?
on gdax/eur somebody market sold 160 bitcoin (at the top) with slippage from 6500->5850 euro due to poor liquidity; price returned to 6300 euro a few seconds later; would like to have had some limit orders that low
Don't remind me! Hah (*but a sad hah*)
Noob question but when does the new daily begin exactly?
understood. thank you
How many people do you think had 100k to put into crypto over the last year?
yeah but how much BTC do they hold? Remember that like 90% of the people even into crypto don't even have 1 whole BTC
Not many people would carry on holding from 8k right up to 100k. There would be a lot of redistribution on the run up. Though I agree, I just can't see 100k happening. I'd probably sell everything I had if it hit 18k again.
it won't make as many as you think...its not like avg joes are investing tens of thousands of dollars...especially on the massive run-up last year....i'd say $5k seems reasonable for someone that doesn't not much about it, but is caught up in the hype...and that didn't even get you 1btc at the most recent bottoms.
When Bitcoin is 100K you would need 10 BTC to be a millionaire, if all 21 million BTC were evenly distributed that would create 2.1 million millionaires. 

That's honestly not that many additional millionaires, there are roughly 12-15 millionaire households in the world today. 
I've believed in $1M for a couple of years now IF it can survive past the point of no return. Thats the point where governments and banks get how destructive it will be to their vested interests but too late for them to do anything meaningful about it.

“only 21 million coins for 6.8 billion people in the world if it gets really huge” Satoshi Nakamoto
It's not, but fresh money doesn't need to enter for the beginning of a reversal. 

Generally it will be a lot of people who sold the top (and the bottom, :/ ) re entering. The new money will have to come into play past $11k, because that's where people from Dec-jan will begin to cut their losses unless they see strong sustained upwards movement. 

This was primarily a short squeeze (16.5k btc bought from shorts closing is crazy. Absolutely wild!) But that doesn't mean it isn't "legitimate." 

The buying isn't real buying yet but the psychological effect of a short squeeze could trigger lots of different things in the market. 

It's not.  Simple push by whales to expose overextended shorts.  We'll fuck around a bit in the 8s and then slowly go back down.
kind of like the last few months long? 
Oh, you can count on at least a couple weeks, I assure you.
Thanks for your feedback, much appreciated. Any plan should be dynamic and subject to change for sure. But as you say better to have some strategy against which you can operate rather than flying by gut instinct.
Yikes. Stop loss hit. Sitting out for now.
> Remind me - how long was the funding rate at 0.375% during the bull run? 

This is what struck me when people started claiming it was "high". 
strange really, 

ppl appear to be trading based on the no. of shorts and funding rates.




Not totally risk free. You can use the lending market on BFX though if you don't buy the FUD. but there is no risk free money there's always some counter-party risk
I'm not familiar with using the instruments on Bitmex to hedge a long position to profit from the funding rate. Perhaps the other Bitmex vets here can help you out with this. 

The other alternative is the one which mjneat has suggested: lending it out on Bitfinex. 
Yeah it starts to remind me when we hovered too long around 9k in february...
Another pump.  Have your feelings changed again?
quickmafs
I mean, yes. You do the derivative of it since the steepest high point and you do the one since the last point from where it would be positive.  When they cross one of the trends will prove to be stronger thus traders will gain confidence on it triggering a bigger move. 

What's not to understand?
bad day.
It's why we love it though
The rhetoric is from an interview on Bloomberg, video in the article. It is just one guy's take, though.
Thanks for the feedback. It was one of my random Google cards. 
If we assume manipulators have strong control over this market, I see this flag breaking up to really get the fomo going. Then we watch the longs pile up before a big nasty bart.

Organic volume still dwindling, making this progressively easier to execute.
Not cocky just thought it was noteworthy how the past few days bears have been setting stops at 7100 that definitely got surpassed.
the flag portion of the bull flag = consolidation of price before next move; this involves cooling off of oscillators/indicators as well as price target considerations based on pivots or fibs that traders wait for to ensure their optimal r/r.  In other words, bulls have a setup that may or may not confirm, but based on recent price and volume action; short term traders entering new positions, r/r favors the bulls.  Let's see what happens by end of day,
Why doesn't it seem that way to you? It seems to me like the Mad Dumper is out of coins and needs to cover. As supply has dwindled since he began this project in January, he's going to find it quite expensive. We are going to see a 100 percent rise in the next two weeks, and a new all-time high this summer. Mark my words. !RemindMe 1 month.
That, or sideways for a while. It doesnt seem to have much upside right now. 
I’m alone on my gang. Literally had a friend buy a couple grand in litecoin at $380, sell at $101, bought back at $220, sold again at $160. 

I tried to convince him to buy Ltc when it was at $60, he did not listen at the time.
2014 is a cautionary tale.  Many people didn't heed the warnings at $20,000 either.
It is a speculative bubble popping so of course it has something to do with 2018.
I would agree but so far we have strongly followed 2014 to a point where it's silly and stubborn not to consider it. 
If you believed it and traded on that belief, you would indeed have plenty of BTC.
Oh well, 1 week log chart still shows a pretty sold downtrend.  But at least some hope today and I'll take it as well.
This. Back in the day everyone thought btc's only use case was buying drugs and mt. Gox hack was still fresh. 
No market is completely different from another market.  Fish market isn't completely different than BTC market so BTC market from two different years certainly isn't completely different.
I always laughed at that and I still do most of the time, but the price did go to $20K, which was pretty f*cking different, so have to remember that anything is possible with crypto. 
Of course it is.  Not 100% but not 0%.

The past performance of the last speculative bubble was echoed by this one and 70% drop from the high...even thought last one was 85%....still same ballpark.
>Post performance is not indicative of future gains

It literally is, they are the same thing 😂 
\~9k, give or take.
I remember reading this this morning and thinking, 8173 no way. Much respect for /u/joyrider5, I'm really impressed. Maybe I should learn point&figure...
Honestly it's hard to tell, with a pump like this it's difficult to chart anything. I'd say 7.5k at least (but full disclosure i'm biased as I have an underwater short at this level), and maybe 7.2k if this pump was really only manipulation/short squeezing. 

Like /u/dushmankush said if we retrace below 7.2/7k, it's going to be a massacre for the bulls. Of course, maximum pain in both direction is also possible.

Some of you guys are all right... Don't trade tomorrow
Excellent timing on this comment as well. 
To the moon!
8k in 3 minutes :)
any source?
based on what
meh, thats not news. And something along this line is posted pretty much on a daily basis. 

(not saying i don't agree with you btw)
But now I'm greedy and will wait for 7550
really? The 1h tells otherwise
In both posts I specifically stated that I'm long (primarily because of the ATH shorts) and if that doesn't state my expectations of future market actions I dunno what else will.
For now, yes, right about 9k, but then there's resistance at 10k and ~12k.
Not gonna lie. I FOMO'd in during the pump. Got in below 7400 but doesn't necessarily feel like I'm part of anything special except a manipulated pump
15,000 out of 25,000 btc bought were shorts closing. 

Madre DE Dios I was wrong about a short squeeze. Not fuckin around with that shit again, although I get the feeling shorts aren't going to pile up again in fear of that

Really should've trusted my feelings that high $6k was accumulation and someone was gonna pump this

It's very clear there is one or several market makers who have no intention of giving anyone a free ride to the bottom.

If $7.3k holds then I think I'm going long but unleveraged. Waiting for a pullback to see how far down it goes. Would be surprised to see a push past $8k before another pullback although it's possible if "the market" is eager enough to move up 
So basically you don't know shit, so you made up an interesting scenario... Cool story bruh!
The Chart > Masterluc

Masterluc is no longer in control. The Chart is (self fulfilling prophecy).
the chart doesn't lie
Source?

I've seen this previously and requested source. No one has given a source for this affirmation.
when next week close below red line
During the bull run he posted this exact pattern like 3 different times on each consolidation. He's got something on the 4th try. Yay, TA god
it's not not on target either
I am meaning the general trend
And supposedly you're 'bullish'?
I lost all my funds on OKC three years ago on future trading Litecoin. It went from like 80 cent to 4-5$ in a week. I doubled my position for every winning trade :) :D 
Would have loved to have a short above 8k. Not sure now. Might place another 8k sell in case. 
What? Price stability is exactly what bitcoin needs. Once we have price stability we can all start using it to buy things. The only reason people aren't using it is the potential for bitcoin to 10x. I want to be able to buy anything and everything with my bitcoin AND use it as my bank. And even right now I can't use it as my bank effectively because of how volatile it is. There's two things bitcoin needs to do in the next 10 years for it to survive the next 100 and that is to be able to do micro transactions efficiently and find a stable price. 

Don't get me wrong, bitcoins price will always increase as it is deflationary system. Bitcoins will be lost over time making all other bitcoins more valuable so in the future I can imagine bitcoin will grow at a stable 2-3% a year making it a desirable investment but not so much so that people won't want to spend it now on food or other items. Personally, I *can not wait* for the day I can spend my bitcoins on everything.

Edit: tl;dr If trading bitcoin was it's only use case it would be worthless. 
I'm more wondering about the behavior of Stop-Limit orders on GDAX that have the potential to act as a **market** sell (the latter scenario in your reply) - ie, setting a stop of 6700 with a sell limit price of 6650 would require a market order once the market reaches 6700. Would GDAX reject the order when the time comes? 
So basically ~~either~~ someone is funding BTC for more people to short to crash the price or to create a trap for a short squeeze ?
Is it safe to assume that a large proportion of buys in this 2 year bull run were to drive a bubble, profit and now short / fund shorts back to pre-bubble with all that bought btc (for yet more profit)ready for a new cycle?

If so, there may still be some way down.

EDIT: clarification
brilliant, thnx!
Thanks
I'm hoping the next dip will be around 5800 euros so I can get back in at break even. I think has potential to test the longer term downtrend so I hope I won't be left behind.
:D
A lot of those are underwater.
That’s more than a quarter of a billion dollars at current prices
wow it has been awhile with such huge volume. thanks for the info mate.
same here I thought it was a glitch!
funny they have a checkbox now:

What are your intended activities on **our** platform?

- Investing

- Trading

- Online gambling related activities

I know they meant something else (gambling 'outside' their platform), but it looks like they are listing different trading personalities :)
5x leverage so if it hits 7830, id trigger a stop. 
Was it just a liquidity problem? I'm really not well researched on the incident.

I don't know if, say, the liquidation meltdown had happened on say Kraken if the market would've followed more.
Holy FUCK. And that's even taking into account those of us opening shorts on the way down now.

Here's the longs: https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSDLONGS/
https://www.tradingview.com/chart/r6HVKwIV/

39 to 28, both sides are covering significantly
> the longs covered just as much as the shorts

Are you blind?
im pretty sure that means it wasn't. 
that’s why you sit on your hands rn
Yeah, I edited while you were responding.
Bit coin is people!!
I thought we were at a decisive zone where it could start a leg up (yesterday) or violently break down (today). Do you never use high leverage with tight stops ?
Thanks for the advice ! I believe you have the best long term strategy, but I'm a student so your 3x is probably significantly higher than mine in absolute value :) That's a common feeling that lead many small players to liquidation, but somewhat valid I think. 

I go with the biased but shared assumption that Bitcoin will have an rally in the coming months, obvious enough to get a x2 with a x10 leverage. So i'm sometimes trying high risk/reward trades in decisive price ranges with stops at 5% loss, with a hard mental stop if my stack ever becomes half its initial deposit. Again, this is not a huge stack and I have a holding stack.
how the hell is a 30 minute candle fomo? It takes days to move money into crypo from the old system
Will have to wait and see
today is a good day, my friend - savor and enjoy it!
Strong resistance is around $8,692, but a little manipulation is all it takes to push through and then we start another FOMO run.
He? Did you talk to someone in person?
Hmm. Is that analysis based on Murphy's law or something else?
Probably the lengthy sideways chop immediately preceding it. 
look at the charts, the basic pattern is the same. 
Fakeout wouldn't go above 9200. Over 9200 is a definitive break of the downtrend channel from 20K. 

Shorting 9300 is literally the worst place ever. 
Not today my friend not today 
The oldest trick in the book.
Now with the added short macro betting of Soros
average joe does not think this is a fake out, for sure not. 12k shorts got closed, majority of them with a hugh loss. 
we dont know how many are underwater we are now sub 28k, so 12.5k shorts closed. 
shorts are not increasing here, only decreasing and price remains the same...
if you're trying to get your fiat out before tax day, you should have taken it out before now...i don't think tax day will be a factor
Maybe that's what they wanted you to think, and you're actually triple fucked?  Bitcoin-inception.  FUD within a FUD.
yeah this is making me wary. I migt close my short now at a small profit and reopen if this "bear flag" breaks down
jesus christ you guys,

dont frikkin go allin and dca your way into a position.

its a bear market if you didnt know, so as long as you have enough ammunition, you should be gold with a short. 
We ve had alt pumps. But never so Big as this one.
The only thing that make me look at the market a bit different from the usual short the bear top , is that the price movement is less violent after each drop now. If we break below 6800 then I reevaluate. 
"It's up to 7700? Wasn't it over 10,000 last week? sounds like its shit to me"
I still wait for the CNBC "how to short btc" news
Not all of us
That's like asking me what i'm doing in this subreddit :)
no, under 6k means it will diddle daddle with 5k for a bit...

this is gonna be a slow decline
Thanks.
Pretty crazy that longs dropped almost as hard as shorts. Roughly about 13k BTC of shorts and 10k BTC of longs closed during that huge 1h candle. This means a lot of the closing orders for the shorts were bought up by longs closing - leaving 3k BTC of short closing orders left. However, the volume during the run up was huge, about 80k BTC I believe. Does this mean most of the price increase was not caused by short squeeze, but by new money incoming, people trading the breakout and people jumping on the bull train?

(Please tell me if I'm wrong)
Wow. That’s actually ridiculous, talk about a squeeze. 
You in a position now, or seeing how this plays out? 
> 20,000

Bitfinex? 24,000

https://i.imgur.com/0AGZBrf.png
Yeah, markets full of surprise past few days.
What are your stops? Sub 7500?
Don't disagree with the logic (though I'm struggling to pull the trigger myself) but Bitfinex shorts are below 25k right now.
Asia was up for the pump.
FOMO is hard there, wouldnt count on it
Asia usually pumps just so you know.
Asians go with the herd not against it ;)
I mean, using the word “anecdotal” doesn’t mean it didn’t happen, just means it’s an isolated event and not necessarily a portrayal of the bigger picture 
you are absolutely right! I have been misusing that word, and that is painful for me to admit. what I meant to say is that it's an isolated incident upon which no specific conclusions can be drawn. 
I hope so. Lots of support before 6.4k.
Imagine the money he'd have made had he let it ride? Still, trading is about risk/reward, and he did the right thing closing in profit. You never know where the market will go.

Had he left it open, and bitcoin fell instead, everyone would be saying how greedy he was an should have taken profit.

He still profited, just not as much.
yes he said that. I think he said it stands for mega which i think is $1K
then check the transfer dates and check the bitcoin price just after transfers! 
03-19 and 03-24 10.000 bitcoin together so you should think as batch. keep checking; 02-06, 03-06
people withdrawing coins?
you will have less money that you did before.
open the link, check the transfer dates and check the bitcoin prices just after the transfers. always dump coming after transfer from this wallet. 
In the past month its been mostly bearish trade ideas, but I've been seeing more and more bull trade ideas lately.  I'd say its pretty neutral right now.
Thanks!
Thanks for the reply.  I set a sell order at 7100 from 6900.  Damn this is easy.  Obviously I am joking I will get REKT.  No doubt in my mind.
Agreed. I'm leaning towards building up a short at these levels, as the 1h+ candles are in the over bought territory. But if I'm correct, is it true in more bullish trends being overbought isn't as strong of an indicator to finding the top? vice versa for bear trends.
Sounds like a good idea, stick to your plan and you should come out alright.
Damn, June futures hit 8050 on that run. I have a scalp open from 7680 but was at the store. 
Nah, practically everyone was bearish.
Yup. I may long but you'd be a fool to long directly after a candle like that. Soon though.
Fomo
"buying pressure." Do you really think that incredible volume spike was driven by some renewed interest in the asset? That a bunch of people suddenly felt that BTC was worth more and jumped in?
15k shorts have already closed (more than 1/3 of the total), while longs are starting to re-open. A fair number of the remaining shorts could be simple hedges. Hard to know the impact from here, I think.
> This morning spot dumped from 6900+ to 6750 in a flash. 

That is known as a bear trap.  It was dumped on purpose before it was pumped even harder.
So it was just some whales making some moves but for most likely personal reasons, not because of market related news or causes.
Well, dApps have found some real use cases and are being deployed, although slowly.

Monero does what monero does. 

I think monero is a very safe bet.
[deleted]
that will only work for US Whales tho..?
[deleted]
There would be manipulation in those market too but I don’t think your own broker would be stop hunting to liquidate your position.
Yes I seem to have impeccable timing lately. But the day isn't over yet.
Thanks for the advice.  I wasn't completely accurate (watching candles) it is 50% of my YOLO stack.  I'm long term bullish, short term more USD-ish.
A guy who shorted at 6500 , was down 75% and was begging for advice. 
Agree. A move like that injects signification emotion in the market which may dilute the effectiveness of TA near-term. Americans awoke to this pop and had all day to sell into it but didn't. What happens when Asians wake, see the pop and see that it held all day?  
  
That said... it only takes one whale to bart it.  
  
That said... i suspect it's harder for a whale to dump the market now than it was 12 hours ago because more BTC may be needed. It's also riskier and potentially less profitable since the [long-short ratio](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSDLONGS/) has equalized more.  
  
Who knows, but I'll wager long for now.  
Thanks for the advice, I appreciate it. You mean I could get caught by a fake out that does not go up until my target and end up underwater?

I might as well go to sleep without a position and just put some alerts
Oh no say it ain't so. How much did you make on your long today? 
Yeah but who could have seen this coming. Well except chewy lol
Nope the first shoulder starts around 6 hours ago
https://imgur.com/TI0TrGO
So if this is what happened we will slowly reset to $7 ish through the next 24 hours...time will tell....
"for sure"
I wonder how many "clever" traders set stop limit buys just over $8K trying to catch the breakout?

*sad trombone*
In times like this when the pump wasn't organic and there's no follow up organic buying even after the retracement, can it still happen? To the naked eye this seems like a slow bleed to 7.2K where it may or may not bounce. I feel like if this dips below 7.2K its RIP for any chance of a bull market.
Sentiment has been changing, you can see it across the entire space over the past week. It was just confirmed in 1hr. 
Out at breakeven boyo wassup
I'm hoping it was a fake out, meaning it would go down, but the market seems to be behaving a bit differently now, changing to a Bullish mindset so it probably is just a stop hunt.
2 weeks ago i would go short every time a flag/pennant/wedge broke up and go long every time it broke down.
I was asked by u/Hotsoccerman to explain my reasoning before their comment got deleted: but zooming out and looking at the last month's action, we see 8.4k being reasonably well resisted and supported... Add to that a little bit of needed sideways now to allow RSIs too cool off, we should also be in the position to test the log downtrend roughly at the price 8.4k sometime between 3-6 days. I'm betting that downtrend is still a very scary agent to many, and I see that as a good opportunity to short. Feedback welcome

I think this is the guy who started getting people to look at metcalfe's law when they model the  price of bitcoin against other metrics.
It’s like playing a game.

I say btc will hit 50k.

Next.
That was one of them.  Spencer Bogart was just on with a pretty bullish tone.
Thanks, I just spit all over my screen. I'll get some LED wipes, be right back. 
I closed at breakeven. It's still a bear market but it depends on your leverage and risk tolerance whether you want to hold or not. 

Perhaps hold out for a few hours and if no retracement occurs by then, then consider eating a loss. I wouldn't get too greedy to exit at a profit though, 6k is now a very strong candidate for very long term bottom. Although, not as strong as bulls here think. 
Yeah, so like I said the other day, a broken record is only right until it's not.
100%+
shorting now seems like trying to catch the knife upwards
Feeling pretty dumb now I'll bet. 
Very well let me spell it out. Price is going sideways yet the number of shorts is at an all time high. What do you think happens when all these shorts close or get liquidated? They have to buy, which will raise the price significantly and the downtrend will be broken. The short squeeze is real. If we don't get a significant drop by next week hello bull run.
do you even know who is tim draper? looks like there are many newbies here. 
No such thing in crypto
Call me idealistic but a manipulated market is not a true market. 
It's a local bull flag.

and

The entire damn dip from 20k is one huge bull flag... lol
Looks like one. And that was solid buying at 7.6. But I have PTSD from all the previous bullflags :O
Spot on.
Know thy self, know thy enemy. A thousand battles, a thousand victories.
Thanks, that's a very interesting book to read in any case! Awesome man.

I'm saying that's wrong. There is no accumulator. There is only the market and the market as a whole was accumulating. Smart money is just the side which wins.

The amount this sub talks about whales triggers me senseless. Whales don't move the market. What controls more volume: 1 whale? a pod of 16 whales? or the market- 16 whales?

Whales don't win trades because they have more assets, they have more assets because they're better traders: markets are probably more predictable than you think.

That's kinda off topic but I just wanted to take the opportunity to rant.


Lmao
Lmao that was /u/oftencontroversial
[deleted]
Is there a market humans are involved with that is Organic? 
Bitcoin's use case is speculative trading though.
Not necessarily, but that *does* make more sense. 
Agreed, the RSI is pegged out on most time frames, and the buying pressure has been steadily relentless. It's been a while since we've had this kind of relentless upward movement over longer time frames.  Makes you think it's not all just a short squeeze and there's actual buying interest now.
>Started at $6,940. 

Ballsy. Very nice trade! 
Nice!
I sometimes feel like 5% of some folk in here's trading stack is enough to buy my house =)

Good luck
Also we are at the top of the bull flag, wouldn’t it be more realistic to set a long at the prices of around 7550-7600 with targets of 7700+? 
the correct % does not really matter in the long term anyway
It's almost too obvious a short here. That's why I'm doing the opposite. 
leonardo dicaprio killed it 
Nice same here! Thanks
Why June Futures? Why not swaps, is it because of the fee? I am trading on Bitmex and not sure exactly how to choose between swaps or between the futures themself.
[deleted]
I don't see it as good or bad. It just is. It's perfectly natural for a new currency bootstrapped out of nothing (with no backing) to first gain a foothold as a wildly speculative play, and then much later gain acceptance as a currency. Of course the latter is far from guaranteed, and will take much longer than most expect. But the wild volatility and bubble cycles are a natural part of its growth process, in my opinion.
at least that makes the arguments in btc vs. bch even more entertaining 
Agree with this.  Short term we are speculating.  But the reason people invest is because down the road it will be useful.  


This guy says he is a multi millionaire but all he does all day is troll this subreddit. Every time it goes up he gets hysterical. It’s his outlet to vent his frustrations with losing a lot in this space.
What other analogy can be used? Digital roulette table? Digital equity not backed by anything? The gold analogy is used because it really the only legitimate use that makes sense at this price right now.
So what is it supposed to be? 
Agreed. I'm flipping bullish but 8k might of been it for a month.
Given how weak buying power has been in the past weeks I don't see how the market takes us for another trip past 8k today - more likely people will want to see days/weeks above 7.5, no?

I'm prepared to be very wrong, as I was this morning.
Ha!  At least I know how to count now.... 

A bit more up, maybe, then back down. Bearish as of this morning, but not sure after the holding of these levels. 
Well I tip my hat to you Chewie. 
Thank you for the cautionary note. I was long anyway and I've been waiting for this for months. It's probably a little early but my gut feeling is that accumulation is over and the giant descending triangle is going to break up.
Yup makes sense :)
Interesting. Thanks for the explanation. 
What's funny is I changed my mind but not my position.

I said this was accumulation and started to seriously doubt another move down. Most of my "there won't be a short squeeze" was me being contrarian and stubborn. I knew deep down this was coming and failed to act upon it. Oh well, yet another lesson learned that my trading instincts are quite good but my discipline is God awful  
It's funny because Sloppy probably has had the best long-term position/return on here for the past 45 days lol (stupid high leverage/scalping aside)
Here's my strategy, which I think is also generally bad but it seems to manage regret fairly decently.

I've set some TP every hundred or two from here to 8.5 in case it spikes/retraces during sleep.

Have already taken 50% profits since opening at 6.8ish.  As I go up I try to make it so that the total profit taken is never greater than the total remaining potential profit if it were closed at that moment.

A little of that of the profit taking was above 7.9, so when we were back at 7.6~7.7, I recharged the long with that same amount, effectively turning everything taken above 7.9 into a scalp.  New CA is about 7000 and SL is 7200.

I'll repeat this procedure as we go up, until the CA catches up enough that the SL gets triggered by a knife or something shitty and I wish that I had closed the whole position on the previous iteration but at least I won't regret the profits taken.

I'm terrible at not just closing a whole position out in one swoop, just can't bring myself to do it.  Hate to miss a gap and reenter higher, I always reenter with bad timing.  And scared to reenter when it's going lower.  Or I build up my new position too slow and doing the dance with the previous position would have been better.
Apparently, yes! But this right move came with some wrong moves at my end unfortunately.
Judging by his upvotes i don't think anyone thinks he was being sarcastic 
as long as you’re on the right side of it
Yes still significantly up but could be up a *lot* more if I had tried to trade this with some discipline. I attribute most of it to laziness and complacency- it was nice not worrying about btc for once. 

I began to concede my argument that we were going lower about  a week ago and people were surprised I was doubting we were moving below $6k before $8-10k. But didn't listen to myself...
No
The fact that longs are piling up gives me some hope. We've seen these violent liquidating moves before, and they often retrace (slow bleed), and often break down hard. I'd probably reduce my position by 1/2 at 75xx, but at this point I'm not wildly optimistic I'll be in the green for quite some time. My fault for not setting stops :)
There isn't even a sell wall. We're right under it and we've gone through it twice today.
It isn't "through it" until 8k is broken for some time. 
Sorry, wasn't looking at the 1 m, fifth time today.
Cheer up buddy. You know these things turn around and odds are it will soon. If not, no worries because you can continue to accumulate and in all likelihood you'll have made off well. In the end it's just money so make sure you spend time with those you care about. 
Re entered at $7880. Lol can't stop shorting this shit. 

We've not been this oversold on 1h in months, most of the time it happens on big breakthroughs ($5k, $3k) but this was just a short squeeze.


The low volume push to $8k again had me itching to short. Should've pulled the trigger at $7950 for a much better entry. Unfortunately was too pussy and entered kinda low. Will probably stop this one out on a new local high, ~$8075

Looking to close on strong support at $7.5k or $7.1-7.3k. Depends how hard we dump, if we even do, really. May just close at $7.7k if we hover for too long. 
*nods in agreement from across the room
And then you are back to square one and in the same boat as Mr Hodler who done nothing but hodl and pick his nose while staring blankly at the wall. Boys and girls don't feed the "cartel", "invisible hand", "whales". Just hodl or play the ratio game (carefully).
I feel the same. There's really no point trading smaller time frames in crypto without leverage.
Lately as in since January 2009?
Yep, apparently he changed/masked it a couple of days ago. TBH I have no idea - just saw some dude mention it in aabtc's tg chan.
Every trade is motivated by personal gain.  Do you honestly trade with the intention of losing money?
and when that happens sell orders get very thing an slippage  is massive. Thats what its behind the wicks in all big pumps. And dumps of course.
Thanks kitty.
> Why would a whale be doing this?

Create liquidity, or a group of whale doing this to help their leveraged positions.
I don't see the drop back to 7300. It looks like below 6k to me
ok thanks for the info
Yes, I did ok, thankfully. But where to go from here!
> Well that's not surprising if you're considering the bear market might be over after a $200 pump in 2 days.

No I totally think we're heading out of it. Which is different from being in a bull market. We've not seen sub 6k for 2 months and if we've got close we just hang around 6600 all cosy like.

On balance that's enough to flip me a little bullish. Even if all it means is we range for a year.
You act like it's a certainty this 'bear market' instead of a long correction. But just keep pimping out your short maybe it will work for you.
So kimchi being at a minus means a lot for korea. As I explained yesterday due to capital controls this really shouldn’t happen, especially 3%, to me it generally signifies a bottom and a reversal coming up because it should almost always trade at a premium. I don’t mind it though cause I’m arbitraging like a mad man. Personally I don’t think an insane kimchi premium is bullish as much as a kimchi discount. 

During the last fall I learned that but I have a pretty small sample size, but I trusted it and it paid off again. 
Fair. 
>Do mind me asking where you opened? 

[$7640.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8bnetl/z/dx8ymiw)
It's going up so fast, we're going back in time!
Evidence to support a bull market or a bear market is only ever pieced together retrospectively at the best of times. Bitcoin does what it wants to do. The times when it has rallied the most have very often been the times when it had absolutely no reason to do so. Having said that - there are definitely reasons for it to rally. Geopolitical uncertainty, George Soros and co, ETFs back on the horizon, etc ...
> I don't see a reason that really warrants bitcoins price to shoot up 

It was very low, and it stayed pretty flat there for awhile without getting lower.  That's reason enough.
Of course not. This reversal was much bigger than one pump. It was just the confirmation. Look across the entire space and you see all the signs have been showing up for the past 2 weeks. Sure it could go back down, but the odds clearly in the bulls favor.
9250
Horrible advice right there. Trading without stops is flipping coins or gambling. At least have a mental stop and an alert on which you can act quickly.
Greed is a helluva drug.

Just wait.
https://blog.plan99.net/the-resolution-of-the-bitcoin-experiment-dabb30201f7 
Maybe you are right, but 1 BTC (and even 0.3 BTC) is a silly amount to put on the line if you are just starting off. Also, I think it is a big mistake to assume that everyone here daytrades with huge amounts. A lot of people I know daytrade very small amounts, like under 0.3 BTC, and perhaps don't publicise it as much as those who boast about their millions. I wanted to bring it up in case the OP was feeling peer pressure to trade with a lot of btc just because others here seem to be doing it :) 
Haha gotcha. Congrats man. Play it safe, win streaks are notoriously bad for preserving profits. 
No it will not. A down trend is a TREND, but if it for example closes above 8k, then 9k, then moves around 10 and so on, it is a trend reversal especially if 12k holds for long
He means the steepness between two points. In this case, 7 days.
If the price moved steadily from $8000 to $19000, that would not be a clear downtrend on the 1w chart.
You're completely right about the confidence part. But don't try to discuss that here. They think that if alts are dead BTC will be at $1Million. It's an impossible discussion.
That's the exact comment I was referencing! Thanks for linking it.
Congrats, just got into my short at 6907 before drop, just lucky that it happened right now, gonna put a stop at break even in case this drop isn't what it seems and then sequentially drop my stop short if it keeps going down...another day of being in front of a screen. Cheers mate!
And after he accumulates the amout he wants, what's he supposed to do ?  HODL ?
Care to explain for a noob what that actually means ?
I was like, what shitcoin is this and why do I care it's going to 0.
So, we're in an inverted bull market ?
Haha yea I know! If that was real the FOMO on here would be mega.

Yet the board is basically what... 60% bull still? Or at least 60 % the bear market is near end.

Hey it might be near end but looking at the chart rationally, it sure as hell doesn't look like it. 
not many shorts got rekt yet, thats the weird part
Shorts still havent closed signifcantly. This is buy pressure IMO
Shorts down ~3k in the past three hours. 
Midnight UTC.
Not only this, but the majority of "normal" people wont survive the ride to $100k. Imagine a dump from $60k->25k. Even for people who own 1BTC that will be quite a swing in terms of purchasing power.

Many if not most normal/weak handed people will, believe it or not, LOSE money on a wild ride up to $100k.
You mean 12-15 million millionaire households, just checking.
I can get behind that. I agree though, I’m very cautiously coming out of the bear cave, but im not straying too far from it until this breaks up and STAYS upward
If you're so sure about this, how much money did you put on it, and what's your stop loss?
The combination of high funding rate, plus a well-defined price level for a meaningful stop, gave me a high reward-to-risk situation, so I took it and shared it with the guys here.

A potential short squeeze is really just a bonus here.
I'm OK with the counter party risk. I meant regarding margin calls etc. if I long 1x on bitmex I get the funding? 
That was when I opened a long hoping the price would rise, it collapsed, so did my position. 

I didn't knew shorting then, now I do. :)
I turned bearish and whole world is bullish. Whats wrong.
I hope you realize that the derivative is not defined for any price chart. A price chart is not even a function, since for every t in [0,T] there can be at most two prices at time t, the time before the market buy/sell and the price directly after, which is basically the limit approaching from the left and the limsit approaching from the right

A price curve/graph is not even continuous, let alone differentiable
I know it's bad but closed quickly and fomo longed at 7423, made up for my loss. Jeez, if only I hadn't been stopped out of my long from 6830 tonight... I hate myself

I have no idea how far we will go up/break the 20k trend line. I am talking about short-term. 
What the fuck
Same rules apply for bulls and bears, we agree.
What did 2014 tell us about 20k and the current market?  Just that the price could go down and/or the market might be a bear market for a while?  

I just feel that Mt. Gox makes 2014 different.  Obviously Impossible to tell at this moment. 
Yes I remember you posted that the $17,000 bounce was very similar to the first bounce in 2014 in % terms.  I should have listened to you with that one or at least traded on that observation much better.
Could you expand on this please?  What are the strong similarities?  Thanks
Yeah, today was quite refreshing. Let's see where we'll be next week ;)
Can't go down forever just like it can't go up forever ;)
1k was also different back in the day. Hell, $1 was a hell of a milestone.
Lol I'm only teasing. I mean if we were to believe the line I said, there would be no sense in identifying and analysing trends. 

You do point out an excellent caution and I applaud you for it. There is however always the chance that we are all wrong, Imean, this IS Bitcoin after all
I know a different type of point and figure. I point at a price and figure "here's a good price for sell/buy order".

... I'll see myself out. 
The guru you're referring to kept spamming we'd be under $6k by now. He's a walking troll factory.

Stick around more and you'll learn it's best to ignore him until he gets liquidated out at $8k and finally leaves us be. 
That guy's always predicting a bull massacre. All I see is bear rugs. 

$7.5 will be new support, then zoom up. Long term "three higher lows" usually means Bitcoin is about to go on a tear. I see $5.9, $6.6 and $7.5. New ATH by June.
http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/992/468/17e.jpg
Didn't you get the call?
nooo :(    

I bought a bit at 7601; I will never be totally out of position in Bitcoin again :/
Still holding yours? I've been gone a while. 
I know from the available information that this was largely a short squeeze. No, I am wildly speculating on the whale behavior honestly. 
Fair enough, as good an answer as I could expect.
Hah, well I haven’t changed that flair in years.  I have been bearish for the past couple of months( we are in a bear trend).  But I will say that I am starting to wonder if we will confirm a double bottom at 6/6.4.  Problem is it won’t confirm until around 12k.  So, I am still more bearish right now.  Should change my flair, but I don’t really feel like it.  
had one @7960 but closed it @7800 to make up for the losses from my short @7469. 
Had a long from 6850 but closed by mistake @6922 when i set my stop loss @8650 instead of 6850...
So clusterfuck after clusterfuck... Could have scored big and barely broke even...
Have a small scalp short @7700 with stops @7850, but not seeing a lot of chances for success, but its a minor loss if it gets stopped...
No matter how stable bitcoin is no one is going to actually start using it to buy things if anything we've been losing merchants, google searches for bitcoin don't skyrocket because people are searching for new ways to buy things they skyrocket because bitcoin is fucking MOONING, like it or not THAT's the real use case that's what motivates the average user to learn what's Coinbase and to open an account, for the vast majority of people paypal and their credit cards are orders of magnitude more useful than bothering with wallets, private keys and unpredictable fees not to mention something as complicated for the average Joe as the lightning network.

tl:dr if bitcoin had no moon or volatility and buying things was the only use case being as it is more convoluted and useless for the vast majority of consumers than other methods it will slowly die down.
No it would fill as a market order. The limit just guarantees that you won't fill at a price lower than it. If the price is higher than the limit it'll execute as a market sell until up to the limit price. Depending on its location you could end up with a partial fill. I don't believe the stop limit has a post only setting.
Yes, and very cheap funding at that.

Just wait until BTC whale pulls all his cheap funding.
Yep. It seems heavily manipulated. I have never seen so much BTC be offered, even when much better rates and price was offered.
Seems like it. I would not assume anything though, theres so many new powerful actors and Btc is more mainstream than ever.
Welcome.
Those are steadily closing as we speak while the price slightly drops. There is apparently enough selling pressure to cover the underwater limit-order shorts in the buybook right now without forcing liquidation. Down to 26.8 already, less shorts than longs right now.
mindfuckery at its best
Not during periods of chop where I could lose my entire stack in  an hour, no 
Any day that BTC is over 1500, it is being supported by FOMO.  This includes those who were FOMO in the runup, and are just letting their BTC sit there hoping for another maniacal spike.
Really looking forward to the weeks and months ahead.
nope...just import your transactions and it takes care of it...seriously, works like a charm
Yep there was a ton of tension back then and then a pop out of nowhere.
This 'basic pattern' being just a huge rise followed by months of decline?
im following the 2014 chart, until btc shows me it is not anymore. 
^ this, I remember someone posting a chart comparing 2014 and we're near a pump
we do . Every short that opened from last time bitcoin was at this price. 
and if this was an orgnaic market it would be cause for concern

but its not, someone who had enough cash to make the spike this morning, definitely has enough cash to repeat it 

you don't spike things up on a hour candle and then pack it up and go home. This is someone' strategy being played out
Ahhhh shit, gonna put on my tinfoil hat and think about this for a while...
ALL IN 100% PORTFOLIO 100X LEVERAGE CANT GO WRONG DUDE. No but seriously, never go all in, only trading a bit cause this could be fake, then if it isn't I add to position like you said, DCA. Still deciding whether it will continue going down tho
I'm starting to think it's not a bear market anymore.
teach me how to get off the hopium dush, i think im addicted
[deleted]
Not necessarily. it could mean the guy who was accumulating at $6.5-7.2k was closing his position into the short squeeze.

The ask side was very thin so a short squeeze wasn't hard to pull off. 

He could have: 

Accumulated 15k btc at $6.8k. Pumped the price to $7.5k with only 4k btc knowing a short squeeze would carry it to $8k. Sold his 10000 $6.8k btcs along the way. 


Officially just hedged right now, although considering unhedging and walking away from charts until sub $7k again. May long from $7200-7500. Anything below that and I will believe this was simply a short squeeze to scare overleveraged permabears 

I really, really want to short here but I would need tight stops. I may enter a small short and ease into it in case this is the top of the push. This is beginning to enter no man's land where the case for bear and bull look equally likely for quite a while. 

Logically a bear market seems the most likely but btc has never been particularly logical 
Sorry i wrote that down wrong you're right. Was thinking of the roundness of 40k 
7563
I see, was 28k last I checked!
1 asia pump in 7 days.....on 7 april...

Oh wasn't meant to be a grammar criticism at all, I feel like that didn't come across the way I intended.
>an isolated incident upon which no specific conclusions can be drawn    

that is pretty much the definition of anecdotal
Hindsight is always 20/20, but looking back it's still a bit fuzzy.
Uh, there's zero correlation.
That works until it doesn't. Classic con in horse races. It's called a powder trick.
Updated with the next two dates.
That works until it doesn't. Classic con in horse races.
I mean, you made money, that's always a good thing. But we both could have made more here lol.
I had a sell order fill in the perpetual swaps at $8100 and another at $7900 in the June Futures. I was pleasantly surprised. Limit and Stop Limit orders are my game, because I have limited capital and don't want to get into high leverage, I'd rather place orders and wait for the bigger swings to come, rather than actively work the day to day market. 
Depends on timeframe. I'm firmly back into DCA territory now on long term stack.
The squeeze was caused by those who are equally vehemently interested in actively betting against the asset eg. interested in it's failure, and there was ALOT of this  -- its one and the same when they are liquidated.  It is us humans who decide what to label the same phenomena. Tornado or Twister? Hurricane or Typhoon?
hi black gay libertarian , not the reason stated in your sarcastic response, no.. But i do think the fact that OTC intrest couldnt get filled below 7k anymore was a significant enough factor to move the market.
Well, we don’t know who bought those 34k coins. Could have been one person that kicked it off or multiple people that happened to cause a rally. Alts have been pumping all day and Cardano futures on Mex are insanely liquid right now. They were up 20% earlier today when BTC dumped
Fluffy is that you?
A couple months ago I had a dream that I should stop trading and shorting and just put everything in m0ner0 and hodl. I woke up and thought to myself, hmm, maybe that's more than just another irrational dream - although I didn't quite follow my dream's wisdom.

The negative outlook is that governments will do everything in their power to undermine it and ban it from trading on exchanges.
you spend a lot of time trolling reddit if you're up millions. Must be one sad, sad multi millionaire. Good for you though man! 
Yeah, but the exchanges will definitely have liability. CME issues huge fines and trader bans all the time for spoofing and washing to avoid the CFTC hammer and still gets fined.
any citations?  Not that I'm necessarily skeptical of that statement, but I'm wondering if they specifically meant employees are allowed to trade on the platform, or if the exchange itself is using its own funds to trade.
Just so u know I'm gonna start using the term YOLO stack XD
If it's the same guy I'm thinking of, he would have gotten liquidated (or near liquidated) earlier during that little run to $7.2k.
Hehe, I was thinking the same thing about what would people think when they wake up, and the same about a whale potentially affecting it.  But I was thinking that maybe the increased volume/activity could potentially dampen a whale's effect now, or at least reverse it more quickly, rather than thinking about that ratio.
Yes. I mean you could easily catch the bottom of a wick at 7480, open the short, and then we bounce back to 7600. Or we get rejected off 7800 again and drop down. Often better to take a single position and set tight stops. The fact you were targeting 7800 and 7480 while we're at 7730 makes me think shorting with a stop/flip long at 7800 would appeal to you.

Trading right before bed is usually a bad idea though. Better to sleep well. 
I don't like discussing my financial information publicly. Let's just keep it at "I'm doing fine thank you very much"

Honestly you don't have to take everything so personally. I have no gripe with you, just raining on your overly confident and highly incorrect predictions.

EDIT: also the sheer volume of your posts make it difficult to not comment.
did chewy talk about this? I don't remember seeing it
I did.

Because the alts moving gave me hopium.
I  thought was  strong possibility. Tweeted about it 5 mins before it happened. https://twitter.com/HallaCal/status/984384973120602112
Ah I see, very short timeframe though
Ah, I was looking at the hour chart. Don't see it there but I see it on the 30. Volume profile fits, guess it's worth watching. It's tiny though.
Literally exactly what i see. Will you be adding a short around the top of the right shoulder? 
Well that certainly is a fair point of view to take, the epic squeeze has come and gone and whilst there are of course many shorts still open they are not disproportionate to the amount of longs also open. So I feel as though that avenue to cause a pump is gone, it'll have to be either good old fashioned fomo in that case (or a slow grind up, or down as you alluded to)
Sentiment within crypto subs changes every time bitcoin sneezes. You want to see sentiment shift in the MSM
> I think this is the guy who started getting people to look at metcalfe's law when they model the price of bitcoin against other metrics.


Would not recommend leaving your screen, you might miss a 10000 dollar move
You have to clean the screen not yourself
A retrace to 7k would be a handsome profit for anyone opening up shorts here.
Ok thanks for the advice. It's a 0.2btc (x5) so not that small. Like you said I'll wait and assess, I can take a small loss after the big profit I had from my 7020 long (just wished I didn't close it so soon).

Small question, are you now in BTC or fiat? If the bullish momentum confirms, I see no reason why we would not test high 8k, so considering moving my fiat to BTC. 
why did you close?

I would have kept it open. I just thought it was premature because you could have shorted higher
I think the bears need to take a look in the mirror and just admit to themselves that we didnt dump below 6k, when we had everything needed to do so.

Shorting Bitcoin on a run might be a very bad idea long term
Dang. Well, I guess I should expect that from you. :P
Omg yeah mate, your are a legend now
Now that wasn't hard was it? Rather than call half of the people here fools.

Takes one to know one
If you put value in anyones price prediction, you're doing it wrong. Think for yourself.


Oh, I'm not a newbie btw.
I didn't say it was impossible.  I said "Probably not".
[removed]
Manipulation is part of the game
Are there markets that don't have whales?
I didn’t say it wasn’t manipulated ;)
Oh shit... Imagine
The latter is EXACTLY what I keep telling all my non-crypto friends :)
Agree to disagree. Crypto is tiny \-\- even the huge Forex market is widely known to be relentlessly manipulated. I am on your side that it is annoying when people lean too heavily on the idea of manipulation \- it becomes a scapegoat in a way for things you can't explain or mistakes you've made. But that doesn't mean there aren't manipulators. If you were building a $100MM position, for example, you would absolutely use different strategies than someone who was building a $1M position. But the thing most don't consider is just like regular traders, manipulation strategies have probabilities of success. You can try to manipulate and get burned just like a regular trader. But you look for conditions to be just right to maximize your success given a particular strategy.

It's also impossible to know that it's not just a bunch of whales that in aggregate are behaving similarly and using similar strategies, or if it's one player. Wyckoff referred to this concept as the "Composite Operator" which I think is useful.
found the shorter
It's all over boys time to pack it in. Bitcoin is just a toy. 
Plenty. Just visit your local Whole Foods
I think most people here can afford a cardboard box. Ok I’m sorry
I guarantee chewy is looking at the bullflag off 7K, not the tiny one on the 5m chart.
this meta trading is the most fun part. caring about gains are for noobs
Well, I'm probably lucky that didn't end in disaster. Because it certainly should have. 
Yes, I just wonder when will it stop lol. I see the long term value if it stabilizes, but really we're more liquid than literally ever and we just saw the highest buy volume in the history of btc in 1h. For literally no reason other than "because people were overleveraged" 

Over time you'd think volatility would decrease but here we are, looking at a 17.6% green candle in 1 hour. 
If I didn't know better I would have thought I'd written this. I couldn't agree more. People can't appreciate that just because it's volatile now, doesn't mean it's forever destined to be so.
Yup.  I have lemonade tagged "annoying, and doens't actually understand btc tech"

Btw you're tagged "arbitrage kimchi premium/discount guy" :)
why does it have to *be* anything specific right now?
Peer-to-peer digital cash.
That is my gut as well, which is why I recommended layering 7700-7980. Breaking above 8K again would be pretty bullish IMO, and I would expect it to break through the resistance zone.
I wanted to feel like you for a minute so I slid my leverage on my Sept futures long to 100x. 1600% baby!
Here is when that happened:

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8a6k3w/daily_discussion_friday_april_06_2018/dwwg7if/

Sloppy:

"this is genuinely starting to look like accumulation. Buyers are just being patient af and setting up huge buy walls and not letting it fall through

e: I don't mean A C C U M U L A T I O N with wall street bonuses and chinese new year, I mean it just really looks like buyers are willing to put up massive walls at $6k so it doesn't fall through. Like...ya know, accumulation, lol.

Didn't think this would be so controversial. I just am surprised it hasn't fallen through yet.

I wouldn't be surprised if it fell through still, but this is probably the most "unsure" I have been in it falling through $6k. I am probably overthinking/getting anxious due to a lack of follow through from sellers."
If you had stops @7300 and it wicked and dropped to 6800-6900 you would be pissed, i know its a different thing, paper profits vs real losses, but hurts every time.
Even when we are off position it hurts :D
And there it goes again.
So the 40 minutes this morning and the 40 minutes tonight don't count? Will it count if the daily closes above it? It doesn't seem to be clear what it takes to disprove "important" support and resistance.
Yeah, life's pretty good over here.

:)
Old habits die hard I guess lol.
Kind of feels like the 7.3-9.9 run that stalled at 9.2 for a bit. Might be on last hoorah left in this one. Maybe layer in half here and half later? 

Adding at 6700 and average to 7400 would feel a lot better than being underwater if we peak at 8.6. 

Anyways don't let me bull-fud you. This could very well be another 3 strikes lower local high you're out scenario. 
What do yu mean? Why square one? Do trades, put stop loss 5-10% , you can be wrong 9/10 times and still make profit
No, Bitcoin has periods (on the smaller time scales ie.  <4 hours) of less and greater volatility as well as periods of sporadic movement that TA doesn’t deal too well with. Right now is a dreadful culmination of both haha.
Thanks for the info!
No, you're misunderstanding. I mean the short squeeze is likely an intentional manipulation by big players. The ask side was very thin, a short squeeze was easy and profitable to pull off. 
My gut says that MM's got such a "steal" on the effectiveness of this squeeze that they have plenty of ammo to keep it from dropping. Shorts are (rightfully) scared straight or outright liquidated.

Maybe a little fake out $150 - $200 drop to spook some over leveraged longs into their asks and then onward. I'm throwing a prayer and some limit buys in that range. Not expecting really anything to go my way here.
Really? This is the basis for your shift in outlook? It just got rejected off a strong resistance that's been in place since 11.7k... pretty telegraphed move there. Obviously the downtrend will eventually break down, but until one of these large resistances is properly breached, bullish outlooks are pure hopium IMO
is there any difference, really? 
a 70% "correction" is definitively a bear market. Sorry dude.
Get a clue buddy 
Thanks, interesting to hear your reasoning, seeing as you are much more involved in this type of thing. Happy arbitraging :)
Do you hedge when you're not in a position? 
You have it the wrong way around. Placing stops is gambling that the liquidity stays excellent during the entire time your position is open. Do you know those people that place limit orders 10% from the current price in the hope of catching spikes? The more people use stop losses, the more profitable they are, and it's not hard to figure out where all the profits come from...

Mental stops are a completely different story.
I should probably take a step back and breath. But this volatility is something we haven’t had in a decent amount of time and it’s been working out pretty well. 
and it is just so retarded in that regard. I mean, besides eth, bcash (who the hell buys bcash?) and litecoin most coins need to buy bitcoin before. I know bitfinex can, but very few people are going to register on it if they are not living from crypto trading.
You will see. 
I'm not sure if Okex is settled in Bitcoin, but the guy in the link above bought 34m worth of Bitcoin futures.

A future allows him to "bet" on the price of Bitcoin in the future. If the price goes up, he will profit VAL-34m, where VAL is the value of his portfolio in the future (34m*1.0x, where x is the percentage rise).

But in order to buy the 34m contracts, he could have put less than that in as margin, say 17m. In that case, the 17m in margin are used by Okex to balance their books, should the price drop to 4900 (two-thirds the current price).

If the price drops that low, he will lose the 17m he posted as margin. Of course, he could close his position sooner, and lock in a smaller loss.
That's really impressive if that's the case.
How is a 9% decrease in one hour (finex shorts) not significant?
Thank you 
Yup, the wiki article and all other articles have a hard time calculating net worth of individuals so it defaults to households, most millionaries in the US are millionaries because the value of their house minus their mortgage is sufficient to push them into two comma territory. 
ALL OF IT, 5x leverage.  I'll be holding the short all the way down to 4k.
I put my money on it with a leveraged short back at 12k. (edit for typo)
because it's BTC settled 1xlong is effectively 2x long so you still get a liquidation price (I believe it's 50% drop I could be wrong). You can hedge your shorts 1x without a chance of liquidation though I think and collect funding in bull runs until you get a major retrace but it's not quite as easy as it sounds,your competing with a lot of bots trying to do the same thing which is why you routinely see pumps and dumps at the funding period ends and also why a high funding rate can actually be used as an overbought/oversold indicator due to the way the funding is calculated. so even though the funding rate may look juicy especially in this type of market when it changes direction/breaks out it tends to be hard making your R/R not great unless you can get a real good entry and a little bit of luck.
There is a liquidation price on 1x long on bitmex because BTC is the collateral so your leveraging 1 bitcoin to buy another bitcoin so you still get a liquidation price, it's low but it's there on 1x longs. There isn't a short liquidation price IIRC because it's the equivalent of going to USD. So there is a risk of losing money or getting liquidated if you went long here and we fell to 3K for example and your returns on your funding doesn't breakeven because we're going down quicker so then your forced to watch as you get liquidated hoping for a bounce or closing your position with pretty large losses for minimal gains (dont forget the funding will turn against you as well when the mark price deviates too much from the index price in the opposite direction then you gotta wait to see if you can breakeven).You can try jumping on a 1X position and collect the funding and closing the position straight away but your competing with bots. IIRC mex hit 50K in December, I'm sure their engine would have liquidated shorts or de-leveraged shorts if something like that happened even though the index price didn't hit their liquidation(I believe this is how mex works anyway).

Any how to guide on how to short? I prefer going long rigth now, but for the future, just in case :-)
You do this but with arbitrary prices. 

https://www.shmoop.com/derivatives/slope-function.html

I know it isn't a derivative. But it's an easy way to explain it.

buy high sell low can't lose
Wish I was kidding. 
And the entire world starting to crack down on crypto is making 2018 different.
Moves to %ATH. 

$17.2k DCB, double top at $12k, dump to $6k, consolidation around $7-7.5k. all of those happened in 2014 with its respective % of ATH. 
God how I wish I had been accumulating at the $1 milestone.
lol, you've not seen me the past few weeks? Check my post history. I know his style, and I know he's turned short term bullish. 
lmao, within 2 minutes of posting that it bounces +$150
Closed and re opened. Lost a bit of movement due to a confluence of stupid shit factors. Closing here above another push past $7850. 

It was 5 am, my internet was down so I was on mobile. I kept hitting bitmex "close" instead of "market" and was so panicked and exhausted I didn't realize I was setting a limit order at $7.4k lol. The tiny ass UI didn't show "market" on my screen either. it was kind of like that guy who jumped out of a plane and expected his parachute pull to be on his right shoulder. it was on his left one for some reason, fully intact and functional. They found his body with his right shoulder bloodied and scratched up because he panicked and attempted to pull it the entire way down. 

I really should have set stops at ~$7350, would be in  much better position.

But yes, I'm about done with this short, trying to exit on a small pullback but could've missed my chance. 

I'm not interested in shorting this to the bottom as much as I was before unless it just happens to fall through here. 

Part of this is that I'm not really interested in trading this market anymore, not so much due to anything other than simply being exhausted from it. I got lazy and stopped watching charts nearly as much the past few weeks and I enjoyed my life a lot more. I kind of want to take most of my money out of btc and just live my life again. 

I do think long term we're in for a bearish market still, as none of this is really indicative of a recovery yet (2/3 of some of the largest buying pressure in the history of btc is literally just shorts closing) but we could see some serious upside first.

I'll have to reevaluate over the next few days to see.

Main reason I'm bearish long term (although possibly bullish medium term like possibly weeks to months) is because the perception that there is actual growth and adoption going on is going to slowly dissipate as people realize the market is controlled by a few large players who move it with ease. This won't stop people from trading it until they're thoroughly chopped up and liquidated, though. 

Like I said, most of this was shorts closing. in an hour...most ever traded in btcs history of what that guy said is right. What kind of 1h 15% pump stops dead in its tracks? 

All of this is fucked up and I'm realizing I have less and less interest in it than I used to. I had a good feeling I'd be done trading after this short so we'll see what happens.

If btc holds above $7.3k I will buy and hold, unleveraged, probably with stops below either $6900 or $5800 but besides that I will do my best probably to not even pay attention to charts. 

It's very possibly "legit" buying pressure comes back and it's not just traders and MMs squeezing shorts, but until then I'm still bearish longer term
Sorry to hear about your long man. I'm fortunate to have closed my 6850 June futures short at breakeven but was tempted to long perps at 6.8 and decided against it. We all make mistakes. 
Bitcoin is a decentralized currency that can't be controlled by anyone. THAT is what we are speculating on, whether something like that is useful or not. That is what the early adopters and the ones who stay want out of Bitcoin. It "mooning" is just confirmation that others agree that this is useful and valuable. Other people who dumped in their money because they thought it was a get rich quick scheme without even knowing what bitcoin is is their fault. And in due time people will learn what bitcoin is and realize it's advantages, and will learn to use it just as all of us have learned how to use a computer, hook up the internet, and prospered from a global economy.
great! exactly what i was looking for
Stupid question: if this whale (assuming it is one whale) removes his funding, will the short lending rates skyrocket ?
Your going to get burned
same here - remember to enjoy the present too :) 

(saying this to myself mostly lol)
[https://imgur.com/a/7WNv1](https://imgur.com/a/7WNv1)
That's been the most profitable strategy for me.  Although I've made a strict rule of only shorting during the bear market bc it's too easy to get burned by longs rn so I didn't enter long.  Of course I wish I did now lol
we will see 7k.
What could go wrong with a pocket-change 500$?
Never was! Just same group of hacks pretending they are god and know everything.  Issue is we simply went into the clouds.. coming back down is not a 'bear' its a correction. We were up so high that obviously it's going to take a long time to resume.  Might even go one dip down yet before we level and then resume.
Zoom out
flip the screen
which big overall picture are you looking at?
Seems about right, if we don't hold that range, this will not end well. 

I am thinking of flipping alt roulette winnings into btc and taking a bit in profit, but I am too undecided how this plays out. It's good to be green right now! 
You opened a fresh hedge or still holding? 
I better put a buy at 7560, then. These whale games are brutal.
Lol
> grammar

you mean semantics :P

no worries, I didn't take it negatively at all bud, and for the record, if I'm using any word improperly, I'd much rather have it brought to my attention on reddit than in front of *real* people lol
It it? I thought so too, but it turns out anecdotal refers to an event or fact that was obtained second-hand, if that makes sense.

Anecdotal: (of an account) not necessarily true or reliable, because based on personal accounts rather than facts or research.
Thank you. The GOAT speaks.
probably less of it was interest in failure, and rather, more like "revenge shorting to make up for early 2018 losses."  JMO.
What's breakout line at on the decline from December?

Was at 12 a month ago. Where's it now?
[deleted]
Again, only US exchanges.

Your laws stop at your borders.
Sounds good!
I really like you

As I said before the rise, a move above 7k after the drop this morning would make me short term bullish and that's what I am now. 

I was wrong, but I don't recall you predicting 8.1 recently either. 
He took an early long at 6900 several hours ago. Great move. 
It's weird that on the way up, alt movements would precede btc, but on the way down, btc would fall first.
Nice call man. 
Agreed i'm not so sure how it will play out but I'm defs keeping an eye on it
Im currently long for a scalp to the top of the right shoulder then will probably add me short there if it cant break through resistance.
Yeah there has been a lot of good news as of late for bitcoin and crypto in general yet before this pump, buying volume was back to pre Dec 2017 numbers (at least on GDAX) so it's concerning that there is no follow up FOMO ing from the masses. Instead I see pros on here back to shorting. Not looking good IMO. 
It was a shot gun spit with massive kick back. Lucky I dont need a backeotomy. 
If we got to 7k I'd get too greedy to close tbh. 
I'm fully in BTC (and BCH, ETH, ADA). Despite my bearishness I still only trade to accumulate BTC just in case this shit pops off to dizzying heights (although I remain very skeptical of bitcoins long term prospects). 
Bro I would love to have opened at 8.1. Timing is everything and my timing was off. 

Waking up at 4am and setting a breakeven stop on my previous short was a lifesaver though. 
Oof tried to warn y'all 
No? But there are markets where whales stop shitting around once in awhile?
Well then that’s what i’m referring to. Let’s be real, those multiple 30-75 btc sell walls arent there to be moved. They’re there as a psychological barrier. 
Yessssssssssssssss the "composite operator" concept is perfect. That's what I mean by the market. Building a position is surely done differently depending on the holdings and and scale of a participant, but they will never win against the composite operator. 

The suggestion of rapid buying to cheat a move up would imply they would need to quickly dump as they're against the operator, and thus is unsustainable. 

Being with would mean the rest of the market is also working in your favour. The smartest thing would be to try and buy as much for as little as possible

I might say the accumulation for this pop started on the 29th, and the squeeze on the third. The bears tried to distribute and the bulls accumulate until there were no bears left. i might also say this accumulation was a continuation of the one which built the uptrend which brought price to the ath.

The composite operator accumulates, but he must then  also distribute. There is only so much he can buy, and so many people left to sell to. Price is ruled by this game of liquidity; and it's mathematical in nature.

I'm half asleep so i apologise if anything is exceptionally incomprehensible.
Nope, crop prices are heavily influenced by the government... Try again? 
My box needs a new roof, so let's go honeybadger. 
I don't think he understands much of anything including how any market works, so you could see why BTC is hard for him to understand. 

And yeah, i'm the Kimchi guy. It hasn't failed me too badly yet! Happy trading! 
Yeah I don’t understand BTC because some neckbeard here said so.

Back in the real world, I’ve unloaded over a thousand coins over the past few months and still hold more than most people here. Let’s laugh at me and my millions for not understanding bitcoin. We’re so stupid, lol!

I want to sincerely thank people in here for holding my bags. Please look after them really well, I will be back to take them off your hands when you panic sell them to me at 3k.
because at some point it has to *be* something. It's been 9 years and we're still seeing 20% 1h candles. Idk youd just think it'd have calmed down by now. 
It’s peer to peer digital cash when fees are low and nobody is using it. And it’s digital gold when it’s pumping and fees are $30+
Hahaha I eased into my 55x. It started at 10x, quickly went to 20x, then 40x at around $10950. Then 50x at $9800. 

I hope you're kidding, or do you mean you did that earlier? Because damn! 
Fuck me I'm a genius but a stubborn idiot as well. 

I literally said "someone's accumulating and planning on pumping it to $8-10k"

😭

"If it doesn't fall through within like a day or two I'm just gonna close my short and wait until $6k breaks" 

Why? Why don't I listen to myself lmao 
How do you find this stuff so quickly btw lol 
Think of it like the resistance at 9k on our last rise. We did go over it a couple times, but people still remember it as the "resistance at 9k." We need to convincingly break it, not touch the zone and crash downwards. 
Haha yep. Would be surprised if there isn't a pullback but not that surprised...
Oh yes but I wouldn't hold out that long. I'm closing at or before $8100. 

it's very possible the market sobers up here soon (the timing! someone dumped 500 coins as I wrote this out)
Loose on 9 trades and win on trade number 10 to offset your previous loses (+ some change)? While Mr Hodler just held, slept peacefully instead of sleeping with one eye open and panicking everytime a price alert goes off.

I know this a trading sub and props to those of you who roll the dice. But what i saw on Bitmex today made me puke. Real people lost real money. Sad.
In my opinion entering at 6930 and having a stop at 7k will always be too tight for bitcoin, especially if you are going to sleep on it...
> The ask side was very thin, a short squeeze was easy

We're both arguing the same thing but with different conclusions.  We both think that there was an easy predictable setup for a short squeeze.  My conclusion is that it's no surprise that a short squeeze happened.  Your conclusion is that it's a huge surprise and impossible without a single entity controlling the price.
The ask was very thick actually, but it was thin compared to the amount of open shorts.  I didn't really see a big market buy to kick this off.  I think it was just the natural result of too many shorts at too low a price for the demand right now.
This comment aged very poorly
>Do you hedge when you're not in a position? 

Are you asking if I hedge my cold storage etc? Normally, yes. However, I earned over 80 coins so far this month trading, which I have not yet hedged. I'm vulnerable to price fluctuations there. 
Placing bad stops will get you hunted down, I agree. But for every trade, I ask myself the following questions:

1) What formation do I trade? (triangles, flags, channels etc.)

2) Where is the assumption of the formation that I see no longer valid?

3) What is the target for the position were the assumption correct?

Then, give the stops some room not to get hunted, which will play into position sizing and r/r of the trade. Of course, if the price bounces from 3000 three times and you set a stop at 3020, don't make your r/r calculation with a perfect execution at 3020.

Also, know your exchange and the liquidity it provides – of course, if you trade on an exchange with shit liquidity even for retail investors, stops may lead to greater losses than mental stops.
Just be careful, if you're new to trading, it's very easy to screw up once you go on a loss streak. It's better to lose earlier than later so just prepare for it. You gotta learn how to lose before you can really get your head in the game 

Not trying to scare you but it's a reality, and if you haven't lost yet, you don't know how poorly you're going to handle it. Always enter a trade prepared to lose

But great job.. Smart trades 
> If the price drops that low, he will lose the 17m he posted as margin. Of course, he could close his position sooner, and lock in a smaller loss.

Honestly when you have that much dry powder, why go anywhere near a forced liquidation. Sure opportunity cost of having it sitting in "cash", but meh. Probably feels safe with that much headroom and a plan to close earlier. Unless it's "unliquidatable" and super long-term. Oh futures... yeah well gotta be closed sooner or later.
longs closed by more han that. ratio is still in favor of longs
i'm inversing you -- 85k long (5x) at 7810.
let's see what happens.

Ahhhh, ok. cool
What is the crackdown?  
Actually that makes it more similar to 2014. 
yeah, this time I got a bit lucky even though today has still been a bad day for me; I did not expect Bitcoin could just go up 1k in 30 minutes :/
Right there with ya. I’m not really interested in making bets on a random number generator or meta-bets on the actions of gamblers. None of my usual indicators/strategies work for shit at this point. I guess this is getting shaken out? I don’t know. I’ve actually been quite impressed at how well some people on here have done in this chop. 
I hear you. I am debating just going 1x long with anything <7K with 50% of the stack and a 1x add at 4K with the rest and walking away for a while. I've actually got my 10x long open from 6410 still, although it's a small position, so I could convert that. It's on Sept futs, too. 
Live and learn, today i "lost" 100$ (i'm trading pocket changes compared to most guys here) but the same mistake a month ago saved me from losing 50$.
Lets hope it really is a reversal so everyone can start making money again :)
I've changed from Bearish to Neutral until 7200 breaks, turning Bullish after 8500 (always with tight stops, as Bitcoin is a temperamental lover)
Yep he did last week. Went to like 0.7 iirc
zoom even more
it just looks so bullish now
Hedge from $7700. Tried to short but  got stopped out. Increasingly itching  to short the higher this climbs because I think it'll get rejected from $8k before moving up to $8.5k again
For real, though, the chart truly looks like it is breaking upwards, but the 15m macd has been negative for 5 hours and shorts have stopped closing. atm it feels like this second wick upwards was the rise before the drop. Although the rise did catch my "stop buys" above ~~7100~~ 7700 so I am currently long with you by default.
"based on personal observation, case study reports, or random investigations rather than systematic scientific evaluation:
anecdotal evidence.
"    

this is how I see it; I guess there a varying definitions
like 9500ish

9100 on some charts

log-line
Yeah you got me! My bags from January 2017, yep. Oh wow, vacation! How could us plebs ever afford such a thing with all these bags? 
Thanks, I guess :-)
I don't think this is indicative of the tendency in the future.
Thank you
This could play out really really nice. Rejected at top of shoulder just waiting for candle to close. Opened a small short at 7913 
Agreed. The lightning flop is kinda hilarious to watch, but in a sad kinda way.
Fair enough, you called it (originally in a low-brow fashion).
Let's see where this goes though... Need some actual buyers to step in now, can't rely on short squeeze being the only bullish mechanism
Where?
I'm referring to the super-market. Plenty of organic options there.
You have an unhealthy obsession with me.
To confirm, you are worth millions but come on a trading sub to ridicule and argue with people over the internet? 
Well congratulations on having a huge trader dick.

The "annoying" part of my tag is clearly as relevant as ever ;P

[This is the thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/899akt/daily_discussion_tuesday_april_03_2018/dwqmbcd/) that earned you the second part of your tag btw, when you tried to cover your misunderstanding by splitting the wrong hairs.
it already *is* something, it's BTC and it's totally unprecedented 

edit: to be clear, I know exactly what you're saying
This is painfully true.
I wasn't kidding, but I immediately put it back to 10x. I just wanted to see it :P

That's crazy, man. I didn't realize you were 55x.
name one genius that ain't crazy :P
honestly, I have a photographic memory when it comes to interesting shit, I must have found that comment interesting lol
Yeah, resistance around 7.8 - 8.2 makes sense. It's a huge range, but it makes sense. 7.8 is the number that seems strange, though. Saying that breaking clear through and out of 8k - 8.5k would be a more sensible statement after this morning. 
Same, I have no idea what's happening. All my common sense says that we should slightly go down but a part of me wants to say that we'll go back above 8,000 tonight.



Whatever, I'm not gonna open a position. I had a long that I had left open overnight from 6900, I was anxious keeping it open but luckily it worked out. 
Did you close? 
>Lose on 9 trades and win on trade number 10 to offset your previous loses (+ some change)? While Mr Hodler just held, slept peacefully instead of sleeping with one eye open and panicking at everytime a price alert goes off.

It was an example, now imagine you have a 40 or 60% hit rate...






>But what i saw on Bitmex today made me puke. Real people lost real money. Now imagine how they feel?

Yeah I forgot the part when someone put a pistol to their head and forced them to trade on the most dangerous and newbie unfriendly marketplace ever on a high risk volatile asset
Oh yes very true haha, $70 swings happen in single minute candles here all he time
Eh yeah basically arguing the same thing. I basically mean Wyckoff's composite man anyway 
Was it thick? compared to bid side? Because I remember it looking relatively thin. I guess yes at the least it was thin compared to open shorts
Yea, I figure you had a certain amount of bitmex and was wondering if you generally hedge it when you're not in a position.

Any reason you don't hedge? 
lol isn't it funny that the trollbox is flawless?

Did you close your other short or are you leaving that open with your hedge?

oh sorry if you didn't want me to see that. 
Maybe this is a stupid question, but why not just sell part of the cold storage? Isn't that cheaper (e.g. fees) than hedging?
How much room do you have to give your stops such that they can't get hunted? In this situation, 20% off the current price clearly wasn't enough.

The entire idea that you can use a stop loss without falling victim of 'hunting' just doesn't make any sense.
Ties into gambling. Luckily I’ve lost more money than I’ve won recently in a casino that I’ve been going to recently. Lesson learned there 
for some, that's play money.
Whale ahoy!
closed at 7950 and opened a short for the bounce. 
i'd be careful holding that short for too long /u/mikeyvegas17 
Maybe he means governments  taxing it and regulating it like other assets 🤷‍♂️
Yup, I don't even care if I'm getting shaken out, these 1h candles are ridiculous for leveraged positions. It was fun while it lasted but I need to focus on work and getting back in the gym. BTC is unhealthy for me in several ways.

part of it is BTC tends to make its largest moves when I'm about to sleep or in the middle of sleeping. It's actually had quite the effect on my sleep schedule over the past few months and I'm just finding that no amount of money is worth feeling so exhausted. I was significantly happier before I invested in btc. 

Truth is I'll probably stick around, but I'm reconsidering how I trade and leverage and what kind of positions I want to take and how much money I expect to make out of a bear market. 

If this is the reversal then I'm just buying  and holding. possibly done trading and I'll check the charts every few days, then every few weeks, months, etc, but we'll see. 

22loops said that true despair will hit *all* of us, not just bulls...And I think that's possibly what's happening. We'll see I guess 
Fractals man! 
now u can up the hopium dose and trade accordingly
thanks, like you said I think colloquially the meaning has changed somewhat to describe a single input as opposed to a compendium
That's around what I thought, thanks.

Indeed its looking good so far
I think we called it
Bro, I'm so skeptical of lightning. Just raise the block size ffs
Oh, good time to trade in some more BTC for BCH? ☺️
When they decide to take down a 74 btc wall at $6747.74 after having the order up for 10 seconds and go away for the next hour just as a minor example, why do u ask?

No. You are just by far the most annoying poster on this forum. I guess that's a win for you, but all you ever do is shit on BTC and everyone when it goes down and scream 'I told you so it's a scam!' Then when it goes up you get into hysterics, hopefully the mods will do something because frankly for a multi millionaire your insight is absolutely one of a screaming child. All i ever hear from you is 'reeee' in one way or another. 
Yes.
Yeah I thought it was from that thread and I was mostly saying those things just for fun to get a reaction but I mean if you're going to talk about immutability, make it clear that you mean it in a programming context and not the literal meaning of the word. Not everyone has a computer science background, that doesn't mean they don't understand bitcoin. In terms of economics I probably understand it better than most but in terms of programming, a lot of people here understand it better than me.

Anyway the point I was trying to make in that thread stands, bitcoin is not immutable in the general sense because it can be changed. Yes, it might be difficult to change and is more immutable than a spreadsheet, but it can be done and has been done in the past - both the ledger and the parameters. I guarantee you if a catastrophic enough event occurs (for example a hacker steals every single coin tomorrow) the ledger will be rolled back and there will be social consensus for it. A system that can be changed by the participants cannot be immutable.

Even the most important parameters can be changed; I can't be certain that there will still only be a maximum of 21 million coins in 100+ years. Literally all that needs to be done is to change the number 21 to another number. The incentives don't exist for that today, but maybe in the future they will.
I know what you're saying as well. And there is something amazing about it still being a thing after all these years of turbulence, hacks, manipulation, government bans etc. 

But I just really want to see it become an actual useful thing, that's all. 
Hahahaha. That's funny. And yes, it was truly a ridiculous trade. it was actually partially a revenge trade. The entry was objective and based on analysis but the position size was purely emotional tbh. I read a quote saying "the time to be greedy is at the start of a move, not the end.". 

I saw the downside could be $6k so I said fuck it, I'll short anything above $10k with stupid high leverage. and I wanted my money back (losses from shorting from $10k)
no I'm still terrible at this shit I forgot how much I hate trading on short time frames, I have such poor discipline. it's hovering right near my "stop" still tho 
that shit was painful. I should've added more at $8150 -_- 

I'm probably closing here soon if it makes any attempt at $7950 again and doesn't swiftly dump below $7800 

not really planning on holding this one out again 
You are right that the bid was even thicker... but both sides were thicker than normal on the combined orderbooks and key exchanges.
If you were short, you probably entered that either above 8.3k, or with the assumption that the falling wedge will provide resistance again. I'm going to assume the latter. In this case, a stop above 6980 or 7010 would have had a low chance of getting hunted without triggering the short squeeze cascade we've seen. Not every trade that is closed at a loss is a stop that got hunted, if the price reached 7010 and I was betting on the wedge holding, I'd want to close the trade asap.

The key to not getting hunted is to put the stops at places where you are convinced that if the price reaches that level, it will continue to go on, or at least your initial hypothesis is invalid. If that leads to a streak of losses, your strategy is just bad. Been there, done that.
Everyone says trading is gambling but you at least have an edge in trading! 
>Yup, I don't even care if I'm getting shaken out, these 1h candles are ridiculous for leveraged positions. It was fun while it lasted but I need to focus on work and getting back in the gym. BTC is unhealthy for me in several ways.

Had the same realization a month or so ago and it's had a very positive impact on all aspects of my life. It's really \*nice\* to think about other things for a change. I think part of it is I have an obsessive personality, so it's hard to set boundaries with things like trading.
Me too, buddy. Take care of yourself. 
This market has also been pretty challenging for me, because I am realizing that I am probably too risk adverse to participate in a manner that's going to make me the significant returns others are pulling off. 

I've noticed the damage to my sleep schedule, even if it's been getting a little better. Still, something woke up at 5 AM EST today and I *almost* FOMO'd into Chewy's great move, but didn't, and now I will sit and let my mindfulness be sabotaged by the chart of what I'm not bought in to.

Sucks because I have such a small (for this sub) overall profit target where I honestly think I could walk away.




Sloppy we had our day but it won't be the last. Fundamentally speaking this shit ain't even worth $3000. Look to short the log resistance line again. 
it's actually the original meaning derived from the word "anecdote":     
 
"An anecdote is a brief, revealing account of an individual person or an incident."      

  

PST hasn't even started yet.
It’s painted perfectly. Now it just had to break the 7800 bottom of the neckline to completely confirm. 

Did you open a short? Good call mate 
This didn't age well for you. 

Welcome to Bitcoin.
Okay fair enough, I’ll tone it down.
Sorry for triggering you man!
Bears are die? What a weakass dump so far
The exact strategy you are recommending failed spectacularly in this situation. If the price on bitmex drops to 7010 while the rest of the exchanges don't move, would you close your position immediately? No, of course not. Then why are you recommending that practice? A stop loss doesn't have the information to decide whether it's a flash crash or not.


Maybe you should crunch some number regarding stop losses. I have (some time ago) and as far as I can remember the numbers are not pretty. Being at the opposite side of a stop loss is often a much better choice.
So that's where you've been! I'm really glad you have been taking a break. I'm envious. 

I get incredibly obsessive as well, as I'm sure anyone who spends any amount of time here could tell you.

Although my obsessions tend to last about 3-6 months and...times almost up, lol.

I haven't been to the gym in a few months due to a wrist injury and last night I really just missed going. 

Same with just being able to relax without having a chart to check up on. 


Hope all is well with you and wish you the best. glad you're getting a break from btc. 
Thanks man, I appreciate that, you too. 
Yes, this whole crypto thing is for extremely high risk millenials and older people who stake 3-5% of their net worth in hopes of getting rich off of it. 

I'm mainly just overleveraged. It'd be a lot more fun if I didn't have nearly as much money in the space. 

Take care of yourself, mate. Don't get down about it, it's hard to predict these kinds of moves.. Pretty much have to be vigilant like chewy, always preparing for the big one. 
Yeah, it'll be a hard one to pull the trigger on if the time comes but the r/r is there. Tight stops + switch to long on a breakout shoukd ensure maximum gains.

For now I have to support my grandma, she got rekt shorting. 
oh minutia, how my pedantic ass loves thee 
Closed my long at 7890 and opened up short at 7870. Would of liked a higher entry but it was too hard placing a market-maker order on shitmex.
what do you mean? my wish was granted. I had a feeling you misunderstood my initial comment and this seems to confirm it. Sorry dude
This is why I don't post anything of value here. I post a reasonable reply and that's the response I get.

this tends to happen when we run up lately...

honestly I don't see it as particularly bullish (long term), a slower climb is much better imo. This kind of movement allows the weak hands to hold and they all panic sell as soon as it does the spectacular dumping. the reason bull runs happen is because they start slow and steady, with strong/smart hands buying. they won't sell for a long time. people trying to catch the bottom are looking for quick profits and will sell as soon as their profits are threatened in any way. 

if we revisit $7.3k-$7.5k before heading to $8.5k I'd be extremely comfortable longing, but as of right now this just looks like a short squeeze and people who sold at the bottom panic buying because they're afraid it'll never go down again

$7800 holding would be bullish for sure, but it makes it look artificial/more like the other pump n dumps we've seen. But I mean we could always just go parabolic and forget about sellers for a while
Looool, sorry for roasting your grandma earlier. Tell her I'm not the MM responsible for this. I promise. 
Is your observation that there's manipulation, or that there's whales? I'm trying to figure out if you're conflating the terms.
Im not so sure honestly, i guess it depends how long we stay above 7.8. If we swing around here for a few days and the shorts pile on then ill go long anticipating another squeeze. 
She closed and longed at $8050, truly an idiot. 
yea I'm just not seeing shorts open, which is why this whole thing is curious. and by long term I mean I don't think we'd pass $12k, I don't mean we wouldn't get close. 

the A&E everyone wants needs to play out lke..ya know...an adam and eve. a straight run to $12k isn't an "eve", it's an "adam"
