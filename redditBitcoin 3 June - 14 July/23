Daily Discussion, June 22, 2018 -- TITLE
Look at the bright side, it can't keep crashing for much lower. With the current movement, 6 months tops and we are at 0, at it can't go below that. 
When will the chinese new year end?
“I’m just in it for the technology”
On the bright side, I finally have an answer to the question “what’s the worst financial decision you’ve ever made?”
I remember jizzing in my pants because BTC hit $5k last year.  Now I'm all pissed off.  Crypto is a funny game.
#This will be the last time you'll ever see BTC below $6k.

lol
on the bright side, we get to watch McAfee eat his dick
Shit's fucked guys
Forget ATH. I will be just happy to see Vegeta again.
[MT. GOX trustee won't dump any more bitcoin](http://bitcoinist.com/mt-gox-bitcoin-whale-trustee-wont-sell-btc/)

This is so depressing. This year Bitcoin has just been one slow Hindenburg disaster. 
who's buying at these levels? who's selling at these levels? lol
[deleted]
This is ridiculous. Week gains are lost within 6 hours. And it doesn't even reach the previous high, it's going more and more down.
Its dead. Im not selling cuz its a lottery for me now incase it goes up. But man is this ride over. Performing like hot garbage and trash trading volume. Sure if it goes up ill be happy but this trash is fucking dead for now. I dont give a fuck about the tech i just want some new retards to come and make the price go up. Fuck all this bullshit. I just wanna get rich quick.
I hate going to sleep anymore. Really 
What a strong support 6k was, it took at least 25 seconds to break it /s
What's the opposite of Moon?
Is there a chart that shows the average cost to mine a single bitcoin? Also, at what BTC price will a mining farm loose money? What would happen to the mining community if BTC was to fall to 2000? 
here's some positive fundamental news for a change:

you don't have to worry about tax loss selling in December

you're welcome!
we did it boys. back above $6k. to the MOON now
This should call for an interesting weekend
With each new dip, it's starting to look like maybe interest in Bitcoin is starting to fade.

Especially since the number of people actually using Bitcoin for retail purchases has flatlined. Usage has gone down (number of confirmed transactions). We've just hit one the lowest usage points. 
Short. Every. Rally. 
The time is about now.  Mt Gox is NOT selling coins, will return coins to the owners, not fiat.  FUD is at its peak. Way to much infrastructure in place for the future.  SEC declares Bitcoin Currency not a security.  Nasdaq launching, etfs coming.  Hash rate at its highest and rapidly growing.  Weak hands are flushed as was the intent of the market.   The reversal of the Mt Gox selling is the removal of a huge overhang.  So a few of the Japanese exchanges were ordered to clean up their act.  Hey it is legal currency in Japan, they should clean up their act.  Coinbase has its high roller index fund, responsible holding facilities are in place for institutions.  Yeah now is about the time.  And removing the Mt Gox overhang takes away the shorts cover.  Today is an inflection point.
Shits about to hit the fan.
there goes 6000
This is the first time since I started following Bitcoin, see it below 6k, it’s a scary feeling 
It’s over 5000!!
5k by Monday 😂 
If you listen close enough you can hear the sounds of miners slowly turning off all their machines.
I rarely post but what part of “Tether and market manipulation drove the spike late 2017/early 2018” do people here not understand?   There are no patterns in an unregulated scam filled marketplace.  Only manipulators and bagholders. Which are you?
HODL - Holding On Despite Logic.
Pumpity-dumpity-pumpity-dumpity.
wow woke up to 6300
Idk I feel like telling an exchange to step up security protocols is a good thing, but a massive sell off because the current steps at an exchange to protect your funds aren't sufficient is dumb to me. On the flip side I understand wanting to get your money off those exchanges if you're a doing nefarious things.... I feel like 75% of the time you just watch cryptopanic and that will tell what the market is at.... so damn news driven.
The BIS report was an obvious attempt to discredit Bitcoin and manipulate public perception. If that report combined with hacking of exchange is able to drive price down, then I guess the world is not ready to stop letting them have the control. Sometimes it seems like people want to be brainwashed because it's easier than thinking for themselves.
When you zoom out on the chart it looks like a text book bubble bursting. The only question that remains is will there be a return to the mean or will it just fade away...
last dip b4 bullrun?
[deleted]
Volume picking up nicely
6k crossing witnessed.
Just eating that 6k wall apart in seconds
Aaaaaaaaaaaaand goodbye 6k
What a great day!
wow under 6k
/r/bitcoin right now..

Gather up the troops we gonna hold here people.  Hold on to your butts.
I wonder what the demographic is of Hodlers 
They can crash it as low as they want with these apparent wash trades - I'm not selling.  Fuck 'em.

I'm tired of these assholes after 5 years.

Edit:  You nearly need to give a DNA sample to use an exchange so, the exchanges know exactly who is responsible.

All that's needed is a govt. inquiry depending on the location of the exchange and parties responsible are fucked.

...unless it's the banks and/or govt. doing it...
I want off Mr. Crypto's wild ride. He promised me moon and lambos and all he keeps bringing are dips :(
Just bought my first bitcoin. Fuck it. I'm putting 5% of all my income into bitcoin until 2020. Will revisit then. Maybe I missed the boat and it's all downhill. My 5% is money I'd happily lose to avoid FOMO. This whole wave is a lot of fun and it will be cool to say I was a part of it. Fuck you to the smug naysayers. I'm sure there were plenty like you throughout the last 6 years or so
My cash is ready for the bottom
Let all the Fudsters have their time.  Ppl who kick others while their down get theirs threefold. 
Wall street bonuses coming to Bitcoin aaaaaany day now....
Whoever is dumping right now.. i want you to take a few steps back and FUCK YOUR OWN FACE! Asshole
i bought the 6600 dip! oh well. ill buy the next dip :) still accumulating..
**Come on Bears, this is your day!**
**Last chance to buy Bitcoin above 6k**
What you guys seeing is a bubble popping. 
[removed]
Call me crazy, but beefing up Blockchain security and proposing some logical common sense regulation seems awfully normal and positive to me ... yet... this!
Step 1 - Accumulate

Step 2 - Hodl

Step 3 - Nirvana
I can’t believe how low it’s getting I’m so glad I got out when it was around $11,000. 
Bitcoin has never let me down.  It is full of surprises.

**The worst thing I ever did was sell 0.6 BTC due to FUD.**

I am still up 1000% on my original purchase a few years back.  Call that a collapse?  It certainly isn't for me FUDDERS :)

Show me 1000% Fudders :)

You've simply got to trust the nascent technology.



what is the FUD today? 
early adopters they said
more like greater fools
Just broke $6k on GDAX
[deleted]
This is gentlemen.
What was the intraday low for bitcoin back in Feb? $5.8k or something like that?
Moon
if you're trading i can imagine many of you have one thought. will that daily candle wick...

if you're hodling how much money have you thrown at the screen today?

anyone going in large or just $100 nibbz ?

buy wall at 5800-6k is massive right now
we need more cow bell 
aww it's gonna get played by the biggies while the chickens run around with their heads cut off.  Lets bring it to 10 bucks agains i can buy 10000 real fast and go to sleep!!
So no double bottom.
As a South African with government consistantly making wrong descisions (if you think buying at  19k is bad...) I WISH I could use bitcoin to hedge against my own currency and to be flexible to get the fuck out. But I can't. Instead I just fill up my tax free benefits and look at conventional global exposure market vehicles like a duche. Maybe I should buy some gold...

(I've never owned bitcoin but I work in tech and might do some business with blockhain guys and I've followed the price for years for some sick reason)
rớt như tụt quần
Good for Bitcoin.
BTC is the true bitconnect?

see you at $5k
I keep buying large amounts of BTC every time it gets around the $6,000-$6,200 range. I keep accumulating because I know where the blockchain technology is going :).
With the news of the MTGox bankruptcy win found [here](https://mtgox-creditors.com/author/mtgoxcreditor/) Should we be seeing ALOT of bitcoin changing hands? It sounds like the creditors want bitcoin and not fiat. Which is good for all of us since the Trustee won't be dumping on the market.  
Seriously though, wtf is this happening? Does any one human have a truthful answer as to why this crashes so hard and so fast? Is this how it ends?
This is quite exciting.. 
So glad I sold before I went in the red! (at $7800). And didn't listen to people who said to hang on to it.

Now I just bought back in at $6005. If it goes up, it's all green for me. If it goes down, I'll buy a little more at $5k. You gotta know when to pull out, and when to cut your losses, so you can get back in the game stronger.

Daily Hopium:

Just another blast from the past (4 years ago).  It's amazing that you can pick any of these comments from the bitcoin crash four years ago and it sounds like it could be posted today.

My prediction is we won't see 6.5k again 
Damn you supply and demand! Stop manipulating the markets!!! If only demand went up and supply didn't increase in a corresponding manner, then the price would surely go up!
is this all you got? muahahahaha
bulls are back boiz
I'll tell my kids about how bitcoin used to be over $6k a coin
By December it will be 800.

History keeps repeating yet fools keep disbelieving. 

HODL. 
Ppl really believe this is over...   we’re universal... we’re the real life apocalyptic currency.  We capture everything with code down to the smile on your face when you completed it.  

This isn’t over. 
Shit show, indeed.
What a nice bull run !    
/s
There’s a problem if people are only buying and selling bitcoin. 
Does anyone ever have the thought/Premise; if the whales or powers that be or whatever you want to call those that “manipulate this” don’t ever give it enough pump that they will just scare everyone away ...    (nobody) knows but I know I’ll Hodl until I hit my loss number (50%).
Huge buy wall at 6000 Russian Rubles!
For the Hodlers.  If you're going to play the game, learn to play it right

https://youtu.be/7hx4gdlfamo
We’re out of the asteroid belt now 
tomorrow 10k
The battle for 6k is intense.
My prediction: a pump followed by another dump. 
can we stop with the 'next bull run' nonsense , call it what it really is,  'the Great Pumpkin'
Patience. The demand for Bitcoin is more than ever. If you're panicking, then you're the one supplying it to who are trying to get it cheapest they can.

I was -70% back in February and became positive again +30% not too long after. My only regrets are from trying to swing trade shitty alts after.
I love how so many people spreading FUD in this thread today have new account flairs. 

The price drops a bit and the FUD shills come out of the woodwork. Coincidence?
The time to buy is anytime the price is down.  If you are thinking short term day trades, swing trades, you increase your risk.  Just buy and HODL until 2020 when we come out of the bull market and break the ATH.  Sell then and buy the crash again, the only difference will be the market cap will be in the trillions.  Then, HODL again.  Bunch of newbs in this space.  
For everyone who's saying it can't go down from here:

It went up 6X in 6 months last year.  1000 - over 6,000. You think it can't give some of that back? That there's some sort of stability under 6,000?   LOL

https://imgur.com/a/twSsG72

It could give back half of that and still be up 3X over last April (which would be an amazing return in most markets).

Everyone needs to chill out. Bitcoin is fine, just hold through this. Most of you seem to forget that we were in a 3 year bear market before the previous run. Bitcoin has proved all the naysayers wrong countless times. 
could it be that that the guys who are selling off large scale now are miners, which hedl btc in large amounts? 
We will see it.  Nobody panic lol 
Ayy here we go...lol

Thanks to the SEC, Bitcoin will rise back up... Too many people wanted it to be a get rich quick thing and it is not!
By the way, now if bitcoin causes harm it will be returned 
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4JcXBfQDos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4JcXBfQDos) Cranky vlogger Hobotraveler finds a bitcoin business.
Soy I have my bitcoins in electrum wallet and for some reason, that software disappears or I just plain want to use a different one. What is the correct way to go?

I'm still considering which wallet to use and still don't have a hardware one (don't have that much funds still, actually)
its the alts that have hurt me. not bitcoin. lesson learned. stick to BTC
Can someone help me find a new platform for buying bitcoin (Previously used Coinbase- but they are going to start audits requiring you to file taxes on your profits?) Also a New trading Platform, preferably p2p and decentralized. Ive been searching for hours and have yet to find a service that doesn't require full verification (for taxes).
What I don't get is if you think Bitcoin is a valuable currency why do you care what the exchange rate is against the dollar?  I don't wake up every morning and say oh crap the Dollar is down against the Euro.  
6k resistance is strong. Pump to 7k incoming... Don't give up now. Buy buy buy
Just bought the dip. I feel sorry for weak hands and low IQ normies missing out on DISCOUNT bitcoin of the future. I am just sitting here laughing at the shakedowns and people who don't understand the power of blockchain. Only the bravest and the smartest innovators will get to the moon, not late adopters. We're visionaries my friends, don't forget. 
No profit in bitcoin in 2018
Man, the sarcasm is rampant. Clearly neither response was valid to my request.   Sorry you both lost so much. Of course, I have held long term and will continue to hodl through it all. Crypto is the future and the price is irrelevant.  I just don't get why these huge, random, plunges happen in in the blink of an eye. 
All the selloffs come in sharp spikes. When there are no sharp spikes it seems to be climbing slowly.
I would reason that whales are selling and wider population is slowly buying.  That means wider distribution and more stability
Analyst did not predict this, they caused this. When they collectively say it's going to go down then the pussy ass mother fucker lambo kids are going to dump.
I would like to mine but was told it was a terrible idea but thought Bitcoin needed miners. The whole buy buy buy thing is good for awhile but not everyone will hold. Not everyone will buy the dip lol. Every time news drops the panic sales are in full force. Forget reaching 20 k again I will be happy if Bitcoin can stay above 9000. At the most, 6 k or below might be honest to god worth of this currency. 
How many times does bitcoin have to “die” before some of you scaredy-cats 😱 realize Bitcoin is not only immutable, but it is also immortal? 
At least BTC Dominance is at 41%
Crashing so hard right now
So like.. what's the news? another korea FUD/exchange hacked or just whales dumping?
B O I
Don't be scared. Trade Bitcoin as part of a wider portfolio that contains lower risk investments to offset the volatility of this market.

i.e. don't put all your eggs in one basket
about to break $6k :)
Volume is good.
New buyers, prepare your money !!!!
Whooooaaaaa


Ouch.

This is year zero.

(Good for Bitcoin if it drives out the 1000+ shitcoins.)


I just sold my bitcoin and got $346. I just bought 346 in lottery tickets.
Your strategy is all wrong. Your strategy should be to own 1,2,3 however many bitcoin you can afford with out going broke. So if you think about it, and put $50 a week for 10 years that's $24,000 dollars saved or $48,000 in twenty years. So its a win win. But in order to profit off of bitcoin you need to have as many as you can afford, so if your watching the price you will lose in the end but if you set a goal to own bitcoin you will be well off. "Never listen to someone who tries to predict the future, based on the past." -Tbone Lucchesse 
I still feel like 6k is going to be extremely hard to crack. Capitulation for sure happened back in February and it's evident in the dip that people just gave at that point. It's the freakin day traders and the emotional buyers killing us right now. Anyone who thinks for more than 5 seconds knows it's completely foolish to sell right now or below these levels.. which is why I don't think it's going to fall off a cliff like in February. Volume exploded last week when it hit 6,200, imagine if it hits 5,900 - 6000 this time around. Smart people are lining up to buy or just waiting to jump back in. If I had more I was willing to throw in at this time, I'd be buying a full bitcoin for sure at 6,000.

FUD along with the traders/emotional buyers are going to keep us low and range bound until the sentiment changes or something brings a spark to this market.
**Come On Bulls, we are getting slaughtered here!** 
Bulls are back boiz
still a ponzi
Just need to go down a few grand more and there's no way in hell anyone would want to mine BTCs. So much energy could be saved and used for more important things. Let's keep this up and bring home the bacon. 
Lets fight back against the whales.... EVERYONE BUY NOW
Bernie Madoff's clients were also HODLers.  The only difference between Madoff and Bitcoin is that Madoff could be held accountable.  Do you think Satoshi will ever see a cell for this Ponzi scheme?  Hell - we don't even know who Satoshi is.  Biggest scam in history!   A *Ponzi scheme* (/ˈpɒnzi/; also a *Ponzi* game) is a fraud *scheme* in which a victim is tricked into investing in a company that does not actually do business, and only generates a return on investment when more marks invest. As a result, when the *scheme* can no longer attract new investors, it dies. 
Better put those Lambo's and space ships on hold folks, and hold on to your hats. We may see 2000 by the end of summer at SEC headquarters. Some people think what the USA says or does, does not affect global sentiment and price. BS, you're looking at that effect. Bottom line: Other countries certainly do mimic USA monetary policy. Don't believe it? Read world news. Okay, throw several mil peeps that are tired of the slimebag scammers coming out of the wood works in there too, as being a large part of the reason for the decline. The thieving assholes of the world are in dire need of some instant charma. If it doesn't happen, global regs will see that it does; in some form or another. I feel for the millions of people that got burned on dreams over nothing more than hype. I feel a lot less for those that got burned; parading around in their e-clown costumes, with rockets strapped to their backs - moon or bust  printed on them during the charade. Oh well, clowns will be clowns...hard lessons learned. And for God sakes people, don't sell it if you believe crypto will make a comeback in lets say.... 10, maybe 30 years. GLTA, except to those assholes that also fucked up a good thing while forgetting charma pounces when one least expects it!

edit: for the trolls out there...no, I didn't get burned. I picked up some BTC last August, threw it in a cold wallet and it's been forgotten ever since. I did not buy what I was not prepared to loose. Common sense, if you will -  about a 10-12 year old digital currency technology intended to supplant existing monetary systems that took hundreds, if not thousands of years to evolve.
Let this be the bottom and lets start going up properly now!  Enough of this horror show!
LET'S BREAK THE $6K WALLS DOWN TO $5K
Look guys, forget all the crappy analogies, Bitcoin is female.

Completely unpredictable, irrational and mutable.  It's price is as random as the path a pretty lady takes around a clothes shop.

But, just like a lady, Bitcoin can surprise us.

She can be miserable & moody for weeks on end, for no apparent reason (hey, maybe you left your pants on the floor?  Who knows?)

But then, suddenly, she is back again - radiant, standing at the sink doing the washing up, wearing nothing but her high heels and rubber gloves, jiggling her bottom, flicking her hair over her shoulder and winking at you.

That, gentlemen, is Bitcoin.

I hope you understand now.

How bout that 6 month chart huh? 
my powers grow stronger with each dip
We’re stabelizing 
This is good for bitcoin, the faster we reach the bottom, the faster we can start rise
Futurology:

1.  Are cryptocurrencies here to stay?  Yes.  They cannot be dis-invented.

2.  Are they generally trusted?  No.  Of course not, the market is flooded with shitcoins and passers-off like Bcash.

3.  If the technology is here to stay, but is not generally trusted, what is the future?  BTC (and arguably XMR) are the only fully decentralised and trusted assets.

4.  Will Bitcoin rise in price?  Yes.  That is obvious.
you guys may have real profits with visiting [altcoinist](https://altcoin.ist/index.php/signals/)  signals page and reading important cryptocurrency news. there are couple coins to invest which are signed as “buy” 
>Fiat currency will eventually become as passé as trying to pay for coffee with pennies.

If I'm going to blame something it's going to be all the fud. All the speculators and gamblers who don't really give a shit about the technology or adoption are selling out now because they think it's going to zero. They think it's a Ponzi scheme and they are going to run for the door

I'm really really curious if 6K is going to hold. If it does Deep Pockets are most likely keeping it up which of course makes sense beings they are more concerned with the number of coins they hold than they are the price today
When there is SELL there is always a BUY, HODL, someone out there making nasty things, and wanna GET as MANY BTC AS IT ONLY CAN! Someone out there know the future price of BTC tho why he is buying discounted BTC´s ;)
what is the likelihood of a institutional buy at 5000

Finally, breaking through to new lows on double the volume.
It's time to start watching, again.  Will 6000 hold?  The next 
support plateau is at about 4800.  I'm inclined to say, "Watch out below!"
Question for non-hodlers

WTF do you do nights/weekends.  Are you monitoring this shit show 24/7?  Do you have alerts that wake you?  When price can rise and fall 10% in a fucking day, how do you sleep?  

If you hodl this shit, don't bother - we already know what kind of "investor" you are. 
I know most of you guys think about selling but it's not very clever to sell now. If you believe in Blockchain, you know it will not go much lower... Hodl
We have moon'ed guys!

BTC is now worth 140,434,285 Vietnamese dongs!

All those predictions of BTC reaching millions are actually true.
Wow just commented something in r/btc , not even too hard on BCH and got a lot of downvotes... 
Can it just bottom out and get it over and done with. If it bottomed out in February than right now we would have 20k bitcoin.
On the positive side: the more often we test 6k the stronger it gets.

Wait for the technology to fall to 4K and then build infrastructure.

What's the reason for the crash today? 
Wow, did you all just see that bounce off of 6000?!? I wonder if it will continue to hold. This shit is getting tight.
Kool-Aid laced with rat poison. 
[deleted]
The 6k safety isn’t flat at 6k, there’s a decent resistance there. I don’t think this is the floor but hopefully we don’t find that floor any time soon. There’s some climbing left in it I think. I’m thinking July will be a better month, not McAfee’s projection but 9k is feasible. It’s looking very volatile right now, maybe 6k is where some buyers were waiting to pull the trigger. 
I have to repost my own comment.  Because it needs to be read.   [1 month ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8k2sl0/daily_discussion_may_17_2018/dz5yoo4/) 

"Do  you all not realize that this shit ain't going to the moon sometime in  the next 6 to 36 months, UNTIL nearly everyone is in the depths of  despair.   That's the way it works.  Y'all are way too damn excited and  happy for this gd thing to take it's natural course and crash land in  the desert.  Not till then, will we have another lift off.  Your enthusiasm is dragging this shit out."
the silencing of the lambs.   even fast money dropped coverage of bitcoin.  Now the big's will take it over.
The pump were about to experience will be that of institutional proportions 
it wil go to 5,2k time to buy the dip:)  me happy
Bitcoin needs a central bank or some sort of organisation that can step in and stop this price decline by removing the issuance of new coins but also being able to buy up coins that already are out there to keep a stable price and protect our investments.
Last attempt at the Triangle formation would be for wave-d to find support near 5740 (BITSTAMP): https://i.imgur.com/sQD5PeF.png

I hope I'm wrong.

Blame bithumb's $30 mil hack, it caused the price to drop. :( 
Panic is good, guys. If we go down 2k or more in one candle, the bottom is in. 
Hopefully we break 6k next week. Should be a massive drop if we do..
You're right, $0 is strong support. 
And you can't lose more than 100 percent.  
why not?
You only lose if you sell!
It can go to zero cent. 
buy orders in place for .01
Haha :D Good one :D
LMAO
And I like the logo
yup sure :)
Is this sub finally becoming self aware?
Hahaha above 15k or below 15k
It's not a loss if you don't sell and your coin is not delisted from the last exchange.
dont worry, guys, its still ~~20x~~ ~~18x~~ ~~15x~~ ~~13x~~ ~~10x~~ ~~8x~~ ~~6x~~ ~~4x~~ 2.5x up from where it was last year!
lol, and if never goes above 6k again, that is technically true
You speak the true true
Remind me again, when do we say vegeta ? At 7k?
is this fud or true? some people say because of regulated japan 🤔
2018 so far has been an **annus horribilis.**

Why buy the dip when you can buy the floor?

The people who bought btc at $1000 or less are still making mad profit.
Correct. Maybe the problem is too many people hodling and too few are using it. 
Most people are using it as an investment. Not a currency. Here to make money. In the end, USD is king and will be for a long time.
You HODL *right now* for the chance it becomes a useful currency/store of value in the future. 

You HODL for the chance you're not left behind in case Crypto becomes one of the (if not the) only game in town.

You only invest an amount you'd be comfortable losing. You only put in enough that if crypto goes to zero you go ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ "Oh well, I tried, I was wrong. No biggy."

It doesn't really matter what you "tie" it to. For instance, you can tie it to gold or anything *right now* by converting from fiat money. Fiat money is used because that's the easiest method of trading. Much more difficult to buy bitcoin digitally with physical gold (or even securities that represent gold).

The problem with number 3 is just because a government or anyone creates new crypto it doesn't mean it's going to affect the market in any large way. People have to be willing to adopt it, willing to trust it. It's hard to develop trust in new crypto long term. 

The reason Bitcoin is probably the least risky bet is because it has the most history, the most trust. That could change eventually, but it's where we are now.
3: Nothing to stop it, other than whatever checks are currently in place to prevent the gov't from printing money to go bet on stocks, horse races, or blackjack. It's just not how they do things. 
A responsible government WOULD buy bitcoin as a hedge against its on deflationary fiat.  If you think about it, the US government has about 11 trillion in current gold value all in.  running a 21 trillion debt and ever growing.  Having some bitcoin that hits the big numbers wouldn't be such a bad hedge. Especially if they bought them now.  But knowing the US government they would buy at the all time high, kinda like they did with oil filling the SPR.   Not really financially strategic but hey they do have a printing press.   

Bitcoin doesn't need to be tied as it is it's own commodity. Per most governments.  The point is to unshackle from the oppression of central banks and corrupt governments.

My opinion is I would rather hodl, not spend, although spending is fine and the network and hash rate are growing exponentially.  I'll take the ride as a store of value and spend depreciating fiat.
NVM, we will have lower highs. Weeks later people will pray for btc go back to 6k.
Don't worry.. you can "buy the dips" with all that spare .. oh no, wait...  yeah.. bummer.
:(
Someone finally said what everyone is thinking.

Nah, it will be boring as usual.

Probably will drop to 5,750 and then go flat for another week.
What are you doing?
The price won’t go up until LN is broadly adopted. Bitcoin moon doesn’t have anything to do with people hodling. It has to do with people wanting, and having a means to, spend a few dozen Satoshis at a time.
The value of a currency is very weakly related to its usage.
Desperation reeks
> will return coins to the owners, not fiat. 

and just WTF do you think those users are going to do,  they lost them at $400,  get them back at $6100 when the market has been tanking for 6 months.  they've had them stolen once already,  not exactly fertile grounds for HODL behavior.
Have you seen the price for those ETF's?
Preach, brother, preach.
Welcome and you haven’t seen nothing yet.
As scary as it may look the more beautiful it actually is. 
Take a step back so I can get some extension on this ...
Well if you wanted to mine, now is the time to get cheap equipment.  The ASIC miners from Bitmain have collapsed in price on ebay,  7nm miners from gmo will be in the market in i think October for 1999 if you order now. twice the hash rate, 20&#37; less power consumption.  Could be a bottoming of the picks and shovels for mining.  yeah not so profitable now but as some when the boom happens, you're in for the ride.
How can you hear the miners slowly turning something off?


But but but... It was at $20k once so it has to go back!  
I'm a bagulator, although I've been accused of being a manholder.
Thought tether was legit now?
Tether was not a scam, its a very profitable enterprise. It is backed by the dollar and they make a lot of money doing it. Only with I'd figured that one out.  2 billion earning interest is serious change.  The "Tether Scam" was FUD to shake out the small holders, just as your post is. You really don't have evidence just an opinion and its like most others. But post away. Maybe you'll be able to save up for a few satoshis.
rinse and repeat...  still plenty of suckers waiting to get picked up in the next  pump
Go to sleep at 4700
I agree with you on the report. But what world do you live in? Because I live in a world where a large percentage of the population can't even use computers properly except for fundamental activities, let alone understand bitcoin. It is a technology in its infancy, so be patient. In the end, disruptive technologies like this one always prevail.
A really sensible analysis.

The mathematical mean here is, obviously, rather hard to define!

But fading away?  As the World leader in cryptocurrencies, that would require the entire technology to fail, or be shown to be valueless.  I think that is extremely unlikely.

The other alternative is that BTC is overtaken by some other coin - but that again is extremely unlikely, given the lack of trust in other cryptos.

I think trust will be the key to it.  So IMO the 'fade away' eventuality has a very low probability.

Trust will win out - sorry Roger.
Who knows mate.  Patience is the key.
No, I fear it's not.  
Who cares?  

At least the market is moving.  In the long term it makes no difference.

Cryptocurrencies are here to stay; most are shitcoins, and only the trusted and fully decentralised ones may survive.

That, in the long term, is good for Bitcoin.
Probably not as much as if it were to drop below $5.
It was below 6k in like february!
More than usual. Hope it helps out.
That's not a good sign in a bear market 
There's probably a decent number of people who think 6k is a good deal.   Time will tell if those buyers buy up all they can, and leave the downward trend in volume and price, in tact.    It's one helluva downward channel forming, and frankly it doesn't have the proper slope, and entrant v-shape to look like it's going to richochet off 6k and start making the long slow moon climb.

This is the optimal strategy for high risk investment.

There were. Once I hit my short term goal of x amount of bitcoin, I plan to do something similar as you. 
Nope your actually early. Welcome to the party.
if by bottom you mean $1 ,  then I'm going all-in !
Again?
U should fuck mt.gox trustee first. He still has millions of btc to dump.
What happens when you run out of Fiat to "buy the dips"?

How are they dips on a downward slope?  just ledges surely?

What happens when you have no spare cash left and then BTC drops so dramatically to bargain basement price and since you're all out of fiat you have no cash left to buy it at with ?

Would you commit the carnal sin of using cash that you CAN NOT AFFORD to lose?
Didn't even push it sub $6k. Weak.
Bit...Connect...! It is over, thanks for participating!
Stop being dramatic.  It did not pop.  

It's actually a long 6 month deflating balloon.
Unfortunately you can't fake capitulation. Lucky for you it's happening ... 
Dude, seriously. We get it. You're short. You don't have to reverse moon to try and push it lower. There's like a whole group of you guys that have been doing this all day and it just started literally today

You're losing money by the second, if you happy with losing most of your profit thats fine, but it doesn't mean that selling now isn't correct
1,000%?  Boring.  Purchased Nvidia starting @$12 in 2012. Safe investment with strong balance sheet and cashflow. I considered it risk free at the time so I was comfortable buying 1,000+ shares even though that was a substantial chunk of change at the time.  I had shares with 2,000% gains. I'd go buy a lambo with some of my proceeds, but I'm not a douchebag and would rather retire 10 years ahead of schedule.

It doesn't really matter, but that sounds about right.  6K is the made up number that if broken will result in an ugly slide, with no one really knowing what the next made up floor number will be.  Of course elliot wave people will come crawling out of the woodwork with their charts, and then there will be those checking their coffee grounds, and others yet rolling the bones...  There's going to be some sad fucking faces.   But all those people are higher buyers, and high buyers off of a bubble, their opinion doesn't mean shit.  We keep talking about adoption, well then this is what it takes, a good kick to the nuts, to allow it to become affordable again for the masses.

Good for Bitcoin.

Alts / shitcoins wiped out.

Decentralised serious coins building trust.
that's why you put your rand into dollars asap to hedge every month not crypto


As exchange platforms, you might be able to use Bisq or Kraken. Check them out.
This is literally the case scenario for blockchain. It lets people and unstable countries have access to a worldwide Market on their smartphone. It's bringing banking to the entire globe which is something the American and British Bankers have refused to do. On top of that you have a deflationary currency rather than an inflationary one. Now if we could just get all of these emotional people to chill out for a bit who keep hitting the sell button just to feel better

👏👏👏 smart man 
Same. Believe!!!
So the users who were going to be reimbursed are being shoved aside by MountG's creditors?  I'd be so pissed off if I was one of those users burned all those years ago.
There is more demand for selling than buying.
tell me one reason why is bitcoin worth 6000 dollars...
[deleted]
Because the hype is gone and the majority of retail investors do not give a shit about it anymore. It went up due to FOMO, some made money, some got burned and no one cares about it anymore. The majority of people put money in BTC to make big gains. Investors no longer see BTC as an opportunity for that likely because the risk/reward is not worth it.

Don't worry though, you invest because of altruism and the technology so the price doesn't matter right? RIGHT?
plastic bag in the wind... which way will it go?
HODLers remind of the goldbugs. Simple minded folk who treat an investment/trade as it were a religion. You should never be married to any trade, in any asset.
you're the reason why it goes down up down up down up and ultimitly die. 
>You gotta know when to pull out, and when to cut your losses, so you can get back in the game stronger.

Giving bedroom advice already?


Smart.

The people here encouraging people to buy in a bear market are usually losers hoping there will be new buyers to help with their losses.
Good job! That's how you profit — not any of that blind HODL nonsense.
The next time you might lose. You gambled and won, congratulations.
This guy.  Love it 
ATH of 266.  Damn. 
I wonder if that guy is rich now... or still holding
I predict lots of people making predictions.
My prediction is back to >9k within the next 4 weeks.
It's only money, if we lose we lose but at least we tried.
I have a better idea!

Everyone! Stop Buying! If no one buys, then price will surely go down and then, we can all buy more at a very low price! Kill the Whalers!!! 

It's simple supply-demand economics people!!! /s
not even sub $6k. Sad bears.
Do you come up to traffic lights hoping it turns red?

Indeed.  There is always the risk with market manipulation that you destroy your own market.  (That's assuming there *is* widespread manipulation - I'm not totally convinced.)
Feels more like we are at the 5th level of hell.
Yes, sell your house and buy.
How did you make that mistake?  'k' is nowhere near 'c' on the keyboard.
The so called "battle" is all in your head.  It's a market.   There are people who want fewer btc, and more usd, and then there are people with usd, who want less of it, and more btc.     Both sides are finding it a good time to make deals with each other.  That's it.   The battle is a total figment of your imagination.  
If the demand for bitcoin is more than ever then why has it gone form 19 k to < 6 k?
> The demand for Bitcoin is more than ever. 

Facially untrue.
Drops a bit?... 
uh i think everyone just wants to get rich rather than being FUD shills. I'm more pained by seeing my alt -> btc sat balance compared to anything else
It's the same as BCash FUD back in November. Social farms are at work, meaning whales are accumulating at this range.
You've been around a while, you should be hardened to this nonsense.
So you're saying buy low, sell high?  Us noobs really appreciate your expert advice. 
Who is going to bring the price up to a new all time high in a year and a half? The normies are gone, even the 'buy-the-dip' folks have virtually disappeared,  and now we place our faith in the 'institutional buy ins', which may never materialize as long as volume and interest is this anemic. Even if/when it starts to rise, people are still going to be selling constantly to just exit the market to break even and to take profits all the way up. This market will take many, many years to reach a new all time high. I'm going to HODL some of my investment for Moon^(tm)  and actual usage, but I am definitely selling most on the way up; I don't like the risk anymore. My money can be invested much better elsewhere.
people who think there's one cost to mine  .. and that has any bearing whatsoever on the price..

just look at the commodity world and how often the price goes below the "cost of production".. often below the true variable cost of production

All the bulls happened when there was still novelty and hype.

Now the novelty's worn out. No one REALLY cares about blockchain. People see bitcoin as a failed product, a simple gambling instrument, all the while sucking up electricity and killing the environment. 

The world is moving past this fad. The bubble has burst. 
Yeah!  Why get off now when you're already more than 2/3rds of the way down?
I think that happened already when it went below 8000
Likely.
You should ensure you have the seed words for your current wallet - you will always have access to your coins if you have the seed words.

To use a new wallet, create it, transfer your BTC there.

Agreed.  Shitcoins are, er, shit.  er, coins.
Because everything you purchase in your daily life is priced against USD, not against Bitcoin. You don't care about the dollar against the Euro because you get paid in dollars, and you purchase goods priced in dollars with dollars. 

People care about Bitcoin vs USD because they still have to purchase things with dollars (or at least PRICED in dollars). Do if BTC loses half it's value you still have the same number of bitcoins, but now you can only buy half as much gas or milk with it. It's all about purchasing power, which is what you should actually care about.  
None of them really think it can be used as a currency. They just want to get rich quick. 
because it isn't a valuable currency
If it dropped 10% against the Euro, you sure would.
if it breaks below $6k, its going to be a big drop. Are you sure you want to gamble your money like this?
Buy buy buy?
Or, in less sophisticated fashion : Wheeeeeeeeeeee!!!
I heard that at 18,000, 17,000, 16,000, 15,000, 14,000, 12,000, 11,000, 10,000, 9,000, 8,000, and 7,000

Eventually one of y'all will be right.  
smart guy right here fellas.  No way does bitcoin ever fall below 6k
Bitcoin dimensia, I'm starting to get that too
It’s troublesome. My main thought would be the people who own a lot are selling low and causing panic so they can buy more after the panic has ended. It could also be panic selling because of anything in mainstream news. I’m debating selling now and buying again later, yes it’s at a loss but I believe it’ll rise, I just don’t know where the floor is right now
Who are you writing to?
You can ignore most of the previous comments, if you were a real bitcoin follower you would have cashed out on $9,000.00 and would be waiting to buy back in now, my alerts set for $5,570.00, everyone that genuinely has an interest in the use of bitcoin knew that a crash would happen in-between the months of June - & the 1st week of July. 
All the growth for the last week came from a sharp pump. 
Seems the psychological battle is starting to pay off, don’t blame you, this is getting tough for many.
Immutable is one of my favourite words ..
Good for Bitcoin.

I am not the least concerned.

The shitcoin market needs to collapse.  Then the cryptomarket can develop.

volume exploding when it goes down is usally a bad sign.

What you want instead is volume exploding during the recovery/rally phase.
And here, we, go!
 . . . . and betting BIG on BitConnect!
Thanks a lot for participating, and pls keep holding.
Difficulty adjusts. If it drops low enough I get to start mining myself!
Yes! Let's make the pyramid base grow bigger!
ponzi scheme posts = buy signal
no.

A Ponzi scheme requires one person or company collecting all the money and redistributing some of it to make it look like some are profiting. There is no one person selling all of this Bitcoin, so it can't possibly be a Ponzi scheme.
Just like POS. Wow.
That's an unfair comparison.

Bernie was Centralised and got caught.

BTC, as EVERYONE knows, is DECENTRALISED!
Go home... 
Could you post a photo of you *throwing* Bitcoin (into a cold wallet).

I'd like to see that - could be the World's first ever *Bitcoin in motion* action shot :)  Cool.
Actually, I blame it on the exchanges that encouraged speculation and then rigged it with blatant price manipulation.


done
No. She's gone. Like the girl in Let Her Cry by Hootie and the Blowfish.
Stand together HODL = do not trade = low trade to no trade = stagnant market or market stalls and falls =  price drops.  Lesser hodlers worry and sell, but not enough of them = price continues to fall...... rinse and repeat.

Whales buy up your BTC.

Is there a solution to this conundrum?
you get the honor, i'll get the money!
The lottery is cheaper 
We have very different definitions for that word I think. 
You mean the faster this scam will end
It is literally mathematically impossible to lose ^^please ^^pump ^^BTC ^^so ^^I ^^can ^^cash ^^in ^^higher ^^please
Everything except BTC is a shitcoin. You can quote me on that.
What is your current rating and the potential for BitConnect? Looks like lots of those are available, and cheap!
More likely to be replaced by government backed cryptos.

Whats the difference if bitcoin is $6000 or $100? Why does the price matter, I don't understand. especially it used to be .50cents
Step outside your bubble for once
it's not, this is not how markets work, the exchange/broker will step in and if you sell you have to deliver it at a lower price or at a higher price there is your profit loss there is nobody on the other side except the broker who borrows them from somebody who makes them available. 

please don't post anymore you know nothing about how markets work. 
Institutions don't gamble. 
> I'm inclined to say, "Watch out below!"

You have a history of being a negative nancy.
You sleep by being a hodler too and having a nice stack of crypto and fiat you aren't going to touch because you aren't insane.
Why do you care if people hold or sell?
if you're sufficiently "long and wrong"  you can go into hibernation indefinitely 
Ever heard of automated stop loses ? I can sleep very well with that in place knowing that i won't lose money if bitcoin decides to go crazy. The worst way my trades can end is in a 0 sum game or with really small loses i can easily recover from. 
BTC is just a hobby.  We have more serious investments to look after most of the time.

And yes, I have made plenty trading BTC.  Both Longs and Shorts.  Best was shorting all the way down from recent 10k.

Keep holding if you want.  We need plenty of bag holders. 
How does believing in blockchain have anything to do with bitcoin.  It is like saying you should have invested in [pets.com](https://pets.com) if you believed in the Internet. 
blockchain and bitcoin are seperate things
that's a lot of dongs
I recently proposed a new shitcoin.  VIET.  Its tethered to the dong. 
Once it goes to zero it isn't coming back.  
Until it fails and then the floor is the limit again. 
BTC I love you but you're bringing me down.... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eohHwsplvY
🤔
''triangle stratergy analysis'' LOL
Bitcoin being worthless.
Most of those who sold did so at a loss. Such investors never win in life. 
6000... we meant 5000...  that's the number it can't go below because people pretend miners will turn off..

when everyone knows they won't turn off
Do you deliver? 
then we should all sell now and get in lower
McAfee is Alex Jones level batshit. Why even bring him up ?
Someone correct me if I'm wrong but bar some insane amount of hype on TV news, demand won't save this crash and only more BTC going to holders will. So if that follows, as % of BTC being held goes up, BTC price goes up, right? So we just need to wait a while for holders to take over?
1 out of 2 ain’t bad.  I’ll give you that.  Wtf is wrong with you.  It’s been downward for 6 months and you guess correctly talking out your ass in month 5 of that trend that it may continue that way?! GTFO
I'd like to repost a thought I had one month ago.

That Russia would beat Saudi Arabia 5 nil, and then beat Egypt.

I am a genius at looking into the future, once I have seen the past.


Or not. I'll go with that one.
Epic!  

Source?
-29 Karma. Lmao    
lol no, the current Bart cycle is almost complete. Soon it will be time to eat some shorts again.
Shows you how mature this market is. Most mouth breathers can not comprehend how to play both sides and it does not really matter if it goes up or down. 
Looks like you are drunk.
hahaha, wasn't the whole purpose of btc to not have any organisations

you guys just lost it, this is getting hilarious
/s?
"Technical Analysis" or OUIJA Board, which is best?
Just get it back down to $15 pls. TY
The fact that this is slow means this is 100% full long term bear market with no end in sight
Just let this fad end so the world can save on electricity. 
Too predictable.... I don't think those swings will happen at all... I think it will pierce directly into the lower levels...
Bit late...that was yesterday, I could be wrong but these things normally effect the price in an instant so I can't see how, this is certainly something else that we probably don't know about yet haha 😂 
It could be actually if the hacker-s are dumping what they stole
You can if you're on margin.
Price cannot go below zero. 
I'm in it for the pussy.
I have too much pride to sell
At over 9000 obviously;) 
you can get medicated cream for that ;)
I buy all the way down.. and up.

You believe Bitcoin will be a viable currency someday (somehow). Let's pretend this does magically come to pass and the whole world is using bitcoin. You and everyone else continue to HODL anyway because because any economic activity involving the transfer of funds is an automatic economic loss for the spender, since their money would have been worth more tomorrow. Then what? 
[deleted]
The 'I want to get rich' is the reason it will fail.
Desperation.
Me too, brother.
Maroon
Okay not exciting, depressing. 
Ah, might hit up the lake tomorrow, you in?
If it starts mooning no one spends it. That logic doesn't work. 
If it's never used to buy things... Is it still considered a currency?
Yeah, the value of btc is related to how much hype and bs is said about it, if it would be facts it would be trading at $4
Cryptocurrencies don't have central banks or governments, so the value doesn't work like FIAT. What value does a digital coin have if it has very little use, very few places where you can use it, or too few people using it?

This is why Bitcoin has an enormous potential. It could be used worldwide by a lot of people. But until people actually use it, and it's accepted at your local stores, or places most people can shop at like Walmart and Amazon, then it's all just potential.
Sell and leave this place 
Because a non accounting firm did and audit that wasn't really an audit and expressly stated that it didn't really mean anything. 
Might take a barrage of media led hot air to get the next wave in though;

the last lot are still nursing severely burned fingers.
always? lol 

the graveyard is full of disruptive technologies that didn't make it
this dip looks different than any other that we have seen in this crash.  The angle is much sharper yet its not so deep
> Cryptocurrencies are here to stay

Like Laserdisc!
Like pets.com!


Its below 6k today too lol
This is good for bitcoin.
Of exchanges?  Absolutely!

I'm tired of their shit.
This hit me right in the feels... I mean wallet.
if you think about it the hodl meme, is a perfect tool in a 'ponzi-like' market like crypto, or 'emergent'/'low liquidity'/'evolving', anything that makes you feel better than 'ponzi-like'.
Solve X. 
Early? Lmaoooo.
/s
that sounds hot tho
Who took charge of the Silk Road BTC funds? was it something like 300,000 BTC ?

FBi ? CiA ?  it's one of those, or have they auctioned it all off by now?

USA are in debt ( apparently ), so it wouldn't surprise me if one of those agencies had been ordered to liquidate that 'nerdy play money' by authorities above them.
Apparently he won't be dumping them. 
Over a hundred thousand, and I think you'll find out fairly soon that those coins will not be dumped.
The best way i think is to invest tiny amounts spread out evenly this way you get a bit at every price point. you should never go above your "can' t afford this" limit.
it can't go straight down..  the pump and dump  makes money on volatility


(His sockpuppet name says it all: 'throwaway..')
Nice. What you forget is you have an entry point that varies differently to others. Maybe if you said I bought at 500 and held as it plummeted to 50$ for a year. 

Other then that of course it's easy for you to spew that nonsense.   

How about the guy down 12x LOL
how do you live with the fact that is was 19k, you could have cashed and you didn't and it will never be 19k
"My bags are heavy" 
So why are you on this board?

I hope you sold those 'shares' - I cancelled my Netflix account because it is shit!  :)
Good man!
If we could foretell the future, we would all be rich - which is a contradiction.
OMG.. you work?  

 how 80's.
You 'had' shares with 2,000% gains?

And what has 'douchebag' got to do with your boasting?
[deleted]
nothing wrong with selling for legitimate reasons. dental issues can be terrible. if i had to choose between keeping .2 btc or a root canal if i needed one i'd have .2 less btc
Dem teeth 
I believe I read somewhere (sorry don't remember the source) that the individuals who lost bitcoins in the hack need to re-submit a claim by October, to be paid out sometime early 2019. 
Why don't you find out for yourself - it is worth 10 x that price.
eugh no
Your message could have been shared at many points in Bitcoin's history. It's possible that this is it, and everyone is disillusioned... but I think that's unlikely. 

Bitcoin is continuing to gain respectability - it was recently mentioned in the US Supreme Court. Some people who were previously adamantly against it are now more tempered, at least in what they publicly say (e.g., Jamie Dimon). There are people who still seem to associate Bitcoin with high fees, despite that being a quite short period, with actual improvements in the transaction situation since that time (exchanges batching, increasing adoption of segwit, and development of the lightning network). This also reflects continued advancements in the technology, with many people continuing to contribute their time to make it better.

Any bad news today (aside from the price) seems to be easily interpretable as good news - Mt. Gox's creditors will be able to receive Bitcoin rather than cash, helping reduce the massive amount of coins in Mt. Gox's control, and redistributing them back to the people who should own them. There are stricter regulations for exchanges being imposed in Japan, which could either be seen as bad by those who advocate for complete freedom to transfer and exchange wealth, or good news for people who favour some sort of official oversight or legitimacy.

As near as I can tell, the only really bad news lately is the price. This has happened before. It will probably happen again. There doesn't seem to be any reason (to me) to suspect that this time really is different, and Bitcoin is on a permanent decline.
Gold bugs are certifiably nuts ...  Literally refer to as 'nut money' n the investment industry... But at least they have some concepts of economic fundamentals... I'm not saying they are right. I'm just differentiating from Bitcoin 
Probably because literally 100% of long time bitcoin holders have made more profits than most on the planet will make in their lives.

Most traders lose, 100% of long time holders have gained. Maybe this won't repeat again, but Bitcoin is more widespread, more recognized , and more institutions are working with it than ever before.
The whales playing pumps and dumps to win their futures contracts are the ones causing all this. 
Pretty sure these are the lyrics to a Kenny Rodgers song

Kenny has a face I trust..  so this is sound investment advice
It's called -- A Greater Fool
Sssshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh .........
I predict a riot.
🌝
I predict MCafee will eat his dick 
True, I’ve lost way more betting sports, and with bitcoin, there is still hope for a second half comeback, were only down by 13000 points in the second half :(      Luckily.... for us long term holders.... this is a 7 game series, and our top draft pick ”lightning network “ is starting to heat up
no /s but I think that already happens. We complain that there's no new ppl coming in, but I think we slowly loosing the ones in.
He runs down every pedestrian he sees so he won't have to worry about possibly hitting them.
Ok my bad.  Just angry here 
People with break points are people who wagered more than they could afford to lose.  People who wagered only a portion of what they could afford to lose, can ride it straight into the ground, buy the ashes for pennies on the dollar, and make a decent resurrection if not an outright killing on the phoenix rising.
I have none. I am a long term investor. In 3 years it will be 100k+
Good luck guessing the bottom then gambler. Long term investors that believe in the tech buy and HODL and don’t panic sell every time whales try to manipulate the market. 
This place is really starting to sound like despair... that's hopeful
Of course public interest is gone. When live in a time where people do what is trending. If an all bacon diet was trending people would do it. So get were you wanna be because when it blows the people that lost interest will wish they hadn't.
Are you sure or are you just inpatient 
Well it's supposed to be a currency innit
I would like to see more people buying pizza with their profits.
and it's not beyond reason that the banksters could or would crash crypto to 'get rid of the nuisance' so that they could get back to removing the shirts from peoples backs just as they have done for decades.

It's chump change to do so ( for them ) and after all, they just print it when they want more.
.. he means 'circle of hell'
a.k.a. *"metaphor"*

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor
1. A lot of people got in the hype wave and got burned by an artificial price boost. These people are despairing pretty much as they are watching what they believe is "losing all they have". Bad news on top of bad news causes whales to sell and the despairing hands follow. The loss of $6k support means extremely increased despair as we have not gone under that for ages. A test of $5k is probable (that's the previous bottom before $6k was set). Eventually as it gains awareness it will recover everything but that might not happen until the end of the year.
Well... Because.... Um.. You see
It's simple if you don't understand how supply and demand works. Stupidity knows no limits..
So if this thing bounces a grand tomorrow you're telling me you wouldn't get excited? People want to buy when things are positive and right now everyone is fearful. A good portion of the money in crypto right now is from us little guys trying to get rich quick.
Facially?  Crikey.
yeah, it went down a little today.
no idea what the point of bashing bcash and btc are. I got an airdrop and just holding both. If BTC drops, bcash goes with it alongside everything else. Shouldn't people want both to succeed?
If it were that simple people would do it, but clearly that is too difficult for many to attempt.  
I will continue to buy the dips.

**Edit: I spelled "will" wrong.
Good luck on your 5% annual returns "elsewhere."  We'll enjoy our 10,000-20,000x from a multi trillion dollar market.  Newb is as newb does. 
That's ridiculous - the overall supply isn't impacted that much by mining.  Over 80% has already been totally mined and only a teensy tiny fragment of a percent is added any day.  Virtually all bitcoin will be mined by 2040.

The impact on supply of mining is effectively zero.  

Only if there is an expectation of a price rebound in the near term. Look at the oil industry -- if the price per barrel dips below $50 for a day, no biggie. But if it stays under $50 for a while, there are huge layoffs in the oil patch and the rigs stay in the equipment yards. So, there is probably some number at which the mass servers get switched off, although I would guess that the number is somewhere south of $5,000.
what's the days to cover?  pretty meaningless charts without that metric
Until december of 2020, then all the way up to McAfee's 1 million.

That'll be something.
Maybe even longer, even if that’s the case, I have no problems holding till then, and neither should you. 

The 2020’s are going to be a very interesting decade for technology. VR worlds, colonization and industrialization in space, advancements in AI and quantum computation. These are all things that cryptocurrencies can and will play a direct role in. 
2.5
Well sure yeah that could happen. Just saying to have patience. 
It's a cycle, people get excited then it wears off. Hype will return as it has time and time again.
Errrr ..... because you can lose another 1/3?
I k is, but what if for any reason that wallet software stops working? Do I have any option to use the same address in two wallet software?
Well that just proves bitcoin isn't a currency and isn't a value store.  It is just some numbers and has less intrinsic value than this post. 
Couldn’t give a shit about the tech. I definitely am/was in it for the money. Instead I’m now down over $100k. And TBH I’d really rather have that $100k back than the bitcoin.
I think you are correct. It is easy to get rich over 30 year period.  Very hard to get rich quickly if you are playing by the rules.  
Wrong. 
It has.  But that has little effect on me. Other than when I travel to the Europe.
the euro dropped like 30% in 1 year against usd couple of years ago people didn't care what are you talking about
Yes, I’m pot committed 
Bye bye bye? 
It already went down to ~5.9k territory in february and has never been below after that. This time it didn't even touch 6k. Yes, there are fluctuations but to me it looks like we found our bottom. 
it just did
All the bigger investors are putting their hedge funds in asset based stocks until an international committee has published it report. Even if I miss out on the crash or just simply decide to wait, i'll be buying in after the 1st week of July regardless, safer bet.
explain, how is week a sharp pump?

I'm not sure why this would cause a dip, since it's only for new accounts and fine existing accounts might need to provide ID again.

Here's the email I received from them if anyone is interested. 

bitFlyer Inc. responds to improvement order from Japanese Financial Services Agency

On June 22nd, 2018, bitFlyer, Inc.

If that's how you want to interpret it, sure...
The retort to "But it's dry heat" is "so is a crematorium."

Me too. I was being sarcastic.
It's a Nigerian Prince.  

I can tell you more but you first need to send me 5 BTC.
It is.

Oh hell you lost your shirt didn't you ? a few weeks ago you were all up on bitcoin and now you're mr. Bear

Did you sell the bottom?

Come on man don't be another statistic

There has been just a crazy amount of this Ponzi scheme going to zero fud today
Yea but I spend my BTC whenever and where ever to bad you cant spend a beanie baby. if you could they would still be valuable.
No, but if I did I would have bought a ton of BTC in 2009.
If people panic again, a flash dump to $5,500 sounds about right and maybe we'll get our bottom.
Well yah.. but it also means people are willing to buy or have their orders set at a certain price. AKA 6,000, thus a battle ensues as to who wins whether it's the buyers/sellers
doubt it. + i wouldn't trust a "redditor for 3 months"...
Bitfinex.
See? Another one of those clowns that makes absolute zero sense when they post something; because they are incapable of contributing anything but blurt.
Really he didn't actually throw them, he put them in a wallet then put the wallet in the freezer "safe place"
Yeah, I think that falls into the asshole category.
I blame the government for creating the internet.
Pretty sure whales have been selling btc today with big drop like that in last 24 hrs
Buy and hodl, don’t just hodl. 

There will still be plenty of idiots selling to fill our buys. 

My goal is for us to fight back against the bear whale shorters. 

Let’s squeeze those mofos 
[deleted]
He's learned to balance on one leg.
No.  Nothing is certain.  I'm not requesting a pump.  Merely stating facts.

If BTC dies, a new technology dies - and I find that extremely unlikely.

Do you have a problem with that thesis?
>Everything except BTC is a shitcoin.
Which is simply digital FIAT. Like Tether.  
The price matters because people who bought in at 19k cant buy as much stuff with 6k so they hope the price goes up.
Hashrate. That's really the issue. The second one is adoption and consumer sentiment. There are so many more people using Bitcoin now than there were when it was at $0.50. For it to head back that direction literally means people have given up on it. The problem with hash power is when the price starts to get down around $4,000 a lot of miners are going to shut down. If they get sold which many of them will what you're going to have is a situation where network hashpower is down and the Pirates now own a lot of what was Network  power. Welcome to the age of 51% attacks. This Will Destroy sentiment even further. There is so much more hashpower out there today than there was years ago. 
The difference is called speculation.

The retard who paid the $5900 difference is doing it because he thinks he can sell it later for more.  There are morons here who even believe that it will go up to $250,000 in a few years (yes, they actually believe).

Otherwise, a $100 BTC is exactly the same as a $6,000 BTC.  Frankly, BTC doesn't gives a shit how much you paid for it.
What bubble is that? The one where you make angry little one line comments on Reddit? Oh wait that's your Bubble

Lol... Just For kicks I checked your post history. you're nothing but a troll you run around talking shit comment after comment

How bad does someone's life have to be to enjoy doing that?

Either you're just a skeptical miserable person or you're spreading fud because you're going short. Which one is it?
Sshhhhh!    Don't ruin it for them...  Those deep institutional

Thanks, Matt.  You have a history of being a positive nimrod.
Maybe you didn't read the question.  Not interested in what the true believers do.  
I agree anybody who activly trades more than 20% of his assets is insane. first and formost you should invest and daytrading with a portion of that is done to increase your overall Investment
I'm interested in knowing how people trade this crap sleep at night.  
And that would've probably been a good investment on the internet buddy
Believe me - you need a really big wallet walking around in Hanoi.

Totally not worthless. Keep buying the dips, you'll have a Lambo in no time. 
Nothing about crypto delivers.
I know he is, but his projection for June/July came up quite a bit in daily discussions. Don’t write off what the guy says just because he’s crazy, this whole thing in theory is as well and a lot of people believed him. I share his belief that it is going to climb up again soon, I just think his mark is off
You are one of those people who doesn't like people being mentioned.

Why?

For example, you won't like this: Roger Ver and his shitcoin cash has done nobody any favours here, including himself (he hasn't sold a single real Bitcoin.)  He's a wanker, but not stupid.  (Only his Bcashing trolls are stupid.)
Demand is what makes the price go up, the more that sells, the higher the price goes. The less there is available makes what is available more valuable. The only reason mainstream news sometimes raises prices is because it makes more people buy which increases demand
I think you are correct. The market is being I fluenced so it's definitely a matter of time before they blow away the short side. 
Well this shit drives me to drink sooo 
The drawback of TA is that you can't chat with your dead grandmother at the same time.

Good, more time to accumulate. $1k would be great.
Another insight that discredits history (of the actual entity being discussed) 
or lets just start building and using ocean wave powered electricity stations. All that untapped energy!

Between that plus solar plus other flowing water options ( hydro-electric dams etc that already exist )  do we really need to keep burning fossil fuels?
I'll get my purse.....
Does this have something to do with btc ending up in the 6k mark? Sheesh, though one guy said that by the end of the year he predicts it'll moon up to 60k, what do you think about that?
Like some Robin Hood kind of thing.
Price can be negative. You could pay someone to take away your BTC. I will happily do it for free, though.
You will get it bro, just fucking hodl
I'm much more in the "store of value" camp. I definitely think it's unlikely Bitcoin would be *the* currency for everyone. Why do retirees ever cash in their stocks? They're likely to be worth more tomorrow. It's an economic loss to them to ever sell them.  People will use Bitcoin for the same reason they use other appreciating assets. There's something they need/want now that has more value to them than holding on to a fraction of a fraction of their wealth.
I can't really even speculate. I just have to believe that there is something that prevents the national Mint and the federal reserve from printing money and gambling with it. In a way they gamble anyway, by giving it to banks who then loan it to people who may or may not default on the loan, but it's a measured risk rather than a straight up gamble.
it kinda failed for all the big new buyers between 12-14k 
But can you buy thing ALL OVER THE WORLD with it?  
Yes.
No.  That is completely incorrect.  For more reasons than you can be bothered to research.
And I can buy gold or silver at J&M Gold or Ampex with bitcoin, and for less than credit card. 
Imagine if we were all stuck with flying the Wright Brothers first airplane design?

BTC is revolutionary, a wonder to behold, but just as Wright Bros did not become sole aeronautical moguls of the world, not will BTC be the only form of usable crypto. 
You run with that, so a major exchange is gonna lie about this after all this.  Opinionated FUD.  But, drop it like its hot, oh you don't have any to drop.   
fools and their money..       also your dealing with a target audience that has the attention span of a gnat
Or Digital Audio Tape (DAT).

But these were just technologies to store and retrieve data.

A distributed - and TRUSTED - ledger is an entirely different idea.
Not today 
Slippery slope being that government regulation is what we should all be against. But, if there were some way to monitor the exchanges with some form of punishment I think I’d be interested. Interesting thought
Not tellin 
Why not early. Your must be bitter because you don't know how to hodl. Bet you bought when the price was going up and now you feel its the end so your cutting your losses. Pick a side in or out its that easy.
These guys have been making a real effort like all day to really get the Good bullshit going. You check the Post history and there's like this laundry list of comments All saying the same thing in different posts. It's going to zero. It's a Ponzi scheme. Bitcoin would be just the same at $100. 
It depends on why you bought BTC. Are you a trader or a hodler? 
The more I win the more I take back. Just dont be ultra greedy and Bitcoin will take care of you
See a doctor.
Why are 'shares' in quotes?  Believe it or not, you cancelling your account has had zero impact on the stock price. Its up over 100% ytd. 
Best music. Best fashion. Best coke. Best decade. 
I sure did. I just wrote a fat f'ing long term capital gains check to the IRS this year for the shares I took off the table. I think the majority of what I'm still holding were purchased at a higher basis and are in the 1,000% range. 

Most people who are"in it for the technology" here aspire for moon and lambo so I figured I'd speak a common tongue in my story. 
just buy a cheap hand drill, a few drill bits and man up :)
true :), I'm out of around 30% of my BTC because of it, but I still have some ETC and NANO that i'm holding onto for the future. It's a bit smaller (especially since i brought early in the year), but I'm really hoping that it can make up for it in the future
Repaid by MountG...who won't have any money left to make those repayments after the creditors peck the corpse clean.  That's how it sounds, anyway.

Maybe they'll still have a Black Lotus or two left after the creditors take their share.
Lol
I have one to sell you! 
Look into it
Yes but the hype of bitcoin as a get rich quick type of investment is gone which is what got it to 20k in the first place.
Holding gold is "nut money".  Timing gold is "genius".
Keep hodling :)

Or this is just what the market is willing to pay for it...
Don't worry - it will go up to $15k next month and $250k in 2022.
Or get cut to pieces catching falling knives.


5,000 - you're in.

4,000 - you're in

3, 000 - you're in

2,000 - you're still in (bold)

1,000 - you're STILL In (balls of steel I tell you)

500 - In

250 - Hell yes

100 - going to the moon, load up.  

In that scenario, you're still all in?  I really fucking hope you're playing with money you can afford to lose all of - because this isn't investing - it's like some kind of cultish following.
You've been very entertaining.   I may disagree with some of your posts, but I'm never bored by them.
100k+ what? Zimbabwean dollars, maybe . . . . .
Clearly the words “investing”, “investor”, and “investment” can no longer be used in the context of this shit. Throwing your money to the wind, pissing away your savings, are more fitting than “investing”. Nobody “invests” for this amount of loss.
I’m holding too but my point still stands that the logic is unsound, it’s mooned once under mysterious circumstances opposed to all the “dips” lol 
Good for Bitcoin.
That how we know bitcoin hasn't hit bottom. When we are able to get on here and laugh about how low the prices have gotten then that's when we will see a reversal. But until then keep hoping we don't go down any further.
About what?  That it will go on for a long time more?

On that, absolutely yes.  You just need to monitor the top wallets.
That is a possibility.

But you can't un-invent something.

Consider that.


It's misleading.
Yes that might well be true but it also means that demand for bitcoin is lower, and this also makes sense when viewed alongside the > 60 % drop in price. If demand for bitcoin was at an all time high like wig319 said then the price would not be down so much. 
I take it "ages" in this context means 7-8 months?
I know, it's like index funds are being created for no reason. 
.. and the rank stupidity of a commentator who doesn't understand that everyone else already understands his statements of the obvious ..
Quick?

well there's your error.

It's a long game
That's not relevant, you said demand was higher than ever, it clearly isn't, as the price is 30 % of the ATH. 
He couldn't remember how to spell fecally, ( which would have been more accurate )
And yesterday... And last week... And most days since January...  
But this is good for Bitcoin, right?
We do; but there are groups/organizations/establishments and such that would rather it never took hold as it impacts their way of making money.
What's the strategy if it doesn't go back up?
Likewise! But remember, even going back up to 20k is only, what, a \~300&#37; increase from our current price? Good luck on your 20000&#37; gains next year!
If you really can't get more than 5% per annum you are a moron. 
Miners dump about $10million worth of coins on the market every day.  This is a constant downward pressure on price that must be absorbed. It definitely has an impact on the price. 
agreed.. people think that miners turning off their machines (they won't) below $6k has any impact whatsoever on the price..

with a total lack of fundamentals.. the long case seems to repeat this cost of mining number nonsense fairly often


I'm time limited... it needs to turn around sooner or I'll be feckin dead and my relatives will all wonder what the long numbers are that they've inherited.
definitely, no more than 3 to 3.5 for sure..
Of course.  You can use that seed to open any suitable wallet.

But watch out - someone else with your seed words can do the same!
Bingo. People think it will meme its way into widespread usage when in reality all it has shown to be thus far is a speculative vehicle for get rich quick schemes.
Not sorry for your loss
But it’s never dropped like that over an hour or so. Usually over the course of years.
In 20 minutes? Regular currencies just don’t do that.
1.  No, it did not reach 5.9 in February - y'all know how to read a fucking chart?  https://imgur.com/NdWoOL0

2.  Calling wild swings of nearly a 100% "fluctuations" is pretty fucking hilarious. 

3.  The idea that anyone can call a bottom is fucking hilarious since. . .there actually is no intrinsic value and the actual price is 100% market psychology.  Anyone who's studied any market in history knows psychology can turn on an instant.  You think you have footing, and then. . .whoosh, another 2/3rds gone in an instant.

But hey, at least you're gambling with money you can lose all of, right? 

Right? 


I mean moons are bullish so makes sense. 
Today it is 
I know :) 
this is legend
But you can't play with it or cuddle it either nor will your grandchild appreciate it.

At some point in time, people are going to wake up and realise that they just paid thousands of dollars for a number generated on a machine.
Me?  I closed all my positions since my last short down from 10 to 7+.

You and I know it's going to bounce back up ... but people shouldn't be encouraging speculation either.
[deleted]
Well the nice thing is it can't go below zero. 
Sorry, should have added the <sarc>  tag.
What have you got against clowns?  I bet you saw that creepy movie.
You’ve said nothing.  It’s simple 
Pretty sure the whales are all long gone.  Just the traders and ODD LOTS taking positions.
They are running before the regulators step in and clamp down.
Stop encouraging others to buy in a bear market just to prop up your losses.

You are being no more than a low life weasel doing this.

Bitconnect
The tech is blockchain.. the cryptocurrency is bitcoin.

Its like saying if google dies the internet would die 😂 

Some 'facts' you have there
yes and if that happens bitcoin will be at $0,004 overnight. 

if there is really somebody here who thinks governments and big corporations will give away the tool (currency) to control things is delusional. 
And BTC is just a digital token, created from thin air and artificially capped at 21m (which is irrelevant since there are close to 2,000 alts now).
Nobody uses it. People hoard or speculate. Noone uses it to buy food, clothes, pay rent or whatever.
That's not how it works.  Go read up on relationship between hash rate and complexity.
BTC4TRADE, you have managed to squeeze the words retard and moron into those few unsupported utterances above.

I, personally, find you unhelpful, and extremely offensive.

I would be grateful if you would fuck off.
Did that hit a nerve?
My point is that most traders aren't trading their life savings so sleeping isn't a problem.
[Pets.com](https://Pets.com) went out of business dude.  
Look at a bitcoin chart for the last 6 months.  It has no purpose or value.  
LOL -- have to remember that one!
if you take out the fake prop up of 2017 things look very different
Ok, but what value is it storing? Stocks are inherently valuable because they pay dividends and are ownership of a company. Bitcoin is only a store of value if you start with the assumption that it has some inherent value. In 20 years a Bitcoin will cost as much as a Beanie Baby.
"Zeitgeist Part 3"  may be of interest ( ha! lol, geddit? ) to you.

just google it :)
What can you buy with gold?

Go buy yourself a car with gold.  Or a pair of trousers.  Or a house.

With LN it will be possible to buy the 1c paper cup for a coffee - never mind the 4 USD coffee.

Think about it.

No - don't think.  It will stress you.

If each tether is backed by USD why can't you exchange tether for fiat? Any why put out a phony audit? Why not perform a legit audit? 
Trustless or not, bitcoin is not useful as money if the price remains volatile and susceptible to manipulation. If the price keeps +/- 10% of its value every day, who would ever use it to store their assets in, or pay others for goods? 

This is very basic economics. Bitcoin just doesn't meet the baseline criteria for functional money. 
but every day
June 29th. ;)
< 1 BTC.

That's why you are so desperate for it to be worth $250k in order to retire.
I bought at 2K and sold at $5500. Then it went to 20k lol. 

I’ve been watching the boat sink for a while.
It’s amusing. I’ll jump back in when I know it’s time. 
If you can take greed out of your life, you have achieved something. 
Because you don't have any :)
And what has 'douchebag' got to do with your boasting?
Gone _for now_, which has happened multiple times throughout Bitcoin's history. If it's gone for good, that would be ideal, as that type of thinking is one of the things that contributes to the volatility, which interferes with Bitcoin's use as a currency, but I doubt it.
[deleted]
I’m not worried, just pissed that bear whales keep shorting the market. I’m not a fan of shorters when it comes to bitcoin. 

I don’t see how we get to 15k by July.  Maybe September 

I have pledged to hodl no matter the outcome.  I stand by my pledge.   
Like I said - you will find plenty of enthusiastic bag holders all the way down to $1.
ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED? 


IS THIS NOT WHY YOU ARE HERE?


Strength and honor! 
$100k Zimbawean is not even enough for a slice of bread. 100k Belarusian.
... said by many a nocoiner and panic seller numerous times since 2010.  Yet here we are. Pretty damn good investment for people with vision and a long term mindset. 
Look at the long term log chart of bitcoin:

https://bitcoincharts.com/charts/bitstampUSD#tgSzm1g10zm2g25zl

The last 8 years has been a continuous moon. It’s not mysterious, it’s called long term growth.  
I never said I was in it for a quick buck, I started last year before the hype and never sold. I'm referring to the constant pessimism in this thread when things are down which gives a better idea of your target audience
it's all relative..   just zoom the chart out.. and then flip it upside down..     and pour tall glass of vodka...


Buy with money you’d light on fire and buy it all the way down. 
Consider your money lost.  Good luck with that attitude in life.
I agree.  People that can't are a moron.  
There's about 27,000,000,000 worth of bitcoin already mined.

10,000,000 is .037%

So no, there is no measurable impact on supply by mining.  
Remind me, who verifies and validates transactions?

and if they're not doing that...... what happens?

\*sigh\*
That's easy.  Just direct them to one of those Youtube that says it will be worth $xx millions by 202x.

Then you have them off your back for next couple of years.
I genuinely want to know what prompted you to come here today and post this comment. 

Your account is 1 week old, and you write a lot of really long comments about video games and such. Then all of a sudden today you decided to come here and shit on bitcoin. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, and I respect it. But for my own understanding, I would like to know why this comment, why today? My first instinct is that you are part of some sort of organized campaign to spread FUD, but I have a hard time believing it to be true. I'd like for you to respond to me, not to tell me the reasons you don't believe bitcoin will succeed, but rather to tell me what made you make this post today. If you don't respond, or you respond by telling me why bitcoin sucks, I will have my answer all the same. Thanks.
I went to Guadeloupe last year and a Euro was worth 1.07 Dollars. Went to Ireland a year later and it was 1.23 dollars.  That is around a 15 percent change.  I don't check it daily as it not important to me unless I am traveling to places that use the Euro.  

The reason bitcoin is so volatile is people aren't using it as a currency and it has no intrinsic value.  
https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/06/bitcoin-price-crackdown-bis-cryptocurrency (edit: daily low on february 6, 2018 was 5920$, in case anybody doesn't want to click the link)
Right.
And thousands of years ago people are going to wake up and realize they gave away a horse and a farm for a few ounces of metal
You mean, like, a computer operating system?  Or the complete works of The Beatles?  Or every movie released by Sony?

These are just strings of numbers too - you numbnut negative fuckwit :)
 yeah I got to agree with that

You're right
lost all your positions - surely.
Let me rephrase I don't believe in time travel,But if there was such a ting I would travel back in time and buy all the BTC my heart can handle.
Did you see "It" I saw "It" forgot the name of the movie but the clown was creepy.
Nothing actually. Love em. Think of mine here as a perfect labeling of crypto nowadays. I think of the smiles clowns have brought to the faces of literally multiples of millions of children over the years; not to mention the adults. Especially those needing a good laugh after the "great depression", or to lift the spirits. Clowns...a great way to put despair or sadness on hold and bring out the good in people. Maybe I am one too. Hope so. Just imagine the costumes and the laughs if there was a crypto theme'd parade of clowns. Sure would have me rolling in the aisles.
Oh that's right. Excuse me for actually keeping it simple and not complicating things with talk of blockchain technicalities and principles of investing. Simple logic may apply now in a crumbling crypto-space; and without all of the complex explanations for the feint of heart and those lacking between the ears to get even more lost in.  Something tells me, no matter what someone has to offer, you would counter it with useless words. For sake of keeping things simple ....FO
Stop encouraging others to sell in a bear market to increase your shorting profits. 

You are being no more than a low life weasel doing this.



At least I believe in this tech and want it to succeed.  You on the other hand have very suspicious reasons for being such an active poster here. 
[deleted]
When did you walk out of your set theory 101 lecture?

At the beginning I suspect.
Alta Vista stone-age.
No one is giving or taking away. Bitcoin is just here and people use it if they want or not. The principle being that it's difficult to take down by someone who wants it to die.  
Following your thinking, NFC enabled CCs and Venmo should have been taking down BTC for a while. 
BTC is global. FIAT isn't, it's usually restricted to a country or several countries.
You won't get an answer to this straight up fact. 
Only at long-term SoV stage right now but let's jump on the MoE phrase of Bitcoin that barely started with LN network effects and whine about it like a nocoiner.
You mean the emergency adjustments? That's not really going to save all the old mining equipment that gets sold. If it's not profitable to mine with it where is it going to go? There was just a ridiculous amount of hash power sold in 2017. Did you see that chart of how much it would cost to attack so many coins on the market? Now imagine taking some of that network hash power offline. Now imagine being able to purchase hash power cheaper

That's a perfect scenario for attacks

If you could make all of that hash power disappear then sure. You could go back in time. Let me know when you find the DeLorean

The absolute best-case scenario is more mining will start to take place in the parts of the world with the lowest power costs. If that were to happen we can probably withstand 2500 to 3000? Somewhere in there but even that is a gamble because you don't really know how much hashpower is going to continue to increase. Just looking at the difficulty chart it's still going up even as the price goes down. If you start talking about lower prices than that then you're talking about a drop in difficulty and hash power coming off line. Which rewinds to my previous statement. If you know something I don't by all means lay it out
Not at all I just don't get the internet trolling. I mean literally the only people that do that are pieces of shit. I mean if that's what you want to be I guess go ahead and do it but no one is going to respect you. Decent people try to help each other out. Decent people give constructive advice. Decent people are helpful. That's not what you seem to be a man and you might want to think about that because how you act online often translates to how you act in person
Do you see purpose and value in a chart? Besides, there is a lot of money you can make if you are so sure it will go to zero. Why don't you short it and when is on the way down, cash it and make a nice profit. Then come here and make a post to let us know about your sweet gains. I think you would like that.
funny you should say that because I posted this the other day... and I guess people don't want to see the possibility of how things appears to be playing out.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8sba5e/back\_to\_basics\_if\_im\_wrong\_please\_say\_why/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8sba5e/back_to_basics_if_im_wrong_please_say_why/)
I guess we'll see. Everyone is placing their bets right now. Either by buying, staying on the sidelines, or selling/shorting. I don't really care if I'm wrong. I can afford to lose a couple thousand dollars.

But I wouldn't be so sure that Bitcoin has no "intrinsic value." To give my take I'll repost a comment I made on another site:

>I believe it's a misunderstanding to think that just because Bitcoin can be duplicated or that other cryptocurrencies can be created, by banks, or governments, or whatnot, that Bitcoin has problems. You can create them, but the question is, will people come? By definition, no other crypto will have as long of history as the original Bitcoin. That unbroken chain garners a lot of trust, and trust is what gives Bitcoin it's intrinsic value.

>Just because you can't eat or touch Bitcoin doesn't mean it's intrinsic value is zero. It's value is tied to people's opinions of it, and the amount of attention people pay to it. As this increases, the value increases, and Bitcoin is the most likely candidate to draw an outsized portion of attention over the long term.
Why are you bringing up Gold ? Gold is not a currency. Are you intentionally being misleading ? Tell me what I can buy with EUR or USD instead ?
IIRC there's a USDT/USD pair at Kraken.  
That doesn't matter.
Haha you got a fair point bro
What’s on June 29th? 

New Drake album drops... so there’s that.
Arrogant and presumptive as ever.
Time is now. Buy on the way down sell on the way up. Most people do the opposite. That's how you lose. 
Don't like lambos. Too loud and ostentatious for my taste. Always been more of a Jaguar guy. 

It's not boasting when you're being called out on a specific metric and explaining how you surpassed that... With a much safer investment, to boot. 
Ask /u/The-Physicist

He's the permabull.  I was just being sarcastic.

If you think it's the whales that are shorting the market, then you really have no clue what is going on.
Vietnamese dong.  

It was really fun being a millionaire (what's in your wallet will suffice) whenever I stepped off the plane in Vietnam .... and gave out $50,000 tips.

Right now, BTC is worth 137,142,857 dongs.

Yippee skippy for the 2010 boys. But still A very shitty “investment” for anyone new to it. And I’m not a no-coiner. If anything I’m an over-coiner, as in bought way too much and watched it lose my money/purchasing value.
No one likes timeframes longer than 4 months, it's laughable.
Sorry, I must have misread the part where you typed

>  A good portion of the money in crypto right now is **from us little guys trying to get rich quick**. 
Thats not an attitude in life. It's called rational decision making, sound investments, and risk mitigation.  I learned this lesson from a $45,000 mistake and it has worked very, very well for me since then. Thanks.  I'm hoping some members here may start realizing this isn't 'FUD', but a fact that Bitcoin may never return to it's previous highs so they don't make mistakes similar to mine. 
That does not follow.

This market is small and the majority of volume we see is not investors but the same few coins traded back and forth on exchanges. Every single day 1800 new coins enter the market and must be bought at market rate or the price falls. That's about 10million USD of new money that must be invested every day in addition to accounting for the activities of the coins already in circulation. 

The price tends to surge a few months after reward subsidy halvings as the equilibrium between supply and demand shifts. 
New account, forgot my old one (and the one before that and that). E3 was recent, so video games are front and center. Like watching tv, so westworld sub is a go to. NBA draft just happened, so I’ll probably pop in there. Immigration always a hot button issue, so I like to give my two cents on that.

As for why I posted here? Been following bitcoin for years now. Decided to check the price today to find it had dropped to 6500 from the last time I checked. Only to then drop another 9% or so in the following hours. Popped in here to see how the community was doing.

Yes, I am a bitcoin doubter. Yes, I do think that crypto currencies in their current form are fundamentally unsound. Yes, I am certain that the vast majority of crypto investors do not believe in the technology and are only in it for the short term gains. Yes, I do believe there is fear, uncertainty, and doubt around bitcoin. The issue is I believe all three of those things are completely valid descriptors of the crypto market.

I think bitcoin/crypto currencies (as they are currently sold) are some of the silliest ideas I have heard of, that’s why I criticize it. My heart, however, goes out to everyone who is losing substantial amounts of money just trying to get ahead in life in a legal and fair way.

Given the speed at which I type, long posts to one person is not so long to another. Writing lots of mundane reports for a living will do that to you.
Yes, it was IT - was trying to think of the name.  My mate Stephen King: a true master in injecting a truly uncomfortable and untouchable creepiness into his stories.

Whooooooaaaahhh!

(Apologies if that startled you.)
I have never encouraged anyone to Buy or to Sell.

So fuck off.

I don't think anyone is going to "take" BTC away.  It will just become irrelevant.

So what if BTC is "global"?  Tell me how many purchases have you made in your last 10 years that is international and warrants the use of a currency exchange?

Visited China within last 1-2 years?  It's now truly a cashless society.  People use Alipay or WeChat to pay for almost everything.    
if you think currencies like the dollar aren't global you are delusional
I didn't understand half the words you use.
The miners run their operations like any business.  If the price goes below their operational cost, they will just down-size or stop altogether ..... just like any unprofitable business.  When that happens, hash rate goes down, complexity goes down and remaining miners continue to operate at a profit.

The point is that price is driven by demand (or rather, speculation), not cost.  BTC was working fine whether the price was $1, $10, $100, $1k or $10k.
[deleted]
So by now you‘ve spent some time rummaging through my post history, called me a piece of shit and implied that my life must suck — and your brilliant conclusion is that I should reflect on the type of person I‘m being? That‘s gold, keep it up!
yeah i'm doing that, and I'm not the only one, don't you worry
>are so sure it will go to zero. Why don't you short it and when is on the way down, cash it and make a nice profit. Then come

Ok will do. But I am guessing if it is zero you won't be around for me to gloat about my results.  
Ok, if the value is based on people's opinions, what are those opinions and what are they based on? Positive opinions of Bitcoin/crypto seem to fall into a few categories:

1. Those who see it as a speculative investment and whose ultimate goal is to eventually cash out for fiat currency or other value stores. The cleverest and luckiest among these people make money off the vast majority of others who pump cash into crypto hoping to do the same. These people are not contributing to the long-term viability of crypto beyond its use for scamming and predatory investing. Works for Amway I guess, although they at least nominally engage in real economic activity in the form of sale of physical products.
1. Those who believe it will become a viable currency in the future. You and I both apparently agree this isn't likely to happen, and even if it did, it'd lead to deflationary economic chaos which would be unsustainable.
1. People who "believe in the technology". These fall into 2 camps: people who don't  understand how blockchains actually work and latch onto its mysticism. These are the same people who believe in homeopathy, astrology, qi energy, crystal powers, and other pseudoscientific charlatanism. The second camp is people who do understand how blockchains work and are convinced there is a viable economic application beyond cryptocurrency as it exists today. Thus far, it doesn't seem anyone has found such an application. If they do, it probably won't do anything to drive the value of Bitcoin since it will be a completely different blockchain serving a fundamentally different purpose. Bitcoin will hold as much comparative value to this new technology as stagecoaches do to automobiles.

People's opinions are not what give Bitcoin value anyway. Its value lies in people's willingness and ability to exchange other things of value for it. Opinions are certainly a *proxy* for willingness, but they are not value in and of themselves. The pool of people who are both willing and able to exchange value for crypto already hit its all-time high point and is going to continue to spiral down for a long time to a zero or near-zero baseline since there are no long-term factors that will reverse this trend.
Gold?
It totally matters. It's unusable as a store of value if the value keeps changing. 

Do you have a logical argument?
Album will pump the shit out of btc
You have as many shares in Nvidia, as I have had girlfriends: none.
Oh really?  Then why huge sums of bitcoin being dumped all at the same time in lumps? This is not thousands of little guys selling all at once.  


Have some patience.  Bitcoin has bear markets.  It doesn’t go up in a straight line for years. 
Guess I misspoke a little, don't hate
BTC "crashed" 8 times and after each consolidation period, the longest being 3 years, it broke all time highs.  The same logic can be applied here.  Simply hold on until the next ride because crypto will only become more adopted over time, not less.  Use your rational thinking to see forward, as it is a skill required to have as an investor.  Your statement, gives me the feeling that you still haven't learned enough.  
The total market is all Bitcoin:  17 Million
1800/17,000,000 is .01% of the market.

The impact on price is negligible.  Almost zero.  Probably not measurable.  
Thanks for responding. I needed to know you were a real person. For what it's worth, many of the holders also have doubt, and try to mask the fear with confidence. So that's what some of the cheerleading is all about.
> My heart, however, goes out to everyone who is losing substantial amounts of money just trying to get ahead in life in a legal and fair way.

Lol why ? Fuck them. If you are really this stupid, you deserve no sympathy. Look at this sub. ''MOON'' ''HODL'' and shit like that. These are degenerate gamblers. I will laugh my ass off, if this puts people on the street..
Bs.  You constantly ridicule anyone buying or hodling bitcoin.  You encourage them to panic sell by your comments.    

You are one of the reasons I am here. To be a balance to people like you and spread truths 
>So what if BTC is "global"? Tell me how many purchases have you made in your last 10 years that is international and warrants the use of a currency exchange?  

Probably a lot. Every time I go to a foreign country, my CC provider/bank will do a currency change for me to a get the local currency.  

>Visited China within last 1-2 years? It's now truly a cashless society. People use Alipay or WeChat to pay for almost everything.   

Yes and it's worrying me as the government have much much more control over E-payments than cash.  

>I don't think anyone is going to "take" BTC away. It will just become irrelevant.  

We will see.
Try to use USD in my local shop, they won't accept it.  
But yeah, repeat that everyone is delusional here, since it seems that you love this word.
Do you mine? Because I do. I'm really familiar with this. 

The reason Bitcoin can never work at those lower prices again is the hashrate. If it's unprofitable for miners they are going to shut off. As that happens the hash rate will go down and the adjustment will take place. However the network just became weaker. This is the problem. When you look at all the hash power that was sold in 2017 alone. Shit if you took all of that and lumped it together you could even attack Bitcoin. That by the way is going to be the last one to go. The real concern is with all the altcoins. If they start getting blown up it's really going to hurt sentiment. The kind of hash power on the market right now is just nowhere near the same as 2016. That's why we can't go back to 2016 prices. Network hash power would fall and difficulty would correct which would make it far more vulnerable. Reread this until you get it if you still aren't getting it.

From the time Bitcoin began in 2009 we have never had a situation where the lowest cost power was unable to be profitable.. bitmain just negotiated a contract in Washington, if it's like a lot of the others it's going to be about four and a half cents a kilowatt hour maybe 5. You can do the math on that to figure out where their bottom line is. 
Your arse must be hanging off by now, laughing boy.
Good for you. Maybe you can give some advice on how to short bitcoin for even more people who might want to do just that? It should anyway help your shorting, I guess. In this spirit, I will leave [this ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-27/calling-a-bitcoin-top-here-s-how-you-can-short-the-digital-coin)link I found over Bloomberg.

For my part, I don't care. If bitcoin goes to zero, so be it. I bet it has a huge intrinsic value in terms of defense against the loss of privacy and the foolish monetary policy of the last few years. If the world does not to adopt it, then I accept what is coming for us all.

However I don't believe it will happen. As soon as the bear stock market starts, I believe bitcoin will go again up.
If I am still alive and this board still exists, probably I will read it and congratulate you. Besides, you don't have to wait until it reaches zero. Even if you are right, It might take years. I wold say, cash your shorts when it's on the way down. You can make several bets and make even more money.
Still in about 12 bitcoins worth. Thanks. Best of luck with the girlfriend. Being yourself until you run across someone equally as weird finally worked for me.  Hopefully youll have the same luck. 
The whales are dumping, not shorting.
That was:

A.  During periods of manipulation that have since been exposed. 

B.  Before Wall Street had access to futures contracts and could have a field day shorting it. 

You sound a bit like the bankers that encouraged multiple refinancings of homes up through '07 since their value will always increase. 

Furthermore, why would people adopt a currency that has been in a multi year free fall?
You mean there are morons that react to a reddit comment and panic sell?

Dude, I have news for you - the average IQ of the people here is higher than yours.
Don't listen to BTC4Trade - he's a trolling wanker with pretensions.
i've been hearing about a bear stock market for 7 years now, it's not going to happen, we will have some pullbacks along the way like we had in 2015 and February so I think the stock equity market bull run can go on for another 10 years with many small corrections along the way. 

you do realize that when you buy shares you can get quarterly dividends and you actually own a part of a company who owns actual things. 

not a phantom hash that is suppose to be going to 'make' it
Even if it went to 25 dollars though you would say it is coming back.  We just hit bottom.
Oh.  You didn't mention you held BTC 'shares' too.

That's a bit of an oversight :)

In not a single one of your previous trolling posts have you mentioned owning any BTC.  

But here you are, now, claiming to be a major investor in Nvidia - AND owning 12 BTC.

I think the bullshit filter is now overheating :)
Yeah and they will buy right back much lower at the expense of the little guys who panic.  I hate that 
The 2017 bull run was 98% retail, 2% whale or institutional money.   Get your facts straight.  
People said the same thing about credit / debt cards when they came out.  Why would anyone use these when we have cash?  lol... your logic holds you back.  Best of luck.  
You just can’t stop replying to me. You’re like a crypto stalker  👀 
Funny, you see a bursting bubble into bitcoin, but the stock market, that one it's fine, [doesn't look like a bubble at all](http://www.macrotrends.net/1319/dow-jones-100-year-historical-chart). No sir, just small corrections here and there. Yeah, it crashed in 2008 for a huge bubble, but this time it's different. No worries. And to answer to your question, I know what a share is. Just an other piece of paper whose value is controlled by huge forces that are far above the average investor and whose interests are far removed from the ones of the average investor. From my prospective, I prefer an asset controlled uniquely by mathematical laws.

Well, we shall see, won't we?
let's cross that bridge when we come to it
Nope. I own 0 btc. If I sold my remaining nvda shares and bought btc with that money, I could buy a little over 12. That is why I said "I own 12 btc worth of Nvidia". That is far far away from being a major investor.

I just detest people going around encouraging others to buy in a bear market when the price is dropping like a brick.
Yeah it's fine, anyways, I think comparing stock market to crypto is wrong. They are not the same, so why compare an apple to a car? 

The thing with the stock market is, since the crash in 2008 and the flash crash a few years later, markets are not allowed to crash anymore like in the past, as soon as too many sellers come in on the stock market and the price drops too much the markets gets halted 5 minutes, then an hour and if it still doesn't work a day. To only allow bid orders so the price stays up. 

This is why the markets can't crash anymore, and only small corrections can occur and that's why I think we will have a bull market with sideways times that could take a year and corrections of around max 10% in the next 10 years. 

And what I say is already working, we are currently already in the longest bull market ever while bonds drop in price with rising interest rates and still the market isn't crashing. 

Well that's not worth much, is it?

What - 75k dollars?  Is that all?

That's not even enough for the Lambo you profess to hate :)
It worked out great for everyone who did just that and then held in every single dip/crash in the history of bitcoin. 

All you do is stalk and insult me at every turn. 

I’m going back to ignoring you for a while.  
Let me get this straight, it is possible to go against the market forces for the next 10 years... by changing occasionally office hours? This what you actually believe?
Your reading comprehension is shit. That's what I have left. 
Tell that to all the bag holders who bought above current price like you.
Precisely - not enough to buy a Lambo.
You realize when I sell my shares I exchange them for cash... I'm not simply giving them away, right?
