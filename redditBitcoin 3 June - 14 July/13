Coinbase's New Custody Service Is Now Live

https://www.coindesk.com/coinbases-new-custody-service-is-now-live/

getting close to ETFs ^ ^
I want to see green stairs, not green dildos. I am a bull but this price spike isn't doing anything for me.
You know someone actually made a list of all of the Dead coins. The website appropriately is named https://deadcoins.com

Over 800 so far and growing.

You almost want to insert a Lord of the Rings joke..  one coin to rule them all
There's a long list of reasons why Bitcoin will inevitably continue to explode onto mainstream financial operations (despite the close minded pessimists who  can't open their minds). But there's one reason above all else why Bitcoin will almost DEFINITELY rise to many X its current value... HUMAN GREED. As long as there's a platform for people to triple their money, there will be people pumping money into it. High risk stocks, Vegas, betting on sporting events, etc.

Now couple that with an actually technology that could potentially revolutionize the way we exchange value, and you've got a hell of a resilient monster that will continue to grow for a very long time. But anyway, NOTHING can outperform human greed. Nothing.
come on 7500+ we need some momentum. 
What is the best investment today? Housing (which is in bubble), stocks (which is just after the peak), bonds (which is declining) or bitcoin which is near bottom?
what did i miss? any news? i was just in bathroom for a min then my alert on blockfolio went off..
July looking good!  Where's that shorter from yesterday?  who said the market was 'soooo predictable' - oops :)


Where do the the no-coiners and fudsters go when the price is going back up? Is there some other forum they can troll until the price drops and they come flooding back saying "I told you idiot nerd fanboys! mrrgponziscamzzshitcoinmanipulashungggreeeeee"
She is looking for a breakout. Steady as she goes, bulls. Keep up your momentum.
Why the boost in price just now?
Looking good.

Tron said it would moon proper about teatime on Tuesday.  I've got the vicar coming round then, so I'm hoping it will be tonight, or at worst lunchtime or early afternoon tomorrow, or I'll miss it.
And we're off again.  Get the tin of green dick paint out.

Bitcoin don’t care about bubbles...

CoincidentalBTC• 4y

Didn't mean to steal your thunder, I just came across the article today during a search, and it reminded me of the endlessly repeating pattern of Bitcoin bubbles followed by naysayers saying I told you so (even while prices were at multiples higher than pre-bubble). This last bubble, I got a call from a friend telling me how sorry he was for me that Bitcoin failed.

you could have literally been a millionaire reading that issue. you can do that math and extrapolate each word of that article would be worth $10000, or many many times its weight in gold. better than every glossy self-help 'how to make money' guru book combined. Just buying $1000 worth of bitcoins after reading that article would have made you more $ than anyone reading rich dad poor dad books. makes me morose just thinking about the missed opportunity ...can't live in the past

This is it, boys. Hope we all accumulated enough in these short months. I wish I could have got more but oh well...to the moon as they say. 
HODL!!!
It's possible we may never ever see 5k range again, but you can tell your kids that you remember it. Question is, how many of you bought it? 
So I just ordered some greek food and paid with bitcoin at [https://www.menufy.com](https://www.menufy.com)

If you care about bitcoin adoption, please try to support bitcoin related processing services.

Also we should try to encourage other food ordering services like grubhub and eat24 to get with the modern age and accept bitcoin!

is there anyway to find out how many bitcoin were bought for this pump?

Layman Questions about LN, ty.

1. Routing - Will wallets be responsible for determining whether transactions happen on/off-chain? Or is LN expected to handle 99.9&#37; of all 'actual' transactions and only channel opening/closing will post on-chain? 
2. Bonus - Is there a 'best' resource for non-coders who are willing to put in the effort to try to keep up with and understand LN as it is developing?
Why is it such a pain in the ass to figure out how much a crypto exchange is going to charge you to transfer currency from them to another address? 
Lets go bulls!  $200 more and we can call this a legit start to a new bull run.   Any millionaires out there to help out?
When the U.S. invaded Kuwait to drive out Iraq in 1991,  Iraq had the 'SCUD Missile', they were crud,  but occasionally they got lucky and caused some serious death and destruction,  most adults back then knew what they were.

When the internet bubble was bursting in 2001,  and people would bitch about FUD,  the favored term was 'FUD Missile'.  

I'd like to vote to bring back the term FUD Missile
Goes up by 5 % and people forget that it went down by 20 % in June.
Anyone think that pump was the catalyst we needed?

Came across this thread on the front page today: [https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/8vj633/over\_800\_cryptocurrencies\_are\_now\_dead\_as\_bitcoin/](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/8vj633/over_800_cryptocurrencies_are_now_dead_as_bitcoin/)

Some of the comments show just how much misinformation and misunderstanding is out there when it comes to Bitcoin and crypto in general. Heck, I was speaking with some finance friends a few days ago about Bitcoin and they *still* lack a basic understanding of the fundamental aspects of Bitcoin.
There's always a warm feeling in my stomach when I open my market app and it's all green 😊🚀
Holy Shit
I'm a noob with crypto and worldwide markets.. So I read the worldwide market cap is like 60 trillion USD and the cryptocurrency market cap is 0.271 trillion USD. Is this correct so far?
So is the crypto market 0.452% of the world USD market? Is this correct?

Bitcoin needs an SMS-based payment system; (yes, I am  alluding to the fact that cointext.io was elevated to production).
Do you think the Chinese miner's that got flooded will start selling soon altcoins and bitcoin to cover the losses? 

stiffy!

 CoinMarketCap is reporting wrong current prices from Binance and other exchanges for BTC. Annoying to say the least as now the weighted average is lower than it actually is. 
That organic growth tho
"As for channel factories, they're nonviable as a scaling solution because:

- They can be attacked, flooding the chain by forcing everything on chain. How do you attack them? You join a payment network and go offline. Anything that can't stand up to a simple, cheap attack is worthless. You still need the chain capacity if you don't want bitcoin slowing to a crawl and freezing up for weeks with backlog of transactions any time anyone decides to attack you. 

- An attack isn't even necessary - an internet outage somewhere (there have been a few major ones every year) can have the same effect. Reliability is going to be very low.

- Cost is unreliable. Multiple things will often force you on chain, at tremendous cost as bitcoin scales. You don't know if you'll pay 1c or $50 for your $30 transaction, and have no control over it.

- They can be spoofed

- The DDOS problem isn't solved and doesn't appear easily solved (this is separate from the issue above)

- Mainstream users aren't going to accept flakey solutions that require constant work adding and funding different channels. There's a chicken or egg network problem here, a bit like FB or MySpace, but a lot worse."

Is this true ?

I tried joining this community,   


[https://bitcointalk.org/](https://bitcointalk.org/)  


But I think it's a full blown scam, it asks me this:  


Your IP address has previously been used for evil on this forum, or it is a known proxy/VPN/Tor exit node, so you are required to pay a small fee before you are able to post messages or send PMs. You can still use all of the read-only features without paying.

Your account contains 1.49 units of evil. To atone, you must pay a total of 0.00000421 bitcoins (0.00421 mBTC; 421 satoshi). Pay to the address 37SqHU6s8aYjUd7mtgdERHReVqYdd6YtE8. Once you have paid the full amount, wait a few seconds and then reload this page. If the fee is so small that your wallet is unable to send it, you can send any larger amount, though you will not be refunded the difference.

Alternatively, any forum staff member and some other notable members can manually whitelist you. Paying the fee is probably easier/quicker, though.

If you don't have any bitcoins, you can get small amounts of free bitcoins using the sites listed [here](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=74046). It is recommended that you give the free bitcoin sites the address listed above. Do not collect money in your own wallet and then send the bitcoins to the forum -- this will likely result in significant network fees.

If you find any bugs in this system, email pbbugs-J6X0kjVn@theymos.e4ward.com. For example, send email here if your payment is not registered an hour after sending it. The mere fact that payment is required for your IP address is never a bug. **You will be permanently banned if you send email here requesting free whitelisting.**

People commonly say, "I haven't posted anything before, so why on Earth am I banned?" *You* are not banned. Your *IP address* was previously used for evil, so everyone who uses that IP address has to pay this registration fee.

  
I asked my friend to join and he got the same message and another friend made an account and he got a different amount, even though they're on the same IP. I think it's a scam, they're asking money to whitelist you.   


Anyone know about this?
This rise strangely coincides with the rumoured "reveal of NVIDIA next GPU line a month from now".. who know's?
What on earth is this, could someone explain me...? This is what they meant when they said BTC could reach near zero? D:

There was a little bounce today, I went automatically sold at 6.6k since I bought at 5.8k.

Does anyone think it will go back up to 7.5k this week, everyone is dumping.
[deleted]
Holly shit, I wanted to press sell, not to buy it. Stop buying pls, start selling now!
🤫
Almost have to wonder if it's a bear network. Trying to break sentiment and drive the market lower. When there is a clear turn they are either freaking out from losing money or going long. Casual trolls are nowhere near this precise with Market timing and their comments
Actually it's a good thing for the market. This means increasing efficiency and reliability 
They list CounterParty as "deceased". Weird. I mean it's not doing very well but it's far from dead.
according to my security software, that site is loaded with coinminer malware
The intrinsic greedy human nature.  I invested out of greed and probably will do so again.
There is more to it than greed; biology.  Specifically: eat, sleep, reproduce. And, in this context, security is required at every step.  Bitcoin *decreases* the effort required to provide this security; Bitcoin leverages the active participation of the community to secure the earnings of the individual.

EDIT: in fact; bitcoin is a method to secure against all but the most violent greed.
What about the greed of the shorts and their continued and successful efforts to bring it down?  It's a lot easier to scare money out than bring new money in. 
haha so true!  As hard as this correction has been to stomach, i think its going to be just as hard when to sell.  Most ppl did not think 20k was the top, thought it would hit 25/30k before retracing.  What's going to be the next top?  Kind of scares me, i would hate to sell at 50k and then watch it hit 100k, but then again it will also have a major correction after the next run
Just what I like to see in a totally legit investment with real-world uses.
Have you tried Flash bathroom cleaner? - outperforms everything.
Greeeeeeeeeed, I’m sooooo greeeedy
I'd say stocks ->  housing -> bonds -> bitcoin from a pure investment vehicle point of view. Housing would go up a spot if you consider its inherent utility as a place to live and don't buy it exclusively for speculation.

I know you are trying to make the case that Bitcoin is better but:

A- We don't know at this time if it's near bottom.

B- Unless you can time it right or are planning to HODL until the end of times (in that case, what's the point?), it has been historically a very risky investment not really tied to anything valuable or unique. 

Bitcoin should be a coin, not an investment. I know it's not a popular opinion around here, but I firmly believe so.
What a disingenuous question. 

You have no idea what the bottom is for bitcoin and there's no guarantee if will ever go back up.  


Gold coins and something to protect yourself.
made more off of housing and crypto...sooo
I misclicked
cat walked over keyboard ;)
Relax. Too early to celebrate.
Let's wait til we're out of 6k to celebrate lol
r/btc and /r/Buttcoin 
It's called natural selection. Anyone still closed minded enough to not realize the future of Bitcoin and the huge heights to where this is headed will not rise up the food chain.
everyone buying the dip
Please keep your dick in your pants until 6.8k is broken 
i have too many altcoins, but I also hold bitcoin so...um, yeah lol
did you know a pump would come?!
Sell and profit!! And buy back at the dip!
Bought not enough of it.
Never say never.
lol we've seen 5k twice in the last 2 weeks, things are still going down before they go up my friend. Bitcoin is manipulated, when you see the majority of the opinion on Reddit be bullish, the price tanks, because people are selling into the dumb money. Same with December pump. Bullish everywhere. People purchased bitcoin on coinbase, but didn't receive it for a couple weeks. So the majority of the bitcoin being bought by new users, was not liquid. Less supply to buy because they are locked up thanks to slow banking transactions and clogged blockchain network. Futures trading released at the same time. So here you had people with knowledge of the market, and the capital to control the price in a low liquidity market. They knew that the bubble would pop, because they were going to be the ones to pop it. Any amount they lost selling their coins, they made up for in their short. And they knew that they could do all of this, because every possible crypto news source told people to "move their coins into a hardware wallet, away from exchanges (so they cannot sell it), and to HODL, because once again, they won't be selling it. If they wanted to sell it, they would have to transfer it back from wallet to exchange, wait a while, and by the time your coins are on an exchange to sell, the smart money is already done with their move.
Bought it, then sold at 6.3 :-(
Agree.

Frankly, if everyone who's holding BTC now go out and spend 10&#37; of it, it will really make a difference.

By hoarding coins or doing nothing else other than trading on exchanges, BTC is going to be obsolete.

Exchanges, like forex, should only be used <0.1&#37; of the time.  Think about it - how much of you fiat goes through forex?  That's usually only during overseas trips or the occasional purchase over Internet where price is in foreign currency.
someday people will say that souvlaki was worth millions of dollars
Redditors for 3 weeks disagree.
Let’s make bitcoin fun again!
HIV positive?
I knew it too and I didnt sell
Yeah many thought there may have been one last dip before the run up bu that seems very unlikely now that the doors are starting to open for institutional money.
Always lots of people selling when the price is low then everyone buys when high.


Fushigi fushigi
https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/volume/1h?c=e&t=b
Which exchanges?

I feel like the bigger issue is that they don't give you any choice in setting the fee. I recently withdrawn from Poloniex, and they set a 300 sat/b fee on the transaction! With a 1.5 sat/b next block mempool level that's plain criminal negligence.
and if it goes down 5&#37;, you will see people calling Crypto is dead. 
And when it goes up 20% in 48 hours we will all forget about you and your Fud sandwiches 
And down 70% since Jan... 
Yep.  It's July - we're off again :)_
No I don't think so.
Their ignorance is your gain. By the time they get it, you should have amassed a good hoard. 
Get to work fixing misunderstandings! (I usually try but I'm going to bed now)
What are the fundamental aspects of Bitcoin if you don't mind me asking?
Ok
Yes. But you must understand that marketcap doesn't mean anything. It's cool to look at it but not much more
Don't pay attention to market cap for cryptocurrencies, it's not a good indicator of the actual amount of USD invested. Imagine you print a million of your your own $2 bills, give them out for free and sell the last one for $1 to your friend - you can boast a $1m market cap for your new bill. Same applies to cryptocurrencies. 
https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2018-July/016189.html


don't worry, just hodl and you can be that guy some day
but none of us really have excuses for being late getting into Bitcoin, I mean anyone who's 21yo+ and decide to be oblivious to what's going on, that would really be their own faults. 
I hate people who don't hate everything!
The big miners are selling pretty regularly. Their main business model is mining Bitcoin not speculating on future prices. They are fine and they will keep selling like they always do.

Try to build a business and convince people to loan you money which you keep in BTC and convert it when you need it. 

Sure they might even have some &#37; still in BTC but you can be sure that it is not operational money.  

cant he buy miners with bitcoin xd?
Your wish is my command :) 
The only reliable price you should use is from your exchange.

CoinMarketCap is displaying nonsense as it aggregates data from the Chinese scam sites.
What. 
Honestly it makes sense when you margin trade it. Tons of bots and when a few big players come the bots can't deal.
Straight outta *that other sub*? 
Well, for one thing, watchtowers will solve most of the issues. And for the rest I don't know.
and....now they take crypto..
not a scam but not worth it either. All it means is that your ip address was blacklisted (happens to me sometimes when making a new account), basically just change your IP address and make a new account and it should work i think
That's not a scam site; it's the Internet's oldest Bitcoin discussion forum. I think they have some troubles with people using VPNs and/or Tor in order to do "evil" (apparently we can express evil in precise _units_ now, heh heh).

/u/theymos do you have any plans to accept LN payments for this soon? I'm running into the same issues, and with payment amounts best expressed in sats... this is like, the _perfect_ use case for LN (tiny amounts, would benefit from instantaneous payments).
95% of anything related to bitcoin and crypto is a scam. 
Bitcointalk is a well known forum and is mentioned in the sidebar of r/bitcoin. I’ve only lurked there and never joined though.
Weird message indeed. But it could happen. The payment seems too low to be a scam imo.
bitcoin is mined with ASICs
it's a strange coincidence because they have nothing to do with each other
Really? Tinypic.com 
/s?
Sentiment can change really fast with crypto's 
8500 by end of month
Nope. Bot trading going on still. Nothing has changed with regulations or anything else for that matter. It will go back down.
Then short it if you dare.
Slowly...
Words of a true FOMO trader. Sorry you made the wrong choice today. Maybe a lesson is in order for you. 
Relax. Just buy and you will be ok
Did it happen to have a 99% fall from the high?

Also could be that there are no active development teams working on it
Why are you trying to scare people? Seriously.  
In the big picture yes.
Volume and fomo can burn through shorts like a hot knife through butter.
You are mistaken. Those who short bitcoin aren't looking to take it down. They do it for the profit.

Keep that in mind.
I know and I totally agree that there and will be many more legit use for Bitcoin. But greed is a very strong reality.
Ha ha ... yeah as I was typing that I suddenly heard a thousand popular product slogans in my head too.
There is no best investment. Different sectors have different risk and are affected from different parameters. That is why you diversify.

Bitcoin is an investment and a currency. The same is true for the $, Euro or whatever. If you believe it should be different doesn't matter.

If you firmly believe the earth should be flat doesn't affect the shape of the earth.

1. stocks There are 100 of sectors in stocks. 2. housing it complete depends on where you life...
Bitcoin can be seen as an investment until it reaches maturity. You’re betting that it becomes a global commodity. 

Also you should tie real estate’s value to price. Since prices are now once again above pre-crisis levels while incomes remain subdued, it’s not a good investment. 
something to protect yourself= hardware wallet
same I got my notification "BTC is above €5525" at my sell price. so I log into coinbase pro and see BTC at €5711
..

Edit: major
How is 6.6 not out of 6k?
....yikes.
pants off dance off...
Im the man
selling now is insane.
Me too, it’s never enough when it’s that good of a price
Great points, all the signs were there... seems like this was all planned out in 2016 by some market makers. Makes me crazy to think how I was dumb money to “Hodl”.
Edit: but w/ the caveat, “don’t invest more than you can afford to lose”. The PTB have to tell you what’s coming in advance “predictive programming” to protect their karma.
Let's make Bitcoin strong again.
I took the wait and see approach because it went up 10&#37; to 6,300 that is when I sold. So not that big of a deal now that I think of it if it goes back down. 
the doors have been opening for "institutional money" for years at this point. 
We will see, people could get excited and sell back down to $6000 range, or they could get excited and make the decision to hold either I will by back at 6,000< or 7,000. The only way I won't make money is if there is no movement at all.
It was a calculated decision. I saw it jump 10&#37; and I wanted to guarantee I would make that 10&#37; so I sold. I was going to short it if it went back down again. 
Thanks
I just took a glance at kraken, coinbase, and binance and got lost before my patience ran out.
This thread is crypto's absolute truth.
Theres a faq on the right side, if youre not trolling
Supply limit, decentralization, mining, exchanges, wallets, etc. 
Any speculation on how much hard USD is invested in the market?
Yes, when btc is at a million usdollars you can also come here and gloat. Just don't be the guy who says he sold them for 10k haha
Totally... whichever 11 year old that didn’t invest in btc in 2008 is a total plonker
First post in this entire thread that made me LOL while taking a shit at work. Good job. 
of course, but sellers usually exchange it to fiat right away
yes
It is a very good use-case for LN, but right now LN seems too unstable/immature/difficult-to-use, and supporting it would require completely rewriting the bitcointalk.org payments system. I hope that bitcointalk.org will end up being among the first serious adopters of LN after LN becomes generally usable, though.
People need to sell their expensive btc to grt their hands on tons of gpus. thats when it will dump again
but I think most people don't know that.  I think most people think Bitcoin is mined on GPUs


yes... anything can happen. ive become very humble since i got in crypto cuz ive realized i dont understand this market
I dare
Lot’s of $$$ on the sidelines from those who sold high, additionally there are those average joes thinking right now that they could triple their money if it goes back to $20k. How many folks scooped up that $200 BTC in 2014 thinking they’d 6x their cash if it went back to $1200.00? Since that time, BTC went mainstream...
Definitely. Same reason why people sign-up for MLMs, ponzis, and other such schemes. 
Don't be ridiculous. i'm not saying that because I believe Bitcoin should be only a currency, that means magically people will stop using it as an investment vehicle. I just gave my two cents worth of what are the best investment options of all those named. If you want a sound investment advice, bitcoin should only be a footnote in your investment portfolio, regardless of what the price is. 

But hey, It's my opnion. If you think differently, good for you. Godspeed.
I think he meant a weapon
This guy is already reaching for his green paint... 😆

I recommend waiting until 6.8k at earliest 
No I am not. Let it a little over 7k and we both celebrate. I am waiting as much as you are.
Are you serious?
Let's make Bitcoin great again
Binance withdrawl fees: https://www.binance.com/fees.html
Nope.
It was condom
I don't work to one significant figure.
Lol okay, let's not celebrate until we're out of the $6,000 to $6,999.99 range.
Do you not think 6 significant figures is a little over-precise :)  But fair enough.

Trouble is, then folks will be saying - 'we're not out of 7k'
Not when the price pumps $500 in two minutes for seemingly no reason and then trades sideways for the next few days. Gotta make sure this isn't just another bart formation.
