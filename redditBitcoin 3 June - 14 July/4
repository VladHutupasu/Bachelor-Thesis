Daily Discussion, July 11, 2018 -- TITLE
Today's my birthday. Just saying...
no one knows when but the next bull run will a big surprise. 
When bitcoin ETF? 
Seems like the bear market now lasted as long as the bull market back in 2017. Could this be the turnover? 
So I (Mr. Daily Hopium himself) had a moment today when I looked at my overall crypto portfolio and felt sick due to the amount of money I have lost (even on promising alt coins).  It has been a long 6 months.

&nbsp;

Short term predictions from prominent  leaders in the field are not panning out so far this year.

&nbsp;

I have no doubt that bitcoin will succeed in due time, but unless something changes soon, I fear we are in for a long haul ahead. Perhaps similar to the crawl up after the 2014 bear market.  It's starting to feel like that anyway.  Maybe my nausea is a sign that the market will turn around soon.  If not, I don't expect to see a major bull run until we see institutional investment jump on board, or worse, by the halvening in 2020.

&nbsp;

My prediction of $100,000 bitcoin within 3 years (early 2021) still stands, it's just not going to happen overnight in my opinion.  I am still sticking to my plan to hodl and keep buying as I can.  Just trying to keep it real...
these are the kind of interviews that got me excited to buy Bitcoin in the first place. Don't buy Bitcoin just because of price appreciation.  Understand the history of monetary policy and how it works today and why the invention of Bitcoin is important   https://www.businessinsider.com.au/bitcoins-value-solving-the-problem-with-fiat-money-2018-7
Today's gonna be a great day!
Compared to who? Volume is down everywhere
Would you like a beating, bears
Hi, I think btc is freakishly stable right now but in a way maybe that's what it needs to prove its legitimacy as a currency compared to fiat... big fluctuations scare people off very easily. What do you think?
remember : accumulate all the coins you can (btc included ofc and especially alts from airdrops) for when another bull run begins, then you should be golden since everything will rise and you can have even more bitcoin from altcoins :)
Will you sell if it hit 20k?
Will 1 satoshi ever be worth $0.01 USD? God, I hope so. I don't hold much Bitcoin but that alone will take me out of debt. 
*earthquake stops* “Is it done?”
Bitcoin is worth $9k on WEX. Time for arbitrage. Flood that market making profit till supply equals demand. Might take a while to liquidate but the profit is there. 
Not specifically about Bitcoin but about the industry as a whole. Fun read [https://hackernoon.com/mr-market-mr-industry-e87347047efb](https://hackernoon.com/mr-market-mr-industry-e87347047efb) 
Yayyy. Now "traders" dump it again.

It's people in law enforcement in large part who are responsible for all of this bullshit.

Let's investigate them!!

Edit:  I'm never selling even if it goes to zero so blow me.
Damp it 😎😎😎
Next stop 6900
According to the Cboe filing statement, "the Trust will invest in bitcoin only." 

No btrash!!! These high end investors get a confusion free market. Armstrong and Ver can’t hurt the market again like listing Bcash suddenly on a random December 2017 night at $8k. And holding all forked coins. 
We need an ETF so these people pay for fraud and protect the rich institutional investors. 
Bitcoin is not a real currency until the price going down is beneficial for some people. Right now everyone is rooting for the price to go up...so they can sell it to the greater fool. But with a real currency, prices changes benefit people both ways because people actually use it for transactions. It's still nothing more than a speculative beanie baby or baseball card.
massive resistance at 6400 and big buy orders getting eaten up on Bitstamp... bulls have their work cut out for them
Stupid question: all the lightning network clients (lnd, eclair and c-lightning) connect to the same lightning network? What I'm asking is that if I send some btc from lnd's implementation to an eclair addr, will it work?
Hi every one! Good morning. :) 
**Come On England!**
**Bitcoin's Price May Be Charting a Bull Reversal**

https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-may-be-building-for-a-major-bull-reversal/

Bitcoin (BTC) price could create a major bullish technical pattern in the next few days, technical charts indicate.

It's a slightly confusing picture at the moment, however. The recent short-term bullish bias has been neutralized following BTC's close below (as per UTC) the 10-day moving average (MA) yesterday.

Further, the risk of a deeper pullback to $6,000 (February low and psychological support) look to have increased after Tuesday's 5.7 percent price drop.

However, that does not necessarily mean the bears are back in a commanding position, since the cryptocurrency is still holding well above the recent low of $5,755 (hit on June 24).

Notably, BTC could end up creating an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern (bullish pattern) soon if the bears fail to penetrate the immediate support of $6,000 in the next couple of days.

At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,350 on Bitfinex – down 3.6 percent on a 24-hour basis.

View

BTC's close below 10-day MA yesterday has neutralized the immediate bullish outlook.

The immediate support at $6,000 could be put to test in the next day or two, but the probability of a break below that level is low.

A high volume rebound from $6,000 would help BTC chart an inverse head-and-shoulders bullish reversal pattern.

A daily close (as per UTC) below $6,000 would boost the odds of a drop below $5,755 (June 24 low).
Hi. I'm new(ish) to crypto and was wondering if any of you long timers have any thoughts on this issue. Does non-crypto and non-financial related news ever has an effect on the buoyancy of the crypto markets? For example we're nearing the climax of the football World Cup. If for example England were to win, it would apparently create a mood of optimism for the British. Would that also translate to British crypto traders feeling more confident or bullish?
404 not found on the chat links.
Big volume when the price dipped there - v. interesting.
Anyone know why there is a disproportionate increase in the mempool size relative to its number of transactions?

currently at 15MB for just 1200 transactions
Damn this thing getting smashed lol
Gonna be a rough night...

Healthy reverse growth.
This has to be the fucking bottom man....It should go sideways from here
We're gonna fall hard, bulls have given up
Bulllllll runnnnnnnnn
My message got deleted by the mods @ /r/bitcoinmarkets so I'm sharing it here:

> Shorting here is picking up pennies in front of a steamroller. BTC will be above 10K before end of this week and will see a new ATH before end of August. 
REKT gon' give it to ya
Dayman ahhhh ah ahhh fighter of the...
Bitcoin will go to $1,000.


If I had a btc for every creampie I've given. I'd be rich.
Do you think the Brexit situation in Britain and the trade war situation between the USA and China influences this market much?
My friends..
Your beloved Bitcoin is at the mercy of a QT exercise which has been going on for months.
Until this changes you will not see an end to this bear market.
**Footballs Coming Home!**
Who think we are going to see the exact outcome of 2013 when we had almost 90% correction? If not, why?
Happy Birthday.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhdOPhTHeoE
considering very few people who remember that last one will be alive,  yea,  big surprise
When they can exclude Bcash from it and finally kill it off ending the confusion to new investors. 
Yes possibly. Sideways movement for a month now, could easily be bottoming out and reverse direction: [https://imgur.com/JaXDPgv](https://imgur.com/JaXDPgv)
You get trash talked in your comments a lot, but I just want to say thank you for what you do. Labeling your comments as 'hopium' is all the disclaimer you need, and its exactly what I need sometimes. I decided a while back that 2020/21 was my time horizon, I wanted as much wealth as (responsibly) possible in BTC by then, and I'm committed to it. I knew it would:

A) be a very difficult road if BTC went up steadily, and in DEC it looked like I'd barely reach 1 coin ever. 

B) be a very difficult road if BTC dropped hard/stayed super volitile. I'm no trader.

C) be very 'difficult' if BTC skyrocketted before I was ready. Like if I could pay off my house with crypto in 2019, 25 years early, I don't know if I could pass up that opportunity. 

Your hopium makes all three of these scenarios more bearable since I won't be changing my strategy no matter what. It's like anesthesia during surgery. Keep it up, please. 
Don’t listen to tom lee. He’s just trying to keep his job at this point and thinks repeating the same thing will make it true. 
At the end of the year, it is going to be very funny to look back on all the predictions of the pundits, most of whom will say any old wild thing just for another 5 seconds of fame.
All of this rings true to me, and gets me pumped up, but when will the masses wake up and embrace the “people’s currency”?  Hopefully soon, but so many people are just dumb.  
I would like to have a beating bear, are they the new beenie babies.
Meh. It was always rather stable, other than a bubble or ten. 

The real benefit of the "stable" period is that there is no hype to interfere with getting work done.
The past month the price has not gone up or down much, and that is a good sign yes, because up until June, it was basically dramatically changing and consistently dropping. Now that has stopped, so there's a good chance it may change direction again but nobody can possibly know for sure.  
Bitcoin over past month > [https://imgur.com/JaXDPgv](https://imgur.com/JaXDPgv)
Yeah, like all these altcoin winners! http://www.deadcoins.com
Then why would you not just buy bitcoin only and save yourself the trouble of trading? 
If we reach my 'target price', then I wouldn't be buying back fiat.
It's not just the BTC quotation in dollars.

Maybe you have 0.1 BTC, maybe you have 10 or 100 BTC.

It's when the amount you have collected so far, better if just a part of it, can be exchanged for a life changing sum.

(10 years of salary, extinguishing debts, a house).
nope.  I may sell 1 at 50k.
So many made that mistake last time they’ll be selling so fast it will have a hard time getting over it but months later it will push over it
That would make the bitcoin marketcap bigger than the marketcap of all the money in the entire world, so.. no.
Yes, but you will have to wait from 2 to 10 years for one coin to be worth 1M USD.
No one should be going near future Gox 2.0.
WEX will take your BTC and not allow you to withdraw or transfer it. They are gtox in disguise. Google it
 That price is in USD, then when you go to sell the USD for USDT to transfer out it is at such an inflated price the profit you've made from selling your original BTC is gone.  

  
Don't use this exchange, it's so shady.
so much resistance at 64
One share will be roughly equivalent to 25 bitcoin, and only accredited investors will get to play with this particular “bag”. 
Here you go folks. Your daily dose of “reminder”. 
What stone have you been under? People have been successfully shorting bitcoin for months now, isn't that what you'd call beneficial? And if you'd bought the dips and sold high like lots of people did, wouldn't that have been beneficial? 
So was the internet in 1960 now look at it cant go a day without it.
bitstamp has a very low volume
Yes.
Yeah, yeah.. keep on dreaming


So, what I've said, ha? 
Greetings from Croatia
> technical charts indicate

OUIJA board sez . . . .
Much football. Such win. Gotta buy crypto!
unlikely football will have a big impact.

Instead there couls be  larger influences such as dow jones crashing or the start of another recession. Probably bitcoin will fall in such a case given that crypto is a high risk investment

Im gonna go with "what is a lot of really large  transactions, Alex"

https://www.smartbit.com.au/block/0000000000000000001af4c3466d393a29db16ca12462fb540a5fb310b8ab502/transactions?sort=size&dir=desc
Why should it exactly?
Serious question
I think you triggered the bulls.
Funny, that EXACT statement has been made about ...oh ...1000X in the past 3 or 4 years. It must be a go-to statement when looking at the week to week and not the year to year.
I absolutely agree.  We should see $30k based on my hopes and nothing else.
Just don't tell you'll eat your intimate parts if it doesn't happen
Why would they every delete such an insightful and reasonable analysis?
Bullshit
I wanted to believe then I saw the username!  Darn.
> picking up pennies in front of a steamroller.

Very dangerous.  

Sorry, this has got to be done:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_PrZ-J7D3k
Is this anything like the numerous "BTC will be above 10K by July 1" posts?
what a genius piece of analysis. Keep it up, i'm sure I speak for everyone when I say we can't wait for your next words of wisdom
No doubt then you're short with 100x leverage right? ;P   
$1000 and $1000000 are both equally unrealistic... at least within the next few years.
Thanks permit patty
Correct, but when?
Given or eaten?
[removed]
$6,000 is a bear market. Nice. This time next year, will $30,000 be a bear market. 

Yeah it could be if Bcash goes away. New investors don’t like the confusion it causes. Plus a lot will happen a year from now with Bcash creators and Craig Wright will be exposed as a fraud while trying to FUD and short during a 51% attack on Bcash like he described in his talk from February. 
I haven't heard of QT exercise any my preliminary searching is getting me a lot of stuff that doesn't seem related to trading or investing.  What does QT stand for and is there a resource you could provide?

Edit: Do you mean quantitative tightening, as opposed to quantitative easing?
There are many variables that can shake things up pretty quickly, but that sort of coincides with your last sentence.
Do you know about some global disaster that's going to kill us all? Because if not, I'd say we'll be alive to see about 20 or 30 more bull runs in crypto. I know many people are pessimistic, but it's how technology evolves, and this one already has its roots far too deep to be going away in our lifetimes.
As far as I am concerned that would be now. 
I provided the Hopium for myself as much as my audience.   I needed it too.  Thank you for the kind words. 

The only thing that has changed in my mindset is that I think we have a much longer haul to the next legitimate bull run.   I’m impatient because I have probably over invested, because I thought the next bull run might start this summer.   I was misled by others in the media I felt had some credibility and succumbed to fomo. 

Anyway season one of Daily Hopium has completed as of yesterday.   Giving it a rest for a while.  It will be back.  I have not lost hope but trying to be realistic on expectations.  The 2014 bear market lasted years before it mooned.  We could face that again now.  I see many parallels, as I have illustrated in my posts. 

In some ways this is a blessing because I was lamenting that I missed the boat on bitcoin.  Now I might have plenty of time to dollar cost average my way to financial freedom someday.  Yay, I guess. 
I’m going to get downvoted but saying the masses should wake up and understand it’s  “The people’s currency” is hypocritical when most people who buy bitcoin even in this sub do it purely as investment not to use as a real currency. Bitcoin only has value if people actually use it as currency, which people rarely do and this is why it is making no comeback from its recent drop.
Its weird i feel like all the ppl that woke up to this technology have already bought.  Im sure they will wake up once it comes back though 
Only way to beat the bears is to start a uprising
Won't it be inevitably stable (like now) AFTER the entire world dumps all of its money into BTC? IF this happens, then the price will be astronomical for a while, but eventually be completely stable. Is this theory plausible? Thoughts? 
The flip side of BTC mooning is fiat tanking.
Will you sell if it hits 5k? Because that’s where we going to...
My dear oompa loompa, math is betraying you. If one cent equals one Satoshi, then one Bitcoin equals one million USD. All the money in the world is measured in hundreds of trillions. If Bitcoin becomes the world currency, and used as a store of value, one Satoshi will be roughly equal to one dollar in current purchase power.
What are the winning lottery number since you can predict the future.
Not if the dollar decreases in value while bitcoin simultaneously increases in value relative to say fuel or some comodity. Not saying it is going to happen, but it is possible. Say if reserves switch from USD to BTC for example.
My advice dont use any exchange that is not in the US. Learned this the hard way r/LakeBTC lost my bitcoins. I had 2 way enabled, password kyc. Withdraw and deposit history gone, all my btc were gone the only thing left was $31.40. It was an inside job because when I try to log on with my email and password it reads invalid. I didn't change my email and I still receive notices from r/LakeBTC to my email address. So stay away from foreign exchanges.
He's just bitter because he didn't collect Patti the Platypus and Claude  the Crab.  I bet he's got Princess and Valentino (- the bears. ho ho :)
The internet has utility. 
England needed to take their chances in the 1st half, Croatia were the  better team after half time.  
Good etiquette to declare your edits.

You added your Croatia comment after the result.
Buy when England score, sell when Croatia score. Profit! 
Or the other way around. It will consume all the money flowing away from stocks
Well I was talking about the weekly/monhly chart. You can see how volume is drying up in a downward move after an explosive move to the upside.
Everytime you see a dip after a big move up and volume dries up,while the price goes sideways and reamins narrow, that's very bullish.
And I'm talking weekly/monthly chart, I don't care about daily/hourly short term noise.
I see bears stronger because no dumb money is coming in... we need dumb money
I mean today, not forever
For real, thanks to this guy, i'm able to sell my house and buy the dip. I'll rebuy it saturday with an extra house.
😂
Both whatever gives me the crypto gains.
Why are so many of you bagholders also incels?
Spoken like a true piece of shit.
Treat a female right and be loyal to her treat her with respect and she will always have your back. She may be unpredictable but she will never let you down.
I would be happy if we got past $10k again this year.  Tom Lee is sticking with over $20k but I find that very hard to see, I hope I'm very wrong though.
Bitcoin is subject to liquidy, we are in a QT phase, e have been for all of 2018.

It's as simple as that.

[removed]
Next year??? Look at your history I was reading that btc has corrected everytime to at least 80&#37; and passes it previous ath. So if you wait til next year you will miss the moon ride.
$19000 to $6000 is a bear market yes. It's not complicated. The standard used to qualify a bear market is 20% fall from peak..  It has yet to be seen if we have reached lows in this bear market and are now basing for a new bull run or if there are new lows to come.
Based on my comment above I believe we will see new lows as long as QT continues.
That's really funny.

Let's get real.  BTC can disappear tomorrow and 99.99% of the world will just shrug.
That Blockchain survives and thrives means utterly nothing for BTC.
there was only one internet bubble
I will use it as a currency when it achieves my target value (to buy house i want) If it will not be possible to do it using BTC, i will sell it for cash and then buy it with cash.
I use it as a currency whenever possible and hope to do so more in the future when retailer adoption increases.  I also want to see my investment increase in value.  So it is not hypocritical when I write it, because I mean it.  Maybe it would be for others...
So does gold have to be used everyday to have value? So what about countries that use their currency on a daily bases but the currency losses it value how do you explain that. The dollar or any currency controlled by man is hypocritical. They make the low denomination bills easy to attain and the higher one harder to attain. So it a dollar is worth a hundred dollars then it should cost at least a hundred dollars to make right? Is not then that would be hypocritical.
That’s what I mean. Only a tiny percentage of the world has woken up at all.  And an even smaller number understand the importance of this technology and only care about price. 

We have a long way to go.   
and after all the coins are mined, etc. 
That would be the scenario after Bitcoin takes hold as a legitimate alternate currency, but this will take years of course.
Will you buy if it hits 20k ? 
That’s the signal of reversal. When all the noobs sell the absolute bottom of the dip. 
The Bitcoin network with it's security, stability for 10 years, millions in hard and software, mining revenue, investment, exchanges, job creation, and global infrastructure developing at an unprecedented rate, and I could go on ...is not a utility? We need to redefine how we measure value when it comes to bitcoin because it's a new entity. But one things is for damn sure - Still claiming it has no value is far more ignorant than buying it.  
As a system of accounting with it's defined scarcity and mathematical attributes, bitcoin has massive potential. This is a VERY early stage to evaluate it though, because with technology growth, we rarely consider the innovative solutions that we haven't thought of yet. In Bitcoin's case this involves user friendly entry points, wallet address translation, layers for scaling and much more.
Yea now. Thats not what they said when it first started.
Croatia always play like it is 8 a.m., not p.m., and they need some time to wake up.. but when they wake up, then... well.. 
nope. Money will go into bonds and safe assets like gold silver. Bitcoin is not a safe asset relative to stocks. It is a risky asset.
Well, better start buying then. 
Oh OK, then maybe so but unless you have a large amount of disposable income to short BTC and try and time this unpredictable market, holding a modest amount for long term gain is the best way to remain unaffected by these day to day moves. Those big green candles have never occurred in a predictable manner. In fact, they usually occur when least expected because they are are not a result of volume, but rather big money that was bet against shorts. So ...basically manipulation lol.
feeeemales
That's very debatable! 
Tom Lee's credibility has been shredded in case you are not aware.
It is off-topic, specifically because the original subject wasn't even tangentially related, despite trying to be hyperbolic.

It's also a subject that has a tendency to derail conversations and bring out the worst in people on both sides of the spectrum.
[deleted]
Or ..........  Bitcoin may moon tomorrow and .01% of the world (hodlers) will become very rich. 😛
The dot com bubble shares far more with blockchain than it does with Bitcoin. Similar to the dot com era, many companies associated themselves with blockchain to get a quick value lift to lose it again later since the value was based on technology that was not actually implemented.

Bitcoin however, is more or less, money. Nothing carries more weight than money and Bitcoin's potential to be a reliable accounting system, currency, store of value is exceptional. It simply needs a few years like all tech for the value to be realized by the masses. The ironic thing here? It's that those who work in finances rarely embrace creativity and imagination... this is a statistical personality trait of most accountants. So it is actually those who work with 'money' and finances that are the last to envision what Bitcoin actually brings to the table.
and Bitcoin has had several already so what is your point?
There was never an "*internet Bubble*"... You are referring to the Tech Bubble at the end of the 90's. That was a Bubble provoked by investors who came up with the idea that adding a website to a company, somehow made the company more valuable in the market...

They were obviously wrong... 
No wrong.   
The idea that your money/contract/IOU should be worth as much as it takes to print is literally pre-dark ages thinking.

The domination of the bill and its rarity is DEFINITELY not why you have less high denominations. It's because of value.  
The idea that a currency should gain value because people use it is just as backward. Deflationary currency IS A GOOD THING.  
Gold is not a currency anymore. It is a store of value for people with too much FUD about fiat.  
A national currency has a certain value for SO MANY MORE reasons than a store of value and a medium of exchange. It is literally the hopes and dreams, pensions and tax breaks, investments and welfare, infrastructure maintenance and space science funding.
The estimate for the last Bitcoin to be mined is 2140 based on the block reward halving frequency of four years. I totally believe in holding for a long term because it's pretty obvious Bitcoin will one day be worth many times more than today... but 120+ years is beyond my hold time lol.
one good thing is that all those that bought at 20k are not going to be selling anytime soon.
It has value when merchants are willing to accept it in exchange for goods and services.  Otherwise, the value is $0 regardless of whatever features it has.

As of now, the only place where BTC has any value is on the exchanges.  Take that away and it's worth $0.
Anyone who likes to bet knows the utility of BTC well.
So it's an electronic beanie baby.
I think France will win the final though.
Money funds would like to have fast profit, there is only one asset that can outperform anything else.
i've heard arguments that bitcoin is superior to gold due to its hash rate and known fixed supply and public ledger. 
Yes, go ahead
I would disagree to a certain point, it's not the end of 2018 yet, still a very long way to go.  He's got things very wrong this year so far but it's not over yet. 
Doesn't change the fact that BTC is irrelevant to 99.99% of the world.

Nobody cares about it except for the speculators and zealots.
Is this pasta? It should be. 
Literally all this account does is post FUD in r/bitcoin.
That's called a bubble and it's currently in deflating stage.
but it's about the tech. not the dollars. lol.
I do agree that by design, it is good to be used as a currency.

Except there is very little acceptance so the whole point is moot.

BTC = OS/2.  Great tech but ultimately useless.
Those who work in finances are afraid of change, they have been doing it this way for years so when something new comes along they say it ridiculous. But if you look at all the big companies moving to technology to run their business it just a matter of time before they adopt bitcoin in those everyday activities. 
nope,  those were pre-bubbles,  kind of like pre-cum
I am referring to the tech bubble that started around 1997 and ended 2001,  commonly referred to as the 'Internet Bubble' at the time.

That bubble was about how to invest in this thing called the Internet.   The first stock to explode during the Internet bubble was Netscape.   People thought,  you really need a browser to use the internet,  so this new company that is IPOing now sells a browser (and a server but no one cared),  so this must be the hot new technology.   That started the Internet bubble.

Hardware stock,  Sun Micro,  Cisco etc.  started bubbling about 6 months later.   Then came the Amazon and eBay IPOs in pretty rapid succession.  When they took off is when the nonsense internet business started,  WebVan.com being my favorite disaster (5 billion raised in an IPO,  evaporated in 18 months).  Pets.com was a favorite because they had a great mascot and good commercials.  

There was never any real examples of people putting 'dot com' at the end of their business name and it doing anything,  just really stupid ideas for businesses built completely around a 'website'. 
Well I was talking about money being hypocritical and how you can print any denomination and give it a value without any reasoning. And how you dont need to use gold everyday for it to have value. Why use a fork when I can use my hand instead?
Right, but over 99&#37; mined by 2036.  [https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled\_supply](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supply)
Truthfully, I bet most of them already panic sold and are on here daily saying "past performance does not indicate future results"

That's funny - What you've done here is called contextual evaluation. I can say that the first rocket launched in space was a piece of crap and worth nothing because it crashed and burned. So I guess that makes rockets useless? I mean who cares if they improved the rocket by testing it under various conditions and implemented countless solutions to its early issues right? Let's just say it was worth nothing and completely dismiss the stages any innovation goes through to get to its optimal state.
This is comically wrong. BTC makes a lot of international transactions very easy that would be difficult or impossible otherwise.. and they're most certainly not happening on exchanges.
To you, because clearly your benchmark is a beanie baby. I get it, we create analogies from what we know. For me however, it's an accounting system based on math that can contribute a great deal to society, currency, and finances. I'm simply aware that these things take time...they always take time. This is money we're talking about and that shit don't change easily.
I would say more like apple in it early stages. 
Yeah, yeah... keep on dreaming 
Please.

During a crash most people won't think about profits. Only about saving money. As such, risky assets like Bitcoin would be dumped first, causing the price to drop, causing more people to doubt and dump it, and so on - a regular stock crash pattern.

It might behave in an interesting way afterwards, but during one expect nothing surprising.
Not yet
elaborate please
Did you mean me? I'm pretty sure I've been pro Bitcoin for most of my comments... cause I am :)
So what I dont get is when bitcoin goes down people call it a bubble and compare it to the tulip craze or the beenie babies. But did the beenie babies every come back and be worth more than current years or did the tulips come back and be worth 100x more no. But bitcoin has. So when you pop a bubble how is it able to inflate again. So its would be a correction. Think about a balloon if you have way to much air you can let some out and if you have to little air you put some in you balancing and correcting the air in the balloon, but when it pops thats it game over.
Well if someone say they are not in bitcoin because of the technology well they are definitely not in it for the money.
You fudsters are the only ones saying it’s just about the tech. You’re trying to attribute that to the hodlers as an object of ridicule, but in reality almost all the hodlers on here that care about the tech are also hopeful that early adoption of said tech will make them rich. 

You’re not fooling anyone. 
Premature.
How could you possibly expect any more acceptance than there already is. It just HAS to take longer, much longer. We don't even have an easy way for non technical people to purchase it yet. Early operating systems had no graphics, folders, mouse, nothing but code. Only geeks could even use them. Now everybody has GUI's on personal computer devices...several of them for each individual. Bitcoin is the one that will be always worth upgrading and improving. Even real estate purchases have been made, so imagine in 3 years, 5, 10. You have to admit you can see what's coming with mass adoption. It's extremely obvious.
Because they serve to lubricate the real entry and birth of a massive technology. I can live with that analogy sure.
That's why I think it's important to use those lessons from the past to focus on finding the things that aren't just "we took X and made it a token!".

There's a reason I hate both sides of the moon/zero debate.

Distributed consensus is a *real technology* with *real capabilities* and it has *never been done before.* No, that doesn't mean Bitcoin is worth 1 million bucks each (sorry about your dick, John). 

The shrewd investor who does her research during this time could be *very* wealthy in 15 years.
You're fairly accurate, but let's not be fickle over the details. Based on what you just said though, you MUST see the comparison to ICOs and not Bitcoin right?
> There was never any real examples of people putting 'dot com' at the end of their business name and it doing anything, just really stupid ideas for businesses built completely around a 'website'.

how about worldcom? they were a good one. but yeah, WBVN takes the cake. had to make a lot of phone calls after those two fell apart.
You do get that the value of a note is NOT determined by its material and printing cost right? 
It's crazy, but it's math! :)
Very true.
Well, just ask any shop that does not accept BTC what you can buy with it.  The answer is nothing so it's worth $0.  

You can talk all you want about how wonderful the tech is but I'm sure the shop keeper won't be impressed.
I have no doubt that it simplifies international transactions.

But please do name me just one major merchant that accepts BTC for international transaction.
:) 
BTC did move upwards during the correction in the stock market a few months ago, but obviously a full crash would be a different situation.

No way. Ur posts are legit.
it's a joke at this point. crypto heads are tearing each other part, it should be a unified front. considering how "important" the block chain technology is supposed to be, the vision should be clear, but it just gets more murky by the day.
well, I was having a laugh. sorry you didn't.
Dude, I have been in this since it's early days.

And I will tell you that it really was useful as a currency in the past.  Now, it's just a digital token traded on exchanges.  Not even my old suppliers accept it nowadays.
I meant more like 'Blockchain Iced Tea Company',  no outright 'just add dot com,  but not really be in any way dot com related'
WebVan spent 5 billion dollars on delivery vans and warehouses,  all based on a business model with one simple flaw.  They assumed orders for groceries would be delivered evenly throughout the day.  In fact all of the initial orders were for deliveries at 5:00 pm,  when people got off work.  Turns out they just burnt gas waiting in rush hour traffic,  and throwing away groceries that could not be delivered on time.  It failed so fast it wasn't even funny,  I think they operated like 3 months maybe?
wouldn't a crash possibly come with the crumble of fiat? Then what?
Hm?

Set for one year, compare. Both crashed and recovered more or less in unison.
lol, what text do you think was copied here? Just to be clear, I believe in zero tolerance for plagiarism.
Hard to have a sense of humor while you watch your portfolio whittled down lower and lower everyday. No thanks to the fudsters, shorters and manipulators who are suffocating a promising technology. 
i remember people excited about it. scary stuff.
That's not likely. Fiat is not going anywhere anytime soon. Trust in it might waver, it's use might diminish, but it won't crumble for several generations at least, and that assuming cryptocurrencies do succeed.
Indeed, got my memory mixed up somewhere. 
No text, just the way you phrased it.  Set my spidey sense off.. like I wasn't sure if you were being serious or joking, especially b/c there is so much trolling on this subreddit. 
Dude, all I said was that 99.99% of the world doesn't care about BTC.  Isn't that what you have been saying all this time as well?  That we are in the "early stage" of adoption?

And why are you crying about your portfolio when you have been preaching all along that we should all take a "longer term" view of the future price?
sorry to hear that man. I've lost a lot (not in crypto) and gained a lot (also not in crypt). life's a journey, just don't forget the lessons you learn along the way.
Got ya...yeah I was slightly trolling. I have no real intention to bet on some future event with a stranger. Just having fun chat. Me and that guy always take opposite sides. I actually enjoy it, he offers solid arguments from an investment perspective!
Of course we should take a long term view.   I’m not selling.  I’m just impatient.   But even so, I was hopeful we would be further along by mid year and we are not.  So now I feel like we are really back in 2014.
