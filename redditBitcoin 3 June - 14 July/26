Daily Discussion, June 19, 2018 -- TITLE
FYI /r/Bitcoin has a couple chat rooms now. The second chatroom is dedicated to BTC price chatter. Come say hello.

Mempool unconfirmed transactions spiked from 1k to 11.5k in the past 24 hours hmmm. 
BTC price dropping after an exchange getting hacked is like the dollar dropping after a bank robbery - it makes zero sense.
Daily Hopium (part 2):

**"Here's the pep talk the CEO of bitcoin exchange Coinbase gave to new hires about the price dip: 'People are irrationally pessimistic'"**

&nbsp;  


>"When there is hype, people are irrationally exuberant. When there is despair, people are irrationally pessimistic. Neither is true," he continued. "Reality is always somewhere in the middle, more correlated with real usage (transactions per day) than the price."

My mortgage company requires the transaction statement to include some simple items

- account activity
Every other financial institution I’ve encountered provides this on their website.

Gemini’s “transaction history” excel sheet DOES NOT meet those requirements. Customer support said they can’t fulfill my request and doesn’t plan on implementing that feature.

If the market can handle the Bithumb news when it hits mainstream media, I'm bullish. Until there's a bigger hack. I don't get it, it's really not *that* hard to design a reasonably secure system, unless you're attacked internally.
I'm sorry but... i still beleive that Bitcoin is going to the moon I still believe I hodl even though I bought my Bitcoin at 9k I still believe.
Hi, I am a total newbie to cryptocurrencies, but someone who would like to sell me something over the internet wants me to pay in bitcoin. Is there a way to purchase something with bitcoin, but either not have the money released until I receive the item as advertised or force a refund if the product is not satisfactory? Thanks.

Bitcoin minimum $100,000 by 2019
Everyone that bought bitcoin in Dec and Jan this year should just sell up and fuck off.

$5500 by Friday anybody?
Bitcoin has reached bottom. Everyone thinks they need a whole coin and still don’t understand you can buy partial. The lower it goes, the more people enter and brag to their neighbor they have bitcoin. 
It’s not dropping much further. 

We now wait on the devs to make the technology useful. 
The next generation who will really use it can’t afford it (the way they think) but if the devs get a better UI and better way to store rather than coinbase which is mind numbing how they anyone could store on an exchange! 

When hardware Lightning wallets sales start to pick up, we are there. Current generation can’t think about that but their 5-7 year olds will when they are doing banking in school via lightning wallet apps. 

And I hope moms get their daughters into Lightning wallets so it’s not 95% male and all can partake in this decentralization. 
Told you guys will never see 7k again

i was feeling very optimistic about this being about the bottom.  hadn't checked out Tone Vays for a while and decided to watch his analysis this morning and man he just killed my buzz.

Also heard but haven't verified that futures markets need to be over 100 billion?  So if bitcoin crashes i wonder if futures would be over?  Wouldn't make much sense now that CME and CBOE invested in it

Speculative market.

Also to add crushes confidence in the tech side of things. People will look at it and go this shit ain't safe
And the exchange says they will cover the funds.  But maybe the story is bigger, I don't know.  The mempool is certainly more interesting too with someone paying high fees to move bits fast.
No, it doesn't make sense from a logical perspective.

But this is an emotion driven market.  And when the selling point BTC is security and a hack happens, people see this as an 'invalidation' of BTC's value proposition.

We can argue all we want that it is technically inaccurate but most BTC owners are not technically proficient enough to understand.
Bitcoin going from 900 to 19,000 in a year made zero sense.  If it were truly a FOMO, then it would make sense for it to head back down to the 1k level as the only ones still buying are delusional.

Move your cash to your bank account and hold it for 90 days. You shouldnt need to proce where it from after that.
jajaja, no one is buying bitcoin nowadays.
kek
For all this article's talk of hoarding, hodling prevents you from increasing your stake because it makes you unwilling to sell because you didn't do it at the peak. If you really want to hoard, you should sell as soon as a downtrend is established and buy more coins with the same money once an uptrend is established again.
Not really because most of us got in at well above 10k.  I probably speak for the majority of us by saying if today was our first day in bitcoin we would be so much better off.  
Kind of wish 2015 would come around again, but it's a double edged sword as I didn't invest back then and only started in Dec/Jan this year and now sitting at a 50-60&#37; loss my funds are tied up so hmm yeah.. lol.

Moonshot please then we can cash out and go back to 2015 prices for a while :)
Go fill up your bag.  You will be holding it for a long, long time.

Hey Cabron!  Are you still here?  You need to sign off reddit, because  you're giving bad advise.
Bulls defending support stubbornly so bears let them have their pump so they can reload their shorts at a higher price. Pump volume is anaemic when bears reserve their volume for dumps.
Don't listen to this volume shit, every time people say "volume is high guys its going up" don't realise the high volume is from people selling, driving prices down.
Or unless the places being hacked are in cahoots with the hackers.
Markets respond to this stuff before it hits the news. In fact, the people who watch the news are the last to find out about it.

Bullish in the long term is sensible. Bitcoin will bearish in the immediate future regardless of this news.
It's likely a scam.
Highly doubt that, unless some company offers a middleman kind of service. Once you make a btc transaction, and it gets confirmed, theres no way of getting it back.
In terms of setting aside the Bitcoin on a website and not having it released until you get what you are exchanging it for, that's how the website localbitcoins works, but there you would be selling the Bitcoin for money. I don't know of any way of doing that by exchanging Bitcoin for goods, especially independently. I would not pay for something over the internet in Bitcoin unless I trusted who I was doing business with, because once you send them your Bitcoin, there's nothing you can do if you don't receive what you were buying.
You are looking for a trusted third party to act as escrow.
Always use an escrow company , unless of course this is about a winning lot ticket or an inheritance...from Nigeria.
I've looked into escrow services and haven't really found any that people say are reputable.  BUT, if I was a seller I wouldn't want to use one.  He's just as likely to get ripped off as you are not using one.  If it's in escrow, it's not released until you say you received the merch.  You can easily lie and say you didn't get it.  Or at least make it a pain in the ass for him to get his bitcoin after you received you merch.

When women mass adopt a tech, it's normally an effect of success, not a cause. The same thing happened with computers, the internet and smartphones, predominantly used by male tech enthusiasts until they became cheap enough for the average household to afford them.
Perhaps you should read a little more widely about payment systems.

When you do, you will realise that BTC is a dinosaur.

Edit - Here's a good starter read.  This is what banks are scared of, not BTC.  Adoption - $12.8T of real world transactions (not exchange trades).

Even if you're bearish that's not a good prediction to make. It's plausible for it to retest 7100 if only for the purpose of reloading shorts.
Haha, people are still bullish!
...and water is wet. Everybody knew that already, so no cookie for you.
One pretend pump can't stop the death spiral. 
If they bought in October 2017, they're still above water.  So this comment makes no sense.
They're very stubborn if they're insisting on selling at a profit. If they're serious about getting their money back, they should cut their losses and buy back in lower after the current bearish trend has played itself out.
Why do people listen to that retard? 
well funny you say that, I posed a question earlier

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8sba5e/back\_to\_basics\_if\_im\_wrong\_please\_say\_why/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8sba5e/back_to_basics_if_im_wrong_please_say_why/)
Show us the tx or fuck off.
Still waiting. Idk how you guys deal with this shitcoin 
Good news guys. A little over an hour later and I have 1 confirmation. Only another hour to go!
Haven't tried that. Maybe this works. https://www.reddit.com/chat/r/bitcoin/channel/872992_d38a28dd2ee2efae707c89ce6491650e4a1bc078
This. 

It hurt the reputation however safe the BTC network may be. The chain is only as strong as it’s weakest link.

Also the bank have insured their fund, so after a robery, they get their fund back. And if a bank go bust the saving account are insured up to a certain amount so if you’re playing safely you should not be out of your money.

If an exchange go bust, most probably the customer will get nothing. 

However it seems that exchanges have a higher security than before and most of the fund are on cold wallet, so only a portion of the BTC are really on a hot wallet for daily transaction. If they have the funds to cover the loss of the hot wallet, they could potentially be able to reimburse their customers from their own pocket (through the fee they got previously and continuously). Or maybe they’ll be insured. Once customer knows their fund is safe and insured, working on an exchange will be safer than secur NG your own private key.

Securing your own private key equate a the moment to bury deep your stash of money and storing the treasure map either mentally or securing the treasure map. You could fail to secure your treasure map and never be able to access your fund anymore (forget the seed, loose the private key) or having the treasure map stolen from someone close or having your house burn down, ... their is so much more possibility to loose your coins then to loose your fiat.

Unless you are living in a country with hyper-inflation, then you have a bigger problem at hand because you have more chance to be knifed for your grocery bag than thinking about crypto.

We are still at a really early stage for the masses, but I’m sure thing will get into an equilibrium. But the equilibrium might be either at a price that you won’t like or end up being ungodly rich. Nobody knows the future and anybody pretending *insert ticker* will reach * insert absurd number * by * insert any date * is a biased person that would profit of such prediction and hoping his prediction will be right because he’ll cash out for fiat at that point and forget about crypto.
Bithump released a tweet saying they're changing their wallet system. maybe they're paying high fees to get the remaining btc secured ASAP? 
DANGER Will Robinson!!!    I once read a catastrophe scenario that had as it's first warning a spike in bitcoin fees as the rush to exit begins!
It make sense when you do not dismiss the possibility that most of the price gains were through Tether price manipulation.
Found the retard guys
woah dude
If you're selling I am buying
That´s a great true, I feel the very same. 
I’ll take a slow decline over a sudden drop anytime.  The Dow lost its gains for the year today.
I think it unlikely you haven't dropped in value. I have substantial equity investments, I am down around 0.8% from when I last looked (1-2 days).
haha, that's funny. That's how speculation works, you've got to have hope.
Bitcoin wasn't hacked, an exchange was hacked. If you hand over control of bitcoins to a third party, you are now placing trust in them to look after them and hand them back to you when you want them. If you hold the key securely yourself, nothing at all can happen to them. 

bitcoin was made to eliminate trust in third parties, people who hand control straight back to them by sending their coins into an exchange forfeit the extra security bitcoin provides. 
This is just another example of the financial system failing.  Bitcoin wasn't hacked, bithumb was(allegedly).
it's really that simple. I try to explain that to people, they just don't understand seasoned money. they can't wait 90 days on saved money in a checking account. it's like it's foreign to them to not spend every dime in your checking account, all the time. I hear "30 days is enough", "this is rediculous"..... over and over again.... well, talk to Fannie and Freddie.
Thanks, I wish I had thought of that at the beginning of this process. Didn’t think we’d find a place so quickly. 
Gemini’s been very responsive. The second time I contacted support they gave me instructions on how to set up “read only access” to my account for auditing purposes. 
Jwj
That would be nice, but when bitcoin gets over 100k it won’t matter all that much if you got in at 12k or 6k.  You’ll still be enjoying some amazing gains. 
Lol, no wonder there's so much negativity towards BTC on this sub.
I also got in late - January 2018 sitting on some fat losses but mitigated by some lucky altcoin gains. 

I am waiting for at least 100k bitcoin to take some profits to pay off some debt. Then I plan to hodl all the way until this thing is in the 300k range or higher (~ five years in my prediction). 

Hopefully at that price point adoption and lightning network will be a lot better and maybe there will not be much of a need to “cash out”.  The ultimate goal would be to pay for everything with crypto. 
Looks like the same ol shit to me.  Although I would love to be wrong.
this is good for bitcoin
I am thinking that as well, but I am seeing on Google that there does seem to be bitcoin escrow wallets, so that could possibly be a safety measure. I'm just a bit confused on how anyone buys anything on a dnm other than just by crossing their fingers and hoping for the best. 
Hmm, I'm looking at bitrated right now. Do you have any knowledge of its services and reputation? 
Yes. I believe I am. If not for this particular purchase because I am getting the vibe the person is a scammer, but for any other future purchases I'd like to protect myself as much as possible. Google seems to be telling me an escrow wallet is the safest. Any advice on that? 
I contacted the person and said that is what I'd like to do. I'll see what their response is. Thanks. 
nice joke

I know thats what i thought too, didn't really have time to get into details, but they are clearly not into it.  The reason i shared this was to give a real world example of where ppl's heads are at.  I think there's a lot of people who bought in without understanding and believing in the the tech and now they just want their money back
Maybe they actually bought BITCONEEEECT.

Ultimately, it's the security of the entire ecosystem that matters, including exchanges that allow trading.

This argument that 'BTC itself wasn't hacked' holds no water for people who lost their coins.
well you could have twice as much BTC...;) hah, i know what you're saying though.
Have you ever heard the saying "it's like watching a train wreck in slow motion"?

Just wondering...
I hear that loud and clear!
I'd look for a different seller. Seems like you're setting yourself up to be scammed if you continue to look for ways to make this trade happen.
There are a few trusted traders on this site that can provide an escrow service. Eg u/camku, u/cryptosnake and u/eliteluxurytrades. They all have tonnes of good feedback.

Ensure you’re speaking with the correct user ALWAYS (eg if you move to discord/telegram etc).

On another note, if you’re already getting a bad feeling about the seller, let it go.
No wallet will answer whether a package has shipped.  The escrow decision is for a human.
Think u spelt that wrong. Believing in tech aka try to get rich quick and on to the fomo train 
I will be right there with you rolling in agony. I would really hope it never happens as I'm invested from Dec 2017/Jan2018 like a mass hoard of other people.. I'm holding out though, I didn't  run away, my knuckles are white with the death grip on my crypto :)
bitcoin is a shitcoin with no use other than buying other coins
If bitcoin is a shitcoin then everything else is a scamcoin.


I’ll take the 70% dip that I’ve had months to trade on.
finished at +1.42%. I'll take it.
but this isn't star wars.
They chose to store their coins on an exchange rather than their own private wallet. They're naive if they didn't know that was the risk they were taking.
Sure, if you are a negative person by nature that lacks vision, I can understand how you could feel like that.  Cheer up. If you have the grit to hold through this bear market, you will be happy you did.  
I think you are right for this particular purchase, but even for future purchases I would still like to attempt to protect myself as much as I possibly can. 
^ this.
I wouldn't use a service like [Escrow My Bits](http://escrowmybits.com) to act as an escrow that would only release the money when I give the ok? 
You need to step up your trolling skills.  At least call it shicoin core lmao
yyawwnnn
They're all scamcoins. 
Ok, so you prefer 70% "dips", but don't like 1% "sudden drops".  Got it.  That makes sense. 
+0.26% for me.  

I'm just glad that it's positive after a rather challenging day.
I agree.

But look at the people coming here on a regular basis asking basic questions like what's a wallet and how to move coins.

That shows that are people who really don't know these stuff.
This isn't a Disney movie. Reality doesn't always deliver a happy ending. Don't invest more than you can afford to lose and don't postpone repayment of existing debts to put more chips on the table. 
Scalability? energy consumption? downgrades by big money bankers previously hot and heavy when "most of us got in well above 10k"? (edit) oh yeah, the regular occurrence of the gutting of exchanges by hackers/insiders?

think positive ... think positive ...   did you know, Scientologists (think they) can move things with the power of their positive thinking?
Just my personal experience here, I've paid for multiple things using bitcoin (private torrent trackers, serverhosting etc.) and it worked flawlessly. However, you do have to trust the other party to fulfill the transaction promise as you have absolutely no way to retaliate except stop doing business with them.
You may, but if you say the wrong item was shipped then does the escrow service stiff the seller, or does a human investigate?
lol that was pretty good 
$£€ are even worse scamcoins because they are controlled by very few people.
Those percentages do not represent the same amount of money.  The Dow lost more today than bitcoin has all year.

I have time to make decisions with a slow decline instead of getting fucked in the ass by the sudden drop.  
Despite being the President of the ECB, Mario Draghi does not have the power to simple order the injection of Euros into the World economy. Btw, he is against such actions.

Why do you think there were heavy austerity measures in Europe, while the US simply printed their way out?

The ECB does not work like the US Federal Reserve.
So you prefer the asset that sees 5% - 10% swings regularly?  You're not really making a logical argument here. 
What do you think of this 

https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-06-14/ecb-unveils-end-qe-will-reduce-bond-purchases-sept-and-end-2019

It will be exiting to see what happens in 2019

If you lend to the banks and the banks buys the government bonds... you have the system as the US just with one extra step(is that even true..).  AFAIK the ballooning of the money supply is because of the fractional reserve banking. 
Volatility is opportunity.  You’re clearly not a trader.
I have been following the Zero Hedge articles for many years now. I have seen their countless articles announcing doomsday scenarios almost every year. I've grown some scepticism on their *"predictions"*. 

Zero Hedge writers are usually libertarians, Government haters and Gold lovers. It doesn't matter what a government does to keep the economy in a stable position. Zero Hedge writers will always fire the same gun. Hyperinflation and currency collapse. 

These writers don't care about long term strategies. They would gladly see the world burn to ashes if that helped to prove their point.

> If you lend to the banks and the banks buys the government bonds...

The banks don't always buy the government bonds. In fact, that was one of the reasons why Portugal had to request financial help from the IMF. Because the banks inside the country decided to not buy government bonds anymore. 


What about that part where you said you have time to make decisions with a slow decline?  That would be the opposite of volatility. 
On ZH! yes you are spot on.. - I never read them comments there..

It is good to know that some banks don't buy the bonds.. but there is very little risk to it.

Those piigs countries... sometimes I wounder how the EU can maintain a union, since all the countries have so many differences - even if you only look at it financially, some countries does not live up to the minimum requirements for being in the union, but they are still here...

I was talking logarithmically.  Just shut up you’re an idiot.
> It is good to know that some banks don't buy the bonds.. but there is very little risk to it.

Greece defaulted, remember?

> Those piigs countries... sometimes I wounder how the EU can maintain a union, since all the countries have so many differences

For example, Greece has one of the biggest navy armada in Europe, whose material was bought to Germany. So if the Germans wanted Greece to be fiscally responsible, why did they allow those purchases of submarines from the German naval yards? Oh, that's right! Because Turkey is a neighbour country...

Northern countries like to sell things to the southern countries. They also like to have access to great beaches to spend a cheap summer vacations...

You had to live here for some time to understand how Europe works. No borders remember? No need to stop. Cheap and quick flights between EU countries, just show the citizenship card. Erasmus program for students exchange, and many good things which would take a while to go through.
Lol. Ok guy.  Pick a story and stick to it next time. 
There is some internal border control, since the external border control is non-existent. 

But the internal border security is worse than before the  Schengen Agreement.

The EU is not responsible for beach access... and the charter vacations is something airplanes enabled.
