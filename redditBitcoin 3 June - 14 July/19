Daily Discussion, June 26, 2018 -- TITLE
Who is selling at this price except the bots? 😳
Lightening Network is going to go mainstream and the first day of its use will be on Coingate here is their blog.  https://blog.coingate.com/2018/06/lightning-network-payments-intro/
Hold the bloody line!
I'm here for the bitches..
I'll be honest and just say it: I don't give a flying fuck about Bitcoin's technology or its adoption or anything. I just want it to gain in value when I long and lose in value when I short. 

I'm pretty sure almost everybody here thinks the same but they're pretending hard.
I thought we definitely hit the bottom, but now it's starting to look like it's just doing the same crap again. 

Getting stuck at around the same price with low volume, then dipping. Then it goes back up a little bit, giving us false hope, gets stuck on low volume for a while, then dips even lower. It's been doing the same crap like clockwork. And it's starting to look like it's about to do the same crap now. That would mean we'll be going down somewhere around $5.5k.

This old post from 2014 should be read in its entirety, but here is a reply that caught my eye:

Yep, exactly what to do.
The best advice I could give you is to ONLY cash out if you absolutely need the money. Bitcoin is going mainstream, there's going to be a higher demand for the coin, and because of the limited amount it can only rise in value. Just wait, you'll get your return.
My friend bought in the day before the crash early this year, at 120$ per coin, it dropped to 60$ per coin, and within a few months he was up to 250$ per coin and sold them on to me. I luckily bought the day before the massive price surge, and they quadrupled in a week.

Are they the cause, or is it just coincidence, that Bitcoin continues to slide since the intro of futures? 

https://twitter.com/zerohedge/status/1011634990130630661?s=21

I’ve never understood how Bitcoin futures are any different than gambling. Especially since Bitcoin is never delivered if the gambler, I mean investor, is wrong. Is there a difference?
 In March of 2009, U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner let it slip that he was "quite open" to the idea of an eventual move toward a global currency run by the International Monetary Fund. Although many were surprised by this unusual announcement, the idea of a world currency is certainly not a new one. In fact, one of the most frequently cited backers of a single currency is the legendary economist John Maynard Keynes.

I want to find the specific date when "Daily Discussion" became synonymous with "Trying to joke about Bitcoin's  price"
Hey! This is starting to bum me out!
Back in Dec'17 when Bitcoin reached its ATH, an older coworker of mine ask me if it was worth investing in. I'm so glad I told her it was most likely a bubble and that most people jumped in hoping to get rich quick with no effort. She was not tech savvy at all and was saving up for her kid's college education.

I feel bad for those who managed to convince others to jump onto the bandwagon.
Bcash just fallen < 0.12 BTC

LN genius technology is overcoming the foolish and objectionable opposition.

Long may this continue.
Slowly bleeds
Please change the logo back. This logo looks terrible.

Congestion continues today with there being over 20000 1 satoshi/b transactions.
Short squeeze coming?
Bout to pour one out for the homie bitcoin
It doesn't take a genius to see that these markets are manipulated.  The sell walls that pop up and disappear, someone is driving price down with their huge stores of btc.  My guess is these large institutions that want to open trading desks.  Feel free to tell me I'm wrong.
 I think its funny reading people's opinion on why the price of bitcoin is so low or why it was so high. Well here is my opinion on why the price was high. The price was high because people seen an opportunity to make huge profits on their investments so everyone wanted in and that drove the price up and the earlier you got in the higher your profit.

The price is low because people wanted to cut their losses, and others don't want anything to do with bitcoin because they feel it is a scam. And all this TA and charts are just for show nobody know shit about this they can say they do but even a broke clock is right 8.33&#37; of the time. So until the next big craze if you want to make money off bitcoin you better learn how to day trade and if your in it for the long haul then hodl.
hmm testing $6k resistance again, I don't think it breaks this time!
Glad I sold at 8k still waiting for 4k so I can double up.
[deleted]
Man I looked at the volume and it looks like its about to blow. Hey guys lets have a great day lets stay positive lets see how low btc will go today and comment if you sold or hodl. Because it always goes back up so why stress about nothing.
This thing will tank in Jan..if we cant get back to a decent level, the end of year sell offs will plunge this thing very far down
To $10k soon
I bought a $13,000 Hybrid car with only 26k miles.  Whenever I find myself spending too much time on this thread  or thinking about investing in Bitcoin, I go out and drive for Lyft.  I earn between $800 and $1300 per week with weekly bonuses and will earn around $40k in profit this year.  After writing off $0.535 per mile, I will have a very small tax bill on that profit.  I work Lyft around my regular work hours (I own and operated an online business as well as a wholesale business).  So by not wasting too much time on this thread, I am turning a $13k investment into $120K over the next three years.  Plus the stress of owning Bitcoin is not taking a toll on my health.  Just some food for thought.
Even though we've seen red way more than green these last few months. I get the feeling this is the perfect time to accumulate more. May not be tomorrow, next week or month, but we will go up hard I think! Stay positive!
What was the longest period when you guys didn't check the price ? I'm going to start a price check free week 
Quick question: when the last Bitcoin is mined, how will transactions be confirmed in the block chain?

Thanks.
To any pessimists have you sold yet?
Hi, **Can someone access btc if they have the wallet.dat but not the passphrase ?** Or they are safe if my passphrase is in a safe place  ? Thank you

The increase in longs while shorts are dropping and prices still going lower makes me feel uncomfortable.
They sould make it easier for the rest of us. They should have a bear coin and a whale coin and whatever coin is doing good it should reflect how bitcoin is doing. That would eliminate everybody's analysis. Bear coins are selling like hot cakes, buy more bitcoin that easy.

The end is near.

Good morning my friends! I hope you have an awesome day :)
Just sold some. But only cause the rent is due :)
To the moon baby. Don't forget to tell your friends, neighbors, co workers about this awesome opportunity to buy bitcoin at a great discount. 

Buy and HODLLLLLLLLLLLL
Am i correct? In jan 2014 there was an ATH at 1K then it took 3 years before we reached that ATH again in jan 2017, the price had dropped to 200$ in that time frame. If we see the same thing right now (in a case where history repeats itself) we won't see  the ATH before a few years and we could go as low as 4k. 
Approaching a good time to accumulate.
first
This thing has nice support right now it keeps popping back up

Is it normal tha BIT-Z is making now almost 30&#37; of volume in trading of BTC ? 10X  Binance volume... I just never watch it so just asking. [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/#markets](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/#markets)
How many people who bought bitcoin are actually owned by bitcoin?Seems like a lot of people spend every waking moment watch the price of bitcoin,surely all the stress and anxiety must take its toll on health and relationships?
ALRIGHT ALRIGHT YALL I GOT SOMTHING TO CHEER YOU UP! Drum 🥁 roll please ..... “ we buy high , no lie and you know dis!!,💁🏽‍♀️💁🏽‍♀️💁🏽‍♀️ladies, we buy high no lie bitcoin you know this ! 💁🏾‍♂️💁🏾‍♂️Fellas we buy high , no lie, and you know this ladies, we buy high no lie bitcoin he knows this, 550 mint colored Benz me n Jim and the band camp  twins n we blowin out kufi , when I’m stage show me boobies , running on the track call me boobie what you know bout them suicides with the uzis, pew!

Those who want to rebuy at lower prices with an increased position. It's called shorting.
Obviously (a) people who bought at a lower price and wants to take some profit off the table, (b) short sellers and (c) panic sellers who bought at higher price.
People who want to put their money in something valuable.
And to chew bubble gum?
That means you'll either cash out before the true bitcoin ATH since you don't actually believe in adoption. Or you might sell at a loss because again you don't believe in adoption.  Bitcoin is financial freedom disguised as a get rich quick scheme; you need to look at the big picture and realize it really has the potential the change the world. 

We have the ability to send money instantly (lightning network) and semi-anonymously without ANYONE being able to stop us. Also, this money is programmable and we can store it in literally ANY medium, even with just our minds! Do you think society is collectively going to say nah and pass up on something like this? Do you really think this might be just a fad? 
i just spend my cheffing tips on bitcoin each week, ive collected about 40 percent of one since february. i dont care what happens short term, im just going to collect 1 coin and then forget about it for 5 years, or until the news tells me bitcoin has massively increased in value. 
Absolutely wrong !!! I am here to destroy the world!
For the first time in the history of humanity a currency that is not controlled by any government or powerful entity.  Cannot be inflated like paper fiat currency.  Can never be held back from you during a run on a bank or shutting down of atm machines in a crisis. Billions of dollars can be stored securely in a tiny chip that can rest on a keychain and carried around (unlike gold bars).  Smaller amounts on a bar code on your phone.  Can provide you the freedom to be your own bank in complete control of your own money.  And more...  

The price going up and you getting a lambo should be a pleasant byproduct of early adoption.   Please don’t lose sight of the bigger picture of the revolutionary nature of this technology and how it can benefit you and your children and your grandchildren........


of course I'm in it for financial gains, but ultimately i don't want to just cash it out, id love to use it, especially for big purchases like car or house down payment.  
Truest statement here.
Like that one!
[deleted]
That’s good stuff.  Good luck with that 
Adoption and its technology is what drives price. With your logic, you can go bet on ....... “insert here”. 

People tried it and don’t like it. Truth is hard sometimes but the fees were too high and people, especially young, want speed. Lightning and segwit took too long to implement. No need for Lightning now. 
Funny but, that's what you would actually want from bitcoin right ? If the price stays more or less the same, bitcoin actually becomes usable..
It has been doing that same crap for months now. I do not know what makes anyone think that it will do anything different!
Read that part where he says bitcoin is going mainstream.  That was four years ago and bitcoin is still nowhere close to being mainstream.
Sorry, but bitcoin hype has been over for months now. You missed the sell train.
Just about any commodity and currency you can name has futures markets.  They're all doing just fine. The big money thinks Bitcoin is worthless and are taking short positions. That's the market. Not a coincidence. 
Futures, derivatives, even most stock investments (ones where you have no stake in the company and don't pay dividends) are all forms of legalized gambling. 

The bitcoin futures are cash settled meaning no real bitcoin is being traded. They are just speculating (gambling) on the price moving.

You are correct but the government controls it and profits from it so it's oke doke by them. They are investigating manipulation but they are the main manipulaters
I'm imaging something like [this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1dK4mNYiges)
Yes and by then, it will read:

Current Bitcoin Price: $3,847.65
That's me screwed, I'm Jewish.
About the same time it became all about price when so many posters claim belief in the technology.   Blockchain is the technology, Bitcoin is an implementation.  I think that Bitcoin will be around a long time but it will not supplant fiat.   It will hang in for a while due to zealotous belief and hard core followers.   Institutional money is looking at real world implementations of blockchain that can actually fix real problems.  There are better solutions for dealing with finance other than trying to meet the wet dreams of anti-bank or anti-government types.  
Take a cold shower and go to bed
You could have told her at least the truth 
It was below .06 for a long time, so .12 is still pretty good 
The number of people using LN is miniscule. I would like to see LN implemented for all DNMs.
See a doctor.
You mean circlejerking liars trying to make profit from each other while paying entrance fee to this meeting will change anything? :D
I sincerely hope we're not under attack.
Unlikely considering longs are increasing, not shorts.
Just kidding its not gonna go below 6k i think
I also believe there is manipulation going on. What I’m not sure about is who’s doing it;

A) professional trading desks getting ready to jump in when price gets low enough 

B) rich whales or whale groups trying to do the same. 

C) governments threatened by crypto trying to drive price low enough to try to kill it off

D) banks doing the same 

E) bill gates or George Soros shorting the market out of spite. 

F) something else ???

There is also probably some normal panic selling still playing out as part of a bear market 

Edit; 

Also exchanges may be playing the same game as the trading desks 
If you're looking at gdax it's just the arbitrage bots you're seeing
Anything that someone can manipulate, someone will manipulate if there is a chance. That is rule for everything in life, even Bitcoin ;)
It’s called market spoofing, and considered illegal in regular markets. 
I’ve seen it many times... yes, from my perspective, market is heavily being manipulated.. 
having such 24/7 unregulated market with various assets/coins is like inviting cannibals for a dinner at your place.

and?  It's unregulated.  Of course it's going to be manipulated.  Which is a great source of confidence in it yeah?
You are Wrong. 

This kind of manipulation has been going on for some years now. 

[Bitcoin price manipulated from $150 to $1,000 by single actor – researchers ](https://www.rt.com/usa/416036-bitcoin-manipulated-exchange-rate-price/)

Edit: The cryptocurrency markets are unregulated. What did you expect when they reach the billions of dollars in daily volume? Someone had to take advantage of it.
So what?
Manipulation has only been confirmed at the end of 2017 when a massive bubble formed. 
Institutional investors walked away when the SEC declared that cryptos were NOT securities.
it's the reason why the SEC is opening an investigation. They obviously have some evidence which made them take action. 
Lol, “TA is just for show” “Better learn how to day trade.” 

What do you think we use to day trade?
july is historically low for bitcoin btw
Seems like will break anytime soon.
"hmm testing $6k resistance again, I don't think it breaks this time!"

Quoted for posterity. 
Not even a contest
Famous last words
Based on what?
Support 🧐
Thanks for sharing your valueless emotional state.
Calling mid 4,500k in July.
I certainly think so. When people are too scared to buy and talk about the floor falling out of it constantly. It's generally a good time to look at accumulating

That goes for any Market
I'm actually very positive.  It is the growth f the tech that matters - and that is working really well.
Is the volume high? Where?
There's going to be a time that it doesn't go back up. That's just a fact. 
comment if you sold.... f'in lol.... you type reddit, not youtube.... you're in the wrong place.
Just because it happened before doesn't mean it will again.
[deleted]
7k never again. 
That's smart. Having a side Revenue business is one of the best things a person can do
Well thats if lyft doesn't go out off business or something of that nature. Investing does mean guaranteed profits. But good luck in your future endeavors.
And you are guaranteed of a profit, while bitcoin could be $0,004 overnight when the FED releases a Dollarcoin. 
I have a Google glass dedicated to live bitcoin prices.
I managed a month in May. Pretty relaxing. First few days are the hardest.
1 hour.
A day? 

However checking is one thing, stressing about it is another. 
Dude, set up notification at level you are interested to sell, buy, start/stop mining at. Live free from then onward! 
It will never be mined. If you keep halving something (block reward) it just gets really small and never actually reaches zero.
The superintelligent AI managing it with which we'll be communicating via direct brain connection will probably have figured something out by then.
Never
Got out of REQ at $0.18. Better late than never. 

I’ll rebuy if it hits $0.05. 
They cannot, they can only view your balance/trx history but not send or sign anything.
Why?
You must have gotten your hands on some good shit!  Hook a brother up!
For the bear 🐻 
Go home. 
Dude it’s 10 pm at night... You mean good night!
Buy High... Die Low...
(Wasn't that a lot simpler?)
The catalyst of that bear market was a major hack of the largest exchange at the time. Most presumed bitcoin would never recover. Now you have nothing but good news surrounding bitcoin...no way it’s going to take that long to recover. 
Enron's ATH was $90.56. 
I care.
Who cares? I thought this dumb fad of trying to be first to post died out over a decade ago. Get with the times man. 
Lol. Bear flag forming 
> till bitcoiners don't spend some time

*don't* spend some time?

Your sentence construction, embarrassingly, doesn't scan.
Lmao...You need proper grammar
Do not forget that this forum is international, and we all try to speak a comprehensible english :)
Are you sure that isn't the % volume of that pair within BIT-Z?

(I do despair about the lack of clear, unambiguous labels for the data on many sites.  I don't trust Coinmarketcap in any case - shit data.)
Think I just lost ten seconds off my lifespan just reading that nonsense 
Ballin!
That's not shorting. Shorting is betting on downward movement. It doesn't mean you'll be going long after you take your profits off the table. 
Actually, that technically is shorting, i.e., you borrow an asset for purposes of immediately selling it, and the later buy the SAME QUANTITY of the asset back at a hopefully lower price to realize a profit. That, of course, is different from selling an asset now in the expectation that you can buy MORE of it later at a lower price, and thus have more of the asset and greater profits if it rebounds.
The worst 
[deleted]
I keep hearing these rhetorics and most are unfortunately untrue.

I do not see adoption as a currency and the general public is happy with the current financial system.  It's not perfect but it's legitimate and the customer instruments have improved by leaps.  Almost all merchants accept credit/debit cards (and of course cash) and e-payment is also now widely accepted where payment can be made with a simple to use NFC.  National level cross-bank systems now allow transfers between banks that are instant and $0 fee.  Across countries, SWIFT has served us well for decades.

If you want anonymous, just use cash.  And why would I care about staying anonymous when my purchases are legit and I have nothing to hide?

I'm sorry but this whole narrative about cryptos being superior to the current banking system is just a fringe movement that the public is not interested in.
I did this exact thing. Easiest 1000% investment I ever made 
But why do you need to personally hodl and risk savings for you to benefit from the technology and use it? You didn't need to personally own stocks for [pets.com](https://pets.com) for people to benefit and use the internet.

Hodlers want to profit. That's it. People who buy bitcoin and actually use it as a currency, people who bought pizzas and drugs with it instead of hodling for years did more for the adoption of the technology than hodlers.
You forgot to mention that we get to invent as many of these Currencies as we want also
>For the first time in the history of humanity a currency that is not controlled by any government or powerful entity.

That statement alone is at best unverifiable and at worst plain wrong, as there has been commodity money way before any government existed unless you're one of those ancaps that have a very vague definition of what a government is.

\> Cannot be inflated like paper fiat currency 

This one is at least half right. Bitcoin cannot be inflated or deflated through governmental monetary policy but Bitcoin is a fiat money. Fiat money is simply any form of money that has no intrinsic value (like commodity money), it needn't be issued or backed by any government (see: the Iraqi Swiss Dinar, that stopped being legal tender and lost government backing but was still used as fiat currency).

\>  Please don’t lose sight of the bigger picture of the revolutionary nature of this technology and how it can benefit you and your children and your grandchildren........ 

No, it won't. 
What is wrong with using cash?  That's what just about everyone does.

Sounds like we are just trying to create a use case where no such need exist.
You're an idiot. There is no blockchain without bitcoin.  There no incentive for an immutable decentralized blockchain ledger without an incentive token like bitcoin.  

Clearly you have no idea what you are talking about and just using blockchain as a buzzword like .com
Cool now explain why we need more than one blockchain or more than one internet.
^ This is what happens when you snort too much magical blockchain dust that Jimmy Song talks about. 
Yeah, and we should have just given up on internet back when it was 56 kbit per sec because people tried watching video on it and realized it was too slow. We should have said screw going into space after the first ten rockets blew up. You realize Bitcoin is just learning to go from crawling to walking right? It's a baby. When it grows up there's gonna be some serious disruption in the way we finance our shit.
>pens

Looks oddly similar to Bitcoin's chart: http://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/bic-stock
At *some* point it will do something different. 

Question is: When will it be?

I'm out for now, but will get back in when I see signs of a real reversal.

The technology is here to stay. LN is progressing, exchanges are getting better, regulations are getting clearer, institutions are peparing to get in. 

But it might take a while, and the price might drop even further.

But at *some* point it will rally again.
It’s making progress, just slowly. 

2017 was the first year anybody really gave a shit about bitcoin. It started making the news.  Shit, even Glenn beck started talking about it.   By some bad luck I didn’t hear about it until December 2017.   

Replacing a fiat currency system that has been around for thousands of years is going to take time. 
Lol clowns like you sound just as dumb as the fanatics. Like you or they actually know. Quit speaking with so much confidence 
Those other commodities and currencies are often delivered physically to the investor though if their bet falls through right? For example, if you place a future bet on a barrel of oil, you could end up with a barrel of oil.  
Not really we have multiple billionaires that have invested very sizeable sums into actual Bitcoin. Also note the Futures Market tracks actual Bitcoin. 

If they truly felt Bitcoin was worthless why would they be investing in exchanges and looking to set up funds? 
Whaaaaaat?
I pray that it will read $30,847.65
6 significant figures!  I wish I could be accurate to 1 in a million six months into the future ..
Go and cry
[deleted]
how was that not the truth
0.06 was is far too high.

It is a parasitic coin: without BTC's name and reputation it would be worth 10 dollars, like every other shitcoin.  

^edit: ^0.6 ^> ^0.06


The number of people who watch opera is also minuscule (note the correct spelling) - that doesn't make it unimportant.

LN will be massive - only a committed Roger worshipper could attempt to claim otherwise.

My advice: sell your RogerCoin at the earliest opportunity, it is already sub 0.12.

Cheers!   :)
Any doctor accept Bitcoin ?
We are always under attack. There are likely someone always plotting to destroy bitcoin 
Where do you see this?
I have my doubt s about that one :)

We're 7 months into a bear market man, and real bottoms do not give this much opportunity.
[deleted]
Yeah, the volume is fake
if there's a hustle you can think of, there's already 100 persians doing it better than you 
Not really, no.  If people can manipulate the price of bitcoin then they will almost certainly manipulate it to their advantage.  This could include things like driving the price up and down strategically for profit (at the expense of average investors), to nation states or large banks punching the price down to kill the market.  The whole idea of bitcoin was it would be immune to these sorts of things and it's clearly not.
Who confirmed it? Donald? 
That is a good thing 
If it has already broken through $6K, once (which it has) the re-test
is whether it will now hold above $5.8K.  $6K is already a punctured tire.
No different than everyone else saying it will go up.
Thanks for creating reddit account 3 months ago and trolling bitcoin subforms. You musta bought in at ath sad days for you bruh.
Won’t happen
What are you going to do if you're wrong? 
The volume is significantly higher but the price is wedging down.
You'd like to see the volume drying as the price drifts slower lower, until it finally pops with another volume burst.  What we have here appears to represent churning.  If all of this volume represented positive demand, the extra volume should be pushing the price up, sharply.  So it's not convincing me yet.
Yes when the earth ends
Just think what'll happen when the next Chinese New Year comes and the current one still hasn't ended!
I think its tied to people spending a lot for holiday and maybe clearing their books for the new year. Unless christmas goes away well see bigger red candles to start the New year
Unless there is a solar flare... we will see $7k again the question is merely when?

It's a different world today and while multiple revenue streams may not get you a Lambo, it will give you piece of mind and security.  Don't get me wrong - it is a lot of work and you need to be disciplined but I am built that way.
Fed cant win, they would never create an open decentralized permissionless network with finite tokens on a predetermined distribution schedule. If they do then Bitcoin has achieved its goals, and if they dont then they really aren't even competing with btc.
I am old enough to know that there are no guarantees in life but hard work certainly tends to work in your favor.

Most people are stressing atm
That's the theory. 

In practice, [there's an integer limit](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2018/06/21/IntegersAndEstimates.html).

Edit: link
not really, from what I understood. when the last coin will be minted (the 21millionth), and it will, transaction fees will be the reward. we will be dead anyway by then though.
Who will be mining when value is incredibly low and it can only be performed at a large loss?
Thank you

You're wrong; its 15:20 ... good afternoon!
more like the ONLY real exchange, gox had a stupid monopoly on bitcoin at the time. We've learned our lesson and now we even have decentralized exchanges, there is no reason for the price to trade sideways for so long. 
More like, it's dropping despite good news thus it might never recover and actually reach a stable price.
This guy gets it!
Oh wow , that was a major oversight! Thanks for the clarification. 
But you were second.  That is even more lame.
No it didnt die out, If your not first your last.
I care.
Bull flag*
What is bullish and bear flag?
I could not agree more, I am thinking it’s going to dive bomb back to the same low as a couple of days ago.
Or at least not being ignorant to think everyone should speak your language
sure it is the total volume of BTC in the world but it could be wrong from cmc. I will look on paprika.com
> Shorting is betting on downward movement.

Which is exactly what I told bu using different words. If shorters are betting that the price is going down, then they want to short their position so that they can renter later with a stronger position, or re-enter with the same position but at a lower cost.

And yes, they can go long after that. 

What you described is leveraged shorting.
They’re playing with fire 
Not quite as valuable as it was though
I think you need both holders and spenders.  The spenders for liquidity.  The buyers/hodlers help the price maintain its levels and rise.   At this stage, the price rising is needed to draw in more people who are unfamiliar with the technology but are initially interested in price speculation. 

That’s what happened to me.  Someone I knew told me about how they made a lot of money on bitcoin and it drew my attention.  So I invested and started learning all I could about the technology. Now I think it’s a wonderful technology, not just an investment.  I spend it where I can and immediately replace it with new fiat. 

We need more me’s to happen. 
It is the first time in history that it combines all of bitcoin’s features into one.


It cannot be inflated like fiat because there is a fixed supply of 21 million bitcoins ever. 

Thanks for playing

Work on your reading comprehension.

No.  You are the idiot.  Bitcoin is an implementation of blockchain.  The first popular implementation, but an implementation none the less.  One of the more likely implementations will be in contract management. 
Internet developed faster than 10 years
This is too long for this generation. Next generation will love it and we will continue to support it for them but our dream in dead.  Born too soon. 
Bitcoin is about to be taxed by the irs and they will jail the people who didn’t report capital gains just as an example and warning to others. I seen the bill. Bitcoin has not privacy. Andreas lied to us in the beginning and hoped the problem would be fixed by now Last I tweeted him. He can’t promote privacy coins after congress testimony or he can be jailed the system he is trying to exit. Privacy coins are true cash. No trace, no tax, lower supply, higher potential. 
Peace. HODL out. Going to privacy coin. 
Sure. Same as if you bought Bitcoin and didn't settle the contract for cash value. 
Yeah billionaires make bets against billionaires all the time. Billinaires also loose all the time. The thing is, they have more money, buying millions worth of bitcoin is like a lottery ticket to them..
Those aren't the only investors with a stake in the game. 
"Go and cry" - Said the angry butthurt HODLer 
Heh.
It was the truth.

The other guy will sober up soon.
>0.6 was is far too high.

Is that a typo? I said .06

>It is a parasitic coin: without BTC's name and reputation it would be worth 10 dollars, like every other shitcoin.

It has all the functionality of bitcoin and lower fees, so I don't see why it should be worth less than bitcoin. I agree that they are both shitcoins though.
I do, but I think your bleeding butthole is beyond fixing

>In March of 2009, U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner let it slip that he was "quite open" to the idea of an eventual move toward a global currency run by the International Monetary Fund. Although many were surprised by this unusual announcement, the idea of a world currency is certainly not a new one. In fact, one of the most frequently cited backers of a single currency is the legendary economist John Maynard Keynes.

Dream on. Fed isn't going to compete with BTC they are just going to release an alternative linked to the USD and it's game over with BTC.

You think world cares about BTC? They don't, they care about getting rich fast, lambo here, lambo there, that's all what matters for masses. 

If you think any country or big corpo is going to give away the power of controlling a currency then you are delusional, will never happen. 
Lol the username and this comment made me laugh

less profit => less miners (though I think this is not necessarily the case); less miners => less difficult to mine => more people can afford to mine => eventually will reach an equilibrium with profitability.
No, I was asking for you to share some of the drugs you're on. 
He's wrong actually. 

 "Mt. Gox Closes - February 24, 2014 => Bitcoin value: $547.09     Bitcoin value 10 days later: $662.57"   

[https://99bitcoins.com/price-chart-history/](https://99bitcoins.com/price-chart-history/)

You got to consider however that before the official closure, people wasn't able to withdraw bitcoin from mtgox and that the speculation they got hacked was already in the air. But, this happened after the bubble explosion anyway.

Because it's ETH/BTC I do not know if it's lot of people switching from BTC to ETH or ETH to BTC...
They can. It doesn't mean they will. Most close out their position and are done with it until they are ready to go short again. None are silly enough to think they can call tops, bottoms, and direction swings. 
Sellers doesn't neccesarily have the intention to rebuy at lower prices. Some sellers would sell just because they need to sell to pay stuff. The same applies to shorters; you can be 1x short to not be exposed to market movements, without neccesarily betting the price will go down.  
What he described is short selling - that's how it works. 


They are making money. Serious money.
Unfortunately, the general population isnt as care free about their money as you to toss it into a hugely volatile asset so I see utility limited to speculative investment and the small group of people that actually care about the technology.  
Inflated no.  Price manipulation, yes.

Not only the first popular implementation, THE first implementation period. Satoshi invented Bitcoin and thus the blockchain.  You are obviously correct about it having other uses than just for cryptocurrency. 
Internet started in a small niche with military use in the 60's and took nearly 4 decades to find it's way into mainstream. Bitcoin started in a small niche of developers and mining enthusiasts and is slowly making its way into mainstream. And it won't take 4 decades. 
But, someone never receives Bitcoin in the case of futures. However, they may receive a barrel of oil. That's the heart of this. 

If Bitcoin isn't exchanged, only dollars are exchanged, then its no different than gambling. If Bitcoin was delivered, then I could see a difference. I'm simply saying when only cash is exchanged, it's no different than gambling. 
That's what makes a market. What I don't get is why so many doubters hang out in here. I mean why follow something you have no interest in?
You are a panic seller 😂😂
With your 100 dollar in Btc
Yes, typo.

But BOTH shitcoins?  Heh :)

If BTC is a shitcoin, what is your favoured coin.
Standard emergency treatment is for him to stick his head up it to stem the flow.
Do not use bitfinex as a proxy for the whole market. It's not representative.

Then it is especially a good thing 
Ketchup or mustard or both? You have to think these things through
First off all, there are way more countries than the US and many of them are on board with Bitcoin. Second of all, nobody gives power away. It gets taken. Lastly, bitcoin doesn't need to replace current currencies for years. In this infant stage, Bitcoin simply need to offer a co-existing system that socially unites currency use on a global level.Think about it. The more that individual countries create be their own independent blockchain token in your scenario, the more value there is in a globally accepted currency that also functions as a store of value. The possibilities are endless and it's playing out like a book. If you can't envision just how embedded in our future this is going to be, you need to look harder.
Goodnight all!

Yeah but this event prolonged the bear market due to all the panic selling 
it 's far more impressive on Worldcoin index 80% du volume mondial sur bit _Z now = USD to BTC https://www.worldcoinindex.com/volume
Yes until they don’t 
It's a game of chicken.

We need to assume that there is a certain degree of price manipulation and exchanges are complicit in it.  Such exchanges stand to gain a lot when a large pool of leveraged Shorts (or Longs) gets rekked when they manipulate a large price change.

So it boils down to a game of chicken - holding a leveraged position long enough to gain and get out before the position gets rekked.
They were last year 
Once enough people are holding and using bitcoin, the whales currently doing the manipulation will not be able to move the price as much. 
LOL some of you guys are so mean.

It’s totally different from fiat currency. It’s decentralized for fucks sake. 
And one can argue the value of a bitcoin is derived partially from the cost to mine one.  It takes a real expenditure of machine and electricity to produce one bitcoin.  As the difficulty increases, the cost to produce does as well.  This is totally unlike fiat currency which solely derives its value from government dictate and faith of the public. 
I didn’t make any argument. I just pointed out your lack of reading comprehension. I give you an F for being a smug piece of shit.
That is because they settle the contract for cash value. Hypothetically, you could execute the contract and there would be an obligation to deliver. 
It might go that way in the future. Keep in mind this just started in December so it's really really new. Cash settlement is easier to start with until institutions have proper cold storage and the exchange capacity
They're all shitcoins. No one has figured out how to make blockchain scale yet. It's an interesting technology, but there are still a lot of hurdles before it can actually be useful.
If the algorithm is naive enough and the liquidity sufficient :-p

Half a million BTC exchanged in 24hours only BIT-Z lol
Bulls make money

Bears make money

Pigs get slaughtered...


Just like Bitcoin rebounded off previous lows to an ath until It doesn't?
Last year was not driven by people looking for utility and a store of value. That was entirely get rich quick speculation. 
That's my entire point. Saying "that's the market" doesn't differentiate from what's actually happening. In a *market*, a good or service is *exchanged*. The only thing getting *exchanged* with Bitcoin futures are dollars, not the good or service itself.

If an asset (i.e. Bitcoin) is never exchanged (i.e. delivered), it's not a market. It's just gambling. That's fine if that's what it is. But, let's call a spade a spade. Giving something an official sounding name is just misleading. 

I would really like to see a court differentiate between futures and gambling. If an asset/good/service actually gets exchanged, then you have a market. Without an actual exchange of an asset/good/service, I really don't see how its any different than gambling.
For heaven's sake.  Do some reading before you post again.
Pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered. Oh, and suckers who buy on emotion get slaughtered too.
Sheep that hodl get slaughtered 
So?  I was a get rich quick guy too. Then I turned.  I can’t be the only one...
Good luck with that. 
Lol you know how common this is ? You have CFD, futures for everything. That's how it works. Why the hell would I want ''real'' bitcoin if I can trade on more trusted exchanges, short and even get leverage if I want to ? The thing is, most people are in it for a quick buck, and little else.
That's not a real argument. None of the shitcoins in existence could handle 1% of the transaction volume of a major credit card.
Into what?  Get rich slowly?
👏
Patience is a virtue they say. It’s fucking hard though
