**VanEck, SolidX Join Forces in New Bid to Launch Bitcoin ETF**

https://www.coindesk.com/vaneck-solidx-join-forces-in-new-bid-to-launch-bitcoin-etf/

Investment firm VanEck has partnered with financial services company SolidX in their latest attempt to launch the first bitcoin exchange-traded fund.

The companies announced Wednesday that they would list a "physically-backed bitcoin ETF that will be insured against loss or theft of bitcoin."

Under the arrangement, VanEck will market the ETF, while SolidX will act as sponsor, according to a press release. The companies noted that both have previously filed individually to list bitcoin ETFs on various stock exchanges.

VanEck chief executive Jan van Eck said bitcoin is "a legitimate investment option, as a type of 'digital gold' that may make sense for investors' portfolios."

The CEO noted that the ETF has not yet been created, saying "We're pleased to join with [SolidX] in supporting the effort to bring a physically-backed bitcoin ETF to market." When asked by CoinDesk, he declined to provide details on what assets would be used to back the fund.

Neither SolidX nor VanEck has succeeded in launching a bitcoin ETF to date. As previously reported by CoinDesk, both companies withdrew previous attempts at launching the products at the request of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Van Eck expressed optimism about the fund's potential, despite the regulatory obstacles they have faced, saying:

"We believe that collectively we will build something that may be better than other constructs currently making their way through the regulatory process. A properly constructed physically-backed bitcoin ETF will be designed to provide exposure to the price of bitcoin, and an insurance component will help protect shareholders against the operational risks of sourcing and holding bitcoin."

If approved by regulators, the new ETF would be listed on the CBOE BZX Equities Exchange, according to the release.
This is a tug of war of 200$ proportions 
Checked the date

It's the 6th of June.
Reminder: The "bottom" was 4 months ago today. Onward and Upward!

Noob question.

I want to have a cold wallet for long term storage. I am not concerned with burglary or my house burning down as much as I am with it simply breaking or not working (like a hard drive becoming corrupted).

I recently transferred my Bitcoin from the cash app into Bitcoin wallet on my Android.
Now if I save the backup file on to multiple flash drives and store them each in a safe location. 
Can I then delete the wallet from my phone and effectively have a cold wallet?

8000 is still possible, but I'm starting to have my doubts...

Not reading any more of your babbling. 

Paraphrasing yourself using lengthier text doesn’t make you any less mistaken. Peace! 
Forget about bull trend in 2018. 10k in 2019. 
$7500 on the dot for weeks with minor bumps. It's being manipulated and it sucks.
Bitcoin will never reach 8k this week. Seriously

What did you expect? The price to never go down? This is normal volatility, if you get bothered by price swings then you're in the wrong place.
Who cares... The price is so cheap... It allows time to build up reserves... This is the time to buy... Before everyone says... Urrrrrrr omg i should have bought into bitcoin im so dumb

Means that it will not be subjected to the scrutiny and regulations imposed on securities.


Just buy steady and stop looking... Ive been buying every 2 weeks for a while... Feels like ive purchased at every price at this point... Just hold out till 2020 when the supply cuts is what im doing
go lay in the sun. it doesn't matter. check again in 2020. until the big events happen which are regulatory clarity / a bitcoin etf and the LN is mature why sell? why worry? when those events come to pass sell into the strength. 
Switch to normal investments instead of cryptos
Then don't check the daily volume. You will be disappointed.
to be sure of what?
Heard they're investing at least $5k
link?
The sane ones, speak softly and carry a big stick.
That explains it - the head of their digital asset group is called Bart :) 
> Neither SolidX nor VanEck has succeeded in launching a bitcoin ETF to date.

Ok.
And? 
it peaked on 5 (not 6) may (at 9,823).
the lowest price since then was 7,112 on 28 may.
so in order for the pattern to hold, today's closing price would have to be below 7,112.
yes it was started last 2nd week of january and the highlight is during the 2nd week of February that reach it's all time low in this year after reaching a 20k market.

It's like the noise in a radio when there's no music playing.
Typical of low volume.
The more they have, the more they want. The extra are the tears of those who lose everything, which season their earnings.
Sometimes I wish Bitcoin crashes once for all so those greedy fuckers stick their worthless whales up their asses and have diarrhea for the rest of their lives for the damage they did. 
how about the sell off though wow
That’s not what cold storage is. You’re just copy/pasting wallet files from a potentially compromised/ vulnerable device to a USB drive. That’s not cold storage and the keys would technically not be considered uncompromised. 

Cold storage means the private keys have never been exposed to any device that touches or has ever touched the internet. 

A Ledger Nano is cold storage because by architecture, the private keys never leave the device regardless of what you plug it into. That’s “Cold Storage”. 

If your android wallet was compromised - and you back it up on USB keys - I can still take your private keys and steal your coins tomorrow, next year, in 5 years - regardless of you backing it up. 

Get a Ledger for piece of mind. 
Use the Bitcoin Core wallet. I've been using it for years. Solid and safe.

Create a wallet, transfer the funds, encrypt the wallet with a decent password (this option is provided by the program) and store it multiple safe locations. Then erase the wallet file in your computer and that's it.

Wish I had heeded your advice then
how are you going to scam people if you don't even put a link?
You mean 0.7 sat daily, right?
.7btc daily? ahahaha... sure
We can only hope..
no. the bottom is around 6500 \- 7000.  So it will be 6500 \+ X
Let me guess, you're the guy that screams "the sky is falling" on every dump. sheep.
Please, don't take my BitDoubloons!
It’s not normal volatility, it’s just whale manipulation and messing with people’s heads.
It doesent really mean anything because nobody saw it as a security in the first place :) So it just means things can continue as they have.  So its good news, but its kind of what everyone expected i guess.

Im happy to be corrected.
Bitcoin acts as a replacement sovereign currency. 
Very good points well made. 
No effin way.  I thrive on excitement 
That should bring the price up to 9600 at least.
lol

D-Day +74 years
a TA theory that we will have a reversal on 6th 
Yes what he said.  Get a ledger nano or a trezor. 
> That’s “Cold Storage”. 

That's BS used to sell the ledger. If he encrypts the file storing the private keys, it's as safe as your ledger device. Probably even more since some hardware wallets have shown to have critical bugs which allowed the private keys extraction.

Cold Storage is when there's no communication access to the device, except in the physical form.

Nice work; there may be a few more in our future, or we may see a jump toward a crossover on the daily chart.  We’ll see.  It’s being as unpredictable as possible.

Price stagnates = manipulation

I forgot to grab my lunch when I left for work this morning = manipulation
The entire market is silly.  There is only a handful - if that - of proper coins.  But shitcoins are still getting pumped, and you see some unsustainable rises in shitcoins.  No doubt some of that investment (which is pure speculation - or closer to gambling) is transferred from BTC.  

That pumping isn't necessarily the mythical whales - it is people trying to make a buck, who have no medium or long term interest in XCoin, or ArseCoin - or indeed Rogercoin aka Bcash - and why shouldn't they?

This is prob. why some shitcoins rise absurdly, while BTC rises a little.

But then everyone realises they are investing in shitcoins, the little bubble bursts, the market corrects, and BTC rises again as everyone comes back into the fold.

BTC is suffering that, essentially, IMO.

In the long run it will be fine - but until people stop putting dollars or their BTC into 'TittyCoin' or 'BeerCoin' or 'WankCoin', this will continue.

Just need to be patient.
Haha 
He dumped his abundant bitcoin for really really rare dollars.
i think you earn -x on the first day, where x is the balance in your wallet.
And now let me guess, wasn't so wrong with predicting a drop eh?
And that's always been there, so that's normal volatility, period.
Leverage
It's supposed to hit the low before the pump starts.
Where does the 6th of June pump come from I don't remember seeing this date?
I think it could well be price is showing signs of reversal 
Depending on the time-zone, it was also on the 5th.
Lol if the private keys were compromised before the encryption then what good is the encrypted file?! 

A hacker would already have access. 

The only way this would work would be if the hardware used prior to the encryption was never connected to the internet and had been totally isolated from any potential malware. And since it was an Android phone that’s not the case. 

Also please show me where a Ledger’s private keys have been extracted from the device itself? If that was possible the company would be bankrupt by now. 

The only exploit was months back which involved the potential for faulty firmware to be installed should the device fall into the wrong hands - which is a far cry from being able to extract private keys from an uncompromised device.

coin market cap does not update their prices often enough,  but they also play games,  they are very quick to update when things are moving up,  but slow to update when things are moving down.
how do i buy tittycoin?
America will be awake soon
Some shit about seeing pumps/dumps on 6th of april and may. Now all the 15 yo TA experts think this will be the day. 
Perhaps it also says we will crash on july 6th lol
not if everyone is simply excited to pull out and make a tiny profit. that's dump news to me
> A hacker would already have access. 

Yeah. He uses Magic to hack everything! 

> The only exploit was months back which involved the potential for faulty firmware to be installed should the device fall into the wrong hands - which is a far cry from being able to extract private keys from an uncompromised device. 

So what? I have used a Bitcoin Core wallet for years (since 2011) as a cold storage. I encrypted it and saved in a Pen Drive. I have never lost any funds. Ever! So show me how my Pen-drive could be magically hacked...

I'm not sure if I should be happy or not that someone has taken the time to kind of impersonate me  :)
I see I'll keep that in mind
With USDT...
You probably can't!  But you may see its alleged price shoot up by 35% while BTC is struggling to gain 1% :)
America will come, they must come! I seriously hope the price will go up a bit though, I traded a small amount last week for a few euro's profit, but would like to have the same result now :)
Ah ok.. YouTube prophets such as bitcoin bob haha
i think that is getting nearer. But I do hope it recovers for a while.
Of course [you](https://gyazo.com/9197b86c5ba1ee04ae5c80b2042b024d) would say that
Yes also true
Wtf are you talking about “magic”? You don’t think priv keys have been obtained through malware exploits?! 

Lololol. 

Do some research and it might actually scare you when you learn how easy it is to pull privkeys out of software wallets. 

Also your anecdotal experience is meaningless. That’s like saying “I’ve never worn a seatbelt in my whole life and look at me I’m still alive!!”

Your advice should never be followed. Go do some reading. 
Best form of flattery is imitation 
You've earned a parody account!

I wear that with pride. thanks buddy, I see that every morning and it still makes me smile.
looks like I was right.
anyone would say that. just look at the comments here and on r/bitcoinmarkets. no one is looking to hold at this bump, people are trying bailout and take small profits. what does that tell you? buy their coin, pay for their profits, and let it drop on your dime? then what? sell the loss? get real man.
> You don’t think priv keys have been obtained through malware exploits?

Yeah. I'm sure that everyone is infected with malware exploits so everyone should just buy a hardware wallet. 

What are you, some sales expert?

Everyone with some good sense is perfectly capable of storing a wallet file. It's no rocket science. You are just pushing others into buying that crap which security is unauditable, since there's no access to the source or the hardware schematics.

And you even have the nerve to tell me *Go do some reading* ?? LOL. A simple Google Search "Ledger nano S exploits" [has already showed me enough information](https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/03/20/ledger-nano-s-hack-cryptocurrency/) [and again](https://qz.com/1233401/a-teen-hacker-exposed-a-security-hole-in-ledgers-hardware-wallets/). The only people supporting such devices are people like you who are incapable of maintaining a clean PC and push everyone around them into buying that crap, so they don't feel bad about themselves for buying some useless shit.

Stop spreading your bullshit and stop deceiving others into buying closed-source hardware wallets.



Bears beets Battlestar Galactica 
is this mrs & mr bitcoin?
Intresting... I hope ur right I want to bath in some green
"Just look at the comments". If everyone wanted to take small profits bitcoin would not have gotten where it got. Bitcoin is here to stay, like it or not. Evidence of that is everywhere.
The article you attempted to link was what I already referenced. Are you slow? 

That “exploit” doesn’t involve obtaining private keys - it has to do with patching a device with hacked firmware which requires physical access and then a specific transaction via software has to be accepted. This does not equate to being able to obtain private keys. 


Basically it requires 100x the effort to pull off plus physical access to the device than it would be for a hacker to get keys off a software wallet. Yet... your method is safer? LOL. 

It seems you Don’t understand the subject matter you’re trying to debate. Go do some reading. 
I never said it was going anywhere. that's just you jumping the gun and assuming things. clearly it's not going anywhere, but the current bump is temporary IMO. that's it, nothing more, nothing less. you can assume all you want, you're just wasting energy and time.
> The article you attempted to link was what I already referenced. Are you slow? 

You didn't link shit. 

> That “exploit” doesn’t involve obtaining private keys - it has to do with patching a device with hacked firmware which requires physical access and then a specific transaction via software has to be accepted. This does not equate to being able to obtain private keys. 

If you can hack the firmware, you can forge the transactions. Funds stolen. Done!

> It seems you Don’t understand the subject matter you’re trying to debate. Go do some reading. 

LOL. It's funny you know. You assume every single computer in the world is compromised so, better just buy a closed-sourced hardware wallet. Hilarious!

And the best of all, is that you assume it is necessary to have a PC connected to the internet to create a software wallet! LOL 

Very weel, if you want to be paranoid, lets go with that! 

Just download the bitcoin core wallet, kill the network connection, create the software wallet, encrypt it, copy it into a PEN drive, print the public key in order to transfer funds into that wallet and finally, erase the hard drive. 

No leak! How about that! No need to waste money in a closed-source hardware wallet...

Stop bullshitting people into making your own mistakes.
