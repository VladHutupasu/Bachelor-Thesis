Daily Discussion, June 24, 2018 -- TITLE
I never thought it'd come to this, but I just sold 2/3 of my coins. 1/3 to cash, 1/3 to tether as a hedge. I was simply too vulnerable and need some good night sleep.

I still believe in the technology, just not in the price, at least not in the short term.

Given my track record with financial decisions, this is very likely the bottom. 

You can thank me later.
There goes the 6000 support
the next psychological barrier will be if/when it drops below where it was 1 year ago
i have officially run out of money. going to treat all my crypto as a loss, and come back at christmas and see whats going on. good luck guys.

im going to leave you with my favorite quote:

 "If a man builds 1,000 bridges and sucks one dick, they don't call him a bridge-builder... they call him a cocksucker. "  -  Vince Boudreau 
The bounces are getting weaker by the day good lord.
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of deathI take a look at my life and realize there's not much leftcoz I've been trading and hodling so long, thateven my mama thinks that my mind is gone
Despair phase has probably begun.
You guys are bipolar lmao 
Below $100b market cap
Kill me now 
good morning guys :). I just woke up to BTC being 5.8k wow
Where is the support? Have people lost faith in Bitcoin or are just scared by the price going down? There doesn't seem to be any kind of big news or change that could stop this free fall. We really need something big to turn all this around. 

How low can it go? Could it theoretically get below $1k? Is that even a possibility now?
It's going to fall even more.

https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/volume/24-hour/

This is the first time I see Tether working flat-out and BTC's price is still falling.

$3.2B of Tether traded in 24hours (on a market cap of only $2.6B).

It's the end guys.  I'm cutting my losses and calling it a day.
Daily Hopium:


In the long dark days after the 2014 bitcoin crash when desperation was high and price fell all the way to  ~$200 this was said:

Think about the endgame. If bitcoin reaches 10,000, are you going to get much more utility out of 160000 vs 120000? If it goes to zero, will you kick yourself thinking of what you could've bought today for $1000? Or how much $1000 would be if you put it in the S&P500?


rmfclan_com• 3y
only thing wrong with your analysis is btc has no hope of reaching 10k mark. It's just nuts.

As I thought yesterday the price would drop below 6k. Insecure exchanges threaten the value of bitcoin.
Somebody trying really hard to trash bitcoin, is it for the next bull run or to destroy it, they even took mcafee down in their quest, surely the truth can be found by analysing the block chain transactions
Seriously,how many of you have either used bitcoin to buy lambos or know people who have as a result of bitcoin riches?Lastly what has any of you bought on a regular basis in the real world using bitcoin?Surely implementation starts with its defenders?Seems like Stockholm Syndrome is rife here.
With so many people in it for tech and fundamentals, the price talk makes me confused :)))
Expect some sideways movement for a while and then a drop to a new low. It's getting pretty predictable at this point. 
The need for instant gratification combined with greed, fear, stupidity and a lack of patience will result in people selling at a loss. Otherwise anyone selling now must have bought in when the price was low and are taking profits. 
So what? Bitcoin isn't going away or anything lol. It's going through a phase and right now, and nobody knows how to treat it. SEC say it's not a security and yet people treat it like an investment. Its hard to view it as a currency in countries where the money system works at least 'enough' that we aren't switching to Bitcoin/crypto YET. 
But we will figure out how to deal with Bitcoin once we really define its place in society. It will almost certainly evolve and increase in terms of adoption and certainly in price.
Why would anyone have expected the price to move any differently than it is? These things take time. But look around the world at growing crypto infrastructure and how crypto is solving real problems. It has to take more time but it's coming so no need to rush. Countries don't regulate ponzu schemes, so FFS people stop being so naive, stop calling it a scheme, let the 6 monthers and year long investors piss in their pants and sell at a loss. Let the early investors take their profits. Let time do its job.
I don't believe in bitcoin one bit.... thats why im all in
I think I have a problem. I set a small goal for the amount of Bitcoin I want to own. Every time I reach the goal, I just end up setting a higher one. Just one more time, just a little more Bitcoin, I tell myself. Over and over. And these low prices are just exacerbating things, as I succumb to FOMO. I blame Saifedean Ammous and his book "The Bitcoin Standard" for this; without the solid understanding of the true promise of Bitcoin his book provides, I probably would have capitulated and bought a really nice guitar with my profit. The one thing saving me is the low liquidity on Bisq, which prevents me from just emptying by bank account :)
lolol look at those 5-minute charts - this dog is cooked. 
So should I sell before it dips again?  Or is it to the moon from here?
That's one juicy green dildo 
**Come On Bulls, we can turn this around!** 
Goodbye, bitcoin. See you when the next hype cycle starts.
I'm Down 65 percent on 500 dollars investment.

I Can't even begin to imagine the purple who have invested 10k or 50k or more.

I Was Down 70 but started buying the dips 2 days back

But Holy smokes. the people who are invested big. it must be hurting real bad. 
I still have Bitcoin that I CPU mined. Watching idiots spaz out after holding for 6 months is sad.
Btc back to $3000 I'll lick McAfee tits 
People freaking out and selling, market is saturated. Also a future expires on June 29th. with lows going I think like $5975 per 1 BTC? And highs like $6030? It's being manipulated, in my opinion based off the articles I've been reading on here. Now is the time to buy, it might go a little bit lower by the end of the.month but I doubt it. It will end june I think in the the range of 5975-6030 per btc, then go up like 700 and come back down to meet the next expiration for July. Best thing right now is buy low sell high. Use futures as a basis for when to buy.
Sold everything today with a very small profit. Maybe I will buy back when it reaches 100$. Good luck to you all and stay positive!! ^_^
This reddit is full of shit! That’s why crypto is down. It is full of dumb people. 
BTC is not dead!! It will never die!
[deleted]
How will/can bitcoin be adopted/used in third world countries where people battle to survive?How will bitcoin overcome cultural stumble blocks in the way of wide scale adoption?Would the volatility in its price not also be a stumbling block for the everyday man in the street if he had the option of bitcoin being used to pay his paycheck?Informal traders in Africa will never use it as a currency,it's not practical.
We have a liftoff 
One thing is for sure, I never have to go to a theme park again. I can't think of a better roller coaster. 
Best time to buy is when there blood in the water. 
Well at least it bounced.
Can govs. and centralized exchanges collude to manipulate bitcoin to fiat price?
Somebody out there still believes in bitcoin. Thank you kind whale 🐳

I've seen references to the comparison in the image linked below several times over the past while. It's pretty crazy how close the movement matches up.

What's even more interesting to me is that the very technology that allows the pattern to move 5X faster in the Bitcoin market cap chart is basically what the "dot-com bubble" time frame in the first chart reflects - The internet itself. The internet has increased access to information & all other data so technology now evolves at an accelerated pace. What's positive for Bitcoin if it continues to follow this pattern at a 5X rate, is the next phase. :)

Congratulations to those of you who bought below 6K
Set buys for 5k, all the way down to 1k

They are all possible.  
As this thing continues to tank take a moment to remember everyone who tried to warn you this would happen and how you treated them
We are coming! And we are coming in waves!

I can finally be financially independently!

Below 5800!
Any Bitcoin-Venezuelan Bolivar update?
It's the revenge of the shorts
Glad i held on to my butthole, to the moon!
Yo this thing bout to go boom hahaha
still bullish here. big money wont buy me out. i rather go down in flames.
We should know which direction this goes sometime this week. There is a reverse head-and-shoulders tracing out right now. If that pattern completes people are going to see it as technically very positive. It will be a good break above 6800 and should easily continue through 7000. If the pattern fails at a minimum it's probably going to retest 5800. If we get a failure here and start trading into the fives 6000 is going to become a major resistance. ...at least to all the technical traders and there are quite a few of them in this market
Charlie Munger, Warren Buffet, Bill Gates and buddies came out in droves bashing bitcoin in early May, now it's down more than 1/3. They must have "done" something right, right? 
Why is no one making a big deal out of the fact that Bitmain almost (or does) have >50&#37; BTC hash power? I know thought keeping the block size low was supposed to prevent this from happening. If it's so trivial to gain majority hash power, isn't the point of BTC defeated?
Wow, BART incoming. This is going to be ugly.
Thanks for the cheap BTC guys. Sold my yearly bonus shares at work and loaded up on BTC. Been wanting to do this for a while but only in the last few days has it looked good value again.
$7k this time next week?
is there any chance we'll ever see an all time high again??
Mien Gott! Ze sky of falling. Schnell everyone, back down in ze trenches!

Why is bitcoin dying?
found the bottom at 5777. Right now were in a bullish market. 50k eoy.

deaming
you guys change sentiment faster than a human torpedo on steroids! not to rain on y'all parade on anything, but has anyone here looked at the fact that bitcoin is at 6100 and not 7000~20,000 and most altcoins are down heavily? lol
People are funny they claim they understand btc and in reality they dont. Imagine an auctioneer is looking in your window and without you noticing he is listen to your conversation and hear you say how much you value a photo and you are willing to pay anything for it. So that auctioneer tells his buddy "hey this guy likes this photo and is willing to pay top dollar for it". 

So they start the auction with the picture already over priced and they see you put your bid in, now they know you are willing to pay anything so one auctioneer acts as a bidder and is always bidding higher than you until they feel you are losing interest then they sell you the over priced painting.

So whales do the same thing they look at all the shorts and long and they manipulate the price so it goes up and people lose their "shorts", and when people see the price going up they start buying in, and they start putting long positions. 

I bet if we stop betting on bitcoin it would skyrocket because everybody would benefit from the price increase, but when we margin trade some benefit on the price to be low and some high, so until then Im buying the dips. Its not the whales that is hurting bitcoin it MARGIN TRADING.
Everyone is actually holding but pretending to capitulate by writing negative shit on reddit thinking it will somehow entice buys.  It’s actually pretty funny. 

REAL capitulation will occur when exchanges start locking down and shutting out users due to high sell orders. When the exchanges start going down then we’ll see real blood. 
If a woman was as moody/volatile and unstable as bitcoin would you enter into a long term relationship with her?
I miss Bart
Look at that organic growth. 
unbelievable. just un-fucking-believable.
shocked I tell you...shocked
One Bart up, three Barts down...
Ok, I know it's impossible but I'd like to know some numbers:

Say I type a random Bitcoin private key. What are the chances I land an account with funds?

Just wanting to see some astronomical numbers :)
Here comes the BART!  Are you ready?
Hopefully distance wail is the lambo kiddies selling. Good riddance.
there's not enough people in bitcoin subreddit using anime, bitcoin or anime-bitcoin avatars. we need more of these to entice the bulls to come to us.
Time to celebrate the lower new high?
I need some up votes, please up me up! Thank you and Lambos to everybody!
Don't worry as soon as the world cup is over the market will recover.
what happened 
There should be an entrance exam to express opinions publicly. Secondly, is there/ could there be a completely separate sub for uninvested trolling quacks with nothing to contribute. You could name it FUDBUDDIES 
I sold my bitcoin to buy some pancakes
Isn’t this the guy that Bitcoiners hailed as a guru for the cause?  https://news.sky.com/story/john-mcafee-anti-virus-software-pioneer-claims-enemies-tried-to-kill-him-11413955?utm_source=fark&utm_medium=website&utm_content=link&ICID=ref_fark
I’m just glad BitcoinAlways has finally shut the F up for a day with cliche repetitive shit like “go Bulls”...who’s with me lol.
For me personally, reality has set in and I'm expecting this to go down to 4k area, maybe high 3's. And it will bounce between that and 5k for a while, I'm talking months for this to play out. The December bullrun many are expecting probably won't happen...more likely next year now.

Not fudding. Just zooming out on the chart and coming to grips with what it a potential scenario. Still too much optimism in the market imo.
When your only real competitor advises its users not to run nodes... 

Then you know that BTC has already won. 

BTC - has two use cases: store of value and the ability to lock funds in the lightning network.
I got 50k fiat setting around what should i do with it?
10 months ago this subreddit was celebrating bitcoin crossing $4,000 for the first time. https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6tcg99/bitcoinity_usd_4000_gif/

Gee what a brilliant IDEA.
Bitcoin price is closer to $2000 than $10000.
Cause I'm praying for rain

I'm praying for tidal waves

I want to see the ground give way

I want to watch it all go down

Mom, please flush it all away

I want to see it go right down

I want to watch it go right in

Watch you flush it all away
**COME ON BEARS!!**
Ohhhh, my!  That flag got real long in the tooth, and now it's just a streamer bending.  We need a big boost in positive volume, right now.
People keep saying that bitcoin isn't digital gold. But we know that gold will never be digital.

So is there anything, besides bitcoin, that has more right to be called digital gold? 

It would have to be something that is inflation proof, has worldwide liquidity, doesn't depend on one business or government for value, and is digital (can be sent instantly). 
Get the 6k, 7k, 8k, 9k, 10k memes ready :)
Bitcoin is the first global digital asset in history that the entire world can participate in and decide together what its value is.  In many ways its a global social network store of value, where the users decide its value and there is no leader or centralized party, instead we trust a program, a computer.  We can also send it to each other without anybody's permission or censoring.   

Right now this assets value, global market cap wise is around 105 billion.  What do you think its worth?  

And it cannot become myspace'd for one simple reason.  It is the most TRUSTED coin because it has the longest blockchain in mother f-ing HISTORY! Debate me on this!!
Even I'm surprised by the quantity of weak hands... Did this many people seriously think btc is a get rich quick scheme? 
The barrier has been broken. Watch bitcoin drop to 5k and then rise up like crazy. Afterwards people complaining about not buying.
Fomo time
It just bounced hard.

BTC - is a Technological Invention.  A digital asset that you control, in your possession - the digital gold.  There is no reason to use it for payments.  That part doesn't even matter right now.  Invest for this reason and you will be rewarded in the long term.  Under the digital gold thesis it would be very hard to replace bitcoin.  Trust is the most important factor with new technology, Bitcoin has never failed, it is the most trusted.  If you have a 3-4 minimum time horizon, you should at the very least see it break ATH's.
[So today was not such a bad day after all.  The weather was beautiful where I live, I got a lot of shit done, and bitcoin is back above 6k.  I'll take it.](https://youtu.be/Ep9Vzb6R_58)
This is a very calculated event unfolding. This is called the regulation phase of BTC. Fear it. Have uncertainty about it. But most of all get excited.  As the market works to correct security issues (and it will) people will notice. Heavy, heavy pocketed individuals and business with their trillions of dollars locked away will flood this valley of current doubt and I’m gonna ride that fuckin wave waving my hand and smiling.

Upvote if you think 5777 was the bottom for the week
Depending on how you define the begin/end of the drops, there have been 6 consecutive drops over the last 2.5 days with no bounce (no rise that lasted more than 10min).  So...analysis based on nothing:  bounce soon.  Not a moon bounce obviously, just another shitty one.

https://i.imgur.com/TO3PnOr.png
you can always buy in again much lower, i think you made a good move

Here's one for /r/Buttcoin 
You're remembered for something that made the biggest impact.
ROFL!

Later bro :)
no money coming in, everything going out.
but I ain't never bought a coin that didn't deserve it
If your mama is worrying about you, then you are in good hands.

Go buy an X-Box next time ok?
Not Even Close. I'm still holding, infact just 500 dollars and buying the dips daily now. . People still holding.

Despair will begin when price is 2k.

And there are scams and exchanges shutting down for good. 
way to kick this thread off buddy
Send me you coins first.
Weak hands are leaving. It's good for bitcoin. Those of us in it for the tech aren't leaving. 
Go look at the DOW overtime. Things always bounce back. You just can’t predict tops and bottoms. Bitcoin mining is very resource intensive. Video cards and memory and ssd prices seem to be dropping which means we are reaching a bottom where mining isn’t as profitable. It will eventually hit a floor I think and then bounce. It seems to be in a bit of a range right now and is going sideways.
hurray for capitulation. We'll see you back at 12K.
Hopefully you will leave the forum, you won't be missed.  
Oh, we're SO sorry to see you go - troll.  :)

(He's an alt trading troll basically - lost a stash in alts, came back into the BTC fold - lost a bit more, whinged, gone.)
so bitcoin will recover in 2021?
When is it getting back to 19000?
Ultimate bagholder right here
Me too.  But I'm a little more optimistic to think it will bounce off high 5K.
It's the market demand for bitcoins you dummy! There's None!
Which is why their being regulated and forced to secure themselves.  
I bought a giant pile of cash and 1080Ti using bitcoin. Bitcoin works
Gets in late 2017 / early 2018, expects lambo, doesn't get it right away, points fingers.

Also, you're not using Stockholm Syndrome correctly. No one is forced to be here / buy bitcoin, might want to look that one up buddy.
I'm in it for both. Got in because of the tech, got in more because of the price, stayed in because of the tech. 
It's always predictable until it isn't. That's how people get screwed. 
This. We haven’t hit bottom. We have 9 months for a bull market to begin if this is truly just a repeat of past bubbles. 
The problem is the manipulation and theft that have proven possible with a totally unregulated system. 

But this no regulation is a bitcoin selling point. 

I think the btc is headed for a real existential crisis personally. 
Thinking crypto will have wide spread adoption is the same as thinking gold will be once again used as currency. Bitcoin is deflationary and as such horrible as a currency. Also, why would any government/central bank allow a competing currency on it's soil ? Controlling the money monopoly is literally one of the most important pillars of government power. All they have to do is declare bitcoin illegal and that's all she wrote. You can forget about any widespread adoption then. 
Amen, brother. I'm with you on this.
Once it hits your initial target, celebrate and then decide on a certain percentage you will invest in bitcoin moving forward.  Maybe it’s 5% of disposable income each month. 

Then you go about increasing your stack and living your life.  When the next bull run happens you will feel like a BOSS. 

That’s my plan anyway although my percentage will probably be higher. 
I've been sayin' that after the Bart Simpson, we'd see two Fuzzy Poodles then an inverted Taj Mahal. Told you so.
Sell every rally
Sell
**Come on Bears, we can sink lower!**
I have a friend who had an account value of $400.000 in crypto, he entered at several prices but basically above 14k.

We are scared he's going to do something stupid. Not even joking. 

Meh, "Financial Darwinism".
There's actually a ton of people in this situation. The losses are in the billions. 

The problem is many people didn't really have a plan for something like this, and didn't know how to manage and cut the losses. Some people invested their savings, and even used mortgages and loans.
Can confirm, sucks seeing thousands plucked from you weekly.
Just hold it man, you gonna have to wait a while. Now I think your best hope is world wide adoption over time as has been happening. It might be years though.
How can you be down less when it's lower than the dips two days back?
Sell and buy an investment that will actually appreciate in value. No sense holding the bag.
I did invest 60K and I'm holding because I know for sure that if I was a billionaire, I could've easily played with all these week hands and get billions on the way up, which I can also make it happen easily!! 
Humans struggle to see 1 week into the future let alone 5 years. 
Thanks for providing clarity, young padawan.
Wow, I thought the penny was bad, what a useless piece of currency you mined there.
if it hits 500 again, ill stock up even more than before and ill get on my knees and worship you as a god.
"If you want an unregulated currency, don't gripe about price manipulation."
lol
Is that also why it went up so high?
Urban dictionary: *Dumb*: a weak term of abuse used on message boards by dumb people.
* emotional people*

 They aren't necessarily dumb they are just emotional. 
No, last short was at 8000 covered at 6200. Now waiting to see if it can crawl back up to 7000 so that I can short it again.
Heck, even in civilized countries, folks haven't been able to answer the question: "If Bitcoin is such a good investment, why waste it actually buying stuff that you could with ordinary money?" But you are correct that volatility is a huge problem: What business really wants payment in something that might swing 10&#37; in a day? Yeah, some businesses have and more will as a gimmick to attract a few more customers, but widespread adoption is unlikely. Much more likely is that the governmental currencies will move to Blockchain or something like it -- paper money has been on the outs since credit and debit cards started to become popular.
I think we need it to be in the hands of many more people for price stability to ultimately occur.  As a byproduct, bitcoin’s limited supply would create a scarcity over time and the price would rise.  Once enough people are holding and using it regularly price will stabilize and individual whales will no longer be able to manipulate the price such as we are seeing happen right now.  
Same as dollars, by just not being there. 
Tell us the scenario when their currency is hyperinflating.  Is not the real question: when will the fiat bubble collapse? That is why BTC is an investment worth holding.
Best comment I've seen here for a while :)


I will never park an Aventador in a theme park anyway sooooo...
It just as thrilling as a roller coaster.
in the streets*
There has been blood in the water for 7 months. Can we buy yet?
Down the stairs?
It always bounces after a massive dump. Then trickles down slowly to where it bounced from. 
This thing is dead. You're all so incredibly naive it's sad.
+1.. This is the exact question I was about to ask to gain more insight from other redditors here.

TBH, they can sell what they seized and I wouldnt be surprised if one day we would come to know that the opening of those future exchanges towards btc, while not holding any physical btc to counter these contracts were also part of that move, its the old game of warping the asset base via future contracts, done on the LIBOR, Gold, Oil etc.
People without the knowledge above succumbed to hedge their btc via futures, where at one point in end of January the futures became the leading indicator for both human investors and algo alike. The initial cost *and* margin calls of those contracts are arguably paid in liquidated btc fiat money.

So there you go, I truly think that government is manipulating prices via exchanges and im sure this is not the only tool at play.
Possibly, although that presumes a considerable degree of international cooperation, but why would they bother?
Yes. But that's tin-foil-hat thinking since there's already manipulation by whalers. No need to get the government involved. 

With their massive bitcoin portfolios, whalers are already manipulating the value. 
we bought the dip, they have us, they poosh it, we buy more,  now they drop it! Thank Bog
what was your timeline when you invested? and what was your reasoning for investing?  
Not in the next few months. If you're planning to get rich all at once go to las vegas.
In 5 years, absolutely
nah, never could invest that much since that's insane risk
Lesson learned, always send SEPA payement before the weekend in case of low BTC price :-( 
bought at 6.2k 2 days ago, and at 5.8k today , feelz good man
Right now I'm more inclined to set a buy at 6900. If this inverse head-and-shoulders we have tracing out right now actually has a bull break it needs to go through that number pretty hard to get the technical traders onboard. If we drop under 6,000 and retest 5800 and go through that 6000 is likely to become resistance.. from there it is somewhat unpredictable where the market will find support. I would be in the wait and see camp. It could crack lower or it could whipsaw and just run traders in. 

Accumulating for the long-term make sense at this price. I mean we are 70% off the high. But I would not trade it until we have clear Direction. It's ripe for a reversal with a downtrend in place. I don't have the foggiest idea which side is going to win this
What helpful advice you give here!  Thank you sir! Thank you thank you for saving my portfolio.

Dad, would you get off my message board please?  It's getting embarrassing.  Everyone knows that you don't have a fucking clue what you're talking about.  I'm tired of getting bullied at school.  Even my philosophy teacher thinks you are a cunt, with your 'retrospective analyses' which he says are 'the domain of those who can't stop stating the fucking obvious in a vain attempt to appear wise.'  P.s.  I'm sorry Dad, but I've set fire to your garden shed, so you can't fuck Mrs Jones from next door in there anymore.

Love Billy.

In case you haven't noticed, the MagicPoopCannon head-&-sholders pattern from two months ago has finally closed this weekend. 
Wrong. This has nothing to do with rich guys shouting at Bitcoin. Buffet was wrong about Amazon and Gates said in 1989 that 640K memory ought to be enough for anybody. Clearly there guys don't have the insight into the future that some give them credit for. Nobody knows for sure where crypto will be in 5 years and there are as many credible tech pioneers that claim it will be huge as there are that bash it.
 
Ask me who was right in 10 years.
No one's making a big deal about it because they don't have >50%. It's currently 42%.

It will be $15K by tomorrow. Mark my words. Next week is such an arbitrary convenient choice. I prefer $7K by 2.6839 weeks from today.
8k easy
probably not 
yes but it's highly unlikely 
Nope.  

But I will be happy to sell at $7k.  Enough to make a bundle for me.
Yes.

Yes there is a chance.
Futures trading has ruined Bitcoins momentum, Public saturation? Less than .01%  of the population has bought Bitcoin
You put alot of effort in there little man.
how is it tulip related.... there is a finite supply of bitcoin...

Stop spamming the same shit over and over.  Nobody care 
You really can't criticize folks who have ridden something 2/3rds of the way down from sticking with it all the way to the bottom -- it's like getting off a roller coaster before you get to the station, and where's the fun in that?
Because I just bought.
Just look at another chart :D

WHAT?!  It’s NOT?
Yup, you got it all figured out.
I think both are hurting bitcoin, but I appreciate your point.

Exchanges have been making a killing with all the selling and a lot of bitcoin $$ is shifted into tether. Maybe the smaller crap Exchanges will suffer but the larger exchanges use the low activity period to up their game.
IF?
You bet your ass. I love pain.
I would volatile over all over her mood.
i missed barts a few days ago and now i'm happy that i did. Still not getting in, waiting for ~$5000. 
Sunday afternoon seems a weird time to start a rally but hey, I'M NOT COMPLAINING

There are 2^256 private keys. There are 28.5 million bitcoin wallets that have more than 0.001 BTC.

2^256 / 28.5 million = 4 x 10^69

So you have a one in 4 x 10^69  chance of guessing a private key and landing an account with funds. To put that in perspective if you guessed 1 million random keys a second for the entire existance of the universe (13.7 billion years). You'd have still only have a one in 9.4x10^45 chance of guessing a private key.

how about you stop trying to steal from other people and get out and do some fucking work and obtain your own!?

Well, this sub used to ban people just for saying something like "I don't think bitcoin is a viable currency." Now that the bubble burst and all the btc fanatics left to find an actual job, you're left with people who are actually allowed to express their opinions. 
I thought it was /r/bitcoin  ?
> There should be an entrance exam to express opinions publicly.

I agree. So much mindless shilling for a speculative internet token from people who have little to no clue what they're talking about. So sure Bitcoin will be worth $100,000 eoy! 

...oh wait you meant it only applied to people who didn't mindlessly praise bitcoin. Woops :)
Just kidding this thing is going to go up i swear

Don't forget about the "I'M NOT SELLING" wolf of wallstreet meme. So glad those days are gone. Just nothing but mindless shilling. 
Go bulls! we can do iitttttt!! get that bart! get itttttttt!!
That's not really a reliable gauge. I'm going to be optimistic all the way down. So are some of the other people. The people who are truly hurt or The Quiet Ones and or the sarcastic trolls. 

I do however agree we are at a very unpredictable point in the market. We have a bullish pattern forming right now with an established bearish downtrend.

People still calling Bitcoin the Myspace of crypto are just regurgitating crap they read on some BS clickbait article. Bitcoin will not be replaced anytime soon, simply because it has proven its network is stable and secure and it's been tested for 10 years...under the heaviest load that any crypto has endured. 
You don't replace that, you upgrade it. Layering technology and inovation will nurture Bitcoin well into the future IMO. The internet wasn't replaced ...it was improved! Same with Windows, Apple, Amazon etc. They evolved.
I guess that's more agreeing than debating but I've been following this a long time and I'm pleased to see that people like yourself are reason to believe that opinions are becoming more educated.
Cares? Apparently not new large investors, which have dried up.
Yes, almost everyone on this subreddit thinks btc is a get rich quick scheme. What did you think all the lambo and moon memes were for?
You must have missed the lambo posts. Heck, Bitcoin was going to be bigger than Iraqi dinars ever were!
I think it's a "get very rich slowly" scheme.
Bro, are you kidding?

This volatile market is perfect for trading.
I remember everyone saying this at 8k.....and 7k
For the last couple of months, Bitcoin has been meandering back and forth in a channel somewhere between 6,500 and 8,000 and now very likely it will start to do the same in a channel between 5,500 and 7,000 for a least a while. Right now, Bitcoin is little more than a plaything toy for day traders, and there doesn't appear to be any mass of new investors stepping into it so  as would create anything like a solid price rise. Those are just the fact, ma'am.
Why would it rise?
Speak for yourself. I am buying this. Have not run out of FIAT, yet.
\+1 &#37; is now a hard bounce 
The whales stretched the rubber band too far that time. 
Yes
> . Under the digital gold thesis it would be very hard to replace bitcoin.

First, it needs to become digital gold. It is not. Gold is seen and wanted for its long term stability and it has a market for over 5 thousand years. Bitcoin has neither. A little sneeze from the market and bitcoin tumbles more than 15%. 
"digital gold"  Nope.  Gold has many industrial uses, and is highly desirable for use in jewelry and other adornment.  

It's digital Beanie Babies.  For the moment, in demand because its tradable and other people will pay money for it - but there's no intrinsic value of use.   
Yeah, but you are a USER of the technology, not somebody who can make cash of the patent rights. How much money does your technologically-advanced iPhone make for you? I do wish, that it would claw back to at least 7000 because it is too low to short now.
You must live in Long Beach, CA
Delusionallll
Governments don't regulate and accept ponzi schemes. BTC is no scheme. It is the future of money. I say future because it's only at the dawn of acceptance. Wait until the FED announces they have BTC reserves. Only a matter of time.
It's a scam but it's not a ponzi.

Sorry, just feel the need for technical accuracy.
Billions of what?
> investment source that can easily yield billions

Wtf you actually believe that ?
Right now they all seem to be dropping so wait at least until they bottom out. But if you're looking to get rich from bitcoin it's better to try stocks.
Bitconnect has the greatest stability: It's value is stable at $0.00 and its volatility is very low.
[deleted]
At this early stage of its development there is no stability when it comes to cryptocurrency. 

Bitcoin has been around the longest, has the largest following and name recognition. Strongest security against hacker attack. 
It is the most likely candidate for institutional investment. 

IMO Bitcoin is your best bet if you are a long term investor.  Take a look at the long term logarithmic chart and decide for yourself:

Thanks for your scientific technical analysis. I'd be lost without you.
I will jump back in with my tether when I see a real reversal.

I'm not folding, just taking a break. I need some sleep.

I'll be back.

We’re 70% down from high. Previous bitcoin bubbles fell 93%, 69%, and 79%. We could be within range of the bottom. 
me too please, I want to be able to buy a coke from mcdonalds.
This is good for bitcoin...
Lol .... "in it for the tech"?  Whatever that means.
You are comparing a digital token with America's largest companies?

Lol ..... :)
BTC is not the DOW. I’ve invested in shares which have gone to 0. I’m a believer, but I’m not stupid ...  
Wrong ... we won't see \*him\* back at 12K :)
6 months - 3 years?
Best guess, never.
Wow, mature debate.
If you bought cash with bitcoin does that not defeat the purpose of bitcoin?What is 1080Ti?
I have never bought bitcoin in my life,just a interested bystander asking some questions.
A closer analogy is gambling addiction.
came for the gains, stayed for the memes
Hammer day candle looks good. Havent had that for a while
*If* you compare it to the 2014 crash then yes (and it looks extremely similar so far). The current cycle may be well be shorter, or longer. No one knows for sure.  
If it does exactly the same thing, we should see a relief rally soon then go down to 2500 USD to see the ~90% crash of 2014.  
But 70% down is already quite a number.

I don't see any contradiction in regulating the BTC/FIAT money market.  
But yeah, *if* BTC seriously compete with legacy FIAT money then who knows what is going to happen.
Naw, it survived and thrived through years of uncertainty and now that it's caught mainstream attention, it isn't going away. It may lay low for a while but considering the massive OTC volume that isn't acknowledged in these discussions that low period may not last long.
And which government would that be? The countries that benefit from Bitcoin will adopt it first. You need to stop thinking Bitcoin is tied any one country or region. You also need to give it far more time before ever evaluating Bitcoin as a currency. That is premature thinking. Imagine condemning the early internet because it couldn't accommodate video streaming and large file transfers due to limited bandwidth. Imagine condemning the concept of wireless video chat. You get the point. Of course Bitcoin can't work as a currency yet! Most average people never even heard of Bitcoin before a year ago!!! People really need to grasp the time it takes for adoption.
> Bitcoin is deflationary and as such horrible as a currency.

That's the viewpoint of the Keynesian school of economics, yes. But, it's not some kind of a priori truth. There is also the Austrian school of economics, which contends that a hard currency is much better than an inflationary one. If I understand correctly, this is the school that heavily influenced Satoshi and many early adopters of Bitcoin.

That being said, it could be argued that Bitcoin isn't truly deflationary, since the supply gets inflated every 10 minutes. On the other hand, the total supply being capped at a known amount seems to be a pretty good argument that it is. Yes, I argue with myself, usually not publicly though.

> Controlling the money monopoly is literally one of the most important pillars of government power.

For me, this is one of the most exciting things about Bitcoin, the possibility that it will weaken the stranglehold that government has on us all.

But, I'm no economist or political scientist, I'm just some random guy on the Internet who read a couple of books. I should probably read a few more.
It's not a competing currency. The US has classified it as a commodity and Europe as far as I know has done the same. It's not exactly competing with the US dollar when it's being quoted in US dollars. For example. You see all the panic in here the past week? One Bitcoin is still one Bitcoin. However Bitcoin is trading lower against the US dollar so people panic.

If you actually spent the time to research this you could listen into some of the audio clips and videos of regulators talking about Bitcoin. Making it illegal is not something they plan on doing

This is why you don't invest more than you can afford to lose.  But this advice is really especially for noobs to follow when you see people who've 10 X times their money in months and FOMO kicks in.


He could wait <1 year and just drink through it. 

That sucks. A friend of mine used all his saving plus a bit more when BTC hit 18k. I think he deposited about 10k or so. Poor bastard
How the hell does someone that dumb get access to $400K ?
Yeah people who would've never day traded, saw an opportunity to get rich quick, started day trading cryptos, which we all know are probably some of the highest risk investments at the moment, and got fucked hard. Now there are a buncha extra coins and market needs to eat em up before the price goes up a lil bit.

Mostly through delusion and bad math skills im guessing
yes
Up? Where?
Did you waste your time to search that?
It won't work in places with unstable electricity infrastructure.You take 10% away from a 1 man salary that often feeds more than one family you have a recipe for a riot.Africa is Africa,don't compare it to other continents.
Price drops allow more people to buy. Lots of information to be had in the numbers of new wallets, and the amounts they hold and for how long. Literally just need to read the ledger.
Percentage wise what figure of the world population/world's currency do you see being converted and on what do you base your numbers and what is the time frame?
Some of the biggest industries in Africa is informal,how do they convert their customers who aren't even spending a dollar at a time to convert to bitcoin?A lot of African countries don't have hyperinflation.I battle to see mass global adoption.
Not every third world country in Africa has hyper inflation.Lack of technology infrastructure even something seemingly basic like having a smartphone will be challenges.Education will be hard where you have different languages and dialects plus the distrust caused by tribalism.
To be fair, there is a lot of water too from all the tears of the weak hands. 
I'd argue that it's spilled over from the streets into the water at this point.
..even when it's your blood.
Always? How far back you looking? Not far by the sounds of it.
Says the guy who's probably only been trading for 2 of the past 10 years lol. Dead again hey?
"It's dead, guys it's dead. You're all dumb. No really, listen to me, guys it's dead. G-guys..." *Price jumps $500 in half an hour*
> redditor for a day

Ok...
Yup, it's totally dead again for the 21st time!! 
And your the guy that hangs about on forums telling the losers that they are losers? Not sure what that makes you 
So it’s capable of rising over 15 k in a couple months but now it’s 5 years 
If you really just bought I feel a little sorry for you... but if you didn’t and you think saying such things will inspire a positive reaction in the gullible then you are a nasty person and should rethink your ways
and end with a dump
pumpin and dumpin all day
some weeks ago we recovered to almost 10k from 6k, so why panic?

i am in for the long run. in the long run bitcoin will blow up massively.

i just sold a little. always when i sell a bit price goes up...
Don't listen to this shill. He's on reddit everyday spreading FUD. If a person has so much time to spend spreading negativity on reddit all day every day, think about what kind of person he/she is. Obviously lives in mom's basement. 
Why haven't you been banned yet? You're nothing but a troll dude. In fact I'm just going to block you.
What I was really saying was these billionaires who REALLY hate bitcoins probably have found a way of suppressing it.  Do you think they'd just sit on their hands venting their hatred and doing nothing? 
Or three.
That's pretty close for gaining control of a 100 billion dollar market.
you mean the chart that shows it moving sideways? yeah, I see that too. It's a set up for the BART and there is no indication that it will go up. 
I wouldn't be surprised it it dropped further either but then unless you're a day trader, who's really bothered? You're either in this to make a quick buck or you believe it has a future.
$6110
It’s nearly $6200 right now, lmao.
Can we get more of that doubt?
I made a bundle when I sold at $10.00 lol
why would something that has a higher value than currently is priced need to go lower first so it can go higher 

that is against all trend following rules and i have no clue why idiots say this in here
yep, you can chart it to the day
Yah!  Give us more silly stories about why it will go to $100,000!
😔
AS we should, keep DCA, and this will be a mere blip in 6 years.
Yes, please.
thank you

It doesn't matter what products get launched if the price is manipulated on how the market is feeling products mean nothing. Last year the whales made there money off new money, but this year is different there is no new money hence the low volume, so the whales are making money off margin trades, and if we stop margin trading we all win but until then the whales win always. 
lol why would a larger exchange make more money with low volume

do you even know how markets work? 
Easily lower. 
I meant I miss seeing Barts appear.  We're overdue for one :)
it's Monday morning elsewhere
so you're telling me there's a chance
And this my friends is why Bitcoin is a very secure place to store your funds. Volatile? Yes in this early primitive stage of Bitcoin's path to dominance, but oh so secure.
Damn you with your fancy numbers!
Just put it in simple terms that my toddler like brain can comprehend..

Can I do it in a couple of hours by randomly smashing keys on my numberpad?
Much much lower actually. 
LOL

I'm not stupid and I have money. I wouldn't even think in trying to brute force addresses, it's just dumb. I just get a hard on seeing some large numbers.

I like large stuff
It's almost as if you have had this happen to you. 
They'll get rich off BTC the same day their Iraqi dinars revalue .
Ahhh another ignorant opinion. So what's your excuse ... too lazy to research? Or do you seriously believe there are no serious investors in Bitcoin? He he ... you are in for a rude awakening in the coming years.
Thanks! Just you have supported me. 
I think it's kinda like shaking a 2 liter of Pepsi and throwing it down. It makes a huge rocket explosion and you are so happy and laugh and dance as you watch it spew and jet around. Then, afterward, it's all over and you left with a sticky mess. 

Or, I could be using that as a double  entendre 
I bought so much bitcoin this morning and yesterday and was insanely stressed, until now... i am dancing. 
Alright buddy(1). Just saying... you surely could conquer great things with your unsupported negative fireside chats 
Americans dont need a reason to own guns. 
Yup. Much better to read the crap you and your buddies are spreading.


This guy fucks
I bought below 1K USD, so no.
I can only dream.. sub $1000 BTC.. fuck yeah
lots of problems out there, maybe we go through a longer term 3-4 year bear, but its unlikely
YEs Agreeing is welcomed and well said!
every market has peaks and valleys.  living in the valley is an opportunity to live on the peak
Fun and goofing around? 
That's not true.

When moon/lambo?
I mean that's fine. I don't trade. So, cool? 
Didn’t you sell (and leave) 
More like from 15k all the way to 5k. Still not selling.
Just saying. 
It went up 8%, you clown.

5760 to 6250 in one hour.
That's a difficult concept for someone who bought into the hodl meme.
i disagree. its already proven itself to be digital gold.  With the advent of Nano S's and Trezors this is even more obvious.  Putting your coins on a hardware wallet also give you experience with the technology, which most ppl don't ever experience because they just buy on Coinbase and panic sell 
They never had a digital replacement for gold for 5 thousand years. The next generation will in all likelyhood prefer using Bitcoin over gold because it aligns with their digital culture. That is a no brainer and regarding the volatility, well its extremely early. Considering the massive progress that Bitcoin has made in such a short time, it would be safer to assume that once regulations, infrastructure, ease of entry and awareness increase, Bitcoin will become a very well fitted choice for a store of value into years to come.
just because its called digital gold doesn't mean you can compare it use case's of gold.  They have different use cases.  Bitcoin is a technological invention similar to digital bank accounts with the difference being that you are the owner of the bank
The only reason gold is the price it is is because *it is traded* on exchanges and corner coin shops. Not the industrial or jewelry factor.


Gold isn't digital though. Try sending, buying something with, or even selling, gold. Not very easy.

If gold isn't digital, then what would be a digital version of gold?
i don't totally follow this, but id argue that ppl you are buying and holding now will reap the financial rewards as well as the benefits of using the technology while the later stage buyers will be buying because it has become accepted as part of society.  Whether that it becomes and asset in their 401k or they buy some to use it, or hold onto to make appreciation - but in smaller percentage terms
That's the thing, the extra "benefits of the technology" have no monetary value. Also, there is utterly no reason why governmental currencies couldn't start to use Blockchain, and those are regulated so they are much less susceptible to widespread manipulation as Bitcoin has been.
Long Beach? Bit chilly. Somerset UK, much nicer. ATM .....
I’ll Have a special wave for you 😘
You're the delusional one.
they (FED) already said they are looking to make their own DollarCoin linked to the USD so why would they care about BTC, spoiler alert: They don't.

And when they release their dollarcoin integrated by the biggest IT companies in the world like IBM, Oracle, Microsoft (They are already working on it WITHOUT use of bitcoin) bitcoin will be $0,004 overnight. 

Who the hell are you to call something a scam?

^edit: ^too ^strong
Yes I do, and if I had millions of extra ($) like all the big whales, I can prove it to you right now in less than a day!! 

Just think about all these billions made last year (around $300 billion). If a small group is controlling the majority of these billions, why wouldn't they get into the market again very cheap after flushing out all these week hands and make another $300 billions?! Would you let go such opportunity to buy very cheap and sell again at $20K in a very open decentralized market?! 
[removed]
LOLOL
[removed]
an analysis based on nothing* as I said, glad you liked it :)
That makes sense. I was a little confused on how you thought buying tether would somehow give you different returns from the cash part lol
I’d have a harder time sleeping knowing that I sold my precious coins and I’d miss the bounce.  I do understand the insomnia factor though.  War is hell.  Feel better. 
Better watch how you spending and what you selling
Would you like to know what it means? 
Bitcoin has THRIVED under pressure and negative publicity that would devastate larger companies. The negative publicity alone would put them out of business. Consider that.
Don't know about 12k but if this goes to 5k, I will be waiting for you there.

Going to short this crap to pieces.
Must be measured in Pluto years . . . .
There's not much to debate. Trading volume has been coming down for the last 6 months.

Three rallies produced three consecutive higher lows and they all started in the 6k-6,2k region. It was just a matter of time before whiling buyers to dry out while retailers continued to trade their payment-received bitcoins for hard-cash. 

The cycle for bitcoin to be used as a currency is still incomplete and there's no real bitcoin demand that justifies buying it at such high prices.

Then, you have the whalers which control a large portion of the bitcoin liquidity, making them very powerfull people, in the event of a ATH break. Such people are dangerous because they have the capability to manipulate the market in both directions.
There is no purpose of bitcoin 
Best Graphic Card to date.
Mass adoption will come soon enough. People will wake up and realize how shitty fiat is soon enough. Soon is ambiguous though. Could be 1 year, 5 years, 10 years, but it's coming.
If you are ok with going back to uncertainty and low-dollar valuations, if you call that survival, then sure.

It will not remain mainstream without some innovation.
Did you even read my post ? 

What country would benefit from bitcoin ? Give up your legal tender and in exchange get what ? Zero control over your money supply and a deflationary currency. Wow what a good deal. 

If the US makes exchanges illegal for example, that would be enough to kill bitcoin. Reasons are many, darknet, pedophilia, terrorism etc. So much bad shit is being done with bitcoin, it would be no problem to find an excuse.
If it's not a competing currency then what is it's point ? It's not an asset, it produces nothing. Commodity ? Commodity for what ? What is it's use ?
yes i know and it's correct

but tell that to the guy who has cash sitting and is greedy and the hype is on with mc afee saying 1mil$ per coin etc


If he can afford the booze.
you don't have to be smart to make a lot of money and to be rich
Day trading a bull market is easy.

Trading a bear one separates the men from the boys.
No.  It is a standard response of mine.  I just change the term of abuse written by someone like you :)
Not sure.  I think we get to 100k within 3 years based on price speculation and the next halvening in 2020.  

Eventually I think we get to at least the market share of gold. I have no clue how long that will take, maybe 7-10 years? 
I can see it start being used regularly as an alternate currency at that point as well.

Ultimately I hope it will overcome fiat and become the dominant currency. 
If you battle for global adoption, don't start with 3th world countries. They will follow when 1st world countries, where the big money is, start the adoption. 
Or tears of laughter at those who bought @ $19k
Not even close. 

When true despair hits - you'll know it. We're not there yet but it's coming. 
Nope.
As if such a small jump actually has any significance. How stupid are you? Have you not seen how poorly bitcoin has been doing over the past month and a half?
Because on my other account I was banned from this subreddit so I wanted to come back and keep shitposting.
actually it's dead for the over 300th time.
https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoinobituaries/
Can't remember the last time I actually called someone a loser so that's an inaccurate statement.
We're talking about entirely different market conditions now. Bitcoin is no longer a fringe currency. It's mainstream. As such, it's being weighed and tested as an investment. When the bubble popped, bitcoin was divested by all the normies who fomo'd in and now it's being collected institutionally because in a few years you'll start to see mass adoption. 
Oh be nice. :-) I think those people saying it would go supernova soon are off hiding with their tail between their legs.
Go read my history.

I said I will buy at 6k and the order got triggered.

To be candid, I wasn't expecting it to be triggered so soon.  Thought it won't happen till end of the coming week.

Pumpkin?

it was over hyped and a lot of FOMO in the last half of 2017. A lot of people are selling now and not as many are buying.
I mean they make their cut whether you buy or sell. High volume places their infrastructure under pressure and reveals the flaws and weak components. Low volume provides an opportunity to focus on improvement and upgrades. Exchanges are aware of these cycles and anyone looking at Bitcoin's 10 year chart can see these phases are very typical. Yes, people will lose money if they need it now. Otherwise prepare for a long road because nothing can evolve at the rate many people have been expecting from Bitcoin. Do you really honestly think Coinbase for example would have made the massive investment they recently made to accommodate the next phase if they didn't feel confident it was coming? This is what these guys do day in day out, EVERY day. They eat sleep and breath it, negotiating with partnerships and market studies on all aspects of crypto all over the globe. You really think you know something they don't?

Yes, [very secure](https://xkcd.com/538/) /s
Don’t get a hard on then.
Read my previous posts. Of course there's serious investors in bitcoin. They're the ones driving the price down so they can accumulate. Because they know in 5-10 years bitcoin will be a useful currency. 
having not seen that much action in a while, does your finger hurt? :)
Well done, well done

From the moment that every bad news is capable of wiping out 15% of the value in just 2 hours, the notion of stability is lost. 

The hardware does not make Bitcoin a digital equivalent of gold. That's just marketing. 

> The next generation will in all likelyhood prefer using Bitcoin over gold because it aligns with their digital culture.

Yes, the brainless culture. The culture of the instant gratification and easy access to everything. The culture incapable of waiting 5 minutes for someone to answer back a digital message. Yes, that generation which I'm part of. 

Honestly? No... that generation doesn't care about gold or its digital equivalents. They only care about travelling & life experiences. Oh, and btw... that generation is mostly broke and doesn't like maths.  
yes agree
So its not digital gold then? 

Anyway, I know what bitcoin is - it's a virtual commodity.  No more, no less.  It's value is only derived from what someone else will pay for it.  What someone else will pay for it is entirely based on what they will believe yet someone else will pay them.  In other words, it's 100% psychology.  

Gold is not psychology.  Gold has a real market. 
That is simply not true -  2/3rds of mined gold is used for jewelry, electronics, other industrial, and dentistry.  Only 5% goes to central banks.  And 25% to bars and coins (much of which is really in the form of collectibles). 


The vast majority of mined gold is put to use.  
Another way to think about this is:  why is gold expensive and silver (relatively) cheap? 

They're both noble metals.  Both relatively inert.  Both rare.  Both extracted though similar mining processes.  Both can be smelted and turned into coins and jewelry.  Both are used as stores of value.  Both have some industrial and electronic uses. 

There are actually fewer known reserves for Silver.  So why is silver cheaper? 

Gold is unbelievably beautiful.  It can be made into wondrous and highly sought after adornment.  It has heft - you know it when you hold it in your hands.  Silver is valued too, but it doesn't have that je ne sais quoi that gold has.  Gold is expensive because gold is highly desired - it is highly desired because it can be manufactured into items that people deeply desire.  
this is a good point, i have to think about it. One thing is the adoption of a technology.  Bitcoin is a very new technology and it hasn't been adopted yet where as gold was adopted and valued way before exchanges existed 
Gold ETF for one. . .


Ha ha what a ignorant statement. What FED are you talking about here .. one country? 2? Guess what? Bitcoin is global. The applications of a global and decentralized digital store of value are endless and the brightest among us have not even thought of what will likely unfold. With all due respect, open your mind a little!
Not going to kid anyone about the fact I had to look up *petulant*
Remember 2008 ? Bubbles pop..
Hello, inform yourself about Banca coin. It's at a good price now since the market is down.
None of them are safe.
Well.. Tether is not cash.
Or you and your holdings will be lying in chalk.
I would.🙌
Sure, please.
Who has bought consumables like groceries with bitcoin?No one and no one knows what the price is going to do.
Thanks for the reply.
Mass adoption was already needed,how will this be implemented and what is the date thereof?
You have way over simplified this. It wouldn't  be simply trading fiat for crypto. There would be 1000 steps in between. These things happen in baby steps and to think you know how before hand is not rational, otherwise we'd have had all our innovation at once.
It affects you... I reached a target.
Oooòooh a whole month and a half? In that case let's just tear down what took a decade to build, let's just throw in the towel because the Oracle of ass insight said it must be dead based on half a year out of a decade.
An 8% jump in half an hour is not the sign of an asset which is "dead". So to turn the question around, "how stupid are you?" oh wise one?
I admire your persistence and honesty :p
Ok fair enough but “this thing is dead” is also inaccurate 
HODL TILL 0
Yes. But not sure if you can on the mobile app. You can on the pc browser 

There is a group that does nothing but troll and shit talk. I have no patience, I just block haters
no, but my exwife is
because there is no value in btc
Thats in the past. 
HODL?
They are backed by huge investors who will pull out their money in a minute if volumes keep as low as they are now. 

I don't know what you're on, but it must be fun on your planet. 
Speaking of financial geniuses with their MIT-trained quants and Harvard School of Business financeers: Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers. How are they getting along these days?
Glad you agree with the logic. Maybe there's hope for your unjustified skepticism after all :)
Too late
OIUJA board must have turned itself back on 
Ok ...I saw bloated turf and assumed you were another bitcoin basher. I hate assumptions and I'm guilty of it too sometimes. My apologies:)
I guess I’ve just never understood time and effort put towards repulsiveness and negativity. It’s all a common interest. You can be my Shill antonym 
In what context?
:)
lets keep it simple.  Rich kids and adults want to have crypto on a Ledger Nano S or Trezor or whatever cause its cool.  Im not saying Bitcoin is going to make the world a better place.  Its a technology
yes but bitcoin is the longest running and most trusted blockchain.  how is that going to get upended unless we all adopt government blockchains and decide bitcoin is a joke
long term SoV. Nobody ever said it was stable as short-term SoV at the moment. Why do you like to cherry pick the timeframe when Bitcoin is not even 10 years old? 

Bitcoin has proven it's antifragility already from the S2X drama. It is digital gold. 
digital gold does not mean it can't be volatile.  Investing in gold is generally a longer time horizon type of investment and so far in Bitcoin's history if you hold for the long term you never lose, only gain
[deleted]
I disagree, Bitcoin's value is derived from its social network effect.  Its also an opportunity to own an a global asset that is outside the control of any government or person, but instead valued by the people of the world.  And don't forget its a technological invention.  

Btw Apples stock or Amazons stock value is only derived from what someone else will pay for it too, sure its value is affected by many factors like earnings per share blah blah..but bitcoin's value is also affected by many factors - they are just different and ppl stuck in the legacy mindset have a hard time understanding
maybe,

but at least i've made more money on bitcoin than you will ever on gold

lolz
But can you buy a car with that? It's not money, is it? Can you be 100% sure that the gold is actually in the vault? 99.99 % is not the same as 100%. If governments fail, if banks fail, can you be sure the gold is in the vault?
do you have any idea worldwide how much is traded in $ ? 

whatever

Someone who is in it for the tech is someone who runs at least one node. Someone who is actively involved in testing new layer developments. It's someone who watches presentations by the top devs and gets excited when they hear about atomic swaps, schnorr signatures, and lightning network. it's someone who seeks knowledge and understanding of all the pieces that makes bitcoin work. It's someone who sees bitcoin as a hobby rather than an investment vehicle. It's through this knowledge and drive to understand that makes one realize fiat conversion rates mean nothing. The tech development doesn't care about price. The top devs certainly don't care. Do you think brilliant devs who sacrifice everything for bitcoin improvements like Dr. Wuille care about price? Many of us are in it for the tech. Many of us don't care enough to tango with the get rich crowd. I'm a special kind of masochist I guess.

huh
You realize nearly 75% of its value has been lost in six months, right? Your point is completely invalid lol. Take a seat.
When bitcoin has lost nearly 75% of its value in six months, an 8% increase, especially since there has been a negative trend for so long, means absolutely nothing. To answer your question, I'm not stupid nor am I naive. I look at things objectively and I'm realistic. Sorry that displeases you in your fantasy land. 
Thank you!
It's objectively not actually dead, yes, but it's not flourishing or having any positive price action. The hype is over. This won't be going to ATH's. John McAfee is wrong.
My hero.
>There is a group that does nothing but troll and shit talk.

Yup. It seems there's a bunch of people that have made it their life's mission to downtalk bitcoin. Almost like - oh... I don't know... - like it's their job or something.

you do you. 

I wont pretend that I know what the FIAT price of BTC is doing. I do think BTC will be accepted as the preferred online currency in the future, so I want to collect as much as I can with the FIAT I can afford to spare.
It's called earth, if you'd like to join us we have no restriction on ignorance so give it a shot! 
You are ignorant regarding OTC impact. You confuse exchange profit with trade volume (even though you yourself referenced millions in one trade) and you have no vision of the future based on all that's happening in the crypto space around the globe. Yet you think I'm the one on another planet? Classy.
Image you owned an exchange. 6 months ago everyone became aware of crypto and the surge of volume was huge. You had to block new user signups, scramble to address security issues, higher more staff than you ever prepared to have, and try to maintain a credible rep. Now it's slowed down ...what would you do? Worry about low volume or fix those issues so you learned from experience like smart businesses do?
Remember.... early days of cars saw speed limits set to 20 mph so they would not spook the horses. THINK with an open mind.
You never understood people presenting opinions from both sides. So you are one of the shills who roped normies into buying this overpriced turd and then they lost all their money. Now you wonder why everyone isn't a shill, just like you. Grow up.

Oh, so that's why it is only about 30&#37; of its value from December. Thanks very for the insight!
Define "we all" -- I'll be that much less than 1% of all Americans now own BTC, or the population of any other country for that matter.
Check the gold value of the last 5 years. That's the meaning of stability.
Read what I wrote again. I left a hint there about my age. 
ZOMG - where to start?

Apple and Amazon generate profits.  Lots and lots of fucking profits.  A share is a partial ownership of that revenue stream and the promise of future revenue streams.  That's why it's valued.

Social network effect makes something useful - but lots of things are useful, doesn't mean they trade at 6,000/unit.  

Technical innovation - so?  There are technical innovations every day - that doesn't make it inherently valuable.  Why do I want a bitcoin?  Because it's innovative?  Bull Fucking Shit.  I want it because someone will pay me for it.  

Global asset out of control. . . - this is tin hattery - I don't engage in that realm.  If this is your world view it's a very very fringy one, and not grounded in anything real.  
Are you a fucking moron?

52 + 9 + 6 =67%

5% to Central Banks

25% to coins and bars

Exactly what I fucking said.
I see you edited

Anyway - a lot of people made fortunes on beanie babies (a lot more lost money) - but that doesn't make stuffed animals gold anymore that this digital chit is.  
Bitcoin isn't money. 


pretty big chances. join the telegram group Banca\_Official. I am DanyW in there, DM to discuss more if you are interested.
  I'm the kinda whale that little traders wanna be like

Mass adoption was needed asap and this is a crisis now,what date will mass adoption happen and how?
No, almost 75% of one single all time high that last for a few minutes lol. This time last year it was a third of what it is now, even at this drop. YOUR point is completely invalid, so rather than taking a seat just leave the building and go play with others who lack perspective on your level of one dimensional thinking. Run along now.
/r/IAmVerySmart
listen to this orcale guys! crypto is dead it hasnt been mooning for 6 months now! His 200 bucks aint a million yet its all over! better dump it!

...or write down his name and keep an eye out in the future among all those lambo post when the ride starts again. You will surely see him
You've said only enough to reveal your lack of insight on crypto, its history and what's going on present day. You also have no concept of the growth year over year and you're caught up in one single time frame with complete ignorance to just how much Bitcoin has thrived in the last decade. You come on to a reddit thread dominated by people who are well versed in the space and say such complete and utter nonsense with nothing to back up your claim other than a perspective of the past 6 months or so which is insane. You're either incredibly naive, ignorant or you're bored and like to act stupid to pass time.
I am quite certain either McAfee is (mostly) right or it’s headed to $0. The nature of BTC doesn’t leave much medium ground.
Thanks for this. 👍🏿
exchanges make money when there's is volume

they lose money when there is low volume


Reminds me of my pool guy. First, he was in some sort of pyramid scheme that was going to make him rich. Then he started putting all his money into Iraqi dinars and that was going to make him massively rich as soon as it RV'd (re-valued a/k/a "moon" here). Now, he's putting every last penny into BTC.

He's down more than half, but he still believes. Oh, and he's still cleaning pools.
Compensation for what?
The average joe has worst problems than what bitcoin can solve.  most ppl have no savings and just need money in general.  They can't afford to invest in BTC or anything for that matter.  There is an irony though in that the average joe has the most to gain if he were to invest in Bitcoin, just like he could if he got into Apple or Amazon or etc. early.  This is just a rule of the Matrix type world we live in.  
when i say we all I'm assuming that blockchain will be adopted and imo bitcoin will become much more adopted than it is now.  I don't see the benefit in government blockchains other than to increase efficiency 
very true, but Bitcoin is a new asset class where as gold has established itself over 5000+years.  And if you bought gold in the 70's and held until now your asset has appreciated 
i guess we will find out who is right in the long run.  If this is your opinion then why are you on r/bitcoin?  If you think Bitcoin is a joke then go buy regular stocks.

Bitcoin is a technological invention and it hasn't been really adopted yet.  Thats the risk early adopters take, but they will reap the financial rewards, whereas late adopters will be users of the technology and will get financial incentive but not like the early adopters
Been spending most my life, hodling in a bearish paradise.
Mass adoption takes time. Clearly no one can give you a date that's not possible. This isn't a crisis. Bitcoins long term trend is doing extremely well. People who think and say this is a crisis have no idea what they're talking about.
You realize most of the ATH's of last year barely lasted any amount of time, right? 'Cause you DO know bitcoin was parabolic for most of the year, right? Again, your point is invalid and mine isn't lol. Thank you though. You can run along now.
No rebuttal proves my point...
Nope. Already sold all I had lol. I'm good. 
"You come on to a reddit thread dominated by people who are well versed in the space..." stopped reading after this. How stupid are you really?
The only thing he's right about is that speculation is pointless and so is applying trends to graphs to "predict" price action.
Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't the daily trading volume still insanely high on top exchanges like Binance? I know they don't trade the same volume as in Dec/Jan but the volume is still WAY more than what you're implying. Do you think in these volatile times that big exchanges are hurting? They're making a killing! Not the killing they made in Jan but they also have a lot of the links worked out.
[deleted]
Blockchain yes, Bitcoin no. In 20 years, Bitcoin will be remembered as a gimmick investment, like mood rings and Beanie Babies.
You say things like "bitcoin is digital gold" without understanding what gold is.  That's my issue.  It's total bullshit.

A bitcoin costs roughly 5X what an ounce of gold costs.  IDK about you, but I work hard for my money, and I'm not going to buy something that costs 5X what an ounce of gold costs without getting something for it.

Now - I might spend that on a lavish vacation and enjoy the fuck out of that.  I might spend it on a used car and get some use out of it. I might buy my wife a really nice present and get a happy wife/happy life return.  I might spend it on a few shares of Apple as in investment - and the only reason I would do so is because I hope to get a return on that investment.

Now sell me a bitcoin.  I can't eat it.  I can't wear it.  I can't do anything with it that I can already do with money.  It doesn't give me pleasure to own. I can't display it for all to see.  

So why would I own bitcoin?  Because it's innovative? fuck you.  I'm not spending 5X what an ounce of gold costs because its fucking innovative.  

Because it's not part of the banking system?  Please, I'm not a fucking sex or drug trafficker.  The banking system suits me just fine.

Because of network effects?  You've got to be fucking kidding me. 

The only reason I would buy a bitcoin is because I think the price is going higher.  That's it.  Convince me the price is going higher and I'm in.  Otherwise it's as useful as a beanie baby to me.  

So it had a good run, and there's enough true believers out there who still think this is some kind of game changer.   But everything bitcoin does (or actually doesn't do because, let's face it, there's still lots of problems here) the banking system has figured out a long fucking time ago. 

But it is useful for illicit trade - money laundering, black market stuff.  I'll give you that.

Other than that. . . it's about the furthest thing from gold you can imagine.


> Thats the risk early adopters take, but they will reap the financial rewards

Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but we have already ripped those rewards. 

No one can can give a exact date or guesstimate so it could be in a years time or in 100 years time,you cannot argue this point I just made.So its something at this stage that has no practical use in the real world for even simple day to day tasks like buying groceries.It is volatile and unpredictable,how long has bitcoin been around and you cant buy groceries with it directly?
Bitcoin has gained 68% of its value in the last 12 months. It doesn't look like you have a point...
How stupid? OK, I realize your used to being evaluated on your level of stupidity but that's just not how I roll. Further more, how about to appease you, I revise my statement to "You come on to a reddit thread dominated by people who are obviously far more versed than you in the space..." there! Now its accurate!
what is your source on this? 


Interesting. That's not the direction I expected you to go.
so why are you on r/bitcoin then?if you think its worthless than wouldn't your time be better spent somewhere else?
Bitcoin being digital gold only means it has similar characteristics to gold, but they are not the same.  So comparing the cost structure is not a good comparison.  

Ok so you say Now Sell me a Bitcoin.  A big reason to own bitcoin is because it is a technology based on math and computer science that is outside the control of any person or government.  There is also a limited supply and don't forget why Bitcoin was invented -  out of the financial crisis.  Now that bitcoin exists, there is competition to the legacy financial system
Lol yes I'm sure a lot of ppl did cash out but making money is not the only reason the bitcoin technology was created.  For me personally, i know that when it breaks the next ATH's i will probably regretfully sell some only to watch it double to 40k or wherever it goes.  However, i will always keep a decent amount for long term 5-10 years, and i imagine that any early adopters/believers who did sell at the last ATH's did not sell all of it
Just because no one can give an exact date doesn't mean it wont be within a decade. Just because you can't use it at your local grocery store doesn't mean it isn't being used at all. Adoption is growing by the day. You need to do some research about fiat to understand why cryptocurrencies is the real deal. Maybe it isn't bitcoin, definitely the safest bet right now, but cryptocurrencies are here to stay, and centralized money backed by faith in incompetent governments will be worthless. You sound young, so you should be able to handle the volatility, why do you think so many people say it's a long term investment. If you can't handle the volatility don't buy it, but when adoption grows, and bitcoin stabilizes, price will be much higher then.
You clearly didn't read my comment so I'll say it again. In \*six\* months. Bitcoin has lost. Nearly \*75&#37;\*. Of its value.
Still an inaccurate statement lol. You don't know how well or not well-versed I am based on a handful of comments on a website that's a cesspool for stupidity. You're full of bad points...
Because it is profitable to short and sometimes there is interesting news here with helps make trade decisions. When is it getting back to 19000?
"similar characteristics to gold"
  
No, no it doesn't. And your keep repeating this makes you look dumber and dumber.

"it is a technology based on math and computer science that is outside the control of any person or government". 

That's why I'm going to spend my hard earned money?  You've got to be fucking kidding me - there isn't a 100B dollars investing in bitcoin because of such nonsense.  

"There is also a limited supply". Everything has a fucking limited supply - that's the entire study of economics.  

"why Bitcoin was invented - out of the financial crisis". What problem in the financial crisis does it solve?  

"Now that bitcoin exists, there is competition to the legacy financial system" To what end exactly?  Besides which, it doesn't answer why I'd spend money to own it.
You clearly didn't read mine. In * twelve * months. Bitcoin has gained. 68% of its current value. What exactly is your point?
Unless some major negative news comes out id say by the end of this year. Maybe 10k -12k sometime this summer
Bitcoin has similar characteristics to gold in that over time the people that hold onto it have been rewarded in its appreciation.  But there are many difference's between the assets.

The fact that bitcoin is a technology that is valuable and gives control to the users and the entire world can participate outside of what their government thinks is a value proposition.  You don't have to participate though if you think its bullshit.

Financial Crisis - The federal Reserve decides on the monetary supply.  Bitcoin takes that power away from them.  Bitcoin also solves the problem of centralized sources becoming too powerful.  However it would be possible for a centralized source to buy a lot of bitcoin, in that case only early adopters would benefit.

Bitcoin's existence is competition to the legacy system just like email was/is to the post office.  
The financial crisis showed a lot of flaws in the banking system and caused many to lose trust in the system. Bitcoin bypasses the banks and currency exchanges providing a possibly better alternative. And not everything has a limited supply. Renewable resources are a thing. 
The chief banker of the Netherlands said it best: "At least with tulip bulb you got a pretty flower. With Bitcoin, you get nothing."
That in less time it lost more...

Your point?
"Bitcoin has similar characteristics to gold in that over time the people that hold onto it have been rewarded in its appreciation." 

This is so vague as to be a meaningless statement.  What other things have people hold onto have been rewarded?  Please.  

"The fact that bitcoin is a technology that is valuable and gives control to the users and the entire world can participate outside of what their government thinks is a value proposition."  The black market, sex trafficking, money laundering, terrorism, drug trade are the only real value adds here.  

"Bitcoin takes that power away from them."  Nonsense.  Bitcoin is not money.  Repeat that again as many times as you need to to understand. Bitcoin is not money.  It has zero implications on monetary supply.  None. 

Anyway, you're too far bought into this BS to have a productive conversation - so go ahead and believe what you want to believe.  But just know it's a load of nonsense.


Fucktarded.

The problem with the banking system aren't rooted in "too few regulations". 

JFC

Renewable resources ARE fucking limited.  It costs money to harvest them. Until you invent, for example, an unfuckinglimited supply of fucking solar panels you aren't going to fucking harvesting that solar power, for fucking example, are you?

Fuck - this is exhausting. 
I think the more important question here is do you even own Bitcoin?  
I can tell you know nothing about what you are talking about since you felt inclined to use the word "fuck" 7 times in your reply. If you actually read my reply, you would be able to see that I said nothing about banking regulations. And yes, the ability to harvest renewable resources may be limited, but the resources themselves are unlimited. Unless the sun explodes and the world ends. 
Owning Bitcoin doesn't suddenly make you more wise. 
Good lord - You are really ignorant about this stuff.  Not going to spend the time to educate you.  Don't know what to tell you man - you need to get off boards and stop reading fringe blogs.  


sure but it makes you experience the technology versus having an opinion on something that you've never experienced 
and if you experience bitcoin (especially if you put on a hardware wallet) and then decide its not for you, id doubt you would spend any more time on forum's such as r/bitcoin.  Cause whats the point of debating ppl about a subject/technology you don't like.  A person's time is way more valuable
