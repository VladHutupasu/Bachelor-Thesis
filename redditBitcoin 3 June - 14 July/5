Daily Discussion, July 10, 2018 -- TITLE
It's coming home
I'm scared, HODL me. 
Generally speaking, anyone who makes money in a bull market is labeled a genious.  Anyone who loses money in a bear market is labeled an idiot 
Is there even a single crypto that doesn't follow BTC's change in value? The entire market looks rather like a single currency.
BTC dominance: 43% and climbing

Bcash: 0.109 and falling

Looks pretty good to me: shake out the shitcoins.
It could go up, down or sideways. And according to my TA, several big investors might create a large green or red candle by buying it... OR selling at an unpredictable time. 
LMAO, 8 years later and people still pretending like they're experts and know which way Bitcoin is going to move. Many of them probably never even heard of Bitcoin 3 years ago. Cracks me up.
Moon boys getting their money slowly taken off them while they celebrate the small jumps that are always followed by the massive dumps.

Ahhhhh 🐴 💩
I’m pretty disgusted 
Coindesk, ccn, bitcoinist, CryptoSlate, Bitcoin Magazine, cryptovest, Coinspeaker, etc. are not news sources. They're just a collection of click bait articles specifically written to karma farm on reddit for ad views


All the fear mongering trolls are back hahaha, look at you all spewing your bullshit again. 
Bull run started they said. Pump incoming they said. Just hodl they said. 
back to daily -5% -7% drops. 
I'll sit here quietly waiting for Alessio's new video. XD
**100 Merchants Can Now Trial Bitcoin's Lightning Network Risk Free**

https://www.coindesk.com/merchants-bitcoin-lightning-network/

A few lucky merchants now have one less obstacle to accepting bitcoin payments via the Lightning Network.

Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, payment processing startup CoinGate is opening up a pilot program that will allow 100 merchants to trial a Lightning-enabled version of its service, one which taps into the open-source tech meant to make bitcoin transactions fast and cheap.

As with CoinGate's standard service, the company will handle the finer details of crypto-to-fiat exchange, however, the new pilot has the benefit of covering the costs should funds be lost due to the early-stage nature of the software (lightning implementations are now largely in beta).

And while most experts believe the network still isn't ready to support significant commercial transactions, CoinGate CTO Rytis Bieliauskas thinks there's a greater good that will be achieved in being among the first to test the waters.

He told CoinDesk:

"It's a very new technology. Inevitably there will be some bugs, either in our implementation or in the Lightning Network. It will help, not just us, but the whole community because the bugs we find might help the whole protocol."

Although Lightning invoices are typically limited by the protocol itself to 0.042 bitcoin each, or under $300 according to current prices, CoinGate CCO Vilius Semenas told CoinDesk there's no established limit to how many invoices CoinGate will reimburse if funds are lost.

At least for the time being, few shoppers have the resources to send cryptocurrency from a Lightning wallet such as Zap. But this pilot could test whether Lightning actually tackles some of the issues that deter mainstream merchants from prioritizing crypto payments in the first place.

For example, bitcoin's latency presents an issue for CoinGate clients like the Romania-based adult content platform LiveJasmin.

"Instant payments are the most important from our point of view," Tamás Szerencse, head of payments at LiveJasmin, said, expanding on why the company joined CoinGate's Lightning pilot.

With up to 40 million daily visitors, LiveJasmin could become one of the biggest mainstream merchants to experiment with Lightning so far. Experimenting with more diverse transaction types could provide invaluable insight into how Lightning works out in the wild.

Learning from experiments
As such, CoinGate is emerging as one of a small, but growing number of crypto payment processors to take the leap. (Last week GloBee helped crypto hardware wallet accessory provider CryptoCloaks accept its first payment.)

Still, most acknowledge there's still a long way to go until mainstream merchants could safely use Lightning.

Steve Beauregard, the founder of the payment processor GoCoin, told CoinDesk he agreed with Bieliauskas that layered networks might be able to reduce friction for recurring payments, but he acknowledged the tech is still in its infancy, which is likely to limit shoppers.

"It's still very complicated for an average end-user to use it [Lightning]," Beauregard said. "I think the ones that benefit the most would be international merchants that are trying to accept payments from overseas."

The majority of merchants who applied for this pilot were businesses like collectibles maker Bitgild, which offers silver and gold coins engraved with QR codes for real cryptocurrency, catering to clients who are already fascinated by Lightning experiments.

Beyond cross-border payments, Bieliauskas argued Lightning-enabled transactions could soon provide a cheaper option than credit cards for merchants dealing with micropayments or payments worth a fraction of a penny.

For now, Beauregard said the primary value such Lightning pilots offer is an opportunity to participate in experimental research.

Speaking to that point, renowned Lightning developer Alex Bosworth agreed this pilot will provide a learn opportunity for the whole network. Lightning's most useful features for merchants are still in development.

Bosworth told CoinDesk:

"In the future, one nice thing about Lightning merchants is that if they invoice you in one currency and the payer wants to pay in a different currency, that will be possible."
We fell for the early adopter meme.

Daily Hopium (season finale)*:



I hope this guy kept those 11 btc and didn’t sell for 290!


—-

r/Bitcoin

I accidentally bought 11 btc.

u/dbthegimp - 3yr

It appears as if Coinbase upon failing to debit an account through ACH (say there arent enough funds) will try again. This didn't used to happen. So I placed an order to make up for the one I thought would cancel when I saw the failed ACH debit and overdraft in my account. Nope, now I have an extra 11 btc. No more than a month ago this wasn't part of the functionality that I experienced in this situation.

Oh well, guess I'll have to wait a week for those 11 btc to get in and then sell them for 290.

* This is the final episode of season one of Daily Hopium.  We hope you have enjoyed the last month of special programming.  Most importantly we hope you now have a better understanding of the cyclical nature of bitcoin and that better days should be ahead. 

Daily Hopium will return ...
Everyone here is quickly becoming an early adopter.

In @ 2.5K!
Where's my daily hopium at?
Down by 4%
Every time we get a decent rally, it drops back even lower. 

On average each drop keeps taking us down $980 lower. 

That means this next drop is probably taking us somewhere around $5.5k 
It won't go lower than $6k trust me
Get ready for the BGD!

How low can it go?
Who's selling at this point? Miners? Surely everyone else would of sold weeks ago if they was going too!

Weekend is going to destroy the price. Looking at 6100-5800
Bitcoin has basically moved sideways for a month - something it has not done since the recent decline from January highs. SEE IMAGE > [https://imgur.com/JaXDPgv](https://imgur.com/JaXDPgv)

This may mean nothing, but it seems to be losing downward steam and could be ready to head north. NOBODY knows, but it is interesting that this is the first month in a long time that has seen level price.
This is good for Bitcoin. 
who wants to get BTC?    

me!!!
one more drop then fill those shorts boiiiis

  he's a bitcoin genius -

Open your short positions as we will be retesting 5800 this week
guys, remember that bitcoin was only 2k this time last year...we've done a 300% in one year, which in and of itself is absolutely amazing!
If you haven't already, PLEASE comment on the proposed Bitcoin ETF that the SEC is considering. Here is a comment that has already been submitted that you can use for inspiration:

"I strongly support the proposal of Bitcoin ETF.

In December because of SEC approval of Futures, Bitcoin went up from $3K to $20K. we again need SEC help to make money for small retail investors who lost lot of money in last 7 months. ETF has potential to take the price of Bitcoin from $6K to $30K in few days and that can start the new crypto cycle and help US economy during these trade wars.

ETF will be the great news for US economy. crypto is the future and US can lead the world by allowing ETF.Crypto Investors around the world is eagerly waiting for SEC to approve it and support this revolution."
it's a weak hands test before the pump. Whales making sure they will not get dumped on while pumping. 
Still calling 4.5k this month.

Now all we have to do is hold around here and bust through the upcoming cloud.  Then bull run BEBE!

And, this is the natural growth we were talking about?
SELL!!!

Money is evil, yesterday In my heart I deeply knew when bitcoin floated around 6666.00 just like it previously before going down under 6k their was more to this then just investing.  They feed on our animal behavior and how we neglect families and friends from losing money and losing control of our kind hearted soul and inner peace.  Wake up everyone they are coming for you.  Be strong and brave and be kind to all.

I'm thinking of starting a white paper study group in my neighborhood. I'm thinking we could do it every Wednesday night. Have some snacks, drinks, catch up with the neighbors a little bit, and then as a group study a section of the white paper and discuss what we've learned. 

Is anyone in the Iowa area? If so, let me know and we can get this rolling! 
Let's go, bulls!!!
I just talked to my stock broker friend again and he said that the big players are turning on the faucets to the institutional money at 2pm SHARP! Jamie Diamond is PISSED and trying to stop this from happening, but he can't do much right now because the board at JP Morgan is keeping a close eye on him since they're thinking of replacing him with a more crypto friendly CEO.

Edit: Downvote all you want, bcashers, but it doesn't change anything.

Edit: When I talked to my friend at "Bitcoinman Sax" he said that under NO CIRCUMSTANCES was anyone on his team going to buy BCASH because it's a huge scam by Roger Ver. They are investing ONLY in Bitcoin.
UPDATE: I just got off the phone with my stock broker friend and he said that the everyone at bitcoinman sax is FREAKING OUT right now. Apparently Jamie Diamond threatened to fire everyone if they invested in bitcoin and people are scared. He can't keep the lid on this forever, though, and there is already an underground resistance fomenting. Most traders on my friends team are planning on investing in bitcoin secretly but they have to do this after work otherwise they might get fired by Jamie Diamond. My friend said that most people in his office are home by 5:30pm so we can expect to see a large boost at that time. Some people are even plotting to see how they can get home faster than other people on their team so they can buy in first before the price spikes, LOL! Apparently it's all over Wall Street as a big middle finger to Jamie Diamond.

Edit: GS stock is DOWN today on this news! Investors will not have it!

Edit 2: It looks like tons of GS investors are selling their stock to invest in bitcoin directly. Jamie Diamond can't stop them all.

WE HAVE LIFTOFF, BOYS! STRAIGHT TO THE MOON! 
Thanks everyone for the TREMENDOUS response to my white paper study group. My Wednesday group is full (sorry! I only have about 10 devices that can handle Skype) but a few people have suggested another idea which I think is great.

I'm going to be starting a weekly community meeting where we can discuss bitcoin, study the white paper, and organize community outreach projects. So in addition to our Wednesday night white paper study, we'll also have a group meeting on Sunday morning. I'm looking for a place to host this now (I'm thinking we can rent a space in a strip mall cheaply and easily).

If anyone has suggestions for our activities I would LOVE to hear them! So far I'm very interested in organizing some outreach ideas:

\- Door to door canvassing. Maybe there are some teens or young adults that could do this during the day?

\- Let's organize a group project to help build blockchain infrastructure in countries that are less fortunate. I'm thinking Haiti, South America, or parts of Africa?

\- For people unable to do door to door canvassing, let's print some pamphlets we can leave on people's windshields, in their mailbox, at bus stops, etc. Let's spread the word!

This is super exciting. Let's DO THIS!
Lol I honestly can care less about crypto I'm happy in life doesn't matter if it goes up or down I just like to see people lose or win btw we're going down so hope to see you guys at the fire sale 
[removed]
Please post here if you would like to join my white paper study group! I'll be hosting it in a location TBD (in Iowa), but I would LOVE to have people call in through Skype or Facetime, too! Each week we'll really dig into a part of the white paper and discuss what we've learned.

Edit: Spaces are filling up quick! Thanks everyone!

Nope.

I've read that before somewhere ..
Do you think there's a bigger dump to come?
Oh shit. It's gone sub- $6400.
Why?
Where do you get your news?
Exactly.
Haha ... didn't know reddit is a source for data.
Institutional money they said.

Awesome, dude! Just what we need!

Can you come share this with our white paper study group this Wednesday night?
Long term yes, short term probably no
In theory, the Bitcoin Network will adjust the level of difficulty in mining blocks to keep miners solvent and incentivized.  Still, I am not sure how the math 'trickles down' to smaller players vs. the hash rate mills.  The level of difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks.  And based on the time it took to find the previous 2016 blocks. At the desired rate of one block every10 minutes, 2016 blocks would take exactly two weeks to find. If the previous 2016 blocks took longer than two weeks to find, the difficulty is reduced. If they took less than two weeks, the difficulty is increased. The change in difficulty is in proportion to the amount of time over or under two weeks the previous 2016 blocks took to find. 
https://blog.bitmex.com/mining-incentives-part-1-the-difficulty-adjustment-and-mining-profits/

That's a complicated question because the cost of mining isn't evenly distributed so some miners make more than others.
Their profit margins are quite large, so the price can dip a lot before they're in the red.

What robbery? The Bancor thing yesterday?
Building a dream house in paradise with my wife. Off grid bamboo. Gonna grow food and catch water. Gonna have kids in a year or so. I surf almost every day. DJ on the weekends.

It wasn't easy or without risk or challenge or fear of failure. I decided BTC was my generations best hope of freeing ourselves from the slavery that is the USD. I ran the first BTM in my city during the bear market of 2014 and converted all profits to btc. I got contacted by the IRS and had to shut that down cuz getting Money Transmitter license was too costly. I quit working/graduated college in 2015 with a psych degree, moved oversees, started building a btc network there, and took the plunge to become a dedicated trader. I rode the bull market up for 2 years only going long. I've been shorting since January. Absolutely crushing it. I now work intermittently as opportunity presents itself. 


Extra 11 bitcoins. How many bitcoins he might have in total. 
that comment in response though..."I'd say enjoy your 11 BTC. Perhaps you'll look back on it as a blessing in disguise." DAMN WAS HE RIGHT

I noticed that as well
thats it! bitcoin is deader than dead! /s
Actually, Bitcoin hasn't gone down any lower for a month now, and that could be a sign that the dropping trend you're referring to is leveling off. SEE Bitcoin past month> https://imgur.com/JaXDPgv
It's called a descending trading range... nothing abnormal about that.
Merely the trend since February, so shouldn't be much of a surprise.
Why not? It did in June 
not gonna happen, we failed the breakout last night.
It can't go below 0
In trading, two things are certain:
1) An asset will never go up indefinitely.
2) It can always go down to zero.
Pre 2013 price - $200.

Unlike stocks which appreciate in price when the company increases in performance, there is absolutely nothing to justify the increased price premium between $200 and $20,000.
Like 3k maybe, but hopefully not
Answer is kinda obvious.

a.  Short sellers who thinks the price will drop further (of course, they might be wrong and get rekked later).

b.  People who bought at lower prices and taking profit off the table now because they think the price will drop further.

Its not that ppl are selling, its that ppl arnt buying 
I might have to sell quite a bit this week or next week.  My reason?  I am going on a mission trip and need to pay for the expenses.  Unusual reason I guess?  I keep delaying selling as long as possible though.

It might be good for bitcoin. But its making my life hell.
FUD, mods please delete.
I've already shit my shorts, thinking about switching to a colostomy bag.  Anybody want a sniff? 
?
Nope, 5k, as people already satisfied with 6k as the new high.
300% gain for $2k would be $8k, not $6,300.
You can't even get simple multiplication right...
I don't care what they say - we're still in the middle of an INCREDIBLE bull run!
Yes ETFs will provide many with an easy point of entry and if they are offered globally, the volume will prevent smaller groups from synchronizing market manipulation. It may actually contribute to manipulation short term, but long term yes, this would be really good for crypto and for legitifying investment in this space.
so like, a crypto bailout? f'in lol.
A Bitcoin ETF is just another tool for more speculation.  If you think CBOE is looking after BTC's interest, you are wrong.  To them, it's just another way to earn more commission and giving you more ropes to hang yourself.
Something that has potential to fuel a massive massive bubble is good for the US economy?
Make no mistake - everyone that bought high has it grim. It will be a chance if this market recovers.
very wishful thinking there dude
Its just a 7 month long bear trap / Very bullish

Technically speaking, It's not a risk, an address is not meant to be hidden. 

But everyone is able to see how many bitcoin there is on this address. And if it's a big amount, the poster can be targeted (hacking, social engineering...)  
public key, no. Private yes.
Beggar!
It's not if you never reuse the same address. 
Price is in a down trend since January. Dont think anyone is talking about natural growth haha
In favor of the so called "bottom bulls" probably ... ;-)
for me, its bullish.
Interesting, thanks
I don't like that he has been shorting BTC since January. I feel like he has been profiting through others misfortunes.

Edit: I'm downvoting this. Bullish news only please.

Edit 3: And there's liftoff, right after markets closed just as I predicted!!!! Looks like the traders made a BEELINE for their home computers LOL!
Do you mean Dimon? 
Crypto has bright future most people agree on that but it takes time.
As for people who were burned, they are a tiny fraction of the number of potential investors, but again these things take time. Own some crypto, a modest amount that isn't going to stress you out and one day in the hopefully not too distant future, you'll be glad you did. That's the only real solid strategy unless you have some inside information on these pump and dumps.
Everything will reverse in due time. Greed is also is a powerfull beast just like fear is. Trust me once greed kicks in it will shit on all charts and history.
Dude, futures and shorting.   The only thing I’ve read is by a redditor I despise. However, if I would have followed his scheme this past month I could have quit my job. “Short every rally”.  I think it’s a shit way to “invest” but it could ya e worked.  I’m over all this crap.  A few pumps to keep me around... the. Huge inorganic dumps.

No not a genius makes money in a bear market. A whale makes money in a bear market. An extremely lucky person makes money in a bear market. There’s no mathematical equation or science involved to determining about people respond to a bear market or the manipulation involved. It’s not about an Einstein intellect, only God can accurately predict how a market fluctuates in a bear market.
Hm, what a great price chart.
Is now a good time to buy?
Yeah I ate some beans
They'll never find us down here Captain!

Good point, fire torpedo one.  And steward, bring me my brown trousers.
Institutional money packed up and left when the SEC said cryptos weren't securities. HODLers in their naivety celebrated; investors pulled back.  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯  
Institutional money will await for regulatory clarity. This has been known for a while. That could take weeks, months, or years.
Hodlers are the same reason the price went all the way to $20,000.
Quite the contrary, it is the best defence against market manipulation if you spend a few moments thinking about it :)

It depend on their operational cost. Mainly electricity and efficiency of the rigs. Then, rent and staff.

Country with low cost of electricity and labor have a clear edge against western country with expensive electricity and cost of labor.

At the cost of my electricity, I would be in the red operating a Bitmain S9 atm even if I would not take into account rent and labor as a hobby miner. So BTC mining at this leverl of difficulty and available hardware is already not profitable for some countries. It’ll will be kept for large mining operation or hobby miner having access to cheap electricity.

Profit are in the toilet for miners. Also for GPU mineable altcoin. You can buy GPU from Nvidia by 10 units now. They were limited to two unit per person until recently and that’s when they were in stock, now it seems Nvidia would like to get rid of their oveprovisionned stock.
nope [cryptotrunks.com](https://cryptotrunks.com) 
Yes as far as I can see every time there's a robbery of millions($) of Bitcoin, that's exactly when the price drops hundreds of dollars.
My man!  Congrats!  

A few questions, please:

Did you acquire this wealth via bitcoin investing or some other way?  


Did you ever sell the 11 btc or did you hodl? 

What advice would you give newbies here about bitcoin/crypto investing? 

Thanks for updating us. 
Reading the comments is sometimes the best part. 
FUD
idk
The 1 week chart is disgusting. A brief fight before this unnecessary unexplained shit storm 
Thanks for a answer. Sounds risky to me! 
Nice bull run just after you sell! Lol
Never invest money you need for anything else. PERIOD.
Nope cant do that till you get your head out of the sand.
And you are a spam/scam account.
sad
You've been corrected many times... pay attention (unless of course you are trolling, in that case... bravo)
… Im not.
Nope, bear market. Sure, it was at $2000 a year ago. That's irrelevant. Most people bought > 10 k anyway and the price this time next year could be $1000. Thanks for the optimisim, but lets live in the real world
 
You have very little understanding of how ETFs work.  Let me try to explain it (again) to you:

a.  Cash based ETF - Zero sum game, no increase in size of market.  Pooled funds are used to buy BTCs.  Since this is a single asset ETF, cash based unlikely to be used.

b.   Synthetic ETF - Derivative, zero capital goes into BTC market.  The ETFs are traded as a function of BTC's price.  This will be the likely ETF for BTC.

In short, neither scenario does any good for BTC.

Like I said - this is just another gimmick that trading houses want to create to earn commission for themselves and provide you more ropes to hang yourself.
No, nothing like a bailout. Bitcoin has a fixed supply (new coins CANNOT be minted). Please read the white paper. 
You mean economic growth that will help make the U.S. a leader in the cryptoconomy?
Agree with your $4500k prediction (over next 2 months I think)
No, no, NO!
public key =/= hashed public key. the address is the hashed public key    
BEAR all the way
I don’t believe you. 

But anyway, I’m not a fan of the idea of shorting (more so if he did it on margin).  He also longed since 2015 which was absolutely the right move. 


Point is, bitcoin has provided this man the freedom he desired in life.  It shows what is possible.   
In which part of the world is that tea-time?
OK but please keep in mind: my advice is for entertainment purposes ONLY. Sorry my friend at the sax said I needed to say that on here.
Did you read my disclaimer? My advice is for entertainment purposes ONLY.
Jamie Diamond shut it down. 
Lol
It's happening now! Looks like it's early!!!
no, his friend works in a boiler room (called Bitcoinman Sax) owned by Jamie Diamond (former close up magician)


?
You sound too sensible to be here. Well put.
Sorry bro .... but I seriously think regulators stepping in is heaven for short positions.
You owned him hard
beautiful
Nope I just like to make random prediction like John McAfee bc out there anyone believes in anything lol
$6k is bottom.  I'm calling it.
Pedal to the metal retard indeed 
I'm planning on going to his white paper study group
Some of them must have made it home early.
Either he is “the quilt guy” or MrManHimself
?
I love it! 
That's so bitcoin! Awesome!
or couldnt care more.

Lol, so basically I need to dumb it down. 
Sure, who wouldn't shill their own project and something they believe in? By the way, trying our hardest to stand apart from projects without substance. Would love your thought and feedback about our actual work
I hope not - things might get ugly! HEHE!
It has a husband alike object. 
wow... this comment thread is a trainwreck. people making arguments against each other and both are completely wrong and neither has a clue on the topic they are discussing...

Bear markets still follow patterns and an educated/knowledgeable investor can still make money. obviously there are exceptions, but for the most part those who have done this enough can make money... That doesn't make them a genius and that doesn't mean that they just got lucky or are a whale.
Buy the dip!
HODLers celebrated because they think that scarcity makes an asset more valuable. They have yet to understand that it is market demand that makes assets valuable...


Yep they'll bought all the way up to 20k and will hold all the way down to 2k
...and subsequently lost all their money. A few random people here and there are profiting off Bitcoin, but the majority is going to people much smarter and richer than all of us.
And how's that been working out???
Yes you are right but most people panic and give up their shit for cheap. Most people don't look past next week let alone the time its takes for things like this to mature and thrive. Holding a modest amount of crypto will serve anyone well if they can get past this day to day shit. It takes years to evolve and nothing can change that.
There is zero market 'manipulation' going on right now. just weak panic buys followed by strong panic sells by the people who discovered crypto in 2017.
Lol.
You mean “bitcoins worth of millions” ? 
Investing in bitcoin, dollar cost averaging for 2 years.

Best advice for newbs who are hoping for a home run - dont try to increase your USD. Try to increase your BTC.

I've always been selling. I bank in it.
You've made this mistake before. History indicates you'll be wrong again. 
It's not risky if you have lots of Bitcoins. 

A whaler with 20K BTC, is perfectly capable of dumping half of its coins and make the market drop like a stone. After the drop, he can rebuy his previous position and still make a decent profit. 
Right!  Then I ask God "Why?" Granted, we thought we had several coins hacked but they were rather miraculously saved (long story) so my husband and I told God that they were His to do what He willed with.  So if the price is low, I shouldn't worry about it. As far as we are concerned they are not really ours now as we have given them to God.  I would just like to see them back at almost $20K.
But we invested in 2013 and may not have what we "needed" now unless we invested then.  
Why not? It might drop even lower than you say and it might not even drop any more until after another little  pump. You cant possibly know when these large players organize these big sells and buys. If there's one thing they do well it's not giving any indication of when they will make their move. That much has been established.
No. I am in bitcoin for the technology. I don't care about the price and I will NEVER ask for donations. If you feel moved to donate from my posts, I ask that you find a reputable charity (preferably one that accepts bitcoin) and donate to them instead.
This is for Jamie G Diamond? The CEO of JP Morgan & Chase Co. is named Jamie Diamond (no middle initial). What are you getting at?
> Most people bought > 10 k anyway

Yes, cash based ETF's buy the underlying asset, in this case BTC.

The most recent filing by CBOE to the SEC from June 26th 2018 is for a cash based ETF, buying the underlying asset, BTC.

"According to the SEC [application](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/cboebzx/2018/34-83520.pdf), the Bitcoin ETF will be physically backed by secure holdings of bitcoin in the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust. To maintain liquidity and sufficient reserves, the Trust will trade bitcoin on over-the-counter (OTC) exchanges both domestically and internationally."

Have a nice day!
no kidding, there's a fix supply? lol. read the white paper? spare me. so, you want the federal government to approve something that may/may not boost the value of BTC. so a government bailout.
You cant reason with anyone that sees only the bubble and not the long term. Almost every mainstream innovative technology we use today began with bubbles. You will hear this from many nay sayers until crytpo is a mainstream alternative currency and value store. But by that time the ETFs will have already been readily available, legitifying crypto and providing a point of entry for many who are currently worried about their lack of technical comfort and the safety of storing crypto. 
I am very confident in the benefit that ETFs and the spin off crytpo investment vehicles will bring to the space. You really need to think long term though, WAY past the bubbles.
People pumping money into a speculative etf isn't growth.  It's simply money changing place from one hand to another. Some will make out rich. Some will end up "hodling" a bag full of poo.  Zero net gain. 

There are plenty here that are already in that position going on and on about how it's about to come back. 
Leader?  Someone should tell the Chinese to stop 90% of the BTC traded each day and stop mining 75% of it.
Sure hope so. Need more BTC.
If you can work out a private key from a public one, let me know. Fool
He's making money off of bitcoins decline. We don't need that kind of talk here. 
My time of course, because I'm the center of the universe.
That's ok, my insults are also for entertainment purposes only.
and I'm not entertained!  I'm poor now.
$6382? going the wrong way buddy.
the f'in rally of the year right here!!!! good call bieberbro
Zzzzz
Is your question mark billable too?
On point!
What if they bought at $2? So its not when you bought its when you sell.
Good.
Zero market manipulation?

Lol ...
I mean it's still only ~3600 btc out of 21m btc, so really it should have dropped....$1.14. But it dropped $300.
How much do you think bitcoin will be worth in usd in 3 years？
Too late for that, tether would have to print a shitload to get it even near that price ever again
wait, now there's a crypto deep state that's controlling things, and you still want to be part of getting your money stolen by them, on the off chance that, "moon"? lol. you guys get more desperate by the day, holy shit.
Ok MrManHimself.

Many people* happy? Point still stands 
The government shouldn't have the ability to deny this. The people want it to happen. It's not a bail out. Please read the white paper before you make these arguments. 
Long term?  You don't even understand the basics of what is happening today.
I think with an bitcoin ETF we could easily see another 1-2&#37; added to the GDP.
Why would the government want Crypto to succeed as a Store of Value? Serious question.

Houses as a store of value provide great benefit - people can live in them.
More houses, cheaper rent.

Stocks as a store of value allow companies to invest that money in growth - more jobs. It is a win.

Why is crypto a good store of value?
Exactly why we need this ETF
Sorry for pointing out you were using incorrect terminology? 
I'm sure if you could you would... enough hating people and their market tactics...Most everyone is in BTC for fast easy money you actually think people are using it for the reasons it was intended? Yes you seen me type it correct ALMOST everoyne that has bitcoin is trying to Bank off of it..! Most that are bitter bought bitcoin after the 5k mark.. anyone beforehand is still good..
SFYL
Are you suggesting I'm a bitcoin shill? I'm just in it for the technology.
If you bought at $2, hold all the way up to $20k and sell at $2k you're a fucking retard.

That being said, if you bought at *any* price and have been holding through and since the all time high you're probably not very bright
Interesting. My interpretation of the yearly chart says otherwise. 
Market manipulation happened in November and December when the price rose to 19k and normies got on board. Now those who are left are just bag holding and we're seeing the occasional big dump every time a wave of people realise and sell their bags
2021 eh? Should be into our next post halving bull run by then. Hmmm.... let's just say Winter 2019 we start getting cooking and break the volume profile resistance at 8100. 2 years after? Over 20k for sure. Ive been sayin for a while 2022 will be year of the moon.
Hmmm.  Having been involved with BTC since 2013 I heard it was never going to get "near that price ever again" in regards to $1000.  Patience/hodling is a virtue.
Trying to control vs Taking control ...  big difference. Don't forget to zoom out guys #mtgox 2013 ... 
Who the hell are you talking about? Where I mentioned in my comment "moon" bullshit? Read it again or reply to the right comment if this was an error. The stupidity on here never ceases to amaze me.
Or is it u/DrRealityAgain ?  Or both....
I was trying to find that dude you are referring to. Wearing gold shirt and saying I am in it for the technology. 
Did you just edit his wikipedia page before linking that? LOL, clever.
Again, I am not taking about the ETF, or ETN, or similar, I am taking about the confidence it would generate and the spinoff effect it would have on global perception. Fawk , it's amazing how many people bring their stock market perceptions to the crypto space and forget what crypto is. So many people looking to trade it and invest in it, and completely dismiss why Bitcoin exists. It needs to gain legitimacy and solidify its place as an alternative currency. Being taken more seriously is going to require serious players to get involved as part of the adoption cycle. This is more than something to trade and gamble on and to imagine how this space is going to look in 10 years from now, you have to broaden your perspective way past the stock market mentality.
Read up on some of projects underway to improve transaction rates, peer to peer trading, real estate purchasing, etc. It's not just another stock like entity. It's a game changer that will take years to mature.
If you're trading it and shorting it and what not, that's the only world where you see crypto and that's the only way you'll perceive it.
It is NOT.

Value is ultimately decided by the accepting party.  Right now, the only place where BTC has any value is on the exchanges and a negligible number of merchants.  Outside of this group, the value of BTC is $0.

Why does this matter?  Because regardless of the decentralised architecture of BTC, the exchanges today are mostly centralised.  If there are no exchanges (regulatory, hacks resulting in insolvency, etc), value of BTC will become $0.
Wrong.  This is precisely the reason why SEC did not approve the ETF the last 2 attempts.

And their decision is correct.  You cannot build an ETF based on an underlying asset where trading is beyond SEC's regulatory oversight and prices are believed to be manipulated.
I don't care about price. I'm in it for the technology.
A paid shill for the antiquated technology used and abused by the traditional banking/finance elite?  That would be believable. 


How well does Jamie Diamond pay?
Still made a profit. 
Then you can’t read charts. A year ago we were below $3000. Now it’s at $6300. This is a bad thing to you? 
A lot of people who are still in profit will deny to themselves that the price is dropping just because its currently above their buy price. or because "its higher than it was this time last year"

The price could drop to $10 and I wouldn't be surprised if they were still saying "Well it was $1 10 years ago!"
We get it, you have short position open.  Now fuck off.
Cool.  So you are still bullish with a long term time horizon.    My belief is that we will be at 100k by early 2021 due to the halvening and finally some institutional investment by then. 
yes because in 2013 there was a massive amount of exposure for bitcoin, ad the world market was focused in on it. I'm sure the several thousand people back then were playing in the EXACT SAME MARKET as you are now.
I’d sell my truck if BTC hit $1000 again.
Could that be too
Haha, yep. Here ya go: https://i.imgur.com/lEcBOAf.jpg
AH HA HA HA HA
then you are one of the few....!
Are you calling bitcoin antiquated?
Jamie Diamond (and the other banksters at JP Morgan & Chase Company) are very anti-bitcoin. If anything, they would pay me to NOT post this material.
Price went to 19k and has been dropping ever since. it doesn't matter what the price was this time last year. 

Dispite what people in this sub say: history rarely repeats and history rarely rhymes.

Past performance doesn't indicate anything about the future - all that matters is what's happening now. The price is currently going down and hasn't shown a single sign of stopping

When we hit 19k, Coinmarketcap was the most view financial website on the internet, coinbase was the most downloaded app on the app store and trade volumes were at 80 billion. We're struggling to maintain even 10% of any of that now. The only 'good news' we've been getting is from biased crypto news sites like bitcoinist and ccn
What's that little thing in the middle?
Oh ya. I bank with btc. How else is a nerd gonna store his capital?
Yup. Thanks
I know you are trolling, but on the off chance you are not... 

you are one seriously stupid person.
He’s a troll. Ignore 
JPMorgan Chase and Co.

not JP Morgan & Chase Company
Not quite. The good news has been coming from a wide variety of sources including a lot of bright and innovative thinkers. The problem here is that there seems to be a lack of understanding regarding the time frame. Technology like this will be adopted slowly over time and regulatory clarity is needed before more big enters the space. Most of the good news that's legit indicates a longer time span!
Bubble.

Bubble has intrinsic properties - it gets blown up and it either deflates slowly or burst.
Same as the other little thing that happened back in 2014 when price fell from $1000 to $200. 

Expand your viewpoint. 
I don't care what they call their evil bankster organization. You know who I mean.
That was four years ago. This is now. Btc is currently getting hammered with no end or recovery in sight. 
A lot of people don't even care, there is bunch of us that will always buy btc simply due to it's decentralization, be it 1$ or 100k$ as long as you stay in the market long enough and average out your investments you should be fine at the end.
That's what people said four years ago too. 
Ah, so gambling on the it happened before so it has to happen again theory. 
It’s a theory that’s much more logical than “it’s going to $0.
I don't think zero will happen, but $2,500 by eoy seems reasonable.
