Daily Discussion, June 25, 2018 -- TITLE
What is driving the price down atm? Bought at 12k, then dropped, bought at 9k, then dropped, bought at 7.6k, dropped again...I think I bought the dip, but it just goes lower, put in $6500, portfolio is currently worth $1500. FML
This has become so predictable and frustrating.   Yet, I don‚Äôt sell before the Simpson movie starts again. 
Who ever is fighting the good fight, thank you. =)
Imagine people who bought around 18K-10-8K. People are taking huge losses and walking away. Not selling. 
Botwars!
There seems be some congestion on the network today, a lot of unconfirmed low fee transactions. 
GDAX (AKA Coinbase Pro) needs to up their minimum trade size. This spam is ridiculous.
I'm planning on setting up a 24/7 Lightning Node. How many btc do you think I should throw in to make it useful and  maybe make a profit ?
This looks real nice. All in.
Since bitcoin green is my favorite colour 
For people who were here for the other bear markets‚Ä¶ Does this feel worse or better this time? Are you less/ more / equally worried?
the 1h chart could give us the most beautiful bart ever seen. 
Some developer's new bot going crazy on GDAX? Hundreds, if not thousands of 0.001 BTC buy and sell transactions occurring. 
Hahaha.  BTC has your attention. 
This Alaska-based small business that I have been working at in payroll for a couple of weeks should be the poster child for Bitcoin. I actually can't pay most of the employees in checks because they are constantly traveling because it's a shipping business. Those employees that I can pay with checks are often in remote areas in Alaska where it can take a week for the mail to arrive. Also, if you think that direct deposit is the obvious solution then you're right, but only for the normal payroll. If for some reason we need to pay an employee outside the normal payroll, then we have to manually push it through the bank using a template so that it can go through the clearing house process. To put it into perspective how bad this process is, after I entered an ACH payment in on Thursday it did not process the direct deposit until Monday morning because I missed the 5pm deadline.

I see we are back to not holding positions longer than 10 minutes. Proud of all of you. 
I'm still scared I won't be able to buy enough before it starts the next run. Since the bubble popped, I've been dollar cost averaging in a little everyday. If it goes any lower, I'll probably increase my buy rate. I've said since it started crashing that I hope it gets back down to $1000 (around when I started buying) so I could "buy a couple." I'm anxious about how little I have right now.

Reading comments on here makes it seem like a bunch of people think it's going there and it would be stupid to buy even then because it's just going to go lower.

It's just a few thousand dollars. Either way it will give me a story to tell my grandkids.
looks like $6k was the bottom
Heads it goes up.  Tails it goes down.  What's the call?
How do I daily life?
If one person or group controls 51% of the hashrate, even if they don't do a 51% attack, are there other ways they could use that situation to enrich themselves or give themselves an advantage over other people?
whats goin on on GDAX? 6283,78/6283,79  buying/selling nonstop

edit: nvm asked before
WTF THAT 0.001 BTC trade size on gdax \^\^ ?? :D

So glad I didn‚Äôt sell, back up we go! Being patient will pay off :)
Bulls are back boiz
i think it is a good thing and still healthy to dip 1 more time. around 6k is not the bottom, price breaking up confirmed by volume it‚Äôs surely caused by the bots and fomo-ers.
i always think (maybe) 4.5k - 5.3k is the bottom by seeing the weekly chart.  

also this july , the price low should be 3x better then last year‚Äôs july. 
since 2013 it has been doing like so.
july 2017 low was around 1.5k usd . so this july low might be around 4.5k??? 
fyi after july the price always got back up by the bulls. 

cmiiw. im checking it by the reference of the previous years chart
lemme see what u guys think!
cheers BTC ridersüçª
Even during the 17' Bull market, Bitcoin was down like 80-90% of the year, It obviously grows in short massive rallies so don't worry we still have 6 months to go in the year to reach 100k

Smart money leaving the stock market and entering crypto today? The stock market is a bloodbath today.
Hi i am looking for some insight from any TA experts here. 

As I [conjectured](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8tp0mc/comment/e19w6bl?st=JIULDH4N&sh=c25f02ef), I‚Äôm wondering if our recent drop made a double bottom as compared to February‚Äôs low. 

What is the key resistance level we‚Äôd have to surpass to validate a double bottom reversal?

If this plays out it would be extremely bullish. 
Any news from Confucius Bot before we moon?
What is Tether exactly? 
Lookin' good.

And the other serious & honest coins doing comparatively well too.

Shitcoins being shaken out.

Good for Bitcoin :)

This is what I've been waiting for.

Am Zippin' up my space suit and refuelling my moon Lambo right now.
The bulls are back in town
Big money wants in. The articles are all over the internet. Andreessen opens new crypto venture fund, etc... But, Wall street will not come in until the price is right. I feel they will orchestrate a huge final drop and it will happen during July. They can't wait to get in, but as usual, the fix must be in to make money for "them". I expect a big second leg washout is on the horizon. My background is as a financial advisor and mortgage banker for 20 years. I know how they work. I left the industry to do social service work because it was so corrupt. That's why I expect this to get even more ugly in the next 30 days. I am sorry, but I really feel convinced this is what we will see.
Mining hashrate is still god damn high, we just reached new ATH... mining competition is really hard nowadays ! I think no miners should sell at those low prices because of this !

What's with bit-z ETH/BTC volume today? 
The chart flag is wedging downward on increasing volume.  Should be the other way around.  I think it's still too early to count the chickens here.
100M tether are beeing sent to bitfinex right now
Wow, there's a big difference in the USD and EUR GDAX charts, and GBP. I always thought they all near enough mimicked each other. 
Hey guys. 

Can anyone suggest a website where I can sell my 1 BTC?

My account is currently restricted from Coinbase and that'll probably take a while to fix. Anyone know any other exchanges that would accept a resident from Florida?

MASSIVE BULL RUN COMING!!!
The recovery support is looking real nice right now, wow.
When I first found out about Brock Pierce's involvement in Bitcoin I was taken aback as I had just seen the doc "conspiracy of silence". I didn't realize he was the lead on Tether, wow.
Does anyone care that bitmain's two pools now very nearly make up 51% of the hashrate?

Do we still believe Bitcoin is decentralized?

(Edit: autocorrect)
Again, the crypto market (Not only BTC) is saying: This is not the end!! The technology and the concept is here to stay regardless of all the FUD. 

Every time you think this FUD is new, take a look at this:

‚ÄúAlmost all of the many predictions now being made about 1996 hinge on the Internet‚Äôs continuing exponential growth. But I predict the Internet will soon go spectacularly supernova and in 1996 catastrophically collapse.‚Äù

Robert Metcalfe, founder of 3Com, 1995
Anyone invested in CC will most likely lose everything. The main thing is if you invest you are encouraging the developers to actively try to build better projects. Noone invests and the incentive to create is gone.

The currency of the future though won't be held in part by 99&#37; of investors who are hoping to hold every bitcoin before the public catches on, no. It just won't happen. Bitcoin started out as just a fun scarce currency swap(mostly for underground stuff), people didn't buy it to invest. That was only after it bulled a couple of times. This crash is much different now then the other 2 or 3 crashes in that people just want money.
[deleted]
Bear markets end when the last true believer quits.  Give it a few years.
The greatest buying binge almost always happens at the top ‚Äì peak price and peak demand. The smart money exits as the dumbass money flows in. Values may fall sharply, at which point promoters scream ‚Äòbuying opportunity‚Äô But, it's a trap.



The whales thank you for your contribution. 
Low volume and whale shenanigans. 

Your buying timing pretty much mirrors mine. 

Maybe we get lucky and this is the end of the bear.  It‚Äôs rising today 
How? If you put it all in at 12k it should be 3000ish now
A lot of people in the general public bought in around December hoping to double their investment. Price rose until everyone who was interested was in. Then it peaked and people started leaving as they grew concerned they would lose their money. That massive pool of buyers (including my little sister, a total technophobe) are still leaving. There's a lot of room for the price to deflate.

Bitcoin can't moon unless new blood becomes interested. Unfortunately part of the reason it mooned last year was the narrative that Bitcoin has only ever gone up making it a sure bet. I think this new track record of major prolonged devaluation is going to slow things up a bit. People are afraid to get burned.
F
Probably that it had an improbable irrationally exuberant run to 19 and should be at about 1,500 to 2,000 max right now.  

And that's where I predict it will settle to sometime in the next year.  2,000ish (+-500).  


I would say the only way you get back positive is keep buying. But do a dollar cost average over a decent amount of time. 
Prices for Simpsons collectibles were mooning when the movie came out. I really hope that there will be a second one.
‚ÄúYes!, Fight and you may die. Run and you will live at least awhile. And dying in your bed many years from now, would you be willing to trade all the days from this day to that for one chance, just one chance, to come back here as young men and tell our enemies that they may take our lives but they will never take our freedom!!!‚Äù

- William Wallace 
Also, full disclosure, I panic sold the 2008 stock market crash and still regret it to this day. 

I realize it‚Äôs a different market, but I believe in bitcoin more than I did the stocks I held back then, so there is no way in hell I‚Äôd ever panic sell my bitcoin.  I learned my lesson the hard way. 
I feel badly for anyone who panic sells, when if they just held the market would likely go up again like it always has in the past. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so important that these people have a long term investment horizon and understand the history of bitcoin, its current fundamentals, and where it‚Äôs likely headed in the future.  These irrational losses can be avoided. 
Huge if true. 
Maybe an attack by the Ver crowd.  They are shit-scared by Lightning.
Was just going to post the same thing, it's obviously trying to stop any other sensible orders going through.  Has happened previously as well.
42.
I am extremely worried. Bitcoin has fallen before but those times were different.

Those times I had money to buy more.
To me it feels pretty similar to 2014, but accelerated by 2x or 3x. I'm considerably less worried this time around because Bitcoin has survived some pretty serious threats since then and came out stronger. 
Or you could simply just watch the first few dumps following a linear pattern and rally. No charts necessary 
yeah seeing this too. I wonder if a large whale is running something to disguise larger orders they might be putting in or someone trying to create the impression of a large amount of volume. 
It's happened before, seems rather dubious to me.  Coinbase should stop that account.
This is great - real world problems that can be solved with Bitcoin. I love it! :)

*Edit:* With Lightning it would even be possible to pay employees as often and as fast as anyone would want to.
Not like you can plan ahead to pay your employees monthly and do a correction of a previous month the next month.
It's easy to make sense of things retrospectively, and you can spot any pattern you like if you look hard enough, like people who see Jesus in a slice of toast.
10 min is a lifetime to the millennials 
This is the attitude. Buy regularly with money you can laugh at yourself for lighting on fire later. 
No way!

it's still 6.1k tho instead of 8k-20k
Where do the bulls go when they are not ‚Äúback‚Äù?
It hasn‚Äôt even cleared 6500 for a whole 24 hours, but the bulls are back?
Yeah, but it didn't increase to 19000 and then fall by 70&#37; before that. The current market is what is known as a "Burst Bubble" market, i.e., it will wobble downhill for a long, long time.
What?  Bitcoin hit a new ATH in April or May 2017 and was up every month since then, maybe not July.
Very optimistic lol
I'm still calling 120k blow off top this year...
i dunno really...ETFs might be toxic for bitcoin. Remember last year when everyone was yelling that futures was going to make bitcoin sore to 100k+? What sounds like a good idea isn't always a good idea
that 2-5% drop is a bloodbath in the stock market.

Tether (USDT) is a cryptocurrency with a value meant to mirror the value of the U.S. dollar. The idea was to create a stable cryptocurrency that can be used like digital dollars. Coins that serve this purpose of being a stable dollar substitute are called ‚Äústable coins.‚Äù Tether is the most popular stable coin and even acts as a dollar replacement on many popular exchanges. -> https://cryptocurrencyfacts.com/what-is-tether/

Spent all money on BTC, no moon gas for me.
imho shitcoins are issues right now. the sooner the market can shake them out, the sooner we are back to super bull run.
So what are the other honest coins?
And currently being served rare to medium-rare at the local steakhouses.
There will be another horrendous drop soon.
Who knows, maybe this is the right price for Wall street.
if i were knew to this space i would put 50% of my funds down right now and the next 50% once the market decides its direction
A lot of miners have ridiculously low operating costs. and yes some will not make a profit anymore already now
Don't make yourself look stupid bruv.
Source?
Kraken?
Gemini.. low fees
Nice try U.S. govt. 
craigslist or even ebay
give it some time.
No doubt, but will it go over the cliff again like it did after it briefly got to 8200?
More likely to continue sideways movement 
Don't you understand that Bitmain would not fuck up its own investment by going over 51 percent and thereby likely impacting bitcoin's price negatively? It's in its interest for the price to be as high as possible.

>Almost all of the many predictions now being made about 1996

"In addition to being a legendary tech visionary and the man widely credited with having invented Ethernet, Bob Metcalfe was also a columnist for PC World sister publication InfoWorld. And it was in that column that Metcalfe made what must have been the most regrettable comment of his career; indeed, he even promised to eat his words if his augury turned out to be wrong.

To his credit, Metcalfe made good on that promise in 1999 during his keynote speech at the International World Wide Web Conference, where he blended up a copy of his printed column with some liquid and drank it down before a crowd of onlookers."

If I get to see McAfee blend his dick with some liquid, I'll be OK with BTC not reaching $1M!

Do you think that hourly employees would actually be content with being paid the next month? What world do you live in? People are screaming in your face and calling your manager to tell him how incompetent you are after 5 days if the system messes up and you can't pay them. In addition, if you are doing your payroll monthly and something goes wrong then you are not only breaking a contractual obligation to pay your employees, but you are also going to get huge fines from the state if they catch wind.
You best not be dissin' my Jesus Toast bro.
This quote is gold! xD
February didn't dip below 6000 on coinmarketcap. We hit 5800 recently.

Most likely a "cabinet trade" as they are sometimes called a/k/a "accommodation trade" -- used by a financial firm to clear out a position, of if a lot of them, a lot of positions.

Bitmain is a supporter of Bitcoin Cash. I trully believe that they could use all of the miners they have sold to the world, and remote trigger them to create a 51% attack.
Dont you understand that Bitmain suppots Vers Bcash? So a 51% attack is not that unlikly .
In 2001, Bob Metcalfe also said the much hyped IT/Ginger invention would be more important than the internet but not quite as impressive as cold fusion had it worked out.  The invention turned out to be the Segway scooter. What a letdown. The guy has been wrong a lot.

**Loss aversion**

In cognitive psychology and decision theory, loss aversion refers to people's tendency to prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains: it is better to not lose $5 than to find $5. The principle is very prominent in the domain of economics. What distinguishes loss aversion from risk aversion is that the utility of a monetary payoff depends on what was previously experienced or was expected to happen. Some studies have suggested that losses are twice as powerful, psychologically, as gains.

~~years~~ - weeks or months.
I mean that percentage-wise it seems to have dropped the same amount (~75%) in less time. I haven't overlaid any charts for comparison though... just a hunch.
Yeah but it's spamming the order book with thousands of transactions, taking the piss imo.
I never said you have to skip a salary, you can pay plan ahead as if the month was a normal month and pay the employee each month, and correct any discrepancy (sick leave, ...) on the next month.

Not working in HR though but that's how it work with my salary ... In the past I even an annual correction for the overtime if I was building up an amount of hours that I reasonable couln't conpensate, my balance of overtime would get an haircut and would be paid out in money (cash on the next salary) instead of time (compensation).

People screaming in face of other people is cause for immediate termination in my country/company.
I think it dipped to 5.9 ish on gdax back in February so it‚Äôs pretty close to the recent drop

‚ÄúWhile exact troughs are preferable, there is some room to maneuver and usually, a trough within 3% of the previous is considered valid.‚Äù


‚ÄúAlthough there can be variations, the classic Double Bottom Reversal usually marks an intermediate or long-term change in trend. ‚Äú

http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:chart_patterns:double_bottom_reversal

I think we meet or are close to meeting the 3% variation threshold described for the double bottom to be valid.  If this holds and we can break the key resistance, it could be very bullish. 
That would be nice. What about the resistance at 6.8k?
It's buying/selling around 6,3usd worth of btc, with 0.25% fee, thats 0.001575 usd per trade. It's doing around 15 trades per second by the looks of it ? Should be around 0.20 to 0.25 cents lost per second. Around 14 usd per minute and 850 per hour.

Are you 100&#37; BTC?
Is the consensus not to use coinmarketcap for price referencing? Fluctuations are more volatile on individual exchanges. 
It's a 3.67% loss from 6048 in february to 5826 just recently in june on coinmarketcap. Things are still looking promising, I'm just not completely sold on a reversal yet. 
Needs to claw somewhere back in that neighborhood at least once to make it good for shorting again. Still too low to risk shorting much now so soon after a drop.
But the price goes up ;) Think of profits somone else doing too ;) Its not one man show ;) Dont worry its not a bug, someone good know what doin here!
I was hoping something else.. Can anyone be that stupid?
I hear ya maybe just hold it someday it might pay off I suppose

this is exactly what I've been thinking.  even .5% of 401k's would be huge
Many can, how many do?  I'm not saying gold is the best idea for an IRA.
Fat?  :)
Any suggestions on where to find more info?
Dat The Network quote init?

Huge indeed.  And the big players are working to make this a reality.  So coming soon...

The next bull run could be bigger than all the others combined. 
If we get to moon I will actually have time to exercise regularly, so probably not. 
Yup. Good eye. 
We like it when you're angry - do it again :)
I‚Äôd allocate 5% of my registered account to a Bitcoin ETF without blinking. Suspect that I‚Äôm not alone.. and that would move the needle substantially.
funny how the ppl who are bitcoin skeptics, or super bearish and thinks its ponzi etc., don't realize that of course Wall Street wants to create a new asset class regardless of whether or not they like it.  Its not so much about the price, more about the products they can sell the public.  
Lets not get the poor guy banned. We like him 
I was joking - come back BCA :)
