Daily Discussion, June 18, 2018 -- TITLE
I honestly don't see how it could bottom out much further. If everyone who has the opinion of it going lower has sold off then who else is there to sell down the price? Some whales could come buy I guess but if they are still holding then wouldn't they want the price to go up? We hit the end of a quarter and the end of a futures contract expiration. Now I feel there is only room to go up. Plus if people are manuplicting the market they would use the low volume of buyers to quickly drive up the price no? 


This is all specualtion. But that is how I am feeling and why. 

Edit: Spelling
I shot my dog!  It worked!
I still don't understand the phenomenon by which all cryptos trend up/down together. 
and of course this helps price:

6400 strong support, get ready to skyrocket 7,5k pump
So if I use square for my business in California, can I accept Bitcoin with it now?
You guys get so excited from the tiniest pumps it's cringe worthy.  Chill out fellas...

The sharp rise is a result of square's new licence. Adoption is everything!

I’ve sold my first born child!
I think that if you have $10m cash in your pocket you can easily manipulate whole market, even bitcoin. [https://twitter.com/BitmexRekt/status/1008748722593914880](https://twitter.com/BitmexRekt/status/1008748722593914880)

It pumped all coins after this move. Is it that easy??
eventually whats going to happen is a mass adoption sort of thing. 98% of the rest of the world who isnt in crypto or holding any coins will be jumping over eachother when they hear the rumors of massive gains. It'll be crazy youll want to be in the markets and have your ducks in a row thats for sure. I believe we will all become millionaires fairly quickly within a few months when mass adoption happens. Timing is the key I believe it will just be astonishing when that happens. People will be tripping over eachother running to the bank with their checks to buy cryptos through fiat. By that time, we could expect popular wallets in beta at the moment such as pillar ethos and such to be fully open making it easier. I believe that will be what sparks the mass adoption phase is when cryptos get alot easier to use and purchase. When people flood in your average joe and jane things will go up ten times like last yearand I believe it when they say the next run will dwarf 2017 because the institutional money will be in and joe and jane from down the street whove never heard of crypto in their life will follow. well wake up things will be up 50-60% in a day and sh*t day in day out maybe take a dip like 10-15% then blast up another 20-30 and so on and so on. But not everybody’s gonna make it big those of us already in the world will push us to the top while their scrambling to purchase high still thinking they got a good deal I can tell you ladies and gents it’ll be a fun time to be alive. I believe the mass adoption phase will last for a few years in which its up to each person how long to hodl. I believe were about 5 years out from the "flood gates opening" do I need to say it again?? HODL HODL HOOOOODL
Anyone still buying?
I'm concidering buying some more, but maybe this isn't the bottom. Maybe I'll wait and see if it drops to 5,5K

Nice follow up!
Whalers are fighting for market control!!!
Hmm.  Did someone notice the Lightning Network ..
Somebody just found some ammunition.
Do you guys think the current FIFA world cup or upcoming 2020 Tokyo Olympics would have any impact on Bitcoin's adoption and price?
Every single major coin pumped 5% simultaneously, even dogecoin. Do you guys think this is behavior of a legit market? Or do you think fake tether money was injected into the system? 
Sorry if the question is stupid: what's the difference between cryptocurrency and token?

Bitcoin could break the internet, servers and even our smartphones ! Sell all your btcs or we're doomed !!!

9 years in existence but no adoption. Baghodlers think The Establishment is out to get their coins, so there is no circulation. No one trades it.

Cool fake pump for the future dump as I'm taking a dump
Pump it up like plastic tits!

Everyone should be celebrating crypto like John.
bulls are back boiz
Ok.  We moon 
Just sold waiting for the dump 
A 250 point spike-up... Now, just churning, again, on low-volume, as the flag extends sideways towards another collapse?  Volume like this sure doesn't make me feel optimistic.  Looks like it's gonna be a slow death...
Going to 3k. Buy LATER guys. Prepare your cash
I heard that Root Stock was getting a lot of attention at Consensus. Is this project generally well regarded on this sub-reddit? And is it expected that it will increase the value of BitCoin?
Wow we might hit 7k
I should have bought the dip :-( please come down again

How do we make Bitcoin scalable?? Like could we possibly use bitcoin/cryptos in every transaction with the amount of computing power we have? Or will cryptos be stuck to larger scale money transfers?
So, what I'm worried about right now is scalability. The Blockchain network seems to be growing really fast and soon, that 200 GB Blockchain might grow exponentially if the usage extends, and adoption occurs, as we are hoping. So, the difficult scalability might be an issue in a not so far future.... Which are the counter measures or what's the way bitcoin is going to overcome this? Serious question, I'm kinda new in all this

yeah i think we're starting to get near raw cost to mine a bitcoin at this price
Who else? Everyone that hasn't sold yet. It's done by scaring the leftovers to the point that they can't handle the stress and pain much more. 
Miners will sell. That's around 15 millions of sell pressure everyday, and with such low liquidity in every exchange, it has a bigger effect than before. 
By looking at the daily volume, it is possible to see that Bitcoin volume is currently at its lowest of the year.

By taking the price up, whalers could create a situation where their bot trading is paying higher fees just to paint-the-tape. They would be leaking money while placing themselves in zero income situation. 

Artificially rising the prices could bring some FOMO into the situation yes, that has been done at least three times since January. The trick does not work forever, because buyers will simply wait for the next dip to buy in.

in my opinion, whalers now have control of a very large amount of bitcoins and are simply trying to establish a monopolized price for the Bitcoin and the Crypto space in general.
You sir clearly don’t understand how a market and it’s pricing works. There is no such thing as minimum price because the market can work like a balloon with a hole in it. You can keep pumping some air into it but all you need is a tiny hole to keep it deflating. If whales own just 10% of BTC, they can continue to deflate it through buy sell walls. So, by owning even 1.7 million BTC, they can deflate the market cap down to $0.  Of course, it will never go to $0 but it is very mathematically possible.
No, this is all because I finally watched the video of the dude chopping off his left testicle because he was wrong about the BTC price.
I guess the basics of it is that all Alt coins are valued in Bitcoin, not in any country currency. So, if the value of Bitcoin changes in terms of what it's worth in say USD for example, then the value of alt coins change relative to the move. They don't change much in terms of how much Bitcoin it costs to purchase them, unless they have something going on in terms of the alt coin's success, adoption, partnership etc.
People still think they can profit from shitcoins.  Maybe they can in the very short term if they are very sneaky..
It’s not a phenomenon. Whales own over 50% of the whole cryptocurrency market, that includes altcoins. When they pump and dump Bitcoin, they pump and dump everything. This is like you planning to leave the country so you empty all your bank accounts the same day. A misconceived banker can call that a phenomenon; a rational person can call it an explanation.
Because none of them are tracking anything indicative of real value.  So there is little reason for them to vary independently. 
true if huge
Huge boost is stretching it a bit, welcome boost but certainly not huge.
You were almost spot on :)  New Nostradamus?

Well I guess if anyone here likes cool crystal specimens, you know who takes Bitcoin ;p
Shh Dad, we're having fun.  Go back to your shed.
5% in a few minutes. Doesn't look tiny to me.
Moon?
Hey now, close to a 5&#37; price swing in under an hour is a means for a little excitement.. 
The big pump of Dec 2017 was comprised of a series of little pumps. One never knows when it may happen again. It's better than being bored :)
What makes you think it will take five years? 
I think it will only take 3 years to get to 100k. The halvening is in 2020.  That should accelerate the price upwards. 
It will be $5 billion per BTC by tomorrow. Mark my words. It will be a 770,000% increase over night. Everyone will be a millionaire overnight.... sigh. If you can’t wait 5 lowly years for BTC to hit $100K, you don’t ever deserve BTC to hit $100k.
Sounds too good to be true but truth is stranger than fiction! 
I’m always buying whenever possible. Ya never know when this thing could abruptly turn around.  
Every good dip I take another bite!! %)
id bought at 6500 and when it went to 6700 so now sitting out.  but id say everybody is scared to buy right now, which is usually the best time to buy.  And in response to to the person below saying its going to 1k...no way.  maybe we get into the 5's, but no lower - IMO
I was going to put in another $100 or so once I got my paycheck, hoping the price doesn’t skyrocket in the next few days
I stop buying when the price goes over $1k. It's been almost 15 months since the last dip to $950, but we should hopefully see another buying opportunity in the next year or so. if you still haven't managed to dump all of your bitcoin from the 2017 bubble, you should just get it over with now while you can still make some profit.

I really wish this were true. At one time I honestly thought we would never see prices under $10k, yet here we are. I'm HODLing long term, so I've got my fingers crossed.
With the lightning network, the time is ripe for a "killer app" that will introduce bitcoin to the masses.  Skepticism makes bitcoin stronger, but there is a fine line between skepticism and stupidity.  Right now, it's about building the infrastructure.  

While we may see it pull back farther, enough people are trading it to keep the price over $6000 right now; to say nobody is trading it is stupid.  
 >  Thinks it only takes few years for the adoption of a new currency
NINE YEARS! So what? It takes a long time for adoption to take place.
You think that when banks were created, everybody ran to give their money to them ?

No, and it will take time before everybody takes control of their wealth again.

Be patient. Revolution is on it's way.

Banks were not created as we know them as today. Bitcoin neither and it will continue to evolve and attract more and more people.
Added to my short position, I hope it will not hit my stop loss before going down.


Hahahahaha someone got a pin? 
Agreed. It’s most likely the best thing
to happen to advance the freedom of mankind since the internet. 
how original.
The dump happened from $20k to $6k . Where have you been?
Good move.
Calm your tits.
Why 3 and not 2 or 0.5 or whatever
To the floor! Boizs
The average cost for mining 1 Bitcoin is somewhere around 4.5k. There's no way it'll go down this low.

Mass adoption, which is very hard right now because of transaction times and fees. Don't worry, lightning is comming to save the day, but it needs time to develop
Amazon accepting Bitcoin as a payment would be a great start.
There are a couple of debit cards that can be funded with Bitcoin or Litecoin. They then do the conversation to local currency when you make a purchase.

That's a halfway solution but might be the most practical one right now, until merchants upgrade their point of sale systems to take crypto directly. But it would allow you to store value in crypto and still spend local currency.
Unless you have CPUs from the last year or two (7/8th gen intel, or AMD Ryzen)... none. The electricity costs generally far outweigh the amount of money you'll make.
Electroneum? That’s not a recommendation. CPU mining sucks. But I am mining it on like three of my shitty old Androids. Supposedly I’ll make 25 bucks if I wait a year. 
X2: The Threat was a good game. X3: Reunion didn't live up to the hype imo.
There are several solutions in place for massive everyday usage. Lightning Network is the best so far, but still in active development. 

There are many posts in this sub explaining how lightning network work and such. 
The solutions aren't there. LN is not scalable and has a number of fundamental problems. 

Bitcoin is designed to be tamper-proof and since updating the system is a form of 'tampering', it is unlikely we'll see a meaningful scaling solution with Bitcoin. Maybe a new coin. 
Lightning Network. 
Read up on the lightning network. It is basically a second layer that reduces the load on the Blockchain because instead of writing every transaction to it only balance changes are stored at much larger intervals (I know I am oversimplifying)
I hope you’d agree that there’s really no point to recording every single tiny transaction onto the blockchain every time I buy a coffee. The lightning network agrees but says that there still cannot be trust between the parties. So I need a way to be able to send money trustlessly —like the normal blockchain— but do it in a manner that doesn’t fill up the blockchain. Lightning adresses this by allowing people to move “spending money” much like a checking account. This is done by opening a payment channel and now only when I want to close the channel (spent all my checking account or want to withdraw it), only then do I have to include a transaction on the block.  This is lightning
By 8k you mean daily volume?

why not just hold it > get free airdrops during the year > every single thing in existance goes up when bitcoin moons > profit and sell bitcoin along with 100s of useless tokens and maybe a few $1000 in free airdrop monies > live on a mini-yacht
I couldn’t tell you what caused the initial run up to 5k but I can say fo sure I was reading articles about bitcoin in mainstream media from November onwards and that definitely contributed to the 19k meteoric rise. Doubt we will see that again 
Coin Base sold some of some that sexy  institutional product?  Warren Buffett decided he doesn't want to make another epic Amazon miss-out? :)
That it pumped and there are more coming throughout the day 
It was 100% futures that reked  Bitcoin, Just look at the timeline and you will see that day they started Bitcoin began the downward spiral and this is what also made volume and demand goway down after the crash because it caused the domino effect of panic selling in combination with the fat cats selling to short it.

Whatever you do, don’t go to Craig Wright.
Crypto is the Wild West. If you’re here asking those questions, you’re going to get scammed. Sit on your cash or buy some BTC, research until you can answer yourself confidently.
What do you mean with Tether? Volume or what am I looking at?
Can “operation rug pull” work if it just breaks 8k or do we need 8.2?
If they are waiting I have no idea what it will take for them to sell off. I guess it all depends on their entry point into the market. 
Will they just lower the hash rate? I saw someone argue that people will keep mining as they are technically long on Bitcoin so they just keep the coins but some of these  opperations have serious overhead. 
You just described me
Miner here. I absolutely do not want to sell at $6500.  At that price I'm barely breaking even with the cost of energy, housing, plus make my money back from the purchase of the mining rig.
So it looks like a stagnet BTC will naturally draw down?
This wasn't really a long term speculation more or less an observation of the current market conditions and the cycles that keep occuring, mainly the Bart's. We kinda floated on down at the end of last week so I was expecting a nice little pump in the near future as I was fairly certain that the whales we're collecting more coins. I assumed this because I just completed making an automated trader and in that process I became very familiar with the current patters of the market, not to the sense of being correct 100% of the time obvisouly. Just noticed what the calm looks like before the storm.
Ah, that might be it.  Damn, I liked Fido.

Phenomenon just means an occurrence. They can have explanations.

Nah it's everywhere, fuck the government. 
It's not ... in fact if you look back over time, you'll see that 5&#37; in less than a 30 min candle is not that common.
Are you referring to it's market cap or the price of a single coin?  
> everybody is scared to buy right now, which is usually the best time to buy

No the best time to buy is when nobody wants to buy. Being scared to buy still means people want this coin. When nobody wants it and the real blood comes - that's when you buy.
What makes you think it will go down as low as $1k again?  I'm pretty sure Bitcoin has never gone down that much from an ATH before.
The bear is strong with this one.
This is underappreciated. 
Got your's :D
In Tokyo, yes.

Bitcoin daily volume is now at the lowest of the year.
"If Bitcoin were going to be successful, it should have been successful 5 years ago.  There's no way it could be successful 5 years from now."
That's not true. I saw a post the other day on this sub that said Pokemon Go hit tens of millions of users in less than a year.
this is good for bitcoin.
This "boiz" nonsense sounds really amateurish.   Can you not do better?
Why not? 
Yes.
Nah, looks like a Bart :-( only volume on the spike and downtrend with zero/small volume anywhere else.
or will it? Up until now I'd say it will definitely come back down. But the 2018 bull run can literally start at any time and most seasoned crypto veterans have been saying all it will take is one big push to kick start it.
Perhaps. I still see the beginning if big money entering this space very soon. If you were an institutional investment handler, how much lower would you chance Bitcoin going before getting your clients in?  
It really may not get much lower. Regulatory clarity may not be worth the wait in some scenarios. 
>ight now because of transaction times and fees. Don't worry, lightning is comming to save the day, but it nee

What's hurting mass adoption of any cryptocurrency is people treating it like an investment. If you think something is going to go up in value dramatically in the future, what rationale is there to spend it?
Ok, and this lightning, is it an extension of Bitcoin or a completely different network?
Dow ~5% off ATH = verge of recession.

BTC ~70% off ATH = bullish signal.

You need to take an honest look in the mirror and decide if you're investing or gambling.  
If the general markets take a shit, and there's a global recession, bitcoin is going to track with that recession.  I really hope that doesn't happen.  I'm a buyer, I'd like to see $5k btc for a time, to do some more bargain shopping, but I don't want $5k-ish because we're going into a global recession.  If that happens, we'll see $2k or $3k, and it'll take years to see the next peak.
Bye  :)
Yes, further analysis: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8q5p68/2018_cryptocurrency_crash_elliott_wave_triangle/
So you’re comparing BTC to gold and the stock market? That sounds positive for crypto :) 
sounds good. but its quite involved. I was trying to think of a way to automate it
nice to hear. hope soon 100k😅
Buy the rumors, sell the news 
I think there is a lot of evidence for that.
Because it is going to fall again without convincing volume
Head in sand.  I can't be bothered dope head.
Well I'm hoping community members like yourself at least know if there are reputable crypto hedge funds. And if so, do they require some qualifications to get started? 
It won't be much longer if Lightning Network and Blockstream don't increase the block size like Satoshi wanted..... 
Small brain people think that bitfinex prints tether then gives out this free tether and people use it to buy bitcoin. They then think that free money handed out somehow manipulates the prices across all platforms and exchanges. Functionally retarded, I know.... But this is what bear mentality breeds. 
[deleted]
Once above 7800, the rug can be pulled any time.
I mean the difficulty adjusts often, probably another increase in difficulty soon. The podcast bitcoin and markets always goes over difficulty adjustments if you'd like to know more
If you decide to hold, make sure you can handle the stress if it does go down much lower. I lost over 90% of my money trading a particular alts this year and had to sell in the end. Not a good feeling.
But you would sell as the price goes up right? More importantly, you would sell eventually. 
Yup. If there isn't a constant demand for BTC (new money), the price goes down.

At some point it could reach an equilibrium, where offer of miners = demand, you would see a relatively stagnant price there too, but such equilibrium has to be found and I think it could take some time before we reach it.
Price of a single coin. 
couldn't you argue that right now nobody wants to buy?
There was a 93% drop in 2011, and an 87% drop from 2013 to 2015. Dipping below $1k would be a 95% drop from the ATH, which is only slightly more than previous crashes. You may be right, and we just end up with a more normal crash down to the $1500 to $2500 range.
No, it's been half as high as this.
Well, what's the point of mining if you have to sell at a loss?
It could, did they just print a bunch of new tether? 
> Perhaps. I still see the beginning if big money entering this space very soon. If you were an institutional investment handler, how much lower would you chance Bitcoin going before getting your clients in?

What makes you think big money isn't already here?
I think as it gets more and more above "peoples personal moon", things might start working better.

If you got in at $5k and it's at $50k, is that your moon? Someone else might have gotten in at $18k and would be happy with $36k


Want to access some of that sweet sweet money?  SPEND IT!

It is a layer on top, a network that uses bitcoin to settle.
Essentially its a trustless solution built on top of the bitcoin blockchain. On the lightning network everyone on it has their own blockchain(ledger of transactions) which like the main blockchain is trust-less (the reason why it is trust-less is a bit more complicated) but it hinges on the fact that the transactions can be confirmed by the main blockchain. So its a second layer that needs the bitcoin blockchain to operate properly. 
Bwahaha
I am.    I think it will moon in 14 to 24 months.   I think 6500 could be the bottom, but I wouldn't be surprised if 4500 is the bottom.     I hope the global economy remains stable for 3 more years, and does not fold, because that'll ruin the near term party.   And we need to remain patient.

IMHO there's no reputable crypto anything right now, except a cold wallet that you hold the keys on. Wait for a registered ETF traded on a major exchange.
nothing unusual xD it will go down soon or later as always ;)
Thank you. As learning this from the side lines it helps a lot with confirmation 
Good to know thank you. 
Selling the bottom usually ends in a loss. 
Glad I held, was so happy to see that epic short squeeze
You may want a plan b for your retirement if you're banking on that. 
No I think people want it they just aren't sure what this market is doing. Volume is pathetically low and buying right now is taking a bigger gamble than usual. I'm mostly in FIAT right now waiting to buy more but I think this is headed lower ($5500-$6000 range) so I'm waiting and I think many other people are too. 
and we might end up over $20k, no one knows.
So people stop mining. Mining difficulty decreases, people profit again with lower overhead. People need to stop thinking the price can't drop below the currect production/mining cost.
Good question! :) 

So, what will happen then? Which miners will start to shutdown and which ones will still be able to maintain a profit?

Lets find out!
If you believe Bitcoin is going to be worth billions in the future then there is no such thing as mining at a loss. You might be 1kor 5k down today, but all earned bitcoins will one day pay off all losses.

But moon jokes aside, Bitcoin mining existed when it was worth $1 or $100. 4.5k is an arbitrary number because of miners overinvesting. There is no need to put any level.
None.  

Some of the miners will stop mining, hash rate will drop and difficulty will likewise be reduced to achieve one block/10 minutes.  This will continue to a level where miners will again find it profitable.

That's the beauty of BTC.  It works regardless of price and don't forget this is the system that worked when BTC was $10.
I wanna know WHO THE FUCK TOOK A BAJILION IN TETHER IN EXCHANGE FOR BTC?!!!

Answer me this someone!@
I don't think that. I just mean there are likely a lot of fund managers on the fence, due to a lack of regulatory clarity and waiting to pull the trigger.
Because the .com bubble went to 6trillion way back in late 90's so if you compare it to current market cap of crypto it's not big money at all and also that was a regional market
If it hit $4,500 per BTC I assure you I would buy. I would also buy at $7,000 because I really don’t give a flying falcon what the price is.

Edit** I spelled “also” incorrectly.
no.
