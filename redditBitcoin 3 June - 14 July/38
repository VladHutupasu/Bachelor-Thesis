Daily Discussion, June 07, 2018 -- TITLE
BTC price this time last year: $2732
2016: $576
2015: $222

Good things come to those who wait (and don‚Äôt hate)
The way I see it at the moment is something like this, if someone had said Bitcoin would be as it is now in early 2017 you would have bitten their hands off, we are in great shape compared to that time period.  Obviously those people that bought during the December boom period are hurting, some a lot more then others but I still think over the next few years they will do well.   
**Bullish Signals Hint at Bitcoin Price Breakout**

https://www.coindesk.com/bullish-signals-hint-at-bitcoin-price-breakout/

Still stuck in a narrowing price range, BTC could soon rise to resistance above $8,000 if the bulls are able to leap the 50-week moving average hurdle.

As of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $7,770 on Bitfinex, having been stuck in a narrowing price range (pennant) for months now.

Defense of $7,000 last week and the 9.3 percent rise from the last week's low have neutralized the immediate bearish outlook and got investors talking about a possible rally to pennant resistance at $8,870.

While that target may appear far-fetched, it may be put to test if bitcoin can first scale the key 50-week moving average (MA) resistance (currently located at $7,819) in a convincing manner.

View

BTC could rally to $8,000 in the next 24 hours or so if the resistance at $7,780 is breached.

BTC looks set to close this week (Sunday's close as per UTC) above the 50-week MA of $7,819. In this case, the probability of a move higher towards pennant resistance of $8,880 would rise sharply.

Bearish scenario: BTC could drop to pennant support at $7,080 if the bulls fail to capitalize on the positive setup seen in the daily chart and prices drop below $7,372 (June 5 low).

A weekly close below$7,080 (downside break of the pennant pattern) could yield a sell-off below $6,000 (February low).
Waiting for that boom
ok we are about to break the descending triangle from ATH.. any moment now. Most bullish moment in 6 months. Prepare for some last minute desperate shorting attempts

Regardless of Bitcoins recent price movements, it seems like the sentiment is slowly changing back to a positive outlook.
How do I run a lightning node on windows?
In peak o last year rally I have taken out everything i put in bitcoin and I was left with some of it. So I dont have my skin in the game. Sometimes i just wonder why bitcoin didnt died already. I know why‚Ä¶ People will always be greedy and central banks will always print money. There is no other way around than longterm rising value of bitcoin. Buy low, sell high. Just wait for the next financial crysis to come to see how bitcoin will react... Buy low, when high, take out everything you have put in, but leave the profit inside. This way you accumulate bitcoin and you will not have anything in "The Game" - did you lost?
Hey guys! Any suggestions on how to make an excel to keep track of my portfolio with good analitics like money allocation and P/L , or where to find one? maybe download it ?

Thanks in advance

Bitcoin's confused, it doesn't know what is up or down anymore, it goes sideways :D
I like where this is going. If you zoom out
Here we go.
Fucking low trading volume.
Is it worth or even possible to mine bitcoin now as a one man set up, or have all the massive warehouse setups killed it? 
8k NEVER AGAIN!

Oh no.  WHATAMIGONNADOOOOO???


[/costanza](https://youtu.be/cKUvKE3bQlY)
Tread lightly people, everytime "news" about btc about to breakout or exceed 8k releases, ppl fomo then it drops hard.  Ive seen this time and time agsin.  Whales are manipulating news and creating false hope here and online everywhere so people buy in then the whales sell off and dump dropping the value by hundreds.  Ive seen this pattern time and time again since january.  The highs are getting lower and lower and thats a fact.
Let‚Äôs stand together with John mcafee to seek a debate between him and the SEC on live tv üì∫ on CNN.  This is an overreach from the SEC which will affect many cryptos.

I have a question guys, if you call yourself a Bitcoin Maximalist does this mean you automatically support core? Thoughts?
What analytics sites / resources are out there for Lightning Network? Is it possible to get any sense of the transaction traffic LN is handling? I'm taking about beyond just open channels, committed BTC, and number of nodes.
I'm holding long term so I'm more excited during these times as I believe Bitcoin is really undervalued.

Anyway, clearly **Heading relentlessly for 8k.**

and getting my Lambo prepped for space travel.
Noob here with a noobish question:
If I send money to an address my wallet will broadcast this transaction to some nodes which in turn do the same and so on. So these nodes then pick some transactions from a pool including mine and start mining. So it is possible that 2 miners work on the same transaction at the same time right? So in the end there might be 2 blocks which contain the same transaction. What mechanism prevents them to append both blocks to the chain?

I feel like there will probably be another bart pattern soon. everytime it hits 7700, it faces hard rejection

Take a look at the 4 hour chart - higher highs, higher lows - it's breakout time lady and gentlemen.
**Support the Bears!**
Btc needs to stop holding the altcoins down. Organic growth will be seen amongst many altcoins soon as they are driven by real world utility and actual usecase. Gonna be a good day to see the market respond correspondently. Usecase will be the drive of this market in the end.

Keep dreaming ....Waiting for the boom...The Boom to 6200 dollar yes.
So, still waiting for da institutional money?
Institutional money....I got sucked into with that bullshit excuse....institutional money cane and raped everyone and left in January 
[removed]
Yep. We have an emerging global asset which virtually no institutions own yet. Fascinating circumstance. 
I‚Äôm one of those people hurting :( 
High quality horoscope. Something like weather forecast

We are sitting on the brink of a financial revolution. A lot of money coming to crypto. You might have to wait for it but she will reward all the early believers.
On my chart (linear, Bitfinex) we have already broken it 12h ago.

On the log chart it's still quite far away.
hahah I was just listening to this, it fits so well with bitcoin

Can't believe I forgot about this song. Pink Floyd was my God when I was in my teens and early 20s.
Agreed.
You think so? I thinks it‚Äôs neutral. The news cycle stopped hating on it, to now very little mention at all. Holders are holding, but buyers aren‚Äôt coming in yet. 

I‚Äôm grateful to just have a pause. 
Well that was shit to read

I thought it was going to the right

I'm across the street from my computer now with my binoculars, and it is looking good!  

Or maybe that's my TV.
Agreed, if you look from before the buddle started the trend is now upwards. 
4h chart - very positive.

Got to go now; nurse calling.

I'll be back when the sedatives have worn off.
Don't worry about the price every hour just put it in a hardware wallet and come back in a few years.
People are hodling. Period.
$4.2B per day is not low (if you believe these are real trades, which I do not).
I would guess it all comes down to how cheap your electricity is.  I don't see why you couldn't be profitable with a small one man set up (connected to a pool ofc) as long as your electricity is cheap and you didn't overpay for the equipment.
Imagine that the BTC network is a pizza place that cook a pizza every 10 minutes and divide the salesfigure amongs the people baking the pizza. Pizza is a rare delicacy being cooked only at this place and is all the craze at the moment, people and are paying good money to buy pizza from this pizza place:

\- 4 people cook the pizza and 10 minutes later they divide it amongst each other. Every cook get 1/4 of a whole pizza (say they are a pool of 100&#37; of the network for simplicity sake). Everyone find it fair because the 10 minutes of work was worth 1/4 of a pizza. You think this is a sweet job and invest a good chunk of your savings to move to another city and start baking pizza because it pays so well. ( This is an analogy to BTC mining being profitable for you for a specific hardware at today's difficulty of the network. So you think you'll be printing money and splurdge your saving into a sweet Bitmain S9 \+ Power supply).

\- 8 people cook the pizza, the pizza will not come in 5 minutes because the oven is magic and can't give you pizza any faster because you're more at the task, everyone get 1/8 of the pizza. Everyone still find it fair if 1/8 of pizza is still worth 10 minutes of labor. (This is an analogy of you being now a miner, and as time goes by you see your mining profit dwindling away and the cost of having purchased the ASIC is now looking like a foolish attempt to get rich quick).

\- 16 people cook the pizza, again the oven is magic and 10 minutes later the pizza come and has to be shared. now let's say 1/16 of a pizza doesn't justify working there anymore. And there is so many people with your skillset on the job market no one wants to hire you for a similar position (this is an analogy of your sweet Bitmain S9 having now the value of a paperweight sometimes in the future).

\- People having the skillset to bake pizza are easily found in the market and some accept a smaller wage than you. (This is an analogy to other people having access to electricity at cheap rate VS your cost of electricity)

Alternative endings (combo are possible):

\- You are fired of the pizza place. you're out of a job. (This is an analogy of your sweet Bitmain S9 being defective for some reasons and out of warranty and is now a paperweight).

\- The pizza place isn't a regulated industry and other business are opening in all corners of the city and are selling ersatz of your rare pizza. (This is an analogy of new altcoins poping up everyday and diluting the value of the crypto market).

\- Everyone is tired of eating pizza at so many different places and the price of the pizza is going down.(This is an analogy to the loss of interest in crypto as it isn't perceived as anything else than speculation at the moment by the large public).

If you consider being a miner, do not only consider if you'll be "profitable" at the:

\- present cost of electricity.

\- present difficulty of the network.

\- present value of the BTC.

But also what when your profit marging will be enough to even out the purchase of the hardware.

try to factor in your labor time (but you can write it off if you consider this a fun hobby).

Is BTC mining profitable at the moment?

I don't think so unless your electricity is damn cheap or free.

Also, do not HODL too much, sometimes you have to take a profit, don't be a bagholder.
Do whatever gets you more Bitcoin lol
You keep misspelling his name. 
Next years Consensus conference I‚Äôm going one up you and say 9k.  This year is not going to be what people think.  Bitcoin needs a good 3-5 years. We are at the dial up stage of early internet.

Very professional way to get your point across.  This is why Crypto adoption will take longer than it should.  Shit like that makes the community sound like children.

Enlighten me :)

we see it
meep.
Of course.  There is only one Bitcoin.
"Core" is the software. *Bitcoin* is the coin.
It is called Bitcoin. The whole mechanism is about preventing double spend.
Don't worry, there have been billions of transactions - and this has never happened.  BTC is remarkably reliable.

Google: Bitcoin double spend.

It's mostly fake volume.

GDAX trading for BTC/USD is only $32m daily and all US exchanges is less than $100m.  

Up to you to believe either:

a.   America is so small that it is irrelevant (2% of $4.2B trades).

b.   Most of the $4.2B trades are fake.

So which do you want to believe?

Altcoins need to go away for the most part.  None of them really work,  except to facilitate the crypto market itself.  It will be obvious to you soon enough,  but alas, it will be too late.
Altcoins deserve holding down!  They ought to be holding themselves down naturally!  98% of them are shitcoins.  Without investment into BTC the vast majority of them would be worth zero.

Get real!

Do you think a semi-functional scam coin like Bcash, for example, would be worth more than 20 USD without BTC?

There is a small handful of coins with genuine utility, security and trusted technology - the other 1000+ are close to worthless.

JMHO :)

It certainly does at the moment  :)
They are so good!  :)
It seems like both bears and bulls are finding things to get excited about on the charts.  I guess this means that no one has any clue where price will be in a week.
Did you lost?
Thanks

BTW there hasn't been 1 billion transactions on Bitcoin not even close

Hmm I'm not sure if I'm optimistic still. Hoping for the best though.
Yes that might be a good idea. Currently I'm trading CFD's though.
no they are not... "people" are leaving for now... China is buying all the dips and they are hodling ;)
your post made me hungry...and it's 3 am :(
Thankyou confirms for me that a bit worthless when a one man show with not much firepower, but that being said are bitcoin miners starting to become like taxi men, putting people off the job for more profit for them selves ha
Wouldn't have a clue how to do it like but just curious? 
Thanks! Fixed 
I hope you're right. I need to accumulate. Comeon, $5k!
Are you blind? Have you been watching the same Bitcoin over the last decade? I guarantee it will see all time high within 1.5 years from today.

Good, I wasn't sure as it is subscription-only. Another 1,000 or 100,000 like her would help adoption :)
Could you expand on it and provide reasoning? I'm not on either side by the way I am just interested to hear opinions
Sorry, I know I was throwing that term around loosely but I was referring to the Bitcoin 'Core' Development Team. What I am trying to establish is whether or not someone can be considered a Bitcoin Maximalist by supporting the idea of Bitcoin and believing that is the one coin to rule them all. Should whether you support a certain team even come into it?

Altcoins have much more potential gains. If btc decides to go on another run, what do you think will go up most in value, btc or an altcoin with a rock solid team and vision that they consistently progresses towards?
Altcoins are a good way to fund legit projects and at the same time give people the ability to instantly liquidate their investment if they choose, I'm pretty sure people can't do that with stocks because it takes longer to sell.Just like with penny stocks their are a lot of scams and that is what the SEC needs to target but not all of them
I suspect he's speaking with his mouth full.

How much did you leverage?

How many has there been?
Choo choo - troll train passin' thru :)
More like Americans are paying in USD and China is selling using cheap Tether.
well the firepower doesn't matter much because you'll be working in a pool so you'll get your fair share of the job. The problem is that you'll be competing with people with lower cost of operation and with better gear quality. And soon your firepower won't be profitable anymore and I wish you to have recoup your investment by then because profitability doesn't go up on the long term, it only goes down.

What you have as a hobby miner against larger setup is: 

\- Cost of airconditionning. Having a smaller enough setup will not need air conditionning.

\- Cost of labor. you'll be the one maintaining the rig operation (cleaning and supervision).

\- Cost of real Estate. Large operation have to justify the cost of the large place they are renting. You on the other hand only have to find a small place for your small operation.

\- Being able to wait for your profit. You could take your mined BTC and put them on a regular basis at a limit sell order a bit higher than the market price of the day you mined it. This would be a way to squeeze a few &#37; of profitability. But don't be a bagholder. Large operation have to pay rent and huge cost of electricity. They have to cash out on a regular basis, you don't (unless you're going in debt for your mining operation but then I would advise against doing it).

You have to keep your operation small unless you want to end up with those costs as well.
I don‚Äôt think we will get that lucky, but maybe 6k.  I‚Äôm just waiting for my time to buy back in not feeling it right now.
That wasn't directed at you, but rather Mcafee.  Speaking like a douche bag isn't going to get us too far.  Just saying
Cheap coins?
There's no need.  Nothing to discuss.   Might as well ponder whether protons are positive.
As I understand it, a "maximalist" is someone whos holdings consist of mainly *one* coin.

So a Bitcoin maximalist would hold mostly Bitcoin.
I think they are happy just keeping the price steady while the whales unload their BTC for cash.
Once it breaks 7800, Cboe stock is going up too
I know :)
Would that be a long term vision?  BTC is not only the leading and established coin - it looks to the future, and is solving scaling problems imaginatively and long term - not relying upon short term hacks.

To moan about BTC dominance is akin to the captain of a ship complaining about the existence of the sea.
yea but this get rich quick frenzy with alts is gonna die out faster than most are prepared for.   All these 'gains'  go away very fast under many scenarios floating about.  I'm pretty sure you'll be caught flat footed,  because that is the intent.

A rock solid team means shit,  a proven track record is all that matters. 
I am not saying they are all scams: some are scams, some are not. 
The vast majority are shitcoins.  Many of the non-scams are still shitcoins!

To learn why - put a large investment into one, and see how its price looks in, say, 1 month - that should be enough to convince you :)
lol that burn

I buy weekly with money I'd probably otherwise light on fire. Worst case I'm buying myself a fun story. Best case is a hedge against a real financial catastrophe. Either way, win/win.
Oh ok, my bad.   Mcafee is outrageous with his tweets but very professional in real life when he interviews and gives speeches.  Look him up on YouTube. 
I goes beyond that a bit, IMO.  Maximalists tend to think their coin is the *only* one that's needed, and everything else is useless or inferior.  
how much longer?
(Don't tell anyone, but Bcashers come over here because they don't have enough contributors to have any form of free discussion on their own hijacked subreddit. 

And even if they did, it would all be moaning and conspiracies.  Doh !

Anyway, as I've said, keep this to yourself.  I'd hate to humiliate the RogerCoiners.)
The bitcoin blockchain suffers a lot of issues such as lack of scalability, slow transaction times, high fees. We need lightning network to somehow fix that, but in btc's current state it is essentially useless when being used as a currency. Not to mention the total waste of electricity that could be easily solved by using the consesus algorithm instead. BTC will never be mass adopted, it is outdated tech.. Now the question remains; will it become the new standard for digitized gold and used as a store of value? It may, it may not, but I sure hope btc will thrive in value regardless.
Na i gotta change it to GanjaOnceAMonth 
Neither one will ever happen again.
recently someone posted a link of mcafee doing an interview, i didn't watch the video, but other people were commenting that he appeared to be completely wasted.  i imagine that mcafee's grandstanding is beneficial for bitcoin overall but i wouldn't describe him as professional.
It's a pseudo-geek myth that BTC is outdated technology.  Rather like arguing that the wheel is outdated.
Shhhh just play along 
Depends on the context of the interview.   There are several of him wearing suits talking to the media or at blockchain conferences over the past few years.   He also spent a couple of years talking to the press about cyber security.  He ran for president in 2016. In almost every one of those appearances I can remember he was dressed formally and often addressed others as ‚ÄúSir‚Äù.  I‚Äôve always found his perspective interesting and worth a listen. 
How so? Is bitcoin scalable to thousands of transactions per second maybe? Or is it capable of instant settlement like a world wide adopted asset needs to offer? Don't think so tbh.
McAfee is a loon, paid shill, drug addict, and possible murderer. Have you ever actually done any research on him other than these interviews? He is not someone you should want as a spokesperson for anything lol 
With LN it is scalable to considerably more than thousands per second - but it is a work in progress.
The way I see it, Bitcoin provides two things extremely well: security and scarcity.  Any time you want more bandwidth you're going to have to sacrifice on security in some form; however, with lightning network, individuals can indeed handle thousands of TX/s rather easily and it doesn't require putting the entire base chain at risk.
err  NO blockchain based ANYTHING is currently scalable to ANYWHERE near what will be needed to make it come close what can be done with centralized datacenters, i.e. Visa.   

something will come,  it may be here now, it may not.  whatever it is,  it won't be a coin you buy, or a token,  it will be boring dull infrastructure that maybe 10 guys get very wealthy from,  nobody else.    I saw this same shit 20 years ago with Java,  everyone thought they could somehow invest in Java,  because it was gonna take over the world,  and become the ONE language.

Now Java did actually gain an amazing mind share,  and is now ubiquitous,  but nobody that ever invested in a Java pure play ever made money.
I‚Äôve done plenty of research on him. Don‚Äôt believe everything you read on the internet.  Try actually listening to the man speak when he‚Äôs being serious.  It is far too easy to just reiterate the meme of McAfee.  He is more than just his wild crazy side. 
whether you believe it or not does not negate the fact that having this guy as the ‚Äúface‚Äù of crypto is a bad look, especially when he‚Äôs pulling shit like this.  
He‚Äôs just one face of many.  If you want a milquetoast, clean as a whistle, alternative there are also the winklevoss twins. They‚Äôve been pretty quiet lately though and very acquiescent to the demands of regulators.  At least mcAfee is trying to fight for us.
