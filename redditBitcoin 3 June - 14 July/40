Daily Discussion, June 05, 2018 -- TITLE
What I like is we have been "relatively" stable for price for the last 4 months... During the last 4 months Bitcoin has had 3,significant price lows, the first low was on Feb 6th.

Heres the good news each low has been higher than the previous low. This wouldn't be so relevant if it was over 21 days, but its been 4 months of a stable price with higher and higher bottoms.

To be fair I need to add that BTC price highs have been getting lower too over the last 4 months...so higher lows and lower highs...and generally a much more stable price.

At 4 months the evidence and psychologically around BTC reaching having reached its price bottom is getting stronger by the day.

People are feeling more comfortable beginning to accumulate BTC again... Every month in this  price range that passes, looks more and more like 2016....where many people accumulated the entire time.

Its nice to see real signs that we may have bottomed or at least real signs of support getting stronger by the day. 

I want the price to moon tomorrow, BUT if I can accumulate for the next few months or even next year will likely be the best scenario that could happen to many of us, who decide to accumulate again.


There's an upcoming Blockchain conference in India. 
Its a nearly perfect tripple bottom. If the support line at 7000 doesnt fall, there should be a nice uptrend in the next weeks. 
Fasten your seatbelts :D
watch this magic of 6th day of last months [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Defwq\_lUQAANnO6.jpg](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Defwq_lUQAANnO6.jpg)
So June 6th prophecy is coming true? https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8mwi9o/market_manipulation_or_just_a_coincidence/

These pumps and dumps are so tedious now! 
Take advantage of these crazy swings, buy low, sell high.  The pattern is still the same, month after month.

Green dildos, then a bloody turd dropping.

Just remember how much youve spent, keep an excel log because its easy to lose track of your current gains and losses.
10k by friday! 7k by sunday!
**Come On Bulls, lets finally get 2018 going again!**
Are there any reliable trustworthy BTC mixers/tumblers known not to scam? I have done some research and a few seem legit, but I'd like to double check before sending my BTC to a tumbler. 
Bitcoin price gradually going to the moon now... Warch-out!!! 
Sweet   
A@
Today is the day. It will either turn bullish or bullshit.
Bitcoin has "died" over 300 times at this point. But what people fail to realize is that adoption is increasing. With adoption, more people will invest which means that people become less reliant on banks. Cryptocurrency is the future :).
Tripple Bottom, here we come!
Hey guys, my uncle had ALL of his 2FA entries from different websites/apps through Google Authenticator and I told him that Google doesn't back that app up in the cloud. Is there another more efficient less cumbersome way for him to move them to yubikey besides **manually deactivating** each and every 2fa entry he had there or that's it? I just told him that cuz I don't know either
Why are people expecting "moon" or a rise in the value soon? Bitcoin and crypto are largely disliked by the broader community. Go on Hacker News or r/technology. Bitcoin is treated like a joke.

So I'm wondering where this momentum is going to come from if not from technology enthusiasts? 
It would be something that is intentionally not discussed (yet) but is there any examples or plans of using Bitcoin to help avoid the trade tarrifs?
Even if it were just discussed as an option to facilitate the continuation of existing trade between EU, Canadian or Chinese companies and US companies.

Emphasizing that Bitcoin use to facilitate trade and jobs in both countries where tarrifs are put in place...including the US, showing how Bitcoin kept US jobs going would IMO be helpful. 

Its a matter of time until nations with trade sanctions begin using Bitcoin in a thoughtful, private enough way to sell some oil. Has this happened already? I bet it's hard to prove
but I'm OK with Russia keeping some emergency reserve bitcoin on hand. Same with  countries that don't have sanctions on them now but might have sanctions in a few months  from now, Iran had this happen. 
Maybe stocking up on some BTC is a viable backup option now. 

Myself as a Canadian, I can say people here aren't upset with American people at all. But it's the leadership throwing sanctions on us after being ultra close allies, and to be called a threat to our neighbors security after sending troops to Afghanistan and supporting essentially everything the white house asked, people are talking about it all over. 

Nobody knows who is next in line, for tarrifs or sanctions. So wouldn't it be prudent to have some BTC? 

I feel this trade war is getting people thinking of backup plans... 

Sorry for talking politics. I have family in the US, and great US friends who spend summers in Montreal. The question  is, isnt this exactly one of the reasons Bitcoin exists? Monetary sovereignty 


BULL RUN.
we moon tomorrow
Interesting list!
Temporary bottom right now? 
Russia welcome bitcoin to this year edition of FIFA World Cup in this month of June as it will be used as a misse of payment to archive tickets. How far will this really improved the rate and interest of people in bitcoin?
Hyperbitcoinization
Like clockwork. 
nnnnnnngreeeen.....\(silence then, out of nowhere\)..... REEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!
I had a question about taxes maybe someone can help. When you say trade how do you go about paying taxes. I trade to make small gains often I just wonder i taxes are going to bite me in the ass at the end of the year for doing so many small trades.
**COME ON BULLS!**
Every other 6th of the month Bitcoin tops out then falls to the lowest point in exactly a month. It has done this 6 months in a row, This month were heading back up.
THIS ENORMOUS DIP WILL DEVOUR US ALL!
We've been in a parallel downward channel for the past month. Bitcoin switches between uptrends and downtrends on a roughly monthly cycle. We're also approaching a major trendline around 7k that has been confirmed 4 times since November 2017. Most likely scenario is a natural bounce off 7k to topside. Always a possibility somebody is waiting to dump the market at a critical point for a short.
Pumpy wump
Descending channel forming over the last day and a half. Likely more downward movement to go, though these tend to eventually break upwards.
who let the bulls out, i thought the bears locked them in their cages

It's dropping like a rock....
first
When moon? 
I've been waiting for my lambos since I bought in on 13th December 2017.
62% down and I'm so loving crypto lol
You can all thank me for contributing to ATH 😀

pretty cool and informative live trading https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DK1ORnAxKwI 
[deleted]
Bitcoin will be $6 million by Sunday. Mark my words. I am 102% accurate.
so is crypto dead
I would agree with you on this. Great time to accumulate like you said. 
That's the same thing I have been thinking. If your new or if you sold a lot of your Holdings in 2017. Really. You don't want the price to go high. You want it to just kind of cruise along. If Bitcoin went to 50,000 tomorrow it would just piss you off because you aren't going to have that much to sell and Mining would get just ridiculous. 
I think it will need some more time to settle down properly. My estimate was 7-8 tousand is the real price (estimate in november-december) We need to test the floor to start proper accumulating
And?
Tell us more please.  India is an area where we could certainly do with far more expansion.  What is the latest in terms of the government wanting to ban it?
My prediction: if Bitcoin doesn’t fall below $7K, then it will be over $7K. Don’t ask me how I know that...I’m just very intuitive.
>  If the support line at 7000 doesn't fall, there should be a nice uptrend in the next weeks. 

if it doesn't go down, then it will go up.  genius.
You've been saying that for 6 months already.
Tripple bottom? More like octuple bottom Since January
I dont think there is a bottom.  I forsee it going into the negatives.  Brace yourselves for the negative bloody turd drop.  I feel it coming, its gonna rip everyone a new asshole.
I dont wanna see July 6th then! 😾
Just follow the RSI14 and you'll be good.
Panic mode.
Do you ever post without mentioning bloody turd? 
2018 is finished. 5m by December

Buy mining power on Nicehash. Mine altcoin. Sell altcoin for new BTC.
Or it will just go its way like it did past few years
Do you have some statistics for adoption that lead you to this position that you can share?
Ah, I saw that dumb as fuck Cointelegraph article.

Reciting a clickbait article header is really the kind of quality content I expect from this thread. 
But seems those newbees only spend their money on those worthless icos. Even during this bear market, people can easily raise tens of millions of USDs easily, while kept 96% of the tokens as the team fund. 
If you mean bitcoin price in triple digits, then yeah, you're right
That app is extremely safe. I would highly suggest not moving away from it. Sms 2fa is subject to phone porting attacks. Authenticator cannot be compromised unless the hacker gets ahold of your device or you have authenticator running on a machine they can get malware into.

Write down your one time use recover codes and store them somewhere safe.
Yubikey is awesome, but I fail to see the advantage. Would it not be just as succeptable to device loss / hardware failure?
I don't think this is true. Most of them respect Bitcoin but have not yet invest to it. 
It has been my experience over many years that those who treat Bitcoin like a joke have no understanding of what Bitcoin actually is, nor the basics of how it works, nor the reasons it was invented in the first place.

On top of that, you get broke, jealous people who are upset about missing out.
People have been asking that question for the past 9 years.

Hint. People aren't always honest or educated in what they are commenting on
When you move goods across a border, the only way to avoid tariffs is to either mislabel goods, avoid getting them inspected, or smuggle them. Bitcoin doesn't change any of that.
Sorry, what exactly are you suggesting?  

BTC is not even legal tender in most countries and you expect the American or Chinese government to accept it for settlement of tariff taxes?

Moon in about the year 2025 after 2 more halvings 
Yup
This question will get as many answer as you have countries I guess. I would suggest you to consult a tax accountant to get a definitive answer relative to your region of the world and the tax laws that are applicable to you.
Just admit only transfers to and from your bank account.
This is what a lot of people think. And because of that, i think the opposite will happen. Bear-Whales gonna shit on peoples expectations again.
Do the opposite of what is expected
> Every other 6th of the month Bitcoin tops out then falls to the lowest point in exactly a month.

how? i never invest more than I can afford to lose :(
I won't enter until we get at least 6-7 confirmations at 7k.
Yes, the price can go up or down
I think we'll hit just around 7200 and then back up from there to try and break past 10k again.
Think you're missing an "h" in there.
stop looking at the 5 mins chart lol
The only thing that seems to be dropping like a rock is your sanity.
What are you talking about mate?  

It's been flat for last 2 weeks.  I'm not even sure if it's still alive.
??? What chart are you looking at? Yes we've dropped down to 7000 for the 3rd time or so but honestly it's holding above that point pretty well. This is pretty bullish as it establishes 7000 as strong support. Btw when I say 7000 i really mean the range from about 6500 to 7000, nothing is exact. So how that is "dropping like a rock" is beyond me.
it's spelled "frist".
Oof. But yeah it will probably be 2020 before we get a new ath. It could be sooner but it will happen eventually. No point in selling now.
Cool, that means I can buy tons at 1k
I laugh in Chinese. 
Thank you Mr. McAfee.
What will you eat if it isn't $6 million by Sunday?
Where did that extra 2% come from?  That 2% makes your claim suspicious.
Yes. It will never recover. Accept it.
On the other hand, I see a massive bull run coming up. It'll hit the 250k range. It might go down tho tbh, but if not it'll probably go up. This is just speculation however, I am not an investment advisor. 
That’s what I’m doing 
This will help in understanding about the technology and attract more investor. Ian Balina might be attending. 
 
Government is not imposing ban on cryptos. They just issued a warning. Also , the matter is being taken to court. They postponed the hearing until July. 

The conference is backed by Telengana State government . 
There's a slim chance it will be exactly 7k
We've got a large chance of something eventually happening here.
Hi. New here, been lurking in the daily discussion thread for a couple months now and I literally just see the same things said over and over and over.  It’s pretty funny actually.
how can he be saying that for months.....if we haven't formed a triple bottom until this week? literally makes no sense. 6 months ago we were ATH?
Surely there are 3 p's in triple?
Who cares? The game is long. DCA your position and be happy about an extended timeframe to add. The end game is not a high value to exchange for fiat riches. If Bitcoin wins, fiat becomes worthless. If Bitcoin loses, it is worth nothing. 
Negative $7000 bitcoin means we owe bitcoin $7000 somehow...mm...my brain hurts trying to figure that one out.
Far from panic just bored.  
Is there a working implemented service for that? 
Seems quite unnecessary. Couldn't I just do the last part; exchange a fill order for BTC to an altcoin, then exchange with a similar fill order back to BTC? 
You can rent SHA256 on Nicehash. You can point it to a BTC pool and get fresh BTC out of it. Don’t know if the yield will be good and I don’t think so but that would be the price of fresh BTC. oh and make sure you are pointing it at a pool that pay you per Share if you want it to be quickly over.

I thought it was obvious. He's buying a new phone. That's the problem. Can he really migrate that to his new phone? 
He's upgrading his phone. You can't easily migrate to the new phone unless I'm missing something. 
I don't know man, these are technology enthusiasts and programmers. They're not ignorant.
Quite the opposite. People get it, they understand how it works but want nothing to do with it. 

Missing out on a scam going x100 doesn't make it any less of a scam

Dude, it is a joke to be paying thousands of dollars for nothing more than a number that was generated on a machine.

But as long as there's a market for trading, it's all fine.
What kind of innovation or new use case with Bitcoin could be related to the tarrif war?

To start, People have discussed foreign reserves holding Bitcoin before.... would tarrifs increase that likelihood of happening? (if it's not already) 
Yeah but most people have been onto this trend for awhile, and have been expecting it to do the opposite each time. It hasn’t yet. So, you could say just as many people are thinking the opposite of what is expected is going to happen. 
Nr 1 rule in cryptomarket.
Comon that's fucking nit-picking
So given that each confirmation is 2-3 months apart, you expect us to go perpetually sideways for the next 6-9 months? If we have that many confirmations and no defined trend it'd be more likely to break to the downside 
what's your fee?  i just don't feel honest, taking your expert advice for free.
Do you understand what "eventually break upwards" means?
I just poked it with a stick and it moved a little so I guess it's OK. 
Never heard this before. Clever, I like it.
spaghetti
Haha.  This is pretty much all TA on YouTube.
sorry, unless you provide a pretty picture with lots of lines and colors, i'm just not sure i can believe you.
you make 0 sense
Blockchain has millions of use cases. Doubt it will affect btc.
Cool and thanks for letting us know.
Telugu bro? 
Highly unlikely exactly at $7K because there’s way too many limit and stop orders exactly at $7K for it to stay there for even a millisecond. As soon as all the limit and stop orders are triggered, Bitcoin price experiences a major spike or drop as a result of the triggered orders.
Or a small chance. 
> If Bitcoin wins, fiat becomes worthless. If Bitcoin loses, it is worth nothing.

I don't think either extreme is very likely to happen.  We'll probably end up somewhere in the middle.  If full on digital currency becomes the sole way of the future I think it's quite far down the timeline still, probably outside of our lifetimes.
Lol .... you have been watching too much BTC marketing BS.
Remember the gold standard?  Cmon man.  
Thank you!

Transactions appear to track price, so the idea that adoption is increasing independent of price is debunked, I think.
As far as I know you cannot. He has to re set up the process. Make sure he has his recovery seed. With most things if you're signed in he can just regenerate the link with his new phone. Like the other guy said he does have to cancel everything and then redo it. It's not that bad and in my opinion it's beyond worth it for the safety you get from the application
I have migrated in the past when I had rooted phones. There is no obvious method to migrate without root. I see the appeal of the yubikey now.
There were a lot of people in the 80s that thought the internet was nothing but a bulletin board for nerds. Typewriters would never go out of style. I mean you can point to a lot of intelligent people who have said things like this. Not many people are able to think ahead. People are very reactionary. Have you ever noticed a lot of traditions some of them don't even make sense continue for generations and generations? Very few people are able to think ahead and actually live with the uncertainty created by doing so
That doesn't mean they understand \*this\* technology.  That doesn't mean they understand "money", banking, or the inherent flaws in central bank fiat currencies.
No, they are not.  

And they see it for what it really is - a number generated on a machine and sitting on a fancy ledger.
Hope your currency doesn't hyperinflate because that's a much bigger scam
You missed your opportunity back in 2013 didn’t you. It’s ok, it’s not too late. 
That's an overly simplistic way of looking at it.  I could use the same argument regarding virtually any piece of software or code.  
Your "January 6th" peak occurred 16 days early, on December 16th.  You think that I am nitpicking but the truth is that there is no pattern in this data, only noise, and you are trying to superimpose your perceptions onto it.  Everything that seems to coincide with your viewpoint, you regard as correct, and everything that contradicts your viewpoint, you regard as "nitpicking."  If you allow +/- 16 days then your thesis would always be true regardless of the data.
Honestly, I'd be happy with sideways trend for 7 months. After 6 months of downtrend I'll wait a bit longer before I feel like we truly have a reversal.
Lol
> Do you understand what "eventually break upwards" means?

it's very vague.  in fact the actual phrase that you used was

> tend to eventually break upwards.

so it might go up at some unspecified point in the future.  wow, you're a prophet.

TA is a complete fucking waste of time.
It went up $5.  Good job!
Yum, can I get in on this bet, too?
Drove over to Grand Coulee over the weekend to do some TA, you can check it out [here.](https://i.imgur.com/9BxXj7m.jpg)

Fiat and Bitcoin work on trust. When trust vanishes, so does their value.

The extremely limited supply of Bitcoin and unlimited supply of Fiat and other cryptos is not a stable situation and is inherently unpredictable. Somewhere in the middle may every well be the Moon, but as I said before, when that happens, it won't be that Bitcoin is suddenly worth riches in Fiat. It is that dollars will be majorly devalued relative to BTC.
I think neither happen. ideally fiat and crypto will just parallels.
There wasn't any?
You can't move the 2fa data in the GA app even if the phone is rooted
Deflation is even worse. Inflation incentivizes economic activity
Never too late to be a permanent bagholder
It really is that simple.

And BTC "gurus" love to tell BS stories to make it complicated.  Take away all the BS and what is left is that - a number generated on a machine.
Thought 6th of june was your big moment?
It means that if you bet a downwards channel exits its trendlines upwards, you'd be right on average 6 times out of 10. Of course, if you knew anything about probability you'd know that you only have to be right 5 times out of 10 to break even (assuming symmetrical trades for the sake of simplicity).

Why so hostile towards technical analysis? If you're afraid your Bitcoin will lose value in the current market cycle, just short it. Nobody will judge you.
I can serve as spaghetti escrow.
Or USD dumps paper and moves to block chain 🤙🏼
Then how did I do it? I used titanium backup.
Yeah we need more consumption. More plastic garbage everywhere, heavy mining to get rare elements for solar panels and Tesla's batteries, more stupid avocados to travel by planes... You dont see it? Bitcoin solves poverty/debt problems/enviroment aspects... You think you should be even more efficient? Maybe try instaling more self checking machines at McDonalds and automate more... WE NEED TO GO BACK.
Bought in August of 2013. How’s your investments faired these last 5 years? 
Apparently, you don't know what Bitcoin actually is, nor the basics of how it works, nor the reasons it was invented.

Instead of taking the time to learn, you go around attacking people who do understand... Let's see, what might that tell us about you, what kind of person you might be??
We'll see Tomorrow :) I am only worried because we didn't re-test the trendline for the 3rd time.
> if you knew anything about probability

you don't know anything about how much i know about probability, no need to be insulting.

> If you're afraid your Bitcoin will lose value

you mean "bitcoin", the currency, not "Bitcoin", the protocol.  i haven't given any indication of my expectations about the price of bitcoin.

the problem is that your predictions are too vague on which to base any decisions.  "a downwards channel exits its trendlines upwards".  how low does it go?  when does it change direction?  how high does it go?

you look backward with 20/20 vision and superimpose your perceptions on historical data.  this squiggle here is a downward channel, that one there is a bart.  but had it gone another way you'd have called it something else.  the future price of bitcoin is based not on past historical patterns but on future events, which are unknowable.
and that will never happen, so don't even waste brain cell power thinking about it
Most of USD is already digital numbers in a database. Moving to another database won't help them.
I stand erected. You can move ga via titanium backup with a rooted system. 
You are simply reinforcing my point - that advocates like yourself are simply creating BS to make a digital token appear more "complicated" than it actually is.

It is no more than a number generated on a machine.  Period.

Sure, there's a market with exchanges that encourage speculation on it's price.  But what is actually traded is no more than a computer generated number on a fancy ledger.
It's evident that you know very little about probability because you think that these are predictions. You can't predict the outcome a weighted coin but you can bet on the weighted side.

What you don't understand is that technical analysis is not unique to crypto. It's used in all the conventional stock markets and has been for generations. But sure, I'll take your word for it that crypto prices can break the laws of causality.

"you mean "bitcoin", the currency, not "Bitcoin", the protocol."

Go tip a fedora.
You are wrong, "It is no more than a number generated on a machine."

You have no clue what it actually is.
> It's evident that you know very little about probability because you think that these are predictions.

your opening comment was: "Likely more downward movement to go, though these tend to eventually break upwards."  that's a prediction, though, like all TA predictions, it's too vague to be of any practical value.  we haven't even gotten into probability yet.

> What you don't understand is that technical analysis is not unique to crypto.

i am well aware that TA has been around for a long time.  so has astrology.  that doesn't mean that either one if them is not nonsense.
Well, tell me what it is if it's not a number generated on a machine.

Be careful though - the entire bubble might just burst.
Likely means at least 50%. Enough to justify a wager. Not the same as a prediction. Unless you think all bets are predictions?

"i am well aware that TA has been around for a long time. so has astrology. that doesn't mean that either one if them is not nonsense."

Results speak for themselves. A day trader who understands technical analysis can make a consistent profit out of it, an astrologer has no such power. Do you really have trouble distinguishing between the two?
if i say, "it's probably going to rain today", that's a prediction.  yes i would say that a bet is a prediction.

astrologers believe that they can predict the future.  they convince themselves of this through a combination of 1) wording their predictions very vaguely, such that almost any outcome matches the prediction and 2) being selective in how they assess their accuracy.  proponents of TA are exactly the same.
There's one crucial thing you're forgetting, and that's that if an astrologer is wrong, they lose little but their pride, whereas a trader who gets risk-reward trades wrong stands to lose their investment. These allegedly "vague" predictions are vindicated if their traders don't go bust (and turn a profit).

But yeah, keep on hodling during a bear market while trading firms and market makers make a living trading the market. I'm sure they'll take seriously someone who thinks every risk-reward trade is a "prediction".
