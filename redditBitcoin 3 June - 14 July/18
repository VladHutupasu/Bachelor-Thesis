Daily Discussion, June 27, 2018 -- TITLE
[deleted]
Not sure if everyone is aware, but /r/btc has been on a real roll lately spamming /r/cryptocurrency daily with propaganda witch hunt type posts that they then heavily brigade the comments to try and sway the uninformed. Everyone here should make a point of reporting and down voting these posts while commenting in them to dispute their lies and stop their propaganda campaign.
Any Lightning 'expert' who can shine a light; will Lightning ever be viable for tipping online? That's one of the killer apps, but as far as I know the receiver needs to be online too, making it unreliable...
germany is out and bitcoin is down. what a day. 
I'm thinking we need a blockchain tinder? Am I right

I bought a single Bitcoin through Coinbase a couple weeks ago. Price was down, I expect an uptick at some point. Money was for investing anyway, BTC continuing to drop, its fine, im fine. BUT, when I choose to sell is selling on Coinbase all I need to do. Do I need my "code" from there. Is there certain amount of time I have before I need to sell before coinbase? 
Good morning,

A brief poem for your consideration:

&nbsp;

When Bitcoin's price has you up all night.

Blood in the streets, no end in sight

&nbsp;

Remember, the log trend is your friend.

The Bear market will soon come to an end

&nbsp;

[https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-price.html#log](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-price.html#log)

&nbsp;
Fb speculation in buying coinbase, Circle reporting +30% institutional sign ups in may, and India releasing new crypto regulation in two weeks. Things are looking good.

Also, there's signs a Chinese financial panic could occur. It'll be interesting to see the effect on crypto markets. Just in the nick of time with institutional services starting to come online.
So we've been on a decline for 7 months with no *major* spikes. Do you guys think we will ever get past 19k again or what's your prognosis?
Who are the sellers? 
Sorry for the basic ass question. I have my several word long key and would like to access my wallet from my phone instead of electrum, are there any good IOS apps that are trusted? I have been searching around this sub without much luck or seeing consensus as to which apps are trustworthy
If you used satellite for bitcoin blockchain data would it be possible to run lightning node over a normal phone line or would some type of light lightning node be needed?
Notice how nearly every article by coindesk and cointelegraph is negative this month. Inb4 I get astro turfed by their paid reddit monitors.

Decision time, this weekend. If it goes down, there's not many shorts to close, but many longs to stop out.

This damn bitcoin market crashin is what’s causing all the poverty in this country. Young dudes losing their whole hoods over this causing us to go back trapping with the ak. WhAt we need is this market to go back up I need a quick ten times gain gettin sick of waiting been waiting five six months already I’m tryin to get my house and cars soon sh* t better hurry up or this market gonna die because we keep getting slaughtered by futures 
4.5k then moon. I called it yesterday will call today

^small ^edit


I haven't invested much into bitcoins, but I am still curious what the prognosis is for the future
I use trezor.  I sent a deposit to a gambling site in Costa Rica.  My deposit went through.  At the same time my trezor showed an "unconfirmed transaction" in about the same amount.  The bitcoin from this unconfirmed transaction was also deducted from my balance.  Anyone else have an experience like this?
Bitcoin is the future. I want to buy some but sodding PayPal have my money locked up as I saved password on work PC and it broke. Awaiting new one with the back up data #fingerscrossed
[removed]
Has anyone answered the most profound question lingering in this community?  It's the elephant in the room, that must be confronted. 

When moon?
Longs increasing but price not rising. That's a bad sign, perfect setup for longs to get squeezed. Even shorts closing only brought about a small bounce.
Antminer S9 is $500 on ebay now, i remember in December the cheapest was $4500 
The volume will drop even more.
Where to look and learn more about bitcoin? :) 
Is a hard fork inevitable?

This isn't only a block size question, nor am I concern trolling. I am asking a serious question. I know I am not willing to hard fork for \*JUST\* a block size increase to another static variable. I have never once considered that a reasonable idea. 

But I guess the question does come down to is a block size increase necessary? I am not willing to make this a rhetorical question. I am being serious, is it necessary? I can see the arguments for both sides.  

I know for me personally, I am only willing to deviate my full node from the current consensus to another one if there is a seriously thought out proposal to long term scaling in place in the change. There is no way I would ever hard fork for a static variable increase like bcash 
I remember asking myself if I should invest when Bitcoin was under 1000$. I regret that I didnt
 3 years is the magic # after a crash. When we crashed from $1000 in 2014 it took 3 years to recover (2017 RUN), even in stocks, when amazon crashed 90&#37; it took 3 years, when apple crashed 70&#37; it took 3 years. It takes a long time for investors to gain back confidence. Currently most of the investors can't wait for it to go back to 7k so they can short the price and get some of their loses back then we're back down again. This cycle will repeat until a less anxious, less paranoid group of investors are willing to hold and increase the support lines. I GUARANTEE YOU 3 YEARS BEFORE WE SEE ANYTHING OVER 12K FOR BTC. It doesn't matter if the US Gov announces that they're going to make BTC the official currency of America. Investors have proven to be irrational and almost totally immune to good news.

Do you think btc has any chance of going back to 20k within the next 3 years?

GEEZ  So much negativity recently.  This will pass. How do I KNOW?     By now, you should all be aware of institutional investment expanding the crypto market. If not, watch this short video:  www.youtube.com/watch?v=waTFF_HSZI8&t=24s   
 But what are people on the street doing?  Here's a high level look at that:     "Despite bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies currently hovering near their lows for the year, interest in the nascent technology is expected to more than double in the future in the United States and Europe. This is according to a study conducted by ING Bank N.V. in Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Spain, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States and Australia.

"Per the survey, which was carried by market research firm Ipsos between March 26 and April 6, 2018, only 9% of Europeans owned a cryptocurrency at the time of polling. However, in the future 25% of those surveyed indicated that they expect to own a cryptocurrency. In the United States, 8% at the time owned cryptocurrencies while 21% said they expected to own some in the future."
    https://www.2100news.com/2018/06/27/cryptocurrency-ownership-in-europe-and-the-us-expected-to-double-ing-study/
   All indicators point to a still growing cryptocurrency market.  Enjoy the ride! It's like a roller coaster, not a rocket straight to the moon.

45k BTC 
Watch for support at 6060, then 5970, and then 5800.
After that, it's just -- watch out below.
It’s a good sign, trend reversal! Go bulls!
They're so desperate when btrash is crashing so hard compared to BTC
I very much doubt if anything in reddit impacts the price in any meaningful way.
What are they doing now? I've just kind of learned to ignore the Bitcoin bashing and only contribute there if I'm curious about something to do with Bitcoin cash

I'm planning to set up an LND node on raspberry pi.  5w of power and $30 of hardware to get it running is a fairly cheap price of entry.

Bitcoin is always down
BTC is not down - it's going sideways.
Er, sorry, but the first part really cheered me up!

:(
I sincerely hope nobody makes juvenile jokes about Grindr and Bcash now.
We went down from 9600 to 5900 amid all negative news in January/February and I remember facebook ban was a major news that time. We should see some positive uptrend. 
You're going to save considerable money if you also turn on your gdax account when you go to sell
dont sell on coinbase. sell on coinbase pro (used to be gdax).
As long as you have your bank account linked to Coinbase, pretty much all you do is click Sell. You can do this at anytime. You may need to enter your password to complete the sale.
And for your consideration:

The better things look they worse they actually are. IMO So like now how things looks bad is actually a great thing.
No.
Yes
Maybe
Prognosis negative
This place has certainly become much more depressing than it was back when bitcoin was over 10k

For your sake I would hope it rises back up eventually
I'm pretty sure that somebody will pump it at least 7000 before the next dump -- in fact, waiting on it to hit 7000 before shorting it again. These 1500 point swings are boring, but P&P (predictable and profitable).
After Nov 2013, BTC declined, went flat for 3 years and then hit ATH in 2017.

So yes, it is possible.
Yes and I’ll have four times the amount I did last time we got that mark 
Ever is a long time. 
$100k at the end of the year still holds
I don't know
Long slow slide to somewhere between 1,000 and 2,000 before improbable, exciting, fever inducing bubble in two years or so.

But my long-term prognosis is - it goes to zero as it becomes governments recognize the threat to international order and create harsh barriers to trading it making it very risky to hold.  Bitcoin is fatally flawed and will ultimately give way to real digital currency that is controlled/managed through central banks.  
Can you repeat the question?

Yeah, just look at that HUGE bounce that it generated today!
I'm expecting the same sadly, I k ow realistically I should pull my money out but I am scaaaaared shitless. 
Hope not -- too low to short safely, and want to see it give it the old college try back to 7,000 however briefly as that would give enough cushion to short again.
I lose more quickly when i try to day trade, at least with hodling I lose it slowly.

Rule #2 : Never hate yourself for taking profits
Here here! Nothing is going to change if we don’t get out there and vote, people. Meanwhile, one thing everyone can do is to write your congressmen/prime ministers/other rulers and demand an increase in the price. There is no excuse not to.

Wat 
btw, there are ways to get 10x without bitcoin tho. Hexx did a x10, GPU did a x10, AU (a complete scamcoin btw) did an x10, and a couple of others as well, why not check out some coins with hidden potential compared to solely relying on bitcoin? was just listing a couple that did x10s since Jan, but there's a lot of others too
Which country?  :)
Reeeeeeeeee
Eh, I've fairly well written off 2018, but yes, I'm also prepared for a drop into the 4K range before we see the next bull run.  Hopefully we'll have some more merchants on LN by that point.
Down vote me all you want. But in order for bitcoin to hit a new ath. It needs to drop enough that all shit coins are wiped out as well. So that market cap can go back into btc.
.. but it didn't hit 4.5k yesterday ..
You're wrong, bro. 33k by July! Guaranteed by Moku.🙏🙏 
"respected"

it's a garbage website
only a rumor at this point 
We don't know but the market isn't reacting to good news will overreacting to bad news. So it's still kind of bearish.
Would you like to visit planet Earth's only natural satellite?

Have you been thinking of buying something beginning with lamb that does not end in chop?

That, sir, is the future!

^.

^honest ^:)
Since about February, the price has been waddling back and forth in a fairly tight channel but which takes it down 1000 points or so every couple of months. Since there is utterly no reason for that trend to break, at least in the near future, it means that you're looking at 5000s by August, 4000s by October, 3000s by December, etc. Then, at some point under 3000 the price will likely bottom and then go nowhere fast until there is some material change (what that might be is anybody's guess). It's also possible that at some point folks could start to equate BTC with Iraqi dinars, etc., in which case the bottom could fall out entirely.
Expect another 6 months up to a year or more of bears eating up the crypto market and driving every price down to pennies worth. The bitcoin price you will see at the end of 2018 should be settling around at or below mining price which is anywhere from couple 1000s up to 8000 (prices vary among different countries) but more realistically, it should drop towards the 2000s to 3000s range (USD).

I don't see much recovery for the crypto market anytime soon. It will take maybe a decade or longer to reach ATH ($19750+) again.  In the meantime, cryptos have been really shitty lately and I STRONGLY believe that this trend will only continue for months or (more precisely) years to come. BTW...Before I joined Reddit, I've made this same exact prediction as early as February when the whole market started going into flames and every naysayer and their dog was flaming and berating me for stating "blatant nonsense". Now look who's got the last laugh! I sure showed them. 

If you are making the decision to sell, then all I can say is that you're not making a bad decision in any sense. You will be very happy you did but also consider what other vehicles of investment are available. (Bonds, stocks, CDs, TIPS....)

Um, what else did you expect? Pretty normal.
So two identical transactions were made? Did the second transaction confirm?

When Lambo ?
It's not just Longs increasing.  Note that Shorts are also decreasing.

This is a perfect setup for a rekk.
They were not profitable even in December, thats why the miners were selling them.
Thing isn’t profitable anymore. More efficient miner are being shipped now/soon. Miner are operating on a razor thin margin at today’s rate. Maybe people with ultra low cost of electricity will swoop in and buy them

Every technology has its pros and cons.  Decentralised block chain transactions can never (in their basic state) be super rapid or highly scalable - it is just the nature of the beast.

Bcash has simply put a sticking plaster (and a pretty unimaginative one at that) over a serious wound.

The Lightning Network is a brilliant, imaginative solution.  I'm absolutely confident that it is the icing on BTC's cake.

We will have:

Trust

Decentralisation

AND

Speed.

I am new to crypto and entered in January this year. But what I can say for sure is that it takes less than 2 weeks for sentiments to change and people start talking the opposite. You never know what people will be talking about in two weeks from now on. 
>the US Gov announces that they're going to make BTC the official currency of America. Investors have proven to be irrational and almos

I wouldn't bet. There are numerous of projects in a pipeline at the moment, from ETFs that are awaiting for regulation, to LN, etc.. so, 3 years is too long for that. I would say until the late 2018 the market would stay sluggish
Yeah, except those companies whose stock bounce back produce something and a p/e ratio to fall back upon.
2014's bear market was the longest. Previous crashes were shorter.  
No one knows how long this one will be.

This is severely off-topic.

I'm guilty of being tangential myself on this generally free and open discussion thread.  Many of us are.

But - really?   Relevance to - anything?
Another video from a crypto youtuber trying to sell his 'trading course' or 'signals group'. What a bunch of suckers

I appreciate the positivity, but there's no fucking way 8% of Americans own crypto. I work in an office full of programmers, and it's probably less than 5% of people in my office that own some crypto. For all of the US, I suspect it's more like <1%.
"All indicators"

Other than the fairly constant price slide, or course.
> All indicators point to a still growing cryptocurrency market.

Except actual adoption. Still practically no one actually uses bitcoin for purchasing stuff, everyone is only using it to get rich quick. There are more major companies that are stopping their bitcoin acceptance than ones that start, citing complete lack of use. I had hoped that this would gradually improve over the years but it looks like adoption has hit a complete standstill for years now. And without this, all price movement is just foundationless speculation and has the potential to collapse far harder than it already has.
ssshhhhhhhh don't give them hope! i'm still filling mah altcoin bags D:

I went from an initial investment of 40k to 470k in Jan back down to 60k. Fuck my life why didn't I pull out. I'm going down with the ship now, but I do feel like we're at the bottom. C'mon bitcoin!!! 
The new support is floor, isn't it?
Agreed but you can't just let people keep posting lies and propaganda unchallenged. It allow them to shape a narrative to fool newbies who don't know any better.

So we've been on a decline for 7 months with no major spikes. Do you guys think we will ever get past 19k again or what's your prognosis?
The only one referenced in the wiki is the bitcoin.com wallet, which when I enter my 12 word seed, gives me an error, even though the exact same seed worked in electrum yesterday.

And how are we supposed to take profits when we just got into the market in January your comment is coming from a person who got involved back last year where you guys made massive gains will put yourself in other people shoes for once there is no gains if you got in this year. Markets down 70% And they wonder why the crime rate so high because young Niggas going broke over his whole crypto currency rush all these YouTube or’s telling everybody to get invested in January now look at us  This market has turned into one big damn joke And I ain’t laughing and neither is all the people round the world he’ll even mainstream laughing at us now. I don’t want to hear none of that profit shit there right now take a no profits unless less you got about a half a million to swing with rest of us stuck holding for god knows how long 
No. I'm too lazy to vote :(.
Hahahaha yes high on cryptocurrency and Red Bull 
Futures contracts hurt in killin the whole market difference this year then any other year futures involved now price of bitcoin will never recover because they won’t allow it up taking us young niggas down right with it causing more poverty in this country just a damn shame 
If people get rekt because of shitcoins while Bitcoin is also dropping in price at the same time, I would imagine that would encourage a lot of them to get out of crypto entirely rather than put it all in Bitcoin. We have already seen that when prices drop, not only does Bitcoin's market cap go down, but the entire crypto market cap goes down with it. There's little reason to think that the entire market cap of crypto would simply be transferred into BTC in the event of a major crash. Many (perhaps most) people would just get out.
Think about it, btc didnt hit a ath with 10000's of random ass coins. The market needs to kills these so the valuable 25 or so coins can recover. Instead of this stupid back and forth shit.
I fully agree that shitcoins need pruning - and you may be right.  

But I can't see the basis for the call.
Uh, except of course that if BTC starts to rise substantially, then new altcoins will appear. Sorry, but BTC is never going to have a monopoly on capital.
Well no, my post yesterday called it for july. Should have added that lol
Come on man, at least mine is more attainable lmfao
Hence my '?'
No cause clif high said 💯 k bit by end of the year 
Normally, it would be logical to short.

But the problem is, I believe that the major exchanges (especially Bitfinex) are themselves manipulating the price and making a killing wiping out leveraged Shorts/Longs whenever they stack up.

So what's your take on this?
That Is a very pessimistic forecast.  I think we’ll start to see a turn around this fall 
>all I can say is that you're not making a bad decision in any sense.

Oh.

Well there is, of course, the completely opposite argument - that he would be an idiot to sell at this stage - but hey, you wrote a lot of words there, so maybe you're right.

As for a decade to reach ATH again - do you have any sense of timescale in these markets? - that is approximately the age of BTC to this point.  Doh! :)

p.s. I bet your favourite bread is *short*-bread :)
Years is less precisely than months.
See post history, full time shilling
> My deposit went through. At the same time my trezor showed an "unconfirmed transaction" in about the same amount. 

I think he means that an another transaction showed up in his wallet in addition to the one he wanted to make.

When ramen ? Spare some change for ramen ?
The audacity!!!
In December with BTC at ATH, they were extremely profitable. Depending on your electricity costs they're still profitable today albeit much less so.
Yeahh right 😀
And honestly, to me, it seems like if Lightning Network really works and has a good UI wallet , we don't need anything more than 1mb. It seems like there will never be a good enough reason to change this. 

Plus this is ignoring my whole reason to own bitcoin. I am owning bitcoin because of the 1% chance that the USD collapses. It's 1% (in my head) every year...so over 30 years that adds up to being a decent chance. Transaction spam isn't ever going to make me worried about bitcoin like those bcash idiots.
Very well stated. BCash's scaling attempt will; in time, be shown to be FAR inferior to off chain scaling solutions. I am so happy that we have separate chains now. 



Software/computer science > ???? bigger blocks ???? 
pretty good read, until like you said about the other coin shilling haha. 
It's been months 
all these projects are going to take attention away from cryptocurrency and shift the attention to blockchain tech with funding coming from more traditional investment systems.  
If there's anything we learnt, it's that the public has a very short memory.

If price of BTC starts to go up, it's a no-brainer that FOMO will again set in and push the price up higher.

Whether the price is justifiable or not becomes moot because that is how the market behaves.  And it's not just cryptos - take a look at the P/E of some of the Tech stocks.  Netflix's price doubled this year and is still climbing despite having a P/E of over 260!!!
2 girls 1 cup is too scatological and it's not hot enough for anyone who likes porn, I recommend something else in the pornoleech category. Pornohub accepts other crypto now too.
I agree, no way 8% of Americans own crypto, but it was 8% of those surveyed. There were 1000 people surveyed in America, small sample, questionable results, but an indicator nonetheless.

Michael, what you feel is never important.  You also "felt" you had to HODL back in January 2018.  Good traders never believe that they are right.  They look for signs of what the market is telling them.  There's enough chance for error in just attempting to do that.  It requires lots of experience.  The blow-out December top 
(I believe I counted 7 stacked flags on the graph) with its massive trading volume was a screaming top to anyone who has ever traded stocks.  Regardless of the later stellar growth potential for any such stock, you must step aside at such a moment.  If BTC ever sees the likes of that again, remember your experience and don't get greedy, take some of your winnings off the table, and wait to see what happens.  If you had done so back then (waiting to see a new break-out from the lofty price) you probably would have re-entered the gamble at a much lower buy point.  BTC trades just like a stock. It advances and declines on a mix of fear and greed, and the footprints of trading volume (demand).  So don't just dream on the future of a technology, or what might be in store for BTC's adaptation in the future.  Own and trade your coins for today.  Don't ever "believe" in any investment as religion.
Next time, take your capital and some profit off the table.

It will feel better as well knowing that everything left in it is PURE PROFIT.
Michael, I replied to you in the comment chain.  Good luck.

Nah, plenty of down still to go. Enjoy!
In this case, it just means three previous turn-up points in trading.  These are points where the price "briefly" found support before it rose higher. These points will probably be retested before there is enough buyer confidence for an upward price advance in volume.  Many times a short-term price-low will be tested several times to see if it will break through to a lower low.  If it holds support, the price eventually gathers enough buyer confidence to move higher (all other fundamentals remaining stable).  

A "floor" is formed by a relatively tight trading-range, extending over some period of time, sometimes as a sideways price movement, sometimes as a consolidation bowl, etc.  This eventually builds buyer confidence until the price can break-out to a new post-consolidation high or an ATH.  After the price breaks out to new highs, it will often slowly settle back to test the top of the previous consolidation range (the price breakout point).  If the price holds, at or above this "floor", it can then continue the confirmed rise with increasingly confident traders.  But if the price breaks through the floor, as it settles back to the top of the previous consolidation, then selling will increase and plunge the price back into the previous consolidation range, or even lower.  When this happens the previous "floor" becomes "a ceiling", as the trading price must fight to get back up and through the resistance it now represents.  This pressure is often caused by the action of sellers trapped above the price offer, who sell into all attempt rallies as the price reaches their bail-out points. It takes time to eat through all this overhead supply of desperate sellers and restore price confidence.  The BTC price chart would indicate that a tremendous amount of overhead supply must exist, as not everyone caught above the current price is a HODLer.

Where are you Confucius ?
In the U.S, and using the link below as my reference, if you hold your assets for a year, you get better tax incentives in terms of what bracket you're in. Say you bought your assets at $10,000 and it increased to $50,000 by the same time next year, you'll ~~be taxed~~ only pay taxes on $11,400 ($50,000 - $38600), meaning ~$1170.

Versus normal tax rates where you'd pay ~$6912: $925 (10% bracket) + $3501 (12% bracket) + $2486 (22% bracket), in addition to the marginal taxes paid per transaction.

Selling that EBT for 50 cents on the satoshi?
no one in the world is "stuck holding". There's only how much of an L you're willing to take. You can get off the roller coaster any moment you like bro
Trx went from 300 to 1100 sats = gains
i'm fairly young and not in poverty tho, even though I held some crypto through the crash that's dropped ~90%

Feel free to use these commas and full stops bruh. 
True but they would be back to just test the water with btc. Fomo is real, especially with money
Bitcoin does well, everything jumps. Bitcoin is already in a decline. If btc drops everything drops ten folds. May a well drain them, clean up. Also july has been a low month for btc over the years.
I second this 
So yesterday you made a call for something to happen in July.  And today you are successfully calling it again, even tho it hasn't happened yet.  OK, I think I get it now :) 
Which year?
Wiped out a lot of longs, but haven't watched the shorts lose money -- sometimes they may have ended up paying some interest carry a few days or weeks longer than they wanted to, but that's just a small blip against their profits. For the shorts to start losing, the entire direction of the market would have to go up and stay up for a considerable time to where they would have to close out their positions with losses.
Well, we already have >1MB blocks due to segwit.  Also, LN is great but it still has on-chain transactions to open and close channels, which means we'll run into a transaction bottleneck again at some point (assuming greater adoption).  Further scaling solutions will have to be pursued, but I think we'll get there by continuing to develop creative solutions, not by centralizing and brute forcing it.
The dollar doesn't need to collapse for BTC to soar :)


26 percent chance of that happening in the nest 30 years if truly 1 percent. Not really a decent chance. 
What precisely do you mean by "USD collapses"?
If the USD collapses bitcoins are not going to save you. 
Yeah.  

Bcash's solution is a lazy one - driven more by one man's contempt and frustration, than by any technological innovation.

I do think, though, that had BTC increased the blocksize a bit to head this off, whilst working on LN, it might have been avoided.

But I can also appreciate the purist arguments behind BTC's collective decision.

There seems little intellectual or philosophical purity behind Bcash's attempts to patch, whilst misleading and destroying.

Bcash will fall between two stools - neither fast, nor - more importantly - ever trusted.
Well, ETFs are investments into the cryptocurrencies, not into the tech, and LN is an example of usage/application of btc

Supposedly they’re not selling until 2019 I heard 
well said
Good advice, thanks! 
For sure, if i'm ever blessed to get back to that point. Go Pundi X! lol
Is there a Coinbase pro APP for mobile devices? Or is it just a Coinbase app. 
Do I have to use web browser for Coinbase pro?
Double checked a couple times, definitely using the right key, is that key specific to electrum?
Investing in “bitcoin” to be specific.

you pay no tax if you buy at 10k and sell at 5k. 
That sucks...
nty, rather just keep w/e i dont need in a "safe" coin and not tell the government what amount i cash out and dodge taxes instead
Or buy using BTC and rise your middle finger to taxes.
Well I’m still holding and staying in but one thing I am doing is keeping my money in usd on Coinbase until this market calms down so your right 
Hahahaha
Let's hope so, because daddy needs a lambo
Lol yes
This year 
Is that not the equivalent chance of flipping heads twice in a row? That's not that implausible at all
i mean there are tons of nightmare scenarios that can play out but most revolve around foreign demand of tbills drying up and tons of  dollars coming back into the US economy to buy 'real' assets like real estate resulting in highly inflated prices across the board

Capitalism! Better friend than foe.
Cool.
oooh, look at the rebel trying to get locked up for tax evasion. it didn't work for capone, it won't work for you.
Correct. But you can try to flip heads twice thousands of times per day to try and get it. Here it takes 30 years for only a 26 percent chance. Far from impossible but I wouldn't call it a decent chance 
yep, rather dodge taxes instead of paying them haha
That's fair. To me it's like getting volcano or flood insurance. You hope you don't need it. a 26% chance is decent enough (for me) to take some steps to mitigate the risk, that's all I'm saying.
