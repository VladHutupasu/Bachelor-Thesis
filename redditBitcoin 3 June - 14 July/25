Amsterdam Airport Schiphol installs Bitcoin ATM as part of a six-month pilot.

In statement: "With the Bitcoin ATM we hope to serve travelers by letting them easily exchange 'local' euros for 'global' bitcoin or ether."

I am feeling positive, who's with me?
How often do you check the bitcoin price in a day?

I only check first thing in the morning, last thing at night, and about 50 times in between. 
Tether news, while not really news in the first place,  should put a sock in the Tether FUD that has plagued us for months.

Also in the interest of transparency, I was banned for 7 days for joking about a potential 6k suicide pact during the most recent crash. In my absence I did some soul-searching. I learned yoga, went on a vision quest in the desert, and tried mushrooms for the first time (not the magic ones). 

I just want to say I am truly sorry. I am aware that the moderators in no way overreacted and that joking about suicide is never OK, because someone out there may have been teetering on the edge, and hearing such a suggestion from someone with such massive influence and clout here may have convinced them to finally do it. I will try to be better.

The fact that bitcoin has basically shrugged off the SK exchange thing is a good omen. 
Who is looking into these satoshi from the future conspiracy’s right now 
member when everyone was complaining about being stuck in 8k? I member 
What's with all the support for Tether? 

Bitcoin is sound money, Tether is "let's trust this institution" all over again, why the hell are so many supporting this trash?

Plus, the existence of Tether reduces the importance of Bitcoin for exchange trading.

Seriously, why would a Bitcoiner that is here for the values and not only for profit care about Tether? 
Tmr will be another day
Looks like a whale battle going on right now.
Looks like a green middle finger. 
Love the tether news

World Wealth Report 2018: Young Millionaires Interested in Investing in Cryptocurrencies

[https://cointelegraph.com/news/world-wealth-report-2018-young-millionaires-interested-in-investing-in-cryptocurrencies](https://cointelegraph.com/news/world-wealth-report-2018-young-millionaires-interested-in-investing-in-cryptocurrencies)

This administration loves bitcoin. They didn’t classify bitcoin as a security and tried to not play favoritism so they included Ethereum in their judgement to not to regulate. 
Hate all you want. If you have hard earned money in bitcoin, we need these next 2 years to hold off regulation and build before the ones who love To regulate everything come to power. 
Or another country to take the lead but everyone follows the USA on what to do. 
Japanese embassy working with state department to charge Ver finally. 
Bcash is gone soon. No need for it. It made a few people rich and added confusion to a confusing market. He’s their leader and said he hates America. That’s fine but you can’t break their laws with bait and switch. 
Newbie here with IT knowledge: I still have my stuff on the broker. I'm looking for wallets but can't make up my mind.

I always tend to use official software, that's why I downloaded biotcoin core, but i'm looking into lightweight wallets that don't need to download the whole blockchain... can anyone recommend me easy to use, safe and maintained software lightweight wallets?

Currently testing electrum and doesn't seem bad.

Thanks!
I got banned from buttcoin and I thought this sub is bad at censorship...

Is this for real? I don't see anything in the news about "institutions".

I still have a big doubt about the tether. Now according to tether, these 2.5 Billion USD are in a bank account. Which means bank is using these cash for their business operations such as lending. And from the other side, people are using tether to buy cryptocurrency. So basically the same 1 USD has been used twice in fiat form and in crypto form. Tether should have the USD not in a bank but in a safe. Tether cannot invest this money not in a bank account not in anywhere. It should be in a safe where no one can access it as it's already being circulated as tether. 
Another day, another bart simpson 
The first months of the year were tough, but finally we did it! Congratulation guys! 
The tx fees for Bitcoin spiked at 2pm today, anyone have any information on this? Was paying 1 sat/b yesterday and now it's 44 sat/b.
Guess what guys Bitcoin is dead no 7k I can charge lime scooters at my house and make more money using that energy than Bitcoin mining cost 
Why the fuck is everyone buying in the tether ""audit""? The disclaimer literally says it's not an audit
This morning's chart looks like a pretty typical bear flag. Slight retrace, not like the sideways price on a reverse Bart.
Sell now and buy back at the next 6.5 k
Tired of nobody answering - who is a good source to follow for predictions? With a reputation, and conservative, realistic ideas about what crypto market cap might be in 5, 10 years etc.

I only see random numbers tossed around and it’s impossible to google this without pages and pages of spammy ad-fueled sites.

Any talk about price prediction becomes the next edgiest redditor jumping to comment “and I say it’s worth elephant butt!!! Your stuipd!! And it gets nobody anywhere, so can we just have a normal conversation about it

Hey fellas.  Just found out about this cool visual bitcoin blockchan website: [http://visualblockchain.org/](http://visualblockchain.org/)

 can someone do a ELI5 on what exactly I'm looking at?
Can you fix the link it says paige not found
Yea, not working.
Yes this is really smart. I have about 30 euros left from my last trip. Since it's difficult to exchange foreign cash money to Bitcoin in your country of residence, I'd have used the ATM despite the relatively high fees.
These are the sort of examples of adaption that we need more of, thanks for posting.
I'm feeling negative, so I'm now glued to you.
Is that all?
I have a news ticker in the bathroom.
Earlier this year when prices were still extremely volatile, I was checking price a few times an hour.  Now that things have settled down and I've built up my portfolio, I only check in the morning and the evening. 
" tried mushrooms for the first time (not the magic ones)." ROTFL 
> Tether news, while not really news in the first place, should put a sock in the Tether FUD that has plagued us for months.

HAHAHAHAHAHA. Tether FUD comes from FOMO and bitterness, it's not going away just because of this news. It'll find a way to survive, just like cockroaches do
IMO one should never joke about suicide.  I don't think even irony is suitable.
Small fish in a grand scheme of things. Shit will hit the fan if( or when) Coinbase is compromised.
Links?  I'd love to read these.
Nah hook me a link so I can have a gander.
Yeah it’s super interesting but I still don’t fully understand it.

A could just be coincidence

B a government supercomputer is mining BTC

C somebody knows how to manipulate SHA256 and it’s flawed

The good old days
It's not so much support for Tether as it is blowback for the years of Tether FUD.  There have been people hammering us with things like "Tether is not backed" for years with no proof.  Now we have some proof it is backed and people are coming out of the woodwork to talk it down.  It's almost like there is a coordinated campaign to tarnish Tether so people won't choose it when there is another option.

More talks tomorrow at 2520 Massachusetts Avenue NW, Washington, D.C.,   Japan is just as pissed off as all the newbies and older people who Ver scammed. They want to jail him after Americans get their money back and ban him from the market in japan and USA. 

Never underestimate the value of writing your representatives. We get stuck reading them and relaying to them what the public is upset about but these senators rely on these letters. They work for votes. Older grandparents tried to buy bitcoin for their grandchildren for Xmas is the theme. And the older generation contributes to campaigns and vote. 
I use a Ledger Nano S.

if your HODL stack isn't a large sum, you can go the Electrum way. Just be sure to get the .org version not the .com version wich is a scam.
Ledger Nano has always been good!

Why would you download the entire blockchain?  This is handled elsewhere.  I don't need the entire structure of Visa to use my debit card :)

Just use a trusted wallet.  

I use a Trezor now, but the one at Blockchain.info did me fine for years.  - and there was a significant amount of money in there.

As other users have noted, moderators routinely remove uncited pump-and-dump crap, as well as vapid price commentary.
Well, we'd be happy to read it here (and dismiss it as noise) on this chatty sub.

But its removal as a post on r/bitcoin - well why not?

It said virtually nothing.  

I've had posts removed, because they were, frankly, rubbish!  As was yours :)

p.s.  I was instabanned on the allegedly 'never censored' r / btc simply because of my - deliberately provocative - name.

I think the mods here do a fine job.  They would also over on r / BTC if Roger allowed them to ... there are some interesting stories there ..
Maybe this is related: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8slm3x/goldman_sachs_is_considering_crypto_trades_beyond/
Who here actually uses Tether?  I've yet to see an article or quote of somebody that uses it.  Im not saying nobody uses it, more like it'd be great to get feedback/opinion from ppl that use it
Do you understand how fractional reserves work?

There’s not a dollar bill available for every dollar in every persons bank account. Some money is literally just a number on a computer.

And if the government is feeling a bit stretched they can just print some more out of thin air.

But Tether is the big issue here.
Aren't you worried that when you buy some #AAPL shares for $ (or an iPhone), your dollars are circulating twice in economy, once in form of shares/iPhone, second in dollars? (And you can sell that iPhone, right, so it can be turned into dollars again!)
I agree. It would be like the USD being pegged to gold. Lock up all the gold in Fort Knox. Tether needs a Fort Knox for USD.
Shouldn’t we wait to break 10k again first before throwing a wild orgy?
Interesting, please update us if you hear anything.
My guess is that it was related to the Bithump hack and subsequent re-organisation of wallets by Bithump. 

1 sat/byte transactions are now clearing, yet people are still sending in transactions with huge fees, perhaps the automatic fee calculation of some wallets hasn't re-adjusted post peak.
You can suck dick and make more cash. You should go back to that instead.
Are you going to fuck off when we hit 7k again?
There is more evidence that Tether is backed than there is that it isn't.
Blablabla, or maybe an pretty big exchange lost some coins?
Sell now and buy back at 12k
I hate this but it’s trendy 
Nobody.
Well first off don’t come off as a butthole and maybe you’ll get a answer. Here’s my honest answer NOBODY it’s a gamble either way you look at it you want to make some quick money follow macfees twitter and buy any shit coin he promotes.
I think Tim Draper’s prediction of 250k bitcoin by 2022 is probably going to come true.

Coin mastery and themoon are imo the better ones. Then theres twats like sunny decree that are funny to watch from time to time. Just dont take anything he says to serious.

Edit: and tone vays if you want to lose money fast


(All youtubers btw)
My predictions are always based on real data, and technical analysis. I've been warning people about Bitcoin not going to just bounce up so soon after a crash and while it's in a bear market. The volume and interest is also really low, so tamper expectations for a while. At the same time, it's unlikely to go below $5.5k, and maybe not even $6k. The $6K bottom has been tested multiple times. A lot of people have been waiting at around $5k, and even $4k to buy in. But they're gonna start losing hope that it will ever get there. This is potentially the last big dip. We may go just a little lower, before we start seeing a steady incline. There's gonna be at least a couple of peaks in that incline, with small dips, before we go back to FOMO and a big bull run to around $30K. Then as always, ecstatic stellar rises are followed by a bubble burst.  Rinse and repeat.
nobody fucking knows... one thing i know for sure, it will be useless as it is right now

Dude, there's a very wide chasm between people who believes it's going to be worth millions because it will replace every existing fiat and people who believes this is just a digital token currently in a bubble.

You will get no consensus and most literature out there will be presenting either side of this wide gap.  Check out Tom Lee's and Warren Buffett's view on this. 
It’s bithumb, stop trying to be funny. It seems like the only winners in crypto today are hackers. $30 million hack is quite a win.
Zoom out.

I hope soon. Bisq will take over when that happens 
My work has a lot of stuff I read about it blocked so I cant link anything right not, but basically look up the 21e800 hash. yesterday a Hash was mined starting with 8 zeros and followed with 21e8 aka 21 million, or the total supply of BTC, this is significant because the probability of a hash starting with 8 zeros is astronomically low. like 1 in a trillion chance. the only computing power that could possibly produce this hash would be quantum. another interesting thing is that the Genesis block that satoshi created himself started with 8 zeros and has never happened again, until yesterday. only explanations so far are that someone got astronomically lucky, satoshi is a time traveler, somehow quantum computing has been unlocked, or the SHA-256 algo has been broken. also interesting that this happened the day Trump announced the Space Force. just some interesting stuff to keep us busy while the markets get going again :)
>It's almost like there is a coordinated campaign to tarnish Tether so people won't choose it when there is another option.

People _shouldn't_ chose it. Use Bitcoin, not Fiat 2.0 "Tether must and does at all times reserve the right to refuse to issue or redeem Tether Tokens" USDT. It's fucking ridiculous.

Regulated Crypto Custody Is (Almost) Here. It’s a Game Changer

It has the second-highest trading volume of all cryptos except BTC, so clearly people out there use it.  But I sell my BTC on GDAX and hold the fiat until I re-buy, so I have no need for Tether.    
A lot of people use it to anonymize bitcoin. 
What do you think day traders use? 
Shares are backed by the net assets of the company. 
Iphone is a physical product. 
Neither of these work as currencies. Their value is determined by market demand and supply. 

USDT has no value. It's not backed by government nor is it issued by government. Only value USDT has is from the fact that it being backed by fiat USD. USDT will equal to USD1 as long as an actual $1USD fiat is available to back it. If they are using this backed money to invest in a bank, 

1. Someone purchases bitcoin or other cryptocurrency with the USDT that claims to have backed by fiat $1USD. 

2. Tether invest the Fiat USD in bank which is again circulated in the economy by operations of bank. 

So basically, the same $1USD is circulated in the crypto market and in the banking system. This is extremely chaotic. In my opinion, tether should have the equivalent amount of fiat money stored in an inaccessible vault. If any fiat to be withdrawn from such vault, the same amount of tether should be burnt. Otherwise tether should cease to exist and all exchanges should implement Fiat deposits and withdrawals with compliance to KYC. 


Do we need an excuse for a wild orgy?
The pattern looks very promising for me, but of course, you could be right. As compromise I suggest to undress slowly, then we're prepared for the case of 10K
Why would they half ass an audit if everything is on the up and up? 
There isn't any evidence that Tether is backed. 0 is not greater than 0

And doing fake audits is a big red flag that they are NOT backed
It's effect on the market has been quite minimal. It's not like other exchanges relied on those coins.
Why would that affect other exchanges?

Dude, if Coinbase is busted, it'll be another Mt.Gox all over again. BTC and the other tokens trading on Coinbase will go down in flame and all cryptos with it. I don't think crypto will come back from such a disaster.

I'm hopefull that the level of security/insurance is at another level these days though. But we should not wish for Coinbase to go bust ala Mt.Gox because crypto will no recover from it or will take years.

A hack from a reasonnable amount Coinbase would have the liquidity or be insured to bite the bullet would not affect the market as long as users are not impacted and can get away with their money or crypto. But if Coinbase isn't solvent anymore and users are parted from their money/crypto, then it'll be hell when you see the volume of money/crypto Coinbase is dealing with. And I'm not talking about the daily volume, but the total volume that Coinbase is holding at any given time (just look at the freaking order book in Fiat and Crypto, there is an ungodly amount of money on Coinbase).
Nice, I love it!  Can't wait to dive in.
Need some evidence of somebody who uses it and their opinion.  Haven't been able to find anybody
Do you use it?  I'm looking for someone to admit using it
have you used it?  Im looking for someone to admit they use it
> Shares are backed by the net assets of the company.
As are Tethers. At least it's what they claim. 

Everything you say can be applied to any product and any cryptocurrency. That does not automatically mean everything is OK with Tether, it's just that you argument that USDs are used twice in economy is not valid. 

Depends on your taste. I hear there are way hotter chicks on the moon 🌝 
Fair enough 👍
Quite minimal, the 'bear flag' you mentioned earlier was the result of that hack. The second they announced the hack the market had a (small) drop. Trying to TA it makes no sense.
That a legit question?..

So I bought my BTC through Coinbase. (Maybe it was my naivety when trying to find the simplest way to get some BTC).


I moved said BTC to my electrum wallet.


Made some purchases (that's what this currency is for no?) 


I have some small change left in my wallet. Was thinking about moving it back to my bank account, which I would of gone back to Coinbase to exchange to my currency and send it to my general account. 


I am reading (here mostly) a lot of anger and/or distrust towards Coinbase. 


If and when i decide to move some money back would you recommend another service or to continue with Coinbase?

Just curious for opinions. 
Not your keys not your coins. Bitcoin will recover and lessons will be learned. Centralized exchanges should go away. 
lot of good (interesting) stuff on twitter that some guys have came up with. 
Tether is not a product though. It's just a coin created by a company to be used as the USD to buy cryptocurrency. If the actual USD fiat that backs tether is used for investing in another source, then tether is not really backed by it. Tether simply becomes fake money. 
I think you're suffering from a case of confirmation bias. If the market were concerned about it, the drop would have been considerably larger. The volume on the drop wasn't even especially high for a typical trading day recently.
Yes
His neutrality didn't affect me at all. 
" Come on, dude. Who hasn't exchanged $23,000 in a bathroom with two Romanians before. This is totally normal."

I don't see any point in cashing out your leftover small BTC change. I'd let it ride. You might even decide later to add to it. 
Indeed, that's why you should send your coin out of the exchange if you're not trading them.

Exchange for trading, HW wallet for HODLing.

I'll see how Decentralized exchange are fairing, but I'll be using Coinbase for the moment if I ever have to off-ramp my coins to fiat.
'The market', what are you on about? It's not one entity. Plenty of people got scared and sold. Just look at the timeframes. Not my problem you can't put 1 and 1 together.
The more I read about BTC et al the more stories like this pop up. 
Are these people for real? 
That story was awfull, just use a trusted exchange and pay your taxes ;-)

Depend how small is the small change, just keep it on the blockchain if it amount to not much, do you really need that small change badly?

But if you already are setup with Coinbase, that'll be good to off-ramp to fiat if you need to.
Then why was the volume on the drop so low? There are numerous examples of pumps and dumps over the last few weeks that have had higher volume. When panic selling happens, it's normally an avalanche. Once again, you're looking at a drop happening at the same time as the news and assuming that the news was the primary cause of the drop. If anything it was probably what pushed evenly-poised price action over the edge.
