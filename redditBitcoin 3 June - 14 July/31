Should I buy or should I go.
If I sell it will be troublleeeeee.
But if I buy it will be double
Last nights's pump has OK volume, but still way less than the volume of recent dumps. It seems to be people closing their shorts more than anything else.
Another day, another red middle finger. Sigh.
A passing thought:

I'm not convinced by all the whale arguments.  Shitcoins and a foolish young market are mostly to blame.

I guarantee that what is happening right now during this minor (but very welcome) green, is folks thinking - 'BTC has gone up, but look at the price of TittyXCoin, it's soaring!  I'll put some into that.'

So they skim some of their BTC into another worthless shitcoin, and the BTC price declines due to sales.

This is why I just sit back, and wait for all these shitcoins to die off naturally.

(and that includes you Roger - but you're smart, and it may take some time for people to wise up.)

#Go Bitcoin!
Strong support at 6000 Zimbabwean dollars...
Good morning friends
https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%203-m&q=bitcoin

Why did bitcoin spike on Google trends recently? 
#FEEL THE PUMP
Bought in around 6.2k, been stalking prices since. Lets hope for a big rise
bull run?

Beginner  questions:

1- As I understand mining a block takes roughly 10 minutes, yet when I do a transaction, I get confirmations in couple of seconds and It’s safe to spend it. How is that possible?

2- I understand (I guess) the aspect of public ledger, but what stops a node from including a false transaction (from A to B) and  getting lucky by solving that block before the others, wouldn’t this get actually broadcasted to other nodes as solved block and registered in blockchain even if it had false data? Or does transactions gets broadcasted to all nodes (before solving the block) as shared memory pool, so they “vote” on the validity of the content too?

3- I read that we can generate wallet keys offline, isn’t it possible that 2 wallets might end up with the same random keys?
Bitcoin Futures contracts have been behind most of this, not some conspiracy of a room full of whales dressed in black. And yes, Bitcoin is the future, that is all.
June 6th finally came!
people on this subreddit have literally no idea whats going on do they. 
still checking btc to fiat balance is pretty painful considering it was almost 10k like a month ago

huzzah for +5% and -30% xD
All those 0.001 transactions on GDAX start when we get an upswing, call me paranoid but that looked dodgy. 
There is something about that $6000 Low that this market likes...still havent broken that Low of Feb
Now we’re talking!  Keep it up bulls. Let’s take her back into the 7’s
Volume too low to break out. Watching patiently. 
Questions:

Do people on this subreddit realize how completely crazy and stupid most of the people in this subreddit come across at?  Good luck getting mainstream adoption when one of the more popular communities/website for BTC information has very little actual reasonable discussion.

Why is it that seemingly everyone is so focused on price manipulation by whales as the reason why the price has been coming down?  Although by nature, this currency is EASILY manipulated, the most likely reason for me seems to be the cold shoulder that the public has turned to BTC.  Back in December, everyone and their grandmas bought into BTC because they saw it's meteoric rise and equated it to fast and easy money.  Now that the idea of the easy money train is gone, I think the general public realizes that BTC is nowhere close to mass adoption, and in it's current form, will never be viable for anything resembling mass adoption.
Bulls are back boiz
I
#NOBODY SAY WHAT WE'RE HOPING FOR
$1000 has been sitting in my gdax and coinbase pending and waiting to be deposited for 6 days now. Fuck I hope it doesn't bounce back too quickly for me to buy at a good cheap price.
It's the climb
Seems like $6000 has crazy support, any chance it breaks or is this a clear indication of the bottom?
**Come On Bulls!** 
Daily Hopium:

Said four years ago to a guy who held 770 bitcoins who saw his 140k investment turn into many many millions since then. 

Notice the word “delusional” being used.  Sound familiar?  I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen nocoiners and fudsters using that word to proponents of the HODL strategy to this very day.  Stop fighting us noicoiners.  You are in a hopelessly wrong position. Join us. 


“z3r0d • 4y
You guys are delusional listening to this guy.”


https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/22qc1d/comment/cgpdfnn
Hey noicoiners and shorters!  I can smell your fear.  Why don’t you just join us?  

Buy some bitcoin. Preserve your fiat wealth in bitcoin before it loses 4/5 of its value in the next decade. 

The choice is yours.  
Everyone knows the whale will not crash Bitcoin below $6K. So $6K is the rock bottom.
#Bullish as Bovril
At the Lambo dealership.
Who said the road to 1 Satoshi = 1 cent will be easy?
Today it's my birthday and I would also let you know how badly the community of bitcoin are. Full of comic, no tech guy, like flat earth believer: You Are wrong. Have a good day. 
They just don’t want it to happen.  Manipulate. 
Ppl still buy. I know tons of ppl buying.  But it’s really strange to me that the charts are clockwork.  
So tether was responsible for the fake value of 2017’s bitcoin.
I sure hope some shorters got wrecked big time in this last run...
so, are we going to bounce to 8k or what?
Got in at 6.5 a couple days back looking forward to the long HODL! my plan is to just buy dips and let it stack up☝
November 2018, Bitcoin $4400 USD. Just like 2017 was Bitcoin’s year, 2018 is not the year for Bitcoin.

Is there any way to earn bitcoin passively? 

I'm kind of new and I only know two ways of getting bitcoin: Mining, which is really non profitable and good old buying in exchange of dollar/euro.

What are other ways?
Break that 6600
Coinbase app is wigging out trying to calculate my fiat value its changing so fast
Can we push price further down so i can finally go all in?
https://trade.kraken.com/markets/kraken/btc/eur/5m  
Dafuq happened there.
Tripple dip done. Next- 7300 then race to 10k again
Told you guys it was a bull trap not that there are many bulls left just more bulls morphing into bears. Rawr
Anyone else hoping for further drop so we can buy more and take power away from the whales/early adopters.

When moon lambo?

Nah but seriously, when do you guys think we will bounce back? 5900? 3800?

Paper on bitcoin-tether manipulation+Steve Banon loves Bitcoin FUD coincidence?
Concerning the report about tether manipulation. I believe the reality of the market is stronger than the belief that it is backed, why haven't we seen huge fluctuation on tether price if it is not actully backed?
One many positives unless you bought in during the manipulation, is that with the price lower, more people can enter the market and people can build the technology finally for 2nd layer. As long as they hold their own coins!! Coinbase will never tell them. Not your keys, not your coins. 

The low volume of bitcoin is giving us a chance to build but the low volume of hardware wallets shows that they still don’t get it. 
**Still rising.**

**The World's only true non-shitcoin** is undervalued, and the human race has wised up.
Until the volume is back, short every rally.
SELL!!!
**Come On Bulls, give us something to cheer for!**
Testing 6500ish for resistance. If it breaks trough 6000, it will probably end up somewhere between 2000-3000. 6000 is such a psychological level, that if broken, it will be a complete free fall. Might be a good time to look for shorts around 6500.

better untether before its to late!

Worldstar!
 I prefer to see a steady increase instead of a big green bar, this means there is no one entering the market, these are just whales reacting/manipulating, that's not sustainable growth

so you can say  the new rich whales destroyed a really promising and their own market because of greed, this is exactly how society works today, i thought bitcoin is something against that system

so everyone hope some big investors to enter the market but they are not interested in any idea or in any revolution, they are only interested in profits and many here got the same attitude but they didn't even notice
sometimes it is hard to predict, it is so fragile that it is almost impossible to predict.
First time?
Amazing move, I'll say the 6k barrier is a tough one to break.
I like the way you think
Well sir you may have just bought $25,000 worth of BTC. See you in six months.
Closing shorts raises price
the 6500 resistance is tough
Short it 
temporarily, it will be bullish again!
Seriously. Dumped ~200 bucks in 20 minutes. This market is fucked.  It’s almost too easy to short the Bart’s. 
Roger wants TXC!
Back at you
Mornin'! 
moon confirmed
Because it's value plummeted, doom and gloom, because someone at the office is loosing money buying it close to ATH?
Damn that's nice.  I've been dollar cost averaging for a year and my cost basis is $6900. You'll be very happy with that eventually.  
nice buy in price
lets hope for it. me too holding some of it.
1. It's not. Depending on your definition of "safe", it's not even safe to spend after one confirmation.

2. If a block contains an invalid transaction, it is not a valid block and so it is not in the blockchain, as far as every other (well-behaved) node is concerned. The node in your question would be hard-forking into a chain that only it is following.

3. Yes. It is also possible that I will get hit by a meteor while being hit by lightning in the middle of summer. I think the key collision is slightly less probable. OTOH, if the randomness generator used by the wallets suck, it can become a lot more probable (see Debian's OpenSSH bug)
I love to see actual bitcoin questions in this thread! 
1) That an unconfirmed transaction.

2) The protocol/consensus between the nodes won’t allow for a double spend. And yes the transaction are waiting in a pool to be inserted in the next block. It’s like the knapsack problem, the transactions that would yield the better profits for the pool solving the block will be chosen to be inserted in the next block. 

That’s also why a zero fee transaction could potentially be choosen from the mempool if another transaction with a higher fee takes it as an input.

3 I’m not sure it can be made entirely offline, but I guess you would be extremely lucky if it were possible
1- You can be lucky and have an almost instant confirmation, and by that I mean an actual confirmation. If you send your transaction right before a block is found, and the miner decides to include it in the block.  It takes on average 10 minutes, but not 10 minutes since you sent your transaction, 10 minutes since the last block. You could send your transaction at minute 9:30 and get it in the next block.  You will also see your transaction in block explorers before this happens. The transaction is in the mempool waiting to be added by a miner. Depending on the fee, they will add it in the next block or not.  

2- Nodes can include false transactions. But then if they're not valid, other nodes will ignore it and not distribute it. The miner would lose the mining reward, and that blockchain would be forgotten.

Miners can't add a transaction from YOUR address. So nobody can even try to do that. Miners just get transactions, validate them, and then put them in the block. If a transaction is not valid, they won't include it in the block. (or else they lose a lot of potential income). Nobody votes on the validity. It's either valid or invalid. If a transaction is seeing as valid by some nodes, then it will fork, and die.

Nodes validate transactions, just because it's in the blockchain doesn't mean that the nodes will accept it. My full node will validate all the transactions in the block, and not accept them if they're not valid.

3- It would take in the order of several times the age of the universe for there to be 2 equal keys if they are generated truly randomly. You actually don't confirm that nobody has that key when you generate a new address. Even if you're online. And if you do, then you're the luckiest son of a bitch ever. It's just not going to happen.
BALEEE DAT
Going all the way up 'til July ~~6th~~ 14th!
people *everywhere* have literally no idea whats going on
want to feel less pain? buy more!
You're paranoid.

Those are very likely arbitrage trading bots.

 
Yay, 7k, er :)
I think most level headed people tend not to comment as much as the crazy folks. The crazy irrational ones are always the loudest. 
Because this sub consist of mostly low education degenerate gamblers, working low wages jobs. It's literally all they have to hope for a better life. Search Youtube. You will find plenty of stories of people who've gone bust. Delivery drivers, construction workers etc. ''Investing'' in bitcoin, because ''they don't trust the banksters''. The irony is that the ''banksters'' can do their bankstering here unhindered. It's literally a free buffet to predatory minded finance specialists.
well bitcoin used to only be for hobbyists and grassroots runners who believed in anti-establishment, now it's mainly about the money and becoming 100% centralized and pumping "big bank" money into it...so...
[deleted]
We just are.

^edit: ^big_change
I said the same thing about T_D two years ago.  I still hate how immature and worshippy they are, but you can't completely dismiss such groups of people. 
Would not "whales" be the people that have the most bitcoin? Would not those same people be large miners? 

WHY THE FUCK WOULD MINERS WANT A LOWER PRICE FOR WHAT THEY MINE????
Sorry buddy but using words like crazy and stupid while being exceptionally ignorant really doesn't come across AS anything other than stupid.

The december runup was not fuelled by mass retail purchase. Everyone was talking about BTC but the vast majority could not figure out how to buy bitcoin. Those that did overwhelmed the exchanges ability to verify accounts. An insignificant portion managed to drop at most a tier 1 amount into BTC.

The nocoiners are getting scared 😱 
Won’t ever get tired of seeing this.

Socks individually coded and then immutably paired on the blockchain?
im hoping for a rally to 20k!
Dr Jordan Peterson for PM of Canada?
i think we might go to 7k and (hopefully not and I hope i'm wrong), come back down to 6k
We are seeing lower highs, every time it bounces off that support. There seems to be little appetite for it around the 10K region. Right now, looking at the chart. I don't feel FOMO at all. Looks like I have all the time in the world. Seeing as the hype buyers have been loosing money for some time now, you gotta wonder when their patience runs out.
Doubt it. There was a rally of more than 1K and the traders shorted the shit out of it. 

This is now a very unstable market. It now seems that every time there's a rally, the pro's will short it and take the profit home, because if they don't short it, some other trader will. 
What do you mean crazy support?  Clear indication?  If she goes below 6200, we may be looking at mid\-4000's in the near future.
Dude there is no volume.... It is going to keep dropping until there is a surge of volume... adding $500 in BTC to your portfolio does nothing.
There he is 
reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Good morning/day to ya. Hopefully today will better. 
here comes the Bull!

paging /u/z3r0d seems like you should have listened hahah
x2

the past week i have been doing research on the bitcoin forum and here in r/bitcoin with older topics. 

can you imagine how salty the no coiners who were around in the early days must feel watching it rocket off when they said $200 was overvalued? 
The word ''delusional'' is right. You act like bitcoin is the only game in town. It's not. 
[deleted]
Have we come up for a term that's the opposite of FUD???
Uve heard of interest right?
Let's talk after BTC breaks $7k. After that I'll put my $200 to good use
Why wait a decade when you can do it now! 
[deleted]
Bitcoin is fiat
Why fear when you can play both sides ? The direction is totally irrelevant. Why would my wealth loose 4/5 of it's value ? In a decade no less ?
You make an excellent point. Well said. 
of course they will protect their investment. I think it may increase but in a slow down manner.
[deleted]
- it always goes up when I'm here you know ..  :)
Black Aventador SV Roaster? :D
Where we are going we don't need cents! 
Happy Birthday.
tons of people buying very small amounts from fat traders who have tons of it.

The fatter these traders are, the more capable of manipulating the price they get.
There's no conclusive evidence on that whatsoever, just some causal links between the movements and printing of tether coinciding with a demand for BTC... 
Shitcoins behind most bad things: shitcoins are now getting shaken out.

Good for Bitcoin.
The market is still concerned about the the tether manipulation scandal.
Hopefully not for another week or 2 I’ve got some dips to buy but first I need my pay checks to arrive.
I can't see any reason for it to go up right now. Most first world economies are stable with inflation in check. Until that changes I think Bitcoin is going to suffer a gradual slow decline. But when the tables turn, Bitcoin might be considered a safe haven similar to gold.
Lol I don’t think it’s going below 5k ever
yea wtf is happening lol all the .001 buys/sells
You could pray for them...
[deleted]
You mean while you are asleep?

Theoretically you could mine BTC using an abacus.  That would be nice and relaxing.
Mining is Profitable. I've been doing it since february. Albeit until I did research in March and realised 4xGTX 660s was not the way to profit... it wasn't actually profitable. If you choose to mine, do research, buy yourself a power meter and the correct hardware. I don't get much from mining (especially not this shitty week), but I have managed to accumulate 45% of one months earnings from normal employment, in BTC. Nice to know I have the extra cushion if I was to lose my job!
You can lend it out if you're willing to take on exchange risk.
airdrops! Most are junk but there are some rare gems around
Redditor for 2 weeks - that’s very unlikely. Not with the current distrust of bitcoin.
But I need money to pay for school and life lol
once i said we will never see btc prices under 10k :)
Honest answer: last time we hit 6K in april we rebounded because it were A TON of buying orders at that price. I saw the same yesterday at 6,1K so MAYBE we're going to rebound already.

I really believe that there's people with a lot invested in crypto that just won't let the price sink below 6K for whatever reason they may have.

Also the new Aventador SVJ will be released towards the end of the year SOOOOOO....
I will be genuinely surprised if the price sits lower than 6.2k for any significant period of time
Bitcoin hashrate keeps rising.. what do you think ?
What makes you think there are regular people buying at Bitfinex? What makes you think it's people buying and selling and not just bots, doing their thing?
Don’t think this one will bart to be honest. Too predictable. 
Bannon.  And yes.
It's not that it has to be backed one-to-one to prevent large fluctuations, just that the market has to act as if it is so. Price action is based on perceived supply-and-demand every bit as much as it is on the real thing.
> why haven't we seen huge fluctuation on tether price if it is not actully backed?

Thats the part everyone is worried about obviously
People could have enter the market just as easily when it was at 19k how is now any different? You don't have to buy a whole coin.
I only have BTC on Coinbase. How do I move it somewhere else, and where would you recommend?
When hardware wallets start being sold in high volume, you’ll know that people are starting to understand. Never store coins online. Exchanges get hacked a lot. Buy a hardware wallet and never have to worry about the hacks, nor the government etc.... they are Truely  yours when only you have the keys. 

Coinbase kept every forked coin from bitcoin and sold them cause they owned your keys. That’s going to be a lawsuit down the road as more educated investors (next generation) starts using bitcoin. 
whales where now buying again>>>>>>>>

Looks like we have a scared shorter here. Remember it’s not too late to close your short. 
going going, going GGGG............ups....not yet! its diving again....

ha.ha. let us be bullish right now.
I think 5700-5800 is a more significant support, there'll probably be a strong bounce there. If it breaks, 2000-3000 would still be an excessive drop.
it broke through but now it's barting lol
Hey guys, I’m shorting at 6500, you should too so I can profit big time.
Do you go back on your posts and change all your charts to the current one? You've been calling 4k drop after every drop. 
If you think Bitcoin is going to $1k in 2019, have you put any money down to short it?  Also do you think if will be worth a lot more eventually, say $20k in 2022?
Uh oh.... Someone sold too early :( 

See kids, this is why you don't sell after reading FUD articles. Smart people buy on the fud articles and sell on the weekly highs. It pretty simple. 
[deleted]
Really?

Yes.
WTF are people like you on about ? Seriously ? What are these ideological rambles for ? Why would people be interested in any sort of revolution ? Are you 15 ?
Boring same post every fucking time lmao.
It's not real buying pressure, though. Once the price pumps up, those guys are just going to reload their shorts and the whole cycle starts again.
agree.......worth another wait....

I agree. RSI is so bad 
No-one knows what he wants.  When BTC plummets is he happy or sad?  The cognitive dissonance is truly frightening.
The searches never increased during the other two lows. I'm thinking something else is causing this.
Still is 
1. Sometimes block can be mined within a couple of seconds after you mined block. So you might have your first confirmation right after sending transaction. However, it's not too likely to happen every time. 
I Balee
I baleee I can fly ....touch da ~~skyii~~ moon pie
bots control the crypto landscape. you should have seen them active in december...good luck getting a trade through without buying upwards or having someone dump a huge amount of money to drive the price down...and that was 90% of altcoins lol
NO WE ARENT
I think you're spot on.  Every time I see some, "I'm doing all I can to help!  I can't invest any more this week!  YOU NEED TO BUY AND HOLDKDKDKDLD!"  or something to that effect, I can't help but feel their desperation because the sub-$1,000 they have "invested" is all the money they have.  
Damn, I got grammar policed.  You's is rights doe.
Your logic is atrocious.  If your argument is going to be whales own most of the coins and whales only want a higher price, then how do you explain the tanking of value?  Jesus.  You're part of the crazy and stupid I mentioned.
"majority could not figure out how"

Remind me why were expecting mass adaptation again?
Good
[deleted]
Noooo, don't jinx it!
HA GOTCHA!
We will see. It's a double edged sword for me in the super short term because I want these funds to deposit ASAP so I can buy in cheap but my mining profits have also been down the past week or so as well from the drop. 

Just hold off another day or 2, bulls.......
Difference being now the volume is 5-6x greater than it was at 7500, so support here is much stronger, making shorts a lot more risky.
Yup. \^

Yup that’s why this thread is great. It’s so instructive.   The same nocoiners that are here right now arguing with me (and other hodlers) will be filled with the same regret in a few years when they realize what a mistake they made.   Maybe I can save a few of them. 
The price 4 years ago vs now...wow
Troll better. 👎

Taking a stab at it:

BAT ?


B = Bravery
A = Assurance
T = Trust  

As bitcoin rises in value and more people move out of fiat into bitcoin, what  do you think will happen to the buying power of fiat as less people use it?  For a currency to retain its value it needs to be used. Good luck on getting interest then. 
I think many once they see the value of their fiat rapidly declining as cryptocurrency is burgeoning, will make the switch.  Those latecomers will be the ones buying the ath. Too bad. 
🤣  glad to be of service with my non-advice 
Same reply as above:

Everyone knows. 
Thanks 
A research paper is not a “casual link”
I wouldn't laugh about the price dropping below $5K, much less out loud.  Seems a sad and rather certain event.  No laughter, please
The idea that you're laughing out loud at it dropping another $1200 when it has already dropped 13k makes me lol.
yes you are correct. Mining is very profitable especially last november to december last year but I think right now the cost of investment over the amount you will mine is somewhat very small gains because of the cost of investment and the bill you will have with the power consumptions.
Well, you were wrong. :)
That just makes the bleed more painful you know?
Huge mining farms dumping the price to put competition out of the mining market and increase monopoly
All right but the volumes traded should point to an equilibrium, I'm not convinced that most the people believe it is backed. I think most of the people are 'not sure' which means it should not be so well priced.
And even if backed 100% I believe Tether should be priced above 1$ as it is a $ that can be moved without the hassle of real $ which is under strict control of the fed. So real back $, virtual and less permissioned than the real one should motivate people to pay a premium for 1 tether. Which is not the case, which points toward something strange.
another thing is the whales, controlling the market so they gain more........

Do you think instead of having the price of tether fluctuate, we make the one of the 'other asset' fluctuate.
In order to always have a 1 to 1 tether.
Get a Ledger Nano s, you can than transfer for free from GDAX
Depending on the amount you want to store. I started with Electrum ( electrum.org ), then when I was uncomfortable with a software solution (the private key can potentially be sent to a tirdh party by a Trojan) i bought a ledger Nano S cost me 100 euro but I feel safer. I sent the BTC from my electrum wallet to my ledger. Now I’m just afraid of loosing the ledger. I know they make a dual set for this reason but my savings aren’t worth that much security at the moment.

Only let coins on Coinbase if you want to trade them, anything else than your trading stack should be stored on a wallet you control the key of.
ledger nano s (hardware, most safe) or electrum (desktop app, pretty safe).
I’m new too. Electrum was insanely easy to setup
yea, they are not easily swayed by and emotions and market sentiment.
Probably related to the SEC announcement. There are many potential scenarios. 

One could be, "great! no regulation from the system! wee!!!!" temporary pump but then here it comes the realization that institutional money was watching closely and now they'll stay away. 
The main reason to close a short here is to get a better entry a few hundred higher, but he's probably just a broken hodler.
Why jesper ? We are past peak hype it seems. For something that has no real use and is owned only for the sake of speculation by the overwhelming majority, i would say 2000-3000 is generous, if the bottom falls out.
as the trend implies, it will! now its between 3000-4000

Paleolithic you do understand that absolutely no one in this subreddit is a significant player in the market. That's the job of hedgies and banker types.
Hows that short doing bruv?
No change, 4K still in the analysis after the dead-cat bounce.
You again?! ;)

Yes, my position is net short, and has been from 16,500 ever since my first article post here.

However, currently playing a bounce to 7,880-8,200 by July is my expectation.

No, do not believe in a return to 20,000 ever again.
Smart people sell on the weekly highs?  You realize that would mean theyre entirely guessing when they put their sell order in, right?
Realized thPugh 
The question is what are people like on about? Do you believe in getting rich with your 1k$ investment? 

In a world runned by making profits, I saw a possibility in bitcoin to break away from this, where people should be credited for their work, not for the role they are playing just for the money and making debt for luxuryshit

I bought some bitcoins so I can use them. As i saw this pumping market i sold them with good profit, everything else would be stupid

now you have the possibility to easily change fiat to bitcoin and use it for payment or to send money and the technology is getting better and more people will use it, but it won't be bitcoin in the future, because there are more efficient cryptocurrencies to do so, so there is no reason for a value like 100k, 50k, 20k

the thing I want to say, there must not be a revolution, but use bitcoin and other currencies for the thing they were invented for

or keep dreaming mr. investor
Until they get squeezed the fuck out
Until we have 2 days of back-to-back higher than day before green candles I don't think it makes sense to buy just yet.
I'm not opposed to arbitrage trading bots. They keep the prices close on all exchanges.
>  then how do you explain the tanking of value? Jesus. 

Logic is rock solid

Simply, People that own bitcoin are selling more than people are buying


My point was that people here say that whales are manipulating the price down. why the fuck would people that own and mine BTC manipulate the price of their asset to be worth less

Jesus

For some time it is, but that's just the bots doing their thing and selling to willing buyers which are found at the lower regions. To maintain a sustained bottom, the volume needs to keep rising, even if it is at a lower pace. What seems to be happening after these dips, is that the volume rises and then starts to go down slowly, until there are no more buyers... 

Bitcoin is also at a psychological region. Since the price has rocketed twice from this location, newbies will now suffer from the [hot-hand fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_hand), thinking that what has happened in the past, will have a greater probability of happening again.

But what trading strategies tell us is that if a chart outcome can be easily predicted, then it can also be easily exploited.

"For a currency to retain its value it needs to be used" Bitcoin. Lols.

Good point. while btc price is down, it is the best time to invest especially if you had the leverage to do it,It is the best the best investment as to compare putting your money in the bank although there is a risk but the point of gaining is better than any investment
Nothing is certain in crypto. 
You know nothing rhondo
Doesn't make any sense..
Isn’t the whole thing being 1-1 the point of tether ?
Most people aren't even aware that they're trading Tether, they just see a BTC/USD pairing and leave the liquidity as an an underlying mechanism they don't need to know about. The principle value of Tether is that when you trade Bitcoin against it as a proxy for fiat, no actual buy or sell orders are lodged in fiat, so its invisible to a fiat orderbook. As long as traders are unaware of willfully ignorant, they act as if Tether is backed one-to-one.

There's no point in changing Tether to another constant value if its price is not going to fluctuate noticeably. Setting it to the same as the dollar is convenient because it makes dollars and Tether interchangeable pricewise.
Thank you for that advice.
you will always have to take care of your private key which is 12 words for electrum and 24 words for the ledger nano s. there's no way around it.
Thank you :).
Merci beaucoup.
Thank you sir.
in this market, emotions should be remove because it will blind your reasoning and analytical ability in addressing this changes in the market especially it is very volatile market 
I wouldn't say that something which succesfully demonstrated a proof of concept of a decentralised ledger system (blockchain) is something that has "no real use". The fundamentals of Bitcoin are still sound and it is by far the most decentralised coin and least likely to fall to a 51% node attack. Unless some other cryptocurrency surpasses it, there will be people waiting until there is blood on the streets before buying (and by that I mean when even the hodlers are selling). And it would be astonishing if people weren't holding Bitcoin sheerly for speculative purposes, that's pretty much how proto-currencies developed before governments.
No real use /lol
Right, but those types absolutely depend on and manipulate the actions of the hive through astroturfing.  
I didn’t short. I was pointing out the obviousness of astroturfing.
dude, im new to the game and I can tell youre full of shit lol
Every drop since 1/12/18 after the bounce you say 4k
So you sold your Bitcoins for a good profit and now you are complaining about the exact same things you did!?  As The Americans would say, "Go figure!"
You are so incoherent you can not go one sentence without contradicting yourself. Finish school or go seek help. 

Look at the shorts chart for Bitfinex. It's nowhere near the level of shorts that were being placed before the squeeze in April.

Inb4 bitcoin jumps to 20k tomorrow, a few hours before my deposit clears 😂 I'd be so upset lmao 
but what if your bank gives you 5% compound interest safely?
It is a very well known technic called dumping, it forces competition out of the market
Yes indeed, But I understood that the private key (not the seed you are mentioning) of my electrum wallet was stored on the PC I’m using it (maybe encrypted I would hope) and the private key of my ledger is stored on my ledger and you only have 3 chances to find my PIN before the ledger resets. The thing is suposedly tamper proof so I guess the private key is safer on it than on an infected computer.

The seed (the 12 or 24 word you are mentioning) has to be stored on paper in a safe place and has to be copied by hand and not on a computer. The seed is a mnemonics used to recover the private key. That also I have some concerns (fire, theft, ...) how do you store your seed?
But blockchain has nothing to do with the value of bitcoin, or bitcoin itself. Bitcoin is just one application for blockchain technology. Bitcoin only has real value for shady dealings and it's really hard to determine how big that market is. Plus other cryptos can be used for that as well. Although understandably this is where size matters. Decentralisation in itself is pretty much irrelevant as long as the transaction continue to happen. I really can't see an investment thesis for bitcoin other than for example a crisis currency or illegal business currency. IMO the litmus test for bitcoin will be the next bigger recession. When money moves out of assets, will it also move out of bitcoin ? Or in to bitcoin like gold. That's the real test. Markets are moving into bubble territory, so right now it's impossible to say if the current price is justified or is it just froth. Since it's use cases are so limited, I suspect the latter.
How is it decentralized  when 4 miners in China control over 50&#37; of Bitcoin?
who manipulates the prices? The whales again?

He’s been full of shit for months yet he still keeps coming back.  Most likely an agenda driven fudster.   Can’t wait for us to eventually break 10k to shut him up.  After that he will probably be peddling 15k never again. 
...and I remain committed to that call: https://i.imgur.com/P4ASfTd.png
It depends on the intention

So I didn't buy them for profit, but for using them

If I didn't sell this would just be stupid, but I wouldn't care if the price would stay the same, or decrease a bit, because the sellers of products have to adapt the actual price nevertheless at the later moment, when it went to 20k, there were and still are more usage for fiat money and later I could easily again buy bitcoin, there is no need to keep them except you are speculating on the price to increase again and make profits
So you post without reading what you have posted?

Same answer: 

Think it over. 

As bitcoin rises in value and more people move out of fiat into bitcoin, what  do you think will happen to the buying power of fiat as less people use it?  For a currency to retain its value it needs to be used. Good luck on getting interest then. 
I think  this is huge if you had millions in the bank. but looking at this interest rate, banks cannot give that interest rate even for a year or even for a time deposits. Imagine if you loan a car with the bank they are only giving 5 to 6% profit from your loan. so how can they give the 5% interest while they have also their operating expenses to shoulder.
 
i made 2 sheets of paper with a looooong random (nonsense) text on it. then i put my 24 keywords between the text. for example the 11. word, the 22. word., the 33. word, the 44. word, the 55 ... and so on. this is just an example, be creative to create your own "code"! then i have a number. this number is IN MY HEAD ONLY. i feel pretty safe with this.  i keep one of the papers and also gave a copy of the text to one of my family members in case my house burns down (they dont know the "secret number"!). you just cant trust anybody in this case.... p.s.: an old office typewriter might be handy for this job. and triple check your creation before finally burning these 24 words on the very first paper for good ;)
>Bitcoin only has real value for shady dealings

Just... no
Blockchain has everything to do with the value of Bitcoin because its successful operation enables transaction ledgers without a third party to enforce trust. Other cryptos do not do this as effectively right now because they are all more centralised, which provides a de-facto third party to the ledger (even if their role is generally hands-off) and Bitcoin has by far the most tried-and-tested blockchain against malicious nodes. Both of these facts make other cryptocurrencies a riskier proposition, both against hackers and co-option by the developers, and a successor to Bitcoin will have to overcome both of these points.

Once again, your argument against Bitcoin as a viable currency rests on things that are typical features of a proto-currency. Bubbles are a necessary consequence of organic interest in something as a store of value. Its use case a means of exchange is limited by the opportunity cost of spending Bitcoin. You don't get to skip those stages of formation of a currency, unless its heavily centralised.
Because they can't disrupt the blockchain, prevent other people's transactions from going through or identify who you are (or at least after Scnorr signatures). Your conflating wealth inequality with centralisation, they are not the same thing.

Idk why anyone gives this dude the time of day. His analysis is invalidated. 

If you think BTC is going to 4K, I wanna see screens of 100x leverage or stfu. 
You sound like you're locked in a closet. Do you need help? 
Tes
ha.ha. is this real or just a memes?
these hard times
This is good, I was thinking about some permutation of my 24 word seed. I suppose that you are only using word from the BIPxxx dictionnary? Otherwise one could flag the words from a BIP dictionnary and crack your magic number.

Also, would it be possible to extract your magic number byt looking for equaly spaced words that would yield a 12/24 word seed with no duplicate? (I just read that you can have a duplicate in a seed so that's not an issue).

I also would like to make a procedure and segment it in a way that my heir can retrieve the original seed and use the BTC. But also that they can't do it untill I'm dead or a vegetable.
i think bitcoin was mostly only used in the dark web and other shady areas before it became mainstream...pretty sure outside of the pizza purchase, there weren't hardly any companies willing to touch bitcoin with a 10 foot pole in the early years...
Again you are talking about cryptocurrency. Currency being the key word here. There is no need for a cryptocurrency in any other capacity than crime or crisis. What can bitcoin do for my company that a regular currency and banking system can not do more efficiently ? 
According to you we should have been at 4K months ago and we did not.  Please stop with this nonsense. Instead, buy some bitcoin and join the movement.  This is about freedom. This is about mankind taking the next step forward in the evolution of money.  Don’t be on the wrong side of history. 
Invalidated? LMAO

i wasn't sure about the origin of the random words and finally did not use the bipxxx wordlist. just some random words from a textgenerator, i took this one: http://www.randomtextgenerator.com/ after all, if somebody stole my text he would need some good amount of time to crack the code, enough time for me to transfer my funds.
It can't be blocked by your bank, your key can't be frozen, it can't be manipulated by monetary policy, etc. etc. Why are you even here if you aren't at least aware of the concerns with fiat and banking systems that cryptocurrencies try to address?
At the end of each post, it states:

**"...indicative of price and structure, not time..."**

Will get to 4K eventually. Then to 1K by 2020 at current estimates.

*"...buy some bitcoin and join the movement. This is about freedom."* —You can't buy freedom.

Yes, you said 10k never again. We hit 10k on binance. Then you added “bitfinex” to fit your agenda. 
never
Why would it be blocked by my bank if I'm doing nothing illegal ? Why would I be worried about monetary policy ? Especially now that central banks are starting to tighten. Currencies are boring, barely move at all, bitcoins are penny stock level volatile compared to currencies. Why am I here ? Speculation and trying to understand what people need bitcoin for today. What's the point of holding on to something that is supposedly a currency ? You are not supposed to want to hold on to currency, why are people doing it ? Why are people thinking a deflationary currency is a good thing ? Why are people thinking governments and central banks would give up power over currency ? 

And I can't find good answers to these questions. It's either HODLMOONLAMBO type animal noises  (the burger flipping community I assume) and starry eyed libertarian idealism. I'm trying to find out how much of crypto is actually used for intended purpose and how much of the market is speculative money.
Oh yes you can.   Your reasoning is so flawed I’m afraid you may be beyond help. 
Tether? LOL newbie. Talk to me when BTC/USD hits 10k on the top 5 exchanges.

In principle, banks can block your transactions or freeze your account. There is no guarantee that whatever the law is now will continue to be the law in future (we see this with hate speech laws in Western nations that otherwise grant freedom of speech). For those who are not willing to take that risk, cryptocurrencies provide an alternative way of storing and spending money.

You should be concerned about monetary policy because governments can print fiat to leverage economic planning. This causes inflation, which has the side effect of devaluing your savings in the long run. Bitcoin may be deflationary in the here and now, but it is asymptotically stable, which means governments can't inflate it by issuing more of them.

Now as to holding onto currency - yes, hodling is stupid. Holding onto your coins through thick and thin deprives the market of the liquidity it needs to converge on a stable value (as well as exposing the hodler to far bigger losses than if he had sold at a loss and then bought back in at a fraction of the price): however, hodling was a necessary first stage in Bitcoin's existence as an item of novelty. Without it, nobody would have ascribed any appreciable value to it. Now Bitcoin is in the second stage, which is speculation. Speculation cannot be bypassed in an organic proto-currency because stable price levels can't be found without it. Once again, these are very normal features of a proto-currency.

Now governments and central banks won't give up power over fiat currency, or currency in general for that matter, but that's not a fair claim to have to defend. What matters is that governments and central banks will have to make concessions to cryptocurrencies, which limits their influence over their destiny to a lower degree. The development of the internet decentralised information. Governments didn't outright give up everything to the internet free of charge (like copyrighted music), but once again,the internet became big enough that governments had to play ball. That kind of leverage is exactly what we're seeing developing now.

The end goal is that crypto will next be used in daily transactions, but the price of everyday goods with be tethered to fiat (so if Bitcoin undergoes a ~5% fluctuation upwards with respect to the local fiat, the cost of a good will decrease by ~5% in Bitcoin, leaving the equivalent fiat price the same). Once that phase is over, everyday good and services would be priced using crypto as base units. That's the long term trajectory and it's a long way off happening, but the current market cycles are absolutely necessary for this to happen.
You also have some reading to do :)

Not sure what you're getting at with the inverse graph, but I'm neither bear nor bull.  

I have a small amount of btc that I bought back in 2016 @ 454, so even if we hit 1k, I'll still be green.  
So what about $9999.99 what does you anal list say
As I said, you're invalidated.  Better luck next time :)
