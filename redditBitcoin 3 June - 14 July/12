Daily Discussion, July 03, 2018 -- TITLE
I have a small online business and took on my first employee / assistant recently. I introduced him to, and pay him in bitcoin. Ask not what btc can do for you...
Positive vibes!

it's friday, friday, gotta get down on friday~

this song will cheer u guys up, rebecca black c:
Just to elaborate more on my shopping experience with Bitcoin yesterday:

&nbsp;

Last night I [bought greek food](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8vh6vf/daily_discussion_july_02_2018/e1pj2d5/?context=3&utm_content=context&utm_medium=message&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=frontpage) with bitcoin.   When I went to pick up my order, the cashier was confused why I used [menufy.com](https://menufy.com) instead of grubhub.  I used the moment to expound upon the virtues of bitcoin.  She had heard about bitcoin, but didn't know much about it or how it could be used to buy stuff.  She said she'd check it out.

&nbsp;

I was on a bit of a roll, and also ordered some outdoor furniture from overstock.com with bitcoin.  Only paid a $0.05 mining transaction fee  (similar for the greek food above).  Order was confirmed, no problems.  Waiting for my stuff to arrive.

&nbsp;

Overall, once you get used to funding and using a wallet, this stuff is not hard at all.Next step is we need to educate and convince the merchants to sell us stuff at a discount since they don't have to pay the expensive transaction fees that credit card companies charge.
/r/bitcoin is starting to remind me of /r/dogecoin after the joke died. 
Does anyone think blockchain tech is actually awful?

  
More expensive, slow, and there is no room for forgiveness.

Bitcoin (and currencies) need this verification, but for apps, people do not want to pay. We trust centralization. Heck, not even bitcoiners care that much, look at coinbase. 
Been on the sideline, saw bitcoin went from 2k to 20k then down to 5.8k

Is this a good time to start my entry?

My mom bought when bitcoin was 4k and I'm envious. 
How should I go about acquiring BitCoin?
I'm looking to buy around hundred dollar of Bitcoin. Would it be safe to do paper wallet put copy in three different location in a safe.  I what it for my kids in ten plus year. Would my kids have problem cash them in. Is there a better idea to store them.
I'll soon buy more bitcoin :D and maybe also some Unboxed. buy buy buy!
It’s July. 
Hmmm... Judging by the comments in here, it looks like this sub has received a new batch of trolls. Hi guys. 
To all of you who like to make predictions: Today bitcoin will \[.....\]\[1\]

\[1\] Fill in your prediction here.
China is nr.1 in google trends for "Nvidia" and "Blockchain", nr.2 for "Asic" and doesn't even make it to the 64 list of countries for "Bitcoin".  
Do I need to be a developer to run a lightning node at this point in the game? I could use a little help.. Currently running core full node and have all the hardware (Ras pi and spare laptop) plus a few sat's to throw into LN to help out. If my involvement will benefit the network, that is..
[deleted]
Agh.  No problem. 7 k by Friday 
I swear I've never slept so good since deleting Blockfolio..
**you ever wondered what’s the need for you to buy Bitcoin? Or wait, do you ever felt the need that you need to know more about what Bitcoin actually is? Are you sure you’re fully aware of how does Bitcoin work?**

[buy bitcoins](https://www.merrchant.com/daily/2/buy-bitcoin/)
It has remained above $6k for 8 months!

Maybe this is the new low bar :)

Will unbox be advertising on Facebook now that the cryptoban has been lifted?
Bitcoin manipulators fuck u. A year ago I began to be interested in bitcoin, because at that time I wanted to make some money on it. I'm an ordinary schoolboy at that time, from an average family. I accumulated and bought the first 0.3 satoshi at the rate of 3500. I went to trading courses for about 2-3 months. Then the market was easy and it was easy to make money. In December, when the rate jumped to 19,000, I was glad that I could earn about $ 7000 from that $ 1000. I made gifts to my parents and all my relatives. I felt I understand something in this market. But when he fell in the ferrel-March. All earnings merged. I began reading 24/7 about the market and for a month went into study. At the end of March, I started to deal with margin trading again, bought a couple of channel signals. The beginning of getting out of 0.2 bitcoins in 2 months I earned 0.5 from the top. But then because of the fucking manipulators. When the fake news began to appear, the fall began again. Part I paid for my university and just because of many reasons I left my parents. I spent part of the money on daily expenses. But he tried to minimize them because he believed that Bitcoin was the future. Here again this rate fell to 5700. And for 4 transactions I merged the whole dep. Now I need to pay for the university, for many extra lessons, because I'm going to China, for an apartment. But I do not have money even for food. I sold all my things, like a laptop, a watch. Parents do not want to help. I opened 3 deals in long and nothing happened, all because of the news. I do not understand how to continue to live stupidly and thoughts about suicide come more and more often. Fuck this fucking shit and fuck my life 
7k incoming?

When a fudster/nocoiner tells you this is the worst bubble/crash bitcoin has ever experienced.  Be sure to check with your friend, the truth 😉👍

&nbsp;

Notice the rise and falls of bitcoin in previous years. Particular in April and November of 2013. 
Moon scheduled for about now (Tuesday teatime.)

Edit: wrong timezone :)
We used to have to work and mine gold which costs a lot of money until people excepted it as a medium of exchange. It called Proof of work (POW). Bitcoin is decentralized and bringing back the PoW standard. 

Centralized banking has such a monopoly, they gave up the POW standard (Gold back dollars). 

No more. This generation has the highest IQ in history due to having a supercomputer in their hands and any question answered in a minute. No more fake recessions, or wars for the sake of elections. 

Humans are evolving exponentially and the 1% centralized banking trick is dead. Don’t invest in those stocks. Short them and you can make a killing. We made a few test shorts of bank linked stocks and bought bitcoin with the proceeds. We are going to short them massively. JP Morgan insiders said through darknet chat rooms that they are all invested in bitcoin and have to use Tor to communicate cause Jamie diamond threatened them if they supported crypto. They are pissed cause his daughter and family own crypto but he won’t let them. 

Short all banking. You can’t lose. It’s finally a dying industry. No 8-10 year old who isn’t allowed to open a bank account, is going to switch from bitcoin to banking’s inefficiency. A simple app they used their e tire life to a complicate banking system that tells them they can can’t spend money they earned freely on products they want. Makes no sense and these kids will be the smartest generation the world has ever seen. Banks are in fear and should be. The clock is ticking. A lot of people in the banking system are using Tor to communicate to short JP and buy more crypto. 
The baby boomers are dying off, the millennials are building the future and kids under 10 today are using this technology. 

It’s the way of evolution. But banks will fight bank so it’s going to have to be revolution. 
Back to $5k
Pumpy wumpy :)

Teatime in some more Western time zone.
The FOMO price increase didn’t last. Slowly bleeding out.

Will you pay him the same value per month, even if the currency devaluates or valuates, or will you increase/reduce his salary accordingly? 
I've bought in overstock plenty of times. I paid zero transaction fee. I used a credit card. Why would I ever want to switch to something that costs me more and involves more steps?
yeah might as well buy stuff with an inflationary currency. Of course most people here want bitcoin to be deflationary.  Would make a lot of sense to buy things with it then eh
I think Bitcoin is the best thing you can do with it.
I know we expect things to move fast in today's world, but blockchain is new and will see immense improvements via layering technologies and protocols, and a vast array of technology upgrades not even imagined yet.
Demand drives innovation and it requires time.
Transaction chains across multiple organisations that need a single ledger = Blockchain

Otherwise, databases will suffice and do a far more efficient job.
It's not awful, it's very cool, however yes I agree that it probably won't ever become mainstream, at least in its current form. It's not objectively better than fiat, there are pros and cons for each application.
Blockchain is awesome. Obviously once big software business start implementing it they won't use miners to keep it true, instead they would use PoS on their users periphirals(this way it makes it decentralized by having lots of nodes). Since it is used mostly internally, it wouldnt be too expensive to maintain.
[removed]
If you plan to hold long term and know what that really means then yes this is a good entry point.
Could drop to 2k from here, but could be the last time it’s ever below 7k.  Anybody who tells you differently is full of it.
It depends. Do you want to make money from it? If you going to spend only what you would spend in Las Vegas, then sure, it's fine, because it's a gamble, it can explode or go downhill.

Do you want to support the technology and the idea?  I think now days it would be btter to try to work/sell stuff for BTC instead of buying it.
If you need a Coinbase referral link shoot me a message (we'd both get $10 free).  I like the Cash app more tho.
Get yourself an account on coinbase.com, sign up, link your bank account, verify your identity and hey presto you'll be buying and selling in no time 
Coinbase/coinbase pro is easiest imo
Paper wallets are done. It’s not 2014 anymore. So many better storage methods. 
Just make sure you take every precaution when creating the wallets. Some websites are scams.
A paper wallet is the easiest and cheapest way. If you have a safety deposit box, keep a copy there. As long as your kids have the wallet address and private key, they'll have no problem accessing it. They could wait 50 years and still access it. And in 10 years, Bitcoin will have replaced fiat currency, so they won't even have to cash it in! They can buy a car or house with it.
If you're going to put it away for a few years I think a paper wallet would be the best choice. For larger amounts you should look into hardware wallets.
I wouldn't be so optimistic like you at the moment. Have you already checked their docs at least?
One month closer to the death of the bear 🐻 
No. Same people change opinions as red turns into green. 
Do what bitcoin always does…
Here comes the dump.
Google metrics for China are irrelevant since Google is blocked in China. 
And?
The Google trends thing is not a good indicator at this point because most people know what Bitcoin is already, and are more familiar with popular  exchanges. Last year there was a huge ramp up on searches as people were discovering what Bitcoin even was.
If a bull run of last year's escalation kicks in again, you'll see it in Google trends then as more people jump in.
Baidu...
Trust the chinese they exactly know what they do. They were on earth before us.

Because math does **not** follow the path of belief. 

Lol Tether, at 1.00065372, is a "strong buy"?
Bull season cannot begin until 6.8k is broken. 
lol
Most of the cryptos went up 25% in last hour, you missed the fun.
Fire your proofreader.
Is it a shitcoin?

If so, I hope it has been banned.
Long story short: you'd be better off if you were hodling instead of playing Wolf of Wallstreet.
So after a year you decided to live of crypto trading?
Suicide over few k's? You must be pretty young still. Once you get older its peanuts. You earn that back in few months.

And 1 more thing, everyone is a pro trader in a bull market.
Please don't talk like that, suicide is not the answer. Life is filled with hard times and challenges you just have to keep fighting and you will find success.
Well, looks like some tuition did get paid to the School of Valuable Real-Life Experience and Hard Knocks.
They won’t be able to manipulate forever. Eventually the masses will overcome 
So you want other people's money, but you don't want other people taking yours. Got it.
Shhhhhhh 
Past results do not guarantee future performance.
This generation might have the highest IQ but you most certainly didn't end up on the right hand side of the standard distribution.
Brilliant 😂

No way we hit $5k ever again


Bitcoin will kill the big banks and evil corporations and corrupt central governments. We all need to BUY MORE and #HODL. Whats important is the fact that 1 BTC will always be equal to 1 BTC
Your Mama!
Could be due to the US holiday tomorrow.
If it can't go higher, it will go lower...
no...lol...
If this is about The Matrix - I didn't understand that either.
Sorry bro I can only read English and Japanese =(
I pay him on a per task basis. I pay the USD equivalent for every project he completes
> Why would I ever want to switch to something that costs me more and involves more steps?

Don't forget price protection, free extended warranty, fraud protection, etc. Credit cards are superior to bitcoin in every way for consumers.
You didn't pay a transaction fee, but the merchant did. If the merchant did not have to pay that fee then they could sell you the product cheaper. 
> Why would I ever want to switch to something that costs me more and involves more steps?


Bitcoin is not a new credit card or PayPal, it's a replacement for *fiat currencies* that, due to lack of competition within their respective countries, have adopted a monetary policy of rampant money-printing. 


Just as Visa, Mastercard and PayPal allow you to convert between dollars, Euros, pesos and yuan, in a few years they'll also allow you to convert in and out of Bitcoin. 


It's 100% opt-in. If you're happy with your credit card and fiat currency because you prefer the existing system, or can't see the benefits of a borderless, permissionless, un-censorable, un-taxable, deflationary currency, by all means keep using them. 


"If you don't believe it or don't get it, I don't have the time to try to convince you, sorry."

  Satoshi 
By the way, in the short term, an extra nickel is a small price to pay to help increase awareness and adoption of bitcoin.  
There is hardly any demand for bitcoin outside of this sub lol
But if its internal, that removes the trust, and that was the entire purpose of paying the validators.

Blockchain makes no sense internally to a company. 
Internally?

Databases were invented decades ago.
Do you see it going back to 10k or even 20k in the long run? 
Working/selling stuff and buying bitcoin with the proceeds is "Buying it" , Unless you find someone willing to directly trade bitcoin for labour or your stuff.
Anonymously
Paper wallets are the most secure way to store bitcoin. You don't have to worry about some hardware or website getting hacked or compromised. It's hard to transact with, but if you're just holding onto it, what's the downside?
Or, in 50 years, the kids will open the vault and discover real the reason why daddy went insane and ~~nailed his balls to the floor~~ ate his dick.

https://youtu.be/eVSlE28hOgI
it seems strange. I remember seeing merchants in China adopting bitcoin in ~2013 with such enthusiasm, but it never evolved. All the China cares about now is mining and new altcoin creation. 
Thanks. I have seen these on google but wonder without an endorsement from this sub or bitcoin.org. I guess on a dedicated machine with pocket change the risk is pretty low.
Omg ..... this is so Zen!

Why didn't I think of this?!
Update:

"Strong sell" at 0.99928955
More like 8500.

Sorry. Sleeping right now. This must be a dream.
Unboxed  is a blockchain based system  that  allows businesses to pay you directly  for using  your influence.  This  means  you get  a  share  of the  $36  billion they’re  spending  per  year  on FB  ads.  So for every brand related photo you upload and for every  comment you post  you can get  paid. These  are  the  companies working with  us that  are  ready to pay for your engagement.  Join them in the Unboxed community and get paid to post.
During the whole year, I lived for trading only. scored on everything, friends, entertainment.Because i wanted to earn some money for his university and future. 
in my country 1k $ is the average salary for 2-3 months. I think that now it will be difficult to earn. 
Eventually the exchanges will be clamped down, the whales would have left with the money, price would have collapsed and there will be masses of bag holders.
I do not ask people for money. just wanted other people to think many times whether it is worth starting to get involved in such a market where manipulating  is so easy
You must be loads of fun at parties 
Finaly. If its declining, it will not decline more !!!
Sometimes I really don't know if these people are just bored or genuine nutcases who truly believe what they write.

Go back to your Bcash reddit page. Why are Bcash supports so insecure. You choose centralized mining!!! 
Go have fun with that. They see you on bcash Reddit. Get  off this Reddit. 
Check it out. Learn!!!

So you know how the federal reserve was created in secrecy than rushed through congress during Xmas break and how president Wilson said it was his biggest mistake of his presidency years later. Worse than getting involved in WWI he said which the USA population didn’t want to be involved in but it would make the capitalist a ton of money that they hold to this day. Centralized banking is done. It’s done enough damage. Future generations won’t stand for it after having an alternative in bitcoin. Which is designed to be decentralized. Bcash will be centralized by the miners who like bigger blocks so they have more control. Bitcoin stayed true and kept blocks at 1mb so the miners have as much control as the nodes who run the consensus rules. 
Iam gonna buy some now and you will see how it falls quickly down 
[removed]
Now I feel 5k is possible.
I don't know if you're just being sarcastic, but that's such a stupid statement.

1 USD is always equal to 1 USD

1 Rupee is always equal to 1 Rupee

What changes is how much buying power 1 of anything gets you. Saying 1 BTC = 1 BTC means nothing because it goes against what you said before that, about how it's supposed to bring down the central banking system by becoming the new world currency, but all currencies are valued in how much one unit of it can get you. There is literally no purpose to it other than spending it, or holding it hoping it goes up higher so you have more spending power. 

1 BTC always being equal to 1 BTC is such a meaningless statement, and is indicative of someone that doesn't understand core concepts of value.

All currency is relative to something. I guess the USD will do for now. 
Do you know if he immediately converts it back to USD?
Excellent points. I'd imagine Bitcoin isn't giving me 2% back either. 
Lower fees to merchant = better prices for consumer.  lol.  You're probably still waiting for your internet bill to drop after the net neutrality repeal...
Yes by offering a discount to bitcoin users it would be a win win.  Merchant pays less or zero transaction fee, and consumer gets a nice discount.  My incentive to use my credit card goes away.  Plus I never have to worry about a credit card number getting stolen. I also have more privacy. 
un-taxable? The IRS would disagree. 
A little bit of inflation with the USD is highly preferable to watching my purchasing power be cut in half in a few months. 
It's true, credit cards for work very well.
Obviously a nickel is beyond negligible, but this is just reinforcing that there is a long long way to go before there is a case for being used in this manner. 
I know you can't mean that. This sub does not account for even 1% of Bitcoin investment. If you're serious you need to do a little research on the billions and resources being pumped into the growth of Bitcoin. We've barely scratched the surface compared to where this is going. That's no longer debatable.
And in this sub, most people just care about the price. No one actually uses it for anything besides sitting on an exchange, hoping the value will increase.
It depends what you want to put in your blockchain, what information do you need to be validated? And if you need change you could always have timestamp modification and use the blockchain only for audit. You put data in your blockchain that won't change. Auditing companies will need to give certifications, for exemple, you need to be running this many nodes, and they'd have tools to analyze transactions and stuff. It will have nothing to do with the way we're using it with Bitcoin.
I wouldn’t own any if I didn’t.
ATM
A plausible scenario
You still Google Bitcoin everyday even after you know about it?
Hey - I'm in no position personally to endorsed!

But you can set these things up so they are testnet rather than mainnet.  

A lot of this is at the test stage - and even if you go mainnet you're only risking (if there is a risk) what you put on the node.

You could have a separate wallet containing a tiny amount for test purposes.  LN would never know about the rest of your portfolio.

Disclaimer: I'm no expert, just a hodler :)
Let me tell you about BieberCoin. Each coin is backed by one Bieber melody.
Wake up.  It's up 60% now.
So it is a shitcoin?
Well i think you learned a lesson, you just happened to have joined on a bullrun and didn't have enough experience (time) to have lived through a bear market. I guess now you know. Adapt yourself and learn how to survive the bear you seem like you have skills and a will to learn.
The market is so obviously manipulated.  All your "research" didn't make that clear to you?  Just look at any trading graph over a 3 day stretch.  
You said you bought in at rate around 3500 right? It’s now double that and you are complaining?
At least I'm being realistic.
It's weird how tech circles run pretty liberal yet bitcoin is so... whatever this is. Makes me wonder how it's so popular yet. 
>Hope you know the Japanese embassy is in talks with the state department to have Ver pay for his bait switch tactic. He messed with old voters. They write congress and congress listens. Trust me on this. 

Comedy gold.. 


A newbie discovering tor is a dangerous thing.
Aren't Chinese miners really close to having 51&#37; hash rate?
How do nodes have as much control as miners?
>  Centralized banking is done.

Umm, tell that to the guy at the BMW dealership, or even Wal-Mart.
What about 1 Doge = 1 Doge.. Does it make sense now? :D
Bitcoin will undoubtedly coexist with current currencies, but it's global and eliminated the need for a middleman.
It's not tied to any one country or region, and can make large transactions overseas far more efficient. There will be improvements to the network just as is with all tech, and perhaps one day it will replace many fiat currencies. That will require a generation of users that are comfortable managing their finances independently, but with the next generation  being raised in a digital culture, it may happen sooner than we anticipate.
Exactly that guy is a fucking idiot.  It's a bear market where btc is headed back towards $5k and less
Oh.  OK.  That is much clearer.

It is, although when getting paid in Euro if you work in Ireland, they don't generally compare it to USD every week to work out how many Euro to pay you this time.
Not yet. That’s why we need the merchants to understand that it is cheaper for them to accept bitcoin than a credit card.   That’s why so many small merchants only allow credit cards to be used on minimum purchases of like $15.  Especially for food services. 

The Bitcoin discount they could offer would replace your points or cash back on credit card 
[deleted]
1. I don't live in the US
2. Independent retailers selling stuff are more influenced by market forces than effective monopolies.
In other words, you don’t understand price competition.
>Yes by offering a discount to bitcoin users it would be a win win.  Merchant pays less or zero transaction fee, and consumer gets a nice discount.  My incentive to use my credit card goes away.  Plus I never have to worry about a credit card number getting stolen. I also have more privacy.

 Honestly, controlling your own secret key (essentially being your own bank) is not for everyone. 
Yes there is a long way.  The merchants and consumers need to be educated as to its advantages.  Baby steps 
Not really. With successful trades I use my surplus with websites like play-Asia.com to buy games. A few days ago I bought Mario aces.
Also family trip is coming and paid some of the things we’ve planned in bitcoin. 
That was my point, I dont think there is a use.
This is the method I would like to use. 
Well, you still have to enter a keyword even if you just want to go to news section of Google. I do that quite often, so ... yes.
People still do. Compare bitcoin trends against a similar thing that people should already know about, say the dollar, and you'll see the search volume is more or less consistent.

Well, if I’ve drank enough that’s sorta impressive 
Unboxed is taking influencer marketing to the  next  level.  And  it is doing this by including every social  media user  who gets directly involved. So whether you  create, share, or engage  with content, if you’re part of the Unboxed community, you can get paid in seconds for your contribution.
He traded with leverage and lost it all
If it can be manipulated 2 times, of course it can be manipulated 3 times.

The FOMO last year sucked in all the retards.
They have to start somewhere. We never used any other browser. 
And over 90% of the daily trades.  Which is relevant since BTC is not widely used as a currency and therefore has no value other than what the exchanges say.
Bcash is screwed. They are going to destroy Bcash. Bitcoin has too much hash power. 
Actually yes it makes sense but it doesn’t mean anything.
No lol
"Bitcoin will undoubtedly coexist with current currencies"

Or ya know it could just die.  
Anytime you need to convert BTC to local currency, the shovel sellers(exchanges) will charge a fee. In the model you describe, you are just shifting the fees from the banks to the exchanges. 
You’re also stupid lol the bottom was 5.8k
Is it really that much cheaper for a merchant to accept Bitcoin? I mean, the exchange fees are not exactly low.   And there credit card fees aren't that high. At best, it might be on the order of 1-2% cheaper, but then you have to consider the benefits from credit cards.
Yeah bitcoin is sooooo much cheaper until your account gets hacked and you lose 1/4 of your business profits and have no recourse. 

Nobody wants to use bitcoin in the real world.  If they did - they would.  
Or -60% over the last six months. 


See how ridiculous it is to pick and choose dates like that?
No, more like -67% over 2018.
Or -70&#37; or so from December.
That’s true too. 🙂
What's that number since January?
Wait, there are people outside the US?
I do. I also understand how businesses actually function as opposed to the idealistic standpoint that savings actually find their way to consumers with vendors like Amazon or overstock that already have a massive foothold. 
Those who are too lazy or stupid to adapt can keep their fiat and unfortunately watch it devalue more and more each year, while bitcoin’s value will continue to increase year over year. 

These people are always going to be around.  I cringe when I see older people still paying cash at the grocery store.  Holds up the line too while they fumble for change. 
baby steps baby steps baby steps

It's been 10 freaking years.  If bitcoin was sooooo great you'd think people would start using it.  What do you think makes something a good product?  Product succeed because their benefits are obvious to consumers.  Bitcoin will never succeed because you need an hour lecture to people just to talk them into even considering it and even then you need to throw in some "wow banks are soooo evil" just to convince them because its merits alone aren't worth using. 
Decentralized admin pools because they don't trust their IT Dept :P
The worst tinfoil hat nutcases have been into bitcoin since the very beginning.
That's because you are a newbie.
>We never used any other browser.

Tor is not a browser... it's a network.

And my laughs went towards you comment in saying that JP Morgan insiders use TOR to communicate to the outside...

PS: TOR is not fully anonymous. The ones who control the gateways, control the info.
Your in the wrong Reddit. You want the fake ass btc Reddit that lives off its name alone. You must be a miners supporting Bcash. You have all the power as a Bcash miner. 
Absolutely.  Majority of it in China.
Sure. So could the internet, Space travel and many other things that completely overhaul the way things used to be done. I just highly doubt it.
Coinbase pro exchange fees are 0 with limit orders.  

Ultimately we’d want the world to evolve to the point where merchants would no longer want to convert back to fiat.  They’d keep the bitcoin which would increase in price over time due to its deflationary nature.   We are talking years here before this is likely to start happening.  I think it is a worthwhile goal to aspire to.  I like the freedoms bitcoin provides vs. fiat. 
Yes. Fees are anywhere between 1-3% per transaction and contrary to popular belief, much slower. 

A merchant doesn't actually get paid until days after you swipe the card.
That’s why hardware wallets were invented.  People will learn. It will take some time though 
> idealistic

That’s like saying that the solution to a math problem is too idealistic. “Yea 2+2=4 but in practice it’s more like 3.9887333333.” The question isn’t about “practice” though. That comes in a later chapter on the applications of math. And that’s why I’m giving you an F on this quiz.
I agree with you. Similarly, people who are too stupid or lazy to adapt to my new coin - BieberCoin - will have to stick with their useless, inflationary fiat currency. 

It's everyone else that is wrong, not me. BieberCoin is the future.
That's weird because cash is usually faster than card.
Deflationary currency destroys economies.
You are so impatient.  The internet took decades to really go mainstream

Now, tell me how many of these exchanges are not in China?
you know nothing. You just pretend you do.
The fee you directly pay might be zero, but your counterparty is paying a fee so you are indirectly paying some fees. Note that the exchange fees are simply in addition to the transaction, insurance, escrow and reward fees that you would also be paying if you want to match the minimum service provided by credit cards.
Sure, but with Coinbase you're also waiting a week or two for your bank transfer to go through. There's also the case of tons of transfers being "lost", which triggered all of those consumer complaints to the SEC.

Also, you'll need to pay a transaction fee to transfer the bitcoin from your wallet to the exchange you're selling on. Right now it's basically free, but in cases where people are actually using bitcoin (like you're describing), I remember some ridiculous $50 transaction fees.
Luckily thieves don't target bitcoin users and convenience stores are very rare robbed at gunpoint. 
Ok, I'll just call it naive. Better?
Not from my experience 
No.  Governmental overreach and mismanagement is what destroys economies. 

Look at the USA... a disgraceful 21 Trillion in debt. 
This was not caused by deflationary currency.  This is what happens when you let other corruptible people try to run your life, instead of you. 
For sure. I remember back in 1992 people got really excited about the internet and it's all everyone was talking about. Of course, there was a minor setback in 1993 when everyone lost interest, websites went offline, and ISPs were going out of business left-and-right due to lack of demand. Luckily they turned it around just in time for the late 90s .com mania. 
The internet had obvious benefits and use cases.

What does bitcoin have that other services don't already provide?

In another way - people buy thing because they either want or need them.  I will skip the want portion because nobody really wants to buy bitcoin the way you want to buy a pepsi.  What NEED does bitcoin satisfy that some other product already available doesn't meet? 
'I can't reveal too much '

Lol. 😂😂

0 of these exchanges are in china.
https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/mining/pools/

"There are about 20 major mining pools. Broken down by the percent of hash power controlled by a pool, and the location of that pool’s company, we estimate that Chinese pools control ~81% of the network hash rate"
I just paid for food and furniture with bitcoin and the mining transaction fee was only five cents each time. Those days of expensive transaction fees are over.  With lightning network rolling out and as the infrastructure gets better and better, the fees will be negligible even at scale. 
What does the debt have to do with the economy?

You’re drinking too much kool aid at once and getting your thoughts all scrambled.
Yeah, I love the internet argument. Even after the .com bubble burst people were still using it everyday to buy things, chat, play games, email, read news, whatever...

The internet never had a time when its userbase or growth just disappeared overnight. People didn't have to be convinced to use it, or educated on the evils of... traditional publishing systems. As soon as they used it, the potential was pretty obvious.
Wait till he finds out there are many "darknets" ....

"HitBTC and its not reliable website for coin trade/exchange service.[5] by Hit Solution Limited is registered on Hong-Kong jurisdiction with the number 2510720"

ZB.COM is a cryptocurrency exchange based in China that started in November 2017

https://cryptowiki.com/Binance

Binance is a cryptocurrency exchange based in Hong Kong, China under the name Binance International. 

Yes, we all know that a lot of these exchanges are clamped down by regulators and running all over the world trying to find a home.  But it's still Chinese owned and caters to the Chinese market.
Nobody is really using LN yet aside from a few early adopters testing it out. How has bitcoin's infrastructure changed since December/January to allow permanently low fees?

The only reason why you paid a nickel per transaction is because nobody is actually using bitcoin anymore. Re-introduce the activity from early this year and we're right back to $50 transaction fees.
You must be kidding.  The only way to pay down that debt is through tax revenue.  Govt must confiscate more money from it’s citizens if they ever want to pay it down.  Less money in the citizens pockets is less money to be spent buying things. This hurts the economy. 

Until the debt is paid down it is an albatross around a country’s neck. Limiting its full potential to do things like rebuild infrastructure and provide useful services. 
right, so Hong Kong is the same as China.

These are the kind of 'facts' I was expecting from you.
Be patient. Lightning will solve these problems as it grows 
$15T of that is held by the public itself, so your point is mostly irrelevant. About $6T is what the government owes to itself.
I'm really surprised that bitcoin is as popular as it is in tech circles, considering how liberal the tech industry is and how deep into libertarian ideas you need to be to appreciate bitcoin.
Time to face reality - BTC is a Chinese game.  

>Those days of expensive transaction fees are over.

So they're not really over, then?

Edit: Also, do we really need LN in nobody is using bitcoin for transactions anyway?
And how ‘bout that interest on the national debt that must be paid every year? So helpful for the economy. 

In fact since it works so well for the economy, maybe we should all try it at home!  Let’s live large and go into major debt and pay as much interest as possible.  We will be rich in no time. 
Yes fine BTC is not for you. 
Unless we hit another ath before lightning can gain transaction then those days are over. 
Government debt isn’t the same as private debt, period.

And again, the vast majority of that interest goes into the public’s pockets.
