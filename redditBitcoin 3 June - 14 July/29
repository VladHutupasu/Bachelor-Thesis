Let's all hold hands and sing "We shall overcome". 
Good morning! Keep up the good vibes! ü§†
Is there an easy way for me to use LN on iOS? I want to try out this pokemon thing.
Why is the BTC price so low now, can someone explain me?

Is it expected to be higher again?
Good day to you all.
imma call it: it's gonna drop to 5500 in a week or two
Over at r / bcash they are pondering how to separate Bcash's price from Bitcoin.

Here's a suggestion - call it something else you useless fuckers.  Without its association with BTC your lying, trolling Rogercoin would be worth jackshit.

And BTCC now does the job just as well at 1/100th of the price.

Sermon over :)
We haven't had a weekend pump in a while :( 
Daily Hopium:


Said when the price of bitcoin was less than $500 ...

Wish I was as lucky as everyone here to have gotten into bitcoin before it got expensive. Where's a time machine when I need one?

Buy with what you‚Äôre able to lose and your good
6500 is the new norm for next week. 
So if it turns out there was no price manipulation, do we expect the price to shoot up again to over $10k?
After losing money to penny stocks last year and seeing the types of people operating those scams.. I‚Äôm convinced those same people jumped on the crypto bandwagon, to pump and dump it the same way. No thanks.
Good morning friends
Its alive if it ain‚Äôt dead. So keep faith and stay patient. 

This is what I tell myself everyday but now my brain refused to listen and I am losing my patience.
A-C-C-U-M-U-L-A-T-I-O-N. It's happening in the shadows. Perfect time to scoop up cheap-as-fuck alts as well.
Lower the price > shut down the mines > less energy wasted > more energy spent on stuff that actually matters. I think it's a nice progress.
There's no demand for Bitcoin anymore. All that's left is hodlers. 
Next 7200. then 8-9k.

Very Interesting reading...
What are some must-watch videos?


In the short term anything can happen to the price. However in the long term I am very bullish a bitcoin and other altcoins can change world by providing a free independent monetary system. This creates value! Therefore I HODL!
Seems like an balanced,  maybe rather oversold situation. What do you think?
$100m of Tether printed yesterday and the price hardly stayed above $6.5k.

Let's see if Bitfinex dare to issue $500m to bring it to above $7k.  Will be interesting to see SEC's reaction.
Crashing hard. ‚ÄúIt will never hit 5000‚Äù
6300 and bounce to 7200

Hello 6300.  Weekends have been hard on me. Supposed to be relaxing and enjoying them... instead I watch slow bleeds.   Go PUMPs
Be a whale for the day; short it. It‚Äôs time for YOU to fight back.

Shouldve been in the 5k'sby now. 6500 will be the new high.  We'll start seeing the bloody red turd drops this week pushing into 5k.
made almost 3k off this guy livetrading last week https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pweod6nVPnk
made like 3k off this guy live trading in the last couple days https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCtsZb5PhC0
*extends hand*
-good vibes goes here-
Bitcoin requires a constant flow of money into the pot as the whales fleece the rubes. No on cares about Bitcoin anymore hence the price is not going up. It's remaining constant because everyone is just hodling hoping for a miracle.

The $112B question with no consensus on answer.

Dude, nobody knows for sure.
Good morning to you too :)
imma gonna call Ghostbusters
Lots of accounts FUDing today.  Go play your video games.
imma call it:  you're talking shit
if they truly separated it would be worth like 10% of what it is now.
Why even mention it?
I was gonna buy bitcoin when it was $50 but said no too expensive.  

Again i was gonna at $500 but said no too expensive.

Finally did at $5000
hi can you sell me a bitcoin for 500? :)
I really hope we‚Äôre not set up for red Sunday part deux 
Response 
Well, sadly Eric passed away.  The toilets have been refurbished, and the missing remote control for the TV has been replaced with a universal one, but nobody can get Fox News.  Apart from that, it is much the same here.
Despite $100m of new Tether printed fresh from the oven.

Dat volume!
If the allegation that Tether was used to prop up the price is true, then obviously the answer is No.
Shouldn‚Äôt it 
At Least with Penny stock pump and dumps.. these operators attempt to put together some analysis together in their fraudulent activity

With crypto. It's all memes. Circle jerking and terrible economic analysis.  It's just  Laziness
T_D idiot comes here to tell us "no thanks". 
I think it's incorrect to compare Bitcoin with penny stocks but I hear you about the pumps and dumps, so very tedious.

Sure.  Keep filling up your bag so that we can dispose at higher price.
That much electricity is still not enough to power the dim lightbulb residing in your brain.
Lol .... stop trolling :)
no shit
The extreme low volume confirms this!
Imagine complaining about how no one wants to drive a model t anymore. Go ahead and down vote this. 
It smells like we'll go below 6000.
Why are people downvoting RareDollars? No one wants the price to go up anymore?
Have u ever written an own paper? I cannot take this shit anymore... This shit is based on assumptions without any real evidence only some transaction histories..
They said the same about the 2014 rally before the crash, look where bitcoin is today.
This coordinated nonsense is a buy signal if I've ever seen one. Tether is probably not backed 1:1 but this really means nothing for bitcoin over all the other shitcoins and scams in this space.
I think most people here are not in the mood to hear the truth.

Anyway, I have been warning about the Tether time bomb for some time already.  This is the first time that it's proven using statistical methods.  

If the regulators come down hard on Bitfinex, which is just a matter of when, the market will react very badly.

Deadpool.  Lawrence of Arabia.  Apocalypse Now.
The manipulators are gone. Left with some stagnant pricing stagnant volume. Summer holidays now like resource stocks?
RSI is 36.1.  Yes, close to Oversold.

Happens when price drops rapidly and then momentum slows down.

Technically, it represents a buy opportunity when read in isolation.  
Where do you see this?  Not showing up on omniexplorer. 
Damn you might be right lol 
7k never again. 
OUIJA board up and running again?
Noooo wait 
I got insights also :)
I redact 
O.K.  I'll get in the bath and surface every 20 minutes. 
Try saying something positive about BTC (doesn't matter if it's false).

It will help your case.
Anyone believing this is delusional. 
I think the momentum has already started .....

Tons of BTC USD Long positions closed in last two days.  Clear sign of dumping.
exchange statement please, aka proof
I care about bitcoin ü§®  
Not going to happen .... BTC Long positions are dropping like ton of brick.
    Draper says that he has no intention to sell his coins. That, he remarked, would be returning to the past.
I like this sentence :)

What?
Rejoinder

you might wanna check that again
Nowadays, the only way to pump volume is to dump bitcoin.
Read my post again. 
Politics front and center I see!
Very philosophical, I like that
Okay Mr. Tofuspider (*chuckles at the stupid username*) 
it was fighting hard at 6500 and its fighting hard at 6400 now, i think it's either going to break through 6000 if we stay at the same support or perhaps go up if we can get some more volume
Transaction histories are certainly real evidence. 
Assumptions?  No, the author took pains to explain both the methods of analysis and data used.

Look, the authentication is not in doubt.  What you should be worried about is whether the SEC or other regulators will act on it.

On its way to a major crash 
BTC today is where it's price was engineered last year to reach ATH and has been crumbling since despite more Tether being 'printed' to support it.  $2.6B to be precise.
It means everything where the price of BTC is concerned.
If it‚Äôs not backed 1:1 then the equal value is inflated. And the 1:1 is the entire value proposition of tether. 

If this fake volume was used to buy BTC, the people printing tether without the USD to back it up effectively bought BTC at a discount while pumping the price up needlessly.
Nope, they are not gone.  $100m of fresh Tether printed yesterday.

That probably accounted for the bump to above $6.5k.
Where is the bloody bull market?
[deleted]
Arse.
Working well so far since Jan:
https://www.reddit.com/comments/7ptsg3
I can see only $100m printed yesterday (16 Jun).

Is there more?
and even then...

this last dip didn't generate much volume...
The answer is No.
Yeah, volume is the key.
All of which becomes irrelevant once the Tether time bomb explodes.
99% of your posts are idiotic trash.
Tether is still being printed?

Do you have a source for this?
Stop making shit up.
This coming Tuesday 
If you‚Äôre looking at any time frame longer than 6 months, we are already in it 
Never try to catch a falling knife.
it is?  When did btc hit 3k last month?  As that is what your 'analysis' shows.

edit:  Actually it shows that BTC @ 3k in April, so anyone listening to your analysis would have missed out on almost 60% gains from 6.4-10k.   Better luck next time :)
That dip cause a little bit of spike in volume, and disappear after one day. No one is buying bitcoin nowadays. 
You can't be certain of that :) 
Has it not exploded already or atleast the market has factored the possibility of it into the price?

They never stopped.  Another $250m on 19 May.
Another $100m of Tether printed yesterday (16 Jun):

There's enough information in there for you to make your own call.

..shortly after tea time
If you think hard enough you can convince yourself of any delusion. 
RSI 35.4.

That is getting close to 30 (which is the benchmark for Oversold, i.e. less buyers than sellers).
You asked the question based on "expect".

I said "No", meaning I do not expect the price to go to $10k without manipulation.

Nothing can be certain, that's something that I'm sure we can both agree.  
Explode = SEC or equivalent authority indicting Bitfinex for price manipulation using Tether.

Just listen to the number of people here who are still in denial.  Then you tell me whether the price is baked in.


:)
Deep as a thin crust pizza.
So, if the tether is indeed fake and they are still printing it, why couldn't they inflate the market again?
No there isn't.
Well, that‚Äôs a fact. The term bear and bull are relative to the timescale you are looking at.

6 months is not a delusional time period to examine when it comes to an investment, in fact it‚Äôs considered a micro time frame in that context 
[deleted]
Great, now I'm hungry. 
Then don't.

Whether you or I believe is irrelevant.  

The only thing that matters is whether SEC or any of the regulatory authorities want to act on it.  I believe it's a matter of time.

Not when prices are manipulated.  

All comparisons are invalidated in this scenario.
[deleted]
Yep, I was thinking that.  Beef, jalapenos, onions - Mexicano.  

Apparently Trump is separating pizzas at the border because Obama made him do it.
